It all started like this . . .

FEBRUARY 1961

 

For thirty centuries men fought——and many died—for the right to vote
for their leaders and their laws in secrecy, without fear or compulsion,
for this is the very heart of freedom. Long ago men voted by casting a
little ball into an urn, as shown above. (Our word “ballot” comes from
this ancient use of the Italian “ballota”—little ball.) Other groups “bal-
loted” with shells and bronze disks of different sizes. The ﬁrst written
ballot was used in Rome in 139 B.C., and in America seventeen hundred
and sixty-eight years later.

All of these early methods of voting had one serious weakness in
common: There was no secrecy for the voter. The “Australian Ballot,”
brought to this country in 1888, did provide a degree of secrecy~but
did not eliminate the possibility of errors either in marking ballots, or
in counting them.

Thomas Edison was a pioneer in engineering a better way of voting,
and his work helped later inventors and engineers. In 1896, the United
States Voting Machine Company of Jamestown, New York, marketed
an improved device which soon was used widely throughout New York
State. This was the parent of our Automatic Voting Machine Division.

In the last election, twenty-ﬁve million men and women voted on
Automatic Voting Machines built by our AVM Division. They knew
their votes could not be thrown out because of the technical errors so
prevalent when paper ballots are used. They also knew there was no
way for anyone to tell how they voted, nor could the ﬁnal count be
tampered with.

It was engineers, of course, who developed our modern Automatic
Voting Machine into a device capable of being entrusted with man’s
most precious possession: the right to vote. And engineers will continue
to improve it, just as they play an important part in all of the 19 prod-
uct lines that Rockwell makes for 28 basic industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like to work
for, buy from, and invest in.

DESTROYER

_ ‘vV1N<3 FOLD UNE

BY DENNIS MCCARTHY

Many major space technology companies are taking an
early, hard look at methods and devices to detect, track,
intercept and destroy hostile satellites due to the growing
concern over the development of reconnaissance satellites
and armed nuclear bombardment satellites.

Various companies have been investigating these facets
of defense against satellites for some time under the as-
sumption that anti-satellite capability will be required in
the near future. One advanced plan, worked on jointly
by the Hughes Aircraft Company and the Lockheed Air-
craft Corporation/Missiles and Space Division, proposes
a manned space vehicle capable of carrying a pilot and up
to three passengers to rendezvous with friendly satellites and
space stations and to intercept and possibly destroy poten-
tially hostile satellites. The Hughes/Lockheed plan has
been the subject of study by the companies since the sum-
mer of 1958. The proposed satellite, capable of a rendez-
vous with a foreign satellite, was an outgrowth of studies
to provide a method of supplying, re-equipping or exchang-
ing personnel with space stations. The preparation of a
mockup of a small test vehicle is proposed for sometime
in 1961.

The plan proposes a manned, recoverable, and reusable
space vehicle capable of transporting a pilot plus 1,000
pounds of payload or three passengers to orbits ranging
from 100 to 1,000 miles above the earth for periods not
exceeding 24: hours.

The main proposed characteristic of the vehicle will be
a folding arrow wing or notched delta configuration with
aft portions of the wings capable of being folded back over
skewed hinge lines onto forward portions into an arrow-
head shape for launching with a three-stage booster using

present I.C.B.M. launching techniques and guidance sys-
tems.

The Hughes/Lockheed study found that the configura-
tion area for launching could be halved by folding the
wing. It also cuts destabilizing effects on the booster and
provides symmetrical loading to the booster.

The booster is capable of injecting the vehicle into an
orbit height within two degrees of the desired and within
twenty miles of the hostile satellite along its orbit. The orbit
height is determined by the guidance program. The pilot
and possible passengers take no active part in the launch
phase except to actuate escape mechanisms if necessary.

Upon injection into orbit the vehiele’s wings unfold and
an automatic control system or the pilot achieve the desired
attitude. By means of a retractable search and ranging
optical device and a maneuvering engine the vehicle can
be brought within 500 feet of the foreign satellite. A trans-
lationtal and attitude control system combined with visual
observation affords actual physical contact.

The vehicle and satellite may later be separated and
oriented to proper attitude by means of a reaction control
system. The maneuvering engine then provides a retro-
impulse which fixes the re-entry angle and commences an
elliptical orbit with a perigee located within the atmos-
phere. The re-entry would be along a flight path angle of
about one degree below the local horizonﬂal and at an angle
of attack of about forty—five degrees. To minimize struc-
tural temperature the flight path of the vehicle is con-
trolled by an automatic flight control system utilizing a rate
of change of temperature feedback loop. The temperature
control loop is disengaged after the vehicle passes the criti-
cal heat path and the vehicle’s navigation system guides it
toward the desired landing location.

According to Hughes/Lockheed dalculations, ‘the heavi-
est loads on the structure occur during launching when

the vehicle is in the folded position and when structural
temperatures are low. The proposed structural material is
Rene 41 metal, a nickel-base alloy. Alloyed molybdenum
(0.45 titanium) has been proposed for the stagnation
point area where a material capable of resisting higher
temperatures is needed. To provide a lifting surface weight
of less than two pounds per square foot capable of sup-
porting the sandwich panels on the lifting surface, a truss-
type structure is proposed. An integral part of the struc-
ture is formed by the propellant tanks. The lifting surface
provides the necessary shield for the passengers control
capsule which is constructed of an inner shell of aluminum
and a steel outer shell (_to resist corrision and tearing).
The maneuvering engine which is an integral part of the
vehicle itself is a throttleable rocket engine with thrust
ranging from 1,000 to 7,500 pounds. It will burn a high-
cencentration hydrogen peroxide and JP-4. Hydrogen
peroxide was selected as the oxidizer because of its stor-
able capability, absence of toxicity, and applicability either
as a monopropellant or oxidizer. This engine provides the
thrust necessary for correcting navigation errors, orbit
transfer and lift/drag improvement, and control during
landing.
Auxiliary electric and hydraulic power is provided by
a hydrogen peroxide turbo-generator pump. Turbine ex-
haust, condensed in a heat exchanger, supplies water as a
cooling agent and the free oxygen for the life support sys-
tem. The reaction controls are powered by hydrogen
peroxide.
The Hughes/Lockheed proposed system
would be inertial using a stable platform and digital com-
_puter.

guidance

The system would compute and display to the
pilot his position on a moving strip map of the earth or
the stars. The pilot can also determine his position vis-
ually with »a viewing device and can superimpose this data
on the strip map. He can eliminate errors accumulated
in the components and navigation system by matching the
two displlays, locating his, position and inserting corrections
into the computer. An optical tracking system, which
could provide range, azimuth and elevation data for the
computer is under discussion as the system needed for the
rendezvous maneuver. The navigation and guidance sys-
tems are capable of accepting automatic program se-
quences from ground tracking data, thereby permitting
recovery of the pilot in the event of his incapacitation.

The proposed vehicle will contain two different but nec-
essary control systems. The first will be employed in at-
mospheric operations and will use conventional aerody-
namic control surflaces. The other control system consists
of reaction jets and inertial wheels driven by electric
motors and will be used in space operations. The space
attitude and control system, using twelve reaction jets and
three inertial wheels can orient the vehicle to any desired
attitude, maintain that attitude and then translate to
another. The space control system has been proved well
suited to pilot control in simulation experiments.

Existing equipment will probably fulfill the needs of the
communication system. Duplicate equipment will be em-
ployed whenever possible. The principal development ef-

fort will be directed toward an atmospheric communication
system.

The pilot, along with controls and the extendable optical
viewing system will be located in the forward end of the
capsule; possible passengers will be seated in the rear of
the capsule. The 672 cubic foot capsule will contain an
airlock in the center to permit occupants to enter or exit.
Occupants will be equipped with parachutes and in an
emergency will be ejected along with lightweight personal
seats through frangible parts of the capsule. Make-up
oxygen will be recovered from the exhaust of the auxiliary
power unit and will be conditioned by use of filters, ab-
sorbers, and a water boiling system . Oxygen would also
be stored for emergency use. Under consideration, is a
self-sealing inter-liner for the capsule.

The length of the vehicle will be 78 feet 4 inches, and
the wing span is 44 feet 2 inches. The wing area is 1,000
square feet. The proposed landing‘ gear will contain a re-
tractable nose wheel land two retractable tail skids. Maxi-
mum weight at injection into orbit is calculated at 22,000
pounds and the atmospheric re-entry weight is about 15,000
pounds. According to Hughes/Lockheed c.alculations
rendezvous with a hostile satellite in an orbit of about 300
miles above the earth can be achieved in two vehicle orbits
and would require 3 to 4 hours.

Once the vehicle has rendezvoused with the foreign
satellite and its hostile intentions recognized, various tech-
niques are possible for rendering it passive or destroying
it completely. Camera lenses could be sprayed with paint.
Clouds of sand, pebbles, silver, mercury or destructive
chemicals could be hurled against the satellite or placed
in its path to pit camera lenses or corrode solar cells and
protective shields. The sun’s rays could be concentrated
by solar collectors and focused on the hostile satellite to
heat electronic gear beyond critical limits. Beams of
protons, electrons, electrical discharges, or projectiles might
be used to render the satellite ineffective.

It is believed the Russians may acquire techniques to
intercept reconnaissance early-warning and communication
satellites by 1963. On the other hand, the Hughes/Lock-
heed plan is viewed as an expression of technological de-
velopment in 1965.

Glen Nordman rose slowly from his workbench, yawned
once and cursed the pool of plastic oozing over the oddly
shaped tubes of metal.

A definite grinding of gears tore his glance away and
he concentrated on the Swiss clock which was about to
chime.

Eleven times it struck and a little boy bicycled from a
house, hit a tree, turned around and rode back to the house.
Glen chuckled to himself at the precision building of such a
timepiece and turned back to look at his own precision
piece of work which was scattered over the ten-foot work-
bench, occupying half the wall.

A welding machine and various attachments stood be-
side the table. Neatly stacked in the opposite corner were

different lengths of shining blue metal tubes. A wave gen-
erator and coils of wire, amplifying tubes and boxes of
power transistors, relays, plastic cases containing a multi-
tude of small gears, shined with diamond brilliance as the
powerful light of the fluorescent lamps struck them. Ball
bearings glittered like marbles, and the rest of the room was
filled with tools and wooden crates containing the synthetic
plasticene.

He lit a cigarette butt which laid in the filled ashtray
and tore thru the rubble on the bench looking for a new
pack. Putting it in his pocket, he strode from the room, the
lights fading out as he crossed the eye on the doorway. A
sliding door closed after him and the electric lock silently
sealed the room from any intruders.

To the kitchen . . . the icebox . . . a beer . . . make a
sandwich . . . into the living room. A sigh as he sank into a
low slung bubble chair. The phone on the table. He picked
the receiver off the hook and dialed.

“Hello Ned, Glen here . . . Not so good today, the
plasticene won’t flow right over the structure . . . Yea, I
tried that . . . uh huh . . . well look, can you make it over
here for tomorrow night? No, I can’t. I want to fit the com-
puting unit in first and I’ll need your help . . . I’ve been
thinking of doing that . . . No, there’s always a chance of a
fool noticing . . . Yes, it’s better that we take the chance
that everything is in perfect condition . . . The plutonium?
. . . Don’t worry, I’ll have that by the time we’re ready . . .
O.K. . . . See you tomorrow. Ned, make it early, we’ve got
lots of work . . . Right . . . So-long. He relaxed in the chair.

A man was chasing someone. The mist prevented him
from seeing who it was, but he tried running faster, taking
bigger steps. He was tangled in the fog and fell. He got to
his feet and tried running again. The figure was diminishing
in the fog. He fell again and again. Once the fog cleared, he

saw that he was chasing a girl. The fog closed in on him
again. He tried to scream, “Wait, wait, please don’t go,” but
the fog caught the words as they poured from his lips and
the words disintegrated into letters, each one shattering as
in hit the cold pavement.

Glen awoke with a start, he glanced at his watch.

‘Hmm, four o’clock. Living room is no place to sleep.”

He got to his feet and put the unfinished sandwich in
the icebox, finished the beer he had started and went to bed.

Five o’clock, still no sleep. The dream turned itself
over and over in his mind. The same dream day after day
since Myrna had left him. No reason, just one day, bingo——
gone. A note beautifully written. Good-bye. That is when it
all started, the drive to find a companion whom he could
trust and who would never leave him. His best friend, Ned
Montebank, joined in the project. Ned’s knowledge of Bio-
chemistry and the complex structure of organisms made him
a must in the project. With his own engineering and scien-
tific knowledge, he knew they would succeed. That was two
months ago when he decided to build Genie, a girl he would
love eternally because of her pure mechanical magic. Genie
was the girl with ball bearing hips.

Ned arrived early the next evening and the two men
retired to the laboratory to complete work on Glen’s mech-
anical love.

“Ned, finish heating and pouring the plasticene, I’ll
work on the computer, we may be able to install it tonight.”

“Not if you don’t work out that darn clicking of the
relays.” Glen mused over the problem for a second. “What
if we enclosed the relays in an oil bath?”

“It might work.”

“We could always feed the relays thru the main lubri-
cation bellows.”

“Try it.”

Problem after problem was solved and finally the last
aluminum plate was installed, the silk-cotton hair imbedded
in plasticene and fitted to the skull plates, heat was applied
and the plasticene molded itself to the plate. The men stood
back from the workbench.

“She’s all yours Glen.” Stepping back he grinned.

Glen looked at his shapely creation and blushed. “What
say we dress her before activating the computer.”

Surprise crossed Ned’s face. “Don’t tell me you’ve been
shopping for her already?” He burst out laughing and
Glen, still red-faced, brought in the outfit he had purchased.

“I wasn’t sure what size she could wear and then I re-
membered we used a seven and a half inch diameter hoop
for her waist. I thought the saleslady would call the psycho
ward when I said her waist size was pi times seven and a
half.”

Life was wonderful for Glen. Every day he left a col-
lection of books for Genie to absorb and when he walked in
the door, there she was, always neat, her light brown hair
set differently every day. The house was always immaculate
and Glen forgot that she was only a mass of flesh—like
plastic, gears and tubes. Her intelligence was stored in a
magnetic unit and her low-pitched voice soothed Glen after
a hard day’s work.

One thing annoyed Glen, the slight whirring of gears

FEBRUARY 1961

when Genie would sit on the arm of his chair and rub his
neck.

“Genie, have you been reading Romance stories
again?”

“Oh no, Glen. What makes you say that?”

“Just wondered.”

Glen rose and walked to the library. Genie was quick on
his heels, effortlessly gliding along beside him.

Glen spun around. “Do you have to trail me like a
dog? Can’t you just sit in one place or go find‘ a book on the
sex life of a spider or some science fiction? Do anything, but
for heaven’s sake leave me alone for awhile. A1ways- naggin’,
always pesterin’. Leave me alone! I swear I’ll pull every tube
I ever put into you, understand?”

Genie nodded her head and went into her room show-
ing no sign of pain or disappointment.

It was beginning to show on Glen’s face. The idea of
this creation, the perfectionist, the lovely, the chic’ Genie,
who could do no wrong. Had he made a mistake? No, he
was certain that he had not. A little more time maybe. Yes,
that was it, a few more books and and she’ll be fine. He felt
ashamed for the way he had treated her. He walked to her
room and sat down beside her.

“Genie, I’m sorry I blew up like that.”

“That’s all right Glen, no harm.”

“Good girl.” And with that he kissed her right on the
memory unit.

Glen noticed that Ned stopped at the house more fre-
quently than he used to. Genie didn’t seem to mind. As a
matter of fact, she seemed to enjoy seeing him. Glen knew
that Genie was quite fond of Ned, because her relays would
always pulsate a little quicker when he came to the house.

Glen became a little annoyed with his male neighbors
who stopped him frequently and asked who the chick was.
Glen would explain it was his cousin from Los Angeles and
his neighbor would smile a knowing smile and wink.

Rome wasn’t built in a night, but it fell in one day. So it
was with Genie.

Glen had sent Genie down to Ned’s for her monthly oil
change while he went to the office. When he returned, he
found it, the note. It was sweet and concise. “Goodbye
Glen. I’ve fallen in love with Ned and can’t bear to hurt
you, but after all, I’ve got my own happiness to look for.
My transistors hum when he looks at me and my relays go
wild. I know I can never exist without him.”

Glen sat down and thought of Genie, his little Genie
with the light-brown hair and power amplifiers. Her tubing
and wiring, ball bearings, gorgeous metal fingers, and lovely
soft-to-touch plastincene, and her cool lips—that is, cold
lips. Then again, she couldn’t dance very well and he never
did like that cheap oil smell she carried. Well, it was all
for the best.

“Excuse me sir, but I’d like a dozen of these ball bear-
ings and two _]-57 transistors. A radio? No sir, I’m not build-
ing a radio.” Glen smiled, picked up his package and left.
The man at the counter watched him ‘leave and turned to
his associate. “Say, did you see the grin on the guy’s face
when I asked him if he was building a radio? Hmmmm,
must be a nut. Yea, a real nuta

Hamilton Standard’s Electronics Department is currently
developing the automatic stabilization system for Grumman
Aircraft’s exciting hydrofoil boat. This all-aluminum, 80-ton
test design is expected to reach speeds of 60 to 80 knots by
means of reducing its drag through the automatically con-
trolled “lift” of hydrofoils. For peak efficiency, the incidence
of these foils must be continuously controlled so that the
center of gravity will remain steady as wave height and
direction of ﬂow change . . . through every kind of sea.

As you can see, the engineering requirements implicit in
designing an automatic control system for such a craft
created a variety of problems. Engineers had to consider
automatic pitch stability augmentation during take-off, cruise
and landing; manually adjustable trim control devices to
allow the pilot to set desired trim in pitch attitude; pitch
trim control from level to eight degrees bow-up and within
i .25 degrees of reference. In addition, the control, which

A new Westinghouse development could be youI'heart's best friend!

It is a little electronic device with the unusual name of "Cardiac Pacer."
Originally, it was developed to provide a gentle boost to a patient

whose heart faltered or stopped during an operation, or for use as a heart
stimulant in hospital recovery rooms.

Now Westinghouse is working to perfect it for personal use on millions of
heart patients by their physicians. It would be light and easy to carry about.
It may not be cheap, but then life is worth a lot to any of us.

Part of the plan for the future is a radio receiver about the size of a pack
of cigarettes which a doctor could carry with him and, if any of his heart
patients had any trouble,- the radio would beep-beep the doctor. He could
then tune in to that patient, listen to his heart beats, if necessary, and
advise emergency treatment. Wondrous are the uses of electricity.

What’s it take to make the right connection?

Plenty! Consider the problem. Western Electric manufac-
tures the switching systems which connect some 60-million
Bell telephones throughout the U. S. The average call over
today’s electromechanical system requires 420 relay opera-
tions. All together, this interconnecting equipment makes
up the heart of what is, in effect, the world’s largest machine.

That’s where Western Electric and you come in. The
switching equipment for this “machine” involves an enor-
mous manufacturing job carried on by our plants throughout
the country. Because of the size and service requirements
involved, we require quality standards far exceeding those
of ordinary manufacturing. The size of this job presents an
unusual challenge to the engineer who may save the Bell
System many thousands of dollars by even a small cost-
reduction step.

While today’s switching calls for a priority on engineer-
ing, tomorrow’s will be even more exciting. For even -now
the revolutionary Electronic Central Office is under ﬁeld
trial and promises to remake the world of telephony. Future
Western Electric engineers, working closely with their
counterparts at Bell Telephone Laboratories, will concen-

trate heavily on developing manufacturing methods for this
ECO equipment.

Your Western Electric assignments may cover many of
our other responsibilities as the world's leading communica-
tions manufacturer. Perhaps you’ll work on advances in
microwave transmission, or even on satellite communications.

Joining Western Electric may well be your right
connection.

Opportunities exist for electrical, mechanical, industrial, civil and
chemical engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, and
business maiors. For more information, get your copy of “Western

Edward H. Sussenguth, Jr. (B.A., Harvard '54; M.S. in E.E.,
MIT '59) is investigating the theoretical requirements of
an automated design system for advanced cryotron-circuit
computers.

HE WORKS WITH A NEW DIMENSION
IN COMPUTER DESIGN

Thin film cryotrons may make possible computers of small
size and truly prodigious speeds.

The speeds of today's computers are limited mainly by
device switching times. Speeds of cryotron computers would
be limited mainly by signal propagation times between
devices.

Automation of Logical Circuits. Edward Sussenguth is
studying methods of design which will reduce the distance
between devices to a minimum. He hopes to work these
methods into a completely automatic design system.

Ultimately, then, the systems designer would specify his
needs in terms of Boolean _equations and feed them into a
computer. The computer would (a) design the logical cir-
cuits specified by the equations, (b) translate the logical
circuits into statements describing the interconnections,
(c) from the interconnections, position the devices in an
optimal fashion, (d) from this configuration, print out the
masks to be used in the evaporation process by which
these circuits are made.

This is a big order, but Edward Sussenguth and his col-
leagues have already made significant progress. Their work
may well have a profound effect on computer systems in
the coming years.

Orientation: the future. One of the exciting things about
computer development is this orientation towards the
future. If a man wants to match his personal growth with
the growth of computer systems, his future can be virtually
unlimited. This is true of all the fields associated with com-
puter systems—research, development, manufacturing,
programming, marketing. The IBM representative will be
glad to discuss any one of these fields with you. Your place-
ment office can make an appointment. Or you may write,
outlining your background and interests, to:

The trend in electronic design and development is toward
As a

particular piece of electronic equipment becomes more

more complex and smaller electronic equipment.

complex it becomes larger and heavier. In addition the
probability of failure becomes much greater since more
components are used and the number of circuit connec-
tions increases. On the other hand, when emphasis is
placed on miniaturization, the components and circuit con-
nections become so critical that they must be built with
extreme precision.

The need for more complex and smaller low supply-
power electronic equipment is exemplified in the develop-
ment of missiles. Instead of using bulky power consuming
vacuum tubes, semi-conductors are used. Instead of using
wired connections, compact printed circuit boards are used.
We see that this is one step toward the goal of more relia-
ble, complex, compact electronic equipment, but the future

This .is Russel Kril’s second article in the SKY-

step will be the use of basic “function blocks.” These
“function blocks” are solid state elements that achieve,
entirely within themselves, a desired electronic function
that previously have been obtained only by combining
many varied electronic components. This new and dif-
ferent concept of electronics is Molecular Electronics.

The Molecular Electronic concept is dependent on
phenomena occuring within or between domains of mole-
cules in solid state materials. This solid state phenomena
is based on the knowledge developed over the past 30 years.
Transistors are typical examples of this phenomena where
domains are created that have excessive positive and nega-
tive charge carriers. Molecular electronic “function
blocks” use effects of this type by creating, usually in
one crystal, a number of distinct operating domains, each
of which will sustain a desired electronic occurence. The
domains border each other at boundaries called inter-
faces, which have the ability to initiate phenomena different
than those occuring inside the domains. Consider a simple
element that consists of two domains and their common
interface. One of the domains is designed to present a
resistance, R‘, to the flow of current, and the other domain
is designed to present another resistance, R2. The inter-
action of these two domains at the interface causes a
capacitive effect. So this tiny element has the characteris-
tics of a R-G time delay circuit.

Another illustration of the use of domains and inter-
faces in the “function block” designed to convert 110 volt
a-c to 9 volt d-c. The conventional circuit would require
a transformer to step down the 110 volt a-c, a diode to
rectify the low voltage a-c into d-c voltage, and an L-C
filter network to decrease the ripple of the 9 volt d-c.
The molecular electronic counter part is la “function block”
consisting of three domains. When a-c power is sup-
plied to the resistive domain, heat is generated. This heat
passes through the center domain, which is an electrical
insulator, but not a thermal insulator, and into the ther-
moelectrical domain where electricity is generated by the
Seebeck effect. Proper control of the materials used re-
sults in the required 9 volt d-c output, and since the heat
flow is practically constant, no filtering is necessary.

Westinghouse Electric Corporation has developed eight
classes of molecular electronic “function blocks” which are:

PHONOGRAPH AUDIO AMPLIFIER (at right in black mount-
ing) is a tiny device whose volume is about .0001 cubic inch.
Device to the left is a molecular electronic preamplifier.

(1) a 5-watt directly coupled amplifier, (2) a two stage
video amplifier, (3) a frequency selective amplifier con-
taining a notch filter in its feedback loop, (4) a variety of
multivibrators, (5) a variable potentiometer based on Io-
garithmic addition of two inputs, (6) a variety of multi-
position switches, (7) an analog-to-digital converter em-
ploying a relaxation oscillator, and (8) a two stage cooler
that uses the Peltier effect to cool infared detectors to
proper operating temperatures over a frequency range
from less than one cycle to three megacycles.

The molecular electronics concept makes no use of the
traditional approach of circuit and component design.
Instead, a knowledge of the structure of matter is used
to build monalithic “function blocks” that perform various
electronic functions. Since there are no internal connec-
tions or components and only external connections are
needed for the inputs and outputs, the risk of failure of

these subsystems is about the same as that of some of
the more familiar solid state devices and about one-
thousandth of that for a similar subsystem built of many
parts. A comparison of three designs for a light telemeter-
ing system illustrates the ability of molecular electronics
to reduce the number of components and connections re-
quired. When electronic tubes are employed, this sub-
system requires 16 components and 18 soldered connec-
tions; when transistors. are employed, it requires 14 com-
The molecular electronic

nections. Because these “function blocks” perform their
functions within distances on the order of a few atomic
spacings, they are virtually weightless and almost micro-

ponents and 15 connections.

scopically small. Thus the light telemetering system was
reduced from one ounce to one-fourth of an ounce.

Various effects and phenomena of solid state matter are
used to achieve “function blocks.” Seebeck generation,
Peltier cooling, and Hall-effect multiplication are used,
along with PN semiconductor junctions to be performed and
the physical effects necessary for the block. The block
is then produced by the techniques used to make conven-
tional semiconductor, such as diffusion, plating, etching,
cutting, radiation, alloying, and photographic processes.
We see that molecular electronics creates, modifies, and
processes materials through solid—state phenomena to per-
form electronic functions.

The concept of molecular electronics will revolutionize
the electronics industry and extend man’s reach into
space with more reliable equipment as much as :a thousand
times smaller than presently used transistorized equip-
ment. Molecular electronics will make the transistor
radio look like the bulky old time superheterodyne radio.

l‘l1is means instead of having a room full of computer
transistor circuitry, a comparable desk-type molecular
electronic computer will evolve. Due to cost considera-
tions, applications will probably be limited at first to
places where these chanaeteristics are needed most, such
as airbrone defense systems. Later applications will be
found in land-based military equipment, and finally in
commercial and industrial systems. Westinghouse expects
that within three to five years, molecular electronics will
have found widespread applications in air-splace electronic
systems such as telemetering, fire control guidance, com-
munications, counter weapons, and flight control systems.

Regardless of your specialty, you would work in a
favorable engineering atmosphere.

Back in 1925, when Pratt & Whitney Aircraft was
designing and developing the ﬁrst of its family of
history-making powerplants, an attitude was born—a
recognition that engineering excellence was the key
to success.

That attitude, that recognition of the prime impor-
tance of technical superiority is still predominant at
P&WA today.

The ﬁeld, of course, is broader now, the challenge
greater; No longer are the company’s requirements
conﬁned to graduates with degrees in mechanical
and aeronautical engineering. Pratt & Whitney Air-
craft today is concerned with the development of
all forms of flight propulsion systems for the aero-
space medium—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and
other advanced types. Some are entirely new in
concept. To carry out analytical, design, experimental
or materials engineering assignments, men with
degrees in mechanical, aeronautical, electrical, chem-
ical and nuclear engineering are needed, along
with those holding degrees in physics, chemistry
and metallurgy.

Speciﬁcally, what would you do?-your own engi-
neering talent provides the best answer. And Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft provides the atmosphere in which
that talent can ﬂourish.

For further information regarding an engineering
career at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, consult your col-
lege placement officer or write to Mr. R. P. Azinger,

EVALUATION
OF
SPEECH

BY DR. WILLIAM S. TACEY

W/hat is the attitude of an engineering student toward
a college course in public speaking five years after he has
completed it? To find out, a questionnaire was mailed to a

selected list of 83 former students who had studied Speech 1, ‘fl

Public Speaking, at the University of Pittsburgh five years
previously.

Speech 1 is primarily a course in public speaking, in
which each student makes from five to seven prepared ex-
temporaneous speeches and several impromptu speeches dur-
ing the semester. Students earn three credits, and class rost-
ers average 20 per section. The class population consists of
students from the College, Schools of the Academic Disci-
plines, Education, Business Administration, Engineering, and
Mines. All education majors are required to take speech. A
majority of engineers, depending upon their major, are also
required to study Speech 1. For all other students, Speech 1 is
an optional course. Usually the class population is varied in
makeup among students of the several schools. In the current
study one section consisted solely of engineering students.
For them the basic course outline was not altered in any
way.

The primary purposes of the study were to discover the
present occupation of former students, their judgment of
their Speech I course, its value to them, and the kinds of
speaking in which they now most frequently engage.

Of the 83 questionnaires delivered, 18 were returned by
the Post Office Department as unclaimed. New addresses
for 8 alumni were obtained and these questionnaires re-
mailed. Presumably 73 questionnaires reached the address-
es. Thirty-one, or 42.2 per cent were completed and returned.

A surprisingly large number of our former students,
eight, reported that they presently hold administrative or
advisory posts. The greatest number, twelve, are engaged in
some phase of design, from heat exchanges to rocket motor
components. Six engage in some form of planning, including
plan layout and materials handling. Two men reported
themselves to be sales engineers. Two are field engineers, one
tests commercial and development equipment, and one is a
senior research engineer in an atomic reactor study program./"

An “optional” question asked for the name of their pres-
ent employer. Four respondents declined to give the infor-

SKYSCRAPER EN GIN BER

mation. The balance of the men named twenty different
companies, several mentioning the same employer. Twenty-
three engineers replying have remained in or near Pitts-
burgh; the rest are scattered from Ohio to California.
Respondents were asked to list their greatest difficulties
in speaking. The most frequently mentioned fault was inade-
quate vocabulary, eleven stating it. Lack of self control,

either nervousness or self-consciousness, was noted by nine
men. Six reported problems of organization of ideas. Four
wrote of voice fault, and three of problems of speech prep-

aration.

In answering a request that “strongest assets” be listed,
the respondents replied with seeming frankness. The assets
most commonly listed were self-confidence, ability to or-
ganize speech materials, and -good voice. Knowledge of sub-

ject matter and sincerity were deemed strong assets by four
engineers.

In order to get some insight into the attitude of engi-
neers toward the different components of a public speech,
the respondents were asked to rate enumerated items in
both delivery and composition. Those considered “more im-
portant” were to be marked with X, and those “less impor-
tant” with O. Contrary to what the instructor believed he
was stressing in class twelve former students ‘rated “use of
supporting materials” as less important, and thirteen rated
“adaption to audience” the same. “Need for careful prep-
aration” received an encouraging twenty-seven “more im-

portant” ratings.

Respondents were invited to recommend changes for
Speech 1 which might result in making it better fit the
needs of engineers. A total of thirty—eight changes was sug-
gested. Six men urged that more impromptu speaking be
encouraged. Although eleven engineers had listed inadequate
vocabulary as a principal difficulty in speech, only four
urged that more opportunity be given for speaking in class,
even at the cost of reducing class size or in requiring a second
semester of speech. There was little unanimity on other
suggestions.

To learn the nature of their speech activities, engineers
were asked to indicate the kinds they engaged in, both on
and off the job. The most frequently marked activities were
telephoning, participating in conferences, instruction, inter-
viewing, and presiding at meetings.

The questionnaire’s final request was an open-ended

question suggesting that a statement be written about
Speech 1. Sixteen men replied with favorable comments.
Only one answered anonymously. Six regretted that they
had not had more course work in speech and two urged that
the university continue to make it a required course. Two
equated their speech course in value with their engineering
courses. One man stressed the benefits of speech as “back-
ground for all walks of life.’’ Another noted that “college
people are expected to speak well” and added that he did
not get enough speech training in college.

The findings of this study seem to justify the require-
ment of the Schools of Engineering and Mines that under-
graduates must take Speech 1. Graduate engineers use speech
frequently during their careers and rate what they have
learned in the course as being of invaluable aid.

Nuclear

This is the fourth year of the space age. A trip to the
stars is every man’s dream. It is nice to dream, but scientists
must face reality and it will be many more years before the
wonders of this solar system are completely within the range
of manned vehicles from Earth. The hardware is just not
ready yet and it may not be for quite a while. The chemically
propelled rockets of today are limited in their speed and
range to a point where an orbit-to-orbit round trip flight to
Mars, Earth’s nearest planet neighbor, would take 973 days.
What is the next step then in man’s conquest of space?

Currently, there is a great incentive to utilize the poten-
tial energy from nuclear fission in rockets for interplan-
etary travel. Fission is the splitting of an atomic nucleus, by
bombardment with neutrons, resulting in the release of enor-
mous quantities of energy when certain heavy elements, such
as uranium and plutonium are split. The fission of Uranium-
235 yields 10 million times as much energy as the burning of
an equal weight of a high energy chemical combination, such

as hydrogen and fluorine. This leads to the possibility of very
high specific impulses with nuclear rockets.

Fission energy is available either as the detonation of a
bomb or as the controlled evolution of heat. The notion of
using the impulsive thrust of a series of small nuclear explo-
sions was first proposed in 1947. However, greater effort is
being made to produce a steady-stage heat-exchange reactor
for rocket propulsion. In a “conventional” nuclear-rocket
reactor, the propellent would be heated by contact with the
hot reactor structure containing the fisisonable fuel.

The choice of a propellent is of prime consideration.
The basic requirements—low molecular weight and high
specific impulse—ar-e both met by hydrogen which has the
lowest molecular weight and also gives the highest specific
impulse of any element for a given operating temperature.
The vacuum specific impulse of a propellant is defined by
the relation I equals C times the square root of T/ M where
C is a constant for a; given nozzle area ratio and gas specific
heat ratio, T is the propellant stagnation temperature, and
M is the propellant molecular weight.

For flight within the atmosphere, slight additions are
made to this formula. Specific impulse is a function of dilu-
tion ratio—defined as the ratio of hydrogen flow rate to
uranium fission rate—and burn up fraction, which is the
ratio of uranium fissioned to total uranium used. As the
dilution ratio approaches zero, the propellant gas approaches
pure fission products, and at this limit, specific impulse
reaches a limiting value of about 1 million seconds. The cor-
responding temperature of the fission reactor is about 1,000,-
000,000,000 °F. Actually, complete burn up would not be
possible, and specific impulse and temperature would be
something less, depending on the burnt fraction of uranium.
Although the preceding values could never be reached, ura-
nium fissoi ncan produce specific impulses of the order of
hundreds of thousands pounds force per second per pound
mass of propellant, but at operating temperatures of hun-
dreds of billions of degrees Fahrenheit. Obviously, some
compromise must be made between operating temperature
and specific impulse.

The burning propellant in a chemical rocket motor is
hotter than the solid structure containing it. The reverse is

necessarily the case in a nuclear heat exchanger. However,
even wi_th the reduction of the operating temperature below
the melting point of solid materials, a nuclear rocket would
still have specific impulses sufficiently greater than those
attainable with the best high energy chemical propellants to
make its construction worthwhile.

How worthwhile would the undertaking be?

There are generally two agreed areas of potential nu-
clear rocket superiority: delivery of large payloads from the
ground, or near it, to ranges requiring high velocities, and
space flights with substantial payloads using small accelera-
tions over comparatively long periods of time. To determine
the range of application and the benefits to be gained by
going from chemical rockets to nuclear rockets, it is neces-
sary to examine the specific impulses required for various
space missions. The graph presents mass ratio as a function
of specific impulse for various space missions. Mass ratio is
the ratio of final to initial mass of the rocket vehicle. The
missions shown in the graph are given in terms of velocity
increment in miles per second (mps). A velocity increment
of 2 mps corresponds to one-way interplanetary probe flights
started from orbit about the earth. Minimum energy, orbit-
to-orbit, round trip flight to Mars of 973 day duration, and
also earth-takeoff interplanetary probes, are characterized
by a velocity increment of 7 mps. A velocity increment of 16
mps is required for Earth-Mars orbit-to-orbit flight with a
30-day wait at Mars and a total trip time of 1 year. A ve-
locity increment of 30 mps is needed to reduce the Mars trip
to 3 months. A velocity of 100 mps corresponds to velocity
increments required to explore the entire solar system. If a
mass ratio of 0.03 is considered reasonable, then specific im-
pulses of at least 100,300, 750, 1400, and 4600 seconds are
required for velocity increments of 2, 7, 16, 30, and 100 mps,
respectively. Chemical rockets are limited to the first two
missions, because the highest chemical specific impulse is
less than 500 seconds. Solid-fuel-element reactors can handle
velocity increments up to 30 mps. The range of 30 mps and
beyond requires liquid or gaseous-phase reactors.

Of the three basic types of nuclear rocket reactors, the
solid-core reactor is the only type which has actually been
constructed and tested to date. This reactor is one in which
a light weight propellant such as hydrogen is heated to a high
temperature to give specific impulses of about 800 seconds.
The program to construct a solid-core nuclear reactor for a
rocket vehicle began at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory
in 1955. The first successful test of the Kiwi-A reactor was
made last year. The components of a typical turbulent flow
solid-core heat exchange reactor are:

1. Core heat exchanger, consisting of fuel elements, neu-
tron moderator, and structure
2. Neutron reflector surrounding the core
3. Neutron control rods and actuating mechanism
4. Regeneratively cooled nozzle and pressure shell

The fuel elements consist of the fissioning uranium con-
tained in solid materials with high melting points. The work-
ing fluid, hydrogen, flows through or over these fuel elements
to be heated for expansion through a nozzle. The melting
points of the solid materials, containing the fissioning ura-
nium, determine the maximum operating temperature of

the propulsion system. Many materials, such as tungsten,
molybdenum, tantalum, graphite, and various carbides,
maintain structural integrity up to temperatures sufficient
to allow high specific impulses. The scientific and engineer-
ing problems associated wi-th incorporating such materials
in a useful propulsion reactor are of considerable magnitude.
The most refractory materials known are the carbides of
hafnium and tantalum, which melt at about 7000°F. With
this limit in a solid-core reactor, a temperature of 6000°F
should be attainable in hydrogen gas with a corresponding-
specific impulse more than twice as great as the best im-
pulses that can be attained with chemical propellants. Any
operating temperature above l500°F will produce a specific
impulse higher than that attainable with the best high
energy chemical propellants.

The next step in nuclear rocket reactor development
will probably be the construction of a molten or liquid
phase reactor. This type of reactor is one in which the work-
ing fluid is bubbled through the reactor core. Its maximum
operating temperature is limited by the boiling points of the
most refractory compounds. Uranium carbide with a boiling
point of approximately 7900°F, at a pressure of one atmos-
phere could produce specific impulses of roughly 1500 to
1800 seconds with hydrogen as the working fluid. If the
hydrogen to be heated is bubbled through a porous wall or
screen which contains the molten-uranium carbide, the walls
can operate at a temperature below the liquid temperature.
A typical example of a liquid fuel reactor is one in which
molten uranium is held against the porous walls of a rotating
cylindrical container and the hydrogen is heated as it bubbles
through the molten uranium. The fuel is held to the cylinder
walls by centrifugal force. The hydrogen propellant first
passes through the nozzle and then through the reflector to
the gap between the rotating cylinder and the reflector. Then
the propellant is passed through the porous walls, bubbles
through the molten carbide, and finally passes out the nozzle
to produce the thrust. Besides the problem of cooling the
containing walls, the most important limitation of this re-
actor would be evaporation of fuel. To avoid excessive evap-
oraion losses, the uranium carbide must operate far below
the boiling point of the corresponding operating pressure.

The liquid phase reactor is not being considered as seri-
ously as the solid-fuel-element reactor or the gaseous-core" re-
actor. Proponents of the gaseous core reactors propose that
the solid fuel carrying structure be removed, allow the nu-
clear fuel to become gaseous, and mix it with, or actually
allow it to become the propellant. The principal advantage
of this system is its higher operating temperature resulting

in high specific impulse". The technology of gaseous nuclear

reactors has not yet been attempted experimentally and is
only a concept. Although theoretical feasibility has already
been demonstrated for some gaseous-core systems, several
of the practical problems may still prove prohibitive. These
problems are quite severe. The two basic technical difficulties
break down to the following: a limitation of attainable temp-
erature by wall cooling requirements which are likely to
result primarily from the enormously high thermal radiation
level, and the economical maintenance of the conditions nec-
essary for the controlled nuclear reaction in terms of either
weight or cost. Along with these two basic problems there are
normal problems encountered with all nuclear reactors, en-
vironment requirements for shielding, and operational prob-
lems of control, ihstrumentaiton, testing, etc. These problems
will be difficult to overcome until some experimental experi-
ence has been accumulated. There have been a number of
configurations proposed for gaseous-core nuclear rockets, all
of which have higher performance characteristics than other
types of reactors. Due to its extremely high performance
characteristics, a gaseous core nuclear reactor is the goal of
most scientists and engineers involved in rocket research. It is
actually the limit to which a rocket using nuclear fission may
be taken.

Although there are many more years of research ahead
in nuclear fission reactors, there is already talk of the next
step in man’s conquest of space following fission powered
rockets. This would be the use of a controlled fusion reac-
tion. Fusion is the process in which nuclei of a light chemical
element unite with a release of energy, as in the hydrogen
bomb. No controlled fusion reaction has yet been produced
even in an experimental configuration, but it will nevertheless
be an important factor in future propulsion-system consider-
ations. In fact, the “thermonuclear rocket” is considered by
some as the ultimate rocket power plant with an operation
principle lying within the concepts of present scientific
knowledge. Estimates of operational target dates for station-
ary power plants of this type range from 15 to 100 years.
Thus, it is pointless to discuss detailed engineering aspects
of the as yet unknown fusion reactor configuration.

Since any of the nuclear rocket reactors discussed will
be an expensive piece of machinery, great savings would re-
sult if it were possible to reuse the motor after a mission.

‘This is an important point of discussion, but there are reas-

ons to believe that this will not in general be practical in
spite of the cost. As an example, one does not simply shut off
a solid-core nuclear reactor motor after use and expect it to
survive. The induced radioactivity will produce heat at such
a rate as to require substantial flow of coolant for some days,
in order that the reactor will not burn itself up. In other
words, the use of a rocket will still be a“one shot” affair for
many years to come.

After examining the capabilities of today’s science and
technology it is quite safe to state that it will be quite a while
before men will fly to the stars. However, we are rapidly
approaching the time when the hardware will be capable of
manned flights within our own solar systems. In what year
of the space age will man be capable of reaching other solar
systems? Your guess is as good as mine. .

Last year Universal Oil Company installed a new unit
to separate two chemically similar substances. The specific
operation achieved was the separation of n-penﬂanes and
n-hexanes, which were to be isomerized to higher octanes.
At the same time the new process was found to be very
suitable for those precise separations which until then were
accomplished by fractionlation. Among the other properties
discovered, it was found that the new separating agent was
also Q. powerful adsorbent. This promising new adsorbent
material, now on the market, is called molecular sieves.

Molecular sieves are composed of crystalline calcium-
alumino silicates. Their technical name is zeolites, derived
from the Greek words zeo (to boil) and lithos (stone).
When zeolites are heated, they allow their water of hydra-
tion to boil off, but upon cooling, they readsorb the water
vapor from the air. One of the reasons for this adsorbent
property is that the crystals contain hundreds of thousands
of pores, providing a large internal surface area. Together
with the powerful ionic forces of the crystals, this property
produces in the sieves a strong attraction for water.

It is the porous property of molecular sieves which
enables the zeolites to separate even the most chemically
similar substances. With pores so small that their diameters
are measured in Angstrom units, they sepanate simply
by allowing molecules of

some substances to pass

 

James Falk, a freshman with his first article in this
issue, became interested in molecular sieves after read-
ing the annual stockholders’ report of the Union Carbide
Corporation. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Pittsburgh has
been his home for the last three years. Among «the other

through, while excluding other undesired substances. This
unusual property is due to the structure of the crystal as
a whole, for the strict dimensions of the pore sizes are de-
pendent upon the tetrahedral shape of the crystal. Four
oxygen atoms surround each metal cation, and four metal
cations surround each oxygen atom. This continues, form-
ing the tetrahedral crystalline structure. Because of the
strong bonds, typical of tetrahedral crystals, even outside
forces such as high temperatures and high pressures have
little effect on the zeolites. These same bonds insure uniform
dimensions within the crystal, and this also results in uni-
form pore sizes throughout the crystal.

By Varying the type-of cation in the crystal, the dia-
meter of the pores can easily be changed. If the cation is
Na and a smaller pore diameter is desired, the manufacturer
simply replaces the Na ion with one of a larger size, per-
haps the Ca cation. The larger cation will occupy more
space inside the crystal than would the smaller one, thus
reducing the diameter of the pore. Since different appli-
cations of molecular sieves require different size pores, this
presents a definite advantage to a manufacturer such as

‘Union Carbide’s Linde Company, which tailors the sizes of

seem to work well even below thirty per cent humidity. One
type of molecular sieve, for example, adsorbs eighteen
weight per cent of the water in a gas even if the relative
humidity of the gas is only one per cent. If the gas is at
this same relative humidity, silica and alumina dessicants
adsorb less than [our weight per cent of the water vapor.
This important feature has Ialready been put to use in
one operation where molecular sieves are drying over 3000
cu. ft. of hydrogen per day. The incoming hydrogen has
a low relative humidity (one per cent), but the effluent
gas stream has a constant dew point of 75 degrees F.
Another important item which should be considered when
installing molecular sieves in drying operations is that, for
a given cycle length, less adsorbent is needed. The vessels
containing the molecular sieves can therefor be made smal-
ler and will cost less. Greater economy in regeneration also
results because less adsorbent has to be reheated to remove
a given quantity of water. Blowing a hot purge gas through
the bed will speed the regeneration cycle and may result
in substantial savings. Practical loading capacity is easily
obtainable too, and there is no need for previous refrigera-
tion of the adsorbtion bed since one heating will suffice
to place the sieves in operating condition.

For the drying of high temperature gases, molecular
sieves have the distinction of being the only solid des-
sicants commercially available to do the job. Because
alumina and silica adsorbents fall off so sharply in their
efficiency when the temperature exceeds 80 degrees F .,
the very fact that molecular sieves adsorb anything at all
at these temperatures would make them outstanding for
certain operations.

Molecular sieves are also little affected by residual
water, even at high temperatures. Since amounts as small
as two per cent residual water can completely neutralize
the adsorbtive capacities of alumina and silica dessicants
in some instances, while even higher water concentrations
have almost no effect on molecular sieves, this is an im-
portant considenation. Another aspect of any dessicant is
that when it adsorbs water, the latent heat of adsorbtion
is released. This increases the temperature considerably,
especially if the concentration of the water vapor is high
and the bed is not cooled during operation. Molecular
sieves, however, perform well even under these conditions.

This results in lower installation costs, since the expense of
cooling coils may be deferred. No matter what the rela-
tive humidity, molecular sieves have a higher breakthrough
capacity than other types of adsorbents. Only at eighty
per cent relative humidity and higher can the isothermal
performance of a silica-type adsorbent compare with the
adiabatic performance of molecular sieves. This allows
molecular beds to be returned to service even before they
have completely cooled from the regeneration temperature.
Cycle time of the adsorbtion bed can also be cut without
sacrificing operational efficiency. When the gas is of -a
low relative humidity, this savings increases. Also no
preliminary cooling of the gas is necessary when molecular
sieves are used.

Molecular sieves dan even dry gases at high velocity.
At 50 per cent relative humidity and at low linear velocity,
silica type adsorbents and molecular sieves perform equally
well, as long as the silica is cooled so that it is adsorbing
isothermally. When the relative linear velocity is increased,
however, silica dessicants fall quickly in their efficiency,
while molecular sieves are changed little.

Molecular sieves have shown the ability to dry gases
without altering their composition. When the composition of
gas is of critical importance, this may be a decisive. factor.
Molecular sieves compare well in this respect to those des-
sicants which adsorb other materials besides water. In order
to prevent co-adsorbtion when using molecular sieves, it is
only necessary to change the size of the pores. If the pore
diameter is changed, the molecular sieves will still have
approximately the same adsorbtive capacities, but it may
then prevent bigger molecules from passing through its
pores. When the pore diameter is 4 Angstroms, no carbon
molecule containing over two carbon atoms will pass through
the pores, and neither type 4A nor 5A molecular sieves will
adsorb branch chained or cyclic hydrocarbon compounds.

Molecular sieves have such a great attraction for water
that they allow water to replace other substances if they
can, even materials already adsorbed. Naturally the effici-
ency of molecular sieves will be lowered if an absorbed ma-
terial has to be displaced. Compared to other adsorbent
systems, however, in some openations, this still represents a
considerable improvement.

By careful selection of the proper size pore, it is possi-
ble to accomplish the opposite effect, that of adsorbing
water along with other impurities. In such a system, water
would be adsorbed at the inlet of the drying unit because
it displaces other materials, but a second bed of molecular
sieves further down the column could adsorb the unde-
sired impurities. With most other types of adsorbents this
action would continue until the water started to replace the
other impurities further down the column, and the: impuri-
ties would soon reappear in the effluent gas stream. This
trouble can be avoided by proper design of the molecular
sieve bed, a.nd allowing suﬂicient capacities for the impur-

ities.

In other drying operations molecular sieves have still
other advantages. When drying ethylene glycol dimethyl
ether, both water and alcohol must be removed. With
molecular sieves, both of these steps are done simultane-
ously. Sieve pellets are also effective in drying transformer
oil, and the pore sizes can be adjusted so they do not permit
the co-adsorbtion of di-tertiary-butyl-para-cresol, as other
types of adsorbents are prone to do. In the drying of
ethanol, molecular sieves continue to show their preference
for water above other liquids. Breakthrough occurs far
more seldom with molecular sieves than with activated
alumina. A single pass through a bed one inch in diameter
and 57 inches long with a linear velocity of 0.1 ft. per min.
was enough to dry the ethanol from 0.5 weight per cent
water to less than 10 parts per million.

Molecular sieves can be used for drying applications
other than removing water. Since these other liquid mate1‘-
ials are held less firmly by the molecular sieves, lower temp-
eratures can be used. In these operations it may not be
necessary to use a purge gas, although operating eﬂiciency
will usually be improved if this is done. In some cases the
material may be displaced from the sieves with water, be-
cause the sieves hlave a greater attraction for water. This
process is especially practical if the material is explosive
when reacting with other materials needed to purge it.

By driving off the adsorbed material molecular sieves
can be used over and over again. When one unit is adsorb-
ing, another is being purged, and still another being cooled.
If the gas’ is of a low relative humidity, a two unit system
may be adequate, where one unit Iadsorbs while the other
is being regenerated. The design of these systems will have
a bearing on the efﬁciency of molecular sieve units. Com-
plete regeneration is desirable, otherwise material is already
present in the unit when the cycle begins, and less mater-
ial can be adsorbed. This residual loading must be taken
into consideration when ﬁguring out the efﬁicency of the
unit. The three steps are heating, purging, and finally
cooling the bed. The general technique is to use high temp-
eratures so that regeneration will be most complete. If
the sieves are to be used for only a few cycles, or for a

short life with short regeneration cycles, they can be heated
to as high as 1,100 degrees F. and not undergo serious dam-
age. Nlaturally lower temperatures (400 to 600 degrees)
will not be so hard on the sieves and will permit longer life.
Of course the temperature will also be dependent on the
amount of moisture present in the purge gas being used.
At 400 degrees, a purge gas with a dew point of 35 degrees
F. will leave about three per cent residual water in the
bed. This same gas, however, heated to a temperature of
600 degrees F. will leave only one per cent water in the
bed. Almost any heating method will do the job of raising
the temperature to the desired degree.

Cooling the bed is important, since the bed will oper-
ate at higher efliciencies with lower temperatures. A cooling
gas can be used for this purpose, but it should be of low
relative humidity to avoid saturation of the sieves before
the adsorbtion operation is even started. The cooling gas
should be blown through the bed in the same direction as
the gas during the adsorbtion cycle. If this is not done,
then premature break through may also occur because the
water will be adsorbed at the inlet. Imbedded coils will
also do the job, and these coils can also be the same ones
used to heat it up during the ﬁrst step of the regeneration
cycle. A cool dry gas will help to dissipate the heat much
faster.

Molecular sieves have a number of properties which
give them a high level of efficiency in commercial gas dry-
ing operations. Some of their advantages which have been
mentioned are: they dry -gases more completely than other
adsorbents, they super-dry gases which already have a low
relative humidity, they have. a capacity for drying gases at

elevated temperatures, they retain large capacity even when-

drying gases at high velocities, they can dry gases without
otherwise altering the composition of the gases, they can
selectively remove impurities as well as water from gas
streams, and they will operate under a combination of
these conditions. To quote Linde Company, a division of
Union Carbide, “Molecular sieves will perform better under
adverse conditions than other commercially available ad-
sorbents will perform under the most favorable conditions.”
Molecular sieves do indeed have a unique combination of
properties which promise to make them the adsorbent wide-
ly used in many future chemical separation operations.

Surprising? Not if you realize that steelmaking requires
a tremendous amount of electric power.

It takes about 20,000 electric motors to drive the
rolling mills and other equipment at our Sparrows Point
Plant, near Baltimore, the nation’s largest steelmaking

we produce enough power for a city of 250,000.

Taking the pulse of a petrified river

From the Colorado plateau —once the floor of a vast inland sea——
comes the wonder metal uranium. Using sensitive instruments, Union Carbide
geologists ﬁnd its faint gamma rays along the beds of ancient petriﬁed rivers.

Every ton that is mined ultimately yields just about half an ounce
of uranium 235 . . . precious food for atomic reactors. At Oak Ridge, Tennessee
—the great atomic energy center operated by Union Carbide for the U. S.
Atomic Energy Commission—the fuel becomes the kind of energy that will
drive a submarine . . . light a city . . . or help doctors pinpoint the location
of diseased tissue.

Finding, reﬁning, and researching the materials used in atomic
energy are all part of the work done by the people of Union Carbide to enrich
your daily life. With pioneering curiosity, they are seeking new things not
only in atomic energy, but also in the ﬁelds of carbons, chemicals, gases,
metals, and plastics.

Manned space missions of extended "flight
duration must have a large, continuous, long last-
ing and reliable source of electrical power. Only
a nuclear reactor heat source is compatible with
these requirements to provide power for propul-
sion and to operate all equipment aboard the
spacecraft. Advanced nuclear energy conversion
systems are now being developed by Garrett’s
AiResearch divisions to meet these new power
requirements.

Besides nuclear and solar power systems for
space applications, other project areas at Garrett
include: electronic systems, such as flight data com-
puters and solid state transistorized conversion
systems for high speed generators; and complete

This diversification of project areas enables
the engineer at Garrett to specialize or diversify
according to his interest, not only making work
more interesting but increasing the opportunities
for responsibility and advancement.

An orientation program lasting a number of
months is available for the newly graduated engi-

Photography
at Work

with you.

From the time a scientist’s mind ﬁrst
sparks an idea for exploring space,
photography gets to work with him. It
saves countless hours in the drafting
stage by reproducing engineers’ plans
and drawings. It probes the content
and structure of metals needed by
photomicrography, photospectrography
or x-ray diffraction. It checks the opera-
tion of swift-moving parts with high-
speed movies—records the ﬂight of the
device itself——and ﬁnally, pictures what
it is in space the scientist went after in
the ﬁrst place.

,A

There’s hardly a ﬁeld on which you
can set your sights where photography
does not play a part in producing a
better product or in simplifying work
and routine. It saves time and costs in
research, in production, in sales and
in oﬂice routine.

So in whatever you plan to do,
take full advantage of all of the ways
photography can help.

CAREERS WITH KODAK :

esses becoming increasingly important in the

EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY

Q. Mr. Hill, what can I do to get the
most out of my iob interviews?

A. You know, we have the same
question. I would recommend that
you have some information on what
the company does and why you be-
lieve you have a contribution to
make. Looking over company in-
formation in your placement oﬂice
is helpful. Have in mind some of the
things you would like to ask and try
to anticipate questions that may
refer to your speciﬁc interests.

Q. What information do you try to get
during your interviews?

A. This is where we must ﬁll in be-
tween the lines of the personnel
forms. I try to ﬁnd out why partic-
ular study programs have been fol-
lowed, in order to learn basic motiva-
tions. I also try to ﬁnd particular
abilities in ﬁelds of science, or math-
ematics, or alternatively in the more
practical courses, since these might
not be apparent from personnel rec-
ords. Throughout the interview we
try to judge clarity of thinking since
this also gives us some indication of
ability and ultimate progress. One
good way to judge a person, I ﬁnd,
is to ask myself: Would he be easy
to work with and would I like to
have him as my close associate?

Q. What part do first impressions play
in your evaluation of people?

A. I think we all form a ﬁrst im-
pression when we meet anyone.
Therefore, if a generally neat ap-
pearance is presented, I think it
helps. It would indicate that you
considered this important to your-
self and had some pride in the way
the interviewer might size you up.

Q. With only academic training as a
background, how long will it be before
I'll be handling responsible work?

Interview with General Electric’s

W. Scott Hill

Manager — Engineering Recruiting

Qualities I Look For

When Recruiting Engineers

A. Not long at all. If a man joins a
training program, or is placed direct-
ly on an operating job, he gets
assignments which let him work up
to more responsible jobs. We are
hiring people with deﬁnite consider-
ation for their potential in either
technical work or the management
ﬁeld, but their initial jobs will be
important and responsible.

Q. How will the fact that I’ve had to
work hard in my engineering studies,
with no time for a lot of outside activi-
ties, affect my employment possibilities?

A. You’re concerned, I’d guess, with
all the talk of the quest for “well-
rounded men.” We do look for this
characteristic, but being president
of the student council isn’t the only
indication of this trait. Through
talking with your professors, for
example, we can determine who
takes the active role in group proj-
ects and gets along well with other
students in the class. This can be
equally important in our judgment.

Q. How important are high scholastic
grades in your decision to hire a man?

A. At G.E. we must have men who
are technically competent. Your
grades give us a pretty good indica-
tion of this and are also a measure
of the way you have applied your-
self. When we ﬁnd someone whose
grades are lower than might be ex-
pected from his other characteristics,
we look into it to ﬁnd out if there
are circumstances which may have
contributed.

Q. What consideration do you give work
experience gained prior to graduation?

A. Often a man with summer work
experience in his chosen academic

ﬁeld has a much better idea of what
he wants to do. This helps us decide
where he would be most likely to
succeed or where he should start his
career. Many students have had to
work hard during college or sum-
mers, to support themselves. These
men obviously have a motivating
desire to become engineers that we
ﬁnd highly desirable.

Q. Do you feel that a man must know
exactly what he wants to do when he is
being interviewed?

A. No, I don’t. It is helpful if he
has thought enough about his in-
terests to be able to discuss some
general directions he is considering.
For example, he might know whether
he wants product engineering work,
or the marketing of technical prod-
ucts, or the engineering associated
with manufacturing. On G-E train-
ing programs, rotating assignments
are designed to help men ﬁnd out
more about their true interests be-
fore they make their ﬁnal choice.

Q. How do military commitments affect
your recruiting?

A. Many young men today have
military commitments when they
graduate. We feel it is to their ad-
vantage and ours to accept employ-
ment after graduation and then ful-
ﬁll their obligations. We have a
limited number of copies of a De-
partment of Defense booklet de-
scribing, in detail, the many ways in
which the latter can be done. Just
