Enginuity is another example of the ways in which the
Engineering school is preparing students for an attack on CAS.
Why else would participants have to solve problems as clues
to a puzzle, if not to educate them in code-breaking? And
once they’ve solved the clues, they have to build some kind
of mechanical object, which is obviously good training in
following directions.

Without a doubt, the most suspicious event during
Engineers’ Week is the parade. All those floats could some-
day soon turn out to be clever camouflage for tanks or 80
mm cannons. Wouldn't Chancellor Posvar be surprised if a
tank disguised as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves pull-
ed up outside the window of this office in the Cathedral
someday! This is a dangerous situation, because Engineers’
Week and the parade have become such a tradition that any
year soon the engineering students could decide they're
ready to attack, and we wouldn't have any warning. I think
Engineers’ Week should have a stop put to it before it's too
late.

At this t )int I think it’s only fair that I explain why I think
the engines .5 would want to take over CAS in the first place.
Even though they tend to look on CAS students with scorn,
I think engineers are jealous of those of us in CA5 because
we can take just about any courses we want, and because
we don't have to take as many credits every term as they
do. I think they would like to take over CAS and make it
much more difficult than it is, because then they wouldn't
feel left out of social activities because of the amount of work
they have to do — if CAS was harder, there wouldn't be any
social activities.

Well, that's what I think is going on in Benedum. I'm
sure there could be other interpretations, but I think that if
the evidence is examined closely there can be no doubt that
something ominous is going on up there. I don't know what
anyone else intends to do, but I'm going to put heavy bolts
on my door and keep an eye on activities in Benedum. If
the attack comes before I graduate, I'm going to be ready
to head for the North Side.

A Diversity of Talents,
A Spectrum of Interests and Ideas:

The Undergraduates
of Pitt’s
Engineering School

In the collection of articles that follows, Skyscraper
Engineer pays tribute to that group of people which are
at the heart of any university, the undergraduate
students. The Skyscraper staff selected one student from
each engineering department including the freshman
class. It is our belief that the undergraduates selected
represent well the multitude ofactivities and interests
in which Pitt’s students may become involved. In some
respects, our featured undergraduates share goals com-
mon to many engineering students, such as the desire
to effectively unite the rigors of the engineering cur-
riculum with their own interests and activities. At the
same time, these students provide a glimpse of the
fascinating variety of personalities to be found in the
School of Engineering. It is our hope that these articles
may provide for our readers a portrait of Pitt's engineer-
ing undergraduates.

John Gargani

Freshman Engineering

by Al Dorundo

John Conrad Gargani, ”Gar” to those who know him,
demonstrates well the success which a student with a serious
academic interest may achieve.

John has been a lifelong resident of the Pittsburgh area,
and is a recent graduate of Seton-LaSal|e Regional High
School. At Seton—LaSalle, he amassed an impressive list of
achievements and was involved in a variety of activities.
Among his accomplishments were: being salutatorian of his
senior class, earning highest honors throughout high school,
being chosen as a National Merit Finalist, and winning
several scholarships including the Richard King Mellon
Scholarship and the Provost's Scholarship here at Pitt.

While at Seton—LaSalle, John was high scorer for three
years on the math team. He also served as president of Foren-
sics, and treasurer of his school's chapter of the National
Honor Society. John's passion for entertainment was evi-
denced by his involvement with drama. He held the lead
in his freshman class play, and was stage foreman of the stage
crew during his succeeding three years.

John's reasons for choosing Pitt were twofold. First, he
wanted to continue living in Pittsburgh. More importantly,
however, Pitt showed more interest in securing him as an
undergraduate student than did other area universities. As
John recalls, ”Pitt rolled out the red carpet. While touring
the university, Pitt showed me the facilities at Benedum, in-
cluding the laboratories where practical experience in
engineering is acquired.”

Here at Pitt, Car is planning on majoring in Chemical
Engineering. As he explains, ’’I like chemistry. I plan on us-
ing engineering as a stepping stone. With an engineering
degree, you can go into many other fields, such as medicine
or law, or continue on to graduate study in engineering.”

John finds the academic environment at Pitt to be
challenging ’’I can't imagine another school being tougher
than Pitt,” he relates. ”|t’s not a party school, at least not
for engineers. High school gives you about three weeks worth
of education for college; after that you're on your own.”

* \ ‘H.

 

John Gargani

In just two months at Pitt, John is already involved in
several activities, including Sophomore Honors in Engineer-
ing (S.H.E.) and Triangle Fraternity. S.H.E. is a
unique three—term option to the regular freshmen curriculum
involving the University Honors Program courses, in areas
such as physics, chemistry, mathematics, english and
philosophy. The classes are taught by select faculty who are
genuinely interested in working with such motivated
students. John describes the program in an interesting man-
ner, ”Through the S.H.E. program, you can get an Ivy League
education at a state school price.” He also comments that,
”S.H.E. is a challenge, involving more work than the regular
freshman courses.” His reason for continuing in the program
is based on a feeling of satisfaction with his work. ”|t’s bet-
ter to work above your potential than below it.”

John is also president of the fall term pledge class at
Triangle Fraternity, a fraternity of engineers, architects and
scientists. Gar pledged because ”two other S.H.E. people are
brothers at Triangle. At a large university such as Pitt, it's good
to have people with similar interests; people that have gone
through what you will be going through. Charles Aveni, the
freshmen engineering advisor, was also favorable to my
pledging when I questioned him about it. Besides, they have
a pool table.’’

John finds that Greek life offers many activities and
benefits. Triang|e’s brothers have an opportunity to gain in-
valuable business experience, since they have occasion to
hold an office in their chapter. Since they own their own
house, the brothers have a chance to live and work together
in an environment conducive to such a demanding discipline
as engineering, and they also have the responsibility of main-
taining the chapter home.

John ”Gar” Gargani is indeed a talented individual, as
his academic excellence and activities both throughout high
school and already here at Pitt have shown. His involvement
in S.H.E. and his fraternity demonstrates that he is willing
to seek out challenges and accept responsibility. John's future
at Pitt likely holds many more challenges and opportunities.
It seems equally likely that John will continue to pursue his
goals, and in the process, contribute much to his activities
and associates.

Edith White

Chemical Engineering

by Dave Mahofski

The freshman year of college is a major transition period
for most students. Edith White, now a senior in the Chemical
Engineering Department, was no exception. She learned col-
lege took hard work and dedication, and spent her freshman
year concentrating mainly on academics. As a reward for her
perseverance, she made the dean's list with very impressive
grades.

Edith, feeling secure in her transition to college and of
her academic achievements, soon pursued more extracur-
ricular activities. Edith has been a member of the Society of
Women Engineers during all four of her years at Pitt. She

10

also became a member of the Black Engineering Council
(BEC) in her sophomore year. Edith’s first position on the
council was that of publicity chairperson. From there Edith
was elected to vice—president in her junior year. Edith, as a
senior, is now serving as president for the council.

The BEC is an organization whose goal is to help unite
the blacks on campus enrolled in either engineering or other
technical electives. For example, the BEC is presently en-
gaged in a Big Brother—Big Sister program. In this program,
seniors are paired with sophomores while juniors are paired
with freshmen. Those pairings are made either with people
of the same or similar majors, and they are designed to help
the underclassmen who might be having problems with
school. The program gives newer students someone to talk
to who has already gone through the same situations.

    

Edith White

Edith comes from the Homestead area. She attended
Westinghouse high school and graduated in 1979. Surpris-
ingly, Pitt was not Edith’s immediate choice for her college
education. As a matter of fact, Edith didn't even apply to Pitt
until May of her senior year. Edith’s first two choices for a
college were the University of Dayton and Carnegie Mellon
University. Before making herfinal decision, however, Edith
received a visit from Mr. Edward Chambers, the director of
the impact program at Pitt. This visit stirred interest in Edith
in the possibility of attending Pitt, and soon Edith was given
a tour of the University's facilities.

She then decided to enroll at Pitt and was awarded two
scholarships; one is from Gulf Oil, the other is a Nuclear
Utilities Service (N.U.S.) scholarship. Each scholarship is
given only to chemical engineers, and combined they paid
for all of Edith’s tuition and for her books. In addition, Edith’s
summer work provides the money for her room and board.

Edith, reflecting back on her decision on which college
to attend, feels she again would select Pitt. This feeling seems
emphasized by the fact that Edith has a sister who is now
in the freshman engineering class. The main reason for Edith’s
sister's attending Pitt is that Edith likes it here so well.

When asked what Edith thinks of the new freshman cur-
riculum, she said that she believes that it is much more
challenging now. She does issue some encouragement to
those really just embarking on their engineering education,
”The engineering curriculum is only as hard as you make
it.” Edith stresses that underclassmen in need of help
shouldn't be afraid of seeking advice and assistance, for
everyone needs a helping hand at one time or another.

Allyson Liohtenfels

Civil Engineering

by Laurie Peach

A person on his or her way to becoming an ”engineer”
is sometimes stereotyped as being a student who has a
calculator strapped to his belt, has a pencil behind his ear,
and spends 23 out of 24 hours a day buried in books. For-
tunately, this is only a stereotype. An excellent example of
a engineer who disproves this theory is Allyson Litchtenfels,
a senior undergraduate from the Civil Engineering
Department.

Allyson is vice president of the Society of Women
Engineers, a member of three active honoraries, and a
member of the American Society of Civil Engineers. She
literally ran Engineer's Week for the Civils last year, and she
even played intramural volleyball for her department. ”Some
people just go to class, go home, and work. They don't care
to get to know anyone else except the authors of their books.
But you miss a big part of college if you don't get involved.
College isn't all academics. In fact, I've learned twice as much
through my activities as I have through my classes.”

Her father, being an electrical engineer, greatly influ-
enced AIIyson’s decison as to what she should take as a ma-
jor. But Allyson feels that perhaps the main reason for her
choice was her love of people and her desire to contribute
what she could to society by developing her talents in math
and science. Unlike her father, however, Allyson decided
not to enter electrical engineering; she instead entered the
Civil Department because of her interst in the environment.
She came to Pitt in order to experience a change from her
rural neighborhood, but she misses her home's natural sur-
roundings. ”We can learn so much by watching nature and
following its lead. We like to think we can control nature,
but that's impossible. If engineering is used correctly, we can
help to prevent problems as well as solve them."

Allyson came from a small high school named Harbor-
creek, near Erie, PA, where she spent most of her time study-
ing. Although she was heavily into books, she belonged to
a model United Nations Club where each high school in the
area that participated was a different country. Proposals were
drawn up by each high school/country, then submitted for
voting. If a proposal was accepted, it was passed along to
the real United Nations. Besides this, Allyson taught fourth
grade Sunday School.

Things changed just a bit when she came to college. Her
freshman year, Allyson joined the Society of Women
Engineers, looking for a club involved with engineering. It
has since become a large part of her life here at school, for
not only has SWE taught her much of what she knows about
professional engineering, but it was also the organization
through which she met her closest friends. SWE is an
organization devoted to helping all engineers learn what it
is like to be a professional. By holding seminars on how to
write resumes and conduct interviews, SWE performs a great
service for all engineering students.

11

Allyson Lichtenfels

After being involved for a year in SWE, Allyson thought
it was time for her to make a bigger contribution to the
organization, and so she ran for assistant treasurer. The
following year she automatically became treasurer, where
she was able to write a budget better than most politicans.
Presently, she's doing an excellent job as vice president; a
job she takes quite seriously. In this position she's been able
to open communications between committees and the of-
ficers, and because of the efforts of her and others like her,
the Society is rapidly growing.

Being extremely active, Allyson didn't stop with SWE.
She's been involved with Engineer's Week throughout col-
lege, but especially last year when she headed the Civil
Department. As a sophomore, she helped build the tower
for a float entitled, ’Came|ot’s Castle.’ As a junior, she ran
the whole show with the help of only a handful of people,
but the bonds that were created during that time were worth
the disappointment of not finishing in first place.

Throughout these activities, including intramural sports,
she managed to maintain her academic record as well. She
was accepted into Lambda Sigma, a service honorary, in her
second year, where she attended dances with the School for

"the Blind and baked cookies with the handicapped. Later she

was invited to join two scholastic honoraries based solely
upon her QPA: Phi Eta Sigma and Chi Epsilon. The latter is
strictly for civil engineers. The only organization left for her
to join was the American Society of Civil Engineers, which
she did as soon as,she entered the department.

With all her activities, Allyson has made herself a home
at the University of Pittsburgh. Benedum Hall and Pitt's
Engineering School have become more than just a building
at the top of a bothersome hill. ”You have to sacrifice and
really give a lot to be a part of what college is all about, but
in the end you receive much more than you could ever give.”

Y USING the conservation-
of-mass equation, one can
describe the dispersion of gaseous
molecules in the atmosphere. The
equation includes terms for advec-
tion, diffusion, sources and sinks.
Advection is the transport of air
parcels by the mean wind; diffusion
is due mainly to turbulent mixing.
But the equation is useful only if we
have information about the wind
and temperature ﬁelds in the atmo-
sphere. Speciﬁcally, our ability to
predict vehicular exhaust concen-
trations near a road depends on
knowledge of the effects of vehicles
on these ﬁelds.

WIND

where Ui is the mean wind velocity
and Kij is the eddy diffusivity ten-
sor. This equation applies when the
length scale of mixing is small
compared to that of the variation of
the mean concentration. Near a
road, this condition is met if the
averaging time for the concentra-
tion and wind velocity is much
longer than the time interval of ve-
hicular passage. For a straight
roadway, a long averaging time
allows one to assume spatial uni-
formity in the direction parallel to
the road, and to ignore the spatial
derivatives in that direction.

The input information for K,-
and the mean crossroad and verti-
cal wind components near a road-
way became available as a result of
a large-scale experiment con-
ducted by the General Motors
Research Laboratories. The ex-
periment has provided an under-
standing of the inﬂuence of moving
vehicles on mechanical turbulence
and buoyancy near a roadway. Dr.
David Chock was responsible for
the design of the experiment and
the analysis of the data. The experi-
ment, which duplicated a heavily
traveled, level roadway, was con-
ducted under meterological condi-
tions minimizing dispersion.

Moving vehicles affect the
mean Crossroad and vertical wind
components in the following ways.
Vehicles act as an obstacle to the
mean wind, causing it to slow and
move upward as it approaches the
vehicles and downward as it leaves
the road. In addition, vehicles re-
lease heat, which causes a net up-
ward motion. It was established
that the increase in the mean verti-
cal wind component due to the ex-
haust heat was (B/U),"-’ where U is
the Crossroad wind component.

The buoyancy ﬂux, B, is propor-
tional to the heat emission rate of
the vehicles.

Moving vehicles also en-
hance both turbulence intensity
and mixing. To determine how this
modiﬁes the eddy diffusivity ten-
sor, Ki}; Dr. Chock invoked a "sec-
ond-order closure" assumption,
which relates eddy diffusivity to
Reynolds stresses and the gra-
dients of mean wind velocity and
mean temperature. Eddy diffusiv-
ity was assumed to be the sum of
ambient and traffic contributions.
To determine the traffic contribu-
tion, the length scale of the traffic-
induced turbulence was assumed
to be comparable to vehicle
height—1.5 m.

‘ lSING THE vast data base

compiled during the experi-
ment, Dr. Chock was able to spec-
ify Kij and the mean crossroad and
vertical wind components, and
solve the equation numerically. To
test the model, half-hour measure-
ments of a tracer gas were used to
map out experimentally the ex-
haust dispersion under various me-
teorological conditions. The case
where the wind speed is low and the
wind direction is nearly perpendic-
ular to the roadway is represented
by the black lines in Figure 1. Both
the model and the experiment show
the same dispersion pattern. The
peak concentration is on the down-
wind roadside.

When the wind is nearly par-
allel to the road, the situation is
much more complicated. Figure 2
shows that when the wind and
traffic flow on the upwind lanes op-
pose each other, a high shear re-
gion occurs immediately upwind of

the first trafﬁc lane. When the wind

and traffic are in the same direc-
tion, the high shear region occurs
in the median of the road. In these

high shear regions, large eddies are

generated and turbulent mixing is

intense. The gray lines in Figure 1

show a comparison of the model's

predictions with the tracer data for

the case illustrated by Figure 2.
Notice that the peak concentration

can actually occur on the upwind

roadside, due to the exhaust trans-
port by these large eddies. Dr.
Chocks model is the ﬁrst to predict

this occurrence.

Under all combinations of
wind speeds and directions, the
predictions based on the model
compare favorably with the mea-
sured tracer concentrations. There
is little systematic bias with respect
to wind direction.

"In light of this new model,
exhaust dispersion near a roadway
can now be predicted with reliabil-
ity,” -says Dr. Chock. "This is of
importance for environmentally
sound road planning, and opens the
door to the investigation of disper-
sion on city streets, where the pres-
ence of tall structures introduces
even further complexity."

MARK OF EXCELLENCE

    

Ron Smith

Electrical Engineering
by Steve F rezza

”Expose yourself to many types of people. Pure
knowledge won't do you any good if you can't work with
people.”

That's what Ron Smith, 19, a sophomore electrical
engineer advises engineering students to do. He has certainly
followed his own advice.

Ron came to Pitt from Penn Hills School, graduating in
the top fifth of the '81 class. After being a trombone player
in the Penn Hills band, Ron naturally joined the Pitt Band.
He credits his band experience with helping him adjust to
college life. By the time his freshman classes started, Ron
already knew at least a hundred people, including many up-
per classmen. This, he says, helped him quite a bit, and he
would recommend it to any new student. Even now, despite
the heavy workload of an undergraduate electrical engineer,
he feels that most of the time that he spends with the band
is time well spent.

Ron Smith

Ron also works as a lab assistant in Pitt's nuclear physics
laboratory, which is a joint effort between the University of
Pittsburgh and Westinghouse. As part of his duties, Ron gets
to work with a Van de Graaff accelerator, which he's found
very interesting.

”It’s a great learning experience,” Ron commented. ’’It
puts a demand on me mentally.” He enjoys the challenge
that his work provides. ”The things that we learn in the
classroom are real in the lab,” he added. This is something
he finds very important, because it gives him practical feel-

14

mg for what he's learning as an undergraduate.

This past summer, Ron worked for the University
maintenance crew. He got the job through work—study, and
he really felt that he learned a lot fromiit. ”You get a better
idea of what goes on outside the classroom after seeing what
all is involved in the offices. You also get to meet a lot of
important people.” Ron commented on the amount of
money that was spent repairing the damage that vandals do
to university property. He blames some of our tuiton hikes
on student destruction.

When asked about his present experiences here at Pitt,
Ron was very positive. He admitted that being an electrical
engineering student is not very easy, but he enjoys his depart-
ment. He said that the EE students and professors were in-
telligent, and that almost all of them were willing to put out
their time for the students. ’’I like electrical engineering
because of the calibre of the people. It's challenging, and
you have to put a lot of time into it, but I enjoy it.”

Ron found the transition from high school to college to
be a big jump, especially in the level of mathematics en-
countered and the amount of time required for studying.
Despite these obstacles, Ron has done rather well, and he
thinks that because of his department, and his band ex-
perience, he’s been able to find help when he's needed it.

Ron intends to go to graduate school, at least at this point
in his academic career. After that, he's not sure. He does want
to do research work, perhaps for a big company. Ron's cer-
tainly bn the right path, and with his enthusiasm and good
learning experiences, he should be able to choose whatever
path he wants.

Jerry Zaleski

Industrial Engineering

by Joe Samosky

Pitt's engineering curriculum is perhaps the university's
most challenging and demanding undergraduate program.
An even more difficult task for an engineering student is to
combine this academic program with athletic competition.
This is a challenge which Jerry Zaleski greets with enthusiasm
and dedication. Jerry is a senior in Pitt's Industrial Engineer-
ing Department, and is a co—captain of Pitt's swim team. He
is now participating in his fourth year of competitive swim-
ming at the University of Pittsburgh.

Jerry has lived in the Fox Chapel area of Pittsburgh all
his life. He attended Fox Chapel High School where he also
dedicated much time to competitive swimming. His deci-
sion to enroll in Pitt's engineering school was based on
several factors. Jerry explains, ’’I had one main goal in high
school, a swimming scholarship. That's one of the few
rewards that swimmers look forward to besides the self-
satisfaction and sense of teamwork that comes from com-
petition. I was really impressed with the reputation of Pitt's
Industrial Engineering Department. I also knew Fred Lewis,
the coach of Pitt's swim team and wanted very much to be
a part of that team. I was offered a scholarship and finally
chose Pitt over Penn State.”

Jerry Zaleski

Competing in the 50, I00, and 200 yard freestyle events, I

Jerry has achieved a remarkable record of success. He has
consistently been ranked in the top 10 swimmers in his divi-
sion. In addition, he has been a member of relay teams which
have qualified for the national championships. Jerry has also
twice qualified for the National Collegate Athletic Associa-
tion finals. This is one of the highest distinctions a college
swimmer can achieve.

Such accomplishments are the product of much work
and discipline. Jerry relates his routine on a typical school
day. "We work out three days a week. Generally I'm up
about six o'clock, work out in the pool, lift weights, eat
breakfast and then spend the day in classes. I have practice
again at three in the afternoon, and then after supper I devote
time to my school work. We're working hard but the guys
on the team really get along well. We laugh about it and
have a great time.” Besides studying engineering and swim-
ming competitively, Jerry also spends twelve hours a week
lifeguarding at the Trees Hall pool. It might seem that a
schedule such as Jerry's would leave little room for social
life but Jerry explains that this is not true. "|t’s really all a
matter of priorities. If you go into engineering, I think it's
a wise decision, but you've got to be prepared to work. If
you can discipline yourself to work during the week, you
can have time of your own on the weekends.”

Jerry has done well academically as well, maintaining
a 3.0 departmental grade point average. He is currently in
the process of interviewing for a job, a process about which
Jerry feels very open minded. His longer range plans include
possibly returning to school to earn a master's degree in
business administration. Jerry is very interested in the
business aspect of engineering and a position in marketing
or sales holds special interest for him.

As far as his decision to attend Pitt is concerned, Jerry
has no second thoughts. ”I feel definitely I made the right
choice. I've done well academically, improved my swim-
ming and have had a great time.” Jerry has also enjoyed liv-
ing in the engineering unit in tower A during his entire stay
at Pitt. ’’I got along well there. The guys on my floor were
really respectful of each other, especially when I was going
to bed early when I had practice the next day.”

15

Looking toward the spring swimming season, Jerry has
several goals. ”My main goal is to qualify for the NCAA’s
as an individual. I'd also hope to win an event individually
at Eastern's and I'd like to have a lot of my teammates going
with me to NCAA’s." Looking back, Jerry finds his years at
Pitt to have been both challenging and very rewarding. ’’I
don't think I would change anything. Again, a lot boils down
to priorities. I am here to be a student first, and athletics is
something additional. My goals have been to graduate on
time, to get good grades and to swim well. I can't see doing
anything halfway. I think I can look back at the past four years
and say they have been the best four years of my life.’’ With
Jerry's modest manner, self—discipline and sense of determina-
tion, it is likely the coming years will be equally rewarding.

Amy Solomon

Mechanical Engineering
by LuAnne Schmidt

Exemplifying the ability to coordinate class work and ex-
tracurricular activities as a commuter is Amy Lynn Solomon,
a senior in the Mechanical Engineering Department. Amy,
who resides in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania, said that her deci-
sion to attend the University of Pittsburgh was based on its
proximity to her home, the reputation of Pitt's Engineering
School, and her familiarity with Pitt as a result of family ties
with the University. Amy's father and all three of her sisters
have also attended Pitt, and Amy said that it has been "nice
to be able to share the college experience with my family.”

Amy's decision to study engineering was prompted by
her enjoyment of math and physics in high school; her choice
of the mechanical Engineering department was due to the
wide scope of applications of mechanical engineering and
her desire to gain a broadly based engineering education.
Amy feels that she has made the right decisions.

Certainly she has done well with the curriculum she has
chosen. Amy is ranked well into the top fifth of her class.
Her academic performance has qualified her for member-
ship in two honoraries: Phi Eta Sigma for her achievements
as a freshmen and Tau Beta Pi for her achievements as an
engineering student.

Amy's activities within the engineering school are not
limited to classes, however. Amy also serves as vice-president
of the mechanical engineering seminar, and as such she helps

the president to coordinate speakers for each seminar. Amy
has also been active in Engineers’ Week activities. As a junior
she co-chaired her department's parade committee. With a
theme of ”The Roman Empire,” the committee coordinated
a lounging Caesar and Cleopatra, a working fountain, and
a trumpet trio with many toga-clad slaves who pulled the
float by ropes.

Although these activities would be enough to keep most
people busy, Amy has not limited herself to engineering-
oriented activities. Amy has taken advantage of the wide-
range of organizations which exist on a large university cam-
pus by keeping up her musical abilities as a member of Pitt's
marching band. Amy joined the band as a freshman
clarinetist, and has now been in the band for four years. Dur-
ing her junior and senior marching seasons, Amy was
selected to serve as a clarinet section leader.

Being in the band requires a time commitment of two
to three hours of practice, three evenings a week, in addi-
tion to practice on Saturday mornings before football games.
As a section leader Amy is required to be at every practice
and performance fifteen minutes early to attend a section
leader meeting where she is informed of plans for the day.
She then transmits this information to the members of her
section. Amy is also responsible for orienting freshman band
members and for running basic marching drill with the
clarinet section. The band has not been all work, though.
As a member of Pitt's band, Amy has travelled to New York
City, Philadelphia, Daytona Beach, New Orleans, and
Tennessee.

Since her sophomore year, Amy has also been a member
of Omicron Pi Alpha, the band sorority. Last year she held
the position of historian. The sorority’s motto is ”harmonious
sisterhood through service to the band,” and this is carried
out by the sorority’s sponsorship of post-half—time
refreshments, parties, the band banquet, and receptions for
visiting bands.

Amy feels that marching with the band has helped her
to establish a sense of priorities and to maximize her time.
As a commuter band member, Amy doesn't get home until
ten o'clock three evenings a week, so it is necessary for her
to budget her time efficiently in order to get all of her school
work done.

Amy's theory for making it through the engineering cur-
riculum is to ”keep up.” In order to coordinate extra-
curricular activities with academics one must anticipate work
with enthusiasm, not with dread. Amy says simply, ”Think
of it as a challenge.”

Metallurgical —— Materials Engineering

by Joe Seman

Just about everyone in the Metallurgical and Materials
Engineering Department knows Tony Freda, but then, just
about everyone in the MME department knows everyone else
anyway, being that it is one of the smallest engineering
departments here at Pitt.

Tony Freda

Tony is a junior in the MME department and an officer
of the MME class. When not at school he lives in Bradford,
PA, ”five minutes from the nearest New York bar,” as Tony
likes to put it. He graduated from Bradford High. ”A lot of
people from my high school said I'd never make it in
engineering, that I'd fail out,” commented Tony, ”My grades
weren't real high then, but I'm doing okay here.” Even
though others didn't take Tony for an engineer, he never had
any doubt. ”It was the only thing that I could see myself do-
ing at college,” stated Tony. The fact that both his father and
brother are metallurgical engineers may well have had some-
thing to do with his decision.

Aside from ”doing okay” (he's a ”B” student) here at
Pitt, Tony is involved in many activities both in and out of
school. He is a member of the Foundary Education Founda-
tion and is very active in the casting club, which gives the
students the chance to work with metals on the macroscopic
scale, instead of analysing small samples microscopically.
”I really like the club, and it has taught me a lot about
metals,” commented Tony, ”We make a variety of things,
some of which are just for fun like the MME beer tankards
we cast out of aluminum.” He is also a joint member of the
American Society for Metals and the American Institute of
Metallurgical Engineers. He is a teaching assistant in the
undergraduate metallography labs, which eats up a big chunk
of his time. Out of school tony fishes and hunts, and enjoys
competition shooting. Most of his free time is occupied by
his favorite diversion, a Pro Camaro called ”Chocolate
Thunder.” He is driver and crew chief for the team and has
been active in professional drag racing for the past three
years. ”I’d really like to drive professionally after I graduate
and my metallurgical degree will go very nicely with those
plans,” added Tony. ”What I've learned in my classes and
the experience that I've gained in lab makes it a lot easier
to trouble shoot some of the difficulties that I run into with
the car, and I've been able to save money and improve the
car by some good choices of materials,” he stated. ”Also,
if I go on to grad school I will probably go into consulting
work, which would give both the time and the funds to race,”
he added.

Tony has lived on campus for the past three school years,
and is very pleased with both the MME department and the
university in general. ”The (MME) program here is very
good,” mused Tony, ’’It is a more practically oriented pro-
gram and it gives a person the chance to get a lot of hands-
on experience that will be very useful later on.” One of the
reasons that he chose Pitt is the fact that even though the
university has one of the largest MME departments nation
wide, it is still one of the smallest departments in the School
of Engineering. He also chose Pitt because of the locale. ’’I
like living in the city, it gives me the chance to take advan-
tage of a lot of opportunities that I wouldn't have in a more
rural area.”

On graduating Tony is giving serious thought to graduate
school. Opportunities in the MME field are very good,
however, and he is considering going straight into the job
market. ”Even though steel is looking very bad right now,
there is still a very wide range of opportunities for a

metallurgical engineer,” stated Tony, ”But what I'd really .

like to do is race professionally.”

Kim Uram
Mining Engineering

by Mark M cKrell

There are several misconceptions concerning the min-
ing engineers at Pitt. Contrary to popular opinion, they par-
ticipate in engineer's week to win as well as to have fun.
In addition, mining engineers are not exclusively burly men
with hirsute arms. There are, in fact, a significant percentage
of females enrolled in the mining department. A notable ex-
ample is senior Kim Uram. Kim is a graduate of Monessen
High School in Monessen, Pennsylvania. Her decision to
come to Pitt was based largely on its close proximity to her
home, Monessen being about forty-five minutes from Pitt's
campus. Kim feels this is a comfortable distance. She is close
enough to go home when she chooses to but still benefits
from an away from home college experience.

Kim decided to enroll in the mining engineering depart-
ment as a freshman at Pitt. She intended to become a
mechanical engineer, but a field trip to an underground mine
got her interested in mining. She has participated in the co-
op program offered by the mining department for five terms
(including the present one). The co—op program entails three
to five semesters of work during the student's four years.
Every other semester is spent working in some form of min-
ing under this program. Kim cites this continual change bet—
ween classwork and field work as a difficult adjustment for
some students to make. Another drawback for some par-
ticipants is the necessity of taking some courses which are
only offered in the summer. The co-op program has definite
advantages, however. For instance, Kim has worked as a
laborer and as an assistant engineer. She feels this has given
her invaluable experience in getting a feel of what really
works in an underground environment. One gets comfortable
with the machinery used in mining. Kim cites two other im-
portant advantage to the co—op program. First of all, the job

17

    

Kim Uram

opportunities are enhanced for students with practical ex-
perience. A large percentage of co-op students are hired by
the same company they worked for while in school. Second-
ly, the money is excellent. A student can pay for a whole
year of schooling with one semester of work. Students can
earn close to $7000 a semester if they are making union
wages.

Kim feels that a mining engineering degree provides
unique job opportunities. It meets several areas of interest
which other engineering disciplines can not. Mining
engineers can work in design at desk jobs. They can work
as field engineers making designs work in practical situations.
They can also work in management jobs that don't require
specific engineering techniques.

The curriculum for mining engineers is also unique. Kim
explains that her courses require common sense. One does
not make exact calculations from collected data. Assump-
tions such as the amount of swelling during the mining pro-
cess must be taken into consideration. Another difference
in the curriculum is its wide variety. Miners take civil and
mechanical courses. Power courses similar to electrical
engineering courses are also taken. Kim considers her classes
to be excellent in providing practical applications, and
preparation for her future job. Kim finds her studies challeng-
ing but not overbearing. She studies about four hours a night
but can occasionally make time for other activities. On the
weekends, however, there is plenty of time to pursue per-
sonal interests.

Kim finds the size of the mining department to be a big
advantage. As the smallest department at Pitt, the miners
know everyone in their department by name and become
fairly close as a group. They are very active in intramural
sports. A big activity for the miners is Engineer's Week. In

‘the competition with other departments, the miners are well

known for showing lots of enthusiasm and good sportsman-
ship. Kim says that her department is tired of an undeserved
reputation for having fun but never winning. They do well
in many areas of competition and would like to be recog-
nized for it. But they do have a lot of fun in this as well as
their other activities. Kim feels the miners have a more laid
back, ”do your best,” less competitive attitude toward grades
than do the other departments. She feels this is another
special advantage that she could only experience in the min-
ing department.

It's impossible and I forbid it."

I thought about it, silently staring at the armored figure
across the table from me. The man was my father.

It was a strange sequence of events that had led up this
scene; the two of us, sitting at a small oaken table in a dimly
littent: He was Lord Falshem, Bannerette of Mendall, Baron
of the northern realm, and I was Thomas Falshem, his first
son—and—heir. We were trying to decide our strategy for the
impending battle.

We were camped outside of a large, fortified manor
house that had recently been taken by the enemy. We sat
outside the walls, while a relieving army was forming around
us. My opinion was that we should end this war as soon as
we could by any means at our disposal. My father felt that
we should follow the customary rules of warfare and meet
the enemy on the fields.

But we had been invaded; the knight of this manor had
surrendered to a superior enemy, only to be slaughtered
along with his family and vassals under a flag of truce. Kaleb
had inflamed the northern nomads to war, and he was the
one who had had all of them murdered. As far as I was con-
cerned, there were no more rules left to this game. That had
been one of the points I had been trying in vain to get across
to my father.

My idea was to surprise them by storming the castle at
night, while holding their field army at bay. "Things aren't
done that way” was all he had said. He still maintained that
the only way to win this war was to form two lines and
charge.

"Why not?” I tried to ask calmly.

''It just won't work. We are not strong enough, nor do
we have the necessary equipment.”

"What do you think they're going to do, meet us on the
field of honor? What can they hope to achieve by that?-
They’ll avoid an open engagement until they are strong
enough to win. Even ifwe do win the field from them tomor-
row, that madman will still be leading his crusade. The only
difference between today and tomorrow will be the number
of gravesf"

”Silence! You are a fool to think that way.” He folded
the papers that were my plans, thrusting them in my direc-
tion. As I took them, I noted that he wouldn't meet my gaze.
"My decision is final. We will meet them in the field; you've
stated your case, and I think you're wrong." He paused to
look up at me. "Now my hot-headed son, you have your
orders.” He stood up slowly, and I did likewise. "Get your
troops ready, and get some rest." He extended his hand,
which I took. When I left, his hand was still shaking.

Walking out into the cool night air, I thought about the
impending dawn. I dreaded the thought of the clash that
would occur on these quiet fields, firmly believing it to be
the wrong move to make. "My idea could work," I thought
to myself. I knew it sounded like lunacy — scaling the walls
at night, but it was just as insane to believe that my father's
traditional plans would end this war. They wouldn't. As long

19

as their new war leader, Kaleb, was in power, this war would
go on. With him gone, there would be no one to unite the
six tribes of nomads who had joined his insane crusade. If
he was gone, they would once again be a disunited set of
tribes, with no reason to be at war.

Kaleb had taken his band and incited the other nomads
to march south and exterminate the "Locusts", as we were
so affectionately called. he had started by taking this manor
house, and using it as the focal point of his gathering. If he
could be stopped now, the other tribesmen would probably
be open to reason.

I had heard about Kaleb before through some of the
traders who normally dealt with the tribes. He wanted to
become their king, by uniting the tribes. He was using our
frontier as his tool, killing all who got in his way —— northern
or southern. His personal quest for glory had ruined the once-
peaceful relations that we had had with the tribes, along with
the lives of uncountable hundreds of settlers and soldiers who
had been put to the sword since his ‘crusade’ had begun.
It angered me to think about it.

My stomach turned as my imagination painted what the
fields would look like at dusk tomorrow; I had seen the lit-
tered battlefields before, strewn with the bodies of dead and
dying men and horses. That kind of battle wouldn't end the
crusade: Ka|eb’s removal would. If one must die, why make
it in such a pointless gesture? I felt disheartened, watching
some of the men clean their weapons by the dim firelight.
The light cast uncanny, flickering shadows on the cool
ground, becoming lost in the darkness.

"M'|ord, there's someone who wishes to speak to you."
I had forgotten about the servant who always followed me
about

”Wh0 is it?”

"Crenshaw, m’lord.”

"Very well."

Crenshaw was an interesting character. He always took
up any personal challenge, but when it came to politics he
would sit right in the middle of the fence. He was an honest
fellow, but I do not trust anyone who is always indecisive.
Earlier, I had explained my plans to a group of knights, mostly
the younger ones who still might have had open minds. Cren-
shaw was considered a leader among them.

"He refused me, you know."

"M’|ord . . .” Crenshaw looked at my face through the
gloom and started again. "Thomas, I talked it over with the
others, and we came to a decision . . ." His pause left me
unprepared for what he said next. "We think you are right.
At least a few of us do. We talked it over, and once we found
Locke and explained it to him, he settled the matter. He has
a plan that we think could work. He did his training here,
so he knows every in and out of that wall. He also wants
revenge.”

I had always thought of James Locke as the quick-
tempered sort.

"After hearing his talk about his knowledge of the walls,
it just might be possible."

"Tell Locke to meet me in my tent. There isn't a mo-
ment to lose.'’ When my voice trailed off, he disappeared
into the darkness.

As I walked back to my tent, I felt determined to suc-
ceed. But why? I wondered. What encouraged me to believe
that we could complete this impossible task? I didn't believe
it to be impossible; nothing is if you put your mind to it. I
waited impatiently for Locke in the darkened interior of my
tent.

"M’lord, Locke is here,” my servant quietly announced.
As James Locke entered, I thought about how his rage was
often known to overcome his reason. After what Crenshaw
had said, some scheme born of rage was what I expected
from him.

"Falshem, I've drawn up a rough sketch of the manor
house.” He handed me a paper showing theoutlines of the
outer wall, the towers, the main house, gates, and a set of
dashed lines that ran outside of the outer ringwall. Pointing
to dashed lines on the paper, he said "Those are the counter-
mines we dug." Countermines are mines that are dug
beneath the walls to be used to destroy enemy mineshafts
before they reached the walls. Incendiaries could be placed
there, creating a breech in the wall, if you allowed the enemy
to get that far. But for us, if we could find one of those
Countermines, we would have a way in: not over the walls,
not through them, but under them.”

"Here," he said pointing, "is the best place to enter. This
was the first one that we dug, and was started before the walls
had been finished. It reaches right to the foundations of the
main house. The rest are connected to the towers. At this
point, a hold could be dug," he pointed to a spot near our
seige wall, "and with a little luck, we could be inside the
main house before sunrise. If we can get into and out of the
tunnel without being spotted, we'll catch the damn bastards
sleeping.” Until that moment he had had a calm authority
in his voice, much to my surprise.

"You realize that we cannot be detected by either side.”
I ran through his plan in my mind. Why wouldn't it work?
Locke was still looking at me, waiting for some response,
or, like a military man, orders.

"We don't have to do this, you know.”

He paused again, looking me in the eye. "Yes we do,"
he said. He was obviously trying to remain calm.

"We must move quickly, then. Can you get volunteers?"
He nodded. Get Crenshaw and the others to try, too. We'll
need about sixty men, aside from the few of us. Get any
dependable men you can.

"I want you to take charge of finding that tunnel. Figure
out where you should dig, and spread the dirt around. If
anyone asks, tell them that you're digging graves or
something, Just don't cause a fuss.”

"What about . . ." He interjected.

"My father? Don't worry, I'll keep him occupied. I'll sit
in on his planning for our field engagement, which if
everything works out, there won't be. Find me when things
are ready. He shouldn't know what's going on until our stan-
dard is once again on top of the house."

As he turned to leave, I realized that a cool tone of
leadership had entered my voice. I stopped him, saying, "By
the way, how many of 'us’ are there? Crenshaw didn't tell
me."

"Five, aside from you and I." He turned and left the tent.

A while later I checked with Locke to see how the
preparations were going. Through the blackness, I could see
figures moving about, putting dirt here and there, while a
few stood aside holding torches. Locke came up behind me
while I was watching them.

''I could get only thirty-two men. Crenshaw and the
others managed eight among them. They're all good ones,
but we'll be a bit short—handed if it comes to a real fight. They
all want Kaleb as badly as we do, though.” I thought to myself
how if things went badly, we wouldn't have enough men
to hold the house.

"We can do it," I finally said. "It's the only way.” With
that, I left him to his ‘grave details’ and went to find my father.
"You know where to find me,” I said, parting.

I found Lord Falshem still stooped over the map in his
tent. The other senior commanders were there, as I had
expected.

"Thomas, hello. Have a seat," my father instructed me.
I did so, taking one of the empty seats around his table.

As I watched and listened to them develop their battle’

plan, I kept wondering to myself how they could ﬁght without
any hope of achieving anything. They were at least as in-
telligent as I — couldn't they see what would continue to
happen if we didn't deal with the problem directly?

"Thomas, what do you think about placing the cavalry
on the flanks?" I answered with a rather standard response,
one I knew they would agree with. I sat there in silence, mak-
ing my own strategies. The night wore on.

I became very nervous after a while, sitting here among
his counsel of war, waiting. I had my entire plan worked out
in my head: If we got through the tunnel without incident,
then we would enter the main house, and hole up for a while;
we'd catch our bearings, and then take the house guards by
surpise, capturing Kaleb and them in the process. Once the
house was ours, we could get more troops in, and with our
troops both inside and outside the walls, they would sur-
render. Without a power-hungry fanatic at their head, they'd
sue for peace.

The other men at the table continued to hypothesize
about the battle, presenting plans, considering them, only
to reject them for another. I wasn't paying any particular at-
tention to them, but since I did on occasion throw in a word
or two, no one seemed to care. After a while, I knew
something had to have gone wrong outside. Where were
they? I had figured that it would take them about two hours
or so, but their two hours were nearing to four. I knew I was
becoming visibly worried, so to avoid any questions, I made
my excuses and left. On my way out of the tent I almost bowl-
ed Locke’s messenger over.

”What’s happening?” I demanded.

”M’lord, Sir Locke sent me to find you, sir.”

”And?”

”He told me to tell you that the tunnel is finished,
m’lord.”

We took a brisk pace towards the site where Locke's men
had been digging. Through the wavering shadows of men
preparing for combat I saw two holes in the ground. They'd
missed the first time. I felt like smiling.

As I drew near, I heard my name whispered about. Then
forty-five dirt—encrusted men snapped to attention. Locke and
Crenshaw walked up to me. Even they were covered. Cren-
shaw looked like he had something to say, but it was Locke
who spoke.

”We had some trouble, but we've found the mine.” He
pointed to one of the the two holes. ”The men are ready
now.”

I motioned for everyone to gather around us. They all
looked tired, but there was also a very determined look to
them. I glanced about at them, taking notice of the wild—eyed
youths that were mixed in with the veterans. Their eyes
reminded me too much of my 25-year-old self. It made me
wonder if we would live to see the coming sunrise.

”You have all heard what we plan to do. Anyone who
thinks we're crazy fools can leave now.” I paused to watch
their reaction. The ranks didn't waver, but Crenshaw and
some of his friends looked away. ”I want him alive. If we

can keep things quiet, we'll get out of this with our noses
clean. We haven't much time, but with courage, determina-
tion, and the help of God, we will do what must be done.”
I wasn't nearly as confident as I sounded. ”Keep this in mind:
”We’re going into the lion's den, so let's not anger the lions
unnecessarily. Kill only if it's absolutely necessary.” I mo-
tioned for a torch.

When I had it in my hand, I walked towards the freshly-
dug entrance to the tunnel. In the wavering torchlight, I felt
like I was peering into my own grave. Was it impossible?
I wondered if my father was right, if I was leading these men
to their graves.

But the wheels were in motion, and for me I knew there
was no turning back. ’’I want him alive,” I said. I then
descended down the makeshift ladder, followed by Locke
and the other silent figures.

As we walked down the long, narrow corridor, I started
to whisper my plans. I was too scared to care who was listen-
ing. We wound our way through what must’ve been at least
two-hund red yards of passageway before we reached a small
door in the middle of a stone wall: the foundations to the
main house. It was deathly quiet.

My heart raced as I turned back to look at the shuffling
fiugres. Everyone was tense, and through the shadows I saw
Crenshw’s helm winding through the maze of men in his
way toward the door against which I stood. Locke's and my
own gazes followed him, but he did not look up. When he
reached the door, he examined it closely. The tunnel became
silent as the torchsmoke became stilfing.

Turning, he said, ”You are all fools!” He gave me a
disgusted look and pushed his way back through the tun-
nel. I watched four other figures following his torch down
the corridor. Like Crenshaw, they all wore the mail and helm
of knights.

”So I am crazy,” I mumbled. I passed my torch to Locke,
noting the frightened stare beneath his bacinette. I drew my
sword and threw my full weight against the door.

Fortunately it gave, and I stumbled into a narrow, unlit
hallway, save for torchlight coming through the narrow door-
way. I had guessed right. They hadn't found out about the
countermines.

We acted fast. As I unslung my shield off of my back,
I heard Locke step in behind me, followed by the others. He
pointed down the hall, and we followed. He led the quiet
single-file of men up an equally narrow staircase, stopping
as we reached a main hallway.

Just as I turned to face my intrepid little army, Locke and
one of the men lunged past me, brandishing their weapons.
In the dim light, I turned to see a very surprised tribesman
succumb to the broadsides of two swords. He was probably
the man who was upposed to guard the lower floors. We
stashed the unconscious figure in a dark corner.

I decided then that we'd better not tempt fate by stop-
ping. ”Let’s go to it before the alarm is given.” I stepped for-
ward, into the hallway. Looking back again at the dirty, sweat-
streaked faces, I simply nodded, and headed off down the
dark corridor. Behind me, I heard the sounds of weapons
being drawn, and men moving cautiously.

I stopped at the inner door which opened into the main
chamber of the house. One of the large, iron-bound doors
stood partially open, allowing the light from within to escape
into the now crowded antechamber. In our ranks, my eye
caught a spindly young man in light mail nervously clutching
a heavy crossbow. The tense fear he felt was mutual.

I motioned to the door, and we all broke into a run, fling-
ing open the two doors in front of us. We fell upon a very
surprised guard shift, surrounding them quickly. We herded
them into a closet and locked them in.

”Locke, bolt the door behind us, and hold it for as long
as you can. I'm going to get Kaleb.” He called out some
names, and immediately shut the heavy doors. Behind them
we could hear the sounds of running feet and shouting. The
alarm was out.

I knew that our retreat would be blocked once that door
was shut, but we needed to keep the masses outside. I prayed
that we were shutting more tribesmen outside of those heavy
doors than we were shutting in. We were in a bad situation.
The alarm was out, and we hadn't consolidated our posi-
tion in the house yet. If it came to a fight now, we would
not only be outnumbered, but disorganized.

As my party ascended the stairs, I saw a group of guards
heading towards Locke's unprepared men by the doors.
Before I could react, four of the archers in my group let loose
into their ranks. The remaining tribesmen dove for cover.
At least Locke's men wouldn't be surprised.

”Keep them pinned down!” I yelled, motioning to the
archers. Turning, I led the rest of my party to the second floor.

As I entered the landing, I heard a cry from behind me.
I dodged just in time to be missed by a guard’s slashing
halberd. The guard turned to face me, and was bowled over
from the charge of the man behind me. We clouted him un-
conscious and continued on.

For the next ten minutes or so, my party ran through the
upper floors of the house, rounding up any combatants that
we met. After looking at the men that we locked up, I no-
ticed that we’d caught most of Ka|eb’s personal guard litteraly
with their pants down, but not the tyrant himself. I instructed
some men to search the roof, and secure the rest of the house,
while I led another party back downstairs. As we reached
the second—f|oor landing again, I could distinctly hear the
sound of steel-on-steel. I wish I could forget the scene which
presented itself as we merged onto the landing.

Locke and the remainder of his men had constructed a
barricade of furniture at the base of the steps, crouching to
avoid the arrows that were being loosed at them. The floor
around them, and indeed what I could see of the darkened
room seemed to be covered with the dead and wounded.
A rush of tribesmen had just been forced off of the barricade,
and the archers were taking shots at anyone not under cover.
We were now the ones with our pants down. I tried to con-
trol the hate that welled up inside of me. I had to do
something. I

Turning to the men behind me, I said, ”Quick, build a
heavy barricade at the top of the stariway!” I turned and
dashed down the cluttered stairway to join Locke. By the
time I had reached the cover of the table behind which he
was crouching, two arrows had narrowly missed me, and
one had glanced off of my shield.

22

”We’re too exposed down here!” I yelled.
The bitterness in his voice was all too clear. ”Don’t you

!ll

think I know that? Not all of those dead are Ka|eb’s men
Before I had time to tell him what I had in mind, our atten-
tions were called to a knot of nomad warriors who were
preparing to charge our little redoubt. The dozen-or-so of
us braced ourselves.

The force of their rush pushed us off of our little wall,
but our ferocity (or desperation) routed them back. One of
our men took an arrow in the chest as we sought cover under
the remnants of our wall. One of the men tried to pull him
under cover, but he couldn't; as death whistled through the
air, he was lucky he didn't get hit.

”We’ve got to move.” I glanced up to see only a small
gap remaining at the top of the steps. I motioned to the ar-
chers to take positions behind the new barricade. After they
had moved, I looked around and realized that we would not
be able to take the wounded; angrily I nodded to Locke, say-
ing ”Move it!"

Immediately the lot of us turned and fled up the stairs.
The man in front of me caught an arrow in his back. I grabb-
ed him before he went down, and half carried him to the
landing. Just as I made it to the top, one struck me in my
left thigh, but was stopped by my heavy mail. The force of
the blow caught me off guard, and I went spinning into the
hallway wall. I blacked out.

They must’ve carried me upstairs, because when I came
to, I was in one of the third floor bedrooms, along with a
few other men, all unconscious. Their wounds were all a
bit more grevious than mine. Looking out the window, I felt
the sun shedding its first rays. I saw a small group of
tribesmen heading for the entrance to the house, but I also
noticed that the walls were fully manned. It felt strange to
be surrounded by the enemy, and yet be looking at their
backs. I figured that at minimum, my father would have me
banished for this fiasco. Of course that meant that I'd have
to live long enough to be banished.

I walked out into the hallway, with my head still swim-
ming a bit. I still had my sword, but both my helm and shield
were gone.

”Locke!” I called out.

”Falshem?” I heard from the shadows of the hallway.
Then, ”Thank God.” It wasn't until then that I noticed how
close to me he was.

”What’s the situation?” I asked, leaning against the wall
to avoid the pain that was shooting up my leg.

”Not good.” His tone dropped. ”They tried rushing us
twice, but we forced them back. Your house cleaners cap-
tured a few more of them on the roof, but no Kaleb.” He
sounded like he had just signed his own death warrant.

I felt that way too. I'd gambled that I'd catch him nap-
ping, and had lost. Fighting back the hopeless feeling that
assaulted my spirit, I said to him, ”We’re not dead yet.” I
made it sound like I believed it. I paused for a moment, and
started again.

”What’s our strength?” The question brought him back
to reality.

”Eight dead, mostly when we retreated from the door.
There's four wounded who may die, and six or seven walk-
ing. Everyone is tired. If they had a really organized rush,
or if they try to scale, I don't think we could hold them off
for very long.”

Ifthey hadn't surprised us at the door, we could’ve pulled
this off without loss. Damn it! Why couldn't it have
worked? I forced myself to turn my thoughts back to the situa-
tion at hand.

”He’s got to be in here somewhere, hiding.”

Locke looked up. ’’If he's here, we'll find the bastard.”
He turned and headed off down the hall. He cast an in-
teresting silhouette against the morning light that was now
pouring through the hallway window. I sat down, resting in
the dark shadows near the wall.

I couldn't stop thinking about how I was responsible for
this escapade. Maybe Crenshaw was right; maybe I was
crazy. Had I led these men to die here like cornered rats?
Despite my inspiring words to Locke, I was just too sore and
too tired to believe them. Was I a fool?

I then heard a chorus of laughter from upstairs, followed
by the dull thud made by a person hitting the floor. I stood
up and headed towards the sound.

”Lord Falshem! Sir Locke! Come look what we've
found!” Besides the two of us, every man not assigned to
a specific post gathered on the landing. There, bathed in the
morning light stood a very dirty yeoman holding a gaudily
dressed nomad by the scruff of the neck. Surrounded by his
now—smiling compatriots he said, ”Look what I found cower-
ing under a tarp in a storeroom.” The tribesman looked up
at me, exposing a rather bruised face. On recognizing my
dirty crest, his eyes widened, and he tried to stand up. It was
our dear friend Kaleb, in person.

The Yeoman pulled him to his feet saying, ”You’re sup-
posed to stand in the presence of noblemen, or didn't you
know that, you grimy worm?” All of our sweat-streaked faces
broke into a tearful laughter. We had our ticket home.

A moment later, one of our men came running up from
the second floor. ”Sir Locke . . .” He then recognized me,

23

saying, ”Excuse me, m’lord . . .” As he took in the scene
in front of him, a curious look came across his face.

”Out with it man!” Locke half laughed, half shouted at
him.

”Lord Falshem . . . There's a nomad chief to see you,
sir. He came under a flag of truce, so we have him under
guard.”

The smile fell from Locke's face.

”Flag of truce? Since when did they honor white flags?”
His laughter had turned into rage. ”They murdered every
man, woman and child who had once lived here under a
flag of truce, and you have him under guard?” It was the
James Locke I knew who was speaking.

”Locke, catch hold of yourself! We're not going to stoop
to use the tactics of barbarians like him!” I pointed to Kaleb.
”If we did, then we would be no better than him.” Locke's
eyes closed. I took him by the arm, saying, ”Let’s go do what
we came here to do.” As we moved down the steps, I thought
about what I would say to this chief of theirs.

On the second floor were two tribesmen, both unarmed.
One was obviously a translator which I deemed from his
dress, and the frightened look in his eyes. They too took note
of the crest I bore and bowed.

”Young Lord Fa|shem.” The translator started. I didn't
let him finish.

”We have Kaleb, and my standard sits atop this roof. As
such, I am the ruler of this house and grounds. You and your
men are trespassing.” I paused as the translator caught up
with me. The chief's eyes widened, and before he could
laugh, I stared him straight in the eye and continued, ”Why
are you here? You have no answer. You know as well as I
do that Kaleb led you here on his own glory hunt, and he
is the only one who will gain from this war.” I paused again
as the translator caught up. ”Not me, nor you, nor any of
the chiefs. You have one decision to make: either you storm
this house now, and go on with this senseless war losing
more brave men in the process, or you can go home in
peace.” I pointed to the window, and the outer wall beyond.
”You don't have much time. Those trumpets will start soon.
Once they do, there will be no turning back.” I waited once
more, praying he would listen.

”Go back to your counsel, and make your decision. We
will not surrender, so your decision is this: Are you warriors
first, or are you leaders? If you are leaders, then you will see
that you have more than just your honor to protect.” I
looked over at Locke and the others, who were now staring
at me as if I were insane. The nomad chief met my deter-
mined gaze, and held it for a while. He murmured something
to the translator who then said,

”You are either a very brave and wise man, young
Falshem, or a fool. We shall see.” The two turned and left.

The sun was shining brightly when the main gate swung
open to let the first party of emissaries leave. I could just im-
agine my father sitting on his horse, engrossed in the final
preparations for battle, only to interrupted by a messenger
babbling something about a ‘peace parley’ from the nomads.
No, maybe I wasn't such a crazy fool after all.

The Skycaper
by M3

The Skycaper is a regular feature of Skyscraper Engineer.
Test your skill at solving this issue's problems, then write your
answers on the entry form below. Members of the Skyscraper
staff and ESC executive officers are ineligible to enter the
Skycaper contest. Only original entry forms will be accepted
(no photocopies please). Complete the remainder of the form
and bring your entry to the Engineering Student Cabinet of-
fice located in Room 125 of Benedum Hall. Be sure to have
an ESC oficer mark the time and date on your entry. The stu-
dent who submits the most correct answers will win a $25
prize. In case of a tie, the award will be given to the person
with the earliest entry. The final date on which entries will
be accepted is Friday, January 7. Good luck, and expect the
unexpected!

(1) Refer to the figure. The five sided polygon has vertices
A, B, C, D, and E. A man from Iraq measures side AB and
finds it to be ”1.2.ush” in length. An engineer from Norway
measures side BC and it is ”532 favn.” A woman from Cuba
measures CD and it is ”12 sides of a besana.” The length
of side DE is found to be ”123 perch,” as measured by a
student in Ireland. A representative from the Skyscraper
Engineer staff measures side EA and records the length as
”945 yards." If this information is given to a woman from
Afghanistan, what should she calculate the perimeter of ABC-
DE to be using ”gereh gazi sha” as units? The answer must
be given to four significant figures.

(2) George has a pair of brown socks, a pair of black socks,
and a pair of blue socks. The brown socks are one size larger
than the blue socks. George wears each of his socks twice
a week and doesn't wear any on Saturday. If there are holes
in his black socks, how many socks does George own?

(3) The numbers below are related in a certain way. Fill the
blank and explain your reasoning.
251, 542, 1262, 2614, _C__, 6842

(4) There are five sim per every two min, twice as many mun
as the square of the number of sun, three mon per every two
sum, one more sum than sim and the same number of sum
as nim. Ifthe number of each of the above items is a positive
integer and the total of the numbers of all of the items is be-
tween forty and fifty inclusive, how many mun are there?

(5) For this problem set the unit ”feet” equal to the unit
”minutes,” then set the unit ”degrees” equal to the unit
”hours.” You are given the date August 17, 1963, the time
is exactly six o'clock A.M., and you add to the time the
latitude, longitude, and elevation of Benedum Hall as given
by George Means Bevier. What is the new date and time,
accurate to the second?

The winner of last issue's twenty—five dollar Skycaper
prize was junior electrical engineer Raymond A. Gurnee.
Raymond solved four of the problems correctly and his
answer to question number four, although not exact, was ac-
curate to four decimal places. Congratulations to Raymond
and to all those people who submitted entries. Ron Kuhn
of Triangle Fraternity also deserves a special mention, hav-
ing solved all questions correctly except for number three.

The solutions to October's Skycaper are as follows:

(1) The length of the screw is three inches. Since the head
is one—quarter inch from top to base, the screw will travel
two and three—quarter inches before the base touches the
wall. The tip will therefore travel a distance of two and three-
quarter inches.

(2) The quickest solution involves a method similar to
Pascal's triangle. Assign a number to each point at which
two lines touch. This number represents the number of possi-
ble ways to reach that point. Starting at point x, one’s are
placed along the top and side. The other numbers are found
by adding the numbers of the corners to the north and east
of the point at which you are looking. Continue in this man-
ner until you reach the corner east of point H. There are
twenty-four possible different paths.

(3) The numbers were arranged in alphabetical order. Any
number falling between ”seven” and ”twenty-one”
alphabetically will fit the pattern.

(4) We used the technique of ”mass points” but other
methods are possible. Consider RS and RT to be levers
pivoted at points D and E respectively. Assign a mass to each
of the points R and S so as to ”balance” that side. Since
RD/DS = 716/959 assign a mass of 959 to point R and a
mass of 716 to S. This places a theoretical mass of 1675 at
point D (716 + 959 = 1675). Do likewise for side RT, but
since RE/ET = 861/137, and there is already a mass of 959
at point R, and 959 = 7 x 137, we assign a mass of 6027
to point T (861 x 7 = 6027). Considering now point F as
a pivot, we have TF/FD = 1675/6027, which is the correct
answer.

(5) All of the girls try to get there by 7:35. Those arriving
after 7:40 will miss the opening of the show.

Sue: At 7:40, her watch indicates 7:47:39, but she thinks
that it is 7:53:30. She has been there for eighteen minutes
and thirty seconds, (7:53:30- 7:35:00 = 0:18:30).

Barb: At 7:40 her clock reads 7:28, and she believes it
is 7:28. She will not arrive for another seven minutes.

Jane: At 7:40, her timepiece reads 7:32, but she thinks
that the time is 7:24. She will not arrive for another eleven
minutes.

Jenny: At 7:40 her timepiece reads 7:32, but she thinks
that the time is 7:24. She will not arrive for another 11
minutes.

Kathy: At 7:40, her watch displays 7:40, but she believes
that it is 7:51. She has been at the concert for sixteen minutes.

Therefore Barb, Jane, and Jenny will miss the opening
of the show.

News from Benedum Hall

by LuAnne Schmidt and Laurie Peach

Skylines is meant to serve our readers by giving advanced
notice of upcoming events, and it is meant to serve the
organizations within the University as a means of publicity.
Any organization which has its events planned two to three
months in advance may submit information concerning those
events for publication to the Engineering Student Cabinet Of-
fice in Room 125, Benedum Hall. Any activities scheduled
for February, March, or April may be submitted for publica-
tion in the February issue by January 10.

ESC Schedules Winter Programs

Omni is coming to the University of Pittsburgh. An Omni
lecture will again this year be hosted by the Engineering Stu-
dent Cabinet. The lecture, which will take place during the
winter term, will be open to the entire University of
Pittsburgh.

The ESC will also sponsor an ice skating party at Schenley
Park. This event, which is to be held in the early part of the
winter term, is for all students of the Engineering School.

The engineering basketball league competition at Trees
Hall will also take place during the winter term. The results
of this competition will be included in the decision of which
department will receive the Engineering Sports Trophy.

Pitt Alumni Host Career Day

Under the direction of Nancy Sue Jeziorski, the Student
Interaction Committee of the Engineering Alumni Associa-
tion will sponsor a ”Career Day.” Students of the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh's Engineering School will be invited to meet
and talk informally with members of the Alumni Association.
The purpose of the event, which is to be held in the early
part of the spring term, is to make available to students a
wide cross section of engineers who are working in many
different fields. Students should be able to gain from the
”Career Day” a knowledge of how companies utilize
employees with engineering degrees and, in turn, how the
employee can make best use of that degree.

SWE Events Planned

For the beginning of 1983, a Career Panel Discussion
is the major event of the Society of Women Engineers.
Representatives of different aspects of professional engineer-
ing will discuss the various career options open to engineer-
ing students upon graduation.

SWE will also sponsor a tour of a local Pittsburgh mine
in February which will be hosted by the Bureau of Mines.

In a tentative planning stage for the second term is a High
School Day. In this program, area high school students would
be paired with SWE members and attend classes with them
for a day.

the facts of life.

There was a time when most
robots earned their livelihoods
in comic books and science
fiction films.

Today, they're spraying,
welding, painting, and process-
ing parts at manufacturing
plants around the world.

Necessity has caused this
amazing leap from fantasy to
factory.

The world wants |ong—|asting,
high quality products, now.

And robots fit perfectly into this
scheme of things: They can

make those products — quickly,
easily and accurately.

What kinds of robots? There
is GE's Allegro,” for one.

It can position a part to within
1/1000th of an inch—or about ‘/4
the thickness of the paper this
article is printed on. Or there’s
GP 132 (shown here). This
loader, unloader, packer,
stacker and welder —can lift
and maneuver 132 pounds with
no trouble at all. V.

So what's left for me to teach
robots? You might ask. Consid-
er this glimpse into the future
by Dr. Roland W. Schmitt, head
of GE corporate research and
development:

"One of the big frontiers
ahead of us is putting the
robot's nervous system
together with some senses —

like vision, or touch, or the abil-
ity to sense heat or cold. That
can give you an adaptive robot,
one that can sense how well it's
doing its job and make the
adjustments needed to do that
job better.“

That's a tall order. And one
we’ll be expecting you to fill.
With foresight, talent, imagina-
tion — all the things that robots
have yet to learn.

Luis Castellanos mines copper
with software.

Most copper is found deep under-
ground. But the Bell System's 995
million miles of copper cable have
tons of it above and below ground.
That copper provides vital circuit
paths to transmit customer voice,
data and video signals for today's
Information Age needs.

And Luis Castellanos, seven
years out of undergraduate school,
supervises one of the groups that
helps Bell System companies “mine”
all that copper. He works with one of
the largest computer hardware and
software systems in the world—the
Trunks Integrated Record Keeping
System (TIRKS). Every day it
“mines” the vast Bell network for
available circuits and equipment. As
a result of efficient use of network
facilities, the Bell System saves
millions by eliminating the need for
certain capital expenditures.

  
 
  
  
  
 
   

Plus, there’s more to TIRKS than
“mining copper.” it also configures
circuits and assigns components
needed for each circuit path. That
allows Bell companies to respond
faster to customer requests for com-
plex services like video and data
transmission. Employees are more
productive too, because TIRKS
helps them set up circuits and fore-
cast facility needs.

Before TIRKS was available,
keeping track of communications
circuits and facilities required enor-
mous amounts of paperwork and
manual calculation. Every day, the
average Bell System company
handles orders involving 1500
circuits and up to 7500 individual
components associated with them.
Each detail has to be specified
and accounted for.

Now, thanks to people like Luis,
TIRKS keeps track of all that infor-
mation instantaneously using com-
puters. lnformation is up-to-date. It's
instantly available. And it’s more
accurate.

According to computer scientists
like Luis, the benefits from TIRKS

® Bell Laboratories

arejust beginning. He believes that,
as more computer hardware and
software systems like Tl RKS
interact, new benefits for customers
may be possible, as well as
additional productivity increases
for employees.

Luis joined Bell Labs with a B.S.
in computer science from Pratt In-
stitute. Under a company-spon-
sored graduate study program, he
attended Stevens institute of Tech-
nology for his M.S. in computer
science. At the same time, he
worked part-time assuming respon-
sibility for a large piece of TIRKS
software. Working with design
teams, he gained valuable insight
from experienced members. Now,
his technical performance has
earned him a promotion to
supervisor.

Too Technical or

Not Too Technical,

That Is The Question. . .

by R. S. Kushner
Mechanical Engineering Class of 1982

Forgive me Lord Shakespeare. I hope the title's crass
paraphrasing of your Hamlet's immortal lament doesn't send
you turning over in your grave, but it poetically poses a
serious question that I feel needs to be considered. Namely,
are we becoming an overly technical society — engineers
in particular, at the near total expense of culture? A close
look at our society seems to indicate that we are.

Now before I begin, let me assure you that these aren't
the paranoid rantings of a techniphobiac longing for a return
to a halcyon pastoral age. I both appreciate and enjoy as well
as anyone the countless benefits that advanced technology
has provided for society. Furthermore, I hope, and believe,
that we've only just scratched the surface of progress that
will in the future even more greatly aid man's existence.

But at the same time, I feel that we've created a classified,
delineated society where one must be exclusively special-
ized in some particular field to make a contribution to, or
even survive in life. A check of the want ads proves this out.
Journalists, liberal arts graduates, artists, social workers, etc.,
many of whom are doubtlessly brilliant, can't find work
anywhere. On the other hand, industry drools over engineers,
computer scientists, and specialized technicians of all sorts.
Jobs for them are lucrative and plentiful.

Thus — and this is not meant to be a concrete generaliza-
tion, though it is unfortunately oft—times true — a well-
rounded, well—education, articulate person half starves to
death; while a one track, robot—brained, social boor reaps
the harvest.

Again, my purpose here is not to knock or stereo—type
people who work in specialized technological professions,
but to critique a system that forces many people, by necessity,
to become this way. We live in a world that is teaching
children to become computer automatons before they can
articulate a thought into a proper sentence, to play with a
calculator instead of reading a book. A boy's first homerun

nowadays is more likely to be on a video screen than on
a ballfield. A college engineering student is so swamped with
difficult technical courses, that for those few alloted non-
technical elective credits available, he usually takes the
easiest alternatives possible, if only to keep his head above
water grade—wise.

These situations certainly’don’t promote an interest in,
or even allow for, the development of an individual’s reading,
writing, artistic, or communicative talents. We have become
so geared into specialized technological fields, that the rare
engineer who makes time for outside reading, art, poetry,
or any cultural endeavor, is almost thought of as strange.

This need not be. Throughout the ages (or should I
qualify that as ages in which culture was still valued), many
men have combined their technological and cultural talents
effectively. Pascal, DaVinci, Newton, and many others im-
mediately come to mind. Rene Decartes, the 17th Century
Frenchman, is as much honored for his philosophical ad-
vancements as he is for his well known mathematical
achievements.

Granted, these men were unusually blessed. But they
also lived in times when literature and art thrived; when
yellow painted steel beam ”french—fries” weren't passed off
as sculpture. Simply stated, they lived in an era when socie-
ty acknowledged and rewarded talents such as art, verbal
skill, writing prowess, etc.

Is it not tragic enough that we already live in a world
where the gap between socio/moral standards and
technological advancements is so great, that we daily face
the threat of nuclear self—destruction? Must we also threaten
the very existence of culture —- the highest form of human
se|f—expression — due to neglect? I feel that it's time to take
a closer look at this ”system” which holds the future of this
society in its computer-programmed, robotized hands.

The Engineer’s

 

There's a conspiracy under way here at Pitt — unknown
to many people a group of students is planning to take over
CAS!

I'm not talking about the Dental Hygienists, the Glee
Club, or the football team.

I'm talking about the engineers.

Sure, I know they don't seem like a violent group of
students, but I'm beginning to think that more goes on in
Benedum Hall than any non—engineers realize.

I know of course, that this is a serious charge to make;
after all, no one I know of has seen any handgun or heavy
artillery being smuggled in or out of Benedum, and I'll be
the first to admit that there haven't been any anti—CAS rallies,
but I think the evidence is there if you look closely enough.

First of all, when’s the last time you saw an engineer who
looked like an engineer? Everybody knows engineers have
a basic uniform: black tennis shoes; white crew socks; skin-
tight high—water pants; beige polyester short—sleeved shirt;
horn—rimmed glasses with Coke—bottle bottom lenses; s|icked—
down hair parted on the side; and, of course, the trusty pocket
calculator slung at the hip, ready to do battle with the fiercest
calculus problem.

I think they're all going around in disguise. After all,
engineers are beginning to look an awful lot like CAS
students. I know one engineer who wears Izod shirts, belts,
socks, jackets, etc., so that he's almost indistinguishable from
a CAS student.

Conspiracy

by Valerie Jachimowicz

Valerie Jachimowicz is a senior English ma-
for at Pitt. She recently took time to express her
thoughts on what she believes is really going on
in the School of Engineering.

I think one of the reasons women are encouraged to
become engineers is so the male engineers get a chance to
get used to seeing women around. This way they'll know
how to talk to them if it's necessary.

I'm sure that someone is running a training school up
there at Benedum like those schools for spies they have in
the Soviet Union, where they immerse people in a language
and culture until they're identical to natives of wherever
they're going. After the engineers go through this program
no one in CA5 will know for sure who the engineers are.

For all we know, they've already infiltrated the CAS ad-
vising center and are planning to make a move soon on Dean
Schulman’s office.

A second reason I'm convinced that there's a take—over
plot going on under our noses is the number of CAS courses
engineering students take. All their non—engineering courses
are taken through CAS, and some of them decide to com-
plete the requirements for Chemistry majors or for admis-
sion to medical school, so that they take even more CAS
courses than their fellows.

Obviously, engineering students take these courses as
part of their indoctrination in the behavior of CAS students.
It's one thing for an engineer to look like a CAS person, but
if the take—over is to succeed, they'll have to be able to act
like someone who's in CA5, or everyone will realize that
something's amiss and will be able to prepare for the
onslaught.

This part of their plan is succeeding, l’m afraid. Not on-
ly is it almost impossible to identify an engineer by his or
her appearance, but even their behavior is becoming in-
distinguishable from that of a CAS student. Unless engineers
choose to let their cover slip by talking about EE 31 or
Chem E 94 they speak just like their CAS counterparts.
Doubtless this is a result of their participation in CAS courses.
Since CAS is giving engineers an opportunity to observe math
and physics majors, engineers are learning how to speak like
an average CAS student. They're learning to talk about girls
(or boys, as the case may be), a movie they saw on TV, or
the latest news from Lebanon. If action isn’t taken soon, it
will be impossible to distinguish the engineers from the CAS
students, and the plot will be one step further along.

Another thing that has me worried about what the
Engineering School is planning for CAS is that a lot of the
engineers are as literate, and in some cases, more literate,
than CAS majors. Take this publication, Skyscraper Engineer,
for instance. The editor and staff are all engineers, but even
so it's a pretty good magazine. Engineers obviously are
becoming we|l—rounded individuals, and I can see only one
purpose for this. CAS students are expected to become rather
we||—rounded themselves, and if engineers are going to fit
into CAS, they're going to have to be able to write and speak
as if they were CAS—educated. FORTRAN just won't suffice
as a language for communication with people, so the
Engineering school must be trying to encourage literacy. Peo-
ple like the staff of this magazine are examples of the suc-
cess of this effort.

Triangle fraternity is another possible threat. I think that
it's a secret society that will provide replacements for the ad-
minstration of CAS after the take-over. Belonging to Triangle
gives these people the opportunity to get some advanced
training. Of course, I could be wrong about this; they might
be some kind of secret police, and the Triangle house could
be their officer's club. l’m not sure which it is, but I know
there's something supsicious about it.

The most damning evidence I have for this accusation
is this — Engineers’ Week. Despite what the engineers would
have us believe, Engineers’ Week is nothing if it is not an
excuse to give them practice in military tactics, demonstrate
and share their conspiracy-related work, and encourage each
other in their endeavors.

Consider the Soap Box derby. This event gives engineers
a chance to design soap box cars to specifications, and the
best designed car will, of course, win the derby. This seems
a perfect opportunity for engineers to practice some of what
they learn in class and teaches them to cooperate with each
other, both of which will be valuable once the plot is put
into action.
