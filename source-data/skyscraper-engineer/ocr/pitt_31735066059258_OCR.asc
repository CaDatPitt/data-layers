REVOLUTION IN TV

Thomas Henry Hux1ey...on pure and applied. science

“I often wish that this phrase, ‘applied science,’
had never been invented. For it suggests that there
is a sort of scientiﬁc knowledge of direct practical
use, which can he studied apart from another
sort of scientific knowledge, which is of no practi-
cal utility, and which is termed ‘pure science.’

But there is no more complete fallacy than this.

What people call applied science is nothing
but the application of pure science to particular
classes of problems. It consists of deductions from
those general principles, established by reasoning
and observation, which constitute pure science. No
one can safely make these deductions until he has

a firm grasp of the principles.” r~SCience and Culture

Last year at this time, the staff
of the SKYSCRAPER was quite
excited over winning two second
place awards at the ECMA (En-
gineering College Magazines As-
sociated) Convention. This year’s
convention held at the University
of Colorado at Boulder City proved
even more successful. Editor Ken
Rothert, Business Manager Pete
Bizon, and Advisor Dr. Donald
Swarts returned with two first place
awards and one honorable mention.

We can’t live on last year’s laurels,
so we’re out to make this issue
another award winner. Bill Jacob,
ME ’60, describes in his article
“Production Story 1959,” the unique
features employed in the con-
struction of America’s first com-
mercial jet aircraft.

If $50,000 sounds like a lot /of
money for a tape recorder, you
should read “Revolution in TV,” by

Whereo will
the '59 Graduate
go?

Industry's demand for capable graduates in the ﬁelds of science and
engineering is still exceeding the supply produced by American colleges
and universities. As a result, the most promising members of this year's
class may well wind up with a number of openings to consider.

In such circumstances, who would blame a bright young man for at
least letting the phrase “eeny, meeny, miny, mo" slip through his mind!

Of course, there is one inescapable conclusion to be considered: open-

ings are one thing, genuine opportunities quite another. Thoughtful

examination of such factors as potential growth, challenge, advance-
ment policy, facilities, degree of self-direction, permanence, and
benefits often indicates that real opportunity does not yet grow
on trees.

Moreover, the great maiority of personal success stories are
still being written by those who win positions with the
most successful companies.

turer, please write to Mr. Richard L. Auten,

AN INVITATION

TO DISTINCTION

By Dr. G. R. Fitterer. Dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines

“Some minds think about things; others
think the things themselves.” — Schelling

Herein lies the distinction which is responsible for
the progress of civilization. It is a distinction which
the engineer and the scientist should constantly keep
before him.

Anyone can think about things which already exist.
The ﬁrst major function of an educational institution is
to teach the students the fundamentals or the laws
which are already known. The student may then ad-
vance to the point where he can contribute to the
progress of mankind by developing new thoughts or
the “things themselves.”

The public looks to the engineer and the scientist
particularly to create new things because these are the
individuals whose minds have mastered the fundament-
als and have been trained for this purpose.

The second duty of higher education is to arouse a
persistent curiosity in the student. He should be taught
to criticaly examine and evaluate all new thoughts.
This is one of the reasons that engineers can be dis-
tinguished from technicians. The technician is taught
the “know-how” and the engineer is taught not only
the “know-how” but the “know-why” as well. The
question of “why” about every new subject. Later
in life when he is confronted with a new phenomenon,
his habit of asking “why” will set the wheels in motion
for a technological break-through. He will have thought
the “things themselves.” I

PRODUCTION STORY
1959

The production story of today’s

The acceleration is sluggish, the runway seems end-
less, but ﬁnally you’re in the air and streaking away
at 575 miles per hour. These are characteristics of
America’s new jet liners and of the commercial jet age.
Among the new jet age aircrafts, the Convair 880 will
be prominent. Many new techniques have evolved in
the fabrication of this new liner. Fresh ideas in engines
and in servicing have also been developed

Substantial power is most important in jet propulsion
and its source can best be described by taking a close
look at the four General Electric C]-805-3 engines sus-
pended from the wing in pods. This arrangement is
unique, since it makes use of only three engine mount-
ing points—a stabilizing mount at the forward top of
the engine and two main trunnion-type mounts on the
horizontal centerline in the plane of the engine turbine
case. The engine is a single-spool, axial-ﬂow, high-
pressure ratio turbo-jet with thrust reverser and sound
suppressor. Unusual simplicity of design, light weight,
low speciﬁc fuel consumption, maximum accessibility
for servicing, line maintenance and overhaul are among

its outstanding features. The turbine, combustion, and.

compressor sections are structurally surrounded by re-

are provided in the cowling next to the engine support
which allows access both to the upper engine area and
on the right-hand side to the oil tank fill prots for check-
ing oil levels and refilling. When the panels are raised,
all lines and accessories are immediately within reach,
not only for inspection but also for replacement of parts
in line maintenance.

The engines are designed to provide maximum thrust
on either special jet fuels or kerosene. In the engine
fuel system, pump discharge fuel is used for hydraulic
operation of variable compressor stator actuators, as a
coolant for engine lubricant and constant-speed drive
oil.

The two principal pilot controls for each engine are
the power-reverse thrust lever and the engine start-fuel
shutoff lever. A significant and highly advantageous
feature of the General Electric engine is its instantan-
eous acceleration with power lever advance. The thrust
reverser permits the Convair 880 to operate on present
day airfields which were designed for propellor driven
aircraft. It incorporates a gate-like mechanism that
alters the direction of exhaust gas flow which provides
thrust in the forward direction. A sound suppressor is

DECEMBER 1958

installed on the aft face of the engine exhaust section.
The suppressor reduces engine noise by providing an
exhaust exit configuration that enlarges the area in
which the exhaust gases mix with the surrounding air.

The Convair 880 is equipped with an air conditioning
and pressurization system that is not only the most eff-
icient available today but virtually failure free. The
system is composed basically of two separate and inde-
pendant subsystems, pneumatically-driven by bleed air
from the four engines. Each subsystem consists primarily
of a ram air supercharger, an air-to-air heat exchanger,
and a vapor cycle freon refrigeration unit. Under nor-
mal operation, one subsystem supplies fresh air for the
cabin; the other supplies air for the flight deck. Each
subsystem is controlled separately, but if one subsystem
becomes inoperative, the other will supply comfortable
air conditioning and pressurization for both the cabin
and the flight deck for the remainder of the flight.

The vapor cycle refrigeration unit is essentially a
freon loop system that uses Freon 114, a stable non-
toxic fluid. The freon loop contains: compressor and
drive, condenser, evaporator, and the necessary control
valves. Moisture, which is present in the air passing
through the freon evaporator, condenses on the cool
surfaces of the evaporator and forms large drops. These
are drained and thrown overboard. This entire operation
prevents moisture, either liquid or fog, from entering
the cabin.

Sea level comfort at altitudes up to 20,500 feet is
maintained by the Convair 880 pressurization system. At
40,000 feet, the cabin air pressure is the same as that
which exists at 8,000 feet, and humidity and tempera-
ture ranges are compatible. Automatic controls prevent
sudden changes in pressurization during rapid climb or
descent.

“Fail-safe” design techniques are applied to all fea-
tures of construction to achieve positive structural in-
tegrity. From acoustic reduction to wind tunnel testing
and water tank immersion, all major fuselage com-
ponents undergo rigorous testing to ensure an opera-
tionally sound airplane. In addition, fuselage structure

offers extra measures of safety. Due to extra heavy
fuselage skins, .063 to .100 inch, it is expected that skin
stresses in the aircraft will be low enough to prevent
fatigue cracks throughout the life of the airplane.

One of the most important preliminary steps in the
Convair 880 development program is the production of
18,000 detailed parts for every airplane exclusive of
systems, components, and furnishings. Special equip-
ment had to be purchased to fabricate many of the parts.
The largest radial draw former ever made, a Cyril Bath
stretch-forming machine, is an example. Its 75-ton capa-
city tension ram and 35-ton compression ram are es-
sential in fabricating the “880” beltframes, which are
12 feet in diameter. Two frames, when joined, form a
complete circumference of the fuselage.

Twenty-six factory line moves, each approximately

14

 

three and one-half days duration, are necessary for the
entire assembly operation. Primary stations are concern-
ed with the assembly of: longerons, skins, stringers,
bulkheads, spars, belt-frames, and frame. Following is
the center tie box and the forward lower canoe, after
which the wing box structure and the forward fuselage
structure are assembled.

The first major mate takes place between the aft
fuselage and the complete wing, with the forward
fuselage next in the mating sequence. The carriage on
which the mated wing box sections are placed is remov-
ed. The airplane, nearing the state of completion, is
placed on roller-skate type carriages for the remainder
of major mate and final assembly.

Four stations are also employed in the final assembly
of the airplane. The first covers: electric operations,
complete interior trim and floors, radar installation,
exterior paint, and mark and stencil. The second in-
volves hydraulic operations and flight control checkout.
Installation of all seating is handled at the third. Area
inspection and last clean-up is also finished before the
final OK. Station four is important to the passenger, for
it is here that the buyer inspects and gives his approval
and acceptance. The Convair 880 is factory complete at
this point, but before delivery it must undergo two
electronic station checkouts and four field operation
stations.

In the first field operation station, fuel calibrations,
engine run, flight safety check, and flight release are
checked. Convair flights and customer flights are handl-
ed in the second phase, while loose equipment is in-
stalled and flight and CAA inspections are made at the
third station. The fourth and final field operation
station is utilized for customer pilot training, after
which the airplane is released for delivery.

From previous description, one realizes that the
Convair 880, along with other jet airliners, is ushering
in a new age of commercial jet air travel with the safety,
speed, and economy that will surely win the acceptance
and approval of customers I

MANY ENGINEERING MANHOURS were devoted to in-
cinerator design. Sewage sludge, after being dewatered,
is mixed with coal and transferred to the incinerator where
it is burned.

The great cholera outbreak in London in 1848-1849,
ultimately proven to be caused by the seepage of sew-
age into a public water well, resulted in the death of
14,600 persons from cholera alone and many thousands
more of diarrhea. The crowded conditions of the city
of London helped to set the stage for such a disaster.
Life expectancy was substantially reduced under such
circumstances. Persons born in the United States in
around 1900 had a life expectancy of 45 years. Babies
born today can look forward to an increased life ex-
pectancy of about 70 years.

The technological development of our modern water
treatment plants by sanitary engineers has played an
important role in virtually stamping out such communi-
cable diseases as typhoid fever and cholera. This is only
one illustration of the many ways that the sanitary
engineer has been able to minimize the stresses of the
environment on man.

Most engineers deal more with the inanimate than
they do with people. In sanitary engineering, however,
the emphasis is primarily on the health and welfare of
man. Sanitary engineering, therefore, may be deﬁned
as that area of engineering which endeavors to control
the environment for the health, safety and welfare of
men through engineering means.

The broad term environment simply means the sur-
roundings, be it physical, biological or social, includ-

ing the basic needs of air, food, and water.

Environment is not static, but dynamic—in con-
stant motion. New demands and stresses are constantly
being made on the human body. Some of these new
stresses are best being handled by the special abilities
of the sanitary who is accustomed to thinking of as
the primary beneﬁciary of his scientiﬁc and engineer-
ing know-how.

A pollution, scarcity of water, and the presence of
radioactive materials in air, food, and water are ex-
amples of these new stresses, all man made.

The National Research Council through its Com-
mittee on Sanitary Engineering and Environment has
deﬁned the sanitary engineer as one “who has ﬁtted
himself by suitable specialized training, study, and ex-
perience (a) to conceive, design, appraise, direct and
manage engineering works and projects developed, as a
whole or in part, for the protection and promotion of
the public health, particularly as it relates to the im-
provement of man’s environment and (b) to investi-
gate and correct engineer’s works and other projects
that are capable of injury to the health by being or

15

becoming faulty in conception, design, direction, or
management.”

Career opportunities for sanitary engineers exists
in a wide variety of areas. Each in itself offers a great
challenge and a promising future for the young man
choosing this ﬁeld as his life’s work. All avenues of
opportunity contribute signiﬁcantly to the singular ob-
jective of preserving the total public health.

In the public works ﬁeld, the sanitary engineer is
called upon to design, construct, operate, and main-
tain facilities for providing drinking water. Industry
utilizes the services of the sanitary engineer for the
collection and disposal of sewage and for the intercep-
tion of storm drainage.

Many opportunities exist for those desiring employ-
ment with a private enterprise. These include the de-
sign, construction, operation and maintenance of
facilities for process water and boiler feed water; dis-
posal of wastes; eliminating noxious dusts, fumes,
mists, vapors, or gases from the workroom environ-
ment; controlling discharge of gaseous or particle
discharges to the atmosphere and providing the
environmental and process control for the sanitary
quality of food products.

Another area of opportunity exists in official health
agencies which operate on all levels of government. As
an example, on the international level the sanitary
engineer can employ his knowledge for great good in
socially and economically under-developed countries
of the world. In contrast to the activities of the sanitary
engineer in the public works ﬁeld where design, con-
struction, operation, and maintenance are employed,

SANITARY ENGINEERS are often required to deal with
huge components in their design work. This 10 ft.-6 in.
inside diameter pipe was used by the Allegheny County
Sanitary Authority in their sewage disposal plant.

MODERN sanitary engineers use barges equipped with
cranes for laying sewage pipe across a river.

the sanitary engineer in the health agency performs
activities that are more investigative, supervisory, and
educational in nature. These include the promotion of
the development of essentially sanitary services in areas
where they are not yet available; establishing standards
of performance, or related indices, to insure adequate
protection of health from environmental hazards; re-
viewing and approving engineering plans and speciﬁca-
tions‘ for sanitary engineering adequacy prior, to issu-
ance of construction permits and evaluating perform-
ance of various sanitary engineering works in relation
to design characteristics and hazard control objectives.

Another area of application for the sanitary engineer
is found in the armed services. Here he will essentially
operate in any or all three application areas previously
mentioned. A fast developing area of responsibility for
the sanitary engineer in the armed services is in the
control of exposure to radiological hazards and in the
disposal of solid, liquid, and gaseous radioactive wastes.

Finally, the sanitary engineer as a private consultant
can operate in a professional capacity on a par with
architecture, medicine, or law. His activities can en-
compass all previously cited areas and as such brings
him in contact with private industry, municipalities and
governmental agencies.

According to a recent classiﬁcation by the Commit-
tee on Sanitary Engineering and Environment, the
practice of sanitary engineering includes the follow-
ing activities:

1. Surveys, reports, designs, reviews direction, man-
agement, operation and investigation of works or pro-
grams for:

a. Water supply, treatment and distribution.
b. The collection, treatment and disposal of com-
munity wastes, namely, sanitary sewages,, in-

dustrial wastes and refuse, including salvage and

reclamation of useful components of such wastes.

c. The control of pollution ‘of surface waterways

and ground waters, and of surface and subsur-

face soils.

d. Milk and food sanitation.

Housing and institutional sanitation.

Insect and vermin control or eradication.

Rural, camp and recreation place sanitation.

. The control of atmosphere pollution and air
quality, and of light, noise, vibration and toxic
materials, including application to work spaces
in industrial establishments (industrial hygiene
engineering) .

The prevention of radiation exposure.

Other ﬁelds that have as their major objective
the control of environmental factors effecting
health.

2. Professional research and development work sup-
porting the activities listed in the above.

3. Responsible teaching of sanitary engineering sub-
jects in educational institutions of recognized standing.

Education of sanitary engineers offers a great chal-
lenge to those sanitary engineers in our universities. Re-
search is an important facet of their academic respon-
sibilities and can be quite complementary to their
teaching success. Frequently, the sanitary engineering
educator engages also in private consultation in order
to maintain close contact with current engineering
practice.

Today, it is felt that engineers preparing themselves
for a career in sanitary engineering should pursue their
studies to the Master of Science level. This is due to
the rapidly expanding horizons of the sanitary engi-
neering ﬁeld and to the increasing complexity of our

als are stressed to a high degree by requiring extensive
mathematics, biology, chemistry and nuclear physics.

Graduates of civic engineering courses will be better
qualiﬁed with undergraduate prerequisites for post-
graduate study in the public works ﬁeld. Graduates of
mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and met-
allurgical engineering programs may qualify to pursue
graduate study leading to the Master’s degree in sani-
tary engineering for work in the ﬁelds of health agen-
cies and industrial hygiene.

graduate assistantships. With the advent of the Sput-
niks and the increased emphasis on scientiﬁc education,
it may be possible to receive support for graduate work
through the National Science Foundation. Finally’, the
Public Health Service of the United States Depart-
ment of Health, Education, and Welfare, under Title I
of Public Law 911, offers on a competitive basis, public
health traineeships for those interested in graduate
education in this ﬁeld.

At the University of Pittsburgh, the Graduate School
of Public Health offers graduate opportunities to quali-
ﬁed engineers interested in sanitary engineering, indus-
trial hygiene, and radiological health.

Facilities are most modern and complete. Graduate
work can lead to any of the following degrees: Master of
Science in Hygiene, Master of Public Health, and
Doctor of Science in Hygiene.

The opportunities in the sanitary engineering profes-
sion are many and varied. The present state of our
society is in no small way the result of the accomplish-
ments of sanitary engineers over the last 100 years. As
our industrial complex grows, the stresses in the environ-
ment on man will grow in proportion or even at an
accelerated rate. Consequently, the responsibility of the
sanitary engineering profession in minimizing the
stresses from radiation on air, food, and water will in-
crease measurably. I

The tin coating on “C” ration cans does not have to
be thick—but it is important that it be evenly dis-
tributed to give sure protection for the contents. But
how can you measure and inspect a coating that’s
almost as thin as a shadow?

U. S. Steel does it with the unique X-ray gage you
see in the picture. A beam of X-rays is directed at
the tinplate. The rays penetrate the tin coating and
cause the iron atoms in the steel base to ﬂuoresce and
emit X-rays of their own. As these new X-rays
emerge from the base, they are partially absorbed
by the tin coating. The X-rays ﬁnally leaving the
tin are measured by a geiger counter and this reveals
the amount of absorption and, therefore, the coat-

Magnetic video tape permits

rapid reproduction of

A s the magnetic sound recorder revolutionized the
radio and record industries in America, so the video
tape recorder promises to improve television production
methods. This new medium offers a versatility hereto-
fore unheard of in television.

Its ability to play back both picture and sound im-
mediately after recording enables the producer of a
television show to catch imperfections and correct
them immediately while both the cast and crew are
standing by. This eliminates the uncertainty and delay
of present day ﬁlming techniques. The prospect of
immediate playback enables the producer to adapt to
last minute programming changes, since a show can
be taped minutes before air time. In this way special
timely programs deliver their full impact upon the
television audience.

Not only is tape more versatile than ﬁlm in television
applications, but in many ways it is of better quality.
In ﬁlms, each frame is an individual picture projected
upon the screen for a fraction of a second. There is a
ﬂicker in changing from frame to frame. Video tape

however, consists of a changing electromagnetic pulse
which provides a continuous picture free from ﬂicker.

The black-to-gray scale of the picture on television
screen is equivalent to that of a live telecast, vastly
superior to ﬁlm. Synchronization of picture with sound
is positively locked and cannot be unbalanced even
when the tape is edited.

Like magnetic sound tape, video tape can be erased
and reused. This tremendously reduces the operating
costs of a television station which ﬁlms daily shows.

Television networks and stations across the country
are realizing that magnetic video tape will replace the
film to a greater extent than magnetic sound tape
replaced the sixteen-inch acetate disc in radio. The
development of video tape, however, did not necessar-
ily follow from the fact that problems in magnetic
sound recording had been conquered. Years of research
and development to solve problems unheard of in sound
recording were spent before video tape was developed.
The Ampex Electric Corporation, whose magnetic
sound tape recorders are recognized as the standard of

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

the broadcast industry, was ﬁrst to produce an accept-
able video tape recorder. Although the principles in-
volved in recording a picture on magnetic tape are es-
sentially analogous to those encountered in sound re-
cording, video tape recording is a great deal more com-
plex.

To understand technically how viedo tape recording
is done, look at some of the problems which had to be
overcome. The video signal, as generated in the tele-
vision camera consists of frequencies varying from
direct current to 4 megacycles per second. High head-
to-tape velocity was required to record the high fre-
quency components of the video signal. This in turn
introduced the second problem, that of providing ade-
quate playing time using reels of reasonable size. Pro-
bably the greatest problem was ﬁnding a means where-
by the entire video signal, from direct current to four
megacycles could be accurately recorded and repro-
duced.

To solve the ﬁrst two problems, engineers mount four
recording heads at the outer circumference of a rotat-
ing disc with their gaps parallel to the disc axis. In this

/’

way the video signal is recorded vertically rather than
horizontally on the tape. In the head assembly, each
head is spaced with microscopic precision at ninety
degrees from the next on the disc. With a disc diameter
of two inches and a rotational speed qf 14,400 rpm, the
“writing speed” or relative‘ tape-to-head velocity is
1,500 inches per second. The reel to reel tape velocity
depends upon the width of the tracks which are to be
laid down transversely on the tape and the necessary
distance between them. These video tracks are ten
mils wide with an edge to edge separation of ﬁve mils
and a center to center spacing of ﬁfteen mils. In this
way it is possible to reduce greatly the necessary tape
velocity and to operate at the familiar speed of ﬁfteen

DECEMBER 1958

inches per second. By the use of thin tape, sixty four
minutes of recording time are obtained on a 12% inc
diameter reel of two-inch wide tape. ’

During the sweep of a head transversely across the
tape, an arc of 120 degrees is described. Since all four
heads are fed the same currents during recording there
exists a duplication of information at the end of one
track on the tape and at the beginning of the succeed-
ing one. This duplication is used in the switching sys-
tem to deliver continuous, transient-free signals dur-
ing replay. The four heads perform 960 sweeps across
the tape each second. During each second, 15 inches of
tape pass the head longitudinally. At this rate, 64 suc-
cessive sweeps or tracks are recorded on each inch of
tape.

The video information is not the only track on the
tape, however. There are four separate but synchronized
magnetic tracks on the recorded tape. The ﬁrst is the
series of transverse video tracks; the second is the sound
track which accompanies the picture. The audio signal
is impressed along a 1/3 inch wide longitudinal track
at the top of the tape. This sound recording is done in
the conventional manner, with a stationary recording
head impressing the signal longitudinally as the tape
moves past the head at 15 inches per second.

The third magnetic track is the control track which
comprises a record of the alternating currents which
feed the rotating head motor during that recording.
This control track monitors the operation of the cap-
stan tape drive motor and the head motor in the play-
back mode. To understand the operation of the con-
trol track more thoroughly, look ﬁrst at the operation
of the tape transport mechanism.

The transport mechanism used is similar to that
found in many professional magnetic audio recorders.
The tape is supplied from a reel on the left, passes
around an idler and then past the rotating video head
assembly which also contains the stationary control
track‘ head. The tape then goes on to two stationary
stacks of heads. On the ﬁrst stack is an erase head which
clears the upper 90 mils of the tape and a cue track,
which is used to provide guideposts for the producer

in preparing the program. The second stack contains
only the audio record-playback head at the upper edge
of the stack. The tape next passes between a drive
capstan and its pressure idler, contacts a takeup ten-
sion arm and travels on to a tape takeup reel at the
right.

The tape must pass the rotating disc at nearly con-
stant pressure for good reproduction. This is accom-
plished by an exactly machined guide which duplicates
the path of the rotating heads and through the use of
vacuum applied at the head side of the tape.

During both recording and playback, an intimate re-
lation must exist between the rotation of the revolving
heads and that of the capstan drive assembly. The
same relation must be maintained during playback
as that which existed during recording. This is the
function of the control track.

While recording, the 60 cycle power line current is
ﬁrst applied to a frequency multiplier which produces a
240 cycle signal. This signal drives a three phase power
ampliﬁer during recording which in turn supplies 24-0
cycle power to the synchronous motor which drives the
rotating head disc.

A portion of the rotating mechanism is coated half
black and ‘half white. A light source is focused on the
black and white disc and reﬂected into a photocell to
produce a 240 cycle output signal. This is passed to a
frequency divider which produces 60 cycle power. This
signal is then fed to a ﬁlter whose output is a clean 60
cycle sine wave, which in turn is fed to the capstan
drive motor. This system locks the rotation of the video
disc head to the rotation of the capstan drive motor.
During this process the output of the photocell is fed
to a recording ampliﬁer which impresses the signal on
the control track of the tape.

The variation of the signal on the control track
bears a direct relation to the spacing of the video track
on the tape.

In the playback mode, a phase comparator acts on

20

the difference between the photocell signal produced on
the rotation of the heads, and the signal recorded on the
control track of the tape. Any difference between these
two signals causes a Wein bridge oscillator to change.
This change causes the capstan motor to speed up or
slow down as-required. In this way the power supplied
to the capstan motor is generated from the actual
motion of the revolving heads, enslaving the capstan
to the head disc. During the recording process the
tape is moved precisely 62.59 mils longitudinally dur-
ing each complete revolution of the head disc. In this
period four lateral tracks are recorded, one for each
head, with a center to center distance between tracks
of 15.66 mils.

Superimposed on the control track are edit pulses
spaced according to the blanking time between televi-
sion ﬁelds, that is the time during the electronic com-
position of the picture when the television screen is
instantaneously blank. It the tape'is cut and put back
together during the blanking periods there will be no
roll-over on the television screen when the tape is play-
ed back. In order to make the edit pulses visible when
splicing the tape a solution containing carbonyl iron is
applied to the tape prior to making the cut. The iron
particles adhere to the tape according to magnetic pat-
tern made by the recording, clearly revealing the edit;
ing pulses. The tape is then placed in a jig and a cut
is made along an editing pulse. When the desired por-
tion is removed or added and the ends are matched,
splicing tape is applied to hold the ends together. After
the splice has been made the carbonyl iron particles
wipe off easily.

The fourth track on the tape, a cue track occupies a
strip 10 mils wide on the bottom edge of the tape. The
operator may record on this track a signal which will
serve as a guide in playing back the tape. These cue
pulses tell the producer exactly where the program
starts, the place where commercials or announcements
should be inserted, or any other important information
which the producer wishes to mark for future refer-
ence in editing the tape.

To solve the problem of ﬁnding a means of record-
ing and reproducting the range from direct current to
4 megacycles per second or more, and not just the upper
end of that spectrum. Engineers thought of an FM
modulation system and ultimately adopted it in an
unusual form.

Classically, it is assumed that the highest modulating
frequency used in an FM transmission system will not
exceed one tenth the carrier frequency and that devia-
tion will be small compared with the carrier frequency.
This implied a carrier of 40 megacycles for video re-
cording, so the use of FM would have to be abandoned
if these conditions were to be observed.

Recording the 40 megacyc-le carier frequency re-
quired either a large increase in head-to-tape velocity,
or a large reduction in the shortest wavelength handled.

An alternative was to use a low frequency carrier.
Since a low frequency carrier would be near the higher
frequency needed for adequate picture deﬁnition it was

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

necessary to use an FM system in which the frequency
of deviation was large in relation -to the carrier fre-
quency, and in which the modulating frequencies ap-
proached the carrier frequency.

In the video tape recorder, for example, when the
carrier is 5 megacycles, maximum modulating fre-
quency is 4.5 megacycles and the deviation is held
to 500 kilocycles. The head-tape system must therefore
efficiently pass frequencies from 500 kilocycles, the
deviation, to 5.5 megacycles, the carrier frequency plus
the deviation. This conﬁguration of carrier, modulat-
ing frequency and deviation can stay within the limits
of the recordable bandpass of the 'video spectrum. It
is comparatively simple to preserve frequency rela-
tions approaching direct current in an FM system
using the same techniques as are used to record the
higher frequencies.

In violating the classical assumption that carrier fre-
quency in FM systems should be ten times the highest
modulating frequency, a certain amount of distortion
is encountered as the higher modulation frequencies
approach the carrier frequency. This distortion of the
signal at frequencies in the band above 1 megacycle in
the video tape recorder manifests itself in a certain
amount of zig-zagging of closely spaced vertical lines.
Fortunately these blurring effects are reduced by the
nature of human vision and the picture is highly ac-
ceptable.

Although this distortion is of minor importance to
the video information, the waveform of the demodulated
composite video signal suffers considerable deforma-

tion. This would unbalance the synchronizing system
by changing the shape of the synchronizing pulses on
the control track. A processing ampliﬁer therefore fol-
lows the demodulator which strips the impressed video
signal from the carrier. This processing ampliﬁer re-
constitutes the synchronizing information and adds
it again to the video signal to produce an improved
composite signal. The video tape recorder, with it’s uni-
que FM recording system is thus capable of reproduc-
ing the entire visible video spectrum.

The performance of the video tape recorder has been
improved by two other signiﬁcant developments. The
availability of special tape, with surface smoothness
much ﬁner than provided or needed in audio tape im-
proves both electronic and mechanical performance of
the system. In addition, specially formulated oxides of
particularly good short wavelength resolution capabil-
ity have substantially improved picture quality since
the introduction of video tape in 1956.

Head manufacturing techniques have also been re-
ﬁned" with the result that abrasion effect has been
reduced both on tape and on heads. Today a tape may
be used over one hundred times without loss of video
or audio quality.

These improvements are only a few of the many
advances made in video tape recording during its
short existence. Research and development are contin-
uously being carried on to place this medium on a
par in the television industry with magnetic audio
tape recording which has so revolutionized methods
of radio program production.

DEVELOPMENT CENTER . . .

Another Unmatched Engineering Facility to
Advance Propulsion Systems of the Future

Future aircraft and missiles may require propulsion
systems far different from those in wide use today
— different in size, power output, appearance, and
perhaps even in the basic method of utilizing energy.

To probe the propulsion future . . . and to build
and test greatly advanced propulsion systems for
coming generations of ﬂight vehicles, Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft is now operating its new Florida
Research and Development Center. This facility
supplements Pratt & Whitney’s main research and
development installations in Connecticut.

The new Florida Center, ﬁnanced and built by
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, is unique in America’s
air industry. Here a completely air-conditioned
plant with 17 acres under roof is specially designed
and equipped for the development of new power

 

plants of virtually any type. Testing is handled in
special isolated areas; the nearest is four miles
from the plant and many miles from any inhabited
area. The new Center can be greatly expanded on
its 10-square-mile site. Continued isolation is in-
sured by a vast wildlife sanctuary in which the
Center is located.

Of the many people employed at the Center to-
day, about half are scientists, engineers and highly
trained technicians. By late next year, the total
number is expected to be almost doubled.

The new Florida Research and Development
Center is one more reason why Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft is able to continue producing the world’s
best aircraft propulsion systems . . . in whatever
form they take.

MINIATURIZATION for the MISSILE AGE

Another new design frontier for copper

"The increasing amount of equip-
ment carried on military aircraft
. . . has made it necessary for the
design engineer to cram more equip-
ment into less space.”

“To achieve maximum usefulness
from miniaturization, all elements
of the system must be reduced to the
same order of size. New design tech-
niques, components and production
methods have been developed to aid
the designer in reaching this goal.”

— Electronics Magazine

‘Many of these new design tech-
mques are taking advantage of the
properties of a very old material —
copper. ‘One of copper’s big jobs is
conduct1ng electricity in control cir-
cuits. Of course, copper is the best
co.m_mercial conductor, but when
miniaturization takes over, many
other properties of copper also be-
come important.

In the printed circuits
that are the very basis of
most subminiature de-
signs, the conductors may
start out as a sheet of
copper foil. This foil often
has to be very thin — yet
free of ﬂaws that might
cause circuit discontinui-
ties. Here, copper’s ductil-
ity is vital.

Good joining properties
are also important. Some
of the tiny connections are
resistance welded. (Cop-
per can withstand the
temperatures.) Others are
soldered. (Easily done
with copper and with very
little solder metal.)

Complex control cir-
cuits can now be wired
with ﬂexible Tape Cable.
This tape may contain as
many as 50 copper con-
ductors, side by side —
and weigh only 2%
pounds per 100-ft. roll.
The standard size of each of the
rectangular conductors in the tape
is 0.0015 in. by 0.03 in.

Obviously, with such small cross
sections, no deterioration of the con-
ductor is permissible. Yet tempera-
tures, particularly in missile appli-
cations, are high. The answer is
found in copper which is free of
oxygen—e1iminating oxidation, scale
formation and conductivity losses.

In other high temperature appli-
cations, copper’s high thermal con-
ductivity can be used to protect more
delicate parts from excessive heat.
For this reason it is useful in missile

ble, ﬂat 50-conductor interconnection system.

nose cones. And, of course, copper’s
excellent corrosion resistance is
often valuable in exposed parts and
in tubing.

The ﬁeld of missiles and rocketry
is but another example of a design
frontier where the versatility of cop-
per and the copper alloys helps make
progress possible.

THE MAN* WITH KOPPERS

“. . . versatility recognized”

*Arthur Herman graduated from Johns Hopkins
in 1955 and went to work immediately in the Metal
Products Division of Koppers as a Design Engineer.

In December of the same year, he was promoted
to Supervising Engineer of the Design Section,
where he found that Koppers offers truly challeng-
ing problems in design engineering.

Then, in September 1957, Art was transferred
to the Coupling Sales Department as a Coupling
Application Engineer. He is serving in that
capacity now.

An employment record alone is seldom descrip-
tive of the opportunities and responsibilities many
positions represent. For instance, Art was recently
designated as Division Representative to investi-
gate the potentialities of a new product developed
by a European manufacturer. This assignment
took him abroad.

Art is particularly articulate about his job and
the constant challenge it presents for him as an
individual.

“When I ﬁrst started as a design engineer,” he
said, “I didn’t realize the scope of activities in

DECEMBER 1958

 

which I’d be called on to participate. Sure, I had
good theory and background for design engineering,
but I had little concept of the problems of produc-
tion, and even less familiarity with the techniques
of sales or marketing. My work as an application
engineer gets me into almost every phase of the
business — development, production, marketing,
ﬁnance, and so forth.

“At Koppers I feel that I receive the necessary
guidance to enable me to contribute fully to the
Company’s activities. I am encouraged to make
decisions. If these decisions involve factors with
which I am not entirely familiar, I can rely on the
judgment and experience of others working with
me. At all times, I feel that I have real access to
upper levels of management where my ideas have
always been received thoughtfully and given full
consideration. Now, I feel conﬁdent that I am
doing a job for Koppers, and, what is equally
important, that my associates and supervisors
understand and appreciate it, too! I have found
that through such methods as the Management
Appraisal Program, Koppers makes every effort
to recognize and reward good performance.”

A lot of things could be said about Art Herman,
and the career he found at Koppers. But as the
manager to whom Art reports commented recently:
“Art’s an able man . . . we’re glad to have him. He
is making a real contribution to the Company.
All we in management can do is try our best to
develop a man’s best qualities and, when he proves
to have the Versatility that Art has, to see that
this Versatility is recognized.”

If you feel that this is the atmosphere in which
you would most like to build your profession and
mark your progress, write to the Manager of Man-
power Planning, Koppers Company, Inc., Pitts-
burgh 19, Pennsylvania or contact your College
Placement Director.

I ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE OF LIFE

the thundering heard, no. 2

     
       

     

In the past several years, I have become involved in
that portion of society known as higher education. At
the present time, my immediate goal is to attain a
university granted degree which symbolizes the fulfill-
ment of certain standard requirements in the process
of education and personal development. But is this
my only goal? I would like to evaluate those concepts
which have challenged me to seek, work towards and
complete my college education and the goals which I
eventually hope to achieve. .

A logical basis of the evaluation is the meaning and
purpose of education. Education is the accumulation
of those essentials which are necessary for the develop-
ment of a human from infancy to mature adulthood. In
particular, I feel that it consists of developing a code
of ethics, the ability to be a good citizen, the knowledge
to assume responsibilities in the advancement of society,
and above all, the individual’s sense of values. All of
these phases of education must be completed before
a person reaches the stage where he can truly be con-
sidered as an educated person.

In recent years, educational administrators have
preached the gospel of the “total education” and the
“well-rounded” individual. University undergraduates
have been made aware of industry’s search in employ-
ment for the individual who not only has the knowledge
and background necessary for a position in that
company, but also one who has participated in extra-
curricular activities. This supposedly is evidence of that
person's ability to get along with and be a leader of
people. I contend that this is not necessarily true. As
a result of this emphasis, students will become a member
of an organization in order to be able to have-something
to write in the activity column on any employment
application blanks which he might fill out in the future.
He may even go as far as to accept a responsibility in
this organization to add to his prestige and probably
in the future, his salary. Yet, even though he has con-
tributed valuably to these organizations, he has not
further developed his attitudes and values. Thus, he has
not really changed his personality and qualifications for
consideration as an educated man.

What is an educated man? How is this goal reached?
This whole concept is based upon the individual’s at-
titudes and his values.

A person who seeks education for the furtherance
of his materialistic well-being is way off track. In the
ﬁrst place, an educated man is not concerned with
the material things in life. Naturally, no person can
completely ignore materialism in our society. There is
a very definite need for food, shelter, and clothing.

The danger of materialism lies in placing the factors
of life sustenance and human pleasures before every-
thing else. This can be true on a part-time basis as well
as a full-time basis. Providing volunteer service oc-
casionally is only putting up a front, pretending to have
a concern for others in our own spare time. Here,
materialism still is a pronounced influencing factor on
our actions.

A truly educated person will not place emphasis on

DECEMBER 1958

such factors at any time. His primary concern will be
doing his share in the advancement of society. For this,
a requirement is factual knowledge and the ability,
interest, and desire to use his talents, with which every-
one is supplied. Therefore, he must first of all seek
facts and learn to use his talents. This preparation is
available at institutions of higher learning from high
schools and colleges to libraries and research founda-
tions. This will fulfill one of the requirements.

Another requirement is the ability to act as a good
citizen and get along with people. For this, a code of
ethics is necessary. Each society and each individual
has his own set of morals and ethics, but their codes
must be adaptable to the placing of one’s self concern
in the background. A person must know how to act
in the presence of" others and become friends. with those
people whom he meets. He must also be prepared to
serve his community and fellow man in any way pos-
sible.

T he ideals and attitudes of an educated man will also
subdue those animal-like characteristics which exist
in every human. In turn, his life will be dominated by
those qualities which will serve to help him fulfill
his role in society. This means not allowing music,
sports, sex, or politics to stir his animal-like emotions
and his personal interests in the foreground. This
means allowing sincerity and friendship to preside over
his actions. These attitudes will make life peaceful
and a pleasure, rather than a burden, to live. What do
these philosophies mean to me as an individual? I am
regularly critized both constructively and destructively
by my classmates, often jokingly, for my participation
in activities and my tendency to develop as many friend-
ships as possible. I decided to study engineering because
I felt an interest and desire to work with. industrial
processes and, through research work, do my best to
contribute to the technical advancement of society.
This education will also provide an opportunity to work
at a job which I will be satisfied and be able to lead
a happy life. I participate in activities to provide an
opportunity to know people and expand my conversa-
tional background. I try to control my desires and
emotions so that I won’t slander, steal from, or in any
other way hurt others.

Contrary to the impression that may be given by the
preceding thoughts, I don’t by any stretch of the imagin-
ation pretend to be an extremely virtuous person. I
seriously doubt the practical possibilities of individuals
obtaining that all-encompassing knowledge and the high
ideals and attitudes of a truely educated man, but this
is something worthy of striving for. A considerable
degree of progress toward this goal would be very en-
riching.

I am convinced that friendships and service to others
are worth their efforts. I’m hoping that someday I'll
be able to be versatile enough to associate with others
wisely, contribute what I can technically, and accept
the challenge of life. It is for these reasons that I am
seeking an education.l

WALL-TO-WALL TV

A new experimental television display screen—
brighter than any previously reported and no thicker
than a picture frame~has moved the idea of “tele-
vision-on-the-wall” a step closer to reality.

Developed by scientists at the Westinghouse Re-
search Laboratories here in Pittsburgh, the new dis-
play screen is an important step in efforts to replace
the bulky, high-vacuum television picture tube with a
ﬂat, bright “solid state” display Screen.

The new Westinghouse display is called an Elf
screen, getting its name from two words: electro-lumi-
nescent panel—man’s newest source of light— and a
ﬂexible, built-in storage and control structure made
of ferroelectric materials.

Present experimental models of the Elf screen are
less than a quarter-inch thick and have a brightness
three times that of a conventional television screen.
The contrast ratio between light and dark areas of
the screen is as high as 200 to 1.

Images can be stored on the Elf screen for several
minutes or, due to the flexibility of the ferroelectric

A “LIGHT CHECKERBOARD” display screen represents
an important step forward in the development of on-the-
wall-television. The screen combines an electroluminescent
panel with a “solid state” device to control it.

storage and control, can be changed many times per
second.

There are no inherent limitations of the size of the
glowing screen; in fact, with appropriate electrolumi-
nescent panels, a display the size of a. window would
be easier to construct than one the size of the usual
television picture tube.

NEW FUELS

Powerful new aviation fuels to deliver longer range
with smaller fuel loads will soon be in use in civilian
and military aircraft. Several types of‘ fuel are now
in production and others are being considered and
tested. The new types of fuel cover the whole range
of aircraft from conventional piston engines to liquid-
fueled rockets.

For jet planes pyrophoric fuels (liquids that ignite
spontaneously in air) seems to produce much better
overall results than any other type tested so far. Three
types of pyrophoric fuels under examination are triethyl
aluminum (TEA), triethyl boron (TEB) and trimethyl
aluminum (TMA). They can be produced in large
volume at reasonable prices and permit the same
amount of thrust to be taken from a smaller, less com-
plicated and more reliable engine than do other fuels.
A ram-jet engine that burns pyrophoric fuel has been
designed for constant altitude target drone or missile
application. It weighs only 18 pounds and can develop
a velocity one and a half times greater than the speed
of sound. A $600 engine is possible compared with a
price of up to $10,000 for a similar unit using conven-
tional fuels.

Another advantage of pyrophoric fuels is that they
virtually eliminate “ﬂameout”, a condition in which
the jet engine goes out in thin air, forcing the pilot
to drop to denser air to relight the jets. Small amounts
of these fuels added to hydrocarbon fuels have been
found to improve burning, reduce Screech in rockets
and allow more reliable operation at higher altitudes.

Sadly enough for proponents of their use pyrophoric
fuels have some unfortunate characteristics. TEA and
TEB are extermely destructive to living tissue and

compounds. Packaging these fuels could eliminite many
problems, but the Navy has not looked kindly on
materials that react with water.

The most widely-publicized of all the high energy
fuel programs was started in 1952 by the Navy, joined
by the Air Force in 1955 and resulted in a major fuel
technology breakthrough in the form of a new series
of hydrogen-carbon-boron compounds retaining much
of the high energy of borons but with more stability and
less toxicity. Boron hydrides, as they are called, have
a high reactivtiy, which means that an aircraft can
fly higher with less danger of ﬂameout.

Although boron hydrides are 50 times more expen-
sive than petroleum-type fuels, they might be used
economically enough in some military planes, especial-
ly long-range bombers. These planes require servicing
en route to a distant target. By removing the need
for refueling, as these compounds might, it might be
possible to eliminate costly bases, personnel and equip-
ment.

GAS THROUGH GLASS

A new diffusion technique which
promises to facilitate greatly the
large scale separation of helium from
gaseous mixtures has been developed
by Bell Telephone Laboratories.
Since the demand for helium has
risen much faster than our ability
to produce it, this new process has a
tremendous commercial value. In-
terest in diffusion is directly related
to work on the possibility of diffu-
sion of moisture and dissolved gases
in submerged cable repeaters under
the high pressures of the ocean floor.

In the new process, helium is sep-
arated from a gaseous mixture by
passing it over silica glass which has
a permeability for helium as much as
1000 times greater than for hydro-
gen, the next most diffusible mate-
rial. Fine capillary tubes of silica
glass are so arranged that the gas
mixture under high pressure ﬂows
around the-outside of the tubes and
the helium is recovered from inside
the capillaries. Diffusion increases
rapidly with rising temperatures and
the tubing will withstand a temper-
ature of 400 degrees Centigrade
for long periods of time without de-
teriorating.

Tes-ts have shown that with a
temperature of 400 degrees Centi-
grade and a pressure differential of
15,000 lbs. per sq. inch, two cubic
yards of tubing will recover 100,000
cu. ft. of helium per day assuming
only a 1 per cent concentration of
helium in the gas mixture. Helium
produced by this one-step method
ranks among the purest gasses that
can be produced.

sons that are not well understood,
the electrical resistance of these sup-
erconductors suddenly drops to one-
millionth of one-billionth of its nor-

Some of these metals are already
being utilized in midget computers
useful for airborne control of rockets
and missiles. These uranium alloys
are the ﬁrst superconductors ever to
contain manganese and iron which
had previously been considered to be

THERMOELECTRICITY
Westinghouse Research scientists
have discovered a new class of ma-
-terials called thermoelectric ma-
terials which can convert heat di-
rectly in-to electricity. Since this is
done simply and without any mov-
ing parts, it has been the object of
intense world-wide research. In the
past, thermoelectric materials which
could withstand the high operating
‘temperature of burning fuel only
had efficiencies of the order of one
per cent. .
Recently, certain semi-conductors
have been found with quite reason-
able thermoelectric eﬂiciencies, but
not at the elevated temperatures at
which power is usually genera-ted.
These new Westinghouse ceramic
type materials operate at promising

' efﬁciency in the 2000 to 3000 degree

Fahrenheit range. The new thermo-
electric materials also have the ad-
vantage of being composed of plenti-
ful and inexpensive substances while
an ultra high degree of purity is
not required.

Application of these new thermo-
electric discoveries will probably be
used in specialized operations where
compactness, light weight and sim-
plicity are more important than effic-
iency for the generation of small
quantities of electric power. Work is
still proceeding and results have been
encouraging with no theoretical

ATOMONITOR

The “Atomonitor,” a machine
which employs radioactivity for the
ﬁrst time to inspect production-line
assemblies for the presence of hidden
vital parts, has been developed by
Nuclear Corp. of America.

The U. S. Army Ordinance Corps
has purchased the first model for
checking artillery-shell fuse heads
to make sure they contain a com-
plete ﬁring-pin assembly. The Ato-
monitor looks for parts that are plat-
ed with 1/ 100th of a microcurie of
radioactive silver which has a half-
life long enough for inspection up
to a year after plating.

A geiger counter in the device
checks each assembly for radioactiv-
ity and if it ﬁnds none, ejects the
defective assembly into a reject bin.
The A-tomonitor has an accuracy of
9,999,999 out of ten million as far as
rejecting incomplete fuse heads that
lack a small radioactive ﬁring pin
support. The absence of this support
can cause malfunction of the shell
and create a hazard for friendly
troops.

Formerly the fuse heads were
inspected by trained personnel that
shook them and listened for a cer-
tain click which indicated that the
ﬁring pin was properly seated. This
procedure was slow and uncertain
and is now being replaced by the
Atomonitor.

WESTINGHOUSE
IS THE BEST PLACE
FOR TALENTED ENGINEERS

There’s a wide variety of engineering and scientiﬁc work for the able
engineer at Westinghouse. The brief stories told in the preceding
advertisements only scratch the surface. A hundred or more other
activities, each as interesting, also demand the services of really
talented engineers. This diversity of opportunity is one of the biggest
reasons for choosing Westinghouse.

There’s still another factor to be considered. At Westinghouse,
you’ll ﬁnd the right kind of climate for solid professional growth. The
only limits to how much a man can add to his knowledge and stature
are his own ability, ambition, and determination. The creative individ-
ual can beneﬁt substantially from one of industry’s most liberal inven-
tion award programs, and the man who seeks more knowledge will
find the opportunity to do so. Since 1927, Westinghouse has recog-
nized the positive value of encouraging self-development.

Incoming college graduates are enrolled in the Student Training
Course, a well-integrated program providing assignments in many
operating divisions; each man ﬁnds the type of work best suited for
him. Thereafter, the opportunities for further study are dependent
upon the kind of career you want.

For those desiring a TECHNICAL career:

GRADUATE STUDY PROGRAM—For graduates of engineering
or the physical sciences, Westinghouse offers a Graduate Study pro-
gram leading to M.S. or Ph. D. degrees. This plan offers the qualiﬁed
individual an opportunity to pursue further graduate work in con-
junction with his regular job.

ADVANCED DESIGN COURSE—This full-time four-month
Westinghouse program, held at the University of Pittsburgh, is
offered to selected engineering and physical science graduates who
demonstrate unusual aptitude in research, design, or development
work.

ADVANCED MECHANICS PROGRAM—For selected mechanical
engineers, Westinghouse, each year, oﬁ'ers a full-time ﬁfteen-month
graduate program in advanced mechanics at the Research Laboratory
in Pittsburgh. Classroom work is held at the University of Pitts-
burgh, and all of it is creditable toward an M.S. degree.

HONORS GRADUATE PROGRAM—For a limited number of
selected men, Westinghouse has a released-time graduate study
program aimed at the fulﬁllment of requirements for Ph. D. degrees.

B. G. LAMME FELLOWSHIPS—Based upon a yearly competition
among outstanding men who are under 35 but who. have been with
the Corporation at least ﬁve years, Westinghouse awards B. G. Lamme
Fellowships for one year’s full-time graduate work on stipend and
salary allowance with all tuition and transportation expenses paid.

For those desiring a MANAGEMENT career:

BUSINESS & MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS——These are pro-
grams of business courses at nine different universities for mature
men in business, particularly graduates in engineering and the
sciences, who have not majored in business administration.

MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM—This program
provides position rotation for more breadth of experience, participa-
tion in advanced management schools for more senior professional
employees, and in-company specialized courses for the development
of executive talents.

If you’re interested in more information about these programs at

The ﬁrst step in producing fuel
pellets is the mixing of a slurry com-
posed of uranium oxide and organic
binders. After being blended in a
king-size electric mixer, the slurry
is then dried and the mixture is fed
into an automatic press. This opera-
tion compacts the powder into ‘pre-
forms’ -that do not crumble easily.
Then the pellets are placed in spe-
cial pans and ‘baked’ to remove all
organic material.

Next the pellets are transferred
to various grinding machines to
achieve the desired ﬁnal dimensions.
Rigid quality control speciﬁcations
are maintained since each pellet
must meet tolerances of less than
one-thousandths of an inch.

After careful examination, the
pellets are inserted into a slim
stainless steel tube. A number of
tiny fuel cylinders are packed end-
to-end inside the entire length

The new ofﬁce copying unit,
known as the Verifax Viscount Cop-

useful to companies requiring cop-
ies of larger originals. This unit is
a successor to the legal size Verifax
Copier which has an improved feed
assembly, a new trimmer guide as-
sembly for 10 inch paper, and makes
the same photo-exact copies as the

Vought offers this range
to the young engineer

At Chance Vought the engineer's assign-
ments range from the depths of the ocean to
the farthest reaches of space... from hard-
ware operating aboard the Navy's nuclear-
armed submarines to space research vehicles
still on the boards.

Here the engineer contributes to projects
such as the record-smashing Crusader jet
fighter series . . . the Regulus missiles . . .
and advanced weapons, details of which are
still classiﬁed.

Under the guidance of the Vought engi-
neer, such weapons take shape. He super-
vises critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.

Engineers with many specialties share these
experiences. Today, for example, Vought is
at work on important projects involving:

SPACECRAFT AND ASTRONAUTICS
ADVANCED PROPULSION METHODS
ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE

Vought’s excellent R&D facilities help the
engineer through unexplored areas. And by
teaming up with other specialists against
mutual challenges, the Vought engineer
learns new ﬁelds while advancing in his own.

The march of electronics into the Space Age is being quickened
as a result of Hughes work in airborne electronics systems.

One such development is the Hughes Electronic Arma-
ment System, which pilots high—speed jet interceptors to
enemy targets, launching Hughes air—to-air guided missiles,
and ﬂies the plane home. Even more sophisticated Electronic
Armament Systems completely outstrip those presently re-
leased for publication.

\X/orking on space satellites, Hughes engineers are active
in the preliminary design of guidance and control systems,
communication and telemetry systems, sensing devices using
infrared, optical and radar techniques.

Data Processors, which monitor hundreds of aircraft and store the
information for high-speed assignment of defense weapons,
comprise one part of an advanced Hughes ground defense system.

Why Lockheed —

Lockheed’s leadership in aircraft is continuing in missiles. The Missile
Systems Division is one of the largest in the industry and its reputation
is attested by the number of high-priority, long-term projects it holds:
the Polaris IRBM, Earth Satellite, Kingﬁsher (Q-5) and the X-7.

To carry out such complex projects, the frontiers of technology in all
areas must be expanded. Lockheed’s laboratories. at Sunnyvale and

Palo Alto, California, provide the most advanced equipment for research
and development, including complete test facilities and one of the

most up-to-date Computing centers in the nation. Employee beneﬁts

are among the best in the industry.

For those who qualify and desire to continue their education, the
Graduate Study Program enables them to obtain M.S. or Ph.D degrees
at Stanford or the University of California, while employed in their
chosen ﬁelds at Lockheed.

Lockheed Missile Systems Division was recently honored at the ﬁrst
National Missile Industry Conference as “the organization that
contributed most in the past year to the development of the art of
missiles and astronauticsf’

PHOTOGRAPHY AT WORK
No. 33 in a Kodak Series

 

The Army’s first operational rotor—tip
propelledjet helicopter——built by Hiller.

The camera has caught the fuel spray
pattern within the rear end of the ram-
jet engine even though passing by at
about 450 miles per hour.

Project:

Inspect rotor tip jets for a whirlybird

Hiller Helicopters wanted facts on the fuel spray pattern of a ram-jet engine
whirling at speeds up to 700 feet per second. Photography got the job.

WHEN HILLER HELICOPTERS of Palo Alto, Cal.
—a pioneer in vertical take-off aircraft-
developed a rotor-tip ram-jet engine, they knew
the fuel spray would be subject to high air velocity
and centrifugal force up to 1200 G’s. Would the
fuel spray be deflected outward and cause the
jet to lose thrust? They wanted to know. So they
set up the camera with its fast eye to catch what
otherwise couldn’t be seen. And they learned the
right angle of air intake and nozzle to obtain the
greatest power.

Using photography in research is an old story
with Hiller~—just as familiar as using it for
improving public relations. It’s an example of
the way photography plays many important roles
in modern-day industry.

Q. Mr. Hill, what can I do to get the
most out of my iob interviews?

A. You know, we have the same
question. I would recommend that
you have some information on what
the company does and why you be-
lieve you have a contribution to
make. Looking over company in-
formation in your placement oﬁice
is helpful. Have in mind some of the
things you would like to ask and try
to anticipate questions that may
refer to your speciﬁc interests.

Q. What information do you try to get
during your interviews?

A. This is where wemust ﬁll in be-
tween the lines of the personnel
forms. I try to ﬁnd out why partic-
ular study programs have been fol-
lowed, in order to learn basic motiva-
tions. I also try to ﬁnd particular
abilities in ﬁelds of science, or math-
ematics, or alternatively in the more
practical courses, since these might
not be apparent from personnel rec-
ords. Throughout the interview we
try to judge clarity of thinking since
this also gives us some indication of
ability and ultimate progress. One
good way to judge a person, I ﬁnd,
is to ask myself: Would he be easy
to work with and would I like to
have him as my close associate?

Q. What part do first impressions play
in your evaluation of people?

A. I think we all form a ﬁrst im-
pression when we meet anyone.
Therefore, if a generally neat ap-
pearance is presented, I think it
helps. It would indicate that you
considered this important to your-
self and had some pride in the way
the interviewer might size you up.

Q. With only academic training as a
background, how long will it be before
I'll be handling responsible work?

Interview with General Electric’s

W. Scott Hill

Manager — Engineering Recruiting

Qualities I Look For

When Recruiting Engineers

A. Not long at all. If a man joins a
training program, or is placed direct-
ly on an operating job, he gets
assignments which let him work up
to more responsible jobs. We are
hiring people with deﬁnite consider-
ation for their potential in either
technical work or the management
ﬁeld, but their initial jobs will be
important and responsible.

Q. How will the fact that I've had to
work hard in my engineering studies,
with no time for a lot of outside activi-
ties, affect my employment possibilities?

A. You’re concerned, I’d guess, with
all the talk of the quest for “well-
rounded men.” We do look for this
characteristic, but being president

of the student council isn’t the only‘

indication of this trait. Through
talking with your professors, for
example, we can determine who
takes the active role in group proj-
ects and gets along well with other
students in the class. This can be
equally important in our judgment.

Q. How important are high scholastic
grades in your decision to hire a man?

A. At G.E. we must have men who
are technically competent. Your
grades give us a pretty good indica-
tion of this and are also a measure
of the way you have applied your-
self. When we ﬁnd someone whose
grades are lower than might be ex-
pected from his other characteristics,
we look into it to ﬁnd out if there
are circumstances which may have
contributed.

Q. What consideration do you give work
experience gained prior tograduation?

A. Often a man with summer work
experience in his chosen academic

ﬁeld has a much better idea of what
he wants to do. This helps us decide
where he would be most likely to
succeed or where he should start his
career. Many students have had to
work hard during college or sum-
mers, to support themselves. These
men obviously have a motivating
desire to become engineers that we
ﬁnd highly desirable.

Q. Do you feel that a man must know
exactly what he wants to do when he is
being interviewed?

A. No, I don’t. It is helpful if he
has thought enough about his in-
terests to be able to discuss some
general directions he is considering.
For example, he might know whether
he wants product engineering work,
or the marketing of technical prod-
ucts, or the engineering associated
with manufacturing. On G-E train-
ing programs, rotating assignments
are designed to help men ﬁnd out
more about their true interests be-
fore they make their ﬁnal choice.

Q. How do military commitments affect
your recruiting?

A. Many young men today have
military commitments when they
graduate. We feel it is to their ad-
vantage and ours to accept employ-
ment after graduation and then ful-
ﬁll their obligations. We have a
limited number of copies of a De-
partment of Defense booklet de-
scribing, in detail, the many ways in
which the latter can be done. Just

STRAIGHT TALK TO ENGINEERS

from Donald W. Douglas, Jr.

President, Douglas Aircraft Company

.I’ve been asked whether non-aeronautical engi-
neers have good prospects for advancement in
the aviation industry.

The answer is yes, deﬁnitely! At Douglas many
of our top supervisory people have moved up from
other engineering specialties. The complexity of
modern aircraft and missiles requires the greatest
variety of engineering skills known to industry.

For example, we now have pressing needs for

engineers in addition to aerodynamicists, physi-
cists and mathematicians. Whatever your back-
ground in the engineering profession may be,
there are prime opportunities in the stimulating

The Tour

Sir:

Being that Pittsburgh is the
heart of the steel industry, I
thought that the article “Let’s
Tour A Steel Mill” was very in-
formative. Many students do not
know enough about the industry
which built Pittsburgh.

I thought that the numerous
amount of pictures made the article
easier to read and follow. Although
the article was short, It was both
informative and interesting.

I think there should be more
articles similar to this one in future
magazines. By the way do girls go

SAGE

Sir:

I think the article on SAGE in
the October issue was well done and
very interesting. At times in pur-
suit of our engineering studies, we
sometimes lose sight of the practical
end products of engineering genius.
The SAGE system development is
a tribute to the engineering pro-
fession as a whole. Here a com-
pletely new defense system was
engineered and designed from the
ground up to fulfill a critical gap
in our nation’s defense. This puts
engineering right where it belongs,
in practical application and de-
velopment.

Comments on Cabinet

Sir:

I wish to compliment your arti-
cle on E & M Cabinet. As a fresh-
man in the Schools of Engineering
and Mines, I have no previous
knowledge of the group or its acti-
vities.

One thing I wish would have
been elaborated on was the way in
which the committee handles its
finances. I also thought that the
positions in the Cabinet and their
functions were clearly defined, and
I am sure that through articles
such as this the engineering stu-
dents will at least know about the
Cabinet even if they aren’t actively
participating in it.

The Heard is Heard
Sir:

Does all religion boil down to
a set of laws and/ or rules? Contrary
to Mr. Weatherford’s opinion (“A
Search To Understand,” SKY-
SCRAPER Oct. ’58), I think not.
It is true that religion, just as any
other functioning organization must
have administrative laws, but these
laws can, and never should be taken

 
   

as the binding power holding one’s
religion together.

Moreover, it is their own faith
that motivates people to accept re-
ligious beliefs, go to Church and
try to live a better Christian life.
Faith in Church rules will not pro-
tect them in the temporal things in
life, but rather a faith in God and
his “all inclusive” powers. If a per-
son has no faith, how can he have
a religion, conversely, if a person
professes to have faith, but no re-
ligion, what does he have? If reli-
gion is, as you say, just a set of
rules, why have so many lasted so
long?

Robert Karl
E.E. ’60

Sir:

Through the past year, I have
noticed a definite trend in your
magazine away from the technical
toward the non-technical. Are you
afraid to print the complicated,
the technical? Is it for fear that
we students will not understand or
grasp such material.

In your last issue, you featured
“A Search To Understand” which
was definitely non-technical. Does
this not belong in some other type
of magazine? I certainly can see
no place for this type of article in
your magazine. Why not give this
space to something of more value?

John Hammer
EE ’60

SK YSCRAPER believes that the
engineer is interested in more than
facts and formulae. “A Search to
Understand” is not our profound
statement of philosophy, but it is
the personal belief of one specific
person. We hope that this series will
not necessarily create controversy,
but rather be a basis for discussion
among" students. — Ed.
