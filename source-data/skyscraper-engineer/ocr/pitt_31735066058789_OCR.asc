the engineer’s
opinion . . .

are you aware?

Building better bridges and highways isn’t our only job.
As engineers we cannot be concerned solely with increasing
technology. Yet, most engineers are only concerned with the
technical aspect of their whole problem. They should also be
aware of the social and moral questions involved. But, how can
a young engineer set out to improve and work with society if
he doesn’t even know its problems? I am fearful that unless
engineers become aware citizens and work to correct our
problems that society will only get worse until it crumbles.

We must become aware of our total environment — that
means everything. To do this takes time in talking with people,
reading and thinking. It takes involvement in doing and saying
things that you believe in. And it takes a desire to be a
responsible person and engineer. You as an individual, are
responsible to me, and to all mankind; and I and all other
individuals are responsible to you. I believe this, maybe you
don’t. But like it or not, we will have much responsibility in
our future jobs — people’s lives may rest on our decision.

Supposedly we are getting ' trained so we can fulfill that
responsibility. But all our paper formulas don’t show us the
profound effects that our work can have on people.

The manufacture of DDT, and its harmful effects on all
living things, can be used as an example of the engineers
responsibility. He cannot be blamed for its manufacture up
until the point when it was proven a detrimental chemical. At
that point, his morality should take precedence over his
immediate concerns and he should refuse to continue
manufacturing the product. If you were working in that plant
now and realized the effects of your product, would you quit,
rather than make something that killed others? Most of you
would probably say, “Well why should I quit, someone else
will only take my place?” or “I have a family and I need my
job security.” All I can say to that type of reasoning is that
you had better do some deep thinking and look at your values!
When you put your material wealth above the lives of other
people then you’re in a bad way, and I feel pity for you. But
more than that, I feel pity for the people you would be
destroying. So I plead to you to realize the totalness of your
responsibility.

We must keep engineering Human. In every problem we
solve we must put emphasis on the human factor. That is, we
must collect information to answer questions such as; can this
effect someone adversely, or who can this help, and what are
the long term effects on man and the environment? It makes
sense to ask these questions along with a general “Why?” If
you understand and deal with all the ramifications of your
decision you will be doing your total job — as a citizen and as
an engineer. If the answers appall you (as they should in
making DDT or napalm) then your morality should guide you,
not your money.

One specific social problem we all face in the United
States is racism. The Black-White issue is not so unrelated to
you, as an engineer, as you may wish to believe. Where you
build your road and factories, or don’t build them; and who
you employ, or don’t employ will probably be an important
decision for you to make someday. Another aspect of this
subject, is the lack of black engineers. In fact,just look at our
own school which is adjacent to a black community. Well,
what do you make of it? Do you think they are all just too
stupid to make the grades? It could be that they’re too smart
to be “dumb engineers.” Or it could be that this system directs
and drives Blacks into non-acadernic areas. As an engineer you
should direct some of your efforts to doing something about
this situation, as you should toward all inequalities in our
society.

You say you don’t have the time to do anything. That’s
like saying you don’t have time to breathe — it’s necessary for
our survival. If you don’t start looking into the problems of
the cities, problems of race, problems of communication,
problems of war, and starvation and hatred — then they will
always be problems.

Damn, I know I am not getting through to you. Please
look around you — that’s all I’m saying. I am asking sincerely,
it’s for your good and mine and everybody elses. I have no
conclusion to my feelings expressed here — the conclusion is
up to YOU.

Please do something,

"On the changing attitude toward

the American environment”

The past decade has witnessed a gradual awakening on the
part of the American public. It has become increasingly
apparent that this country will not survive beyond a few
decades unless stringent measures are taken to control the
pollution of the environment. Why has it taken so long to
acknowledge this fact? To answer this question, one must
consider the attitude we Americans have toward progress.

From the time the Pilgrims first set foot on the North
American coast to the present, it has been accepted that
development was good. To the early pioneers progress was
actually essential, because the wilderness was their greatest
enemy. When the thirteen colonies decided to make
democracy the format of their government, they gave free play
to growth and expansion. In the course of only a few hundred
years America was to become the greatest industrial power in
the world. A

The natural resources did not prove to be boundless,
however. It was probably at the beginning of this century that
men first felt the squeeze being applied. More and more people
were crowding themselves onto the continent, and the natural
wealth was being consumed at a fantastic rate.

Old habits die hard though, and ones that are
three-hundred years old are especially difficult to break. The
cries of conservationists were drowned out by the ever growing
industrial machine. While Americans were content in the
knowledge that their nation was prospering, the ecological
balance of the land was being pulled out from under.
Fortunately, the “negative externalities” of modern
technology cannot be hidden forever from the public.

In response to increasing pressure industry has finally
begun to take action. But this new concern for our
environment has not taken on the sense of a national
obligation as, say, the race to put a man on the moon.
Sufficient funding has not come out of Washington. Without
money for research into waste disposal and pollution control

we cannot hope to cleanse our land. Money, of course, is not
the only necessity for our survival.

New laws to control emissions from factories and
automobiles must be passed on both the State and Federal
levels. Action must be taken against strip miners and those
who dump raw sewage into our rivers. Unless these mandates
are provided, an increasingly smaller proportion of the
population will enjoy what we now call a dignified human
existence.

Another very important point to consider here is the role
that the university plays. To a large degree it is the university
that shapes the technological future. It should not be a factory
designed to turn out robot technicians. An education goes far
beyond the memorization of equations and formulas. Students
must be led to discover that it is more important to be helping
man than it is to be making money. Both the faculty and the
administration should encourage the future engineer to
develop a moral responsibility toward the world. The scientist
can no longer disregard the consequences of new technological
advances.

So in conclusion, the terrible conditions that exist today
can to a large degree be derived from the importance that the
American public has put on progress and the physical
development of the land. To help to alleviate the problems,
the people of the United States, and especially the engineers
and scientists, will have to take on a new attitude toward the
environment. In the future we must continually search for
solutions to remedy and avoid the desecration we are causing
to our homeland. Now that the severity of the problem is
recognized, we have the obligation to act.

To these apathetic students, I would ask that they give some

apparent that extra—curricular activities are strikingly

Deadline March 15, I970

For many years, a small and exclusive organization,
concerning itself with student affairs and curricular
development, has been secretly operated in our midst. I’ve
managed to infiltrate the hierarchy of this phenomenon, and
now it’s time to blow the covers off. With this expose, I shall
describe in detail the intricacies and operations of the
Engineering Student Cabinet. Perhaps you’ve heard about it,
or have even been privileged to participate. This couldn’t be
avoided; with it low budget, the cabinet couldn’t always afford
the best security measures. For those of you who want to find
out how it works, I’ll begin with a description of the Cabinet
structure.

The major portion of the Cabinet consists of an assembly
of three upper-class representatives from each of the eight
departments. The efforts of this group are co-ordinated by an
executive committee, comprised of the Cabinet chairman and
vice-chairman, the secretary, treasurer, and plant director.
Serving as ex-officio voting members of the body are the
editor of the Bulletin and the four elected Student
Government engineering senators. The social activities
sponsored by the Cabinet and handled by the social and the
central planning committees. Other activities and interests are
co-ordinated through the outstanding senior, constitution,
athletic-, faculty evaluation, publications, and curriculum
Committees. In addition to these, cabinet representatives
belong to all of the faculty standing committees including the
Engineering Undergraduate Administrative Council, the
Standing Committee on Undergraduate Programs, Biomedical,
Instruments and Instrumentation, Student Aid Safety,
Library, Computers and Computation, International Programs,
and Seminar Evaluation committees. The assembly meets at
noon on Tuesdays to conduct an hour-long business meeting.
The members of the various committees carry out their duties
beforehand, so that progress reports can be made to the body
at large. Hopefully every member serves not only as an elected
representative, but also as an active part of the committee
program.

Recent accomplishments exemplify the types of con-
tributions the Cabinet has made to the current state of affairs
in the Engineering School. Early last fall, when the issue of
ROTC accreditation was brought before the faculty, several
members of the Cabinet expressed the opinion, in behalf of
the representatives, that the ROTC program should continue
to be recognized in Engineering. The faculty not only agreed
to continue to acknowledge ROTC but to grant additional
credit to students completing the advanced courses.

In the area of academic discipline, the Cabinet designed
and brought into creation a student-faculty judicial board,

10

The Purpose of

Engineering Cabinet

By DICK EDGECOMBE

whose purpose is to review all problems concerned with
academic honesty. The board includes four students and three
faculty justices. Fortunately, no cases have been presented in
the four months since its origin.

The Cabinet inﬂuence recently effected curricular policy
with the introduction of the Satisfactory-Unsatisfactory
option in the area of course distribution. As a result of joint
student-faculty research and consultation, it is now possible to
receive a no-grade S or U in place of A-B-C (for S) and D-F
(for U) in elective subjects. The details of the policy have been
spelled out in a memorandum prepared by both EUAC and
the Cabinet members.

Of course, each year the Cabinet supervises Engineers’
Week, four days in March of fun and games for the entire
school. The week’s activities include the arrival (a parade), a
gimmick, game night, lab demonstrations, parents’ visitation, a
service project, and lastly, the Shamrock Ball. Every one of the
eight departments competes for the overall Engineers’ Week
trophy.

The volume of information generated by the variety of
Cabinet interests must be disseminated to the entire student
body. A bi-weekly publication, the Bulletin, provides a wide
range of material concerning the recent developments of the
various interest groups within the School of Engineering. It
enables both students and faculty to express opinions for
school-wide coverage. The Cabinet depends on the Bulletin to
inform the students of the issues with which the body at large
concerns itself each week.

Of course, in order to begin to understand and appreciate
the functions of the Student Cabinet, one must consider the
basic purposes and principles of any student government. At
one time, the Cabinet’s major consideration was the success of
the annual Engineers’ Week. The scope of the Cabinet interests
has grown to the point where it now stimulates and
co-ordinates all types of student involvement. The success with
which a campus government achieves its goals is determined by
the degree of individual student participation and concern.

The efforts of any student government should afford
students the opportunity to become involved with the
institutions and processes of change which affect their
immediate lives and those around them. As new trends in
academic policy unfold, the interests and opinions of the
students must carry a decisive influence with the faculty and
administration. The students themselves are certainly qualified
to provide accurate insights into the problems of the
educational process. The undergraduate perspective is of
definite value to those who are responsible for the
decision-making.

What  Can Do . . .

Lady Pittsburgh is a swinging matron who took up
smoking in her youth and nearly died of the habit two decades
ago when her booming industries darkened the skies with
billowing smoke.

In 1941 she almost kicked the habit when a new tougher
Smoke Control Ordinance was passed by the city. But World
War II came along, and Lady Pittsburgh suffered a relapse. She
continued to huff and puff through the Booming Fifties and
Swinging Sixties.

Today, Lady Pittsburgh is under close “doctor’s care” to
see that she cuts down.

Riding herd on her are the three county commissioners of
Allegheny County who approved a new air pollution control
ordinance in December. Industry is no longer responsible for
cleaning up the air; the power now rests in the hands of a
Board of Appeals and Variances appointed by the three
commissioners.

. . . About This

by Esther Kitzes

If, in the Board’s opinion, industries or companies do not
work hard enough to meet the new tough anti-air pollution
regulations, they are liable to a court injunction which would
bring a fine, close the plant or even imprison company
officials.

The new air pollution control rules and regulations
(Article XVII Allegheny County Health Department adopted
December 17, 1969 and approved by the three commissioners
a few weeks later) were adopted five months after state and
county hearings and intense lobbying by Pittsburgh citizens’
groups who represent the new tidal wave 01
environment-conscious people dedicated to cleanse the air,
land and water of America.

One of the most vigorous and effective lobbyists for clean
air in Pittsburgh is GASP, Group Against Smog and Pollution,
a citizens’ conglomerate of scientists, attorneys, doctors,
professors, environmental specialists, engineers, housewives,

union leaders, senior citizens and students.

GASP, headed by dynamic, tireless Mrs. Henry Madoff (an
asthmatic, whose husband is a chest surgeon) invites anyone
“with lungs” to join them.

Three University of Pittsburgh students answered the
invitation, and, in turn, organized a campus branch, Pitt
Chapter of GASP.

The GASPER’s student chairmen are Stephen Gomes,
Stephen Wiel and Mitchell Bloom, all students at the Graduate
School of Public and International Affairs.

Wiel is a chemical engineer who spent seven years in
research and development in the aerospace industry and is now
working toward a Ph.D. in Public Administration and Urban
Affairs.

Gomes is an airport planner and computer programmer
with several years experience in aviation systems management.
He is currently completing his requirements for a Ph.D. in
Public Administration with a minor in transportation.

Bloom is a former research physicist and is now a doctoral
candidate in Public Administration. He is currently developing
a management information system for the Community Action
of Pittsburgh concentrated employment program for his Ph.D.
dissertation.

Says GASPER Gomes: “Students keep talking about
relevancy. Well, here is one area of action in which they can
use their talents. We want students to use political pressure
techniques -- meetings, lectures, pamphleteering, letter writing,
and rallies, to get the new anti-pollution laws enforced.”

Says Stephen Wiel: “We have one of the best sets of
anti-pollution laws in the nation here in Allegheny County --
thanks to the citizens’ pressure groups. But it is not worth the
paper it is printed on if it isn’t enforced.”

The Pitt Chapter of GASP has already swung into action.
In February, a GASP member, Mitchell Pines (who also serves
as business manager of THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER)
operated a sulfur dioxide monitoring machine at a day-long
session on environmental pollution staged by the YWCA in
cooperation with the College of Arts and Sciences, the Biology
Department and the University and City Ministries.

Pines is a senior majoring in aerospace engineering. He
operated the monitoring device to draw attention to one area
in pollution enforcement where students can be effective, i.e.
monitoring the air pollution monitors of Allegheny County.

At present, Allegheny County’s Bureau of Air Pollution
Control is expanding its air monitoring program. According to
a paper presented last July by former Air Pollution Control
Chief Edward L. Stockton, he wrote “In 1938 during WPA
days, the City of Pittsburgh initiated an air pollution sampling
program which consisted of eight stations, each equipped with
a dustfall can and sulfate candle. This sampling program was
expanded into the remainder of Allegheny County in 1949.
There has been a further expansion of the number of these
stations until in 1969 there were 32 stations where lead
candles are used and 44 sites where dustfall cans are employed
to monitor air contaminants.”

It became obvious in the mid Sixties that this method of
air monitoring “was most inadequate” to meet the needs of
the Air Pollution Control program. Subsequently, in late 1965,
the Bureau of Air Pollution Control developed a plan for a
completely automated air monitoring network.

As of February 1970, the network is far from completed.
In many areas monitoring is no more effective than the earlier
one of thirty day sample data from dustfall cans and sulfate
candles.

It is here that GASP students can step in and be effective,
says Gomes. Plans are being developed to have Night Raiders --

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNE|:'.'R_FEBRUARY,1970

students who will patrol the known polluted areas at night,
and report on possible violations by industries that are
suspects of emptying “their stacks” after the 5 p.m. work day
ends for the county air pollution monitor employees. This
information will be gathered and forwarded to a central
Pollution Information Center. The Variance Board will then be
informed of persistent violators.

GASP can turn to other campuses to see what students by
the thousands are doing across the country in their fight
against pollution.

At Stanford and the University of Texas, law students
research new court room stratagems against environmental
polluters. At the University of Arizona, students
surreptitiously collected data on fume emissions of copper
smelting operations. At the University of Illinois, Students for
Environmental Control hauled six tons of refuse from a nearby
creek. At the University of Washington, students prepared an
80-page report on ecological problems of Puget Sound. At
Boston University, Ohio State and Colby College,
environmental courses have been introduced into the
curriculum. At Carnegie-Mellon University, a chemistry
professor has assigned a study of air pollution in Allegheny
County as the entire class project. The study report should be
available in May.

The anti-pollution forces are gaining such momentum, and
spawned so many new programs, that Everett M. Hafner, dean
of the school of natural science and mathematics at Hampshire
College hopes to publish a directory of environmental study
programs later this year and to establish a clearinghouse for
those who are developing such programs.

Some of these are advanced courses, according to The
Chronicle of Higher Education. “For example, San Diego State
College has developed a program in ‘systems ecology,’ teaching
students to use computers to analyze environmental problems.
During their sophomore and junior years, students take
introductory statistics and environmental courses. They plan a
research project, studying an aspect of ecology and pollution,
which they carry out during the summer between their junior
and senior years.

“Using the data gathered during the summer the students
take courses in the use of statistical methods in biology and
the structure of ecological systems during the first semester of
their senior year.

“During the last semester, they participate in seminars in
which their research is evaluated, and they discuss the
applications of systems analysis to environmental problems.”

Some members of GASP are approaching their biology
professors inquiring if an interdisciplinary major can be set up
in ecology at Pitt. Their request will not be unique, for some
colleges are devoting whole schools and departments to
environmental studies. At California State College at
Bakersfield, J. R. Coash, the school’s dean says: “The
curriculum has been developed on the assumption that science
may be defined as the study of the evolution of the
environment, from particle to galaxy, from microbe to man.”

The three universities at North Carolina may serve as a
guide for the universities and colleges in the Pittsburgh area,
one Pitt professor pointed out. There, Duke University, the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina
State University will exchange information, faculty members
and services and will offer advanced courses in air pollution.
This consortium is the first of several to be funded by the
federal government. They plan to make their research findings
available to community groups and to provide technical advice

Liberal Education:

Profitable?

Have engineers underestimated the value of a liberal
education? Facts seem to indicate that although there is an
increasing need to include courses on the humanities and social
sciences in the curriculum, engineering students have
traditionally avoided such courses.

There are numerous areas where American engineers can
feel justifiable pride in their accomplishments. Indeed, the
French industrialist J. J. Servan-Schreiber states, “Advanced
technology and management skills have raised per capita
production in the United States to a level 40 per cent above
that of Sweden (next highest), 60 per cent above Germany, 70
per cent above France and 80 per cent above Britain.”

But this advanced technology has also placed man in a
critical situation. It can save as well as destroy him. One of the
most cited predictions about the 70’s is that man must begin
to control his accelerating technology. These alternatives give
the engineer tremendous responsibilities and opportunities
which will effect not only us in the U.S., but the international
community of nations, rich and poor, mighty and militarily
dependent.

Some engineers protest that they have no control over
company policy formulation. However, B.R. Sarchet predicts
that, “Corporations of today are so technically oriented that
by 1980 more than 50 per cent will be headed by men with an

‘engineering background. The bulk of the lower echelon

decision-making and supervisory jobs will also be in their
hands.”

On the management level, inevitable factors enter the
picture, for example: Can the development of the ABM system
for U.S. missle silo protection be separated from U.S.-Soviet
foreign policy?; Can the construction of a bridge in Africa be
separated from questions of the political and economic
stability of the government?; Can the development of
expensive oil refineries be separated from the history of
military-dictatorship take over?; Can foreign contracts be
separated from the foreign policy questions of tariffs and the
international balance of payments?

It can be expected then that the future impact of the
corporation on society will significantly be in the hands of
engineers in the neat future. With this in mind, it seems
essential that the engineering student combine with his
increasing technical competence a highly developed
philosophy of life, a sense of human values over the globe, and
aknowledge of the social processes. These are, of course, not
acquired by osmosis but require some efforts. The benefits
should make such effort worthwhile for the individual and
society as well.

Let us now evaluate the engineering curriculum on our
campus as to the availability of obtaining a liberal education.
The four-year engineering program has indeed become a kind
of liberal science program. It is becoming more general in
nature and more diverse in terms of materials covered. The
number of elective courses that can be taken on a four-year

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER_FEBRUARY,197O

by Charles M. Thompson

program is at an optimum in that his engineering prerequisites
are not sacrificed. Also the tendency for the Reserve Officer
Training Corp to cut the heart out of the elective courses has
been markedly eliminated.

However, the number and quality of elective courses do
not, in themselves, insure participation. Indeed there seems to
be a lack of motivation in regard to course work in the
humanities and social sciences. This opinion was reinforced by
several statistical and physical studies. One of the most
noteworthy was conducted by James W. Trent and Janet
Rayle, who hypothesized that “engineering is likely to attract
the individual who seeks out direct sure lines to follow in life.
This kind of individual tends to enter a profession where he
need not be confused with the tensions and anxieties of
conflicting, ambiguous, or novel ideas, where he can avoid
satisfactions from tangible accomplishments which are less
apparent in the more abstract professional roles.”

Another interesting article by C.E. Goshen considers that
fact that although there are engineering students who entered
engineering because of an outstanding performance in their
science and mathematics courses in high school, there were
large numbers of others about “whom it would be more
correct to conclude that they were guided to engineering by
virtue of their having done poorly in other subjects (English,
language, history, etc.). Similarly in college their choice of
subjects — to the extent to which it was governed by their own
likes and dislikes — led them into mathematics and physical
sciences rather than the humanities and social sciences because
of their distaste for the latter.”

At a time when radical automated changes are taking
place, are engineering students unduly narrow in their
approach to life? If so, doubts arise as to whether future
engineers will be qualified to direct this change in the best
interest of society. We as engineers need all the help and
knowledge we can get to adopt as broad a focus as we can so
that we will one day not regret the route we have made
ourselves.

It's a custom in some quarters to have a
child's first pair of shoes bronzed. Around
Jim MacKenzie's house, you're more likely
to find pairs of skates in bronze. Thirteen
pairs, in fact.

By title, Jim's a Special Assistant to the
President of the Business Products Group.
Off the job, he's also concerned with
development. The development of
youngsters. . . his own and others. It's a
sizable task. He and his wife have 13
children of their own (7 girls and 6 boys).
“And they all skate” says Jim proudly.
“Y'see, I was born in Canada where
youngsters learn to skate as soon as they
can walk. Long ago, I decided that if I was
going to work with young people, I might
as well do it in an area I was proficient in.
That way I could contribute more."

Since Jim arrived in Rochester, he's been
active in the Genesee Figure Skating Club
and the Junior Lions Hockey Club program.
The latter program now has almost 500
boys between 6 and 18 years of age.

“We have all sorts of youngsters in the
programs. Not just the deprived ones from
the inner-city area, but also those whose
families have monetary advantages. Our

programs are open to everybody. I feel it's
equally important for all youngsters to
develop physically and to build a sense of
what teamwork can do not only in sports
but in life."

Ask the boys and girls and they'll tell you
Jim MacKenzie’s quite a guy. We agree. We
like to attract engineers who can see
beyond engineering. Who can spot a need
and help fill it. Who can put their talents
to work for the benefit of others.

If you're this kind of engineer, we'd like to
talk to you. Your degree in Engineering or
Science may qualify you for some intriguing
openings in a broad spectrum of
developmental and manufacturing areas.

We're located in suburban Rochester, New
York. See your Placement Director for a
copy of our brochure and for the date of
our scheduled campus interviews. Or, write
directly to Mr. Roger VanderPloeg,

“Chief right. NCR computer much faster!”

Although we haven't really tried to see what our computers could do with smoke signals, NCR engineers have
made some amazing things happen.

Consider our NCR printer, for example. The hammers are actually put into free flight, like ballistic missiles,
and stopped by precisely adjustable controls. During their movement in free flight, they reach an accelera-
tion many times as great as that of a rocket lifting off its launching pad. These hammers contact the paper
less than 100 millionths of a second.

If that kind of technology goes into our computer peripherals, consider the engineering of our computers
themselves. lsn’t this the kind of work you’d find interesting? See the NCR representative when he visits your

AND VISIBILITY
UNLIMITED

At Pratt & Whitney Aircraft “ceiling and visibility unlimited” is not just an expression. For example,
the President of our parent corporation joined P&WA only two years after receiving an engineering
degree. The preceding President, now Chairman, never worked for any other company. The current
President of P&WA started in our engineering department as an experimental engineer and moved
up to his present position. In fact, the majority of our senior officers all have one thing in common-
degrees in an engineering or scientific field.

To insure CAVU*, we select our engineers and scientists carefully. Motivate them well. Give them
the equipment and ‘facilities only a leader can provide. Offer them company-paid, graduate educa-
tion opportunities. Encourage them to push into fields that have not been explored before. Keep

them reaching for a little bit more responsibility than they can manage. Reward them well when
they do manage it.

Your degree can be a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL - AERONAUTICAL o ELECTRICAL o
CHEMICAL o CIVIL o MARINE o INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING o PHYSICS o CHEMISTRY - METAL-
LURGY - MATERIALS SCIENCE - CERAMICS - MATHEMATICS o STATISTICS “o COMPUTER
SCIENCE o ENGINEERING SCIENCE o ENGINEERING MECHANICS.

Consult your college placement officer—or write Mr. William L. Stoner, Engineering Department,
Pratt St Whitney Aircraft, East Hartford, Connecticut 06108.

CAVU* might also mean full utilization of your technical skills through a wide range of challenging
programs which include jet engines for the newest military and commercial aircraft, gas turbines for
industrial and marine use, rocket engines for space programs, fuel cells for space vehicles and terrestrial
uses, and other advanced systems.

Engineering + Medicine

= Biomechanics

INTRODUCTION

Biomechanics might be defined simply as the application
of the principles of mechanics to living biological entity. The
role of mechanics in biomechanics problems is similar to its
place in engineering. The principles of statics are used to
determine forces in muscles, tendons, bones and joints with
the body at rest. Dynamics is required for analysis of the body
in motion and when it is subjected to vibration and impact.
Analysis in this area is quite complex since the human body is
not rigid, (a condition which is generally assumed in
engineering problems), has a complex geometry, and is
generally anisotropic. The theory of elasticity, fluid
mechanics, and dynamics, heat transfer, thermodynamics,
diffusion and membrane theory, and chemical processes are
basic to understanding the circulatory system, the pulmonary
system, renal function, all phases of the digestive system and
many others. Electrical and control theory can be applied in
the analysis of this complex integrated nervous and control
system.

Information regarding the mechanical behavior of the
body and its parts is required for design in many fields. It is
necessary, for example, for the proper design of substitutes for
lost members, or for missing parts such as the head of the
femur, or for a replacement of the knee joint. The resultsof
this kind of research are also useful in designing assistive
devices for members which are present but have lost their
normal function because of muscular injury or disease.

An understanding of the tolerance of the body to
vibration and to impact from various directions is necessary
for the whole body and also for its component parts and
internal organs. This includes long time and short time
tolerance at levels where no interference with normal function
occurs, where injury threshold begins, where survivable injury
takes place, and where the impact or vibration is lethal. This
information is useful in such widely diverse areas such as the
design of aircraft pilot seats and astronaut couches. It is also
necessary for ejection seat design and for the design of aircraft
and automobile seats to protect passengers against severe
impact forces.

Methods of locating foreign growths within the body, the
design and development of diagnosive and therapeutic devices,
the development of heart assist or heart replacement devices,
and the investigation of injury to the head—neck system are
other important examples of research in the area of
biomechanics.

Biomechanics at the University
of Pittsburgh

The interest in biomechanics research at the University of
Pittsburgh was initiated in 1961 by the Department of
Mechanical Engineering and the Plastic Surgery Section of the
School of Medicine. This interest came about by means of a
cooperative research project between the two departments
regarding the determination of the mechanical properties of
biological materials such as skin, muscle, tendon, bone and
scar tissue. By means of this first cooperative venture between
engineering and medicine, other research programs between
the Department of Mechanical Engineering and the School of
Medicine have also developed. Some of the present include:

1. Design and Development of Fluidic Actuated Heart
Replacement. Device (Mechanical Engineering
Department -- Department of Surgery).

Department of Surgery).

For several years, Professor Norman H. Wackenhut,
Research Professor of Mechanical Engineering, and Dr.
George J. Magovern, Associate Professor of Surgery at
the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, have
been collaborating on the design and construction of a
mechanical heart. The rationale upon which this
artificial heart is based may be summarized as follows.

a. The components must be small in size and light
in weight so they can be implanted in the chest
or abdominal region.

b. The artificial heart should closely approximate
the essential pumping functions of the natural
heart. These include a pulsatile cardiac out put
(blood flow rate) of adequate quantity and
pressure, minimal damage to red corpuscles and
minimal tendency to form blood clots, and

33

A fluidics system is integral to the implantable heart pump
devised by Professor Norman Wackenhut. It is this system
which will create the pulsatile pressure to activate the
ventricles of the heart system. The heart pump is still in the
experimental stage, and has only been used on animals.

ventricular blood flow outputs which are equal
on the average, and which are dependent upon
their venous (filling) pressure.

c. Maximum reliability of all components. This
implies simplicity and minimization of moving
parts.

Presently this criteria is being satisfied by an
artificial heart which consists of a closed hydraulic
system. The working fluid (water) is circulated by a
centrifugal pump and a fluidics pulse generator is
utilized to convert the steady flow from the centrifugal
into the pulsatile force necessary to obtain the desired
cardiac output.

In the initial experimental animal applications, total
function of the heart has been taken over for five
hours with immediate survival. The research thus far

34

indicates that all parameters of physiological function
measured (blood pressure, blood gases, blood Ph,
kidney and central nervous function) indicate the unit
is capable of supplanting heart function -- but
additional refinements are necessary before human
application.

. Investigation of the Feasibility of Auto-Generated

Tissue as a Heart Valve Replacement Material
(Mechanical Engineering Department -- Department of
Surgery, Oakland Veterans Hospital).

During the past year, Dr. Roy D. Marangoni,
Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering, and Dr.
Daniel Emerson, Clinical Assistant Professor of Surgery
of the School of Medicine, have been investigating the
mechanical properties of auto-generated tissue.
Auto-generated tissue is obtained by the implantation
of a foreign substance or object (such as
polyetheyelene mold) into the body. Immediately
after implantation, the body attempts to “reject” this
foreign object by coating or covering it with a
protective layer of synthetic or auto-generated tissue.

The use of cardiac valves formed from such tissues
is believed to have some definite advantages over the
use of usual mechanical prosthetic valves in cardiac
valve replacement. One of these advantages is that the
auto-generated tissue concept permits the actual
growth or formation of the valve to take place in the
body of the individual whose valve is to be replaced.
This, it is believed, will hopefully reduce the possibility
of the rejection of the valve by the body and thereby
increase the probability of success of the cardiac valve
replacement.

At the present time, this research program is
concerned with determining the mechanical properties
of tissues obtained from molds constructed from
materials such as polyetheyelene and acrylic
compounds and comparing these properties with those
obtained from actual cardiac valves. Once these studies
have been completed it will be possible to determine
the feasibility of the use of such tissue as a cardiac
valve replacement material.

. Investigation of the Mechanism Causing Injury to the

Head Neck System During Impact (Dr. Alan A. Glaser
and Dr. Roy D. Marangoni - Department of Mechanical
Engineering -- Dr. Anthony Susen, Department of
Neurosurgery).

One of the most serious health problems of our
time is that of injury produced when the head is sub-
ject to impact loadings or rapid decelerations. Among
the most notable agents producing these injuries
are accidental falls, automotive accidents, and acts of
physical violence, and although these agents have been
with us for many decades, it has been only recently
that a concerted effort has been undertaken to study
their relationship to injury and the actual mechanisms
causing head injury. The efforts of the National
Highway Safety Bureau, the Federal Aviation
Administration, and the various automobile and
aircraft companies to study, design, and apply
optimum packaging procedures for vehicle occupants
represent an important aspect to this problem.
However, muchwork remains to be done as indicated
by papers presented at the Head Injury Conference at
the University of Chicago in 1966 and at the 11th
Stapp Car Crash Conference in 1967. As indicated at
this conference, this work can best be accomplished by

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEEI-'\‘_FEBRUARY, 1970

an interdisciplinary effort of medical scientists and
engineers.

The aim of this program is to investigate the
important factors which cause head and neck injury
such as brain and skull damage resulting from head
impact, whiplash, and collisions. Due to the
impossibility of conducting tests on actual invivo
subjects, the research effort involved here consists of
the construction of physical models and the
determination of mathematical models necessary for
unveiling the physical mechanisms involved in
producing head injury. The results of this research it is
hoped will provide new insight into the mechanism of
head injury and eventually advanced methods for both
the protection against and prevention of head injury.

4. Investigation of the Kinematics and Dynamics of Hand

Motion (Professor Thomas G. Beckwith, Mechanical
Engineering Department -- Dr. William L. White, Plastic
Surgery Section of the School of Medicine.
Man’s concern for his hands must be as old as man
himself for his preeminence in the animal kingdom is
unquestionably derived, at least in part, from their
structure and proper functioning. It may be argued
that the dependence of man’s well being on his hands
is secondary only to his dependence on the vital
organs. It follows, therefore, that an individual’s
efficiency and his ability to function as a productive
person is very greatly determined by normally
functioning hands. Quoting S. Bunnell from a 1944
textbook on hand surgery, “To diagnose and
reconstruct a crippled hand, we should have intimate
knowledge of the anatomy, mechanics, and physiology
of the normal hand.” It is important that as much as
possible be learned about the proper normal
functioning of the hand.
Although much anatomical and physiological work
related to the hand has been done by researchers in the
medical profession, only a beginning has been made in
treating it from the standpoint of engineering analysis,
i.e., treating the hand as a mechanical structure or‘
machine. It is the basic purpose of this research
program to contribute to the understanding of the
functioning of the hand through applied engineering
analysis, thereby aiding both the medical profession in
its treatment of the hand, and the engineering
profession in devising better prothesis devices.
This interest in biomechanics research programs has not
been a sole effort on the part of the Department of Mechanical
Engineering. The School of Engineering has encouraged,
promoted and fostered interdisciplinary programs so that at
the present time each engineering department has several such
research programs in the more general area of biomedical
engineering. Some of these include:
(1) Biomaterials Research--Materials and Metallurgical
Engineering Department

(2) Water and Air Pollution Studies--Civil Engineering
Department and the School of Public Health

(3) Factors Affecting the Quality of Nursing
Care--Industrial Engineering Department and the
School of Nursing

(4) Modelling of the Dynamic Responses of Adrenal
Cortex to Corticotropin--Electrical Engineering
Department and the Department of Physiology of the
School of Medicine

(5) Investigation of the Transport Properties of a
Protein-Lipid-Protein Membrane, Which simulates the

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER_FEBRUARY, 1970

Structure of a Plasma Membrane of Living
Cells--Chernical Engineering.

The importance of these programs is obvious because of
their critical nature with regard to our present society and the
need for their immediate solution. It is hoped that these
cooperative efforts in Bio-Medical Engineering will contribute
greatly towards their solution.

A member of the Mechanical Department, Dr. Roy Marangoni,
has designed this experiment to describe what might happen to
the human skull on impact.

Venture:_
Seven m|n_utes
to save a life.

The problem: lifesaving clinical tests
of blood, urine and spinal fluid may take
technicians hours to perform using tra-
ditional methods.

The possible solution: design a virtu-
ally complete chemical laboratory in a
desk—sized cabinet that will perform a
variety of clinical tests automatically,
accurately, quickly.

The result: Du Pont's Automatic
Clinical Analyzer, the end-product of
years of cooperation and problem solving
among engineering physicists, biochem-
ists, electromechanical designers, com-
puter specialists and many, many others.

The heart of the instrument is a trans-
parent, postcard-sized reagent packet
that functions as a reaction chamber and
optical cell for a computer-controlled
analysis of specimens.

Separate packs—made of a chemically
inert,optical|y clear p|astic—are designed
for a variety of tests. And each pack is
supplied with a binary code to instruct
the analyzer. Packs for certain tests also
contain individual disposable chroma-
tographic columns to isolate specific
constituents or molecular weight frac-
tions on the sample.

In operation, the analyzer automatically
injects the sample and diluent into each
pack, mixes the reagents, waits a preset
time forthe reaction, then forms a precise
optical cell within the walls of the trans-
parent pack and measures the reaction
photometrically.

A built-in solid-state computer monitors
the operation, calculates the concentra-
tion value for each test and prints out a
report sheet for each sample. The instru-
ment is capable of handling 30 differ-
ent tests, the chemistry procedures for
ten of which have already been devel-
oped. The first test result is ready in
about seven minutes. And in continuous
operation, successive test results are
obtained every 35 to 70 seconds, de-
pending on the type of test.

lnnovation—app|ying the known to
discover the unknown, inventing new
materials and putting them to work, using
research and engineering to create the
ideas and products of the future—this is
the venture Du Pont peopleareengaged in.

on combating pollution.

From selling “GASP for Clean Air” buttons, to being
Night Riders, to planning new courses and curriculums, it is
apparent that the student chapter of GASP has an excuting
and varied choice of programs and projects it can sponsor.

For Pitt students who believe -that happiness is a running
stream and not a stagnant pool, there is GASP. Gomes invites
students and faculty, and other members of the University
community to join the group. Headquarters on campus are in
Room 403 Bruce Hall. Inquiries can also be addressed by
writing to “GASP” P.O. Box 2850, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15230.

(Purpose of Cabinet. continued )

Organized student government must see that the feelings
and concerns of the students are properly channelled to the
authorized administration and faculty. By adhering to a
systematic method of problem-solving, a student government
can insure that reason and not coe__rcion is used to deal with
administration - faculty - student‘ affairs. It is necessary,
therefore, that the student government be accessible to each
and every member of the student body. Only by serving its
total constituency can a student government even begin to
represent the best interests of the student body. By being
well-known and understood, the student government can
realize one of its primary objectives, to elevate the role of the
student as an individual within the university. When dealing
with faculty and administration, each student must accept the
responsibilities implied by self governance.

The Engineering Student Cabinet attempts to serve the
needs of the student body in several ways. It benefits the
school primarily as the recognized mode of student expression.
Since four Cabinet members now attend all faculty meetings,
with full voting privileges, the opinions and ideas of the
students can be presented directly to the power source. At
these faculty sessions, the student representatives must be

prepared to subject themselves to all kinds of criticism, pro or
con. With this in mind, these Cabinet members are expected to
diligently prepare a set of arguments for every pertinant issue.

As conflicts in‘ the School of Engineering arise, the
Cabinet must attempt to open all questions to inquiry,
deliberation, and debate. The students are encouraged to
register their opinions with their respective representatives
who will, in turn, present these points of view at the assembled
Cabinet meetings. The members who serve as representatives
to the various faculty - administrative committees provide an
invaluable source of information which is applicable to many
of the problems that are encountered. Using all the available
facts at hand, Cabinet tries to resolve each issue and find
solutions to problems as quickly as possible. The job is not
complete, however, until Cabinet provides the information
about those decisions affecting the education and well-being of
the student body, the rationale behind them, and the events
which led to each course of action.

The Student Cabinet faces an awesome responsibility. The
objectives of student power have given way to a much greater
need, that of student awareness. As members of the student
body, we must exercise our ability to make the important
decisions which shape our individual experiences at Pitt. In
this way, we students will become fully aware of the
consequences of our judgment. Student Cabinet is dedicated
to this purpose: the wants and needs of every individual in the
School of Engineering must be fulfilled in the most equitable
manner. Cabinet is prepared to be of service to any student
who is willing to express himself.

Therein lies the challenge to the members of our student
body. Don’t hesitate to exert your individuality in the quest
for a meaningful education. Somewhere there are answers to
every question and solutions to every problem, and the
members of Cabinet are committed to find them. We solicit
your help and co-operation, for only through total student
involvement can Cabinet achieve any measure of real success.

Complete solutions for February’s puzzles will appear in
the next issue.

Answers to January’s Skycapers

1. The least number of mangoes with which the problem
could be done was 79. Solution was done by trial and error.

2. The thrifty engineer would need to carry his last deposit in
a truck (over $5,000,000 in pennies) but he could well

afford it having saved $10,737,4l8.23. (230— 1)

3. Our consolations to those who used fancy formulas to find
the length of a spiral. While the record is played the needle
only travels from the outer to the inner edge of the
grooves. The length of the groove is irrelevant. The answer
was 3”.

4. The number of letters in each word of the poem tells the
corresponding number in the value of pi. However, just to
be sneaky our puzzle editor deliberately gave the eleventh
decimal incorrectly (4 instead of the correct value of 8) to
make sure no one just copied the -value of pi from some
math tables. Answer was
3.141592653549793238462643383279.

The most frequently missed problem was #3, followed in
order by #4, #2 then #1.

Most nurses, generally speaking, are easy-going sort of
people, able to withstand the numerous stresses of their
profession. But if anything gets their dander up, it’s working
with a tyrannical, inconsiderate doctor. Four nurses, assigned
to such a doctor’s patients, decided at long last to retaliate and
teach their doctor boss a lesson. They each planned a separate
surprise for him, and when all the four plots were put into
operation, they met to discuss their respective bits of
skulduggery.

“I stuffed cotton in the bottom of his stethoscope,” the
first said proudly. “Is he going to get a surprise when he

There once was a curator of the Philadelphia Zoo, who in
his desire to enlarge his supply of gorillas, sent his right-hand
man George on a safari to darkest Africa. When George arrived
on the scene, he wandered through the native village and soon
came upon a sign which read “Aku’s Gorilla Hunting Team.”
George walked in and there sat a tall, burly native who
introduced himself as Aku. He agreed to take George on a
gorilla hunt the next afternoon.

When George arrived at Aku’s hut the next day, he was
amazed at what he saw; besides Aku, there were three other
members of the team: one man carrying a large net and several
strong ropes, another man holding a big rifle, and last but
certainly not least, a huge, wild-eyed dog with long fangs
protruding from his immense jaw. They then set out on their
mission of capturing gorillas, and soon after they began their
trek through the jungle. Aku spotted one in a tall tree,
and quickly climbed up after it. Aku chased the gorilla out on
a branch, began wrestling with it, and then pitched it out of
the tree. As it landed, the tremendous dog leaped upon it and
clamped its jaws on the poor gorilla’s most vulnerable area.
Meanwhile, the man with the net and ropes came out and tied
up the beast, but during the whole process the man with the
gun just stood there, and George took note of this.

When they returned to their camp, George took Aku aside
and explained to him that he could make more money for
himself if he got rid of the man with the gun, since the man
just stood around doing nothing, but to this Aku emphatically
replied, “He stay, he stay.”

Well George overlooked the stubborness of the native, and
the next day they went hunting for more gorillas. Aku looked
up into a tall tree, and there he saw the biggest,
fiercest-looking gorilla he had ever seen. He hesitated for a
second, and then began climbing up after it. He ran out on the
branch, and there they wrested for several minutes. Finally the
gorilla picked Aku right off his feet and threw him out of the
teee, and as he fell toward the ground he yelled to the man
with the gun, “Shoot the dog, shoot the dog.”

Eugene’s Aqua-Circus had always done a booming
business, appealing to the entire family. One day, however,
Eugene was told by an indignant parent that she would never
come back to his Aqua-Circus again, because the porpoises
were constantly making love in their aquarium. Eugene
scurried over to the aquarium and sure enough, to the
amazement of everyone who watched, the porpoises were
making love in the water. People began to complain about this,
of course -- you certainly couldn’t bring your kids to the
Aqua-Circus if they were going to see the porpoises making
out in the water. Realizing this was going to hurt business,
Eugene asked the aquarium superintendent to come up with a
way to make the porpoises stop making love. The
superintendent told Eugene that if he fed the porpoises seagull
meat, they’d stop.

“Of course,” ﬁugene nodded his head enthusiastically.

So Eugene went out and rounded up all the seagulls he
could find and wrapped them up and put them in the back of
his truck. At the gates of the Aqua-Circus, Eugene found
Arnold the Lion-tamer and four sleeping lions from the nearby
zoo. Arnold explained they had been walking along and had
stopped for a rest. Eugene told him his problem, and insisted
that he had to get through the gates. Arnold finally agreed,
cautioning Eugene to carefully carry the sack of seagulls over
the sleeping lions.

Heeding this advice, Eugene flipped the sack of seagulls
over his back and began to tip-toe over the sleeping lions when
a police car drove up and an officer stepped out to arrest
Eugene.

“Why?” asked Eugene.

“Violation of the Mann Act,” answered the policeman.
“Transporting gulls across sedate lions for immoral porpoises.”

An elderly banker sold out his business for several million
dollars and took up farming in a mild but expensive way. One
of his costlier purchases was two hundred female pigs and a
prize boar.

The next time he visited New York, he told his old
associates that the pigs hadn’t been on his property ten days
before he noticed a peculiar thing. The boar wasn’t paying the
slightest attention to a single one of the sows.

“Luckily for me, however,” continued the banker, .“a
highfalutin’ vegetarian came along and suggested that I mix
some special new vitamin pill in that boar’s diet. And from the
day he started eating them, he hasn’t given those sows one
moment’s peace.”

An ex-partner asked, “What’s the name of those new
vitamin pills?” .

“I don’t remember their name,’ confessed the banker,
“but I’ll tell you this. They taste like peppermint.”

He answered: “Don’t you dare dig up that field. That’s

ORGASMIC CHEMISTRY . . .

How to Make Ethyl Pctlpitcrte

 

Illustrated apparatus has nothing whatsoever ‘to do with experiment outlined below.

Previous attempts to make ethyl palpitate had resulted in
rather sporadic success; and a good yield once obtained could
not be duplicated on successive evenings, and so on.
Accordingly, it was decided to more closely investigate the
optimum conditions for favorable reactions.

One of the most important factors was found to be the
purity of the ethyl chosen for the work. Some authorities
claimed that very impure ethyl alone could be counted on for
success, while others said that a hitherto unreacted ethyl was
best. Our extensive investigations have shown that both of
these extremes should be avoided. Reaction of the highly
impure material often occurs with considerable violence,
explosive at times, with great attendant danger of damage to
equipment and operators. On the other hand, overly pure
ethyl shows a naturally unreactive tendency, forming products
such as ethyl hesitate, which tendency cannot be overcome
even by the most skillful operator. The recommendation is
therefore made that samples of average purity be chosen for
the best yield. A good criterion of reactivity is whether the
compound, ethyl osculate, can be made easily.

As regards solvents and catalysts, alcoholic solutions are
generally most satisfactory, although they add somewhat to
the cost of preparation. The alcohol concentration should be
very carefully controlled, as the saturated form of ethyl is
useless. As a general rule, light should be avoided as it has a
definite inhibitory effect in most cases.

One word regarding conditions of reaction. It is highly
important that no other member of the ethyl family be
present.

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER_FEBRUARY,1970

Chemically, the proper course of reaction is as follows: As
gentle warming is applied (which can be accomplished by
several means, an open fireplace has much to recommend it)
the formation of the following products is successfully
observed: ethyl reciprocate, ethyl agitate, in some cases ethyl
vibrate, and finally (if the heating has been carried out at
exactly the correct rate), the desired product, ethyl palpitate.
Under no circumstances should the heating be attempted too
rapidly, as undesirable side reactions can be set in, the rnildest
of which leads to ethyl remonstrate, more usually to the
sudden appearance of ethyl refrigerate, and in certain extreme
cases (which usually make headlines) to ethyl assassinate.

As a final observation, the authors would like to point out
that with certain difficult reactions of this type, the catalytic
influence of gold, silver or precious stones will insure good
results.

PRECAUTIONARY NOTICE

It is well to mention (although probably known already to
most operators) that the equipment used in the final reaction
must be encased in an impermeable material (neoprene rubber
is recommended), thus avoiding the annoying formation of
ethyl pregnate, which, if allowed to stand for several months,
will in some unavoidable cases, convert to ethyl propagate.

Please report the yield you obtain (and also which ethyl
you used) to the SKYSCRAPER so that we can check the
experiment.

But there is plenty wrong behind those gates!

We need people with 1) the perception to recognize the necessity

AND 2) the inventiveness to design the changes

AND 3) the ability to sell those changes to managers
who have to be sold on them

This is the credo of the “industrial engineer.” Some come
with that label right out of college, eager for details.
Others are mechanical or chemical engineers who had
scarcely heard of “industrial engineering” on campus but
have discovered in themselves a stronger interest in the
consequences of engineering than in building a reputa-
tion on gearing, heat ﬂow, reaction rates, etc.

On the whole, our balance sheets indicate those plants
are not in too bad shape. In part, this can be attributed to
good industrial engineering over the years. We do have a
little trouble keeping all of our industrial engineers in

industrial engineering. The departments they sell on
change keep trying to steal them and push them up lad-
ders. Sometimes they succeed.

This makes it necessary for us to invite you to indicate

Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor:

I feel compelled to congratulate you on your timely opinion,
“What Ever Happened to the Skyscraper Engineer Engineer‘?”,
which appeared in the October-November, 1969, issue of
Skyscraper Engineer. As an alumnus of the University of
Pittsburgh, I share your well-expressed concern with the
problem of student apathy. And as a former faculty member
at Pitt, I stand ready to confirm that student apathy at our
fine school is ominously widespread.

Perhaps you would care to pass along to your colleagues and
peers my retrospective observations of phlegmaticism. Let me
begin by asserting my belief that the major cause of student
apathy rests in the woefully misguided beliefthat engagement
in extra curricular activities necessarily implies preclusion of
meritorious academic performance. Apathetic students are
probably convinced that there is negligible probability that
constructive activities involvement will generate either self
professional enhancement or institutional betterment.

To these students I would say that they strongly intimate
misconception of those things which are nominally required of
practicing engineers. They are undoubtedly aware of the fact
that practicing engineers are required to perform plentiful
research or developmental tasks and to this extent, the
ubiquitously disseminated assignments in the world of
academia are indeed pragmatically relevant. But just as extra
curricular activities seemingly interfere with study habits,
ostensibly impertinent demands in the industrial world
interfere with stipulated research and developmental
mandates. For example, let these students consider the
technical meeting, the technical conference, that luncheon
appointment with a prospective buyer, the weekly staff
meeting, the self-initiated written proposal to alter the
direction of a previously established design philosophy or
technique, and the self-initiated justification of increased
expenditure in the face of restricted financial allotment. These
six examples have a number of common denominators. They
can be quite time consuming, they can offer a perhaps
annoying distraction to an important and enlightening
engineering project, and in somewhat of a compensating vein,
they can be most enjoyable and rewarding. There is significant
satisfaction and even prestige to be gleaned from becoming
involved in technical societies, delivering a paper, selling that
potential buyer, making one’s views evident at staff meetings,
and developing the professional respect commensurate_with
the opportunity to contribute to the design or economic
mission of a project.

An additional common denominator characterizes the six
aforementioned examples, namely, they are very necessary in
the achievement of a satisfying engineering career. No one is so
tragically useless as the extremely competent engineer who
does not permit himself to become heard, seen, trusted, or
