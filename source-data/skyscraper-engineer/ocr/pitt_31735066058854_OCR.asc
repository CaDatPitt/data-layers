The shape of flight

The shapes of things that ﬂy have always been
determined by the materials they are made of.
Feathers form wings that are basically

alike for all birds—and membrane forms an
entirely different wing for insects. It takes
thousands of years, but nature improves its
materials and shapes, just as technology
improves the materials and shapes of aircraft.
But here, the improvements in materials are so
rapid that designs become obsolete almost as
soon as they are functional.

Today, our aeronautical designers and missile

experts work with types of materials that
didn't exist just a few short years ago.

Steels are probably the most important examples:_

United States Steel has just

developed ﬁve new types of steel for the

missile program. They are called “exotic"

steels because they have the almost unbelievable
qualities necessary for unearthly ﬂights.

The shape and the success of our space birds
depend on steel. If you would like to get facts

How to advance through lateral movement

HE LATERAL PASS is a perfect example of how to
get ahead by ﬁrst going sideways. And lateral move-
ment is a philosophy we use at Koppers.

Here’s how it works. Let’s say you’re a new employee
at Koppers. We give you a speciﬁc assignment. You
ﬁnd it exciting, challenging. You do a good job. But do
we leave you there? Not at all. Once you understand the
products and the function of that particular operation,
we try you on a diﬁerent assignment. Here, again, you’ll
ﬁnd the work new and stimulating.

You’ll never be buried at Koppers. You’ll never stand
still intellectually. Moving from one operation to an-
other, you’ll move ahead. Your assignment won’t be to
learn just a job, but a vast, diversiﬁed corporation. Your
compensation? Advancement, responsibility, success.

Your youth won’t be held against you. Neither will
short tenure. If you have the ability and the desire to get
ahead, you’ll move fast! Our system of continuous ap-
praisal and evaluation is your guarantee of that.

OCTOBER 1959

Koppers is so widely diversiﬁed that you can almost
name your job. Want to work with chemicals, jet-engine
sound control, plastics, sintering plants, wood preserva-
tives, road surfacing materials, electrostatic precipi-
tators? Interested in research? Production? Sales? These
are only a few of the fascinating opportunities at Koppers.

Why not ﬁnd out how you can ﬁt into the Koppers
picture? Write to the Manager of Manpower Planning,
Koppers Company, Inc., Piitsburgh 19, Pennsylvania.
Or, see your College Placement Director and arrange an
appointment with a Koppers representative for the next
recruiting visit.

AT A GLANCE

By Dr. G. R. Fitterer. Dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines

   

Dean G. R. Fitterer

“Whenever you look at a piece of work
and you think the fellow was crazy, then you
want to pay some attention to that. One of you
is likely to be, and you better find out which
one it is. It makes an awful lot of difference.”

—Charles F. Kettering

Our first glance at a new idea is often likely to be the
most important one. If we ﬁnd the thought to be totally
different from any which we have previously encounter-
ed, we do often consider it to be radical and its author
to be a little crazy. At this point, the engineer as sug-
gested by the author of the above quotation should stop,
investigate, and evaluate. It might be the one big idea
of his lifetime.

All new thoughts appear to be somewhat radical at
ﬁrst, but after they are investigated more thoroughly,
they often are found to be simple truths. By this time,
however, everyone is on the “band-wagon” and anyone
who does not understand the idea is now considered to
be uneducated or uninformed.

No person ever had more intellectual curiosity than
Charles Kettering, inventor of the automobile self—start-
er, and many other things. Even in his eighties, he was
a young man with the same intense desire to investi-
gate any new thought. While he was director of the
General Motors Research Laboratory, he would not
leave this investigation entirely to his staff. ‘He looked
into the matter himself. He ridiculed the smugness of the
“status-quo” attitude in men half his age.

More important than investigating the “radical”
thoughts of others, we should learn to investigate our
own new ideas. We often discard ideas because we are
afraid to be considered “off,” or radical by others.

Each of our minds has encountered entirely differ-
ent combinations of experiences; why should they think
the same thoughts?

SIX PERTINENT QUESTIONS
TO ASK THE ALCOA RECRUITER
WHEN HE VISITS PITT

H ere’s What You M ay Want to Ask About Opportunities at Alcoa

1. Where can I go in Alcoa with my type of degree?
2. In what part of the country would I be located?

3. What kinds of training programs will I participate
in at Alcoa?

. What are my starting salary prospects?
. Will Alcoa pay my moving expenses?
6. What are my chances for advancement with Alcoa?

U1-i~\

And H ere’s What We Answer:

1. There are openings at Alcoa each year for graduates
with many types of degrees. Graduates in mechanical,
metallurgical, electrical, industrial, chemical and civil
engineering have a wide choice of opportunities in engi-
neering, production, research, development or sales
engineering. There also are openings for chemists for
research and for business administration and liberal
arts graduates in accounting and sales.

2. Geographical location will depend on your ﬁeld. New
engineering, production and accounting employees are
assigned to one of 30 Alcoa operating locations through-
out the nation. New sales engineering and sales ad-
ministration employees, after completing a six-month
training program, go to one of Alcoa’s 72 sales ofﬁces.
If your ﬁeld is sales development or process develop-
ment, you will be located in New Kensington, Pa., ‘or
Cleveland, Ohio. Main research laboratories are located
in New Kensington, with branches in Cleveland, East
St. Louis, Ill., Massena, N. Y., and Chicago.

3. Alcoa has a training program for each new employee.
Engineering and production training involves orienta-
tion and rotation of assignments for approximately one
year. Sales training is conducted in sales offices and in

OCTOBER 1959

nine plant locations over a six-month period. Account-
ing training calls for rotation of assignments for 18 to
24 months.

4. Alcoa’s starting salaries are competitive with those
of other companies. An initial salary is established for
a basic four-year degree. Additional credit is given for
outstanding personal qualiﬁcations, advanced educa-
tional training, military service and previous work ex-
perience. Future salary progress is based on your own
performance and growth potential.

5. Alcoa pays transportation and moving expenses for
you and your family. This applies to your ﬁrst and all
subsequent assignments.

6. Alcoa personnel policies assure individual recogni-
tion for you. They include regular performance apprais-
als, individual opportunity for advanced management
training, conﬁdential and individual salary considera-
tion and promotion entirely from within the company.

If you’d like to ﬁnd out more about employment oppor-
tunities with Alcoa, contact your placement officer to
arrange a campus interview. Mutual interest will result
in further interviews at an Alcoa location. For more
details immediately, write Manager, College Recruit-
ment, 810 Alcoa Building, Pittsburgh 19, Pa., for the
new booklet, A Career for You With Alcoa.

editorial

This past September the University of Pittsburgh
inaugurated a program without precedent in the edu-
cational system of the United States. This bold new
program has a number of points that will be of great
benefit to us, the engineering students, if it is put to
proper use.

The Schools of Engineering and Mines, under the
trimester plan, will provide the engineering student
.with an extra term. The total number of terms
would then be raised from eight to nine. This extra
'term is the key to one of the greatest benefits the
trimester plan can offer.

There are numerous possibilities for the eighteen odd
credits that this extra trimester will make available

1. The trimester load that the engineer carries can
be reduced.

2. Engineering courses in allied field could be
offered.

3. Courses in specialized branches of one’s own major
might be made available.

4. Liberal Arts and Business Administration subjects
could be given greater emphasis.

These are the major possibilities and might be put
into effect as they stand or in any combination of the
whole group.

Which plan would do the engineers the most good,
or would one plan alone be the right choice? A close
look at the different plans might clarify the situation.
The engineers have suffered under a minimum eighteen
and one half credit load for years. Students in
most of the other University Schools carry far less
credits and they do not have the burden of two or three
labs a week.‘ A reduction in credits, then, might well
be worth while, but would this make us better engineers
and citizens? It would give us more free time for study,
work, extracurricular activities and just loafing. Being
an engineer and knowing engineers, I think the emphasis
would be put on loafing in most cases. Possibly, it would
be better to suffer with eighteen credits and try to get
some good use out of them.

What about engineering courses not directly asso-
ciated with your own specific field? Do you think, for
example, that E.E.’s should have more Chem E. sub-
jects? Definitely every engineer should have some know-
ledge in all of the engineering fields. Are we getting
enough of these subjects now or should we have more
under trimesters? A few statistics might help here. Out
of the approximately 145 credits, we carry only forty
percent in our own field. Forty percent are subjects
in allied engineering and natural science fields, and the
remaining twenty percent are required Liberal Arts,
Business and elected courses.

Can the same argument, then, be given for specialized
courses in your own field? I have already mentioned
that only forty percent of the courses we take are in our

8

Dick DeNezza

own field. This forty percent, in most cases, gives the
student a broad background in his particular major, but
offers little or no opportunity for him to study the par-
ticular branch he wants to specialize in. The days are
over when a person with only basic knowledge in his
field can become an expert in a few weeks. Engineering
jobs are becoming so exacting that months of training
are necessary before a person can be considered com-
petent enough to do a good job. Obviously, all of these
specialties cannot be taught while at the University,
but the student should at least know they exist and the
basic principles that they are founded upon.

So much for technical topics. Should Liberal Arts
and Business Administration courses be considered when
thinking about what new courses should one take? These
subjects should be of great interest to all engineers.
At the present time we have too few of this type subject
and little time for extracurricular activities. As a result,
we are considered by some to only be half educated.
We are highly proficient in technical topics but have
little formal education in the Arts and Business. Only
a few of us on our own strive to become the “well
rounded person.” The person that is not only the ex-
pert in his major but is also well versed in business,
music, art, and management,.he is the engineer that
has no financial ceiling. He is the person that is becoming
one of the most sought after individuals in industry.

What can we do, then, with our extra trimester?
All plans have merit, though some more than others.
Certainly one plan cannot be acceptable to all.
Now is the time for you to make your decision and then
make it known. The individual departments will soon
be making their choice, but as yet no steadfast rules
have been made. Our action now can turn the extra
trimester into something that is much more than just
eighteen more credits.

The device about to be submerged is an “underwater sound source”. It transmits sound "waves beneath the sea and is part of the research

equipment developed by Bendix Research Laboratories Division for use in the Bendix program of undersea acoustics research.

Bendix, America’s most diversiﬁed engineering organi-
zation, offers challenging job opportunities in every
area of man’s scientiﬁc and engineering accomplish-
ment—under the sea, on land, in the air and in
outer space!

Take, for example, the urgent problem of defense
against enemy submarines. Bendix—pioneer in sonar
research development, and supplier of this equipment
to our government for many years——was selected to
develop new techniques to increase sonar capabilities.

Another important Bendix anti-submarine device is
“dunked” sonar, lowered from helicopter into the sea
to detect enemy submarines.

The spectacular “TV eye”, which enabled the crew
of the nuclear-powered submarine “Skate” to observe
the underside of the Polar ice pack and locate areas

A thousand products

1007;!’ A

for safe surfacing, was likewise a Bendix development.

The real “depth” of job opportunities at Bendix can
best be measured by the many and diverse scientiﬁc
ﬁelds in which Bendix is engaged.

For example—career opportunities are available in
such ﬁelds as electronics, electromechanics, ultra-
sonics, computers, automation, radar, nucleonics,
combustion, air navigation, hydraulics, instrumenta-
tion, propulsion, metallurgy, communications, carbu-
retion, solid state physics, aerophysics and structures.

At Bendix there is truly Opportunity in Depth for
outstanding young engineers and scientists. See your
placement director for information about campus
interview dates, or write to Director of University
and Scientiﬁc Relations, Bendix Aviation Corpora-
tion, 1108 Fisher Building, Detroit 2, Michigan.

SKYSC RAPE R
NOTES

This year the editor and staff of
the Skyscraper Engineer will pre-
sent technical articles of interest to
the engineering students as a body.
In addition, various staff reports
will be presented whenever new de-
velopments which are of interest to
engineering students occur on cam-
pus.

Engineers are often required to as-
sume administrative positions at
some time during their career. Oc-
casionally these are only temporary
positions. More often, however, an
engineer will accept a full-time ad-
ministrative responsibility, requir-
ing additional study and training.
These positions range in responsi-
bility from Chief Project Engineer
to Corporation President. Students
entertaining notions of entering the
administrative professions will wel-

inghouse Electric Corporation. Mr.
Price also holds the distinguished
position of Chairman of the Board
of Trustees at the University of
Pittsburgh.

In presenting this article, Sky-
scraper Engineer recognizes and sa-
lutes Mr. Price for his many fine
contributions to the engineering pro-
fession.

Mr. Price also enjoys the recogni-
tion of another outstanding organi-
zation. He was recently awarded the

top prize of the John Fritz Medal
Board of Award -- the highest honor
that engineers can bestow. The gold
medal was awarded to l\/Ir. Price for
his “inspirational leadership, indust-
rial pioneering and personal initia-
tive in marshalling the creative
forces of research and engineering
to the cause of developing atomic
power for the national defense and
for human welfare.” This same
award has been presented to such
notables as Lord Kelvin, George
Westinghouse, Thomas Edison, and
Orville Wright.

“Electroluminescence Lights The
Future,” taken from a prize paper
by Donald Jones, deals with a source
of illumination that will not only
light your home, but will cool it in
the summer and heat it in the
winter. Don takes a deep look into
the principles that makes this new
light source available.

In the field of electricity the Nia-
gara Power project has attracted
wide spread interest. Dick Johnston
in his article “Falling Power”, re-
lates the various problems and pro-
ceedings in the gigantic undertaking
of constructing the facilities neces-
sary to convert the tremendous water
power of the Niagara River into
usable electrical power.

Another advancement in the field
of electricity is power on a smaller
scale, battery power. “Nuclear Bat-
teries” by Neal Walko relates the
difficulties encountered in utilizing
the p-n junction to develop an en-
tirely new power source indepen-
dent of fossil fuels.

In the world of speed existing
today, new fuels have become neces-

Richard P, Johnston

sary to insure the efficient operation
of the high speed engines of planes
and missiles. Wesley Long tells about
newly developed fuels producing
energies higher than 25,000 btu
per pound in his article “Exotic
Fuels.”

Ultrasonics, a field which is at
present under extensive develop-
ment, will some day prove to be
useful for household as well as in-
dustrial equipment. Bob Fatyol in
his article “Ultrasonic Energy” ex-
plains the theory and recent practi-
cal applications of high frequency
sound waves.

Also in this issue, the Skyscraper
Engineer enters the World of Science
Fiction. Kenneth Rothert, former
editor, presents “The Search”, a
fascinating story in the realm of
Unidentified Flying Objects. Since
this is a new attempt to bring
interesting and enjoyable reading to
the students, we would appreciate
any comments about having science
fiction in addition to technical
articles.

ENGINEERS AS ADMINISTRATORS

The engineer who takes his place in industry may
some day be asked to supervise the efforts of others,
including nonengineering and nontechnical personnel.
Statistically, the probabilities are one out of two that
during his working career, an engineer will be promoted
to at least the first level of supervision. This probability
varies considerably, with the odds running approxi-
mately one out of three in the more stable businesses
and one out of one if he is associated with some of the
more dynamic or growth industries.

So it is not unlikely that at some time the typical
engineer will have a choice to make -- whether to
continue in engineering or become an administrator.
Until quite recently, this was a relatively easy decision
to make, for the financial advantages and prestige asso-
ciated with the administrative or management positions
made it difficult for a technical man to decline such
a promotion. As a matter of fact, promotion to an ad-
ministrative position has been frequently offered as
compensation for outstanding technical performance.
All too often this has resulted in a loss to the engineer
as well as to the company. The engineer loses because
he can no longer pursue that for which he is best
suited -- engineering; and the company loses because
the available force of top grade technical men has been
reduced by one, and while the supervisory force has
been increased by one, this is not assurance that that
person is interested in or suited for administration.
Fortunately, great strides have been made by com-
panies such as Westinghouse in recognizing the need
for advancement in engineering that carries with it
professional prestige and adequate compensation. Where
such provisions have been made, the engineer can
derive the greatest job satisfaction without lessening
professional prestige and make his greatest contribution.
Here, technical promotion parallels administrative pro-
motion with respect to financial compensation and to
prestige. Within limits, (excluding high ranking com-
pany officials), financial considerations need no longer
influence the choice between technical and administra-

trative career for engineers.

tive careers. This should tend to limit the total number
of aspirants to management positions to those who are
truly motivated toward administrative responsibilities.
In general, the recent engineering graduate will not
have to decide whether to seek or accept administrative
responsibilities before he has gained several years of
experience in engineering. During _these years, he .will
have ample opportunity to demonstrate the qualities
which may indicate his suitability for a career in ad-
ministration. He will need to demonstrate such qualities
and character traits as:
1. Excellence in “on-the-job performance.”
2. Evidence of potential for added responsibility.
3. Willingness to pay the price in personal effort.
Industry recognizes its responsibility for helping every
person who demonstrates these qualities and character
traits to grow to the limits of his ability commensurate

 

IN ANCIENT TIMES Engineers were considered little
more than slaves.

THE RENAISSANCE PERIOD placed the engineer only
slightly above the plane of the laborer.

with the need which exists for the kind of work for
which he is best suited. This can consist of guidance and
motivation, but the initiative and desire for development
must come from within the individual.

The need for continuing education and development
cannot be over-emphasized, regardless of the level of
an individual’s formal education. The undergraduate
who entertains the notion that once graduated he is
through with formal education, is due for a rude
awakening. For when an administrative position is to
be filled, it is almost axiomatic that the person selected
for the job will have demonstrated a degree of excel-
lence in the performance of his work that is well above
that of other eligibles, and also will have demonstrated
the benefit of continuing education in developing him-
self for added responsibility. V

Self development through continuing education has
grown remarkably since instituted in 1927, reflecting
increasing recognition of the continuing need for
personal development. When the Graduate Study Pro-
gram was initiated in 1927, 25 employes were registered
in University of Pittsburgh evening courses. By 1958,
participation by Westinghouse personnel in graduate
study in business and engineering had increased to in-
clude programs at 26 universities, with 1950 partici-
pants.

From these remarks, it may appear that development
in broad areas beyond the specialized technical back-
ground of the typical engineer is largely a matter of
taking advantage of the opportunities made available
by industry to its employes. Actually all technical college
undergraduates, especially those who think they might
be interested in administrative. responsibility, would do
well to learn as much as they can about social sciences.
In suggesting this, I recognize that the student’s first

responsibility—if he is enrolled in engineering—is to
achieve a well founded core of basic engineering know-
ledge. But the study of economics, psychology, sociology,
government, philosoply, ethics, etc. will be of immense
future benefit to the engineer as it will bring into
better balance his knowledge of people and of things.
Regardless of the engineer’s ultimate position, know-
ledge of the social sciences will better enable him to
understand the society in which he lives and works and
will lead toward more effective work with his associates.

Thus far, the only type of administrative position to
which I have made direct reference is that occurring
within the engineering department. What about the
general management position to which engineering de-
partment managers as well as managers of other
functions report? Many such executive positions are
today filled by technically trained men. It seems obvious
that in today’s ever more technical industry, an en-
gineering background is a definite advantage to those
in upper-level management positions. Certainly such a
background enhances the individual’s understanding
and appreciation of industrial growth through tech-
nological advances. However, engineers who find them-
selves in such positions are among the first to admit the
need for training in business and social sciences to
better enable them to understand and discharge their
broad responsibilities. Such training should be ac-
complished early enough to supplement the “cause and
effect” thinking with which the technically schooled
man may have become imbued while obtaining an
engineering degree. In a broad management position
he is apt to find that his decisions must be based on
something more than “facts.” He must learn to accept

problems having multiple solutions, no one of which at
the time of decision can be definitely proven best.

Essentially, what I’ve said is that regardless of the
amount of a person’s formal education, he should~—both
during and after college—develop simultaneously his
knowledge in the broad political, economic and social
fields as well as increase his technical skill in his speci-
alized field of endeavor I

Power! Hundreds of thousands of horsepower thun-
dering 165 feet down each second of each day. This is
the story of the project to capture some of the power
now going over Niagara Falls.

Since the first crude waterwheel was set up in 1757
at Niagara, power has become increasingly more im-
portant as a by-product of the Falls. Hydroelectric
power was initially produced in 1880 by a brush dyna-
mo hitched to a waterwheel. The power was used to run
two are lamps that illuminated ‘the fountains in Pros-
pect Park. The first public use of electricity from the
Falls occurred in 1881 when water flowed down the 86
foot drop of a paper mill shaft to turn a DC generator.
The electricity generated was supplied to two mills,
several stores, an office building, and a newspaper office.

The large-scale output of commercial power began
in 1895 when the first -of the Adams plants began to
generate AC current. The Adams plants used a short
intake canal and a 7,000 foot long 18 by 21 foot dis-
charge tunnel. The water dropped 135 feet to operate

turbines rated at 5,000 horsepower.

At the turn of the century, the Schoellkopf stations
were built at the bottom of the gorge. These plants were
able to utilize 200 feet of the river’s drop but in 1956,
two-thirds of the Schoellkopf plants were destroyed by a
rock slide. This destruction created an acute shortage
of power in the electrical grids of upper New York
State.

The power shortage accelerated the delayed building
of the new power facilities needed to_use the new water
allotment available to the U. S.‘ through a 1950
American-Canadian treaty. Under the terms of the
treaty, during the tourist season daylight hours, at
least 100,000 cubic feet per second must flow over the
Falls. At other times and at night, only 50,000 cubic
feet per second is needed. The diverted water was to be
shared equally between the two countries.

Since the average water flow in the Niagara River
is 202,000 cubic feet per second, slightly more than 100,-
000 cubic feet per second is available during daylight
hours and 150,000 cubic feet per second can be diverted
at night and over the off-tourist season. Remedial
works were constructed above the falls to insure that
an even curtain of water goes over the crest of the
Falls although a large portion of the water is diverted.
Thus, scenic considerations are being served by preserv-
ing the beauty of the Falls and prolonging it’s life re-
duced by erosion.

At the present time, the U. S. is unable to use all
the water allocated by the 1950 treaty. The new amount
of water available was the cause of the Niagara Power
Project being instituted. The construction work falls
in three major parts. They are the water intake and
conduits, the Tuscarora Pump-Generating Station, and
the main generating plant.

There is a difference of 326 feet in the levels of Lake
Erie and Lake Ontario, but the water only drops 165

feet at the Falls. The rest of the head, or difference in
water levels, is lost in the rapids just above and below the
Falls. Therefore, the most efficient design to take full
advantage of the full drop of water would entail the
water intake to.be above the rapids in the upper Niagara
River and the generating station to be below the lower
rapids in the river gorge at the same level as Lake
Ontario. By doing this, the generating station will be
able to take advantage of 314 of the 326 foot drop.

The intake is 21/2 miles above the Falls. It is being
constructed in a pumped-dry 76-acre area behind a
half-mile cofferdam. The intake consists of two concrete
structures, one for each conduit. Each structure is 700
feet long and has 48 slotted openings whose tops will
vary from 13 to 26 feet below the river level. The gate
structures to stop the intake of water are 55 feet wide
and nearly 100 feet high. Gates are necessary for in-
spection and repair work to be carried on in the con-
duits. The river bottom is being dredged into the shape
of a half funnel in order to provide the necessary water
flow into the conduits. Dredging was also done to in-
sure a 101/2 foot depth for a 500 foot wide area just
downstream from the intakes. The depth was necessary
to prevent the clogging of the intake slots with river
ice.

The water flows from the intake structure into two
conduits. The conduits run in a northerly direction for
about 4 miles to the reservoir area. Each reinforced
concrete conduit will have inside dimensions of 46 feet
by 66 feet high. Planned capacity of the conduits will
be 83,000 cubic feet per second at a water velocity of
14 feet per second. The walls of the conduits will be
21/2 to 3 feet thick. Construction of the conduits will be
done by digging the trench, placing the concrete walls
and tops and ‘then backfilling the soil. The tops of the
conduits will average better than 40 feet under ground
level and they will drop  inch for every 20 linear

feet. When it is known that 3 different contracting
combines have undertaken to evacuate approximately
14,200,000 cubic yards of rock for the conduits, then
the immense size of the conduits can be realized.
The conduits will discharge their water into a surge
basin located in from the Tuscarora Pump-Generating
Plant. This L-shaped surge basin will be 500 feet wide,
3,000 feet long, and 110 feet deep. Being open, it will
be able to absorb the surge of excess water in case the
main generating plant is shut down. The Tuscarora
Pump-Generating Plant is a unique method of storing
excess water power when the power demand is down
and when more water can be diverted from the Niagara
River. The plant itself will be 993 feet long, 162 feet
high, and 240 feet wide. During the night, surplus
power from the main generating station will be used
by twelve 37,500 horse power motors to pump water
85 feet up into the large storage reservoir in back of the
plant. Each pump will be capable of pumping 3400 cubic
feet of water per second up the 24 foot diameter steel
penstocks. When the peak power demands occur during
the day, the motors and pumps are reversed to become
generators and turbines and water begins to flow down
the penstocks. Each generator is rated at 20,000 kilo-
watts at 112.5 revolutions per minute, and each turbine
develops 28,000 horsepower. After the water flows down
from the reservoir through the plant and produces
240,000 kilowatts, the water runs into the main canal

and through the main generating station to produce
more power.

The main generating plant is one of the world’s larg-
est. It will have an installed capacity of 1,950,000 kilo-
watts, enough to supply the needs of a city like Chicago.
The plant will have 13 generating units, each one rated
at 150,000 kilowatts. These units will be the largest
of their type ever built. In comparison, Grand Coulee’s
generators are only rated at 108,000 kilowatts. Ship-
ment of parts for just one of the generators requires 34
railroad cars. The plant housing the equipment will be
1840 feet long, 389 feet high, and -580 feet wide from
intake to the outlets in the gorge below.

The generators will be located at the bottom of the
plant. Connecting the intake structures and the tur-
bine will be 13 welded-steel penstocks, each 462 feet
long with a reducing elbow at the top and bottom.
The upper elbow reduces from 281/2 feet to 24 feet
which is the nominal diameter of the penstock. The
lower elbow reduces from 24 feet to 21 feet at the
scroll case extension.

Each of the F rancis-type hydraulic turbines are rated
at 200,000 horsepower with a 300 foot net head of
water. The generators will operate at 120 revolutions
per minute, 3-phase, 60 cycle. Power will be generated
at 13,800 volts and then be transformed to 115,000,
230,000 and 340,000 volts for transmission. This part of
the project alone will cost $117,170,000. The first power
is expected to be in the lines on February 10, 1961,
less than three years after the awarding of the first
contracts.

That is the story of the Niagara Power Project. It is
the zenith of power diversion from the Niagara River
that started over 200 years ago with a 6 horsepower
over—shoot water wheel. With its installed capacity
of 2,190,000 kilowatts, the power needed for the in-
dustrial growth of New York State can be created
giving new prosperity to the whole area I

THE HUMAN FACTOR

Scientists have long been preoccupied with the techno-
logical problems of Man and the Machine. The increas-
ingly complex nature of advanced systems has created
an urgent need to enhance man’s contribution to effective
systems performance. The complicated nature of this
relationship requires the skills of psychologists, social
scientists, mathematicians, and engineers.

At Ramo-Wooldridge, human engineering, personnel
selection, individual and system training, display design,
and communications are successfully integrated into
systems design and development by the technique of
large-scale simulation.

in today's technology

Simulated inputs enable scientists to observe a system as
it operates in a controlled environment and make possible
the collection of data on performance, training, human
engineering, maintenance, and logistics and support.
Scientists and engineers use this data to assure the design,
production, and delivery of a uniﬁed system capable of
high performance and reliability.

Expanding programs at Ramo-Wooldridge in the broad
areas of electronic systems technology, computers, and
data processing have created outstanding opportunities
for scientists and engineers. For further information con-

BY DONALD JONES

Previously, only four basic types of electric lighting
were known; these were; incandescence, fluorescence,
die-electric breakdown and gas discharge. Now, a fifth
and more basic lighting has emerged which may revo-
lutionize the field of lighting. Called electroluminescence,
it is created by exciting certain semiconductor materials
with an alternating electric field.

The simplicity of the light cell itself can be demon-
strated by going through a sample construction of a
simple cylindrical cell. Two wires are wound over the
cylinder so that uniform spacing is maintained. A semi-
conductor material called a phosphor is then coated on
the exterior of the core. The phosphor is usually mixed
with a plastic binder so that adhesion to the surface is
facilitated. When an alternating current is applied to the
wires, the alternating field produced excites the phos-
phor to produce light. The principle disadvantage of
this type of cell is that the light produced is not uniform.

A method of overcoming the difficulty of uneven illu-
mination is to make the electrodes into large flat plates
with the phosphor sandwiched between them. Of course,
if the generated light is to be visible, at least one of the
electrodes must be transparent. One way of accomplish-
ing this is to coat an ordinary piece of glass with a thin
film of zinc oxide‘. Zinc oxide is both electrically con-
ductive and optically transparent and enables the gene-
rated light to be seen.

Although it is not necessary for the two electrodes to
be in direct contact with the phosphor material, it is
important that a constant electrode separation be main-
tained for a uniform lighting effect. However, if this
separation becomes appreciable, a large voltage must be
applied to the electrodes to produce the required electri-
cal field strength.

The process of applying the opaque electrode to the
plastic-phosphor mixture is the most critical process in
cell construction. The best method found was to vapor-
rize the electrode material directly onto the phosphor
with aluminum being used for the metal due to its low
cost and good vaporizing qualities. However, the choice
of metal for the opaque electrode seems to have li-ttle
effect on cell operation.

The intensity of the light produced by a flat cell as
described above, is distinctly influenced by the strength
of the electric field. In fact, the brightness of the cell
can be considered to be proportional to the applied

Future

voltage. As a result of this relationship, one of the major
research efforts in the field has been devoted to deter-
mining a relationship between the brightness of the cell
and the applied voltage. Presently, the most accurate
relationship over a wide range of voltages is given by the
empirical law:

B = aVe‘=b/(V-l-V0)
Where B=brightness of emitted light in foot'lamberts;
V: RMS value of the cutoff voltage in volts; Vo =
RMS value of the applied voltage in volts: a: posi-
tive real constant determined by the frequency in
foot lamberts/volts; and b: positive real constant deter-
mined by the frequency, the phosphor temperature,

and the thickness in volts.

As the equation shows, light emission increases very
rapidly at low voltages but tends to increase more line-
arly at higher voltages. Although the rate of increase
is small at higher voltages, the brightness does not reach
a maximum. This can be shown by taking a first deri-
yative of the above equation with respect to voltage
giving the equation of the ’ brightness-voltage curve
slope.

Slope = a
(V+Vo)z

If a maximum did occur, the slope would have to
equal zero for some positive value of V. Since neither
the exponential term nor the quantity (Vb/V'l”Vo)
can ever be less than zero, the curve does not have a
maximum.

Light emitted from a cell under sinusoidal field excit-
ation was observed to flicker at twice the frequency
of the applied voltage. The output light wave was
found to consist of two main peaks which lag the peak
values of the applied field, and two minor disturbances
immediately following the main peaks. I-t has been
shown, however, that the phase angle and disturbances
also tend to decrease with an increase in voltage.

Brightness and color of the cells were found to be
dependent on frequency. This dependency varied for

different phosphors. In general, it was observed that at
low frequencies the brightness increased almost linearly
with frequency but at high frequencies the light emis-
sion seemed to saturate at a fixed maximum. The fol-
lowing equation relates brightness and frequency for a
constant voltage and frequencies between 100 to 2000
cycles per second: '

the applied voltage) in foot lamberts-second p_er radian.

high frequencies. In fact, the cell can be considered to
be a capacitor. Assuming a cell to have an area of
one square centimeter, a representative value of -the
effective value of the effective capacitance can be calcu-
lated. The optimum thickness of the phosphor mixture
of such a cell is approximately 50 microns and the rela-
tive dielectric constant of the mixture is 8 microns.
Using this data, the capacitance, C, can be calculated as:
 .12 -4

C 1: (8. 85X..l.0 n6)(8)(.l0 )‘:142/0/qf/Cmz

50x10

Exeperimentally, it is found that the input impedance
to the electroluminscent cell is primarily capacitive.
Due to the large value of capacitance, the input im-
pedance becomes very small at moderately high fre-
quencies. This phenomena implies that the voltage source
must supply sizeable amounts of quadrature current.
However, unless a power factor correction network is
added to the cell, this may be difficult to achieve in
large cells.

Colors emitted by the cells are dependent on the
choice of metal used to activate the zinc sulphide
electrode. By activating with combinations of copper,
lead and manganese, a multi-activated phosphor is
produced which can change color with changes in fre-
quency. For example, a cell whose zinc sulphide phos-
phor is activated by lead and copper can emit a green
and also a blue band of color. The green emission
saturates at a relatively low frequency, while the blue
emission increases linearly with the frequency. Thus,
while green light is predominant at low frequencies,
the blue light is predominant at high frequencies.

Although electroluminescent lighting is relatively new,
it is already being used in transportation centers as
digital display screens to illustrate vehicle arrival and
departure times. Not only is such a display screen at-

tractive, but one operator at a remote center can run
several screens at the same time. The screen uses sepa-
rated segments to make up the numbers. Each segment
is connected to a separate circuit and the cells glow in
response to current being applied to specified seg-
ments. The main disadvantage of this type of screen is
the large number of leads that must come from the
controller.

This fault could be overcome by using a cell first
advocated by W. W. Piper. Piper’s cell uses segments in
both the metal and transparent electrodes. The metal
electrode is divided into a segment composed of many
small, narrow rectangles that extend horizontally across
the cell while the transparent electrode is similarly con-
structed but in a vertical direction. When an alternat-
ing current is applied between a metal segment and a
transparent segment, the phosphors are excited where
the two segments overlap and a point of light is
emitted.

Using this type of construction, the author proposes
a plotting screen that can be used in conjunction with
radar tracking stations. The plotting screen would be
composed of a large many-segmented cell. The extension
of the cell could be marked off with the coordinate
system desired. A target’s position could then be plotted
on the cell by turning the controllers to the desired
bearings of latitude and longitude. And by using multi-
activated phosphors, the target could be color coded
to identify the type of target that is being plotted. The
actual tuning of the cell could be done directly by the
tracking method, making the whole operation auto-
matic and instantaneous.

The preceding uses for electroluminescence are just
a few of the possible uses. New uses are being realized
daily. The house of tomorrow may have walls that
heat and cool, give light and change colors to suit the
taste of the individual.

to develop new, faster and
larger storage devices

for tomorrow's computers.

Computing time cut from six months to one day

“My job is to design and develop new, high-speed
storage devices for a powerful new computer that
will perform, in one day, operations requiring six
months on present equipment,” said Dick Booth
as he began a typical day recently. A product de-
velopment engineer at the IBM Laboratories in
Poughkeepsie, N. Y., he started his morning with a
conference on a product of great interest to him: a
magnetic core storage device with a nondestructive
read-out feature. For an hour, he discussed with
circuit design engineers the logical devices needed
for the register—such as magnetic core drivers and
sense amplifiers. Should such devices not be avail-
able, the group would work on designs for new ones.

Dick Booth next met with members of the Mag-
netic Materials Group to establish specifications for
the magnetic core memory elements to be used in
the register. He also discussed with the group the
development of equipment to test the memory
elements. “This magnetic core register is based on
an original idea of mine," he explained. “When you
have a worthwhile idea, you will be given a free
hand in proving it out, backed by IBM's resources
— plus the assistance of skilled specialists.”

Increasing responsibility

At 10:30, Dick Booth reviewed the status of the
entire project with the two engineers, two tech-
nicians, and one logic designer who make up his
team. “My present position is staff engineer,” he
explained. “lt’s the second promotion I've had
since I joined IBM three years ago with a B.S.E.E.
degree from the University of Illinois. I know that
there are plenty of other opportunities to move
ahead. Furthermore, parallel advancement oppor-
tunities exist for engineers in either engineering
development or engineering management.”

Preparing for the future

In the afternoon, Dick Booth went to the 704 Com-
puting Center to supervise some complex preci-
sion computations. “You see how quickly the 704
arrives at the answers," he said. “The computer
being developed is expected to multiply more than
500,000 fourteen-digit numbers a second and add
them at the rate of one million a second. The com-
puter may be used for design computations for
reactors, as well as calculations of satellite be-
havior. Of course it should have hundreds of other
applications.”

At 3:30 P.M., Dick Booth attended a weekly class
on Theoretical Physics that lasted until 5:00. After-
ward, he commented, “You know, IBM offers
excellent educational opportunities both in gen-
eral education and for advanced degrees. One of
the engineers in my group has just received his
Master's degree from Syracuse University, after
completing a postgraduate program given right
here at the IBM Laboratory."

A chance to contribute

As he was leaving for the evening, he said, “Yes,
I'd recommend an IBM career to any college gradu-
ate who wants to exercise his creative ability. IBM
will appreciate his talent and he’ll have the oppor-
tunity to work with specialists who are tops in
their fields. I doubt that he'd be able to find a
more sympathetic and stimulating atmosphere.
Furthermore, he'll have the added incentive of con-
tributing to vitally important projects . . . projects
that will take him to the frontiers of knowledge in
computer electronics.”

ENERGY

High frequency sound waves are
replacing old techniques in many
industrial operations.

BY ROBERT FATYOL, AE ’62

Tlie modern science of ultrasonics has advanced
gntaily since its beginning in 1917 when Langevin ex-
perimented with ultra-high frequency sound for under-
water echo ranging. Today a surprising number of
practical applications are possible. Ultrasonic vibra-
tions, when used as radar waves, can detect ﬂaws inside
large volumes of metals and other solid materials.
When applied to metal surfaces, they make possible
the welding of dissimilar metals without prior surface
preparation. Through activation, a secondary effect of
ultrasonics, virtually inaecessable surfaces can be in-
stantaneously cleaned and degreased; aluminum can
be soldered; and glass, ceramics, and metals can be
drilled in a matter of seconds. In addition to these, there
are numerous other applications which apply to such
ﬁelds as medicine and dentristry.

The ultrasonic vibrations which make possible all
these amazing applications can be created by four
types of transducers or generators. The first two types
of transducers, mechanical and thermal, are relatively
unimportant for practical purposes. The remaining two
types of transducers, piezoelectric and magnetostrietive,
are in more general use in ultrasonic research.

The piezoelectric transducer depends upon the piezo-
electric properties of crystals discovered by Hauy. He
found that a mechanical pressure exerted on certain
crystals gives rise to a difference of electric potential,
which is capable of giving rise.to a current in a circuit
connected to the faces of the crystal. A tension on the
crystal reverses the direction of the current. The con-
verse of this “Piezoelectric effect” has been demonstrat-
ed. In particular, if an alternating current is applied,
rapid alternations of compression and distension occur
in the two perpendicular directions. These forced vibra-A
tions will usually be insignﬁcant unless their frequency
coincides with one or the other of the natural frequen-
cies for longitudinal waves in the crystal, applying the
word “longitudinal” to compression waves in either of

off the oxide layer between the two aluminum strips and
produces a clean, cold-formed bond.

the two directions in the crystal, which are at right
angles to the current.

The most common crystal used is quartz. A section
three cm. deep is cut from the quartz crystal parallel to
the optic axis, which is the axis along the longest di-
mension of the natural crystal. The crystal is then
mounted between metal contacts or electrodes so that
the faces are free to move, after which an electrical
field, whose frequency approaches the natural frequency
for longitudinal waves in the crystal, is applied. In
this way, ultrasonic vibrations can be produced up to
several hundred kilicycles per second.

Magnetostrictive transducers, used more often than
the piezoelectric type, usually employs, the longitudinal
vibrations of rods, tubes, or thin laminations. A typical
example would be the stack-and-plate type of design.
The driving elements are stacks of thin laminations of
some magnetic material such as iron -or nickel. A single
transducer consists of a number of these stacks with one
end of the stack free and the other in the side of a
steel plate. Each stack or pair of stacks is surrounded
by its own, driving coil, and all are driven in phase by
the current from a powerful oscillator. The alternating
electric current ﬂowing through the coil sets up a mag-
netic ﬁeld, ﬁrst in one direction and then in the oppos-
ite direction. The magnetic ﬁeld alternately magnetizes
and demagnetizes the metal core, causing it to change
very slightly ‘in length. Thus, the metal plate bonded to
the stacks is vibra-ted back and forth a few ten-thou-
sandths of an inch at the frequency of the alternating
electrical pulsations. The vibrations caused by the oscil-
lating plate are usually in the ultrasonic range.

The chief advantage of magnetostrictive transducers
over piezoelectric transducers of equal dimensions are
their greater ruggedness and high power-handling capa-
bility. The two major disadvantages of the magneto-
strictive type are low power capacity and a manufac-
turing technique too expensive for economical use in
ultrasonic systems. Both disadvantages are a direct re-

OCTOBER 1959

sult of the fact that the transducer consists of a num-
ber of stacks placed at appreciable intervals on the
plate. When the alternating current drives the stacks,
the plate vibrates in an inefﬁcient, ﬂexural manner in-
stead of as a single unit. To make the plate respond as
a single unit it must be exactly ‘tuned’ so that the circu-
lating vibrations reinforce each other. Otherwise, the
scattered vibrations tend to oppose and cancel one an-
other. The transducer plates, therefore, are tuned by
carefully grinding them to a definite thickness. This is
a costly operation.

Since the transducer is the heart of any ultrasonic
system, the development of an economical transducer
is an acute problem in the ﬁeld of ultrasonics. Westing-
house has devoted a major portion of it’s research and
development in ultrasonic systems to transducer im-
provement. The result is a transducer of a new design
which is economical and twice as efficient as compar-
able units.in use today. The transducer, due to it’s
construction, is usually referred to by its developers at
W/estinghouse as a “spaced lamination” unit. In this
transducer, thin metal laminations, which act as the
core elements, are set uniformily at definite intervals
onto the entire back surface of the radiating plate.
The mass of the entire vibrating system is kept to a
minimum by making the plate relatively thin. Unlike
the ineﬁﬁcient ﬂexural type of vibration found in exist-
ing magnetostrictive transducers, the Westinghouse unit
vibrates with a clean and efﬁcient piston-like action
making the entire plate surface uniformly radiate sound

THE MAGNETOSTRICTIVE MATERIAL vibrates in
synchronism with current in the winding. The acoustic im-
pedance of the spaced laminations closely matches that of
the liquid bath

energy. Compared to the conventional type transducer,
both require the same amount of power yet the new
transducer is cheaper since it uses less metal for con-
struction and delivers double the amount of ultrasontic
power. Dr. Ramey, manager of the Westinghouse new

29

products engineering department declared, “Spaced
lamination has proved so successful that we no longer
consider the transducer as a ‘weak link’ in useful ultra-
sonic systems.” “Instead, we view it as the component
whose perfection will make ultrasonic energy abundant-
ly available in the future.”

One of the many applications of ultrasonic energy
in use at the present time is ﬂaw detection. High fre-
quency vibrations are passed into the metal to be tested
by an electrostrictive probe that changes length with
an impressed voltage. Flaws that may be present in the
metal cause an echo to be sent back. The exact position
of the flaw can be determined when the time interval
is known. If the ultrasonic energy used is in the mega-
cycle range, very minute ﬂaws can be detected and
their position determined in metals which even x-ray
can’t penetrate.

Another application of ultrasonic energy which has
recently been developed is a continuous welder which
makes dissimilar metals weldable without prior sur-
face preparation. The welder consists of two metal
wheels attached at their centers to transducer assem-
blies consisting of a magnetostrictive transducer, a
coupling bar end an enclosure for water cooling. In
operation, the transducers are caused to vibrate longi-
tudinally by an. alternating electrical current. The vibra-
tions are then transmitted down the coupling bars to
the wheels, causing them to vibrate as solid discs with
a free circumference. This in turn causes the centers
of the wheels to move in and out producing flexural
vibrations moving radially out from the centers of the
wheels to their circumferences. The wheel surfaces in

contact with the metals being welded move in opposite
directions by making the transducers work in opposition
to each other.

The sheets of metal being welded are passed between
the two wheels vibrating at 20 kilocycles per second.
The circumferences of the wheels press against the
metal sheets on opposite sides. At the points of contact,
the vibrations of the wheels break up the oxide coat-
ings on the metal surfaces. The metal lattices on the
surfaces of -the sheets are welded by a kneading action
of the wheels as the sheets are drawn through by a
variable speed drive. Although only thin sheets of
metal have been welded up to this «time, it is believed
that someday ultrasonics will be very useful for weld-
ing dissimilar metals of any thickness.

The majority of the other applications of ultrasonics
depend upon a secondary effect called cavitation. It is
simply the creation and then the immediate collapse of
millions of tiny vapor bubbles in the medium in which
the high frequency sound is traveling. These collapsing
bubbles can create pressures as high as 75,000 pounds
per square inch. Together with these pressures, local-
ized temperatures as high as 20,000 degree Fahrenheit
are produced. It is quite generally agreed that it is cavi-
tation that produces most of the detergent and mechani-
cal effects in the application of high intensity sound to
various mediums.

Two of these effects are cleaning and degreasing.

30

ULTRASONIC TiNNlNG BATHS, now under test, can
tun aluminum, ceramics, and even glass without flux or
cleaning material.

Cavitation reduces the surface tension of the clinging
dirt and thereby produces a cleaning action on all sur-
faces and recesses. It also mulsifies greases and oils,
thereby assisting in -the removal of such coatings.

Through ultrasonics, even aluminum, ordinarily very
difficult to solder because of the oxide which is formed
on its surface, can be soldered. When cavitation is in-
duced in the molten solder applied to the surface, the
resultant forces break down the metal oxides formed
on the surface of the parts being soldered. In this way,
the solder is exposed to the pure base metal in a non-
oxidizing atmosphere. The ultrasonic energy may be
applied to a pot of molten s-older or to ‘the tip of the
soldering iron and the aluminum can be soldered with-
out the use of flux.

Ultrasonics has also proved useful in the drilling of
glass, ceramics, and metals. The ultrasonic generator
used in drilling contains a tip which sets up cavitation
.in a surrounding liquid-born abrasive slurry. The
forces produced by the cavitation bubbles propel the
abrasive slurry against the material being drilled. The
result is that glass, ceramics, and metals can be pene-
trated in a matter of a few seconds. The ultrasonic drill
may be any shape as contrasted to circular drills.

A small version of the ultrasonic drill has been de-
veloped for use by dentists in drilling teeth. The ad-
vantage of the drill is reduction in pain and improved
deﬁnition of. the drilled area.

The usefulness of ultrasonics also applies in the
ﬁeld of medicine. Recent work has been done on tumor
detection employing ultrasonic waves and echo-ranging
techniques with cathode-ray presentation. The pulses
are sent into the body and the echos return in differ-
ent intensities depending upon the difference in acous-
tical impedance of the malignant and nonmalignant tis-
sues and in different times depending upon the depths
of the reﬂecting boundaries.

Judging from recent advances in the ﬁeld of ultra-
sonics and its many varied applications being develop-
ed at the present time, there can be no doubt that in
the near future ultrasonics will be found anywhere from
industrial equipment to everyday, household appliances.

“SOLID STATE” ELECTRONIC TUBE

This experimental electronic tube, under early develop-
ment at the Westinghouse research laboratories, gets
it’s all-essential supply of electrons from a tiny crystal
of silicon carbide no larger than the head of a pin.
The crystal replaces the hot, power-consuming cathode
usually ‘round in conventional electronic tubes. The
tube depends upon a new form of electron emission
discovered in a semiconductor material, silicon carbide.
Emission occurs when enough voltage is applied across
the junction to cause breakdown, that is, loss of the
junction’s' normal electrical resistance. Successful ap-
plication of the discovery would result in a “solid
state” electronic tube that would combine into a- single

tion of Pennsylvania Hall as the new “Home of the
E. E. Department.

In redesigning the old medical school building to
provide for the needs of Electrical Engineering, flexi-
bility was the keynote. All laboratories, massrooms, and
offices were designed to meet today’s needs and to
provide for tomorrow’s expansion.

In the building are cight undergraduate laboratories
and seven graduate research laboratories. Any of these
laboratories can be used for electronics or machinery
experiments as well as for special research projects.
All classrooms and laboratories are well lighted and
are painted in restful pastels.

To supply the building with it’s lifeblood - electrical
power - two separate substations were installed. The
auxiliary substation suppiies power for the lighting and

laboratories. This arrangement insures a steady, inter-
ference-free source of power for experimental work.
This main substation is capable of supplying a wide
variety of types of electrical power. Sixty Cycle A.C.
power is available in single phase, two phase and three
phase at voltages of 4:160, 230, 220, 20.8 and 120 volts.

of delivering all types of electrical power.

At each laboratory table is a station panel designed
to connect the experimental setup to the appropriate
power source. Tire panel is also provided with connec-
tion for ammeters and voltmeters. Fuse are provided as
protection against overloads and short circuits.

Power to the station panels is provided by room
panels. Here connections are made to provide the
correct type of electrical power for each experiment at
the station panels. Each room panel :is provided with a
red “panic button” which opens all circuits to all
laboratories as a safety measure.

The room panels, in turn, are activated by floor
panels which draw power directly from the substation,
and distribute it to the room panels.

All these control panels are color coded according
to the standard electronic code to prevent mistakes in
making connection. As a result of this color code, not
only are connections made at a glance, but the laborator-
ies are given a “splash ’ of C0101‘ which acids to the ap-
pearance of the room.

The electronics laboratories are equipped with stand-
ard electronics equipment used by the department re-
cently in its Thaw Hall electronics laboratories. While
no significant equipment changes were made in the
electronics division, new rooms and power facilities
will greatly expand the capabilities of laboratory work
in electronics and circuitry.

The machinery laboratory equipment, however, is of
a new and unusual nature. In planning the new mach-
inery laboratories, Dr. Sze and Dr. John Calvert, Head
of the Department of Electrical Engineering, together
with Westinghouse Electric Corporation Engineers de-
signed the University of Pittsburgh Universal Machine.
This machine is capable of being operated as a motor,
generator or as a motor generator set of virtually every
type of existence.

Starting with the commercial Westinghouse 25 horse-
power machine, the Pitt Professors designed a machine
which by it’s nature will eliminate the purchase of a

the torque on the shaft and the speed of the shaft in

various instruments and devices used by electrical en-
gineers in the field.

. . . as you consider your ﬁrst professional job.
At Melpar, we believe that all young engineers
and scientists should develop the habit of looking
beyond the obvious.

First, what is the obvious? It's obvious that
you’re in demand. You don’t have to worry about
getting your material wants satisﬁed. And you
don’t have to worry about getting opportunities
for professional growth. Since you are in demand,
you can expect to get the things you want from
any number of potential employers.

But, if you look beyond the obvious, you'll real-
ize now that you’re going to want something more
than “want satisfaction” out of your career.
You’re going to want pr-ide—pride in your per-
sonal, individual contribution.

At Melpar, where we are now working on 120
advanced defense and space exploration projects,
we are interested only in young men who realize
that pride is a reward that extends much beyond
the obvious. Because Melpar is a proud Company.
We’re proud of our IMAGINEERING approach
to the solution of electronic problems; we're proud
of our uninterrupted growth and controlled expan-
sion; we're proud of the communities that sur-
round our laboratories and plants in Northern
Virginia and Boston, and We’re proud of our cre-
ation, design, and production of electronic prod-
ucts destined for universal application.

If you want an opportunity to be proud of your
contribution and your Company, we're interested
in hearing from you. Tell us about yourself.

Minature solid state batteries
produce electricity directly from
atomic radiation.

NUCLEAR BATTERIES

BY NEAL WALKO, EE’60

For fifty years, since Mme. Curie suggested that use-
able electrical energy could be obtained from nuclear dis-
integrations, science has been attempting to harness
these nuclear disintegrations in a usable energy source.
The Radio Corporation of America, in its original re-
search on nuclear batteries, showed that a P-N junction
irradiated by the beta-minus particles would produce,
across its junction, an immense current multiplication.
It appeared that this would be an ideal constant current
generator that would, unlike the solar cell developed
by Bell Laboratories, provide a battery which was in-
dependent of the energies of photon bombardment from
a light source such as the sun. Before anymore can be
said about the nuclear battery, the operation and theory
of a P-N junction must be understood.

At absolute zero temperature, the atomic structure
of intrinsic (pure) silicon, having a valence of 4, con-
sists of 4 electrons in the outer shell orbiting the nucleus.
Now, it is possible to manufacture a silicon crystal that
has an excess of electrons or a deficiency of electrons.
That material with excess electrons is known as an n-
type material. An impurity atom having a valence bond
of 5 is diffused into the silicon. As the impurity atom
combines with the silicon, all bonds will be completed
resulting in the desired 8 electron outer shell and a
free electron in the crystal lattice for conduction. The
overall charge on the impure silicon crystal is zero, but
there still remains the free electron. The energy re-
quired to detach this fifth electron from the atom is

42

only of the order 0.01 ev. To produce the p-type crystal,
an atom having three electrons in the outer shell is
diffused into the silicon. This time all the bonds will be
completed except one, leaving what is referred to as a
hole. In an n-type semiconductor, the electrons are
known as the majority carriers and the holes are called
the minority carriers. Conversely, in a p-type material,
the holes are the majority carriers and the electrons
the minority carriens. Again, however, the overall
charge of ‘the p-type material is zero, but this time it has

the ability to accept an electron instead of donating one.
Obviously, the n-type material is called a donor and
the p-type material an acceptor.

When these two materials are joined together, there
occurs immediately a diffusion of electrons from the n-
material into the p-material and holes from the p-
material into the n-material. These two carriers recom-
bine in the junction area, but this diffusion. will soon stop
due to the creation of a negatively charged area in the
p-material on one side of the junction and a positively
charged area in the n-material on the other side. The
positive area appears in the n-type material because it
was forced to give up an electron and since the initial
charge of the material was _zero, if a negative charge
is taken away, a positive charge will be left. Likewise,
the negative area in the p-type material is caused by
its acceptance of an electron. Since its initial charge was
zero and a negative charge in the form of an electron
was added, its final charge will become negative. This
recombination, however, occurs in a very small area
around the junction, and as one continues out further
from the junction the crystal becomes less positive or
negative (depending on the direction) until the crystal
again has a neutral charge. If an electron tries to go
from the n-type material to the p-type material after
the charges have built up around the junction, it en-
counters a large negative repelling wall just across the
junction in the p-type material and is therefore stopped.
If a hole tries to travel from the p-type material to the

n-type material, it experiences a large repelling positive
force on just the other side of the junction in the n-type
material. Thus, these positive and negative forces actual-
ly act as a retaining wall or energy barrier and the flow
of electron-hole pairs is halted.

It was found that beta-minus particles, which are
electrons being emitted from the nucleus of a disinteg-
rating radioactive source, would produce electron—hole
pairs in a P-N junction. Since any separation of charge
defines a voltage, it may be said that a voltage will

circuit.

Several attempts were made to plate the wafer by the
electroplating method but all failed. The nickel re-
peatedly refused to adhere to the phosphorous and very
little to the silicon. It was also found that the required
current for plating in reasonable periods of time might
well be enough to damage the crystalline structure of
the wafer. This problem was solved by using the recently
developed “electroless” method of nickel plating. Re-

exist when electron-hole pairs are produced by any
means whatsoever. This is the bas-is of the nuclear
battery, where beta particles are used to produce con-
duction electrons and holes.

In order to utilize the p-n junction, it is required
that leads be attached to either side of the wafer. It
is important that contact be made with the wafer
that will not in itself produce another junction. This
would reduce the resultant potential barrier and result
in a severely reduced voltage. The required ohmic con-
-tact, then, is a connection that will not form a diode.

The particular wafer under experiment was a 20 ohm
cm silicon p-type base with n-type phosphorous dif-
fused -one half mil into one side. It is known that nickel
plate will provide an excellent ohmic contact if each
side of the wafer is plated. The major problem now was
to find a way of plating the wafer

In order to nickel plate the wafer, the surface must
be smooth and clean. This is accomplished by etching
the wafer surface with a strong etch solution of 80 cc
concentrated hydroflouric acid plus 20 cc of nitric
acid. The wafer is -then washed in double distilled water
followed by methanol.

The program for making the ohmic contact was to
etch the wafer, plate both sides with nickel, heat to
700 degrees Centigrade in order to diguse the nickel into
the two sides of the wafer, nickel plate a second time to
get a substantial plating surface and then solder leads to
each side of the wafer with regular solder. The purpose of

search in this field yielded information that a hypophos-
phite solution, when heated near the boiling point,
would plate out nearly all the nickel in one to two
hours. It was known that nickel plated out by this
method did not adhere to all surfaces but it was decided
to try it on silicon and phosphorous. The solution used
is slightly different from that set down by the National
Bureau of Standards, but has proven to work well.
Upon heating the solution to 90-99 degrees Centigrade,
the wafer, etched, washed, and varnish—treated around
the edge that had been in contact with the solution. The
wafer was suspended partially submerged in the solution
for 90 minutes. When the wafer was removed, it was
found that the nickel had adhered to that part of the
wafer to prevent short circuit when the nickel plated out,
had indeed adhered to silicon and phosphorous.

Now the remainder of the program was begun. Next,
the water was heated to 700 degrees Centigrade in an
inert gaseous atmosphere in order to diffuse the nickel
into the wafer. At first, most of the nickel peeled off, the
remainder diffused through the phosphorous and ruined
the junction. After plating a second junction, however, a
measurable voltage existed across the junction showing
that ohmic contact had finally been made. The leads
were then attached with ordinary solder and thus the
objective had been accomplished.

To see if the junction operated as a diode, it was
placed in series with a variable resistor and a voltage
divider. An ammeter was place in the circuit and a

43

voltmeter across the junction.

When the circuit was connected, before the battery
was turned on, a current was noted in the series circuit.
The external battery was removed from the circuit
and the current continued to flow, showing the junction
was acting as a battery. This indicated that somehow
elcctron—hole pairs were being created in the junction.
It was noted that when a shadow fell over the wafer,
the current in the circuit dropped markedly. Indeed,
a photosensitive cell had been produced since light
photons were producing electron-hole pairs just as
betas in the vicinity of the junction.

Since the battery is really no more than a p-n
junction diode, it seems that the main difference between
it and the diode is the way the leads are connected.
In the regular diode, a point of contact is used which is
similar to the point of contact in the old radio crystal
diodes. In the battery, however, tthe plating contact is
utilized.

When the junction was irradiated with beta particles,
a current multiplication of two times ten to the fifth
power holes and electrons was experienced across the
junction. As a high energy beta enters the n-type mat-
erial, it strikes an electron in the crystal and transfers
enough kinetic energy to the electron to free it for
conduction, thus creating an electron hole pair. These
two electrons then travel on through the crystal lattice
until they collide with other electrons, freeing them for
conduction as well. This creates a chain reaction in which
two times ten to the fifth power electrons are freed
for conduction for each beta particle. Any particle
that would give the electrons enough energy to free

them could be used but betas are preferred because
their small mass will not disturb the order of the atoms
in the crystal.

It is important, though, to consider the maximum
beta energy because there is an energy above even which
beta radiation will destroy the crystal in that Frenkel
defects or recombination centers are produced in the

44

junction. This would decrease electron multiplication
by increasing the probability of electron-hole recombina-
tion before free electron-hole pairs can cross the junc-
tion.

It is well known that beta radiation covers a spect-
rum of energies rather than being monoenergetic.
Quanta, or bundles of energy are present in the nucleus'
of an atom. It is characteristic of radioactive materials
to possess more energy in the nucleus than the nucleons
themselves can sustain ‘therefore causing energy to be
given off. This is done by some of the quanta spending
themselves in raising the energy of a neutron to a
level that it cannot sustain, thus it disintegrates. When
the neutron disintegrates, a proton is created which
stays in the nucleus and an electron and a nutrino are
expelled from the nucleus. The beta particle and the
nutrino do not share equally in the expulsion energy
resulting in the various energies of the betas as shown
in the energy distribution curve.

It is the end point energy of these betas that must be
considered in order to avoid Frenkel defects. Therefore,
it is desirable to get a beta that has a large peak in the
energy distribution curve that is below the crystal
lattice damage energy point. Also to be considered
is the half life of the emitter, since the life of the battery
is directly affected by the life of the radioactive source.
The half life of a substance is the time it takes for
exactly one half of the substance to decay by radio-
active disintegration. F or instance, the half life of
Ra88 is 1590 years. In other words, if we initially have
10 grams of radium, after 1590 years there will be
only 5 grams and 1590 years hence, 2.5 grams etc.
until all the radium has decayed. As always, cost of the
radioactive isotopes is a final consideration. At the
beginning of the experiments, Promethium 147 which
originally cost 500 dollars per curie, now costing 3.25
dollars per curie, was used. Since approximately 50
millicuries are required for a silicon nuclear battery,
the cost of the radioactive isotopes become negligable.
One curie is the unit of radioactivity in which 3.70 times
ten to the tenth power atoms of substance undergo radio-
active disintegration per second.

At present, phosphorous 32 is being used which has
an end point energy of 1.7 mev and the crystal damage
threshold for silicon is 0.3 mev. The energy of the
betas may be depreciated somewhat by the placing of
a shield between the source and the wafer. This method
is quite inefficient because a vast majority of the lower
energy betas are absorbed by the shield, but the im-
mediate object was to produce a nuclear battery and
this had been done.

Much more research and experimentation is being
done on the battery especially in the nickel plating and
radioisotope fields. While the nuclear battery only
provides small amounts of power, its use in transistor
circuitry may well initiate complete electronic porta-
bility. The research done in this field may also lead
to a way of producing large amounts of energy that will
alleviate the world reliance on fossil fuels as energy
sources.

These are the days of fast cars, planes and rockets.
Engines have now been so well designed that they
now work at almost 100 percent theoretical efficiency.
To make these fast engines run faster and have more
power, we will have to develop new fuels. Our present
fuels are inadequate. The most advanced rocket ships
and jet planes that we have are still powered by kero-
sene and oxygen, or outdated carbon and hydrogen-
oxygen mixtures that were used before the 1930’s.
Luckily, our need for new fuels comes at the right
time in history. Men dream of interplanetary space
travel. The laymen read about it in science-fiction
while the scientist looks upon it as a practical goal.
All know that space travel will come if we can solve
the problem of refueling. The Navy initiated project
“Zip” just after the war. The men on “Zip” were to
find new fuels that could be used in jet aircraft in
order that planes would not have to return so often
to their carriers for refueling. The Navy scientists
working continuously, finally formulated several ideas
for exotic new fuels.

One type of fuel used at present is the boron hydrides.
These are compounds made from boron, a common
element found in borax, and hydrogen. It is interesting
to note that mules, one of the slowest means of trans-
portation, were once used to haul borax, the product
which _now fuels our fastest planes. Although many
other types of metal fuels, like beryllium hydride,
could have been used, boron fuels were picked be-
cause they fit the following requirements:

(1) Their flame temperature isn’t above the melting

point of combustion chamber alloys.

(2) They are plentiful.

(3) They can be manufactured.

(4) They are stable or non-explosive.

The only disadvantage to using boron fuels is that
their vapors are slightly more toxic than those of
gasoline, but this drawback is hardly worth noticing.

Nuclear power is another type of exotic fuel. It
doensn’t burn but does react chemically. The word
fuel at one time was limited to buring substances, but
when nuclear power was discovered, the word had to
be redefined, and it now covers any kind of energy,
nuclear, solar or electrical, as long as it delivers 25,000
btu per pound.

There are many advantages to using an atomic
fuel that would heat liquid oxygen and expell it as a
gas from a nozzle at the rear of the rocket. One con-
sideration is the tremendous thrust the engine would
deliver; it would be five times the thrust of t liquid
hydrogen-ozone mixture. Also liquid hydrogen has the
advantage of being non-explosive. But since a heavy
shielding would be required to minimize the danger
of .radioactivity, this is not too practical a fuel to use
except in space.

A third exotic fuel is one made from ions. Products
made from ions ar eeven more powerful than nuclear

fuels. They produce a thrust of about twice that of
a nuclear-powered rocket. On a specific impulse scale
the values compare 1800 to 900. This fuel would be
made from radicals or parts of molecules. These radi-
cals usually exist for a millionth of a second and can
be found in many high speed reactions. A molecule
consisting of only a carbon-hydrogen bond or a nitro-
gen-hydrogen bond is made by passing an electric
current through methane and ammonia. The one dif-
ficulty of this process is that these radicals are unstable
and must b estabilized by immediate freezing at mius
425 degrees F.

After a rocket gets into space, sunlight could be
used instead of an atomic pile to heat hydrogen. This
would be a fourth type of exotic‘ fuel. It would require’
a mirror of about 30 feet in diameter to do the job.
The advantage would be great: only 1000 pounds of
mirror compared to the 40,000 pounds of fuel or shield-
ing that would be needed when other types of fuel
are used. Its disadvantage, however, would also be
great. It would have so little power that only 160
pounds of thrust could be effected. This would not
get the engine off the ground. Other types of engines
using modifications of these fuels have been proposed.
For example, an ionic engine could be made by using:
atomic power to run ‘generators and convert cesium
to ions which could be accelerated and used as thrust.
Other methods would try to stabilize pure hydrogen
and use it as a fuel. Still another method would be to
use radioactiye material to increase the energy of
combustion.

It is. important here to note that each type of fuel
has a different purpose. Fuels used in the atmosphere

and for travel to the moon or other plantes will be
be called “earth fuels.” One can tell them apart by
applying the following propulsion rules:

(1) Turbo and ram jet fuel must release enormous
amounts ofheatr. per pound.

(2) Rocket fuel must release a large amount of
heat, but. have light molecular weight exhaust
for more power.

(3)‘ Fuels for space travel must release enormous

46

amounts of energy but need not produce intense
heat.

Boron fuels can be used in gas, liquid or solid form;
consequently, they are quite versatile. The liquid fuels
are used in jet planes and small rockets where space
and density are important. The solid fuels are used
in big rockets where large molded charges are im-
portant. Also, solid fuel rockets are used when immediate
firing is needed. They don’t take the long slow fueling
process that liquid fuels need. In the upper atmosphere
ions can be used as a fuel because they are plentiful
at these heights. When outer space is reached nuclear,
solar or even some type of magnetic power could be
used.

In the future more money will be spent on developing
new fuels. Callery Chemical Company and Olin Mathie-
son Corporation were the first two companies to explore
this field. They have spent over $100 million to begin
production. The government itself is spending about
billion dollars on rockeﬁry. It is expected that after all
this money is spent fuels will finally be developed‘ which
can be used for all different types of engines, civilian
as well as military. Our present carbon base fuels are
expected to run out in ten years. By that time, however,
we hope that the cost of manufacturing boron fuels
will be about the same as the cost of manufacturing
carbon fuels is at present. A decade ago, boron hydride
was a curiosity that sold for five thousand dollars a
pound. Thus, the outlook for equalizing price is a
possibility. A billion dollar industry will come from a
box of Borax.

As the new fuels become more common, today’s
engines will have to be modified to accomodate both

conventional and high energy fuels. If boron fuels are
used, in today’s engines, they form clogging exhaust
products, but by adjusting the combustion chamber
these fuels can be made to burn cleanly.

With these new fuels we may be able to get into
space. When that occurs, fuels and engines will soon
be developed that will enable man to approach the
speed of light. Inter-galactic travel, man’s most dazzling
dream, will then be possible.

The rotundisc shuddered, then a great weight settled
on my head and chest. The red of the sky quickly
changed to purple and black. I couldn’t help feeling
a little thrill of excitement along with a tightening
lump in my stomach. I had thought and dreams of
this moment for several echels and now, it was a reality.

It takes a great deal to drive a man away from the
only home he has known for 14 lunars. But some-
thing had to be done and done quickly before all
Acirema settled into a bloody civil war. It had all
happened suddenly after our leader Jonar had left
the planet on Solar course 41 through the eighth di-
mension. The three Lecture Houses of Acirema had
functioned smoothly until then. Each had its own pur-
pose in our society.

The first Lecture House was dedicated to the subject
of establishing the Arts. The Art General of the school
was considered the supreme authority on art at Aci-
rema. He was instructed by the Block Council under
Jonar to maintain a high level of planetary art. If
anyone selected to attend this house, the Art General
issues Artistic Directives and the art incumbent merely
administers the perfunctory task of completing the
works.

The second Lecture House was headed by the Classi-
fication General. It is he who approved or disapproved
of scientific and mathematical formulae which the
attendants of the Lecture House offered to him. Under
Classification General come such offices as the Attend-
ant of Canal Fortifications, the Attendant of Extra-
gravitational Propulsion and the Attendant of Atmos-
pheric Content and Liquid.

The third Lecture House wass established for the
promotion of General Ethics. It is here that the current
so’cial and religious trends are promulgated by the
Ethics General.

After _]onar’s loss, the three Lecture Houses began
to oppose each other. One of the first things new stu-
dents were taught in the Lecture House at Plebia was
to unlearn everything previously learned. It was for
this reason that the three Lecture Houses were systema-

50

  

tically renamed: The Lecture House for Unlearning
Classifications and Ethics; the Lecture House for Un-
learning Art and Ethics; and the Lecture House for
Unlearning Art and Classifications.. I had always no-
ticed an amorphousness of ill-feeling among the three
schools. This fact was readily apparent by the titles
which were boldly displayed in large Motho letters
above each school’s entrance. It was for this reason,
I suppose, that the Common School Committee was
first established.

The Common School Committee seemed to act as a
mediator among the three Lecture Houses. Its twelve
members were selected by the three Lecture House
Generals. Each Lecture House’s four members must be
approved by the other two Houses. The term of the
members is continuous until one af the Committee dies.
It is then that the terms of all the members expire, and
the Schools must propose four new members for the
Committee. The usefulness of the Common School Com-
mittee became more and more doubtful as time went
on. Lately, it has been meeting only every second illu-
mination, and then only to assign students to a suitable
school.

When I wanted to enroll in a school at Plebia, I
contacted my Canal Chairmen who in turn instructed
the Block Council of my intentions. The next step in
giving assignments was a series of tests administered
on the seventy-fifth daiz of the one hundred eighty-
seventh biplanetary proximation. I had wanted to be
assigned to the Lecture House of Unlearning Arts
and Classifications where a friend of mine was an in-
structor in the Ethical Process of Complete Self-
separation. But as luck had it, I was classified as being
particularly capable in the capacity of Assistant Attend-
ant of Extragravitational Missles. I didn’t realize how
fortunate this mal-assignment would be. With the
process of assignment completed, I soon began my
journey to Plebia.

\Nhen I arrived in Plebia, I was immediately thrown
into the sphere of academic responsibility. The first
term was spent in learning the rudiments of the Lee

turc House and in unlearning all art and ethics. The
process of unlearning art was particularly disconcerting.
Art, I was told, cannot be beautiful because it cannot
be systematically adapted. I knew this to be wrong”
but I was forced to accept it outwardly. Any disagree-
ment would have disgraced the Common School Com-
mittee which had judged me especially suited for my
place at Plebia. Ethics, likewise, was condemned since
all ethics are abstract and therefore cannot be formu-
lized or categorized. But it was a fact that everything
must be capable of being classified in order to exist.

The second term was not very difficult. It consisted
in studying the methods and divisions of classification
as set forth by the Classification General. The third
term was dedicated to a useless review of the preceding
two terms. The time of the fourth and final term was
consumed in the student’s personal thought of the
concepts taught. The climax of student action at Plebia
consisted in the unconditional acceptance of all points
established.

The major crisis occurred just as I had finished

my final term. Caedmon, a member of the Common
School Committee, died. The other eleven members
immediately amended the laws reducing their size to
eleven. The three Generals and the populace began
to protest the usurping of our governmental laws but
the Committee was ready. Police set up impenetrable
ray bands around the entrances to the Central Com-
mittee Palace. It was now evident that an oligarchial
tyranny was being perpetrated with no one person
having enough power to resist except our lost leader
Jonar.

This thought ran through my mind as the radar
scanner began to pick up outlaying asteroids in the
dreaded asteroid belt surrounding Planet Osmo’s outer
orbital. If Jonar was still alive, I would find him here.

How to get steel tubes to harness highest
steam pressures and temperatures

IN constructing Philadelphia Electric Company’s revolu-
tionary new Eddystone power plant, engineers had to
harness the highest combination of pressure and steam
ever achieved in a central station with 5,000 psi at 1,200° F.
This called for superheater tubes (see diagram above) ofa
special stronger steel never before used in steam power
plants. No one had ever succeeded in piercing this tougher
steel to make seamless steel tubing.

The problem was given to Timken Company metal-
lurgists, experts at piercing steels for 40 years. And they
turned the trick. They made the steel for the platen and
finishing super-heaters with the alloying elements in just
the right balance for perfect piercing quality. They pierced
20 miles of tubes free from both surface and internal ﬂaws.

Timken Company metallurgists and Timken steels have
solved all kinds of tough steel problems. They can help
you on problems you may face in industry.

And if you’re interested in a career with the leader in

really rough it —

checks their stamina

RIPPER SHANKS and clevises at the business end of
a high—powered tractor lead a torturous life as
they tear through overburden and rock.

No place here for a flaw to ruin performance! So
Caterpillar makes sure of their stamina—has them
radiographed at the foundry that casts them. This
is the place for any imperfection to be shown up.
For here Radiography can do two things. It can
make sure that only sound castings go out. It can
point the way to improving casting technique so
that a consistently better yield can be had.

Radiography is but one branch of photography
that is working day in-—day out for the engineer. It
is saving time and cutting costs in research and
development, in production, in sales and in oiﬁce
routine. You will ﬁnd that in whatever ﬁeld you
choose, photography will be ready to serve you too.

As Radiography becomes more important
in the business and industry of tomorrow,
there are excellent opportunities for sci-
entists who want to grow in this ﬁeld. If
you have a doctoral degree in physics and

a desire to follow radiography as a career,

Q.

Mr. Savage, should young engineers
ioin professional engineering socie-
ties?

By all means. Once engineers
have graduated from college
they are immediately “on the
outside looking in,” so to speak,
of a new social circle to which
they must earn their right to be-
long. Joining a professional or
technical society represents a
good entree.

How do these societies help young
engineers?

The members of these societies
—mature, knowledgeable men—
have an obligation to instruct
those who follow after them.
Engineers and scientists——as pro-
fessional people—are custodians
of a specialized body or fund of
knowledge to which they have
three deﬁnite responsibilities.
The ﬁrst is to generate new
knowledge and add to this total
fund. The second is to utilize
this fund of knowledge in service
to society. The third is to teach
this knowledge to others, includ-
ing young engineers.

Specifically, what benefits accrue
from belonging to these groups?

. There are many. For the young

engineer, afﬁliation serves the
practical purpose of exposing his
work to appraisal by other scien-
tists and engineers. Most impor-
tant, however, technical societies
enable young engineers to learn
of work crucial to their own.
These organizations are a prime
source of ideas—meeting col-
leagues and talking with them,
reading reports, attending meet-
ings and lectures. And, for the
young engineer, recognition of
his accomplishments by asso-
ciates and organizations gener-
ally heads the list of his aspira-
tions. He derives satisfaction
from knowing that he has been
identiﬁed in his ﬁeld.

Consultant— Engineering Professional Relations

How Professional Societies

Help Develop Young Engineers

Q.

What contribution is the young en-
gineer expected to make as an ac-
tive member of technical and pro-
fessional societies?

A. First of all, he should become

3’

active in helping promote the
objectives of a society by prepar-
ing and presenting timely, well-
conceived technical papers. He
should also become active in
organizational administration.
This is self-development at work,
for such efforts can enhance the
personal stature and reputation
of the individual. And, I might
add that professional develop-
ment is a continuous process,
starting prior to entering col-
lege and progressing beyond
retirement. Professional aspira-
tions may change but learning
covers a person’s entire life span.
And, of course, there are dues to
be paid. The amount is grad-
uated in terms of professional
stature gained and should al-
ways be considered as a personal
investment in his future.

How do you go about ioining pro-
fessional groups?

While still in school, join student
chapters of societies right on
campus. Once an engineer is out
working in industry, he should
contact local chapters of techni-
cal and professional societies, or
ﬁnd out about them from fellow
engineers.

Does General Electric encourage par-
ticipation in technical and profes-
sional societies?

It certainly does. General Elec-
tric progress is built upon cre-
ative ideas and innovations. The
Company goes to great lengths
to establish a climate and in-
centive to yield these results.
One way to get ideas is to en-

courage employees to join pro-
fessional societies. Why? Because
General Electric shares in recog-
nition accorded any of its indi-
vidual employees, as well as the
common pool of knowledge that
these engineers build up. It can’t
help but proﬁt by encouraging
such association, which sparks
and stimulates contributions.

Right now, sizeable numbers of
General Electric employees, at
all levels in the Company, belong
to engineering societies, hold re-
sponsible ofﬁces, serve on work-
ing committees and handle im-
portant assignments. Many are
recognized for their outstanding
contributions by honor and
medal awards.

These general observations em-
phasize that General Electric
does encourage participation. In
indication of the importance of
this view, the Company usually
defrays a portion of the expense
accrued by the men involved in
supporting the activities of these
various organizations. Remem-
ber, our goal is to see every man
advance to the full limit of his
capabilities. Encouraging him to
join Professional Societies is one
way to help him do so.

“Your First 5 Years” published by

sional Development Which you may
