Until a few years ago no direct evidence had
been available on the health effects of radiation in
man at the low levels and low dose-rates en-
countered from nuclear weapons fallout or peace-
time operation of nuclear power reactors. The
present note presents data indicating that serious
effects on human health such as sharp increases in
infant mortality appear to have occurred from the
radioactive gases released in the course of the
normal operation of commercial nuclear power
reactors generating electricity.

The evidence consists of an analysis of the
changes in mortality rates of infants that died before
reaching the age of 1 year in the area surrounding
the Dresden nuclear power station located near
Morris, Illinois, 50 miles south-west of Chicago.

Dresden I is a boiling water reactor (BWR) that
has been operating since 1959, with a licensed power
of 700 thermal megawatts and an electrical output of
210 megawatts. It uses a single coolant loop in which
the steam generated by the nuclear fuel is taken
directly outside the containment vessel to drive a
steam-turbine. As described in a detailed study
published in March 1970 by the Bureau of
Radiological Health of the U.S. Department of HEW
(BRH/ DER 70-1), (1)the non-condensible fission
product and activation gases in the coolant are re-
leased..from a stack after a hold-up time of only
about 20 minutes. The principal gases released are
Krypton-87 and 88 and Xenon 135 and 138, with half-
lives of 76 minutes, 2.8 hours, 9.1 hours, and 17
minutes respectively. Since 1961, the total annual
gaseous waste discharges have ranged from 34,800 to
800,000 curies in 1969, compared with a licensed
maximum release of 22,000,000 curies, or very much
greater than the annual discharges of 0.001 to 0.350
curies from the submarine-type, pressurized water
reactor (PWR) at Shippingport, Pennsylvania, that
uses a separate secondary coolent loop to limit the
escape of fission products into the environment.

As reported in the HEW publication, during the
years 1967-68 when the total annual discharges were
240,000 to 250,000 curies, the radiation-dose rates
directly under the plume 1-2 km from the plant
ranged from 13 to 40 R/hr, corresponding to 114 mr
to 350 mr per year. When averaged over 2 weeks by
means of thermoluminescent dosimeters, the dose
rate was found to be between 2 and 3 RI hr above the
natural background of 9 R/hr. On an annual basis,
this is a dose between 17 and 26 mr, compared with
the natural background dose of 88 mr per year in the
area. The plume of radioactive gas could be iden-
tified as far away as 15 km or 9.4 miles north-east
from the stack, where it resulted in a dose-rate of
22mr year during a typical 10-minute measurement.

These dose-rates may be compared with the
maximum value of 56 mr/ year measured at the
nearby Argonne National Laboratory by P.E.
Gustafson (2) from fission products in the ground
during the peak of nuclear weapons testing in 1963,

and the maximum permissible dose of 170 mr per
year to the average population according to the
present Federal Radiation Guide levels accepted by
the AEC. These local dose-rates are more than
10,000 times higher than the average dose-rate from
all reactor operations to the U.S. public as a whole of
about 0.001 mr per year cited by the AEC (3).

In Illinois during the mid-1960’s infant mortality
had reached levels about 60 per cent in excess of
expectations based on the trend prior to large-scale
testing (Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, December
1969). (4) Since the dose-rates from the gases emitted
by the Dresden reactor are of comparable
magnitude, it appears that significant increases in
infant mortality might be detectable in the areas

downwind from the prevailing westerly winds
that should not be observed in
direction.

thirds of the population of Illinois, or some 6.6
million people, live within a radius of 50 miles from
the reactor, the infant mortality rates for Illinois as a
whole should show increases and decreases
following the rises and declines of the short-lived
annual gaseous activity released into the air.

That such a peak in infant mortality did in fact
occur following the peak in the radioactive gases dis-
charged may be seen from Figure 1, where the infant
mortality rates for Illinois have been plotted together
with those for a comparable large northern urban
state, namely New York. Also shown in this figure is
the annual amount of radioactivity discharged into
the air from the Dresden reactor as reported in
another recently published HEW study (BRH/DER
70-2) (5).

Examination of Figure 1 shows that in 1958, just

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER_.APR|L. ‘I971

prior to the startup of the Dresden Reactor, the
states of Illinois and New York had closely similar
infant mortality rates of 24.9 and 24.5 per 1000 live
births respectively. It is of interest that Illinois ac-
tually showed a lower death rate than New York in
1962 when localized fallout from the large Russian
H-tests in 1961-62 occured in the New York area.
However, in 1964, a year after the rapid rise in
emission from Dresden, the mortality rate for Illinois
began a sharp climb while that in New York began to
decline, giving rise to a period when the Illinois
infant death-rates exceeded those for New York by
2.7 per 1000 births in 1968, with an absolute peak of
25.6 per 1000 births in 1965. This was a rate higher
than encountered in Illinois in the eleven preceeding
years, despite heavy Nevada testing during this
period.

This rise of infant mortality in Illinois after the
test-ban had come into effect in 1963 must be
contrasted with the decline in New York and all
other urban areas of the North, a situation that has
now led Illinois to become the state of highest infant
mortality among all the states in the entire North-
East and North-Central regions of the U.S. It
should be noted that although a nuclear re-
actor began operating in New York State 20

miles north of New York City in 1962,
it was a pressurized water type (PWR)
with annual gaseous emissions typically

10,000 times less than those for the Dresden reactor.
(5) If this rise for Illinois as a whole relative to New
York and all other states of the north is causally
related to the gaseous emission from the Dresden
BWR reactor, then the difference in mortality rates
should be directly related to the annual amounts of
short-lived radioactive gases discharged. That this
does indeed appear to be the case is shown in Figure
2 where the difference in infant mortality rates
between New York and Illinois has been
plotted against the amount of radioactivity
discharged. Least-square fits for the two periods
1963-67 and 1963-1968 have been calculated,
showing a clear positive association between
radiation dose and effect on infant mortality.

A similar direct correlation was found to exist
for death-rates due to respiratory diseases other than
pneumonia and influenza for all age groups in Illinois
relative to 1959 and the amount of radioactive gas
discharged. While during the decade from 1949 to
1959 these diseases, which include emphysema and
bronchitis, increased less than 10 per cent in Illinois,
they rose 75 per cent between 1959 and 1966 in
direct proportion to the amount of radioactive gas
dicharged. Furthermore, while Illinois respiratory
death-rates rose 75 per cent, they increased by only
40 per cent to 47 per cent in heavily polluted Penn-
sylvania and New York. In Figure 3, the difference in
the relative increase of respiratory disease deaths
other than pneumonia and influenza has been
plotted together with the annual gaseous releases

(Continuecl on Page 33)

from Dresden. It is evident that the death-rate in-
creased at about the same rate as the gaseous
emission. with a time-delay of one to two years.

A more stringent test may be obtained by
examining the relative changes in infant mortality for
the counties immediately adjacent to the one in
which the reactor is located, and to compare the
changes in the counties located downwind with those
upwind as well as with similar counties more than 40
miles away to the north and west as controls.

Fig. 1 Infant mortality rates per 1000 live births (0-1
year) for Illinois and New York compared with
radioactive gas emission from the Dresden Nuclear
Reactor (1959-1968). The excess of Illinois over New
York mortality rates is indicated by shading.

Figure 4 shows a map of the counties in nor-
thern Illlinois together with their total populations in
1964, the year prior to the peak emissions from the
Dresden reactor located in Grundy County. The
figures for infant mortality as well as the numbers of
live births and infant mortality rates for the years
1964 and 1966 taken from the U.S. Vital Statistics are
listed in Table I for Grundy and the five adjacent
counties, as well as for six control counties located to
the west and north-west that do not border on the
Illinois river into which liquid effluent is discharged.
The year 1964 is the year following a minimum in the
gaseous activity released, just prior to the sharp rise
in 1964-65. The bar-graph of Figure 5 indicates the
per cent changes in infant mortality by 1966 relative
to 1964 for the six adjacent and the six control
counties.

Inspection reveals that among the six nearest

10

counties, Grundy, the county in which the reactor is
located, shows the greatest increase of infant
mortality rates, namely 141 per cent in excess of the
1966 rate. Next in increased is Livingston, to the
south with a rise of 140 per cent, followed by Kanka-
kee to the south-east with a rise of 43 per cent. Will
to the north-east showed only a 5 per cent rise, while
LaSalle to the west actually showed a small decline
of 7 per cent and Kendal to the north registered a
decline of 21 per cent.

This tendency for upwind counties to show‘

declines such as took place nearly everywhere else in
the U.S. and all over the world since 1964 is con-
firmed by the bar-graph for the six upwind control
counties more than 40 miles away, namely Lee,
Knox, Stephens, Henry, Winnebago and Ogle, where
only the last named showed an increase.

The probability of obtaining this result by
chance alone may be shown to be less than 1 in 200
by applying a simple statistical ranking test, and
using the expectation that the downwind counties
adjacent to Grundy should show increases rather
than decreases in mortality rates by 1966. A sim-
ilar test applied _ to the yearly excess mor-
tality rates for Illinois relative to New York for the
two 5 year periods before and after the sharp rise in
emission which began in 1964 gives a probability of
less than 1 in 250 that the observed ten year pattern
of excess mortality rates in Illinois relative to New
York would arise by pure chance alone. Inasmuch as
these two tests are independent, the likelihood that
both of these results are the result of mere chance
fluctuation must be regarded as much lower than for
either of these tests alone.

The likelihood that a causal relationship exists is
further increased by the fact that data published in
June 1970 by Dr. Alice Stewart of Oxford University
in the British medical journal “Lancet” (6) indicates
that the human embryo in the first three months of
its development appears to be some 500 times as
sensitive for the induction of leukemia and other

Fig. 3 Excess respiratory disease death-rate for
Illinois compared to New York vs. annual

and influenza, and the excess rates per 100,000 are

began to operate.

cancers as the mature adult, and that cancer in-
cidence was directly proportional to the X-ray dose
received.

Dr. Stewart’s study involved some 19.5 million
children born in England and Wales between 1943
and 1965, of which some 13,407 developed cancer
before age 10. Dr. Stewart concluded that a dose of
only 1 rad or 1,000 mr, given to a million infants just
prior to birth in the course of pelvimetry, resulted in.
300 to 800 addition leukemia and other cancer cases:
over a period of 10 years, compared with a spon-
taneous rate of about 700 per million births. When
the x-rays had been given in the first three months of
pregnancy, as happened in about 3 per cent of the
cases, the risk increased 15 fold, corresponding to a
dose of only 80 mr needed to double the normall
cancer mortality rate among the children.

Since for mature adults, a dose of 1 rad leads to
only about 2 cases per year of leukemia per million
individuals irradiated (7) or to 20 cases over period
of 10 years corresponding to a “doubling dose” of 50
to 100 rads (500,000 to 100,000 mr), it appears that
the early embryo is much more severely affected by
radiation than the adult, in agreement with ob-
servations on laboratory animals. Yet it was in the
basis of the low sensitivity of the adult that the
present radiation standards were developed in the
1950’s before Dr. Stewart’s early data (8) had been
confirmed in 1962 by the work of Dr. Brian Mac-
Mahon at the Harvard School of Public Health (9).

The measured radiation dose rates in the range
of 10 to 300 mr per year downwind from the Dresden
reactor could well have resulted in three-months
doses of 2 to 75 mr to the early embryo during its
most critical phase of development. Since in any five
week period the present AEC regulations allow a
maximum dose equal to the full annual amount of
500 mr to any individual in the general population,
they imply that a six-fold increase in childhood
cancer and leukemia is an acceptable risk to the
population in return for the benefit of nuclear
electric power generation. The measured doses do

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER__APRIL, 1971

not take into account the various biological con-
centration mechanisms in the organs of the mother
and the developing infant in utero for the radioactive
cesium, strontium and yttrium daughter products
among the rare gases emitted from the reactor.

It appears reasonable to expect that effects on
the chromosomes of the embryonic cells which lead
to underdevelopment and reduced ability to fight off
respiratory and childhood infections are produced at
about the same doses as chromosomal changes that
lead to cancer development. On this basis, the
radiation levels produced by localized weapons fall-
out or reactor operations measured for the case of
Dresden and other reactors that emit large amounts
of gaseous activity are of a magnitude sufficient to
explain the observed rises in infant mortality.

The excess infant mortality in Illinois over that
in New York leads to an estimated number of about
2,500 infants that died above normal expectations in
Illinois over a ten year period between 1959 and

1968.

casual effect, it would appear to be necessary to

gaseous releases from the Dresden nuclear plant, it is

possible to compare the time variation of the

mortality rate in Illinois with that in neighboring
states.

Fig. 6 shows such a comparison for Ohio to the
east, separated from Illinois by Indiana, such that the
Ohio border is 200 miles from the Dresden reactor. It
is clear that no significant rise in infant mortality
such as occurred between 1963 and 1967 in Illinois is
found for Ohio. Taking Ohio as a control state with
its comparable mix of urban and rural population,
there is a strikingly close, year-by-year correlation
between the difference in infant mortality rates for
Illinois relative to Ohio and the annual releases from
Dresden as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8.

Calculation of the correlation coefficient for the
data shown in Fig. 8 gives a value of 0.8652, with a t-
value of 4.5651, corresponding to a probability of a
purely accidental correlation P < 0.01. Thus, the
association is both positive and highly significant,
further supporting the hypothesis of a causal re-
lationship. The least-square fitted line to the data
gives a 2.1 per cent increase in mortality for every
100,000 curie released for Illinois as a whole. Since
the majority of the population lives at distances of
about 50 miles distant, for areas as close as 10 miles,
the per cent increase would be at least 5 times as
large.

Still another test of such a causal association
with the gas release from Dresden may be un-
dertaken by comparing the infant mortality data for
Indiana with those of Ohio and Illinois. Since In-
diana is located between these two states or at
a distance between 40 and 200 miles from the
reactor, the hypothesis would require that the infant
mortality rate during the period of heavy releases
from Dresden should lie between the rates for
Illinois and Ohio, while prior to 1961, during the time
of heavy atmospheric testing, all three states should
show approximately the same infant mortality rates.

That this is indeed the case may be seen in Fig.
9, where the infant mortality rate for Indiana is in-
deed found to fall between that for Illinois and Ohio,
with the indication of a clear peak during the same
period when the Dresden plant showed its greatest
rise in emission.

In this instance, we've just removed a traffic-snarling casualty
from a crowded expressway. Now, we'll concede that this
might be considered a relatively modest contribution towards
improving the human environment.

But. . . this same Sikorsky® helicopter could have been
effecting a rescue mission off a wallowing tanker in a North
Sea gale. It could have been airlifting food and supplies to
starving villagers in flood-ravaged Tunisia. . . or transporting
equipment for on-the-spot control of off-shore oil pollution.

Obviously, what we're pointing out is the impressive record
and adaptability of our helicopters in solving important
human problems.

There's much more to come in our world of exciting, advanced

Westinghouse the teacher?

Westinghouse Learning Corporation has launched a
computerized teaching system that lets each child
learn at his own rate.

Our studies for the Defense Department will lead
to the “hospital of the ’70s,” and a level of efficiency
and economy unknown today.

Houses? We’re not talking about the thousands of
units completed or under construction. We’re talking
about the new plant we’re building to mass-produce
modular houses.

Our computer-based information systems improve
police efficiency, speed up court administration.
We’re marketing electronic security systems for
homes and plants.

We’ve developed waste-disposal units for neigh-

the medic?

the builder?

the crime fighter?
the urban planner?
the ecologist?

borhoods, sewage treatment plants for cities, a
smokeless refuse plant that reclaims rather than
destroys.

We’re transforming 16 square miles of Florida into
a new city. lt’s the bellwether for hundreds of thou-
sands of acres, bought or leased, here and abroad.

The list goes on. Everything electrical, of course-
from nuclear power plants to light bulbs. And aero-
space, oceanography, broadcasting, rapid transit.

It all means that Westinghouse has openings for
skilled engineers——e|ectrical, mechanical, chemical,
industrial. And we also offer job training for the un-
skilled as another step toward increasing productive
employment for the disadvantaged people of our
country. An equal opportunity employer.

On some campus in the U.S. this year
a well-intentioned interviewee is going to
confuse us with the Foremost Machine
Company or some other FMC.

We’11 understand.

Having only letters for a name might
be sophisticated in some circles.

But sometimes it’s just plain hard to re-
member.

Perhaps we should explain how it came
about.

FMC doesn’t mean Ford or Foremost
or anything else but FMC. Way back long
ago it used to mean Food Machinery
Company. And later on, it stood for Food
Machinery and Chemicals.

But 10 years ago because we’d become
so diversified, we dropped the name,
although for obvious reasons we kept the
initials.

It makes sense. We became the nation’s
largest producers of rayon. We built Deep
Dive for the navy’s underwater salvage
teams. And we continue to turn out
such diversities as railroad cars, printing
presses, cranes, barges, compact tractors,
automated food plants, and dozens of in~
dustrial chemicals. The list goes on and on.

Most of what we produce never gets
seen by the public, so our name is seldom
visible. Worse,‘ it sometimes gets confused.

So remember: FMC means FMC. If
that still doesn’t do it for you, write us at

ES-'1” is a 4 credit first course for first
semester freshmen engineering students. By
producing authentic inventions, students
discover their creative talent. By repeated
achievement the student realizes he can and
does invent. By frequent introspection and
analysis, inventive ability is recognized,
cultivated and developed. The course is
available to all students.

“Who me? Conceive an invention? No! No!
Officer, call a cop.” Not all freshman students seem
incredulous to the notion of producing inventions.
The most amazing almost incredible discoveries can
be made by both the educator and the student; that
invention can readily be taught and learned. In-
venting is a joyful fascinating and inspiring activity.
It is fun in purest form.

Engineering Series One (ES-1) is the first of a
series of Engineering courses. It is open to all
university students and is taken by first semester
freshman engineers. Consisting of two subjectsin
one course, about half of the time available is spent
on engineering graphics and the other half on
creative design.

No language is more exact and concise than the
engineering sketch for transmitting a design concept
and for its eventual implementation. Graphics is
indispensible to the inventing constituent of this
course. The two parts fit together as precisely as
hand in glove. A concept becomes or is only when it
can be expressed and transmitted but first, it has to
be created.

In graphics, lettering isometric projection and
pictorial presentation is taught. The term effectively-
communicative-descriptive-geometry best describes
the graphics part of this course. This paper concerns
in the main the creative design sector of ES-1.

As salt is to the taste and physical well being,
innovative ideation is to the mind. The essence of
serendipity is to conceive an original concept, a
premiere. In engineering, the “ fabulous future” will
depend unequivocally on the engineers’ power of
inventive conception. The problems that technology
produces; environmental, economic, material and
other will and can also be solved by engineers.

Creative skill becomes more necessary as our
problems become wider in scope and more complex.

Embryo engineers are taught to use the
mechanistic model of the creative process shown in
Figure 1. Problem sensing is an innate skill inherited
in glorious abundance. Most complaints are a result
sensitive perception. Almost everyone knows what’s
wrong about his car, government, the educational
process or what have you. But not so in technology.
It’s very possible for the engineer not to be aware of
his technological problems. He needs to be extra
sensitive in perceiving a problem, the main one,
where and when it exists.

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER__APRlL, I971

Discovery and Cultivation of Talent

Problem definition is the crux of good sense.
The real problem is usually extra illusive. Finding
What the real problem is, is the key to its solution.
Defining the problem so that the definition does not
exclude imaginative solutions or preclude
unimaginative ones is an art. Before embarking on a
search for a solution a great deal of practice is
needed in properly defining the real problem. In
industrial research, it is quite possible to spend
considerable time and effort solving the wrong
problem, also it is frequently very difficult to identify
the real problem.

Fact finding comes next. Most of the
educational process is devoted to building up fact
funds. It is essential to find as quickly as possible
what has been done and what is being done now. The
“state of the art” is a magic term for the inventor. It's
dejecting to “reinvent the wheel”. The literature,
consultants and experience are all sources of facts.
University students are in the unique position of
having access to information from industrial
resources which are not available to the competition.
The “recent state of the art” may be gleaned from
surveying “what’s on the market”. Most of industry is
geared up to mass produce before unveiling a new
product because of the inadequacy of our existing
patent situation.

The ideation phase of this course is at the top of
the hierarchy of importance. The young inventors
are taught brainstorming supplemented by the
Concept-Element Matrices method (1). Osbom’s (2)
rules for brainstorming are:

a) Judicial judgement is temporarily ruled out.

b) Free Wheeling is welcomed, the wilder the
idea, the better.

 

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER_APR|L. 1971

c) Quantity is precious.

d) Combination and improvement are sought.
Hitch-hiking on other ideas is encouraged. Ideas are
listed on lecture pads as rapidly as possible or tape
recorded.

In the Concept-Element-Matrix method,
column lists of attributes bothrelevant and seeming-
ly irrevelant are prepared. In _idea finding, beginning
students can and do bog down. Some may stop and
even give up completely. To speedthem through this
delicate and essential phase of the design process
concept-element matrices can be prepared. The
instructor may suggest column-list titles but very
quickly students learn to supply these for them-
selves. It is fun. They enjoy brainstorming the
column titles as well as the column elements.
Brainstorming can be used to generate concept-
element matrix column topics and students can be
programmed for brainstorming by learning and
practicing the Osborn rules. Some of the column
topics should be apparently irrelevant to the
problem as deﬁned. They may appeal to emotions
and wishful thinking. They -may represent desire for
the ideal system or ideal conditions. Optimism and
enthusiasm must prevail. Analogies both direct and
indirect in “other wor ” are employed. For
example, the anology of physical vulnerability could
be political vulnerability. Evocative questions which
stimulate emotional response are excellent media for
the brainstorming team captain. Force fitting
techniques are applied ‘to the elements of Concept-
Element Matrices. Engineering analysis is applied.
The new idea mustmeetthe criteria of cost, prac-
ticability, acceptance, and various special criteria as
required. The idea -best surviving the engineering
analysis and meeting all the criteria and constraints
is selected. This is called the decision phase. Im-
plementation, scale drawings are pre-
pared by which the new concept may be com-
municated to craftsmen and technicians so the
product or system may be built. When possible, a
scale model is constructed and substantiating
calculations, criteria tests and performance
specifications are presented and explained.

During the teaching of ES-1, it has been ob-
served that in group brainstorming a team member
will not ideate if he has a “good idea” in mind and
wants to express it. Only after he and every member
of the team have expressed their “good ideas” and
put them down on paper or on the board, is the team
ready to begin creating “new” ideas. The above is
usually referred to as the “purge phase” of the
brainstorming process.

Soon tests will begin on
a bright idea for roofing
stadiums with stainless
steel balloons. And nickel’s
helping make it happen.



It sounds like something out of Jules Verne. Actu-
ally, it’s fresh out of our advanced design studies.

A gigantic, inﬂatable metal lid that can be stretched
across a football stadium without any pillars or posts of
any kind.

The idea is so mind-boggling that most people have

a hard time visualizing it.

Think of a pie that’s hollow inside, with the bottom 

and the top made of a metal skin only 1 / 16th of an inch

thick. When the air is pumped into the pie, the whole l

thing gets so rigid it can be jacked up into place over the
ﬁeld and never even ﬂutter during a Windstorm.

The weather stays outside, the players don’t slide
around on their backsides, and the spectators don’t
drown. Somehow, the whole thing seems a little more
civilized than a public mud bath.

And the cost could be as little as 1/3 of a conven-
tional trussed roof.

The metal is nickel stainless steel. The nickel is
there to make the skin easier to work, and to give it the
necessary toughness and strength. Plus corrosion re-
sistance.

It’s a fascinating idea, this revolutionary roof of
ours, and scale models are about to be thoroughly tested.

But the point of the story is this. Just as our metal

‘is a helper, one that makes other metals stronger, or
‘easier to work with, or longer lasting, so International

in the future, and to set about creating them. Some-
times, we come up with whole new concepts—like a stain-
less steel balloon for a stadium roof.

PART I

WHAT ABOUT YOUR
IMAGE?

By Linda Zakrzewski

“Self-centered, conceited, starved for female
companionship, studious” — remarks such as these
met may queries concerning the attitude of the typ-
ical engineer at Pitt. The whole cyle of questioning
arose rather innocently when a friend casually re-
marked that she, a CAS student, hated to attend
science and math courses with engineers. Arousing
my engineering loyalties, this observation caused me
to turn my attention to the stereotyped “engineer”
image on campus.

The title “engineer” seems automatically to
bring to mind visions of a male student who is either
a math and science genius, or who spends all his time
shackled to his science texts. Often enough criti-
cisms of engineers as individuals wrapped up in their
own world who are too busy to concern themselves
with campus affairs in general are included with ref-
erences to their studious attitude. Ironically enough
despite all the modern miracles of technology made
possible by engineers working for the betterment of
mankind, the engineering profession seems to be re-
garded as somewhat cold and detached.

Obviously as a female image my initial objection
to this stereotyped image is the fact that the typical
engineer is necessarily depicted as male. Aside from
this, however, I also question the validity of the
stuffy attitude attributed to engineers in general. The
heavy study load carried by engineers naturally
somewhat limits social activities, but does not justify
the scathing jokes I’ve grown accustomed to hearing
concerning the engineer’s obsession with his slide
rule and calculus book. Why on the other hand is
there so much more prestige attached to the aura of
amed student, though he too must spend hours slav-
ing at the books? He must spend just as much time
with his stethoscope as the engineer does with his
slide rule.

26

As regards the engineer’s supposed starvation
for female companionship here at Pitt and his sup-
posed immaturity in relationships with girls I can
only remark that I feel the insufficiency of females in
their classes directly accounts for this. Although
there may be many advantages in having humanities
classes for engineers separate, I do feel it makes
classes more boring and seriously impedes oppor-
tunities for engineers to associate with females. As
the situation exists now a total enrollment of eight
freshman women in the entire freshman class results
in a typical weighted male-female ratio.

To those critics of the engineer who say that his
preoccupation with his work is so great as to make
him easily recognizable in a crowd, I can only say
that the conversation of an English major distin-
guishes him just as easily. Obviously one is expected
to discuss one’s interests.

When considering the important doubts raised
concerning the interest of the engineering student in
his surroundings I think it’s rather interesting to ana-
lyze participation in Engineer’s Week activities.
There‘ are undoubtedly those who are very willing to
work and those whose enthusiasm greatly advances
group projects. By the same token there exists a dis-
tressingly large band of engineers who employ the
uninvolved and disinterested attitudes of the stereo-
type as an alibi, and in some ways even as a justifica-
tion. An apathetic attitide can never be rationalized
by claims that engineers do not have sufficient time
to get involved, since those who take time to partici-
pate are living examples to the contrary.

In general I do not place much merit in the
stereotyped image as presented, and I find myself
seriously questioning whether the engineer’s image is
a product of his attitude, or whether his attitude is an
attempt to live up to this image.

HOW MANY ENGINEERS CHEAT?

HOW EFFECTIVE ARE THEY?
By Tom Getting

Recently, Bob Bretz, Art Editor of the
Skyscraper, proposed the idea of surveying a
cross section of the undergraduate School of
Engineering as to whether they obtain help on tests
and copy homework. Three hundred confidential
surveys were printed and distributed to various
seminars. A copy of this survey appears in figure I
and under each question appears the results of this
preliminary survey.

Surveys were taken to the Mechanical
Engineering seminar, but unfortunately they didn’t
meet that week. Freshman results then were ob-»
tained from the Freshman Seminar and all upper--
classman responses were obtained from the Civil
Engineering Seminar. There were a total of 151
resnonses and 37 upperclassmen. Although the
sample may seem small, this was only a preliminary
survey to determine whether or not we should

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER_APRIL, 1971

continue and expand our efforts. The results were
startling and next year another survey including
many more students will be taken and published in
the Skyscraper. Nevertheless, we can be sure that the
freshman sample size is adequate since 114 responses
tend to approach 50 per cent of the class. We will
concern oursleves with the freshman sample and
note that even though the upperclassmen sample is
small, the figures tend to approximate the freshman
sample and confirm its results.

To determine validity, the Skyscraper staff
consulted Professor Harry Wolforth, Associate
Chairman of Industiral Engineering. Professor
Wolforth advised using a percentage validity test
which consists of

.. P,(o-P3
O"\/“T'_

where P = Percentage and n = size of the sample.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEERJPRIL. I971

Using the data that we have obtained, the interval for
question I is 45.1%to 63.5% _For those of us who
aren’t statistically minded, 95% of the time that we
administer this survey, the percentage of people
answering “Yes” to question I will be in the range of
45.l%to 63.5 0/oThis means that we can safely say that
one-half or 50%of our sample has cheated at some
time on tests. To project this further, (if our sample
is random) then 50% of the freshman class has
cheated on tests. Using the same validity test on
questions 2 and 3, we obtain ranges of 68.3%to 84.370
for question 2 and 10% to 23.2% for question 3.
Projecting question 2, we can say that 75%of the
freshman class has copied homework. One very
interesting correlation was that people with lower
grade averages tended to copy homework while the
people with higher grade averages did not. The
students tend to cheat just to stay in school. By far
-the majority who cheated felt it did not improve
their grades.

As an educator, Professor Wolforth felt that
these statistics fairly well reflected the situation
in our school. Professor Wolforth cited room
conditions as the basic cause of cheating. He felt that
too many of his classes were “crowded” into the
rooms. In order to keep the temptation of Cheating to
a minimum, plenty of space between students is
essential. Other factors, as cited by Professor
Wolforth, include make-up exams and enforcement
of penalties for cheating. He felt that taking make-up
exams is a form of cheating since part of the impact
of not knowing exactly what material was being
tested was lost. The severity of the penalty is in itself
the major hindrance to enforcement of the cheating
code. Aside from that, conclusive evidence is
necessary and is hard to obtain.

We also consulted Dean Hoelscher with our
results and sought his comments. He felt that many
of the students who cheat do so in order to stay in
school. Dean Hoelscher was adamant in stating that
“there is no reason or rationale for giving a closed-
book examination in the School of Engineering.” He
felt that engineers should not be tested solely on
their memory of equations but on their ability to
apply them in problem solving. Dean Hoelscher also
said that there should be some collaboration on
homework if one does not understand the problem,
but not straight copying of problems. When asked
about instituting the honor system at Pitt, he
remarked that four years ago the faculty seriously
studied possibilities of its implementation but
decided that since this system has not been a
tradition at Pitt, the likelihood of its functioning
properly was not too great.

We recommend, therefore, that since it is
impossible to prevent copying homework, home-
work should never be counted towards a grade but
should be corrected and returned to the student for
his own use. Tests should be open-book, thus

28

negating the advantage gained from a crib sheet.
These are corrections in the system that should have
been implemented long ago for other reasons besides
merely the cheating issue.

“If I wanted to, I could cheat on almost any tests; I
never did, though.”

“There are not enough supervisors to watch for
cheating.”

“It (cheating) doesn’t pay in the long run.”

“These courses are so rough that cheating only hurts
yourself; you can’t cheat all the way through. If a
teacher plays fair with me, I’ll play fair. One
question: why are tests so ridiculously hard?”

)3

“The heavy work load makes it inevitable . . .
“It doesn’ help; why do it?”
“The Skyscraper has no right to discern from

students confidential information which will be
published and circulated around campus.”

“The people who don’t know what is going on cheat
and get higher marks than the poor fools like myself
who understand the material but are too honest to
cheat.”

“The emphasis is on grades.”

“Cheating is possibly the only way to keep up with
and pass these idiotic courses.”

THE ISOLATION OF THE
ENGINEERING STUDENT BODY

By Lou Conley

From the first day of Freshman Orientation until
the last day of Winter Term Finals, the Freshman
Engineer feels isolation, frustration and alienation
from the rest of the university community.

During orientation, the first term Engineer is
separated from the rest of the Freshmen. His
seminars and lectures are different from those in the
College of Arts and Sciences. Already, he is
classified as an “Engineer,” separated from the rest
of the university. Usually, this is the first time the
Freshman has been away from home. He feels alone,
all alone.

For the first time during orientation, the Freshman
Engineer learns about the likelihood of his flunking

\

out or switching his major. Throughout his first two
terms, the freshman hopes and prays that his QPA
will not eat him up.

During these first two terms, the Engineer feels
like a social outcast. Ninety-seven plus per cent of all
Engineers are men. Every class which Freshman
Engineers must take are exclusively for Engineers.
He is isolated from the Freshmen in the University.

The Freshmen Engineers do not belong to any
Engineering Department, unlike the Juniors and
Seniors. They have no sense of identity in the
Engineering School. All this adds up to a feeling of
frustration and isolation for the Freshman Engineer.

Now that I have taken up residence in the
nation’s capital, I have learned one thing at least —
not all the wisdom is in Washington. Washington
doesn’t have all the answers.

There’s a story going around about the little boy
whose father had been laid off by an aerospace
company — a company that shall be nameless —
whose house had been destroyed by an earthquake,
whose location I will not mention, and whose baby
sister was badly in need of such necessities of life as
milk. He decided to write a letter to God.

“Dear God,” he wrote. “Will you please send me
$100 so that my parents can buy milk for my sister?”

In due time the letter showed up in Washington,
perhaps either because of the conscientiousness or
the ineptitude of the postal service. It eventually
wound up in the Department of Labor. I do not mean
to suggest that the diety resides in the Labor
Department — or even that he is a next-of-kin.

But, in any case, the letter was opened by some
Department secretary. Her heart was touched by this
simple request, so she took five dollars out of her
purse, slipped it in an envelope, and returned it to
the little boy.

When he received it, he promptly sat down and
wrote another letter to God.

“Dear God,” he began, “thanks for the five
dollars. It was not as much as I expected. Next time
please don’t route my requests through
Washington.”

Perhaps some of you in the technical com-A

munity feel the same way. If you do, I can only
suggest that the burden of requests on Washington is
a heavy one, the resources are finite, and the
judgments not infallible. It is better to deal direct.

In spite of all this, may I add that we are not
unaware of what has been happening in the scientific
and technical areas of our economy. And certainly
we are not insensitive to the plight of our technically
trained people who, after years of valuable service to
their own discipline and to the nation now find
themselves out of favor — or even out of jobs.

At the outset, let me try to put the whole
situation in perspective.

Sec. of Labor Speaks

Address of Secretary of Labor J. D. Hodgson
March 8, 1971

The nation is clearly in the midst of recording its
priorities. This is evident in many ways but perhaps
in no way more clearly than in the President’s budget
message in which he spoke of meeting human needs,
of a “new fairness in America,” and a goal of “a full
generation of peace.” The budget puts increased
emphasis on such things as health, environment,
housing, welfare and other programs to meet these
needs. Policy decisions made now will of course have
their effect upon allocation of resources far into the
future.

But you people in the technical community —
and particularly those of you in aerospace — have
already felt the impact of these changing priorities.
In the last two years the industry has lost about
350,000 jobs. Our best estimate is that cut-backs in
these years have resulted in unemployment for
50,000 to 65,000 scientists, engineers, and technical
people in the industry. Just last year alone, the
unemployment rate for professional people has
doubled.

All this has happened at a time of overall
economic slowdown — a situation that has affected
employment in all sectors of the economy and has
made the absorption of displaced scientists and
engineers more difficult than it otherwise would
have been.

Now, this sounds like a rather gloomy picture —
and for the man out of work it certainly is. No
economic explanations or long-term forecasts are
going to solve his immediate needs. We will return to
his problem later on. But for the moment, I think it
might be profitable to stay with that we may describe
as the macro-view.

Numerically, engineers and scientists will
represent only a small proportion of the unemployed
— perhaps 10/o.Even though the rate of professional
and technical unemployment has doubled in the last
year, it is still at about 3%, far lower than unem-
ployment in general. It is 1/3 the level for minorities
and less than 1/3 that for young people, for instance.
I mention this not to minimize the problem but
merely to put it in national policy perspective.

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER_AF’R|L. 1971

on Engineering Unemployment

I’
An’,

Furthermore, we now see signs that the situation
is easing. For the general economy we have achieved
some cooling off in the rate of inflation and are now
embarked on a policy of orderly expansion. The rate
of unemployment has now declined for two months
running, and we expect before year-end to see a
really pronounced downward movement in both the
number of unemployed workers and the un-
employment rate. We see, further, a leveling off in
the decline of defense and space budgets. Our
friends in the Department of Defense believe we are
nearing the end of the line in job decreases for tech-
nical employees.

These are encouraging prospects for the near
future. Even more encouraging are the long-range
prospects. We believe that the total number of
engineers needed in the decade of the 70’s may well
exceed the supply. Today we have about 1 million
engineers employed in the U.S. By 1980 we believe
the nation will need 1.5 million. This means an
average of 50,000 new engineers a year just to fill the
ranks of those who retire or otherwise leave the field,
it’s more like 75,000 a year. The fields in which they
will be needed are widely varied — computers and
other electrical equipment, architectural services,
machinery design, construction, scientific in-
struments, chemical engineering, and others. And in
many of these it looks now as though the supply may
not meet the demand.

If I may digress a little, one of the dangers of the
present temporary surplus is that our young people
may consider it as a sign of things to come and opt
out of technical careers in increasing numbers. If this
happens — and some people in technical schools
believe it is beginning to —— it could be a tragic mis-
take, both for the individual and for the nation. I can
assure you that if I had a son or daughter who was
casting about for career opportunities, I would have
no hesitation in recommending engineering, science,
or some other technical area.

We cannot afford to turn off the spigot on the
future just because the present tanks are above the
waterline. We cannot generalize from one situation
or project from one period of time.

I recall that back in May of 1949 the Bureau of
Labor Statistics issued a bulletin on “Employment
Outlook for Engineers” that has since become
famous, or perhaps more correctly, “infamous.” “In
the next few years,” the Bulletin noted, “the number
of graduates will greatly exceed the demand for en-
gineers.”

Well, you know what happened. In the next year
came Korea, and the predicted surplus turned into a
vast shortage. In 1951 magazines like Fortune were
headlinging “A Helluva Shortage of Engineers,” and

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER__APRlL. ‘I971

the Bureau of Labor Statistics quickly scurried for
cover by issuing a supplement proclaiming “a
serious shortage of engineers has developed since

mid-1950 . . ”

Admittedly, this was an unforseen, war-related
shortage. Responsible forecasting is not predicted on
such national emergencies, though of course the
haunting doubt is always there.

But few people foresaw Sputnik either. In a
technological age no one can predict exactly what
creative outburst will trigger the next great technical
surge. But one can be sure growth patterns will
emerge — for whatever reason.

The possible shortage we now foresee in 1980 is
not based on war-induced expansion. Our forecast
for 1.5 million engineers in 1980 is based on more
comfortable and more comforting assumptions — an
improved international climate, the continuance of
past economic trends, and the new social and en-
vironmental tasks that we see ahead. These tasks —
such things as massive programs in urban develop-
ment, an aggressive national housing goals program,
improvement of the environment, and upgrading of
health services — may be supported by the “new
humanists,” but they will be solved by the “old
technologists.” They are all problems with a high
technical content.

And they will not be solved without money — a
great deal of money. In this connection, I should
observe that the only way our nation will be able to
afford to do all the massive jobs we have ahead is by
increasing our national productivity — and here we
are counting heavily on the fruits of research and the
techniques of technology. Our nation’s productivity
started slumping badly in the mid-sixties and, it is
now showing encouraging recovery. Nevertheless,
we must make a determined effort to sustain long
term productivity gains at a higher rate than in the
past, and we are counting on technology to help do
it. Many area of our economy could benefit by a
major technological transfusion, and I do not think
we have yet begun to explore the many ways in
which technology can boost our productivity while it
refines the quality of our lives.

Well, these are fine words for the future, and I
believe them. But, as our British cousins might say,
“Fine words butter no parsnips.” What about the
here and now? What about those technical people
who have already lost their jobs or are in imminent
danger of doing so? What can be done, what are we
doing, for them?

When you think about it, just what can the
unemployed technical man — say the unemployed
aerospace engineer — do?

31

He can sit around and wait for his company to
get new defense contracts and call him back. It is not
a very realistic course. We cannot realistically look
for an imminent comeback in space and defense
spending. We can look for a leveling off but not a
return to 1968 peaks. And even a leveling off reflects
a diminishing share of gross national product and a
relative decline in job opportunities.

The engineer can simlarly hope that his com-
pany will be able to convert a good share of its
business to commercial products and rebuild its
workforce. It is a faint hope. Defense companies
have a long history of frustration in such efforts and
have not met with conspicious success.

Another propsect, often described in glowing
terms, is corporate penetration of the new fields in
social and environmental areas. These opportunities
are in the cards, but they are not opening up rapidly,
and there is some question whether defense com-
panies can undertake them without major read-
justments in personnel and expertise.

I would not rule out these possibilities. Some —
maybe all — offer long-term promise. But the em-
ployment problem is not long term but now.

And the remaining course is the most realistic
one for our unemployed friend — to move into
other areas of the county or economy.

Think back a bit. Where did the aerospace
engineer come from? I know because I recruited
tens of thousands of them. Most of them came from
traditional sectors of the economy — from other
industries, from government, from universities. It
may be hard to accept the fact, but nonetheless,
these are the sectors to which most of these people
will return. This is where the jobs will be found. And
I think it is our job in the Labor Department to help
facilitate this movement.

Not only the individual but the nation stands to
gain by this course. By infusing technical talent into
non-defense areas, even service areas, of the
economy, we should be able to spread the
technological wealth and help increase our national
productivity. The best way to transfer technology is
to transfer people. The current situation presents the
nation not only with a need to be filled but an op-
portunity to be grasped.

Movement requires mobility, By this I mean not
only geographic mobility, although this is obviously
important, but also occupational mobility. Engineers
and scientists, maybe some of you in this room, must
be prepared to move out of places and industries
where jobs no longer exist into places where they
can be found more readily.

Admittedly, this is not easy. One of my former
associates in the aerospace industry speaks of a
double barrier — the barrier created by the un-
employed technical worker who limits his op-
portunities by his lack of mobility, and the barrier

32

created by the employer, who imperfectly under-
stands how he might use the kinds of talent the
technically trained man or woman can offer. Both
barriers must be broken.

We in the Labor Department, as well as other
government agencies, are trying to break them. I
don’t intend to weary you with a long catalogue of
what we’re doing, but I think I can group these
programs under some general heads.

First, we’re trying to get the unemployed person
and the potential employer closer together. Our
National Registry, developed in cooperation with the
National Society of Professional Engineers and the
affiliated California Human Resources Development
Agency, is now serving as a central clearinghouse for
applications and job openings throughout the nation.
By the middle of last month we had received about
2900 applications and 570 job openings. Not spec-
tacular — but a start. Our Job Banks program now
operates in over 60 cities and will cover more than
100 major metropolitan areas by midyear. It offers a
daily computerized listing of local job opportunities.
The Department of Defense for one is encouraging
its contractors to list job openings with these Banks.

So that’s one thing — bringing jobs and job
hunters together. We’re also trying to provide
counseling on how and where to find jobs. For
example, in cooperation with the American Institute
of Aeronautics and Astronautics we’re sponsoring;
workshops in 34 cities. Through January more than
6000 professionals had participated in these Work-
shops, and their reaction to date has been good.
We’re exploring the possibility of refining and
employing the selfhelp methods now being used by
such organizations as Talent Plus and Experience
Unlimited and encouraging State agencies to set up
Job Information Centers to coordinate the work of
volunteer agencies in employment and financial
counselling, resume preparation, job development,
and placement efforts.

And we have institutional and on-the-job train-
ing, either already started or just about to be, that
will provde training for perhaps 1500 engineers or
scientists. This training is for a wide variety of oc-
cupations, including environmental engineering,
technical marketing, and bio-medicine.

Just last week we announced with the Depart-
ment of Housing and Urban Development a new
program which will put some of our unemployed
aerospace scientists and technicians to work on
solving urban problems. The program will initially
orient and employ from 400 to 600 people. If it
proves successful, it could be expanded to cover
2000 people or more.

So here are some of the things we have been
doing. I don’t say they are enough, and we are
looking for ways to do more. President Nixon has
become actively involved. Just last week, for

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER._APRlL, ‘I971

example, at the President’s request, the Office of
Science and Technology brought together
representatives of private industry, government,
national professional engineering and scientific
societies, and the academic world to discuss the
effectiveness of what is being done to explore other
actions to alleviate employment problems of
scientists and engineers in the aerospace industry.
We are trying to step up our efforts. The skills and
talents of our scientific and technical people are a
national asset we can ill afford to lose.

I have been talking about our current unem-
ployment problems. I do not want to end on this
unhappy note. Many people, I know, have seen these
problems as a reinforcement of a presumed growing
sentiment against all science and technology. It is
true that the citadels of science are under siege these
days, and some have fallen on the battlements. But
the future itself is not in doubt. Science and
techology remain our great hope for the future, as
they have in the past, and you who are tilling the
vineyards of technology will have a greater role to
play in the future than ever you have played before.
It may be a somewhat different role because it will
hopefully be suffused with larger vision and an ex-
panded consciousness of human values. But it will
be, as always, an essential one. As Dr. Glenn
Seaborg has suggested, the advancement of science
is essential to” the advancement of man. Indeed,
there may be very little difference.

So, I congratulate you on all you have done to
date, and I think I can assure you that in spite of the
problems of today, the opportunities of tomorrow
shine bright. We are looking to you to help us realize
those opportunities for the nation and all mankind.

(Infant Mortality Continued)

A similar situation should exist for Michigan,
just north of Indiana and located north—east of
Illinois on the other side of Lake Michigan at a
minimum distance of 80 miles from the Dresden
Plant. Again, based on its shorter distance
from the Dresden Plant as compared with
that of Ohio, one would expect the rates to lie
somewhere between those for Illinois and Ohio after
the end of the Nevada tests. As Fig. 10 shows this 1s
indeed the case, Michigan moving from a position
lower than Ohio in 1958 and 1959 to a position higher
than Ohio but below that of Illinois, even showing
small peaks in coincidence with the peak emissions
from the Dresden Reactor in 1962 and 1964-66.

These additional tests therefore tend to greatly
strengthen the hypothesis that the Dresden Reactor
releases were the major factor in accounting for the
infant mortality rises in Illinois between 1963 and 67,
the effect being directly proportional to the amount

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER_APRIL, 1971

of gas discharged and diminishing with distance in a
manner consistent with this assumption.

As a final test, one can compare the pattern of
infant mortality in Illinois with a state located
generally upwind to the north—west more than 500
miles away, where infant mortality rates were the
same during the period of heavy atmospheric tests in
Nevada, despite very different socio-economic and
demographic characteristics namely North Dakota.

It is seen that shortly after the end of nuclear
tests, infant mortality dropped rapidly from its peak
value of 25.7 per 1,000 births in 1957 similar to that
of 25.5 for Illinois to 16.9 by 1968, where Illinois
showed a strong peak between 1963 and 1967 and a
failure to decline below 23.4 by 1968.

All these observations are therefore consistent
with the hypothesis that during the period of low-
altitude kiloton weapons testing in Nevada from 1951
to 1958, the short-lived gaseous radioactivity re-
leased into the lower troposphere accounted for the
failure of infant mortality to decline further, and that
for Illinois, the releases of short-lived radioactive
gases from the Dresden Reactor led to rises of infant
mortality to levels similar to those previously ex-
perienced in Illinois as a result of atmospheric
weapons testing. H

Both the levels from weapons testing and
nuclear plant releases led to comparable external
gamma dose levels as confirmed by measurements
made at the nearby Argonne National Laboratories.
These facts tend to substantiate the hypothesis that
levels of nuclear radiation from fission reactor
releases of only a few per cent of the amounts
regarded as harmless under present AEC regulations
10CFR20 are apparently capable of producing large
increases in infant mortality rates ranging from as
high as 150 per cent near the reactor to a few per
cent as far away as 100 to 200 miles.

(Expected of an Engineer Cont.)

Ability to communicate. You will be expected to write
proposals, reports, articles, letters; give oral presentations to your im-
mediate supervisor; have meetings with your fellow employees and
technical associates. All these communications should convey precisely
and concisely what you want them to. I often damn the computer for
doing what I tell it to do and not what I want it to do. In the same sense,
you must strive to make your words effectively convey what you mean.

Ability to work effectively with others. Perhaps the most important
characteristic you can possess is an ability to get along with other people.
Tolerance of the viewpoints ofothers, and application of the principal of
the golden rule will serve you well. W. J. King has written an excellent
pamphlet that is well worth your reading. It is titled "The Unwritten
Laws of Engineering,” and is available through the ASME, 345 E. 47th
Street. New York 10017.

Knowledge of engineering fundamentals. On rare occasions you may
be called upon to use one or two of the technical facts you picked up in
school. This item is perhaps least essential, since (1) by your degree you
have demonstrated your ability to learn and (2) it is only rarely that the
lack of specific knowledge represents a serious stumbling block to the
young engineer.

As a concluding note, it is well to remember that a job, like anything
else in life, is largely what you make it. If you apply yourself, seek ways in
which you can contribute, and actively learn, there is no doubt of your
becoming a successful engineer. Good luck!

This new 900 foot long bridge is the latest example of the trend to maintenance-
free galvanized steel bridges. It is the Hauterive Bridge over the Manicougan
River, 250 miles north of Quebec City, Canada. CI Because of its relatively
remote location, designer Emile Laurence gave special consideration to the
taxpayers maintenance dollar. He specified a zinc overcoat to protect the
bridge against corrosion and also avoided possible damage from tall loads by
eliminating any upper wind bracing. The designer placed the deck higher than
usual—approximately 14 ft from the lower chord. This made it possible to use
very deep bridging to insure stability. The composite deck also acts as wind
bracing, supplementing the stiffness provided by the horizontal bracing at the
lower chord, so that the whole acts as a tubular truss. CL Most of the steel was
hot dip galvanized while other members were metallized with zinc. E In bridges

The way it is, kids choke on polluted air. Streets are

But that’s not the way it has to be.

Air pollution can be controlled. Better transportation

General Electric engineers don’t look for overnight

Beneath this soft and.warm exterior,
there lies a heart of plastic.

So far, it’ s only a valve. Eight-year-old
Janet Hernandez has one.

It may not be long before a whole
working heart will be made out of plastic.

Men in plastics research at Union
Carbide are working on the almost im-
possible job of designing plastics com-
patible with the body.

Their most crucial job is making an
ultra-thin polypropylene fabric for lining
the inside of the heart. A fabric coated
with parylene that will allow human tis-
sue to grow into and around it to keep
blood from clotting.

A plastic heart isn’t the only part of
the body we’re working on. Maybe some-
day there will be a little plastic in all of us.
Right now, we’ve got you surrounded

b our plastics. We wre in plastic -

fore most people knew the word. We
make more plastics than anyone else. We
. haven’t scratched the surface yet.

Why is a great big company like Union
Carbide so concerned about a little bit of
plastic for the body?

Because.

Beneath our corporate exterior, there
beats a heart.

What is Expected
ofanEngineer..... 

. . . . when, and IF he gets a job?

By Dr. Gordon W. Brown

AS LONG AS THERE ARE engineering graduates, the subject of
what will be expected of them as they begin their new careers will be
timely. A fair share of a senior’s time is spent deciding who his future
employer will be, what department he should go with, what types of
activities he will engage in, and whether he can handle it. Very probably,
considerations such as these were part of the reason for your joining
IEEE, and undoubtedly formed the core of many of your student branch
meetings. Fortunately, humans are adaptable, and engineers more so.
You will find that, within wide limits, one employer is not better than
another, just different! (There’s your rationalization for choosing the
highest offer.) In assessing what will be expected of you, there are two
broad qestions which arise: What your new employer expects you to do,
and what he expects you to be.

What you will be called upon to do will depend, of course, upon the
size of your company, the department in which you have accepted a
position and, perhaps most of all, your immediate supervisor. If your on-
the-job training is handled properly, you will be given an assignment
which is interesting to you, of value to the company, and a challenging
learning experience. If you are in a design group, you might be faced
with the design of a component or small system with the guidance of
your supervisor. Analogously in production, a cost analysis or time-
motion study of a particular operation would be appropriate. In sales,
you would be called upon to become familiar with your company's
products and their application, possibly by specifying a portion of some
large order.

Occasionally there are unfortunate cases of overhiring, stock-
piling, and poor training programs that tend to shove a new engineer into
a corner with nothing to do. If you find yourself in such a situation, seek
ways to actively participate. Don't allow yourself to twiddle your thumbs
and draw pay — you’ll regret it. Such situations are much less likely to
occur in today's economy, however, in which employers are selecting
engineers much more carefully. For at least the next few years a new
graduate is more likely to find himself overworked than underworked.

Expect your first assignments to be interesting, of value, and
challenging. Expect also, however, some drudgery. There will un-
doubtedly be reports, paperwork, and red tape, all of which can be
frustrating and time consuming. Make the best of it, and most im-
portantly, do your best with it.

What kind of a person you are is intimately connected with what
you will do, or rather how you will do it and how your employer will rate
your performance. Personal habits and attitudes, as well as abilities, are
important — far more important than what your specific assignments
consist of:

Naivete. A good employer will not expect you to know everything.
He will expect you to ask what you may think are stupid questions. In
fact, he may feel that you are not sincrely interested if you do not ask.

Willingness to learn. This ties in with naivete, but also implies a
desire and ability for continuing your formal and informal education.
Many of you EE’s will, through self learning, become ME’s, CE’s,
meteorologists, and social psychologists before your careers are over —
or even well established. Expect this, and as far as possible, encourage it.

SKYSCRAPER ENG|NEER_APRIL, 197!

If you approach your job with a positive attitude toward learning,
you will benefit personally and your employer will benefit. Most em~
ployers look for this and.regard highly such evidence as the MS degree
and Professional Engineer registration.

This latter item deserves special note. Many of you have already
taken the Engineer In Training (EIT) exam in preparation for the PE
exam in a few years. Professional Engineer registration is often required,
particularly in government engineering work, and even if it is not, the
fact that you pursue registration is a measure of your enthusiasm for your
career. Seriously consider obtaining PE registration and taking the EIT
exam at your first opportunity.

Responsibility. Under this heading fall most of the important
requirements of a good engineer. Whatever task you are given, you will
be expected to handle it responsibly. This implies thoroughness — any
task should be done completely. When any task to which you are
assigned is considered by you to be done, your employer will expect it to
be just that — done in such a way that will not require him to have all or
part of it redone. To achieve this often requires patience and per-
serverance — check and recheck alternatives and examine objectives
and techniques. Engineering is often simply a matter of inteﬂigent choice
between alternatives. You will frequently find yourself faced with a
choice between two equally valid alternatives. At such times, be decisive
— make a choice. Very often all too much time and money are wasted
hemming and hawing over which way to go. This indecisiveness can be
more costly than going the wrong way.

Management makes decisions based on the information you give
them. If you mislead them, they may very well make the wrong ones. If
you have made a mistake (which you will!), be honest about it. If errors
in a design are covered up, they will invariably come back to haunt,
through failure of a device or system, or somebody else's system will be
cheaper and better.

Company interest. Your employer will expect a certain degree of
loyalty and gratitude. Nearly every company at first loses money on its
young engineers —‘ frequently for the first six months to a year. It ex-
pects you to ultimately be productive enough to make up this loss. In
addition, your normal cost to a company is, depending on overhead,
$100 to $200 per day. It often comes as a shock to young engineers to
discover they must be worth this plus a profit to the company.

While a company cannot demand your loyalty forever, you owe it
to your employer to go to your new job believing that there is a
reasonable chance that you will make your career in the company.

Creativity. You would not have been hired if your employer did not
think that you were creative. The act of creation has been defined as the
resulting interaction of two independent matrices of perception and
reasoning. You will be expected to bring your education and particular
knowledge into contact with that of your new colleagues, and into
contact with the products, output, and techniques of your employer,
searching for the creative interaction that results in improvements, new
techniques, new products, and new customers.
