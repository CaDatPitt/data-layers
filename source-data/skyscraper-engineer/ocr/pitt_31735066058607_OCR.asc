beautiful girl appear on the “faceplate” of his instrument.
(He’s in New York, she’s in Switzerland.) While on the
telephot, Ralph gives the girl his autograph at her request,
by means of a telautograph attached to the devise as
standard equipment.

Jules Verne’s “Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The
Sea,” is a story of the submarine Nautilus. Verne, con-
trary to popular belief, did not invent the submarine for
this novel. He named his craft for the submarine Nautilus
that Napoleon bought from Robert Fulton in 1797. But
there are very few points of similarity between the two
vessels. Verne’s Nautilus is a submersible ﬂoating palace
with everything on it operated by electricity-——'propulsion,
cooking and lighting. “In the library . . . the electric light
ﬂooded everything; it was shed from four unpolished
globes half sunk in the volutes of the ceiling.” After this
successful ﬁctional lighting of the Nautilus by incandes-
cent bulbs in 1870 and their use, again, in Verne’s “The
Underground City,” 1877, Edison apparently accepted the
challenge and patented his light bulb in 1879.

Television— (“The electric transmission and reception,
either over wires or by radio, of transient visual images
in such a way as to give a substantially continuous and
simultaneous reproduction to the eye at a distance”)—
should probably not be ascribed to any one inventor. Like
Topsy, it “just grew,” and took a good half—century to do
it. Nevertheless, it was anticipated in science-ﬁction by
150 years or more.

In Tiphaigne de la Roche’s “Giphantia,” 1760, the host
shows the traveler events going on simultaneously in all
parts of the world—images being “remitted” to the re-
ceiver by an ingenious use of mirrors. William Harben’s
“Land of the Changing Sun,” 1894, tells about a “viewing-
plate” in the King’s palace which shows views from
many places throughout the land. This time, the effect is
achieved through a telescope invention assisted by elec-
tricity. In H. G. Wells’ “When the Sleeper Wakes” the
Sleeper is shown events taking place all over London.

It is probably true that the progress of science has had
more inﬂuence on science-ﬁction writers than the writers
have had on inventors, since the former is a matter of
fact, the later" one of conjecture. Science—ﬁction writers
dream up wonderful inventions— sometimes impractical,
often absurd——but once the device actually has appeared
in advance of technology, the writers “take the ball and
run with it.”

Dozens of science-ﬁction ﬂying devices preceded the
Wright Brothers—at ﬁrst, fantastic uses of artiﬁcial wings
to imitate the ﬂight of birds; later, various types of
“ﬂying chariots.” Motive power progressed from elbow
grease” to electricity—with some form of propellers called
by various names, as “revolving helices,” or “steel roto-
scopes.” The helicopter principle, which intrigued Leon-
ardo da Vinci, was employed at least as early as 1886
(“spiralifers”). Verne, in “Robur the Conquerer,” 1886,
predicted that the principle that would ﬁnally be success-
ful would be one employing “aeroplanes, which are merely
inclined planes like kites, but towed or driven by screws!”

Then came the Wright Brothers in 1903——and again
science—ﬁction writers took off with the airplane, using
the actual invention this time, but again still far surpass-
ing the state of the art. Even while the brothers Wright
were barnstorming with a ﬂimsy bi—plane, the aircraft in
science-ﬁction stories became gigantic, ﬂew farther, faster
and higher. In Aldous Huxley’s “Brave New World,”
1932, airplanes travel in the stratosphere and ﬂy from
America to Europe in six hours; planes in “Sometime,”
by Robert Herrick, 1933, fly around the world in 24 hours.

Space ﬂight, last to come true, was ﬁrst to be written
about in science-ﬁction. Lucian of Samosata, in “Icaro-
menippus,” second century, A.D., has his hero cut wings
from large birds, strap them to his own arms, and ﬂy to
the moon. Then, in 1610, Galileo published his “Sidereus
Nuncius,” describing the universe as revealed by his tele-’
scope——and science-ﬁction writers started using astronom-
ical science in their stories of space ﬂight.

vehicle. Space conveyances, accordingly, became closed
—globes, spheroids, cylinders, projectiles. A favorite con-
ﬁguration for spacecraft among science-ﬁction writers of
the 19Q0’s and 1930’s was the cigar—shaped vehicle (long
cylindrical body with rounded ends), as exempliﬁed by
the spaceship Astronaut in R. H. Romans’ “The Moon
Conquerors”, published in SCIENCE WONDER QUARTERLY
1930. (This was an earli ,  not actually ﬁrst, use of the
term, astronaut.)

Apparently unable to foresee that the terriﬁc expense
of the conquest of space would limit most of such en-
deavor to government expenditures only, writers of space
stories has the vehicles built by whimsical millionaires.
Also unable (or unwilling) to accept the idea of the tre-
mendous thrust necessary to lift a Vehicle off earth’s sur-
face and propel it to an escape velocity, the writers were
prodigal of cubic footage. Space ships like the Astronaut

In 1638, Francis Godwin wrote “The Man in the
l\*Ioone,” in which his hero trains ganzas (geese) to pull
him through space on a raft. Otherwise, his book was
quite scientiﬁc, even describing the moon’s lesser gravita-
tional attraction, though this was many decades before
Newton stated his principles of gravitation. For the next
200 years after Godwin, writers described space trips to
the moon and other orbs, all more or less scientiﬁc in tone
with the exception of the space vehicles themselves, which
range from a reuse of the ﬁery chariot of Elijah to ﬂying
machines with plane surfaces. By 1827, however, when
George Tucker wrote “A Voyage to the Moon,” knowl-
edge of extraterrestrial conditions had progressed to the
point at which writers began to realize that a trip through
space could not be accomplished in any type of open

had palatial accommodations—staterooms, kitchens, (gal-
leys) , lounges, and extensive cargo sections piled high
with boxes, barrels and crates o-f provisions.

The ﬁctional concept simmered down with the advance
of space science. Spacecraft became slimmer and trimmer,
with cramped quarters for the crew and the bulk of cargo
space devoted to fuel. Craft assumed the upright, rocket
conﬁguration currently in use for hurling spacecraft into
orbit, as planned for the Project Apollo, in which a vehicle

 is to blast off from the moon on a return trip to earth.
The trend is reﬂected in many science—ﬁction stories and

in motion pictures, as well. In “Destination Moon” (Geo-

rge Pal—UA, 1950) , the rocket ship is ﬁnanced by indus-

trialists; but in “Rocketship XM” (Lippert, 1950), the

same type vehicle is a government project, blasting off
from White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico.

Oddly enough, Writers of science-ﬁction seem to have
the tendency to sell technological advances short. Though
they are quite proliﬁc in dreaming up new and wonderful
inventions, they commit the chronological error of assum-
ing that they are further in advance of the times than
they really are.

Gernsback’s “Ralph 124C 41+,” 1912, includes tele-
vision, the Picture-Phone, conversation of solar energy
into electricalenergy, and the “Hypnobiosco-pe” (device
for transmitting recorded impressions direct to the brain
of a sleeping subject), all of which exist in fact today, yet
the author subtitled the story “A Romance of the Year
2660.” Olaf Stapledon’s “Last and First Men,” 1930, is
still more anachronous. Mankind discovers how to break
up the atom for power — in the year 104,000! Louis
Mercier wrote “Memoirs of the Year Two Thousand Five
Hundred” in 1771, including such innovations as a device
that “imitates all the articulations of the human voice,
the cries of animals, and the various notes of birds” (the
phonograph, and even motion pictures.)

Bellamy’s “Looking “Backward,” written in 1888, takes
place in the year 2,000, and Hudson’s “A Crystal Age” in
some far—distant time. Wells’ “A Story of the Days to
Come” and “When the Sleeper Wakes” (written in 1897
and 1899) both are projected 200 years in the future. All
four stories describe marvelous inventions, and all could
have been placed in times much closer to the present,
since the inventions they describe are actually in use
today.

“Into the 28th Century,” by Lilith Lorraine, 1930,
says: “ . . . leisurely moving bright-colored passenger
vehicles skimmed along, keeping a foot or so above the
pavement, as though held in that position by some
gravity-controlling device.” Such conveyances, called
“air-cushion” vehicles, already exist, sometimes referred
to as “cushioncraft,” “hovercraft,” or “ground-effect
machines.”

“Electronics,” as a word, has been in dictionaries less
than ten years, and did not appear in science-ﬁction much
before that time, either. Writers did use “electricity,”
sometimes called od (odic force), odyl, or vril, in many
of their wonderful inventions but were, unwittingly, using
electronics in many instances by ascribing to electricity
(the only term then available) qualities possible only
by electronic means.

For example, in Bulwer—Lytton’s “The Coming Race,”
1871, a highly civilized race, the V*rz'l—ya, use vril in every-
thing from tutomatons which do the work, to weather-
control and the transmission of thoughts. Ambrose Bierce
wrote “Moxon’s Master,” 1893, about an automaton
chessplayer that is so human it becomes enraged at a
checkm-ate and “kills its creator. In H. G. Wells’ “Time
Machine,” 1895, a device of this type must be electronic.
The X-ray device in Frank Stockton’s “The Great Stone
of Sardis,” 1897, sends its rays to any desired depth in
any substance and shows the surface at that depth. In

Ray Cummings’ “Man Who Mastered Time,” 1924, peo-
ple use an “electric paralyzer,” which would be electronic.

In “Skylark of Space,” 1928, an “electric” (electronic)
device teaches language by changing the convolutions of
the brain. Such a device must be electronic, as would
surely be “The Disintegration Machine,” Doyle, 1929,
and a machine that produces typescript from oral dicta-
tions in Von Hanstein’s “Utopia Island,” 1931.

It would appear that there are few subjects in science-
ﬁction that cannot become actu-alities. Fantastic as some
of the “wonderful inventions” seem, the progress ,of sci-
ence has a sometimes disconcerting way of rendering them
no more than educated prophecies. “F ar—fetched” ﬁctional
devices not yet overtaken by the advance of technology
include: “death-rays,” transplanting of living organs,
anti-gravity devices, and time-travel. Yet, certain rays
mentioned in many stories are no stranger than the
potentialities of the laser. And the transplanting of organs
from the dead to the living as practiced by Ras Thavas,
the “Master Mind of l\’Iars,” by Edgar Rice Burroughs,
1928-, is slowly being overtaken by modern surgery which
already has successfully transplanted corneas and kid-
neys, and which is performing experiments to greatly
enlarge its scope of marvels in this ﬁeld.

Many science-ﬁct-ion stories make use of anti-gravity
devices, beginning with “Gulliver’s Travels,” 1726, in
which the island of Laputa is held up by such (unex-
plained) force; in Percy Greg’s “Across the Zodiac,” 1880,
which uses an electric force called “apergy”; in Frank
Stockton’s “A Tale of Negative Gravity,” 1884, which
uses a machine to repulse gravity, or in H. G. Wells’
“First Men in the Moon,” 1895, which uses a chemical
called “Cavorite” for the purpose.

Even here, there are beginning to be faint stirrings in
science. According to a statement in the McGraw-Hill
“Encylopedia of Science,” 1960, Vol 6, page 266 (borne
out by SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, April, 1959, page 68) the
gravitational ﬁeld may be composed of individual quanta
of energy, made up of particles called gravitons, in ana-
logy with photons, which are quanta of radiant energy.
If this should be correct, since the photon may be con-
trolled, it is hoped that the graviton may also come under
control at some happy, future date.

About all that is left is time-travel. And as time itself
has been the factor that has brought about the realization
of so many wondrous ﬁctional inventions once considered
impossibilities, would it not be heretical to assume that
time could not bring about an ambulatory or locomotive
function in its own case? —J. Harris Gable

ONLY FORD-BUILT CARS MEET THE CHALLENGE WITH
TOTAL PERFORMANCE!

Something wonderful’s happened to Ford Motor
Company cars! Under the freshest styling seen in
years, there’s a new kind of durability and vigor that
more than meets the demands of today’s and tomor-
row’s high—speed turnpike driving conditions.

What’s the secret? Quality engineering for total per-
formance. Quality engineering so outstanding that
Ford Motor Company received the NASCAB Achieve-

ment Award for engineering excellence which “superbly
combines the prime essentials of great automobiles-
performance, reliability, durability, comfort and safety.”

Total performance makes a world of difference. Bodies
and frames are solid and quiet even on the roughest
roads. The ride’s so smooth, so even—keeled, it seems
to straighten the curves and shorten the miles. And
nothing matches the spirit, sparkle and stamina of
advanced Ford-built V-8’s and thrifty Sixes. Total
performance is yours to enjoy in all our 1964 cars——.from
the frisky Falcon to the matchless Lincoln Continental.

Westinghouse has developed a computer-
controlled system for doing almost every-
thing on a cargo ship faster and better.

It can be made to load and unload cargo
faster. Control speed directly from the
bridge with no help from below. Keep the

ship on course. Steer clear of navigational
hazards. Navigate so accurately it saves
fuel. Keep an eye on all dials and gauges.
Control valves in the engine room. Keep
records of operations. Analyze emergency
situations and take corrective action. Even
check on how the cargo is doing.

In this day of low-priced competition
from ships under foreign ﬂags, this de-
velopment can add new strength to our

Tom Huck sought scientific excitement

Ohio University conferred a B.S.E.E. degree on C. T.
Huck in 1956. Tom knew of Western Electric’s history
of manufacturing development. He realized, too, that
our personnel development program was expanding
to meet tomorrow’s demands.

After graduation, Tom immediately began to work
on the development of electronic switching systems.
Then, in 1958, Tom went to the Bell Telephone Lab-
oratories on a temporary assignment to help in the
advancement of our national military capabilities. At
their Whippany, New Jersey, labs, Tom worked with
the Western Electric development team on computer
circuitry for the Nike Zeus guidance system. Tom then
moved on to a new assignment at WE’s Columbus,
Ohio, Works. There, Tom is working on the develop-
ment of testing circuitry for the memory phase of elec-
tronic switching systems.

Is it true that the leaig prducer o oxygn

or steelmaking had a hand in preparing
Tricia l\/lcDonald’s orange iuice3

You'd expect that a company with 50 years’ experience in ex-
tracting oxygen from the air would lead the field. You might
even assume—and you'd be right—that it knows a lot about
how oxygen can speed the making of steel. As a result, the
company sells oxygen by the ton to steelmakers to help them
produce faster and more efficiently.

You’d also expect that a leader in cryogenics, the science
of supercold, would develop an improved process for mak-
ing the frozen orange iuice concentrate that starts Tricia
McDonald off to a bright, good morning.

But there might be some doubt that two such
activities as helping to speed steel production and
helping to improve frozen orange juice could come
from one company. Unless you knew Union Carbide.

UNION
CARBIDE

For Union Carbide is also one of the world's largest pro-
ducers of petrochemicals. As a leader in carbon products, it
is developing revolutionary graphite molds for the continu-
ous casting of steel. It is the largest producer of polyeth-
ylene, and makes plastics for packaging, housewares, and
floor coverings. Among its consumer products is “Prestone"
brand anti—freeze, world’s largest selling brand. And it is
one of the world's most diversified private enterprises in the
field of atomic energy.

In fact, few other corporations are so deeply involved in so
many different skills and activities that will affect the
technical and production capabilities of our next
century.

I L. D. Shotts, BSME Univer-
sity of Illinois, 1963, inspects
wear patterns on a herringbone
gear after dynamometer test-
ing. This gear is part of a new
reduction gear assembly being
developed for advanced ver-
sions of the Allison T56 turbo-

prop.

  

OPPORTUNITY A
IS YOURS 
AT ALLISON  

I For L. D. Shotts, the move from the University of
Illinois was a natural. L. D. had learned of the work
Allison is doing in advanced turbine engine develop-
ment. Particularly, he was impressed with Allison’s as-
signment to develop the T78 regenerative turboprop
engine.

The T78—selected by the Navy for anti-submarine
aircraft—utilizes turbine exhaust heat to raise the tem-
perature of compressor discharge air, resulting in in-
creased fuel economy for extended long-range and on
station aircraft capability.

Air-cooled turbine blades, another Allison achieve-
ment, mark a signiﬁcant advance in turbine engine
state of the art. And, the workhorse of turboprops, the
Allison T56, continues to set new standards as our

engineers ﬁnd additional means of improving perform-
ance and reliability.

In addition to leadership in the turboprop area,
Allison also is making great strides in the development
of nuclear energy conversion projects, including a com-
pact, mobile nuclear reactor and an energy depot con-
cept which will permit manufacturing of fuel “on the
spot” for military ﬁeld units.

Well-qualiﬁed, young engineers will ﬁnd unlimited
opportunities in the long—range, diversiﬁed energy con-
version programs at Allison. Talk to our representative
when he visits your campus. Let him tell you what it’s
like in the creative environment at Allison where En-
ergy Conversion Is Our Business.

There’s an exciting challenge ahead for yoly

   

. ‘ ' K. M. Nelson, Manager-

Industrial Control Sales, discusses the functioning of
Cutler-Hammer’s automation teams, and how

creative graduates contribute to pioneering developments.

30

or over sixty years Cutler-

Hammer has been a key con-
tributor in planning automatic
systems—now called automation.

To meet the pressing challenge of
rapidly expanding industrial auto-
mation, we have formed a number of
automation project teams. These
teams combine the technical and
manufacturing talents of versatile,
seasoned specialists and young, crea-
tive-minded engineering and business
administration graduates.

Their primary job: to make sure that
a customer’s automation investment
pays an adequate return.

How do they meet this challenge?
By working with customer engineers
and consultants to isolate cost prob-
lems in manufacturing and ware-
housing operations. Then, by apply-
ing their individual disciplines and
creative ingenuity to build common-

sense automation proposals that can
be justiﬁed economically.

Automation teams work together in
a modern 500,000 square foot plant
speciﬁcally designed to house every
activity involved in the evolution of
a system . . . in a creative climate
that is conducive to imaginative
planning and development.

This approach has paid off! Though
industry has barely scratched the sur-
face of the automation potential, our
credentials already are quite impres-
sive. Jobs such as the U.S. Post Office
mail handling systems in 14 major
cities; a pallet handling system for a
mail-order ﬁrm; data accumulation
systems for large steel producers; a
number of automobile body-line
systems; bundle-handling systems for
30 major newspaper mail rooms; and
a package-handling system for a
prominent publisher are just a few

examples of our automation planning
skill at work.

What are the advantages to the
young, creative-minded graduate?
Short range, it’s an exceptional op-
portunity for the man who responds
to the challenge of ﬁnding new solu-
tions to tough manufacturing prob-
lems. Long range, being a key
member of a Cutler-Hammer auto-
mation team is an excellent way to
get the diversified experience so
essential to steady career develop-
ment and future advancement.

what’s newl

Solid state, semiconductor load cells have been developed by F-airchild
controls for use in the Sikorsky S-64: Skycrane helicopter. The new system is
used for measuring and monitoring engine torque and cargo loading.

The load cells, three of them in all, are located at different points on the
helicopter. One each is mounted directly on each of the two Pratt & VVhitney
turboshaft engines and the other is mounted directly under the winch of the
hoist mechanism. From these devices, continuous reading are transmitted to
both the pilot, copilot, and the winch operator by direct reading meters in their
respective compartments. Through these readings, the pilot is more able to
control the torque necessary for lifting operation and the balancing of the output
of each engine during flight.

The system being used is the 3S—G load cell system. The system senses the
load and indicates torque generated by the engine. The output of each cell is
amplified with a model 991835 Remote Amplifier and fed into the three separate ""
dual meters. The load cells for the helicopter turbosh-aft engines have special
ranges of 04,380 pounds.

Bell Telephone Laboratories have developed a new member of the
iron—cobalt-Vanadium family. The new alloy, called Rememdur because it
is capable of very high values of remanence of up to 21,500 gauss, has the
highest residual induction of any permanent magnet material, yet so malleable
and ductile that it can be rolled into the thickness of a human hair.

Remendur has a unique combination of mechanical and magnetic pro-
perties: a square hysteresis loop for efficient switching operation, a temperature-
stable coercive force of the value desired in the range of 20 to 60 oersteds
essentially isotropic or nondirectional magnetic properties, and a high curie
temperature. Mechanically, the alloy —— though quite hard —— has sufficient
malleability and ductility to permit it to be processed into thin foils, fine wires,
and narrow ribbons. It has a high elastic modulus, an expansion coeflicient to
A match glass, can be readily electroplated, and responds to a simple heat
-“~- treatment.

\\ Remendur’s high residual induction makes possible the use in the ferred
\ of permanent magnets with extra ordinarily small cross—sections. Because of
~ 3"‘ these characteristics, a single pound of Remendur will yield more than 2000
V5! ferreed switch magnets.
W‘: Ever wish you could put a pot on the stove and let
‘A it alone without it boiling over? Well, the answer may be
 found in General Electric’s new Silicone Antifoam.

Although silicone antifoams aren’t new, the new pro-
T.‘ duct of General Electric is sanctioned by the Food and
Drug Administration for use as direct food additives.

 ' One of the main benefits of silicones is their effective-
l.e‘» ness generally in small volume. Some of the new silicone

The new POST ullersatrig provides a faster means of calculation for industrial

technicians, technical students and scientiﬁc specialists.

An all-new slide rule for technicians. . . the

POST VERSATRIG

Here’s a brand new slide rule from
POST that has been specially de-
signed to speed all calculations of a
general or technical nature. Multi-
plication and division are quick and
easy. So are all trigonometric calcu-
lations. The determination of
squares, cubes, roots and logarithms
is more accurate.

Logical scale arrangement

The new POST Versatrig is func-
tional, scales which are most often
used together are grouped together.
Scales include C, D, CI, CF, DF,
CIF, DI, R1, R2, K, A, L, Cos S,
Sec T, ST and T. The R; and R2
scales are a POST exclusive for this
type of rule. For added convenience,
the C and D scales appear on both
sides of the Versatrig.

Easy to read
Numbers- are easy to locate and

‘read accurately. Scales are engine-

divided with permanent graduations
cut into the white plastic faces.
Reading the answer is easy, too.
Scales feature consistent color cod-
ing, and the clear glass indicator has
a sharp red hairline. Finding an-
swers is easier and calculations are

more accurate with a Versatrig. Trig
scales add an extra dimension to the
problem-solving capacity of Versa-
trig, and to the speed with which
you can complete calculations.

Trouble-free operation

Like the other ﬁne POST slide rules,
every new Versatrig has a smooth-
acting, easy-to-set slide. Although
the natural, self-lubricating qualities
of bamboo improve with age, slide
tension is adjustable to individual
preference. POST laminated bamboo
construction is virtually unaifected
by moisture or temperature changes,
is resistant to sticking or swelling.
Versatrig stays as accurate as the
day you bought it.

A young man came into a barber shop and said
that he wanted a haircut that was different. They dis-
cussed a few styles, but none of them agreed with the
young man. Finally the barber hit upon an idea. He
decided to part the young man’s- hair from ear to ear,
combing the front half frontward, and the back half,
back. When he had finished, the young man paid him
and strode out of the barber shop, extremely pleased that
he had a haircut that was different.

About two days later the young man came back
into the shop and said "Liut this mess off and fix it like
everybody else’s.” The barber asked him, “Why? Is
everyone making fun of you? “No,” he said, “but 1 sure
am tired of people whispering into my nose.”

The druggist paused and then answered, “Listen to

started to shave, but couldn’t ﬁnd a new blade. While I
was pulling out my whiskers with the dull blade, the
coffee boiled all over the stove. I went to drink the

changed my suit and got into the car to drive to town.
Couldn’t start the fool thing but finally managed to hitch
a ride. When I got here, the phone was ringing off the
wall. I went to unlock the door and found m_v.keys were

WE MAKE INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERS SWEAT

Might as Well scare Off the ones who wouldn’t like it.
Some of the unscared will in a few years be referred to as
“they” when people say, “At Eastman Kodak, they can
afford to do it this way——”

The reason we can afford to do things the best way is
that we are successful. The success can be attributed in part
to a fear worth fearing: of failing to deliver the best possible
performance that the customer's hard-won dollar can buy.

Sheer devotion on the part of the work force, though
beautiful to see, will not of itself deliver the goods. Some-
body must ﬁrst come up with a sensible answer to the
question, “Exactly what is it you want me to do, mister?”

Thus a young industrial engineer may ﬁnd himself acting

An interview with W. Scott Hill, Manager——-Engineering Recruiting, General Electric Co.

Define Your Career Objectives!

 

Vll. Scoff Hill

Q. Mr..Hill, when is the best time to

begin making decisions on my career '

objectives?

A. When you selected a technical
discipline, you made one of your
important career decisions. This de-
fined the general area in which you
will probably begin your professional
work, whether in a job or through
further study at the graduate level.

Q. Can you suggest some factors that
might influence my career choice?

A. By the time you have reached
your senior year in college, you know
certain things about yourself that
are going to be important. If you
have a strong technical orientation
and like problem solving, there are
many good engineering career
choices in all functions of industry:
design and development; manufac-
turing and technical marketing. If
you enjoy exploring theoretical con-
cepts, perhaps research—on one of
the many levels to be found in in-
dustry—is a career choice to con-
sider. And don’t think any one area

offers a great deal more opportunity
for your talent than another. They all
need top creative engineering skill
and the ability to deal successfully
with people.

Q. After I've evaluated my own abil-
ities, how do I judge realistically
what I can do with them?

A. l’m sure you're already getting
all the information you can on ca-
reer fields related to your discipline.
Don't overlook your family, friends
and acquaintances, especially re-
cent graduates, as sources of informa-

. tion. Have you made full use of your

faculty and placement office for
advice? Information is available in
the technical journals and society
publications. Read them to see what
firms are" contributing to advance-
ment in your field, and how. Review
the files in your placement office
for company literature. This can tell
you a great deal about openings and
programs, career areas and company
organization.

Q. can you suggest what criteria I
can apply in relating this information
to my own career prospects?

A. In appraising opportunities, apply
criteria important to you. Is location
important? What level of income

would you like to attain? What is the
scope of opportunity of the firm
you’|| select? Should you trade off
starting salary against long-term
potential? These are things you must
decide for yourself.

Q. Can companies like General Elec-
tric assure me of a correct career
choice?

A. It costs industry a great deal of
money to hire a young engineer and
start him on a career path. So, very
selfishly, we’ll be doing everything
possible to be sure at the beginning
that the choice is right for you. But
a bad mistake can cost you even
more in lost time and income. Gen-
eral E|ectric’s concept of Person-
alized Career Planning is to recog-
nize that your decisions will be
largely determined by your individ-
ual abilities, inclinations, and am-
bitions. This Company's unusual di-

If you are, there’s a place for you on the Aerospace
Team—the U. 8. Air Force.

No organization in the world gives young people a
greater opportunity to do vital, responsible work.

For example, just a short while ago a 23-year-old Air
Force lieutenant made a startling breakthrough in
metallurgy. And a recent A|l—America tackle is doing ad-
vanced research in nuclear weapons.
If you have talent, you'll have a chance

In the current idiom, the “gap” between science-
ﬁction and today’s science and technology is all
: but closed. The sophisticated scientist himself must sometimes fail

i to éliseern where so-called ﬁetion merges with fact.

If science—ﬁction now is perhaps not as popular as it
was a decade or so ago, this is only because the daily
chronicle of scientiﬁc progress is so fantastic that it reads
like science—ﬁction itself. And so the gap shortens . . .
until transition from unreality to reality has become
nearly imperceptible. Because the evolution has been
so subtle (yet so swiftlyl), it is more than a signiﬁcant
milestone.

A science—ﬁction story, then, “is a narrative of an
imaginary invention or discovery in the natural sciences.
The invention must be imaginary . . . (and) some stories
are primarily concerned with a wonderful invention and
its use.”* Stories of this type make up a great ﬁeld of
literature, well-known to its followers, little-known to
others; but one for which neither its extent nor its impact
should be underestimated.

In extent, entire periodicals are devoted to science-
ﬁction: at least six in the United States (AMAZING
STORIES was the ﬁrst, 1926), three in England, two in
France, three in Germany, two in Italy, two in Argentina,
and many others. Magazines of the standing of THE
SATURDAY EVENING POST published it; there have been
scores of motion pictures, hundreds of comic books, and
many comic strips, such as “Buck Rogers.” In the area
of pocket (paperback) books, more than 100 are published
in the United States each year.

In addition to the writers known exclusively in this
ﬁeld, many famous persons have contributed to the litera-
ture: John Jacob Astor, Sir Francis Bacon, Honore de
Balzac, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Aldous Huxley, Rudyard
Kipling, Jack London, Bulwer-Lytton, Guy de Maupas~
sant, Sir Thomas More, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley
(sister of the poet—“Frankenstein,” 1817) , Robert Louis
Stevenson, Jonathan Swift, Voltaire, H. G. Wells, to name
some of the more noted.

But is is particularly the impact of science—ﬁction with
which we should be concerned, for the science—ﬁction of
yesterday has an uncanny way of becoming the reality of
today. There is scarcely any “wonderful invention” —
from airplane to zeppelin—that did not appear ﬁrst in
science—ﬁction.

Sir Francis Bacon may or may not have written Shake-
speare’s plays, but he did write science-ﬁction late in his
career. His “New Altantis” (1627), was one of the ﬁrst
books of this type seriously to discuss scientiﬁc affairs and
progress, and was far in advance of the science—ﬁction ﬁeld
in general, to such extent that the book helped inspire
founding of the Royal Society—even guiding its early
researches. The people of “New Altantis” had airplanes,
submarines, and “trunks and pipes” for carrying sound
over great distances; also, science and invention were the
business of the state.

Bacon predicted the telephone some 250 years before
Alexander Graham Bell’s patent. Later science—ﬁction
writers followed suit. In 1894, John Jacob Astor’s “A
Journey in Other Worlds” describes telephone wires that
carry not only one’s voice, but an image of the speaker’s

face as well! This closed—circuit TV usage, available today
as the Picture—Phone, was also included in Hugo Gerns-
back’s “Ralph 124 C41-l-,” which first appeared as a serial
in Gernsback’s first magazine, MODERN ELECTRONICS, in
1911—and later in complete form in AMAZING STORIES
QUARTERLY, Vol. 2, N o. 1, January 1929, where it is called
the “telephot.” Paralleling all modern—day use of the
telephone, Ralph, in trying to ’phone a colleague, gets the
wrong number, and is astonished to see the visage of a
