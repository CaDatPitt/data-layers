James R. Bachman, class of '51,

speaks from experience when he says . . .

“I find the Applied Research Laboratory
of U. S. Steel an interesting and
rewarding place in which to Work.”

The rapid rise of Mr. Bachman at
United States Steel’s Applied Re-
search Laboratory in Monroeville,
Pa., is typical of that of many scien-
tists and engineers who have come to
U. S. Steel from college "and who
have staked their future with this
organization.

Mr. Bachman received his B.S.
Degree in 1951 and his" M. S. Degree
in 1952. Both of these degrees were
in Ceramic Engineering. While at
college, he served as a Research As-
sistant on a commercial research
refractories problem.

In June, 1952, Mr. Bachman was
employed in the Refractories Divi-
sion of the Applied Research Labora-
tory as Assistant Technologist. Dur-
ing his four years of employment, he
has received two promotions. Today,
he is the Supervising Technologist,

Refractories Division, at this labora-
tory.

Mr. Bachman has said: “At U. S.
Steel’s Applied Research Labora-
tory, we are actively solving prob-
lems that are of vital importance to
the steel industry. These problems
are many and varied, including as
they do activities in the ﬁelds of
physics, chemistry, mathematics,
and electrical, mechanical and met-
allurgical engineering.”

Today, more than ever before, the
young man graduating from college
will ﬁnd every opportunity for rapid
growth opened to him at U. S. Steel
—whether in research or in hundreds

of other engrossing operations which
make up the daily work of this con-
stantly expanding industry. If you
are interested in a challenging and
rewarding career with United States
Steel and feel that you can qualify,
why not get in touch with your col-
lege placement director for further

COVER

The theme of this issue of the
SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER is “The
Role of Research in Modern Engin-
eering.” On the cover, we attempt
graphically to portray a summary of
the contents of this issue. It was de-
signed by Bill Snodgrass, '57 and
Mitch Kozikowski, '57.

FRONTISPIECE

The frontispiece shows a scientist
illustrating with soap bubbles how
atoms group themselves into orderly
arrangements, or “crystal structures.”
Because soap bubbles have a tendency
to join balance in much the-same way
as atoms do, this “bubble” technique
duplicates actual atomic crystal struc-
tures. With the s'oap bubble technique
research scientists can “see” and in-
vestigate on a vastly larger scale the
patterns, and detect structures formed
by atoms in nature. In an actual
crystal structure, the space between
each atom would be six million times
smaller than those shown» between
the soap bubbles.

creative research

the EDITORIAL

Research engineers are in somewhat the same posi-
tion as an explorer with an inﬁnite territory to investi-
gate. To such an explorer, each mountain scaled, each
plain crossed, and each ocean spanned reveals a whole
new land. Each step he takes adds to his ‘knowledge of
the terrain——but the paths ahead remain numerous.
Thus it is ‘with the research engineer, whose every dis-
covery adds to his store of knowledge, but where the
areas yet to be investigated frequently seem endless.
Unlike the explorers of the earth’s surface, whose hori-
zons are shrinking, the research engineer seems to have
no boundaries.

But new knowledge alone .will not produce the
miracles forseen for the future. That knowledge must
be applied, and it must be applied with originality, in-
genuity, and skill comparable to the creative effort that
produced it. In short, creative research must put the
knowledge to practical use.

Researc'h is highly‘creative. From its laboratories
come new products, in turn creating new jobs and fre-
quently laying the foundation for entirely new indus-
tries. It makes a large and fundamental contribution to
the nation’s economic growth. Creative research pro-
vides the facts upon which changes to improve process-
es and products are based.

The increasing trend toward automation, for ex-
ample, brings‘ with it the absolute necessity for creative
research. For automation is not merely a matter of con-

IANUI-XRY1957

necting an automatic control to a group of machines
and expecting the system to perform efficiently and
economically. Each task to which automation is ap-
plied must be individually considered in all its -many
technical aspects. New circuit elements and new cir-
cuits will be needed in abundance. New concepts will
be even more important. The necessity for creative re--
search in this one field alone is almost limitless.
Without highly ingenious laboratory tools and "in-
struments the research engineer would ﬁnd the search
for new knowledge to be impossible. Intricate and ex-
pensive, these research tools reveal facts and pheno-
mena ordinarily hidden from the human senses. Parti-
cles so small that it would take a hundred thousand
to cover a pinhead becomes visible under an electron
microscope. A scratch a millionth of an. inch deep be-
comes a deep V with a micro-iinterferometer. Tools
like these enable the research engineer to be creative.
America’s economic progress will depend in large
-measure on developments in the research laboratory.
Advances in living standards will come about, as they
have in the past, through new products, new methods,
and new opportunities-. Lower costs and improved per-
formance, achieved through creative research, are the
parents of the American high standard of living. Every
improvement contributing to the comfort, ease, and
convenience of daily life has its origin in invention and
development. There is no alternative course. JMA

The first step in any research is a concise statement

of the problem. This is sometimes the most difficu»l't and .

time-consumin-g part o-f the research because the true
problem is often obscured -by unrelated but seemingly
important trivia.

The second step is to make an exhaustive search of
all previous literature on the subject. This is where many
engineers fail completely in research. T-hey are impatient
to get on with laboratory tests under the assumption
that previous investigations were no good‘ or the prob-
lem would already have been solved. There is nothing
more sobering to the ego than a good literature review.
It will generally be ‘found that much good work has al-
ready been done.

Most striking of all, however, is the fact that few
engineers know about Chemical Abstracts. Mechanical,
electrical, an-d other engineers have as much to gain
from the use of these volumes as do chemists and
chemical engineers, Any subject such as transistor cir-
cuits or jet engine design may be selected; dozens, even
hundreds of references may be found in Chemical Ab-
stracts. There are the most valuable book-s in any re-
search laboratory and are found in every technology
library in the country. -Each en-gineer should acquaint
himself with their use. The sooner—the better. I

The increased emphasis on industrial
research in this country engenders some
important questions. Just what is the role
of research in modern engineering? What
are its aims, and how are they accom-
plished? Here are some answers, exerpts
from an article by Dr. Clarence Zener,
Acting Director of the Westinghouse Re-
search Laboratories.

The Role of Research in Modern Engineering

IANUARY

1957

Research has an important role in the progress of
American industry. The reasons for this are ma-ny. For
one thin-g the whole ‘tempo of technical development
in t-his country has been quickenin-g. Research must
keep abreast or' preferably a step or two ahead. Major
“-break-throughs” are needed in several research areas.
From purely economic standpoint, no major company
can afford not to do research, ‘both applied and funda-
mental, if only for the reason that any major break-
through by a competitor might -have disastrous and
long-lasting effects.

What Is Industrial Research?

One means of deﬁning research in contrast to de-
velopment is to pinpoint its role in technological ad-
vances. Each product-man-ufacturing division of some
large companies not only have a development group
that works on short-range improvements but also an
adva-nced development group who concentrate their
efforts on product designs of a long range nature. These
engineers can certainly be relied upon to improve cur-
rent products .and develop new ones. Every year hun-
dreds of graduates enter these divisions, bringing with
them fresh ideas and viewpoints from schools scattered
all over the country. Also, other engineering depart-
ments contribute to the flow of new ideas and pro-
ducts.

Manufacturing groups of large industrial concerns
have many problems in common. ‘In an electrical manu-
facturing company, for example, many products would
beneﬁt from an insulating ‘wire enamel that enabled
higher temperature operation of a motor or transform-
er. Several separate efforts to develop such an insulation
would be h-ighly i-neﬂiic-ient. Rather, the interest-s are
pooled in a research group who specialize in the in-
sulation field. Frequently, a basic interpretation devel-
oped by this group is adaptable to a wide variety of

13

applications, sometimes with no modiﬁcation, some-
times with minor alterations of its constituents or
methods of -preparation. This research group, can then
explore the entire ﬁeld of insulation, and delve into
its ‘fundamentals; the odds are more favorable for
major improvements in insulation than they would
be for a group -whose limits were more conﬁning.

Again, many ﬁelds are plagued by unwanted vibra-
tion. At some research laboratories a team of scientists
and engineers devote themselves exclusive-ly to a study
of the origin of vibration -and methods of alleviation.
Because of their lon-g and intensive training in this
specialized ﬁeld, they are more effective in eliminating
vibration trouble.

-Such examples could be multiplied manyfold.
Whereas engineers concerned with a particular product
are specialists in their product, the scientists at research
l.aboratories are specialized in. the various disciples of
engineering and science. In essence, the various develop-
ment laboratories work on problems where the basic
principles are well established; research laboratories,
on the other hand, attack problems where the basic
principles have yet to be discovered.

The Research Scientist

Another way of deﬁning industrial research is to
take a look at the people who are involved—_the re-
search scientists and engineers. T-heir interests and per-
sonal characteristics have much to do with the organi-
zation and function of any research laboratory.

What kind ‘of a man is this research scientist? His

in diameter, and invisible in this picture, the beam of this
quartz-bar microbalance is capable of'measurcmcnts as
small as one-hundredth-millionth of an ounce.

distinguishing characteristic is a consuming curiosity

about this field of speciality, and the things that sur-

round ‘him. Most engineers have similar tendencies. A

ﬂicker of a television screen that is an annoyance to

the non-technical viewer may cause the electrical en-

gineer to try to “remedy the situation. The research
man differs only in the nature and extent of l'l'lS
curiosity. The research scientist is apt to probe deeper
for the fundamental reasons of a television set’s behav-
ior.

A second essential ingredient of ‘the research scient-
ist is his unfounded fait-h in man’s ability to guide na-
ture’s forces to serve his own will, and a desire to be
a part of the history of ‘man’s efforts in this direction.
His neighbor h-as never tasted t-he pleasure of creative
work, of delving into areas that no -man has ever ex-
plored before, or of having thoughts never conceived
-before by others. In one sense this is the spirit of the
explorer combined with that of the great painter or
composer.

The increasing complexity of modern science and
technology also means that the depth and breadth of
the individual scientist’s knowledge must be greater.
This has mean-t that an increasing number of the men
joining research have already acquired doctor’s degrees.

Although no group of people can. be said to have a
common exclusive trait, the research man is nearly al-
ways a strong individualist and likes to work unfetter-
ed by seemingly unnecessary restrictions. This plus
other characteristics leads to the conclusion that the

ation laboratory at Esso Research Center, Linden, New
Jersey.

environment of a research laboratory must be differ-
ent from that found elsewhere in industry. In add-ition
to the necessity of having modern equipment and a good
research library, the scientist must be burdened with
as few limitations and restrictions as possible in the at-
tainment of his goal. Factors that do not directly affect
his project or area of research such as admin-istrative
or organizational problems must be kept to a minimum.
At the same time, however, the scientist cannot be
isolated from the potenti-al end results of his research
—the application of the new knowledge he will u-ncovcr.
Research must have a direction, whether "general or
speciﬁc, and in an industrial research organization this
is best accomplished by contact between research and
engineering groups, so that each group is fully aware
of the other’s and understands them
thoroughly.
What Type Of Research Is Pursued?

The rapid expansion of science has been outpaced
=by an even more rapid expansion of technology. As
a consequence, the time interval between a scientiﬁc
discovery and its technological application has been
shortening over the past few decades. To be speciﬁc,
one large area of research -has been in the location of
the extremes; research at the -lowest tempera-tures near
absolute zero and. at the highest pressures. An increas-
ingly great percentage of research today is “blue sky”
research effort directed towards no particular develop-
ment.

A close understanding of long-ra-nge aims of manu-
facturing divisions is essential to an industrial research
organization. Thus special effort is--made to gain this
understanding. Periodic -meetings are held between
research scientists and product engineers. In some ﬁelds,
standing committees. are formed which meet periodi-
cally. At these meetings -research scientists become
aware of the trends in equipment and just what advanc-
es will be needed to keep pace with competition.

How Are Laboratories Organized?

In modern research, an increasingly important tech-
nique is the team approach. Many projects today re-
quire more, than a one man approach, regardless of
his ability. An investigation in the ﬁeld -of semiconduc-
tors,for example, may well require t-he services of a
p-hyscist, a physical -chemist, a metallurgist, and special-
ists in such t'hings as x--ray crystallography -and spectro-
scopy. Such teams may be loose, temporary associa-
tions, or in some cases, a long term group, but the
team approach may be "with us inde-ﬁnitely.

The results of research are in various forms. In
a few cases, the end result of research is a direct pro-

problems

duct. In such cases the new product is transferred to
a department whose task is to engineer the product to
a manufacturing stage. More frequently, however, the
results are the form of new information, or new mater-

ials, or products in the “test tube” stage.

Several thi-ngs are evident about industrial research.
It cannot afford to leave fundamental research to
others; thus, a large part of research laboratories is
devoted to fundamental study. Conversely, however, it
must keep an eye on engineering progress and make
certain that it is applying sufficient effort to those
areas where major scientiﬁc breakthroughs -are needed.
And last, it must be capable of supplyi-ng an additional
helping -hand in difficult development problems. The
net result is a well balanced team, capable of spear-
heading scientiﬁc advance in nearly any direc-tion. I

The Synchrotron

The Synchrotron is a device in which electrons or
protons are ﬁrst accelerated by th-e Betatron principle
to a high velocity. They are then injected into a Cyclo-
tron and acquire further kinetic energy. In practice,
the same acceleration chamber may be used for both
processes. The Betatron phase of the operation accele-
rates the particles to approximately ﬁfty-million elec-
tron volts or to within about thirty per cent of the
velocity of light._A further increase in speed does not
materially increase the period of rotation; therefore,
the cyclotron phase of the -operation can be tuned. A
ten-billion electron volt Synchrotron is being planned
at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

With the knowledge gained from studies of the
atomic nucleus by use of the aforementioned particle
accelerators, work is being done on practical applica-
tions of atomic energy.

Radioactive Isotopes As Tracers

One of the widest applications of atomic energy is
in t-he ﬁeld of rad-ioactivity, especially radioactive iso-
topes. Radioactive isotopes are special varieties of nor-
mally non-radioactive su‘bsta:n»ces, which can be produc-
ed by placing material in a nuclear reactor and bom-
barding it with neutrons.

Flow problems of many -kinds are yielding to studies
-made with radioactive tracers. In engine test laborator-
ies, the amount of wear from moving parts, such as

ation source isgin the form of a 13-inch cobalt metal pipe.

piston rings, is now determined in a small fraction of
the time for-imerly required.

In medical research the radioactive isotopes of
many elements are used to study the use the human
body makes -of these elements.

By following the path of the tracer element with
radiation detection devices the medical researcher can
discover not only where the element is ﬁn-ally utilized
but also the "exact percentage, the time required, and the
path taken. .

The vast possibilities i-n this ﬁeld. have only been
tapped. Yet today so much more is known than five
years ago about the functions of animal organs under
normal and diseased conditions.

Cancer Treatment With Radioactive Isotopes

Treatment of cancerous tissues with radiation from
an external source has long been a standard method.
It is seriously limited because the effects of external ir-
radiation are widespread and may extend to every cell
in the body. But treatment -by internal irradiation is
apt to be conﬁned to speciﬁc tissues or organs, depend-
ing on the metabolism of the particular radioactive sub-

_ stance concerned. Can-cerous tissues have a higher rate
of metabolism than the surrounding healthy tissue,
therefore, this method seems well adapted for cancer
treatment. Continuing research in this ﬁeld is necessary
to determine which elements are used by each organ of
the body. Treatment of a speciﬁc organ could be ob-

17

tained by initnoducing into the body a radioactive iso-
tope of an element which would incorporate itself into
the cancerous growth.

Radioactivity is being utilized in many aspects other
than in the direct use of radioactive isotopes. Many
privately ﬁnanced research institutions are studying
the effects of radiation upon chemical reactions and
also are searching for improved prod-ucts produced by
such radiation.

Technicians here are placing a radioactive piston ring
on a piston of a one-cylinder Lauson test engiine. Two
months at the Oak Ridge atomic pile made the piston ring
radioactive. The engine wear is measured by the amount of
radioactive material found in the engine oil.

18

Radioactive materials for these -studies are prepared
in government operated atomic reactors. An example
of these radioactive material-s is the cobalt metal pipe
in use at t=he Esso Research Center in New Jersey. The
pipe has been -bombarded in the atomic reactor at
Brookhaven National Laboratories, Upton, Long Is-
land, N. Y., for more than 21/2 years. The result is a
radioactive -strength of about 3,500 curies. (The total
world supply. of reﬁned radium, a naturally radioactive
element, represents an estimated 2,400 curies). The
cobalt metal emits -powerful gamma rays. Scientists are
sear-ching for ways _to put these gamma rays to work
in the petroleum. industry.

Esso Research and Engineering Company has for
some months been experimenting with the effect‘ of‘
atomic radiation on petroleum, chemicals and other
materials at its new ‘laboratory completed last year for
that purpose. Already there are indications that radia-
tion of certain materials might produce an additive that
will ma-ke an im-proved lubricatin-g oil to give better
automobile performance.

In tests it was found gasoline could be produced
by using radiation -under -conditions which would not
permit gasoline production by other processes. Radia-
tion activates -certain types of reactions in the reﬁnery
process, and makes them go faster and in -a different
direction.

Esso scientists’ general goal is to learn how gamma
rays can make certain chemical reactions—essential
in modern oil reﬁning—take place faster and more
efficiently. Possibly, radiation can simplify operations,
cut production -costs and perhaps lead to new and bet-
ter products.

At a demonstration in the radiation laboratory a
liquid chemical, methyl methacrylate, was transformed
by radiation into the same type of solid plastic nor-
ma'ljl'y made by conventional chemical processes as a
substitute for glass.

Thus we can see that although atomic research is
in itsinfancy, its beneﬁts for mankind have been many.
The future prospects for atomic energy are so vast that
onlyvthis statement by  Robert Oppenheimer seems
appropriate, “When the ‘time is run, and that future
has become history, it will be clear how little of it we
today foresaw or could foresee”. I

NUCLEAR REACTORS

Nuclear research, formerly monopol-
ized by strict security regulations, is now
being performed by private industry. This
article describes the first of the nuclear
reactors for private industrial research.

FOR INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH

   
 

Richard Bott, a junior in the Petroleum Engineer-
ing Department, is the present Story Editor of the
SK YSCRAPER ENGINEER. Dick was graduated from
New Kensington High School in 1954. He spent last
summer working in New Mexico for Magnolia Petroleum
Company as part of the training required by the Petro-
leum "Engineering Department. Besides. having worked
on the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER for three years,
he is a member of Men's Council and Sigma Gamma
Epsilon, honorary earth and science fraternity.

The first nuclear reactor ‘for private industrial re-
search has gone into operation. Completed on May 17,
1956, at _the Illinois Institute of Technology, the re-

the private ﬁrms that sponsored it.

Without the former security regulations, reactors of
this type can advance nuclear science with the “ima-
ginative experimentation” of private industry.

Besides experimentation, reactors have t-he utility
function of -producing -ra-dioactive products already
perfected. Radioisotopes are the most useful of these.
The half-life of most neutron-induced. radioisotopes is
less than one day, a fact that confines their uses to
areas near a production source. The radiation given
off by radioisotopes can be traced through processes
occuring in mac-hines, pla-nts, -and animals. Thus a

radioactive part placed in an engine can give the dis-
placement of worn -material from that part.

The reactors now available for private industries
are of the “solution type” fission reactors. They utilize
the atomic break down of a solution of uran-yl sul-ph-ate
to supply t-he radiation. This break down takes place
in the core assembly where the fuel is contained.

The core is a stainless-steel spherical tank contain-
ing four control-rod t'h-im'bles which project vertically
into it, central exposure tubes extending horizontally
through its center, a gas outlet tube, cooling coils, and
the fuel line.

The fuel supply is contained in a storage tank loca-
ted in the subpile room which is below the reactor. The
fuel is piped from this tank to the core.

Also located in the subpipe room is the gas recom-
biner assembly. The gases generated in the core are
fed to this assembly by the gas_0utlet line. Here the
hydrogen and oxygen which were -produced by radio-
lysis of the water in the fuel solution are recombined
and returned -as water to the core tank. The radioactive
‘fission-product gases are conﬁned in the recombiner as
a source of gamma radiation.

Operating at 50 kilowatts, these reactors are capa-
ble of producing a neutron flux of 1.7 x 10 neu-
trons/cm.2.-sec. However, the intensity of the fission
reaction can be controlled by boron carbide cylinders
which can absorb neutrons. By positioning these rods in

23

the control-rod thimbles located in the core, the neu-
tron flux can be controlled. The rods, positioned by a
servo-controlled motor, are held to their drive me-
chanism by an elecntromagnet. If the reaction should
need to be shut off quickly, the electromagnets can be
de-energized, thus causing the boron control rods to
fall -into the thimbles extending within the core. This
is called “scramming” the reactor. The reactors are
automatically scrammed by circuits in case of an ex-
cessive ﬂux level change.

The high temperatures caused by the fission re-
actions are controlled by the cooling system. Heat is
removed from the core assembly by distilled water
which acts as a primary coolant. The heat is then trans-
-ferred to the secondary coolant, city water, which is
being continuously circulated. Since the city water
never contacts the distilled. water, it is free of radio-
activity and can be easily disposed.

The efficiency of re=actors is increased by conﬁning
the neutron activity to the core by means of a reﬂec-
tor. This consists of graphite blocks stacked in layers
around the core. To protect against radiation the re-
flector is enclosed in a stee-1 shield. Further protection
is added by a five-foot thick shield of dense -hematite-
colmanite concrete that surrounds the reﬂector and
su-bpipe room. This shielding reduces the harmful radia-
tion to one-tenth of the speciﬁed safe rate.

Facilities for exposure to the radiation consist of
steel tubes extending through the concrete shielding.
Access to the radiation within t-he core can be had by
the central exposure tubes that extend into the core
itself. Gamma-rays can be picked up by beam tubes
that extend up to the core. The tubes are closed off
-with a graphite reﬂector and concrete plug when not
in use. A large exposure space is available between the
door in the concrete shielding and the graphite rc-
ﬂector column. Several of the graphite blocks can be
removed from the column to admit the radiation to
this space. Additional gamma radiation is carried here
by steel tubes from the radioactive gases that have
collected in the reco-mbiner.

A technique made possible by these reactors is
“neutron activation” which permits a very sensitive
method of chemical analysis. The sensitivity of one-
trillionth of ‘a gram can now be achieved by this
method.

“Neutron diffraction” is another newly developed
technique. It makes it possible to obtain structure analy-
sis for light elements in the presence of heavy ones.
X-ray diffraction runs into much difficulty with such
mixed atomic weights. Since the diffraction of neu-
trons is almost independent of atomic weight, i-t is not
as limited as x-ray diffraction.

Lowpower-level reactors for laboratories are, now
produced t-h-at can be used for experimentation in all
of these ﬁelds. These operate atponly ﬁve watts, but
can produce a neutron flux of 10-, and a gamma ray
flux ‘of 105.‘

Nuclear Reactors

This entire reactor is contained in a tank eight feet
high and eight feet in diameter. The compactness of
the reactor lies in the fact that at lower power level
the complex problems .of larger reactors can be over-
come by simple design features.

For example, the reactor core and the gas recom-
biner are resigned as one unit located at the center of
the reactor. The core is a one foot diameter sphere
with -a canopy that houses the recombiner assembly.
With the -recombiner located in th-is position, the re-
action gases enter directly into it, and the recombined
water is easily returned to the core. The canopy also
contains all -the "radioactive gases until they are to be
removed for exposure purposes.

The core assembly is encased with a six inch lead
shield. This serves as both a re-ﬂector for the radiation
and as a protective insulation.

The control rod system is a simpliﬁed version of
the ones used in larger reactors. Two cadmium control
rods enter the core vertically "through the canopy. They
a-re actuated :by electric motors controlled by the oper-
ator. The motors are so connected that only one rod
at a time may be lifted from the core. This prevents a
too rapid reaction from ocouring. Like larger reactors,
these may be scrammed -in case of an emergency.

The coo'ling of such laboratory reactors is effected
by the natural convection of the water contained in
the tank.

At the outer shell of this tank is a variety of ex-
posure facilities which mak-es these reactors very ap-
plicable for nuclear experiments.

The availability of such low cost reactors will un-“
doubtedly hasten the advance _of the atomic age. I

One- of the most rapidly expanding
newest fields of research is that of solid
state physics. Here is a description of this
area of research and how -revolutionary
new products are developed from it.

Solid state physics is simply the study of solids by
modern physic-al methods. It represents a new order
of ﬁnesse in the development of materials for the metal,
electronic, power, -chemical, and electrochemical in-'
dustries. To ‘improve existing materials and even more
important, to create new materials with cus-tom--built
properties for speciﬁc uses, -calls ‘for a deep understand-
ing of the nature of matter. Efficient nuclear reactors,
new high-temper-ature refractory materials, the minia-
turization of electronic components, and entirely new
electrochemical ,battery systems require a thorough
knowledge of the molecular, atomic, and su-b-atomic
makeup of solids for manufacture. The structure and
distortion of crystals, the interactions of atoms and
molecules, and the movements of the basic particles of

25 SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

electricity -and magnetism are but a few of the myster-
ies of science to be explored.
World War II Attracts Researchers

The concepts and experimental equipment needed
for such scientiﬁc «studies did not exist thirty or forty
years ago. The quan-tum theory of matter was not
developed to an advanced stage until after the 1920's
and its pracdcal apphcaﬁon to the study of sohds
became feasible only during World War II, when radar
requirements resulted in super-pure crystals to detect
signals of ultra-high frequencies. Simultaneously, the
experimental techniques to study their properties were
developed. Twenty years ago, no more than a ‘hundred
scientists were engaged in solid state physics; today the
field has attracted be-tween 3,000 and 4,000 researchers.

Sohd sane phgshx is concerned udth the ehxxrons
-surrounding the nuclei. These electrons may be visual-
ized as occupying deﬁnite orbits, as do the planets in
our solar system. Some of these orbital electrons are free
to- move within the solid. They can move under the in-
ﬁuence of electric or magnetic ﬁelds, or light of cer-
tain -energy and wave length can free t'hem from their
orbits. Extremes of heat, cold, and -pressure can all be
used to aﬁect their behavior.

Some of today’s products of research in solid state
physics are transistors, non-metallic magnets for com-
p-uters, solar batteries, n-on-metallic powders for modern
tape recorders, and rectiﬁers to con-vert alternating -cur-
rent to direct current.

Phosphors Being Studied

Although the transistor is the most publicized
product of solid state physics to date, there are many
others which may be even more spectacular and which
are just beginning to be explored. The relatively new
light source called luminescence is a product of the
soﬁd stauzstudy of phosphors VVe ennﬂoy today a
multitude of organic and inorganic phosphors in ﬂuore-
scent hghdng,in tdevkkng in radag in pahus and
inks, and in instruments for detecting radiation.

Photoluminescent phosphors are substances which
absorb electromagnetic ener , usually ultraviolet light,
an-d then emit this energy in the form of visible light.
The absorption of energy by the phosphor is called
“excitation” of the phospor, and the release of the
energy is called ﬂuorescence. The difference in the
wavelength of the absorbed and emitted light is an
important property of phosphors, because the mater-
ialias a consequence does not absorb rnuch. of the
light it. emits.

The exploitation of the properties of phosphors
has removed them from the realm of the laboratory
curiosity. Some phospors are now being produced in
tonnage quantity, though most of their uses require
on-ly gram amounts in each device.

It is obvious that the ﬁeld of solid state physics is
potentially one of the most exciting ﬁelds of research.
New developments can revolutionize many of tod-ay’s
products and produce startling new products. I

a new light source

Research in the field of semiconduc-
tors aud phosphors has resulted in a
spectacular new source of light. This art-
icle describes electroluminescence, which
will soon be available for commercial use.

ELECTROLUMINESCENCE

What is ca-lled electroluminescence today was first
discovered in 1936 by a French scientist, P-rofessor
Georges Destriau. Working in his laboratory with a
small group of co-workers, Professor Destrivau ex-
plored this new phenomenon until, in 194-7, he was able
to publish a review paper that set forth many of the
properties of electroluminescent cells. At that time, be-
fore it‘was possible .to see the faint glow produced by
these cells, it was first necessary to spend several min-
utes in a dark room until one’s eyes had bec-ome suffi-
ciently sensitive.

In the years following Destriau’s paper several ex-
perimental laboratories at industrial concerns and uni-
versities started to study this wnusual phenomenon. It
represented a fourth method of exciting light from the
solid materials we call phosphors. The earlier methods
had been with X-rays, with ultraviolet light as in
fluorescent lamps, and with cathode rays as in television
picture tubes.

An electroluminescent cell is constructed like a

BY KEN ROTHERT, CH. E. ’59

sandwich, in which the phosphor is placed between
two conducting plates much like those of a condenser.
When proper Volta-ge is applied between the conduct-
ing plates, the phosphor will give off light. The c_ell
consists of a glass plate, bearing a transparent con-
ducting coating, on which is sprayed a mixture of the
phosphor powder in a plastic binder. On- top of this
phosphor layer is evaporated a film of aluminum which
acts as a second conducting contact for the cell.
Electroluminescent Flashlight

Although still _in the realm of research, electro-
luminescence has already _been applied to practical
lightin-g situations by the Westinghouse Electric Cor-
poration. The world’s first electroluminescent flashlight
has been designed and constructed. No larger than
ordinary ones, this flashlight is powered by a 25 volt
battery and contains a special transistor circuit to pro-
vide 550 volts at 8500 cycles. No light bulb is used,
instead, a small glass disc gives off a blue col-ored light.

The flashlight is not yet available on the market; it has
been built only for testing purposes.

A room exhibiting this new electronic light has
also been designed and constructed. There are 112 glass
panels, each one foot square in size and giving off a
soft green light, which are used to illuminate the room
with shadowless light. Walls and ceiling of the room are
not lighted, but they appear to glow creating an atmos-
phere of light without light fixtures.

Color Shifting Phosphor

A variety of colors maybe obtained from this new
electronic light. With electroluminescence the house-
wife of the future may have complete mastery over the
lighting in her house. Two control knobs can be placed
in every room, one for brightness and the other for
color. Like the volume knob on a radio, they will adjust
for any level of brightness, and even more important,
will create any color atmosphere from varying shades
of white, to blue o-r red. The various-colors are ob-
tained by using different phosphors‘ and changing the
frequency of the applied voltage. Phosphors have been
used that will change colors in the same cell when a
change in frequency is made. These phosphors have the
obvious property that would be needed to create var-
ious color atmospheres in the home of tomorrow.

Graph showing efficiency of light sources through the
years.
Efficiency
Because the efficie-ncy of electroluminescence is
not yet up to everyday light sources, widespread use is
not economically feasible at this time. But the future
possibilities are unlimited. Figure 1. shows three curves,
one showing the increase in efficiency for incan-
descent lamps, one for fluorescent lamps, and the other
for elect-roluminescence. For incandescent lamps the
efficiency of the 100-‘watt lamp is now about 16 lumens
per watt, while the maximum possible efficiency that
could be obtained from a tungsten filament is 35 lumens
per watt. To attain this, the filament would have to
be operated at its melting point. This, of course, is not
practical and the temperature must be reduced for
lamp life.
In fluorescent lamps the story is somewhat dif-
ferent. Here efficiency is now between 60 and 70 lum-

ens per watt, but there are definite blocks preventing
a very large increase in efficiency. The type of dis-charge
used is only about 50 percent efficient, an-d there is yet
another loss of 50 percent in the conversion from
ultraviolet light to visible light. Through gra-dual im-
provement, ‘however, it may be possible to obtain 100
lumens per watt in the n-ot too distant future.

On‘ the other hand, electroluminescence te-lls
another story. Unlike brightness, peak efficiency of 10
lumens per watt was achieved by using electricity of
only a few hundred cycles and a few hundred volts.
Applying higher or lower values only. decreases the
efficiency, and there are no theoretical reasons why an
efficiency of 240 lumens per watt could not be obtain-
ed. If this figure were reached, the efficiency would be
four times that of the present fluorescent lamps. This
would mean a tremendous saving in power consumption
for lighting throughout the country.

Everyday Use Not Far Off

The possibi-lities for electroluminescence are bound-
less. But there are several things that must be done
before it is practical. An increase in efficiency is one
improvement that must be made. This can be effected
in several ways. Furt-her increase in the efficiency of
the phosphor itself may increase "the efficiency of elec-
trolumines-cence. Cell construction could be improved.
The imbeddin-g medium i-n which the phosphor is placed
could be improved considerably by improving its di-
electric properties. Also, a material must be found which
has a life equal to that of present-type light sources.
These developments are: necessary before electro-
luminescence wil-l ‘be truly competitive with existing
light sources. If progress continues at the rate it has
during the past several years, practical electrolumin-
escence should not be very far away. I

do technical men make good salesmen?

Many of the world’s most successful
salesmen are men who have had edu-
cation, training, or experience in tech-
nical ﬁelds.

Obviously, it does not follow that
every technical man could be a success-
ful salesman any more than every grad-
uate of business administration makes
a good businessman. But here at Col-
umbia-Southern, most of oursalesmen
have been technically trained. Although
they may have planned careers in re-
search or design, or in construction or
some other technical ﬁeld, selling has
given them greater opportunities to
exercise their best talents, and, conse-
quently, ro enjoy the rewards of greater
satisfaction and happiness.

IANUARY 1957

Selling chemicals, of course, is not
like selling house-to-house, or to the
general public. As a Columbia-Southern
salesman, you’re dealing with people
who, for the most part, are technically
trained themselves. Your ﬁrm is well

THE MODERN RESEARCH LAB

‘Space-wise, the scientist must -have a laboratory
well a-dapted to his particular ﬁeld of research. Often
the space must have feasi-bility as to size and arrange-
ment. Certain facilities such as water, common gases,
electric power, and the many other elements used in
experiments should be within arm’s reach. Also, spe-
cial equipment must be available for his use—devices
such as electron microscopes, mass spectrometers, dif-
fraction cameras, and the many other intricate devices
necessary for experiments. “Often, -he must ‘have specially

l‘his is a view of the machine shop at the Westing-
house research laboratories. Because of the versatility of
the machines and the operators, almost any metal can be
made into any desired shape for use in experimental ap-

34

built equipment to perform an experiment; the means
of -constructing this equipment must be at hand. Sourc-
es of information must -be available on current and past
research in his particular field. The scientist must have
places to meet with fellow scientists, so that informa-
tion can be freely exchanged.

Singly, these are relatively simple requirements. In
combining them, they are more difficult to achieve,
especially when the laboratory is active in broad ﬁelds.
Branc=hes of the same basic ﬁeld, such as physics, often
‘have far different laboratory requirements.

However, the importance of these requirements, no
matter ‘how deceptively simple, cannot be overlooked.
For one thing, the pace of research depends to a large
degree on ‘whether or not the necessary “tools” are
availa-biz. All of the tools are important, from the
supply of oxygen piped to the individual laboratory
to the most complicated experimental apparatus. I
Modern Laboratories

Several of the new laboratories have been designed
to fulfill these requirements. Examples of these are
the Westinghouse Research Laboratories at Churchill
Boro, Pennsylvania, an-d the National Carbon Labora-
tories at Parma, Ohio. Facilities available at these
laboratories are typical; of those at many of the new
research laboratories throughout the country.

In these modern research centers t=he laboratory
module is the smallest repetitive unit of space that is
completely equipped with laboratory and building ser-
vices. These modules can be combined in separate lab-
oratories of various sizes to suit the needs of individual
departments. The module is self contained as far as
services are concerned. Electric power, telephone, -heat,
hot and cold water, compressed air, vacuum, natural
gas, oxygen, and many of the rare gases are contained
in the module.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

A modern research laboratory is geared
to facilitate the needs of the scientists
quickly, efficiency, and as completely as
possible. This, plus the wide diversity of
materials needed for research have com-
plicated the laboratory.

The new laboratories are well-equipped with other
necessary facilities. For the scientist building a special
apparatus for an experiment, a machine shop, a car-
penter shop, and a glass-blowing laboratory can pro-
vide most of his special needs. Conference rooms and
auditoriums are available for discussion groups. Re-
feren-ce libraries. containing essential material for re-
search workers are usually found in t'hese modern re-
search laboratories. The inclusion of cafeteria facilities
make-s -many of the research centers self contained
“cities”.

Special Facilities
Numerous special facilities are also available. Such
equipment as electron microscopes, mass spectrographs,

and X-ray diffraction apparatus are contained in the
modern laboratory. Special laboratories are usually in-
cluded in the cen-ters. Low-temperature facilities capa-
ble of carrying on experiments within a few tenths of
a degree of absolute zero, high-voltage laborato-ries,
and technology laboratories equipped wit=h metals pro-
cessing equipment, -che-mical analysis devices, and other
specialized apparatus are among t-he faci-lities usually
available in the modern research laboratory.

Although research without modern laboratory fa-
cilities may be possible, each year it becomes less feasi-
ble. Every probe into the unknown produces more un-
knowns, and brings with it new problems of experi-
mentation. Without the necessary tools, research would
proceed at a much slo-wer pace. I

Typical of 158 similar units, this module at Union

a wide variety of utilities. Movable metal partitions make
it possible to rearrange individual research modules as

a tool of research

To the scientist and engineer photo-
graphy is now serving as an indispensible
tool in the solution of many research
and technical problems. It is an invaluable
record which can be subjected to study
and measurement and kept for future ref-
erence.

There is a considerable number of well known
scientific techniques and apparatus developed to pro-
vide information concerning the structure of materials,
the direct analysis of chemical substances, and the ef-
fects of various ‘forces on materials. Practically all of
these had their beginning in research laboratories and
were then streamlined in both appearance and opera-
tion so that technicians can -carry out the required
manipulation and supply the data to the scientist or
engineer.

There are several photographic methods and techni-
ques used by engineers and scientists. A good indica-
tion of the value of photography in conjunction with
research becomes apparent from the examples of how
photographic methods aid in solving research and
technical problems.

Photoelastic Stress Analysis

Photoelastic Stress Analysis is an eﬂective method
available to the engineer for solving problems of stress
distribution. In simple cases, it can be used alone or
as a check on mathematical solution, but more com-
plex problems are solved almost entirely by mathema-
tical analysis of the stress pattern.
Photomicrography And Metallography

Pihotomicrography and Metallography are well
known techniques. In the study of alloys and similar
materials, surface features can be carefully studied, and
t-he effect of etching ‘procedures determined. It is there-
fore possible to control and improve production at
least to some degree by means of these techniques.
Electron Microscopy

Electron microscopy reveals structural characteris-
tics invisible with the light microscope and is assuming
greater importance each day in connection with the
studies of abrasive materials, colloidal solution-s, and
the structure of many synthetic and natural substances.
Electron micrographs of developed silver grains reveal-
ed for the first time their real physical form.
X-Rays

X-rays are widely used in production control for
the detection of ﬂaws in metal castings permitting t'he
removal of defective units before packing and shipping.
X-rays of longer wavelength are used in the so-called
Grenz-ray technique adapted to the study of the inter-
nal structure of materials such as woven cloth and

., \,

ot'her fabrics. The extremely short wavelength Gamma
rays emitted by radium, are even more penetrating and
they will penetrate as much as 15 inches of steel.

X-Ray diffraction is a method of studying t'he inter-
nal molecuelar structure of crystals, identifying crystal-
line substances in combination with others, and iden-
tifying crystalline substances having the same che-mical
formula -but different structure. This technique can also
be used to study the effects of various treatments of
materials, measurement of residual stresses and observa-
tion of distortion in crystals.
Electron Diffraction Analysis

Electron diffraction analysis has become necessary,
not on-ly to. identify the constituents of a material, but
to record the arrangement of the atoms and molecules
involved. By bombarding suitable prepared samples
with electrons, very deﬁnite patterns can be obtained
on photographic ﬁlm iwhich, when interpreted, reveal
the structural form of that material.
Spcctographic Analysis

Today spectographic analysis is a common proced-
ure in analytical laboratories and is used for both re-

 

radioactive isotopes. The emulsion is placed in contact
-with the specimen for the optimum time. This techni-
que is applied to many investigations in which the
radio-active isotopes are used as tracer elements.
High-Speed Photography

In many research and engineering problems, high-
speed photography reveals action that is invisible to the
naked eye. The various techniques employed are rapid-
ly becoming indispensable in the solution of these pro-
blems because they‘ produce pictures from which scien-
tiﬁc and engineering data can be obtained.

Shadograph or spark high-speed photography util-
izes extremely high intensity and short-duration illum-
ination. This permits pictures of rapidly occuring or
invisible turbulence, liqu-id shear, cavitation pheno-
mena, and objects moving at high speed. The repetitive
slash technique is also extremely useful.

S-chlieren photography is a method for studying
small changes in pressure and ‘temperature and for the
examination of changes in transparent solids. High-
speed techniques render v-isible the following: convec-
ti-on streams, air movements, vortex rings ‘formed in

search and production control. The chief advantage of
this technique is the identiﬁ-cation and esti-mation of
several elements within a few minutes. All of the data
is obtained from a record made on special photographic
plates. In large volume operations, automatic recorders
plot the wavelength of the emission and the concentra-
tion of the elements present.
Photographic Emulsion

Some analytical problems cannot be solved without
photography since emulsion is the only medium capa-
ble -of recording invisible radiations. An outstanding
example of this is the recording of tracks or paths of
nuclear particles resulting from the bombardment of
atoms in cyclotrons, betatrons, synchrotrons, and simi-
liar equipment. The speed of these particles in air is
reduced by the stopping power of the gelatin emulsion,
to a point where their path of progress is revea-led by
a developed silver image in the form of tracks which
are magnified and re-photographed. Microscopic ex-
amination provides data such as the angle of penetra-
tion and the path lengt-h. From these the energy of the
particle can be determined. Particles can be positively
identiﬁed when the composition of the emulsion, the
energy of the nucleus of the particle, and the condi-
tions of bombardment are known. An exceptionally
ﬁne example is the recording of meson tracks on cyclo-
trons.

Autoradiography is dependent on the photographic
emulsion as the means to record the radiation from

warm air or in vapors of different density, and com-
pression waves of sound. Of particular signiﬁcance is
its value in the study of explosion waves and the cata--
phoresis of colorless solutions.

High-speed motion pictures are used to measure
mechanical and electrical effects; for the determination
of velocities, accelerations an-d degrees of movement;
to study welding arcs, combustion processes, explosive
reactions, -paint spraying, fundamental chemical pro-
cesses, the action of impeller blades in mixing oper-
ations, flow characteristics, catalysis, fiber extrusion, par-
ticle motion; and for the derivation of d_ata in guided.

HONEYWELL IS A GROWTH COMPANY!

A growth company is one where men move ahead be-
cause of opportunity and challenge . . . where problems
are turned into progress . . . where employment, sales
and income increase steadily year after year.

Honeywell, today’s world leader in the automatic
control ﬁeld, is such a company. For the past 30‘years,
sales have doubled or tripled every ﬁve years ($1,084,-
259 in 1926; $244,482,068 in 1955). Employment has
increased from 720 to over 25,000 in the same period,
and net earnings have climbed from $424,241 to
$19,278,648.

This healthy growth of Honeywell is shown in the
table below.

The future is even more challenging. Planned diver-
siﬁcation puts Honeywell in such new ﬁelds as office and
factory automation, process control, transistors, plas-
tics, atomic energy, electronics, missiles and satellites.

“Here are some of the facts about Honeywell that
have been of real interest to the young engineering

graduates we talk to.”

Honeywell has the proven skills to design, engineer and
build the equipment required by an increasingly auto-
matic world and to sell its products proﬁtably.

RESEARCH AND ENGINEERING ARE
IMPORTANT AT HONEYWELL!

Research, design-development and product engineering
are indispensable for continued. growth. Honeywell’s
research and engineering have advanced twice as fast
as growth in sales.

Honeywell’s growth from a small thermostat com-
pany has been stimulated by research. And today re-
search and development work in metallurgy, ceramics,
heat transfer, plastics, vacuum tubes, ultrasonics,
magnetic materials, semi-conductors, and combustion
suggests new growth. Never in history has the potential
of these and similar Honeywell development programs
looked so promising.

at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft
in the field of Combustio =1‘

 

Historically, the process of combus-
tion has excited man’s insatiable
hunger for knowledge. Since his
most primitive attempts to make
use of this phenomenon, he has
found tremendous fascination in its
potentials.

Perhaps at no time in history has
that fascination been greater than
it is today with respect to the use
of combustion principles in the
modern aircraft engine.

At Pratt & Whitney Aircraft,
theorems of many sciences are being
applied to the design and develop-
ment of high heat release rate de-
vices. In spite of the apparent sim-
plicity of a combustion system, the

bringing together of fuel and air in
proper proportions, the ignition of
the mixture, and the rapid mixing
of burned and unburned gases in-
volves a most complex series of

interrelated events — events ocur-
ring simultaneously in time and
space.

Although the combustion engi-
neer draws on many ﬁelds of science
(including thermodynamics, aero-
dynamics, ﬂuid mechanics, heat
transfer, applied, mechanics, metal-
lurgy and chemistry) , the design of
combustion systems has not yet
been reduced to really scientiﬁc
principles. Therefore, the highly
successful performance of engines

like the J -57, J -75 and others stands
as a tribute to the vision, imagina-
tion and pioneering efforts of those
at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft en-
gaged in combustion work.

While combustion assignments,
themselves, involve a diversity of
engineering talent, the ﬁeld is only
one of a broadly diversiﬁed engi-
neering program at Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft. That program——with other
far-reaching activities in the ﬁelds
of instrumentation, materials prob-
lems, mechanical design and aero-
dynamics — spells out a gratifying
future for many of today’s engi-
neering students.

Mellon Institute. is one of Pittsburgh's most important
and well known research centers. Scientists in the fields
of pure and applied science are carrying out experiments

on seventy-one Fellowships.

RESEARCH IN PITTSBURGH

The Pittsburgh area is probably the
largest concentration of research activity
in the world. There are many reasons why
industry centers its research here.

Pittsburgh plays an important role in scientiﬁc re-
search. Today, approximately 50 industrial research
laboratories, many of which were started by notable
Pittsburghers, are actively functioning in this area.

George Westinghouse, who helped ‘bring about a
revolution in the railroad industry, has given his name
to a company which, seventy y-ears later, is a leader in
research. Recent-ly completed, the Westinghouse Lab-
oratories in Churchill Borough house more than seven
acres of up-to-date facilities for scientific research.
Over 700 people are employed in the various labora-
tories, offices and shops. Included in these facilities are
a technical library, a complete metal processing lab-
oratory, an instruments and glass-blowing laboratory,
and also research services such. as a photographic and
reproduction "laboratory.

The Pittsburgh Reduction ‘Company began with
the commercial operation of Charles Hal1’s electrolytic
reduction process in 1880. Since then, the company
has progressed under the name of A'LCOA and has

remained in Pittsburgh. This is only one of the many
industrial corporations, which, having recognized the
technical potential available in Pittsburgh, has remain-
ed here.

Abundance of many natural resources is one of the
most important incentives for the formation of com-
panies here in Pittsburgh. The accessability of coal and
iron ore resulted in the formation of -many large steel
corporations near Pittsburgh. The world’s largest pro-
ducer of steel, United. -States Steel, has recently com-
pleted a new research center in Monroeville. T-he fa-
cilities at t-he new research center are divided into
fundamental research and applied research. The fun-
damental research division employs chiefly small-sc-ale
facilities for ﬁne measurements; therefore, small labora-
tories are predominate throughout the building. The
applied research division is housed in three buildings
which consist of the main laboratory, the experimental
engineering shop, and the raw materials processing

Another reason for the many research divisions
near, or in, Pittsburgh is t'he availability of vast sources
of technica-l men and knowledge from the University of
Pittsburgh, Carnegie Institute of Technology, and the
Mellon Institute.

The Mellon Institute, which ‘was founded in 1913,
has contributed greatly to the ﬁelds of botl1 pure and
applied sciences. Its activities have dealt largely in the
ﬁelds of physics, chemistry, the engineering sciences
and techn-ologies, with emphasis on ‘their application
to the important problems of human welfare such as
public health, sanitation, stream pollution control,
smoke abatement, and alleviation of industrial hazards.
Mellon Instit-ute recognizes the need for fundamental
scientiﬁc research as a background and stimulus for
applied research. It ﬁnances and carries out numerous
pure science investigations. Basic investigations in di-
versiﬁed ﬁeld.s of science has resulted in many original
contributions to scientiﬁc literature. especia"l?ly in re-
spect to new drugs, spectroscopy, x-rays, and distillation
theory. Many of the ‘research programs have led to
new branches of manufacture.

Among the recent achievements in applied science
at Mellon Institute are improvements in refractories,
procelain enamels, building material, and optical glass,
and important additions 'to the knowledge of steelmak-
ing, steel construction, welding, and metal-working.
The Institute is active in assisting the by-product coke
industry to map its future ‘and in investigating -recovery
processes and methods for utilizing coal chemi-cals. Its
work in petroleum chemistry and technology is also
recognized internationally as authoritative.

Mellon Institute is operated by means of contracts
with Fellowship Donors. The Fellowship must be at
least one year or longer in duration and it must have
the full time services of at least one scientist.

a contract with the Institute. The proposed ﬁeld of in-
vestigation must be one in which the application of the
natural scien-ces, particularly the chemical sciences,
offers hope of success. It must also be the only one in
its ﬁeld -at the Institute to prevent conﬂicts among
interests within the Institute. Cooperative association
among the individual research specialists is encourag-
ed at all times, and any results obtained from the re-
search of a Fellowship, is the "property of its donor.
T-he ﬁelds that the various Fellowships in the Institute
cover range anywhere from the examination of in-
fra-red spectra to the quest for a new ca-n and closure
coating. The work of Mellon Institute has contributed
in many ways to the technical progress of American
industry and has aided in bringing many of industry’s
achievements to successful use. I

On Monday, October 8, 1956, Pitt officially opened
a data processing center. At t-he ceremony in the Cathe-
dral of Learning Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld
commented on the University’s plans in the area of
electronic computers- The IBM equipment tapped out
this greetin.g: “Unaccustomed as I am’to public speak-
i-ng, I would like to thank you for attending my coming-
out party”.

The University administration has great plans for
the mew center. The 650 will soon be surrounded by a
library, problem analysis and programing offices, and
a special designed classroom. These faci'lities as well as
the computer and associated equipment will offer Pitt
a service in three distinct areas. First, it will speed
University research projects in many ﬁelds, ‘from n-u-
clear physics and public health to personnel selection
and management controls. Second, it will serve as a
train-ing center for people ‘who will meet the tremend-
ous demand for skilled personnel in this ﬁeld. This will
be accomplished through courses in mathematics, busi-
ness research and engineering, and in other areas as
the center expands its scope of operations. Third, the
opening of a data processing center immediately makes

it possible to offer its services to industry and govern-
ment.

The Center, located on the eighth ﬂoor of the [Cathe-
dral of Learning, is a complete IBM ins-t-allaition. A
sorter, a reproducing machine, a read punch unit, an
accounting machine, a punch machine, and the 650 is
the list of equipment which -can be found in the new
center. The sorter, much like the one seen on the
“Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Question,” T V pro-
gram, can detect various patterns of holes punched in
IBM cards as the cards pass over sensitive '-brushes.
The punch machine, a most important part of the
center, has many -of the charactertis-tics of a typewriter.
A problem which is going to be solved by the 650 is
completely punched on IBM cards. This programing, or

lANUARY1957

problem-coding so that cards may be punch-éd, is the
first step in solving a problem. The punched cards
with the orders for t.he 650 are placed in the read
punch unit. This is used as a means of introducing data
into, and obtaining results from, the 650. This unit
reads input data and instructions at the rate of 200
cards per minute and punches output results at the
rate of 100 cards per minute.

The punched card output of the 650 and read punch
unit represents a means to an end—the means to
prepare, on an a-c-counting machine, the various print-
ed answers needed by the problem originator. The
punched results of the 650 are processed at the rate
of 150 cards per min-ute -by this accounting machine.
These cards are reduced to printed answers at the rate
of 150 li-nes per minute. Therefore the answer to a pro-
blem which has been coded, cards punched and sorted,
and fed into the 650 through the read punch unit is
printed for management on an accounting machine.

The 650, the foundation of the new data process-
ing center, solves routine ‘and complex calculations
with equal facility. It is a stored program machine
with logical ability which can add, subtract, multiply

and divide. Un-like a mere calculator, it remembers"

instructions and follows them as dictated by the punch-
ed cards. The magnetic drum, a cobalt-nickel plated
metal cylinder, 16 inches -long and 4 inches in diameter
is the heart of the 650. This drum which revolves at
12,500 revolutions per minute stores information by
means of magnetized spots on its surface. The driim
can store 20,000 digits at one time.

To administer this new center at Pitt, Chancellor
Litch‘-ﬁeld has appointed William B. Kehl as the di-
rector of the Data Processing Center. Mr. Kehl has
worked at the Instrumentation Laboratory of the Mass-
achusetts Inst-itute of Technology for the past two years
on systems development and on research into mathe-
matical and digital computer techniques. A native of
Pitts-burgh, Mr. Kehl did graduate work at Harvard
and MIT and has taught at Georgia Tech and MIT.
In addition to directing the programs of the Data Pro-
cessing Center, Mr. Ke'hl will teach advanced courses
in applied mathernatics and computer methods. In
reviewing ‘plans for the Center, Mr. Kehl hailed Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld’s emphasis on the development of co-
operative relationships with industry and government
as well as on the pioneering of new applications in
scientiﬁc research and in management controls.

To work with Mr. Kehl in the managi-ng of the new
Data Processing Center and in teaching computer
techniques is a small staff of able men. Professor S. -C.
Hanna of the Mathematics Department and Professor
D. G. Schilnder, a recent graduate from the School of
Engineering here at Pitt, are a part of this staff. With
these men leading -the way PEDRO, a friendly con-
traction for Pitt Electronic Data-processing Research
Organization, will establish for Pitt a great reputation
in a new ﬁeld. I

longest-range airplane in the world,’ capable of non-
stop ﬂights up ‘to 6300 miles without consuming its re-
serves. Its all-new 150-foot wing, longest in span of
any -transport, carries 9600 gallons of fuel and allows
relocation of engines farther outboard, for maximum
cabin quiet. The sturdy 104-9-H,‘identical in dimensions
with the Super G, can -carry u-p to twenty tons of
cargo, equivalent "to two freight-car loads, or it can be
converted in a few ‘hours into a comfortable airliner for
93 passengers. The 123-foot wing of the 1049H has
an aspect ratio of 8.5, compared with an aspect ratio of
12 for its sister ship. The 1649A wing is also one
sixth thinner, making possible cruise speeds of 350 miles

per hour and a top speed approaching 400 miles per
hour.

TINY LIGHT-SENSITIVE DIRECTION FINDER

A tiny light-sensitive electronic device that may be
used to guide missiles by sunlight, spot the ﬂashes of
distant artillery, or enable blind operators to ﬁnd plug-
in positions in a telephone switchboard has been un-
veiled by the Radio Corporation of America.

Development of the new device, a novel type of
photocell no larger than the eraser on the end of a
pencil, was disclosed at a meeting of the Professional
Group on Electron Devices, Institute of Radio Engin-
eers. The transistor-like cell is capable of sensing with
a high degree of accuracy both the direction and in-
tensity of a source of light. The compact device is
capable of -performing with improved accuracy and
efficiency many f-unctions which have been handled
previously only with as many as four separate conven-
tional photocells.

The development is based on the recent discovery
of a phenomenon that occurs when light is focused by
a lens on a semiconductor junction like those used in
transistors to generate and control a flow of electrons.
It has long -been known that when light shines directly
on such a junction, :1 small voltage is generated across
the junction from front to rear. In addition to this
previously known effect, it has now been discovered

 

Miniature photocell that can sense accurately both
direction and intensity of a light source.

th-at,when the position of the light is c-hanged so that
a point of light str-ikes the junction to one side or the
other of its center, a voltage also is developed along the
junction‘ from side to side.

This lateral voltage has been put to use in a new
type of photocell whose most interesting characteristic
is an additional -photo-output that varies from a posi-
tive to a negative value over -its surface. The result is
achieved by use of three electrical connections instead
of the usual two in conventional cells.

This means that a point of light, focused on the
photocell by a lens, will produce a signal between two
of t-he connections that varies with the angle between
the direction to the light and the axis of the cell. These
signals can be read with high accuracy to determine
the direction and intensity of.the light source. At the
same time, t-he third electrical connection produces a
normal photocell signal in response to the intensity of
the light and independent of its direction.

“CANNED" MOTOR PUMP

Four 1600--hp, 2300-volt “canned” motor pumps,
the world’s largest, have entered their ﬁnal stages of
construction at Westinghouse Electric Corporation’s
atomic equipment plant at Cheswick, Pennsylvania.
They are the main coolant pumps for the nation’s first
fu'll-scale atomic electric generating station at Shipp-
ingport, Pennsylvania.

In this type of pump, both the stationary outer
coils and the rotorare “canned” in metal, -and the
radioactive water flows through the space between
them. In addition, the water serves as a bearing lubri-
cant. These are the first canned motor pumps with
Class H insulation to be designed for 2300-volt opera-
tion. Each pump weighs nearly 14 tons, s-tands 10
feet -high and is 4 ‘feet in diameter. Capacity of each
pump is 18,300 gpm at- approximately 2000 psi at up
to 600 degrees F. There are no external shaft seals in
the motor pumps, and suction and discharge nozzles
are designed to be welded into the pipeline.

FANS DESIGNED TO OPERATE “RED HOT”

The Westinghouse Electric ‘Corporation has in-
sta‘l~led two nine-foot gas recirculating fans, capable
of handling gases at 850 degrees F, at the Philo, Ohio,
plant of the American Gas and Electric Service Cor-
poration.

For use on the first commercial supercritical pres-
sure steam generator at the Philo plant, the fan wheels
are capable of -a top speed of 25,000 feet per minute
while hand.ling the hot gases. These wheels begin -to-
glow from the extreme heat when operating at the
high temperatures.

These extreme perfomance requirements created
complex engineering problems in the design of the
-fans. It was neccessary to control the expansion of the
fans, for the wheels, in building up from room tempera-
ture to maximum operating conditions, expand five-
eightrhs of an inch with the other parts of the unit in-
creasing in proportion. Adding to the problem was the
fact that the radial-bladed wheels had to -be built
without side plates.

Background of
the first transatlantic

telephone cab/es

Each room in Western Electric’s clinically clean
repeater plant was kept under positive air pressure
at all times so that dust-laden air could not leak in.

JANUARY 1957

Teamwork characterized the Bell System’s role in the
success of a tremendous undertaking: laying the ﬁrst
transatlantic telephone cables.

One challenge given engineers and scientists at Bell
Telephone Laboratories was that of designing equalizing
networks and ampliﬁers to be placed in the cables every
40 miles to compensate for the huge attenuation losses.
Electron tubes of unrivaled endurance were developed,
capable of operating for up to twenty years.

Western Electric, manufacturing and supply unit of
the Bell System, assembled the repeaters in a special
plant under clinical conditions. A mere speck of dust
could fatally upset the sensitive ampliﬁers.

The delicate and demanding job of laying the cables
was supervised by engineers from Long Lines Depart-
ment of A. T. & T. New cable-laying equipment was
designed, and exacting procedures were devised so that
the cable could be laid smoothly and safely on an ocean
floor in places more than two miles deep.

Teamwork helps Bell System engineers and scientists
to anticipate and provide for America’s growing com-
munications needs, no matter what the magnitude of the
job to be done.

Able, imaginative young engineers and scientists will
ﬁnd absorbing careers with the Bell’Te_lephone Com-
panies, Bell Telephone Laboratories, Western Electric
and Sandia Corporation. Your placement officer can

How to keep paper machine speeds
and tensions under control

A other page for
O n

   

To give better control of roll speeds and
sheet tensions in a paper machine, engi-
neers developed a new differential drive
system that uses a single line shaft to
power individual paper machine rolls.
This called for rigid shaft mountings and
extremely accurate gear mesh. So the
engineers specified Timken® tapered
roller bearings for the drive units. Timken
bearings hold shafts and gears in rigid
alignment. Gear mesh is smoother, more
accurate. Shaft wear is eliminated, gear
wear reduced.

 

How 'l'lMKEN® bearings hold g
0 gear shafts rigid

The full line contact between rollers and races of Timken j
bearings gives shafts rigid support over a wide area. Shaft
deﬂection is minimized. And the tapered design of Timken
bearings permits them to be set up with the most desirable
amount of end play or preload that gives the best per- ’
formance.

MODERN RESEARCH

Aluminum Company of America Research Center in
New Kensington, Pennsylvania, includes such things
as measuring bending stresses in supported aluminum
cables, testing armor rods for protecting aluminum
cable, and measuring compressive strength of alumin=um
alloy castings.

Not all engineering research, however, can be con-
sidered remote. The Engineering Research Division at
the University of Pittsburgh ‘has been conducting re-
search on a large scale for some time. A main ben-e-
factor of this research has been the Un-ited States
Armed Forces. Capable of conducting such tests as
sudden shock and vibration, the division’s facilities in-
clude a cold-hot box in which -both high and low ex-
tremes of temperature can be obtained and an elaborate
vibration system capable of operating at 50 cps.

New ideas are constantly being worked on for
future use. The Dynamometer Building -at the General
Motors Technical Center near Detroit, Michigan, has
been designed to provide facilities for the wide range of
special tests encountered’ in developmental work. The
dynamometer cells are designed to produce road con-
ditions in the laboratory. Automobiles of the future are
subjected to various tests that enable engineers to design
and build better cars. Tests are also conducted on new
concepts in the individual components of the cars.
Experimental work is now being done on gas turbine
engines, the potential engine of the future.

Research then is not merely a process of acquiring
information. It is the essence of research to find a use-
ful applicability to modern convenience. I

B-52 iack screw—a typical Boeing design

On Boeing B-52 bombers, the hori-
zontal tail surface has more area than the
wing of a standard twin—engine airliner.
Yet it can be moved in flight, up or down,
to trim the aircraft.

The device that performs this function
is a jack screw, which, though it weighs
only 255 pounds, can exert a force of
approximately 225 tons!

Many kinds of engineering skills went
into designing and developing a jack
screw so precise that it automatically com-
pensates for stretch and compression
under load. Civil, electrical, mechanical
and aeronautical engineers, and mathe-
maticians and physicists — all ﬁnd chal-
lenging work on Boeing design projects
for the B-52 global jet bomber, and for
the 707 jet tanker-transport, the B0-

IANUARY1957

MARC IM-99 pilotless interceptor, and
aircraft of the future.

Because of Boeing's steady expansion,
there is continuing need for additional
engineers. There are more than twice as
many engineers with the company now
as at the peak of World War II. Because
Boeing is an “engineers’ company," and
promotes from within, these men ﬁnd
unusual opportunities for advancement.

Design engineers at Boeing work with
other topnotch engineers in close—knit
project teams. They obtain broad experi-
ence with outstanding men in many
ﬁelds, and have full scope for creative
expression, professional growth and indi-
vidual recognition. And they find satis-
faction in the high engineering integrity
that is a Boeing byword.

chaﬂenge

In addition to design engineering,
there are openings on other Boeing teams
in research and production. Engineers
like the life in the “just—right” size com-
munities of Seattle and Wichita. They
may pursue advanced studies with com-
pany assistance in tuition and participate
in a most liberal retirement plan. There
may be a place for you at Boeing—Seattle
or Boeing—Wichita.

HE TROUBLE-SHOOTS ENGINEERING PROBLEMS

He had the honor of helping to design
the big machine. So part of the job of
ﬁeld trouble-shooting falls to him, too.
The drilling rigs that National Supply
manufactures are the size of.-a build-
ing, great machines made up of many
components. When special ﬁeld prob-
lems occur, it’s much more practical
to send the engineer to the machine
than the other way around!

Nobody’s Nose to the Grindstone
—This is a company in which promis-
ing young men are decidedly not
chained to desk jobs. Some manage
oil field stores—no routine matter
when these stores stock thousands of
items and have gross sales ranging
from a hundred thousand to. ten
million dollars annually. Others drive
as much as 3000 miles a month seeing
customers. Others represent National
Supply overseas—we have oﬂices or
agents in 24 countries on six conti-
nents. Still others handle important
jobs in plant and store administration,
ﬁnance, accounting, engineering and
many other ﬁelds. National Supply is
a fast moving outﬁt and our people
must move fast with it.

64

What Size is Opportunity?—
National Supply products are being
used in every oil ﬁeld this side of the
iron curtain. We are also a major
producer of pipe and electrical conduit
for the construction industry. A new
Industrial Products Division has just
been created. Among other things it
is introducing a line of heavy-duty
industrial torque converters. With a
quarter-billion in sales and almost
10,000 employees, National Supply is
big enough to offer many‘ chances for
promotion and small enough for a
good man to stand out.

Just Twenty-Five—Every year
National Supply conducts a search for
twenty-ﬁve exceptional college grad-
uates. Accountants, industrial man-
agement majors, salesmen and engi-
neers—men who want responsibility,

who prefer to move up rather than
vegetate. For those interested in a
general business career there is a
broad nine months training program
which includes indoctrination lec-
tures, ﬁeld assignments and plant
visits. For the engineer who seeks the
challenge of product design there is a
longer range development program
embracing indoctrination, plant and
ﬁeld experience. In either case, they
will be men who are attracted by
National Supply’s unusual and un-
limited growth possibilities.

The National Supply men coming
to your campus can tell you more.

important practical experience on the engineering
staﬂ of Lockheed Aircraft Corporation

in Burbank, California.

Engineers in Lockheed’s Structures Division are supported
by unmatched research and testing facilities in their constant
effort to increase strength while decreasing weight.

Among those facilities are the Lockheed-designed 500,000 lb.
Force Fatigue Machine, ﬁrst of its size; Shimmy Tower,

only one in private industry; and Drop Test Tower,

largest in the nation.

Facilities such as these give engineers a major advantage

in making technical advances — and thus advancing their
careers. Moreover, the large number of projects always in
motion at Lockheed mean continuing opportunity for
promotion as well as job security.

Why Lockheed needs Engineers with Structures training:

‘I. “Fail-Safe" Structures —— Lockheed has begun an extensive
pioneering effort in the new concept of “fail-safe" structures.
Studies are being applied to virtually all phases of Lockheed’s
diversiﬁed development program — already the largest

in the company’s history.

2. New studies in: Effect of high temperatures on structures;
optimization of thin-wing designs and other aero-elastic
problems; new materials such as ultra-high heat treat steel,
panel instability at extremely high speeds.

in choosing where
you want to work.
AtNorthAmerican,
fringe benefits are
second-to-none;
but you can get
much more than that. Such extras as creative work,
advanced technology, latest facilities to implement
your work—these all add up to rewards an ordinary
job cannot give. You'll work with men of high profes-
sional standing. Your personal contribution will earn
quick recognition.

METALLURGICAL BRANCH AIME AND
AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR METALS

The American Society for Metals and the Metallur-

for their meeting in room 332 in the Cathedral of
Learning. In keeping with the idea that a good en-
gineer -must have some knowledge in ﬁelds other
than his own, not only movies of the metallurgical
processes, but also movies on the other ﬁelds of en-
gineering are shown. The seminar committee selects
the movies that will be shown and the four speakers
that will bevpresented. Men ‘who are working on some
of the metallurgical advances too recent to appear
in the text book are generally asked to speak. Gra-
duates of the University’s School of Engineering and
Mines frequently come back to tell how they worked
up to their present positions.

Several square dances are usually held during the
semester. The dancesare held alternately at North and
South Parks. Professor Robert  King of the Metal-
lurgical Engineering Department acts as “caller” and
furnishes the records. An admission fee of $1 is charged
and refreshments are served.

Oh Engineers with hairy ears,

Designing dams and ditches,

Controlling floods and blowing
suds,

And never reaching riches;

When you want fun, your tastes
don’t run

To graphs and mathematics,

But to the Palms and Theodore
Zincks

And Ball-room acrobatics.

You make surveys of waterways,

And plan for irrigation,

But H20 to gin that’s sloe,

You add in moderation.

With stress and strain you ascer-
tain

The ways to make frames rigid,

Then spend the night ’til broad
daylight

By making dam-es less frigid.

Oh, Engineers have hairy ears;

I find them most endearing,

But awfully odd, because by God,

They don’t like engineering.

AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS

The American Society of Mechanical Engineers is
continuing in its objective to foster -professional devel-
opment and encourage student cooperation. Meetings,
which are held on Thursdays in the auditorium of the
Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial Hall, consist of speak-
ers, business sessions, and technical and non-technical
movies of special interest. A lecture on the importance
of patents to engineering is planned for January.

The cost of the membership pin, a subscription to
Mechanical Engineering, and the privilege of sending
in for several -free technical papers are included in the
$5.00 membership fee.

Student paper competitions are held yearly, and
the winner from Pitt competes with winners from other
schools in this section.

The ASME has already held a tour of the West-
inghouse Research Laboratory in Churchill Borough,

and a smoker in the student lounge. Supplementing
these activities has been the participation in the school’s
intramural sports program.

Planned for next semester are a ﬁeld trip to Ship-
pingport, attendance at the downtown ASME Spring
Conference, a ‘picnic, and another smoker.

Elected-to serve as oﬁ"icers are:

President .......................................... __ C.-harles Muzik
Vice-President ................................ __ Robert Everett
Secretary .......................................... .- Adrian Smith
Treasurer .......................................... .. Howard Allen
Advisor -, ................................ __ Professor B. I. Leidy

SOCIETY OF AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERS

The Society of Automotive Engineers enjoys the
national membership standing of being fourth in
universities and eighth in the nation. Membership cost-
ing $3 per year includes a monthly journal which
contains a study of developments in automotive engin-
eering and related fields. Summer and post graduate
job placement, tutoring service and a monthly dinner
offer advantages of membership.

The seminar, which meets every other Thursday
in Clapp Hall Auditorium, is designed to provide both
educational and social activities. The meetings contain
formal business proceedure with either a speaker or a
ﬁlm. ]anua'ry’s events will include a talk by Robert. E.
Cameron of the Ethyl Corporation, and a talk by Ed
Hugus, the 1956 winner of the Le Mans 24-hour

STEAM
AND THE WORLD'S
lARGES'l' BAKERY

This new boiler plant at Nabisco’s huge
Chicago bakery was planned to‘ provide,
eﬂiciently and economically, the steam
that the bakery must have on tap at all
times for heat, hot water and various
processing operations.

Because the reliability, eﬂiciency and
economy of its steam source are so vital
to this world-famous company, they
selected B&W boilers.

Think a moment of most companies’
use of steam——and its cost. Take a fast
turn around a boiler plant. Spend a
little time chatting—perhaps quite prof-
itably—with engineers. Get the facts on
a company’s invested steam dollars in
relation to the return they’re getting. If
the facts add up to problems, B&W en-
gineers can and will help industrial com-
panies and their consulting engineers
solve these problems.

When a B&W boiler is chosen, long-
range performance is assured. And isn’t
that what the buyer really wants? Not the
boiler but its end product, the steam,
and the assurance of an efﬁcient, de-
pendable, economical steam source. The

medium sized

74

service records of thousands of B&W
boilers, in thousands of large, small and
industrial and utility
plants, supply that assurance.

PETROLEUM BRANCH AIME

The purpose of the Petroleum Branch of the Ameri-
can Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum
Engineers is to enable the student to acquire a diversiﬁ-
ed knowledge of the petroleum industry and to provide
him with aid and information concerning professional
employment- The Institute feels that practical experi-
ence is a necessity if a petroleum engineering stu-dent is
to be able to grasp fully his academic studies. This
experience can be gained only through summer or part-
time employment and the information received at the
weekly seminar. The meetings also give the student
some concept of the scope of the petroleum industry.
There is no cost to join this institute, which is open to
Petroleum Engineering and Geological Engineering stu-
dents. .

Meetings are held every Thursday in the lecture
room of the Carnegie Museum. T-hey consist mainly
of movies and speakers. Mr. Mc'Crabb, vice-president
of Stan-dard Vaccum Company, and two members of
the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh, Mr.

In Boston there were two broth-
ers, one a bachelor and the other
married, who looked so much alike
you‘ could hardly tell them apart.
One lost his Wife, and shortly after-
wards the other lost his ﬁshing row-
boat, a quite dilapidated craft which
fell apart and sank suddenly.

A few days later, a kindly old
lady met the boat owner and mis-
took him for the brother whose wife
had died; “Oh, Mr. Jones,” said she,
“I’m so sorry to hear of your loss.”

He, thinking she meant the boat
of course, said: “Loss? Forget it. I
should_have put the axe to that old
tub long ago; she belonged in the
bottom of the ocean. Smelly thing,
full of ﬁsh odors, I could hardly
stand it lately. Tried to sell her but
who would have her? Even that
thick paint job cou1dn’t hide the
fact that she was all chewed up.
Finally I couldn’t handle her; I
rented her to some guys looking for
a good time; but there were too
many of them, and suddenly she
just cracked up and fell apart-
Hey, somebody, quick! This old
lady’s fainted!”

Faculty adviser: “Let’s not have
any more jokes about sex, drink-
ing, and profanity.”

Editor: “O.K., I’m tired of putting
out this magazine anyhow.”

A CHEMICAL HEADLINE MAKER
OFFERS CAREERS WITH A FUTURE

When the editors of the nation’s business press
devote cover stories to a company, it’s a good
sign that the company is setting a fast pace in
today’s competitive world. By branching off
into new ﬁelds of creative chemistry, by build-
ing its sales from $7,000,000 in 1913 to more
than $226,000,000 in 1955, Hercules Powder
Company was one of the big stories of 1955.
With an investment of more than $28,000,000

going into new plant facilities this year alone
Hercules will continue to be a growth leader in
the years ahead. This is the type of company in
which ability ﬁnds its opportunity for advance-
ment; where a young- man can grow into the
type of job he will ﬁnd most rewarding. Why
not ﬁnd out more about careers with Hercules
from your placement oﬂicer? Or write direct to

WHY Ductile Cast Iron is different:
In conventional cast iron (left) the
graphite is in ﬂake form, making for
brittleness. In Ductile Cast Iron (right)
it’s formed into tiny spheres — this
makes for toughness, plus greater
strength. (Magniﬁed 100 times.)

 

HOW Ductile Cast Iron can be twisted
and bent without breaking is shown
above.

 

TODAY, Ductile Cast Iron is a material
of many varied uses. Everything from
pinking shears to plowshares—washing
machine gears to jet plane parts! And
industry is rapidly expanding its uses
of this economical cast material.

An lnco development, Ductile Cast
Iron is a new material that combines
the best features of cast iron and
steel.

Like cast iron, Ductile Iron has
good ﬂuidity. It’s easy to cast. It
machines well.

Like steel, Ductile Iron is strong
(the picture at left proves it). Its
ductility is outstanding.

With Ductile Iron, industry is cut-
ting costs on materials, production,
maintenance. Write for “Ductile
Iron, the Cast Iron that Can Be
Bent.” This booklet will be helpful
to you in your engineering courses
and also later on, when you face
problems as a practicing engineer.

THIS is the new Administration Building
which is the focal point of the Allison engi-
neering Research and Development Center
in Indianapolis.

The Allison expansion and development
program in engineering represents an ex-
penditure of $75 million and includes
the newest and ﬁnest facilities for the de-
velopment of new, high performance turbo-
prop and turbo-jet engines.

Our engineers are working with the best
“tools” available. For instance, the fuels
system laboratory, which is just one part
of the overall expansion and building pro-
gram, represents the scope of the center.
The amount of fuel that must be supplied
to jet engines can be compared to the
amount of water ﬂowing through a regu-
lation size ﬁre hose, and at the rate the
average ﬁre hose puts out water to ex-

tinguish a ﬁre. Should all test cells in the
Allison Laboratory be operating at the
same time, they would be pumping fuel at
a rate that would empty 45 railroad tank
cars per hour.

Other facilities include chambers, cells,
equipment and devices for testing engines
at higher altitudes and faster speeds. And,
newest research and development facilities
for testing components—such as compres-
sors, turbines and combustors—will make
the Allison Research and Development
Center one of the most complete in the
world.

Want to know where you’ll ﬁt into the
future at Allison? Arrange now for an
early interview with our representative on
YOUR campus. Or, send for information
about the possibilities of YOUR engineer-
ing career at Allison.

None of the exciting technical promises for the future can come true without
parallel developments in many ﬁelds. And the ﬁeld ofspecial steels is especially
important—for almost everything that’s made is either made of or made by

a special steel.

Crucible is the nation’s foremost producer of special steels, including tool
and high speed, alloy and stainless, magnet and spring, and many, many others.
Also, through its affiliates, Crucible produces titanium products and vacuum-
melted alloys—products whose modern applications have only scratched the

surface.

Crucible is a fully-integrated com-
pany, owning its own sources of coal
and ore, river transportation and pro-
duction equipment—as well as one of
the ﬁnest national distribution systems
in the industry.

A career at Crucible is a challenge.
May we talk it over with you.
