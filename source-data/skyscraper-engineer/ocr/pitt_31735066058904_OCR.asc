Biggest thirst in the universe

Each 6,000,000 pound thrust rocket ship now being planned for manned
interplanetary exploration will gulp as much propellant as the entire capac-
ity of a 170 passenger DC-8 Jetliner in less than 4 seconds! it will consume
1,140 tons in the rocket's approximately 2 minutes of burning time. Required
to carry this vast quantity of propellant will be tanks tall as 8 story buildings,
strong enough to withstand tremendous G forces, yet of minimum weight.
Douglas is especially qualified to build giant-sized space ships of this type
because of familiarity with every structural and environmental problem
involved. This has been gained through 18 years of experience in producing
missile and space systems. We are seeking qualified engineers and scien-
tists to aid us in these and other projects. Write to C. C. LaVene, Box l-600,

BY HOWARD WESOKY, AE ’6Z

One of the greatest engineering accomplishments
of this century is the St. Lawrence Seaway-Great Lakes
Navigation system. To realize the importance of this
huge undertaking of the U. S. and Canada, it is neces-
sary to understand the geography, economy, and in-
dustrial importance of the region served‘ by the water-
way.

The Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin com-
prises the provinces of Ontario and Quebec in Canada
and the 17 states of the U. S. which are economically
contiguous to the Great Lakes, or roughly the entire
upper mid-continental area of the United States and
Canada extending from the Appalachians to the Rockies.
Within this area live one-third of the population of
both countries. The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence
River comprise a drainage area of 300,000 square miles.
The water surface has an area of 95,000" square miles
and a shoreline of 8300 miles. Concentrated around the
shores of the Great Lakes are steel mills, factoris, rail-
road terminals, mines, ports, and large cities which
constitute the greatest industrial complex in the western

hemisphere. Inland transportation on the Great Lakes
has been unparalleled, with this waterway carrying 25%
of the waterborne commerce of the U. S. Total U. S.
traffic on the Great Lakes has averaged 227,000,000
tons annually.

For more than 100 years, Canada has been operat-
ing a series of canals and locks which by-passed the
various rapids of the St. Lawrence between Montreal
and Lake Ontario. At the turn of the century the locks
and channels were deepened to 14 feet, so for the past
50 years a series of 6 canals containing 22 locks have
carried traffic past the rapids. This system faciliated
limited naviation of specially constructed ocean going
vessels up to about 4000 tons displacement.

However, the desire for lower transportation costs
to carry the manufactured products, grain and other
commodities produced in the rich and productive hin-
terland area of the Great Lakes and to bring to the
area essential import items of raw materials, plus the
discovery of rich iron ore deposits in the Labrador and
Quebec Provinces of Canada, demanded the moderni-
zation of the St. Lawrence. A steady increase in the
volume of traffic carried by the Canadian canal system
which had been approaching its rated capacity of 10
million tons annually created an urgent and persistent
demand for a new Seaway of modern proportions to
handle the increased traffic which was inevitable with

the bursting economy of the North American neigh-
bors.

In September, 1954 the Seaway Development Corp-
oration selected the Corps of Engineers as the design
and contracting agent of the Seaway facilities. For the
combined seaway and power projects there was a total
of 635 contracts awarded. The term “Greatest Construc-
tion Show on Earth” has frequently been used to de-
scribe the immensity of this undertaking. The cost of
:more than a billion dollars -— $600 million for hydro-
electric development and $450 million for the seaway
— is quite impressive in itself.

The Corps of Engineers mobilized and deployed
one of the largest and most varied fleets of dredging
equipment ever assembled. Canyons were cut through
earth and rock. Whole villages were moved to make
way for a new lake. Great bridges were raised while
traffic over them was hardly disturbed. Raging rapids
were pumped dry and mountains of muck and glacial
fill were dredged. In some case the rock was so hard
it would take the teeth off a power shovel every 18
hours. At the other extreme was the “bluegoop”,
a greasy clay that sometimes contained almost as much
water as solid substance. It sloshed out of dredge buckets
and oozed through truck bodies. Exposed to the sun,
it turned rubbery or even brittle, until a shower changed
it back to a liquid again. Technically, it was called
“sensitive”, but workmen had other names for it, all
unprintable.

One of the worst enemies of the builders was winter.
Bitter temperatures made metal objects burn to the
touch. Workers’ hands, when not properly protected
froze to tools and vehicles. Drivers had to free tractor

treads with blow torches. Earth and gravel shoveled into
truck beds froze hard to the steel and wouldn’t dump
out; concrete tended to freeze before it set, and ice jams
were a constant threat to the completion schedule. But
all these difficulties were met and overcome by the
builders.

For Canada, the Seaway work began at Montreal.
From a point about two miles below the Jacques Car-
tier bridge and extending upstream 12 miles in the river
bed along the easterly and southerly shores of the river
for a total distance of 18 miles, there has been con-
structed a channel 300. feet wide, containing two locks
and two turning basins and finally terminating in the
east end of Lake St. Louis. This accomplishes the by-pass
of the Lachine Rapids and overcomes a slope in the river
surface of 50 feet. The project continued further up-
stream at a point near the west end of Lake St. Louis.
A 2-mile channel has been constructed through solid
rock between Lake St. Louis and the Beaharnois. power
plant to overcome the 82-foot difference in elevation of
Lakes St. Francis and St. Louis. This by-pass channel
contains two locks. To bring the channel to St. Regis
Island, opposite Cornwall, Ontario, it was necessary to
dredge through the shallow areas in Lake St. Francis.
From this point future sailings will be made by means of
the south channel of the St. Lawrence and into the U. S.
Snell Lock at the lower end of the International Rapids

section.
Farther upstream is the next Canadian facility at

Iroquois, Ontario, where a channel about one mile long
has been built on the Canadian side of the river to by-
pass the Iroquois control dam, a power structure, the
purpose of which is to control the level of the upper St.

Lawrence and Lake Ontario. The Iroquois lock oper-
ates with differential elevations of from zero to six feet.

The Thousand Island Section of the river extends
upstream from the cities of Ogdensburg, N. Y., and Pres-
cott, Ontario, a distance of 68 miles to Lake Ontario.
Seaway work in this area consisted of the removal of
scattered rock shoals. The position of the International
Boundry Line determined the allocation of work re-
sponsibility, the upper 46 miles of river being in the
United States, and the downstream third being in Cana-
da. The remaining portion of Canadian work consisted
of deepening to 27 feet the 28 mile Welland Canal be-
tween Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. The work here in-
cluded dredging to deepen the -approaches to the canal
in both lakes.

The design and arrangement of the navigation
facilities in the International Rapids were controlled by
the arrangement of the structures associated with power
development. These facilities occur at Barnhart Island,
a U. S. island located at the very bottom of the Inter-
national Rapids section and a short distance below the
once spectacular Long Sault Rapids, which have dis-
appeared forever. An international powerhouse, the
Moses-Saunders Power Dam, has been constructed at
the downstream end of Barnhart Island to straddle the
International Boundry Line and cross the channel which
passes north of the island. A second and companion
structure is the Long Sault spillway dam, constructed at

the west end of Barnhart Island across the south channel ‘

of the river. These two structures, together with a series
of dikes 21 miles in extent impound the waters of the
river to create the forebay power pool, named Lake St.
Lawrence, which is four and one-half miles wide at its
widest part and extends 28 miles upstream to the control
dam and has an area of 38,000 acres.

The principle United States Seaway undertaking is
loc-ated in this area and consists of a lateral channel, 10
miles in length, situated so as to by-pass the power struc-

14

tures and enter the power pool near its downstream end.
This channel, known as the Wiley-Dondero Ship Chan-
nel, has a bottom width of 442 feet, and contains the
two U. S. Locks. ‘Like the Canadian locks of the new sea-
way, these U. S. locks, the Eisenhower and Snell, are
founded upon bedrock, and are 860. feet lon-g, gate to
gate, and 80 feet wide, with 30 foot depth over the miter
sills, having a usable length for ships of 768 feet. These
dimensions were patterned after the locks in the
Welland Ship Canal. Thus the new Seaway will consist
of four modern lateral channels containing 7 locks, as
compared to the six narrow by-pass channels containing
22 small locks which comprised the 14-foot canal system.

Many auxiliary projects have been carried out to

allow completion of a modern and efficient seaway.
Extensive bridge construction h=as been required to pro-
vide crossings with a vertical clearance of 120 feet. Two
tunnels for highway traffic have also been incorporated
in the project. One of these tunnels is contained in the
Eisenhower Lock.

With the completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway
most ocean going vessels now can easily make the trip
from the Atlantic Ocean down the St. Lawrence River,
into Lake Ontario, and then through the Welland Canal
into Lake Erie. However, these ocean going vessels
will not be able to pass through the other Great Lakes
and their connecting channels.

Although the lakes are deep, the connecting rivers
had shallow reaches in their original state and over the
years it was necessary to dredge the river channel to

_provide adequate depths to accomodate deep-draft lake
vessels. In addition, the St. Mary’s Falls in the St. Mary’s
River at Sault Ste. Marie were impassable and locks
were required to overcome the drop at the falls to permit
vessels to pass between Lakes Superior and Huron. At
the present time controlling depths of 25 feet in down-
bound channels and 21 in upbound channels are avail-
able between Lake Superior and the lower lakes. The
deeper depths were provided in the downbound channels
to accomodate deep-draft loaded ore carriers. Only one
of the four locks constructed at Sault Ste. Marie, the
MacArthur Lock, is equal in size to the St. Lawrence
Seaway locks. Congress has authorized construction of
a new modern Poe Lock with a depth over the lower
sill of 32 feet to replace the existing Poe Lock.

Recognizing the inadequacy of the connecting
channels, the United States Congress, upon a study by
the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers, authorized deepen-
ing the connecting channels between Lake Erie and the
upper three lakes to provide channels with a minimum
controlling" depth of 27 feet. The improvement was
found to be fully justified in the interests of Great Lakes
bulk cargo traffic alone, although it was recognized that
the deepened channels would provide commensurate
depths with those provided in the St. Lawrence Seaway.

The project for deepening the connecting Channels
to 27 feet was initiated in May 1957. It is primarily a
large-scale under water excavation job, embracing the

removal of about 64,000,000 cubic yards of earth and
rock. When completed in 1964, this project will have
cost approximaately $146.5 million, but it is estimated
that savings of almost $10 million in three commodities
alone-—iron ore, stone and grain——will be made annually
in transportation costs, H

The need for improvements -at harbors on the Great
Lakes to accomodate the large, deep-draft vessels which
will transit the deeper channels and the Seaway has been
recognized. The Corps of Engineers has been directed to
make a study to determine the advisability of further
improvements of harbors on the Great Lakes in the in-
terest of present and prospective deep-draft commerce.
Once completed, the results of these studies will be re-
ported to Congress for authorization and subsequent ap-
propriation of funds.

When the job is finished in 1964,the St. Lawrence-
Great Lakes navigation system will provide a vital link
in the vast interconnected waterway system of the
United States. Its service to the great industrial complex
of the United States and Canada will more than make
up for the millions spent on this great undertaking, “The
Greatest Construction Show on Earth”. Q

Even the greeks didn’t have a word for it

FEBRUARY 1960

According to legend, a goat tender in ancient Greece noticed
that his animals acted strangely whenever they grazed near a
certain spot in the ﬁeld. When villagers investigated, they be-
came giddy and lightheaded from an invisible “something”
that came up out of the ground.

Since in those days the Greeks considered the weak-rninded
as special favorites of the gods, they erected a temple at the
spot in honor of the invisible magic that made people giddy.
This was the famous Temple of Delphi, and the “something”
for which the Greeks had no word was natural gas.

In the years since then, natural gas has been transformed
from a curiosity to one of the world’s major sources of
energy. Chemists (and alchemists) discovered a little about
the nature of gas, and that it would burn. But it was engi-
neers who perfected ways of controlling it, measuring it,
transporting it, and of putting its energy to work. Our engi-
neers have been a part of this progress. Their skill has helped
make Rockwell—Nordstrom valves, Rockwell gas meters,
regulators, and other measurement and control devices the
most widely used in the gas industry.

Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
lines Rockwell makes for 28 basic industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people
like to work for, buy from, and invest in.

This plastic bubble protects the antenna of a
radically new aerial three-dimensional radar
defense system.

Sensitive to the inadequacies of conventional radar
systems, engineers at Hughes in Fullerton devised
a radar antenna Whose pointing direction is made
sensitive to the frequency of the electromagnetic
energy applied to the antenna. This advanced tech-
nique allows simultaneous detection of range, bear-
ing and altitude. . .With a single antenna.

Hughes engineers combined this radar antenna with
“vest-pocket sized” data processors to co-ordinate
antiaircraft missile ﬁring. These unique data proc-
essing systems provide:

1. Speed——Comp1ex electronic missile ﬁring data was
designed to travel through the system in milli-
seconds, assuring “up-to-date” pinpoint position-
ing of hostile aircraft.

2. Mobility—Hughes engineers “ruggedized” and
miniaturized the system so that it could be mounted
into standard army trucks which could be de-
ployed to meet almost any combat problem—even
in rugged terrain.

3. Reliability - By using digital data transmission
techniques, Hughes engineers have greatly re-
duced any possibility of error.

Result: the most advanced electronics defense
system in operation!

 

Falcon air-to -air guided missiles, shown in an en-
vironmental strato chamber are being developed and
manufactured by Hughes engineers in Tucson, Arizona.

FEBRUARY 1960

   

Reliability of the advanced Hughes systems can be in-
sured only with the equally advanced test equipment
designed by Hughes El Segundo engineers.

Other Hughes projects provide similarly stimulating
outlets for creative talents. Current areas of Re-
search and Development include advanced airborne
electronics systems, advanced data processing
systems, electronic display systems, molecular elec-
tronics, space Vehicles, nuclear electronics, electrolu-
minescence, ballistic missiles...and many more.
Hughes Products, the commercial activity of Hughes,
has assignments open for imaginative engineers to
perform research in semiconductor materials and
electron tubes.

SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF
HARNESSING THE SUN’S ENERGY

WILL PROVIDE A VERY ECONOMICAL

SOURCE OF ENERGY

At the dawn of our civilization, primitive peoples
worshipped the sun as a god and a giver of life. It is
n-ot difficult to understand why they did so, for sunrise
brought forth light and warmth to the earth. The zeal-
ous, primitive sunworshippers could not persuade their
god to bestow his warmth during the cold nights and
overcast days. Paradoxically, modern, non-sunworshipf
ping engineers have succeeded in doing so.

Prime examples demonstrating the success of modern
engineers in using the sun’s heat for warmth during cold
days and nights are the experimental solar houses in
Lexington, Massachusetts, in Boston, Massachusetts,
and in Denver, Colorado. These buildings have proven,
after years of experimentation and study, that solar
heated houses are possible and are economically feasi-
ble in locations where there is ample clear weather and

where fossil fuels are relatively expensive.

In the United States these conditions are met
only in some states in the lower latitudes where the net
solar energy falling on the earth is very high. Miami,
Florida, for example, annually gets enough solar ener-
gy falling on each acre equal to the amount of energy
which would be obtained by burning more than 1000
tons of coal. Hundreds of residents in the southern lati-
tudes are now utilizing just a minute fraction of this
wasted energy by applying the methods proven in the
solar houses and are getting favorable results.

The same method is applied to capture the sun’s
heat in all of the experimental solar houses mentioned.
Recall that sunlight travels in the form of short wave
radiation and that heat radiated from dark, dull sur-
faces travels in the form of longer waves. The sun’s

THE ROOF of this house was designed to fit the requirements of a heat collector.

short wave radiation in the form of light will easily
pass through ordinary glass, while longer waves such
as heat waves will not. This is, in effect, what happens
in a greenhouse; shortwave’ sunlight passes through the
glass enclosure, strikes the darker colored plants inside,
and is reflected as longer wave heat radiation, to which
glass is impervious. The “collector units” of the solar
houses are actually similar to miniature insulated green-
houses, except the heat trapped in these units is carried
away, stored, and released in measured quantities to
keep the interior of the building warm at night and on
cold days.

Although the method used in capturing the sun’s
heat is the same in all cases, the; manner in which the
heat is transferred and stored is different.

Th solar house in Lexington was designed by a
team of scientists and engineers from the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology to use water as the basic
medium of heat transfer and storage. The water is
heated by passing it through a grid of piping fastened
to the underside of dull black aluminum sheets in the
collector units. These sheets pick up the heat from the
unit and transfer it to the circulating water, warming
it to about 150 degrees Farenheit. The hot water is
pumped to a 1500 gallon insulated storage tank in the
basement. The heated water is then released in meas-
ured quantities to a heat exchanger where warmth is
transferred to the air via metal fins. The warmed air
then moves through ducts to all parts of the "building
while the water is recirculated through the system. The
annual bill to keep this system in constant operation
providing comfortable, 72 degree heat and domestic
hot water is only about fifty dolla’rs—much less than
the cost which would have risen from the use of ordin-
ary fossil fuel. Sunshine is free; the only cost is that
required for power to drive the pumps and some auxili-
ary equipment. However, a small oil furnace is present
in the building for emergency use if the bleak, cloudy
days of New England’s winters last more than three days
in succession, for the house was designed with a heat
storage capacity for a maximum three day period.

Unlike the Lexington solar house, the collector
units in the building in Denver heat the air directly.
Cool air from the house is blown into the collector
units and is forced‘ through narrow passageways be-
tween plates of glass. The lower plates of glass in the
units are non-reflective black opaque which serve the
same purpose as the black aluminum sheets in the
Lexington structure. The air is heated as it passes be-
tween these glass plates. Then the warmed air is blown
into the rooms below until they are heated to the de-
sired temperature. When the collector units on the roof
are gathering more heated air than the house needs at
a particular time, the excess is forced into the bottom
of two unique storage towers in the basement. These
towers are fiberboard tubes, 16 feet tall, filled‘ with
small chunks of coarse gravel. The air heats the gravel
as it is blown into the bottom of the tubes and forces
the cold -air out the top and back into the collector
units. This coarse gravel method of storage holds the

thermostat indicates the need for more warmth, a
blower draws stored‘ solar heat. from‘ the bottom of the
storage tubes and out into the rooms until the desired
temperature is reached. As in the Lexington structure,
there is also an auxiliary heater for use when the weath-
er conditions are unfavorable for several days in succes-
sion.

The solar_house in Denver, built by the American
Window Glass Company of Pittsburgh, is unique in
the respect that it is the first American house with a
solar heating unit that does not dictate and distort the
design of the house to suit its needs. In this building,
the solar heating system was not the core around which
the house was constructed. The collector units and stor-
age tubes were factory made and are the type that
could be mass produced for installation in existing
houses, should there be a demand for them in the fu-
ture. The collector units were not designed to be scene-
stealers either, and from a distance have the appearance
of a sun deck. Commercial developers. realize that styl-
ing as well as economics determines the success or fail-
ure of new concepts.

Both buildings described thus far have had to
rely on auxiliary fuel system in case of prolonged un-

favorable weather conditions. This is not the case in
the solar house in Boston, designed by the famous solar
energy scientist, Dr. Maria Telkes. The Telkes house
is entirely self-sufficient; there is no auxiliary fuel sys-
tem. The" heat collector units in this building consist of
dull black steel sheets in insulated enclosures, covered
by double panes of glass. As in the Denver solar house,
the air is heated directly in these units and blown into
the rooms. After the rooms have been warmed to the
desired temperature, the remaining heated air is then
passed through ducts to heat bins where it is circulated
around eans of Glauber’s salt (hydrated sodium sul-
fate). The salt absorbs the heat from the air and stores
it because of its high latent heat of fusion. The Glaub-
er’s salt, stored in five-gallon cans, melts at a tempera-
ture of 90 degrees F arenheit and, in doing so, it ab-
sorbs a large amount of heat which it releases again
when it recrystallizes. Several hundred of these cans
are sandwiched in closets between the walls of the
house. The salt in these cans recrystallizes when the
heat collector is not in operation and the released
latent heat of fusion raises the temperature of the air
passing through the heat bins. The warmed air is then
recirculated throughout the building in the usual way.
This Telkes system of heat storage is capable of keep-
ing the solar house comfortable 95 per cent of the time
during Boston’.s severe winters without the use of -an ad-
ditional heating system.

Ideal as it sounds, the Telkes house has its draw-
backs. One drawback is the cost. The initial cost of con-
struction is prohibitively high. The structure has to be
extremely well insulated and the amount of Glauber’s
salt which is required for satisfactory operation is
twenty tons. Another problem arises from the salt it-
self. There is not enough evidence yet to prove whether
the salt will remain effective over a period of years or
whether it will have to be replaced periodically.

Application of solar heating is definitely not limit-
ed solely to the space heating of houses. Many residents
of the southern states are successfully employing col-

FEBRUARY 1960

lector units of the .type used in the Lexington house as
domestic water heaters. An efficient solar water heater

of this type provides 1.5 gallons of hot water per square
foot of collector surface on each sunny day. Some of
these solar water heaters are installed in the southern
states primarily for the purpose of keeping the water
in private swimming pools at a higher -temperature.
When used in this manner, the units have produced
satisfactory results. In one case a pool in Phoenix, Ari-
zona, equipped with solar heating units kept the pool
water at a temperature of 65 degrees, while neighbor-
ing pools had a water temperature of 50 degrees.

Another noteworthy application of solar heating
is in the field of food cookers. One’ type cooker in par-
ticular that shows much promise is the one developed
by Dr. Maria Telkes, under the auspices of the United
Nations. This stove consists of a tightly insulated box
containing Glauber’s salt. The box is designed with an
inclined glass heat collector in the front with mirrors
fanning out in four directions and with a food drawer
in the rear which serves as the oven. The mirrors in
the front can be adjusted to regulate the temperature
inside. In the rear, food drawer temperatures to 300 de-
grees Farenheit have been reached when the tempera-
ture outside was only 70 degrees. The Glauber’s salt
inside the stove permits the sun’s heat to be used for
cook-ing after the sun has set. The stove is portable,
clean, and requires little attention when in use. If the
cost of this stove can be brought down considerably, to
about five dollars, there is a market in India for about
100 million.

Space heating, hot water supply, water distilling,
absorption refrigeration air .conditioning, and electric
current generation are especially fertile fields for solar
energy use today. One of the principle problems facing
engineers in the field of solar heating today is economy.
It can be seen that the sun’s energy is there for the
taking; it remains for future engineers to determine the
ways in which they can utilize it and make it economi-
cally practical. .

THE HEAT COLLECTORS were not
integrated into the basic design of
this house, but were construgted to
meet the »system’s requirements.

NUCLEAR

FUELS

REFINING OF NUCLEAR FUELS IS

COMPARED TO THE PROCESS OF PICKING

OUT WHITE SPOTS FROM

BLACK PEPPER

BY JOSEPH MATESA, Chem ’6O

URANIUM ORE concentrate is received at the Atomic
Energy Commission's feed materials plant at Weldon
Spring, Missouri.

24

Nuclear reactions are fas-t becoming a great source
of economic power. The inherent energy in a pound of
uranium is equivalent to the chemical energy of three
million pounds of coal. Before this energy can be har-
nessed, however, the atomic fuels necessary to the re-
action must be mined and recovered from the ore.

In its native state, uranium, the major natural
atomic fuel, is found in minute quantities as an oxide
in ores called pitchblende and carnotite. Purifying the
ore is a long and complicated process and it presents
an enormous problem to the engineer. It may be com-
pared -to the process of picking out the white spots from
black pepper.

In the recovery process, the ore ,containing from
0.1 to 0.5% uranyl oxide is taken through a series of six
unit operations until it becomes 75°/o uranyl oxide.
These operations. are: -grinding, leaching, sedimentation,
ion exchange, precipitation and filtration.

The ore is brought to the recovery plant in various
sizes. For proper treatment, it must be reduced to com-
mon particle size by a grinding operation. This opera-
tion is conducted merely by feeding the ore through
a series of grinding wheels. These reduce the ore to the
desired sizes in preparation for the leaching operation.

The leaching operation is performed by passing
sulfuric acid through the bed of ore. The acid removes
impurities in much the same way as hot water removes
the coffee from the ground beans in a perculator. The
remaining ore is converted into salt, uranyl sulfate, by
the action of the acid. The slurry from the leaching op-
eration is then sent to sedimentation tanks where solid
impurities are removed from the tanks and recycled
to the leaching process in order to recover any uranium
oxide that was not reacted previously. Once this is ac-
complished, the liquid from the sedimentation tanks is
sent to the ion exchange column. This stream, contain-
ing the dissolved uranyl sulfate, passes through the
column which is packed with a resin which causes the
uranyl sulfate to adhere to it. Once the resin is satu-
rated with uranyl sulfate, it is washed with nitric acid
and uranyl nitrate is formed and readied for the pre-
cipitation operation.

The precipitation apparatus is essentially a reac-
tor which effects the formation of ammonium diruan-
ate. Here the uranyl nitrate enters the top of the tank
and it is contacted with ammonia gas bubbling up
through -the column of nitrate. The ammonium diuran-
ate forrned, still in the liquid state, is sent to the final
operation of the recfbvery process, filtration.

The object of the filtration process is simply to
separate the ammonium diuranate from solution so it
may be more conveniently handled as a solid. The ap-
paratus used is the common plate and frame filter press
which consists of alternating solid metal plates and
hollow frames. The solid ammonium diuranate clings to
the plates and the clear liquid passes through the frames
for disposal or recovery. The solid ammonium diuran-
ate is then heated to drive off the ammonia and convert
the diuranate to the final product of the recovery pro-

cess, 75 percent uranyl oxide.

Up to this point, the chief concern was to obtain
a uranium compound of reasonably high purity. The
next series of operations is concerned with the separa-
tion of the two isotopes of uranium, U-238 and U-235,
the latter being the fissionable isotype. This process is
by no means a simple one since the concentration of
U-235 in natural uranium is only 0.72 per cent. The
method utilized for this separation. is very complicated
in practice although the underlying principle is rela-
tively b-asic. This principle states that the rate of dif-_
fusion of a gas through an aperture whose cross sec-
tion is small compared to the mean free path of the gas
molecule is inversely proportional to the square root of
its molecular weight. The gas used in the separation of
uranium isotopes is uranium hexafluoride which is
made by a series of chemical reactions starting with the
recovered uranyl oxide. The two isotopes from two dif-
ferent kinds of uranium hexafluoride and the ratio of
the square roots of the two gasses is only 1.0043. Since
this ratio is so close to unity, there is almost no dif-
ference in diffusion rates of the two isotopic gases and
therefore to effect the desired separation, many diffu-
sion cells must be used.

If diffusion is allowed to proceed for a long time
the composition of the gas will become the same on
both sides of the barrier but if only half the gas. in a
cell is allowed to diffuse, then the gas on the down-
stream side of the barrier will be richer in the lighter
isotope——n-ot much but very slightly richer. The half
which does not pass through the barrier is pumped
back to the preceeding stage. Then the richer gas is
sent to another downstream stage where half of it is
diffused through another barrier and -the rest sent back
to the preceeding stage. This process continues until the
uranium hexafluoride composed of U-235 is nearly
completely separated from the other istotpic gas. Ex-
periments have shown that about 4000 diffusion stages
are required to increase the abundance of U-235 from

its normal value to 99 per cent. This is obviously a gi-
gantic operation.

The uranium hexafluoride gas is then converted to
a suitable metal form of uranium by -chemical means and
it is readied for use in an atomic pile.

The cost of producing atomic fuels is one of the
major reasons that nuclear power is not used through-
out the United States today, but other methods of pro-
cessing natural fissionable materials and converting
non-fissionable elements to usable fuels have been de-

veloped and are being exploited and investigated for

more economical atomic power. Further research by

‘our government and industry will eventually insure

feasible nuclear power to increase man’s prosperity and
broaden his horizons. .

The field has never been broader
The challenge has never been greater

Engineers at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft today are concerned
with the development of all forms of ﬂight propulsion
systems—air breathing, rocket, nuclear and other advanced
types for propulsion in space. Many of these systems are so
entirely new in concept that their design and development,
and allied research programs, require technical personnel
not previously associated with the development of aircraft
engines. Where the company was once primarily interested
in graduates with degrees in mechanical and aeronautical
engineering, it now also requires men with degrees in
electrical, chemical, and nuclear engineering, and in physics,
chemistry, and metallurgy.

Included in a wide range of engineering activities open to
technically trained graduates at all levels are these four
basic ﬁelds:

ANALYTICAL ENGINEERING Men engaged in this
activity are concerned with fundamental investigations in
the ﬁelds of science or engineering related to the conception
of new products. They carry out detailed analyses of ad-
vanced ﬂight and space systems and interpret results in
terms of practical design applications. They provide basic
information which is essential in determining the types of
systems that have development potential.

DESIGN ENGINEERING The prime requisite here is an
active interest in the application of aerodynamics, thermo-
dynamics, stress analysis, and principles of machine design
to the creation of new ﬂight propulsion systems. Men en-
gaged in this activity at P&WA establish the speciﬁc per-
formance and structural requirements of the new product
and design it as a complete working mechanism.

EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING Here men supervise
and coordinate fabrication, assembly and laboratory testing
of experimental apparatus, system components, and devel-
opment engines. They devise test rigs and laboratory setups,
specify instrumentation and direct execution of the actual
test programs. Responsibility in this phase of the develop-
ment program also includes analysis of'test data, reporting
of results and recommendations for future effort.

MATERIALS ENGINEERING Men active in this ﬁeld
at P&WA investigate metals, alloys and other materials
under various environmental conditions to determine their
usefulness as applied to advanced ﬂight propulsion systems.
They devise material testing methods and design special
test equipment. They are also responsible for the determina-
tion of new fabrication techniques and causes of failures or
manufacturing difficulties.

equipment developed by Bendix Research Laboratories Division for use in the Bendix program of undersea acoustics research.

Bendix, America’s most diversiﬁed engineering organi-
zation, offers challenging job opportunities in every
area of man’s scientiﬁc and engineering accomplish-
ment——under the sea, on land, in the air and in
outer space!

Take, for example, the urgent problem of defense
against enemy submarines. Bendix—pioneer in sonar
research development, and supplier of this equipment
to our government for many years—was selected to
develop new techniques to increase sonar capabilities.

Another important Bendix anti-submarine device is
“dunked” sonar, lowered from helicopter into the sea
to detect enemy submarines.

The spectacular “TV eye”, which enabled the crew
of the nuclear-powered submarine “Skate” to observe
the underside of the Polar ice pack and locate areas

Princeton, N. J: Today the area around this historic educational center is one of the country's foremost communities of scientific research.

RCA Electronics helps build a new capital of science
at Princeton, N. J.

Explorers once looked for new opportunities beyond
the mountains and the oceans. Today, our frontiers
are somewhere out in space ‘or deep inside the
atom. The modern explorer is the research scientist.
He seeks new ideas, new knowledge.

Research has been an important activity at RCA
ever since it was founded in 1919. And eighteen
years ago many scattered operations were united
in the RCA David Sarnoff Research Center, which
set the pattern for a new capital of industrial re-
search at Princeton, N.  Here, RCA provided
gifted men with fine facilities—and created a cli-

mate in which research thrives. Since then, many
other institutions dedicated to research in a variety
of ﬁelds have been erected in the area.

From RCA’s vision has grown a reservoir of
scientists and research men whose achievements
put electronics into service on an ever-broadening
front, and with such success that RCA means elec-
tronics——whether related to international communi-
cations, to the clearest performance of television in
color or black—and-white, radio and stereophonic
music or to national defense and the electronic

ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE of Hamilton Standard equipment
is reﬂected by the selection of its air conditioning and pressuriz-
ation system for the new Convair 880 jet. Frank G. readily sees
the variety of engineering applications involved and learns that
he would, as an engineer, participate in its development in one of
the following groups:

DESIGN ENGlNEERING—Where the engineer, using technical
skills in aerodynamics, thermodynamics, heat transfer, vibration,

servo mechanisms and electronics, creates a working concept of
the product to meet rigid speciﬁcations of performance, weight,
size, reliability, cost and safety. Engineers shown at right are
discussing stress analysis problems of the turbo compressor rotor
system.

ANALYSIS ENGlNEERlNG—Where the engineer, acting as a

consultant in applied research, derives and evaluates data on
performance, structures, vibration and reliability. In addition,

Frank G. ﬁnds that close liaison is maintained with project and
design engineers, who incorporate this information in the devel-
opment of the product. Such machines as the Philbrick Analog
Computer, shown at right, facilitate compilation of technical data.

PROJECT ENGlNEERlNG—Where the engineer’s prime respon-

sibility is coordinating all activity from design through qualiﬁ-

cation testing. Frank G. discovers this means “shirt sleeve”

work at laboratory test facilities, verifying product speciﬁcations

with analysis and design groups, working with experimental

technicians and contact with customers and vendors. Electronic

THE BIG
DISH

BY DONALD JESSEP, EE ’60

“To him that rideth. upon the heavens of heavens,
which were of old; 10 he doth send out his voice, and
that a mighty voice.”—Ps'alms 68:33

It is strangely curious that words uttered so very
many years ago should come to have such significance
in today’s modern civilization of nucleonics and astro-
nautics. It is even more curious when one considers the
fact that they were spoken by a man to whom space
investigation and travels was a virtual miracle. But
today these words have special significance by the
“personification” of that “voice” in the form,of the
new radio telescope being developed by the United
States Navy at Sugar Grove, West Virginia. This tele-
scope has been designed to be man’s voice in the outer
reaches of space by allowing radio exploration of points
as far removed from the earth as 38 billion light years
or 200 million, million, billion miles, a slightly astrono-
m-ical figure in itself.

The building of this radio telescope, which will
be used to revolutionize the field of radio astronomy,
was begun in 1956 by the Navy. The Naval Research
Labs and the Bureau of Yards and Docks of the Navy
developed the technical specifications and the Bureau
of Yards and Docks was made responsible for the
engineering construction of th-is telescope, or “Big Dish”,
as it is called. Before the inception of construction,
however, the several aspects of the project were checked
by several firms for feasibility. These firms included the
architectural-engineering firms of Frank Grad and
Sons of New Jersey; Urbahn, Brayton, and Burrows of
New York; and Seelye, Stevenson, Value and Knecht,
also of New York. In addition, the project enlisted the
services of the Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus,
Ohio, as consultants. The project was begun in Sep-
tember, 1956. Feasibility studies were made from pre-
liminary designs developed in sufficient detail to permit
the comparasion of various erection schemes, methods
of control and movement, and the total cost. It was
as a result of this preliminary work that a two wheel

32

non-flotation design was selected. The contractors also
recommended an alt-azimuth mount, with independent
support and independent motions for altitude and azi-
muth movements of the antenna.

The center-mounted, finger-like antenna is the
radio center, while the dish itself is only a reflector. The
area of the dish is equivalent to the combined areas of
six football fields and has a diameter of 600 feet. This
600 foot diameter far surpasses the known diameters
of any other like telescopes, such as the Jodrell Bank,
England, which has a 250 foot diameter; the Naval Re.
search Lab’s telescopes in Washington, D.C., which
have diameters of 50, 60, and 84 feet; the National Sci-
ence Foundation telescopes at Greenbank, West Vir-
ginia, which have diameters of 85 and 140 feet; or the
85 foot diameter telescopes under the sponsorship of
the Office of Naval Research at the University of
Michigan. Indeed, the extreme size of the dish presented
previously unencounterd problems in engineering, in
that the area (an area of 7 acres) of the dish could
conceivably be exposed to extreme and severe weather
conditions of hurricanes, heavy snows, ice, and extreme
temperatures. The possibilities of extended deflection
due to these factors brought about the development of
a form of configuration control to support the dish in
its true desired shape of a parabola. This was done by
supporting the dish in a very special way. The reflector
is constructed of panels of expanded aluminum mesh
supported by aluminum purlins. Now to be able to
completely control the shape of the dish, the panels are
supported at the corners by reversible screw jacks, which
automatically adjust to compensate for deflection. An
indication of the actual weather expectations used in
the design of this correction system for the dish reflec-
tor may be evidenced in the preliminary technical
specifications of operating conditions of:

1. Wind at 20 mph and ice at 2% psf.

2. Wind at 30 mph and no ice.

And, as non-operating conditions:

1. Wind at 50 mph and ice at 5 psf.

2. Wind at 90 mph and no ice.

All wind loads were allowed a 50% gust factor on any
10% of the total exposed area.

The construction of the superstructure to provide
the necessary structural framework to support the an-
tenna system was the next major problem. This also
had to form a bracing system to withstand a maximum
horizontal ‘wind shearing force of some 12,700,000
pounds through the structure with a minimum of lateral
displacement. The problem of providing an adequate
structural frame gave rise to the consideration of several
methods; a one-way truss, a two-way truss, a radial
truss, a ring girder, or a space frame. The two-way truss
method won on the basis of better stiffness of support
and a better distribution of load. To secure the proper
bracing system, a V-shaped fixed portal attached to the
large altitude wheels at the plane of the bottom chord
of the superstructure was employed (The altitude wheels
are large wheels attached to the sides of the dish and are
of 190 feet radius and constructed from two dual-web

box girders supporting two rectangular steel billets). The
actual steel used in the superstructure is of structural
steel, shop welded. The transfer of stresses at joints and
wieldmentsis through heavy gusset plates reinforced by
diaphrams and stiffeners. Field connections for thesteel
elements were made by ‘using high strength bolts. Allow-
able stresses of design and detailing were done in com-

plete accordance with the present specifications of the

AISC, ‘except the non-operating allowable stresses, de-
termined, as follows: .
1. For members» governed by flexure of axial ten-
sion, 80 °/a of the material yield strength.)

2. For r_nembers governed by axial compression V

where the elastic stability does not govern, 75%
of the yield strength of the material.

,3. For members governed by elastic stability, 70°’/a .

of the critical strength. ,
4. For’ stresses of sheer, ‘bearing,"etc., the AISC

_ specifications were used. if T ,
An interesting sidelight, to the superstructure con-

struction of.-the telescope was the elimination of redun-
'-dant members. For the highly -intricate truss supporting
‘system, as many as 13:major members met at a single

joint. As‘ necessarily expected this led .to many redun-

dant‘ members. An adequate solution was obtained
by feeding the problem to an IBM 704 computer, which

quite successfully handledvthe job. It has been estimated
that this was the most complex task achieved to date

‘with the IBM computer!

  Several electrical systems" were utilized in the de-

_ sign. of the motion mechanisms of the telescope. The

‘altitude and azimuth drives are powered by induction
motors, a set of. two eddy-current clutches, andva gear

‘box. The driving‘ torque is controlled by varying the

exciting currentfo-f the two eddy-current clutches, which
are set to oppose each other so as to eliminate backlash.

   The overall gear reduction for the gear system is 516: 1.

‘The. control of the signal to the two drive systems is re-

ceived from , what * is called the Input Command Con-‘

verter (a system of digital equipment), which’co‘nverTts
the coordinates from“sid,e__real to altitude-azimuth co-
ordinates. The term “sidereal”- is applied to the coordi-

nates which are measured by theiapparent motion of V

the fixed stars. The control of the telescope axis in the
altitude-azimuth coordinates is accomplished by “gyro-

scopes in what is called the Inertial Reference System. ‘

In addition to the technical problems already men-
tioned in previous sections, several other outstanding
problems presented themselves. The determination of
the finished grade elevation of the main site was a huge
problem. Load tests up to 360 tons (10 tons psf) were
used to insure adequate bearing for the foundations.
Next, an analysis of the structure had to be made for
maximum strength and minimum weight. The lowest na-
tural frequency affecting the surface of the antenna had
to be determined, along with any discontinuities in elec-
trical contact across its dish-like, reflector surface. The
design of joints and wields had to be checked for ade-
quate distribution of shearing stresses. The altitude
wheels had to be checked for stresses. Wind studies of

FEBRUARY 1950

scale models of the antenna panels had to be made to
find drag factors, gust intensities, and gust distribution.
The erection of the structural steel and aluminum panels
was also a problem, the solution of which was possible
only at two movable towers, 90 feet square and 420
feet high, ‘which supported 200 feet boom-length cranes
to reach all points on the structure. The drive systems
for the telescope motion mechanisms had to be de-
signed, for moving maximum loads. And, finally, the

,-selection. of the site posed a very overwhelming fac-
V tor in the construction -of the telescope. The site had
to be free of hurricanes, heavy snows, ice, earthquakes,

extreme temperatures, and outside radio interference
(For this the West Virginia legislature had to pass a
special bill almost prohibiting the establishment of new
businesses within a two-mile area, because of the inter-
ference of motors, neon lights, TV sets, and other elec-
trical deviccs.).

The completion of the 400 million pound, 79 mil-
lion dollar telescope is anticipated sometime in 1962 and
will begin its methodical explorations then. It is expected
that the antenna will have an altitude rotation from
horizon to zenith, and the entire structure rotates up to
450 degrees in a horizontal plane. This should allow ade-
quate facilities for investigation of the farthest-most
reaches of outer space. And, it is also thought that the
telescope should be of some use in a system of special
radio communication by bouncing messages off the
moon. But, to surpass all other uses, it will be an invalu-
able instrument in keeping track of rockets in space.
This should prove itsworth if only as a method of de-
fense for the country. What other uses this machine may
have are limited only by the imagination of the de-
signers and the minds of the future engineers and
scientists who use it. .

THE RADIO TELESCOPE being built in West Virginia
has an equivalent area of six football fields.

Inertial Guidance

A HAND THROUGH THE HEAVENS

BY JAMES DUANE, AE to

At a time when the Russians are undoubtedly fur-
ther advanced than the United States in space technolo-
gy, only a geared up program for rocket development
will permit the Free World to overtake Communism in
this all-important field.

One of the most important and most difficult
problems which the scientists must face in this develop-
ment program is the contrivance of a complete guidance
control system which will operate in outer space to pilot

the rocket to its destination. Since many years of experi-
mentation with unmanned flight are inevitable before
humans will penerate outer space, the most important
means of rocket guidance will be the inertial guidance
system assisted by radio controlled cut-off and staging.

The basic principles of inertial navigation have
been known for many years. In fact, the physical laws

34

were formulated in the time of Galileo and Newton.
Only recently, however, the development of high-speed
aircraft, missles and rockets has rendered conventional
methods of guidance insufficient. This development has
prompted the perfectioniof the inertial guidance system
to make it a practical and reliable method of navigation.

The inertial guidance system is a measuring in-
strument completely self-controlled within a rocket,
which provides instantaneous and continuous accelera-
tion data. It is a mechanism applying Newton’s second
law of motion which states that force is equal to the
time rate of change of momentum. While position and
velocity are not directly detected without reference to
external information, it is apparent from Newton’s sec-
ond law that acceleration is directly detectabTe. If a
mass is suspended in such a way that it will be deflected

by any force acting on it, a restoring force arises to
counteract this deflection. This restoring force can be
used as a measure of the acceleration.

If the initial position and velocity of the missile are
known, position and velocity at any later time can be
computed by detecting all acceleration and performing
an intergation with respect to the time over which the
acceleration took place. This operation would indicate
the velocity and, a second integration, on the result of
the first would produce the position.

To measure the acceleration of the missile or rocket
an accelerometer is employed which produces and de-
tects the acceleration signal. There is one special type
of reaction accelerometer called the unbalanced gyro
accelerometer which -gives effective results while the
rocket is traveling at high velocities. This instrument. em-
ploys an unbalanced weight to produce a torque about

i its own input axis when disturbed by any external

forces. This torque which is proportional to the accelera-
tion of the rocket, will in turn produce a precession rate
about the output axis of the accelerometer which is also
proportional to the acceleration of the rocket. This time,
however, it is in the measuring direction.

If two accelerometers are arranged with their out-
put axis, or measuring directions, perpendicular with
each other, they could measure any arbitrary accelera-
tion in the plane defined by the two axes. We can con-
sider the plane as an x and coordinate plane where one
accelerometer will measure the x component and the
other will measure the y component of the acceleration.
Then these two accelerometers can be termed the ab-
scissa accelerometer and the ordinate accelerometer, re-
spectively.

It is apparent that the accelerometers must be
completely stable about all axes if they are -to be ac-
curate. If the accelerometers are misaligned with the
reference to the actual x or y axes, an acceleration in

launching positions.

the x direction which should produce a reading only on
the abscissa accelerometer would also produce a reading
on the ordinate accelerometer,«which would be in error.
That is, the x component of the acceleration would be
less than its actual value and the y component of the

acceleration would have a reading which would not ac-

tually exist. When integrating this signal there would be
an error in both the velocity and the position in both
directions.

It is also necessary to prevent the plane of the
accelerometers from tilting about its horizontal axis,
because there is no way for the accelerometers to detect
the difference between the acceleration of the missile
and the effect of -gravity. If the platform on which the
accelerometers are mounted tilts a slight degree about
its horizontal axis, the effect of gravity may subtract or
add to the acceleration measured by the abscissa and
ordinate accelerometers, and produce an error in the
measured acceleration.

The accelerometer platform can be stabilized by
mounting the platform in a gimbal system and providing
gyroscopes which have the property of maintaining a
fixed direction in space. One possible arrangement uses
three gyroscopes which provide stability in each of the
three axes of rotation. Any external force which causes
the platform to be disturbed from its neutral space
fixed position, will be opposed by the gyro which will
precess about its free axis. The an-gle of precession can
be used as a signal to counteract the torque by energizing
servo motors in the gimbal system.

Gyro stabilizers require servo motors and associated
electrical servo loops to support their gyros and maintain
their position. The servo loop operates in this way: A

35

gyro transforms any torque about its stabilizing axis in
an angular velocity about its precession axis. A pick-up
on this axis gives an output proportional to the preces-
sion angle. This pickup thus delivers an integrated value
which lags the torque output. This output, through cor-
recting networks and amplifiers, controls a servo motor
on the stabilizing axis to compensate for the original dis-
turbance in the torque.

The accelerometer develops an output signal on its
output axis which is proportional to the acceleration of
the missile. This signal which is in the form of an angu-
lar movement of the output axis, is converted directly
to a voltage signal by a potentiometer. This voltage sig-
nal is sent to the computer by a synchro-transmitter to
a synchro-receiver. By amplifying this signal, it can be
used to drive the motor of a ball and disc computer. This
type of integrator-computer gives excellent results when
used in conjunction with the gyro-stabilized accelero-
meter. The computer determines the velocity by the first
integration, and the position by a second integration of

the acceleration signal.

The whole process of detecting, transmitting, ampli-
fying and integrating the acceleration signal is instan-
taneous and continues, thus providing continuous
control of the missile. The final results of this process,
instantaneous measure of velocity and position are com-
pared with predetermined velocities and distances in the
computer. In this way every tiny difference is immediate-
ly detected and analyzed, and the controls automatically
shift the rocket back on course.

The differences between the precalculated flight
and the instantaneous measured flight are sent through
an electrical network to the control center in much the
same manner as is the acceleration signal. The control
system then uses this signal to actuate the engine thrust
or the control surfaces of the missile to place it back
upon the prescribed course.

This system of navigation seems so simple in basic
principle that one may wonder why it had not been used
much earlier. The answer to this question may be sum-
marized as follows. Other navigational methods give
useful answers with moderately precise instruments but
have inherent limitations beyond which further refine-
ments in components no longer help. Inertial navigation,
on the other hand, has no such limitations, but extremely
precise instruments are required before even moderately
acceptable results can be achieved. Only in recent years
has technology advanced to a degree where developing
such instruments became possible. Inertial navigation is
based upon force balancing and measurement operations
which must be carried out with a degree of precision
comparable to that of establishing basic physical stan-
dards in the great physical laboratories. Only when it
became possible, through great advances in technology,
to achieve such precision in the unfavorable environment
of a high-speed projectile, could this accurate and ef-
fective system provide the means for guiding our missiles
to predetermined areas in the vastness of space. .

HE'S WORKING TO GIVE OLD
METALS A NEW FUTURE

The metals now being utilized in thin ﬁlm development have
been known and used for centuries. But dormant within these
metals has been their quality of superconductivity at extremely
low temperatures. Only when researchers were able, with
great ingenuity, to create certain relations between metals
and changes in their basic structures, could these supercon-
ducting qualities be utilized. But much remains to be done
at this moment, especially in the application of thin metallic
ﬁlms to practical working devices.

Development Engineers at IBM are at work daily on the
problem. They envision the replacement of today’s electronic
logic elements with modules of amazing responsiveness, dura-
bility, and simplicity. The‘extremely small size of these modules
and their low power requirements will be important factors
in shaping the electronic systems of the future.

Closely allied on this work are engineers of practically every
specialty. Only by bringing the talents and abilities of people
of many ﬁelds to bear on the unique problems of thin ﬁlm devel-
opment, will progress be consistent with objectives. Engineers
at IBM expect to obtain these objectives, and once they are
obtained, to set new ones.

If you think you might be interested in undertaking such truly
vital and interesting work, you are invited to discuss your
future with IBM.

The word space commonly represents the outer, airless regions of the universe.
But there is quite another kind of “space” close at hand, a kind that will always
challenge the genius of man.

This space can easily be measured. It is the space-dimension of cities and the
distance between them . . . the kind of space found between mainland and olf-
shore oil rig, between a tiny, otherwise inaccessible clearing and its supply
base, between the site of a mountain crash and a waiting ambulance—above all,
Sikorsky is concerned with the precious “spaceway” that currently exists be-
tween all earthbound places. '

Our engineering efforts are directed toward a variety of VTOL and STOL
aircraft conﬁgurations. Among earlier Sikorsky designs are some of the most
versatile airborne vehicles now in existence; on our boards today are the ve-
hicles that can prove to be tomorrow’s most versatile means of transportation.

Here, then, is a space age challenge to be met with the ﬁnest and most practical
engineering talent. Here, perhaps, is the kind of challenge you can meet.

POWDERED CORES

Acting like tiny telephone operators
in space, sub-miniature an-d micro-
miniature filters-, which are used to
transmit and receive information from
missiles, are growing smaller ‘ut
better. These cores are made of molyb-
denum permalloy powder compressed
under high pressures, annealed and
then finished. Pictured is the smallest
(0.260 inches in diameter) and the
largest (5.218 inches in diameter) of
the powdered cores used in electronic

YABO
AND THE

FIIRRY

BY GERALD LE-F F , AE ’62

W hen she first found it, it wasn’t so bad, because it
could easily fit into the palm of her hand. That was six
years ago when Winifred, we call her Yabo, was five
years old. She’s eleven now and the Furry must have its
gniria, before it speels. Don’t you understand? Well, I
guess I’d better explain the whole thing from the be-
ginning.

I’ve already mentioned the fact that Yabo was five
years old when she found the Furry. At first my wife and
I though it might be one of those buckeyes the kids are
always saving and making bracelets and things with, you
know? Well, Yabo came home one day and showed my
wife and me a puppy which she claims, and at the time
we did not believe, the Furry had given her. Yes, that’s
right. This little round fuzz—ball was supposed to have
produced a puppy. Well, I’m an engineer—er, well, I
was an engineer before the Furries came, but, well, let
me finish explaining. I tried to convince Yabo that
furry little shells do not produce animals and asked to
have the Furry produce something. It couldn’t and I
felt confident that I had proved my point. Everything
quieted down after the puppy incident and things went
smoothly for three weeks. Yabo still had the Furry in
her bedroom, but if my imagination wasn’t getting out of
hand, it seemed the Furry was getting bigger.

Christmas was soon -approaching and I knew very
well that I would soon be up to my neck in bills and
loans. We took Yabo downtown to see Santa Claus and
she sat on his lap for five minutes telling him what she
wanted for Christmas. A pony, a life-size doll, a St. Ber-
nard, a canary, a pair of roller skates and a new baby
sister. All -this time, she had that little hairy sphereoid
clutched in her hands. Well, I imagine that you can
guess what happened on Christmas morning. That’s
right. We found room for the pony in the garage, the

bar =é‘

life-size doll slept with Yabo, the St. Bernard watches
the pony, and the canary has found a wonderful home
in the dog’s fur. I musn’t forget to mention the extra
room I began building for the new arrival, which we
expected the following August. Yes, it was a girl.

Yabo started school the following September. By
this time, the Furry had grown another inch larger. It
showed no signs of any limbs. It just rolled and hovered.
As I was saying, Yabo started school and one morning,
I’d say three weeks after the beginning of the term,

.I received a call at work from Yabo’s teacher. She

wanted me to stop at the school during lunch and ex-
plain a few unusual details about Winifred. I ‘reached
the school during the children’s lunch hour and found
Yabo’s teacher standing in the playground—or what
used to be a playground, for it seems that during the
children’s recess hour, they were all playing in the
recreation area, and a number of the children began
complaining about the heat, and wishing they were
swimming at the ocean. No, not quite. The Furry didn’t
actually create an ocean, it just produced an extremely
large pool on the school grounds, beach and all.

I promised the principal and teacher that such an
incident would surely never happen again. Upon reach-
ing our modest ranch house with its variety of heaven
produced animals, I promptly lectured Yabo on her
conduct and the conduct of her baseball friend, who by
this time, was quite in need of a depillatory. She prom-
ised she would refrain from wishing while in school and
would leave the Furry at home. As such, the incident
was forgotten.

After the fourth year, I began wondering why I
didn’t take advantage of the Furry and its wonderful
nature. I began by having a sensible father to daughter
talk with Yabo, but it seems that she didn’t really know
what made it produce gifts. The only thing Yabo had to

I do was wish, and poof, there it was. As I have men-

tioned, I am an engineer and I enjoy probing into the
unknown. Never again! I sat down one evening after
dinner, asked Yabo to project the Furry towards my
armchair. I then proceeded to raise the five-pound Furry
on my lap. I didn’t actually know where to begin look-
ing for eyes or mouth, arms or legs, so I pulled at the fur
and poked it a few times. That’s when it bit me, or I
thought it bit me. I shoved it off my lap and threw my
good pipe rack at it hoping" to knock it senseless, but
it dodged lithely and I watched my good briars settle
hopelessly over the living room floor.

After that incident, I never again tried to assasin-
ate the Furry.

By now everyone on the block knew about the
Furry and its accomplishments. -

It had been four and one half years to the day since

. I we got the Furry that Yabo came home from school and

casually mentioned that a few of the other kids now had
Furries. I closed my eyes and prayed it was a dream.

- Things like this just don’t happen. After regaining my

composure, I politely asked how the children found
their F urries‘and with her big brown eyes, she looked

FEBRUARY 1960

up at me and said “They didn’t find them Daddy, I
wished them on the kids.” I didn’t know quite, how to
take this. Had my angelic little daughter wished to per-
form some evil mischievous stunt or had she meant only
for others to share in our happiness. Ha! Ha! She also
mentioned that these Furries were a little smaller than
her own, but not q-uite as small as when she had found
it.

Carrying out the garbage one day, about three
months after all the neighbors in the block got their
Furries, I chanced to meet an old friend of mine and I
asked him why he never stopped up at the house. He
said he didn’t have the time to talk, but would give me
a call later in the week. As he rushed away, he mumbled
something about a wonderful travelogue his Furry was
projecting. This. was the first of the many incidents
which gave me a slight indication as to what was going
to happen to all the lucky people who owned Furries.

Another three months passed and everyone in the
city through friends, now owned a Furry. Stores began
closing and businessmen began taking longer holidays.
You see, there was no longer any need for Supermarkets
or clothing stores. One only had to describe whatever
article one wanted and poof, there it was.

Someone, no one knows who, is responsible, decided
they would like to take a Furry on a trip. By the end of
the fifth year, half of Europe had as pets, the clear little
animals which produced anything desired. Then quite a
funny thing happened. There was a group of rioters in
London, having a brawl with a political party and a
force of Furries- rolled in to clean it up and clean it up
they did, rioters and all, gone. Since then other incidents
involving crime have been halted by bands‘ of Furries.
It seems they are beings of good will and peaceful means.
I thank my lucky stars the Furry didn’t punish me for
my attempted act of murder, when I threw my pipe
rack at it.

Today is the sixth birthday of the finding of the
first Furry. Nobody knows till this day, where they came
from. We only know that life before they arrived was
miserable and all the people here are very grateful to
the Furries for the kindness they have shown us. It’s
really not much of an inconvienance, only when they
shed, then my room becomes a jungle of hair. I think
the Furries have stopped growing, or at least they are
not growing as rapidly as they first did. My Furry is
now about three or three and a half feet high, and as I
said, he treats us very well. Sometimes, it does get a
little boring, for the Furry doesn’t like us to argue or
fight, but if we’re very quiet, we can get away with it.

I’m very tired now, Doctor, so if you don’t mind,
I’d like to go back to my room. I promised my Furry a
gniria before it speels and if I am late, the Furry gets
very angry. No, thank you, I can find my way back by
myself. It’s all right, for my Furry always waits by my
door till I get there, to make certain that I arrive safely,
because he doesn’t like violence. What’s that? Oh, I’m
sorry, I already told you he doesn’t like violence, didn’t
I? Well, goodbye Doctor. See you tomorrow. .

DEANE KEUCH, one of 136 Dunham-Bush sales

   

engineers, knows the advantages of being associated with a
dynamic young company with extensive product lines.

Following his engineering studies at Purdue, Deane joined
Dunham-Bush as a trainee and soon became an application
engineer. After a relatively short time he was assigned his own

territory, working out of the Cleveland area sales office.

In calling on consulting engineers, architects, plant engineers,
wholesalers, contractors and building owners, Deane (like all
Dunham-Bush sales engineers) ﬁnds it reassuring to be backed by
his area oﬂice and the facilities of Dunham-Bush laboratories.

Equally reassuring is the availability of complete lines. The range

of Dunham-Bush refrigeration products runs from compressors
to complete systems; the range of air conditioning products
extends from motel room conditioners to a hospital’s entire air
conditioning plant. The heating line is equally complete: from a
radiator valve to zone heating control for an entire apartment
housing project. The Dunham-Bush product family even includes
specialized heat transfer products applicable to missile use.

'. . .no fact is so simple that it is not harder to believe than
to doubt at the first presentation. Equally, there is nothing
so mighty or so marvellous that the wonder it evokes does
not tend to diminish in time. Take first the pure and un-
dimmed lustre oi the sky and all that it enshrines: the
stars that roam across its surface, the moon and the sur-
passing splendor of the sunlight. it all these sights were
now displayed to mortal view for the iirst time by a swift
unforeseen revelation, what miracle could be recounted
greater than this 7 What would men before the revelation

truth

have been less prone to conceive as possible? Nothing,
surely. So marvellous would have been that sight--a sight
which no one now, you will admit, thinks worthy of an
upward glance into the luminous regions of the sky. So
has satiety blunted the appetite of our eyes. Desist, there-
fore, from thrusting out reasoning from your mind because
of its disconcerting novelty. Weigh it, rather, with dis-
cerning judgment. Then, if it seems to you true, give in.
If it is false, gird yourself to oppose it."

Reaching into a lost world

 

. . . a hand in things to come

. . . for a plastic you use every day

Massive creatures once sloshed through endless swamps, feeding on
huge ferns, luxuriant rushes and strange p11lp-like trees. After ruling for 100 million
years, the giant animals and plants vanished forever beneath the surface with
Violent upheavals in the earth’s crust. Over a long period, they gradually turned into
great deposits of oil and natural gas. And today, Union Carbide converts these vast
resources into a modern miracle—-the widely-used plastic called polyethylene.

Millions of feet of tough, transparent polyethylene ﬁlm are used each
year to protect the freshness of perishable foods such as fruits and vegetables. Scores
of other useful things are made from polyethylene . . . unbreakable kitchenware, alive
with color . . . bottles that dispense a ﬁne spray with a gentle squeeze . . . electrical
insulation for your television antenna, and even for trans-oceanic telephone cables.

Polyethylene is only one of many plastics and chemicals that Union
Carbide creates from oil and natural gas. By constant research into the basic ele-
ments of nature, the people of Union Carbide bring new and better products into
your everyday life.

. . . as you consider your ﬁrst professional job.
At Melpar, we believe that all young engineers
and scientists should develop the habit of looking
beyond the obvious.

First, what is the obvious? It’s obvious that
you’re in demand. You don’t have to worry about
getting your material wants satisﬁed. And you
don’t have to worry about getting opportunities
for professional growth. Since you are in demand,
you can expect to get the things you want from
any number of potential employers.

But, if you look beyond the obvious, you'll real-
ize now that you’re going to want something more
than “want satisfaction” out of your career.
You’re going to want pride—pride in your per-
sonal, individual contribution.

At Melpar, where we are now working on 120
advanced defense and space exploration projects,
we are interested only in young men who realize
that pride is a reward that extends much beyond
the obvious. Because Melpar is a proud Company.
We're proud of our IMAGINEERING approach
to the solution of electronic problems; we’re proud
of our uninterrupted growth and controlled expan-
sion; we’re proud of the communities that sur-
round our laboratories and plants in Northern
Virginia and Boston, and we're proud of our cre-
ation, design, and production of electronic prod-
ucts destined for universal application.

If you want an opportunity to be proud of your
contribution and your Company, we’re interested
in hearing from you. Tell us about yourself.
Either ask your college’s Placement Director to
arrange a personal interview with the Melpar
representative who will be visiting your campus, or
write to our Professional Employment Supervisor.
Tell him if you would like to hear from one of
your college’s graduates who is now progressing
at Melpar.

Q. Why does your company have train-

ing programs, Mr. Abbott?

A. Tomorrow’s many positions of major
responsibility will necessarily be ﬁlled by
young men who have developed their
potentials early in their careers. General
Electric training programs simply help
speed up this development process.

In addition, training programs provide
graduates with the blocks of broad ex-
perience on which later success in a
specialization can be built.

Furthermore, career opportunities and
interests are brought into sharp focus
after intensive working exposures to
several ﬁelds. General Electric then gains
the valuable contributions of men who
have made early, well-considered deci-
sions on career goals and who are con-
ﬁdently working toward those objectives.

Q. What kinds of technical training pro-
grams does your company conduct?

A. General Electric conducts a number
of training programs. The G-E programs
which attract the great majority of
engineering graduates are Engineering
and Science, Manufacturing, and Tech-
nical Marketing.

Q. How long does the Engineering and
Science Program ‘last?

A. That depends on which of several
avenues you decide to take. Many gradu-
ates complete the training program dur-
ing their first year with General Electric.
Each Program member has three or four
responsible work assignments at one or
more of 61 different plant locations.
Some graduates elect to take the Ad-
vanced Engineering Program, supple-
menting their work assignments with
challenging Company-conducted study
courses which cover the application of
engineering, science, and mathematics to
industrial problems. If the Program mem-
ber has an analytical bent coupled with a
deep interest in mathematics and physics,
he may continue through a second and

third year of the Advanced Engineering
Program.

Then there is the two-year Creative
Engineering Program for those graduates
who have completed their ﬁrst-year
assignments and who are interested in
learning creative techniques for solving
engineering problems.

Another avenue of training for the
qualiﬁed graduate is the Honors Program,
which enables a man to earn his Master’s
degree within three or four semesters at
selected colleges and universities. The
Company pays for his tuition and books,
and his work schedule allows him to earn
75 percent of full salary while he is going
to school. This program is similar to a
research assistantship at a college or
university.

Q. Just how will the Manufacturing
Training Program help prepare me for
a career in manufacturing?

A. The three-year Manufacturing
Program consists of three orientation
assignments and three development
assignments in the areas of manufacturing
engineering, quality control, materials
management, plant engineering, and
manufacturing operations. These assign-
ments provide you with broad, funda-
mental manufacturing knowledge and
with specialized knowledge in your
particular ﬁeld of interest.

The practical, on-the-job experience
offered by this rotational program is sup-
plemented by participation in a manu-
facturing studies curriculum covering
all phases of manufacturing.

Q. What kind of training would I get
on your Technical Marketing Program?

A. The one-year Technical Marketing
Program is conducted for those graduates
who want to use their engineering knowl-

edge in dealing with customers. After
completing orientation assignments in
engineering, manufacturing, and market-
ing, the Program member may specialize
in one of the four marketing areas: appli-
cation engineering, headquarters market-
ing, sales engineering, or installation and
service engineering.

In addition to on-the-job assignments,
related courses of study help the Program
member prepare for early assumption of
major responsibility.

Q. How can I decide which training
program I would like best, Mr. Abbott?

A. Well, selecting a training program is
a decision which you alone can make. You
made a similar decision when you selected
your college major, and now you are
focusing your interests only a little more
sharply. The beauty of training programs
is that they enable you to keep your
career selection relatively broad until you
have examined at ﬁrst hand a number of
specializations.

Furthermore, transfers from one Gen-
eral Electric training program to another
are possible for the Program member
whose interests clearly develop in one
of the other ﬁelds.

Personalized Career Planning
is General Electric’s term for the
selection, placement, and pro-
fessional development of engi-
neers and scientists. If you would
like a Personalized Career Plan-
ning folder which describes in
more detail the Company’s train-
ing programs for technical gradu-
ates, write to Mr. Abbott at Sec-
tion 959-13, General Electric

Westinghouse scientist Robert Sampson analyzes a special photoelastic model under polarized light to calculate

the stresses which would be built up in an atomic reactor component now in the design stage.

If your design must resist severe stress and
shock, the Mechanics Lab can help you

Engineers at Westinghouse can count on the Mechanics
Lab for expert advice and help on problems involving
static or dynamic mechanics. If an engineer’s design
must withstand the shock of a missile blast, or the stress
in an atomic reactor, the men in the Mechanics Lab will
analyze it for him and point out ways to improve it.

This laboratory supplements the work of engineers in
all departments at Westinghouse. Its typical activities
include studies of ﬂow and combustion, heat transfer,
lubrication, stress, and vibration . . . studies aimed at
solving today’s speciﬁc problems, as well as building a
store of knowledge for tomorrow.

The young engineer at Westinghouse isn’t expected to
know all the answers . . . our work is often too advanced
for that. Instead, his abilities and knowledge are backed

up by specialists like those in the Mechanics Laboratory.

If you have ambition and ability, you can have a
rewarding career with Westinghouse. Our broad product
line, decentralized operations, and diversiﬁed technical
assistance provide hundreds of challenging opportunities
for talented engineers.

careers at Du Pont

ON-THE--JOB TECHNICAL TRAINING AT DU PONT

Pictured are a few of the many Du Pont
plants and laboratories across the country
where selected technical students roll up
their sleeves during summer vacation and
put their college training to practical use.

Most of the assignments are similar to
work the employees are likely to do after
graduation. Next summer, for example, a
chemical engineering student may go to
work on a catalyst recovery project. A
mechanical engineering trainee may be-
come engrossed in a challenging hydraulic
study. A promising young chemist may
tackle a problem in organic chemistry.

In short, each man is given a regular
plant or laboratory assignment commen-
surate with his education to date. And, as
with permanent employees, the student’s
training is personalized and tailored to ﬁt
his background and interests . . . even to
the location he prefers, as far as practical.

This program has proved of benefit both
to students and to Du Pont. It gives stu-

dents an opportunity to increase technical
knowledge and to learn how to put college
training to use in industry. It gives
DuPont a chance to observe men who will
soon be graduating in science and engi-
neering. Many of these summer associa-
tions are stepping stones to rewarding
careers with this company.

Juniors, seniors and graduate students
will be given technical assignments. Op-
portunities are in chemical, mechanical,
electrical and metallurgical engineering;
also in physics and mathematics. Candi-
dates should write at once to E. I. du Pont
de Nemours & Co. (Inc.), 2420 Nemours
Building, Wilmington 98, Delaware. Open-
ings are, of course, limited.

There are opportunities also for men
who have completed their freshman and
sophomore years, as laboratory assistants
or vacation relief operators. They should
apply direct to the DuPont plant or
laboratory location of their choice.
