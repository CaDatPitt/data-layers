YOU'LL WANT TO HAVE THESE FACTS ABOUT SANDERS


WHAT IS THERE TO KNOW ABOUT SANDERS
You don't have to spend much time in industry to learn that
Sanders' growth and technical achievements are near models in
the electronics community. Eleven brilliant engineer-founders
(with a contract for $ 17) led the company in 15 years to its
position today-personnel roll exceeds 5,000 at 4 locations;
sales nearly tripled in the last 4 years, and are expected to
double in the next 2 years to a record-breaking $120 million.
YOU'LL THINK HARD AT SANDERS
Obviously, a lot of hard thinking put the remarkable rise in
Sanders' growth curve. As a weapons systems company, Sanders
focuses this thinking on aggressive innovations rather than re-
lying on traditional concepts in order to speed the development-
to-delivery cycle, and to achieve total-mission reliability. As a
technical and business philosophy, this freedom to break with
conventional methods of doing things has fostered a creative
climate where original ideas multiply, professional knowledge
expands and individual advancement is accelerated.
The graduating engineer who seeks a place at the threshold of
state-of-the-art should be aware that Sanders pioneers contin-
uously in advanced areas of radar and phased array, missile
guidance, communications, ASW/oceanography, ECM, tactical
limited warfare, information display and data processing, data
storage, ground support, navigational aids, instruments, test
equipment, microwave and high density packaging.

A PLAN TO HELP YOU KEEP ON GROWING
Most important to your professional development is your asso-
ciation with men who can display technical "firsts." These are
seasoned men who encourage you to similar accomplishment
and who urge you to speak your mind freely. As one Sanders
engineer puts it, "Channels of technical communication are
wide open here."
Another spur to professional development is the liberal pre-paid
tuition program for advanced study at well regarded universities
near all Sanders' plant locations. And, too, a growing number
of top calibre in-plant courses are offered.
WHERE YOU FIND SANDERS ASSOCIATES

T    hank you Dean Hoelscher, Dr. Van Dusen, Dr. Holz-
man, Members of The Faculty, Madam President, students
and seniors of the School of Engineering, it is an honor and
a privilege to be here with you today to celebrate in a Pitt
tradition your successful completion of your undergraduate
work.
   In this day and age for a single human being, with short
hair, to get up before a group and try to impart an idea is
almost unthinkable. It borders on pure lunacy. I should
either have a cape and mask, a pen two-way radio, electric
guitars or some 007 type assistants to pep up the presentation.
   I would like to have your attention because what I have
to say in the next twenty minutes has taken me about
twenty or more years to learn.
  Speaking of getting attention, it seems a red dirt farmer
over in Tennessee was tractor plowing his 160 acre farm one
day. Storm clouds and the end of the day started closing in
and his gas gage had been riding on the "E" for twenty
minutes. Finally the tractor coughed and died. He had no
gasoline in the barn, the closest was twenty miles away.
   His problem occurred so that he was about 100 yards
from his neighbors' barn. His neighbor did not have a
tractor or gasoline but he did have a mule. The mule was
in the barnyard. So our red dirt farmer went to his neigh-
bor's porch and asked if he might borrow the mule to
finish his plowing before it rained.
   His neighbor motioned with his hand "Sure the mule is
out there and the harness is on a nail in the barn."
   The farmer got the harness, fitted the mule and tried to
move the mule from the barnyard but with no success. He
hit him on the rump, pulled on the halter, cursed him, but
finally in desperation, went back to the neighbor's porch
and asked for help.
   The neighbor said sorry about that, you have to first get
his attention. I'll go with you. He picked up a 6' length of
2" x 4" on the way from the house, walked up to the mule
looked the beast square in the eyes and then belted him
over the head with the 2" x 4", so hard that the mule's
knees gave way.
   The neighbor turned to the farmer and said, I believe
you now have his attention.
   No one has ever heard me sing the University of Maine's
Stein Song. I have never appeared on the Broadway
Stage in the role of the president of World Wide Wickets,
Inc. Nevertheless, Dean Turkes has suggested-that I talk to
you today about "How to Succeed in Business Without
Really Trying."
   There have been occasions in the past when I have
neglected to follow Dean Turkes' suggestions, usually to my
subsequent regret. But I'll chance it again. I'm not going
to talk to you about success.


  Not because there is any lack of material. On the contrary,
our brave new world is full of formal philosophies which
purvey success in large economy king-sized packages. We
have human engineering courses which practically promise
to pave your private heaven with streets of gold. There are
patent formulae which are guaranteed to put more success
in your blood than a pound of calves' liver, We have train-
ing in psychology a-go-go which is designed to agitate the
"S" of your success no matter whether you're a master of
science or a three-toed sloth.
   In fact, the atmosphere of the Great Society is perfumed
with the sweet smell of success ad nauseum.
   No, I'm not about to pass out doses of "smart pills" so
that new engineers may turn into instant success. I find it
difficult even to define success. It is a curious phenomenon
which is not always susceptible of static description. You
might say that success is somewhat amoeboid in nature, con-

stantly changing its shape, size, complexity, and motion. In
the mad, mad, mad, mad world of business it is especially
hard to pin down.
   In an academic climate, success is a bit easier to delineate.
You, for example, are successful men. It might be said that
the world, as you know it, is your oyster. However, it
might also be said that the oyster which you are now clutch-
ing still has the shell on it. And it is easier to handle this
way. Soon, however, the shell must be shucked in order to
get at the meat inside. Then the world sometimes gets a
bit more slippery and brings about an agonizing reappraisal
of the shape of things as they are.
   Slippery as it is, today's world presents almost unlimited
opportunities for a certain kind of engineer. I'm not going
to discuss the specifics of available job openings and potential
placements because I'm sure you have guidance more expert
than I could possibly provide. I'm also sure that you will
yourselves be exploring every avenue of opportunity which
is open.
   What I might be able to tell you, in very general terms,
is the kind of engineer business and industry is looking for.
Strange as this may sound, companies are not combing the
campuses for engineers who have mere ability; industry is
searching for engineers who have effective ability. To put
it another way, your IQ is not important, but your EQ is.
Your EQ or effective quotient, is your potential level of
performance resulting from seven different kinds of ability:
   1. Communicatability -     Meaning your ability to ver-
      balize well in both speech and writing, to expound,
      describe, elucidate, interpret, comment, explain, criti-
      cize, persuade, convince, inform, answer, present and
      explicate.
   2. Cooperativeability - Meaning your ability to partici-
      pate, share, promote, collaborate, coadjuvate, assist,
      help, sustain, re-enforce, aid and contribute. As engi-
      neers to become business managers, you should learn
      finance, organization and people.
   3. Innovativability - Meaning your ability to metamor-
      phose, change, discover, introduce, reapproach, diver-
      sify, translate, remold, alter, variegate, transfigure,
      revolutionize, deviate, convert, modify, remodel,
      imagine and transform.
      Said another way, consider alternates; don't become
      emotionally   involved  until you  have    considered
      alternates.
   4. Discernibility -  Meaning your ability to appreciate,
      judge, perceive, discriminate, distinguish, choose,
      anticipate, conceive, visualize, appraise, deduce, assess
      and evaluate.
   5. Administratability - Meaning your ability to execute,
       control, lead, dictate, direct, influence, command,
       master, dominate and administer.
   6. Adaptability -   Meaning your ability to respond, ac-
       commodate, reconcile, exchange, reorganize, regulate,
       rearrange, methodize and adjust.
   7. Amicability -  Meaning your ability to be friendly,
       affable, helpful, sociable, cordial, sympathetic, well-
       disposed, harmonious, tolerant and accessible.


   I'm afraid that my description of these seven desirable
abilities may lead to you to conclude that a newly hired
junior engineer needs to have the combined EQ of Albert
Einstein, The Messiah, Winston Churchill, and Dean
Hoelscher.
   This, of course, is patently not so; it is particularly not
so when a new engineer takes over his first job. Many of
these abilities are latent and, given the right climate and the
proper encouragement, will develop to a significant level.
   However, the first three abilities which I mentioned are
perhaps most immediately important to a young engineer.
He needs to be communicative, cooperative, and innovative.
If his EQ for these characteristics is too negative, his over-all
performance will diminish and may possibly fail.
   Perhaps, I may best illustrate my thesis by reversing my
polarity. Instead of talking to you about "How to Succeed
in Business Without Really Trying," let me try talking
about "How to Fail in Business Without Really Trying." I
know we should approach with a positive attitude but let's
try it from the negative point of view. It's a little different.
   I think it was Carl Sandburg who told a story in point
which concerned Abraham Lincoln:
      The battle of Gettysburg had just been fought.
      Mr. Lincoln sensed an opportunity to end the
      war by driving hard against General Lee's rear
      in retreat, and he ordered: General Meade to
      pursue. Accompanying the orders was a friendly
      note in the President's handwriting. "The order
      I enclose is not of record. If you succeed you
      need not publish the order. If you fail, publish
      it. Then, if you succeed, you will have all
      credit of the movement. If not, I'll take the
      responsibility."
   Since I am not as charitable as President Lincoln, I intend
to suggest to you how to fail, not to win. Then, if you
succeed, some of the credit may reflect on me. If you do
not succeed, you may have the responsibility.
   Here then are the three major suggestions on "How to
Fail in Business Without Really Trying."
   First of all, don't communicate. Don't tell anybody any-
thing you don't have to. You worked hard enough to get
what you know, so why spread it around? Be close-mouthed.
Don't explain anything. This would only rock the boat. So
keep it quiet. Clams can grow fat and happy inside their
little shells; why not you?
   Be especially cautious about writing anything. If you
have to, make it as cryptic as possible. Don't get too specific
in your explication. Don't volunteer any information. If
you can't avoid writing a paper or a report, make it as curt
and obscure as you can so that nobody can comprehend it
or take the time to work out its significance.
   And when you issue a written report, keep the distribu-
tion down. Don't pass it around; that would only lead to
stupid questions. Play it close to your scheming chest.
   Always remember that if you don't communicate, you
can't get involved.


    Here is my second thought on "How to Fail in Business
Without Really Trying." Don't cooperate. You have your
problems, and the other guy has his. So why complicate
your work with somebody else's trouble? You know enough
to get by in your own job, so your efforts don't have to go
any farther.
   If you get assigned to a project with a group, don't take
sides with anybody. Never take a "stand." If you can't
avoid giving an opinion, make it as oracular as possible so
that it can be interpreted by any of the participants as favor-
ing his point of view. Always preface your remarks, oral or
written, with a qualifying statement which can be used to
get you off the hook.
   Never work with anyone to the end that you become
responsible for a positive conclusion. Let it be understood
that you will take the matter under advisement. Do this,
and then forget it. Everyone else will.
   If the need for definite action begins to crowd you, pass
the buck. Usually, some sucker with excess initiative and
enthusiasm will be glad to take over. Let him foul up the
job, not you. Always remember that if you don't cooperate,
you can't get involved.
   My third thought about "How to Fail in Business With-
out Really Trying" is this: Don't innovate. Never experi-
ment with new and untried ideas. It is better to stick with
the good old ways of getting things done. Solid traditional
standards of design, time-proven methods, and a conservative
approach - these have made engineering what it is today.
   Why stick out your neck and maybe get it chopped off
when you have a rampart of heritage to stand behind?
After all, when you come right down to it, what was good
enough for grandpa is still good enough for us. If you ever
expect to lead a sane and simple life, don't question tradition.
   It's easier to work with what you know than to go out
on a limb after some new bird-brained concept. That would
be brinksmanship. You'd be flirting with personal disaster.
Let well enough alone. Stay with the firm, old fashioned,
down-to-earth policies, and you'll be safe. Always remember
that if you don't innovate, you can't get involved.
   Now let me sum up the three simple rules on "How to
Fail in Business Without Really Trying."
   Don't communicate
   Don't cooperate
   Don't innovate
   Follow these tenets, and I can guarantee that you will
never get involved - with success, that is.
   Professor Albert Einstein was once asked if he had
evolved a formula for success as simple and as earth-shakingly
significant as his E = MC2.
   "Success?" He said. "Oh, yes. If "A" is success, I should
say that the formula is A = XYZ2, X being work and Y
being play."
   "And what is Z?" Inquired the interviewer.
   "That," he answered, "is failure. It is a most necessary
factor, but remember that it has to be squared."
   I think that now is a successful time for me to stop
communicating and start squaring. Thank you.

MEET THE CLASS OF '66


They're members of Bethlehem Steel's 1966 Loop Course
-graduates of colleges and universities from coast to coast.
  What is the Loop Course? Since 1922, we have conducted
this course to train college graduates for management ca-
reers at Bethlehem Steel. Hundreds of men at all levels of
management, including our Chairman, started as loopers.
  The '66 Loop convened at our general offices in Bethle-
hem, Pa., early in July. After five weeks of indoctrination,
many of these men were assigned to facilities throughout
the country for further brief training at the operations be-
fore undertaking their first job assignments. Others, such
as sales and accounting trainees, remain at the general
offices for longer periods before being assigned.


  Although our primary need is for engineering and other
technical graduates-such men have many fine opportuni-
ties in all phases of steelmaking, as well as in research,
sales, mining, fabricated steel construction, and shipbuild-
ing-both technical and non-technical graduates are needed
for most of those activities as well as accounting, purchas-
ing, traffic, finance and law, industrial and public relations,
and general services.
  You'll find a great deal more information in our booklet,
"Careers with Bethlehem Steel and the Loop Course." You
can obtain a copy at your Placement Office, or drop a post-
card to Personnel Division, Industrial and Public Relations
Department, Bethlehem, Pa. 18016.

Beginnings of Engineering


Once there was a man who had nothing but a grass hut
and a few simple tools. He hunted and farmed, and in his
leisure time he drew pictures on large stones, carved wood,
and enjoyed feasts and dances which his people held when
times were good.

   The game was not too abundant, but he enjoyed many
days of good hunting. The soil was not too fertile, but he
could raise small amounts of the few crops for his meager
diet. But all this was to change.

   The game became less and less abundant, and the soil
became poorer and poorer, and his people began to have a
dejected and unhealthy look. It was then that the elders
decided that they should contact the elders of the other peo-
ples living nearby to see how they had solved the problems
which the other peoples must also be facing.
   And it happened that the elders of the other peoples were
also at a loss to find ways of solving their problems. After
many meetings, the elders decided to have their peoples
meet, and to work, hunt and farm together, and to make
tools together. As the peoples worked together, they began
to find ways of satisfying their wants and desires through
helping each other. The talents of each became indispensable
to the other.
   But amongst these peoples there were a few who, in
reality contributed far more than their share, even though


their return was insignificant. These were the inventors,
the adapters, and the experimenters. They invented a better
method of making twine from the fibres of the trees which
abounded in the area. They invented a hollow log to carry
water from the river to the Square of the Elders. They in-
vented a cart with round wheels to carry heavy loads from
one place to another. They adapted the twine to make better
weapons to secure food. They adapted the hollow logs
which carried water to help raise the crops in their fields.
They adapted the wheels of the cart to devices which could
lift heavy loads far into the air with a strong twine thrown
over it. The experimenters found the twine could be made
stronger by cooking it in hot bubbling water. The experi-
menters found they could seal leaks in the hollow log which
carried water by placing "animal skins tied tight around it.
The experimenters found they could improve the cart if they
placed animal fat on the logs connecting the wheels.
   And as the inventors invented and the adapters adapted
and the experimenters experimented, the peoples found they
had better weapons to hunt with and better tools to farm
with, and they became happy and healthy looking once
more. The inventors, adapters, and experimenters enabled
the peoples to feel healthy, secure, and prosperous, and many
dances and feasts were held.
   After many seasons the peoples began to realize that the
few who were inventors, adapters, and experimenters did
much good, and they called these few engineers.

SYSTEM


  An intrigiung operation in the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration's Gemini series of orbital space flights
is the rendezvous in space between two vehicles. An un-
manned Agena target vehicle is put into orbit, and the two-
man Gemini spacecraft is launched into an approximately
co-planar orbit with the Agena. The spacecraft then seeks
out the Agena, determines its range and bearing, and makes
the necessary changes in orbital velocity to allow mating with
the Agena.

DIRECTION OF WAVE

   The radar developed to assist in this operation has a num-
ber of distinguishing features made necessary by the space
environment and the unusual operational situation. An in-
terrogator radar is used in the spacecraft to trigger a trans-
ponder in the Agena. This arrangement permits long-range
performance with relatively low transformer power. Also,
even though the absolute velocity of both vehicles is large,
there is no need for rapid closure, but rather, a desire to
bring them into contact at a minimum differential speed,
operating conditions which differ considerably from conven-
tional radar applications for missile or fire-control guidance
where the intercept takes place at high relative speeds and
target radar return is weak.
   When a transponder is used to produce the signal coming
from the target, a 200 to 300 mile range can be obtained
with transmitter power levels so small that most of the
usual signal-aiding techniques are unnecessary.
   In conventional search-track radars, conservation of avail-
able signal power is usually the overriding design considera-
tion; and in most cases, the largest area, narrowest beam
antenna possible is used. Since these narrow antenna beam-
widths will not generally cover the area of possible initial
target location, more hardware such as gimbals and drive
motors is required to move the antenna over an angular


search region to find the target. With an active transponder
on the target, no such complex antenna is required. Wide-
angle, low-gain antennas that require no gimbals can be
used, eliminating the angle search and acquisition problem.
This simplification provides a large weight advantage.
   Another advantage of the transponder system is that the
target signal return will be steady without the wide fluctua-
tions common to radar reflections from a target that has a
complex shape. The signal from the transponder emanates
from a single point, rather than appearing to wander over
the target. Thus, two major sources of potential tracking
error are eliminated.
   Since the target is nonmaneuvering, precision of the ren-
dezvous maneuvers is limited only by the accuracy of guid-
ance sensors and thrust rockets. Fuel of course is highly
critical and depends directly on the accuracy of the guidance
equipment.
   In the Gemini system, digital techniques provide ac-
curacies higher than normally available with analog systems.
Range and angle information is periodically fed in digital
form to the spacecraft computer where guidance calculatio -
can be performed rapidly and the results averaged over many
sets of readings.

                                    But there were so
                                  many things to do, it
                                  was hard to decide. He
                                  could go on to gradu-

social welfare service, or participate in a protest movement

  Many of Jack's friends

they warned.

   And it was a challenge
 Jack wanted - the kind of

                   was a kindly man to whom Jack
              I p opened his heart.
    '.                Mr. Greeley described to Jack the
                   exciting things being done by West-
                I  inghouse all over the world.* Jack was
                   fascinated and asked many searching
                   questions about the world's 21st
                   largest corporation. At the end of an
                   hour, Mr. Greeley advised Jack:
                      "Go Westinghouse, Young Man."
                   Jack did.
                      The first few weeks were difficult.
                   There was so much to learn.
  Jack was to discover that at Westinghouse, learning was
a way of life, that a career with Westinghouse was one
long process of education and re-education.
   Later Jack was permitted to decide which of six big
groups he would like to join. **
Jack selected the Westinghouse
Electric Utility Group.
   With the Electric Utility
Group Jack learned about water
processing, about power genera-
tion, about underground dis-              .       Y
tribution, and many other,
things. Jack had not realized
how important to the survival
of modern man is the world of
electric utilities.
   It was hard work. Sometimes after a particularly trying
day Jack would get discouraged. Then he'd remember the
warn'igs of his friends, back at college. And he'd wonder
wheiher-he had done the right thing.


                         Then came Jill. Pretty, intelli-
                       gent, warmhearted Jill. Jack had
                       met Jill at the drinking fountain
                       in the Utility Group Water Prov-
                       ince Department.
                         Jill was an engineer with West-
                       inghouse (Editor's Note: Women
                       are welcome at Westinghouse, an
                       equal opportunity employer).
                         Although the work became more
                       and more difficult and the hours
                       longer, Jack with Jill at his side
                       persevered.
                         Then came an assignment to join
                       a team of Westinghouse engineers
 and scientists. The team was being sent to an underdevel-
 oped nation in.a faraway land to help rebuild a large
 coastal city.
   Jack and Jill's assignment: Help build a power plant
 that would use nuclear fuel. (Nuclear fuel lasts longer
 than coal or oil. And it's cleaner.) Energy from the nuclear
 plant was used to change salt water from the nearby sea
 into fresh water that the poor people of this country could
 use as drinking water.
   Working late one evening on the job site, Jack caught
 someone in the act of sabotaging
 the construction of an extra-high-
 voltage distribution system. This   /
 system would bring power from the  /
 nuclear plant hundreds of miles /
 into the inland areas of the country. f
   After a dramatic chase through t
 the winding streets of the city, a
 chase in which the international
 police and CIA participated, Jack captured the subver-
 sive agent. A grateful nation presented him with its high-
 est award.
   Finally, the project was completed. It was hard work but
 it was good work. Thanks to the Westinghouse team, mil-
 lions of people would live better.
   The citizens of the country were grateful. They wanted
                       Jack and Jill and the others to stay
                       . . . offered them more than their
                       present salaries as an inducement
                       ... but Westinghouse fringe bene-
                       fits more than offset this offer.
                         At the airport, where a sad but
                      affectionate crowd of citizens
                      gathered to see them off, Jack
                      turned to Jill and asked:
                         "Will you marry me?"
                         Jill smiled and said: "I will if
                      you promise to let me join you on
                      other equally important turnkey
                      projects that Westinghouse is co-
                      ordinating in some of the major
                      cities in the United States."
                        Jack promised, and they lived
                      happily ever after.
                         Moral: Awaiting you at IVesting-
                      house are challenges, hard work, build-
 ing block education, adventure, some travel and,yes, even romance.

              SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS
   The spacecraft interrogator radar transmits a pulsed
signal, radiated over a continuous 70-degree cone. The trans-
ponder, upon receipt of the interrogating pulses, transmits a
reply signal that is both delayed in time and shifted in
frequency. The frequency offset permits the spacecraft re-
ceiver to readily discriminate between the transponder signal
and reflected signals which are at the transmitter frequency.
   The time delay between transponder reception and trans-
mission allows the radar receiver to track the target to essen-
tially zero range. Such close tracking is not possible with
conventional pulse radar because the reflected signal over-
laps the transmitted signal so that it arrives at a time when
the radar is transmitting. Conventional radar cannot both
transmit and receive at the same time. The Gemini trans-
ponder delays the return signal long enough so that it arrives
during the radar's receiving period.
   The interrogator radar, upon receiving the transponder
reply, measures the round-trip time and gives both analog
and digital information of target range.
                ANGLE MEASUREMENTS
   A unique feature of the Gemini rendezvous radar is a
method of angle measurement based on the well-known in-
terferometer principal where the difference in the time of
arrival of the received signal is compared in two antennas.
If the difference in arrival time is equal to 0 (usually ex-
pressed in terms of phase difference in electrical degrees),
and the distance between antennas is d (also expressed in
electrical degrees), then   the  target angle   9   can  be
determined:
                       cos 8 =    /d
The angle e is the angle between the line of sight to the
target and a second line through the center of the two
antennas.
   However, when the distance 0 becomes equal to or
greater than a half wavelength for small angles off boresight,
the same apparent phase delay occurs for several angles.
   In the Gemini radar, this ambiguity problem is avoided
by using close antenna spacing in conjunction with an ex-
tremely linear phase shifter that is an integral part of the
antenna. Linear phase shift is accomplished with antennas
that are circularly polarized. The locus of the voltage vector


at any instant of time along a line in the direction of the
wave front describes a helix. Therefore, rotating the antenna
is equivalent to physically moving the antenna forward
(much like a screw thread). Thus, if antenna polariaztion
is perfectly circular, a linear relation between wave front
phase advance and antenna rotation is obtained, and the
antenna can be rotated to serve as its own phase shifter.
   The circulr polarized antennas are built as Archimedian
spirals, which are printed directly on an epoxy board. Since
the antenna is very light, a direct-drive motor with no gear
train can drive the antenna.
   Angles in two orthogonal axes are measured with three
receiving antennas, one of which is common to both axes.
The antennas are placed on the spacecraft so that their bore-
sight axis is parallel to the vehicle roll axis; one pair of
antennas lies in the pitch plane and the other pair in the
yaw plane. Thus, one pair of antennas establish azimuth
and the other pair elevation. A separate spiral antenna is
used for transmission to avoid the use of a transmit-receive
duplexer.






                    /            ELEVATION MEASUREMENT
                    AZIMUTH MEASUREMENT


   To permit measurement of both azimuth and elevation
angles with a single receiver, the transponder reply pulse is
made long enough to be time-shared between both axes.
The leading edge of the transponder reply pulse is used for
range measurement. Receipt of the leading edge of the pulse
triggers the angle-switching sequence; the receiver input is
switched to monitor the azimuth pair of antennas, and re-
ceiver output is switched to feed the azimuth antenna servo
drive. The switches then open to allow the receiver to clear
and switch to connect the elevation channel.


                 ASTRONAUT DISPLAY
   For the spacecraft there is an optimum deceleration flight
profile between range (R) and range rate (R), which is
limited by the safety margins on thrust capability. That is,
with a specified maximum vehicle deceleration ability, the
range rate between vehicles must start to be decreased far
enough out in range to make it possible to arrive at zero
relative velocity at zero range. This is shown Below
where the forbidden zone is determined by the R = f(R)
relationship, this functional relation being dependent on the
maximum thrust available from the retarding engine. A
safe profile for the Gemini mission was determined to be
one where R =     (R)2. To assist the astronaut both range
and range-rate signals are derived in a semilogarithmic form
and displayed on adjoining meter scales. By keeping the
range-rate needle below the range needle, the astronaut
maintains a safe rate of deceleration.

                    RELATIVE CLOSING VELOCITY (R)-FT/SEC


                    COMMAND LINK
   To allow the astronauts in the Gemini spacecraft to trans-
mit commands to the Agena vehicle, a digital command link
has been added to the rendezvous radar system. Since the
radar is already "talking" to the Agena transponder to
derive radar information, it is relatively simple to impress
binary digital messages on the same transmissions. The
command link and radar share the same transmitter, re-
ceiver, and antenna on each vehicle with only additional
encoding and decoding circuits being added on both ends
for the command link function. This marriage of two
systems gives a sizable weight savings.
                   DESIGN PROBLEMS
    Since this is the first cooperative space rendezvous radar
 to be developed for operational use, it has required the solu-
 tion of a number of new design problems. One of the most
 acute of these has been obtaining the required reliability
 under the launch and orbital environments. Surveys of pre-
 vious radar system failures indicated several classically
 troublesome items such as relays, transmit-receive tubes, and
 connectors. Considering this, the radar design was evolved
 without relays or transmit-receive tubes, and essentially all
 internal connectors were eliminated. The electronic circuitry
 was designed using all-silicon solid state components. Trans-
 mitter and local oscillator microwave tubes are the only tubes
 in the system.
    The real problem in parts reliability is the temperature of
 the part itself. Thus, thermal control of the environment is


of major importance. The restraints imposed on temperature
control by the installation requirements and mission environ-
ment complicated this thermal problem further. The radar
is thermally isolated from the spacecraft and must maintain
its own heat balance using only passive radiation cooling.
The limited area available for this heat radiation was in-
adequate to keep within an upper temperature limit on the
hottest component of 75°C.
   The incident radiation composed of direct solar, earth-
emitted, and earth-reflected energy was computed. Its maxi-
mum, which occurs when the spacecraft is in an earth
oriented orbit coincident with the earth-sun line, placed
stringent requirements both on the radiation surface absorp-
tivity and emissivity and on the thermal drops between the
components and radiation.
   For optimum heat transfer, the radiating surface finish
was required to have the properties of excellent reflectivity
of solar light and to approach a black body in thermal radia-
tion efficiency. A titanium dioxide-pigmented, polyamide-
cured epoxy finish was chosen to satisfy all requirements.
   Several techniques were used to provide the best possible
conduction paths and to simultaneously dump the heat uni-
formly throughout the radiator. Components with high dis-
sipation were mounted directly to the radiating plane.
Dissipation of all components was calculated, the location of
parts being based on watt density with the hotter elements
located closer to the radiator. A silica-filled epoxy was
selected as an encapsulement for most circuits, and foam en-
capsulement was used on a few very low dissipation areas.
Printed boards were assembled to perforated aluminum heat
sinks. Circuits and components were mounted directly to
these heat sinks with their leads extending through the per-
forations into printed circuit boards. The heat sinks then
serve as both structural support elements and heat flow
paths.
    By systematically designing each part installation for
efficient heat transfer, the resulting gradients from compo-
nent to radiator were made sufficiently low to obtain tem-
peratures below the required 750C under conditions of the
hottest orbit.
    Another major design problem was posed by launch
vibration. This was specified as high level random noise
vibration up to 2000 cycles per second. Since most of the
component internal resonances are at several hundred cycles
per second or greater, the supporting structure resonances
were made to lie between 100 to 150 cycles per second. This
is high enough to minimize structulal excursions, and result-
ant structural stress, but low enough to avoid overlap with
component resonant frequencies.
   In summary, the Gemini radar mechanization as a trans-
 ponder-aided pulse radar has made possible a very light-
 weight, simple system with low power demands. Inter-
 feromter tracking, with circularly polarized antennas, has
 minimized angle measuring complexity yet provided angular
 measurement accuracies comparable to larger systems. Incor-
 poration of a two-way digital communications link to the
 radar-transponder system has been accomplished with very
 little additional hardware. Close attention to design details
 has resulted in a highly reliable over-all system.

Finagle's


   Ever since the first scientific experiment, men have been
plagued by the unceasing antagonism of Nature. Only his
patience, adaptability and forbearance have permitted the
scientist to learn a few minor facts about the operation of
the universe.
   We still do not really know why this should be so. It's
only natural that Nature should be logical and neat - but
it isn't, and the best teacher of all, Experience, turns out to
be just the gradual acceptance of Nature's pigheadedness.
   Over the years a series of laws have evolved. The laws
actually represent a distillation of experience of thousands
of experimenters, but (until Dr. Finagle came along) they
were never recorded for the study and edification of younger
members of our profession because they had no derivation
- no proof. They are true because they have always been
true. Look into your own experience and see if this is not so.


Laws


                  ON EXPERIMENTS
   The first four laws are the only ones dignified by number.
Note the beauty and simplicity of the First Law. Also note
that the remaining three laws refer to man's reactions to
Nature - not to Nature itself.
   A further series of rules - or really advice to experi-
menters - has been formulated. They are a natural con-
sequence of the first four laws reduced to day-to-day practice.
FIRST LAW: If anything can go wrong with an experiment,
   it will.
SECOND LAW: No matter what result is anticipated, there
   is always someone willing to fake it.
THIRD LAW: No matter what the result, there is always
   someone eager to misinterpret it.
FOURTH LAW: No matter what occurs, there is always
   someone who believes it happened according to his pet
   theory.
THE LAW OF THE TOO SOLID GOOF: In any collection
   of data, the figure that is most obviously correct -
   beyond all need of checking - is the mistake.
   COROLLARY I - No one whom you ask for help will
      see it, either.
   COROLLARY II - Everyone who stops by with un-
      sought advice will see it immediately.
   Experiments must be reproducible-they should all fail in
the same way.
  First draw your curves - then plot the readings. Experi-
ence is directly proportional to equipment ruined.
   A record of data is useful - it indicates you've been
working.
   To study a subject best, understand it thoroughly before
you start.
   In case of doubt, make it sound convincing.
   Do not believe in miracles - rely on them.
   Always leave room to add an explanation when it doesn't
work (This open door policy is also known as the Rule of
the Way out.)
                   HUMAN FOIBLES
   The remaining rules outline the human problems that
follow from the above. To some extent they represent man's
reaction to Nature and, even more aptly, man's reaction to
man.
LAWS OF REVISION (Often lumped into the Now They
   Tell Us! Law)
FIRST LAW: Information necessitating a change of design
   will be conveyed to the designer after - and only after
   - the plans are complete.
   COROLLARY I - In simple cases, where one obvious
      right way is opposed to one obvious wrong way, it is
      often wiser to choose the wrong way right off. This
      is one step ahead of choosing the right way, which
      turns out to be a wrong way, which has to become a
      right way.


SECOND LAW: The more innocuous the revision appears
   to be at first, the further its influence will extend and
   more plans will have to be redrawn.
THIRD LAW: If, when the completion of a design is im-
   minent, field dimensions are finally supplied as they
   actually are - instead of as they were meant to be -
   it is always simpler to start all over.
FOURTH LAW: Even if it is impossible to assemble a part
   incorrectly, still a way will be found to do it wrong.
   COROLLARY I - It is usually impractical to worry be-
      forehand about interferences - if you have none,
      somone will make one for you.
THE LAW     OF THE LOST INCH: In designing any type
   of construction, no over-all dimension can be totaled
   correctly after 4 p.m. Friday.
   COROLLARY I - Under the same conditions, if any
      minor dimensions are given to 1/16 of an inch, they
      cannot be totaled at all.
   COROLLARY II - The correct total will be self-evident
      at 9:01 a.m. Monday morning.
   Deliveries that normally take one day will take five when
you are waiting.
   When adjusting (or drawing or computing, etc.) remem-
ber that the eye of the chief inspector (engineer, draftsman,
etc.) is more accurate than the finest instrument.
   After adding two weeks to a schedule for unexpected
delays, add two more weeks for the unexpected unexpected
delays.
   In any problem, if you find yourself doing an unending
amount of work, the answer may be obtained by inspection.
                  FINAGLE'S CREED:
   Science is Truth - don't be misled by facts.
                  FINAGLE'S MOTTO:
   Smile - tomorrow it will be worse.
                THE FINAGLE FACTOR
   A mathematical notation of Finagle's work has also been
developed. Here, however, there seems to be some confusion,
because two other names enter the picture: "fudge" and
"diddle" factors are also used to considerable advantage by
scientists and engineers.
   Years ago - when the universe was relatively easy to
understand - the Finagle factor consisted of a simple addi-
tive constant (sometimes known as a variable constant) in
the form:
                      x = Kf + X
where any measured variable, X, could be made to agree with
theory, x, by simple addition of the Finagle factor, Kf.
   Later difficulties couldn't be solved so easily and so a
fudge factor, Kb, was added.
                     x = Kf + KbX.
   Powerful as this adjustment was, World War II studies
in servo theory indicated a need for a still stronger influence.
The diddle factor, Kd, was born and made to multiply the
quadratic term.
                x = Kf + KbX + KdX2.
   It is felt that, at least at present, reality can be made to
conform to mathematical theory with reasonable agreement
on the basis of these three factors.


   However, Skyscraper Engineer feels there is a different
basic structure behind the Finagle, fudge and diddle factors.
The Finagle factor, we claim, is characterized by changing
the universe to fit an equation. The fudge factor, on the
other hand, changes the equation to fit the universe. And
finally, the diddle factor changes things so that the equation
and the universe appear to fit, without making any real
change in either.
   For example, the planet Uranus was introduced to the
universe when Newtonian laws couldn't be made to match
known planetary motions. This is a beautiful example of
the application of the Finagle factor.
   Einstein's work leading to relativity was strongly in-
fluenced by the observed facts about the orbit of Mercury.
Obviously a fudge factor was introduced.
   The photographer's use of a "soft-focus" lens when taking
portraits of women over 35 is an example of the diddle
factor. By blurring the results photographs are made to
appear to match the facts in a far more satisfactory manner.
   To our knowledge, this is the first clear enunciation of
the scientific method. All our vast sum of human knowl-
edge has been derived with these as the basic tools. By
having them in writing for the first time, perhaps our chil-
dren can build even better futures than the best we envision
today.

1. Suddenly acquiring the virtue of
thrift, an engineering student put a
penny in a bank the first of the month.
Each succeeding day he put in twice as
much as the day before until by the end
of the 30 day month he had acquired
quite a few pennies. Exactly how many
pennies had he saved?







  2. The water lentil reproduces by
by dividing into 2 every day. Thus on
the first day we have 1, on the second
day 2, on the third 4, and so on. If,
starting with one lentil it takes 30 days
to cover a certain area, how long will it
take to cover the same area if we start
with two lentils?

and suppose it is possible to erect a
telephone line on poles about the equa-

  5. In keeping with our policy of ex-
  posing all the false information we re-
  ceived in high school geometry, we
  would like to prove to you today that
  all triangles are actually isosceles. The
  proof is as follows:
  Given: any triangle ABC.
  Draw ME perpendicular to AB at the
  mid-point of AB; and draw CO, the
bisector of the angle C, intersecting the
line ME at O.
  Then ON equals OF. Triangle COF
congruent to triangle CON.
  Therefore CF equals CN. Corre-
sponding sides of congruent triangles.
  Join A and 0; also join O and B.
  Triangle AOE is then congruent to
triangle EOB.
  Therefore the triangles AOF and
OBN    are congruent. (Being   right
triangles having AO equal to BO and
OF equal to ON.)
  Therefore AF equals BN.
  Therefore AF plus FC equals CN
plus NB, or AC equals BC. Find the
fallacy, if any, in the above geometric
proof.

DEPARTMENT


OF


COMPUTER SCIENCE





                                                      By Robert Anservitz


   Advancement and specialization: key words in the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh's Department of Computer Sciences.
   Contrary to a common misapprehension, this Department
caters to both the graduate and undergraduate, and offers an
outstanding and continually progressive program which is
geared to suit the interests of the individual student. Wel-
coming people from a wide variety of backgrounds, it in-
cludes not only the mathematics, science and engineering
major, but also the major in sociological studies and the
humanities.
   Although the Department of Computer Science does not
offer a Bachelor's degree, it has plans for additional and
specialized courses to be made available to undergraduate
students. One of the diverse purposes of the Department is
to aid the non-programmer student in his field. The aid it
can supply to such non-computer majors is infinite. For the
student who has, for example, a knowledge of both econom-
ics and the Computer Science it can provide for a teamwork
type of program. Here the student is the key figure between
the Phd. economist and the computing system, and so can
help the economist to employ the computer in a more
sophisticated and smooth manner than would otherwise be
possible. The program offered is also invaluable to the stu-
dent who has his Bachelor's degree in Psychology, for ex-
ample, and who minors or otherwise manages to attain a
good basis in the Computer Sciences before returning to
his field. Dr. Muskat, of the Department of Computer
Sciences, emphasizes the fact that even if a person is not to


be a programmer, he can develop depth in his field through
a knowledge of the Computer Sciences.
   But the so-called "computer bum" species is looked upon
with disfavor. He is the one who becomes so enthralled with
the Computer Sciences that his other studies dissolve into
failure. Although Dr. Muskat agrees that the Department
has as yet been unable to discover an inoculation potent
enough to combat "computer fever" the faculty discourages
the "computer bum."
   The Computer Sciences' program is built around five
core courses which are designed to give the students a basic
foundation in various areas of the Computer Sciences. The
core courses consist of: 111, Introduction to Logical Design;
119, Computer Operating Systems; 121, Algorithmic Lan-
guages; 131, Numerical Algebra or 132, Numerical Analysis
and 141, Critical Statistics. The Department anticipates that
the typical graduate student entering their Master's degree
program will have taken two or three of these core courses
while an undergraduate. This graduate level program, which
is already accepting applications, requires eight courses and
boasts a most flexible curriculum. A student applying for
graduate work will be admitted, even though he is lacking
part of the prerequisites, as long as he is judged to have a
sufficient basic knowledge of Computer Sciences. Such a
student enters with a deficiency status which is cancelled
once he completes the needed requirements. Three of the
five previously listed core courses can count towards this
degree. Graduate level work also includes a comprehensive


UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH



































examination on the core courses and a thesis or thesis type
project.
   The program will be under the guidance of the curricu-
lum committee which includes Dr. Orrin E. Taulbee, Chair-
man of the Department of Computer Sciences and Director
of the Computer Center; Dr. Roudabush, Admissions Officer
and Dr. Muskat, the Graduate Program Advisor.
   The Master's program following the core courses will be
somewhat more specialized in that it will work with related
areas to fit the student's field. The courses to be offered this
winter already show a movement towards the development
of a closer rapport with the student. Both Computer Sciences
1 and 13 will be taught in four and two sections, respectively.
This coming winter trimester will also include Computer
Sciences 44, 141 and 251.
   Established prerequisites for the graduate program are
Computer Sciences 1 and 13, or the equivalent, plus math 24
(Calculus), 115 (Mathematical Statistics) and 123 (Linear
Algebra). But the Department of Computer Sciences at the
University of Pittsburgh, unlike the one at Carnegie Institute
of Technology, is not a heavily orientated mathematics pro-
gram. The mathematic requirements at the University of
Pittsburgh are not so stringent as to keep an applicant out,
although the requirements still must eventually be fulfilled.
   With an understanding that the Department of Com-
puter Sciences does not assist other departments within the
University and will eventually progress to teaching a portion
of the courses presently taught by other departments, it is
evident that the Center offers an extremely flexible program


and will integrate itself with various subjects.
   Advancement surrounds this expanding and provocative
field. Past projects such as Typesetting, Upgrade and Monitor
PEST (Pitt Executive System for Tapes) have been phased
out to make way for advancement. Project PENELOPE
(Pitt Natural Language Processor) has already been incor-
porated into Project PIL/L (Pitt Interpretive Language),
the language which now occupies the IBM 360. PENELOPE
will be made a more comprehensive language for text work.
The Department is also planning the initiation of a Com-
puter Sciences 2 course, which will stress the processing of
non-numerical information, particularly text material, which
is one of the particular interests of Dr. Roudabush. Other
advanced courses planned for the future include Implemen-
tation of Computer Languages, Advanced Topics and Oper-
ating Systems, Numerical Analysis, Abstract Models of Com-
puting, Graph Theory and Automata Theory plus work in
applications, including Information Processing and Simula-
tion. The applications to be offered will, of course, corre-
spond with the faculty interests.
   If you can name the field, the University of Pittsburgh's
Department of Computer Sciences can name the curriculum
for you. As quickly as you can say IBM the faculty on the
eighth floor of the Cathedral of Learning can tell you the
advantages the Computer Sciences can supply you with in
your specific area. An expanding and increasingly important
field such as the Computer Sciences can skyrocket anyone
to success in his field. It may prove to be the ride to secure
your future.


















































Engineering and


   AVCS for NIMBUS and TIROS
   NIMBUS-the research and devel-
   opment spacecraft in the weather
   satellite program of the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administra-
   tion-utilized an Advanced Vidicon
   Camera Subsystem (AVCS) which
   represented a significant advance in
   space television cameras.
   This AVCS, designed and built by
   RCA for the NASA Goddard Space
   Flight Center, comprised three sepa-
   rate one-inch vidicon camera tubes,
   each with a lens and electronics
   assembly. The cameras provided a
   picture resolution of 800 TV lines
   equivalent to an earth resolution of
   one-half mile for a 500-mile altitude.
   The dynamic range of AVCS was 0.4
   to 0.004 foot-candle-seconds exclusive
   of an automatic iris control which
   could vary the light to the faceplate
   over a range of a factor of 16. The
   center camera looked straight down
   at the earth and the right and left
   cameras were canted to look 35-de-
   grees away from the vertical axis.


Science


at RCA


Each set of three pictures then formed
a rectangular presentation of the earth
about 1300 miles across (east to west)
and 400 miles along (south to north)
the orbit path.
During each orbital path over the sun-
lit side of the earth, the Nimbus AVCS
took a total of 32 of these composite
pictures. This set of pictures provided
complete pole-to-pole meteorological
coverage of the 1300-mile wide swath,
with the rotation of the earth causing
the swath to move to an adjacent,
overlapping area during the next orbit.
In this way, complete earth coverage
was obtained each day.
The AVCS TV system was used on the
second NIMBUS satellite also, and,
in addition, with a slightly different
configuration, on the TIROS Opera-
tional System (TOS) satellites.
The RCA TOS satellites are designed
to provide similar full global weather
coverage every day from a sun-syn-
chronous, near-polar orbit. Each sat-
ellite will be oriented with its spin axis
perpendicular to the orbit plane. In


this position the satellite will be like
a wheel rolling in the orbit path. Thus,
AVCS continues to contribute to this
nation's progress toward improved
weather analysis and forecasting.

Which degree counts most?


Besides a B.S., M.S., M.B.A., Ph.D.-or what have you-there
are other degrees vital to your future. The degree of imagina-
tion. Ambition. Responsibility.
If you have them in good measure, we know of no company
better able, or more disposed, to reward them. Handsomely.
In terms of professional recognition, intellectually stimulating
environment, and material reward.
We're big. But we're still young and growing. And plan to keep
on. In 1965, for example, our sales rose 23%. To over $860
million. And 516 million in the first half of '66.


We need top-notch people who can grow with us. People
who are well trained in chemistry, physics, chemical, elec-
trical, or mechanical engineering, marketing or finance.
And who have that extra degree.
Talk it over with your faculty and Placement Officer. And re-
gardless of your military commitments, be sure to see our rep-
resentative when he is on your campus. Or

                                              moon talk!



                   Imagine hearing from the Man on the Moon!
                   You will. And the first American voice that speaks to earth
                   from moon will arrive by the help of a Motorola transceiver.
                   Each of the 8 major phases of the historic Apollo space mission
                   which will carry the first American astronauts to the surface of
                   the moon-from pre-launch checkout...through moon landing
o0                 and exploration . . .to earth return-will receive the critically
                   important support of Motorola electronics equipment.
                   But back to moon talk. Enroute to the moon-a Motorola Up
                   Data Link on board the Command Service Module will receive
                   mission data from earth. When the Apollo astronaut speaks to
                   earth from the moon, a Motorola transceiver will help send his
0                  voice to us. A small Motorola-designed backpack antenna as-
                   sociated with the communication system will relay his words to
                   LM (the Lunar Module that lands the astronauts on the moon),
Swhere the transceiver assists in relaying them on to earth.
                   A Motorola transponder will also help provide television, voice,
                   and digital communications... across 238,857 miles.
                   Actually-ever since the first Mercury space flight in 1961,
                   sophisticated Motorola electronics have played a vital role in
                   controlling, signaling, tracking, and communicating in Amer-
                   ica's manned space programs. Motorola equipment has been
                   on every single U.S. manned spacecraft mission. Reliably.
                   Official mission reports confirm that a Motorola unit has never
                   malfunctioned or failed to operate on any of these flights.
                   So when the conversation gets around to "moon talks" and
                   "moon walks," count Motorola in. And, by the way, you'll find
                   Motorola's name on plenty of down-to-earth products, too!

                                                 ... We've developed a new hydrocracking process

     HARDIMAN - By means of an advanced system of
 levers, control linkages, and servomechanisms, this unique
 machine will mimic and amplify the movements of its
 operator - dramatically extending his strength and endur-
 ance. This man-machine marriage will essentially combine
 the operator's dexterity, brain-power, and all-around versa-
 tility with a machine's strength, size, and ruggedness.
    Worn like an external skeleton, the "mechanical muscles"
  machine - nicknamed HardiMan - will permit its operator
  to lift a 1500-lb load while exerting only a fraction of this
  force. He will be able to perform general load-handling
  tasks, including walking, lifting, climbing, pushing, and
  pulling. The machine - technically described as a powered
  exoskeleton - will be attached to the operator at the feet,
  forearms, and waist.
    The end result climaxed 15 years of work on cybernetic
 anthropomorphous machines at the General Electric Re-
 search and Development Center.
    The key to HardiMan is "force feedback" control. Force
 feedback means that proportions of the forces generated or
 encountered by the machine are duplicated and reflected to
 the operator. If the machine's arm or leg strikes a solid
 object, the operator feels that identical force situation of
 striking an object with his arm or leg. As a result, the
 machine simply becomes an extension of the man, and the
 operator is able to concern himself with the task at hand.





What's New


   THE UNACHIEVABLE ACHIEVED - Working with
extremely thin superconductive films of tin deposited on a
glass slide, General Electric physicists have built and oper-
ated a laboratory model of a direct current transformer -
long considered an "unachievable" scientific goal. This
direct current transformer can convert direct current input
into larger or smaller D-C output. It has been operated at
very low voltages and currents with an efficiency of about
ten per cent.
   In the new transformer, the primary and secondary tin
films are only about 1000 Angstroms thick and are separated
by an insulating film of silicon oxide only about 100
Angstroms thick. When the transformer is cooled to liquid
helium temperatures and direct current is passed through
the primary, magnetic "flux spots" begin to move in one
direction relative to the film. These flux spots also penetrate
and move through the adjacent secondary film. The moving
(and hence changing) magnetic field thus induces a direct
current in the secondary.
   A number of secondary films in series yield secondary
voltages many times higher than the primary voltage.
Similarly, by placing a number of primary films in series,
the output voltage can be "stepped down" below the input
voltage.

    PLAY IT COOL - A silicone rubber insulation is being
 employed on two different stages of NASA's Saturn V
 flight vehicles. On stage two of the vehicle the insulation is
 used primarily to protect the cluster of five engines from
 base heating during firing. The major areas requiring pro-
 tection are the steel reinforcing rings on the thrust chamber.
    On stage three the engine is prechilled prior to launch,
 and the insulation here helps to maintain the required fuel
 tube temperature during launch and vehicle boost.
   More than 200 lbs. of the silicone-based insulation
 material, called Larodyne, is used on each vehicle.
   Temperature extremes to which the insulation will be
 subjected are expected to range from  -300oF to 5000"F.
 Vibration from the thrust will be in the 20 to 150 G's range
 with the expansion from minus to plus 1/8 inch. Maximum
 heat flow will range up to 45 BTU/ft."/sec.
   Silicone elastomer materials were chosen after careful con-
sideration of the extremes of conditions and the available
time span during which the insulation had to be developed,
tested, manufactured, and delivered for the first flight.                   i
   Other design requirements imposed are: high adhesion,
very low cohesion, non-flammability, high insulating prop-
erties, and ease of operation and repair. Because of the                                                          i
critical importance of weight, density was also of prime
importance.

If you still think glass is just glass,


ask New York Central.


Now tiny glass devices can do what complex electromechani-
cal systems can't. Control the power of a locomotive without
the use of moving parts. And without breakdowns due to short
circuits, wear, heat deterioration and shock. Ask New York
Central.
  These devices channel a small volume of fluid (air, gas or
liquid) under low pressure so that it activates a much more
powerful jet of fluid. This in turn helps control the massive
equipment which regulates the locomotive's speed and power.
  Fluid devices are finding increasing use as machine and
process controls and in computer logic sections. Corning pro-
duces fluidic devices from its unique FOTOCERAM@ photo-
sensitive glass-ceramic, which allows extremely accurate chem-
ical machining.


  Today, glass can be made six times stronger than steel. Or as
soft as silk. It can bend or not bend. Break or not break. Melt
or not melt. It can be molded, cast, machined, drawn and
pressed. It possesses more capabilities than any other material.
  For solutions to their materials problems, industry and gov-
ernment are coming to Corning. Because Corning is the glass-
master. It's a broad, international company, with one of the
most daring, expert and imaginative research and engineering
staffs in the world. Plus a marketing principle that commits
them to developing products only in areas where a need exists
and no product does.

                                             by Barbhra Nicholas


   Thirty-eight classrooms, 184 laboratories and 207 offices
will occupy the University's Michael L. Benedum Hall of
Engineering. Ground was broken in March and construc-
tion started this past summer. Deeter, Ritchey, Sipple Archi-
tects, University Engineering Faculty, and plant personnel
have worked in close cooperation to insure an Engineering
Building that will fulfill and accommodate the needs of both
students and professors. In addition, student suggestions
have been solicited from the Engineering Cabinet. This new
building will be located on the plot formerly occupied
by the Logan Armory and its parking facilities across the
street from Engineering Hall at Thackeray and O'Hara
Streets. Some unusual aspects of the 20 million dollar build-
ing are a "coffer" or "module" design system and a "waffle"
ceiling lighting motiff which will be carried out throughout
the entire building. Every one of the 38 classrooms, 184 labs,
and 207 offices will consist of a "module" or some multiple of
a "module." All "modules" will contain an integral number
of square lighting grids, about three feet nine inches square
and one foot deep. In order to cut down on glare, the
fluorescent lights will be louvered so that the fixtures will
not be visible from the floor except from a forty-five degree
angle. Ceilings will be slightly more than fourteen feet from


the floor. Drop ceilings will be placed only in corridors.
Labs will be confined to central bays; heavy equipment labs
will be located under the podium. Classrooms and offices
will be on the outer perimeter of the building.
   A plaza similar to the dormitory Towers' plaza will
separate the auditorium which will be adjacent to the 182
foot by 161 foot engineering building. The auditorium
which will seat 525 persons will be used for lecture and
demonstration purposes along with student activities and
area technical and professional meetings. Gross square feet
within the building will be 419,000; this amount is 80% of
the Cathedral of Learning's floor space.
   Building plans also include space for a library, student
lounge and activity offices on the ground floor. A ramp lead-
ing to the entrance of a plaza adjacent to the lounge will be
provided. The lounge will be 28 feet by 74 feet; outside the
lounge will be the plaza, about two-thirds of the size of the
main building in total area. Summer furniture much like
that of the Towers' Plaza is planned for the lounge. With a
completion date of 1968, the completely air-conditioned build-
ing will centralize the department now spread throughout
six buildings, and will provide facilities for 2500 full-time
day students and 1000 night students.

The problem: Accuracy in magnetic flowmeters is degraded
by such things as ripple current, power input amplitude
variations, and changes in duty cycle. A flowmeter is needed
that operates independently of other system inputs.
The solution: A flowmeter with a direct-coupled optical
output. The design includes simple external adjustment and
signal amplitude control.
How it's done: An optical encoder disk is mounted on the
shaft that is driven by the flow wheel in the measured fluid.
An optical sensor consisting of a light source, collimating
lens, and photodiode is so mounted that the encoder disk
interrupts the beam of light from the light source to the
photodiode. A slot or other configuration cut out of the disk
causes the light source to illuminate the photodiode as it
indexes with the beam   of light. The designer includes a
solenoid operated mounting for the optical sensor so it may
be moved up out of the encoder disk path for calibration
and adjustment. The spring mounted sensor frame returns
to operating position when the solenoid is de-energized.

The problem: To visualize the limits of an operator's field
of view as his eyes are directed at a given point on a control
panel. This will assist in the planning and layout of critical
instruments and   emergency controls according    to their
functional relationship.
The solution: A device that projects visual pattern limits in
any direction an operator may be required to look. The
device provides instant evaluation of visual ability at any
point on a panel.
How it's done: The device consists of two projectors that
can be pivoted to simulate the range of movement of the
human eye and head. Each projector contains a reflector,
light source, filter, a slide containing an image, and an
objective lens. The light is reflected to the filter where it is
diffused to uniformly illuminate the image-containing visual
pattern slide and project the image by means of the objective
lens. The two images converge at a focal point in a binocular
projection determined   by the simulated    eye and   head
movements.
   The projected image will show    areas on the panel by
shadow patterns that are blind to the left, right, or both eyes,
due to framework, supports, handles, etc., located between
panel and operator position.

                       The problem: In certain combustion applications, as in an
                       aircraft jet engine; performance is degraded if too large a
                       proportion of the fuel enters the combustion chamber in
                       purely liquid form. It is therefore necessary to reduce the
                       liquid-to-gas ratio in order to achieve maximum efficiency.
                       The solution: A centrifugal separator that removes a pre-
                       determined portion of the liquid that is passing through a
                       duct as a liquid-gas mixture.
                       How it's done: As the liquid-gas mixture in the conduit
                       enters the separator, a portion of the liquid strikes the rotat-
                       ing wire-mesh screen, and is caused by centrifugal force to
                       seek the largest diameter of the separator where it forms in
                       an annular pool. Centrifugal force also causes the liquid in
                       the pool to enter the collector tube and move through the
                       universal coupling into a pipe that leads to an accumulator.
                       The accumulator includes a transverse diaphragm that is
                       exposed on one side to the stored liquid from the separator
                       and on the other to gas pressure from the main conduit inlet.
                       In this way, the separator works only against the gas pressure
                       in the conduit.
                          The collector tube in the separator is designed with one
                       portion shorter than the other so that, when the liquid level
                       in the annular pool recedes to a point where the shorter end
                       is no longer submerged, the longer end will act to pump
                       liquid through the collector tube back into the pool through
                       the shorter end. In this way, passage of gas to the accumula-
                       tor is prevented and pumping of fluid to the accumulator is
                       automatically controlled. A checkvalve in the pipe to the
                       accumulator prevents backflow and a drain with pressure
                       regulating  valve  permits   system   operation  with   the
                       accumulator filled.

                                                       Plug Weld    Valve Plug

The problem: Metallic, weld-sealed valves (usually of the
bellows-seal construction) used for corrosive and high tem-
perature fluid flow control, are costly to fabricate and are
often large and cumbersome, and may not provide reliable
pressure and vacuum-tight fluid enclosures.
The solution: A monometallic diaphragm valve in which
the body, diaphragm, and plug are welded together to form
an integral leakproof unit for containing the fluid as it
passes through the valve from inlet to outlet.
How it's done: Flow control is achieved by varying the
position of the conical end of the plug with respect to its
cylindrical inlet passage seat. The movement of the plug
with respect to the valve body is achieved by means of a
differential thread action provided by the two threaded por-
tions of the stem. A finer thread engages the bonnet and a
coarser thread engages the plug, resulting in a fine adjust-
ment for throttling and flow control. A bleed passage in the
valve body connects the cavity between the diaphragm and
body with the outlet or low pressure side of the valve. The
cavity between the diaphragm and the bonnet is tapped for
venting, or for pressurizing to counter the internal pressure
if necessary. In addition, the bonnet side of the diaphragm
can be heated or cooled by means of these inlet and outlet
passages provided in the bonnet. The body, plug, and dia-
phragm are welded together to form a pressure- and vacuum-
tight fluid enclosure, and the bonnet is sealed by gaskets or
packing. The diaphragm is formed from thin plate and
series of annular convolutions are die stamped into it to
ensure ease of flexure.

So you want to be a pilot?


   It's not as hard as it looks. It's harder.
   The days of flying by the seat of your pants are gone forever.
Now you have to know an awful lot about things like aerodynam-
ics, electronics, and celestial navigation.
   Does that mean that flying in the Air Force has become
"automated"? It does not.
   Any pilot will tell you that flying is still a great adventure. The
split second when a man leaves the runway solo for the first time
is still one of the most exciting moments of his life.
   If you'd like to earn your wings, one of the best ways is through
Air Force ROTC. For details, contact the Professor of Aerospace
Studies, an Air Force representative, or mail the coupon.

who joined us had the same aims,


                    color, and interests!


The guy who wrote what you are reading joined the com-
pany as an optical physicist. Now he's an advertising man.
His assistant, an English and French major from Catawba
College in Salisbury, N.C., who first joined our French
affiliate, Kodak-Path6, in Paris, has just written a manual
in English that introduces beginners to a system of sepa-
rations chemistry for which we market equipment and
supplies. Her husband works in our Photographic Tech-
nology Division engineering color motion-picture proc-
essing systems. (Four other departments tried to lure him
away, but he decided he preferred the exciting new de-
velopment work in his area.) The chairman of our board
also came originally as a physicist, the president as a
mathematician, one of our two executive vice presidents
as a chemical engineer, the other as a Ph.D. chemist. On
the other hand, our vice president of marketing majored
in economics at the local university.
  The point: out of self-interest, pure and frank, we
have to help every college graduate who joins us find
where he is happiest and can therefore earn raises fastest.
What makes this a little easier here for both parties is
our tremendous scope.
  Having long been part of many, many more industries
than the one with which the general public identifies us,
we operate in technologies that range from optics to
cattle nutrition, from knitting to laser-cavity design. Per-


haps more significant to the

HOWARD HUGHES DOCTORAL FELLOWSHIPS. Applica-
tions for the Howard Hughes Doctoral Fellowships in engineer-
ing, physics, or mathematics are now available for the academic
year beginning in Autumn 1967.
The program offers the qualified candidate an outstanding
opportunity for study and research at a selected university, plus
professional industrial summer experience at a Hughes facility.
Each Doctoral Fellowship includes tuition, books and thesis
preparation expenses, plus stipend ranging from $2,200 to
$3,100, depending upon the Program year and the number of
candidate's dependents. Full salary is paid the Fellow during his
summer work at Hughes. Salaries are reviewed periodically and
increased with the growth of the individual. Fellowships are
awarded to outstanding students who have completed a master's
degree (or equivalent) and have been accepted as a candidate
for the doctoral degree.
HUGHES MASTERS FELLOWSHIPS. Approximately 100
new awards for '67-'68 are available to qualified applicants with
a baccalaureate degree in engineering, mathematics or physics.
Most of these awards are Work-Study Fellowships; a very lim-
ited number are Full-Study. Upon completion of the Masters
Program, Fellows are eligible to apply for and are given special
consideration for a Hughes Doctoral Fellowship.
Fellows who associate with a Company facility in the Los Angeles
area usually attend the University of Southern California or the
University of California, Los Angeles. Tuition, books and other
academic expenses are paid by the Company, plus a stipend
ranging from $500 to $850 for the academic year. A significant
advantage offered by the Work-Study Program is the opportunity
to acquire professional experience working with highly compe-
tent engineers and scientists while pursuing the M.S. degree.
Selected Fellows have the option to work in several different
assignments during the Fellowship period to help them decide

on their field of concentration and optimum work assignment.
Fellows earn full salary during the summer and pro-rata salary
for 24 hours work a week during the academic year. The com-
bined salary and stipend enables Fellow to enjoy an income in
excess of $6,500 per year during his two years as a Work-Study
Fellow. Salaries are increased commensurate with professional
growth and Fellows are eligible for regular Company benefits.
Work assignments are matched closely to the Fellow's interests.
Primary emphasis at Hughes is research and development in
the field of electronics for application to defense systems and
space technology. Fields of interest include stability and trajec-
tory analysis, energy conversion, structural design and analysis
- computer and reliability technology, circuit and information
theory, plasma electronics, microminiaturization, and human
factor analysis - research, development and product design on
such devices as parametric amplifiers, masers and lasers, micro-
wave tubes, antenna arrays, electron-tube and solid-state dis-
plays, and components - design analysis, integration and test-
ing of space and airborne missile and vehicle systems, infrared
search and tracking systems, and computer, data processing
and display systems -theoretical and experimental work in
solid-state and ion physics.
Citizenship; American citizenship and eligibility for security
clearance are required.
Closing date for all applications: Early application is advis-
able. All materials should be postmarked not later than February
1 for the Doctoral Fellowships, and March 1 for the Masters
Fellowships.
How to apply: To apply for either the Doctoral or Masters
Fellowship, write to: Mr. James C. Cox, Manager, Personnel
Administration - Corporate Industrial Relations, Hughes Aircraft
