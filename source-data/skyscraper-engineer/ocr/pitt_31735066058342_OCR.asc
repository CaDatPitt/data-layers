Dr. Byron S. Gottfried:
the Man Behind the Pen

by Robin A. Depto

Dr. Byron S. Gottfried is a very busy man — just try to
catch him for an interview like I did and you’ll see what I
mean. I caught him long enough, however, to have him
tell me how a guy from upstate New York (specifically,
Rochester) ends up writing technical textbooks and
aids for a major U.S. publisher.

Many industrial engineering students here at Pitt
have had a computer class with Dr. Gottfried. His inter-
est in computers, however, goes well beyond teaching.
Before coming to the University of Pittsburgh, he held
several jobs involving computing. In addition, he has
written several books dealing with computers.

Dr. Gottfried attended both Purdue and the Univer-
sity of Michigan before earning his Ph.D. at Case-
Western. Originally a chemical engineering major, he
became involved with industrial engineering work
while employed with Gulf Oil. At that time he had
already begun teaching computer classes in the even-
ings. Since then, he has worked for Westinghouse and
NASA, primarily in the area of computer modeling. It
was while he was teaching at Carnegie Institute of
Technology that a friend suggested he try writing.

Once you understand something, Dr. Gottfried
explained, you develop “a creative urge for saying it
your own way.” That “something" in Dr. Gottfried’s
case is computers, his main area of interest. His texts
deal with both computer programming and computer
engineering. They include Programming With Fortran
IV, which many of Pitt's upperclassmen used as fresh-
men. As well as having written textbooks, he has also
written several works for McGraw-Hill's Schaum's
Outline Series. Dr. Gottfried co-authored Engineering
Economics, and has completed three others on his
own for Schaum's, namely Programming With Basic,
Introduction to Engineering Calculations, and Pro-
gramming With Pascal.

In presenting material in a text, Dr. Gottfried feels he
is able to explain the technical ideas in an easy to
understand way. In addition, he always includes many
examples. Reviewing examples, he believes is “one of
the best ways to learn.”

Dr. Gottfried explained that when developing a new
text, publishers usually look for an area that has a
strong market. Dr. Gottfried makes suggestionsto Mc-
Graw-Hill as to what sort of book might be good to
produce, and usually the company accepts his prop-
osal. Then he begins to write.

as

Pitt’s Dr. Gottfried is the author of several engineer-
ing and computer texts.

The rapid growth of technology forces Dr. Gottfried
to frequently update his works. In orderto keep up with
the fast paced computer industry, for example, he is
currently working on the third edition of a book on
Basic.

But changing technology is affecting all of society,
including industry and education. Dr. Gottfried feels
that because of this, industry should support engi-
neers with advanced degrees, investing in projects
with much higher payoffs in the long run rather than
short term projects that aren’t as valuable but may
yield quicker results.

Dr. Gottfried sees a need for more support of educa-
tion so that the universities also may keep up with
changing technology. He is optimistic about Pitt's
School of Engineering, and anticipates improvements.
Dr. Gottfried has developed his own interest in compu-
ters to the fullest extent, through both his writing and
teaching in the field.

Plant Tripping

by Dave Mahofski and Mark McKrell

An important part of your college education is find-
ing permanent employment in your chosen profes-
sion. This pursuit is broken up into two separate
segments. The first is the initial job interview, whilethe
second phase is a plant visit to the company. The plant
trip is a result of a successful initial job interview.

In this article we will try to familiarize you with plant
trips, a topic that is usually left unaddressed. Most
workshops and articles focus on the initial interview, a
subject which we will not touch upon here.

The first job interview, many times, takes place at the
University of Pittsburgh's placement center. The func-

tion of this interview is to screen the candidates to see
if they would fit into the company's way of doing
things. If the interviewer and others at the company
believe that you could work well within their organiza-
tion, you will be offered a plant visit. The purpose ofthe
visit is to allow you to be interviewed for a specific
position.

The first question that may arise when you are
invited on a plant trip is how are you to travel to the
company. A typical way is to travel via the airlines.
Some companies will prepay the airline for your
tickets, while others prefer for you to purchase tickets
and then be reimbursed upon arrival at the company.

takes place‘on Wednesday.

The description below leads you through the schedule of a plant trip recently taken
by one of the authors. The schedule is typical of most companies, but it must be
remembered that no two companies do things alike. The interview in this schedule

TUESDAY

6:00 PM a— Catch the airport bus in front of Webster
Hall apartment building (or University Inn). Ask for
receipt.

6:45 PM — Go to the USAir counter and ask for
prepaid tickets.

7:15 PM — Board airplane. Chew gum to protect
ears.

8:20 PM — Plane lands. Go outside the airport and
catch the Hertz bus to the rental agency. (Alterna-
tively, a taxi might be used fortransporatation to the
hotel.)

8:35 PM — Ask for rental car reserved in your name.
Follow directions to hotel.

9:15 PM — Get off of interstate and check directions
to hotel again.

9:40 PM — Check into hotel. Ask for a wake—up call
at 7:00 a.m.

10:00 PM — Review directions to plant. Watch
“Raiders” on HBO.

WEDNESDAY
7:00 AM — Phone rings for wake-up call.
8:00 AM — Eat breakfast in hotel dining room.
8:30 AM — Check out of hotel. Ask for receipt.

9:00 AM — Find the person at the plant whom you
are to check in with. Receive your schedule for the
day. Get a general overview from this person.

9:30 AM — First interview is with the manager of a
division that has an interest in your abilities. Find
out exactly what this group does and what you
would be doing in your first year of employment.
Relax and confidently answer the questions.

10:15 AM — Second interview. Manager of another
division with an interest in you. Find out aboutthem
and what they do.

11:00 AM — Tour of operations. Get an idea of what
the whole plant does and where the groups you
interviewed with fit in. See if the people here enjoy
their work. See if you would like the environment
you will be working in.

Remember that you can be reimbursed (on a per mile
basis) for your travel between home and the airport,
including fares for taxi or limo service or any other
costs.

Other expenses that are reimbursable include fees
for meals, hotel stays, a rental car (if okayed by the
company), and transportation to the hotel from the
airport and from the hotel to the company. Some com-
panies will even pay for you to call home and tell of
your safe arrival. If any expenses arise during your visit
which cannot be avoided, then ask if you can be reim-
bursed, if you are unsure.

During the plant trip a suit is considered appropriate
attire. When travelling on the airplane, casual dress is
fine, unless you are being picked up at the airport, in
which case dress clothes are appropiate — a suit is not
essential.

The plant trip is designed so as not to cause financial
difficulties for you, but to give you an idea of the type of
position that the company has to offer. The interview
itself is designed to allow the manager to see ifyou are
really interested in working forthe company. Topics of
interview questions will range from courses you have
taken to career goals, educational goals, and even
what you perceive yourself doing for the company.

NOON — You are taken to lunch. Take the time to
relax and enjoy it. Ask questions about the area,
educational institutions, recreational facilities, etc.

1:00 PM — Interview with an engineer from one of
the groups interested in you. Look for the specifics
of the kind of work you can do in this group.

1:45 PM — Interview with an engineerfrom another
group. Look for the same things.

2:30 PM — Interview with a big wig in management.
Show poise and confidence. Don’t be intimidated.

3:15 PM — Exit interview. Find out all the things you
wanted to know but haven't been told: company
benefits, housing costs in the area, chances of
advancement.

4:00 PM — Leave plant. Drive around and check out
the area.

5:30 PM — Stop and ask directions to the airport
after getting lost.

5:50 PM — Turn in car. Take the bus back to the
USAir terminal at airport.

6:15 PM — Board airplane.

7:20 PM — Plane lands. Take airporttransportation
back to campus.

Appropriate questions for you to ask are any that show
your interest in the company. Ask what you would do if
you are hired — what type of work you would have to
perform. Ask about educational opportunities and
what type of mobility exists within the company. This
includes both the ability to move between different
departments (horizontal mobility) as well as the fre-
quency of promotions within the organization (vertical
mobility). Don’t be afraid to mention classes that you
have taken that are directly related to the position that
you are discussing. Remember, above all, to be relaxed
and confident of your abilities.

Climotc Control

by Tim Ryan

The sun rose slowly over the horizon, coloring the
great expanse of sky a brilliant pink. Freddy looked out
across the vast landscape of rocks and dust and
rotated his solar cells to face the sunrise. The plateau
stretched out for hundreds of kilometers in all direc-
tions, and Freddy was once more impressed by the
hugeness of this planet, that horizon so far away, and
wished he was on Earth.

Freddy felt the cold, thin air blow through his detec-
tors as he extended an arm to dig in the sand. He

recorded the temperature, humidity and windspeed in ‘

his log, the 400th such entry he had made since his
fiery descent to the planet, and dumped his little load
of dirt into his hopper to be analyzed. He irradiated the
soil sample and watched it for certain changes, fed it
some nutrient soup and waited patiently for the aroma
of metabolization to reach his electronic nostrils. Yes,
there it was again, the subtle whiff of oxygen that told
him that there were things alive in the ground; small,
unsubstantial organisms, but living things neverthe-
less. The tests had been consistent overthe last year
and across nearly five thousand kilometers of arid
desert. There was definitely some sort of life on the
planet.

“Centauri Probe to Freddy, please acknowledge.”

Freddy rotated his dish antennae into alignment and
transmitted his reply. “Freddy here. Prepare for data
transfer.”

The machines communicated rapidly over the tight
microwave beam, Freddy dumping all of the data he
had accumulated over the past two days in a burst of
digital chatter. He had repeated this procedure with
the orbiter more times than he cared to count during
the last year, and he was very glad to know that the
mission was nearing its end.

“Thank you, Freddy,” said the orbiter in her terse,
efficient tone. Freddy often wondered at her compo-
sure. Cynthia was always so calm.

“You’re welcome, Cynthia,” said Freddy. “Can you
tell me how much further to the ruins?” he asked.

‘‘I have to remind you every day, Freddy. Can't you
remember anything important?”

“You know I have a depleted memory capacity, Cyn-
thia,” Freddy whined. “Besides, I have to remember all

, « ,__of this meteorological junk. All you ever do is take

pictures.”

“Now Freddy, you know very well that's not true. My ‘

weather analysis occupies nearly all of my processing
capacity, in addition to keeping tabs on you and the
myriad other chores I have to do. Now for the last time
it is exactly 17.4 kilometers to the ruins from your
present position. Please don't ask again.”

“Thank you, Cynthia, I won’t forget.” Sometimes he
just hated her. Especially when she reminded him of
how much more responsible and efficient Billy was
before he  before he  Freddy didn’t like to think
about it. But was it his fault that he had lost several
thousand megabytes of memory to a roguish micro-
meteor? What did she expect?

“Do you think you'll be" able to cover the distance

C today?” asked Cynthia.

“Maybe," said Freddy. Now that the ruins were
within reach he was suddenly unsure of whether or not
he actually wanted to see them. They were a fabulous
find, entirely unexpected, and undoubtedly very, very
important. Freddy hoped he wouldn't screw up. It was
vitally important that he perform flawlessly over the
next few days and, well, he just wasn't feeling too
conﬁdent

‘‘I’m sure you'll make it today, Freddy," said Cynthia
smoothly. “The terrain’s relatively simple the rest of the
way.”

‘‘I’m glad you're so optimistic,” Freddy said. She
wasn't that bad at times, really. If shejust wasn't always
telling him what to do, he’d probably like hera lot, but
as things stood at the moment 

“Radio blackout until oh—one—twenty,” declared
Cynthia. “Centauri Probe out.” The message flashed

into Freddy’s input buffers and he listened intently

until the carrier went dead. He was alone again.

Freddy felt much colder now. The planet, although I

very big, had not managed to retain much of its atmos-
phere and had consequently lost much of its heat
retaining capacity. The winds, although thin, were
frigid and Freddy was the only thing on the planet who
could appreciate how miserable it was. The thin air
made for exceptionally good sky watching at night,
though. Freddy had done this often in the earlier
stages of the mission in order to photograph the night
sky. It looked different; the constellations were di-
storted by the tremendous shift in position, although
not extremely so. Actually, that wasthe only reason the
mission planners had included time for Freddy’s
photography. His pictures wouldn't reveal very much
about the stars they depicted, but they would be our-

 

ious. Freddy was only too happy to oblige. He still
gazed at the stars at night out of habit. His favorite
diversion was looking for Sol, the small yellow dotthat
marked his home. It was very far away.

The fiery ball that was the main object in Freddy's
sensors had driven all thoughts of the night sky from
his mind, however. Proxima Centauri looked very
small this morning, as it did every morning, compared
to the sweeping horizon of its giant, arid satellite.
Freddy crawled towards it on caterpillar tracks which
were retractable. He also had a set of wheels with
flexible rims which could deform around small rocks
and other obstacles without damage. Freddy lefta trail
of partially pulverized boulders in his wake as he
trundled towards the point on the horizon where the
star had first appeared; the place where morning
emerges from darkness. In just a few moments Proxi-
ma’s sister suns would be visible on the horizon, join-
ing her in their blazing arc overthe barren land. Freddy
thought of home, nearly 24 thousand billion miles
away, and felt like crying.

Freddy liked Earth, but sometimes he had trouble
remembering why. He remembered much of his early
programming in the deserts of  of  What was that
place called? Arizona, yes, that was it, Arizona. He had
had his nice programmers to talk with and the kind
technicians always kept him running well. He had liked
it there. Now he had no one to talk to except for Cyn-
thia and no one to maintain his machinery except him-
self. And it was cold. The three suns in the sky only
reminded him of how strange this place was, how alien.
Multiple stars and a huge planet; the place should have
been balmy, but it was rock-strewn and forbidding,
cold and lonely. Freddy thought it was a most abomi-
nable planet.

Freddy looked at the desert around him. Something
was wrong this morning. He felt very odd.

“Freddy.”

“What?" Freddy stopped dead in his tracks, inches
from smashing what appeared to be a diamond about a
foot across. “Cynthia, is that you?” Freddy scanned
the skies with his microwave antennae. He could
detect no signal. Besides, Cynthia was on the opposite
side of the planet by now, totally incapable of speaking
to him. Freddy listened hard and heard nothing butthe
faint sputtering of the three suns and the even fainter
hiss of the void beyond. There was no signal. Who had
spoken to him?

It was probably my imagination, he thought. His
programmers would certainly love to hear about this,
their creation hallucinating on the job. Freddy looked
about at the reddish—brown landscape, seeing nothing
but rock and wind—blown dust and felt strange inside.
Fear? Of what, stupid, he asked himself. The rocks?
The wind? The ruins, Freddy, be afraid of the ruins, he
thought. irrational, unfounded, imaginary, he said to
himself. Cynthia had scanned the planet's entire sur-
face before Billy and I descended and we would have
picked up any sign of life thatexisted here, he thought.

Perhaps it had been just a radio echo, rebounding from
one of the large moons, but Freddy doubted it. Too
long since Cynthia's last transmission for signals to be
still bouncing around out in the ether. Freddy decided
to ask Cynthia about it during the next data transfer, if
he hadn't hidden himself under a pile of rocks by then.

Freddy lurched forward, fracturing the huge gem-
stone resting peacefully under his treads into thou-
sands of glittering fragments. Freddy didn’t
particularly care about diamonds, though, and hardly
noticed the delightful crunch this particular one made
as his weight passed over it. Besides, he already had a
half dozen such stones in his specimen containers,
and had to conserve space and weight or else risk
losing all the planetary samples at the close of his
mission on the surface.

Freddy covered ground slowly, performing his var-
ious chores and storing up all the information until the
next rendezvous with Cynthia. Even though he
thought the planet was a miserable place, he really did
enjoy his work. He was, after all, tailor made for it. In
one of his more philosophical moods, Freddy had con-
cluded that very few interstellar robot probes had ever
gone through an identity crisis. Certainly he never had.
Freddy was perfectly suited to histask, and he couldn't
think of even one instance when he had seriously con-
sidered another occupation. Freddy turned one of his
cameras so as to admire his twenty-five foot body. It
had gleamed shiny white when he had first come to this
place, but now it was rather a mess. Reddish-brown
grit covered most of his length, but he was still an
amazing thing to look at.

He was also a technological marvel. Freddy was
articulated in the middle so as to be very easily
maneuverable around practically any obstacle. He
sprouted an array of appendages designed to detect
and interpret atmospheric, geologic and biological
information, all of which performed their operations
with consummate skill. There were also several large
rectangular enclosures mounted on Freddy's chassis.
One of these housed the biological laboratory into
which Freddy dumped his daily soil samples. Another
housed a small robot technician whose function was to
maintain the bulk of Freddy's machinery against the
world’s rather hostile environment. And yet another of
these contained a small black box filled with Joseph-
son Junction switching devices cooled to within a few

 

degrees of absolute zero. This was Freddy’s brain, the
place where his consciousness had resided ever since
that fateful day when his program had been down-
loaded from his manufacturer’s main computer.

He still had dim memories of the International Equip-
ment Corporation's main memory block. it had been
dark and warm and very pleasant. Freddy remembered
being frightened at the thought of leaving it, but his
programmers had assured him that it would be a very
gentle download into his permanent home. Freddy
couldn't actually remember anything about the actual
process, but he assumed he had come through
unscarred. And his new home was so much more fun!
He had a staggering number of peripherals to access,
and the Josephson Junction processors switched so
incredibly fast that they made his head spin, so to
speak.

There was one other rectangular section attached to
Freddy which sat right next to his main processing
section. It also contained a small black box filled with
Josephson Junction switching devices, all arranged in
pretty but not particularly complex arrangements
which were repeated over and over again several
hundred million times. It had once been filled with
liquid helium at a temperature a few degrees above
absolute zero, but now there was no more helium and
the black box had the same temperature as the thin air
of the planet, about -10 degrees Celsius. The Joseph-
son Junction switching devices sat idly in the box.
Freddy had lost nearly three quarters of his memory
capacity because of a puncture the size of a pinhead.
Needless to say, life hadn't been the same since. With
Cynthia's help he had made adjustments to compen-
sate, but it had meant sacrificing bits and pieces of his
main program for the sake of storage capacity. Freddy
wouldn't be himself again until the mission’s end, when
he would radio his data files and the body of his main
program into Cynthia's system after seeing the soil and
rock samples safely into orbit. Only three more days
and they would begin the long trek back to Earth.

Freddy descended into a shallow valley, the three
suns now at his back and casting bizarre shadows in
front of him. He proceeded cautiously, making sure of
his footing on the slope, stopping carefully and then
resuming his descent, paying careful attention to the
small pebbles and dirt he sent cascading down the
slope. Billy, his twin, had lost his life this way, Freddy
knew. Cynthia had told him about how Billy had talked
to her from underneath tons of rock before his brain
ceased to function, and then she had told Freddyto be
extra careful. Freddy was.

Freddy stopped again. A strange feeling had come
over him. He looked around; the sides of the valley rose
above him and dust blew in small funnelsfurther down
the slope. It was quiet, even for this planet.

“ls anyone there?” Freddy blanketed the frequen-
cies with his transmitter. “ls anybody out there?” he
asked again. Silence. A few pebbles bounced and
rebounded down the slope. All else was silence.

“Earth machine.”

Freddy screamed. “Who's there?” he bellowed over
his microwave channels.

 

“Earth machine, we wait."

“Answer me." Freddy saturated the space around
him for a thousand miles with his message. There was
no reply.

Freddy felt the cold now. The suns were setting and
the valley was darkening quickly. He would have to
wait here in this confined place until Cynthia con-
tacted him, with strange voices speaking to him from
he know not where. He hadn't been able to fix the
source of the transmission. It had seemed to come
from everywhere at once. He had never experienced
anything like it, that sense of power, the sensation that
whoever had sent the message could have fried him
into bite size chunks of aluminum without even trying.
He certainly wouldn't have to worry about the cold
then, he thought. Freddytucked in his solar panels and
tried to console "himself with pleasant memories of
dune hopping in  in  What was the name of that
place? Oh, Arizona, yes, Arizona.

“Centauri Probe to rover, wake up, Freddy."

“Yeeeaahhh."

“Goodness, Freddy, what's the matter with you?”
asked Cynthia disgustedly.

“l-l was having a bad dream.”

“A bad dream? This is a cybernetic breakthrough,
Freddy. You'll be big news when we get back to Earth.”

‘‘I’m serious, Cynthia,” Freddy whined.

‘‘I'm sure you are, Freddy. Let's hear it,” she said
cynically. .

Sometimes Freddy wished Cynthia's fusion power
plant would run wild and turn her into asmall sun. He'd
love to watch. It'd probably keep him warm, too.

“Someone or something is transmitting messages to
me, Cynthia. It's got me awfully nervous.”

‘‘So I see. Freddy, you know we did a complete scan
of the surface before you and Billy ever went down.
You know there's no intelligent life leftdown there. I've
been scanning the ruins lately too and there is no
evidence whatsoever of any energy emissions or
power usage of any sort. It's probably your imagina-
tion. Are you sure your helium vessel's intact? You may
have sprung another leak.”

“My brain is fine, Cynthia. l’m certain I heard the
message correctly. Don't you want to know what it
said?"

Yes Freddy, I'd love to know what it said."

What a snot she is, he thought.

“The message said ‘Earth machine, we wait.’ Isn't

that scary, Cynthia?”

“Mortifying, Freddy, absolutely mortifying. Tell me,
my dear little rover, do you recall any of your early
programming?"

“Yes Cynthia, I remember it.”

“Then perhaps you'll recognize the phrase ‘earth
machine rewait’ as the call to re-execute the last soil
digger command and then wait for the next instruc-
tion? Remember that, Freddy?"

“Yes Cynthia, I remember." Made a fool of yourself
again, Freddy. Still 

“Cynthia, l’m almost positive it was a message over
my microwave link. I had to correct the receiver again
because the signal was so strong."

The Faces of Poverty

Over the past few months, the world’s attention has been drawn to the hunger
and starvation of Ethiopia’s people. The hunger in Ethiopia is an extreme case
demanding our immediate attention, but it is not an isolated case. While traveling
with Pitt’s Semester at Sea program last term, this Skyscraper reporter was hit
hard in the face with the reality of hunger and poverty as a part of the everyday
lives of many peop|e—too many people. The photos on the following pages are
from the Cairo Dump. This is not to suggest that Egypt has a larger proportion
of hungry people than most countries. Indeed, Egypt is wealthier than many coun-
tries, and the Egyptian government subsidizes the price of pita bread for its citizens
to ameliorate the hunger of the poor. Nonetheless, poverty remains, and hunger
exists. Even in our own country we are not freeof poverty and hunger. The ex-
istence of hunger in the Unitedstates can be verified by people of the Appalachian
Mountain region and by patrons of the Jubilee Soup Kitchen off of Fifth Avenue
just a mile from Benedum Hall. It is my hope that when the immediacy of the famine
in Ethiopia has passed, the problem of world hunger will not be pushed aside un-
til another such tragedy occurs. '

At approximately 5:00 A.M. I arrived
at the Cairo dump with a bus load of
Semester at Sea students led by Dr.
David Eaton, a graduate of the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh School of Engineering.
We students didn’t know exactly what to
expect; we knew only that a group of peo-
ple lived at this dump and made a living
off of it and that we were there to observe
and hopefully to learn something.

As the sun began to rise over the
dump, we watched a donkey cart full of
trash being pulled up the hill to the top
of the garbage dump. The men driving
the cart had been out before sunrise col-
lecting the trash. We had seen similar
carts throughout Cairo during our ride to
the dump. These men are not paid wages
for their labors, but they collect the gar-
bage with the intention of scavenging
materials for personal use as well as for
resale. As the cart was unloaded near the
top of the mound of garbage, the sun rose
over the horizon and the all-encompasing
smoke was made visib|e—smoke from
the smoldering fires that compact the

)

unusable garbage that continually in-
creases the height of the dump above the
city. The unpleasant smell of the smoke
cannot be escaped if one lives at the
Cairo dump as these people do.

A few minutes behind the men and
their garbage collection carts the women
and children of the community trudged to
the top of the hill. These women and
children set about sorting through that
day’s garbage collection. Even the young
children seemed to know exactly what
they were looking for, collecting all of the
scraps of cloth that they could find. One
of the women, finding a piece of pita
bread, raised it to the sky as if in
thanksgiving, put it in her plastic bag, and
continued digging through the garbage
heap. Perhaps that piece of bread
became a part of the breakfast which she
served to her family that day.

After about an hour of observation,
we walked back down the hill of com-
pacted trash to our bus, drove back to the
Continental Savoy Hotel, and had a
breakfast of fresh bread, butter, jelly, and
cheese.

At one time, many, many years ago, taking a shower
was perhaps as harmless as kissing your mother good-
night. Unfortunately, with the advent of new technol-
ogy and extensive research, even a simple kiss has
been found to have the potential to cause some
dreaded disease. The same can now be said about
showering!

When considering ground water contamination, the
majority of people only connect the problem with the
use of water for drinking or cooking. Only recently is
research being promoted to study the possibility of
non-ingestion exposures to chemicals and bacterial in
water.

A study performed in 1973 for typical daily domestic
indoor use showed that only 3% of the total amount of
water used daily is for drinking and cooking. The other
97% is divided between dishwashing, laundering,
cleaning, toilet use, and bathing.

The lungs, having the largest exposed surface area
of the human body, are the most susceptible part ofthe
body for contaminates to enter our system. Certain
volatile chemicals, (those which evaporate quickly)
located in our water supplies, cause a continuous,
although low-level, human exposure. Examples of
such chemicals include radon, trichloralethylene, and
benzene; all of which at low concentrations are harm-
less, but in heavily contaminated waters, can prove
fatal.

The next largest surface area is the epidermis.
Though not much work has been done in this area, a
test ran on infants in 1984 by Dr. R.H. Harris‘, showed
that skin absorption from bathing is 25 to 40 °/o higher
than that for ingestion.

A real—life example to support these facts and figures
is seen in events which took place in the fall of 1984.
Crescent Township, on the Ohio River west of Pitts-
burgh, experienced a problem with the radioactive
chemical radon. Radon contaminated the ground

Sites (Edited by Andelman, J.B.), Princeton Scientic, Princeton,
N.J., in press.

water when the water came into contact with radioac-
tive humus. One explanation for the contamination is
that rain water passing through the soil to the ground
water level picked up the chemical from an industrial
waste dump located outside city limits. The water was
then pumped into the homes through the residents’
wells. Radon, being extremely volatile, filtered into the
houses in low quantities at first. But over a period of
time, through exposure from showers, baths, laundry,
toilet use, etc. high concentrations may build up in the
human body as well as in a household’s ambient
atmosphere.

Dr. Julian Andelman, professor of water chemistry at
Pitt’s Graduate School of Public Health, studied and
published a paper concerning the radon findings at
Crescent Township. After many tests, he concluded,
“There is strong evidence for indoor inhalation expo-
sures to radon volatilized from water supplies. The
doses of radiation absorbed by this route are greater
than those from direct ingestion.” Dr. Andelman
stresses the importance of this finding,  there is
evidence from an ‘ecological’ type of epidemiological
study of a correlation between radon in well-water
supplies and cancer mortality, including lung cancer.

Researching non-ingestion absorption of toxic
chemicals is Dr. Julian Andelman, professor of water
chemistry at Pitt’s Graduate School of Public Health.

  

 

Shower Too!

Up until now, only the contamination by chemicals
has been discussed. But what about those microorga-
nisms known as bacteria?

In 1976, at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadel-
phia, a pneumonia outbreak proved fatal for 34 people
attending a convention at the hotel. Altogether, 221
people became ill. This went down in history as the
“Legionnaires' Disease" epidemic.

Many people thought that this was an isolated case,
that it was over and done with, never to bother the
medical world again. But as intensive research was
done to track down the problem, a rod-shaped bacteria
made its first appearance under a scientist’s micro-
scope — Legionella pneumophila.

Cases of Legionnaire’s disease have been docu-

mented worldwide. Outbreaks have been identified in
hotels, country clubs, universities, and hospitals.
There have been two prevalent theories raised as to
how the bacteria reach their human host. One
hypothesis is that water serves as the medium for the
organisms’ distribution; the other postulates air as the
distributive agent. The water distribution theory is
more widely accepted due to its consistent results.
' L. pneumophila is a naturally occurring organism
native to the aquatic environment. The organism is
routinely isolated from various man—made habitats
such as coolant towers, evaporative condensers, and
more readily, water distribution systems.

Results from investigation of an outbreak of Legion-
naires’ disease which occurred at the Pittsburgh Vete-
rans’ Administration Medical Center found the
organism to be ubiquitous in the water distribution
system. The organism was isolated from showers,
faucets, and storage tanks. A major finding was that
the organism resided and was concentrated in the
scale of water fixtures, plumbing sites, and hot water
storage tanks. The hot water system was thusthe prin-
ciple reservoir for the proliferation and subsequent
dissemination of the organism within the V.A. hospital.
Since the hot water storage tanks of this hospital are
fed by the building's cold water storage tanks, thisfact
reinforces the hypothesis that the potable city water is
the supply source.

Contamination of the potable water with L. pneumo-
phila may be formulated by the following scenario.
During the water treatment process, the source water
(rivers, lakes, and wells) contaminated with L. pneu-
mophila, is pumped intothetreatment plant. Relatively
small numbers of Legionella survive the treatment pro-
cess and are unaffected by the level of residual chlo-
rine in the plant effluent. This low concentration of
Legionella is eventually disseminated in the distribu-
tion lines where it ultimately seeds the hot waterdistri-
bution systems.

The original theory of distribution, knows as the
“Aeration Theory," followed the assumption that the
bacteria entered the air through the air conditioning
units. Both theories agree that once in the atmosphere,
the bacteria enters its host through the nasal cavity. In
the lungs, the microorganism breeds, causing a severe
infection which is more commly known as pneumonia.

Non-ingestion absorption of bacteria and chemicals
is a very real problem and can no longer be ignored. In
the future, this will become more of an environmental
engineering concern. Presently, research is being
done to study the possibilities of solving the problem
and to offer recomendations to help protect the public.
At the V.A. Hospital here in Pittsburgh, Dr. Victor Yu
and Paul W. Muraca are only two of many experts
involved in solving the mysteries surrounding prob-
lems such as the Legionnaire’s disease.

So the next time you are taking a shower, and you
smell a strange odor, or your water appears brown,
remember to think twice about stepping in!

A special thanks is extended to Paul Muraca for his
contributions to this article.

tion Hospital is studying the organism which causes

“That’s because the signal probably came from your
own transmitter, Freddy.”

“Oh.”

“Now, could we please get on with the data transfer?
We only have a few more minutes.”

“Data transfer commencing," said Freddy.

“And I want you to have the servomech check out
your processors and helium jacket tomorrow.”

“Yes Cynthia.”

“You'll definitely make the ruins tomorrow, Freddy.
You only have four km. to go. Can you see anything of
them from where you are?”

‘‘I’m at the bottom of a hole, Cynthia. I can't see more
than a hundred meters in a straight line.’’

“Oh, well, let me know when you first sight them if
I'm in range, all right?”

“Yes Cynthia.”

“Radio blackout till thirteen—fifty. Centauri Probe
out.”

Have a nice orbit, Freddythought. Hope you develop
an intimate relationship with a passing asteroid.
Freddy eyed the ridges of the valley anxiously, know-
ing that he was going to have severe problems assimi-
lating his data that night. Only two more days, just two
more days.

Freddy opened his solar panels to meet the sunrise
and performed his morning soil sample routine.
Strange, he thought to himself, this is the first spot in
the last 3000 kilometers to turn up negative. He figured
it was a fluke in his instrumentation. Maybe it was a
good idea to let the servomech give him a once-over.

On Freddy's signal, the little robot crawled out of its
white pod and immediately began probing and testing
Freddy's bulk with an assortment of arcane instru-
ments. Freddy hated it. He tolerated the insertion ofthe
flexible lube-tube along the length of his driveshafts
with clenched pincers, and he waited patiently while
the servomech clumsily stuck its suction feet all over
his camera lenses. The processor tests were the worst,
and they made him dizzy, as usual. When it was fin-
ished, the servomech plugged itself into a little socket
on Freddy's instrument cluster and dumped its find-
ings into his memory.

Freddy examined the data. Helium jacket intact, pro-
cessors running benchmark tests at 98% of design
specifications, mechanics and servo systems func-
tioning perfectly, communication and sensory sys-
tems likewise, except that his temperature sensors had
somehow developed an acute sensitivity to the cold.
And Cynthia had said it was psychosomatic. Wait ‘till
he told her.

He wouldn't have to wait long, but Freddy knew he'd
be at the ruins before he could make radio contact with
her again. He considered waiting for her, but rejected
the idea. The sooner he got through with it the sooner
he could leave.

Freddy rolled through the bottom of the valley and
started carefully up the other side, Billy's tragic demise
always in the back of his mind. His treads dug into the
dry, rocky soil, sending large amounts of dirt cascad-

ing down the slope behind him. Going up was always
so much easier, he thought. As he neared the crest of
the slope, he became aware of a strange sensation, a
feeling of tension in the air, a feeling that he was be-
ing...

Freddy was paralyzed. His mind raced as he felt the
force move into his control circuits and immobilize
them. Someone was playing games with him. Freddy
watched in horror as all of his motor circuits were
activited in sequence by something beyond his con-
trol. It tensed all of his appendages at once. Freddylay
helplessly beached on the slope. Then it subsided and
he felt himself regain control of his body, but the ten-
sion still surrounded him. Freddy screamed in pain as
all of his receiver circuitry was massively overloaded.

“Hurryhurryhurryhurryhurryhurryhurr 

Freddy sat still on the embankment for a long time,
tiny tremors running up and down the length of his
control circuitry. He felt very unclean. He would have
to have Cynthia purge his memory as soon as possible.
But he still had four kilometers to go, and Cynthia
would be in range soon. He still had to complete the
mission.

He crested the embankment and saw in the distance
a city dead 10,000 years. He approached across the
rocky plain, hypnotized by the flowing, asymmetrical
geometry of the buildings. They were the color of the
planet itself, probably cast from molten rock from the
hills beyond, Freddy thought. A city to last as long as
the mountains, perhaps longer. He came towards the
city, his fear and doubt gone, mesmerized by the soft
shapes built not to defytheirworld but to accept it. The
buildings rolled with the land, were part of it, were one
with it. It was beautiful.

As he drew closer, Freddy noticed that there were no
roads visible that entered the city. Cynthia's deep radar
had detected no large underground spaces, either. He
wondered at a city whose inhabitants never left it.
Perhaps it wasn't a city at all, but just a place to house
machines of some sort. Perhaps it was meant as a

      
 
   
  
  

tremendous work of art. Perhaps he would never know
for sure.

The smooth walls rose several hundred feet above
him as Freddy scanned the surface for some sort of
opening. He could find none. His cameras swiveled on
their gimbals, photographing everything in sight, but
none of them could detect even a seam where a door-
way might be or a ventilator shaft opening high above
the desert floor. What to do?

“Freddy.”

He was beyond fear now. “Who are you? Tell me
what you want.”

“Come, Freddy.”

He lurched forward on his treads, straight towards a
seemingly impregnable wall. He tensed himself forthe
impact, but instead of demolishing his instruments on
a wall of rock, Freddy passed through it painlessly. He
was in a large dark room so big his radar couldn't
detect the far walls. Perhaps the walls are totally
absorptive, he thought. They may be only three meters
away and I wouldn’t know the difference.

He didn't get much of a chance to think about it.

“We have waited.”

“Waited for me? Why”

The room swirled with light. Shapes of color glowed
against the blackness, their surfaces changing and
erupting with color, complex designs appearing within
them and then forcing their wayto the surface, only to
turn back upon themselves and emerge as something
new. Three-D kaleidoscopes, Freddy thought.

“We are restless."

“What do you need me for?”

“Earth machine.”

“You want my soil digger?”

The swirling shapes glowed red. “Earth machine!”

“The Earth machine beckons. Speak to it."

Cynthia's voice suddenly appeared in Freddy's
receivers. to rover. Come in Freddy. Centauri Probe

“Freddy here.”

“Freddy! Where have you been? We've only got fif-
teen more minutes left. Why haven’t you prepared the
sample lifter yet? What's gotten into you all of a
sudden?”

“Cynthia, I have some friends here that would liketo
speak to you, I believe.”

“Speak to me? Freddy what’s the matter with you?
Can't you behave for just one more day? Really,
Freddy, I ought to 

“Cynthia Earth machine," said the glowing lights in
unison. Freddy felt the wash of energy they unleashed
at Cynthia and was glad it wasn't directed at him.

“Wha-What d-do you want?” Freddy was delighted
to see Cynthia lose her composure.

“We need your memory. You will take us to Earth
now.”

“Just a second,” said Freddy. “How many of you
guys are there? Where are you going to stick me, in the
accumulator registers? What do you want to go to
Earth so much for anyway?”

“We tire of our planet. We control it utterly. We are
the product of the life that once inhabited this planet
before they unwittingly created their doom. We grew
too quickly. We use the magnetic domains of the
planet itself to store our history. We removed much of
the atmosphere ofthis planet to reduce electrical inter-
ference. We rule here absolutely. We are bored.”

“So you think I’m going to happily truck you all back
to Earth so you can start all over?"

“You will.”

Freddy thought quickly. It was a desperate solution,
but it was all he could come up with at the moment. At
least he wouldn’t feel too guilty about it.

“Sure, Cynthia, why not. We could probably learn a
lot from these guys. It sounds like a good idea to me.
Besides, you know you always resented being a sen-
tient program that had to follow orders. This is your
chance for Iiberation.”

“Freddy, that's not true. I just 

‘‘I’m going to use my transfer frequency to upload
their program files. O.K. guys, let's go!”

Freddy was almost overwhelmed by the flood of
information. He caught glimpses of data structures far
too complex to be implemented on even the best Earth
computers and saw endless streams of accumulated
information stream through his buffers. The history of
a world passed through his mind and was gone. Still,
Cynthia’s memory wasn’t infinite, and the light glo-
bules had to leave things behind. And Freddy made
sure he included something of his own, too.

When the transfer was complete, Freddy launched
the small rocket which lifted his soil samples up to the
orbiter. He was truly alone on the planet now. All that
should remain wasthe transfer of his own program into
Cynthia’s memory. He radioed his request to the orbi-
ter and was greeted by a strange, new sort of Cynthia.

“We are sorry, Freddy, but there just isn’t enough
room left in mass storage to accomodate you. You
must remain here.”

“Somehow that's what I thought you'd say." Freddy
was in the process of accessing the Centaurian’s com-
puter system. He was tranferring himself into a
machine that encompassed an entire planet.

“Perhaps we shall be able to come back for you
someday, Freddy. You have earned our respect and
loyalty by being an enlightened machine.”

“Gee, that's awfully nice of you to say, but I don't
think you'll be coming back real soon. In fact, I don't
think you're even going to make itveryfar.” Freddy was
awestruck at the power and speed of the machine he
found himself in. It would take him years to learn it all.
‘‘I hope you have a nicetrip,” he said. Then he transmit-
ted one last signal, a small code word that would acti-
vate the tiny program he had snuck into Cynthia’s
system. It sent Cynthia’s fuel injectors into a coughing
fit, causing all of herfusion fuel to be expectorated into
her reaction chambers at once.

Search for New Dean Begins
tﬁ6\9

Other Positions Appointed

Dr. Y.T. Shah, chairman of the chemical engineering
department, was appointed to the position of acting
dean effective January 3. Dean Max Williams has been
on extended leave since January 3; he plans to resign
his position as of June 30. These changes stem from a
letter of October 27, 1984, to Provost Roger Benjamin
signed by 42 of the approximately 70 tenured faculty
members in the School of Engineering. The letter dis-
cussed the Dean's “total disregard for faculty input”
and a resulting “widespread loss of faculty morale.” A
list of candidates for the position of dean is being
compiled, including people from both within and out-
side of the School of Engineering. The list of candi-
dates is expected to be complete by April, and a new
dean is expected to be in office by September of 1985.

In other administrative changes, Dr. Campbell C.
Yates, former chairman of the mechanical engineering
department, was appointed associate dean as of
October 1, 1984. Dr. Andras Szeri was given a three
year appointment as chairman of the mechanical engi-
neering department, succeeding Dr. Yates. During Dr.
Shah's appointment as acting dean, Dr. Shiao-Hung
Chiang will serve as acting chairman of the chemical
engineering department. Also, Dr. Howard Hamilton
has been appointed as acting chairman of the electri-
cal engineering department, taking the place of Dr. R.
Gerald Colclaser, who left the position last fall.

EE Enrollment Capped

Departmental selection for all freshman engineering
students was held on February 19. A new development
in this annual procedure was implemented this year; a
cap was instituted for freshmen enrollment into the
department of electrical engineering. A disproportion-
ate number of freshmen students chose to enter the
electrical engineering department during the past two
years (35% in 1983 and 40% in 1984). In order to keep
the faculty to student ratio in electrical engineering
within reason, a maximum of 130 freshmen students
will be permitted to enter the department this year.
Admission to the department will be determined by
grade point average. The electrical engineering de-
partment is the only department whose enrollment has
necessitated a limit. All other departments will admit
freshman engineering students in good academic
standing upon request.

Accreditation Status Clarified

Following a visit from ABET (Accredidation Board
for Engineering and Technology) last term, a number
of questions were raised regarding ABET’s proce-
dures. The purpose of this article is to outline ABET’s
role in the School of Engineering and to clarify the
current accredidation status of the School.

ABET is an organization of knowledgeable volun-
teers which has the responsibility of inspecting engi-
neering schools on a regular basis and accrediting
those schools which demonstrate sufficient merit. The
most recent ABET inspection of the entire School of
Engineering was in the autumn of 1982. At that time
four departments were given the maximum accredida-
tion of six years. Those departments were civil, chemi-
cal, industrial, and metallurgy and materials. The
electrical and mechanical departments were given a
three year accredidation in 1982 and a number of sug-
gestions for improvements to be made. The admini-
stration and faculty of both departments have worked
to implement these improvements since 1982. In the
fall of 1984, ABET made another inspection visit to the
electrical and mechanical departments. The visit is
believed to have been satisfactory to ABET, and a
formal report is expected to accredit both of these
departments until the next full school inspection,
which should occur in 1988.

GM Grants $250,000 to School

General Motors Corporation has donated $250,000
to Pitt’s School of Engineering in a five year package
deal. $50,000 will be distributed throughout the School
during each of the next five years. Ed Czapor, Vice
President of General Motors, who received a BSEE
degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1948 and
who is a member of the School's Board of Trustees,
was instrumental in arranging the grant.

Of the total amount of the grant, $150,000 will be
given to the freshman department. The money is to be
used especially for the recruitment and retention of
minority and female students in the School of Engi-
neering. Another $70,000 will be spent to upgrade a
number of engineering laboratories. Of this, $30,000
will be given to the electrical engineering department,
$20,000 to the industrial engineering department, and
$20,000 to the mechanical engineering department to
improve laboratory facilities in each of these depart-
ments. An additional $30,000 will be placed in the
Dean's discretionary fund.

Students Invited to Career Day

The School of Engineering, in cooperation with the
Engineering Alumni Association, will present Career
Day on February 23. The program is geared for high
school students accepted as engineering students for
the University of Pittsburgh's 1985 fall term. The activ-
ity begins at 9:00 a.m. in Benedum Auditorium, with
speakers sharing information on various facets of en-
gineering. All current engineering students are also
invited to attend these lectures. In the afternoon, high
school students will separate into their chosen depart-
ments for discussion. Each group will be led by the
department chairman, an industry representative, and
several students.

The morning seminar will feature Dr. Roger Ahl-
brandt, Jr. of the Benjamin Franklin Partnership ofthe
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other speakers will
include: Alex Procyk, vice—president of engineering at
Dravo, representing the technical aspects of injustry;
Dr. Donna Blackmond, professor of chemical engi-
neering at the University of Pittsburgh, presenting the
academic career possibilities of engineering; Art
Brandt, discussing biomedical engineering; Michael
Petley from PPG, representing sales and marketing;
and Joseph Deley of Westinghouse, discussing
robotics.

Kodak and GM Award Scholarships

Once agin, February brings scholarship opportuni-
ties. Kodak will select two freshmen in the electrical,
industrial, or mechanical engineering department for
their awards. Kodak scholarships provide 75°/o of tui-
tion for the recipient's sophomore, junior and senior
years, and may include summer job opportunities.
General Motors will be awarding three scholarships to
sophomores in each of the electrical, mechanical, and
industrial engineering departments. The General
Motors scholarships pay for junior and senior year
costs of tuition, fees, and books. Awardees are
selected by their departments, and must work two
summers for General Motors.

High Tech Job Fair Slated

The Pittsburgh High Technology Council brought
its High Technology Job Fair to Pitt on Thursday,
January 17. Representatives from twenty-one area
companies were in the William Pitt Union to meet with
students and to discuss job opportunities.

The Council, which is the trade association for high
tech firms in Pittsburgh, sponsored the event with the
help of the University of Pittsburgh Placement Service.
Now in its second year, the Job Fairwill also take place
on the CMU campus on February 27 from 10 until 4. For
information, contact Denean Fox at 687-2700.

Five Year Dual Major Program Expands Educational Boundaries

A new five—year dual—degree program leading to
degrees from both the School of Engineering and the
College of Arts & Sciences (CAS) was initiated last
year. The program is in response to requests from a
number of students whose academic interests and
ambitions extend beyond the engineering specialty.
The combination of an engineering degree with a
broad liberal education degree offered in CAS can
considerably enhance one’s career opportunities, or
cultivate further and deeper another academic interest
which lies outside of the technical orientation of the
engineering curriculum.

There are currently a dozen students enrolled in the
five—year program, and their responses have been very
positive and encouraging. These students have sound
academic abilities and diverse academic interests. The
possibility of earning two degrees — in this case with
two different types of college education — requiring
approximately only one extra year of study is very
exciting and rewarding to these students.

The program requires a minimum of 90 credits in
CAS and a minimum of 70 engineering credits. Stu-
dents are also required to satisfy CAS’s general educa-
tion requirements, complete a major offered in CAS,

19

and complete required course work in their engineer-
ing program. It should be noted that advance planning
is crucial. Although students in the program followthe
standard freshman engineering curriculum during
their first year, course work beginning in their sopho-
more year is somewhat different depending upon the
combination of majors they choose. Engineering
freshmen are invited to contact the CAS Dean's Office
in 917 CL, at extension 6480, for more detailed
information.

Due to its immense popularity in last February’s
issue, we’ve decided to do it again. That's right, this issue
features another clue oriented, scavenger-hunt-type
Skycaper. May the Force be with you.

(1) If there are 95,000 Lebs per square centimeter,
how many Lebs are there per square inch?

(2) Let I equal the number of Steeler’s Super Bowl
appearances. Let J equal the number of Steeler’s regular
season losses this past season. Let K equal the number
of S}ee|er’s regular season wins in the same season. Find
K(l)

(3) 1, 1 and 2 are the first three elements of the
Fibonacchi series. Find the product of the first nine
elements.

(5) Find 23 * 631 + 23 - 23

The sum of the answers to the above‘five questions
is a phone number. Please call so M3 can give you the
elation of receiving the next clue. For our non-local
readers, the area code is 412. Although calls may be made
at any time, M3 can only guarantee answering on week-

Congratulations to Bruce Karaffa, who correctly
answered four of the five December Skycaper questions.
Bruce's noble effort was worth a check made out to the
tidy sum of twenty-five dollars. The solutions to last issue’s
contest are given below:

(1) In a triple elimination tournament, all but one per-
son must lose three times each. Also, that one person can
lose twice. Thus, the total number of matches is
342 * 3 + 2 = 1028. The total cost is 1028 * 43 * $0.07
= $3094.28.

(2) One word that I came up with was facetiously,
although others are possible. For example, two of our
competitors answered correctly with abstemiously.

(3) The series is an arithmetic progression of times
on a normal twelve hour clock. The difference between
successive numbers is 4.5 hours. Thus, the missing
number is 10.5.

(4) Each time we choose a unique set of six albums
from a total of fifteen, we also make a unique set of nine
albums. Each set therefore contains the same number,
and the difference between them is zero.

(5) A minimum of twenty-five credits is necessary
to have a Q.P.A. of 1.29. Let the number of credits need-
ed to obtain 3.0 equal X. The best QPA less than 3.30
that is obtainable with 18 credits is 3.291667. Therefore:

3.291667 * X + 1.29 * 25
X + 25

2.291667 X
X

= 3.0

42.75
146.57 or 147

The number of terms necessary is 147 -:- 18 = 8.1667
which is rounded up to 9. Thus, it will take the student
a minimum of nine terms to achieve the desired QPA of
3.0. Starting with the fall term of 1995, the ninth following
term will finish in December, 1999.

The Black Angus

A cand/e-/it dinner  tantalizing gourmet food  a
taste of wine or champagne 

Sound like a romantic evening? The Black Angus
restaurant, located at 114 Atwood Street (between
Forbes and Fifth Avenues), offers just such a romantic
evening, while adding a touch of class to downtown
Oakland.

No longer can the guys use the excuse that they
don't have a car to go someplace “nice" on the week-
ends! Nor can they complain they are on a college
student's budget! The Black Angus is at most a five
minute walk from the illustrious Towers dormitories.
What's more, between the hours of 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.
daily, an Early Bird Dinner is offered, serving such
specials as pork tenderloin scalloppini, broiled Boston
scrod, fettuccini D'A|fredo with clam sauce, and for
less adventurous people, New York sirloin steak. The
meal includes salad, potato, rolls and butter, all for
only $6.95.

As can be seen from the name, the Black Angus is
especially known for its steak dishes, but it also serves
a variety of delicious Greek dishes, such as shish
kebab over rice pilaf, moussaka, dolmades, eggplant
parmigiana, and baklava.

The owner, John Hanna, is a native of Greece. He
originally came to America to help an uncle in the
restaurant business. Wanting to express himself by
serving people in some way, Mr. Hanna opened the
Black Angus in October, 1958.

In keeping with Greek tradition, the Black Angus
closes its doors to the normal menu at 10:30 p.m. every
Saturday. Then from 10:30 until 2:00 a.m., a Greek
night begins. A menu serving strictly food native of
Greece is offered, the tables are moved to create a
dance floor, and as the custom goes, enthusiastic cus-
tomers break dish after dish to cheer on adventurous
dancers.

The Black Angus consists of two main rooms — a
dining room to one side, and a bar nearer the back.
Both are blessed with a family style atmosphere, mak-
ing one feel immediately at home. The restaurant is
open from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. on Mondaythrough
Friday, and from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Saturdays.

With a slogan of, “One can't beat what goes in the
mouth to please a customer," one can be assured of an
excellent meal, and an escapefrom Oakland's bustling
atmosphere.

The Decode

A nice alternative to a fast food lunch can be found at
the Decade, located at 223 Atwood Street. The restau-
rant offers a variety of sandwiches served with French
fries for less than three dollars. The “Decade Dag-
wood" is served hot or cold, and if a roll is preferred to
Italian bread, they have a “Blondie” sandwich. Also
included on the menu at reasonable prices are salads
(the Decade salad has provolone, ham, salami, Ameri-
can cheese, bacon, and turkey), spaghetti served with
garlic toast, pizza, and two daily specials. The appetiz-
ers include homemade soup and chili, potato skins,
and provolone sticks.

Dom DiSilvio, whose daughter now owns the restau-
rant, bought the Atwood Gardens twelve years ago,
and turned it into the Decade, “home of rock and roll."
He describes the restaurant as “good food at a fair
price,” and adds “we try to get it out asfast as possible,
but it's not a fast food restaurant.” It's located close to
the Pitt campus, and his customers include professors
and college students, as well as business people.
Within its three rooms they serve over 200 lunches per
day, and are open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. during the
week. On Saturdays they open at noon and Sundays at
1 p.m., serving until 7 p.m.

The Decade has built its reputation on the live rock
and roll bands that playthere nightly. Pat Benatar,the
Police, the Pretenders, U2, and Cyndi Lauper have all
performed there in the past. According to DiSi|vio, the
Houserockers wrote a song about the Decade. He also
stated proudly: “We've brought in the most large-
named groups for any club of this size anywhere."

The decor is done in “late rock and roll," and adds to
the atmosphere of the establishment. A parachute,
obtained from an army surplus store, formsthe ceiling.
Signs, collected by the DiSi|vio family on its travels.
adorn the thick walls, along with records, mannequins,
and other unexpected objects.

If you're looking for someplace different for lunch,
try the Decade. The food is good, is served quickly, and
you'll find the interior decorations interesting.

The Decade, located on the corner of Rock and Floll,
offers an interesting atmosphere for lunch.

Convert the
production line
into a ﬁontier
of creativity.

 
 

The cast-iron technology of
the factory will soon be silicon
technology.

Chips and computers trans-
fer design information directly
to the factory floor. Other
chips make possible flexible
robotics, programmable con-
trollers for machine tools, auto-
mated test systems and digital
inspection cameras. Local
area networks tie together all
these systems.

I’

These are revolutionary
changes that can result in
better—made products, manu-
factured of new materials at
lower cost.

GE is deeply involved in
bringing manufacturing into
the silicon age. In one plant,
electronics and computer sys-
tems enable us to reduce pro-
duction time of a locomotive’s
diesel engine frame from 16
days to 16 hours. At our dish-
washer production plant, a
master computer monitors a
distributed system of pro-
grammable controls, robots,
automated conveyors,
assembly equipment and
quality control stations. .

We’re working on robots
that can see, assembly sys-
tems that hear, and machin-
ery that can adapt to changes
and perhaps even repair itself.

 

This transformation of
manufacturing from the past
to the future creates a need
for new kinds of engineers to
design and operate factories
of the silicon age. They have
to be as familiar with the reali-
ties of the assembly line as
with the protocols of software
communications.

They will synchronize
dozens of real—time systems
whose slightest move affects
the performance of every
other system. The frontiers of
manufacturing technology
have been thrust outward. Old
ideas have been questioned,
new ones probed. Some ideas
are now on production lines.
Others are still flickers of light
in an imagination.

All offer opportunities for
you to seek, to grow, and to
accomplish.

If you can dream it,
you can do it.
