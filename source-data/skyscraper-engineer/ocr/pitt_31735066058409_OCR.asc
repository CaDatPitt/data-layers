               THE

  ALUMINUM INDUSTRY

WAS BORN ON


SMALLMAN

            STREET


V In 1888, the aluminum industry consisted of one company-
located in an unimpressive little building on the east side of
Pittsburgh. It was called The Pittsburgh Reduction Company.
The men of this company had real engineering abilities and
  viewed the work to be done with an imagineering eye. But
  they were much more than that. They were pioneers ...
    leaders . .. men of vision.
    A lot has happened since 1888. The country ... the
    company . . . and the industry have grown up. Ten new
      territories have become states, for one thing. The total
      industry now employs more than 1,000,000 people-
      and the little outfit on Smallman Street? Well, it's a lot
        bigger, too-and the name has been changed to Alcoa.
        ALUMINUM COMPANY OF AMERICA ... but it's still the
        leader-still the place for engineering "firsts".
          As you prepare to trade textbooks for a position in
          industry, consider the advantages of joining a
          dynamic company like Alcoa-for real job stability
            and pleasant working conditions-where good
            men move up fast through their association with
            the recognized leaders in the aluminum industry.


We have fine positions for college graduate
engineers-in our plants, sales offices and
research laboratories from coast to coast.
  These are positions of responsibility in
  production supervision, plant and design
  engineering, industrial research or sales
    engineering. Right now it may be
    quicker than you think from a seat in
    the classroom to your career with
      Alcoa. Why not find out?
      Your Placement Director will be
      glad to make an appointment for
        you with our personnel represent-
        ative. Or just send us an applica-
          tion yourself. ALUMINUM

  W   ith this issue the Skyscraper Engineer begins its fourth
full year of pubilcation. We are still a very young magazine,
but we are making improvements in our overall techniques
with every issue. We are a magazine by and for the students
of the School of Engineering and Mines, and we have dedicated
ourselves toward doing everything possible for you, the students.
  This past year brought many new and great activities to the
Engineering and Mines Schools. Last October we went to the
ASM convention in Cleveland, Ohio, en masse; then came the
E 8 M dance, the E & M smoker, and finally ENGINEERS
WEEK last spring.
  We still have many things which could be done for the profit
and pleasure of the students. One gigantic step was taken last
summer with the formation of the first Board of Trustees
Committee for Engineering. This was followed quickly in
September with the formation of an Engineering and Mines
Advisory Council. This council (see pages 24, 25 and 26 for
more details) was set up for the benefit of you, the students,
but one should not expect miracles. Things like expansion and
modernization take time. Although the new freshmen will feel
the greatest benefit from the work of the Council, some im-
mediate benefits are to be anticipated for the good of all students
now in school. In ten years, if we were to return to Pitt, we
would probably be amazed by the new buildings, the new equip-
ment, and the new courses being offered Pitt's Engineers. The
engineering education now being offered here at Pitt is as good
as any in the world; however, the aim of the council is to make
it BETTER than any.
  It is up to us, the students and faculty, to give the Trustees
Committee, the Council and the Administration our whole-
hearted support by taking an active interest in our school life;
and showing them that we are also interested in expanding and
improving our school.

* College Engineering groups-large or small-are
invited to visit the Allison POWERAMA in Indianap-
olis, Indiana.
  What is it? The POWERAMA is a permanent ex-
hibit which dramatically presents the story of pio-
neering and progress in power.
  You can spend hours in the big display room and
enjoy every minute of it. For instance ...
  You'll see a model test stand where a miniature
turbo-prop engine and Aeroproducts propeller are
put through simulated tests.
  Or, you can push a lever and start a model jet
plane on its flight and see how much-fuel is required
for take-off and flight.


  Too, you can sit in a bucket seat and actually put
a General Patton tank through its paces on a giant-
sized turntable.
  There are dozens of moving and "talking" dis-
plays . . . displays like the working model of a
portion of the Allison bearing plant-the world's
only fully automatic steel-backed bronze bearing
foundry.
  These few highlights give you an idea of the scope
of the POWERAMA. Class groups or technical so-

   Dr. Fitterer gives his views
on the drafting of engineers
and engineering students.


Dr. G. R. Fitterer


  H G. J. Moseley, a British physicist, was educated
      at Eton and Oxford. He was one of the earliest
to do intensive research on radioactivity. Among other
things, he established the relationship between the
X-Ray spectrum of an element and its atomic number.
He was far ahead of his time, Nevertheless, he was
drafted in the first World War for ordinary sea duty
and was killed in action on August 10, 1915 at the
early age of 28. Britian and the world lost one of its
most brilliant minds and since that time England has
not drafted her engineers and scientists except for
work in their specialized fields.
  This country, however, continues to draft exper-
ienced scientists and engineers because Congress has
not found a means of making exceptions in a democ-
racy such as ours. By the time the present draft law
runs out next June, it is highly possible that we will
have a modified form of Universal Military Training,,
in which some boys will still be drafted for two years
service
  If we are required to defend ourselves ten years
from now, the boys who have been through U. M. T.
may be some use to us as engineers, but if we are en-
gaged in conflict sooner than that, we must rely on
the current supply of engineers and scientists to carry
on the most highly technical warfare the world will
have ever known.
  At the present time we actually have a two year
U. M. T. although it doesn't go by that name. Anyone
who has had an opportunity to observe the situation,
as have the engineering educators, will agree that
under the present situation all engineers are being
drafted before they reach the age of 26. The draft
boards have been letting them receive their education,
then put in several years of industrial work usually
on the military equipment research or development.
Then, just as they are able to make their most valu-
able contributions, they are drafted and usually for
infantry duty.
  Congress, the President, and the Public should be
aroused at Secretary of Defense Wilson's comment at


Quantico, Virginia in June, in which he estimated
that our technological lead over Russia has recently
been cut from 50 years to two or three.
   Recent figures of the Engineering and Scientific
 Manpower Commission indicated that in 1953, 24,000
 engineers received their degrees in the United States.
 Of these approximately 6,000 were in R. O. T. C. and
 many have since been drafted. On the other ha:nd
 Russia graduated 43,000 engineers in 1953 and it. is
 doubtful that they are drafting them for infantry
 service.
   Recent headlines have read as follows:
     "Billion Earmarked for Robot Arms"
     "Ike Breaks Ground for
     First Atomic Power Plant"
     "American Island to be 5,000 Mile
     Target for Guided Missiles"
   How can the services continue to develop these de-
 vices far in advance of the Russians without a con-
 tinuons flow of young Engineers and Scientists?
   There is at least one answer - create a Science and
Engineering Military Reserve in which these special-
lized personnel can enlist for active and or reserve
duty. This would create a known science and engin-
eering manpower pool upon which the various milit-
ary services and defense industries could draw upon
appeal to a civilian - military board. Engineers have
never avoided military duty, and their service records
are well known, In fact, they are highly desired by the
services. Engineers merely feel that if the next war is
to be a push-button conflict they should be per-
mitted to work without interuption in the develop-
ment of technological equipment for the soldier in
the field. Undoubtedly, the infantry is needed, but
it should be equipped with superior weapons. This
can best be done through the formation of a Science
and Engineering Military Reserve as mentioned above.
Our best minds should be utilized for technological
developments and the democratic processes will also
have been served.

   Jet Propulsion, the newest

is discussed from some of its
newest angles.


Thermal Jet Propulsion


              - THE AUTHOR


  Jim Fallon graduated from
North Catholic High School in
1950. He entered Pitt in Feb-
ruary 1951, in the Mechanical
Engineering Department.
Jim's activities are many an1l
varied. He is past editor of
THE SKYSCRAPER ENGI-
NEER, a member of Pi Delta
Epsilon, The Pitt News staff,
The Owl staff, Men's Glee Club,
The Newsman Club, and Pitt
Singers besides being a Fresh-
man Camp Counselor, and Student Chairman of the ASME.
Aside from these, Jim works at the Engineering Research
Division of the University. This is just one of the many arti-
cles Jim has written for THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER


  B  ack around the year 1700, when Sir Isacc Newton
     came to the conclusion that for every action there
must be an equal and opposite reaction,. he probably
didn't have any idea that he would become famous
for such an outwardly simple thought.
  But this statement of a relation of natural pheno-
mena has been the basis for all static and dynamic
problems concerning exerted forces, and has certainly
pointed him out as one of the world's greatest scien-
tists and philosophers. His law has been one of the
cornerstones in the development of the power plant.
  In these power plants, where both action and re-
action exist, it is the action which is most sought for
use and the reaction claims attention only because of
the need .for providing anchorage against it. However,
in one of the newer applications of Newton's law -
jet propulsion - it is the reaction which is used for
motion, and the action is merely an means of provid-
ing it.
  For example, in a gas turbine electric generating

plant, the turbine is securely mounted to the floor to
anchor the forward thrust reaction caused by the rear-
ward action of the jet stream. Naturally, this is be-
cause the function of this power plant is to use the
action of the jet stream to drive a turbine and thense
a generator to transform kinetic energy into electrical
energy. If this gas turbine were not anchored, the
reaction causing the forward thrust would move the
plant forward, using its energy in the form of motion,
or iet propulsion.
  In all forms of thermal jet propulsion (not includ-
ing rockets which carry their own oxygen), air is
taken into a duct, compressed by some means to the
necessary pressure ratio for efficient operation, com-
bined with the fuel, and ignited. The burning gases
then have a greatly increased velocity and are acceler-
ated out the rear of the duct (action) with an ensuing
forward thrust (reaction) causing the duct to be pro-
pelled forward.
  Enclosed in an aerodynamic shape with a fuel sup-
ply and ignition system, this duct can provide enough
thrust to carry an airplane or missle over a consider-
able range at speeds well above the speed of sound.
As an example consider the ram jet (or athodyd - an
aerodynamic thermodynamic duct), the simplest of


                             Courtesy of General Electric Co.
the three basic types of jets.
  Considerable wartime research was spent on this
form of jet propulsion which is nothing more than
a streamlined converging-diverging tube with a fuel
injection and electric ignition system. In operation,
air is compressed by the configuration of the duct,
fuel is sprayed into the duct and combines with the
compressed air and is then ignited. The combustion
increases the velocity and temperature of the air caus-
ing a jet stream which then diverges from the rear
of the duct propelling the body forward.
  This form of propulsion has been applied to heli-
copter rotor tips an a means of driving them, to an
experimental pilotless plane called the "Drone" and
a supersonic craft designed by a Frenchman named
La duc to fly at four times the speed of sound
(Mach 4).
  The chief drawback of the ram jet is the fact that,
when the duct is stationary, the exhaust from the
explosion of the fuel will blow out of the duct in
both directions, hense air must be rammed in to force
the exhaust of jet stream out the rear.
   Because of the ramming effect rieeded, the ram jet
is not self-starting and must be given a high initial
                                 Continued on page 40

Engineering Opportunities With


Editor's Note:    This is the sixth of a series of
articles on some of the industrial giants of Pitts-
burgh, pointing out to students the opportunities
for engineers in Pittsburgh . . .
. . . the future engi!neering center of the world.

  n relating the story of the Pittsburgh Plate Glass
    Company and the life-time career opportunities
it offers graduate engineers we hearken to the advice
given the White Rabbit in the story "Alice in Wond-
erland". Asking where he should begin his story, the
White Rabbit was sagely advised to "begin at the
beginning".
  Thus to understand fully what Pittsburgh Plate is,
and its greatly diversified range of engineering re-
quirements, it is necessary to "begin at the beginning"
and sketch the Company's origin and growth. This is
particularly true with Pittsburgh Plate because the
Company's corporate name does not adequately por-
tray the nature and scope of its activities. The com-
pany is a leading producer in the fields of plate and
window glass, fiber glass, Paints, chemicals, plastics,
and brushes. It also maintains an effective merchan-
dising system of Company-operated sales units.
  A considerable portion of Pittsburgh Plate's pro-
ducts are engineered for specific uses. For example,
curved automobile glass requires the combined skill
of literally hundreds of engineers in both the devel-
opment and production stages. They lead in the de-
velopment of the new "wrap-around" windshields
which are now being used in the latest model auto-


mobiles. The development and production of this
windshield repersents a significant achievement in the
cooperative efforts of engineers and from many fields.
Special finishes and protective coatings are the result
of extensive research and development work by the
companys engineers. Because of the great diversificat-
ion of products and processes there are many op-
portunities for engineers in widely divergent fields.
  Many of the top positions in the manufacturing
divisions ranging from intermediate supervisory levels
to plant and general superintendents, .are filled by en-
gineers and those with special technical training and
experience who come up through the production
organization. This fact, coupled with a firm company
policy calling for promotion from within provides
the engineering graduate who possesses the necessary
training, aptitude, and ability, a solid foundation on
which to build a lifetime career. A number of college
graduates are added to the organization each year
with the intention that these men will develop in
such manner as to enable management to look with
confidence to them to fill the key positions.
  Pittsburgh Plate actually had its beginning in 1880
when John Pitcairn and John Ford built a glass plant
at Creighton, near Pittsburgh. During the first few
years it seemed that this plant, then known as the New
York City Plate Glass Company, like many previous
plate glass plants, was going to fail. The company was
reorganized in 1882 and the name was changed to the
Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company. By establishing a
sound financial and business policy,it became Amer-
ica's first commercially successful plate glass producer.

                                                                       are available for its engineers.

























Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company


  The present Glass Division was the Company's first
operational unit. The second unit was the Merchan-
dising Division which was formed in 1896 to provide
a way to distribute plate glass. It consisted originally
of eight branches in large cities. These merchandising
branches were destined to become instrumental in
the Company's growth and diversification.
  Within a few   years the merchandising branches
added facilities for handling window glass, paint,
brushes, and related items on a jobbing basis. Then

  One of the largest plate glass plants in the world, Pittsburgh
Plate's number 2, 4, and 6 works are located at Ford City, Pa.


over a period of years, the Company entered window
glass, paint, brush, plastics and fiber glass manufactur-
ing and organized its Paint and Brush Division, Fiber
Glass Division, and other units.
  The Company's interest in chemicals dates back to
the turn of the century. At that time it needed a
source of high quality soda ash to manufacture plate
glass. The source was found in the Columbia Chemical
Company which operated a plant at Barberton, Ohio.
In 1920 this Company became the Columbia-Southern
                                 Continued on page 32
  Here at the forming rolls, plate glass begins to take form.
Emerging in a molten state from the melting tank (left) the
glass is formed into a sheet of the desired thickness and width
by the rolls. This continuous sheet then enters the lehr (right)

Piezoelectric Crystals


  In 1880 Jacques and Pierre Curie, of radium fame,
    discovered that when weights were placed on cer-
tain crystals, electric charges, measured by an electro-
meter, were produced proportional to the applied
weight. The converse effect of displacement of strain
caused by an applied voltage was predicted theoretic-
ally by Lippman in the following year and was verified
by the Messrs. Curie.
  "Piezo, a Greek word meaning "to Press", was ap-
propriately applied to this method of producing elec-
tricity to give the word piezoelectricity. These func-
tions of applied pressure-produced voltage known as
the generator function, or applied     voltage-strain
known as the motor function, and some non-pressure
properties. which piezoelectric crystals exhibit, make
piezoelectricity versatile and useful. Piezoelectricity
differs from electrostriction, such as occurs in the
dielectric of a Leyden jar, in that the strain is re-
versed upon reversal of the polarity of the applied
potential.


                    THE AUTHOR


   Andy Revay graduated from New Kensington High School
 in 1951. He came to Pitt that same year to study Electrical En-
 gineering. His activities include: Phi Eta Sigma, Eta Kap-
 pa Nu, The Arnold Air Society,
 Institute of Radio Engineers,
 and the American Institute of
 Electrical Engineers. This is
 Andy's first article for THE
 SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER.


  Several synthetic materials, along with natural
quartz, posses piezoelectric properties. All of these
materials with the exception ot specially developed
ceramics, which are polarized after molding, are cryst-
als. These crystals, the most important being Rochelle
salt, produce the piezoelectric effect because they have
no center of gravity to seperate, causing a strain when
voltage is applied to the crystal in the proper direction.
To get different types of expansion the crystals are
cut on different angles with respect to the axes of
the crystals. Standards for the determination of the
axes of crystals and angle designations have been set
up by the Institute of Radio Engineers. Different
types of possible cuts are, as shown in Fig. 1, Thick-
ness shear, Face shear, thickness expansion and Trans-
verse expansion. Figure 2 shows some piezoelectric
crystals mounting and driving methods. With one end
of a crystals blocked the other end has twice amplitude
of vibration it would have if both the ends were free.
  The first noted application of piezoelectricity came
in World War I when French scientist Langevin was
commissioned to devise a method for detecting sub-
marines. By sandwiching a mosaic of quartz crystals
between two steel plates, which acted as electrodes,
and applying a high frequency voltage, longitudinal
waves were formed which, upon echoing back to the
plates were detected. With a 40,000 cps. applied to a
20 cm square plate, a wave of 5x10 -5 cm amplitude
is sent out and a returning wave of as small an ampli-
tude as 10-10 cm, which is about 1/300 of the diam-
eter of a molecule, can be detected. This was the first

  Applications of applied pressure-produced voltages
are the hydrophone and under water transducer, which
have many thin sheets of crystals stacked together to
reduce impedance." In the accelerometer, a stack of
crystals, with a weight placed on top to increase sen-
sitivity, produce a voltage proportional to the acceler-
ation. Shaking tables are made using a high frequency
voltage to cause many stacks of crystals to deform
cyclically and, therefore, to vibrate a table top which
sits on the crystals.
  By cementing two sheets of crystals with their axes
in different directions, a twisting or bending effect,
caused by the sheets expanding in different directions,
is obtained when voltage is applied. This twisting or
bending effect is analogous to the action of the bime-

and their many uses is given.


phone cartridges, phonograph record cutters, hearing
aids, stethoscopes, and surface roughness indicating
instruments. Crystal elements are sometimes used in
high fidelity sound reproduction systems because they
eliminate the hum often found in magnetic cartridges.
Another unique application of piezoelectricity is the
use of ceramic elements to produce ultrasonic waves.
By forming the special ceramic material into the form
of a bowl with spherical surfaces and applying high
frequency alternating voltage to the inner and outer
surfaces, ultrasonic waves. These ultra-sonic waves
have a multitude of uses such as emulsifying liquids,
accelerating the aging of alcoholic spirits, stimulating
or destroying bacteria, cleaning small parts, mixing
paints and shaking test tubes 50,000 times faster than

    Last March you celebrated, for the first time, an Engineers
Week here at Pitt. That week, which is traditional in many
western engineering schools, enjoyed a much better than ex-
pected success, because of the enthusiasm demonstrated by you.
  This year, again during the week of St. Patrick's Day in
March, you will have another Engineers Week. It can be big-
ger and better than the last one . . . if you demand it, and
if you make it so.
  Last year the week was initiated by a handful of students
who accepted the responsibility, as their own, to start such a
week. If this responsibility is again left to the chance accep-
tance of a few students, there will undoubtedly be times when
there will be no Engineers WVeek. This must not happen!
To insure against such a tragedy, we, the remaining two mem-
bers of the first Committee, have turned over the responsibility
for initiating the week to the E 9c M   Association. We have
clone so under the following terms:
  The E & M Executive committee shall choose the Chairman of Engi-
neers' Week by using their judgement in considering all applications sub-
mitted and a list of possible candidates; and that Chairman shall have the
power to choose his own committee members, as representative as possible
of all departments of the Engineering and Mines School. This Chairman
shall have full power and responsibility in planning and coordinating
the week.
   Both he and his committee, before their appointment, shall be subject
 to approval by Dean Fitterer and a majority vote in the E & M Cabinet.
 With this declaration we take our leave to stand by and ad-
vise the new committee which will immediately be formed.
  Good Luck, and a good Engineering Week.

Dr. Calvert


  D r. John Fyfer Calvert, whose work in the elec-
      trical engineering field has brought him nation-
al recognition became the head of the electrical en-
gineering department at the University of Pittsburgh
on the first of August.
  Prior to his coming to Pitt, Dr Calvert was a pro-
fessor of electrical engineering at Northwestern Uni-
versity since 1938. He was formerly an associate pro-
fessor at Iowa State College.
  Born in Columbia, Missouri, Dr. Calvert entered
the University of Missouri, but was called to active
duty with the national guard after completing one
year of his studies. After serving nine months on the
Mexican border he was shipped overseas where he
participated in three minor and two major engage-
ments in France for which he was awarded the purple
heart, Returning to school, he received the bachelor
of science degree in 1922 and the degree of electrical
engineering in 1924. During the time he was working
for the latter degree he spent one year in the West-
inghouse student course, and joined that company as
an electrical engineer in 1924, remaining until 1936.
  At Westinghouse he designed turbine generators,
propulsion equipment, motors for testing airplane
propellors and high frequency generators. In 1936 he
aided in the rehabilitation of machinery following the
distastrous St. Patrick's Day flood.
  From 1936 to 1938 Dr. Calvert served as consultant
on rural electrification projects for the Iowa State


THE     SKYSCRAPER              ENGINEER


Planning Board and associate professor of electrical
engineering at Iowa State College. He went to North-
western as professor of electrical engineering in 1938
and became chairman of the department in 1939. It
was at this time that plans were made for the new
Technological Institute building there and Dr. Calvert
was responsible for the design and selection of equip-
ment for the electrical engineering department.
  In 1941 Dr. Calvert was loaned to the Navy and
directed the initial construction of a ship demag-
netizing station in Maryland. Later he was in charge
of the design and construction of the Pacific Demag-
netizing Station at Pearl Harbor For this work he
earned a Navy citation.
  Dr. Calvert is a fellow of the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers, a senior member of the Institute
of Radio Engineers and a member of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, the West-
ern Society of Engineers, American Society for Engin-
eering Education, Eta Kappa Nu, Sigma Xi, and Tau
Beta Pi. He was awarded his master of science degree
at Pitt in 1930 and the Doctor of Philosophy degree
in mathematics and engineering in 1936.
  Dr. Calvert has had approximately fifty papers and
technical discussions published and has been granted
six United States patents.
  The University of Pittsburgh is lucky to have a man
like John Calvert to head the Electrical Engineering
department here.

S OCTOBER,

















































   In an all day session on Mon., September 20, at
the University Club the new Engineering and Mines
Advisory Council was formed. The purpose of this
council is to ascertain what is needed in the way of
courses, equipment, and buildings, so that the Pitt
Engineer will need less industrial orientation than
ever before. The council will also assist the Trustees
Committee in developing support to supply the pre-
determined needs.
  The Council is made up of eight committees, with
a seperate committee for each department of the En-
gineering Schools. Each of these departmental com-
mittees is made up of two alumni members, one non
alumnus, and an ex-officio member, the department
head. Each man who was asked to serve on these
committees is a proven leader in industry today. They
each know just what industry needs in a young en-
gineer, both in the way of theoretical and practical
applications in their chosen fields.'
  These men together with the department heads and
the Dean, will review the long term future trend of
each specific branch of engineering and determine
the needs with respect to faculties, equipment and
space necessary to develop the department towards


that goal.
  The men on this committee are men who are looked
up to by everyone in the engineering profession. They
are always on the go, their activities sometimes taking
them all over the world, yet they are taking time to
help Pitt's engineering schools because they know that
Pitt has always produced good engineers, but they
also know that engineering schools need financial and
other assistance to keep engineering education not only
in step with technological developments but out in
front.
  These men feel that they can help to bring engin-
eering ecucation up to date and they have a real
pride in being among the few asked to be on the
charter council. They have great pride in their profes-
sion, and want to foster the same kind of pride in the
undergraduates.
  Pitt's Schools of Engineering and Mines are strate-
gically located for the modernization of engineering
education and steps to do this are now off to a "flying
start". The students and faculty can give considerable
assistance to the Trustees Committee for Engineering,
the Council, and the Administration in this most wel-
come development. (see editorial)























Engineering Advisory Council


  Iwas one of the two students lucky enough to be
    invited to the first meeting of the Engineering
and Mines Advisory Council. I felt that if I wrote
just what went on with my point of view, it would be
easier for the students to understand the possibilities
of this organization.
  I saw and talked to the men who were giving of
their time and energy for the sake of the Schools of
Engineering and Mines. These men really want to
make Pitt the best engineering school in the world
and will work to the best of their abilities to do so.
  To me, the most impressing thing about the council
was the type of men who are working for the good of
us, the student body. Everyone of these men is a prov-
en leader in industry today. If you will take the time
to look over the list of men participating (see page
26) I am sure you will agree with me. Yet here they
were, the "big guns" of industry working with one
purpose in mind; to help Pitt get ahead. Some of
these men came from as far as the west coast to be at
the meeting and were flying back the same night.
They must have a great deal of respect for Pitt's
Engineering Schools to come that far.
  The idea of the Engineering Council was first con-
ceived at Queens College, Ontario, Canada. The im-
provements made there in just a few years were amaz-
ing. They got new laboratory supplies, new professor-
ships, new courses were added and some subtracted
from the schedules, research projects were received,
and there were many scholarships and fellowships


THE      SKYSCRAPER             ENGINEER


added to those already available at the College.
  But lets get back to what the Council can do for
you and I, the undergraduate engineers at Pitt. How
will the council help us? The men who are members
of the Council are all working in the major industries
through-out the country. They know what. type of
education industry feels that young engineers should
have. They feel that if the undergraduates received
a better type of education, less time would be needed
to orientate them when they get their first jobs. If our
labs included more real engineering,work the graduate
would have a better understanding of just what will
be expected of him by industry.
  The Council and Trustees Committee realize that
if more equipment is added to that which we already
have, more space will be needed. A program of ex-
panding the Schools of Engineering and Mines as far
as new buildings are concerned is already underway.
With the completion of the new engineering building
next spring, there will be a great deal more room
or labs and classrooms but before very long even more
room will be needed. Plans have already been drawn
up for an addition to State Hall and the Council and
Trustees have high hopes of starting this addition
within the next few years.
  We the students should be greatly indebted to the
spirited alumni and members of industry who are
doing their best for us, the students of the Schools of
Engineering 8c Mines, of the University of Pittsburgh.

located.
These 116 plants-representing GM's 35 manufac-
turing divisions-provide a wide range of places in
which you, as a young graduate engineer, might be
working.
Each of these widely scattered plants offers the secu-
rity and prestige of the GM name.
On top of that, each division has available to it the
vast research facilities for which GM is famous.
In addition, we offer the scope of an organization
which produces not only motorcars and their acces-
sories, but also jet engines, refrigerators, electronic
equipment, Diesel engines-just to name a few.
And most important is GM's deep-seated respect
for engineering and engineers--the recognition of


creative thinking that means "more and better things
for more people."
You'll find plenty of wide-open spaces at GM if you

QUARTZ


CRYSTALS


How a 14 hour "gem-cutting" operation

     became an 8-minute mechanized job


          -      PROBLEM: Preparing quartz
                 crystals for use as electronic
                 frequency controls calls for
                 the highest degree of preci-
sion. So much so, in fact, that prior to World
War II skilled gem-cutters were employed
to do the job.
  But during the war, there were not enough
gem-cutters to keep up with the demand for
crystals in radar, military communications
and other applications.
  Western Electric tackled the job of build-
ing into machines the skill and precision that
had previously called for the most highly
skilled operators.

SOLUTION: Here is how quartz crystals are
made now-by semi-skilled labor in a fraction
of the time formerly required:
  A quartz stone is sliced into wafers on a
reciprocating diamond-edged saw, after de-
termination of optical and electrical axes by
means of an oil bath and an X-ray machine.
Hairline accuracy is assured by an orienting
fixture.
  The wafers are cut into rectangles on ma-
chines equipped with diamond saws. The
human element is practically eliminated by
means of adjustable stops and other semi-
automatic features.
  The quartz rectangles are lapped automatic-
ally to a thickness tolerance of plus or minus
.0001". A timer prevents overlapping. Finally,
edges are ground to specific length and width


dimensions on machines with fully automatic
microfeed systems.
  'Most of these machines were either com-.
pletely or largely designed and developed by
Western Electric engineers.

RESULTS: With skill built into the machines
-with costly hand operations eliminated-
this Western Electric mechanization program
raised production of quartz crystals from a
few thousand a year to nearly a million a
month during the war years. This is just one
of the many unusual jobs undertaken and
solved by Western Electric engineers.


Quartz stones are cut into wafers on this diamond-edged saw,
with orientation to optical axis controlled by fixture. This is
just one of several types of machines designed and developed
-by Western Electric engineers to mechanize quartz cutting.

  Production of a plug-in decade
resistance unit for use in analog-
computing equipment, circuit de-
velopments and specialized work in
electrical engineering laboratories
has been announced by Telex, Inc.,
national manufacturers of hearing
aids and electronic components in
St Paul, Minnesota.


  Trade named GEDA and design-
ed by the Goodyear Aircraft Corp.
and Telex, the unit was miniatur-
ized  in  the Telex   laboratories
through the use of printed circuit-
ry. Size of the original was miniat-
urized by half. A clear plastic band
has been substituted for the GEDA
label in the photo to show the in-
terior.
  Units are available in four stock
types with maxium resistance value
of I and 10 megohms and 1 and 10
kilohms but can be built to other
specifications if desired. Set resis-
tance value to 1 per cent tolerance
is shown on the unit's three dials,
with the top dial controlling a po-
tentiometer which permits the unit
to be set within 1 per cent of any
range value using a'suitable resis-
tance bridge.
  Housed in a lightweight plastic
cylinder the unit has an overall
length of 4 inches and a diameter
of I 2 inches. The unit is equip-
ped with a jack at the top and two
banana plugs at the bottom; plugs
are on standard Y inch centers.


for F-100 Super Sabres, is sharply
reduced in this sound abatement
chamber on The North American
Aviation flight line. The tailpipe
of the super-sonic fighter juts
through an opening in the silencer
unit where it is fitted with a near-
ly sound-proof asbestos collar.
  Three advanced silencer units for
ground operations of the nations
newest and most powerful jet air-
plane engines have been added to
the North    American  Aviation's
sound abatement system at the com-
pany's fighter assembly lines at Los
Angeles International Airport.
  The new facilities will be used
in ground operations of the F-100
Super Sabre, first production air-
plane capable of exceeding the
speed of sound in normal, level
flight, and for acceptance testing
of its Pratt-Whitney J-57 engines.
  The cost of the system was over
$1,600,000 and the largest of the
three new silencer chambers cost
$261,000. This is the chamber used
in testing the J-57 engines, which
develop 10,000 pounds of static
thrust and are the most powerful
ever developed   by the United
States.


   Air is sucked into the chamber
 and the mouth of the powerful jet
 engine through six inlet silencers
 on the roof of the test facility. The
 openings admit 100 pounds of air
 each second, enough to change the
 air in fifty homes every second.
 When the engine is running at
 full power it is barely audible 250
 feet from the abatement unit. The
 sound of the engine during "run-
 ups" is contained by the chamber's
 three feet thick walls. The walls,
 constructed of corrugated   steel
 plates, one eighth of an inch thick
 and separated by tons of sand, ab-

 A 450 foot long muffler, six feet
 in diameter, catches more of the
 sound and is water-cooled to absorb
 nearly all of the 3,500 degrees of
 heat produced by full power oper-
 ations. An automatic water ring
 sprays 480 gallons of water a min-

 so nearly evaporates the liquid that
 only a few wisps of steam are vis-
 ible from the chamber's exhaust

   General Electric scientists envis-
 ion the TV set of 1964 with a pic-
 ture screen to thin that the com-
 plete unit could be hung like a
 painting on your living room wall.
 The picture would be built into
 the picture frame and would use
 printed wiring and minaturized
 components. Controls would be lo-
 cated in a small box beside your
 easy chair
   Or for those who prefer a table
 model, the thin    picture screen
 would be mounted like a vanity
 mirror, attached to a slender arm
 extending upright from a small
 oblong cabinet which would house
 the circuitry and controls.
   The POW, or picture on the
 wall" TV receiver is just a glint in
 the scientists' eyes at the moment,
 but they are convinced that such a
 unit can be developed and have de-
 signed a dummy receiver to help
 visualize the future TV.
 The plotting board screen will
 be composed of a space matrix con-
 stituted by closely spaced perpe,n
 dicular wire grids huiminescing at
 their intersections to reproduce the
 transmitted picture.
 Development of speedier switch-
 ing techniques and new fast-react-
 ing electroluminescent phosphors
 needed before the POW system
 could be applied to television re-
 ceivers, Dr. DeVore said.
 As explained by Dr. Lloyd T.
DeVore, manager of the G. E. Elec-
tronics Laboratory, the POW vision
of the future stems from develop-
ment work being done on new min-
ature components, and from a com-
plex project underway to speed the
plotting of aircraft in military filter
centers
  At present, this aircraft plotting,
essential to successful interception
of enemy planes, is done manually.
The planes are followed by radar
operations and information fed to
plotters who pin-point the planes
with crayon on the transparent
wall-size plotting board.
  The plotting would be done
automatically with the POW type
board.
  Dr. DeVore says the radar dis-
play system under development will
use electronic computer circuitry
techniques to convert a transmit-
ted signal into an image on the
plotting board

" A Key to K&E Leadership
Projects created by engineers, architects, designers, scientists
start with drawings . . . on tracing paper. Modern needs offered
a difficult challenge . . . to produce a tracing paper combining
permanent strength, permanent transparency and the ideal draw-
ing surface. Albaneneo, the acknowledged leader of quality
papers, has achieved this. Quality is one of the keys to K&E's
eighty-seven years of leadership in drafting, reproduction,
surveying and optical tooling equipment and materials, in slide

Plate Glass                       Continued from page 17
Division of Pittsburgh Plate and in 1951, chemical
operations, now including five plants, were placed
under a self-contained and integrated unit named the
Columbia-Southern Chemical Corporation, a wholly
owned subsidiary. Columbia-Southern today produces
soda ash, caustic soda, chlorine, calcium chloride,
rubber pigments, and a wide range of associated and
derivative products.
  The Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company today operates
35 plants. The Company has 267 merchandising
branches and sales offices serving jobbers, dealers, and
customers from coast to coast. Pittsburgh Plate em-
ploys approximately 30,000 men and women and is
owned by over 16,500 stockholders.
   Men who majored in science and engineering are
offered many opportunities in research, development,
production, engineering, and' technical sales. There
are many positions for graduates with chemical, cer-
amic, mechanical, electrical, and industrial engineer-
ing degrees. Graduates with engineering training but
wishing to specialize in such fields as accounting,
business administration, industrial relations, law, sales,
and purchasing will find opportunities in Pittsburgh
Plates administrative, sales production offices and
staff departments.
   Following are listed some of the major fields in
which the college trained engineer can seek to further
his career with Pittsburgh Plate.
   Research and Development: In addition to the sub-
statial facilities which the Company maintains excluse-
ly for basic research, it carries on research and devel-
opment in all manufacturing divisions. Each division
maintains extensive laboratory facilities which provide
opportunities for many types of engineers.
   The Glass Division laboratories, for example, need


ceramic, electrical, chemical and other engineers. Glass
in its various shapes of forms, is closely allied to many
major fields. This means that engineering needs are
quite broad in nature. In the electronics field exten-
sive programs are being carried on to further the role
glass products play in television, radar, sonar and in
other forms of communication and detection. In the
transportation field, engineers and technitions are
constantly developing new and improved glass pro-
ducts for autos, trains, planes and other forms of trans-
portation.
  Engineering and Design: Ample opportunities are
provided to learn details of Abuildings and equipment
design as actually applied in construction and. pro-
duction operations. Engineering and design functions
are closely integrated with those of research, product-
ion, maintenance and application of products.
  A typical example of the opportunities aflorded
engineers in several fields to utilize their talents was
in the construction and operation of the Paint Divis-
ion's new plants. In the past, paint plants were awk-
ward looking multi-storied structures, depending pii-
marily upon gravity to perform many necessary paint
operations. The modern paint plant is a one or two
story strficture in which the building design, the e-
quipment, and other factors are engineered into a
complete production unit.
  Production: There are many opportunities for en-
gineers in production control, scheduling, quality
control, and production supervision in the Company's
Manufacturing operations.
  This is one of the most interesting fields for en-
gineers, particularly in the Glass Division. In the plate
glass plants, production is on a continuous basis with
glass being produced in much the same manner as
                                    Continued on page 36

        It's America's lifeline, really-the power line
        that starts with steam and brings heat, light,
        and energy to the nation's factories, farms,
        homes and stores. Paralleling that line is the
        line of cost, which America's Utilities have
        striven mightily to reduce over the years. Even
        today, with vast increases in the cost of all
        the things America's privately owned electric
        companies must buy, the cost of electricity
        has not increased in proportion.
        Since 1881, when Thomas A. Edison opened
        the nation's first electric generating station,
        B &W, who supplied his boilers, has pursued
        a fruitful, continuing search for better and
        better ways to generate steam and to harness
        more and more usable energy from      fuel
   1     consumed.
         Economical, dependable service is the watch-
         word of America's Electric Companies. The
         chart reflects how well their all-important job
         is being done. And to help insure that elec-
         tricity will remain America's best bargain,
         B&W Research and Engineering dedicates
                     men, money and machines to
                     continuing progress in steam
   A p               and fuel technology.

How to design a freight car

      one mab can push
You can make a big 55-ton freight car roll so easily
one man can push it. How? By mounting its axles on
Timken tapered roller bearings. Timken bearings
roll the load, eliminate the metal-to-metal sliding
friction that makes old-style friction bearings start
hard. They reduce starting resistance 88%. And, with
Timken bearings, there's no danger of hot boxes
-the major cause of freight train delays.


    TIMKEN' bearings are

  designed to roll the load
As you see here, all lines drawn coincident with the
working surfaces of a Timken bearing meet at a com-
mon point on the bearing axis. This means Timken
bearings are designed to give true rolling motion.
And, since they're tapered they can take radial and
thrust loads in any combination.

steel. It is melted, formed, rolled, annealed, ground
and polished, cut and then processed and fabricated
for various end uses.
   Industrial Engineering: In Pittsburgh Plate's plants,
as well as those of practically all other companys, in-
dustrial engineering is wide in both scope and prac-
tice. One of the basic objectives of industrial engin-
eering is to provide the means and mehods for devel-
oping management personnel for replacements and
for new positions created by technological improve-
ments and expansion.
   In carrying out this one important objective, in-
 dustrial engineering personnel must be trained in
 many special fields, not the least of these is concerned
 with human relations in industry.
   Maintenance: There are key openings for graduates
interested in mechanical and electrical maintenance
work in all major plants. Although this type of work
might not be as appealing as other fields of engineer-
ing, it could be called the "bread and butter" phase.
In glass production, for example, where the molten
glass keeps flowing from the tank every minute of the
day, maintenance is a key problem. The long anneal-
ing lehrs, the grinding and polishing lines, and the
inspection lines, provide a challenge to engineers in-
terested in minimizing the maintenance problem.
  Sales and Sales Service: Technical sales and sales
service positions requiring engineering background are
available in the Company's Merchandising Division
as well as in the manufacturing division's sales units.
These include positions in the consumer, industrial,
and commercial fields.
  One of the more interesting and unusal of the sales
engineer's type of work is in the color field. Pittsburgh
Plate developed a special painting system known as
"Color Dynamics". This system prescribes the use of
color in the industrial field on a basis in which color
can be made to act as an industrial tool. These prin-
cipals have been developed by the Company's own
color engineers in cooperation with leading author-
ities from various institutions. Graduates interested
in this special field are given special training in the
Company's Color Laboratory at Springdale, Pennsyl-
vania.
  Administrative: Many opportunities exist in the
accounting, purchasing, and industrial relations de-
partments. There are also opportunities for careers in
many other administrative and staff departments.
   Development and training programs assist new
employees to integrate college training with actual
job experience and to help them keep abreast of de-
velopments in their particular fields. Although fol-
lowing definite schedules and outlines, this training
is on a non-formalized basis in most of the divisions.
The details and operation of training tactics vary in
accord with the type of work and the individuals con-
cerned.
   In considering a professional engineering career, a
 graduate not only is concerned with the immediate
 future, he also sets his sights on the future. "How
 far and how fast can I proceed with the Company
 which I choose?" is a quite natural question.
   The answer depends largely upon the graduate
 himself. As in no other profession, engineering re-
 quires the individual development of a wide range
 of personal qualifications. Personal progress depends
 upon the extent to which a person develops his abil-
 ities. As can be seen, Pittsburgh Plate provides ample
 opportunity to develop these abilities through on-
 the-job and other training.

B-47 and B-52 jet bombers of today.
   For 38 years Boeing engineers have
blazed exciting new trails in design, re-
search and production. They're blazing
them today in jet aircraft, guided mis-
siles, and research in supersonic flight
and the application of nuclear power
to aircraft.
  If such new-horizon engineering ap-
peals to you, Boeing offers a reward-


ing career, whether you are in civil,
mechanical, electrical or aeronautical en-
gineering, or a related field. Boeing is
expanding steadily, and employs more
engineers today than even at the peak
of World War II. Boeing also promotes

  At Boeing you'll find an unusual range
of opportunity, from applied research to
production design, from work with new
materials and techniques to contacts with
a cross-section of industry through the
company's vast subcontracting program.
Boeing employs draftsmen and engi-
neering aides to handle much routine
work, thus freeing engineers for more
stimulating assignments.

course in 1948, I knew what I liked and seemed best
fitted to do. As a result, my entire time as a GTC stu-
dent was spent in the shops.
  "The 18 months spent in the foundry, erection floor
and machine shop have all proved valuable background
for my present job.
  "As supervisor of plant engineering at the Norwood
Works, I am concerned with such problems as: Plant
layout, material handling equipment and methods, new
construction, new production methods to be used in
building motors, centrifugal pumps, and Texrope
drives. It's an extremely interesting job.
  "From my experience, I'd say, whether you're a
freshman or a senior it will pay you to talk to an Allis-
Chalmers representative now. You can't start plan-
ning your future too soon. And you can't plan starting
at a better place, because Allis-Chalmers builds so many
different products that you'll find any type of engi-
neering activity you could possibly want right here."


Facts You Should Know About the ALLIS-CHALMERS Graduate Training Course


1. It's well established, having been
started in 1904. A large percentage of the
management group are graduates of the
course.
2. The course offers a maximum of 24
months' training. Length and type of
training is individually planned.
3. The graduate engineer may choose the
kind of work he wants to do: design, en-
gineering, research, production, sales,
erection, service, etc.


4. He may choose the kind of power,
processing, specialized equipment or in-
dustrial apparatus with which he will
work, such as: steam or hydraulic, turbo-
generators, circuit breakers, unit substa-
tions, transformers, motors, control
pumps, kilns, coolers, rod and ball mills,
crushers, vibrating screens, rectifiers, in-
duction and dielectric heaters, grain mills,
sifters, etc.
5. He will have individual attention and
guidance of experienced, helpful superiors


in working out his training program.
6. The program has as its objective the
right job for the right man. As he gets ex-
perience in different training locations he
can alter his course of training to match
changing interests.

velocity before it will operate properly. It is also con-
fined to superonic speeds because it is poorly efficient
during subsonic flight. The one great advantage is its
simplicity and the fact that is has a minimum of
moving parts - a mechanical engineer's dream.
  Another type, the resonant duct or pulse jet ap-
peared during World War II and was used very ef-
fectively by the Germans against England in the form
of the "buzz bomb". Also known as the V-1, this missile
was nothing more than a bomb with a puise jet at-
tach to propel it. It was very inefficient but light,
simple, inexpensive to construct, and served its pur-
pose very well. Although few ever hit their target,
the noise produced by the resonent tube was very "dis-
turbing and sent people scattering for shelter, thus
slowing down production at a time when every minute
counted.
  The pulse jet was a resonant-duct ram jet with flap
valves which opened to allow air in and cl&sed when
the burning fuel raised the pressure within the duct,
thus preventing exhaust from leaving both ends of
the duct.
  Following each explosion, a sound wave and hot
gases exhausted from the duct inducing a partialvac-
uum and opening the flaps. More air entered and
mixed with the fuel which was continuously sprayed
in. This cycle was repeated as much as 40 time'sper
second, and after the duct became hot enough, ignit-
ion would take place by residual flame, eliminating
the need for the electric spark.
  The biggest disadvantages were that the duct had
to be of correct length to harmonize the impulse
waves of the explosion with the natural period of os-
cillation of the valves; and that, like the ram jet, it
was not self starting, but had to be launched at an
initial velocity by means of rockets, a catapult, or a
mother aircraft. It is capable of both subsonic and
supersonic speeds depending on the application and
design.
  The third and most complex type of jet propulsion,
the turbo jet, or aircraft gas turbine, makes use of
the same principle of acceleration of the air by the
combustion of fuel in it, but uses an adiabatic ex-
pansion in the duct to impart high velocity to the
products of combustion. This expansion necessitates


a pressure drop of the air. Since the main purpose of
the compression is for increased efficiency, and since
the turbojet duct is not straight thru and does not
compress the air by its geometric configuration alone
as the ram jet, a compressor was installed to increase
the combustion pressure, and a turbine on the same
shaft to drive the compressor.
  Between the discharge from    the compressor and
the turbine entrance, the air is heated and given high
velocity and increased volume by direct combustion
of the fuel. Energy is then extracted by the turbine
to drive the compressor. A sufficiently high energy
level is reached in combustion so that when the tur-
bine work is extracted there is enough energy left to
impart the final high velocity of the jet for forward
thrust of the engine.
  Other types of jet propulsion are the turbo-prop
and the rocket. The turbo-prop is essentially a turbo-
jet with a propellor geared to the turbine compressor
shaft. In effect it just replaces the reciprocating air-
plane engine with a turbojet engine while keeping
the propellor. It does have the advantage of producing
a small amount of thermal jet thrust besides deliver-
ing the needed shaft horsepower to drive the propellor.
  The rocket is essentially a jet, closed at the front
end eliminating the air intake), and carrying its own
oxygen supply for combustion. Although limited in

the rocket has the advantage of being able to travel
in very thin atmosphere (above 70,000 feet) where
other types of jets would have trouble due to lack of
air for combustion.

in the revolution of the aircraft engine especially

looked, for at short ranges, slower speeds and heavier

less counterpart.

  The greatest single advantage of the turbo over
the ram and pulse jets is that it can be started while
in a stationary position by using an external source
of power to turn over the compressor. This advantage
has made feasible its installation in aircraft and it
has proven itself very successful.
  The ram and pulse jets will undoubtedly be re-
stricted mostly to guided missiles with a few appli-
cations to man-carrying aircraft such as the Helicopter
or ultra-high speed fighters.
  The rocket has a tremendous future and it will
someday be the means of man reaching the moon.

Piezoelectric Crystals
man can by hand. But the motor generator functions
of the piezoelectric crystals are not its only ones, for
piezoelectric crystals, due to their solid state physics,
have other properties just as versatile and useful.
  Piezoelectric crystals perform functions which would
make them important even if they did not possess
transducer properties. These functions are electric
storage, optical, electro optical, condenser, and im-
pedance. The electric storage function offers great
promise in the electric computer field. Certain piezo-
electric crystals, especially barium titanate, can be used
in the memory banks where electric signals can be
received and stored away for future use. In the case
of the optical function many piezoelectric crystals
are transparent and double refracting, and because
they give a distinctive color pattern can be effectively
used in gun sights where the color aids sighting. Due
to the superiority of these crystals in ultra-violet trans-
mission, they are used in ultra-violet spectographs.
The electro optical function makes possible the high
speed photography necessary to get pictures at atomic
bomb blasts, by changing the voltage on a piezoelectric
crystal its degree of transparency is instantaneously
changed. If a very short pulse of voltage is applied,
this electric shutter can be "opened" and "closed" in a
much shorter time than mechanical shutters. By using
these crystals as light vales on television cameras and
movie cameras the camerman can regulate the amount
of light pass ing through the lens by changing the
applied voltage. The condenser function of piezo
electric materials has resulted in the small circular
disc condensers used widely in the television field.
These condensers are very rugged, have a high dielect-
ric constant, and possess a very -large capacitance in a
small size. Perhaps the most important non-pressure
function of piezoelectric crystals is their impedance
function. At certain frequencies, because they possess
a high Q value, piezoelectric crystals act as sharply
tuned curcuits. Quartz in particular, possesses this
property. Quartz crystals with Q's of the order of
500,000 are readily available and Q's as high as 6,000,
000 have been measured in the laboratories. Crystals
having high Q's are used in filter and oscillator cir-
cuits in place of fixed tuned circuits. A. M. Nicolson
at the Bell Telephone Laboratories first controlled an
oscillator by means of crystal in 1917. Today, crystals
are used for direct control of frequency in radio trans-

mitting stations. A quartz clock having a vibrating
quartz plate replacing a swinging pendulum gives
time more constant than the best astronomical clocks.
Both Greenwich Observatory in England and the
Bureau of Standards in Washington, D. C., use quartz
crystals as primary standards. During the second
World War in one year the military used 30,000,
000 crystals in communications equipment to con-
trol frequency alone. Crystal filters are used in coaxial
cables to seperate the simultaneous conversations that
go over one pair of wires. In a fully equipped section
of coaxial cable for carrier communication, with 400
circuits, 12,000 crystals are used for channel filters
only.
  Piezoelectricity is certainly versatile, having seven
seperate and distinct functions of motor, generator,
electric storage, optical, electro-optical, condenser and
impedance. With all these functions the applications
of piezoelectricity are unlimited. In this article only
a few of the better known and most common appli-
cations have been mentioned. With the small size of
piezoelectric crystals and the small sized transistors,
and miniaturized circuit components being developed,
much work can be done by the young engineer in
miniaturizing present circuits and equipment, besides
making many new discoveries which will aid mankind.
The ue of piezoelectricity is limited only by the
imagination of the engineer.

slips of the stick


  I had 12 bottles of rare old booze
in my cellar (aged over-nite) and
my wife told me to empty them
down the sink, or else; this is what
happened:
  I pulled the cork from the first
bottle and poured the contents
down the sink, with the exception
of -one glass which I 'drank.
  I extracted the cork from the
second bottle and did likewise, with
the exception of one glass which I
drank.
  I then withdrew the cork from
the third bottle and emptied the
good old booze down the sink, ex-
cept for one glass which I drank.
  I pulled the cork from the fourth
sink, and poured the bottle down
the glass, which I drank. I pulled
one bottle from the cork of the
next drink and drank one sink out
of it, and poured the rest down the
glass.
   I pulled the sink out of the next
glass, and poured the cork down
the bottle.
  I pulled the next cork out of my
  throat and poured the sink down
  the bottle and drank the glass.
  Then I corked the sink with the
glass, bottled the drink and drank
the pour.
   When I had everything emptied,
I steadied the house with one hand,
counted the bottles and corks which
added up to twenty-nine.
   To be sure, I counted them a-
gain as they came by, and this time
I had 74.
  And as the house came by, I
counted them the 'third time, and
finally I had all the houses, bottles,
corks, and glasses, except one house
and one bottle, which I drank.
  It wall all my wife's fault.

THE ENGINEER'S LAMENT
The engineer sat on his high-back-
  ed stool,
Madly plying his compass and rule,
His face was drawn like a window
  shade,
Thinking of drawings still unmade.
"Unfinished Jobs" were piled up
  high,
"One more," he cried", - I'll be
  fit to tie!
When the telephone clanged and
  over the wire
Came the raucous voice, surcharg-
  ed with ire:-
'Where is that,drawing due last
  week?-
Must we drag it out of your hide
  with a jeep?
What are you doing - poker
  playing?
Act like a hen;-come on, start
  laying!"
The Engineer vainly tried to ex-
  plain
But the voice went on AGAIN and
  AGAIN:-
"Those drawings you made for the
  B-2 Chucker,
Played our production line for a
  sucker."
"Cam motions are wrong - they go
  up, not down;
To assemble that mess would take
  a clown.
You can't put a screw where you
  have no stock,
And you can't mill steel that's hard
  as a rock."
And so went the wail till the air
  got blue,
Then our hero put in a word or
  two:-
"Lay off," he cried, -let's have no
  more,
We've heard that song many times
  before."
"They gave us the spec sheets late
  on Sunday,
And wanted the layout finished on
  Monday.
But a month went by before any-
  one knew.
Exactly what the machine was to
  do.
Meanwhile we all had to guess and
  grope
And (do what we could with scanty
  dope.
Till everyone here was a nervous
  wreck,
Then we called you in for double
  check.
You checked each tolerance, you
   checked each fit,
You checked the assembly bit by bit
Each operation on each machine
Got your okay - that's what I mean.
Yet whatever goes sour along the
   line
 Is charged to the engineer's design,


Follow the drawings and go to
  work!"
Here, he hung up the phone with
  an angry jerk.
This job, he sighed, goes from
  brawl to brawl.
As he gazed at the motto on the
  wall
--Which wasn't written by Lyon
  Phelps,

  A motorist at a roadside market
stand, chose a piece of one of those
rare old pungent cheeses.
  As the propietor wrapped his
purchase, his customer asked anx-
iously, "Do you think that cheese
will keep all right until I get home
tomorrow night."
  With a wry smile, the propietor
answered, "Mister there ain't noth-
ing more ever going to happen to
that cheese."


   The moon was yellow, the lane
was bright, as she turned to me in
the night,
  Every gesture and every glance
gave the hint that she craved
romance,
   I stammered, I shuttered, and
time went by - the moon was yel-
low and so was I.




   Two English cockney broom ven-
 dors met on a London street and

 I steals the Wire, anti I steals the
 'andles and I can't sell 'em for a

 And the other replied: "Why, I
 steals them ready made."

CUTS COST

yOUR success as a designer depends
on your ability to keep costs down
on products you design. By properly
applying the principles of welded steel
construction, cost of manufacture can
be reduced substantially because mate-
rial costs are less, actual production is
simpler. In addition, the product is
stronger, more rugged, has modern
appearance.
  The examples show how one designer
has applied the principles of welded steel
to a machine base. The sturdy box-type
construction of the steel design elimi-
nates weight because of steel's greater
strength and rigidity. Considerable ma.
chining, cleaning and finishing of form.
er castings has been eliminated. More
modern in appearance, nevertheless, the
steel design costs 15% less to produce.

       HABIT!

    Your tools of tomorrow should
  be your tools of today. When you graduate and start
  upon your own career you will find that the top
  engineers, architects and designers use CASTELL-
  either the famous wood pencil or LOCKTITE Holder
  with 9030 lead.
    CASTELL is smoother, stronger, lays down greater
  depth of graphite on the drawing. It is uniformly
  excellent in all 20 degrees, 8B to 10H.
    You study in a fine school, taught by outstanding
  professors. Does it make sense to work with inferior
  tools? Order CASTELL, world's standard of quality,
  from your College Store, stationer or art supply store.

 An electrical clutters your living

 With radio carecasses by the score;
 A civil may buy pearls and mink,
 But he can't fix the kitchen sink;
 Mechanicals have grease in their

A chemical's kind, but lord, how

His love words are tender, his pres-

And the company you keep will be

PHOTOGRAPHY AT WORK-No. 10 in a Kodak Series


Photography



took a look4


  and a harvester


got a stronger

   set of teeth


N


John Deere engineers, building a new beet har-
vester, wanted spring-tooth disposal wheels with
long life. High-speed movies showed the way.
The disposal wheels on the new John Deere beet
harvester moved faster than the eye could see.
  So the engineers studied them in action, slowed
down by the high-speed motion picture camera. A
small difference in design resulted in extra-long life
for the spring teeth.
  Slowing down fast action is but one way photog-
raphy helps product design and manufacture. With
x-rays it searches out hidden faults in castings, welds,
and assemblies. And by photographing cathode ray
traces, it discloses the causes of improper operation.
These are but a few of the ways photography saves
time, reduces error, cuts costs and improves pro-
duction.
  Graduates in the physical sciences and in engineer-
ing find photography an increasingly valuable tool
in their new occupations. Its expanding use has also
created many challenging opportunities at Kodak,
especially in the development of large-scale chemi-
cal processes and the design of complex precision
mechanical-electronic equipment. If you are inter-
ested in these opportunities, write to Business &
Technical Personnel Dept., Eastman Kodak Com-
pany, Rochester 4, N. Y.

With the high-speed motion picture camera, John Deere
engineers took pictures of their spring-tooth wheels in
action at 3000 a second. Projected at the standard
16 frames a second, the motion was studied, slowed
down to almost 1/200 of its actual speed.

    WAX WORKS...
    Until a few decades ago, the principal users of wax
    were the candlestick makers. Today's diversified de-
    mands for wax put it in the class of modern industrial
    miracles.
      Go into a super-market ... see how wax works in
    the packaging and protection of milk and dairy prod-
    ucts, cereals, bake goods, frozen foods. Think of its
*   use in drug and cosmetic products ... cups, crayons
    and carbon paper . . . polishes, preservatives and
    paper matches ... And the number of industrial ap-
    plications defies accurate calculation.
    TOO BIG FOR BEES...
    The ancients knew the physical properties of wax ...
    and bees supplied the raw material. What then
    spurred this century's growth in production to more
    than a half-million tons a year?
      The answer lies partly in the petroleum industry's
    desire to find more profitable applications for one of
    its'products ... partly in the desire of other industries
    to improve their processes and products.
    AMERICA WORKS LIKE THAT...
    Here, industry is paradoxical. It is independent, yet


dependent. . . cooperative, yet competitive. It strives
to make more money, yet is always seeking ways to
keep costs and prices down.
  And, to further these aims, management relies on
the constant flow of information available through
America's all-seeing, all-hearing and reporting Inter-
Communications System.

THE AMERICAN INTER-COM           SYSTEM...
Complete communication is the function, the unique
contribution of the American business press . . . a
great group of specially edited magazines devoted to
the specialized work areas of men who want to man-
age better, research better, sell better, buy better.

COMMUNICATION IS OUR BUSINESS.. .
Many of the textbooks in which you arenow studying
the fundamentals of your specialty bear the McGraw-
Hill imprint. For McGraw-Hill is the world's largest
publisher of scientific and technical works.
  After you leave school, you will want to keep
abreast of developments in your chosen profession.
Then one of McGraw-Hill's many business magazines
will provide current information that will help you
in your job.

GROW


To a young man looking for opportunities,
perhaps the most important fact about a
company is its rate of growth, present and
prospective. In a company which has become
static, advancement is largely dependent on
vacancies occurring through death or retire-
ment. In a growing company, new openings
for able men are being created constantly, and
advancement is restricted only by ability.
  Since 1925 the chemical industry has grown
at an average rate of about 10% a year, com-
pared to 3% for all industry. Future growth, at
a more rapid rate than the rest of industry, is
predicted by authoritative studies.
  Columbia-Southern is growing not only in
response to increasing demand for its present
products, but also as a result of the steady
development of new products. The company's
management firmly believes in the importance
of research and development and has given
evidence of that belief by expanding research
facilities and increasing research and develop-
ment budgets.
   Columbia-Southern's growth is an open-end
process; as goals are reached, new goals are
set. Even now new products and processes
are in every stage of evolution, from nebulous


ideas in the minds of research chemists to pilot
plant operations and production plant designs.
That's why Columbia-Southern needs men
who can grow with it.

This is a Torrington Needle Bearing

     Designed for Today's Needs and Tomorrow's Trends-

Needle Bearings Offer A Unique Combination of Advantages


The Torrington Needle Bearing has
two component parts-the full com-
plement of relatively small diameter,
thru-hardened, precision-ground
rollers and a case hardened retain-
ing shell by which they are held.
  The bearing is a complete unit in
itself, and is easily pressed into posi-
tion in a bore machined to proper
dimensions. The advantages of this
unit construction in simplifying in-
stallation and speeding assembly
are readily apparent.

    High Radial Capacity

Of special importance is the high
capacity of the Torrington Needle
Bearing. This efficient anti-friction
unit can carry a greater radial load
than any other bearing of compar-
able outside diameter due to the
large number of rollers. The small
cross section of the bearing allows a
large shaft which permits a rigid de-
sign with minimum shaft deflection.

     Efficient Lubrication
The method of lubrication is an-
other feature of the Torrington
Needle Bearing. The retaining shell


with its turned-in lips provides a
natural reservoir for the lubricant.
Thus the needle rollers turn in an
oil or grease bath and continually
bring up a fresh film of lubricant-
insuring rotation of all moving
members on a fluid film.
