’ It is the story of resources . . . human, natural and financial, with many chapters yet
to be written. Today, Ebasco engineers no longer conquer the wilderness, but rather
complement it. Old ways just won't do: mankind's demands for power are too
great. 1985 will see the need for electrical power systems three times the size of present national
systems. . . a startling 955 million kilowatts of capacity. [:1 The Ebasco engineer will be—-
. . . . as always—in the forefront of the effort-fossil fuel, hydro, and especially

Ebasco, he works in an atmosphere of professional and technical excellence that fosters creative

growth and individuality. As Ebasco has grown, his position has not only been maintained, but enhanced.

WE'VE COLLECTED TEN FAMOUS (CON) ARTISTS To INSTRUCT YOU.

Photos by: Dan Laughman

Yes, that's right! Ten of the most experienced clowns in the
field to aid and instruct you as you become a qualified Sky-
scraper staff member. Now those of you who wasted two or
three terms of college studying can make up for lost time —
right in your own home! No need to worry about your educa-
tion or your social life; enjoy the privileges of being on top!

Here's what S.C.S. can do for you:

(1) Staff meetings at our less-than-spacious office! Paint-
smeared windows, purple walls, and old wooden desks en-
graved with classical profanities dating back to 1946 all com-
bined in a modest, tasteful decor. Senior members are even
allowed use of wastebaskets and, in special cases, the latrine
next door.

(2) A Skyscraper office key pass! Members holding this
pass may enter and leave at all hours. Compete with the clean-
ing people in the never-ending ripoff contest! (Last term a lucky
contestant walked away with our AM-FM stereo radio.)

(3) The Skyscraper telephone credit number! Make phone
calls to Istanbul or Pismo Beach, California at no charge! Plead
innocent to any obscene phone calls.

(4) Exciting drama and high intrigue! Be in on the action
when the staff is held to account for missing petty cash,

Find yourself a place in all of this! Just look at our
Famous Ten:

Dick Beswick — sort of edits the magazine, promotes ill-
will whereever possible, sells soft pretzels on street
corners on weekends;

Dave Syskowski —— guardian of the vault, is now on the
Riviera visiting Mitch Pines, the high-living former
business manager;

Jeff Pierce — does layout work and helps fudge petty
cash accounts, plans to open a roast-beef sandwich
chain in India called the "Sacred Cow";

Scott Morse — the original ‘cat burglar’, lives in his two-
room apartment with l,7OO felines of all varities, has
absolutely no sense of smell;

Dan Laughman — photographer, general office nuisance,
usually seen at night atop the tower dorms photo-
graphing the nocturnal activities of coeds in the Quad
dorms;

Don Miller — owns the ratty apartment where we hold
our paste-ups, lives off the deposit money he gets
from old wine bottles;

Joan Fitzpatrick — writes occasionally and sleeps with
her feet against the wall, used to be a dancing in-
structor until she hurt her back while biting her
toenails;

Bob Bretz — drowns cartoons and flies, picks his nose
when no one is looking;

Felix Sciulli — sold his '52 Nash to buy a 35 mm camera
which he uses to keep food stamps in, often roams
around campus with ill intent;

Henry Hunziker —— thrown out of Penn State in '65 for
stealing doorknobs in the dorms, thrown out of C.M.U.
in '66 for attacking a meter maid with a folding chair,
entered Pitt in '67 on full scholarship, plans to be a
cab driver upon graduation.

The small space big sound.

About the only thing missing in the average
guy's pad is space. And good stereo.

That’s because lt’s hard to pack a big stereo
sound in a small space. And big jobs take up so
much room you have to throw out half your li-
brary or pile it on the floor.

Which is why you should check out the new
Sylvania ACS 12WH. Big sound. Small size.

Big sound from two globe speakers you can
swivel and turn to get the best stereo balance for
your room. Each one has a four-inch extended-
range air suspension speaker that sounds as
good as conventional ones two sizes larger. Yet
they’re small enough to fit on the shelf right next
to “War and Peace.”

The solid state AM/FM/FM Stereo receiver
fits on a shelf, too. It's less than a foot deep and
only five inches high. But it's still big on features.
Like a Field Effect Transistor FM front end.
Ceramic Filter |.F. Strip. Fifty watts of peak
music power.

If space is really tight, just stack the turntable
right on top of the receiver. It'll work great any
place you put it because it's a BSR Micro-mini
with a diamond stylus.

Put it all together and it'll fit on one two—foot
shelf. For about $200.*

How's that for no-space age living?

‘Manufacturer's suggested retail price for Model ACS12WH is $199.95.

editorial

The New Industrial State is on trial in Pitts-
burgh. The Skybus trial in front of Judge Anne X.
Alpern presents a striking similarity to the publica-
tion of the Pentagon papers. They both provide in-
sights into how major decisions are made for the
people without regard for the people or reality. The
story that is partly unfolding on the witness stand
reveals the web of conflict of interest and influence
peddling between the corporate managers and
machine politicans that bypassed unbiased engineer-
ing analysis and the will of the people.

How did Pittsburgh get the Skybus system? A

number of years ago, Parsons, Brinckerhoff, Quade
& Douglas were hired to determine what transit sys-

tem would be best for Pittsburgh. One of their pos-
sible choices was Skybus but they ruled it out as not
any good for Pittsburgh. They were fired. Westing-
house Electric was hired to determine what would be
the best transit system for Pittsburgh. Westinghouse
Electric chose the Westinghouse Electric system,
Skybus, which has been rejected by ever major city
that has considered it, the system that was rejected
by the only independent engineering study of Pitts-
burgh’s transit needs.

To see who was in on the “deal” for Skybus, lets
look at who will benefit from the construction of the
skybus sytem. Part of the rationale for building the
Civic Arena and Three Rivers Stadium was that they

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER—FEBRUARY,1972

the s/eybus caper

were necessary facilities for a city attracting cor-
porate headquarters. Something that is also nec-
essary for a “corporate headquarters city,” is a rapid
transit system to the corporate bedroom (the South
Hills). So the large corporations with their head-
quarters downtown, think that the Skybus would be
good for them. The purchase of this rubber tired
vehicle would also keep Westinghouse Electric from
losing money spent on developing the technology.

999

It is the “Skyscraper s policy not to mention
persons’ names when criticizing, but with the help of
the local papers you can fill in the blanks.

The men who are forcing this transit system on
the city of Pittsburgh form a network that connects
the peaks of county government, city government,
the news media, appointed boards and industry. The
members of the Port Authority Transit Board
(political appointments) are almost all top men in the
biggest companies in Pittsburgh. The Chairman of
the PAT Board is also vice president of a major oil
company that has its headquarters in Pittsburgh. He
also was campaign treasurer for one of the
Democratic County commissioners. The Pittsburgh
papers have spread their pro-skybus editorials to the
front page. It should be noted that the firm that han-
dles the public relations for PAT also handles 90 per
cent of the advertising for the major Pittsburgh
papers. And the connections go on and on; the
engineering company hired by PAT to manage the
project has a history of doing business with Westing-
house Electric.

There is not enough time to discuss all the
engineering problems to be resolved. Most of the
problems the system will have probably haven’t
cropped up yet. We’ll find out about them once it
starts operating in all weather with passengers. One
of the major pipe dreams of the system is that it can
be operated without a driver. I don’t know of any
city transit system with exclusive right-of-way that
couldn’t be automated and run without a conductor
if it weren’t for three things: drunks, kids, and
weather conditions on the tracks. None of these
problems have been solved by either Skybus or any
other system, but these have been ignored. The Sky-
bus hasn’t been tested extensively in the snow yet.
They’re planning to run unmanned rubber tired ve-

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—FEBRUARY, ‘I972

hjcles at twenty second intervals, at forty miles per
hour speeds, up and down hills, in the snow? After a
few sliding accidents and a few kids get knocked off
the tracks, and they have to put on drivers, the sys-
tem will be incredibly expensive. One driver will
probably be needed for every 27 passenger vehicle.

What should we call -this sytem — rapid transit
or mass transit? A street car following the same
route, making the same stops, could make the 10-
mile run in the same time. That isn’t exactly rapid.
Each car is designed to carry 27 people and during
peek periods they will run at twenty second intervals.
Each of our six elevators in Benedum Hall
can hold 27 people and during class break one will
stop at every floor about every thirty seconds.
People on the lower floors have to wait for up to five
elevators before one comes by that they can squeeze
into. A system with a capacity similar to that of the
Benedum Hall elevators certainly can’t be called
mass transit for Pittsburgh.

Skybus might turn out to be a good transit system
for Pittsburgh, but when unbiased engineering
analysis is ignored the odds are against it. It could be
years before all the bugs are worked out of the sys-
tem. Problems crop up under full operating condi-
tions that don’t show up in tests. The only other city
that has a system vaguely comparable to Skybus is
Montreal with its rubber tired transit cars. A month
ago, one of their cars had an electrical fire which
ignited the rubber tires while it was in a tunnel. The
driver was killed in the fire. (The story was ignored
by the Pittsburgh papers.) Going through Wabash
Tunnel could be murder, but we won’t find out until
the system is working full time under all weather
conditions.

The primary problem being faced in the Pittsburgh
area is not whether we will have a rubber tired or
steel wheel system. The significant problem is are the
people of the city going to have to buy a system
whether they want it or not? Is objective engineering
analysis and the will of the people going to be
ignored so that we can provide a technology welfare
system?

ON PRODUCTIVITY
By Dean H.E. Hoelscher

There is no subject of greater concern in
Washington and throughout the nation than our
rapidly deteriorating position in world markets of
manufactured goods. This concern falls under a gen-
eral rubric sometimes labeled “productivity en-
hancement.”

Isuggest that this problem does not derive from
our national capabilities in science, mathematics and
related subjects, or the engineering sciences. I sug-
gest also that there is no reason to focus on our man-
agement skills either as the culprit or as the source of
corrective measures to our deteriorating technical
capabilities in the basic industries. I suggest, finally,
that the problem is twofold, with both facets related
to the present technical structure, performance and
dynamics of our national basic industries.

First, I believe that we are falling behind in the
realm of specific technical skills which relate to basic
industries — paper making machines, textile mills,
automobile manufacturing and the like. In some
fields we still retain technical superiority — and a
“market” — but even this appears to be in danger in
the near future. For example, our present superiority
in the field of aircraft manufacturing derives from

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER—FEBRUARY, I972

. from
the

dean

superior maintainability of our products, not from
any intrinsic structural performance characteristics
of them.

Generally, areas like this are considered the
nuts and bolts, the nitty-gritty of our industrial
system. As such, they are less than glamorous and
are not very “sexy” subjects. Unfortunately, but true,
such things usually make the difference between an
economically competitive industry and one that in-
evitably must lose out in terms of productivity and
world markets. Unless we continue to emphasize and
develop our strengths in these fields and begin to de-
velop strengths relating to the technical base of our
basic industries, we will continue to fall behind the
world market, and our national economy will in-
evitably suffer.

A second factor is our need to begin to consider
the performance and the growth characteristics of
systems of industries in regions of our country. In-
dustries interact with one another, and it is not pos-
sible to affect one industry without affecting all of
them for good or bad. Our skills in this “systems” ap-
proach to our industrial structures are woefully
weak. If we are to continue to increase our economic
growth and our exports, we must begin to take a
much larger view of industrial problems. These fac-
tors should receive the attention of our School in the
months ahead.

tbe politics and economics of
mineral exploration and exploitation

Dr. John D. Ridge, head of the Department of
Mineral Economics at Penn State University, was in
Pittsburgh on Jan. 27, to deliver the Henry Krumb
Lecture sponsored by the AIME.

Henry Krumb, who died in 1958, was a pioneer
in the application of engineering practices to mining.
He was Vice President of the AIME from 1928-1942,
and established a fund for AIME to be used in the
best interests of the minerals industry. From this
fund have evolved the Krumb Lectures which allow
prominent engineers and scientists in the minerals
industries to address AIME sections across the
United States on subjects pertinent to engineering.
The title of this year’s lecture was “The Politics and

_‘ Economics of Mineral Exploration and Exploita-
’ tion.

9!

Dr. Ridge entertained his audience with a little
globe trotting to some mineral rich countries of the
world — Chile, Peru, Canada, Australia, South
Africa, Rhodesia, Mexico, and Brazil. At one time it
was relatively easy for the United States to send
geological exploratory missions to these countries.
Having made a substantial discovery, it was then
feasible to negotiate with the source country and ob-
tain a concession. Times have changed, however,
and with them the political and ideological attitudes
of these nations. He cited Chile as being a good
example. Shortly after Salvador Allende attained
power in Chile two years ago, he made good his pro-
mise to nationalize the country’s industries. He
followed through by expropriating the three
American mineral companies. Compensation over
thirty years was promised but was nullified by the
excess profit tax imposed on the outstanding debts of
these countries. In light of these actions, it seems
doubtful that American minerals companies will
have future opportunity to explore in Chile. Mean-
while, sale of Chilean copper to the United States
continues through a marketing company in this
country. Peru has also expropriated an American oil
company and imposed strict regulations on new min-

». ing rights. Political conditions there are far from

conducive to American investment and exploration.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER-—'FEBRUARY,1972

Dr. Ridge noted that both Canada and Australia
are favorable politically and geologically, although
there are problems in these nations also. In the past,
the Canadian economy has been greatly enhanced by
U.S. mining investments, but lately there has been
disilussionment among Canadians with having many
important economic decisions made in New York.
Recent recommendations of a Royal Commission to
study taxation have also made Canada less attractive
to American investment. In Australia, the boom
resulted from mineral developments, but cutbacks
on iron ore purchases by Japan and possible removal
of lead from gasoline are currently creating night-
mares for Australian economists and politicians. It is
forseeable that the Australian government will
implement new laws regulating minerals companies
and security exchanges. Nevertheless, both Australia
and Canada are possible sites of future mineral
exploration.

South Africa remains endowed with vast
mineral resources. However, the disadvantages
inherent in investment in a country plagued with
racial problems are obvious enough especially when
the ruling whites are outnumbered four to one by the
black South Africans. This is a nation doubly divided

the space technology to come

by frcmcis glenn gm/yam

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Francis Glenn Graham is an aerospace
engineering student, a Marxist, and an outspoken
advocate of a new social order of things. “If you can-
not imagine a better world,” he says, “you might as
well shut your coffin lid now.” His future plans
include writing and working on programs for the
“good of all”.

Abstract

In this article the author (1) gives argumentative
thought to demonstrate that the exploration of space
is by no means over; (2) presents intelligent specula-
tion as to what future space programs may be, based
on a broad economic theory. The time range for
these speculations are the whole range of the 21st
century, and references are given at the end so that
the reader may enjoy the article without
interruption.

Changing Motives

Transcending the petty social structures in the
late. 20th century is man’s endless desire for new
horizons to explore. If the United States, for exam-
ple, had lost World War II, the Nazis would have
been on the moon now. The impetus behind the
thrust to space seems to have come from historically
two sources: (1)_A deep-rooted 19th century flavor of
imperialism which pictured the moon as a world to
conquer; (2) Desire for scientific knowledge. I think
that the first reason, this old colonization vintage of
days of yore, may be stronger than first suspected:
valuable scientific research in cancer, etc. has been
bypassed for the crash programs of the sixties. How-
ever, the relative worthlessness of the moon and
planets compared with, e.g., 15th Century America

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—FEBRUARY, 1972

has left both American and Soviet Isabellas doubt-
ing.

The nosedive in space appropriations does not
spell the end of space exploration, rather, it places
space exploration in proportion to the resources it
can gain. The “justification” of space exploration —
that space exploration is a carefully planned step in a
series of steps that will eventually lead to financial
rewards, is a nice theory but the lack of planning
which has produced cliff-hangers as worldwide
environmental pollution, the Vietnam War and
enormous credibility gaps, has convinced many that
the glorious leaders of today and their glorious
visions are at least slightly myopic. Coupled with
frustrating social realities, the priorities of space
adventurism hit an all-time low.

But the simple fact that there are resources be-
yond planet Earth is a necessary and sufficient
condition that mankind will get them. It depends
largely on what you define as a “resource” — iron,
aluminum, scientific acumen, propaganda prestige
— anything of some value above and beyond the
means to obtain them. The value of even common
earth resources — Iron, aluminum, uranium is
expected to skyrocket in the next century as supplies
on Earth dwindle. New sources of energy must be
utilized as a civilization based on fossil fuel sources
of energy cataclysmically collapses as fossil fuel
sources suddenly exhaust. This is not the Columbus
theory — it is at best the Marxist Doctrine of the
Lure of Space.

Given that in some civilization in the early 21st
century — perhaps America, perhaps not — the re-
sources of space will be realized, we can genuinely
ponder what new spacecraft systems will be
developed to transform these resources into utility.

These systems must in a quasi-economic sense be
breaking even in all operations in the solar system.
Curiously enough, we need not have a prophetic
knowledge of what a future civilization might define
as space resources; over wide limits we need only
know the physical characteristics of the planets to
describe the salient features of the systems of tom-
orrow.

What follows then, is not a romantic spacelore
nostalgic to the early 50s, but an effort to rationalize
future space exploration on the basis of economic
theory. Conceivably, no matter how outlandishly
experimental or boorishly simple the concepts, the
most economical method based on a reasonable
utility factor will be used.

Lunar-Type Planets

Both the lunakhod and the U.S. Moon Rover
served their purposes: both were designed to exploit
the same resources. Both programs took us
approximately the same percentage of the gross na-
tional product. The systems design incorporated into
these vehicles would essentially be the same for a
wide variety of cold atmospherless worlds akin to
the moon: Ceres, Europa, Titan, Hyperion, Umbriel
to name a few.

Most likely the traditional types of exploration
and exploitation will be used — although lightweight
volumously large rockets may be assembled in Earth
orbit and propelled toward the moon where, once
landed, they will be filled to the brim with mined
moon metals. Then they will be blasted toward earth,

16

to be crash-landed in some preselected land area to
form a heap of metal wealth. This is optimumly tak-
ing advantage of the 1 / 6 moon gravitation constant.
The crash-landing of unmanned gorged shells would
permit the highest tonnage without recovery worries.

Due to the lack of atmosphere Earth’s and the
moons of the outer planets, as well as the larger
astroids, would serve as excellent communications
bases.

Mercury

On hot planets, such as Mercury’s sunny side,
the 44 day “hot-foot” effect would destroy similarly
constructed vehicles and systems. Mercury is best
traveled underground, in underground mines,
launching stations or other subsystems. The small
radius of the planet and gravity may permit free-fall
tunnels to be dug through the planet’s crust; a great
deal of this idea depends on the condition of the
planet’s molten core and crust. If the planet is entire-
ly molten, surface travel on the planet would
probably be limited, accomplished by a reaction-
motor vehicle with a liquid surface/ solid surface
interface with an elaborate radiator system.

Mars

Mars has turned out to be slightly more forbidding
than the Barsoom of John Carter but as a planet it is
still a long ways similar to our own. The mineral re-
sources of Mars are probably very worthwhile and
plentiful.

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—FEBRUARYu1972

qt

Transportation to and from Mars is a well-
worn subject from Von Braun onward; colonization
is almost equally raked. However, I am led to believe
luxuries on such bases will be few, and increasingly
unearthly, as the economics of new environments
are realized, a clear departure from the classical
speculations into something a la Robert Heinlein. In
short, to maximize returns, people and machines will
become adapted to ways of life and environments
that would seem inhuman to us today. We can also
speculate Mars airplanes, rocket powered aircraft
with aspect ratios of 100 or better to compensate for
the scant Martian atmosphere.

Venus

Venus, of course optically impossible to
observe, is still the greatest enigma of the solar sys-
tem despite Soviet efforts to explore it. Ultraviolet
astronomy has yielded some faint surface markings
but the planet is still highly indeterminate. All data,
however, point to a planet with a hot surface.
Russian spaceprobe data tend to reject the hot iono-
sphere model, leaving the only explaination of centi-
meter radiation from a hot surface 300° C. which
the Russians have sinced evidenced also. There is a
warm atmosphere present also, about 100° C.
Establishment of a base, or mine, on Venus would
require establishment of sources of energy for
refrigeration, and there is yet no data as to the
mineral wealth of Venus. Venus is very much like a
Dantesque hell, slightly hotter, and probably lifeless.

Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus

On the nether planets transport, energy sources
and colonization would no doubt involve exotic sys-
tems on the limits of imaginations today. One way
would be ice-water cycle piston motors, as with
proper minimization of regelation huge heavy roving
bases could be propelled with ease. In these nether
planet explorations, the temperature is below -
250° F. and there are high pressures. An egg-shaped
shell propelled could swish about in the jelly atmos-
phere at an equilibrium point. People on Earth do
exceed 500 pounds so it is not inconceivable that
with proper artificial physiological stimulation such
large roving stations could be manned.

In the higher, less viscious portions of the Jovan
and Saturnine atmospheres, a superb economic
move is possible: since the atmospheres of these
planets are methane-rich, only oxygen could be
carried on winged vehicles to enable propulsion — a
kind of reverse jet.

Recently, questions have come also-about the
possibility of life on Jupiter. In Miller tube experi-
ments we have found that there is a certain
probability that nucleotides can be formed, basic
building blocks of life. The rate of evolution may
also be a function of the temperature of the planet —
primeaval forms only the wildest speculation can
describe. Ponder the differences between an oak
tree and a man — two evolutionary species in the

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—F'EBRUARY, 1972

same environment. Now try to imagine what kind of
life Jupiter would have!

New laws of thermodynamics may be dis-
covered.

Neptune, Pluto

On the outer worlds, Neptune and Pluto,
gravitation presents no problem. Atmospheres there
would be frozen or in a slushly two-phase condition.
New techniques would be required for exploitation.

Pluto has such low gravitation and is so small
that the atmosphere is probably frozen around the
planet in a layer at most a few miles thick. If one of
the resources is scientific data for a 21st-century
civilization, an astronomical observatory and tele-
scope would provide excellent seeing and a tremen-
dous parallax for accurate measurement of the dis-
tances to most of the stars in the Galaxy.

newfoundland: the beautiful

island off canada’s east coast

these pictures were taken by the Editor, Dick Beswick

on a recent trip to Newfoundland.

the island, a province of Canada since 1949, boasts a ruggedly beautiful terrain, a
people who feel the throb of the sea and know the fury of the North Atlantic, and a
climate moderated by the Gulf Stream. the economy has for centuries been based on
the lucrative fishing in the area of the Grand Banks and this was the lure which
brought English, Irish, Scottish, and French to Newfoundland as early as the sixteenth
century. the descendants of these early settlers today comprise a homogeneous com-
munity of about 500,000 people who, because of their relative isolation, have been
able to maintain their traditions and Newfoundland "brogue" to the present day.

Newfoundland has long been frequented by sportsmen in search of moose and tuna
and in recent years the tourist industry has shown signs of contributing to the island
economy. unemployment is high as many of the fishery-connected enterprises tend to
be seasonal but newfoundlanders take life in stride today, Newfoundland remains as a
bastion in the north Atlantic, untroubled by high crime rates, overpopulation, or
pollution problems.

the island is notjust a nice place to visit, but agreat place to live. take it from one who
knows.

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—F'EBRUARY. 1972

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER--FEBRUARY, I972

The farmers at a “Kombinat” (collective
farm) in Nasice Breznica, Yugoslavia are
really making their acreage pay off.

They flooded it, and are raising good old
American channel catﬁsh.

About three years ago, FMC visited the
Kombinat as part of a state department-
approved agricultural development program.
At the time, the Yugoslavians were raising
carp in huge man—made ponds covering mar-
ginal land—land not best suited for crops.
“Why not switch to farming catﬁsh?” we
asked. “They yield twice the harvest. And
they bring a premium price in the market-
place."

The Yugoslavians said, “Good idea—where
do we get the ﬁsh?”

That’s when our work began. We con-
tracted to ship them 21,000 ﬁngerlings, 110
brood stock, and 120,000 newly hatched
“fry,” knowing live ﬁsh shipment mortality
rates often reached 50%.

To do this job, special FMC containers
were developed to ﬁt into the baggage com-
partment of a Pan Am 707. They maintained
precise life support levels of oxygen, carbon
dioxide, ammonium, and controlled thermal
levels, too. During four 50 hour trips from
St. Louis to Yugoslavia we lost just six ﬁsh.
A record.

More importantly, Yugoslavia has more
productive “farmland.”

Fish farming, or aquaculture, is an exten-
sion of FMC agricultural programs. The
company is capable of building ponds, sup-
plying pond cleaning and pond operating
equipment, building ﬁsh processing and can-
ning plants, as well as containers for ship-
ping ﬁsh by air.

We also make printing presses, chemicals,
snowmobiles, rayon cord, and several thou-
sand other diversiﬁed products.

— the cleavage between blacks and whites on the
one hand, and on the other, division between the
country’s white populace over the two languages in
use. It appears that dissension will continue
unabated as long as the conservative government
maintains its hard line stance and enforces
apartheid.

Dr. Ridge spoke also of Rhodesia which con-
tinues to produce chromite and ferocrome. The
United States incurred the ill will of Rhodesia and
other black countries by refusing to trade with them
because of United Nations commitments. Although
trade has resumed on items necessary for security, it
is probable that Rhodesia will prefer to sell else-
where after independence.

South of the American border, Mexico has well
established government and stable currency, as well
as mineral wealth. The only problem is that in
Mexico, as in Brazil, policy dictates that 51 per cent
of the capital investment in industry must be
Mexican. Since Mexicans can obtain 12 per cent on
savings, there is little initiative to invest in mining at
possibly less return. In Brazil, the shakier regime
makes revolution conceivable but improbable. Brazil
remains a good country for American mineral
investment and exploration.

Dr. Ridge stressed that increasingly govern-
ments are taking over and striving for control of their
own mineral deposits. Such tendencies can be seen
further in the Congo, Zambia, and Venzeula. In the
latter, the government is preparing to take over con-
cessions after American contracts expire in 1983. He
said that presently there are ten Venzeulan graduate
students at Penn State pursuing studies in the

economics, management, and procurement of
minerals.
THE FUTURE

The United States will need raw materials for
industry and must plan now for their most
economical and secure attainment. How is this to be
done? Dr. Ridge explained the Japanese approach to
filling their needs. Japan doesn’t invest in foreign
countries but obtains minerals on contract. Thus she
fills the needs of industry and loses little in the way of
capital investment. He suggests that the United
States should go into the minerals exploration and
procurement business on contract. Having com-
pleted the exploration phase, she would purchase
from the host country on contractual terms, thereby
dispensing with the necessity for heavy investment
since the host country would be responsible for this
stage of development. Raw materials could thus be
obtained at competitive but reasonable prices.

In closing, Dr. Ridge, reiterating the changing
nature of the minerals industry in the late twentieth
century, urged companies to adapt and meet the

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—F'EBRUARY,1972

challenge of the future. He said, “we must adapt to
the world as it is, or we will find ourselves gone with
the world that was.”

Dr. Ridge’s expert analysis of his subject com-
bined with his sprinkling of witty anecdotes to make
this an informative and entertaining talk. The topic is
current and futuristic and especially pertinent to
AIME members.

Every Monday morning for the last couple of
months, there has been a line of students along the
second floor hallway and down two flights of steps.
What are these students waiting for, bowls of soup?
Whose office is so important that 35 students ac-
cumulate by 4:00 A.M. and the line almost reaches
the street by office hours. It’s the office of Mr. Ernest
S. Holmok, Director of Placement. Felice Sciulli,
with his camera, and I, made an appointment with
this man of such apparent renown to determine the
cause of his popularity and to check out the rumor
that some graduates weren’t getting jobs.

We put some questions to him and he responded
with candor. The following is a reasonably accurate
record of the conversation. Any student who will be
entering the job market in the next couple of years
should read his answers to some probing questions.

Q—How many of last years graduating
engineers gained employment? What was their
starting pay?

A—Pitt’s engineering graduates always keep up
with the national average salarywise. Usually the
starting salaries go up 5% a year. They stayed the
same this year and Pitt engineers stayed with the
mean which is $875 a month. This past year 350 job-
seeking graduating engineers registered with this
office. As of April '71, all but 61 had jobs. As o_f
August, all but 25 had jobs. That’s a pretty good

28

/aelpful /aints from bolmo/e

average compared to the liberal arts majors. Only
about half of them were able to find jobs. These are
25 human beings, not numbers, and in each indi-
vidual case it’s too bad. Many of the seniors who did
get jobs didn’t get what they wanted, but you have to
be flexible in a tight job market.

Q—What’s the forecast for engineering employ-
ment for the near future? Say the next five years, is
the market going to be like it was during the Sixties?

A—No it won’t be like the Sixties. Aero-space
companies used to call me and tell me they were
looking for 2000 engineers. They would interview as
many engineers as would sign for an interview. A lot
of these companies aren’t interviewing at all now.
This is still a technical society however and 70% of
the jobs coming through this office have technical
requirements. Things will slowly get better. Industry
will absorb our output of engineers. The job market
will be good enough.

Q—Is there a grade point minimum for any of
the interviewing companies?

A—A few specify “only send me 3.00 and
above.”

Q—For an interview, should an engineer get a
crew cut, dangle a slide rule from his belt, wear white
socks, a hard hat? Since it’s such a buyer’s market,
how should the student groom and dress for the
moment of truth, the interview?

A—Hair can be reasonably long if it is clean and
well trimmed. ’Fancy facial hair doesn’t come off
well, but if you feel you look better with it, it should

be meticulously trimmed also. The interviewers
realize you are students and might not have money
for expensive clothes. Three dollar shoes, however,
look good with a shine, and your clothes must be
clean and neat. The rule is coat, shirt, and tie. Even if
you are going to work in a steel mill where you'll
wear work clothes and steel toe boots, they are
hiring a professional and potential manager and
expect you to dress that way. A suit is preferable but
don’t go out and buy one, a sports coat will do. You
should strive to appear clean and well pressed —
meticulously groomed.

Q—For the interview, what information should
you have on the tip of your tongue? What direction
does the conversations take? How should you pro-
ject yourself?

A—Be natural, talk as if with a friend.

I've had students come in and carry on a good
flowing conversation with me and then go in to the
interview and just say “Yes sir,” and “No sir” to the
interviewer.

They usually are 15 minutes each way. The

interviewer will espouse the virtues and needs of his
company and you are expected to tell him your
background, specialties and preferences. You have
to convince him you are good enough for his com-
pany. You must have read his company's literature
thoroughly and be prepared to tell him where you
will fit.

You should treat him like a guest in your house.
Be polite, and it is your responsibility to keep the
conversation moving.

Q—If you have gone the campus interview
route with “no go” results, what then? Where do you
find the names of potential employers?

A—When you come to the college placement
office we give you a college placement manual. It
lists the majors and the names and addresses of the
companies that have hired graduates of your par-
ticular major in recent years. In the tight job market
you should use all contacts open to you. Don't
hesitate to approach friends of the family. Any rela-
tive who might be able to help you get a job, don’t

ENVIRONMENT OF PITTSBURGH

What is Environment Pittsburgh?

A local coalition: Housewives, high school and
college students, academics, professionals.

When did it start?

1970: We started out in January to put on the
Environmental Teach-In, which you may remember.
It was quite a big affair — April 1-4 on the campus of
Pitt, Carnegie-Mellon and Duquesne. We had
government officials, politicans, academics and
some industry people from all across the country.

Who was in this first group?

Mostly young professors and students. I became
coordinator because I had the time, being self-
employed.

30

What kind of an impact did the Teach-In have?

It’s a bit difficult to say: It wasn’t as well
attended as we’d expected; but, there was plenty of
substance over that four day period. Mostly, though,
I’d say it was a big publicity effort on behalf of a live-
able world. I’m sure it gave impetus to the various
environmental groups that already existed and
helped the climate for creating the new ones that
sprung up soon after.

What has your group been doing since then?

In a general way, after the impetus died down,
we’ve been spreading the gospel in the county,
getting our bearings, beating the bushes for real
honest-to-God commitment and finding out how this
community works. Who makes the decisions and so
on.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER--FEBRUARY, 1972

an interview with dcwid mars/oall

or.

SO the group is beginning to work?

Yes. We’ve begun to pull together with a vol-
unteer staff, a good Board of Directors, and we are
now incorporated non-profit and have applied to the
IRS for tax-exempt status.

Who’s on the Board?

Several of the same people that came together
in the beginning to put on the Teach-In. Plus others:
There are four Pitt professors, two students from the
Graduate School of Public Health, four high-school
students and myself, as coordinator.

What’s the program?

It consists of a series of local projects, for each
of which there is a team. These are the Frick Park
team, the Nine Mile Run study team, the Home~
wood-Brushton Cleanup Coalition liaison group and
the River Study group. The last two in particular are
enormous undertakings.

Could we go into details on these later, and ask first
about the idea underlying your work?

Yes. The program, I’d say, is a vision of the
world and a mixture of tactics and strategy — how to
get from here to there.

You know, more species have become extinct
than not. And they’ve become extinct because the
world they were adapted to changed, whereas they
didn’t. Some, of course, were killed off by man; but,
that’s a small percentage. So to continue to exist, if
the world changes, species have to adapt or if they
cannot, they have to change the world they inhabit.
Man has done both. Now I feel that mankind should
continue to exist, although sometimes I wonder why,
because we’re a greedy and rapacious lot.

In changing the world, though, as we thought
for our betterment, we’ve been playing with fire, and
we may be on the vegre of rendering it uninhabit-
able. Physically, this seems to be fairly clear: The
controversy on the effect of air pollution and the
atmosphere, and the consequent warming up or
cooling down of the earth’s surface; the controversy
over water pollution and phytoplankton and oxygen
production and the food chain; The controversy
over the genetic effects of low-level radiation
emissions; The general fear that we can’t afford to
break links in the ecological chain, or irreversibilties
may set in. So there’s a lot of fear around. And I have
some of it, particularly when I think of how ignorant
we are of the effects of our actions. You can change
the physical world only so much; beyond that, man
will be unable to adapt.

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—FEBRUARY, 1972

Then there’s the mental world — the world as
we perceive it. There are all kinds of things happen-
ing that make me feel greatly under strain. I remem-
ber feeling this particularly around Los Angeles, in
the summer of 1969. I’d gone backpacking in the
wilderness for a few months. And to come into Los
Angeles was to sense immediately the frantic
mobility of large numbers of people. In fact, for a
little, I felt that maybe it’s people like that that will
inherit the world — that will be the fittest to survive
in the future —— rather than people like me. But I
don’t act on that basis of course. If my senses reel, as
they do at the wholesale degradation and filth of the
Monongahela, then I want to do something about it.
I behave as if man ought to survive, and that means
helping create a more liveable world. And so one
thread is a sense of urgency and then an optimism
that it may not be necessary for us all to rush down
the slope of the future like Gadarene swine.

31

Lots of us feel the same way, but don’t know what to
do.

Right. Let’s start with another general idea. One
of the things we’re concerned about is the general
sense of helplessness the individual feels. The cap-
tain of industry, the executive making decisions he
.likes to proclaim as in depth decisions. The house-
wife, the student, the professor, the President even. I
think we all share a tremendous sense of powerless-
ness, at night when we’re awake and sober.

In the morning we slip into a iamiliar routine,
and the day’s trivia pushes all this out of our heads,
so we don’t, unless we’re neurotic, find ourselves
daily in the grip of paralysis. But, the feelings are
there all the same. Don’t you think, underneath?

Well, I'm interested in this; Go on.

So a practical conclusion from this is that a good
way to begin is with and in the local community.
Instead of trying to whip up a passionate enthusiasm
for the Florida Everglades versus the jetport,
although, Lord knows, we need the Everglades, what
we want to do is try to nurture the sense that it’s
possible to do something about the world we live in.
Our own turf, that means, and to have a say in the
kind of life one leads day to day. That seems to make
sense to me.

Hence the cleanups?

Right. They’re modest beginnings, you see, but
at any rate there’s a tangible result. Besides, the most
often asked question is: What can I do? And given all
the young people in this society, its useless to res-
pond by saying, “Wait ten or fifteen years till you’ve
studied the research of a problem or have done
some yourself”. This sense of frustration is itself a

32

social force, you see, and one ignores it at one’s
peril.

There’s another idea behind cleanups too.
They’re not in the least controversial. They bring
together very many different kinds of people, as I’ve
said. Now, I think the true environmentalist has ideas
that would appear radical if one tried to make an
issue out of them right away — things like the
inevitability of a complete stoppage in economic
growth, banning the automobile from downtown,
high school student involvement in the community
as a normal part of the curriculum, establishing a
fund for those likely to be unemployed if the
pollution laws are ever to be enforced — things like
that. But first, we have to build up support. Those
are for later.

This is the plan, but of course there’s a world
outside, to which we react, and which breaks in and
takes some time to work on.

Would you like to give instances?

Yes. Two spring to mind, both in Washington
County. One was a strip-mining issue involving Twi-
light Industries — a wonderful name, that — and the
other a flyash issue in the Elrama plant of Duquesne
Light. Also, yet a third, we prepared testimony on
nuclear power plants for Senator Hall’s Select Com-
mittee in Harrisburg. All these were in the summer
and fall of 1970.

We bought the strip-mining and flayash issues to
the attention of Channel 13, which did documen-
taries on them. I spent quite a bit of time out on the
strip-mining site. The people out there were afriad
the strippers would hit underground abandoned
mines and release the trapped water and ruin their
water supply. But Twilight did less stripping than its
permit entitled it to, so the workings were not hit.
And I’m told they did a good job of backfilling. So I
think we were useful there. A

And I was down in Elrama, on the flyash
dispute, speaking at a village meeting, and followed
up with talks with Duquesne Light officials. The
State’s Bureau of Air Pollution and the Attorney
General’s Strike Force got in on the act, together
with the Union Township solicitor who presented the
people’s case. The flyash billows all over the place,
and Duquesne Light planned to continue to dump
for the next 15 years or so on an adjoining tract. This
was the last straw for the local citizens. First, the
argument went before the Public Utilities Com-
mission. The issue being if Duquesne Light can be
allowed by the PUC to override a local ordinance
prohibiting the dumping of flyash, when it hasn’t
taken the slightest trouble to show how much more
costly it would be to dispose of the flyash in other
ways. A pathetic performance by Duquesne Light.
This has now been settled with an agreement by the
company to abide by the terms of an abatement
order finally issued by the state’s Bureau of Air
Pollution Control.

SKYSCRAPER ENG|NEER—FEBRUARY,1972

On this nuclear power plants issue, my
testimony had to do mostly with the need for a study
of the environmental effects of both fossil-fuel and
nuclear power plants, so we could see what this
Commonwealth will unavoidably be getting into if
projected levels of electricity consumption are really
supplied.

I had the impression you are concerned with young
people.

Yes. I think there is turning out to be an
emphasis that way — more so, perhaps, than with
other environmental groups. After all, if one pro-
fesses a concern that people feel at home in the
world; and, if one believes that very many young
people are very dissatisfied with the status quo, then
it is pointless to set up yet another organization in
which they play no significant part, and even more
pointless not to make great efforts to reach them. I
think we’re interested in introducing them to the
decision-making structure, and in their making
decisions themselves, earlier than. Schoolpermits
them to.

Particularly among the younger ones, you know,
there is a remarkable amount of quite intense
questioning of the meaning of the way their lives are
hved.

Why is that, do you think?

Oh, I don’t know. I’ve already mentioned the
fact that the young are so very much more numerous
in this society, and a greater percentage of the
population. This has something to do with it surely.
And the media. We pledge allegiance to the flag in
the morning, and in the evening we see race riots,
military atrocities and hunger on the tube. The
young are very quick to spot hypocrisy and to react
to it. Much less inclined to say, “Ah, here is one
more incoherence in human affairs”. They learn
more sooner. And also, of course, since they spend
increasing years in institutions of so—called learning,
their ability to participate in the society is
increasingly delayed. This adds up to a very
explosive mixture, I feel. Somewhere there has to be
give. I hope we can offer it.

So what is it you offer?

Well, first, in the schools we address, we raise
these questions: We ask about environmental
courses available to them, naturally. The pickings
seem to be pretty thin. And what we offer is an
opportunity to get involved in the community they
live in. If Governor Shapp can suggest, as he did
recently downtown, that this involvement should be
part of the curriculum, then I sure as hell can. And to
help in our research work — Nine-Mile Run, for
example; and, the rivers program — to organize their
own ecology groups with followup visits from us, to
think for themselves about ways of getting involved.
In this context, a plan to organize visits to the
decision makers in this community has obvious
merit, and we plan to get into this. It has the human

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER—FEBF\‘UARY, 1972

touch. If people you never see make big decisions,
it’s easier to think of big, faceless evil conspiracies
when you think the decisions bad. But things are
more complicated than that. And to find out that
such a person has fears, hopes and self-doubts, as is
sure to happen from time to time, is to be better
aware of the humanness of the world’s confusion.
That does sound like a possibly constructive starting
point.

Let me just go back, though. There’s a big
temptation here. It’s easy to think up things that you
think people ought to do if they’re really to get
involved in "pollution battles. Demonstrations
downtown to ban the automobile, for example; of
small study groups on stinking streams; cleanups;
rudimentary research; attending hearings.

But the point is that this is adult David Marshall
telling young people (if that’s what we’re talking
about) what to do. It’s tempting to do this because
easier. And to organize the many that still have to
form their own ideas and interests, and to jump to
glory with an announcement of a project in the local
press.

The trick is to sow the seeds, let them
germinate, see what crops up. Be a stimulant rather
than an overseer. It has to come from them. But it
takes a lot of self-discipline and patience really to act
this way especially when, as I do, one has a sense of
urgency about things. I think I mentioned this early
on.

Going back to the projects, you mentioned the Frick
Park cleanups, a Homewood-Brushton cleanup, and
the rivers program. Could we turn to them?

Yes. The December cleanup of Frick Park had
several interesting results besides getting groups
together and the removal of an unbelievable amount
of trash. We linked up with the city parks people,
who were very cooperative indeed. And the Depart-

Thursday session of the ASEE Engineering
College-Government Conference held in
Washington, D.C. on October 27, 28, 1971.

He has been appointed to a five—man
steering committee to obtain ASEE
“Division” status for the Relations with Fed-
eral Government Committee of ASEE.

Dr. Rafael Quimpo, Civil Engineering

Dr. Quimpo spent part of July and
August in Eastern Europe and France, in
part, under an international travel grant from
the National Science Foundation.

At the International Association of
Scientific Hydrology Symposium on Mathe-
matical Models in Hydrology in Warsaw,
Poland, Dr. Quimpo presented a paper,
“Structural Relation between Stochastic and
Parametric Hydrology Models.” He also was
asked by the Organizing Committee on the
Symposium to serve as chairman of a session
on Structural Analyses of Hydrologic Se-

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER—FEBRUARY. 1972

quences. Before the Work Group on Sto-
chastic Hydrology of the IASH Committee
on Mathematical Models, he discussed the
status of hydrologic research under his
supervision at Pitt.

In August, Dr. Quimpo attended the
XVth General Assembly of the International
Union of Geodesy and Geophysics in Mos-
cow. He was one of the official U.S. repre-
sentatives selected by the American Geo-
physical Union. His work was submitted to
the General Assembly as part of the five-year
U.S. National Report on Water Resources
Systems.

From Moscow, Dr. Quimpo proceeded
to France where he visited the National
Hydraulics Laboratory of Electricite de
France at Chaton.

The travel grant enabled Dr. Quimpo to
represent the United States through active
participation at the above meetings, review
and assess through personal observations and
interviews the extent of hydrologic work
outside the United States, renew contacts
with scientists in Europe, and establish new
ones, particularly with researchers at the
Academies of Science of Poland, Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary, with whom he
has had minimal contact before.

Interplanetary Travel

Interplanetary locomotion will have initially a
variety of forms, the most economical will eventually
supersede the rest. Chemical rockets will play a
major role in Earth-lifting applications for some
time; they may well be overtaken by controlled
fusion rockets, when controlled fusion comes into
vogue. Also of great use will be the solar sail; use of
an interplanetary large photon-catching “sail” by
which sunlight itself would be the medium of propul-
sion. It is probable that solar sails will be used as an
auxilliary, rather than primary, source of propulsion.
In distances great from the sun, around the nether
planets, compressed solid hydrogen ingots may be
cast around a wire and placed in brackets on space-
ships. Heating the center wire to a required tempera-
ture would produce. a steady-stream of hydrogen gas
for nuclear propulsion. Ionic propulsion, with its
high specific impulse, remains near the top of the
utility category and will fare very well in
Venus/ Earth/ Mars applications.

Also innovative is the possibility at opportune
times of hitch-hiking rides to planets on astroids.
Hildago might effectively be used as a weak gravity
base and heat sink for en-route work projects to
Jupiter, Saturn at certain opportunities. Also equally
stimulating is the possibility of imbedding a robot
base inside the astroid Icarus, one mile in diameter,
which has a perihelion of 19 million miles. This is as
close as anyone could get to the Sun with any
conceivable technology.

The possibilities for orbital workshops and
satellite plantetary shuttles are numerous and well-
expounded.

Interstellar Possibilities

In interstellar travel, barring any future break-
through (on which experience has taught us we can-
not depend) transport will most probably be
accomplished by so-called generation travel, i.e. long
duration large nuclear powered shells with several
families aboard. The idea here is for the 5th or 6th
generation to finally reach a questionable goal, per-
haps find it possessing a habitable planet, or per-
haps not, and thusly keep searching from class G to
class G star. Such a venture would take a millenium
before a high probability of success is reached, un-
less new observational techniques can determine
what a planet is like from distances up to 10 light
years. If so, “generation travel” can then be efficient,
although time-consuming. The effects of time-dila-
tion on such travel would be noticeable, but not yet
enough to be anything but circumstantial.

The fact that there are indeed planets out there
among the stars was discovered by Van Kampf of
measuring pertubations in nearby stars, or “wobble”.
Our own sun wobbles everytime Jupiter goes around

36

it. A planet in the system of Barnard’s Star, called
Barnard’s Star B, is 1.5 Jupiter mass with an ape-
barnardan of 490 x 105 miles and a peribarnardan of
440 x 105 miles. As Ba1'nard’s Star (Munich 15040),
6.2 light years distant, is a class M star with only
0.0005 solar luminosity and surface temperature of
the planet is low, rendering it somewhat like a cold
Neptune. What material resources exist on a planet
several billion years older than any in our solar sys-
tem I have no idea.

Since that discovery other planets have been
evidenced for without actually seeing their reflected
light, some on stars which could support habitable
worlds. 61 Cygni and Tau Ceti (11 light years distant)
are K and G stars which possess massive (15 Jovan
mass) planets and also have other stars co-ordinating
them (double stars). However, perturbation detec-
tion is unfortunately restricted to large supergravita-
tionous planets and a small world of comparable dia-
meter to Earth or Mars would escape undetected.

EPILOGUE: Planet Earth

As a final possibility there may be attempts to
create total climate control on earth and energy con-
trol by Total Geospheres and by Dyson Spheres.
Total Geospheres would be enormous frame struc-
tures with micro-thin foil panels on pivots, that could
control the intake of sunlight and the outgoing of
reflected light. Starting from an orbiting point, they
could be constructed geostationary around the
entire planet using only slightly more material than
today’s system of railroads and highways which
surround the planet.

The Total Geosphere concept would only be
successful in a non-oppressive political and social
order of civilization, the emergence of which may be
fundamental to the continued survival of our species.

EPILOGUE: The Sun

And possibly, in some future civilization’s
golden age, some enterprising society may build a
Dyson Sphere around the sun. Incorporating in this
project the entire mass of Jupiter, Saturn or Uranus,
the Dyson Sphere would completely surround the
sun and absorb all of its energy. The future civiliza-
tion, having taken up new quarters on the outside
and in the middle layers of the Dyson Sphere, would
utilize most of this energy and purposely radiate ex-
cess waste energy in the lower infrared region.

Future possibilities are staggering.

' hesitate to contact. But don't forget, I don't care

who's son you are, if you don't produce you'll get
fired. Also keep checking the newspapers.

Q—Should you use an employment agency?
A—More often than not most large companies

I’ ' will call me with job information before they call the

employment agencies. Agencies, however, have
their contacts too. Companies they've had good luck
in finding good personnel for, will call them and not
call us. By all means use them. No one has all the
contacts. Use any opening, contact, or source you
can in your job search.

Q—What about if you are an alumni and have
been laid off — can you come to Pitt Placement
office for help in finding a job?

A—You don't even have to have graduated, you
must have attended Pitt at some time to come to us
for help. Mr. David A. Francis Ir. Assistant Director
of Placement, specializes in this. Many Pitt alumni
have come back a number of times for help. There is
no stigma to being layed off in this job market; many
good people are in departments that are just closed
down. I've been in the same position myself.

Q—What about State and Federal jobs —— what
possibilities are there in this field?

A—Our Mrs. lune Rosenburger has become an
expert in this field. The Federal Government is the
largest single employer of college graduates in the
United States and they have many jobs for engineers.

When I was first looking for a job, the salaries
weren't too attractive, but now they're very competi-
tive. If I'd have taken a job with them then, I'd be
living the life of leisure now on a very good Govern-
ment pension. They give a pension after twenty
years. They are an attractive employer for a certain
type of people.

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—F'EBRUARY, I972

Q—What companies are hiring: large, small,
hardware, software?

A—I haven't seen any pattern.

Q—Judging on how many engineers were burnt
in layoffs, how can an engineer analyze his future
with a company? How important is job security?

A—There is no such thing as job security. Five
years ago aerospace and data processing were the
jobs of the future. Now they're making massive lay-
offs. Always keep a realistic eye on what's happening
in your industry. An entire industry can go in a few
years.

Q—How would you rate a job seeker’s qualities
as viewed by the interviewing company?

A—Number one — personality, number two -
experience, number three — grades; these are the
top three, the others aren't quite as important. Lot-
tery numbers in the draft are significant variables.
Activities are more important for the liberal arts stu-
dent. They realize the engineers don't have much
time for extra activities with the heavier credit load.
It's a plus if you do. If you don't, don't worry about it.

Honorary societies mean something if the inter-
viewer belongs or knows its reputation.

Physical condition can be a problem. If you're
obese, a company worries that you'll have heart
trouble at an early age. You have to pass the com-
pany’s physical exam.

I, or one of the staff, will try to meet with each
student individually. This is not a railroad service. If
a recruiter comes out and asks us about a particular
student, we like to know the student well enough to
make a good comment.

Q—Do companies have lists of names of camp-
us activists? Would membership in any campus or-
ganization you know of hurt a student's chances of
getting a job?

A—No to both questions.

Q—Will salaries stagnate with the abundance of
engineers?

A—Salaries will start going up soon along with
the employment rate. It will be slow with no big
jump. The market will never be the same as it was.

Department managers try to build little
empires. If there is a fifteen percent cut in personnel,
they have built up a cushion so they can still put out
the same amount of work. The companies are trim-
ming now. The personnel that are still employed are
working harder, working scared. Companies are
happy as hell with the situation. They have reduced
their staff; the remaining personnel work harder to
put out the same amount of work and the companies
can't give raises because of Phase II. You watch the
first quarter earnings this year. They'll be way up.

(Holmok continued)

Q—Are there jobs to be had in other countries?

A—Don’t go into an interview here looking for
foreign assignment as a condition of employment. I
hear that Australia will pay the fare for teachers and
engineers. An engineering degree is respected all
over the world. If you look, you ought to be able to
find something, but don't expect the same salary you
would get here. American companies which have
business abroad have only an elete cadre, maybe 5 %
of the personnel American. This cadre are experi-
enced men mostly in their forties. They don’t send
too many young employees fresh out of college.

Foreign students educated here are having a
hard time getting jobs here. Many of the inter-
viewing companies specify American citizens.

Q—Do you have any further advice to the
student looking for a job?

A—Things are difficult and the job hunt is hard
work. You have to be more flexible in what you will
accept. Be ready to work twice as hard to get a job
now. Its a good indoctrination to the cold cruel
world. As I said before, use every source; use
friends, professors, and relatives. If you keep at it
you’ll get a job.

 

(Environment continued from page 33)

ment of Public Works was told it could no longer
dump in Frick Park. It had been permitted to empty
leaves there in the fall, but had interpreted this per-
mission very liberally indeed. Finally, the idea of a
new Frick Park ecology center and program was
apparently given some impetus, with the help of a
considerable sum of money from Miss Frick. A
committee was formed to handle this, and has been
meeting regularly.

Now on the Homewood-Brushton cleanup. It
was held on June 5, 1971, and turned out to be the
biggest cleanup ever held in the city.

What got you started in that community?

Oh, it goes back to the Teach-In. I remember a
general feeling among us that the Teach-In had been
pretty much a white middle-class affair. We’d made
some inquiries among the black groups regarding
their participation in the Teach-In, but few or us
knew inner-city group leaders personally. So we
were a white middle-class committee for the Teach-
In. Ergo. But David Hall of the Homewood-Brushton
Clean Community Association I got to know at the
time, and one or two others since then.

Later, in July of 1970, I organized a panel with
Mr. Hall and three other black leaders at the time of
the Welfare Rights Organization’s conference in
Oakland. The panels title was War, Race, Poverty
and the Environment. My purpose was to try to
suggest that the environmental movement was not,

38

as some people were suggesting, our political
leaders’ way of taking the heat off these other issues,
and that even if it was they would fail.

Who'd been saying this?

Several antiwar spokesmen, and as I remember
George Wylie, Executive Director of the WRO, felt
that too. Anyway, it was largely a black audience at
the panel. and they were very single-minded about
their goal of $4400 guaranteed minimum income or
bust, so they didn’t want to get into these other issues
too much, because they might dilute their immediate
objective. And one of the panelists said flat out that
there was a conflict between the environmental
movement and the needs of blacks. High-priced food
and rents, rotten housing, low income, drugs — these
were their problems, not air pollution or clearn
water, while population control was potential
genocide.

Well, what I’m saying is that all this was in back
of my mind. But we didn’t give up. And at the Frick
Park cleanup in December 1970 David Hall came
with his trucks. We showed we could get people to
turn out for a cleanup, so by end of January 1971 it
was possible to approach the Homewood-Brushton
groups with something tangible to show. And since
several of the groups in the community have cleanup
programs, what we had to offer fitted in. We spent
some time discussing motives, but I think it’s alright
now. We’re taken at face value. The city agencies
will help plus federal funds, and I hope the county
will too.

Lord knows, the cleanup needed all the help it
could get. This is a big area, 3‘/2 miles by 1 mile, 700
acres, 240 blocks. Outside groups were welcomed.
We cleaned about 150 tons of garbage from a dozen
lots, which leaves some 150 lots still to go.

But even a big cleanup is just a beginning.
Followup is being planned with city and federal
money to include enforcement and maintenance of
the cleanup, a survey of what the community wants
in the way of topsoil, parking space, play lots. And a

rat control program would make sense afterwards,
with a thorough examination of the laws pertaining
to absentee—owned property.

And even beyond that, white groups, maybe,
will get a feel for what it’s like to live in the inner city
day in and day out. And for the committeed in word
and thought to commit in deed. Perhaps, then, we
may come by a glimmer of understanding.

Well, I like that. Can we come to future cleanup and
beautification efforts?

Of course, dates will be announced this spring.
Hire a bus. Bring your parents. Bum some trucks.
Roll up your sleeves.

Could we turn to the river cleanup?

O.K. It’s a three-stage program. It’s likely to
develop into a sustained program concerning
industry discharges into the rivers.

Why industry?

Well, partly of course, because there are some
very big polluters. But what’s happened is that, with
the widespread interest in environmental issues, the
federal Refuse Act of 1899 has been revived. It
prohibits industry discharges into navigable water-
ways without a permit from the Army Corps of
Engineers. As far as I know, the Corps never gave a
permit in this area during the 71 years since then. But
last summer, all over the country, industries applied
to the Corps for permits to discharge.

Now before they can apply to the Corps for a
permit, they have to have a certificate from the state
saying they’re in compliance with state standards,
which are pretty good, or have an acceptable water-
pollution abatement schedule.

If they don’t get the certification from the state
they won’t get a permit from the Corps. If they do
they will.

But this looks fairly right already. What do you want
to do?

It is tight on paper. But the state doesn’t have
the funds or manpower to chase up all the applicants
and to be sure that they’re in compliance when they
say they are, or to examine the pollution-abatement
equipment to be sure it’s working properly and isn’t
being overloaded. So there’s considerable suspicion
concerning whether or not the standards are being
met. At least we’re suspicious.

 

SKYSCRAPER ENGlNEER—F'EBRUARY, ‘I972

So, the first stage is to identify the big polluters
and then choose some we’re suspicious of. There’s
some information on this which is OK for telling us
this, and this we’ve researched. The second stage is
the sampling and analyisists program we’ve set up.
That means going out on the river collecting samples
and taking them back to the labs for analysis.

Who’s going to do this?

Boatowners, students, professors and other pro-
fessionals. We had a booth at the boat show in the
Civic Arena back in January, 1971 and we expect to
be back in February. We had slides and films and
literature, and we explained the plan and signed up
boatowners from the area. Many really wanted to
help. We have help from professional photographers
to augment our amateurs, so we are building up a
visual inventory, and we have even the use of a
plane.

And what happens to the samples?

They’re being tested at the universities. That’s
why we’ve set up a technical committee. To be sure
the data is first rate and also to look into pollution-
abatement technology that will really do the job. It’s
absurd to have to spend hundreds of thousands of
dollars of state money every year on checking up to
see if industry is in compliance.

Then we’re turning this data over to the Penn-
sylvania Department of Ennvironmental Resources,
which has resposibility for state certification, and its
attorney’s Strike Force, which is doing good work
out here, and to Mr. Thornburg’s office, for prosecu-
tion under the federal refuse act.

Meanwhile, technology question is very
interesting in itself. There’s no reason to my mind
why what happened in Chicago shouldn’t happen
here.

What was that?

The U. S. Steel, South Chicago plant down near
Lake Calumet had installed equipment to meet the
state water standards. Then the Illinois Attor-
ney General stepped in and said “Now that’s
not good enough, gentlemen, we want 100 per
cent cleanup.” Naturally, U.S. Steel didn’t
like that. I think at one point they said it couldn’t be
done. But a local man who knows the iron and steel
industry knew it could be done, and at what cost. It’s
a matter of recycling water, instead of pouring it into
the rivers laden with wastes. There was some clever
work by the Hlinois Department of Public Health, I
think it was, to prove that U. S. Steel was polluting
Lake Michigan. In fact, the plant is not too far from
the City’s water intake out in the lake.

Well anyway, the upshot was that rather than be
caught in court with its pants down, U. S. Steel
agreed to a program costing some $8-12 million in
capital investment, plus $1 million a year operating
costs.

I feel that was a tremendous success, which has
gotten nowhere near the attention it deserves. As I
say, this kind of research should prove valuable
locally too.

How are you doing all this? Don’t you need funds?

Of course we do. But you know one underlying
theme in this whole ecological message has to do
with making a little go a long way. We’re after people
and commitment, really more than money. All our
workers are volunteer, and we have some first-rate
ones. You know, what often happens with money is
that it goes to one’s head. One’s apt to spend it mak-
ing big public splashes rather than getting maximum
output per unit input. Well, that’s what I’ve seen
happen up and down. It may be possible to avoid it.
I’m not sure. Anyway, I think the program speaks for
itself. So far we’ve managed off membership con-
tributions, but if we can’t get some solid backing
then my names Rumpelstiltskin.

So you’re not Rumpelstiltskin. Would you like to say
a little bit about yourself?

Well, what do you want to know?
Your accent.

That’s English, of course. From the North
Country, Lancashire in fact.

And what’s you background?

Oh, I grew up in the country, roamed the fells-
moors, I guess is the word here — on my own. Was
happy in a little village elementary school, hated the
prison of grammer school, dropped out, served an
apprenticeship in a factory, lothe operating and
drafting. Then came two years compulsory military
service, which fortunately paid for the correspon-

 

dence courses so I could pass the university entrance
exams.

Where did you go?

I took up economics at the London School of
Economics and then on to the University of Chicago
for an MA, with by that time my Chicago wife, whom
I’d met in London. Then I went to the United

Nations Secretariat in 1964 doing economic re-
search.

And what about Pittsburgh?

I was offered a job here in 1966 with a private
research and consulting firm, and worked there till
1969 mostly on a rather elaborate transport-sensitive
multiregional input-output model, under contract to
the U. S. Department of Transportation. It had to do
with the Boston-Washington Corridor.

Then what happened?

Finally, and belatedly I guess, I got the feeling
we were all going to hell in a hand bucket, and that
my being in an office wasn’t helping one bit. So I quit
in April 1969, and bathed my soul in the silent sanity
of the west, on a wilderness camping and backpack-
ing tour that lasted four months. It’s magnificent
country, no doubt about it.

And when I came back I wrote about the trip,
the U. S. Forest Service and wilderness, then got
caught up in the preparation for the Teach-In and
coordinated that.

Now I’m volunteer full time with Environment:
Pittsburgh, and have been this past two years.

Could I ask how you live?

My wife supports me and our two daughters. It’s
a bit hard sometimes. One of the good things is I’ve
spent more time with the kids. I work my own hours.
But they’re more than ever before, because I really
get a kick out of the variety the work brings. Besides,
we buy so little now that our family is not faced with
a solid waste problem at home.

Thank you, David. Should we finish up?
Yes, please. Let me say one more thing, though.

I think in all this I’ve done some belly-aching
about the bad things in this society. But actions
speak louder than words. I’m here. I’m a U. S.
citizen. And I intend to stay. It’s a very interesting
and exciting time and country to be alive in. I have a
great affection for it, and hope I can help us pull
through.

Stereotype

Many who use the word wouldn’t know one when they see
one. Those who recognize it as a metal casting of a newspaper
page, curved for the press, may be deriving a livelihood from
this and everything else they know about printing. The more
people who depend on the printing industry for a living and
the more they know, the better for Kodak. The intricate com-

plex of businesses and crafts centered on the art of printing‘

and packaging is more than a principal market for specialized

Kodak products. One way or another, it provides a life role.

for a not inconsiderable segment of mankind. Finding a role
in life does seem to be a common problem.

So you picture an executive conference. Sweeping generali-
ties uttered, ﬁne details worried over, a strong voice takes.

command: “Products alone can’t sustain the growth we look
for. The key is people—people to man our customer indus-

tries, to want growth in them as much as we do. Wouldn’t we.

really be accomplishing more with a campaign to attract.
more kids to printing?”

Not quite.

We can’t and shouldn’t mount a campaign powerful enough
to lure large numbers of kids into printing and the graphic

arts, but we have collaborated with new-style academics, the.

printing and allied industries, and their unions in a measure-

ment just completed of 1) manpower needs in these ﬁelds.

(not just ambitions), 2) how.changes in technology promise
to affect the needs. Interest in the ﬁndings should be made

  How CAN A SHEET or SILICONE RUBBER
HELP TURN ATEN-YEAR-OLD INVALID INTO

ATEN-YEAR-OLD ATHLETE?

A few years ago, General
Electric engineers developed a
silicone copolymer rubber with
some remarkable properties.

It's a membrane that permits
the rapid exchange of oxygen
and carbon-dioxide molecules.

So it's made a revolutionary
new "artificial lung possible. The
GE Peirce lungm oxygenates
blood in much the same way
the human lung does.

That's a major engineering
accomplishment. But that's not
the reason it's important.

The GE Peirce lung works
with a minimum of disturbance
to blood cells. So it can be used
safely much longer than con-
ventional lung machines. Days
instead of hours. , T

That extra time may be what
a doctor needs to repair the de_-
fective heart of a child. To open

the clogged arteries of an adult.
Or to save the life of an accident
victim" whose lungs give out.
That extra time may be all it
takes to help put thousands of
those invalids back on their feet.
It's a pretty clear example of

T how a technological innovation

can help solve a social problem.
Alot of times, the effect of tech-
nology on societyis ratherdirect.

-That's why at General Elec-G
tric, we judge innovations more
by the impact they'll have on
people's lives than by their sheer
technical wizardry.

Maybe that's a standard you
should apply to the work you'll
be doing. Whether or not you
ever work at General Electric.

Because, as our engineers
will tell you, it's not so much
what you do that counts. It's
whatit means. ‘
