locity of the air in a laminar bounda-
ry layer varies linearly with its
height above the surface, from zero
velocity at the surface to free
stream velocity at certain heights.
The air is then said to be laminar
and of a low—friction drag nature.
Laminar ﬂow is smooth and free of
turbulence in the ideal case. This
type of air ﬂow is desirable. On
the other hand, turbulent flow is to
be avoided. Turbulent air ﬂow oc-
curs when air takes on an oscillating
or fluctuating movement as it passes
over a wing surface. Eddying oc-
curs with velocity components trans-
verse to the main ﬂow. Turbulent
ﬂow is characterized by vortices
which cause proﬁle drag (the sum
of skin friction drag and drag_due to
airfoil shape). These disturbances
or energy interchanges within the
turbulent boundary layer cause high
turbulent friction drag. Turbulent
friction drag is much larger than
the corresponding laminar friction
drag. Therefore, the basic purpose
of LFC is to reduce air turbulence
and to promote laminar flow in the
boundary layer.

Conventional straight wing lami-
nar airfoils have long been used by
aircraft. The P-51 Mustang of
World War II fame had one of the
ﬁrst. A laminar airfoil or proﬁle
has its maximum thickness located
aft of the mid-chord position. Such
airfoils give laminar ﬂow that ex-
tends back from the leading edge
appreciably before transition to drag
producing turbulent ﬂow occurs. In

A typical LFC wing designed by Northrop. The panels in the bottom of the wing
give access to electric, hydraulic, and control equipment and to the fuel bay.

most high performance swept-wing
airplanes transition occurs at or
near the wing leading edge. Trans-
ition is the change from smooth
flow t.o turblent ﬂow in the bounda-
ry layer. Transition is theoretically
assumed to cause a sudden change
in the ﬂow pattern. Actually a
ﬁnite distance required for the lam-
inar ﬂow to turn turbulent. The
drag coefficients on each side of the
transition point diﬁer markedly,
with the larger coefficient appearing
on the turbulent side. So, without
LFC, conventional laminar airfoils
do not give full chord laminar ﬂow.

Another cause of turbulence is
separation of air ﬂow. When this
occurs, the laminar flow actually
separates briefly from the wing sur-
face and returns to give turbulent
flow. Separation does not normally
occur after transition, and the turbu-
lent ﬂow remains attached to the
wing surface. Partly caused by skin
friction, ﬂow separation can be
minimized with LFC. When LFC
removes the low energy portions of
the boundary layer, a new layer
starts to form; however, its energy
level is higher than that of the
normal boundary layer, and separa-
tion is delayed.

Because of an occurrence called
crossﬂow, it is difficult to maintain
laminar ﬂow over a swept-wing.
Crossﬂow, or lateral shearing of up-
per parts of the boundary layer, is
caused by variations in pressure
along the wing span. Crossﬂow
causes early transition in the bound-
ary layer at or near the wing lead-
ing edge and produces a wing which

is called turbulent. LFC can mini-
mize crossﬂow velocities and aft
chord separation by creating an ad-
vantageous span and chord-wise
pressure distribution over a wing
surface.

Wave — drag is encountered at
transonic and sonic speeds. In the
transonic region wave drag is com-
posed of the drag due to shock for-
mation and the drag due to bounda-
ry layer separation. It amounts to
about one half of the total drag of
modern jet airplanes. At subsonic
speeds the total wing drag is com-
posed of the induced plus the proﬁle
drag. But at transonic and higher
velocities, wave drag must be added
to the other types to give the total
wing drag. When wave drag occurs
at supersonic speeds, LFC effective-
ly reduces it only if the shock wave
from the Mach cone is in front of
the LFC wing. Since methods to
effectively reduce wave drag have
not yet been found, the LFC system
must operate on a lower percentage
of the total airplane drag resulting
in a lower net relative drag reduc-
tion. This decreases the overall ef-
fectiveness of LFC at supersonic
velocities.

The Reynolds number becomes
important in describing the air ﬂow
over a wing at ﬂying speeds in the
sonic region where the dynamic
forces acting on an airfoil becomes
important. Compared to non——lami-
nar airfoils, the laminar airfoil drag
coefficients will be lower at higher
Reynolds numbers. At small lift
co—efficients or in the range of higher
ﬂying speeds the laminar airfoil drag

<2"

is mostly skin-friction drag. In-
creasing the Reynolds number or
speed causes the transition point of
the boundary layer to move forward
steadily from the trailing edge. The
c_oefficie_nt of drag correspondingly
increases along a transition curve. If

A the boundary layer can be kept arti-

ﬁcially laminar, say with LFC, so
that transition occurs at a higher
Reynolds number, it is possible the-
oretically, to reduce drag.

When LFC is used, the laminar
ﬂow suction slots reduce the bound-
ary layer thickness by approximate-
ly the width of the slots. The
sucking in of considerable amounts
of stagnant, low velocity surface air
reduces the boundary layer thick-
ness so that laminar ﬂow may be
maintained. With crossﬂow effects,
transition, stagnant air, and ﬂow
separation practically eliminated in
the boundary layer, full-chord lami-
nar ﬂow can occur under operational
conditions. This is assuming that
the wing was originally designed as
a laminar airfoil and that the sur-
face of the wing itself does not ex-
ceed certain roughness restrictions
which may cause premature tran-
sition.

LFC can effectively reduce the
drag on an airplane wing. But drag
is also produced by the parts of an
airplane not giving lift. Such drag
is called parasite drag. It is entirely
possible to reduce this drag by ap-
plying LFC to such parts as the
fuselage, engine pods, engine pylons,
and tail assembly, if the ultimate
performance is desired of an LFC
plane. However, LFC could not
easily be applied to current airplane
fuselages because of the multitude
of panels, maintenance hatches and
access doors present.

Neither the LFC concept nor the
basic theory behind it is new. Both
were known in the 1930’s. Why then
has LFC only recently been applied?
There are two main reasons. First,
it was easier in the past to reduce
drag with such developments as can-
tilever wings, retractable landing
gear, streamlining. etc. These air-
plane 1‘ e fi n e m e n t s have today
reached maturity and are now
recognized as the essential develop-

ments leading to the evolution of
the LFC airplane. Secondly, LFC
needed more research to close the
gap between theory and application.

Then, in 1949, LFC was jointly
attacked by the United States Air
Force and Northrop Aviation Cor-
poration in a 12-year development
program. The Air Force was seek-
ing a method of. extending the range
and endurance of its aircraft With-
out increasing the gross weight. This
program was headed by Dr. Werner
Pfenneinger of Northrop, a pioneer
in the low drag boundary layer con-
trol ﬁeld. The ﬁrst LFC system was
soon ﬂight tested on a Lockheed
F-94 Starﬁre jet. A straight wing,
single engine interceptor, the F-94
is in the 600 MPH class. The plane
was modiﬁed for these experiments
by placing a 69-slot suction glove
over one of its wings. Over two
hundred tests flights were ﬂown be-
tween 1953 and 1957, and good re-
sults were obtained. One hundred
percent laminar ﬂow was achieved
on the wing glove at Reynolds num-
bers as high as 36 million. One re-
sult of these tests revealed that
“bug specks” cause transition below
an altitude of 20,000 feet. Besides
the F-94 experiments, a pressure-
model program was also undertaken.
It provided data for the develop-
ment of a true laminar ﬂow wing.
This wing is now being test ﬂown

on an experimental aircraft, desig-

nated the X—Q1A.

In August of 1960, the U. S. Air
Force Research and Development
Command awarded a 3-year, $77--mi-
lion contract to the Northrop Cor-
poration of Los Angeles and its Nor-
air D i v i s i o n. The _Aeronautical
Systems Division of the U. S. Air
Force Systems Command was given
ﬁnancial and managerial authority
over the program. The original esti-
mated cost of the 3-year develop-
ment program was $Q7 million. But
because of major aircraft conﬁgura-
tion changes, such as the installa-
tion of new engines on pylon mounts
on the aft fuselage, the cost steadily
grew to a present 35 million. The
X-21A is being tested under this
program today. Northrop also re-
ceived two $1-million basic research
contracts from the FAA in ﬁscal
1963-64: to study the practical ap-
plication of LFC to subsonic trans-
port aircraft, and supersonic LFC
wing conﬁgurations swept ahead of
any behind the Mach cone.

The main emphasis of the X-21A
program is on the low drag aspect
of boundary layer control rather
than on high lift. Drag reduction at
cruising speed is a paramount ob-
jective. Another objective is to dem-
onstrate the practicality of the
X-21A LFC system under all ﬂight
operating conditions. The operating

The B-66 jet engines were re-
mounted from the main wing to the
aft part of the fuselage. As a result,
the B-66 wing had to be moved 28
inches back because the new center
of‘ gravity made the plane tail heavy
upon landing. Mounting of the
engines in the rear of the fuselage
reduced the engine noises around the
main wing and simpliﬁed the LFC
duct work in the wings. Nacelles
containing theLFC pumping system,
were placed on the wings where the
two—jet engines had been. On a typ-
ical jet transport with wing mounted
engines, the pumping system would
be placed inside of the engine pylons.
Two General Electric YJ79-13 jet

engines rated at 9,400 pounds thrust,

each and weighing 2,550 pounds
apiece replaced the two original Alli-
son J'71—A-9 engines weighing 4,212
pounds each, to obtain a better
thrust—to-weight ratio. Because of
this, the X—21A had about the same
gross weight (83,000 pounds) both
before and after installation of the
LFC system. Empty, the X-21A
weighs 45,828 pounds.

Noise, turbulent air, and wing sur-
face roughness all cause transition in
the boundary layer. Therefore, some
plugs had to be installed in the

engine inlets to keep compressor

whine from reaching the wing sur-
face. Correct positioning of the plugs
in the inlet entrances blocks noise
downstream from traveling up-
stream, because the airﬂow is near

, sonic velocity through the plugs.
V Microphones in both of the engines

help to position the plugs correctly.
Aerodynamic fairings were added

_ at the wing roots to simulate the
 fairings of a mid- or low-wing air-
2‘ plane and to improve the air ﬂow

pressure distribution at the wing

1* roots.

The X-21A’s LFC wing is a unique
airfoil in everyway. Reasons for
choosing the wing section were based
on Spreiter’s thin-airfoil compres-
sibility theory, with empirical cor-
rections near the wing leading edge.
The wing camber line has local cur-
vature near the leading edge. But
aft curvature was avoided because it
would produce a high zero-lift pitch-

ing moment. However, the trailing
edge was loaded by providing a small
amount of curvature atabout mid-
chord of the wing. This has the same
effect on the wing as that provided
by a large-chord ﬂap with only
a slight deﬂection in the. airﬂow.
Therefore, in transonic ﬂow (Mach
.8 to 1.2) the X-21A wing is highly
loaded near the trailing edge. The
ailerons and tail assembly surfaces
do not have LFC.

A moderate aspect ratio of seven
was used for the X-21A wing to re-
duce the risk of pitch—up. For any
wing form the aspect ratio is deﬁned
as follows: Aspect ratio = span/
mean chord = span?/wing area. For
a wing of larger aspect ratio at any
one angle of attack, the lift coeffi-
cient is greater and the drag coeffi-
cient is less, than for a wing of
smaller aspect ratio. Aspect ratios
usually fall between 1 and 20.

The X—21A LFC system is de-
signed to suck in the slow moving air
adjacent to the wing surface through
ﬁne slots, channel it to compressors
through ducts inside the wing struc-
ture, and pump it quickly over board
for added thrust. Air is sucked into
the wing through spanwise slots
varying in width from .003 to .011
inch. These suction slots reduce the
boundary layer thickness by about
the width of a slot (.0025—.008
inch.) This air then enters plenum
chambers, .02 inches deep and .188
inches wide, located directly under
the slots. Next the air pa s s es

through suction holes in the inner
skin which are .06 inches in diameter
and spaced .25 inches between cen-
ters. Then the air ﬂow is metered as
it passes through tributary ducts
which are .24: inches in diameter and
3 inches long. These ducts increase
or decrease the amount of suction
along the length of a given slot
to correct for small local pressure
changes which slot thickness cannot
compensate for. The exit nozzles on
these ducts are inclined 20° to the
main suction ducts and have diam-
eters ranging from .05 to .14 inches.
In all 60,000 to 70,000 nozzles are
used. After passing through the trib-
utary ducts, the air enters the main
suction ducts and goes to the p11mp—
ing pods. The ailerons have trans-
fer bellows to remove air sucked
through the LFC slots.

Pressure taps along the trailing
edge of each wing show the extent
of laminar ﬂow achieved in ﬂight. A
ﬂight engineer monitors these taps
through dial readings. On each wing
there are 21 combination upper and
lower taps one fourth of an inch
above and below the trailing edge.
Six rakes also measure the wing
pressure distribution in both the
laminar and turbulent ﬂow regions.
Each rake has seven pressure taps.
Three are on the upper part of the
rake to measure turbulent ﬂow, and
four are near the wing surface to
measure laminar ﬂow. A green light
ﬂashes on in the ﬂight engineer’s
compartment when laminar ﬂow is

achieved in ﬂight.

Wing sweepback causes cross-ﬂow
in the boundary layer which is diffi-
cult to control. Comparatively free
of this drawback, straight wings
have a tangential proﬁle in the
stream-wise direction. On a swept
wing, the pressure gradient is normal
to the local streamlines, causing ﬂow
in or out towards the regions of low-
est pressure. In the boundary layer
this pattern is exaggerated. There-
fore, because of crossﬂow, more
suction is needed on a swept wing
than on a straight wing to stabilize
airﬂow over the wing edges, mainly
the trailing edge.

As a result, suction slots are needed
at the leading and the trailing edges
as well as at the center of the
X-21A’s wing. Both the upper and
lower wing surfaces have the same
suction slot pattern. Distribution
spanwise over the surface, the slots
are closer together near the leading
and trailing edges and farther apart
at the mid-chord position where
suction requirements are less. At the
leading edge the slots are .4 inches
apart, at the mid-chord position, 3
inches, and at the trailing edge, 1
inch apart. For a modern jet trans-
port the slot width would be about
.005 inches. The X-21A’s slots had
to be made smaller and their num-
ber greater for low altitude tests of
the LFC system.

Developed by Garrett-Ai Research
for Norair, the X-21A LFC suction
system consists of two low and high
pressure pumps or suction compres-
sors mounted in wing pods. The pods
are located where the B-66 jet
engines had previously been. Two
stage compressors were chosen for
efficiency reasons over single and
multi-stage compressors. They are
driven by bleed and bleed-burn tur-
bines obtaining air from the main
propulsion engines. The low pressure
pump draws air from the upper wing
surface, while the high pressure
pump draws from the remaining
wing surface. The low pressure pump
is run directly by hot bleed air from
the main engine. One—third of the
bleed air drives the forward low pres-
sure turbine, but the rest passes
through a burner before driving the

12

high pressure turbine. The high pres-
sure turbopump draws its fuel from
the plane’s fuel supply.

Low pressure air from the upper
wing surface is mixed-in the wing
and ducted down to the low pressure
compressor where it is pumped to
the pressure level of the rest of the
system and delivered to the pod mix-
ing chamber at the inlet to the high

pressure pump. The compressor ratio .

is about 1.3. High pressure air from
the lower surfaces is mixed in the
outboard wing mixing chamber and
passed through the rearspar into the
pod mixing chamber. The air ﬂow
from the main suction ducts is mixed
to‘ reduce the velocity distortion at
the inlet of the axial flow compres-
sors and to improve the system’s
efficiency. Next the air goes to
the high-pressure compressor which
pumps it out of the pod tail pipe at
or near ambient pressure and ﬂight
velocity.

The thrust afforded by each wing
pump at Mach .8 at 25,000 feet is
250 pounds. Then both pumps give
a total additional. thrust of 500
pounds at these conditions. At 40,000
feet the total thrust afforded by both
pumps is 250 pounds.

Norair studies have revealed that
proﬁle drag may be reduced by a
factor of 30 by using the LFC sys-

tem. An overall net reduction in pro-
ﬁle drag‘ of 80% is possible after sub-
tracting the hypothetical equivalent
drag corresponding to the energy ex-
panded by the suction s_vste1n to
maintain laminar How. The wake
drag of the laminar surfaces and the
equivalent suction energy required
for the LFC system to operate is
accounted for by part of the total
engine thrust. This equivalent en-
ergy is accounted for in the skin fric-
tion drag coefficient for the LF_C
surfaces so that a true picture of
LFC beneﬁts is obtained.

It was found necessary to increase
the wing area for any given wing
conﬁguration to minimize the over-
all wing drag which is composed of
the proﬁle and induced or lift drag
at subsonic speeds. For the maxi-
mum range, the induced drag should
be nearly equal ‘in magnitude to the
total proﬁle drag. The induced drag
is proportional to the angle of attack
squared. It can be minimized by
decreasing the angle of attack. But
then it is necessary to increase the
area and corresponding lift of the
wing. Increasing the wing size in-
creases its proﬁle drag which is pro-
portional to the wetted area of the
wing. In reducing the proﬁle drag
by 80%, LFC gives a net reduction

Freedom 8: Discipline

Modern physics has identiﬁed 34 elementary
particles of matter—each with its twin anti-parti-
cle. The inevitable two opposing forces that keep
the universe in balance. .

We think at the heart of most well-run modern
companies there are also two opposing and equally
important forces—freedom and discipline.

Freedom to innovate, to change, develop and
invent. Plus the discipline to stick to the facts, to
stick to the problem, to stay within the budget.

At Celanese we try to combine freedom and dis-
cipline to better serve our customers, our share-
holders, and our employees.

Perhaps we are the company at which you can
best pursue your career. If you are trained in

Theory of Ion Exchange

A brief look at the theory, types of ion exchange resins, general industrial
applications, and economics of the industrial process known as ion exchange.

Ever since soil, in its present com-
position, has existed on the surface
of the earth, the ion exchange pro-
cess has been in use. This is due to
the existence of an ion exchange
capacity in the soil. Nothing was
known about this process until in the
17th century. Francis Bacon formu-
lated the idea of puriﬁcation of water
by ion exchange. He did not know
of ion exchange as we know of it
today, but knew that some sub-
stances, when used in ﬁlters, would
remove the undesirable ions from the
Water. Also around this time, farm-
ers used something similar to an ion
exchange process by reactivating
worn soil into productive soil
through ﬁltration of the soil. This
was the ﬁrst actual contact with ion
exchange as a process. After this,
ion exchange attracted very little
enthusiasm until the present 20th
century. Little by little, men of sci-
ence became interested in this pro-
cess not only as a query of science,
but as a useful industrial tool. They
formulated the theory of this pro-
cess. Then industrial men discovered
its use in industry. These industrial
men designed and built special
equipment to contain the process
and from day to day new uses have
come into reality dealing with this
process of ion exchange.

In the following pages, let us take
a brief look into this phenomenon
called ion exchange. To completely
describe the theory and Various facts
of ion exchange would require many
volumes. Therefore we will take a

general look into the theory behind’

the process, the type of equipment

used, only part of its many indus-
trial applications, and a view into its
economics.

Ion exchange is usually deﬁned as
a reversible exchange of ions be-
tween a solid and a liquid. There is
no substantial change in the struc-
ture of the solid, which is the ion
exchange material or the resin
particle.

Ion exchange resins can be
thought of as particles having an
elastic, three dimensional hydrocar-
bon network to which is attached a
large number of ionizable groups.
The nature of the ionizable groups
attached to the hydrocarbon net-
work determines the chemical be-
havior of an ion exchange resin. Four
commercially important types of
resins are strong- and weak-acid
resins (cation) and strong- and
weak-base resins (anion).

From an application point of view,
ion exchange can be used to (1)
transform an electrolyte; (2) re-
move ions; (3) separate ion species;
(4) concentrate ions; and (5 pro-
mote catalysis, absorption, etc.

Ion exchange occurs commonly in
nature when water containing dis-
solved electrolytes comes in contact
with natural solids. Listed below are
a number of natural substances that
have ion exchange properties:

The understanding of the equilib-
rium and kinetics of ion exchange
has improved somewhat in the past
few years.

In order to understand the me-
chanics of ion exchange, let’s con-
sider a_ column exchange using a
cation resin. The reaction will be:

At + B*R = A"'R + 13*

At the start of the process, the
resin contains only B cations. A
solution containing only A cations
now ﬂows through the column, and
A ions are absorbed on the resin and
replace cation B according to the
equilibrium constant, Ka.

The solution moving down the
column becomes depleted in A and
enriched in B . If the equilibrium

is favorable and the column long‘

enough, the effluent will contain
only cation B until the column be-
comes nearly saturated with A
Continued operation will result in
leakage of the A cation.

If all conditions are in equilibri-
um, a concentration-history curve
(concentration in efHuent/c0ncen-
tration in inﬂuent, y—axis vs. time,
x-axis) will be vertical; under non-

equilibrium conditions, the curve is
not as sharply vertical because leak-
age occurs at an earlier point. Flow
rate, particle size, concentration,
temperature, regeneration level, bed
depth, all affect the shape of the
concentration-history curve.

Regeneration is next in the oper-
ation of a ion exchange mechanism.
The elution step envolves using a
concentrated solution of an electro-
lyte that will efficiently displace
the ion on the resin in a minimum
of time. Good elution will produce
steep-sloped lines.

Since the theoretical relationships
of ion exchange are relatively new,
there are very few actual mathe-
matical relationships which would
describe exact processes in ion ex-
change. Until more mathematical
relationships are developed, the use
of general rules of thumb have been
followed by design engineers in
designing ion exchange equipment
for processes. Some of the most
general rules.

1. At low concentrations and
usual temperatures, the ex-
change potential (extent of ex-
change) increases with increas-
ing valence of the exchanging
ion.

2. At low aqueous concentrations
and usual temperatures, the
extent of exchange increases
with increasing atomic. num-
ber of the exchanging ion.

3. At high concentrations, the
differences in exchange poten-
tials between ions of different

valence diminish.

4. The exchange potentials of the
hydrogen and hydroxyl ions
vary considerably with the na-
ture of the functional group
and depend upon the strength
of the acid or base formed be-
tween the functional group
and the hydroxyl or hydrogen
ion. The stronger the acid or
base, the lower the exchange
potential.

5. Organic ions of high molecular
weight and complex metallic
anionic complexes usually have
high exchange potentials.

As always, since these are not
exact relationships, there are ex-
ceptions to the general rules. These
exceptions have led many investi-
gations down blind alleys which
have resulted in a waste of valuable
research time.

Types of Ion Exchange Resins

The type of ion exchange resin
needed for an industrial process
varies with what the resin must ac-
complish. Porous resins, nuclear-
grade materials, ion-exchange mem-
branes and tailor-made resins are
the basic types of resins in use to-
day. These are only the most
universally used types of resin. Be-
sides these, there are many speciﬁc
resins produced in small quanities
for speciﬁc processes and highly
expensive processes. Below is a dis-
cussion of the most general types
of resins.

Basic anion exchangers are made
by chloromethylation of the poly-

mer, followed by amination. The
strong-base resins are produced by
using tertiary amines, resulting in
formation of quaternary ammonium
resins. Weak-base resins can be
made with polyamines.

The strong-acid cation exchanger
and strong—base anion exchangers
of the styrene—divinyl benzene type
are now almost universally used.
But some Weak-base resins of the
styrene type have the disadvantage
of requiring excessive volumes of
rinse water after repeated cycling,
and other types of resins that do
not share this disadvantage have
been introduced.

Styrene Resins Are Popular

Sulfonated styrene -divinyl ben-
zene cation exchangers have uni-
versal acceptance due to their high
capacity and chemical and thermal
stability. They are used for soften-
ing water at high pH and tempera-
tures up to 250F. with great success.
Exchange capacities of both the
cation and strong—base anion ex-
changers appear to be close to the-

oretical maximum, so no spectacular -

improvement in this respect is likely
to be achieved. However, total
capacities are not used in cyclic oper-
ation, and stoichiometric chemical
efficiency has not been obtained-
so it would be unduly pessimistic
to assume that improvements in
these characteristics cannot be
made.

divinyl benzene cation exchangers

in water treatment applications,
they are susceptible to oxidation,
which results in breakdown of the
divinyl benzene cross-linkage. The
standard water—t1-eatment r e s i n s
contain 8% divinyl benzene (DVB) .
By increasing this proportion to 10%
or 12%, the useful life in an oxidiz-
ing environment can be increased.
Resins with a range of 4% to 90%
environment can be increased. Res-
ins with a range of 4% to 20% DVB
are available. In general, th e
higher cross-linked r e s i n s have
slighly lower exchange capacity and
exhibit a slightly greater “leakage”
of exchangeable ions. The higher
cross-linked cation exchangers are
successfully used to remove heavy
metals from 25% chromic acid and
have a surprisingly economical life
even in the presence of this strong
oxidizing agent.
New Porous Resins

A few “macro-reticular” resins-
resins with a truly porous, rigid mat-
rix—have been on the ‘market for
years, but their development as
highly cross-linked, hard, oxidation-
resistant beads is a very recent de-
velopment.

Classiﬁcation

Conventional, gel~type s t y r e n e
resins depend upon swelling that
occurs when water is present to per-
mit free access of ions to their in-
ternal exchange sites. Lower DVB
cross-linkage permits greater swell-
ing and increased ionic activity, but
this weakens the structure and
makes it more susceptible to oxida-
tion. Higher cross-linkage improved
physical and chemical resistance
but interfered with ion exchange.
Therefore, all such resins must rep-
resent a compromise, although for
most uses, a very successful one. In
addition, conventional resins are
comparatively inactive in completely
nonaqueous organics and are physi-
cally degraded by alternate expos-
ure to nonaqueous chemicals and
water.

The macro-reticular resins over-
come these problems, at least in
part, since they remain porous even
in the complete absence of water.
While the high DVB content in re-
ticular products results in excellent
oxidation resistance, it does reduce
activity of these resins below that
of the conventional 8% cross-linked
ones. Selection of the proper resin
depends upon the qualities most im-
portant to a given use. As a catalyst

Cation Exchangers

of ion-exchange resins—Tab|e I

in nonaqueous systems, the macro-
reticular‘ resin certainly has merit.
Strong-Base Resins

Ion—exchange reactions differ from
conventional solution-phase reac-
tions: one of the species is always
fixed to the resin polymer network
in such a manner that it remains
insoluble, while the ion of opposite
charge is mobile and can exchange
with other ions in the solution phase.
Thus, in the deionization of water,
H can be exchanged for all of the
other cations in solution, and OH
for all of the anions:

The ion-exchange reactions are
equilibrium reactions, and_ are re-
versible. The cation exchanger is
commonly regenerated by contact-
ing it with HCI or HQSO4, and the
anion exchange by NaOH.

Strong-base resins have the dis-
advantage of instability of quater-
nary ammonium groups, which tend
to revert to tertiary or other weak-
amine forms, particularly at ele-
vated temperatures. For this reason‘,
anion resins normally require more
frequent replacement than cation
resins.

zluced in bead form and have a
screen analysis in the range of 16
to 50 mesh. Finer resins are pro-
duced, and have the advantage of
more rapid reaction; but this ad-
vantage is insigniﬁcant for most ap-
plications, and the 16 to 50-mesh
range results in more applications,
and the 16 to 50—mesh range results
in more acceptable pressure drops
in the ordinary packed-bed oper-
ation.

Ion—exchange resins are made in
membrane form by dispersing ﬁnely
ground ion-exchange resins through-
out a thermoplastic matrix, or by
condensation processes using sul-
fonated phenol and formaldehyde
or nitrogen - containing compounds
and formaldehyde. These two types
of membranes are known as hetero-
geneous and homogeneous, re-
spectively. Both are used in elec-
trochemical processes where they
permit migration of either cations
or "anions, between the electrodes,
and prevent diffusion of the pro-
ducts formed at one electrode to-
Ward the other. A promising applica-
tion for such a process is in desalin-
ization of brackish Waters — this
has been encouraged by the Office
of Saline Water, U. S. Dept. of the
Interior.

Innumerable special types of
resins can be produced, and many
“tailor-made” ones have been made
in small quantities for speciﬁc ap-
plications. Quite a few research
reports have hailed this develop-
ment and suggested that the future
of ion exchange depends upon the
availability of more and more such
special resins. However, to many
people working in the ion-exchange
ﬁeld, the number of standard prod-
ucts now on the market seems ade-
quate and perhaps even excessive.

Without any question, develop-
ment of applications for some of the
more special resins has been inhib-
ited by the high cost of those resins.
For example, the weak-acid cation
exchangers are interesting: but their
use, particularly in water treatment,
has not been impressive. In this
case. first cost is high, but the resins
have advantage of high regeneration
efficiencies and high capacities.

20

During the past 15 years, there
has been no break-through in ion-
exchange resins comparable to the
development of the styrene resins
in 1948. However, physical char-
acteristics of the standard products
of all of the resin manufacturers
have been steadily improved. The
bead resins are more uniform and
relatively free of fractures. Premi-
um—type resins have been introduced
that are almost entirely free of
visible stresses and fractures and
are more resistant to attrition and
oxidation.

N uclear-Grade Resins

One improvement worth mention-
ing is the production of nuclear-
grade ion-exchanger resins. These
were ﬁrst produced because of a
demand for extremely pure ma-
terials (free of trace organics found
on ion-exchange resins) for use in
removing radioactivity from nuclear
reactor loops. Although impurities
are present in exceedingly small
quantities in conventional resins,
they are objectionable in this type
of service and must be removed by
super-regeneration, then rinsing with
organic solvents and hot demineral-
ized water. Since nuclear-grade
resins are used only once and then
discarded, they do not get the bene-
ﬁt of repeated regeneration.

Another interesting variation is
resins colored with pH sensitive
dyes that lose their color as the
resin becomes exhausted. Thus, re-
maining capacity is visible in a
transparent column. These dyes are
available in both cation and strong-
base anion forms, and are widely
used in laboratory units, both in
non-regenerable cartridges and re-
generable columns.

Types of Erccha/nge7‘s

As has been previously stated,
the resin material of the ion ex-
change process varies with the
operation. Besides the resin ma-
terial, the type of equipment used
differs for the different processes.
Since we are dealing with ion ex-
change in commercial use, let us
take a look at some of the common
ion exchange equipment in use to-
day.

The most popular of the ion ex-

changers is the ﬁxed—bed exchanger.
A ﬁxed-bed ion exchanger typically
consists of a cylindrical, vertical
pressure vessel with internal dis-
tribution systems top and bottom,
and frequently a third distribution
for regenerate solution. The bed of
resin is supported on some type of
screened distribution, or in a bed
of graded material such as quartz.
The column height is sufficient to
provide space for backwashing of
the resin.

Externally, regenerable ﬁxed-bed
exchangers have a manifold of valves
so arranged as to permit the various
steps required for completion of a
cycle. Sometimes, a multiport valve
takes the place of several individual
valves.

The ﬁxed-bed cycle is as follows:

1. Loading of the resin by passage

of the feed solution.

2. Backwashing with Water to

clean and re—stratify the bed.

3. Elution of exhausted resin by-

passage of regenerant solution
through the bed.

4. Rinsing of the bed to remove

excess regenerant.

When solutions other than water
are treated, two additional steps,
known as “sweetening on” and
“sweetening off” are added. Such
terms refer to the displacement of
water from the resin by the solution
to be treated (loading solution);
and, at the end of the loading cycle,
displacement of the valuable solu-
tion by water. Since there is al-
ways some dilution of the product,
sweetening—on and sweetening—off
steps are critical, particularly when
the value of the chemical being
treated is relatively high.

Careful design of equipment and
proper operation are necessary to
minimize dilution. Frequently, flat-
bottom columns, with the resin sup-
ported on a screen distributor, are
used. The loading phase of the
cycle may be carried on by what is
known as the air-dome method,
where the product stream is intro-
duced just above the resin bed, and
the balance of the tanks above that
point that contains no liquid. Ap-
propriate level control is required
to keep the liquid surface slightly

above the surface of the resin bed.

Obviously, in ﬁxed-bed operation,
a column must be off steam part
of the time for regeneration. This
requires from one hour for simple
water treatment units to several
hours for more complex equipment.
Where the ionic concentration in
the feed stream is high, it is pos-
sible that the time on stream may
be less than half of the total cycle
time. In such a case, several col-
umns are necessary to maintain
“continuous” operation. But rather
large volumns of resin and large
space requirements can make such
a system uneconomical. If, as is
often the case, the feed stream
passed through several ion—exehange
columns in series, and if the load-
ing cycle is short, continuous oper-
ation with fixed-bed equipment will
require a very large and compli-
cated arrangement.

Fixed-bed equipment is generally
operated downﬂow and is common-
ly regenerated in the same direction:
The resin bed becomes gradually ex-
hausted downward and must be re-
moved from service when insuffi-
cient regenerated resin remains to
produce an acceptable product.
Downﬂow regeneration results in
maximum regeneration of the upper
part of the bed and less efficient
regeneration of the lower part.

For many "applications, downﬂow
regeneration produces the desired
results. However, the advantages
’of countereurrent operation have al-
ways been recognized and can easily
be demonstrated in the laboratory.

The problem in industrial-scale
ﬁxed-bed equipment is that upward
ﬂow of water or regenerant solution
rises the resin bed, so that thorough
Contact between the resin and the
solution cannot occur. This problem
was solved by 1956 by couterflow
regeneration. Here the bed is oper-
ated in the normal downﬂow man-
ner, but the regenerant is passed
upward against a simultaneous
downﬂow of water that joins the
regenerant solution at a collector
located at the surface of the resin
bed. Downﬂow keeps the resin bed
in the packed condition so that ef-
ficient regeneration is obtained; and
the countercurrent ﬂow regenerant
results in thorough elution of the
lower part of the bed—the part that
is last to contact the product stream.
Uses for Counterflow

It is logical to expect that coun-
terﬂow regeneration should be
useful in chemical processing, par-
ticularly where the important ion
is closely held by the resin—and this
has proved true. In 1960, Dow
Chemical Co. performed a labora-
tory project were Counterflow re-
generation was compared with con-
ventional downﬂow regeneration in
the recovery of zinc from a syn-
thetic-rayon spin—bath wash water.
Zinc recovery was chosen for this
project because of the relatively
low selectivity of the resin for zinc
in the particular steam involved,
and because of previous work done
by Dow. Dowex 50—X12, 20-mesh,
was exhausted with an acid solution
containing 0.49% HQSO4. At ex-
haustion (leakage of 10% of inﬂuent
Zn), zinc was eluted with sulfuric
acid.

Obviously, use of water as the
counterflow barrier would dilute
the product in such as application.
Spent regenerant, therefore, was
used as the blocking liquid. Follow-
ing are the conclusions arrived at
in the report:

1. Counterﬂow regeneration can

be of value in chemical process-
ing applications where an ion
is not tightly held by the resin.

9. Use of spent regenerant as the
counterﬂowing barrier makes
it possible to obtain an elu-ate
rich in product and comparable
to the eluatc from standard
downﬂow techniques.

3. Additional capital expenditure
and operating cost of couter-
ﬂow regeneration can be bel-
anced against improved oper-
ation.

4. Counterﬂow regeneration can
lead to increased operating
capacities of up to 25% under
the conditions studied.

5. Leakage from counterﬂow sys-
tems can be cut to 75% of
standard downﬂow techniques
under the conditions studied.

1|/Iiazed-Bed Ion Exchange

Certainly one of the most inter-
esting of ion-exchange developments
was the introduction in 1949 of the
mixed—bed deionized. Here an in-
timate mixture of sulfonic—acid ca-
tion exchanger and quaternary—am-
monium anion exchanger is used in
a single bed. The solution passing
downward through such a bed con-
tacts a long series of cation and
anion beads, resulting in more near-
ly complete deionization than in a
series of alternate cation and anion
exchangers.

Some leakage of cations always
occurs in a cation exchanger, and
this results in leakage of alkalinity
from the anion exchanger. In the
mixed bed, cation and anion ex-
changes take place virtually simul-
taneously, resulting, in effect, in a
single irreversible reaction that goes
essentially to completion.

Regeneration of the mixed bed is
possible because quaternary am-
monium resins with a slightly lower
density than cation resins, can be
separated by hydraulic classifica-
tion. After regeneration, the resins
can be remixed by using compressed
air, and restored to service.

The mixed—bed deionizer is widely
used for applications in which ex-
tremely pure water is required. It
has become virtually standard in
recently designed high-pressure cen-

21

tral power stations for ﬁnal polish-
ing of make-up Water, and is fre-
quently used for polishin g con-
densate.

Mixed beds are standard equip-
ment with nuclear power reactors,
where they are used to produce
make-up water for the secondary
loop and to remove radioactivity
from water in the primary loop.
Resin loaded with radioactive min-
erals can be disposed of far more
readily than the immensely larger
volume of water that it has been
used to treat, and in addition the
water is suitable for re-use.

In the mixed bed, regenerants
may be pumped or drawn by hy-
draulic ejectors into the bed. Large
units usually require a distributor
for the caustic regenerant above the
top of the- bed, but in smaller equip-
ment this is not necessary.

The ﬂat tank bottom, supported
by a dished head, has a bottom dis-

tribution system just above it. This
distributor consists of a system of
radial arms from a central hub, or
parallel laterals, to give good cover-
age of the entire area.

No supporting bed is used, and
both the "bottom and interface dis-
tributors are wrapped with fine
mesh screen to prevent loss of resin.
In large tanks, the intermediate sys-
tem and the alkali distributor above
the bed, if one is included, are con-
structed to withstand pressures de-
veloped due to swelling of the resins.
I on-Ezzzchange M ay Be Automated

Until the past three or four years,
probably the -great majority of
chemical process installations were
manually operated. Today, how-
ever, they are generally, automated.

All of the phases of operation of
fixed-bed ion-exchangers ca n be
automatically controlled. In fact,
nearly all larger ion-exchange sys-
tems for chemical processing and

Double exchange units with gauges and controls.

22

water treatment are now "designed
with automatic or semiautomatic
control.

l\/Iany small deionizers are auto-
matic except for regenerant han-
dling. Pneumatically o p e r a t e d
valves are usually controlled by
means of solenoid valves and timers.
Conductivity instruments are used
for stopping and starting service
cycles, although pH controllers or
color changes in solution are of
value for some applications.

Regenerant handling may be au-
tomated via bulkstorage tanks and
pumps. Mixing tees with propor-
tioning controls are used to dilute
the regenerants to the desired
strength. Even the sweetening—on
and sweetening-off steps required in
chemical processing can be handled
automatically.
Continuous Ion Exchange Equipment

This type of ion exchange equip-
ment is in use only for a few proc-
esses where a few hundred parts per
million of ions dissolved are to be
converted to another form. This
operation is in use only where the
process cannot be accomplished with

GENERAL APPLICATION OF
ION-EXCHANGE

The applications of ion-exchange
to industrial processes has produced
a great many and varied uses. These
applications can usually be listed in
ﬁve basic categories which cover
the most practical applications in
commercialuse today. Many other
commercial applications are in use
today but are regarded as classiﬁed
by the ﬁrms that use them.

The ﬁve basic categories are:

1. Concentration of ionic sub-

stances.
2. Transformation of ionic con-
stituents.
3. Removal of ionic substances.
4. Fractionation of ionic sub-
stances.
5. Miscellaneous applications.

to sodium by cation exchange. The
easy digestibility of human milk is
due to its relatively high percent of
sodium, and low-calcium powered
milk is used for dietary purposes
and infants’ formulas.

Salts of a number of organic
acids are converted to the free-
acid form by cation exchange. ‘When
the proportion of salt to acid is
comparatively low in the feed solu-
tion, this might be looked upon as
simply a removal process. But
when it is relatively high, emphasis
is on conversion or transformation.

Sodium ferrocyanide is converted
to ammonium ferrocyanide by ca-
tion exchange in a chemical plant.

What is usually looked upon as
the simplest of all ion-exchange
processes—zeolite softening of water
—is actually the transformation of
calcium and magnesium salts to
sodium salts. In such a case, of
course, the regenerant is s o diu In
chloride.

A major problem in the wine in-
dustry is precipitation of potassium.
tartrate after the wine has been
bottled. The conventional method
of stabilization is “chillproofing” by
exposing the wine for a prolonged
period to a temperature of -4 C.
The wine must be held at this tem-
perature for approximately t wo
weeks, and then filtered,

Conversion of potassium to sodi-
um by cation exchange, using NaC1
as the regenerant, eliminates this
problem. Stainless steel equipment
is used, and special care must be
taken to prevent excessive dilution
or loss of product, as in the case in
the treatment of any valuable sub-
stance.

PRIMARY UNITS SECONDARY UNITS
FRACTIONATION

Increased demand for rare earths
resulted in true production-scale
equipment for this application, and
since that time the rare earths have
been produced in substantial quan-
tities by ion-exchange chromatog-
raphy.

Until the development of this
process, separation and purification
of rare earths required innumerable
crystallizations, and production in
any quantity was out. of the ques-
tion. These elements are now pro-
duced in quantity with purities
above 99.9%

In the process, a mixture of rare-
earth oxides obtained from mona-
zite or gadolinite ores is dissolved
in hydrochloric acid to produce a
chloride solution containing about
50 grams of rare earth per liter. Sul-
fonic-acid cation exchange resin in
the columns is converted to the
cupric state with a weak solution
of copper sulfate. The rare-earth
chloride solution then passes through
a long series of such columns until
the ﬁrst few columns are saturated
with the rare-earth mixture. Sepa-
ration of the rare earth is accom-
plished by elution with a 0.4% solu-
tion of ammonium ethylenediamine
tetra-acetate, although dilute citric
acid or glycolic acid have also been
used as eluting solutions. Lutetium,
the least strongly held of the rare
earths, is released ﬁrst, and is fol-
lowed in succession by each of the
other rare earths in the feed mixture.

Many other separations similar
to those with the rare earths are
possible, but the need for such a pro-
cedure in similiar applications has
yet to emerge. Certainly, fraction-

ation is a promising process and
one that will eventually ﬁnd other
uses.

CONCENTRATION

Recovery of uranium is one ex-
ample of concentration of a valuable
material.

Another interesting concentration-
recovery application is the recovery
of silver cyanide rinse waters. This
method is in use in a large plating
plant in a western state. Rinse
waters containing sodium or potas-
sium silver cyanide are passed
through a sufonic-acid cation ex-
changer and "a strong-base anion ex-
changer in series. In the cation ex-
changer, sodium cyanide is con-
verted to free hydrogen cyanide.
The silver cyanide complex preci-
pitates on the cation exchanger.
Thus the effluent from the cation
exchanger contains only hydrogen
cyanide. This is passed through
the strong-base anion resin where
the cyanide is retained by the resin.
Effluent from the system‘ is deion-
ized water that is recirculated to
the rinsing operation. '

Exhausted anion exchanger resins
are regenerated with caustic soda
solution. The eluant, containing

sodium cyanide and sodium hydrox- .

ide, is passed down through the ex-
hausted cation exchange resin, elut-
ing the silver as sodium silver cy-
anide. Silver is precipitated as the
chloride, and the cyanide is de-
stroyed by the addition of sodium
hypochlorite solution.. I

Resin beds are rinsed with water,
the cation exchanger is regenerated
with sulfuric acid and rinsed, and
the system is again ready for de-

A Wide Open Field

The field of technical writing is a new one, unknown to many engineers.
Its opportunities are enormous for those engineers who have the desire to
write and the ability to acquire data accurately.

In the modern world of today,
science has become one of the most
prominent ﬁelds of concentration.
Due to this, it is necessary for scien-
tists to be able to express scientiﬁc
discoveries in words understandable
to their business contemporaries, to
their superiors, and to the layman.
This necessity has brought about a
major new occupation, that of tech-
nical writing. In order to become a
technical writer, one must have both
journalistic training and scientiﬁc
understanding. On the other hand,
though, most companies seeking
technical writers prefer a degree in
one of the sciences or, even more so,
in engineering, with a general knowl-
edge of journalism, rather than the
other way around.

No matter what degree companies
require technical writers to have,
most companies that deal with any
phase of science, and that’s just
about every company, have to have
them. They are‘ needed to write re-
ports for the scientiﬁc paper and also
reports that can be understood by
the laymen. What then is a techni-
cal writer? “He is an organizer, a
reporter, and a teacher. He under-
stands science and engineering.” One
book deﬁnes an ideal technical writer
as one who “has a cool head, an in-
quisitive mind, a warm personality,
a bachelor’s degree in science or en-
gineering, a post graduate degree in
English, and several years of techni-
cal experience.” Going by this deﬁ-
nition, a few if any, college students
could be classiﬁed as ideal technical
writers. Yet. there are many college
students who would like to and who
have the ability to pursue this line
of work. It is therefore, necessary to

look at more realistic requirements
for this type of profession.

The one statement in the deﬁni-
tion given above, one who has a
bachelor’s degree in science or engi-
'neering, seems to be the most impor-
tant consideration that companies
have when reviewing the resumes of
their applicants. If one would look
through the business section of the
Sunday edition of the New Y orlc
Times, he would ﬁnd many oppor-
tunities for technical writers with
engineering degrees, but few for
those with liberal arts, or just writ-
ing, degrees. For instance, in a recent
issue of the paper there was only
one advertisement for a liberal arts
graduate. The company’s name was
not given. It read:

Research Writer:
Phi Beta Kappa, Liberal Arts,
French, Biological Sciences,
Adaptable, Current contract
Ecology and nuclear effects.
$12,000 or contract basis.
All others found, such as the follow-
ing one which is for the Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories, required the
applicant to have a degree in engi-
neering or physics.
Science Writers:
To prepare and edit articles,
news, other material for use in
our technical or employee pub-
lications, or for distribution to
the technical, trade, or general
press.
Required: degree in one of the
physical sciences or engineering
and demonstrate ability to
write clearly and accurately,
or college degree with heavy
undergraduate or graduate
study or work experience in

physical sciences.

The fact that most companies pre-
fer engineers to liberal arts or writ-
ing majors is emphasized by Mr.
McGahey of the technical informa-
tion department for the Westing-
house plant in Pittsburgh. He ex-
plained that while each Westing-
house plant has hiring policies which
differ from one another, most prefer,
and will only hire, engineering grad-
uates who have had some journalism
or formal writing training in their
background as technical writers.
“Our technical writers work right
with the other engineers, so it is nec-
essary for them to also be engineers,”
he said. “For instance, in our de-
fense center in Baltimore the engi-
neers are working on nuclear atomic
energy, rocket fuel, and astro-nuclear
reactors for submarines. The techni-
cal writers are working right with
these engineers, so you can see where
a biology or chemistry major, or
even a writing major, would not
know as much about the subject as
an engineer who can also write.” For
the Baltimore plant, Mr. McGahey
said that the Westinghouse technical
writers had to have a knowledge of
electricity, statics, heat, and thermo-
dynamics. Engineers are almost the
only ones who have this knowledge.

Salaries for technical writers cover
a wide range, as do the salaries for
most any other occupation. The
Westinghouse average starting sal-
ary is about 595 dollars per month
or about 7150 dollars per year, which
is the going rate for engineer grad-
uates. In his book Technical Writ-
ing as a Profession, Allan Lytel,

Meet the ambassadors

Around the world, Union Carbide is making friends for America. Its 50 affiliated companies abroad serve
growing markets in some 135 countries, and employ about 30,000 local people. ) Many expressions of
friendship have come from the countries in which Union Carbide is active. One of the most appealing is this
collection of dolls. They were sent here by Union Carbide employees for a Christmas display, and show some
of the folklore, customs, and crafts of the lands they represent. “We hope you like our contingent,” said a
letter with one group, “for they come as ambassadors from our country.” b To Union Carbide, they also
signify a thriving partnership based on science and technology, an exchange of knowledge and
skills, and the vital raw materials that are turned into things that the whole world needs.

ten years of experience. Another pos-
sibility for technical writers is the
position of publications supervisor
directing several writers. The aver-
age annual salary for this is 9000
dollars and not as much experience
is required as for a technical editor.
More experience, however, is re-
quired for a publications supervisor
than for a technical writer.

No matter what the salary range
may be for different companies and
for different positions, there is always
a need and a demand for the man

the ability to write. According to
Mr. McGahey, “People who have
the interest and some ability are
scarce.” Few companies refuse to
hire women, although many prefer
men. At the Pittsburgh Westing-

women in some of the other West-'
inghouse plants.

The number of technical writers
hired each year varies as greatly as
does the salary range. There is no
record of the number hired that is
known at present. Westinghouse
area plants hire between twenty-ﬁve
and ﬁfty new people every year in
addition to the people they already
have. The new personnel are not just
technical writers, however, but are
also technical editors. “Technical
writing is a good ﬁeld, a growing
ﬁeld, a ﬁeld with lots of opportu-
nities. To ﬁnd highly capable people
is very hard,” Mr. McGahey said.

From these facts and from the

statements made by Mr. McGahey,-

it is evident that technical writing is
a growing new profession, wide open
for the engineer who likes to write
and who has the ability to collect
and report scientiﬁc data accurately.
For engineers who Want a ﬁeld with
plenty of opportunities, they should
inquire about technical writing. The

A NEW METHOD FOR CREATING CROSSWIND FORCES on a
moving automobile has been developed by General Motors Research Labora-
tories. The new method utilizes a small rocket engine powered by hydrogen
peroxide and capable of a 50 to 200 lb. thrust.

Formerly, a propeller—driven mechanism from the roadside was used to pro-
duce the desired crosswind. This method suﬁered from the fact that the moving
vehicle was only in the crosswind a short time besides the fact that the cross-
winds were both unpredictible and variable which means they couldn’t be
measured accurately.

Among the various advantages of the rocket engine are the ability to
locate it anyplace on the side of the car—front, middle, rear—which would
enable the engineers to record the effect of these crosswind forces on various
body shapes. Instruments are located in the rear of the car to record the effects
on these crosswinds and to accurately time and control the rocket engine.

ELECTRON BEAMS AS A MANUFACTURING
TOOL for drilling holes, cutting intricate shapes, and
welding parts together in areas only a fraction of the size
of a grain of sand are under development by Westinghouse
Electric Corporation. '

These electron beams perform their manufacturing
tasks due to the intense heat they generate. They pro-
duce power of up to a million watts per square inch
which is enough to vaporize even the most heat resistant
materials. Even though they produce a large amount
of power, the entire workpiece being cut or drilled never

gets hot. This is due to the fact that the beam is turned,

on only in brief millionth-of-a-second pulses.

The electrons are propelled through a vaccum cham-
ber at speeds of more than half the velocity of light. They
are then focused to a tiny point as small as one thousandth
of an inch in diameter.

Ultrafine welding may be accomplished by reducing
the power to a point where the metals will melt and not
vaporize. This reduced power is continuously fed to the
beam instead of in short pulses.

A GALLIUl\T—ARSENIDE LASER that operates at efﬁcicncies of 20-30% has
been devised by two physicists at the General Electric Research Laboratory.
Achieiving maximum performance when operated at about 20 degrees Kelvin,
the laser requires only ﬁve to six watts of power to produce over one watt of
output. The physicists believe that this represents the highest power yet
produced by a continuous—wave laser.

In the new laser, the gallium-arsenide crystal diode, containing the light-
emitting junction, is made extremely thin and is surrounded by another piece of
gallium—arsenide which serves simultaneously as heat conductor and electric
insulator. Because the junction crystal and the surrounding conductor-insulator
are essentially the same material, previous problems related to thermal expan-
sion have been eliminated and much more effective methods and materials can
now be employed to remove heat from the diode.

AN ULTRA-HIGH VACUUM CHAMBER has been
developed by the Westinghouse Corporation. The cham-
ber is a double—walled stainless steel container, which looks

something like a deep-sea diving bell. There is space

between the walls into which liquid nitrogen is pumped.
This lowers the pressure inside the vessel by reducing the
rate at which gas, dissolved in the steel itself evaporates
from the metal surfaces. A

Before being put into operation, the chamber is
“baked—out” at 750 degrees Fahrenheit. This bake-out
boils away most of the unwanted gases trapped in the sys-
tem and further reduces evaporation into the vacuum
chamber.

After bake-out and cooling with nitrogen, extremely
low pressures are attained in the chamber with only short
periods of vaccum pumping. A pressure of one—billionth
of a millimeter of mercury is achieved within one hour and
a pressure 100 times lower is attained in twenty hours.

The vacuum chamber is used to produce ﬁlms only ten
atoms thick. The ﬁlms are used in research on the physical
properties of thin ﬁlms, which are becoming of major im-
portance for the fabrication of molecular electronic struc-
tures and other advanced microelectronic devices.

LFC 

in total wing drag since the small
overall increase in proﬁle drag, due
to the increase in wing area, is more
than compensated for by the reduc-
tion in induced drag which decreased
because of the smaller angle of
attack of the wing.

This net reduction in over-all wing
drag achieved with LFC can be rep-
resented graphically as shown in‘ﬁg-
ure (A). Largerly a function of
span loading, the induced drag de-
creases with increasing wing area for
a ﬁxed aspect ratio and take off
weight. This is so because the angle
of attack of a wing may be decreased
if the area is increased. Induced drag
is reduced with a decrease in this
angle. However, skin friction drag,
a direct function of wing area, in-
creases as wing area increases. But
this increase is at a slower rate for
LFC planes because of the lower
skin friction drag coefficient assoc-
iated with the LFC laminar wing.
The inter—sections of the induced
drag and the skin friction drag
curves plotted in ﬁgure (A) re-
present the points where the maxi-
mum lift-to-drag ratios for an LFC
and a non-LFC plane occur. The
L/D ratio indicates the efficiency
or effectiveness of an airfoil. At
the point where it is largest, the
lift is a maximum and the drag, a
minimum. The LFC plane reaches
its maximum lift-to-drag ratio at a
lower drag value but a greater wing
area than the turbulent plane.

Several aerodynamic objectives
were adhered to in manufacturing
the special LFC wing. A correct

ispanwiseiiand chordwise pressure

distribution to minimize crossflow
velocities and aft chord flow separa-
ation was desired. Also sought was
a rapid pressure decrease near the
wing leading edge which would be-
come constant in the mid-chord
region with a gradual pressure build-
up toward the trailing edge. A
mid-chord local velocity of Mach
1.04 was desired. Lift was maxim-
ized, while local turbulence effects
were minimized. To keep the best
local-section lift coefficient constant
over the wing span, the leading edge
was twisted up 4° on the inboard
section. Increasing the angle of in-
cidence in such a manner could be
termed “wing wash in.” For the
same reason it was also necessary to
contour the wing tips and to thicken
the wing roots.

Extremely close tolerances for
optimum smoothness were maintain-
ed over the wing surface panels. The
maximum variation in depth over
a 10 in. span for waviness was
3: .002 in. Local roughness spots were
held to a depth of" not over .003 in.
Panel mismatch at joints was kept
to a maximum of .004 and .008 in.
when the panels were directly in
the air-stream and out of the air-
stream respectively.

A smooth wing surface is neces-
sary to achieve low friction drag
with LFC. Step surface differences
(also called roughness height, step
height, or gap length) can be greater
at higher altitudes without cancel-
ling out the benefits of LFC.

Special bonding techniques were
used to fulﬁll the precise LFC con-
tour and smoothness requirements

and to lower the ma11ufaeturing' cost
of the X-21A wing‘. The upper and
lower wing‘ skin panels, as well as
the leading‘ and trailing edge sec-
tions, were bonded. These panels
were attached to the ribs a11d spars
with mechanical fasteners. All pres-
sure bonding‘ was done in special
pressure base aluminum fixtures
which were wave-free and surface
matched to within .002 in. Each
ﬁxture was machined with a nu1n-
erically controlled profile mill to in-
sure this accuracy.

The wing was built from the out-
side-in to meet the required toler-
ances, instead of from the inside-
out as is commonly done. It is basi-
cally of box construction and is
fabricated in several steps. A typi-
cal center section skin panel is about
four feet wide and twenty feet long
when completed and is composed
of an inner and an outer-skin. The
outer skin contains the suction slots,
while the inner skin serves as the
wing fuel cell wall. Similar skin
panels were manufactured for both
the top and bottom of the wing.
Consisting initially of a .25 in. thick
layer of aluminum honeycomb sand-
wiched between two .04 and .032
in. aluminum ‘sheets, the outer or
top skin is bonded ﬁrst. Directly on
to this is applied a .02 in. thick
layer of AF-32 ﬁlm adhesive, con-
taining milled plenum chambers.
After the plenum chambers are
milled and suction holes to the
chambers are drilled, another sheet
of aluminum is added to complete
the outer skin. A bonding adhesive
is applied to the entire wing which
is then auto claved at 70 psi. Wing

 

‘This is a cross section of a typical X-21A wing skin panel. The span-wise suction slots and the plastic trubutary ducts
are visible on the bonded outer skin. The inner skin is rivitedto the aluminum stringers and serves as the wing fuel cell

wall.

40

Small tributary ducts are shown inside the larger air ducts during assembly of
the X-21A LFC wing. Ducts cover suction holes, milled plenum slots and surface
openings on opposite side.

leading edges undergo the same
process at 150 psi. Onto the outer
skin assembly “I” and “bird-leg”
type extruded aluminum stringers
are bonded alternately. The inner
skin consists of aluminum honey-
comb sandwiched between two
sheets of aluminum. On to it rib-
attach angles are fastened. It is,
in turn, riveted to the stringers to
complete the wing center section
panels. Spanwise suction slots are
then milled above the plenum cham-
bers in the completed panels with
standard jeweler’s saw blades so
that slot width tolerance can be
kept at i.0005 in. A special jig is
used to mill the suction slots and

plenum chambers and to drill the

plenum chamber passages. Next,
the panels are anodized in chromic
acid to protect the freshly milled
surfaces. Plastic tributary ducts are
then bonded to the under surface
of the outer skin. These Q to 8 in.
long ducts carry air from the plenum
chambers to the main air ducts
which lead to the suction pumps
located in the two wing pods.
Fastening of the leading and trailing
edge wing panels. which are of
web construction. to the assembled
center section panels is accomplished
in a mating jig.

Finally. LFC ducting and modu-
lating valves to control air ﬂow a1'e
installed. Each wing has 48 modu-
lating valves. Once the wings are

attached to the fuselage, the modu-
lating valves are the only means
by which the ﬂight engineers can
vary the suction to maintain lami-
nar ﬂow. Because of these unortho-
dox construction procedures, the
X-21A’s main wing spars take the
shape of the wing, instead of the
outer wing taking the shape of the
spars. Before the completed wing
is fastened to the plane’s fuselage,
the compressor pods and ailerons
are attached. Based on a cost analy-
sis, it was found that compared to
conventional turbulent wing assem-
blies, the LFC wing is less expensive
per pound when large numbers are
manufactured. This is so because
fewer parts and smaller tooling re-
quirements are needed.

Norair is improving and ﬂight
testing the LFC system installed 011
the X—21A. The 300—hour ﬂight test-
ing program at Edwards Air Force
Base in California will extend from
mid-May through October of 1963.
A gradual increase in Air Force
supervision over further tests will
probably occur in a future program
running through 1965. Norair built
a second backup X-21A which ﬂew
in July of 1963. If the ﬁrst X-QIA
does not have a serious mishap, a
separate testing program is planned
for the second.

Initial ﬂights of the X-21A have
shown its general handling char-
acteristics to be good. Its landing

speed’ is about 130 knots. In all,
ﬁve persons maybe carried in the
craft with ease. Foreign contan1in—
ants are kept out of the LFC system
by turning it on before take off.
Restarts of the LFC system can
be smoothly performed at an alti-
tude of 40,000 feet.

On its ﬁfth ﬂight in late B/Iay,
the X—Q1A’s suction system was
turned on for the ﬁrst time and full-
chord laminar ﬂow was achieved
over the outboard sections of the
LFC wing. The transition to lam-
inar ﬂow was very smooth and the
test pilot had to reduce engine power
by about 1,500 pounds of thrust to
avoid over shooting his prescribed
ﬂight speed of l\‘Iach .77 at 36,500
feet. Outboard of the ailerons lam-
inar flow was partially attained
even in 20 degree banks. All of the
areas around the ailerons occasional-
ly experienced laminar ﬂow. Ap-
proximately a 30% reduction in the
total air friction drag was realized
on these test ﬂights. Although LFC
was applied only to the X-Q1A’s
main wing, it provided enough drag
reduction to increase the climb rate
over the old B-66 conﬁguration

above 20,000 feet by 200 to 300 feet. _

per minute.

Several economic advantages are
possible with LFC. First, LFC is a
feasible means to accomplish friction
drag and operating cost reductions
without a major overhauling of pres-
ent day construction and mainte-
nance procedures. It is basically a
way to get more miles per pound
of fuel. Therefore either extended
range or aircraft weight savings,
due to the lower power output re-
quired at cruise altitude, can be
realized. Drag reduction studies
have indicated that the range of
current jet transports in the medium
and long range classes could be in-
creased 50 to 55°/r if LFC were ap-
plied to the main wing and tail sur-
faces only. However, a 30'/r increase
in the wing and tail surface sizes
would be necessary. Consider an
LFC airplane designed to have the
as a current jet transport. The LFC
drag reduction could save enough
weight to enable a 15‘7r lighter gross

41

.weight LFC craft‘ to performthe

"same job. Savings in structural

b weight would result from the smaller

engines and reduced fuel supply
carried. Airplane weight reduction
is favored for the following reasons:
(1) Material costs can be lowered.
(2) Present runways need not be
increased in size. (3) The take—off
and landing speeds will remain com-
parable with present subsonic jets.
(4) Sonic boom can be minimized
because of the lower wing loading.
Because of the smaller engines and
the reduced engine labor under oper-
ating conditions, LFC maintenance
costs should be less than for current
transports despite higher airframe
labor and material costs. For a sup-

in for low-level operations could‘ not

use the system advantageously.
Ways to overcome these handicaps
have not yet materialized.

Application of LFC to present and
future aircraft is being discussed’ by
Northrop and the Department of
Defense. Despite encouragement
from the Defense Department, the
Services have taken a dim View of
the application of LFC to multi-
purpose aircraft. And due to the
lack of current interest displayed by
the Federal Aviation Agency, super-
sonic LFC transports seem restricted
to second-generation aircraft.

Even though Northrop feels the
LFC system cannot be applied to
first—generation supersonic trans-

Each LFC compressor pod houses a low and high pressure compressor. Through
the exhaust exit the boundary layer air sucked in from the wing surfaces is

discharged for added thrust.

ersonic Mach 3 transport with a
450,000 pound gross weight and a
3,500 nautical mile range, these LFC
weight and drag dividends would
mean a 15% weight reduction and
a 20% range increase. Norair stud-
ies also pointed out the fact that the
fuel savings alone could conceivably
pay the purchase cost of an LFC
plane after 10 years of service. The
maintenance of LFC airplanes is
similar to that of current jet trans-
ports. Because of its 19-year experi-
ence with LFC planes, Northrop has
developed satisfactory maintenance
procedures.

But LFC does have some disad-
vantages. It operates best in speci-
ﬁc speed ranges at higher altitudes
and is not effective at low altitude.

_ Consequently multipurpose aircraft

42

ports, it is studying possible appli-
cation to the proposed CX-4 turbo-
jet transport, which may succeed the
Douglas C-133, and to the new
Lockheed C-141 turbofan transport.
Indications are that LFC would not
be economically feasible for the
C-141 unless greater range is desired.
The Military Air Transport Service
is urging the development of the
CX-4, which is being studied by
industry. If LFC is to be used by
this plane, it would be better to de-
sign the system into it from the
start rather than to modify the air-
frame later. Northrop investigations
indicate that for a representative
CX-4 fuselage and engine size, LFC
would reduce cruise power require-
ments by about 20%. Since LFC
would be most effective during

cruising; flight, additional i take off
propulsion might be needed.

In general, the future for LFCB

planes looks encouraging. In addi-
tion to increases of about 50% i11
either payload or range without in-
creased fuel consumption, operating
costs could be cut by 20%. With
LFC regenerative jet
engines, planes should remain aloft
for 4 days.

and new

Future design trends for subsonic
transports seem to point toward full
utilization of LFC. Because of three
future developments, these LFC
transports would not have a tradi-
tional appearance. Induced drag
should become a larger part of total
airplane drag due to reductions in
profile and parasite drag. Thus
wings of greater span and higher
aspect ratios but with the same
structural weight to strength effici-
encies will emerge to reduce induced
drag. Further aerodynamic clean up
will be desirable. And lastly, LFC
will be applied to fuselages and other
turbulent areas to lower parasite
drag.

Turning to supersonic aircraft,
LFC promises to reduce skin fric-
tion drag and to lower skin tempera-
tures. A lowering of skin tempera-
ture results from a lowering of the
convective heat transfer coefficient
associated with the laminar air flow
maintained by LFC. The coeffici-
ent is basically a function of the
lower velocity gradients in the lami-
nar boundary layer. LFC removes
this low velocity air layer. LFC
could reduce the equilibrium surface
temperature of a turbulent wing by
100°F. If the temperatures over a
wing can be maintained below 350°F
for Mach 3 flight, wing materials
other than steel can be used. Applied
to a typical fuselage, LFC would
decrease the total skin friction drag,
lower the structure equilibrium
temperature, and reduce boundary
layer noise. At lVIach 3 friction drag
is a large percentage of the total
airplane drag and will increase in
percentage as new methods to re-
duce wave drag develop. As ‘a
result, LFC will then become more
effective at supersonic speeds.

POST Versalog,
the slide rule for a lifetime

The respect for the accuracy and
quality of the POST Versalog grows
year by year. Teachers, students,
technicians and engineers—all have
full conﬁdence in the Versalog.

Every POST slide rule is con-
structed from specially selected and
seasoned bamboo. This is why the
Versalog has greater strength and
dimensional stability than ordinary
rules. Bamboo is an unusually tough,
long-ﬁber material, with extra re-
sistance to changes in humidity and
temperature. Natural, sealed-in lu-
bricants make Versalog an instru-
ment superior to all others in ease of
setting and adjustment. The longer
you use it the more smoothly it will
operate.

Versalog scales are easy to read
and unfailingly accurate. All gradu-
ations are engine—diVided. Every

marking is cut into the snow-white
bonded plastic face with a precisely
controlled knife-edge. They are
there for the life of the rule.

Like all POST slide rules, the
Versalog is unconditionally guaran-
teed against all defects in workman-
ship and materials. A Written war-
ranty accompanies each POST

ION EXCHANGE
ionization of rinse water and recov-
ery of silver. Capacity of the cation

A resin is approximately 4 lb. of

silver/cu. ft. of cation exchanger.
Silver is recovered at a chemical
cost of about $0.18/lb.

Obviously, in any well-run plat-
ing plant the coneentrationsiof silver
and gold in ﬁnal ﬂowing r.inses are
extremely low. However, ion ex-
change is ideally suited to the re-
covery of very small concentrations
of valuable materials; and gold from
plating rinse waters is frequently
recovered by passing the rinse water
through a strong-base anion ex-
changer, which picks up the gold as
an anion complex. A cubic foot of
anion exchange resin will recover
about $3,000 worth of gold. The
easiest method of reclaiming the
gold is simply to burn the resin.

Other commercial applications of
ion exchange for recovery of val-
uable materials include: zinc and
copper from textile wast-es, sodium
values from sulfite waste liquor.

REMOVING UNDESIRABLE

IONS

Deionization of water is an ex-
ample of removal of undesirable
ions from solution.

Passage of water through a cation
exchanger in the H+ form, followed
by a weak—base anion exchanger in
the alkaline form, results in remov-
al of essentially all ions except a
very few parts per million of sodium,
and the weak acids, carbon dioxide
and silica. Water passing through a
strong-base anion resin on the OH-
cycle will remove CO 1 and silica,
and the small residual (perhaps two
or three ppm.) will be in the form of
Na OH or Na? CO3. With a mixed-
bed deionizer, water with a conduc-
tivity of well below one micromho.
can be produced (less than 0.5 ppm.
total ions.)

Chemical-p r o c e s s applications
that correspond to the various
methods of deionizing water are
also in commercial use. Probably
the largest operations are in deion-
ization of sugar solutions and of
glycerin. Demineralizing of sorbitol
is another application.

44

TREATING SUGAR SOLUTIONS

At a large Canadian sugar re-
finery, cane sugar is puriﬁed by
mixed-bed deionization. At this
point, another extremely interesting
application for ion—exchange resins
is used. The reﬁned sucrose from
the mixed-bed deionizer passes
through a cation exchanger in the
hydrogen form, which results in
inversion to dextrose and levulose.
The cation exchange resin in this
case acts as a catalyst. It rarely
needs regeneration with acid, since
virtually all of the ionic content of
the raw sucrose solution has been
removed by the mixed-bed deionizer.

In other cases, sucrose is deion-
ized, but inversion is undesirable.
At a sugar refinery in Puerto Rico,
sucrose passes through cation and
anion exchangers in series. Inversion
in the cation exchanger is prevented
by operating at a temperature of 15°
C. or below at all times.

OTHER CHEMICAL PROCESSES

Removal of formic acid from for-
maldehyde is- accomplished with a
weak—base or intermediate-base an-
ion exchange resin. In recent years,
specifications have required reduc-
tion of formic acid to less than
0.002% from 43% formaldehyde at
temperatures as righ as 14«0F. Rie-
sults comparable to this are achieved
in a number of plants. The anion
resin is regenerated with sodium
hydroxide.

Concentrated hydrochloric acid,
particularly that produced by the
salt and sulfuric acid process, con-
tains enough iron to give it a yel-
low color. Iron in concentrated 14.«CL
is complexed as an anion, and is
readily removed by passage of the
acid through a strong-base anion
exchange resin in the chloride form.
Acid comes from the column water-
white and free of iron.

Removal of iron from hydro-
chloric acid is one of the most at-
tractive ion—exchange processes. The
anionic ferric chloride complex can
be broken down by reducing the
acid concentration, so that the resin
is regenerated with water.

HANDLING DETERGENT
CONTAMINATION

Contamination of surface waters,

and even some well waters with de-
tergents has led to a method of re-
moving alkyl benzene sulfonate
from water by means of an ion—ex-
change resin. When water contains
10 ppm. or less of ABS, economics
appear favorable on a once through
basis, at least for small volumes,
with the resin then discarded. For
concentrations of up to 100 ppm.,
regeneration seems desirable.

Here a strong-base resin is used
in the CL-form. ABS is very tightly.
bonded, so sulfates in the water
appear in the effluent long before
ABS breakthrough. Inorganic re-
agents alone will not elute the ABS
satisfactorily, but a combination of
acetone and HC is effective. Ca-

pacity for ABS is about 350 g. per ”

liter of resin.

In another application, small
amounts of dissolved oxygen can
be removed from water by means
of a strong-base anion exchanger
regenerated with s o d i u In sulﬁte.
This process is useful where water
recirculates in a closed system, such
as a radar or television transmitter
cooling system. Water passes
through a mixed-bed deionizer and
then through the anion exchange
resin. Free oxygen can also be re-
moved with a special oxygen-re-
moval resin that contains the cupric
ion and is regenerated with sodium
hydrosulﬁte and caustic soda. Re-
generation reduces copper ions to
metallic Cu. This resin has the ad-
vantage that it speciﬁcally removes
oxygen and will not exchange other
ions that may be in solution, so it
can be used on Waters containing
dissolved salts.

SPECIAL APPLICATIONS

A mixture of amino acids may be
separated from any nonionic impuri-
ties by adsorption on sulfonic-acid
cation exchange resin on the hy-
drogen cycle. The basic amino acid
only can be absorbed in neutral or
basic solution by cation resins on
the ammonium or sodium cycle.
Basic amino acids are also prefer-
entially adsorbed by weak-acid res-
ins such as the carboxylic type.
Dicarboxylic amino acids are pre-
ferentially separated from other

are in use in the laboratory.

characteristic medicinal taste. In
other instances, the purpose is to
cause slow release of the medication,
and in still others the resin is used
simply to stabilize a drug. For ex-
ample, a stabilized vitamin B-12
that is adsorbed on an ion exchange
resin is now being marketed by one
of the pharmaceutical companies.
ION RETARDATION
The unique properties of ion-
exchange resins as insoluble acids,

involving exchange of ions. One ex-
ample, not yet used commercially,
is ion retardation. This process em-
ploys a resin containing both anionic
and cationic exchange sites within
the same resin particle, so that the
resin will adsorb both anions and
cations from feed solutions. The
adsorbed ions are so weakly held
that they may be displaced from
the resin merely by rinsing with
water.

Separations occur because certain

«ions are held more tightly than

I
A

_,‘l‘

y .

Jothers. For example, ferrous sul-
fate may be separated from zinc

% sulfate, sodium hydroxide from
' sodium chloride, the

ammonium
chloride from zinc chloride.

Ion retardation may also be used
to separate an electrolyte from a
non-electrolyte. In this case, only
the electrolyte penetrates the resin
matrix, so that it is “retarded,”
while the non—electrolyte passes
through the bed. In this way, very
large organic molecules that are too
large to enter resin heads may be
separated from ionic substances.

ION EXCLUSION

Ion exclusion is somewhat similar

to ion retardation" in that organic
products may be separated from
ionic components by simply passing
them through a bed of resin and
washing with water. In this case,
conventional ion-exchange resins are
used. Ion exclusion is now being
used commercially fordesalting of
crude glycerin.

Ion exclusion is explained as fol-
lows. A column of ion.-exchange
resin includes three phases: a solid
network of the resin beads, a liquid
phase inside the beads, and a liquid
surrounding the beads. Low-mole-
cular—weight solutes diffuse freely
in and out of the resin liquid phase.
The organic nonionic solutes tend
to exist at the same concentration
in both the resin liquid and the in-
terstitial liquid: the ionic materials,
however, exist at a considerably low-
er concentration in the resin liquid
than in the interstitial phase. Thus,
if a solution containing ionic and
nonionic components (such as crude
glycerin containing sodium chloride)
is allowed to pass through a bed of
resin, and the column is then rinsed
with water, the salt will reach the
bottom ﬁrst since it has only to dis-
place the interstitial liquid. The
nonionic solution (such as glycerin)
must displace both the interstitial
liquid and the liquid inside the
beads, so it appears in the effluent
after the ionic material has left the
column.

Although only one commercial
application exists for these two
interesting processes, many others
are technically possible, and it is
difficult even after years of unsuc-
cessful effort to avoid being opti-
mistic about a process that can
make such separations without the
use of chemical regenerants, heat or
electricity.

Actually, just as in the many po-
tential applications for ion exchange,
the circumstances necessary to the
successful promotion of these proc-
esses are economic—crude glycerins
containing more salt than can be
removed economically now by ion
exchange probably will be treated
by ion exclusion when the price dif-
ferential between crude and reﬁned
glycerin is large enough. And other

products will be separated by these A

techniques when sufficient demand
exists to justify the equipment in-
vestment.

RESINS AS CATALYSTS

The unique properties of ion ex-
changers make them useful as ea-
talysts.

Natural and synthetic zeolites
have been widely applied as
catalysts by the petroleum reﬁning
industry in cracking and reﬁning
processes. Zeolite catalysts have
been of immense importance in the
cracking of oleﬁnic hydrocarbons
because zeolites eliminate the need
for cracking at extremely high tem-
eratures and pressures.

Thermal and chemical stability
limitations have inhibited use of
resin catalyst systems, although
many laboratory studies have been
made and a few commercial appli-
cations have been reported. Intro-
duction of the “macro-reticular”
resins promises at least a partial
breakthrough, since these resins are
highly resistant to oxidation and
are effective in nonaqueous systems.

One interesting application—the
Met-X process in which ion-ex-
change resins are used to purify a
conventional catalyst—has been in-
troduced commercially in the pe-
troleum industry. When the silica-
alumina ﬂuid cracking catalyst
becomes poisoned with metals, par-
ticularly aluminum, such metals can
be removed by contacting the
catalyst (in a slurry) with cation
exchange resin in the hydrogen
form. Fortunately, resin and ca-
talyst can be readily separated by
backwashing in an “elutriator” by
means of an upﬂowing stream of
water, taking advantage of the fact
that the demetalized catalyst has a
lower density than exhausted resin.
The resin, of course, is regenerated
with strong acid for re-use.

This system, already proved in a
commercial petroleum reﬁnery, is
closely analogous to many chemical
and metallurgical puriﬁcation proc-
esses. It is a good illustration of
what can be accomplished by the ap-
plication o-f ion-exchange technology
to the process industries.

NONAQUEOUS PROCESSING

45

Most ion exchange applications
involve aqueous systems. Where
the product stream being treated is
nonaqueous and not miscible solvent
permits “sweetening on and off,” so
that regeneration can be carried
out in the usual manner.

In one such example in commer-
cial operation, KOH and amines
are removed from an organic chemi-
cal by cation-anion exchange. Upon
completion of the loading cycle,
product is displaced from the resin
with isopropyl alcohol, and the al-
cohol then displaced by water. After
regeneration, or “stripping” with
acid and caustic, resins are rinsed
ﬁrst with water and then with iso-
propyl alcohol, and ﬁnally sweet-
ened-on With the organic product.
This entire sequence is automati-
cally controlled.

Other intermediate solvents that
have been used include methanol,
ethanol, and methyl ethyl ketone.
ION—EXCHANGE MEMBRANES

Much interest has been shown re-
cently in ion-exchange membranes.
These are very similar in chemical
composition to ion-exchange resins.
They are prepared by synthetic
techniques or by imbedding finely
divided conventional ion-exchange
resins in inert plastic ﬁlms.

The properties of these mem-
branes permits electrolytic migra-
tion of either anions or cations, de-
pending upon Whether the mem-
brane contains a cation or anion
material.

In a salt solution, equilibrium is
established between ions in the
water in the membrane and ions in
the solution around the membrane.
l\'Iembranes can be arranged to
transfer anions and cations simul-
taneously——anion and cation mem-
branes are alternated. to give a series
of cells.

The many interesting properties
of ion-exchange membranes suggest
innumerable applications——all such
applications, however, must face
searching economic analysis before
they can be considered practical.
At the present time, membrane
processes are not competitive with
other desalinization processes for
seawater desalting. Membrane sep-
aration, however, is the best tech-
nique for puriﬁcation of brackish
water in the 1,000 to 10,000 ppm.
electrolyte -concentration range. In
chemical applications, these are pos-
sibilities for desalting solutions,
solutions, purifying process streams,
concentrating waste solutions.

In general, membranes are ef-
ﬁcient for the removal or concen-
tration of a large amount of ma-
terial from a relatively concentrated
solution.

CHELATION

A weak-acid ion-exchange resin
made by Dow contains reactive
groups comparable to the solution
chelation agent, ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid. This “chelation
resin” has the ability to remove
traces of certain metallic ions from
aqueous mixtures containing higher
concentrations of other cations.

For example, small concentrations
of calcium and magnesium may be
removed from concentrated sodium
chloride brine by passage through a
bed of the sodium form of this
resin. The resin also separates
various heavy metal ions, such as
nickel and copper. Although not
yet commercially applies, it appears
promising in a variety of hydro-
metallurgical separations.‘

LIQUID ION EXCHANGERS

Much of the work in liquid ex-
change has been done by the Atomic
Energy Commission at Oak Ridge.
Such work has resulted in the pro-

duction of water insoluble primary,
secondary, tertiary, and, quaternary
amines that have been used in con-
centration and puriﬁcation of ur-
anium and vanadium.

Behavior of liquid ion exchangers
is analogous to that of the solid ion-
exchange resins. In acid solution,
the amine adsorbs the acid molecule.

The quaternary amine, like a.
solid strong—base resin, functions
in acid or basic media. Amines are
carried in organic solvents —— kero-
sens, benzene, or chloroform have
been used.

Aside from AEC work, liquid ion
exchange has been applied commer-
cially for metal recovery and waste
treatment. Liquid ion exchangers
can handle higher concentration of
ions compared to solid exchange
resins.

ECONOMICS

In general, ion exchange is eco-
nomically attractive for the removal
of small amounts of impurities or
when the product has a high price
tag. Besides the cost of the resin,
there must be taken into account
the cost of regenerant solution and
installation of such large equipment.
The cost of regenerant solution is
hard to decrease since a certain
substance such as sodium ions can-
not be replaced by another type of
ion. Insallation of equipment has
been cut down somewhat by manu-
facture of package equipment. This
equipment requires that it only be
mounted upon a foundation and
connected to plant utilities. As with
equipment, resin, etc., the economic
story of an ion exchange process
depends upon the process which
may vary from a very expensive one
to a very inexpensive process.

Authoor wishes to thank A. W. Michwlson for
use of material on ion exchange written in
the magazine “Chemical Engineering".

An Equal Opportunity Employer

This kind ofehemieal engineering
is not as easy as it Z00/as

An outmoded stereotype should not
scare a good Ch.E. off from a highly
satisfactory career in marketing. We
are proud to say that the job calls for
more than a collection of shaggy dog
stories plus a convincing manner of
taking two more strokes than the
customer on that dogleg 14th hole.

Often a marketing career in our
non-photographic operations starts
out much like the traditional concept
of chemical engineering, except that
you work on the customers’ production
problems instead of our own. Then
you get to meet a few live customers
who come to see what you are up to.
Maybe you are sent to a trade con-
vention where you meet more than a
few customers. To your amazement,
they seem to regard you as a foun-
tainhead of valuable technical infor-

mation in a given area. To your further
amazement you realize it’s true—they
do badly need to know exactly what
you are being paid to tell them and
show them. (Willy Loman never had
it so good.) By and by, you may do a
tour of duty in one of our ﬁeld sales
offices, or even get into the advertising
end. As another course, you may settle
down into liaison with manufacturers
of equipment that needs to be fed with
our plastics, ﬁbers, solvents, chemical
intermediates, or ﬁne chemicals.

We deﬁne the chemical marketer as
a chemical engineer who forges the
most rational links between what we
can most efficiently turn out and what
other companies can most efficiently
use. He is a hero of the chemical
industry today.

As for the chemical engineer of

different personality bent who, early
in his career, prefers to put down roots
in one of the three communities where
we manufacture—Rochester, N. Y.,
Kingsport, T enn., Longview, Tex.—we
need him too. And of course, diversi-
ﬁed as we are, we also need engineers
of other than chemical persuasion, to
say nothing of scholarly chemists and
physicists to lay down good, solid
foundations for all that engineering
and creative salesmanship.

T"ClU‘UL”D'l‘TUU‘"OUT-THINK A COMPETITOR?

Consider a Career
in Technical Marketing

Q. Mr. Smith, I know engineering plays a role in the design and manufacture
of General Electric products, but what place is there for an engineer in
marketing?

A. For certain exceptionally talented individuals, a career in technical market-
ing offers extraordinary opportunity. You learn fast what the real needs of
customers are, under actual industrial conditions. You are brought face-to-face
with the economic realities of business. You participate in some of the most
exciting strategic work in the world: planning how to out-engineer and out-sell
competitors for a major installation.

Q. Sounds exciting. But I've worked hard for my technical degree. I’m worried
that if I go into marketing, I won’t use it.

A. Don’t worry—you’ll use all the engineering you’ve learned, and you’ll go
on learning for the rest of your life. In fact, you’ll have to. You see, the basic
purpose of business is to sense changing customer needs, and then marshal
resources to meet them proﬁtably. That means that you must learn to know
each customer’s operations and needs almost as well as he understands them
himself. And with competitors trying their best to outdo you, believe me-
every bit of knowledge and skill you’ve got will be called into play.

' Q. ls that why you said you wanted “exceptionally talented people”?

 Q-pf-;;,A. Technical marketing is not everybody’s dish of tea. It takes great personal

‘drive and energy, and a talent for managing the work of others in concert with
your own. It takes ﬂexibility . . . imagination . . ingenuity . . . quick reﬂexes
. . . leadership qualities. If you’re nervous with people or upset by quick-
changing situations, I don’t think technical marketing’s for you. But if you are
excited by competition, like to help others solve technical problems, and enjoy
seeing your technical work put to the test of real operation—then you may be
one of the ambitious men we’re looking for.

Q. Now what, actually, does a man do in technical marketing?

A. Let me describe a typical situation in General Electric. A ﬁeld sales
engineer is in regular contact with his customers. Let’s say one of them makes
an inquiry, or the sales engineer senses that the time is right for a proposition.
With his ﬁeld application engineer, he determines the basic equipment needed.
Then he contacts the marketing sales specialist in the C-E department that
manufactures that equipment. The sales specialist, working closely with his
department’s product engineers, speciﬁes an exact design—realistic in function
and cost. Then the sales engineer and his supporting team try to make the
sale, changing and improving the proposition as they get cues from the competi-
tive situation. If the sale is made—a very satisfying moment——then the installa-
tion and service engineers install the equipment and are responsible for its
operation and repair. With the exception of the product design engineers, all
these people are in technical marketing. Exciting work, all of it.

Q. In college we learn engineering theory. How do we get the sales and busi-
ness knowledge you mentioned?

A. At General Electric, a solid, well tested program of educational courses will
quickly advance both your engineering knowledge and your sales capacities.
But perhaps even more important, you’ll be assigned to work with some of the
crack sales engineers and application and installation men in the world, and
that’s no exaggeration. A man grows fast when he’s on the sales ﬁring line. As
a FORTUNE writer once put it, the industrial sales engineer needs “that prime
combination of technical savvy, tactical agility, and unruliied persuasiveness.”

Laminar Flow

Control

    

By Ted J. Listek

Laminar Flow Control (LFC) is a significant step forward in aviation’s

swift progress. With LFC a 50% boost in range, payload, or endurance with-
out increased fuel consumption becomes a reality for aircraft.

Ever since the Wright Brothers
made their ﬁrst successful ﬂight,
airplane designers have been search-
ing for practical ways to extend the
effective range of their creations.
The answer to this problem has
been partially realized over the
years in the form of more economi-
cal engines, better fuels, lighter con-
struction materials, and cleaner
aerodynamic design. But the mili-
tary and civilian consumers still de-
mand greater range. A range increase
would mean longer on-station air-
borne time for anti-submarine, air
alarm, and missile-launch military
planes. Civilian planes would be
able to operate over a greater spec-
trum of ranges. Nuclear propulsion
is being developed, but difficult
technological hurdles have placed
this solution in the future.

Apart from nuclear propulsion,
the next best way to substantially
increase the range of today’s air-
planes seems to be with Laminar
Flow Control, LFC. Because LFC
can drastically reduce aerodynamic
drag, it promises to extend the
range, endurance, or p a ylo a d of
large aircraft by at least 50% with
no increase in fuel consumption or
gross weight. As a result, LFC is
being fully exploited by the United
States Air Force and is currently
undergoing an extensive testing pro-
gram.

As its name implies, LFC is a
means of maintaining and control-
ling the laminar flow of air over a
laminar surface. Formerly known as
low-drag boundary-layer c 0 n t r o l,
LFC was given its name to dis-
tinguish it from boundary layer con-

trol. Boundary layer control pre-
vents air ﬂow separation from a
wing surface by blowing high veloci-
ty compressed air over the wing
leading edge or the forward edge of
the wing flaps. On the other hand,
Laminar Flow Control removes air
from the wing surface by sucking it
through slots into ducts leading to
a pumping system.

To understand how and why LFC
improves airplane performance, it
is necessary to understand several
aerodynamic facts. As air passes
over a wing surface and is retarded
due to viscosity effects, a boundary
layer is formed. Laminar ﬂow oc-
curs when boundary layer air, or the
thin layer of air adjacent to the
surface of an airplane wing, moves
in nearly parallel layers that do not
intermix with each other. The ve-
