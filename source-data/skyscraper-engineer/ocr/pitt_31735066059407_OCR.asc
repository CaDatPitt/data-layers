With this issue, the SKYSCRAPER. ENGIN-
EER celebrates its second birthday. It has been
during this short span of two- years that the
SKYSC_RAPER ENGINEER has grown from
being a dream in the minds of a group of stu-
dents to the point where it is now, without a
doubt, the top student magazine at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. But it has not been easy; the
ﬁrst year found us witho-ut an office and very
little equipment. The second year has been more
William J’ Zehala fruitful; “space” was found for us in a small

corner of the Pitt News office. But the future is
much brighter. In the new engineering building
that is soon to be constructed, the SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER has a private office on the ﬁrst ﬂoor
adjacent to the main entrance.

It is this administration support added to the
student and alumni support that leads us to be-
lieve that in a few years, the SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER will rank among the top college en-
gineering magazines in the country.

At this point, we would like to introduce the
two men who will be taking over the magazine
for the next year; as editor, Jim Fallon and as
business manager, Paul Weiner. Good luck to
both of you!

One person who deserves much credit 1S Mr.

(soon to be Dr.) Donald E. Swarts of the Eng-
lish Department. It is from his English 39 classes
that we get many of our articles. On top of that,
he has been a tremendous aid in checking our
articles for correctness in English. ‘

   

In parting, we would like to thank all the mem-
bers of our staff who gave so freely of their time.
But we especially want to honor our six men who
are graduating for they have done most of the
work. From the business staff come two men:
Bill Zehala, business manager; and Herb Hickey,
advertising manager. The editorial staff loses
four men: Bill McCoy, managing editor; Paul
Cannon, photo editor; and the two co—editors,

Industry suffered a real shock last March when
the Engineers Joint Council in Washington issued
information regarding ROTC enrollment in engin-
eering schools. When this information is com-
bined with the estimated number of graduates
according to the American Society for Engineer-
ing Education, it becomes obvious that there will
be an extremely small number of engineers who
will be made available for industrial work in the
next few years.

The all—time high was reached in 1950 when
48,160 enginers graduated. Inasmuch as these
were largely veterans, they were nearly all avail-
able for industrial employment. The statistics
since 1950 may be summarized as follows:

Total ROTC Balance available
Year Graduates Enrollment for Industry
1951 37,904 6,000 31,904
1952 27,155 6,100 21,055
1953 22,500 6,800 15,700
1954 17,000 7,800 9,200
1955 20,000 12,000 8,000
1956 26,000 12,000 14,000

Engineering enrollment continued to decline
until last fall when the ﬁrst real gain was indi-
cated. This fact is reﬂected in the larger gradu-
ating class of 1956. The fact that only 8,000 en-
gineers will be available to industry in 1955 be-
comes more serious when one recalls that some
twenty to twenty-ﬁve thousand enginers are re-
tired or die each year. . _ _

Many different plans are being tried to alleviate
the shortage. Industry and some colleges are plan-
ning short—term non-credit technical institute
courses. These will be of some help in developing
technicians with very limited knowledge but such

a program can only assist in releasing engineers
fo-r higher level work.

The University of Pittsburgh has pioneered the
Co—operative Industrial Scholarship Plan which
was described in the January, 1953 issue of “The
Skyscraper Engineer.” This program leads ulti-
mately to_ a Bachelor of Science degree and thus
will help in supplying the real industrial need.

In general, it might be said that the engineer
shortage should prove to be beneﬁcial to the en-
gineer and go a long way toward upgrading the
ﬁeld to the status of a profession. Industry has
come to realize that many capable engineers have
been used on jobs which do not require engineer-
ing knowledge. Meanwhile, many unqualiﬁed per-
sonnel are in positions which require engineering
knowledge. A complete survey of their engineer-

/ing manpower needs is being undertaken by many

companies and such a survey should be under way
in many companies which are currently recruit-
ing hysterically on a large scale.

The seriousness of the situation is that many
industries have reviewed their administrative
flow sheet and found that their top management
personnel are about to retire and that they have
failed to develop competent persons to take their
places. They also realize that the best potential
source of industrial administrators‘ is to be found
in the engineering ﬁeld.

A number of individuals have recently inquired
about the size -of the various engineering depart-
ments at Pitt as compared with other schools. It
was surprising to ﬁnd that we are close to the
national average in all cases as shown in the fol-
lowing table:

WATER INJECTION

Run your Cadillac on cheap gasoline-

it’s possible with water injection system

BY ROBERT L. JOHNSON, CH. E. ’53

Want to get 35 miles to the gallon out of your
present car? Want rapid acceleration fro-m stop
lights? Want a quick starting motor even on sub-
zero mornings and extra power for passing and
hill climbing from your present automobile en-
gine? If so, don’t expect to buy all these im-
provements in the fifteen dollar water injection
unit you see advertised in bold face type and
glowing terms in the popular science magazines
or in the host of automotive magazines.

But water, and alc-ohol-water injection does
have much to offer the American driver. who is
tired of costly engine repairs, 10,000—mile oil
changes, 50,000-mile ring replacements, and cylin-
der “knock.” Water injection appears to be the
motorists sole hope for solving the “eternal tri-
angle” between octane rating, compression ratio,
and improved mileage so long as the United
States’ international obligations force the oil
refiners to put octane ratings on a variable scale.
Water injection can make possible the use_ of
extra-high compression engines for automobiles
in the high price range and medium compression
engines in the l-ow price range, without forcing
the corner gasoline station to install a third pump.
In short it offers advantages far out of proportion
to its cost, but it doesen’t, as the ads would in-
dicate, allow you to stretch your gas mileage by
burning water. _ _

The fact that increasing the compression ratio
increases the efﬁciency of an internal combustion

engine has been known for a long time. In 1880,
Dugald -Clerk established the fact experimentally.
The solution of the problems involved in increas-
ing the compression ratio have, however. spent
the time and research funds of many automotive
corporations.

The compression ratio of an automotive engine
is the ratio between the volume of the cylinder
when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke and
when it is at the top just before the spark ex-
plodes the gasoline. Consequently, increasing the
compression ratio means forcing a larger fuel—air
volume into the same compressed volume.

As the compression increases the temperature
of the compressed gases rises and there is a pos-
sibility of their igniting, spontaneously, before
the piston has reached the top of its stroke. This
action which causes a loss of power and back-
firing is known as preignition. Preignition may
also be caused by “hot spots” on the cylinder wall.

If the gas is successfully compressed witho-ut
preigniti-on, there is still the important problem of
autoignition to be considered. Autoignition is the
cause of knock in an internal combustion engine
It occurs after the spark has set up a flame front
moving through the compressed fuel—air mixture.
The flame front. with its resulting gaseous prod-
ucts, sets up a region of tremendous pressure in
that part of the charge not burned. When these
“end gases” ignite spontaneousl,y they release
energy at a rate as much as a hundred times
greater than that for normal combustion. The re-
sulting increase in pressure produces an audible
knock. These highly localized explosions also
produce hot spots on the cylinder walls which in-
duce autoignition.

The resistance of a fuel to autoignition is
measured by its octane number. The octane rating
of a fuel is found by matching the knock under
prescribed conditions of operation in a special
engine with reference fuels. These reference fuels
are iso-octane with an octane number of 100 and
n—heptane with an octane number of zero. Thus,
an octane rating of 70 indicates that the fuel has
the same tendancy to knock as a mixture (by
volume of 70 parts iso-octane and 30 parts
n—heptane.

The injection of water into fuel to prevent
engine knock has been known for a lo-ng time but
water injection has been advertised principally
as a means to increase mileage. Devices for water
injection have been sold to the public for ap-
proximately twenty years under advertisements
that read, “N-ow you can burn water in your car
engine.”

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

It was not until the advent of high-compres-
sion aircraft engines during World War II, and
the shortage of high octane fuel. that the armed
forces investigated the use of water as an anti-
detonant.

In July, 1946, the Consumer’s Research Bulletin
after investigating commercial water injectors,
rated only one injector with a B (satisfactory
rating), and prefaced its evaluation with the
comment that since the advertiser’s claims of
better mileage were groundless, the only future
for water injection was-‘with those drivers who
wanted to use low octane gas in regular auto-
mobile engines.

In October, 1949, when octane ratings were at

their all-time high the Bulletin stated that its
research indicated the primary value of water
injection was the “suppression of ping,” but that
injection also had a tendency to remove deposited
carbon from the cylinder walls. It gave a B (sat-
isfactory) grade to the Synchro-Valve Water Car-
buretor which had a “vaporizing pressure plate”
attached to the ﬁrewall so that the water was in-
jected as heated vapor. This injectorsold for
$15.00. The Gazda Octanator ($29.95) which re-
moved water vapor from above the radiator was
rated as unsatisfactory.
_ The first intensive investigation of water in-
jection for automobile engines was conducted by
the Vitameter Corporation. The Vitameter was
introduced in 1948 and 1949 on a limited scale
in Columbus and Cleveland Where it was ad-
vertised as a device to raise the‘ octane value
of motor grade gasoline. Despite this radically
different approach to injector advertisement,
2000 Vitameters were sold in Columbus during
the first six months.

Vitane,the anti-detonant solution used in the
Vitameter, while containing alcohol and tetraethyl
lead in addition to water, acts by approximately
the same mechanism as plain water injection.
The Vitane. well mixed with the fuel. provides an
initial cooling of the feed mixture‘ as it partially
vaporizes in the manifold. This has the effect
of reducing the fuel-vapor volume andof making
it possible to obtain more fuel in each cylinder.
This action is similar to that of the pre-cooled feed
used on some racing cars. It provides to a lesser
degree the same affect as a supercharger. As the
piston compresses the fuel mixture. the alcohol
and water exert a cooling effect and prevent the
end gases from attaining a temperature where
they wo-uld ignite spontaneously.

Experimentation has shown that the optimum
anti-detonant solution contains 85% alcohol
(of which half should be methanol) and 15%
water. to which is added 3 c.c. of tetraethyl lead
per gallon. This solution raised the value of clear
run. 58 octane gasoline, to 77 octane when a 15%
by volume injection was used.

The use of Vi.tane to raise octane numbers
would be economically unfeasible if it were neces-
sary to continually add solution in any large
volume. However, according to George Mann in
Science Digest, the only time high octane gasoline
is required by an engine is during the 5 to 10 per
cent of the time when it is laboring. High test
fuel fed at any other time is of no particular
value since (contrary to public opnion) high
octane fuel provides no more power than regular
fuel except under those conditions when regular

MAY, 1953

fuel would knock.

The Vitameter feeds anti-detonant only when
required by the engine; which is when the engine
is laboring on a steep grade or accellerating
rapidly. Under these conditions. the manifold
pressure increases and actuates a diaphragm con-
trolling the fl-ow of Vitane.

Using Vitane this way, it could produce 100
octane gasoline from premium gasoline with pre-
Korean War octane ratings (approximately 80
octane) for 2.8 cents per gallon. This ﬁgure is
based on Vitane at $1.20 per gallon. According to
C. H. Van Hartesveldt, vice—president of the
Vitameter Corporation, mass production of Vitane
and sale on a nation-wide basis, would bring the
cost down to $.75 per gallon. On this basis, 100
octane fuel could be produced from premium fuel
at a cost of 1.5 cents per gallon.

Perhaps more important than its use on present
day cars is the freedom which injection may give
to automotive engine designers. Since the devel-
opment of high compression engines has always
had to go hand in hand with the increases in
octane ratings of the reﬁneries. progress has
necessarily been handicapped. Water injection
points the way to. the use of tomorrow’s engines
today—the operation of high compression engines
on regular gasoline. It has been estimated that an
8 to 1 compression ratio will drop automotive fuel
consumption 15 to 20 per cent over the average
at the close of World War II. Cadillac, with a high
ton-mile load,.has had driver reports of 25 miles
per gallon using a compression ratio of slightly
over 7 to 1.

Probably the most important aspect of water
injection to the present car owner is its effect on
reducing engine wear. Prolonged operation with
autoignition will deﬁnitely damage the engine.
The damage may take the form of cracks in the
cylinder head and pistons, or as scored piston
rings. Unburnt mixture is also a prevalent cause
of soot and sludge formation which induces
engine wear.

In a taxicab test run in Cleveland, engines of
cabs investigated after 23,000 miles showed that
the cabs which were not equipped with Vitameter
injectors showed the following wear:

1. Cylinder bore wear-56% more than cabs
with injectors
2. Piston ring gap—50% more than cabs
with injectors -
During the ﬁnal 10,000 miles. the unequi_pped cab
used 64% more oil. With the reduction of main-
tenance costs as their major goal. several bus
companies have already installed Vlitameters.

As -octane number and compression ratios have
advanced over the past quarter century. each oc-
tane increase has supplied the public with a gas-
oline considerably higher in antiknock qualities
than a large portion of the motoring public re-
qured. Since octane increases have been obtained
cheaply. this has not been too signiﬁcant. How-
ever. since future octane increases appear to be
expensive, and since there are a larger number of
cars satisﬁed by today’s octane ratings than at
any time in the past, the great need is for a
method of adapting today’s gasolines to tomor-
row’s engines. It is highly probable that in the
near future. water injection may be looked upon
as the emancipator -of the ultra—high compression
engine.

16 THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Loun SEEDING   

_ One of the simple questions least understood
in meterology is: How does rain form in the
clouds?

Clouds are formed when moist air is cooled
below its dew point, and the water vapor con-
denses into tiny droplets. Each drop forms around
very small particles of smoke, dust or salt spray
which are always present in the atmosphere in
concentration of thousands per cubic centimeter.
The cloud droplets are a hundredth to less than
a thousandth of a centimeter in diameter. They
are so light that they fall very slowly and they
usually evaporate before they can reach the
ground.

In 1931 the Norwegian meterologist, Tor Ber-
geron, suggested that if a relatively few ice
crystals were somehow formed in a supercooled
cloud, they would rapidly grow into snowﬂakes.
As they fell to lower altitudes, they would melt
and form raindrops. Bergeron, however. did not
explain how the seeding ice crystals were formed
in clouds in the ﬁrst place.

Dr. I. Langmuir and Dr. V. J. Schaefer, came
to the conclusion in their studies at the General
Electric Research laboratory, that in winter sup-
er cooled stratus clouds from which no snow is
falling, even though the temperatures in the
clouds are bel-ow freezing, have not any appreci-
able number of effective snow nuclei.’They be-
lieved that there must then be something in the
atmosphere that caused water droplets to change

to ice only at certain times and under certain_

conditions.

In order to duplicate those conditions in the
laboratory, Schaefer decided to try a home freez-
ing unit of the type used for food storage. He
lined it with black velvet so that when a beam
of light was directed into the box. he could get
a good view of what happened inside of it. Then
he breathed into the box and the moisture con-
densed forming fog particles that were just like

Old time rain god all wet; modern _medicine men produce , rain I through i:l3uid‘“seeding

ordinary cloud particles, although the temper-
ature was about —23° C. But no ice crystals
formed. He tried different substances dusted into
this box to get. ice crystals to form but without
much success.

One July day. Schaefer dropped a piece of dry
ice into the chamber in order to lower its tem-
perature. In an instant the air was full of ice
crystals which persisted for a while after he re-

moved the dry ice. After this discovery he co-n— .

ducted a number of experiments and showed that
even a tiny grain of dry ice would transform the
supercooled cloud in the cold box to many mill-
ions of ice crystals. When he examined them
under the microscope. he found that they were
miniature six-sided snowﬂakes.

Schaefer showed that this effect caused by
the dry ice was solely due to its low temperature
which he determined as being —39°C.:.5 degrees.

In other words, a super-cooled cloud cannot exist
below this temperature. Calculations showed that
a single grain of dry ice dropped into a super-
cooled cloud could produce ten million billion ice
crystals, enough ice crystals to seed many cubic
miles of clouds.

The ﬁrst seeding ﬂight took place in November,
1946, over Pittsﬁeld. Massachusetts, at an alti-
tude of 14,000 ft. with a temperature of —20° C.
Dry ice pellets were dropped into a cloud from
an airplane. In a matter of minutes snow was
falling from the base of the cloud. Experiments
proved that it was also possible to seed a super-
cooled cloud by ﬂying just below it and dropping
dry ice.

Schaefer showed that the supercooled fogs that
often hug the ground in winter time. can be

considerable area merely by swinging a piece of
dry ice on the end of a string. Meanwhile Lang-
muir developed a chain—reaction theory to explain
how rain can form in comparatively warm clouds.
He suggested that a sizeable water drop suspend-
ed in the updraft of a cumulus cloud will grow
by_coll1sion with ﬁne cloud droplets. Eventually
this drop becomes so large that it is unstable
and breaks into two or more larger drops.

These in turn grow and divide by the same
mechanism until the chain reaction ﬁlls the cloud
with large drops, which fall as rain when the up-
draft ceases. This theory predicts that certain
cumulus clouds can be caused to give rain by
introducing into them a few large drops to initi-
ate chain reaction. Experiments using this
method have been carried out with apparent
success.

At that time Dr. Bernard Vonnegut of Gen-
eral Electric was investigating another technique
for causing supercooled clouds to turn to snow.
It occurred to him that some substance very sim-
ilar to ice in its crystal structure might serve
as the nucleus for the formation of ice crystals
in the cold box. He went through all the known
tables of crystal structure and, from more than
a thousand compounds, selected three substances
that he thought might have possibilities: lead
iodide. antimony. and silver iodide.

This cloud of ice crystals was created at 27,000 feet
over Schenectedy, N. Y. by an airplane seeding the air
with silver-iodide smoke. The circle is about ﬁve miles
in diameter.

He dropped samples of each of these three
substances into- Schaefer’s cold box but the re-
sults were almost negligible. Then he decided to
try silver iodide, but this time as a smoke. First
he vaporized silver iodide and then he introduced
into the cold box the smoke resulting from the
rapid condensation of this vapor. It was a com-
plete success. Further investigation showed that
his earlier negative results with silver iodide were
caused by impurities. Although silver iodide is an
excellent nucleus for ice formation. it is not quite
as good a nucleus as ice itself. because it requires
lower temperatures. The tiny ice crystals pro-
duced by the use of dry ice can grow. once they
are formed, at any temperature up to the freez-
ing point of water. whereas silver iodide particles
are active as a seeding agent only when the tem-
perature of the cloud is 26° F. or lower.

Silver iodide is an effective seeding agent even
when it is dispersed as smoke consisting of par-
ticles as small as one-millionth of a centimeter
in diameter. When the smoke is introduced into
a supercooled cloud, not all of the particles react
immediately to produce ice crystals. The reac-
tion is somewhat like the decay of radioactive
material. Within a certain time one half of all
the silver-iodide particles will have formed ice
crystals, and this period, by analogy with radio-
activity, is called the half-life of the smoke. The
half-life of silver-iodide smoke in a supercooled
cloud depends somewhat on the size of the smoke
particles and a great deal on the temperature.
At 0° F., silver-iodide particles have a half life
in a supercoo-led_cloud of a few seconds, while at
14° F. the half life is about a week.

Because silver iodide, unlike ice, does not melt
or evaporate under atmospheric conditions, it
need not be introduced directly into the clouds.
Laboratory experiments which showed that one
gram of silver iodide in the form of smoke should
provide enough nuclei to seed from 100 to 1000
miles of supercooled cloud, suggested that silver-
1od1de smoke generators operated on the ground
could innoculate enormous volumes of the atmos-
phere with ice—forming nuclei, which would ﬁnd
their way into supercooled clouds. This could be
accomplished by vaporizing silver-iodide at a high

temperature or injecting a spray of silver-iodide
solution into a hot ﬂame.

A fact discovered as the result of one of Von-
negut’s studies is that silver-iodide particles do
not react immediately as ice-forming nuclei when
introduced into a supercooled cloud of water drop-
lets. Even 50 minutes after introducing a smoke
sample into the cold chamber, ice crystals could
be seen to form at a measurable rate. The general
conclusion reached as a result of this study was
that the rate of reaction at 13° C. is 30 to 40
times than at 10° C.

The nature of silver-iodide is such that its
effectiveness as a seeding agent might be re-
duced by the action of ultraviolet and near—ultra-
violet radiation from the sun. Far greater quan-
tities of silver-iodide particles might be required
for seeding operation under conditions of bright
sun light than would be needed at night or under
conditions of cloud cover.

Much attention was paid to stratus clouds. In
a ﬂight test in March, 1947. seeding was con-
ducted on stratus clouds. Looking down on the
cloud, it was observed, ﬁrst. that a deep groove
had been produced along the seeded areas, and
snow fell. Soon the sky cleared so that there
was a c-loudless area 20 miles long and 5 miles
wide where the seeding had taken place, although
there were no other breaks in the overcast in any
direction. Further tests on stratus clouds produc-
ed similar results. The conclusion was therefore
reached that cloud seeding could produce holes
in stratus clouds. Thus a plane should be able to
clear a hole for itself. The result would be not
only to increase visibility but also to eliminate
icing conditions. _

In experiments carried out in 1949 many worth-
while observations were made. It was sometimes
desired to produce rain and sometimes to pre-
vent it. On the one hand, by overseeding the top
of a high cumulus cloud, rain would be prevented.
The top of the cloud would ﬂoat off into a high-
er altitude Where it would be blown away by the
counter tradewind. If, on the other hand, the
cloud was seeded just above the freezing level,
heavy rain might be produced.

Ordinary rock salt used as a cloud seeding
agent could be used in clouds of above freezing
temperatures, unlike seeding materials as silver-
iodide and dry ice which are effective in clouds
of below freezing temperature.

Certain salts, in ﬁne-particle form, have an
ability to attract and collect the tiny molecules

of water vapor which are present both in clouds
and in open air and in collecting them can vir-
tually “grow” tiny raindrops heavy enough to
fall. These raindrops similarly can “sweep up”
or collect droplets in their path, resulting in full-
ﬂedged raindrops and general rainfall. It is believ-
ed that nature uses these salts in such fashion
to produce much of the consistent rain in coastal
areas. since clouds and air blown in from the sea
contain salt particles.

Dr. Schaefer pointed out that in order to pro-
duce rain, an ideal number of salt particles in
relation to the amount of moisture available must
be present. Nature evidently provides that ideal
number. since rainfall is consistent along coastal
regions. One way to unbalance this ideal number
of salt particles present would be to- add great
quantities of tiny rock-salt crystals in a tech-

nique called “over-seeding.” By over-seeding, less
moisture would be available per salt particle,
which would, in effect, stunt the growth of poten-
tial raindrops sufficiently to prevent their becom-
ing heavy enough to fall. As the mass of air and
clouds moves further inland, however, it would
gain more moisture on the way which eventually
would be sufficient to strike an ideal balance again
with the salt particles and thus initiate ranfall.

Dr. Schaefer believes that the success of this
o-ver—seeding technique will depend upon using
rock salt crystals in a certain critical particle size.
Particles too big or too small will not work effi-
ciently or may not work at all. Dr, Schaefer said
that rock salt could be dispensed from the ground
into the atmosphere by special coke-burning gen-
erators, which would ﬁrst vaporize the salt, then
project it out at high velocity. which would cause
it to cool quickly in the form of ﬁne solid par-
ticles. Too light to fall, these particles would be
carried into the atmosphere by upward wind cur-
rents, thus preventing rain.

From the theory of cloud seeding and the ex-
periments conducted can be concluded that
tho-ugh man cannot yet control all phases of the
weather. he may create clouds by seeding super-
saturated air under certain conditions and cause
signiﬁcant changes in the natural course of the
weather.

TITANIUM - A New Aircraft Metal  

New uses for an old element makes possible more powerful, fasten, lighter

airplanes.

Ever since man has designed and ﬂown heavier-
than—air aircraft he has sought to reduce the in-
herent structural weight of that aircraft and its
component parts, and with technological advances
of the last decade, he has been seeking a metal
which has favorable properties at elevated tem-
peratures.

The choice of the primary structural metals
used in the aircraft industry was limited, until
very recently, to various aluminum, magnesium
and steel alloys.

In general, the aluminum and magnesium all-oys
are used where a high strength-weight ratio is
desirable. Where higher strength is necessary at
elevated temperatures the steel. alloys, rather
than the lighter aluminum alloys, are used be-
cause the aluminum alloys 1-ose much 0-f their
strength at higher temperatures. But now, with
the recent debut of commercial titanium, the air
craft designer is showing more and more interest
in this comparative newcomer among metals.

The primary reason for the interest -of the de-
signer of aircraft and jet engines in titanium and
its alloys is the weight saved when it is used in
place of steel and aluminum. Some titanium alloys
now have a tensile strength of 175.000 lbs. per
sq. in.. and newer alloys with 200,000 lbs. per
sq. in. are being developed.

These strengths approach the strengths of the
best steels. Certainly titanium alloys weighing
only 60% as much as steel and having strength
equal to that of steel reduce the weight of the
component parts of an aircraft.

Figure 1 is a plot of strength-weight ratio ver-
sus temperature for several of the principal
metals used in aircraft structures and power-
plants. From this plot it is apparent that the
titanium alloy, RC 130B, exceeds the other mater-
ials in strength-weight ratio through an appre-
ciable range in temperature. _

The high strength-weight ratio of the metal
has recently been utilized by Westinghouse Elec-
tric Corporation in manufacturing a lighter
weight jet engine. In this engine various parts,
such as compressor disks, bolts, compressor and
turbine liners, and sheet metal parts which were
previously made of heavier metals because of high
strength requirements, were_ replaced by the
lighter weight titanium. This replacement re-
sulted in equal strength of _all parts and a much
lower weight for the engine. Figure 2 shows
where titanium was used in the engine. Other
aircraft ﬁrms also have recognized the advantage
of this metal as a weight saver.

Douglas Aircraft Company will save 200 pounds
weight on the DC-7 type airplane which is now
being built. They have used titanium rather than
stainless steel for engine nacelles, landing gear
doors, and engine ﬁrewalls; Boeing Airplane
Company is now using large titanium components

20

to save weight in the experimental B-52 eight jet
bomber; and Northrop Aircraft Incorporated has
conducted a study of the use of Ti—75 aircraft
rivets, cold driven at room temperature and re-
ported they tested to a 50% greater ultimate
shear value than 24 ST aluminum alloy rivets,
and 30% greater ultimate tensile strength.

Structural materials used in Navy carrier based
aircraft must be to the best possible degree, re-
sistant to salt air corrosion and materials used
in construction of the jet engine must withstand
the corrosive gases produced by the engine. Here
again, the answer to these demands can be better
met by the use of titanium. The metal is more
resistant to salt air than 18:8 stainless steel,
which is considered to be very good in this re-
spect. It is likewise very resistant to the corro-
sive gases encountered in the jet engine.

Another of nature’s recently posed problems
for the aircraft designer was that of the “heat
barrier.” Aircraft of the supersonic variety now
fly at speeds which result in generation of sig-
niﬁcant quantities of heat. The heat results from
the friction of the air against the metal “skin”
surfaces as the aircraft ﬂashes through the
atmosphere at high speeds. As the kinetic energy
is transformed into heat energy, the resulting
temperature .rise is directly proportional to the
square of the velocity. Figure 3 illustrates the
skin temperatures encountered at various flights
speeds and altitudes.

‘Let us brieﬂy consider the effects of supersonic
ﬂight speeds upon an aircraft skin made of
aluminum alloy, 14ST6. At a speed of 1400 mph,
which 1S entirely possible with experimental
rocket propelled aircraft, the skin equilibrium
temperature (Figure 3) is about 300° F at 3-0,000
feet..Referring to Figure 1, the strength of
aluminum alloy, 14ST6, begins to decline mar-
kedly_ above temperatures of about 250° F. With
unofficial speeds of 1800 mph, this would indi-
cate a skin temperature of about 500° F at
30.000 feet. At this temperature. increased loss
in strength could become critical. and with the
coming higher aircraft speeds. 14ST6 will be im-
practical from the consideration -of strength alone.
Also at elevated temperatures, wing and skin
surfaces warp and twist out of shape due to linear
expansion.

With the use of titanium alloys for the aircraft
skin such a problem could be solved more effici-
ciently. If a titanium alloy such as RC?13B (Figure
1) were used. the strength of the skin would not
undergo any drastic reduction at temperatures
where the aluminum alloy’s strength declines
rapidly. This titanium alloy retains its excep-
tional strength up to temperatures of 800° F,
which would permit speeds in the neighborhood
of 2300 mph or more. The utilization of the
titanium alloy would also reduce considerably the
warping and twisting of the skin. which is due to

linear thermal expansion. Titanium’s coefficient
of expansion is less than one-third that for
aluminum.

At continued temperatures exceeding 800° F,
titanium suffers an irreversible absorption of oxy-
gen and nitrogen, which rapidly reduces its ulti-
mate and yield strengths and causes it to become
brittle. Experiments in which the surface of the
metal is coated with a ceramic material to prevent
the absorption of oxygen and nitrogen at high
temperatures show promising results. If this de-
ﬁciency could be overcome so that titanium would
remain useful up to temperatures 1600° F, which
is well below its exceptionally high melting point
of 3150° F, a whole new ﬁeld of application would
be uncovered. Combustion chambers, inner and
outer cones. tailpipes, and transition liners for jet
engines would use large quantities of the metal.

At present, the demand for titanium for the
aircraft industry is nine times the supply and
it is estimated that in 1954, even with an ex-
pansion of titanium producing facilities, the de-
mand will still exceed the supply by four times.

The cost of the metal is high, as compared
with that of aluminum and magnesium. because
of the low quantity production. But various com-
panies expect to develop, in the immediate future,
new processes for reﬁning which promise to re-
duce the present production cost by about 80%.

Although a survey of past history indicates
that no new material can completely replace all
other materials in an aircraft structure. titanium.
with its high strength-low weight uniqueness and
its excellent heat resistant properties. appears
to have carved for itself a large place in the air-
craft industry.

The beginning of the hot rod story is hard
to trace, because for all we know the very ﬁrst
car might have been a hot rod, built for the
sole purpose of making something that would
go faster than the horse-drawn carriage. For
all practical purposes though, we can say that
hot rodding was started sometime in the late
nineteen twenties when some unknown auto en-
thusiast stripped the fenders off his Ford, pull-
ed the cylinder head and shaved it to boost the
compression ratio. Not long after he did this
ﬁrst bit of experimenting, he interested others
in his hobby and soon races on the dry lakes
of Southern California became more or less a
regular affair.

No one kn-ows exactly how many large and
small developments in the automotive industry
found their origin through the amateur engin-
eering of the Hot Rodder. A well known engineer
once said, “The automotive industry watches
very closely the activities of the Hot R0-dders and
custom builders.” Frequently ideas are adapted
to production cars from the custom cars.

James Taylor is a fun-
ior in the Mechanical
Engineering Department.
He graduated from Craft-
on High School in 1950
Jim has been actively‘ in-
terested in hot rods for a
long time, and has a

ience from part-time work

tions. He is a member of

Now after a brief idea of how hot rodding
began, let’s take a look at some of the methods
used by present Hot Rodders to obtain that
neck—snapping acceleration, increased efficiency
and more power, which ever seems to be the
ultimate goal of most automobile manufacturers
today.

Basically there are ﬁve ways to accomplish
our goal. These are: (1) Stepping up the cubic
inch displacement, (2) Increasing the volume
of the mixture taken in on the intake stroke,
(3) Raising the efficiency’of combustion, (4)

- Increasing mechanical efficiency, and ﬁnally (5)

Raising the peak rmp. In some of these methods,
we have many different trails to follow but in
most cases, only two or three branches of each
step will be mentioned.

In method number one, there are two things
that we can do to increase the total displacement
of an engine: enlarging the cylinder bore and
lengthening the stroke of the crank shaft. When
enlarging the cylinders, it is wise not to _go
over 3/16” because the wall thickness varies
on different stock blocks. The average stock block
is considered to be 100 hp, with a displacement
of 236 cubic inches. If we should over—bore
cue cylinders 1/3 inch, there would be an ad-
dition of 21 cubic inches to the total displace-
ment and this would boost the horsepower by
81/2. Looking now at the results obtained from
increasing the stroke, we ﬁnd that if the crank-
shaft arms are lengthened 1/3 inch, only 7 ad-
ditional cubic inches can be had or about 3
extra horsepower. Therefore it can be seen that
boring is a much more effective way of getting
those extra horses than stroking.

Now, to go to method number two which is
increasing the weight and volume of the mix-
ture that is taken into the cylinders on the in-
take stroke. This could very well be the biggest
item in increasing the power of an engine.

Contrary to popular belief that multiple car-

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

buretion increases fuel consumption. we ﬁnd that
with the addition of properly synchronized car-
buretors fuel consumption actually decreases. The
basic thing that is to be accomplished here is
to increase the total cross—sectional ﬂow path
area, because ﬂuid mechanics teaches us that
pressure loss increases as the square of the rate
of ﬂow. According to this theory, if we double
the carburetor throat area or in other words
cut the velocity of the gases in half. we ﬁnd that
the pressure losses will be cut to 1/4 of their
original amount. It should be mentioned that
these energy or pressure losses are caused by
two things: (1) Friction due to the roughness
of the channels through which the mixture must
travel and (2) turbulence within. the gas that
is due to the sharp bends or obstructions be-
Eween the carburetor and the combustion cham-
er.

Crankshaft Strbking,

Because most stock engines have intake mani-
folds made of cast iron which has a rough sur-
face, the friction can be reduced by smoothing
the passage with a small grind stone. If more
than one carburetor is to be used. the stock mani-
fold is not usually employed and most multiple
carburetor manifolds are made of aluminum,
which is smooth in comparison to cast iron. The
turbulence in the manifold can also be reduced
by rounding the corners of the passages and
by removing small amounts of material items
such as valve stem guides. Care must be taken
not to remove an excess of metal or weakened
sections will result.

The addition of extra carburetors can be car-
ried to extremes and this only results in cut-
ting the velocity of the mixture so much that
at any speed below one thousand rpm. the fuel
will not be distributed evenly to all cylinders,
causing some to be ﬂooded and others starved.

Next on the list is increasing the efficiency
of combustion. There are several ways to do this:
by raising the compression ratio. keeping the
cross-sectional area of the combustion chamber
as small as possible, providing a strong enough
spark to jump the gap without lag. and using
an exhaust system that can quickly and ade-
quately rid the engine of its burned gases.

The compression ratio can be raised by either
milling some metal from the stock cast iron cyl-
inder head or if it is desired to have a ratio
greater than 7.5:1, the iron head should be re-
placed by aluminum which will dissipate heat
more rapidly due to its physical characteristics
and also due to the cooling ﬁns and larger water
passages that these heads have. This results in
a cooler combustion chamber, which prevents de-

By keeping the cross-sectional area of the
combustion chamber small, we mean that the

MAY, 1953

distance the ﬂame must travel should be as short
as possible to insure quick, even combustion. At
present. the most efficient chamber is hemis-
spherically shaped with the spark plug located
in the center. While mentioning spark plugs, pro-
bably the biggest help.in obtaining a hot spark
would come from adding a hotter than stock
induction coil.

As far as exhaust systems are concerned, there
isn’t a V-8 engine produced today that can be
operated at top efficiency with a single muffler
and tailpipe. By doubling the exhaust carrying
capacity and using mufflers without baffles. the
efficiency can be raised approximately 8%.

Method number four says we must increase
the mechanical efficiency. To do this, friction
must be reduced as much as possible. Probably
the most recommended ways of doing this are:
(1) change from four ring stock pistons to three
ring aluminum ones, although this Will more
than likely increase oil consumption; (2) Re-
move unnecessary material from the crankshaft,
connecting rods, ﬂywheel, and pistons; (3) check
very closely to see that the bearings and journals
are perfectly round; (4) increase clearances
throughout the engine and along with this boost
the oil viscosity and oil pressure.

In our ﬁnal move to power, the peak rpm must
go up. Although most of the things mentioned
previously will contribute to this, probably the
most valuable addition in this direction would be
a reground camshaft. When installing a reground
cam in an engine with adjustable Valves, ad-
justable valve tappets should also be installed.
The last items to include with the new cam are
heavy tension valve springs to keep the valves
from ﬂoating at the increased speed.

stock cam, giving quicker opening and closing, longer
open periods, and nearly the same lift.

In conclusion it might be said that when we
set out to soup up a stock engine. we are not
exactly endearing ourselves to the automobile
manufacturer. Can we blame them for looking
antagonistically at us when we try to make a
100 hp stock car deliver 150-200 hp? They have
designed their engines to push their 4000 pound
cars around with a fair degree of snap. to give
them an effortless cruise at 60 mph, and to run
approximately 50.000 miles without major re-
pairs. Very few people realize that the average
stock engine is seldom called upon to produce
over 50 hp. When we ask an engine to turn
5000 rpm several times a day, we are asking for
trouble. Realizing this, a real Hot Rodder allows
for it in his souping procedure, and only smiles
at the decreased reliability and increased wear
that must go along with his performance.

The new digital computer, known
as the “OARAC” (which stands for

Computer), can deliver rapid-ﬁre
answers in typewritten form to
mathematical puzzles which would
take expert mathematicians years to
solve. It can make as many as 100

problems involving aircraft design,
guided missiles and ballistics.

One typical problem that has been

complex that 212 8-by-10 inch pages
of numbers are needed just to state
the problem. In solving it, so many
millions of operations are involved
that Without the aid of a computer
it would probably never be solved.

G-E engineers say that an expert

A NEW RELAY RECORD

RELAYs—which are high-speed switches—are the
-nerve centers of the dial telephone system. In a split
second, they set up a connection and then are off
to direct the next call. In a large city, more than
1000 relays are used every time a number is dialed.

Now a new wire spring relay—devised by the
Bell Laboratories—is at work. With only 11 instead
of 70 parts, it is twice as fast, uses less power, and
costs less to make and maintain than its predecessor.

LIGHTWEIGHT PLASTIC PIPE

Pipelines of tomorrow may be lightweight plastic.

The lightweight plastic pipe, designed to be
used in place of steel pipe lines, has interested
large oil companies.

One o-f the ﬁrst large—scale applications of plas-
tic pipe to the California oil industry was the
recent laying of some 4000 feet of 2 and 3-inch
clear transparent plastic pipe in the Rio Bravo
ﬁeld of San Joaquin Valley. This pipe was laid in
a matter of several hours. The line consisted of
1600 feet of three-inch and 2400 feet of two-inch,
the latter including about 400 feet that was
pushed through an existing old and corroded steel
pipe line that eliminated having to dig a ditch
inside the yard of the cycling plant in the Rio
Bravo ﬁeld.

The plastic pipe, a clear, transparent material,
is known technically as cellulose acetate butyrate.

On the particular job mentioned above, many
features were effectively demonstrated. The job
consisted of stringing a fresh water line to re-
place an old three-inch steel pipe line that was
laid in 1937 and in the intervening years had be-
come badly corroded and had developed numer-
ous leaks. That far less expense was incurred in
digging the ditch was demonstrated when the
company found it was unable to arrange for a
conventional ditch digging machine because at
the particular time, all available machines were
busy replacing or repairing damage done by the
July 21 earthquake. Last minute arrangements,
however. brought forth a road grading machine

to cut the ditch. By using the corner of the blade,
and making three passes over the right-of-way,
a very serviceable V-shaped ditch was made.
From 18 to 24 inches of cover was provided which
was ample for the protection of the pipe, and at
an estimated cost of from one—fourth to one-half
of what it would have cost to cut a conventional
square-bottom ditch.

Numerous advantages result from the use of
plastic pipe in certain applications found in oil
ﬁeld installations. Among the most important of
these are its ease of transporting to the job, the
speed that is possible in connecting joints and
laying the line in the ditch, its inertness to rust
or corrosion, and being made of a non—conducting
material, its ability to withstand electrolysis. Be-
ing ﬂexible, the pipe can be strung in ditches
whose bottoms do not have to be smooth; can
be laid in a curve to go around obstacles or turn
corner-s of moderate radius.

The plastic pipe, being transparent, can show
quickly if anything is in the pipe causing it to
produce trouble. It is very light and can be car-
ried very easily by men working with it.

A light pickup truck, carrying 16 bundles of
pipe joints, is brought to the place where men
are to start a new pipe line. With the pickup
truck moving along slowly and without stopping,
two men can easily string a bundle of 320 feet
of pipe in a matter of only several minutes. A
two-man “spread”. working without equipment
other than a can of solvent and a brush, then can
connect up the pipe and lay it in the ditch.

Connecting and laying the pipe is done rapidly,
the average being at the rate of about one joint
a minute, including cementing, laying the pipe
in the ditch and moving on to the next joint.

Connecting a joint consists of ﬁrst ‘fpainting”
the outer surface of the male end _and inner sur-
face of the belled end with the pastic solvent. This
is repeated immediately afterward and the two
ends then are thrust together, oi1e_is given a
quarter turn to facilitate driving it in smoothly
and snugly. The joined sections are held together
ﬁrmly for a few seconds while the solvent is set
up. Once set, the joint then is laid on the ground
and the crew proceeds to the next joint.

crease the playing time of a 7-inch “45” record,
without using a larger disc?

Sixteen months of research gave the answer,
“45 EP”—Extended Play. Public response con-
firmed this as the most important achievement
in the new recording speeds. More than :2 million
RCA Victor “45 EP” records were b“ught in the

FANNY THE DC VARIABLE

Once upon a time on a beautiful starry night, Rube, the Com-
pound motor and Fanny the variable resistor, decided to go over to
the D. C. Lab where they had heard the delta-wye, a local fraternity,
was having a magnetic blowout and the volts were jumping all over
the place.

On the way to the Lab, they stopped off for a short circuit at
the center tap. The lights were low and there was an electro-static
charge in the air ——it was a perfect night for fusing, Rube ordered
Gulf pride, 40 weight, while Fanny preferred a double copper oxide.
They were having some mutual induction when Fanny screamed, “Ye
gads, I’ve ripped my last pair of insulators,” and ran for the “Little
Resistor’s Room”. Rube knew all the time that she was having a
surge current, and that she had made a poor excuse.

At this time, Jake, the unloaded Generator, a big time, three
phase, delta connected power dispersor, was sitting at the busbar
getting his bearings oiled. There were whispers all over the room
that his efficiency had dropped ——poor Jake——he needed his power
factor raised. He eyed Fanny very closely as she ambled toward her
table. Then he purred very softly, “Hey, honey, did you come out of
a hot wire instrument?”

Her quick retort shamed Jake down to his slots. “No-, you small
time sinewave pusher, don’t get your ﬁeld excited. I’m with a cumul-
ative-co-mpound motor.” With that she swished back to Rube and
ﬁnding him fused out, she glanced frantically around the room. Her
gaze came to rest on Jake’s big yoke. “My”——she thought, “What big
pole faces, he has”. Jake seeing the look in her eyes nearly fell out of
synchronism. He regulated his voltage and walked over to her table
and immediately apologized for his pulsating manner.

After several squirts of juice and numerous double oxides, Jake
was showing her his vector diagram and she was displaying her vari-
able connections. She even let him hold her contact!

They decided to leave the center tap and take a ground return

over to the D. C. Lab and shake an ohm.
On entering the delta-wye dance at the D. C. Lab, they met the

president, Mr. Stray Load. He was looking for his date, Miss Floating
Neutral.

After taking a few ampere-turns around the ﬂoor, he decided
that she was just the one for him. Man! She sure had a well shaped
hysterisis loop. At Fanny’s request to sit the next one out, Jake took
the opportunity to tell her how his interpoles were wound. He clasped
her end connections tightly and whispered, “Fanny, my love, I think
I am just the generator for you,——I am drum wound, have a rotating
ﬁeld, can be hand regulated, have no leakage reactance, and am ap-
proved by Good Housekeeping. Darling, will you be my little vari-
able load rheostat ?”

“Oh, J ake”. she sighed, “You know I can’t resist your long shunt
ﬁeld”.

WHILE taking the course, two engi-
neers developed a revolutionary new
circuit breaker mechanism.

“Our experience shows what can happen
if you work with people open to sugges-
tion. We found men of this kind at Allis-
Chalmers, and it has given us a special
pleasure in our job.

“We started out like most other graduates
with a hazy idea of what we wanted to do.
After working in several departments, we
requested that part of out training be at
the Boston Works of Allis-Chalmers,
where circuit breakers are made.”

New Design Principle

“Circuit breakers soon became an obses-
sion with us, and we got the idea of de-
signing a hydraulic operator or triggering
mechanism for these breakers. Most of the
operators for big breakers are pneumatic.

“Unsuccessful attempts had been made
in the past by all circuit breaker manu-
facturers to build hydraulic operators.

of the largest ever built in the United
States, this spindle is nearing completion
in the Allis-Chalmers West Allis shops.

The important thing is that no one at
Allis-Chalmers said, ‘Don’t try it—it won’t
work.’ ”

Start New Era

“To make a long story short, our study of
the problem led us to the hydraulic accu-
mulator and high speed valves being used
by the aircraft industry. These had not
been available when earlier attempts were
made to build a hydraulic operator. With
these highly developed devices to work

Inexperienced hands, after making up only sev-

vision, easily become experienced and can be al-
lowed to continue by themselves. An improperly
made—up joint is readily detected, for a holiday,
if any, easily is seen in the ﬁlm bonding the

In a previous application of this type of pipe
to the oil industry, an operator in the Long Beach
area found it necessary to replace an old com-

Some 660 feet long, the line had been giving con-
siderable trouble with leaks caused by extensive
corrosion and it ﬁnally was necessary to replace
it. Ordinarily. with steel pipe. the job would have
required the digging up of the old pipe line and
replacing it with new. welded or thread-and—col-
lar pipe. However. even then it ultimately would
have had to be replaced due to the corrosion prob-
lems existing in the area.

Using the plastic pipe, the operator was able
to open a bell hole at each end of the line and
push through the 660—foot string of the two-
inch plastic tubing, an operation that required a
matter of only about two hours. At one point in
the operation with 200 feet of the new pipe al-
ready inside the old line. an obstruction was en-
countered which prevented further passage of the
plastic pipe. The problem was overcome quick-
ly however. by plugging the tubing and ﬁlling
the old line with water.

This ﬂoated the new line and enabled work-
men to shove it past the obstruction. From that
point on no further trouble was experienced. The
new line. in the several months that it has been
in service. has given excellent results. Flow
through the smaller line is adequate inasmuch
as the skin friction of the tubing is so much less
than that of conventional steel pipe.

The good qualities and advantages are mak-
ing companies stand up and take notice of the
new plastic development in pipe lines. Because
of the great wonder of this pipe. corrosion will
soon be partially, if not entirely, eliminated. This
new device is becoming known all over the world
for its efficiency.

Cost of plastic pipe. while slightly higher in
the initial outlay. actually is being gradually re-
duced as manufacturing facilities are increased
and plastic ingredients become more plentiful. Al-
though slightly higher, initially the slight differ-
ential in price between it and steel pipe of com-
parable sizes, is said to be more than made up by
the reduced cost of transporting. laying and main-
tenance, particularly when it is employed in a
service where. because of corrosion or other fac-
tors. entire lines otherwise would have to be re-
placed. or at least extensively repaired at fre-
quent intervals.

Future development of this plastic pipe may
prove to be efficient in the pipe lines of tomorrow.

JOBS ARE BEING ENGINEERED

Your future lies not in the obvious, the
complete, the established. It is forming on
the drawing boards, in the laboratories
and within the minds of men.

Don’t look to what is, but to what shall
be. Fortune comes from the new.

This Air Force Radio tower, a 1218-foot
equilateral steel triangle, is the tallest in
the world; second among man-made
structures only to the Empire State Build-
ing. It was designed and fabricated by
Republic’s Truscon Steel Division. The
operation of this tower is government
business. But its stresses and its resistances
are Republic’s. The engineering of this
lacy pinnacle will ﬁnd adaptations in the
near future. They are being shaped now
in the metallurgy and design departments
of Republic. A quarter mile above the .
earth, the steel toys with gales and totes
an unpredictable burden of ice. And the
facts of these achievements shall be trans-
lated by men of your generation into the
still higher pinnacles of the future.

Republic’s Truscon Steel Division leads
the world in radio towers. Republic’s other
divisions push forward other frontiers. N0
manufacturer makes more kinds of steel,
nor any better. But the making of steel is
only one phase of Republic. Our many
divisions design innumerable products,
fabricate thousands of items.

Here lies the new—the realm for young
"men of talent and vision.

HOW TO DESIGN
PRODUCTS TO SAVE
MATERIAL AND COST

MOST products can be built stronger,
more rigid with welded steel con-
struction than possible any other way.
Steel is 3 times stronger and twice as
rigid as traditional gray iron. As a result,
usually less than one-third the actual
weight of metal -is required.

Pound for pound, steel sells for a third
of what gray iron costs at the cupola. This
lower cost per pound plus fewer pounds
needed to carry equivalent load means
that initial material costs can be cut as
much as 85% of prices charged for cast-
ings alone to which fabrication, of course,
must be added.

In addition to its inherent superior
"physical properties, steel is easily formed
to efficient engineering shapes such as I
beams and channels. Thin wall structural
sections are possible by concentrating
material at outer edges in load carrying
members where each pound of metal does
the most good. When steel is utilized to
the fullest, a product of welded construc-
tion generally can be manufactured for
half the cost.

The examples show how a typical ma-
chine part was changed over from cast
iron to welded steel construction. The
cost saving of 50% resulted from less
material and expense by eliminating sev-
eral machining operations such as mill-
ing and drilling. Cleaning and painting
operations in the former cast design were
also avoided. The new welded steel base
is both stronger, more rigid and has a
clean streamlined appearance to improve
selling appeal.

tures to save steel and lower cost is pre-

EARL W. SUTTON

 

Earl W. Sutton, a senior in Petrol-
eum Engineering, built these models
last January while recovering from
an attack of polio which he can-
tracted while working in the oil ﬁelds
of West Texas last summer. The
models were -built partly from mem-
ory of what he had seen in West
Texas while working as a roustabout
for the Magnolia Petroleum Co., and
from material obtained from Petrol-
eum Engineering textbooks. Because
of his illness he missed the fall
semester of this year and of course
had a lot of time on his hands.
Building the models gave him some-
thing to occupy his mind and his
time while waiting f0I‘ the Spring
semester to start. It was something
he had been wantin-g to do for a
long time but for which he had never
had time until recently.

The two model drilling rigs, which
represent about one hundred hours
of work, are built almost entirely of
ten feet. The smaller model is of a
standard 80 foot cable tool drilling
rig such as seen in the Pennsylvania
balsa wood. They are both built to

an approximate scale of one inch to
and eastern oil ﬁelds. These types of

rigs are usually used for drilling in
hard formations and for completing
wells drilled by other methods. This
rig is “powered” by a one cylinder
steam engine.

The larger model represents a 140
foot rotary drilling rig. It is complete
with miniature diesel engines, slush
pumps, draw works, rotary table,
shale shaker, travelling block swivel,
kelly and pipe racks and drill pipe.
This one took the longest to build,
about 75 hours. Drilling rigs of this
type are used in the southwestern

and Mid—Continent ﬁelds where the
formations are softer, although there
are several rigs Of this type Operat-
ing in Pennsylvania. Rigs of this size
and type are capable of drilling to a
depth of 15,000 feet.

PROFESSOR R. C. GORHAM

    

 

 

On April 7, 1953, Professor Robert
C Gorham of the Electrical Engin-
eering Department was conﬁrmed by
the state Senate as a member of the
State Registration Board for Profes-
sional Engineers for the full six year
term effective as of May 3, 1952, the
day he was appointed by Governor
John Fine. Professor Gorham was
initially appointed by Governor Duﬂ
on July 21, 1950 to be a temporary
member until December 22, 1952.

Although a native of Kansas, Bob
Gorham grew up in southern Ne-
braska, attending Franklin High
School from which he graduated in
1912. He continued his education at
Nebraska Wesleyan and, after World
War I, graduated in Electrical Engin-
eering from Cornell University in
1924.

Before coming to Pitt in September
1925, Professor Gorham spent three
years in the Navy, another three
years teaching E.E. at Cornell and
one and a half years as a special
tester for the United Electric Light
and Power Company in New York
City,

Here at Pitt, honors have come to
him in the form of membership in
Eta Kappa Nu, Sigma Tau, Omicron
Delta Kappa, Sigma Xi and Sigma
Pi Si-gma. He also serves as chairman
of the Engineering Honors Commit-
tee and as adviser to Eta Kappa Nu
and the student branch of the
American Institute of Electrical
Engineers.

The Torrtngton Needle Bearing

. . .shaft hardness determines effective load capacity

 

The economy of the Torrington
Needle Bearing is due in part to
the fact that the shaft usually
serves as the inner race. Thus,
since the shaft is an integral part
of the bearing, its load capacity
limits the capacity of the bearing
assembly. In order to obtain the
full rated load capacity of the
Needle Bearing, it is necessary
that the shaft be at least surface-
hardened to the equivalent of
Rockwell C-58.

Loads and Speeds
Related to
Shaft Hardness

Because of material or design
limitations, it is sometimes de-
sired to run Needle Bearings on
shafts softer than the recom-
mended Rockwell C-58. This can
be done safely providing the bear-
ing loads and speeds are not too
severe. However, the capacity of
the bearing assembly is only as
great as the load capacity of the
shaft, regardless of the rated load
capacity of the bearing as indi-
cated in the catalog. The shaft
capacity decreases very rapidly
as the surface hardness is reduced
below the recommended Rock-
well C-58 minimum hardness.
Figure 1 shows this very clear-
ly. It can be seen that reducing

MAY, 1953

the shaft hardness to Rockwell
C-52 gives a resulting load factor
of .5. In this case, the catalog
rating must be multiplied by .5
in order to obtain the true capac-
ity of the bearing assembly.
Unheat-treated, cold rolled
shafting will only carry 2%-3% of
the bearing’s rated load capacity.
The speed of the application is
also important in determining
proper hardness to assure satis-

Figure 2 illustrates this effect.

H ardened Inner Races
Available

When it is either impossible or
impractical to harden the shaft,
it is necessary to use an inner race

which will provide the required
surface for Needle Bearing oper-
ation. Inner races are available
for all sizes of Needle Bearings.
When used, inner races should be
securely fastened to the shaft by
clamping against a shoulder, by
snap ring, or by press ﬁt.

ings into a piece of equipment

tion, the economics of using inner

for all types of engineers

HANCES are—if he has what it takes—a young engineering
C graduate will ﬁnd at General Motors the career opportunity
he’s seeking.

And there are sound reasons why.

In the ﬁrst place, General Motors makes so many diﬁerent kinds
of products, there is need for almost every type of engineering
skill. These products range from automobiles and trucks to
refrigerators, fractional horsepower motors and Diesel engines.
GM defense contracts include shells, bombsights, range ﬁnders,
tanks and gas turbine engines.

Yet, this great variety of work is widely distributed among GM’s
33 manufacturing divisions, its 111 plants in 55 towns and cities
throughout the United States. So although each division has its
own engineering department, each can count upon the facilities
of GM’s central research and engineering laboratories.

It’s this combination of big-time opportunity and local intimacy
that fosters so many notable engineering careers at General
Motors. In fact, many of the top positions at GM right now are
occupied by engineering school graduates.

Why not think about this, as your time of decision draws near?

How to give an 8—speed miller
greater spindle accuracy

This milling machine has 8 speeds, from 62 to 2870
RPM. To hold the spindle in accurate alignment at these
various speeds, design engineers mount it on Timken®
precision bearings. Long-lasting milling precision is
assured. Spindle accuracy can be controlled because
Timken bearings are adjustable. And they provide more
than enough capacity for any tool load.

line contact of T|MKEN®
bearings keeps spindles rigid

Because Timken bearings carry the load along the
line of contact between rollers and races, they give
a wider, more rigid support to the shaft. And the
tapered construction of Timken bearings enables
them to take radial and thrust loads in any com-
bination. End-play and deﬂection in the shaft are
practically eliminated.

Richard J. Conway, tehigh ’5i, selects
Manufacturing Engineering at Worthington

RICHARD CONWAY checks
cutting tool with machinist
before milling a pump casing.

After completing his general training which brought him in
contact with all departments, Richard J. Conway decided that
manufacturing engineering was his ﬁeld. He says, “I chose the
Manufacturing Engineering Department after completing my
general training at Worthington because as a graduate in In-
dustrial Engineering I can learn the practical aspects of my
ﬁeld while applying theory I learned in college.

“The personnel of this department work together as a team
toward the solution of the numerous problems which arise
daily. We have the cooperation of all other departments in the
corporation in getting the necessary facts pertinent to the solu-
tion of these problems. In the course of our day it may be
necessary for us to meet the Plant Manager, Chief Engineer,
Comptroller, several department heads, clerks, foremen, ma-

chinists and many others throughout the company.

“I have contributed to the solution of many problems han-
dled by this department including metal spraying, machining
procedures, purchasing new equipment and designating proper
dimensions to obtain desired ﬁts between mating parts.

“I enjoy -my work because I’m doing the work I want and
my formal education is being supplemented with practical
knowledge gained from the tremendous wealth of knowledge
available to me at Worthington. I know from personal contact
with many other departments in the Corporation that Wor-
thington can and will ﬁnd their young engineers a spot which
will give them the same opportunities as have been afforded me.”

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

PHOTOGRAPHY AT WORK No. 2 in a series:

Knitting mi so vcs he shorta c,
attracts and keeps in staff

Halld Knit Hosiery Company of Sheboygan,
VVisc., knitters of VVigwam Socks, found
many potential employees resisted jobs
simply because they didn’t know the sort of
opportunities offered.

To explain job opportunities,
to enlist an efficient staff, here's how
this company used photography

Like most businesses today, the knitters of

VVigwam Socks found the getting and keep-

ing of good people on jobs a major problem.

Especially since some of the work had names

strange to highly desirable personnel—such
as looping, box dry-
ing, etc.

But Hand Knit’s industrial relations director
knew the potency of photography—used it
to show applicants what their work would
be, What they wear, what their boss looked
like. From then on an efﬁcient factory force
was more easily lined up—and kept. Any
business proﬁts when cameras and ﬁlm get
to work.

There are so many new uses for photog-
raphy being found, that many well-qualiﬁed
graduates in the physical sciences and in
engineering have been led to ﬁnd positions
with the Eastman Kodak Company.

If you are interested, write to Business
and Technical Personnel Dept., Eastman
Kodak Company, Rochester 4, N. Y.

 

FEW companies can
offer as broad a range of career
opportunities as General Electric.
Whether a young man is inter-
ested in science or engineering,
physics or chemistry, electronics
or atomic energy, plastics or air
conditioning, accounting or sales,
employee relations or advertising,
drafting or jet engines . . . he can
plan for himself a G—E career.

The training programs sum-
marized here are only a few of
the “open doorways” that lead to
successful careers in a company
where big and important jobs are
being done, and where young
people of Vision and courage are
needed to help do them.

If you are interested in build-
ing a G-E career after graduation,
talk with your placement officer
and the G—E representative when
he visits your campus. Meanwhile,
for further information write to
College Editor, Dept., 2-123,

This is our HORIZON

T his is the “radiant energy spectrum” — the horizon
for the 1600 professional engineers engaged in re-
search and development work at Sylvania’s more than
a dozen laboratories.

The research and development under way at Sylvania’s
laboratories reaches, in some way, into virtually every
phase of this spectrum. In the broad ﬁelds of lighting,
radio‘, electronics, television, Sylvania engineers are
constantly ﬁnding new challenges to stimulate their
imagination, new opportunities to further their careers
in a steadily growing company.

Sylvania offers college graduates expanding opportuni-
ties to build a truly successful and challenging pro-
fessional career.

For information on, Sylvania’s program for graduating
engineers, see your Placement Oﬂice today — or you
may write directly to Sylvania’s Supervisor of Techni-
cal Employment.

Hughes Research and Development
Laboratories, one of the nation’s
leading electronics organizations, are
now creating a number of new
openings in an important phase of
their operation.

Here is what one of these positions oﬂers yon:

THE COMPANY

Hughes Research and Development
Laboratories, located in Southern Cali-
fornia, are presently engaged in the
development and production of ad-
vanced radar systems, electronic
computers and guided missiles.

THE NEW OPENINGS

The positions are for men who will
serve as technical advisors to govern-
ment agencies and companies
purchasing Hughes equipment—also as
technical consultants with engineers of
other companies working on associated
equipment. Your speciﬁc job would be
essentially to help insure successful op-
eration of Hughes equipment in the ﬁeld.

HUGHES

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

LABORATORIES

Scientiﬁc and Engineering Staﬁ
Culver City, Los Angeles County, California

MAY, 1953

THE TRAINING

On joining our organization, you will
work in the Laboratories for several
months to become thoroughly familiar
with the equipment which you will later
help users to understand and properly
employ. If you have already had radar
or electronics experience, you will ﬁnd
this knowledge helpful in your new
work with us.

WHERE YOU WORK

After your period of training—at full
pay—you may (1) remain with the
Laboratories in Southern California in
an instructive or administrative capac-
ity, (2) become the Hughes represen-
tative at a company where our equip-

H ow to apply:

ment is being installed, or (3) be the
Hughes representative at a military base
in this country—or overseas (single men
only). Compensation is made for
traveling and moving household effects.
and married men keep their families
with them at all times.

YOUR FUTURE

In one of these positions you will gain
all-around experience that will increase
your value to our organization as it
further expands in the ﬁeld of electron-
ics. The next few years are certain to
see large-scale commercial employment
of electronic systems. Your training in
and familiarity with the most advanced
electronic techniques now will qualify
you for even more important future
positions.

See your Placement Office for
appointment with members of our
Engineering Staff who will visit
your campus. Or address your
resumé to the Laboratories.
