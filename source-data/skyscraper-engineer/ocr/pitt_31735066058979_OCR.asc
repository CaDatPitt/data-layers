Can there be this kind of excitement in engineering?

This console is part of a computerized system that speeds
tests on new products and components.

* If you need more excitement. you might find it
on the 42 golf courses in the Rochester area.

A long beautiful drive . . . just the hint of a slice . . . and almost on
the green. Now, address the ball. . .concentrate—and, wham! to a lie
four feet from the cup.

That’s the excitement of the game that gets a golfer up at dawn

on Saturdays.* We think it’s analogous to the excitement that keeps some
of our technical people on the job after hours: the pleasure of personal
achievement in solving problems for which there are no book solutions.

One of the concerns of our management is to see that our professional
people experience this kind of excitement. They know where it can

lead . . . a payroll that numbered 3,000 in 1960, for example, now exceeds
24,000 . . . products that have literally revolutionized communications and
are having a world-wide impact on such problems as illiteracy.

That’s why we suggest that if you’ve been missing out on the kind of
professional satisfaction you expected from an engineering career,
look into what Xerox can provide in the way of engineering
excitement. Your degree in Engineering or Science can qualify you for
some intriguing openings in fundamental and applied research,
engineering, manufacturing and programming.

The choice of an electric car is obvious in that it gives 0H
negligible pollution. The electric car offers many other
advantages, primarily economical. It can be manufactured
by modern assembly line and automation techniques in the
price range of the compact cars. The car would have a
minimum of maintenance expenses since it has fewer moving
parts and would not require periodical tune ups and other
services.. It's smoothness, quietness, versatility, dynamic brak-
ing and low cost of operation are other major attractions.
The problem of petroleum resources in the distant future
has brought new interest in the electric car for the present.

The electric car is very practical and its value is readily
realized as an eljfective solution to metropolitan transporta-
tion problems. With a maximum range of eighty miles, and
a top speed of sixty miles per hour, it excellently fits driving
needs to the grocery store or rapid transit station and is in
general a round—the-town vehicle.

The Caltech car, powered by lead-acid batteries, has a

greater range compared to MIT’s nickle-cadmium batteries,
though the latter is a high power battery. The lead-acid
battery pack used in the Caltech car cost only $600.00 com-
pared to the reported cost of $19,000.00 for the nickle—cad-
mium batteries. The production of lead per year is eight
times that of nickle and twenty times that of cadmium, mak-
ing its availability of sufﬁcient quantities to meet demands a
factor in choosing it for a possible production scale battery
for the electric car.

During transportation wee-k, September 9-14, both cars
were exhibited at the Smithsonian Institution in Was'hiiig—
ton, D. C. The exhibit was sponsored jointly by the Depart-
ment of Transportation and Smithsonian.

The mass production of electric cars in the future has be-
come more than a possibility, and has been estimated that
they will capture over 10% of the new car sales in the next
ten years by the Cleveland—based Predicasts, Inc.

In-place Combusﬁon Process: A New Crude Oil

Recovery Mei-hod With Greai Poienfial

The in situ combustion process utilizes the heat of combus-
tion resulting from burning a portion of the oil in the reser-
voir to effect a higher and faster oil recovery. The oil vis-
cosity and the surface tensions are substantially decreased by
the thermal energy. On the other hand, the oil volume is
increased by thermal expansion. Further the rate of oil
evaporation is increased and cracking also takes place with
the rise in reservoir temperature. A happy combination of
all these favorable oil property changes with thermal energy
creates a new frontier for oil production practice.

In the ﬁeld oil production pilot tests, the in situ combus-
tion process involves at least two wells: one air injection
well and another production well. The depth of these wells
and the distance between them vary with the reservoir and
production conditions.

While the ﬁnal test ground of a new recovery process is
in the oil ﬁeld, tests underﬁeld conditions are time—consum—
ing and costly and it is difficult to obtain reproducible re-
sults. Thus, laboratory experiments in which one can easily
manage and control the process parameters are necessary.

The Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineer-
ing has initiated a research project using a physical model
to investigate the complex in situ combustion mechanisms
which urgently need rational explanation on a quantitative
basis. The physical model is composed of a stainless steel
combustion tube, 2.18 inches inner diameter and 13 inches
long, which is packed with crushed and sieved Berea
sands and wrapped in thermostatted heating elements. In
connection with this model, an experimental system which
is capable of controlling the temperature of the model and
injection fluids and maintaining constant gas and meter rates
has been designed. From this experimental work, some as-
pects of an isothermal three—phase flow in a porous sand
pack, the non—isothermal oil and water saturation distribu-
tion, and the amount of available fuel for combustion-front
consumption are being investigated.

T6

Following are some of the preliminary ﬁndings of his
research:

(1.) The crude oil saturation distribution in the water bank,
team plateau, and evaporation and distillation region as a
function of distance from the combustion front can be ap-
proximated by a ﬁrst order equation.

(2.) For a crude oil, the gas rate has more effect on the oil
saturation distribution in the water bank and stream plateau
than any other single factor studied in this investigation.

(3.) Based on the result of residual oil saturation and remain-
ing oil mass in the evaporation and vaporization region and
under these experimental conditions performed on Bradford
crude oil with one hour temperature—residence time, the
amount of fuel available for combustion is about 0.82 grams
per 100 grams of clean sands.

‘‘I wanted to get in
on the ground floor
of a growth industry.
That’s why I joined IBMZ’

“Big as it is, the information process-

grow,” says Andy Moran. He earned
his B.S.E.E. in 1966. Today he’s a

“Marketing Representative with lBM. ~

His views are shared by many. Re-
cently, Fortune estimated that the
value of general purpose computers

probably no source is totally precise.
But most agree that information proc-
essing is one of America's fastest
growing major industries.

With growth like that going for you,
promotions can come fast. Last year,
for example, we appointed over 4,000

Remarks To Engineering Students

A Look At Engineering In Relation To People

Ea’. Note.‘
This article is taken from a talk given by Mr. MacDonald
to the April, 1968, Electrical Engineering graduates.

I stand before you as an obsolete engineer — a throw-
back to the days of the slide rule engineer, living in the age
of the computer. When I was in school, electrical studies
covered chiefly machinery, circuits, ﬁelds, and controls. If
you look back into the ancient history of the 1920’s, you’ll dis-
cover that electronics consisted primarily of a study of the
characteristics of a relatively few vacuum tubes.

Looking over a list of courses now required for gradua-
tion, I noticed that about 20 percent of the required credits
are in the humanities, social sciences, and general studies.
These 20 percent are still about the same subjects that were
required in my day — English, history, social studies, plus
accounting and economics.

And this led me to reflect on which of the two groups
of courses — almost two sepa-ra«te= types of education — will
be the most important to a college graduate when he starts
to practice his profession. Certainly he’ll need all of his
engineering know how — and will want to keep up with
many of the still more sophisticated specialties that will have
to come in the future to bail us out of some of the technical
difficulties created by our increasingly complex way of living.

In the electric power business where for years we have
been under extreme pressure to enlarge, expand, intercon-
nect, and coordinate for higher quality service and for better
reliability, it seems to me that we have never had all the
complete engineering we’ve needed at any given time. I
can’t recall when we ever felt we “had it made” for a stretch
longer than about a month!

Add new generation — and transmission problems come
up. Plan new transmission and more complex switching
and relaying are required. The new relaying calls for tele-
metering —- and then you need faster, surer communications.

Recently we installed at our Allegheny Power System
dispatch center at Charleroi a new digital computer complete
with a complex program to achieve automatic and economic
loading of our generating units. We are told this installation
is one of the ﬁrst of its kind in operation in the country, and
certainly it keeps track of an amazing amount of information
regarding our stations, interconnections, and load How on
our system.

It’s in the shakedown process now, but already our power
dispatchers feel that the print—out is a little slow when the
computer is asked to solve special problems along with its
basic assignment. They don’t want to wait several minutes
for the answers. Power dispatching is a business involving
split—second margins for error — and “right now” answers
are needed.

Beyond this we’ve been plagued with a noisy communi-
cation channel so that it is difficult to distinguish meaning-
ful communications from spurious signals in telemetering.

These bugs will be ironed out and the system will be made
to work — not by engineers of my generation" but by men
who have studied with you the strange (to me) new engi-
neering specialties.

I’ve used this example only to illustrate that we cannot
overstress the importance and value of both basic and spe-
cialized engineering studies to your future.

But coming back to the 20 percent required studies in the
other ﬁelds — the social sciences and humanities . . . where
do these ﬁt in? Naturally, as you develop your professional
careers after you graduate, you will be attracted to, or drawn
into special ﬁelds of endeavor . . . research . . . teaching . . .
development and application engineering with business or
government.

And within these ﬁelds, inevitably you are going to ﬁnd
new functions thrust upon you — tedious, or challenging,
depending on how you view them. These duties will in-
clude administrative responsibilities . . . supervising people
instead of just operations . . . even selling — if you can
bring yourself to think of that!

Incidentally, at one point I had to put in a stint managing
a marketing department, if I wanted a job as vice president.
They assured me it required an electrical engineer — which
is something they had not told me when I went to work
for the company. However, I quickly found out that to sell
increased use and new applications of electrical service —
particularly to industrial customers — requires a fair degree
of engineering knowledge.

But it's when opportunities like these occur that the
value of studies in the humanities and the social sciences, in-
cluding economics, begins to show up. More and more you
ﬁnd yourself calling on the knowledge you gained in these
ﬁelds to help you out.

For instance, if any of you have elected to go into teach-
ing, I am sure you will ﬁnd that the subject “communica-
tions” applies to many more techniques than just an elec-
tronic device or system. In fact, I guess that now you have
become seniors you probably have formed the conclusion
that certain communications gaps exist between faculty and
student body. This is probably a mutually shared opinion
— although from diﬁerent viewpoints.

Skills in communicating are essential in practically every

profession, and today it seems that we must look for guidance

to some of the other disciplines, such as the behavioral
sciences.

But whether you go into teaching, research, or applica-
tion engineering, sooner or later you are certain to ﬁnd your-
self “working within a budget” — which brings you face to
face with economics. This is a subject that some folks feel is
very dry — and certainly the application of economics can
be irksome in some cases.

Speciﬁcally, economics usually means “how much engi-
neering can you perform for a given amount of money?”
This may mean the amount of money available within the
organization, or it may be the price of a competitor’s prod-
uct or service. Or as in the electric utility business, distance
can become an economic factor. How far can you transmit
electricity economically, as against how much will it cost to
ship coal to a generating station?

Economics obviously involves how much customers are
willing to pay. It includes how much engineers — and other
employees — feel they should receive for their skills and
labor. It affects the willingness of people to invest their
savings in an enterprise, or to pay taxes for a government
service.

In the power business, economics goes hand in hand with
engineering. We have expert engineers who actually enjoy
haggling with a supplier over how much quality perform—
ance can be designed and built into a piece of equipment for
a given price. And the stakes are high. A 500 megawatt
turbine-generator may cost 10 million dollars. Add the
boiler, condenser and other auxiliaries plus a building to
house them and the price tag will be 60 to 65 million dollars.
A 600 MVA transformer to step up the generator output to
500 kilovolts for transmission may cost another $600,000.

(continued from page 22)

But even when engineers design for the best possible cost-
beneﬁt ratio, economics may not always be the controlling
or deciding factor. We have a current case in -the Allegheny
Power System where our Maryland sister company, Potomac
Edison, urgently needs to build a 500,000—volt transmission
line to deliver energy from generating stations here in
Pennsylvania and West Virginia to themselves and other
utilities in the Washington, D.C., and northern Virginia
area. The purpose is to reinforce the power supply and
reliability of service to our customers and others in the east
with fairly low cost energy available from the coal ﬁelds
here in this part of the country.

Various possible transmission routes were explored and
the most feasible and economical route ﬁnally selected.
Proper clearances and approvals were obtained from many
authorities and governmental agencies —— since the proposed
route would pass through or near some natural preserves,
parks, and national monuments.

Engineering was going along well when someone dis-
covered that the line would cross the site of the old Chesa-
peake and Ohio Canal which you’ll remember is a favorite
hiking spot for a number of prominent Washington political
and governmental officials. Some of these began to complain
that the presence of a power line would be offensive to
nature—loving citizens strolling along the old canal route.

Then another cry arose that the transmission line would
desecrate a national monument —— in this case the Antietam
Battleﬁeld near Frederick, Maryland. This attractive area
of rolling hills and woodlands is distinguished by the fact
that more than 100 years ago one of the bloodiest battles of
the Civil War was fought at Antietam. Unquestionably, it
deserves to be perpetuated as a memorial to your great-
grandfathers who fought there to save the Union — or to
preserve autonomy — depending on which color they wore.

Our engineers were fully aware of the reverence with
which Civil War buffs -tour Antietam Battleﬁeld, and they
designed the line so that it would skirt the principal areas
and generally be screened by trees from normal public view.

But the hue and cry reached almost national proportions
with an editorial in Life magazine and in the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette —— although neither editor had taken the trouble
to visit the site or inspect the engineering plans.

The Department of Interior of the Federal Government
got into the act. There were suggestions for alternate routes
— much longer and, therefore, much more expensive. One
suggested alternative route would have cost an additional
$20 million. Also, there were suggestions for burying por—
tions of the line underground. Incidentally, as you are
probably aware, it is not yet technically feasible to bury lines
at this high voltage underground for more than a very short
distance without suffering intolerable energy losses. Even
at lower transmission voltages, say 138 kv, the cost ratio of

underground to overhead construction is in the vicinity of
16 to 1.

After long months of discussion and special engineering
studies, the Department of Interior has now agreed to modi-
ﬁcations in the route of the line, and to some design changes
that hopefully will avoid offending the public’s sensitivity to

32

 

signs of modern progress. But the cost of building the line
is increased by about $5 million.

I have taken the time to review this second battle of
Antietam because it shows how intricately engineering can
become involved — not only with economics — but with
two additional factors, as well.

One of these is the impact of government on engineering
progress today. Government at all levels —— local, state, and
federal —— is exercising increasing influence on every branch
of engineering. Perhaps the 20 percent required credit
courses should be expanded to inclue political science.

I hate to go beyond this and suggest that the list should
be further extended to include ﬁne art: courses. But the

fact is that along with greater affluence, and peoples’ rising
aspirations, there is a growing public awareness of aesthetic
considerations. Attractiveness is in the eyes of the beholder,
of course, and beauty itself is pretty much a subjective thing
— with values changing from group to group and from gen-
eration to generation. I am not sure how engineers will learn
to contend with aesthetics, but I am certain you will have to
interest yourselves in the subject and take it into consideration.

The electric industry, almost to a man, has long regarded
the traditional steel high tension tower as a thing of elemental
grace, and even beauty — a symbol of controlled strength

 
 

(note: the following picfure models aesthetic possibilities in fowers designed
by Mr. Dreyfuss, the country's foremost lndusfrlal engineer.)

and power striding purposefully towards the horizon. Poems
even have been written about it.

But mounting public pressures have led our industry to
explore the aesthetic possibilities in tower design. Henry
Dreyfuss, the country’s foremost industrial designer, was re-
tained. ]ust a few weeks ago, after months of engineering
and architectural studies, Mr. Dreyfuss revealed the results
of his work.

Many of Mr. Dreyfuss’ designs were pleasing and cer-
tainly some of them would even be judged outstanding ex-
amples of modern sculpture —- at least by some juries. But
even the simplest of the designs would cost at least twice as
much to fabricate as our standard laced steel tower. And as
Mr. Dreyfuss himself implies, a tower design that won ap-
proval of a group of critics might well offend the public
when strung out in repetitive monotony across the landscape.

Aesthetics may be a fringe luxury for which people are
willing to pay in periods of relative prosperity. It is symp-
tomatic of an increasing public concern for our total environ-
ment — for conservation of our natural wonders and resources
— for abatement of air and water pollution, particularly
around and in our rapidly growing urban centers. Almost
invariably engineers are being called upon to watch their
cost—beneﬁt ratio — with the admonition to include in the
balance a full measure of these collateral beneﬁts which, until
very recently, were of relatively minor concern.

Perhaps it is high time that we are forced to take “people”
concerns into our engineering. For too long we have allowed
the social scientists and sociologists and politicians to do all
the worrying about people, hoping that they would solve the
social problems that plague us — particularly in our cities.
This has allowed us as engineers to concentrate on moderni-
zation and renewal.

This has been challenging, and it has been fun. We’ve
seen whole sections of a city renewed —— blighted areas bull-
dozed away, to be replaced by fantastic multi-purpose build-
ings embodying the last word in engineering design. In the
electric utility business, we have reaped the beneﬁts of many
new engineering concepts — for instance, all—electric schools
and churches, motels, theaters, office buildings, apartment
houses, and individual homes.

Now we are unpleasantly surprised to ﬁnd that most of
the people whom we “urban renewaled” out of their slums
have not moved into our electrically heated apartments and
houses. It seems they have just established new slums in
older residential districts, while we’ve been busy putting the
ﬁnishing touches on our attractive civic centers.

Of course, housing to replace our ghettos is only one of
the inner city problems that call for the urgent application
of engineering principles and know—how we have developed.
For years we have concentrated on automation to eliminate
jobs and to make the remaining work less arduous.

Now business, particularly, is being called upon to engi-
neer jobs so that they are understandable; meaningful, and
satisfying to people who have never been capable of working
before. Obviously, to be successful, this sort of thing calls
for not only engineering ingenuity, but also for intensive
application of oL1r knowledge in the humanities and social
sciences.

Much the same attention and action needs to be applied
to the problem of elementary and secondary education of
the kids in our urban centers. Apparently we have been
neglecting these problems under our very noses, while we
have been striving to increase and enhance the ﬁelds of
specialization at the university and graduate level.

As you know, vigorous eﬁforts are now being exerted by
business and industry, by government, and by our univer-
sities and colleges on these problems of jobs and education
for inner city citizens. This summer — and the balance of
the year — may give us a reading on how fast and how
well our efforts are paying off.

I said in the beginning that I couldn’t help but reflect
on which of the two groups of courses offered to the elec-
trical engineering undergraduate would be most important
to him and his future. I think I have reached the conclu-
sion — by looking back at my own experience and by judging
from the experiences of men in other lines of endeavor —
that the importance of each branch of study is equal, and
the value of each to you will be indistinguishable in almost
whatever profession you pursue.

I’m sure that the longest day you work you will always
wish you had a little more background and knowledge in
electrical engineering. And I’m equally sure that each day
you live you will be happier when you can combine with
your engineering the broader concerns of the humanities —
an appreciation for, and an understanding of the concerns
that motivate people.

In the end, they are the ones who will test your engineer-
ing. People will likely reject your design if it does not fulﬁll
their personal needs and aspirations. But if you have de-
signed people into your plans, the chances are good that they
will approve you as worthy. And I hope sincerely that every
one of you achieves at least that distinction.

3. Here’s a riddle for you:

A rose—red city half as old as Time,

One billion years ago the city’s age

Was just two—fifths of what Time’s age will be
A billion years from now. Can you compute
How old the crimson city is today?

4. A man drove at a steady speed along a highway. He
noticed signs for Flatz beer. As he passed, they seemed to
be regularly spaced along the road so the man wondered how
far apart they were.

He glanced at his watch and then counted the signs
he passed in 1 minute. Checking his speedometer, he ex-
claimed, “What an odd coincidence. When you multiply
that number by 10, it exactly equals the speed of the car in
mph.”

Assuming that the car’s speed is constant, that the signs
are equally spaced, and that the man’s minute began and
ended with the car midway between 2 signs, how far is it
from one sign to the next?

5. Abner is watching television, so is his wife. .
Either Dale or Ellsworth, or both of them are watching
television.
Either Beryl or Cleo, but not both, is Watching
television.
Dale and Cleo are either both Watching television or
both not watching television.
If Ellsworth is watching television, then Abner and
Dale are also watching.
Who is watching television and who is not?

Who is watching tCICVlSlOn and who is not.

6. The ﬂatcar is being moved to the right by means of three
circular logs. The logs are at all times exactly 10 feet apart
from center to center. As soon as the position shown is
reached, the man in the back tosses the- log to the man in
front who places it in the position shown by the dotted line.

Exactly 55 feet in front of the point at which the dotted
circle touches the track is a worm. Assuming the worm
does not move, how many logs will roll over it?

We may
build a bigger engine

at our #2 plant.
Help wanted:

Could you

engineer the changeover

economically?

Situation: Complete design scheme for tools,
jigs, and fixtures needed. Also
need plans detailing how much time

will be required, under optimum

conditions, for line changeover.

Question: Is there some way we can
implement this change by utilizing
most of the existing machinery

at the plant?

Problem: As a modest volume plant, it is
imperative that we don ’t lose
valuable time and resulting sales.
Suggest you visit the Mexico City
Plant where a similar changeover
occurred. Would appreciate solu-
tion by Friday, next week. Thanhs.

That's right. You, too, can be a pilot.

Join the United States Air Force and qualify for
pilot training. Become a leaderwith executive
responsibility.

Well, what else’? A pilot is the officer in charge
of a million dollars worth of high flying, sophisti-
cated supersonic equipment, isn't he’?

Yes, and you'll wear a snappy blue officer's uni-
form, enjoy officer's pay and privileges. You'll
probably travel to exotic foreign lands, and have
a secure future in the biggest scientific and
research organization. World's biggest.

You'll be where all the exciting Space Age break-
throughs are. Where it's happening. Now. Today.
Right now. This minute. The Air Force is the “now"
place to be.

If you yearn to fly and don't try the Aerospace
Team, you'll miss your big chance.

Let that be a lesson!

One evening a large gorilla walked into an Oakland tavern
and sat down at the bar. When the astonished bar—keeper
asked the gorilla what he wanted, the gorilla muttered, “A
beer” and held out a hundred dollar bill in his hairy ﬁst.
The bartender ﬁguring that the gorilla wouldn’t know the
value of money, took the bill, rang up the register and gave
him ﬁfty cents in change. While the gorilla was sipping
his beer, the bartender tried to make conversation “I don’t
get many gorillas in here.”

“No wonder,” said the gorilla, “at $99.50 a beer.”

An old gentleman riding the top of a London bus noticed
every few minutes the conductor would come from the back
and dangle a piece of string down before the driver beneath
whereupon the driver would begin to cuss and swear
terribly. Finally the old gentleman could stand it no longer
and so he asked the conductor why the driver swore.
“Oh,” the conductor said, “His father is being hung to-
morrow and I’m just kidding him a little.”

The city slicker bought a farm with the-intention of raising
pigs. His farm was ﬁve miles from the farm with the
county champion pigs, ten miles from the farm with the
state champion pigs and twenty—ﬁve miles from the farm
where the national champion pigs were raised. After settling
down, he put his only sow in a wheelbarrow, walked her
ﬁve miles to the county champion pigs, had her bred and
walked back. The next morning he awoke, but much to
his disappointment he found no little piglets.” So he put her
back in the wheelbarrow, took her to the state champion
pigs, had her bred and walked back. The next morning,
he awoke, but again found no piglets. He put the sow in
the wheelbarrow once again and walked twenty—ﬁve miles
to the state champion pigs, had her bred, and walked back.
The next morning he awoke and asked his wife, “Honey,
do you see any little piglets out there?”

“No,” she replied, looking out the window, “but that old
sow is back in the wheelbarrow again.”

An old Navajo wood chopper broke his ﬁfty—year old axe,
so he decided to go to town to buy another one. It was the
first time he’d been in town in thirty years. Visiting a ware-

saw him.

“Yes what can I do for you?” said the salesman.

“I needum good axe” replied the Indian.

“Well have you tried our new super—duper power axe?”
“How many trees it cut?” asked the Navajo.

“As many as you need it to,” said the salesman.

“I buy, butif it not cut seven trees a day, I come back and
cut your throat.”

The old Navajo went back into the woods and sure enough
for the first three days the power saw cut at least seven trees,
but the fourth day it cut only ﬁve. The angry Navajo took
it back.

“This axe no good. It not cut seven trees a day but I bet it
cut your throat.”

“Now wait a minute” protested the salesman, “There is a
two year guarantee on the motor. Let’s start it up and see

Shell is heading

for oil and natural
gas. Recently we‘
designed and installed permanent
drilling/production platforms as
tall as a 34-story building, with

still bigger structures in the works.
And we are operating in con-

Digestible detergents

The main trouble
with detergents
is they don't go
away. They pol-
lutestreams,make
fresh water foamy. The solution:
detergent compounds that orga-
nisms can consume. These “bio-
degradables” clean clothes just
as effectively, but keep streams
free of detergent foam. Elsewhere
in the chemical part of our busi-
ness, Shell research has resulted
in a wealth of plastics for home
and industry, and fertilizers to
alleviate food shortages.

on and off the beaten track for an
oil company. If you have a more-

from a tennis pro.

A tennis champion’s powerful backhand looks as smooth and
unhurried as a ballerina’s graceful bow. How’s he do it? By being in
the right position in plenty of time.

“Remember this about the backhand,” the pros advise. “Get both
feet around pointing toward the sideline. And always make sure the right
foot’s forward, so your body doesn’t cramp your swing.”

Getting into proper position early is good advice for college seniors, too.
Here’s the ﬁrst step:

When companies interview on your campus, make sure they interview you. When the
Timken Company representative stops by, don’t let him go without seeing you.

He’ll ﬁll you in on our work (maybe your work) with the aerospace,'automotive,

 the boss!  

AND HE HAD BETTER BE READY FOR YOU. Bosses
who think like caricatures lack the capacity to run important
operations that call for the brightest operating talent that a
stepped-up educational system turns out. The new talent that
may or may not choose to make itself available takes a care-
ful look at the carrots being offered.

Once we decide we like that bright new talent—and we
decided that quite a while ago——it becomes necessary to put
up with their demands. Aside from the expected attrac-
tive package of salary, benefits, and advancement plan, the
ones we have chosen to chase often demand in addition an
opportunity to try their newer and subtler ways of thought
against old problems. As it happens, we need this type badly,
because we have plenty of stubborn old problems, plenty of
ﬁnancial incentive to crack them, and a very stable platform
for launching new ventures that take a little while to pay off.
(The latter must not be underrated as an attraction.)

Sweeping generalizations are no more reliable for the

Class of 1968 than for the boys of ’38. Not all ’68’s ﬁnest
engineering minds disclaim knowledge of how to handle a
screwdriver nor shun empiricism. We offer excellent carrots,
along with money, to engineers with a knack for making
things work even when they can’t explain why.

Pete Drobach has a knack
for getting to the root of a problem.

High school students John Magish and John Ripley
would be the ﬁrst to agree.

They’re both student members of a “big brother”
program that Pete sponsors. Each week, they spend
several hours of their own time helping less advanced
classmates with their studies.

Pete is more than a sponsor. He’s also a consultant-
particularly when they’re stumped by the logic of’ a
tough “new math” problem.

But when Pete graduated from Rutgers in 1964, it
wasn’t these youngsters with their homework problems
that brought him to General Electric. It was the chance
to help people in industry solve tough technical prob-
lems. A career in technical marketing at General Elec-
tric gave him the opportunity.

Today, Pete’s an application engineer in steel mill

drives and automation systems. His ideas on how to
apply products from many of GE’s 160 separate busi-
nesses enable his customers to improve the efficiency
and productivity of their plants.

Like Pete Drobach, you’ll ﬁnd opportunities at Gen-
eral Electric in R&D, design, production or marketing
that match your’ qualiﬁcations and interests. Talk to
our man when he visits your campus. Or write for

DIN THE
IDEA GORE

 

Right now, hundreds of engineers, chem-
ists, and physicists are exploring their own
ideas at NCR. We encourage them because
we consider idea-people as the backbone of
technological advancement in our field of
total business system development.

And it works. Business Management maga-
zine, in a list of “emerging ideas,” credits
NCR with two out of seven: pioneering in
laser technology for recording data, and
development of our new PCMI microform
system.

Whether you're a seasoned pro, or an
ambitious self-starter, and whatever your
degree, if the excitement and satisfaction
of start-to-finish idea development appeal
to you, you'll go far with NCR. And so will
your ideas.

Here's a good idea to start with: write to

We1comes.,, Wishes, New Ideas

by Carl Pavetto

As classes begin for the fall 1968-69 term, the S/(y.rcraper
staff extends a warm welcome to the new engineering stu-
dents and faculty members and a sincere wish that they will
have good luck in the years to follow. SI{y5cmpcr greets the
returning students and faculty, also, with a hope that old
friendships will be renewed and’ many new ones will be
formed.

Those students returning to Pitt have noticed the absence
of recent graduates. Our hope, of course, is that these alumni
are happily settled in their new endeavors, be it jobs, graduate
school, etc.

This year’s freshmen will encounter somewhat stiffer
academic regulations. One of the changes involves repeated
courses. No longer will the latter grade replace the former

grade; instead, the two grades will be averaged-. For eX—
ample, a C obtained’ upon repetition of EA 1 will not replace
a previous failure but the two will produce a D grade. '

Another change involves quality point averages. The old
formula for calculating QPA has been replaced by a new
criterion. Beginning at 1.50, the minimum acceptable QPA
will increase in increments of .05 as the number of credits
increases. At ninety—six credits, the minimum permissible

QPA is 2.00.

It is important to note that the Administration has de-
cided to refrain from dismissing students for academic rea-
sons until the end of the winter term. Students may wel-
come this promise since it gives them another chance to do
better.

One new idea initiated’ by Engineering Student Cabinet,
the Big Brother Program, was a disappointment to those
involved. It seems some of the Big Brothers failed to write
their letters to the new students. Response to the upper-
classmen who did write was very poor. Evidently, new
students have been so well informed about Pitt. that they
need no help from upperclassmen. We’ll soon see.

A Letter to the Engineering
Students from the
President of ESC

Fellow Engineers,

The Engineering Student Cabinet is constantly becoming
a stronger, more active organization. All present indications
are that this scholastic year promises to be one of the most
fruitful for Cabinet.

For the interest of freshmen, Cabinet is the governing
body of undergraduate engineering students. It is composed
of an elected representative from each class of each depart-
ment. The freshman class will be re-presented by four stu-
dents, elected in seminar on October 17, 1968.

Cabinet would like to see as many interested persons as
possible taking an active part in our functions. There is
always room for new ideas or improvement on old ones.
For this reason meetings (Tuesdays, 12:00 noon, Room 506
 are open to all students. One need not be an elected.
representative to play an important Cabinet role, as many
personalities have shown in the past.

Brieﬂy, the following are some of the functions Cabinet
will initiate this year. One is a changed Engineers’ Week,
focusing on more faculty participation. and more construc-
tive laboratory displays. Also, a service project will be
initiated.

For the purp.ose. of building a. closer tie between .-the Ad-
ministration, faculty and students, meetings between depart-
ment heads and representatives. will take place on a regularly
scheduled basis. Also, the test file will be built up and made
available to all students.

A study group will be set up to work closely with the
Dean’s office regarding a changed curriculum. Currently,
Cabinet ischoosing ﬁxtures to go in the lounging, activities
and cafeteria areat of Benedum Hall.

All of these and more will come under Cabinet’s domain
this year along with previously set functions such as intra-
department athletics, the Outstanding Senio.r awards, the
ESCITT Award and ESCITT Seminar and publishing of
the Engineeriimg Bulletin.

Cabinet can function with strength only if its programs
are actively supported by you, the engineering students.

Sincerely,

Edward Levine, President ESC

In the time

it takes to complete
some training programs,
you could be a success

at Celanese.

We feature a sort of
do—it-yourself training,
rather than long, dreary
formal programs. It's your
ball, but we'll go all out

to help you carry it just

as far and as fast as

you can go. When you
need a hand, it will be
there—from experienced
pros. Your on—the-job,

CELANESE

The 5 billion dollar corporation

you probably never heard of.

Funny how big you can get and stﬂl
remain virtually anonymous.
Somehow we’Ve managed to do it.
VVe’re a group of over 60 companies,
making everything from microwave integrated
circuits to color television. And we rank num-
ber 9 in the top 500 corporations in the nation.
Pretty hot stuff for a nobody.
But though you may not recognize our
name, maybe the name Sylvania rings a bell.
It’s one of our companies.

 

You may even live in one of our telephone
company areas. We operate in 33 states.

So here we are, 5 billion dollars strong,
growing all over the place, and looking for
engineers and scientists to grow with us.

Why don’t you think us over with your
Placement Director? '

Incidentally, we are known in the com-
munications field as General Telephone &
Electronics.

Pssst. Pass it on.

The Rebirth of the

Electric Car

A converted Voltswagon traverses the country

to prove the feasibility of the electric car.

The electric automobile has been a means of transporta-
tion almost as long as the internal combustion engine ma-
chines, but due to a stagnant level of development or im-
provement for forty years they are not a conventional part
of society today. Spurred by a. report in 1966 from the De-
partment of Commerce that nearly 61% of total air pol-
lutants came from motor vehicles, numerous industrial ﬁrms
have sponsored research into this area along with the federal
government. Together they will spend approximately nine
million dollars this year for research and development on the
electric car. Although the list of major industrial ﬁrms with
test models is very impressive the universities and colleges
have foL1nd an equal ranking with Ford’s COMUTA, Gen-
eral Motor’s Electrovair II, General Electric’s DELTA or
Westinghouse’s Markette. '

The first transcontinental electric car race, held between a
team of students from Massachusettes Institute of Technology
and the California Institute of Technology, proved the feasi-
bility of an electric car competing with conventional
automobiles.

Eight days after the race began, by an electronic count-
down from the respected campuses, a converted red and
cream Voltswagon Microbus crossed the ﬁnish line at
8:46 A.M. on Wednesday, September 5, 1968, in the center
of the massive MIT campus in Cambridge, Massachusettes,
to become the ﬁrst electrically powered car to cross the con-
tinent under its own power. Earlier a converted Corvair,
powered by nickie-cadmium batteries, was towed across the
ﬁnish line on the Caltech campus in Pasadena, Colifornia.
The judging was not based solely upon total elapsed time,
but consideration was taken on such items as towing, re-
placement of parts, recharging at unscheduled stops and
other factors. The ﬁnal result of the race was not known
until 5 P.M. that same afternoon, because of the complicated
system of judging, when it was announced that the Caltech
team had won.

The Caltech car is the ﬁnal product of four years of
design and research by Walley Rippel of Pasadena, Califor-
nia. Rippel, who is 23 years old and recently graduated from
Caltech in June, is also the owner and builder. The electric

car was not just a technical challenge to Rippel but a means
to alleviate the nation’s air pollution problem. The follow-
ing day Mr. Austin Heller, New York City’s Commissioner
of Air Pollution Control, presented Rippel and his team con-
sisting of drivers Ron Griemban and George Swartz and the
pit crew that followed in the support car that included Andy
Joseph, Richard Rubinstein and Pat Silverthorne the Edison
Electric Institute’s Electric Vehicle Council — Reddy Kilowatt
award.
