The most exhaustive wind tunnel

planes are equipped with reaction

the technique of shifting from aero-
dynamic control to reaction control
and vice-versa.

As is well known, as recently as
six months ago, the Dyna-Soar pro-
gram seemed to have been suffering
from a well advanced case of rigor
mortis. However, the latest word is
that at least eight orbital ﬂights will
be conducted within the next few
years. Only time will tell if the
X—Q0 program achieves full develop-
ment.

Other forms of soaring spacecraft
are presently under consideration.

One such spacecraft is the lVI2 lift-
ing body. The M2 was designed
without wings to reduce the surface
area exposed to air friction during
re—entry. The shape of the MQ re-
sembles a cone sliced in half with
a rounded nose. The rounded bot-
tom provides just enough lift for
minor maneuvering in the downward
spiral. Small tail surfaces on either
side give it stability and directional
control. Several tests have been
conducted with the craft by drop-
ping it from 13,000 ft. at about 135
lV[PH. The Dyna-Soar would be
more maneuverable and easier to
land, but an M2 of the same size
would carry more passengers and

provide more internal volume per
square foot of surface.

It is highly possible that the M2
type of craft will be.substituted for
the X—Q0 before the X-Q0 completes
its test program. Since Congress
seems to be unable to foresee imme-
diate military applications of the
X—20, and is, therefore, reluctant to
make appropriations, it is question-
able whether we will witness the
completion of the entire X—Q0 test
program. The X-20 Will be the ﬁrst

Pardon me if I sound as if the
executive position I've landed
deals with the whole future of
the world.

 

It does.

Certainly, there's no organization today conduct-
ing more vital business than the business of the
United States Air Force. And very few organiza-
tions that give a college graduate greater oppor-
tunities for responsibility and growth.

As an Air Force officer, you'll be a leader on the
Aerospace Team—with good pay, a 30-day paid
vacation each year, educational opportunities.

How can you get started? For many, the best way
is through Air Force ROTC. But if you missed out
on AFROTC, or if there's no unit on your campus,
you can still apply for Air Force Officer Training

Hello there! The Skyscraper Engineer is going to China!

The following letter was received recently from the Institute of Scientiﬁc and Technical Information of China,
Peking, China:

“Dear Sir: _

This Library wishes to propose a regular exchange of scientiﬁc and
technical publications with your organization.

“We enclose herewith a list of publications available for exchange. Please
elect any one item which is of interest to you so that we may send you same
successively.

“In return, We would like to receive your publication as speciﬁed below:

The Skyscraper Engineer
“Please let us know whether you agree to our above mentioned ex-

change proposal.
Yours faithfully,

Yue Qi, Assistant-in-charge
The Library, ISTIC”

Accompanying the letter was a list of ﬁfty—four Chinese publications from which one may be selected and
received for regular exchange of The Skyscraper. -

Will we do it? Of course, and we will answer the letter with a copy of this issue.

This request, however, does arouse one’s curiosity. Why The Skyscraper? How did they they learn about our
student publication in China? Which articles in past issues interested them and prompted their request?

Prior to World War II quite a few Chinese graduated with engineering degrees from Pitt and then returned.
It would be interesting to know where they are and what they are doing now. It is possible that one of our alumni
initiated this request and it is for this reason too that we say —— “Hello there.”

Perhaps the Chinese, like many. Americans, have found v“The Skyscraper" to contain many aritcles which
are written on the fringe of the future and is thus informative of things to come. Even the excellent industrial ad-
vertisements predict new developments in engineering.

It is doubtful that campus news would be of any interest to the Chinese unless they are Pitt Alumni
as suggested above. Perhaps some of the jokes at the end of the magazine are funnier when translated into Chinese.

At any rate, The Skyscraper staff can be assured from this request that their articles are read far and Wide, and
they are to be congratulated again for the excellence of their work. ’

Result: All 3-speed manual
transmissions in

Ford-built cars with V-8's
now are fully synchronized
in each forward gear

To get more“go" in low, Ford engineers
were asked to upgrade the conventional
3-speed transmission to give drivers
more control in all three forward gears—
to make "low” a driving gear—and they
tackled the problem imaginatively.

Their achievement, another Ford First,
is the only U.S. 3-speed manual trans-
mission with all three forward gears
fully synchronized! No need‘ now to come
to a complete stop when you shift into
|ow—and no clashing gears! It lets you
keep more torque on tap for negotiating
sharp turns and steep grades. It makes
driving more ﬂexible. more pleasurable.

Another assignment completed and
another example of how engineering

What makes a Company“Modern”P

Not size. Not capital resources. Certainly not
age. At Celanese, we believe it is the degree to
which a company is equipped to meet the present
and future needs of its customers.

Eﬂicient plant. Contemporary product. Aggres-
sive management. Industrious work force. The
ability to think ahead of the situation and be ready
for the problem when it occurs.

Celanese happens to be a young company. Much
more important, it’s a modern company.

Perhaps you’re among the men who will help

keep us modern. If you are trained in chemical ,

engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical
engineering, chemistry, or physics, we hope you
will stop in to see our representative when he
visits your campus. Or write directly to us, brieﬂy

Westinghouse is building a remarkable draft, a free—roaming explorer
of the underseas. Unlike the famous bathysphere, which dangled at the end
of cables, Deepstar has no strings attached. She will rise, dive, turn and back
at will, self-propelled and independent. Her 3-man crew will be able to
set instruments, sample the bottom at depths of two miles, salvage, photograph,
and most of all, explore the Vast oceanic world that has hidden itself so long from man.
Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the undersea pioneer who created
the basic concept, is collaborating with Westinghouse on the vehicle. Deepstar will be equipped
with the controls, instruments, mechanical “hands” and everything else
needed for the deep swim. You can be sure . . . if it’: Westinghouse

LOST YOUR BEARING?
There is not much chance of anyone ever losing this bearing — it weighs a
mere one hundred sixty-seven tons. This huge chunk of steel, a seventeen
feet in diameter, is being machined at the East Pittsburgh Plant of
Westinghouse Electric Corporation. It will be installed as part of a radio
telescope at The National Radio Astronomy Observation at Green Bank,
West Virginia. The large radio telescope at the Observation moves around
and points toward sound or radio signals, necessitating a large, loW—frict,ion
bearing to support the weight of the operating telescope.

SATELLITE MOTION SIMULATOR

A 1500-pound satellitemotion simulator, built to imitate
the movements of a satellite orbiting the earth, floats on
air at the Air Arm Division of the Westinghouse Electric
Corporation’s Defense Center, Baltimore. The simulator
is attached to a t\ve.lve—inch stainless steel ball bearing
which floats on a cushion of air. The equipment is_ so
delicately balanced that air movements in a normal room
would disturb it. To .simulate the earth about which the
satellite equipment is “orbiting,” engineers suspended
a large aluminum dish from the ceiling‘ of the simulator
1'o0m. Heating the dish to a temperature of 150 degrees
Fahrenheit causes the satellite control devises to respond
as though they are “seeing” the earth from a distance
of 500 to 1,000 miles.

A rendezvous evaluation pod, called the “piggy—back” satellite, is being built
by the Air Arm Division of Westinghouse Electric Corporation at Baltimore,

satellite will be used by US. Astronauts to rehearse rendezvous techniques
before they actual perform the delicate operation with an Agena D rocket.
The pod will contain a radar transponder, which can both receive and transmit
radar signals, and necessary batteries for power. In addition, the unit will be
equipped with flashing lights for visibility and a radar antenna.

LUNAR COMMUNICATIONS PACKAGE
To make the eventual arrival of our astronauts on the
moon safer and to make their work useful, the Systems
Management D_ep-artment of the Westinghouse Defense
Center, Baltimore, l\/Iaryland, has designed a communi-
cations package. The communieations payload, a lunar
logistics system (LLS), is an electronics package that
would furnish communications for the men that will be
placed on the moon by the Apollo mission. It will arrive
before the astronauts and will be in stand—by operation,
for as long as a year, for use when the Apollo spaeeman
land. The communications system’s main function will be
to relay-Voice and television transmissions from lunar
vehicles back to earth, substantially reducing the amount
of power needed by individual vehicles.

we’re
not

alone

Nearly two million automobiles will work their way
through college this year.

A survey of the college parking problem by The
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company indicates that 44
per cent of the nation’s 4.5 million undergraduates report-
ed to classes on wheels this September.

Questionnaires sent by Goodyear to colleges, both
large and small, in all sections of the nation, revealed
th-at the increase since pre-World War II days in the
number of student autos parked on campus ranges from
300 to 1,000 per cent.

Understandably, the daytime parking problem —
not to be confused with its midnight counterpart — poses
a problem for campus police chiefs as well as deans.

Parking facilities are virtually non-existent at many
colleges in metropolitan areas, the study found. For
example, the 10,000 daytime students and 14,000 night
scholars at the College of the City of New York either
ride the subway or race parking meters. A handful of
daring faculty members commute through Manhattan
streets on motor bikes.

In contrast, the University of Minnesota will park
automobiles 1,900,000 times in the course of the school
year. Minnesota has a self-supporting parking set-up
where everyone on campus pays to park.

Most colleges have an annual fee, ranging up to $10.
Rutgers, which claims the largest facility in New Brun-
swick, N. J. (3,000) operates 26 buses to shuttle students
from parking areas to four school areas.

Higher education is not necessarily conducive to the
fight against traffic voilators. Last year Rutgers passed
out 10,000 tags to students, faculty members and others.

Some of the Ivy League schools, notably Yale and
Princeton, do not allow on-campus parking. Columbia
does, but has no parking facilities. Both faculty and
students park in Manhattan streets on a “catch as catch
can” basis.

Dartmouth allows parking, making it easier for
seniors and married students by slicing the registration
fee in half to $5.00. The college is especially tough on
student auto violations. Last year it suspended a star

20

halfback because he was caught owning a car while
attending the school as a financial aid student. The player
lost All—East recognition while the football team won nine
straight.

Dartmouth’s assistant business manager, J a c k
Skewes, makes the point that seat belts are required in
all cars starting this fall. The University of Texas, like
many institutions, bans freshmen from parking on cam-
pus. To all drivers, the university hands out an attractive
four-color map of the campus — along with a copy of
its stringent regulations.

Time was when a visitor to the campus could just
follow the crowd and wind up in the right place. Not so
any more, relates the public relations director at Boston
College. One night last winter a Pulitzer Prize winner
was on one B. C. dais; a seminar on ethics for local busi-
nessmen was held in another hall; a synopsis on Civil
War events in a third; the evening classes were in session
and a basketball game was in progress. A stranger drove
onto the campus expecting to see the B.C.-Navy basket-
ball game. He parked his car and followed the crowd. He
wound up listening to James Reston, N. Y. Times Wash-
ington correspondent, speaking on the state of the nation.

Estimates of the number of used cars on campus
varied widely from 45 to 90 percent of the total number.
Surprisingly, the highest percentage of used cars was
found at Harvard, generally considered the richest uni-
versity in the country.

College police chiefs, deans and others concerned with
parking problems disagreed widely on one question posed
by the Goodyear survey: “Is today’s student a better
driver than his father?”

The Northwestern respondent said, “We doubt it.”
Dartmouth replied, “ About the same at comparable age.”
Columbia answered, “Unlikely.” “Yes, but less cautious,”
said Maine. Wisconsin and Harvard gave an unqualified
“Yes,” while, Tennessee wrote, “P”

Perhaps the most succinct observation came from
Northwestern’s'manager of parking and traffic. At the
bottom of his questionnaire he wrote, “Cars are still un-
necesary to a college education.”

emphasizing realism in a working lab

In a recent kinematics course for electrical engineers, the students were required to

design and construct a computer. The total cost for materials could not exceed five

dollars, and each student had to use his own ingenuity and resourcefulness to build the

computer from materials at hand. Upon completion, each student’s computer was to be

matched againist those of his classmates . .

Introduction

One of the objectives an engineer-
ing education should accomplish is
to acquaint the student With the
realities inherent in applied engi-
neering. Most college laboratories
do not achieve the above objective
because experiments are “de-
bugged” by professors so that the
deviations between theory and re-
ality are minimized; they usually
instruct the student of a set pro-
cedure to be followed in their an-
alyses. Although commendable from
an idealistic point of view, the
convergence of theory and reality
with instruction in specialized sit.u-
ations does not prepare the student
for the realistic World—a world in
which theory and reality do not

 

O O 9

always converge, and instruction in
problem analysis does not always
exist. A lack of this realism in the
educational experience of the gratu-
ating engineer usually does not de-
tract from his employment possi-
bilities. It does, however, hinder
his conception of applied engi-
neering.

Modern day educators can create
student awareness to the realities
inherent in applied engineering by
creating limited projects in the form
of laboratory assignments, similar
to those existent in industry. In ad-
dition to the conventional theoreti-
cal analysis, problems of materials,
economic costs, and construction,
which are commensurate to the edu-
cational level of the student, could

easily be introduced. In this way,
the student will be better prepared
to cope with the realistic world
upon graduation because he will
have obtained a deeper understand-
ing of the true meaning of applied
engineering.
The Problem

The design and construction of
an electro-mechanical computer dis-
cussed here was given to a class
of sophomore electrical engineering
students in an attempt to create
awareness to the realities inherent
in applied engineering. The project
was designed ‘so that interest and
competition would exist among stu-
dents, and a practical solution could
be obtained without excessive
manual skills or shop facilities. The

theory of mechanical function gen-
erators Was included in the course
material. Therefore, a sufficient
basis existed for the design analysis.
Also, valuable course time was not
sacriﬁced at the expense of the
project, since the design and con-
struction could be accomplished at
home in a time interval equivalent
to ‘conventional homework assign-
ments.

There were many possible design
solutions to the given problem, and
the student was left on his own to
co'nsider available‘ materials and
electrical components, economic
costs, and construction problems.
Although this may not generally be
regarded as the proper method of
teaching by many educators, it was
felt that solving the problem for the
student would not be commensu-
rate with the correct representation
of applied engineering.

DEFINITION OF PROBLEM

You will be required to design and
construct an electrical analog com-
puter which will perform the mathe-
matical operations of multiplication

THE COMPUTER BY KEN KONICLEY is distinguished by an expanded scale which provided greater accuracy in the
generation y = x . The linkages are shown in the positions of :genera.ti-ngy = 20

and division. Also, using the same
multiplying and dividing computer
construction above, you will be re-
quired to design and construct
mechani'cal gears, cams, and link-
ages as required to physically por-
tray a solution to the mathematical
equation:
y = Xn
where; ne (0,1)
xe(0,100)

SPECIFICATIONS

1) Input and output scales should
be in the form of dial rotations in-
stead of calibrated curves to facili-
tate speed of operation.

9) Linear taper potentiometers
should be used instead of logarith-
mic taper potentiometers unless it
can be shown that a greater ac-
curacy can be obtained for both
parts of the problem deﬁnition.

3) Material costs cannot exceed
$5.00. This does not include aux-
iliary equipment inherent contained
in the repertoire of an electrical en-
gineering student, e.g., solder, solder-
ing iron, wire, panel board material,
etc. Recourse can be made to old
radios or junk to obtain parts for
the project at a rather small cost.

THE COMPUTER OF MARTIN GAZBODA features the evaluation of y = X for OLXLI. The linkages are positioned for

the evaluation of y = 0.10

GRADING

In addition to the above defini-
tion of problem and speciﬁcations
which must be followed, the follow-
ing scheme of grading will be ad-
hered to:

1) A verbal explanation of the
methodology of your computer re-
garding its advantages and disad-
vantages. Also testing of computer
in multiplication, division, and
evaluating y = xn for arbitrarily
chosen values with emphasis on
accuracy. (70%)

Q) Neatness of construction and
originality of design. (10%)

3) Theoretical design of computer
and block diagram. 
REFERENCE

In the fall 1962 publication of
Science Ea;pe7'z'mente7*, a section is
devoted to an electrical slide rule.
Circuit diagrams and explanations
of a multiplying and dividing slide
rule should be of help in providing
a starting point for your computer.
This is done on a practical basis
in the article.

The Solution

In the electrical analog of multi-

plication and division, the circuit

5

used by most students, consists of
linear potentiometers, ﬂashlight bat-
teries, and an ammeter as shown
below.

From Kirchof'f’s Voltage and Cur-
cuit Laws, it can be shown that
when the current through the am-
meter is zero, the relationship
among the potentiometer settings A,
B, and C is given by the following

expression:
C AB
Co
AoBo + A (A0 — A)
\l\/IA
IVIB

The above theoretical expression
reveals the inexact nature of the
above multiplied circuit with respect
to the desired multiplication, i.e.,

C = AB. Similiar inexactness ap-
aplies to the desired division, i.e.,
A = C/B. Moreover, economic

limitations in the speciﬁcations re-
quired the use of relatively inac-
curate linear potentiometers which
required total experimental calibra-
tions. In this way, the limitations
of the theoretical analysis were in-
troduced to the student. Despite

Floating on air...cushioned in foam

Sleeping is like ﬂoating on air, when the mattress is made of urethane foam . . . a mattress that “breathes”
air through every cell, and weighs so little that a housewife can lift it over her head! D By combining
exact proportions of ﬁve chemicals from Union Carbide, this versatile foam can be made soft, ﬁrm, or rigid.
Mattresses, upholstery, and pillows can be given their own degrees of resilience. Other formulations pro-
duce superior insulation in the form of prefabricated rigid panels or foamed in place. In a refrigerator trailer
body, this insulation can be used in much thinner sections than conventional materials, so cargo space is in-
creased substantially. > Recently, Union Carbide introduced “climate-controlled” polyether, which results
in uniform foam properties despite such curing variables as summer heat and humidity. Another Union
Carbide development is production of the ﬁrst polyether for ﬂame-lamination of thin foam sheets to cloth,
adding warmth without noticeable bulk. F In their work with chemicals, the people of Union Carbide have
pioneered in developing polyethers and silicones for urethane foam, found new uses for the foam,
and shown customers how to produce it.

these realistic problems, the majori-
ty of students maximized the ac-
curacy of their computer, obtaining
a deviation of -1- 1% in both multi-

- plication and division.

Generating a solution to the equa-
tion y = xn followed from the mul-
tiplier circuit. The mathematical
operations required in the solution
to this problem are shown in the
block diagram on the title pageof
this article. The procedure followed
by most students was as follows:
To transform X to log'°x by n was
accomplished by equating logl0x to
A, and n to B. To determine a solu-
tion to y = X which is equivalent to
anti—log (nlog'°x) an anti-log func-
tion generator is required. Again, a
four bar linkage provided the best
solution. In general, the accuracy in

generating solution to y = Xn for
arbitrary values of X and n was
within = 15% of the true value.

The major reasons for this large
deviation were poor construction
and meter sensitivity, small ranges
of X and log'°X, and incorrectly re-
lating the non-linear log'°x function
to the linear A function.
Observations

In addition to obtaining a theo-
retical solution to the problem defi-
nition, adherence to specifications,
and practicality of construction
created problems heretofore not
present in the educational experi-
ence of many students. Thus, the
consensus of both student and in-
structor opinions was that the pro-
ject did create an awareness to
the realities of applied engineering.
As one student wrote:

“The main thing I learned
from this project was that
theory does not always im-
ply practicality.”

Most of the projects did satisfy
the problem deﬁnition and speciﬁ-
cations. The best projects belonged
to Ken Konechy, Martin Gazboda,
and Joseph Mischyshyn. ‘These stu-
dents achieved the best accuracy in
all parts of the problem definition,
confirmed their projects with written
reports, and added unique changes
in the basic circuit which afforded

28

for the generation» of log 10 (X).

their computers greater accuracy.

The outstanding characteristics of
their computers in generating so-
lutions to the equation y = X
follow.

The typical range of variables for
the four bar linkages was 60
angular degrees; however, Ken
Konechy added a resistor in series
with potentiometer C which doubled
its rotation, thereby "doubling the
range of the four bar linkage. This
unique change to the basic circuit
minimized the error associated with
the positioning of desired variables,
providing his computer with the
best accuracy for L X L100. (See
Fig.) In view of the mathematical
difficulties associated with generat-
ing log x for OL X L], Martin
Gazboda provided the best solution
by inverting the x—scale from 1 to
100, thereby, obtaining an additional
range of X from 0.01 to 1. Thus, he
obtained the best overall accuracy
for the range of X from 0 to 100.
With meticulous care and neatness

in construction, Joseph Mischyshyn
obtained good accuracy with his
computer. This was rather amazing
when one considers that his design,
electrical components, and materials
were basically the same as those
of his colleagues who obtained lesser
accuracy.

Restricted only by the problem
specifications, the characteristics of
the project revealed more of the in-
dividual’s concept of what he, and
not his colleagues considered to be
the best solution to the given prob-
lem. For example, William Richards
designed his computer from a com-
pletely electrical point of view. Al-
though he did not obtain the accu-
racy of the computers mentioned
above, one cannot deny his personal
satisfaction at providing a solution
which he thought would be better
than those of his competitors.

On the other hand, some students
appeared to maximize the error of
their computers. As mentioned pre-
viously, the main reasons were due

9

\y..

,-»5_

working lab

to poor construction, and incorrectly
relating the non-linear logarithmic
function to the linear function.
Because of poor construction’ and
calibration of the potentiometer
scales, one student divided 6 by
0 and obtained 5. Although con-
trary to the annals of higher mathe-
matics, this incident did provide an
amusing interlude to the testing pro-
cedure. Also, many students failed
to realize that to generate a log-

.arithmic resistance function from

the linear resistance potentiometers,
it is necessary to make the scale of
rotational input non-linear. Ex-
amples of computers with these
errors accompany this article.

To compensate for the varied eco-
nomic backgrounds of the students,
a maximum material cost was de-
fined in the problem specifications.
In most cases, this covered the
cost of the required potentiometers.
The total cost of the project would
have been higher had not the lVIe-
chanical and Electrical Engineering
Departments provided the student

     
 
 
  
   
  
   
  
 
   
 
   
  

with linkage material and ammeters.
Furthermore, if electrical com-
ponents and materials still exceeded
the student’s personal budget, he
was able to improvise the required
materials from old radios and junk
material. As in the case of Ken
Konechy whose material cost was
$0.92, this provided a measure of
the students’ ingenuity and imagina-
tion not easily observed under con-
ventional laboratory procedures. It
is unfortunate that these qualities
of the human mind are not generally
tested by educators, for these are
the same qualities of the human
mind that Einstein considered more
important than knowledge.
Conclusion

Today t-he engineer needs a bal-
anced and disciplined education in
mathematics and the physical
sciences, in English, economics, and
human relations. He must also be
competent to reach beyond science
and mathematics to the realities of
applied engineering practice. It
takes more than a mastery of science
and technology to make a good
engineer. It takes a practical sense

/ 

of what should be done and why,
of how, and at what cost. Thus, the
purpose of this article is not to im-
ply a negation of conventional col-
lege laboratories, but to suggest the
introduction of limited laboratory
problems similar to those existent
in industry. Yet, from a fundamental
point of view, this article endeavors
to reassert the responsibility of
higher education to all of its stu-
dents — to provide and foster a
deeper understanding and aware-
ness of the world in which we live.

Design Z11 an-ual-Roller and Silent C’/lain Drives by Jack-
son and lV.[oreland. Publishers: American Sprocket Chain
l\/Ianufacturers Association. $5.00.

Prepared for the express purpose of informing student
and practicing engineers about roller chains, this Design
Zllanual will serve as a handy aid for those who wish to
become more familiar with the subject. Especially when
designing conveyors, machine drives, and such items
as precision ratio drives, will reference be made to this
handy and easily understood manual.

To acquaint the student with the importance of the
chain drive, the authors briefly outline a history of the
subject, concentrating mainly on the diverse uses of
chain drives in ﬁelds such as agriculture, mining, con-
struction, machine tools, conveyors, and many others.
The rapid growth of the chain drive industry since its
conception is easily understood once one realizes the
many hundreds of applications which are now commonly
seen throughout industry, in transportation, and on
the farm.

Beginning with the third chapter, the technical
aspects of chain drives are emphasized. In this chapter,
a detailed discussion of chains and sprockets—their vari-
ous parts, nomenclature, and types——is pursued. Here,
as throughout the book, numerous illustrations and photo-
graphs are expertly used to convey accurate descriptions
of parts and nomenclature, in addition to emphasizing
important points.

The remainder of the book becomes even more
technical, dealing with the design of roller chains and
sprockets, design of roller chain drives, maintenance,
and a whole chapter deals with special points concerning
silent chain drives. To the interested student, these
chapters present a wealth of valuable information, in-
cluding numerous design formulae, detailed explanations
of conditions which cause needless shortening of chain

life, and important speciﬁcations of roller chains. Tables
showing standard speciﬁcations of all parts of chain drives
are included, helping to make the manual Valuable as a
reference too. Among the tables included in the book
are those on general chain dimensions, minimum bore
and hub diameters, ASA horsepower ratings, with special
tables included for data on silent chains.

Other items which make the manual valuable as a
reference are several examples of the calculations involved
in designing regular and silent chain drives. The ex-
amples are clear an'd_easy to understand, and bring out
a few relatively important points related to the text
material. Students who wish to evaluate their own skill
in this type of work can do so, because a few design
problems, with the recommended solutions, are included
within the book.

At the end of the book a two-page glossary of terms
frequently used in connection with chain drives is in-
cluded. This should certainly prove helpful to anyone
who will be working with or discussing the subject.

Through special arrangement with the American
Sprocket Chain Manufacturers Association, Design
M anual-Roller and Silent Chain Drives will be given free
to any interested Pitt engineering student. Merely clip
out the form at the bottom of this column, ﬁll in the
desired information, and deposit it in the special re-
cepticales on the doors of Skyscraper offices in the 44-12

patterns of swearing

by Helen E. Ross

Discovery (London)

SWEARING is a subject which
seems to have received very little
attention from psychologists. It is
seldom mentioned, except in the
course of some other study, and
only the psycho—analysts offer theo-
ries about its origin and purpose.
Fenichel,' for example, regards ob-
scese swearing as a substitute sex
activity which gives the swearer a
sense of power over the sex demon.
This theory may help explain ob-
scene swearing, but does not account
for blasphemous swearing which
often occurs in the same breath.
Moreover, for many, especially
among the industrial working
classes, swearing is a habit no more
meaningful than a difference in dia-
lect.

Upbringing and temperament play
a large part in determining the
swearing habits of an individual,
but I was especially interested in the
way group morale can encourage or
discourage swearing in its members.

Since swearing is often thought
to be a sign of annoyance or stress,
I kept records of swearing rates as

an indication of group morale dur-
ing three weeks of a university ex-
pedition to Arctic Norway. The
group consisted of ﬁve men and
three women between nineteen and
twenty—four years of age, all of
whom were zoologists, except myself,
a psychologist.

The main purpose of the expedi-
tion was to study the diurnal rhy-
thms of birds during continuous
daylight. As the work entailed con-
siderable interruption or loss of
sleep, most members had good cause
for becoming irritable and swearing.

I recorded the -swearing rates_ for
each member on different colored
knitting counters which I kept in
my pocket. Records were only kept
for a few hours at the beginning
and end of each day when most of
the group were together, but these
scores were sufficient to show gen-
eral t r e n d s . Unfortunately, the
group soon discovered I was keep-
ing records, but after the initial re-
actions of anger or amusement had
died down this seemed to have no
effect on the scores (apart from one

day when the two heaviest swearers
engaged in a deliberate com-
petition).

Each individual had his own
vocabulary and habitual level of
swearing, and tended to keep to the
same rank order in the group how-
ever much the total swearing—level
rose or fell.

The words used were blasphemous
rather than obscene, as is to be ex-
pected, among the middle classes.
Unlike the working classes, however,
their use of obscene words was de-
liberate rather than habitual, and
they took a delight in using them
in their correct biological sense.
The heavier swearers used the more
violent language. No new expres-
sions were coined apart from the
word “Click!” which arose in con-
nection with my knitting counters.
Hence such phrases as “That click-

The relationship between swear-
ing and stress was slightly unex-
pected. The amount of swearing in-
creased noticeably when people
were relaxed and happy and,
though it also increased under slight
stress, it decreased when they were
really annoyed or tried. In fact
there seemed to be two types of
swearing: “social” swearing and
“annoyance” s w e a r i n g. Social
swearing was intended to be friend-
ly and a sign of being “one of the
gang”; it depended upon an audi-
ence for its effect, while annoyance
swearing was a reaction to stress
regardless of the audience. Social
swearing was by far the commoner.

The total amount of swearing
varied as shown on the chart given
above. Under conditions of very low
stress it was almost entirely social,
but with increasing stress it dimin-
ished and annoyance swearing in-
creased. The drop-off of the one was
more rapid than the rise of the
other, resulting in a dip in the total
under conditions of medium stress.
Under_higher stress, social swearing
almost entirely disappeared and an-
noyance swearing increased until it
too reached a peak and began to
drop. Under conditions of serious
stress, there was silence.

Social swearing was easily in-

INCREASING STRESS ""‘

hibited by the lack of an apprecia-
tive audience or tl1e presence of
non-swearers. Tl1e men wl1o had
been in camp for a week without the
women said they felt it necessary
to watch their tongues once the
women arrived. When half the
group, including the only three non-
swearers, left 011 a separate expedi-
tion, the sweari11g rate immediately
doubled a11d remained very l1igh.
This may have been due to a delib-
erate attempt to compensate for
lost numbers by a11 increase in

solidarity. Similarly, when a medi-

um swearer (female) spent two
days alone with a heavy swearer
(male), all swearing rates of both
increased, but when she spent a
fortnight with a medium swearer
(male), all swearing soon stopped,
probably because the latter two
needed the facilitative effect of a
heavy swearer or a larger audience.
Other subjects might not be so
easily inﬂuenced by the moods of
their companions, but unless they
are affected to some degree their
swearing cannot be classed as
“social” and must be merely a
verbal habit.

The fact that the usual reaction
to serious stress is silence suggests
that swearing is a sign that a dis-
agreeable situation is bearable; in-
deed, the verbal expression of dis-

comfort may even help to reduce
stress. There is son1e experimental
evidence which seems to le11d s11p-
port to the hypothesis that, in a
given situation, subjects who swear
or complain are likely to be under
less stress than those who keep silent.
For example, Reiser at al._.2 when
examining the effects of different
laboratory procedures on the physi-
ological reactions to stress of en-
listed soldiers, found that those
subjects who felt free to “gripe”
about arm_v life with their inter-
viewer were much less likely to show
a rise in blood pressure than those
who did not complain. King and
Henry3 have shown that subjects
who direct their anger against the
experimenter when under stress
show a less tense physiological re-
action than those who control their
anger (a nor-epinephrine cardiovas-
cular pattern as opposed to epine-
phrine). A similar difference was
found by l\/IacKinnon“ among sub-
jects taking a written test where it
was possible to cheat; those who
swore and blamed the questions
were liable to cheat Without com-
punction whereas those who kept
silent or blamed their own stupidity
felt guilty at the very idea of cheat-
ing and were more anxious and tense
during the test.

The scientiﬁc study of swearing is

complicated by the diﬁiculty of de-
ciding what is to count as swearing.
The same Words may be habitual
for one individual and very rare for
another. In future studies it would
robabl be best to discount habit-
P Y
ually heavy swearers and .concen-
trate on medium swearers. More
light might be thrown on social
swearing by studying the same in-
dividual in similar experimental
situations but among different sizes
and types of groups. More direct
experiments could also be made on
the effects of swearing on reducing
tension, and on the differences in
upbringing and personality which
encourage such s w e a r i n g ; using
Eysenck’s5 extraversion-introversion
scale I should expect heavy swear-
ing to correlate with extraversion
and light swearing with introversion.

have

you
registered

your

slide rule?

Dean Turkes and Dave Berkowitz look on as Ron Harring operates the

engraver.

Beta Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega, National Service
Fraternity, is making it possible for all Pitt students and
faculty to help insure against the loss of their slide rules.

The Chapter has inaugurated a program of en-
graving a serial number on the frame of the slide rule.
This engraving will be done by a special machine which
will produce neat and modern figures.

Slide r11lcs can be registered between 10:00 and 3:00
in the Alpha Phi Omega office in room 312 of the Student
Union from October 21 through October 25. After the
initial registration, students, who have not already done
so, may have their slide rules engraved on the first
V\7ednesday of every month.

The studests will be given a wallet-sized registration
card and other cards will be kept on file. It’s not a fool?
proof system, but it gives the students a chance of recover-

ing their slide rules if they are lost and turned into the
Alpha Phi Omega Office.

Dean Turks had this to say about the plan:

“The inauguration of this program for the regis-

tration of slide rules should aid the engineering

student in the recovery of a lost. slide rule. The
effective operation of the plan will assist the
administrative offices in the School of Engineer-

ing and ‘Mines in the returning of lost slide rules

which are deposited with them.”

A twenty-five cent fee will be charged. This may
well save a student about twenty-one dollars, the price
of a new slide rule. All money collected will be used for
campus improvements and projects, such as the Home-
coming Queen’s Float, Ugly Man On Campus Contest,
and a possible combining of all campus ‘losts and founds’.

It takes an average of 7 horsepower to air condition an automobile. You'd think the complexities of
keeping an astronaut cool and comfortable would require at least as much power. But Garrett-AiResearch
designed and built a system that requires about the same energy as a 60-watt light bulb. And
that's important in space, where power is at a premium. E] The Garrett system takes advantage of the
low boiling point of water in space to absorb heat from the astronaut's space suit and spacecraft. The system
is tiny, lightweight, and works in zero gravity. [:1 This remarkable cooling unit is part of the entire
environmental control system which Garrett supplies for the NASA-McDonnell Project Mercury missions.

TECHNICAL MEN WE'LL NEED FROM THE CLASS OF '64

These booklets helped persuade some 700 new B.S. graduates
to join us in 1963. It was mostly a matter of getting facts.

For example, if you want to start your career in a certain
section of the country, you'll find that Du Pont——with facilities
in 28 states—will try to accommodate you.

If you're interested in growth for what it can mean to you-

personally, you'll be interested to know that our sales have
increased 750% since 1937. You've probably heard that R&D
expenditures are a good indicator of a company's future success.
We spend $90 million a year on it, $60 million of which goes
straight into “pioneering research"— the discovery of new
scientific truths and new materials.

Our booklets will answer most of your preliminary questions.
Later—or even now if you wish—we can talk specifics by letter,

Theory with Practice

 
 

Q. Mr. McCune, how do you define engineering design?

A. First let°s look at what engineering really is. The National Society of Profes-
sional Engineers _calls.i_t f'the creation of technical things and services useful to
man." I would pai‘aplirase-’fh‘at to add an industry emphasis: engineering is linking
an ability to do with speciﬁc customer needs and wants. The link is an engineering
design of _a-useful product or service.

0. In the light of this definition, how can the young engineer prepare himself
for industry? '

A. In college he should absorb as much theory as possible and begin to develop
certain attitudes that will help him later in his profession. The raw material for a
design, information, flows from three general funds: Scientiﬁc Knowledge of
Nature; Engineering Technology; and what I call simply Other Relevant Informa-
tion. Academic training places heavy emphasis on the first two areas, as it should.
Engineers in industry draw heavily on theorems, codiﬁed information, and signiﬁ-
cant recorded experience basic to engineering disciplines taught in college. The
undergraduate must become knowledgeable in these areas and skilled in the ways of
using this information, because he will have little time to learn this after graduation.
He also Inust develop a responsive attitude toward the third fund.

Q. As you say, we learn theory in college, but where do we get the “Other
Relevant lnformation”—the third fund you mentioned?

A. This knowledge is obtained for the most part by actually doing engineering
work. This is information that must be applied to a design to make sure that it not
only works, but that it also meets the needs and wants that prompted its considera-
tion in the first place. For example, we can design refrigerators, turbines, computers,
or missile guidance systems using only information from the first two funds of
knowledge——heat ﬂow, vibration, electronic theory, etc.——and they will work! But
what about cost, reliability, appearance, size—will the prospective customer buy
them? The answers to these important design questions are to be found in the third
fund; for example the information to determine optimum temperature ranges, to
provide the features that appeal to users, or to select the best manufacturing
processes. In college you can precondition yourself to seek and accept this sort of
information, but only experience in industry can give you speciﬁc knowledge
applicable to a given product.

Q. Could you suggest other helpful attitudes we might develop?

A. Remember, industry exists to serve the needs and wants of the market place,
and the reasons for doing things a certain way arise from the whole spread of condi-
tions which a given design has to satisfy. Learn how to enter into good working
relationships with people. Much of the Other Relevant Information can be picked
up only from others. Also train yourself to be alert and open-minded about your
professional interests. In industry you’ll be expected to learn quickly, keep abreast
in your ﬁeld, and to grow from assignment to assignment. Industry will give you the
opportunity. Your inherent abilities and attitudes will largely decide your progress.

Cover Description: This is an artist’s conception of an Air Force X-20
(Dyna-Soar) spacecraft in orbit just before it begins its re-en-try
into the earth’s‘ atmosphere. The X-20 will be rocketed into orbit
and flown back through the atmosphere by its pilot to an airplane-
like landing. When the pilot begins to fly his craft back through
space, he will keep the ‘delta-winged craft in this nose-up attitude so
that much of the heat which is generated will be on the craft’s under-
side away from the cockpit and equipment bay.

yna-soar

By William T. Mason

The delta-Winged Dyna—Soar
X—2O spacecraft, powered by
the 3-stage Titan III launch
vehicle, will carry man into
orbit and enable him to
maneuver during re-entry
while gliding to a safe land-

ing on earth.

With the successful closing of the
Mercury project, we can now look
forward to the next phase of manned
space ﬂight— the X-20 Dyna—Soar.
Both the Mercury and the upcom-
ing Gemini spacecraft have been
referred to as ﬂying rocks that need
parachutes to slow them enough to
insure landing the astronaut in one
piece. The Mercury and Gemini
type space_craft generate no lift
upon re-entry into the atmosphere;
therefore, the point of touchdown
for these craft depends entirely on

re-entry, criteria—velocity, attitude,
etc. On the other hand, the,X-920
Dyna-Soar is a delta Winged glider
which looks and behaves more like
an airplane than any spacecraft yet
developed. A combination of high
speed, extreme altitude, and man-
euverability Will permit the X-20
pilot to shorten or lengthen his
range by thousands‘ of miles and to
maneuver far to the left or right of
his ﬂight path to reach his landing
site. Landing the X-920 should be
no more complicated than landing

the X-15 or a modern jet ﬁghter.
The. Dyna-Soar concept is_ far
from new. In 1933, at the Univer-

‘ sity of Vienna, an obscure engineer

and physicist, Dr. Eugene Saenger,
wrote a book entitled, THE TECH-
NIQUE OF ROCKET FLIGHT in
which heiintroduced the idea of a
rocket airplane. About three years
later, Saenger’s work began to cause
a stir, and he Was invited to Ger-
many to continue his Work under
the auspices of the Hermann Goer-
iiig Institute, the research organiza-
