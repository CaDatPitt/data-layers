Westinghouse desalting plants can make the sea an endless source of fresh water

Where can the earth's expanding pop-
ulation get the fresh water it needs?
We can get it from the endless supply
in the sea.

Desalting plants offer one of the

most practical solutions to the problem.

Since 1951, 57 Westinghouse de-
salting units have been installed around
the world. They are desalting millions
of gallons of water a day.

Westinghouse is prepared to start
building water—desalting facilities to
help solve water deficiencies for coastal
cities of any size—anywhere in the
world.

Engineering and Science at RCA

Traveling Wave Masers

RCA’s recent maser research and development
has yielded systems with outstanding low-noise
microwave ampliﬁer performance along with
adaptability for ﬁeld use. These ampliﬁers ex-
hibit ultra-low noise temperature (8-l0°K) and
high gain (30-40 db) with extreme gain sta-
bility. Wide tunability (up to 50%) and large
instantaneous bandwidth (up to 150 MHz)
have been achieved.

Several technique areas involved with this
work are of particular interest. Iron- and
chromium-doped rutile (titanium dioxide) are
employed as active paramagnetic materials, in
a “meander—line” slow wave structure, provid-
ing wide bandwidth and high gain. Ferrite re-
verse isolators function to provide a high
degree of gain unidirectionality. The requisite
magnetic ﬁeld is provided by a superconduct-
ing magnet within a cryogenic enclosure, and
the entire system is operated by a closed-cycle
refrigerator requiring no helium replenishment,
so that ﬁeld use in radar systems, satellite com-
munications and radiometry is practical. Sec-
tionalized magnet structures with independent
controls permit “stagger-tuning” the maser,
so that its very high gain can be traded for
even greater bandwidth.

The illustration shows the active elements
of a maser ampliﬁer typical of such a high-
performance system. The meander line, seen
as a zig-zag conducting path on a ﬂexible in-
sulating sheet, goes down one side of the pump
cavity, folds over, and returns on the other
side. The cavity is the terminal portion of a
waveguide assembly, with microwave pump
energy being introduced at the other end. One
of two rutile paramagnetic crystals is shown
in close proximity to the meander line, the
ferrite isolator being on the opposite side of
the meander line and not visible. In operation,
the entire structure shown in the photograph
lies between pole faces of the superconducting
magnet, which provides a precisely controlled
and distributed transverse ﬁeld, typically, of a
few thousand gauss. The assembly including
the magnet is enclosed in a chamber main-
tained at 4.2°K.

Ampliﬁers with performance as described
above are by no means the end, however. New
advances are in the ofﬁng through research in
areas including optical inversion (pumping),
operation at temperatures above 4.2°K, higher
frequency operation, and the use of active
materials in powder rather than single-crystal
form.

Integrated Launch control
and checkout Systems
for Saturn Lunar Vehicles

Highly sophisticated Saturn automatic ground
checkout and launch sequencing equipment
has been under development by RCA since
late 1960 for the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, Marshall Space Flight
Center. The original Saturn Ground Computer
System (SGCS) was used on the highly suc-
cessful Saturn 1 program; an advanced version
of the SGCS is currently being readied for the
Saturn IB and Saturn V programs. The RCA
110 computer was the heart of the Saturn I
SGCS; the RCA 110A is the heart of the
Saturn IB and Saturn V SGCS.

SATURN V
DATA LINK —-—-- -—-

The block diagram shows the tandem, two
computer conﬁguration for Saturn V at Com-
plex 39, the lunar program “space port” at
NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Complex 39
is based on a mobile launch concept to gain
high efﬁciency in launch operations. Vehicles
are assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Build-
ing (VAB) on a Mobile Launcher structure.
After the Saturn V with its Apollo Spacecraft
is completely checked out, the vehicle in its
Launcher is transported to one of three launch
pads for a remotely controlled launch. The
computer in the Launch Control Center (LCC)
controls the activities of the “slave” computer
in the Mobile Launcher via a 250 kilobit/sec
digital data link. The conﬁguration thus re-
mains the same for both VAB and pad opera-
tions; only the length of the data link changes.
The complexumbilical interface between the
vehicle and ground support equipment remains
undisturbed until launch. The LCC computer
controls the sequence of checkout and launch
countdown programs performed by the Mobile
Launcher computer via commands transmitted
over the data link. The “slave” computer in
turn performs the detailed testing and sequenc-
ing, performs evaluation and data compression
of test results, and transmits the data back to
the LCC computer which relays it to the cor-
rect operator for display. LCC operators can
override, via their console request keyboards,
the predetermined sequence of programs stored
in the Mobile Launcher computer or handle
unusual test situations.

In addition to conventional serial computer
functions, special ‘parallel input/output capa-
bilities are included for control of 1008 discrete
(relay driver) outputs, monitoring of 1512 dis-
crete (contact closure) inputs, a wide range of
DC and AC analog outputs (72 in quantity),
a wide range of DC and AC analog inputs
(300 in quantity), telemetry interface, 3 internal
interval timers, several external clock inputs,
and an interface with the spaceborne computer.

In line with the developmental nature of the
total Saturn program, the role of RCA’s
Saturn Ground Computer System is continu-

ing to expand in factory and static testing, as
well as launch operations, as automation tech-
niques are applied to other Saturn subsystems.

A Light Detector That Makes
Laser communications Practical

RCA has developed a photoconductive device
that operates on an alternating current that
can sense up to 100 million changes in light
intensity per second. This is sulﬁcient to dis-
tinguish as many as 25 separate television
programs, all carried on a single laser beam.
This major breakthrough in light detection is
extremely fast, enormously sensitive and is
responsive to the whole range of optical fre-
quencies, ranging from infra-red through the
visible spectrum to ultra-violet.

By contrast, previous means of detecting
laser light employed photoconductors operated
by direct current, photoelectric cells, semicon-
ductor photodiodes and electron photomulti-
plier tubes._The major drawbacks were that
these methods were either too slow, too in-
sensitive, or too limited to the portions of the
electromagnetic spectrum where most lasers
operate poorly, if indeed, at all.

The laser is, to state it simply, a high fre-
quency transmitter with the capacity to carry
a fantastic amount of information. The real
problem has been to develop a receiver both
fast enough and sensitive enough to detect and
process incoming information. This new device
has the sensitivity, speed and frequency range
that can make possible a practical system for
laser communications.

This radical new detector is a tiny speck-
sized piece of photoconductive material
mounted in a small cavity continuously bathed
in microwaves oscillating at 10 billion cycles
per second.

When a laser beam bearing information in
the form of intensity variations enters the
cavity, it strikes the photoconductor and frees
electrons. They, in turn, begin to oscillate
rapidly up and down within the material, in
direct response to the alternating electric ﬁeld
inherent in the surrounding microwaves. These
electron oscillators control the amount of
microwave power that leaves the cavity. The
variations in the incoming light are then con-
verted to intensity variations in the outgoing
microwaves. Conventional microwave tech-
niques make it possible to process these vari-
ations. These techniques are similar to those
used in modern radar and commercial tele-
vision systems.

EE, ME, ChE, Physics and Chemistry Graduates:

How soon after graduation will somebody
give you a chance to invent something?

It could happen on your first job.

Some very young engineers and scientists at
Xerox helped our “old timers” invent the electro-
mechanical-optical-chemical machine pictured above
——the Xerox 2400. On its patent documents you'll find
names like John Wirley (BSEE Univ. of Detroit ’60),
Henry P. Jankowski (BSEE Rensselaer Poly '62), and
Larry H. Warren (BSEE Clarkson '63). They all joined
Xerox right after graduating.

The 2400 is no fluke. It's just a recent example
of a tradition that began in 1959, when Xerox revo-
lutionized the office copying field by introducing the
now world-famous 914 Copier. From the 914 onward,
every new piece of equipment or system we've devel-
oped has had no real counterpart already on the scene
from any competitor.

What about the future? It gets even more inter-
esting. Because as advanced as today's systems may

appear, they don't yet fully reveal the true technology
Xerox is pursuing—graphic communications.

Born out of the global information explosion
and its incredible potential for helping to solve man's
oldest problems (as well as his newest scientific rid-
dles), graphic communications at Xerox encompasses
the entire spectrum of communications in a graphic
sense: the formulation, reception, transmission, re-
cording, storing, retrieving, processing, copying and
presentation of any meaningful images.

And if you don't think all this has a habit of
creating continuing opportunities to “invent some-
thing,” ask John, Henry, Larry. . . or some of your
own alumni who started their careers here...or your
Placement Director. If you prefer, write directly to
Mr. Stephen G. Crawford, Xerox Corporation, P.O.
Box 1540, Rochester, New York 14603.

Performance Note: The Xerox 2400 (illustrated) can produce copies on ordinary paper directly from an original document at the rate of 2,400 per hour.
No “master” need be prepared first. An operator simply places the original on the machine, dials the number of copies wanted, and presses a button.

Where will you stand 10 years
from today, when halt of what you now
know becomes obsolete?

Right now you're steeped in the latest
technologies. But 10 years from now
half of this knowledge will be obsolete.
And half of what you will need to know
isn't even available today.

To keep up, you'll have to spend
an increasing amount of your time in
professional study.

That's another good reason for joining
IBM. We offer you a broad choice of
educational programs—-from on-1' ob
training to graduate study programs
supported by the company.

We want to help you grow because

we've found it's the best way for
IBM to grow.

Today IBM is a leader in science

and technology. A dynamic company
whose people and systems are at
work on almost everything new in the
world today. The discovery of new
knowledge. The design of new
products. The development of new
solutions to a host of problems. IBM

is an exciting company that enables
you to stay technologically "hot"
throughout your career—and provides
you with real opportunity for
advancement.

Your first opportunity with IBM starts
with your placement officer. And with
the IBM interviewers when they come
to your campus. See them—and learn
why you won't stand still at IBM.

Communications

by Walter R. Arnheim

Ever since the pr-ehistoric cave dweller
pointed his ﬁnger and grunted a gut-
teral “Ugh”, man has always been
experimenting and innovating to im-
prove the ﬁeld of communications.
Thus, languages were formed. Egyp-
tian hieroglyphics and Sumerian
cuneiform writing slowly evolved into
alphabets. With 'Gutenberg"s inven-
tion of movable type, books, news-
papers, and magazines grew popular.

The nineteenth century fathered
many new means of communication.
Daguerre and Niepce discovered
photography. Edison perfected the
phonograph. Morse type out on the
telegraph “What hath God wrought!”
while Bell commanded via telephone
“Mr. Watson, come here. Iwant you.”

The twentieth century may be
noted for its increased electrical so-
phistication. From Marconi’s wireless,
spring-s radio. Sound pictures are
presented in theaters and commercial
television in the home. Artiﬁcial
earth satellites send back information
from Mars and beyond as space
telemetry is perfected.

W-ith -this background, we look to
the future for newer and better forms

of communication. It is the purpose
of this article to examine in detail
two of these modern forms of
communication.

Phonovidan invention of the West-
inghouse Electric Corporation, consti-
tutes an electronic system for record-
ing and playing back still pictures
and sound on a television screen from
an ordinary home tape machine or
phonograph.

Picturesque records. Up to 400 pic-
tures and 40 minutes of voice and
music are present on the two sides of
a 12 inch, 33% rpm recording, called a
Videodisc. 1200 pictures with accom-
panying voice and music can be
stored on a standard '7 inch reel of
narrow slow speed audio tape. The
pictures can be line drawings, charts,
printed text, or photographs. The
quality of the sound, as described by
Westinghouse acousti-c engineers, is
comparable to that broadcast by AM
radio stations.

The Videodisc and audio tape are
not recordings that trigger pictures
from a slide projector. Both the audio
signal and the video signal are present

in the grooves of the recording and
both are picked up by the phono-
graph or tape recorder. On the two
sides of a 12 inch long-play record, as
it is used for high-quality sound re-
production, are 30 to 40 million vibra-
tions in a compact, easy—to-handle
form. In the Videodisc this capability
is extended beyond the traditional
reproduction of voice and mu-sic.

The complete phonovid record-
playback system consists of four
components:

’ a slow—scan television camera for
taking the pictures;

' an audio tape recorder for record-
ing the pictures and sound;

° a scan converter to convert the
taped pictures to the standard
television signals;

' and a conventional television re-
ceiver to display the pictures and
reproduce the sound.

The same pictures and sound can
be stored on a ‘phonograph record in-
stead of a tape using a standard turn-
table and a long-play record to
reproduce pictures, voice and music
of equal quality.

Phonovid's heart. The heart of
Phonovid is the electronic linkage be-
tween the turntable and the TV
receiver. All of the required circuitry
can be contained in a small compact
cabinet. Basically, it is a slow~to—fast
scan converter. It takes the electrical
pulsations from the phonograph pick-
up and converts them for TV display.
An electronic storage tube stores the
picture line by line and, when the
picture is complete, reads it out to
the television receiver. Two such
storage tubes are used. One is re-
peatedly reading out a picture while
the other tube is constructing the
next one from the video information
in the grooves of the recording. The
storage tubes alternately read out a
picture every six seconds. Such a
storage and read-out process is the
method NASA uses to obtain tele-
vision pictures from weather satellites
and space probes.

An important feature of Phonovid
is that any part of the videodisc can
be held, skipped or repeated by
manually lifting the photograph arm.
During interruption of the sound, the
picture continue-s to appear on the
television screen, allowing for discus-
sion, emphasis or interpretation of the
material.

Another advantage of Phonovid is
in the brightness of the television dis-
play, which is approximately 10 times
greater than conventional strip ﬁlm
or motion picture presentations. Thus,
Phonovid can be shown anywhere at
normal inside levels of illumination
without darkening a room with shades
or by turning out lights.

Practically all existing audio and
TV equipment is compatible with the
Phonovid system. Without modiﬁca-
tion, Phonovid can be integrated into
today’s closed-circuit and standard-
broadcast TV systems. The recording
is played on an ordinary turntable
and the pictures and sound may ap-
pear on any number of television re-
ceivers in a classroom throughout an
entire building. With existing tele-
phone equipment, it can transmit pic-
tures over ordinary telephone lines.

Said Dr. William E. Shoup, West-
inghouse vice president—research,
“Phonovid is a portable system with
unusual ﬂexibility. The Videodiscs in-

Phonovid recording and playback

volved cost a fraction of presenta-
tions of equal information content on
sound-slide or sound—n1otion picture
ﬁlm. It appears to hold unusual
promise as a ﬂexible, eas_v—to-operate,
inexpensive audio-visual system for
educational instruction."

While Westinghouse was develop-
ing its Phonovid system for record-
ing and playing back still pictures and
on a "television

Perkin-Elmer Corporation was incor-
porating the laser with the television.

The word laser is an acronym for
light ampliﬁcation by the stimulated
emission of radiation. The light is
highly coherent, bright, pure and
monochromatic. First demonstrated in
1961, the laser has opened the scien-
tiﬁc door to a broad area of uses for
this light source. man_\' in the ﬁeld of
communications.

Laser TV scans model in dayligh+ and in complefe darkness

Red Iighf. Perkin-Elmer ha-s devel-
oped a laser tel-evision system which
needs no studio lights or other exter-
nal sources of illumination. Scanned
by rapidly moving narrow lines of red
laser light, subjects in complete dark-
ness appear on the TV screen as if in
daylight brightness.

Lasers of various types have been
constructed, some of intense power
which virtually emit “bullets” of light
which have a life of only a fraction
of a second. The gas laser used in the
present laser TV system is of far

lower power an-d emits it-s pure light
beam continuously. The intensity of
the laser beam is well below the level
which might endanger the vision of
human subjects.

Although the present system is
operable under conditions of low light
or complete darkness, the technique
could also be used in bright light with
some modiﬁcation of equipment. Pic-
ture quality in ei-ther case i-s
exceptionally sharp and clear.

Red light emitted by the helium-
neon gas laser- forms a continuous

Nighf phoio in rain from 30 fee+

wave to scan the subject through a
pair of rotating, diamond-faceted mir-
rors. The energy reflected from the
target is sensed by a photomultiplier
and used t-o intensity modulate the
cathode ray tube in a television
monitor whose electron beam is
scanning in synchronism with the
transmitted laser beam.

The laser employed is a helium-
neon un-it with approximately 15 milli-
watts output in a one milliradian
beam at 6,328 angstroms. The beam
from this laser is reﬂected off a folding
mirror to the line scanner. This scan-
ner consists of a 16-sided 11/2 inch
diameter polygon prism mounted in-
tegral with the scanner rotor. This
motor, driven from a 2 kc. soild state
power oscillator, drives the line scan-
ner at approximately 60,000 rpm or
60,000/60 x 16 = 16,000 scans per
second.

Following the line scanner, the
beam strikes the 244-sided frame
scanner running at 150 rpm or 150/
60 X 24 = 60 frames per second. The
beam reﬂected off the frame scanner
continues on toward t-he target. In
combination, the line and frame
scanners cause the target to be scan-

ned at rates similar to commercial
a television (15,750 lines per second and

60 frames per second). The one mil-
liradian beam results in resolution
similar to that of commercial
television.

A portion of the laser energy re-
ﬂected from the target is detected by
an 11-stage photomultiplier with an

spectral ﬁlter located in front of the
photocathode rejects 99% of the back-
ground light and preludes saturat-ion
from background.

Following the photomultiplier, a
preampliﬁer with a gain of 26 db. and
a band width of 5 me. raises the
signal to a level sufficient to drive the
video ampliﬁer of a commercial tele-
vision set and intensity modulate the
trace on the picture tube.

S-20 photocathode. A 90 angstrom

The deﬁector circuits on the tele-
vision monitor are synchronized with
the scanning laser beam by means of
photocells placed in the scanning
beams. The line -sync cell is located
between the line and frame scanners
so that it is illuminated by the scan-
ning beam at the beginning of each
frame. The output of the line sync is
ampliﬁed and shaped in the lin-e sync
ampliﬁer which generates 20 volt
pulses which synchronize the horizon-
tal deﬂection circuit in the television
monitor. The output of the frame
sync cell is ampliﬁed and shaped in
the frame sync ampliﬁer resulting in
20 volt pulses which are used to trig-
ger the vertical deﬂection circuits of
the television monitor.

Because the light emitted from the
laser TV camera comes from a single
source, the ligh-ting effects are similar
to t-hose of a photo taken with a
ﬂashbulb. The effect of many light

landing spots can be readily marked
off with reﬂective paints or tapes.
These would give returns to the laser
receiver with several hundred times
the intensity of the surrounding
terrain.

Laser TV has potential as a means
of covert surveillance for law enforce-
ment agencies. As used in the present
system, t-he laser beam’-s fast scan
speed and low intensity combine to
make it virtually invisible, so that
dark areas such as doorways «could be
scanned at night Without the knowl-
edge of those observed. With a prop-
erly tailored system it would be
possible to observe persons at a dis-
tance in excess of a mile. In the ﬁeld
of science, a number of application
such as the study of the nocturnal
habits of animals may also be feasible.

Man’s demand for means of com-
munication has been insatiable. No
matter how many new means may be
developed, he is reluctant to let go of
the old. The telephone did not re-
place the telegraph, but was added to
it. Neither did television replace the
movies, nor did photography replace
painting. It is on such a ﬁrm founda-
tion that Westinghouse’s Phonovid
and Perkin—Elmer’s laser television
were developed. And from this higher
level, the ﬁeld of communications will
continue to spiral upward. Where to,
who knows.

Sophisticated, work-saving aids
help Bell System engineers
provide important communications services

As an engineer yourfuture could be important to us.
You might be able to contribute to our continuing
leadership in the communications ﬁeld. Therefore, you
should know something about us and how we operate.

Bell System engineers deal with modern problems
in modern ways. They have at their command the
latest in technology and equipment.

An example is how computer programs aid in
providing telephone service for new communities.

Engineers at Bell Telephone Laboratories have
devised computer programs broad enough in scope
so that Bell System operating telephone companies
can use them to engineer the required wide variety
of telephone plant networks.

As part of a continuing effort, programs have been
designed to analyze communications needs of an
area for determining the best plant network layout
and switching office location.

in general, the necessary data are collected and the

This ?

 

In this hypothetical geographical area, communications could be supplied with one large tele-
phone switching office and a network of cables (left), or with three sma||er’off‘ices and a different

engineer selects a number of alternative plans to be
analyzed in detail by a computer. His final decision is
based primarily on an analysis of the computer output.

The computer supplies more signiﬁcant data, and
supplies it much faster, than laborious, manual cal-
culation methods. The engineer is thus relieved of
dull, time-consuming computation, and he plans facili-
ties with increased conﬂdence—knowing that he is
providing efficient and economical communications,
tailored for a given area.

You may well ﬁnd a rewarding career in the Bell
System, where people find solutions to exciting
problems. The Bell System companies are equal
opportunity employers. Arrange for an on-campus
interview through your Placement Office, or talk to
a local Bell System company.

The Company's first engine, the Wasp, took
to the air on May 5, 1926. Within a year the
Wasp set its first world record and went on
to smash existing records and set standards
for both land and seaplanes for years to
come, carrying airframes and pilots higher,
farther, and faster than they had ever gone
before.

In recent years, planes powered by Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft have gone on to set
new standards of performance in much the
same way as the Wasp had done in the
1920's. The 727 and DC-9 are indicative of
the new family of short-to-medium range
jetliners which are powered by the highly
successful JT8D turbofan. Examples of
current military utilizations are the J58-
powered Mach 3 YF-12A which recently
established four world aviation records and
the advanced TF30-powered F-111 variable-
geometry fighter aircraft.

By Robert W. Furry

To the millions of people who
visited the 1964-65 New York World’s
Fair, the numerous pavilions and ex-
hibits offered glimpses of the world
of tomorrow which will become reality
through the efforts of engineers. While
the Fair itself was a tribute to our
technological world, many visitors
undoubtedly overlooked the engineer-
ing present in the many rides, exhibits
and displays.

One such engineering effort was the
design and development of the
Futurama II ride in the General
Motors pavilion at the Fair. Visitors
to -this pavilion boarded a ride which
carried them through scenes demon-
strating how technology will make life
better for man in the future. To engi-
neers of the GM industrial design
studios fell the job of creating the
system to transport the visitors.

In October 1960 this group was
selected through competition open to
nationally prominent architectural
and exhibit ﬁrms. The basic criteria
for their assignment was to design and
develop a ride -that would safely and
reliably carry 65,000 people per day
ov-er a path 1,850 ft. long. A study
of many commercially available con-
veyor systems showed that each had
one or more objectionable features.
Among these were excessive noise,
jerky operation, poor speed regulation
and questionable safety provisions.

In addition to conveyor systems,
other methods of propulsion were con-
sidered, such as monorail, air—sup—
ported vehicles and linear electric
traction devices. In each case, either

24'

     Futuram a   I I

excessive power requirements, incom-
patibility with basic ride design cri-
teria, or high cost ruled them out.
The problem ﬁnally evolved into one
of developing an entirely new pas-
senger conveyance system that would
embody the following features:
' C-omplete operating safety
° Quiet, smooth and reliable
operation
' Ultimate speed regulation with
provision for varying speed
Ease in adjusting or take-up of
any developed slack as in the
case of driveline conveyors
Flexibility to negotiate turns of
a given radius and various
degrees of climb and descent
' A drive mechanism not to ex-
ceed given parameters dictated
by 'purely aest-hetic considera-
tions and kept to a workable
minimum
' Maximum passenger carrying
capacity -over a given track
length
Reasonable economy in con-
struction, operation and
maintenance.

The path of the ride was established
as a closed loop with a pattern of
turns extending over various eleva-
tions. After the ride path was estab-
lished, a proposal for a steel roadbed
structure that would support rolling
loads over a maximum clear span of
thirty feet was approved. This led to
the consideration of an in-the—ﬂoor
type of conveyor. Several factors, in-
cluding the problems of chain wear
take—up, ride smoothness and noise,

ruled out the possibility of using com-
mercially available chain conveyors.
As a result of the problems associ-
ated with conventional conveyor sys-
tems, the novel con-cept of a vertical
belt friction drive was developed. The
ride conveyance system incorporating
this drive principle is best described
as consisting of the following:
° Roadbed structure, or the ride
track
° Driveline
’ Drive and braking drive
assemblies
Electrical control system
° Passenger seat and chassis
assemblies
' Sound system
Moving belt walkways for load-
ing and unloading passengers.

Ride track. A typical cross section
of the ride track, approximately
1,850 ft. in length and forming a
closed loop with a number of turns
and varying elevations, is made up of
two parallel 18-in. steel I-beams
spaced 44 in. apart. The beams are
covered by a 1/4-in. steel plate with a
continuous center opening. The
I-beams are joined at approximately
7—ft. intervals by cross members. The
continuous -center opening of the
track is formed by four steel angles
that support and guide the driv-eline.
These are imvbedded into and rein-
forced by the track structure.

The track elevation differential is
35 ft. 10% in. with turn radii of 28 ft.
and 32 ft. and minimum and maxi-
mum ascent and descent angles of 7

degrees and 7 degrees 12 minutes,
respectively.

The track structure is supported at
the base by vertical and s-teel columns,
or frames, resting on the ‘base concrete
floor at the lower levels and the build-
ing structure at the upper levels. The
track support structure is isolated
from the building structure by sound
and vibration insulating material.

Driveline. The driveline of the ride
is a closed loop assemlbly approxi-
mately 1,850 ft. long. It consists o-f
463 eight-wheel -master carriers spaced
4 ft. apart and an equal number of
two-wheel idler carriers spaced mid-
way between the master carriers. All
carrier wheels hav-e either neoprene
rubber or urethane plastic tires to
reduce contact noise.

The master and idler carriers are
interconnected by adjustaible draw-
bars with a spherical bearing at the
master carrier end. This allows hori-
zontal and vertical motion, but does
not permit any changes in the 4 ft.
nominal pitch of the driveline. The
possibility of telescopic action in case
of driveline separation is eliminated.

From the center of each master
carrier a steel post projects upward
vertically t-hrough the center opening
of the track. These posts serve the
double function of towing and guiding
the 463 t’hree—passenger seats of the
ride. Attached to the bottom of the
carriers, in a vertical position, are
sections of fabric reinforced rubber
belting, 1/2 in. thick, 7 in. wide and

the total lift load of the ride. This
load was equal to the product of the
total rise in the ride path and the
combined total of live and dead loads
per ft. of ride, neglecting friction.
This product equalled 8,200 1b., which
was rounded to 9,000 lb. for design
purposes.

Using a design safety factor of
eight, all driveline components were
designed and selected to withs-tand a.
maximum pull of 72,000 lb. A section
of driveline was subjected to and
withstood a dynamic reliability test
of three times its normal servive, or
equivalent to a tes-t duration of
750,000 cycles.

Drive and braking. The drive as-
sembly consists of twin 230—volt d-c
motor-reducer combinations, each
rated at two hp. creating a total of
four hp. per drive assembly. Each
combination drives an endless posi-
tive-drive cog belt at a speed of
123.5 ft. per min. The motor-reducer
combinations are located directly op-
posite each other, separated by the
1/2-in. thick driven belt attached to

25

the bottom of the driveline. T-he ﬂat
sides of the two positive-drive cog
belts run in pressured contact with
the driven belt, thus transmitting
driving power to it by friction. The
contact pressure ‘between the belts is
maintained by the application of ad-
justable spring pressure radially to
one of the cog belts through its three
pressure pulleys. This pressure acts
against the oppositely placed pulleys
of the other driving belt. The drive
assemblies impart a speed of 1.4 mph
(123.5 ft. per min.) to the driveline.

A backst-opping clutch is included
in each drive assembly to prevent roll-
back of the driveline when it is
stopped. This clutch also permits free
passage of the driven belt through the
drive assembly, should any one drive
become inoperative.

The braking assembly is similar in
construction to the regular drive as-
sembly except that each motor is
wired to provide dynamic braking for
reduction of drawbar tension on the
downgrade. No clutches are used.
The braking drives are driven by the
driveline, which causes their motors
to act as generators. A resistance
bank dissipates the generated power.

elevation.

Electrical control. Main drive power
for the ride is provided by a 240-kw
d-c motor-generator set. A standby
motor-generator set is used alter-
nately. This generated d—c power is
fed into the main control panel for
distribution to the individual motor
circuits. The main electrical control
station consists of three panels lo-cated
in the ride control room at the 31-ft.
elevation. The panels continually in-
dicate the operation of drive and
brake assemblies, the two moving belt
passenger loading and unloading walk-
ways, and the motor-generator sets.

Ride speed is controlled by regulat-
ing the armature current in the drive
motors. This speed is finitely variable
to a maximum of 1.5 mph, although
normal operation calls for 1.4 mph.

ﬁeld windings is used to trim each
drive for pulling its share of the load.
A Selsyn Control system, with its
signal generated by the moving drive-
line belt, regulates the ride speed with
an accuracy of 0.3 per cent. The
moving belt walkways and the ride
are synchronized to move at the same
speed.

The operator at the control panels
monitors the over—all operation of the
ride, and is the only person able to
start it. The ride may be stopped,
however, by actuation of emergency
stop buttons located strategically
within the reach of authorized
personnel. The operator also serves
as a central link in the inter-com-
munication network connecting all
drive locations, ride service areas and
ride guard stations.

' Passenger seats. The 463 three-pas-

senger ﬁber glass seats, designed by
the styling staff, are spaced at four-
ft. intervals on the ride. Each seat
has three separated high backs in
which the sides of the head rests are
formed inward enclosing individual
speakers for the ride sound system.
Passenger seating areas are separated
by a slight ridge eﬂect for individual
comfort. Arm rests are provided at
the sides of the seat.

Each seat, set on a “/+—in. thick
carpeted platform, is bolted through
rubber bushings to the steel chassis.
The front and rear edges of the plat-
form are concave and convex, respec-
tively, to maintain a «constantly closed
ﬁt during turns. A ﬁber glass toe
board at the front of the platform
serves as a foot rest and as a cover
projecting over the narrow opening
between platforms.

The chassis is a welded steel chan-
nel frame riding on two plastic tired,
castered wheels. Two steel side mem-
bers of the chassis frame extend and
converge forward of a rectangular
base to form a slightly downward
sloping triangular connecting point.
Attached to the apex of this triangle
is a rubber mounted spherical bearing
that connects to the vertical post of
the master carrier and is contained
by a pair of retainer collars on the
post. This front connection is used
to pull the chassis. Lateral guidance
for the chassis is provided by two
thicknesses of 1/2-in. rubber belting,
slotted longitudinally, and attached
to the chassis with the center of the
slot at 4:8-in. behind, and slightly
above, the front connection. Thus,
each vertical post of the driveline
master carrier, having a nominal pitch
of four ft. is used to pull one chassis
and guide the one ahead.

Sound system. After comparing sev-
eral sound reproducing media, optical
sound ﬁlm, similar to that used for
motion picture sound tracks, was
selected as the reproducing medium
for the Futurama ride. Sprocket
driven optical sound ﬁlm offered ex-
cellent sound response characteristics
in addition to the prime advantage
of precise, synchronous speed control.
Another determining factor was the
very low rate of ﬁlm wear, which is
possible because the sound exciter
and sensor units do not touch the
ﬁlm as it passes through the sound
pickup section of the playback unit.

The Cronar, Mylar—base, 16-mm
ﬁlm "travels at 7.2 in. per see through
the pickup heads in one direction for
one ride cycle and in the reverse
direction for the next ride cycle. This
avoids unnecessary wear which would
be caused by rewinding after each
cycle.

Stereophonic sound is recorded on
four tracks on the 16-mm ﬁlm, two
tracks for each direction of ﬁlm travel.
Cueing of the stop posi:tion, which
also is the start position for the op-
posite direction soundtrack, is accom-
plished by inserting metal rivets
through the ﬁlm to operate micro-
switches. When the ﬁlm stops at the
end of a ride cycle, it automatically

sound start switch mounted on the
car is closed as it passes over a
stationary cam bar placed on the
ride path at the sound start point of
the ride cycle.

The original music accompanying
the narration was recorded stereo-
phonically, then mixed with the bin-
aurally recorded narration and
recorded on two tracks (right and
left) on 35-mm sprocket driven mag-
netic sound ﬁlm. The magnetic re-
cording then was used to produce an
eight-tracked optical negative sound
image on 35/3Q—mm sprocket driven
photographic ﬁlm. prints
made from this negative were split
into two 16-mm copies for use in the
reproducers.

Each of the 463 three—passenger
seats for the Futurama ride was de-
signed to include six speakers
mounted within the ﬁber glass seats at

Positive

ear level. Each passenger is provided
with a two-speaker private stereo
listening area. These speakers are
positioned and operate at an optimum
sound level to provide comfortable
listening and still not disturb pas-
sengers in adjacent cars. This is nec-
essary since a six—second time
diﬁ"erential in the sound program
exists between succeeding three-ear
groups in the ride line.

The three—in. diameter speakers are
secured by screws inserted into ﬁber

glass tapping blocks cemented to the
inner skin surface of the seats. Per-
forated trim plates are installed over
the open speakers. The space required
for a sound chamber behind each
speaker was obtained by shaping the
rear skin of the seat shell assembly.
A wooden baffle is cemented in place
to separate the right and left stereo-
phonic sound Resonance
damping is provided by partial pack-
ing of the area with sound absorbing
paper. Speaker wiring is installed
within the seat, exiting through a
hole on the underside of the seat
directly over the junction box. into
which it is connected.

signals.

Failure de'l'ec'l'ion. To assure reliable
operation of the sound units, and to
avoid the possibilit_v of "passengers
lacking the narration during their
ride. a method of monitoring the
operation of the sound reproduction
was devised.

The principle used in the monitor-
ing s_vstem is the detection of a low
frequency audio signal recorded on
the program sound ﬁlm for approxi-
mately 10 seconds of running time.
This signal is recorded imiiietliately
before the program material for detec-
tion prior to the start of the ride
cycle. The positive detection of this
signal indicates a normal operating
condition to the detector. Since the
sound reproducers and the detectors
travel with the moving cars, however,
the problem of transmitting this in-

27

formation to the service area is com-
plicated. To overcome this problem,
the detector system includes detector-
signal devices, one of which travels
with eac hcar that carries a sound
reproducer unit, and a stationary ex-
citer-detector unit positioned at a
point on the ride track prior to the
start of the ride program.

Each moving d-etector-signal device
consists of an electronic circuit to de-
tect a 50-cps signal generated by the
ﬁlm movement, a photoelectric cell, a
solid state relay to operate simulta-
neously an exciter lamp, and a small
motor to rotat-e a light chopper disc.
These components are packaged in a
small metal case installed within the
leg of each seat carrying the sound
reproducer. Three small holes in the
leg provide access for light beams
which activate t-he detector system
and for a manually operated plunger
to reset the relay circuitry.

The basic com-ponents in the sta-
tionary unit of the monitoring system
include an exciter la-mp aimed so that
it will target on the photoelectric cell
of the moving detector-signal unit,
and a photoelectric cell positioned so
that it can detect a light signal from
the traveling unit. This stationary
portion of the monitoring system is
mounted adjacent to the track at a
position immediately forward of the
sound start position.

Since the failure of a sound unit to
start functioning at the designed
sound start point might be caused by
115-v power feed failure as well as by
other reasons, the traveling unit is
self-powered by nickel-cadmium re-
chargeable batteries. The current
drain from the batteries during normal
operation is extremely low. The only
signiﬁcant current ﬂow takes place
when the monitor is activated for a
short interval by a malfunctioning
reproducer.

In normal operation, the circuitry
of the detector in the moving car ac-
cepts the 50-cps signal genera-ted by

Failure detector

the moving ﬁlm and rejects the mo-
mentary pulse from its photoelectric
cell as the car passes the stationary
exciter lamp. If for any reason the
ﬁlm should fail to start, the absence
of a 50-cps signal will allow the photo-
electric cell pulse to activate the
silicon- solid state relay, which closes
the circuit to the exciter lamp and
chopper motor. The chopper pulses
the exciter lamp beam for more
efficient detection. As the car carry-
ing the non-operating reproducer
passes the stationary photoelectric
cell, the pulsed light beam from the
car energizes the stationary monitor-
ing circuit which operates an alarm
to alert personnel in the service area.
VVhen the car with the malfunctioning
reproducer approaches the passenger
unloading area, the lighted exciter
lamp serves as a car identiﬁcation
signal. The sound unit is replaced
quickly, after which the manual reset
plunger on the detector unit is de-
pressed to restore the circuit to its
monitoring position.

Moving walkways. Two moving belts
are provided — one for loading pas-
sengers onto the moving ride and one
for unloading them. Each belt is 66 in.
wide, with an exposed wid-th of ap-
proximately 60 in. The belts have
longitudinal gro-oves 3/16 in. wide and
‘/4 in. deep with tapered sides. Floating
combplates, located at entry and exit
ends, mesh their ﬁngers into the
grooves of the belt.

The loading and unloading belts
are 69 ft. 9% in. and 61 ft. 3% in.
long from comb plate, respectively.
Each belt unit includes a sin-gle

closed balustrade located on the right
side in the direction of belt travel.
The speed of these units is synchro-
nized Wit-h the speed of the ride, and
the edge of ‘the ride seat platform
slightly overlaps the moving belt.
Passengers take their seats with no
perceptible awareness that they are
stepping from one moving surface
onto another.

Elaborate safety precautions make
it impossible for any jamming to occur
at the ﬂoating combs. Should anyone
decide not to board the ri-de, he may
simply proceed to the discharge end
of the moving belt and step off. At
the unloading area, passengers leave
their seats and are carried by the
belt toward the exit.

Safefy provisions. The foremost
consideration in the design of the ride
was to provide maximum passenger
safety. One of the unique features of
the ride is that the seat carrying
chassis will n-ot leave the track if
driveline separation should occur for
any unforeseen reason. Driveline com-
ponents were subjected to exhaustive
endurance and reliability tests and
were designed to exceed the maximum
recommended factor of safety.

The service walkway along the en-
tire length of the ride connects to an
adequate number of passageways that
lead to building exits for egress of
passengers in case of an emergency.
During such time, the ride would stop
and a system of overhead and foot
lighting would automati-cally and in-
stantaneously be switched on. Guards
are posted strategically along the ride
to aid passengers in the event of an
emergency. Automatic sprinklers and
smoke detectors are installed through-
out the exhibit area for ﬁre protec-
tion. A complete intercom and pub-
lic address system provides full com-
munication at all times.

Since the idea for the ride mecha-
nism was entirely new, a thorough
test of the concept was carried out on
a prototype test tra-ck near the GM
Technical Center. The track consisted
of a loop 308 ft. long with two straight
sections, an elevation differential of
10 ft. and two semicircular spiralling
sections of 32 ft. radius. Incline and
decline angles along -the spirals of 10

degrees and 5 degrees 41 minutes, re-
spectively, were used to study the
effect on passenger comfort while
negotiating slopes.

The test track operated under
maximum load conditions for nearly
500 hours, and was used effectively to
test such aspects as the mechanical,
electrical and smoothness features of
the ride. In addition, various con-
ﬁgurations of passenger seats and
seating arrangements were tried and
tests were conducted on viewing re-
actions to a number of scenery sets
that were erected.

Moving belf walkway

In checking the mechanical opera-
tion of the test ride, measurements of
the tension loading in the driveline
under various conveyor loads and
drive conditions were made, as well as
measurements of bending stresses in
the swivel-type couplings connecting
the driveline components. The re-
sults of these tests were effectively
used in perfecting the ﬁnal drive as-
sembly and driveline designs. As a
further step in assuring a reliable ride

operation which would run 12 hours
per day, seven days‘ per week and six
continuous months per each of the
two operating seasons, a test ﬁxture
was designed and built for a test pro-
gram of driveline components to
determine their adequacy and reli-
ability. These tests resulted in modi-
fications of the ﬁnal design and parts
fabrication.

The advance preparations for the
Futarama ride were pr-oven successful
when the ride was installed, ahead of
schedule, in the GM pavilion at the
World’s Fair site. During its ﬁrst sea-

son of operation, the ride ‘proved to be
the most popular attraction at the
Fair. It handled crowds in excess of
its rated capacity of 65,000 people per
12-hour day by operating on slightly
longer schedules. The reliability of
the ride has been proven by its record
of no down time during operational
hours, and by the minimum amount
of waiting time for passengers despite
its record of carrying more people
than any other Fair ride.

Glass road—A glass road, developed
by General Motors is used in studies
of Wheel dynamics. The glass road,
20 ft. long and located in the center
of a straight, level road, is constructed
of two, 2-ft. by 10—ft. laminated tem-
pered pla-tes 1%.-in. thick. Each plate
is made of two, 1/2-in. thick tempered
plates covered with a %—in. tempered
plate that acts as a top surface to
protect the structural glass from
being accidentally scratched and
shattered during a test run. The
plates are strong enough to support
medium-heavy trucks. The coefficient
of friction of the glass approximates
that of dry pavement.

The glass is laid ﬂush with the road
ov-er a pit 18 in. deep. A glass mirror
covers the bottom of the pit. The
image of the contact patch -of the tire
can ‘be observed from above ground
camera is aimed at the image of the
contact patch as seen in the mirror.

The studies conducted with the aid
of the glass road provide information
useful in analyzing wheel dynamic
characteristics, such as tire excited
shimmy. The glass road is also poten-
tially useful in other tire-to-road con-
tact studies, such as severe braking,
acceleration and conering.

Super plane — Sub-Plane is a vehicle
that w-ould be equally at home in the
air and underwater. The unique sub-
mersible seaplane is a vehicle that
could approach its target area with
the speed of a water-based aircraft,
then dive under water to pursue its
target with the stealth of a submarine.

The preliminary Sub-Plane con-
ﬁguration recommended by Convair
has a seaplane-style hull and conven-
tional wing and tail. The three jet
engines, two mounted on struts above
the wing and the third contered on
top of the hull aft of the Wing, would
be sealed prior to submerging. The
wing engines would be used for take-
off only. Flight cruise thrust is fur-
nished by the hull engine and a re-
tractable hydro-ski aids take-off.

If controlled sinking is desired, a
high density aircraft must be used
and all excess volume must be ﬂooded.
Structural components that would be
ﬂooded on both sides, such as wing,
tail, and hull, preferably would be
made of high-density material.

Although the concept of such a
craft is still in the drawingboard
stage, General Dynamics states that
the submersible seaplane is “feasible,
practical and well within the state of
the art.”

20.000 leagues. High compressive
strength and modulus of elasticity
have made glasses and ceramics at-
tractive for the construction of deep
subm-ergence vehicle hulls. The
Benthos vehicle was designed to pro-
vide a hydrodynamically shaped hull
for rapid descents to and ascents from
the ocean ﬂoor. Since 100 pounds of
instrumentation is generally consid-
ered as the average weight of an all-
purpose instrumentation package, the
length to diameter ratio of the vehicle
was selected with the aim of giving
the vehicle a payload capability be-
tween 100 to 150 pounds with a re-
maining buoyancy of 70 to 20 pounds.
Such a buoyancy is thought to be
sufficient to give the vehicle anywhere
from 25 to 5 knots ascent velocity
with its payload.

The hull of Benthos is made up of
four glass sections and one metallic
stabilizer section. The assembly of the
hu-ll in several glass sections permits
easy accessibility to instrumentation
components and makes the fabrica-
tion of the hull from glass a much
easier and cheaper process. With the
advent of the Benthos, groundwork
has been laid for further models of
glass or ceramic deep submergence
oceanographic vehicles.

An Indian with young ideas managed to swap his 40-year-
old squaw for two 20-year-old maidens at the annual

tribal powwow.

The next year he returned and asked for his former wife

back.

“Me not w-ired for two 20,” he explained.

A group of N.R.O.T.C. midshipmen were gathered dis-
mally by the rail after their ﬁrst -day at -sea. An old salt
joined them and inquired sarcastically, “What’s the

matter, Jon-es, got a weak stomach?”

“Hell no,” gasped Jones, “I’m throwing it as far as the
others.”

Millionaire: “Marry my daughter on an engineer’s salary?
Ha —— Young man, you couldn’-t keep her in underwear.”

well yourself.”

A man walked into the restaurant and left the door open.
A big fat man called out: “Shut the door. Were you
brought up in a barn?” The man closed the dood, sat
down, and began to cry. At this, the fat man looked
uncomfortable and went over to the sorrowful one. Said
he, “I’m sorry, I didn’t intent to hurt your feelings.”

“I’m not crying because you hurt my feelings,” was the
reply, “but the fact is, I was brought up in a bran and
every time I hear an ass bray, it makes me homesic .”

A young man contemplating matrimony wanted to pro-
pose and didn’t. know how, so he went to his dad for
advice.

“Well, son,” -said the old man, “I don’t know that I can
help you much. With me and your Maw it happened
one Sunday evening, when yer Maw and me was just a
talkin’ along and purty soon yer Maw leaned over and
whispered in my ear and I said, “Th-e hell you are,”
and the next day we were married.”

“Our tests indicate that you are pregnant,” said the
M.D. to the naive miss seated in his ofﬁce. “There is
every indication that you are going to have twins.”
“But how can that be, Doctor?” protested the girl. “I’ve
never been out on a double date in my life.

The boys over in the Electrical Engineering lab have
developed a new whiskey test which runs like this:
Connect 10,000 volts D.C. across a pint of ﬂuid.

If the current jumps it, the product is poor.

If the current causes a precipitation of lye, tin, arsenic,
iron slag, and alum, the whiskey is fair.

If the liquor chases the current back into the generator,
it’s darn good stuﬁ.

An M.E. we know broke his arm ﬁghting for a woman’s

“No,” came the reply from below, “but there’s a

AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER

ILLUSTRATED BROCHURE "YOUR CAREER."

Kodak

wants two kinds of mechanical engineers:

1. burning with ambition to reach manager’s status
as soon as possible

 

o College grade-point average on the high side in
technical subjects

Secretly admitted to self at certain point in undergraduate career
that the scholars way of life is for other people but smart emmglz
to have kept were! from the pro fc.r.s'0r.s‘ who are, (1 fler all, .S'(.‘/I()/(H'.Y.
Diploma in, secret out.

. Seeks prosperous, highly diversiﬁed employer

Competitive personality who wants to play on a strong, long-
lasting team in the big leagues.

o Unafraid of choices and changes

With a mechanical engineering background, we might ﬁnd him
adept at keeping a troupe of welders happy on a new petro-
chemical project, or designing a new type of machine for the
lithographic industry, or organizing a small laser—manufacturing
department, or operating a large magnetic tape plant, or proﬁt-
ably piloting one of the world's major industrial corporations.

2. able to hold a manager’s job in time but sure he
wouldn’t like it

 

o College grade-point average on the high side in
technical subjects

Why not‘? The subjects were intrinsically interesting, and most
of the professors proved to have a clear understanding of them.

- Seeks prosperous, highly diversified employer

To practice modern mechanical engineering—this is not 1936——
onc needs scope, Contacts, and resources.

o Unafraid of choices and changes

With a mechanical engineering background, he might choose to
take a high leap over the interdisciplinary wall into solid state
physics, pull some excessively generalized equations out of a
journal that others on the circulation list quickly glance at and
pass along. Six months later he may have a new composition of
matter on board a ship bucking the solar wind to Mars.

What is said here about mechanical engineers is equally applicable to chemical

engineers and electrical engineers. Our expansion rate now demands technical

people who, at the one extreme, are still fresh from the classroom with its

beneﬁts and, at the other, have had ten years of practice in their professions and

are now ready to select a lifetime employer. We offer a choice of three communi-

ties: Rochester, N. Y., Kingsport, Tenn., and Longview, Tex. We earnestly

solicit serious and honest self—descriptions addressed to:
