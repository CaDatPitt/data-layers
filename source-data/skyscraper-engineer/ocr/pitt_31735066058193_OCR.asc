Through the use of industrial television, Pratt

what happens as big jet engines are run under
abnormal conditions. Without personal hazard,
they can see inside the test cell from any loca-
tion in the plant.

On their television screens they can observe
the action of linkages, controls and other parts.
Even infra-red characteristics not visible to the
human eye can be studied.

But to do this, many technical problems had
to be solved. For instance, commercial equip-
ment had to be modiﬁed in many ways to
operate under abnormal temperatures and in
hazardous atmospheres. Soon a further develop-
ment will permit remote traversing of the
camera and adjustment of lenses.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Zatazmut

With this issue, the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER starts its third full
year of publication. It is still very young but has good possibilities
for becoming one of the nation’s best college technical magazines.
The staff this year is competent and willing to work and will keep the
magazine in step with the renovations and growth of Pittsburgh,
Pitt, and the Schools of Engineering and Mines.

And speaking of the Schools of Engineering and Mines, it is our
contention that one of the better things to happen for the student
interests was the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER. There is something else
though, which this school seriously lacks—an “Engineer’s Week.”
This “week” is a traditional March affair in engineering schools
throughout the west and mid-west, and it centers around St. Patrick’s
Day; for St. Pat, the patron saint of engineers, is considered the
world’s ﬁrst engineer due to his feat of driving the snakes out of Ire-
land. If Pitt should get something going on this, it will be the college
furthest east to have such a tradition.

Last year a group of students and faculty members tried to do
something about it. We never did have the “week” or even a “day,”
but many of the wrinkles were ironed out and this year it should be-
come a reality.

Let me quote an editorial written by Art Hershkowitz in the
January, 1953 SKYSCRAPER.

“One must is an open house for high school students and their
parents(?). In conjunction with this, alumni and parents of the
undergraduates should also be invited. A second must is having the
Engineering and Mines Dance during this period (done so), pos-
sibly on St. Patrick’s Day. This can be made to have even more
appeal by conducting a contest for an Engineers Queen (done so).

“There are many other possibilities. High on this list is inter-
departmental activities(?), athletic or otherwise. Here also can be
the annual banquet of the E. & M. Alumni Association( ?) .

“O-ur pet idea is a Senior Banquet( E‘). This banquet, open only to
seniors and faculty, will honor those graduating. At the present,
three or four departments hold their own banquets separately but
they are exceedingly willing to combine and hold a huge one. This
dinner could bring a sense of camaraderie as nothing else possibly
could . . . ”

How are we going to get all this? It’s up to the E. & M. Associa-
tion, various committees of representatives from each seminar, the
faculty, the alumni, and the students themselves. Let’s talk it up.
Let’s let everyone know that “we want an Engineers Week.”——_].F.

PITTSBUEGH—ENGINEERING CENTER OF THE WORLD

Pittsburghers are getting used to announcements of
colossal changes in their city. The work of the Allegheny
Conference on Community Development and the many
civic—minded citizens who have cooperated with them
have attracted the attention of the world in changing
Pittsburgh from the “Smoky City” to the worlds’ clean-
est industrial metropolis. Slums and dilapidated business
sections have been cleared to make way for the sky-
scrapers of the Gateway Center and the beautiful parks.
Although many announcements of these developments
have been made in newspapers and magazines, the
changes are so rapid in Pittsburgh that it is impossible
for anyone not located here to conceive of the renais-
sance which has taken place.

Previously, the central oﬂices of Pittsburgh’s indus-
tries were located in New York but now they are rapidly
being moved to Pittsburgh and the changes in thought
as well as physical changes which are taking place here
are so broad in scope that they are difficult to follow.
Not the least of these was the recent announcement that
a move is under way to bring the national offices of the
various engineering societies to Pittsburgh. The move was
prompted by a committee of the Engineers’ Society of
Western Pennsylvania of which Mr. A. C. Monteith,
vice president of Westinghouse, is chairman. This com-
mittee has the cooperation of the Allegheny Conference
and considerable ﬁnancial backing is already assured.

About ﬁfty years ago Andrew Carnegie, who derived
his fortune from the Pittsburgh area, gave one million
dollars for the construction of a sixteen story building
in New York City to house the national ofﬁces of four
engineering societies. Since that time many other profes-
sional organizations have been formed and the four orig-
inal societies have so expanded that they are all renting
additional space outside of the original building.

What would be more ﬁtting for the consolidation of

Higher transmission voltages have created a need
for new knowledge about lightning surges. Pictured is
a 2000-kv surge generator erected by the Westing-
house Electric Corporation for an experimental

all the engineering society headquarters in a building
located in the Gateway Center. Pittsburgh is so centrally
located that the engineering population center of the
nation is only one hundred miles west of here. It is only
an overnight train ride or a two-hour plane trip from
the majority of our industrial cities. It not only has the
plants and central oﬂices for many steel companies but
also is the home of the Aluminum Company of Amer-
ica, Westinghouse, Gulf Oil, and Koppers, not to men-
tion many allied equipment and engineering companies.

Pittsburgh is also fast becoming one of the largest in-
dustrial research areas in the world. Mellon Institute,
Westinghouse, Gulf Research and Development, U. S.
Steel, Jones & Laughlin, Allegheny Ludlum, Heppenstall,
and many other companies such as Koppers, Mine Safety
Appliances, the Atomic Power Division of Westinghouse,
have research facilities in a concentration not to be found
elsewhere.

Some of the societies which might move their head-
quarters here if the Pittsburgh offer is accepted are:
American Institute of Chemical Engineering
American Society of Civil Engineers
American Institute of Electrical Engineers
American Society of Mechanical Engineers
American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical

Engineers
Institute of Radio Engineers
Association of Iron and Steel Engineers
American Iron and Steel Institute

In addition, Pittsburgh has two excellent engineering
schools and the advantages to the schools of moving the
national headquarters of the societies here are too nu-
merous to list. However, it might be pointed out that
along with the societies, the largest and best engineering
library in the world would be moved here. Also, there
is no reason why such societies as the American Society
for Engineering Education and the Engineers’ Council
for Professional Development should not be moved here
also. The latter is the accrediting body for engineering
schools. The former was originated and located for some
twenty years at the University of Pittsburgh and moved
to Northewestern only about ten years ago.

Like other members of the ESWP Committee, I shall
make every possible effort to bring these things to pass.

Industrial Television

By ARTHUR I. HERSHKOWITZ, EB. ’53

Television eyes prove to be a lifesaver for industry.

Industry is ﬁnding that television is more than just
boxing, comedians or Captain Video; that it is not just
a means of entertainment and advertisement. It is in-
vading mills, factories, railroad yards, research labs and
power houses across the country and its function in these
places is of an informative nature. Industry has come to
the realization that television will soon be a very signiﬁ-
cant part of its everyday activities.

For Industrial Television (ITV) to fulﬁll the job put
to it, several features must be kept in mind in the design.
Things such as: simplicity of operation, dependability,
freedom from excessive service requirements, long life,
satisfactory performance, reasonable cost, and portability
will make it the success that it can be.

Since it is still comparatively young, most of these
factors had to be compromised some degree in order for

THE AUTHOR

Art Hershkowitz graduated from Peabody High School
in 1949, and entered Pitt’s Electrical Engineering De-
partment that fall. As an undergraduate he was one of
the most active engineers in
school. Vice-President of Phi

a practical ITV system to be obtained. This comprom-
ising has caused two basically similar yet essentially differ-
ent systems. The first, the Utiliscope system of the Dia-
mond Power Specialty Corporation of Lancaster, Ohio
emphasizes simplicity and long life at the expense of
portability; while the second, the ITV-5 system by the
Radio Corporation of America concentrates on sensitiv-
ity and portability at the expense of simplicity in ad-
justment.

Basically, an ITV system consists of three pieces of
equipment; the camera, the power supply, and the
monitor or viewer (see Figure 1). Because the power
supply is connected to both the camera and the monitor
by coaxial cable, this unit becomes a closed circuit there-
by eliminating snow, distortion and bouncing pictures.
Also, since it is a closed circuit system and no signal is
telecast except through the coaxial cable, a license to in-
stall or operate the unit is not needed.

The camera is the most important part of the system.
It must be compact yet durable enough to stay in adjust-
ment regardless of temperature variations between 0 and
150 degrees Fahrenheit and regardless of vibrations far
in excess of normal conditions. On top of this, the image
dissector (camera tube) must have a reasonably long
life since it is the most expensive item used. R. C. A. has
perfected their camera to the point where it contains
only three tubes and is as sensitive as a large commercial
camera. This camera has been reduced in both size and
weight to a point where it is about twice as long as a
16mm. movie camera and weighs only 71/; pounds. In
fact, the camera uses a 16mm. lense, sits on a 16mm.
tripod and is almost as portable as a 16mm. camera.

Diamond Power, on the other hand, has sacriﬁced this
portability and sensitivity for long life in their dissector
tube. Their “cold cathode” tubes installed in 1947 have
been operating continuously since then and are still pro-

ducing pictures identical to those produced when ﬁrst
installed. This 54,000 hours of continuous service easily
surpasses any other life expectancy.

The power supply has a two-fold purpose: ﬁrst, sup-
plying power to both the camera and the monitor, and
second, amplifying the picture signal from the camera
and transmitting it by coaxial cable to the monitor. The
power supply operates from a 115 volt source, using only
230 watts.

The monitor, although similar to a home television set
in purpose, is vastly superior in design. Reliable results
under industrial conditions necessitate a rugged mechani-
cal design, quality of components, and an electrical safe-
ty factor far superior to the home receiver. Yet, the most
sensitive ITV tube used, R. C. A.’s “Vidicon,” is less than
half as sensitive as the commercial image orthicon camera
tube.

Most IT V systems consist of these three separate units;
however, the R. C. A. ITV-5 set-up combines the power
supply and the monitor into a single unit about the size
of a home table-model television set. This advantage in
portability is balanced in that the farthest the unit can
be free from the camera is 500 feet. The Diamond Utili-
scope set-up allows the monitor to be an additional 1500
feet from the power supply. Of course, the system used
would depend upon the speciﬁc requirements of the situ-
ation as to distance and portability.

But no matter which system is used, ITV has been
found to perform worthwhile functions. It has reduced
accidents and operating costs considerably and has pro-
vided eyes for direct observation where previously this
was not possible. Probably the biggest application of ITV
is in the steel industry. At the Geneva Steel Company in
Utah, a battery of 4 ITV cameras and monitors helps
feed four—ton slabs into three reheating furnaces, where
they are heated to 2300 degrees for rolling into plate or
hot rolled strip. One workman now handles all three
furnaces with the aid of ITV. And at the Gary, Indiana
sheet and tin mill plant of U. S. Steel, one camera records
the progress of 395 feet of ﬁery red steel strip as it trav-
els from the ﬁnishing stand to the coilers (ﬁgures 2 and
3).

Another application is found at the Timken Roller
Bearing Company in Ohio, where a control operator, by
the use of ITV, views tubes at a cool-furnace entrance so
that pile-ups which might impair the control of uniform
heat loss can be eliminated without the necessity of sta-
tioning an extra man at the furnace entrance. But ITV
is not limited to one ﬁeld for it has found wide applica-

tion in the power industry. As a typical example, tele-
vision is empolyed to transmit the water level indication
from a gauge at the drum level of a large boiler to the
operator’s position, a distance of from one hundred to
two hundred and ﬁfty feet. Thus the operator has remote
vision since he is visually at the gauge position.

The problem of remote vision is a large one in this
industry. When the line-of-sight was obstructed, mir-
rors were used; but, since the image of the object de-
creases considerably as the distance increases, this method
had its limitations. In some cases the gauge images, trans-
mitted by the mirrors, were so small because of the dis-
tance that the water level could not be clearly seen. To
combat this problem, remote position Indicators were
then used to provide water level information. The pos-
sibility that such devices would lose their calibration to
the extent of indicating water in the boiler when there
was none was considered very slight especially if ‘two of
these Indicators were used simultaneously to check each
other. Even so, in 1945 a large power company in the
South spent one quarter of a million dollarseon boiler
repairs because both indicators had shown water within
a drum that was actually empty. Television is the answer
here for it could never show a water level when none
existed.

Other power plant uses include smokestack observa-
tion (ﬁgure 4) and remote vision into boiler furnace
interiors.

Besides these industries, the railroad yards have also
had a taste of ITV and it may soon become standard
equipment with them. In September of 1952 the Balti-
more -& Ohio Railroad had a demonstration installment
of the ITV-5 system in their Chicago freight yard. Then,
instead of six men walking through the mile-long yard
checking freight car numbers, one man sat in a central
office with four monitors to check the numbers. The
equipment was so sensitive that it worked in any weather
by day and under ﬂood lights at night. The yard super-
visor also had two cameras mounted on towers so that he
could scan the entire yard. This new system can cut down
on track accidents, accelerate yard operations and in-
crease efﬁciency generally. It may also be used for in-
spection work on cars and locomotives and loading oper-
ations at big terminals.

The constantly increasing number of applications in-
dicates that television has made its entrance into industry
and will in time become a basic part of it. ITV has ful-
ﬁlled the omnipresent need for eyes where man was here-
tofore limited because of distance and danger.

Special Feature

Trainin

Editor’s Note: This is the first article of a special feature
series on the industrial giants of Pittsburgh and the engineer-
ing opportunities oﬂered by them. We are carrying this series
in an effort to let our students know more about their oppor-
tunities in Pittsburgh—the future engineering center of the
world. This story is a first hand account written by Bud
Spangler, our Features Editor, who took part in the Westing-
house Training Program this past summer. Other companies
to appear in future issues are: U. S. Steel, Pittsburgh Plate
Glass, Alcoa, Koppers and others.

When the current series on some of Pittsburgh’s indus-
trial giants and the engineering opportunities offered by
them was still in the conjecturing stage, the Westing-
house Graduate Student Program was one considered by
our staff to be a “must” in our coverage. Since 1900,
when the program started, Westinghouse has taken many
steps to adapt its training facilities to its increasing
growth and more specialized needs, with the result that
today the program offers opportunities that will be an
excellent talking point when the class of 1954, on a
nation-wide scale the smallest in years, is being besieged
by industries short on technical students.

Before beginning this resume, we would like to point
out that we are not particularly trying to sell Westing-
house or any of the other companies which will be cov-
ered. In recent years much attention has been brought
to the large corporation training programs, and it is
often a serious problem for the new graduate to decide be-
tween the continued schooling, and, to a certain extent,
the anonymity of the large corporations and the immedi-
ate engineering experience of the smaller companies. In
this series some of your questions may be answered.

First, one item must be considered-—that the Westing-
house management has an interest in the welfare and
progress of the individual. This is somewhat difficult to
reconcile with our ideas of the cold business world. At
ﬁrst just a little skeptical, the new engineer gradually
comes to realize that if he takes a little initiative in try-
ing to continue his schooling and advance his interests,
there are counselors willing to assist at every step and
there are educational opportunities coordinated with
each phase of his intellectual growth.

The reasons behind this are partly due to the dynamic
nature of the corporation itself (by statistics the fastest
growing of the select “billion dollar club” of industries),

wherein the top echelon of management sees and recog-
nizes the importance of giving every opportunity pos-
sible to the energetic, ambitious engineer. In Westing-
house’s case, there is not only the problem of replacing
the old executives but of building entire organizations in
their expanding new ﬁelds of atomic power and propul-
sion equipment. Their method of achieving these ends is
embodied in a comprehensive training and management
development program that is unique in American in-
dustry.

would be complete without a wor
four story educational center built in 1950 near the inter-
section of the Penn-Lincoln Parkway and Ardmore
Boulevard in Wilkinsburg. The focal point of the train-
ing program, the center is completely air conditioned
and has, along with classrooms and a library, many facili-
ties for recreation and leisure, including pool tables, table
tennis, television, dancing and outdoor basketball and
softball. Here the trainee is introduced to Westinghouse,
and the company has taken care to make the introduc-
tion as pleasant and painless as possible.

The ﬁrst few days of the nineteen week period known
as basic training consist of a series of lectures by members

of the educational staff in which the broad company
policies, the chain of command and other aspects of the
corporation are explained to the newcomers. During the
ﬁrst few weeks of the summer, upwards of ﬁve hundred
graduates and one hundred summer students report, and
after each group has been lectured, the graduates are
given short assignments in one of the plants throughout
the country until the start of product engineering school
the beginning of July. During the nineteen week period,
three assignments of four weeks each and six weeks of
P. E. school are completed by the trainee, the order of
events being determined by when the graduate reports to
work and the starting dates of the periodic P. E. schools.

The product engineering school at Westinghouse may
be described as being a concentrated dose of the company
itself. During the course of the school, department man-
agers and supervisors lecture on every line of apparatus
made by Westinghouse and the how and why of its work-
ings. Reference books are distributed the day before the
oral lecture and there is a question and answer session
afterwards. Several hours of study each day are generally
all that is required, and time is allowed for the necessary
skull work.

An important feature of the school is that four gradu-
ate engineering credits may be obtained from Pitt for
attending the classes if the student ﬁnishes in the upper
60% of the class.

A high point at the end of P. E. school is the manage-
ment-leadership discussion in which a panel made up of
top Westinghouse executives answers questions on phases
of the eorporation’s general policies, expansion, promo-
tions, and opportunities. This discussion serves to answer
some of the questions that have come to mind from the
previous lectures and studies, and helps to point the
graduate in the right direction within the corporation. It

also affords an opportunity to meet personally the top
management of the company.

The conclusion of P. E. school is a sudden parting of
the ways for the several hundred technical students
enrolled (a similar course starts the next week for non-
technical students), because during the weekend they are
off to begin or ﬁnish their basic assignments in the plants
determined in previous interviews. At the conclusion of
each assignment a new order is received and the gradu-
ate reports to his assignment the following Monday.

It must be emphasized that basic assignments are not
heavily technical, as their purpose is primarily to acquaint
the graduate with different phases of the company’s
activities. In this manner he can form deﬁnite opinions
which will be used as the basis for choosing what are
known as his specialized assignments. This second phase
of activity begins with an interview at the educational
center during which the graduate and the interviewer
decide upon the nature of work (engineering, manufac-
turing, research, sales, etc.) that the graduate will enter
at Westinghouse. Then a series of three six-week assign-
ments of a technical nature in the chosen ﬁeld are ar-
ranged and the student is ready to enter what should be
by now the narrow ﬁeld of his own capacity and choos-
ing. Thus each successive step in the young graduate’s
career to date has been made with the thought of guiding
him to a position that is both useful to the company and
satisfying to the engineer. This thought is the guiding
principle under which the graduate student program
operates at Westinghouse.

For a relatively small group, there are additional op-
portunities for betterment in the thirteen-week electrical
and mechanical advanced design schools. These are also
conducted in the educational center and consist of a
rough thirteen weeks of advanced fundamentals taught
by some of the top men at Westinghouse. The diﬁieulty
and value of the course may be attested to by the fact
that Pitt regards the electrical courses as twelve gradu-
ate credits and the mechanical courses as ten. This means
that a June ME or EE graduate may be half-way to his
master’s degree at the end of his ﬁrst year with Westing-
house without going outside the company for his gradu-
ate credits. Candidates for the design schools are picked
on the basis of their scores in the graduate record exam
(an aptitude-achievement test given the ﬁrst week of
employment), P. E. school and college grades and
activities. .

The remainder of the credits needed for an advanced
degree may be obtained through the Graduate Study
Program set up in cooperation with the University of
Pittsburgh in 1927. Courses are taught in the late after-
noon and evening by both the regular resident faculty of
Pitt, and by Westinghouse scientists and engineers who
have received appointment to the faculty of the Gradu-
ate School of the University. In an effort to encourage

Q Here, at Muehlhausen Spring Division of
Standard Steel Spring C0., precision-rolled
U-S-S CARILLOY Spring Rounds are coiled
without centerless grinding. CARILLOY Rounds
have minimum decarburization, and they cost
less to use.

 

C At the Gary Works of United States Steel.
this precision mill rolls CARILLOY Coil Spring
Rounds with extreme accuracy. Tolerances are
half of standard: .004” on the diameter, in-
stead of the usual .008", and only .006” out
of round, compared to .012” on ordinary rolled
liars.

N the early days of the develop-

ment of coil springs for front sus-
pensions of automobiles, the only
steel that was available was an ordi-
nary hot—rolled bar from which as
much as .035” of metal per side had
to be removed by grinding to insure
freedom from harmful seams, pits,
and decarburization. This cost
money, was wasteful and time con-
suming.

We at United States Steel felt
there was a better way of doing this,
so we put our best engineers on the
problem.

Using a mill especially equipped
for the purpose, they devised an in-
genious method of producing hot-
rolled bars to eliminate harmful de-
fects and most of the grinding ex-
pense. Rolled by this method to half
the standard tolerances, with half
or less the amount of decarburiza-
tion, these CARILLOY Precision
Rolled Coil Spring Rounds can be

   

used “as furnished” or with only a
small amount of centerless grinding.

This exclusive development has
paid off in two ways. It has paid off

Editor’s Note: This is the second of a special feature series
on the engineering opportunities offered by some of the in-
dustrial giants of Pittsburgh. The National Supply Company
is the world’s largest manufacturer of oil field equipment and
machinery.

The National Supply Company could be called the
property man of the oil industry. Behind the scenes of
the dramatic oil production of the last 50 years, the
company has provided the rigs and tools needed by the
producers. With its headquarters in one of the new Gate-
way Center buildings of Pittsburgh, it is the largest man-
ufacturer of oil ﬁeld machinery in the world.

The company is also the largest distributor and store
keeper for the oil industry, with 117 supply stores in the
United States and Canada. These stores sell the com-
pany’s own line of products, as well as those of hundreds
of other leading manufacturers. The company has sales
ofﬁces in more than 60 cities and a world-wide export
organization with head offices in New York.

Aside from its oil ﬁeld business, The National Supply
Company produces and sells steel pipe and electrical
conduit; diesel, gas and dual fuel engines; ordnance ma-
terial; heavy machinery and other industrial products.

It is one of the largest users of steel in the world and
owns six manufacturing plants: two in the Pittsburgh
area, two in Ohio, one in California and one in Texas.

Of course, such a large industry requires engineering
personnel of all types. George B. -Cushing, Sales Promo-
tion Manager of The National Supply Company, and
head of the company’s training programs, told us:

“We always need good engineers. A good man, no
matter what his inclinations, will usually ﬁnd his place
in our far-ﬂung net of production units and sales and
service points. A creative earthbound type may end up in
the Product Engineering Department of one of our
plants. The adventurous type has ample opportunity to
move about and visit strange places. In our company’s
long association with the oil industry we have experi-

20

  

enced many an adventure and seen a lot of excitement.”

The National Supply Company does not conﬁne its
recruiting program to graduates of a particular limited
engineering ﬁeld. Although the company’s engineering
activity is primarily along the mechanical line, it hires
young engineers of every type of background and trains
them for the job for which they appear best suited.

The openings available are in the ﬁelds of designing,
production, services and sales. However, the company’s
personnel policy draws no strict dividing line between
these ﬁelds. A versatile and able engineer may, in the
course of his career, ﬁnd himself changed from one ﬁeld
to another.

Designing work includes developing and modifying of
National products as well as experimental research and
ﬁeld development work. A National designing engineer
is not always conﬁned to the drawing board. He may be
asked to go out to the ﬁeld to test new or improved prod-
ucts. His work may eventually, lead him into production
or ﬁeld service.

Production may entail work at any of the compan

manufacturing plants in all phases of operation such as
shop practices, production methods and control, inspec-
tion and plant research. A production engineer may also
conduct ﬁeld tests. His knowledge of a particular product
may qualify him as a sales engineer specialist for this

product. Within a plant, an engineer may rise to super-
visory responsibilities and plant management. _

Service and sales engineering is ﬁeld work. A service
engineer will not only serve the customers but also assist
and train the company’s sales Stall". A sales engineer will
supervise the installation of new equipment in the ﬁeld
and service the equipment in operation. With increasing
experience he may develop into sales management re-
sponsibilities. '

We asked Mr. Cushing what, in his opinion, makes
The National Supply Company particularly attractive
to a graduate engineer, for whose services so many other
companies are competing.

“I believe,” he said, “the most important point is that
a young man joining us feels we are genuinely trying to
broaden his knowledge of our industry and business be-
fore he gets buckled down to a job. With everybody
clamoring for specialists these days, it is more satisfying
for most people to be able to acquire a general back-
ground knowledge rather than be limited to a restricted
ﬁeld.

“The results seem to bear us out. More than eighty
per cent of the men who have participated in our yearly

training programs have remained with us. We feel that
this is an excellent average and proves that people are
happy with us. As a matter of fact, out of a total of about
10,000 employees in all our branches, there are over 1600
with more than 25 years of service.

“Furthermore, as far as personnel is concerned, most
of our units are small. A close personal contact can be
maintained and the individual will not get lost in the
multitude. An employee feels that his personality is re-
spected and that he is not just another number in our
organization. We develop his possibilities by knowing him
intimately. We offer a large variety of work and places
of work, and we can, as a rule, satisfy even the more un-
usual ambitions of the young man who wants to make
a career in industry.”

The National Supply Company training program for
college graduates lasts about a year. The trainee is not
tied down to a job while he learns. All his activities dur-
ing that time are aimed at increasing his knowledge. He
receives a salary and his expenses are paid for the numer-
ous travels involved in his training.

The course begins with an assignment to one of the
company’s stores in the oil country where the trainee is
made familiar with the store operations and the use and

application of oilﬁeld equipment. Then follow discussions
in the general ofﬁces in Pittsburgh on organizational and
service functions. The program is completed by periods
of shop instructions at each of the company’s six manu-
facturing plants, where the men study the products, fa-
cilities, and methods of operation.

The management considers the training program as an
important company activity. Classroom instruction in
Pittsburgh is not left to an outside teaching staff, but is
conducted by company executives. The “faculty” is
headed by the president who tells of the company’s gen-
eral operations. He is followed by the executive vice
president and other principal executives and department
heads. The vice president in charge of manufacturing
discusses the manufacturing facilities and activities of
the company. The director of engineering lectures on
the technical development of the oil industry and on the
part played by The National Supply Company. Other
department heads describe sales, sales promotion, pur-
chasing, ﬁnancing, accounting, exports and every other
operation of importance to the smooth functioning of
the organization.

Top ofﬁcials at the Pittsburgh headquarters actively
follow the progress of the trainees throughout the pro-
gram. They review reports submitted by the people con-
ducting the training at the stores and the manufacturing
plants. At the end of the program each trainee is assigned
to the opening for which he has shown the greatest‘ ﬁt-
ness and inclination.

“By that time,” Mr. Cushing said, “a trainee is no
longer a stranger among us. He knows most of the com-
pany executives and a great number of employees of all
our divisions. This makes it easy for him to adjust him-
self to the job assigned to him. Also, we know him well
enough to offer guidance in adapting his aptitudes to
our business. We try to give him every help and encour-
agement and make him feel that his success is as impor-
tant to us as it is to him.”

The history of The National Supply Company is closely
linked to the history of the oil industry. August 27, 1859,
is usually recognized as the date when the ﬁrst oil well
of the world (at Titusville, Pa.) came in. Fifty years

MAINTENANCE INCENTIVES

By JOHN PEEBLES, I.E. ’53

What makes a man do his best——here is the way it’s done
in the maintenance ﬁeld.

Incentive, according to Webster, is “that which incites
or has a tendency to incite to determination or action.”
Incentive as used by the average workingman today has
a more useful meaning, it could mean one of the dozens
of methods of rewarding him for better than average
performance. This incentive might take the form of in-
creased pay, more leisure time, a more advanced position,
recognition among fellow workmen or any one of many
beneﬁts offered. Management may install an incentive
plan to increase efficiency, reduce overhead, reduce
waste or to prevent accidents; so we see that, depending
upon the reviewer and the effect desired, “incentive may
mean one or more of many related ideas.

The ﬁrst incentive plans were tried in France and Eng-
land long before they made their appearance in the
United States. These ﬁrst plans abroad were rather inac-
curate since the standards were set by either guessing or
bargaining. The ﬁrst system attempted in the United
States was the Halsey plan of 1890, which met with a
certain amount of success. Five years later Taylor’s, “A
Piece Rate System”, even without the support of stand-
ards, greatly aided the growth of interest in incentives
and made possible systems which were applicable to many
jobs. Since this humble start incentives have been one of
the most fertile ﬁelds of production improvement. A sur-
very made in 1940 by the National Industrial Conference
Board, showed that, of 2700 companies of all sizes and
types, 51% used incentives of one type or another. In the
manufacturing industries 75% of the companies used in-
centives. Until recent years incentive systems had been
limited almost wholly to production workers and direct
labor; but incentive systems are now being developed for

supervisors, inspectors, clerical workers and maintenance
men.

The usefulness of an incentive system for maintenance
is still looked upon rather dubiously by many supervis-
ors. The common attitude is “I suppose maintenance in-
centives will work in some industries, but they won’t
work in my plant.” Other of the more popular argu-
ments are: “My plant is too small”; “The work on our
company is different from day to day”; “Administration
costs of such a system would offset any gains”; or “It
just isn’t worth the effort.” The last statement is a good

. example of the deﬁnite advantages in a good mainte-

nance incentive system. These systems have been shown
to have reduced maintenance costs on an average of 33%
of the total maintenance payroll. Also, as with any suc-
cessful incentive system, maintenance men take home a
paycheck which is 20% to 30% fatter under a good
plan. Some of the indirect advantages are: improved
service; better methods and procedures; more positive
control; and more accurate estimating, planning and
scheduling.

Maintenance incentives will work for all types of in-
dustries regardless of the type of work performed or the
size of the plant. The only qualifying statement which
need be made is that the correct plan be used for the
particular industry involved. Some variation of the stan-
dard time system is applicable to almost all plants em-
ploying more than ﬁfty men. If the plant is starting from
scratch, that is, if no standards have been developed and
no system is now in use, less than ﬁfty men would make
this plan inadvisable since the costs of installation would
oﬂset any gains derived from the plan. Opinions vary as
to the groundwork which should be done prior to in-
stalling a new system. Some experts believe that before
installing an incentive system, better work planning and
scheduling, an improved control system, efficient stock
rooms and adequate tools should be provided. Opposed
to this point of view is, “Take what you have as it is and
do the best that can be done with it ﬁrst by incentives.
Invariably, other improvements will follow that step.”
Regardless of the method used, keep in mind that faith
in the system is one of the most important facets of
making a system work.

'Maintenance men who are unfamiliar with incentives
and standard times use different arguments. They fear
that workers may become time and money conscious and
forget about doing good work. Safety will suffer because
of increased emphasis on amount of work done. Then
too, they are afraid that some mechanic may get more
than his share of tough jobs which would cut down his
pay. According to safety Engineers incentive mainten-
ance men actually have a better safety record than those
not on incentive. Possibly this is because the incentive
workman is, of necessity, more alert and job conscious.

Dr. G. R. F itterer, Dean of the Schools of Engineering and Mines,
was born in Newark, Ohio in 1901 and now resides in Oakmont, Penn-
sylvania.

Upon receiving his Bachelor’s Degree in 1924 from the Rose Poly-
technic Institute, Dr. Fitterer accepted a position as junior metallurgist
with the Highland Iron and Steel Company of Terre Haute, Indiana.
In 1925 he left there for the Stanley Tool Works as Metallographer,
and in 1926 was awarded a fellowship at the Carnegie Institute of
Technology by the Mining and Metallurgical Advisory Boards of the
U. S. Bureau of Mines. This course of study was terminated with the
Master of Science Degree in 1927.

The same year he was employer by the Bureau of Mines as a junior
metallurgist and in 6 years advanced to associate metallurgist and head
of the department. During this time Dr. Fitterer attended the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and in 1930 received his Ph.D. in Metallurgical
Engineering.

In 1932 he put his accumulated knowledge to use to form the F itterer
Pyrometer Company, Inc. and engage in the manufacture of high
temperature pyrometers using carbon-silicon carbide.

Dr. Fitterer began lecturing at Pitt in 1931 and in 1938 was pro-
moted to full professor and head of the Metallurgical Department.
While serving in this capacity he performed such duties as: Director of
the Acid Open Hearth Association, Inc.; Supervisor of government
and naval research projects during the war; and consultant to various
engineering firms.

He has found time to have some 26 articles and books published,
two U. S. patents, and activities which include: American Society for
Metals; American Institute for Mining and Metallurgical Engineers;
American Society for Engineering Education; American Association of
University Professors; British Iron and Steel Institute; Masons; Theta
Xi, social fraternity; Sigma Xi, honorary science research; Sigma Tau,
honorary engineering; and Sigma Gamma Epsilon, honorary Mines
and Metals fraternity.

In 1950, Dr. Fitterer was named to head the Engineering Research
Division of Pitt, and in August of 1951 was appointed Dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines.

His most recent accomplishment was the presentation of two papers
as the U. S. Delegate to the United Nations Economic Commission for
Latin American on Iron and Steel Making held in Bogata, Columbia
in October of 1952. These papers were on the Economics of, and the
Products and Speciﬁcations of, the Acid Open Hearth Process.

28 THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

we 6.2.-mzz, gm/a

By Professor W. I. Short

Editor’s Note: This article is based on
a paper given by Professor Short, of the
Civil Engineering Department, at the
Relations with Industry Meeting held in
Gainesville, Florida in June, 1953. It
was presented in conjunction with the
American Society for Engineering Edu-
cation Convention.

In September, 1952, a new form
of cooperative engineering education
was started in the Schools of Engi-
neering and Mines of the University
of Pittsburgh. The Undergraduate
Plan, involving Cooperative Indus-
trial Scholarships, which is entirely
new, is a Pittsburgh story because it
is only in such industrial centers that
it could be successfully conducted.
It presents an outstanding opportu-
nity to qualiﬁed students who are
interested in engineering, but who
are ﬁnancially unable to attend col-
lege, or who would prefer to obtain
industrial experience simultaneously
with an engineering education.

At the meeting where the “Under—
graduate Work in Industry Pro-
gram” was conceived, it was decided
by representatives from Pittsburgh’s
industries and the University that the
program would be one that led to a
Bachelor of Science degree in 
neering, and that no person wou
be admitted to the program without
ﬁrst having the requirements for ad-
mission to the Schools of Engineer-
ing and Mines, University of Pitts-
burgh ‘and be an employee of a par-
ticipating com any.

Through a Iii:-arrangement of the
six available curricula, the basic
science and engineering courses are
studied ﬁrst. This re-arrangement co-
incides with the required prerequi-
sites for each course in sequence and
after having received about one-half
the credit requirement for the de-
gree, the student is awarded a Certif-
icate in Engineering Fundamentals
and Work Experience. Before the
certiﬁcate is awarded, the employer
certiﬁes the student’s work experi-
ence as an engineering aid. The Cer-
tiﬁcate courses provide the student
with English, mathematics, chemis-
try, physics, engineering drawing,
theoretical and applied mechanics,
as well as some of the ﬁrst semester

OCTOBER, 1953

 

junior engineering courses. As these
men are employed in the engineering
departments of their companies, it
was felt necessary to move them
along as rapidly as possible in their
science and engineering courses.

Though they are awarded a certiﬁ-
cate to indicate that this has been
done, it should not be interpreted
that their course is ﬁnished, as it is
believed the Bachelor of Science de-
gree is the ultimate goal of each
candidate.

  

 W. Short

The Cooperative Industrial Schol-
arship is handled on a tuition-refund
basis. At the completion of each
semester, the participating company
refunds one-half the tuition for
courses in which the student has
earned a “C” grade or better. At
the completion of the work required
for the “Certiﬁcate in Engineering
Fundamentals and Work Experi-
ence,” the company refunds the bal-
ance of the tuition in a lump sum.
The same procedure is followed if
the student is to continue for the
degree.

The time required to complete the
work for the Certiﬁcate is  years,
and to obtain the degree is 6% to 7
years. This time schedule is based
on the student’s working between 30
and 40 hours a week, and attending
classes a total of 12 clock hours a
week. The program can be complet-
ed in less time, should the company
release the student from work more
than eight hours a week.

The above plan was announced to
employees of the Westinghouse Elec-
tric Corporation and to the Union
Switch and Signal, and Air Brake
Divisions of the Westinghouse Air
Brake Company in August of 1952.

  

Six hundred employees showed in-
terest; over 200 submitted applica-
tions, of which 150 were accepted.

Ages of those accepted ranged
from 17 to 39 years.

Out of the 150 that started last
fall, 130 earned grades in both
courses that permitted tuition re-
funds. Several that did not earn re-
funds had to drop courses clue to
work requirements, and not for
scholastic inability. Some, though,
got in over their heads and did not
make good. As a group, the grades
were comparably high, indicating
that the nature of the program was
effective.

This fall the program has been
expanded. At the moment there are
twelve companies participating. In
addition to providing for presently
employed personnel, the participat-
ing companies have employed select-
ed high school graduates. These high
school graduates will work four days
a week and attend school two after-
noons and one evening a week. High
school principals and high school
counselor were acquainted with the
program through meetings with Dr.
G. R. Fitterer, Dean of the Schools
of Engineering and Mines, Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh. They, in turn,
screened their student bodies, with
the result that the companies had an
excellent group competing for their
available Cooperative Industrial
Scholarships.

In acquainting Pittsburgh indus-
try with this new Undergraduate
Program, we found that some com-
pany programs were already operat-
ing on a tuition-refund basis. How-
ever, they did not release the student
for day classes. These companies
have now adopted our program.

Companies in the program are
Westinghouse Electric Corporation
(Research Laboratory, Atomic Pow-
or ivision), Westinghouse Air
Brake Company (Union Switch and
Signal Division, Air Brake Division),
Pennsylvania Railroad, Mackintosh-
Hemphill Company, Mellon-Stuart
Company, The Hagan Corporation,
Joy Manufacturing Company (Re-
search Center, Elders Ridge, Pa.),
Pittsburgh Consolidation Coal Com-
pany (Pittsburgh Coal Company Di-
vision), the Trimble Company, Na-
varro Corporation, Mine Safety Ap-
pliances Company and Rockwell
Manufacturing Company.

Adding or subtracting, it’s still a big job.

Color transparencies and color prints today, are as
common as black and white negatives and prints were
before World War II. Almost every photographer has
used color ﬁlm at sometime or other. It is easier and more
convenient to use than black and white ﬁlms since all
the photographer has to do is put the ﬁlm in his camera,
expose it, then drop it in the nearest mailbox. In two
weeks or so he received his color transparencies or prints.
Easy-—but how does that color come about?

The colors in most of the color ﬁlms manufactured in
the United States are formed by a subtractive method
involving dyes in separate layers in the ﬁlm. Contrary to
this, the popular English color ﬁlm uses the additive

john E. Noll graduated from Homestead High School
in 1945. He received his Bachelor of Science in Chemis-
try from Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1948, and
his Master of Science from
the University of Pittsburgh
in 1951. He has worked at
Mellon Institute of Research
since 1947 except for two
years in the army where he
was assigned to the Biologi-
cal Warfare Laboratories of
the Chemical Corps. During
his time in service, ]ohn
taught a course in photog-
graphy at the post. There he

ess for Ansco Color Printon,
which cut the procedure

extensive research in pho-
tography during his spare

method in which the colors are permanently engraved
on the ﬁlm support. Each method has its own advantages
and disadvantages. _

The early types of color ﬁlm were all of the additive
type, the earliest commercial type introduced in the
1880’s, even though color photography was demonstrated
in 1857. Agfa, in Germany, and Luminere, in France,
introduced early color plates which were popular but
expensive. Not until Kodachrome came out in 1935,
was color made available to the “man on the street.”
Kodachrome, as well as most of the other color ﬁlms
available today, is the subtractive type, or a combination
of subtractive and additive types.

Subtractive color ﬁlms consist of several layers of gela-
tine on a transparent support. Each of these layers is
sensitized to a speciﬁc color and contains a coupler,
which on development, yields a color complementary to
the color to which that particular layer is sensitized. As
light passes through the processed film, components of
the light are subtracted leaving only the desired color to
pass through.

Ansco Color Positive Film is a typical subtractive type
of_ color ﬁlm. It consists of eight layers: a partially hard-
ened gelatine layer for protection, a blue sensitive emul-
sion, a yellow ﬁlter, a green sensitive emulsion, a red
sensitive emulsion, a binding layer, a support, and a anti-
halation layer. Each of the emulsion layers contain a
color coupler which will react with the oxidized form of
the paraphenylenediamine developer to form yellow,
magenta and cyan dyes respectively. If green light were
to fall on the ﬁlm, the first emulsion would be uneflected
since there is no blue light, the second emulsion would be
completely exposed, and the third emulsion would be
unexposed.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

The ﬁlm is ﬁrst developed in a metol hydroquinone
developer to give a negative silver image and destroy
the integral yellow ﬁlter. The ﬁlm is exposed to white
light to make the silver bromide remaining available
for development.

The second development is carried out in a para-
phenylenediamine developer, which, besides developing
the silver image, also forms the colors. Since there is silver
available for the development in the ﬁrst layer, the de-
veloper is oxidized and reacts with the color coupler to
form a yellow dye image. The same thing takes place in
the third emulsion layer with the formation of a cyan dye
image. The second emulsion layer contains no develop-
able silver and cannot oxidize the developer. Since an
oxidized developer is needed for color, no color can
form, so this layer remains clear. Following this develop-
ment, the ﬁlm is bleached and ﬁxed to remove all the
silver and leave only the positive dye images.

If white light were now to fall on the ﬁlm, the ﬁrst
(yellow) layer would remove the blue light, the second
layer would allow the red and green light to pass through
unhindered since it is clear, and the third (cyan) layer
would remove the red. Thus green light would be visible.
If the colors are not pure primary colors, each of the
layers would be affected to a varying degree, thus making
possible the rendition of different color hues.

This ﬁlm has the color couplers in each layer but this
is not necessary. For example, Kodachrome, when it ﬁrst
came out, required that the dye couplers be added dur-

ing the development process. This required considerable
care and control during the processing and prevented
amatures from developing it. Introduction of the in-
tegral dye coupler ﬁlms with their relative ease of pro-
cessing made available the processing to the amateur.

Although practically every nation in the world pro-
duces a color ﬁlm, they do so, usually, under the patents
of Kodak, Ansco, or Agfa.

Not all the ﬁlms are the subtractive type. Dufay_Cro_-
mex of England has long produced Dufaycolor which is
an additive type of color ﬁlm. Agfa at one time produced
an additive color ﬁlm but discontinued it in favor of its
subtractive type.

Additive color ﬁlms consist of only one emulsion layer
on a support which contains the three primary colors as
extremely small ﬁlters. Light passing through these ﬁlters
is ADDED together to produce the desired color.

Dufaycolor ﬁlm consists of four layers: the support,
the binding layer, the panchromatic emulsion, and the
anti-halation layer. The support is ruled into microscopic
areas of red, green, and blue. Light must ﬁrst pass
through this layer before reaching the emulsion.

If yellow light were to fall on this ﬁlm, it would pass
only through those areas transparent to yellow light.
Since red and green are transparent to yellow, the light
would pass through these areas and expose the silver

Here is a diagram of a typical subtractive type of
color ﬁlm. Light falling on the multilayer ﬁlm exposes
the silver halide in the layer sensitized for the particular
color of light being used (see A). Development converts
the exposed silver halide to free silver (see B). The ﬁlm
is re-exposed to make available the remaining silver
halide which is developed in a color forming developer
to form silver and the colors in each layer (see C). The
silver is bleached to a hypo soluble salt which is washed
out by ﬁxing to yield only dye colored layers (see D).
White light passing through the ﬁlm yields only the
color of light that exposed that particular area of the
ﬁlm.

emulsion behind them; but blue, being opaque to yellow,
stops the light and leaves the area behind these ﬁlters un-
exposed. The ﬁlm is developed in a high energy developer
to give a negative image with silver deposited behind the
red and green ﬁlter areas. The silver is then bleached to
a light insensitive hydro-soluble silver salt and the ﬁlm
exposed to white light to make the silver bromide avail-
able for development. During the second development,
all the remaining silver is developed. The ﬁlm is then
ﬁxed to remove the soluble silver salts. This leaves a de-
posit of silver behind the blue ﬁlter areas but none be-
hind the red and green ﬁlter areas. Light will now pass
through the ﬁlm at the red and green areas forming
yellow by addition. The density of the silver layer per-
mits variations in the hues of light seen, by controlling
the amount of light passing through each ﬁlter.

This type of color ﬁlm is easily processed and requires
no special chemicals. Unlike the subtractive type of color
ﬁlm, errors in exposure and processing can be corrected.

One large company now has on the market a combina-
tion of the additive and subtractive types in a single ﬁlm
to decrease the bulk of the ﬁlm, obtain the advantages
of both types, and reduce production costs.

The colors reproduced by most of the color ﬁlms are
very close to the natural colors although they appear
more brilliant to the eye in a color transparency. This is
caused by the small arc the reproductions subtends with
the eye.

Color ﬁlms have advanced considerably during the
past eight years and will probably advance even more
during the next eight. It is not in the realm of fantasy
that a single emulsion will be able to reproduce all the
colors with a minimum of processing difficulties. Until

then, just drop the ﬁlm in the nearest mailbox.

WESTINGHOUSE TRAIN EES

Several 1953 graduates of the Pitt
engineering school are now enrolled
in the Westinghouse Electric Cor-
poration Training Program. These
include Bob Atkinson and Bill Shirey
of the mechanical engineering de-

All ﬁve of these spring graduates
are now completing their basic as-
signments at various Westinghouse
plants.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

It took 100 years of engineering

See that tiny speck of oxide on a hair-like
wire? It’s called a thermistor, and
it’s the ﬁrst practical thermally sensi-
tive resistor. It’s so sensitive it will
measure temperature variations
within one-millionth of a degree. As
a circuit element and control device,
this small, stable and rugged unit
has a place in a variety of electrical
circuits.

Although the thermistor is the smallest
and, in appearance, one of the simp-
lest devices made by Western Elec-
tric—manufacturing unit of the Bell
Telephone System—it was more
than 100 years in the making.

Back in the 19th Century—some time
before Western Electric was founded
in l869——Michael Faraday studied a
curious thermally sensitive resistor
material similar to that used in 20th
Century thermistors. As Faraday
and others after him discovered, the
trouble with making effective use of
this material was that different units
made by what seemed to be the
same process, showed large variations
in their behavior. The problem of
how to control the amount of im-
purities present in the material was
ﬁnally solved a few years ago by our
research team mates at Bell Tele-
phone Laboratories.

 

At Western Electric’s Allentown (Pa.)
Plant hundreds of minute thermistor
components are electrically tested and
sorted every day. The basic component,
an oxide, has a large negative temper-
ature coefficient of resistivity.

 

A UNIT OF THE BELL SYSTEM SINCE 1882

0CTOBER,1953

once beyond the laboratory stage,
Western Electric’s engineers tackled
the job of mass-producing the hard-
to-handle oxides. After many trials
they got a pilot line in operation——
then a full scale production line
through which compressed powders
of thermistor material could be sin-
tered into a strong, compact and
homogenous mass. Today reliable
thermistors are being made in many
shapes and sizes——small beads, rods,
discs, washers — to meet varying
circuit and design problems. To
make this possible, Western Electric
engineers had to ﬁnd new ways to
apply a slurry of oxides on wire; new
ways to extrude and mold oxide
mixtures.

At every turn, the thermistor has pre-
sented fresh challenges to our engi-
neers. Engineering is like that at
Western Electric—where technical
men of varied skills pool their knowl-
edge in a constant search for new
and better ways to do things.

The thermistor takes many forms de-
pending on the resistance and power-
handling capacity needed in a particu-
lar circuit.

further schooling and advanced degrees, the company
refunds one-half of the student’s tuition at the successful
completion of each course leading to an advanced de-
gree, and the other one-half if and when the degree is
conferred. In recent years this program has been ex-
tended to include ﬁfteen other schools throughout the
country.

Another plan introduced by Westinghouse is their
Summer Student Program. Under this program, upwards
of one hundred undergraduate (usually three-year men)
engineering students are selected from schools through-
out the country and given assignments in their selected
ﬁelds of engineering. Along with receiving some good
engineering practice, the summer student attends the
Friday Graduate Student Club meetings and some of
the more important lectures. It is an excellent opportun-
ity for the undergraduate to get an inside look at West-
inghouse without committing himself to employment
after graduation. As is done in the graduate program,
the student is required to send in progress and interest
reports on his work, and his immediate superiors are
requested to send in evaluations of his work, interest,
personality, appearance, etc.

Along the social side, the Graduate Student Club ful- ‘

ﬁlls a need that is a really important item for young
graduates new in Pittsburgh. The club holds its meetings
every Friday morning and sponsors more specialized
groups such as the radio club, wives’ club, chess club,
AIEE, athletic teams and other activities. Ofﬁcers are
elected regularly and a usually good social program is
run off for each group of new students. Above all, it pro-
vides a_quick way for newcomers and their families to
meet other young people and make their stay in Pitts-
burgh more enjoyable. Each class, by the end of P. E.

school, has resolved itself into a pretty compact and
friendly group, and by the evening of the P. E. school
dance, many long-lasting friendships have been made.

In a group like this, the “jokers” in the crowd quickly
discover they are among true compatriots, and it is not
long before the serious study and learning is interjected
with a good brand of humor. Toward the end of P. E.
school, the more well-known of the student speakers,
upon being introduced, found themselves greeted from
the sound room with short, appropriate selections from
old Spike Jones records, and during the showing of a
movie made by General Electric, a large, disconcertingly
frowning portrait of George Westinghouse leaped from
a lantern slide from the wall whenever G. E. apparatus
or sales talk became apparent. These examples we be-
lieve are important, as they bespeak a good community
feeling and inward friendliness toward their employer.

You may wonder what type of engineers are eligible
for the Westinghouse program. The answer is practically
any kind of engineering degree can be utilized somewhere
within this huge, integrated industrial structure. Of
course there is a predominance of electrical and me-
chanical engineers, but there are many new ﬁelds opening
up in research and development. At present metallurgy
is coming into the spotlight and appears to hold the
answers to some of the industry’s most perplexing prob-
lems.

Opportunities? They lie in the expansion and research
of the company———which seems to be a sure bet—and the
individuals’ ability to make use of the facilities before
l'111’l’l‘. It appears that Westinghouse has spent quite a bit
of time and money to make these facilities for advance-
ment available——their utilization, however, remains a
function of individual personality and ability.

full bridge meter
movement

Problem . . . how do you engineer a 100,000 ohms per volt
sensitivity tester so that it will fit into a 7 inch case with a dial that

is practically as large as the case?

The Simpson full bridge meter movement has performed
exceptionally well for many years. This new challenge, however,
meant one thing—the compact meter movement had to be made

even smaller . . . more sensitive. *

A unique core type movement was designed by Simp_so_n
engineers. Its specifications for accuracy are so extremely rigid
that unusual production methods had to be devised to build these
core type movements in commercial quantities. Simpson engi-

neers did this, too.

Today, laboratories, manufacturers, schools, and television
servicemen have available to them a completely portable volt-
ohm-microammeter . . . an electronic tester so sensitive that
many of its 33 ranges are comparable in sensitivity to those of a
vacuum tube voltmeter. In addition, this unusual
eliminates practically all of the disadvantages of a VTV_M . ..
drift, tube replacement, warm-up time, resulting in necessity for

recalibration,—-no AC outlet or line cord required.

This is just one more example showing what creative engi-

neering can do to solve a problem.

answer is new ideas . . . young ideas. And just
as the ideas of young engineers of a decade past
helped perfect the plane you see above, so will
the ideas of today’s engineering students—your
ideas—perfect tomorrow’s F-???. That’s why
North American Aviation always has challeng-
ing career opportunities for bright, young
graduate engineers.

Today, North American is developing proj-
ects of a new era—aircraft, guided missles,

rocket engines, rockets, electronics, atomic
energy. If you’d enjoy the challenge of pioneer-
ing in these advanced ﬁelds, consider looking
to the future with North American when you
complete your engineering training. In the
meantime, feel free to write for information

GENERAL ELECTRIC
COMPARES FIREFLIES WITH
ELECTRIC BULBS AS LIGHT
SOURCE

Lightning bugs are eﬂicient pro-
ducers of light, but it would take
1000 to 2000 of them to illuminate
a room to the same intensity as the
light from one candle. This was been
revealed by General Electric lighting
research scientists after having meas-
ured the light output of numerous
ﬁreﬂies.

Using intricate laboratory appara-
tus, including a photometer and an
oscilloscope, they determined that
the average light output of all Cleve-
land ﬁreﬂies measured was only 6-
thousandths of a lumen, and that
the brightest produced 9-thousandths
of a lumen.

The lumen, it is pointed out, is a
standard measure of light. The 60-
watt inside-frosted bulb produces
835 lumens, and it would take more
than 137,000 average lightning bugs,
all ﬂashing simultaneously, to give
out as much light.

Their study also revealed the near-
est G-E electric lamp from a light-
output aspect to be the somewhat
brighter NE-2 glow lamp, used on
electric appliances, wall switch
plates, radios, and elsewhere, to in-
dicate that the current is “on” or
“OH.”

Unoﬂicially renamed the “ﬁreﬂy
lamp” as a result of the tests, the
tiny light source presently is being
recommended by G.E. for use on
portable table and ﬂoor lamps. Since
most modern living-rooms lack ceil-
ing lighting ﬁxtures, glowing switches

PROGR

on portable lamps will serve to en-
able persons walking into a dark
room to find the lamps easily and
quickly, it is pointed out.

“Fireﬂy lamps” lack the efficiency
of the nocturnal ﬂying insects, which
are believed to convert into light 98
per cent of the energy they employ.
However, they outperform the light-
ning bugs in other respects. They are
believed to be the world’s longest-
burning lamps, lasting more than
25,000 hours. They consume only
one-25th of a watt of electric cur-
rent, or just one cent’s worth a year.

Two, engineers point out, the glow
lamps are more dependable. They
burn whenever the portable lamp or
wall switch to which they are at-
tached is turned off, whereas the ﬁre-
ﬂy turns on its light at dusk only
when he is romantically inclined.

ALL-WELDED STEEL BRIDGE

Freedom of form previously avail-
able only with concrete, has been
achieved with steel materials in a
bridge spanning the Rio Blanco
River near Vera-Cruz, Mexico.

By applying welding techniques,
Mexican engineer, Camilo Piccone,
has projected a span with slender
arch ribs, free of cumbersome brac-
ing. The structure is based on a new
design conception by Thomas C.
Kavanagh, Head of the Department
of Civil Engineering of New York
University’s College of Engineering.

The ultra—modern “basket handle”
effect is heightened by the use of
color. Painters have daubed the

curved ribs orange and made the
horizontal tie-girders cherry red.
The bridge was opened last May and
motorists who inveriably stop to ad-
mire the striking architecture on
their first trip across the span have
created a minor trafﬁc problem.

The 250-foot long, all-welded steel
splayed-arch highway bridge accom-
modates three lanes of traﬂic. The
arch ribs are inclined and joined at
the center of the span. The resulting
space framework produces visually
interesting effects from different an-
gles.

Unconventional design in the Rio
Blanco bridge extends also to the
ﬂooring, where a diagonal gridwork
of ﬂoor beams has proved far more

HOW TO DESIGN
FOR LOWER
STRUCTURAL COSTS

ITH today’s accent on cost,

there is a promising future for
the designer who can simplify struc-
tural designs to save steel and con-
struction manhours. Such savings are
being realized every day by the use
of arc welding instead of riveting
in the construction of all types of
industrial plants, multi-story build-
ings and bridges. By eliminating
rivets and taking advantage of rigid
framing and continuous beam con-
struction, welded designs help to
offset the rising costs in labor and
materials.

Shown below is a typical example
of how full structural continuity
achieved through arc welding effect-
ed savings of $22,000 in the con-
struction of an 87,000 square foot
process warehouse. Arc welding
actually has saved 1.68 pounds of
steel per square foot. At $50.15 per
pound for fabricated steel, the sav-
ing amounts to $22,000 over the
cost of steel alone had riveted design

ééﬁ used.

In spite of the rapid progress
made in the construction field by
the welding industry, new develop-
ments are taking place every day
which are of prime importance to
the structural engineering graduate.
Latest information on welded struc-
tural designs is available in hand-
books and bulletins simply by writ-
ing to The Lincoln Electric Com-
pany, Cleveland 17, Ohio.

due to an almost complete lack of

type was introduced by Westing-
house in 1949.

The heart of this new welder con-
sists essentially of two parts: a three-
phase, full-wave selenium rectiﬁer
and a so called Transactor unit,
which is a combination three-phase
transformer and movable core- reac-
tor. Smaller, lighter, and more con-

two, three-phase laminated cores.

One is a ﬁxed core on which the pri-
mary and secondary coils are wound.
The other is divided into two parts——
a stationary core, and a movable
core. The legs of the movable core
are linked by the common secondary
and reactor winding.

Current is controlled by means of
a hand crank on top of the welder
which moves the movable core sec-
tion in relation to the Transactor
unit coils. The Transactor unit coils,
for the ‘first time in any welder, are
aluminum. Through proper design,
Class “B” insulated aluminum con-
ductors produce operating character-
istics equal to copper coils. They have
the distinct advantages of conserv-
ing critical copper and reducing coil
weight by one-half.

Although the use of aluminum has
been the major contributor to weight
reductions, (for instance, from 510
pounds to 4000 pounds on the 300-
ampere welder), certain design mod-
iﬁcations have resulted in decreased
weight as well as size reduction, sim-
pliﬁed construction, improved weath-
er protection, and better ventilation.

 

Courtesy Of Westmghouse

One of the many improvements in-
corporated into the new are welders is
a reduction in weight partly due to the
substitution of aluminum coils for cop-
per coils.

Overload protection guards this
new welder from damage when it is
over-loaded from operating at an ex-
cessive duty cycle or without the ven-
tilating fan. When the coils are over-
heated, a thermoguard which is
wound into one of the coils, closes,
activating a shunt-trip mechanism
which in turn causes a three-pole,
de-ion circuit breaker to open, tak-
ing the welder off the line. When
the coils of the Transactor unit re-
turn to a safe temperature, the ther-
moguard automatically opens and
the circuit breaker may be reset and
closed manually.

An exclusive control feature——arc
Drive Control——eliminates are short
outs during welding operations re-
quiring a short arc. Arc Drive Con-
trol supplies instantaneous current
surges when the arc begins to short
out, thereby clearing the short and
re-establishing the arc. The result is
superior arc stability with improved
weld quality.

Although the three standard sizes
of this new welder are 200, 300, and
400 amperes, Duplex models are
available in 300/600-and 400/800-
ampere ratings. Essentially two small-
er units mounted on a common bed-
plate and enclosed in a single case,
the Duplex unit can be used as a
single unit or as two units, each with
half the capacity.

Ease of maintenance is greatly en-
hanced by the degree of interchang-
ability of parts in all ratings. Virtu-
ally all the parts, with the exception
of Transactor unit coils and recti-
ﬁers, are interchangable. These in-
terchangable parts will also be com-
mon with those on a new line of a-c
welders to be introduced later this
year.

All changes have been made with
no sacriﬁce in efficiency and/or per-
formance. A glance at the accom-
panying efﬁciency curves shows the
efficiency of the new selenium recti-
ﬁer welder to be well above that of
the average motor-generator type
d-c arc welder.

Incentlves (Continued from page 22)

Good supervision is the answer to workers who forget
quality. As to the worker who continually gets the “tough
nuts,” he will be paid accordingly. To ﬁnd and accurately
account for the smallest difference between similar jobs
is the very purpose for which time standards have been
developed and they do just that.

Unions greatest fear of maintenance incentives is that
maintenance men will be laid off because of increased
eﬂiciency. Increased efficiency is certainly brought about
by incentive, but there is no need for layoffs, so unions
should be given that consolation. A factory is like a home
in that there are always things to be done. When main-
tenance gets caught up on their assigned duties there are
always those repair jobs that have been put off. Painting
and cleaning are always necessary somewhere within the
plant.

The only added cost of installing a maintenance sys-
tem is that of administration. This cost is usually from
3% to 7% of the total maintenance payroll depending
upon the type of system used and the factory conditions.
It is a common misconception that the control of quality
requires extra help. Effective supervision will catch and
remedy all sloppy work. Since maintenance methods and
operations change less frequently than production opera-
tions, maintenance time standards, once set, are more
stable and revision costs are low. A 33% of maintenance
payroll saving is not at all uncommon after the installa-
tion of an incentive system.

Maintenance incentive systems are practically “custom
built” to a particular shop in a particular industry so it
might be misleading to cite an example without men-
tioning that fact. Burlington Trailways, a nationally
known bus transportation company, recently innovated
a contest system to show maintenance that it too had
much to do with the safety record of the company. The
contests were four months long, thus keeping mainten-
ance on its toes continually and also giving everyone a
chance to be a winner. A “road failure” was deﬁned by
the contest rules as “Any delay of one half hour or more
that is attributed to a faulty mechanical condition of the
coach other than tire failure or running out of fuel.” The
contest rules were that whenever the company mainten-
ance shop average was above 80,000 miles per road fail-
ure every maintenance man would receive a sizable
award. For the highest shop a banquet was held, an addi-
tional cash prize was awarded and an attractive banner
was displayed within that shop. A large stuffed white
elephant was given as the booby prize. The results of
this contest showed a company wide increase of 35% in
trouble free miles. The plant average jumped from 67,-
396 to 90,725 miles per road failure. This plan aroused
interest, increased cooperation between maintenance men
and drivers and made money for both the employees and
the company. This is just one of many examples which
show that incentives for maintenance do work.

Good maintenance reduces unnecessary and costly
breakdowns and accidents. To get good maintenance
the maintenance man must be kept happy——most easily
accomplished by giving him more money. A maintenance
incentive plan should be a part of all Wage Incentive
Systems since it will do this. The installation of an incen-
tive system reduces to three basic steps. First determine
the system which is applicable to the particular situa-
tion, one which will beneﬁt both management and main-
tenance. Second, do a good job of selling the system.
Third, have faith that the system will work.

many types for many needs

In previous advertisements in this
series, the many advantages of the
Torrington Needle Bearing and the
proper procedure for its installation
and maintenance have been dis-
cussed. The DC unit type bearing
was used in these discussions be-
cause it is the Needle Bearing with
by far the greatest variety of appli-
cations throughout industry.

From the basic Needle Bearing
design, however, many modiﬁca-
tions have been made. The result is
a complete line of Needle Bearings
suitable for speciﬁc applications.
Although these bearings are all
different, each offers the advan-
tages which have made the DC unit
type so popular. They give the
highest possible radial load capac-

ity in a minimum of space; they are
light in weight, easy to install and
simple to lubricate.

How
your pipe dreams
may become

Lengths of Republic Electric W/eld Casing are rapidly joined together and lowered hundreds or
thousands of feet into an oil or gas well to line it with tough steel—to protect its walls against
the tremendous pressures that otherwise might cause collapse of the hole.

OU MAY NEVER DRILL for oil as a career.
Nevertheless, this pipe has a message for you.

Pioneered some 23 years ago by Republic, this pipe
is made by a process of electric resistance welding.
Flat-rolled steel, uniformly thick, with both sides
visible for inspection, is cold formed and electric
welded into tubular form. The resulting pipe is uni-
formly round, uniform in wall thickness and uniformly
strong throughout every inch of its structure. These
qualities have speeded installation and improved pipe
performance. Millions of feet of casing and tubing,
and thousands of miles of line pipe in service have
proved the dependability of the process.

You may be out of school for several years before all
the economic importance of these qualities have

become a part of your experience. At this point, just
consider this one fact about electric welded steel pipe:
it was developed by a producer of steel. Republic is
now the leading manufacturer of this type of product.
Republic also fabricates many other products from
steel—such as tubing, conduit, culverts, radio towers,
windows, oﬂice furniture, steel cabinets for kitchens.
It is a leading manufacturer of these products, too.

Your pipe dreams of success in industry are more likely
to ﬂow with realities if you associate with a dynamic
company. Some companies merely produce a material.
Wouldn't you be better off with a company that not
only produces a basic material, but also knows how
to design and fabricate its own product? That com-
pany really knows what it is making—and selling.
Such a company is Republic Steel.

later, oil was being drilled in many parts of the world.

At almost every place where oil was found, The Na-
tional Supply Company—like Kilroy—can claim to have
been there. If it was not present in name, one of the many
companies, which in the course of its existence have
merged with it, is almost sure to have been present.

The National Supply Company was ofﬁcially estab-
lished in 1894. By merger, reorganization and acquisi-
tion, the organization now incorporates about twelve
major companies whose histories go back to the very
beginning of the oil industry. The oldest member——now
the Spang-Chalfant Division—was established in 1828 at
Etna, Pa., as H. S. Spang & Co. to make farm implements.
In 1840 the company made the ﬁrst iron pipe west of
the Alleghenies. It became one of the earliest suppliers
of iron pipe to the young oil industry.

The ﬁrst supply store was opened in 1887 in Cygnet,
Ohio, by the Buckeye Supply Company, one of the
founding ﬁrms of National Supply. The oldest store still
in operation is at Butler, Pa. (opened in 1894). The ﬁrst
interests in California were acquired in 1902. The com-
pany’s engine division had its start in 1888 with the
opening of a small machine shop in Springﬁeld, Ohio,
turning out gas engines. A Toledo machine shop estab-
lished in 1870 became the ﬁrst company-owned plant.
It began by making steam ﬁttings and other plumbing
supplies.

Today The National Supply Company is organized
into four divisions: the Spang-Chalfant Division (tubular
products); Oil Field Sales Division; Engine Division;
and Export Division. The company is owned by about
10,000 stockholders and its assets amount to more than
$125 million.

The Future

Asked about the prospects for a young engineer plan-
ning to make a career with the company, Mr. Cushing
said:

“If you believe in the future of the oil industry, the
future of The National Supply Company is a fair bet for
any ambitious man. Just look at the ﬁgures: World crude
oil production outside the iron curtain countries rose
from about ﬁve million barrels in 1941, to over eleven
million barrels a day in 1952. Our sales in 1941, amounted
to about $90 million and rose to $213 million in 1952.

“In spite of all exploitation, known crude oil reserves
have been increasing. In the United States alone, they
rose from about 19 billion barrels in 1941 to over 27 bil-
lion barrels in 1952. This clearly refutes the gloomy fore-
casts occasionally made about the world’s oil supplies
coming to an end.

“We at the The National Supply Company are doing
our share to keep up with the progress of the oil industry,
and of the other interests we serve. We recently com-
pleted a $25 million plant modernization program. Dur-
ing 1952 alone, twelve new products were developed and
introduced to the market. A special diversiﬁcation pro-
gram is expanding the sales outside the oil country busi-
ness. A new manufacturing plant—-our seventh-——will be
erected shortly in Texas.”

The following are the existing six manufacturing
plants of The National Supply Company.

Ambridge, Pa. This Spang-Chalfant plant produces
drill pipe, casing and tubing for the oil industry, drill
collars, sucker rods and drilling accessories. Its annual
capacity amounts to about 336,000 tons of seamless steel
tubular products, 12,000,000 feet of sucker rods, and
60,000 feet of drill collars. (Continued on page 46)

Etna, Pa. This plant is located on the site of the orig-
inal Spang works established in 1828. It now produces
about 270,000 tons of welded pipe conduit each year.

Toledo, Ohio This is the first plant owned by the
original National Supply Company formed in 1894. The
plant now manufactures drilling rigs and pumps as well
as other equipment and machinery for the oil and gas
industry. In addition to its machine shop, the plant has
its own foundry facilities for heat treating and electric
welding, a chemical and physical laboratory and an
elaborate mechanical laboratory for product develop-
ment and testing.

Torrance, Cal. This is the largest completely inte-
grated machinery manufacturing on the West Coast. It
has three electric arc melting furnaces for the production
of steel, a steel foundry, a large forge shop, machine
shops, welding shop, and chemical and physical labora-
tories. The plant produces rotary drilling machinery and
other equipment for the oil and gas industry. It also
serves many other industries, manufacturing ordnance
material, aircraft parts, forgings, castings, and machinery.

Houston, Texas This plant is equipped for the manu-
facture of well head equipment and for the repair of
drilling and production enquipment. Facilities include a
general machine shop and an electric welding shop.

Springﬁeld, Ohio This plant manufactures both sta-
tionary and marine engines of the diesel, gas and dual-
fuel types in a range of 80 to 1750 horsepower. Facilities
include a complete and modern diesel research and test-
ing laboratory, an iron foundry, pattern shop, machine
shops and assembly floor. A large portion of the produc-
tion is sold to users outside the oil industry.

“Most trainees,” Mr. Cushing said, “are enthusiastic
about their oil country experience. Assigned to one of our
stores, they are near and on the ﬁeld of action. They see
the importance of the well assorted stock of equipment
and parts we hold for the operators. They accompany
our sales and service engineers, who are advisors, me-
chanics, engineers and salesmen all in one person. The
stores are our life lines.”

The National Supply Company operates 117 stores.
They vary from two-man operations to large establish-
ments with as many as 45 employees. Inventories vary
from about $15,000 to nearly $2,000,000, depending on
the needs of the area. Annual sales range from $75,000
to $15,000,000. Some of the products are of the dime-a-
dozen variety; others are worth several hundred thou-
sand dollars.

The company’s Export Division has oﬂices in Eng-
land, Switzerland, and Venezuela and maintains agents
in 17 other countries. The National Supply Company
has two wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries: The Na-
tional Supply Company of Venezuela, C. A. at Caracas,
and The National Supply Company, Limited, at Calgary,
Canada.

The company’s export engineers visit the remotest
parts of the world. On their own, far away from head-
quarters, they have to be the most independent and re-
sourceful of the company’s representatives. Dealing with
many different nationalities, they have to be tactful and
understanding.

Summing up, Mr. Cushing said: “At National Supply,
a man’s ability and ambition determine his future. He
will ﬁnd an open ﬁeld with us. He is encouraged and
assisted in his progress. We try to bring out his special
capabilities, and utilize his knowledge and skill to the
best of our mutual advantage.”

about Alnico Permanent Magnets

 

You will find Crucible Alnico Permanent Magnets in
products ranging all the way from cuff links to mag-
natrons. Here are just a few unusual applications in
which these magnets were used to simplify or improve
a product.

This is Warren, age 4, a cerebral .palsied youngster, using magnetic
toys in therapy-play.

Magnetic T03/S Cerebral palsied youngsters at the
Children’s Rehabilitation Institute, Cockeysville, Mary-
land, are unable to play with normal toys. Their lack of
muscular coordination and control, causes ordinary blocks
or toys to slip through their grasp and fall to the floor.
Crucible helped overcome this problem by imbedding
small permanent magnets in the toys. By using these
magnet-equipped toys on metal topped tables, the children
are able to control them much more easily.

 

The Children’s Rehabilitation Institute has pioneered
techniques to help these handicapped children gain
maximum muscular control and coordination. Expe-
rience at the Institute has shown that the use of mag-
netized toys helps develop coordination in hand and
arm use, and in grasping and releasing.

Cuff Links One manufacturer of cuff links had

 a happy idea. He replaced the stem with
a magnet assembly designed by Crucible
magnet engineers. The tiny, powerful
aspirin-sized magnets used, gave the ﬁn-
 ished product a holding force at the pole
plate as high as 80 ounces troy.

 

Enlarged cross section view of one cuﬂ link.

  for this instrument that transmits
written messages over wire, two
permanent magnets were being
used to match the electromagnetic
ﬁelds. Assembly time and unit
costs were high. Crucible magnet

Alnico; lower bar .

2nd magnet) 1170- two. Magnet costs were cut 50%

increased.

Bo\a/:j,, I‘.

Not long ago, one -of our city-bred
engineers was making a trip through
the country. As he passed a fertile
ﬁeld he spied an unusual sight--a
farmer helping a calving. Now our
engineer didn’t have the slightest
idea what was happening, and he
stopped his car to watch the spec-
tacle. He could tell that the farmer
was having an awful time assisting
the cow.

Presently he got out of the car,
approached the farmer, and said,
“Want some help?” And so, sweat-
ing and straining, he assisted the
farmer at the difficult task. Then at
last the calf was born.

Gratefully, the farmer accom-
panied the engineer to his car to see
him off. But hesitating, as he wiped
the sweat from his brow, the engi-
neer looked up and said, “Say, mis-
ter, just how fast was that calf go-
ing when it hit the cow?”

Men are what women marry.

They have two hands, two feet,
sometimes even two wives . . . but
never more than one idea or one dol-
lar at a time. They are made of the
same material, the only difference
being that some are better disguised
than others.

Generally speaking, they may be
divided into three classes: husbands,
widowers, and bachelors. A bachelor
is an eligibel mass of obstinacy sur-
rounded by suspicion. Husbands are
of three types: prizes, surprises, and
consolation prizes. Making a hus-
band out of a man is one of the high-
est forms of plastic art known to civ-
ilization. It requires science, sculp-
ture, common sense, faith, hope, and
charity——but mostly charity.

If you ﬂatter a man, you frighten
him to death. If you don’t, you bore
him to death. If you permit him to
make love to you, he gets tired of you
in the end; and if you don’t, he gets
tired of you in the beginning.

at a single point. Rollers and races are case-carburized to give
a hard, wear-resistant surface over a tough, shock-resistant
core. And to be sure of getting the highest quality bearing
steel, the Timken Company makes its own.

PHOTOGRAPHY AT WORK No. 4 in a Kodak series

Photography helps
a New Steel Mill

roll into action

Fairless Works, U. S. Steel’s new Eastern
Seaboard mill, is now starting operations——
and growing—at the same time. And camera and

film play their parts in both.

. . . to help locate ore,

plot transportation,
 lay out plants, control
quality, improve production,
U. 5. Steel puts Photography to work.

From ore through research and production, Photog-
raphy is one of Steel’s important operation tools. It
helped locate and appraise the new Venezuelan
Cerro Bolivar deposits which sparked this great new
seaboard mill. It helped chart the ore’s course to the
sea—helped plan the plant and keeps a running rec-
ord of its growth. And day after day it’s at work in
the research lab improving steel metallurgy, and on
the production line controlling quality.

Countless numbers of America’s Varied industries,
large and small, use photography in many ways to
save time, speed accomplishment, increase produc-
tion, and cut costs. P

In fact, so many new applications of photography
are being found, that many well—qualiﬁed graduates
in the physical sciences and in engineering have
been led to ﬁnd positions with the Eastman Kodak
C0mpaI1_y. Returning servicemen, too, have found
new opportunity here.

TI-IEY’RE “'GOING PLACES"
A'I' GENERAL ELECTRIC

Like these young men pictured here, hundreds of scien-
tists, engineers, chemists, physicists and other college
graduates are “getting ahead” fast at General Electric . . . .
and they are working on projects with the assurance that
their contributions are meaningful and important.

They are moving up rapidly because at General Electric
a world of opportunity awaits the college man of today——a
world limited only by his own ability a11d interest. The
variety of General Electric products and the diversity of
the Company’s operations provide virtually unlimited
ﬁelds of opportunity and corresponding rewards, both
materially and in terms of personal satisfaction to young
men who begin a G-E career.

New developments—in silicones, electronics, semi-con-
ductors, gas turbines, atomic power, and others—spring-
ing from G-E research and engineering, are creating

exciting new opportunities, and are giving college gradu-
ates the chance of ﬁnding satisfying, rewarding work.

And by placing prime importance on the development of
talent and skill, developed through G-E train.ing pro-
grams and broadened through rotational job programs,
and by providing incentives for creative minds, General
Electric is hurrying young men into success i11 an in-
dustry that is devoted to serving all men through the
ever-increasing and ever-widening uses for electricity,
man°s greatest servant.

If you are interested in building a career with General Elec-
tric see your college placement director for the date of the
next visit of the General Electric representative on your cam-
pus. Meanwhile, for further information on opportunities with
General Electric write to College Editor, Dept. 2-I23, Gen-
eral Electric Company, Schenectady 5, New York.

V  hats on the horizon

for a young engineer ‘.9

HAT depends, of course, on where he sets his
sights.

The horizon at General Motors is crowded with
opportunities for the young engineering school
graduate. They are opportunities that he might
never discover elsewhere.

From General Motors ﬂow an endless variety of
products. Automobiles, trucks, refrigerators,
Diesel engines are just a few. In addition, GM
defense contracts include shells, bombsights,
range ﬁnders, tanks and gas turbine engines.

So you can see how a GM engineer has a real
chance to follow his natural bent, and work in
the ﬁeld of his choice.

But there’s another important advantage in
launching your career at General Motors. All

work is decentralized among GM’s 33 manufac-
turing divisions, its 116 plants in 57 towns and
cities throughout the United States. And though
each division operates on its own, each can call
upon the vast resources of GM’s central research
and engineering laboratories.

Thus General Motors, despite its size and scope,
gives you the opportunity of working intimately
with top engineers, of sharing their knowledge
and experience.

Does the opportunity pay off? Many engineering
school graduates, now in key jobs at GM, can
testify that it does.

Why not check with your College Placement
Oﬂice and arrange for an interview with our GM
College Representative the next time he visits
your campus. Or if you prefer, write direct to us.

Midget with the giant brain

To design and
build a computer
for airborne
automatic control
systems— with
severe restrictions
imposed on size,
weight and opera-
tion under extreme
environmental
conditions; in
short, a computer
that would be
small, simple,
reliable,
rugged — and easy
to build
and maintain.

AT Huem-:s RESEARCH and
Development Laboratories this
problem was examined exhaus-
tively, and it was concluded that
a digital computer offered the best
means for satisfying the require-
ments because of its ability to
solve complex problems accu-
rately and quickly.

Because the requirements of
this application could not be met
by existing digital computers,
owing to their large size, the
following developments were
undertaken:

1. Simpliﬁcation of the logical
structure of the computer through
the use of a mathematical theory
of computer design based on
Boolean algebra—but with reten-
tion of the operational versatility
of a general—purpose computer.

2. Development of ingenious
circuitry to utilize the new logi-
cal designs.

3. Achievement of minimum
size by the use of subminiature
techniques, including germanium
diodes, subminiature tubes, and
etched circuits.

4. Employment of unitized con-
struction: plug-in units of ﬂip-
ﬂop circuits and diode networks.

Need for subminiaturization,
then, was a governing factor.
Consequently, entire new tech-
niques for making things not only
vastly smaller, but at the same
time easier to build and service,
were developed by Hughes. This
is a continuing process and there
is indication of even more signif-
icant advancement in miniaturi-
zation for the future.

A major effort at Hughes is also
devoted to adapting electronic
digital computer techniques to
business data processing and re-
lated app1ications—destined for
far—reaehin g peacetime uses.

One of the subminiature switching circuits from
the Hughes airborne electronic digital computer

is examined by Dr. Eugene M. Grabbe (right),
Associate Head, Computer Systems Department,
Advanced Electronics Laboratory, and Phil A.
Adamson of the Technical Staff, Radar Laboratory.

AIR MUSCLE . . .

Properly compressed and coupled to this drilling
tool, air packs a rock-busting wallop. How differ-
ent from the days when men slung sledges, and
even cracking pavement was a slow, tortuous task

. . as were many other manual jobs in industry.

MIND OVER MUSCLE . . .

When men of science learned how to put a cyclone
in a cylinder, pneumatic tools and compressed air
became salient servants in saving men’s muscles
and industry’s time.

In its more than two hundred applications com-
pressed air cleans, sprays, operates machines for
hoisting, hauling, hammering, drilling, cutting,
grinding, blowing, pumping. Applied in free or en-
closed action this versatile, conveniently-conVey-
able power agent may be found at work in mines
and mills, on highways and skyways, on and under
the water, in production and processing.

AMERICA WORKS LIKE THAT. . .

Uniquely so. For here, every art, every science,
