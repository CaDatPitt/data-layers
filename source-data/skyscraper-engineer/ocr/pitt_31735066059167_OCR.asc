GO WESTINGHOUSE,
YO U N G MAN! Yl“5r’§;§c¥Z°;l§i;L”.'l

There was once a college senior named Al Addin who
yearned for his place in the sun.

However, at graduation time so many companies offered
him a job, Al didn’t know which one to accept.

Then he met a Mr. Greeley, the recruiter from Westing-
house. Mr. Greeley was a kindly man with a warm smile.
He described to Al how at Westinghouse young men have
their choice of six operating groups* and work in friendly,
tight-knit little teams on the world's most exciting projects.

“Go Westinghouse, young man,” Mr. Greeley urged.

And Al Addin did. He wanted to be part of Westinghouse
efforts to help the nation rebuild cities, so he joined the
corporation's Construction Group — supplier of the world’s
widest range of products for the construction market.

One day, while Al was polishing a Westinghouse lamp,
a Jeanie appeared. This pretty, warmhearted, intelligent
Jeanie was an engineer with the Elevator Division. (Women
are welcome at Westinghouse, an equal opportunity em-
ployer.) As the daughter of one of the richest men in Amer-
ica, Jeanie was in a position to grant Al Addin three wishes.

A|’s first wish —to help Westinghouse build a municipal
complex of apartments, offices, stores and parks within an
established metropolitan area.

Al's contribution to the project was to help develop a
computerized environmental analysis technique—an in-
genious system for precalculating the heating and cooling
needs of all the buildings in the complex. Grateful archi-
tects and consulting engineers voted Al the year’s most
calculating supplier.

A|’s second wish—to help develop a total transporta-
tion system for a new housing area being built.

Transportation for the new project would consist not
only of a remote-controlled mass transit system, taking
commuters to and from their places of business . . . but
it would also include sophisticated elevator and electric
stairway systems to be installed within the project's ter-
minal and living areas.

Al's third and last wish—to marry Jeanie.

She consented on the condition that he let her join him
on other major projects and urban systems assignments
undertaken by Westinghouse throughout the world.

Al Addin agreed . . . and they lived happily ever after.
MORAL: All your wishes for a prosperous career can be
granted if you join Westinghouse, where awaiting you are
challenges, hard work, building block education, travel.
adventure, and yes, even romance.

You can be slug if it's Westinghouse

For further information, contact the Mr. Greeley from West-
inghouse who will be visiting your campus during the next
few weeks or write: L. H. Noggle, Westinghouse Educa-
tional Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15221.

Opportunities at Anaconda

in mining and metallurgy here and abroad, at Anaconda American Brass C‘o.,

Anaconda Wire & Cable Co., and Anaconda Aluminum Co.

Looking inside
the earth for metals

The legendary prospector trudging on
foot through the wilderness scours the
surface of the earth—with luck gets a
hint of treasure inside through an out-
cropping of ore. But not all ore bodies
come near the surface. And pressures
to ﬁnd more metals for the needs of
growing populations. are so great we
can’t wait for infrequent bonanzas.
Modern mineral exploration must have
“eyes” that see under the-earth’s sur-
face. Anaconda’s program is based on
an ever greater understanding of the
distribution of elements i_n the earth’s
crust and the processes by which they
are concentrated into ore deposits.
Geology and geological research are
thus “eyes” that help outline broad
areas of potential mineralization.
Gradually, the search is narrowed to
smaller target areas through scientiﬁc
application of geological, geophysical,
geochemical techniques and other tools
that are additional “eyes” for modern
prospecting.

Then these target areas must be tested
and evaluated in the light of experience
and the critical and signiﬁcant features
commonly associated with ore-forming
processes. The ‘three-dimensional geo-
logical model shown below was pre-
pared to help Anaconda geologists look
under the earth’s crust at a later stage
in this process of evaluation.
Anaconda is a pioneer in the applica-
tion of geology to mining and explora-
tion. And it is intensifying and enlarg-
ing its program of laboratory and ﬁeld
research at geological headquarters
throughout the hemisphere. This opens
broad new job opportunities in all
areas of earth sciences for geophysi-
cists, geochemists, geological engineers,
chemical engineers, physicists, and
metallurgists.

 

Anaconda settles an
old argument

The Statue of Liberty is one of the ﬁn-
est examples of natural patina in the
world. And for years experts have
argued whether this patina is basic cop-
per sulfate or basic copper carbonate.
Some felt there should also be a good
percentage of chloride salts because of
the salty atmosphere whipped up by
the winds from the bay.

Anaconda spoiled all the fun by offer-
ing to get the answer. With the per-
mission of the statue’s custodians, met-
allurgists from the Research and Tech-
nical Center of Anaconda American
Brass obtained adequate samples and
made an extensive analysis.

The talents and skills of techni-
cally qualiﬁed men and women
will always be needed by
Anaconda in important positions
in exploration, mining, extrac-
tive metallurgy, manufacturing,
scientiﬁc research, sales, and ad-
ministration.

If you would like more informa-
tion about Anaconda or wish to
apply for employment, write to:
Director of Personnel, The
Anaconda Company, 25 Broad-
way, N .Y., N.Y. 10004.

Results of X-ray diffraction, semi-
micro chemical, and wet chemical proc-
esses proved a predominance of cop-
per sulfate. This is easily explained by
the high estimate tonnage of sulfur-
bearing acids produced in New York’s
atmosphere every day-and by the dif-
ference between the free energies of
formation of copper chloride and cop-
per sulfate.

Basic copper chloride content was less
than five per cent. And basic carbon-
ates are virtually absent because they

 

can’t survive in the acid environment.
This pleasant. little side trip was by no
means unrelated to the regular work of
the Anaconda research teams. They are
concerned with everything that hap-
pens to copper metals—and all the com-
binations of useful properties they can
supply. They work on new ﬁnishes for
copper metals and on industrial corro-
sion problems. They develop new
alloys to meet new needs. They pursue
pure research.

Anaconda’s research and development
are key factors in expanding copper’s
role in a rapidly advancing technology.
It is opening new opportunities for col-
lege graduates at Anaconda American
Brass in all ﬁelds of engineering, in
business administration and sales.

Cable to feed our growing,
power-hungry cities

Our big cities keep getting bigger. They
need much more electric power every
year, in big concentrated chunks of
load. And generator output must be
carried at high voltage to these new
load centers.

You can’t string the transmission lines
down such places as Broadway, or
across 42nd St. So you dig—carry the
power in the already crowded space
under busy city streets.

Anaconda, anticipating this need, built
the best equipped high-voltage research
laboratory in the cable business (see
be1ow)—and used it to develop the
345,000-volt cable now actually in use.
And now, Anaconda Wire & Cable Co.
is busy working on plans to satisfy
power needs of tomorrow’s cities.
Anaconda produces wire and cable not
only for the utility industry, but also
for modern communication systems,

   

telephone and CATV; and for count-
less applications in building and indus-
try. Constant engineering investigation
at the Company’s four research centers
is opening new frontiers of knowledge
in wire and cable technology—new op-
portunities for engineering graduatesém

Operating deep down in liquid helium, a few degreesabove absolute zero,
the RCA experimental memory plane in thedewaris storing and
discharging information in the form of persistent circulating
supercurrents. In this state of zero resistance, thousandsof memory bits
t are executing “read-write” cycles at pre-selected time intervals—ranging
 from less than 0.5 microsecond to inﬁnity, or just as long as the plane is
held in a superconductive state. At the‘ right, a typical experimental RCA
cryoelectric memory plane with 64 binary bits is shown in actual size.

You are facing a very important decision. When you
select the company that you want to join, consider how
important it is for your future career to join the leader.
For example, in this one area alone—Electronic Com-
ponents and Devices-—you will ﬁnd that RCA has set
standards of engineering excellence, in an environment
for learning, that is second to none.

EE, ME and IE opportunities exist for all degree
levels in every phase of research, design and develop-
ment, information systems, manufacturing, computer
marketing, and purchasing with RCA.

Another consideration — we believe in individual
growth. There are training programs, graduate educa-
tion programs, and in-house courses—all designed to
encourage your individual development and growth.

RCA KIIOWS HOW in Electronic Components and Devices

In addition, you will work in a distinguished scientiﬁc
and engineering environment.

You owe it to yourself to ﬁnd out more about the
great range of activities at RCA. See your college
placement director, or write to College Relations,
Radio Corporation of America, Cherry Hill, New
Jersey 08101.

Whatever your ﬁeld of interest—we would like to
hear from you.

which degree counts most?

Besides a B.S., M.S., M.B.A., Ph.D.—or what have you—there
are other degrees vital to your future. The degree of imagina-
tion. Ambition. Responsibility.

If you have them in good measure, we know of no company
better able, or more disposed, to reward them. Handsomely.
In terms of professional recognition, intellectually stimulating
environment, and material reward.

We're big. But we’re still young and growing. And plan to keep
on. In 1965, for example, our sales rose 23%. To over $860
million. And 516’million in the first half of '66.

We need top-notch people who can grow with us. People
who are well trained in chemistry, physics, chemical, elec-
trical, or mechanical engineering, marketing or finance.

And who have that extra degree.

Talk it over with your faculty and Placement Officer. And re-
gardless of your military commitments, be sure to see our rep-
resentative when he is on your campus. Or

Ten reasons
She will want you
to take a job at

ﬂ/ICDONNELL

See your placement director for a personal interview or mail this form to:
J. T. Snyder, McDonnell Employment Oiﬁce, Box 516, St. Louis, Missouri 63166

1. McDonnell is a “name” in aerospace . . . a name earned by solid
engineering achievement in the current decade. The engineering leader-
ship exempliﬁed by successes in Gemini Spacecraft and the Phantom
Fighters lifts your career and shoves it toward success.

2. Stability and security sometimes seem unimportant to young
engineers just starting a career. But they are essential and you would
be unwise to ignore them. McDonnell has never had a major decline
in engineering and professional employment. The Company has grown
rapidly in every one of its product areas. It presently has a backlog
of more than a billion dollars in production contracts, and yet research
is one of the fastest growing activities in the Company.

3. St. Louis is America’s “City on the Go”. In civic progress, in
entertainment, in stores and homes, in industry, in sports and recrea-
tion, in education, in construction, in human involvement, St. Louis
is the city with a “future” in the center of America.

4. You can best “change the world” by living in a world of change.
The climate of St. Louis offers the mental and physical stimulation
of four distinct seasons. How can you enjoy a warm ﬁre without a
new snowfall for comparison? What other natural phenomena than
spring brings such a lift to your spirits? Who has failed to enjoy the
comfort of a summer morning or the crisp smell of an autumn afternoon?

5. McDonnell’s suburban location allows you to choose from the
total spectrum of living locations. You may like the pace of apartment
life at the heart of this 21/2 million person metropolis. Or you might
like the nearby suburbs with small city atmosphere and tree-lined
streets. Just as convenient are rural areas, where you can live apart
from the hustle yet be close enough to enjoy city-living advantages.

6. Naturally you want to earn your way and you want all you can
earn. McDonnell wages are competitive with that of other industries.
But being competitive isn’t enough after you begin to show your
mettle. Then, it is corporate policy to recognize the unique and indi-
vidual efforts of those who strive for and achieve engineering excellence.
Success will stem from a combination of inspiration and perspiration
. . . probably l0"/,, of the former and 90% of the latter. But if you’re
willing to work, you’ll never need to worry about your economic and
organizational progress at McDonnell.

7. Facilities at McDonnell are second to none in space, advanced
aircraft and automation. You’ll ﬁnd organizational and physical work-
ing conditions that complement your skills and education. McDonnell
testing and development facilities range from man-rated space cham-
bers to Mach 28.wind tunnels, laboratories from microbiology to
optics, computers from analog through hybrid to digital. You will
ﬁnd McDonnell is a team organization and nowhere is teamwork as
essential as in the aerospace industry. Team organizations keep you
from becoming a desk-bound engineer and stimulate the exchange of
experience and knowledge so necessary to the development of wisdom.

8. The Gateway to Space is in St. Louis. You’ll be working with the
experienced men at McDonnell who designed the aircraft and space-
craft that have; for a decade, dominated aerospace technology.
McDonnell is strongly oriented toward government contracting. It has
demonstrated the talent that provides exceptional national service
while returning worthwhile earnings to investors. As the fastest growing
segment of our national economy, the Government provides a stable
and continuing marketplace for those companies whose organization
is oriented toward effectively serving the Nation’s needs.

9. You may feel you’ve had enough education, but you’ll soon
decide to seek more. The McDonnell College Study Plan encourages
self development and offers economic assistance plus adjusted work
week beneﬁts for advanced degree studies directly related to your job
responsibilities. Many private and public colleges and universities in
the area offer applicable programs.

10. Nowhere in industry can a young engineer ﬁnd more job sat-
isfaction than in contributing to national advancements in air and
space. At McDonnell, pride in workmanship is a habit nurtured by
the national acclaim that is the reward for success.

Does H Exist?

Mr. A. F. Lopez was born
in Boston in 1920, received
his B.S. in Electrical Engi-
neering from Northeastern
University in 1943. After
;pending 41/2 years in the
‘Xrmy he went to the Univer-
:ity of Maine for a year, then
0 Penn State for ﬁve years as
Ll’). Electrical Engineering in-
tructor.

In 1952, he joined the HRB
Singer as a Senior Engineer
ind started working in the
ﬁeld of Electronic Counter-
measures and Technical Intel-
ligence. At the present time
he is Director of Intelligence

EDITOR’S NOTE: This story is reprinted by permission
from the Penn State Spectrum. It is not necessarily Mr.
Lopez’ intention to convince readers‘ that UFO"s actually
exist, but rather to acquaint people with the strong positive

evidence of their existence.

__1

1965 may be remembered as the year that UFO’s (Uni-
dentiﬁed Flying Objects) returned. As far as the general
public was concerned, UFO’s or Flying Saucers, as they were
more popularly known, had disappeared into limbo along
with hulahoops and other passing fancies.

UFO students, however, realize that people were still
sighting strange things in the sky and had been seeing them
almost continuously since Kenneth Arnold ﬁrst publicized
them in 1947.

But 1965 saw so many reports by numerous reliable
witnesses, that even newspapers which had ceased publish-
ing UFO stories, began giving UFO’s front page coverage.

UFO’s present several problems to us — do they exist?
—- and if so, what are they and where are they from? In
this article I shall try to answer these questions.

The term “Flying Saucer” was ﬁrst applied to these
objects back in 1878. On January 25, 1878, the Dension
Daily News of Texas carried a report concerning a Mr.
John Martin, a farmer living a few miles outside the city.
Martin stated that the previous Tuesday he had gone out
hunting and that his attention was caught by a dark object
high in the sky to the south. The object increased in size
as it approached him, and by the time it had passed over-
head, it was about the size of a large “saucer” and evidently
at a great height. The object continued on its way and soon
disappeared from view. The paper’s report concludes with
the comment that “Mr. Martin is a gentleman of undoubted
veracity, and this strange occurrence deserves the attention
of scientists.”

In 1896, from November 17 to November 23, the resi-
dents of Oakland, San Francisco and Sacramento were sub-
jected to visits from a cigar—shaped vehicle equipped with
blinding lights. The weather was cloudy and rainy on most

of the days. The San Francisco Call, on November 19,
devoted a full front page to reports of the sightings. Thou-
sands of people all over .the Sacramento _Valley saw this
vehicle and gave reports to the local newspapers. Compare
this with a September 20, 1964, report from the Redwood
City and Eureka areas of California. The Humboldt
Standard stated that it had received half a dozen or more
eports on a multi—lighted, cigar—shaped vehicle which ﬂew

over the area about 9:50 p.m. Don Martin (owner of a

lumber company) and his family watched the object through
a 60—power telescope. Three patrolmen going to work in
Alameda County stated that the thing looked like a ﬂying
submarine.

On February 19, 1951, Captain I. Bicknell was ﬂying the
regular Lodestar ﬂight from Nairobi West Airport to Mom-
basa. At 7:20 a.m. the radici" oﬂicer pointed out a bright
object about 10,000 feet above Mt. Kilimanjaro. The object
hung motionless for some time as they approached it.
Captain Bicknell and several of the passengers observed the
object through ﬁeld glasses. Bicknell described it as about
200 feet long with a square—cut vertical ﬁn at one end and
made of some bright shiny metal. Suddenly, the object
started to move away and up. Captain Bicknell estimated
it covered about 60 miles in 3 minutes and then it disap—
peared from view. The day was exceptionally clear with
no cloud formations. '

On Iune 27, 1959, Father Gill, an Anglican clergyman in
charge of the mission at Boinai, New Guinea, reported that
he and a dozen of his mission boys observed several UFO’s
for the second consecutive day. This time, about 6 p.m.,
they saw a large UFO some distance away. However, it was
close enough so that they could see four ﬁgures—apparently
humanoid — appear on top of the UFO. The ﬁgures oc-
casionally bent over or raised their arms as if they were
adjusting or setting up something not visible to Father Gill
and his boys.

Not all UFO’s are cigar-shaped. In July 1963, a series

of mysterious craters appeared in various parts of England.
One occurred at the farm of a Mr. Roy Blanchard in Wilt-
shire. The marks consisted of a saucer—shaped depression

Taken by Paul Villa near Bernalillo, New Mexico, 4/18/65.

  

mated to be 70 feet in diameter, 18 feet high.

about 8 feet in diameter and 4 inches deep. In the center
of the depression was a hole about 3 feet deep and 1 foot
in diameter. A bomb disposal crew was called in to examine
the area. They stated that there were no burn or scorch
marks. One of the men stated that his instruments indicated
the ground to be highly magnetized.

A recent article by Donald Keyhoe presents several more
incidents of interest. On April 8, 1964, the first two—man
Gemini capsule was launched at Cape Kennedy. Keyhoe
states that while the Gemini capsule was in its ﬁrst orbit,
four spacecraft of unknown origin ﬂew up to it and appeared
to inspect it very carefully for some time, then they drew
away from the capsule and vanished from the screens of the
tracking radars.

Keyhoe also describes a photocopy of an oﬂicial tracking
log from Cape Kennedy for operations on January 10, 1961.
According to the log, a Polaris missile was on its way up
when a UFO came in over the range. It was rather large
and maneuvered so close to the Polaris that the automatic
tracking radar on the ground locked onto the UFO by
mistake. Eventually, the UFO ﬂew out of the range of the
radar, and supposedly, it took the trackers 14 minutes to ﬁnd
the Polaris again.

Some 1965 sightings of interest—from the Philadelphia
I nqztirer, Ianuary 5 -— 1

“The Air Force is investigating the reported sighting of
two high-speed unidentiﬁed ﬂying objects by Navy radar
operators at Patuxent Naval Air Station, Maryland.

The Navy said Tuesday, that the operators observed
‘Two objects on their scope approaching at approximately
8400 miles an hour from 30 to 40 miles south’ of the base
at 8:30 U., December 20.

“The objects approached the naval air station, executed a
tight turn, and disappeared from the scope,” the Navy said.

“About the fastest aircraft in existence is the X-15

experimental plane, which has ﬂown at'4104 miles an hour.
The X—15 is based on the West Coast. It has a very short
range.”

Photos of UFO takeii in New Mexico, 1963. Craft was esti-

August 3, 1965—UFO’s were reported over Texas, New
Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma on Saturday and Sunday.
Deputy Sheriff Everett Tucker of Wellington, Kansas, and
his wife spotted a “cigar—shaped silvery thing in the sky”
about 4:50 a.m. C.S.T. It had a reddish vapor trail and
moved rapidly towards the north. Another Wellington
policeman looked at one object with binoculars. He said it
was three car lengths long and egg-shaped.

Pittsburgh Pres: — September 16, 1965 —— Johannesburg,
South Africa -— Police and scientists are investigating a re-
port that a ﬂying saucer landed on a main highway near
Pretoria. Two patrolling police oﬂicers reported seeing the
flaming saucer, about 30 feet in diameter, shortly after mid-
night. Ofﬁcer Koos de Klerk said the shiny copper colored
object resembled a giant spinning top. Scientists who ex-
amined the spot found a 6-foot wide section of the tarred
road had been badly burned. Grass on either side of the
highway was reported scorched. -

Pittsburgh Pres: — September 21 —— printed a picture
of a dome-type UFO taken August 3 by Rex Heflin, Cali-
fornia highway investigator, near Santa Ana, California.

These are only a few of several hundred similar reports
from all over the world which were published in newspapers
and magazines last year.

There have also been many photographs and moving
pictures taken of UFO’s. Recently, on TV was shown a
movie taken by Mrs. Madeleine Rodeffer of Silver Springs,
Maryland. She photographed a disc-shaped UFO which
appeared over her back yard. Experts have declared her
ﬁlms to be authentic.

A number of photographs have been reproduced in this
article, showing some of the types of UFO’s which have
been photographed. Some of these photographs have come
from some of the many organizations devoted to collecting
information about UFO sightings. One such organization
is the National Investigations Committee. on Aerial
Phenomena (NICAP).

These organizations claim that there are hundreds of
sightings every year, and in recent years, the numbers have
increased. However, due to a blackout on Flying Saucer
news, very few of these reports get wide publicity, and they
usually appear only in local newspapers. Thus, it is neces-
sary to have organizations like NICAP with members all
over the world to collect these reports and assemble the data.

Many of these organizations claim that the real story on
UFO’s is being suppressed by the Air Force, Central Intel-
ligence Agency, the Government or half a dozen other
groups. They have some justiﬁcation for this feeling. The
Air Force did try to hide their investigations under various
names such as Project Blue Book, Project Grudge, etc.
Several times they allegedly “closed out” one of these projects
with much publicity, only to keep the work going on under
a new name. This certainly does seem as if they are trying
to hide something. You also get people like Donald Menzel
of Harvard College Observatory, who wrote a book explain-
ing away all of the UFO sightings as hallucinations, lens
defects, temperature inversions, etc., etc. Unfortunately,

‘I0

there are deviations from the facts in some of his cases which
leads one to suspect his explanations. Also unfortunately, he
does not discuss the above mentioned cases nor most of the
cases mentioned in my article. You see, it is a little difficult
to explain the Captain Bicknell sighting under any of
Menzel’s usual variations.

Take the case of the August 3, 1965, sighting mentioneclr
earlier. The Air Force explanation was — “Initial study o§£
the reports received would indicate that the observations;
were astronomical in nature. The objects may have beerf

the planet Iupiter, or the stars Rigel, Capella, Betelgeux or 

Aldeberan, all of which were visible.”

However, Robert Risser, director of Oklahoma Science
and Art Foundation Planetarium in Oklahoma City said
that watchers in Oklahoma certainly did not see the planet
or stars which the Air Force listed. “These stars and planet
are on the opposite side of the earth from Oklahoma City
at this time of year!” There was no comment from the Air
Force.

One of the real problems of trying to understand or solve
the UFO mystery is that only 5 to 10 percent of the sight-
ings have any signiﬁcance. The majority of the sightings
probably are hallucinations, hoaxes, or errors or probably
have some other natural explanation. However, most of our
efforts ought to be concentrated on this signiﬁcant 5 or 10
percent of the sightings. And they will not disappear just
by our ignoring them.

For example, consider the ﬁrst two sightings in this
article. At that time, there were no airplanes, and balloons
do not travel in a controlled fashion as these UFO’s did. The
large number of people involved in the second sighting pre-
cludes hoaxes, temperature inversions or any other normal
explanation.

Captain Bicknell is only one of many airline pilots who
have seen and described objects which they know were not
airplanes or balloons or any other ﬂying objects with which
they were familiar. These men are trained observers — their
jobs require good eyesight, extreme vigilance and care, and
if they are found to be in the habit of seeing things that are
not there, they are soon out of work. So, when someone like
Captain Bicknell observes something through binoculars
and describes it as like nothing he has ever seen before (what
bullet-shaped, square—ﬁnned vehicle do you know that can
hover at 10,000 to 15,000 feet and then suddenly zoom off at
1200 miles per hour —— in 1951 Hi), you can be sure he was
not having hallucinations!

And who wants to call Father Gill a liar and say that he
did not see what he claims he saw? The oﬂ-icial explanation
by Australian Air Force Intelligence was that Father Gill
was looking at the planets Iupiter, Saturn and Venus!!!

Obviously there is much confusion and contradiction in
the ﬁeld of UFO’s. On the one hand, you have Air Force
Intelligence Units all over the world, claiming that people
are seeing stars or planets. On the other hand, an equally
reputable group like the National Investigation Committee
on Aerial Phenomena published a book in 1964 which was
distributed to all members of Congress in an attempt to
urge Congress to investigate NICAP’s claims of censorship

by the Air Force of the true facts behind the UFO's.

This book, The UFO Evidence, is probably the best and
most complete summary of ﬂying saucer incidents of the past
17 years, including statements, descriptions, pictures, sketches,
and analyses of the incidents. After reading this book, you
can’t help but be convinced that there is something “up
there” besides the moon and the planets!

Okay —— if there are things up there, where do they come
from? In order to seek out the answer to this question, let
us ﬁrst goiback into history — ancient history. Let us assume
that many thousands of years ago, earth was in contact with
other planets and perhaps other star systems. The people
from these other planets may have been colonizing earth, or
trading with earth or doing scientiﬁc studies on earth. And
then suddenly there was some cataclysmic event which took
place —- such as a near planetary collision as suggested by
Velikovsky, or perhaps an experiment which went wrong
resulting in an explosion which caused a large land mass
to sink beneath the sea resulting in the universal ﬂood
legends; or maybe it was an interplanetary war which nearly
wiped out all civilization.

“Nonsense,” you say, “if such a thing had taken place,
there would still be records and evidence. Where are they?”

Let is look for these records and evidence. Perhaps they
are all around us and we just don’t see them! For example,
a number of people’have legends that their ancestors came
from the planet Venus —— some North American Indians,
the Mayans, the “Long Ears” of Easter Island, and the
Hindus of India. From widely reported spots on earth, and
they all have the same legend!

A paleontological expedition led by Dr. Chow Ming Chin
in 1959 found a shoe print in a piece of sandstone in the
Gobi Desert. It was estimated to have been made millions of
years ago.

In the Salzburg Museum is an object taken from a block
of coal from a mine in Lower Austria. The object is an
almost perfect cube of steel, two opposite faces are a bit
rounded, and a deep incision runs around the cube. Also
found in a lump of coal —— a small gold chain about 10 inches
long and of quaint workmanship. The Scientiﬁc Americczn,
1851-52, describes a bell-shaped vessel 41/; inches high, 6'1/2
inches at the base, and 21/2 inches at the top, made of silvery
alloy and beautifully engraved, which was found embedded
in rock 15 feet below the surface of the ground. Now who
was going around millions of years ago leaving footprints in
the Gobi Desert and losing gold chains, silver cups and
steel blocks?

A German engineer, Wilhelm Konig, while visiting the
Baghdad Museum discovered ‘that some ﬂat round objects
labeled “ritual objects” were in reality electric batteries 2000
years old. In what sort of rituals did they use electric
batteries 2000 years ago?

Members of the Chinese Academy of Science examined
a metallic girdle with open work ornaments found in the
tomb of the Tsin General Chou Chou who lived about
265 A.D. This girdle was found to be 85 percent aluminum.
The only method today used to extract aluminum from

bauxite, namely by electrolysis, has been in use only since
1808. Yet, someone was making aritcles out of aluminum
1700 years ago. Could that be what they needed those
Baghdad batteries for?

In the middle of the 19th Century a Turkish Naval
Oﬂicer, Piri Reis, presented the Library of Congress with a
set of maps he had discovered in the East, the oldest of
which dated back to the First Century, A.D. In 1952 a car-
tographer, A. H. Mallery, became interested in these maps
and together with another cartographer named Walters,
made an intensive study of them. They found that when
these maps were compared with a modern globe map of the
world, they were correct in all details, not only for the Med-
iterranean area but for all the countries of the world, in-
cluding areas of the Antarctic which are covered with ice at
the present time and whose land contours we can distinguish
only with great difﬁculty. These maps would be easy to
explain on the basis of an aerial survey made thousands of
years ago — but how do you explain the aerial survey?

In a cave at Bohistan, at the foot of the Himalayas, in-
scriptions have been found accompanied by astronomical
maps showing the stars in the positions they occupied 13,000
years ago. Lines connect Venus with the Earth. Would this
be because there was contact between the two planets in
those days?

Tiahuanaco is a deserted city of ruins 12,000 feet high
in the Andes of Peru, near Lake Titicaca. One of the ruins
of interest is the Gateway of the Sun, carved out of a single
block of stone about 10 feet high and 12.5 feet wide. It is
covered with hieroglypics which have been identiﬁed as
an astronomical calendar. A Russian scientists, Alexandre
Kazantsev, has suggested that if Venus rotates on its axis in
just over 9 earth days, as indicated by the ﬁndings of Russian
scientists, Kotelvihov and Chklovski, and modiﬁed by the
American, Cooper, then the Venusian year would consist of
about 24 Venusian days. If you add two “leap years” in
12 years, you get 10 years of 24 days and 2 years of 25 days,

Zweasuring 14 by 70 feet, this stone is lying in a quarry in
Baalbeck.

ming of the Tassili pictures. The ﬁgure in the center is face-
less and over ten feet high.

totalling 290 days in the 12-year period. The calendar on the
Gate of the Sun is a 290—day calendar. Coincidence? The
mountain lake of Titicaca has still preserved a well deﬁned
line of a seashore. Remains of sea weeds, shells, and the
ruins of a sea harbor can be seen there. Now who would
build a harbor 12,000 feet up in the mountains — could it
be that the harbor was by an ocean originally but that some
cataclysmic event pushed the harbor up away from the ocean?
Geologists say no, the Andes have been there for millions
of years. But then who is it that is building cities and sea-
ports using blocks of stone weighing hundreds of tons two
miles up in the mountains?

The ruins of Baalbek lie to the northeast of Beirut,
between the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea and the
northern end of the Syrian Desert. They are the most
majestic and most notable of the Earth’s ancient structures
and are the most mystifying because there is no single vestige
of information showing when or by whom they were
created. Almost 2000 year ago, the Romans built some great
temples using the ancient platform remains. These platforms
consist of massive stones 13 feet square and 60 to 70 feet
long, built into a massive wall 20 feet above the ground.
Some of the individual stones weighed 1200 tons. A quarter
of a mile away lies the stone quarry from which these stones
were taken. In the quarry is a stone which apparently had
just been prepared, 14 by 17 feet by 70 feet long. For some
reason the construction ceased before they could use the
stone. The Romans did not make use of this stone in their
construction of temples — because they had no means of
moving the tremendous mass!

There are many similar ruins all over the world; ruins
constructed of massive stones so precisely cut that no mortar
was needed in the constructions. There are enough of these
constructions to make one wonder that many thousands of
years ago, men thought nothing of using stones weighing

12

hundreds and thousands of tons in these constructions. The
Black Pagoda of India is capped by one solid stone weighing
2000 tons. This was placed on top of a building 228 feet
high. Modern engineers would ﬁnd it an almost impossible
task with all our modern machinery. Yet we are to believe
that thousands of years ago men with ropes and wooden
pulleys were moving these stones about as if it were com-
monplace. I would prefer to believe that someone in a space
ship or with some sort of anti—gravity device would make a
more plausible explanation!

Enough on the subject of evidence. Now for some
records. Records may be written or pictorial.

In the Sahara Desert are some rock ruins covered with
ancient drawings about 8 or 10 thousand years old. These
are the so—called “Rocks of Sefar.” Professor Henri Lhote
called this picture the “Great God of the Martians from
Iabbarren.” The valley of Iabbaren where this painting was
found, in the local dialect means the “valley of the giants.”
Curious names, especially when you consider how much like
space suited ﬁgures the “monsters” appear to be!

A few months ago, a newspaper item ‘quoted some
Russian arehaeologists as having discovered some cave draw-
ings whicn resembled space—suited ﬁgures! The Leningrad
Hermitage has some Etruscan Cameos, one of which has an
image of a modern diver —— or perhaps a “being in a space
suit.”

Then again, there is the Mayan legend that describes how
a “giant eagle came out of the sky with the roar of a lion.
The great bird hovered over the ground, while its breath
made the cornstalks bend as it came in to land. From her
beak came flour creatures, strange to our tribe, who did not
breathe the air we breathe.” Does this not sound like a
flying machine with space suited occupants? And from
such widely separated spots on earth!

In the great sand ﬂat of the Nasca Valley of Peru is

the largest drawing board in the world. Here, intermingled
with ﬁgures of beasts, birds, and ﬁsh, some hundreds of feet
across, are huge geometric symbols —— triangles, spirals, lines,
etc. —— which stretch for miles._ The shapes cannot be dis-
tinguished from the ground, and their existence was not
discovered until a plane making an air photo reconnaissance
ﬂight went over the area. For what flying vehicles were these
signs intended? Remembering, of course, that these signs
predate the Incas.

From sacred Hindu manuscri.pts supposedly telling of
events of 20,000 years ago:

“When morning dawned, Rama, taking the celestial car
which Pushpaka had sent him by Vivishand, stood ready to
depart. Self—moving was this car; it was large and ﬁnely
painted. It had two stories and many chambers with win-
dows. It gave forth a melodious sound as it coursed along
its airy way.”

Another quotation — “It was an unknown weapon, an
iron thunderbolt, a gigantic messenger of death which re-
duced to ashes the entire race of the Vrishnis and the And-
hakas. The corpses were so burned as to be unrecognizable.
Their hair and nails fell out; pottery broke without any
apparent cause, and the birds turned white. After a few
hours, all food—stufTs were infected. The thunderbolt was
reduced to a ﬁne dust.”

Another one — “Cukra, flying on board a high powered
Vimana, hurled on to the triple city a single projectile
charged with all the power of the universe. An incandescent
column of smoke and ﬂame, as bright as ten thousand suns,
rose in all its splendour . . . ”

Quotations from ancient Hindu manuscripts, or are they
descriptions of modern nuclear weapons?

“But these are only legends,” you say. Well, so was the
story of the fall of Troy only a legend until a fellow named
Schliemann used the Illiad as a guide and located and dug
up Troy!

216 B.C.: “At Praeneste, 65 miles from Rome, burning
lamps fell from the sky, and at Arpinium, 42 miles east of
Praeneste, a thing like a round shield was seen in the sky.”

99 B.C.: “When Murius and Valerius were Consuls in
Tarquinia, there fell in different places a thing like a flame-

Sighted over Passaic, New Jersey, 1952.

 

torch and it came suddenly from the sky. Towards sunset, a
round object, like a globe, or a round circular shield took
its path in the sky from west to east.”

Here we have the first flying saucers ever reported ——
2300 years ago—they were described in terms familiar to the
people then, round shields in the sky!

From a Chinese encyclopedia it is mentioned that a
kind of vehicle called _Kiryqo was available in the era of Yin
which consisted of a wire speckled animal—shaped flying
device whose mane was red, eyes were gold, and the head
looked like that of a rooster. It is said that if a man rode on
its back he would live a thousand years. This wouldn’t be
time dilation resulting from the vehicle’s speed approaching
a signiﬁcant fraction of the speed of light, or would it?

From our own Bible we have the story of the prophet,
Ezekiel. We quote, Chapter One starting with Verse Four.

4. And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of
the north, at great cloud, and a ﬁre infolding itself, and a
brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the
colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.

5. Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of
four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they
had the likeness of a man.

6. And every one had four faces, and every one had
four wings.

(Four things came out of a ﬁery whirlwind and ap-
proached Ezekiel and he says they looked like men, despite
the fact that they had four faces and four wings. They are
not angels or monsters, but men — though there is some-
thing unusual about their appearances.)

7. And their feet were straight feet,‘ and the sole of their
feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkle like
the colour of bztrnished brass.

(For a person who has lived in a warm climate and
never seen any footwear more complicated than a sandal,
Ezekiel is doing very well at describing a highly polished
leather or metal boot!)

8. And they had the hands of a man under their wings
on their four sides,‘ and they four had their faces and their
wings.

(Each of the four creatures had the normal number of
human hands below their wings).

9. Their wings were joined one to another; they turned
not when they went; they went every one straight forward.

(Each wing is joined to another wing, and as the crea-
tures walk forward the wings turn (went) but the creatures
did not turn, they moved straightforward. The wings (pro-
peller blades) apparently turned by the wind.)

10. As for the likeness of the faces, they four had the
face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and
they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four
also had the face of an eagle.

(With appearances like this, why don’t Ezekiel call them
demons? Look at the illustrations. Ezekiel lived 2500 years
ago. How would you have described men dressed such as
these if you had been there?)

11. Th as were their faces: and their wings were stretched
upward,‘ two wings of every one were joined one to another,
and two covered their bodies.

13

12. And they went every one straight forward: whither
the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when
they went.

(Again look at the illustrations; Ezekiel is amazed that
the wings (propeller blades) apparently turn haphazardly
with the wind, and yet the four men are walking
straightforward.)

13. As for the likeness of the living creatures, their
appearance was like burning coals of ﬁre, and like the ap-
pearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living
creatures; and the ﬁre was bright, and out of the ﬁre went
forth lightning.

14. And the liz/ing creatures ran and. returned as the
appearance of a flash of lightning.

(Ezekiel is observing the reﬂections and glare or sunlight
from the surface of suits with shiny metallic surfaces.)

15. Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one
wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, with his four
faces. »
16. The appearance of the wheels and their work was
like unto the colour of a Beryl: and they four had one
likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were
a wheel in the middle of a wheel.

(First one of the creatures started up his propellers which
then took on the appearance of a wheel to Ezekiel, followed
by the other creatures.)

17. When they went, they went upon their four sides:
and they turned not when they went.

18. As for their rings, they were so high that they were
dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about
them four.

(The four creatures rose as in a formation and when they
got high overhead, the ﬂames from their tip—jets appeared
as a circle of bright spots or “eyes.”)

Ezekiel goes on to describe their controlled ﬂight away
from him with a roaring sound. Then they return, land,
and take off their wing packs and place them on the ground.

_ After reading the above descriptions by Ezekiel and
remembering that he was an intelligent and accurate ob-
server, can anyone doubt that Ezekiel saw four men in space
suits who had dropped down to visit Earth‘ from some space
ship?

Incidentally, remember the four visitors that the Mayans
had? Could there have been any connection between them
and Ezekiel’s visitors?

Well, what does all this add up to? Ancient ruins im-
possible to construct without an advanced technology, rock
paintings of “Martian Gods”, legends of ﬂights from other
planets to earth — and then we have the theory proposed
by I. S. Shklovsky of Russia, that Phoebe—one of the moons‘
of Mars is a hollow, artiﬁcial satellite! It seems that within
recorded history, Phoebe is apparently moving faster and
closer to Mars. This is the same effect caused by our atmo-
sphere on our artiﬁcial satellites. But the atmosphere of
Mars is so thin that it could not slow down a solid body --
Phobos must be very light and hollow to be affected by
Mars’ atmosphere. Also, Professor Sharpless of Swarthmore
College has calculated that Phoebe will last only millions of
years, which is very short compared to the billions of years

14

of a planet’s life. Could this explain why Phoebe and Deimos
were discovered less than a hundred years ago — they did
not exist before that!

What about the photographs of Mars that Mariner IV
sent back? No signs of life there? The September 24, 1965,
issue of Life magazine shows some pictures of Earth, taken
from Gemini 5 about 100 miles up. Except for one picture
of Cape Kennedy, showing a few suspicious straight lines,
the pictures prove that Earth is a desolate wasteland, with-
out a sign of life —— from 100 miles up. Our photos of Mars
were taken at about 7000 miles up. Now what did you really
expect to see from up there? Along these same lines, the
February 1966 issue of Analog has an article which “proves”
that life, as. we on Mars know it, is impossible on earth,
using some photos taken 150 miles above the earth by the
Navy’s Viking Rocket No. II.

I suggest that from the evidence presented in this article,
it seems highly likely that in ancient times the Earth was
in contact with Venus and Mars and possibly planetary
systems of other stars. And about 12,000 to 15,000 years ago
some cataclysmic event broke up these communications and
resulted in a loss of technical knowledge and civilization to
where we now have only fragmentary records and recollec-
tions of the even. Our present day UFO’s are either from
these same planets (depending on how they survive the cata-
clysm) or from new space—faring civilizations.

Why have we had such an onslaught of visitors since
1947? Well, up until 1946, we had been a pretty harmless
race — unable to hurt anyone but ourselves. All of a sudden
we come up with nuclear weapons and the beginning of a
new space age. Soon we will be in a position to blow up
not only our own world, but other planets as well. Would
not this upset any peace-loving people and make them
curious about us?

Finally, _you may ask — “Why don’t they land and
reveal themselves to us?”

I don’t know. Maybe it’s because people shoot at them
when they land. Perhaps the Earth is “protected” by space
law against contact from other civilizations. Maybe we are
a tourist attraction like one of our own zoos. Or maybe they
just don’t feel that we are worth bothering with!

Nothing would please me greater than to have a UFO
land in my back yard and have an alien step out of it and
say, “Take me to your leader!” I only hope it happens soon.

A Continuing Process

By
Minor C. Hawk

The day called “commencement” and the receipt of a
baccalureate degree does not end one’s education. Education,
an dengineering education in particular, is a continuing
process. For graduate engineers who follow a professional
career, a baccalureate degree is only the beginning of a new
phase in this process. The social and economic climate of
today is such that the years of formal education serve
primarily as a base from which to launch careers, but not
to maintain them indeﬁnitely at a proﬁcient level. Profes-
sional careers must be developed through both experience
and objective learning efforts. Furthermore, a graduating
engineer should plan his post-baccalureate education with
more acumen than may have been evidenced in his under-
graduate Work.

Although it is usually left to the individual to establish
his career goals, and to take the initiative in setting -up a
program of continuing education for himself, experience has
shown that motivating factors can originate with both the
employer and nearby academic institutions.

Since the School of Engineering at the University of
Pittsburgh is vitally concerned about the professional growth
of its graduates, as well as those from other institutions; and
since the School has been involved with post—graduate engi-
neering education for over 50 years, we have recently re-
aﬂirmed our commitment to industry by establishing an
Office of Continuing Education Studies. Through this
Office, the School of Engineering will continue to provide
programs which are dynamic, changing, and responsive to
the needs of industry, and more specifically, the engineers
employed by industry.

X

’E

our School of Engineering has been able to maintain a
unique relationship with industrial ﬁrms who look to us for
the providinglof trained professional personnel. And-since
industry employs a high percentage of graduating engineers,
it is essential that our School of Engineering should continue
to enjoy the conﬁdence and cooperation of industry.

Among the many problems encountered by practicing
engineers is that of keeping abreast of emerging technology.
As pioneers on the frontiers of such technology, engineers
must do everything possible to enhance their competence in
their chosen ﬁeld of practice.

Some basic facts which focus on the scientiﬁc and tech-
nological developments of recent years are as follows:

1. It is estimated that man has doubled the entire
body of knowledge in the past 20 years.

2. More than half of the research and development
conducted in the history of civilization has ocurred
in the past 10 years.

3. More than 90 per cent of all scientists and engineers
ever professionally trained are still alive today.

4. More than half of the occupations in which last
year's college graduates were employed did not
exist when they were born.

5. More than 5 million scientiﬁc and technical articles
are published annually in about 100,000 journals.

Problems arising from the technological obsolescence -of
both men and machines; from the impact of recent develop-
ments in automation and computing; from the rapid accu-
mulation of, and necessity for, retrieval of technical informa-
tion; and from the changing concepts and techniques of
management, all require the constant development of new
educational programs.

Since the obsolescence of individuals can have a very
damaging effect upon the growth potential of business and
industry, we believe that the future vitality of the engineer-
ing profession can best be assured through an effective, and
dynamic program of Continuing Education Studies.

The educational program of the Office of Continuing
Education Studies in the School of Engineering is planned
to provide assistance in the identiﬁcation and solution of
problems which stem from the raipd expansion of technology
and the resulting obsolescence of both men and machines.

Most of the programs to be offered will be designed pri-
marily to meet the needs of industry in the greater Pitts-
burgh area; however, some courses, seminars, and institutes
will be attractive to, and attended by, engineers from many
other states throughout the country.

Employers of Engineers in the University’s area of service
determine their need for continuing education programs.
Following this survey, the programs best suited to their
needs will be implemented and taught by the highest level
of qualiﬁed faculty. In some instances, outstanding person-
nel from other Universities or industry may be engaged as
instructors for a particular program.

There are several types of programs which may be clas-
siﬁed as Continuing Education, and some of these could be
modiﬁed still further to meet the speciﬁc needs of a particu-
lar participating organization.

Although no academic credit will be given, an appropriate
certiﬁcate may be awarded the students at the completion of
the program, based on predetermined criteria.

A. S/zort Courses —— The subject would be related to a
speciﬁc ﬁeld of engineering. Enrollment would be
limited to an established minimum and maximum
number of students. Classes might be held on
campus for several hours per day and the courses
could be of one or two weeks duartion.

B. E7zgz'neerz'72g Seminars —The subjects would be
related to a speciﬁc ﬁeld of engineering. Enrollment
would be limited to an established minimum and
maximum number of students. Classes would be
held on campus for several hours per day and the
seminar might be of one, two, or three days
duration.

C. Special Classes —— Type A——The subjects may be
suggested by the participating organization and ap-
proved by the appropriate Department Chairmen
in the School of Engineering. Enrollment would
be open to employees of the participating organiza-
tion only. Classes would be held off campus for
several hours per day and may last for one or more
successive days.

Type B —— A subject suggested by the participat-
ing organization and approved by the School of
Engineering. Enrollment; would be open to em-
ployees of the participating organization only and
limited to a predetermined minimum and maxi-
mum number of students. Classes would be held
off campus one day per week for a standard
academic term.

Type C — The School of Engineering would
determine the subject to be offered and would
initiate the program. Enrollment would be open to
qualiﬁed participants with an established minimum
and maximum number of students. Classes would
be held on campus one day per week for a
standard academic term.

D. Erzgineering Society Institutes —— The institutes
would be sponsored jointly by the School of Engi-
neering society. One or more classes might be
offered. The subjetcs would be suggested by the
society and approved by the School of Engineering.
The classes would be composed primarily of social
members and held -on campus with established
minimum and maximum registration. The institute
would last one or more successive days.

The School of Engineering recognizes the transitional
challenge of our technological society and we are prepared
to accept this mandate in the same cooperative spirit which
has characterized the School in the past. Our engineering
faculty, administrative personnel, and physical plant are ready
to serve the engineer who wants to make his engineering
education a continuing process.

AN OUTSTANDING ALUMNUS

The Who of River Forecasting

Mark Twain said that everyone talks about the weather,
but no one does anything about it. Vernon T. Houghton, ]r.,
chief of the Federal—State River Forecasting Service in Pitts-
bur h, is a livino contradiction to that ada c. He actuall

g D g Y
does something about it. Along with his staff he rovides

Researched and thousands of dollars for cities and industry.
Mr. Houghton’s phenomenal accuracy in predicting flood
Written by crest levels has proven itself through his repeated successes.
Because of‘ his accuracy and dissemination of measurements
ROb€Tt Ansercvitz and flood control data, his daily reports have become the

guideline for industry up and down our rivers, from Ebens—
burg, Pennsylvania and Salamanca, New York to Weston,
West Virginia.

Commendations from weather forecasting television sta-
tions and from industry leaders, who have been saved from
suffering extensive losses through use of Mr. Houghton’s
data, testify to the excellence of the service which he extends
to the community and the state.

Both WSTV and WTAE television stations commend
Mr. Houghton upon the accuracy of his river forecasts.
WTAE relied heavily upon Mr. Houghton’s help in produc-
ing a half-hour television documentary on the how-when—why
of floods. He has extended aid to the Pennsylvania Indus-
trial Chemical Corporation, Dravo Corporation and Wheel-
ing Steel, all of whom presently depend upon his forecasts
and river report stations.

Mr. Houghton helped Wheeling Steel Corporation install
materials and establish their new river gage at their Follans-
bee, West Virginia plant. Dravo Corporation, whose ex-
posure to potential flood damage and loss is quite high, since
they have a number of construction projects and river termi-
nals located on the upper Ohio and Monongahela rivers,
rely heavily on Mr. Houghton’s river information and stage
prediction forecasts.

The Pennsylvania Industrial Chemical Corporation,
which has faced several potentially threatening Hoods and
which has had portions of its plants inundated by floods,
now “place complete conﬁdence in and base their protective
action completely on the crest forecasts they receive.” Edward
A. Taylor, Assistant to the President of this corporation,
states, in a letter to the Regional Director of the United
States Weather Bureau, that this conﬁdence in Mr. Hough-
ton’s forecasts “comes not so much through greater reliability
. . . (as it does) through demonstrated performance over the
Vernon T' Houghton! Jr‘ years. Thus,” Mr. Taylor continues, “at the time of high
water in February of this year (1966) the forecasts and our
confidence in it enabled us to continue normal operation of
our plant without having to take precautionary steps. This,
of course, meant uninterrupted production and, in addition,

20

no money spent unnecessarily to move equipment to higher
ground.” _

Mr. Houghton, who graduated in 1932 as a civil engineer
from the University of Pittsburgh, has extended his work
beyond the limits of local industry. His system of river con-
trol gages and equipment in Pittsburgh has been copied
and is now successfully employed in fourteen areas across the
country. This standardization of processes is alleviating
problems in flood predicting, since use of the same setup
means thate flood stations all over the country are, in a sense,
speaking the same language and can if necessary, gain help
by contacting another station.

For many years Mr. Houghton has conscientiously sur-
veyed damage and savings ﬁgures following ﬂoods. He has
taken the lead in preparing forecast manuals for local com-
munities in the headwaters and on the small streams, and
has aided them in preparing their own flood warnings for
ﬂash floods.

The graphs and formulas which Vernon Houghton com-
piles represent the vast difference between the methods of
recording river levels now as compared to those of 1936',
when weatherman William S. Brotzman spent a hectic night
answering telephone requests for information on flood waters
which rose to forty—six feet in Pittsburgh and which claimed
thirty—two lives. This disaster spurred the federal and state
governments to action. The United States Weather Bureau
and the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters
combined forces in establishing a scientific river forecasting
section.

Today, observers at 51 river reading stations telephone
Mr. Houghton to report river levels, ice conditions, snow
cover and temperatures in their respective areas. Engineer-
ing teams measure the snow, moisture content and condition
of the soil. A citizen’s corps consisting of 145 people act
under Mr. Houghton’s guidance to provide data on river
stages, rainfall, ice and snow depth. This tightly organized
river observer corps was developed after the 1936 Pittsburgh
flood. In Pittsburgh, Vernon Houghton began to install rain
gages, recording theromometers and other devices. “I put
in most of the equipment I’m using now,” he notes. His
staff establishes formulas interpreted through his experience
and are able to make a forecast upon which eighty—five
communities are dependent.

It is easy to understand why river traffic depends upon
these daily reports for navigational operations and why
Army Engineers need the reports to control storage and
release of water at ﬂood level resevoirs. “The contractor
doing construction work in or near a river channel,” Mr.
Houghton wrote in an article in The Keystone Defender,
“is often glad to receive day-to-day advice. Perfect fore-
casts are of no value,” he continues, “unless through
thorough dissemination, all interested parties are made
aware of the predictions.”

“An adequate river forecasting service,” states Vernon
Houghton, “is as vital a factor in flood control plans as are
dams, levees and local projects. Probably no feature of Hood
control planning can offer as much potential economic value
for as little initial and annual cost as can river forecasting,”
he adds. The savings which result from precautionary mea-

sures which are taken after the receipt of Hood warnings is
sufficient to pay for the entire operation of the Pittsburgh
River Unit for 100 years or more. And certainly no one
can even assign a monetary value to the lives which are
saved each year because of this forecasting. For example,
the savings value, Mr. Houghton has ﬁgured, reported by
local interests for the four ﬂoods of January 1952, October
1954, March 1956 and August 1956 amounted to approxi—
mately $26,900,000 or about 27 per cent of the total savings
for the twenty—four year period from 1933 through 1956.

The extensive improvement in ﬂood prediction and pre—
ventative measures has not occurred merely because of a lot
of good luck. It has happened to a great extent because of
measures which Mr. Houghton initiated or improved in the
field. He has worked for the better dissemination of flood
warnings and for the improvement of river forecasting
techniques. He has initiated an increase in the number of
localities for which river forecasts are prepared and for better
cooperation and understanding on the part of the recipients
of the flood damage questionnaires (which he established
to help forecasting personnel to compile data for flood
reports).

Mr. Houghton, who studied Hydrology at John Hopkins
University and Radar Meterology at the University of Miami,
following his graduation from the University of Pittsburgh,
credits weather bureau changes to the upgrading of flood
forecasting standards and to the hiring of civil engineers
and hydrologists.

After this barrage of facts it is easy to simply say that
Mr. Houghton is a vital member of the community and is
dedicated to his job. Whether the above statement seems
to be just another platitude or not, both facts are true. The
weather, itself, does not limit its operations to conform to
an eight or even a twelve hour day, and for this very reason
Vernon Houghton’s job is a constant one. It may mean
returning to his office late at night to make numerous calls
to reporting stations which he has set up along the rivers.
It may, at crucial periods, entail working exhausting hours
in order to accrue ﬁgures for the eventual calculation of
accurate predictions, which are vital to railroad yards, indus-
try and cities. Vernon Houghton can’t merely sit in his
olhce and interpret collected data. He has to go out and
check river gages, and if you will pardon the pun, get his
feet wet, in order to make certain that rising and possible

ﬂood level waters will not destroy thousands of dollars worth
of cargo.

River crest prediction, water levels and river reports may
and probably do seen awfully distant and unimportant to
the average citizen. I have no doubt that people will con-
tinue to turn off their television sets as river level figures
and predictions are announced. Yet it is because of Mr.
Houghton, his reporters and staff that people can treat such
data with nonchalance. They no longer face the ﬂash de-
struction which the 1936 ﬂood wreaked and they /(now this.
People accept the existence of this system of checks on water
levels and flood predictions without realizing thate their very
acceptance and unaware-ness exemplify the proﬁciency and
accurateness with which Vernon Houghton and his staff
conduct the Federal-State River Forecasting Service.

For the month of February Cupid sends the engineers this
lovable Techni-Cutie, Miss Lynn Yarrington. Lynn is a junior
majoring in psychology with great hopes of attending Pitt’s
Graduate School of Counselling.

Lynn holds the position of Historian in Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority and among her many interests are sports and
art. Lynn’s home is in Southern Pines, North Carolina,
which she ﬁnds very different from Pittsburgh.

Lynn decided that she would rather not comment when
asked her opinion of engineers, because, she felt, she did not
know any well enough to make such a generalization. We’re
sure the engineers will be glad to let Lynn make their
acquaintance anytime.

THE ENGINEERS’

WEEK STORY,

St. Patrick was an engineer. This fact has been pro—-
claimed by engineering schools for the past ﬁfty years,
and has just been historically proven. ‘An ancient document
dating back to the time of St. Patrick was recently discovered
in Ireland, and it contained the words which every engineer
knew it would: Erin Go Braugh. This, loosely translated,
means “St. Patrick was an engineer.”

“Of course,” engineers explain, “it’s a rather loose transla-
tion.” But engineers further explain thate there is a deﬁnite
basis for their claim. “Didn’t St. Pat drive the snakes out of
Ireland, and wasn’t that the ﬁrst worm drivel Therefore,
St. Patrick was an engineer.”

Actual celebration began 64 years ago by engineers at the
University of Missouri. At that time there was little proof

that the Irish ever had any connection with the profession.
But needing a vacation, a group of students from that
campus claimed that they had received knowledge of the
saint’s ﬁeld of endeavor in what they called a “revelation,”
and celebrated his birthday by cutting all their classes and
engaging in various forms of merriment.

- As a result of the disciplinary action which followed
shortly thereafter, several of the more active celebrants were
absent from their classes for a much longer period. Two
years later, however, the celebration of St. Patrick’s Day
by the engineering students was officially recognized by the
university administration.

Iowa State College and the University of Arkansas fol-
lowed Missouri’s lead by establishing a special day of festive
ities in 1909. It was not long before most of the engineering
schools west of the Mississippi took the cry, and now the
“Engineers’ Day” or “Week” is a very celebrated occasion
around these parts. The east—of-the-Mississippian schools
have been somewhat behind their “younger” brothers to the
west but they are now carrying on the tradition. There is a
trend to hold this festive occasion on Washington’s birthday
in February, he being the ﬁrst American engineer, but the
St. Pat tradition still prevails.

Most of those “western” engineering schools have a week
of celebration ﬁlled with such events as ﬂoat parades, special
Church services, lab exhibits and open houses, barbecues and
parties, professional society meetings, beard growing contest,
tea parties, senior banquets, campus stunts, Engineers Carni-
vals, and last but not least, pre—election political rallies put
on by the candidates for St. Patricia, usually in the form of a
“cheesecake” show. St. Patricia is then crowned at the
Engineers’ Ball.

The big occasion for most of these schools (besides the
climaxing dance) is the arrival of St. Patrick dressed in green
and gold robes and sporting a beard which would put Rip
Van Winkle to shame.

IV

 

THE ARRIVAL OF ST. PAT is always a closely guarded
secret. and the mode of iransporfafion is usually a
novel arrangement ~

Each year he arrives by a different mode of transporta-
tion, using anything from an airplane to a steam shovel. His
favorite “carriage” is the railroad hand car. It is said that
back in 1914, the actual body of St. Patrick was resurrected
from his grave in Ireland and brought to the Iowa State
Celebration. After being carried around in a parade, St.
Patrick was called upon to make a speech to the students.
Since being interred for quite a few years and not upon the
latest talk, he was only able to say a few words, “I’m glad
to be here.”

On these occasions, St. Patrick is assisted by the Guard
of St. Patrick, 21 group of outstanding engineering students
who are tapped to this honorary society. Pledges to the
group are called “Squires,” and members of it are known
as “Knights.”

The Squires are initiated to the Guard of St. Patrick on
the evening of the Engineers’ Ball by being “knighted” with
a two foot slide rule by St. Patrick and they show their
faith by kissing the “Blarney Stone.”

Since the Squires are required to kiss the Blarney Stone
before they become Knights, the stone has caused no little
excitement in some of the universities.’ It seems that some
of the boys from froeign schools (any school other than

Engineering or Mines) have made strong attempts to steal
it from the Engineers. But under the protection of the
Squires, it has been kept out of mischievous hands.

A ﬁne thing about these weeks is the fact that all the
students take part in the week, and at least 50 percent of
them are in on the planning of it or at work on the depart-
mental displays. That is what makes it what it is —an
Engineers’ Week.

At Pitt, Engineers’ Week was first observed in 1954.
Since then the annual celebration has become increasingly
larger in scope, until it is now one of the major events on
the University of Pittsburgh campus.

St. Patrick’s arrival is still one of the highlights of the
Week, and the mode of transportation is a closely guarded
secret until the time of arrival.

 

COMPETITION AMONG THE VARIOUS DEPART-
MENTS runs high during Engineers‘ Week.

Competition runs high during the week among the nine
engineering departments. By means of a point system, each
department accummulates a certain number of points for the
entire week which positions it a certain number of standard
deviations on one side or the other of the mean department.
The winning department is then chosen. The pvivnts are
awarded for participation in Engineers’ Week activities.
These activities include presentation of technical displays,
participation in the gimmick and attendance at various
activities throughout the Week.

No one has been able to keep track of just how many
vocal groups have been formed during the past few years.
It almost seems that where a new “Folk or pop-folk” song
has popped up to be sung there has popped up with it a
new singing group. Few of these groups have made it to
the top and most have disappeared as quickly as they ap-
peared. The Serendipity Singers, who will appear at Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial Hall during Engineers’ Week on
Saturday night, March 18, are the most successful singing
group to emerge on the national scene in recent years and
give every indication of remaining on top for many years
to come.

ﬁelds because they have emerged as more than just a folk-
singing group. They have built a full—fledged act and show
from what began as a bunch of kids sitting around with
guitars and singing folk songs. The group composes most
of their musical material and classify their exuberant and
vastly appealing sound as “pop-folk” which is rooted in pop
music but with full arrangements and instrumentation.
Their act incorporates the talents and styles of each individ-
ual and versatility has become a key—note with the group.

The Serendipity Singers are’: Tony Perry and Mike
Brovsky and Bob Young, who plays bass; twelve-string
guitarist Gamble Rogers; tenor guitarist Jon Arbenz; Iohn
Perry, tenor and guitarist; the two female performers, blonde
]oAnn Carey and brunette Lana Rae Shaw.

ENGINEERS’ WEEK THEME

THE CITY OF THE YEAR 2000

By lurry Benson

Our picture of 2000 A.D. will be a nation of 350 million

‘people, turning out four times today’s goods and services,

working less and playing more, at double today’s family in-
come. The average worker will have a thirty—one hour work
week with four weeks of vacation as the rule. There will
be three times as much travel and ﬁfteen times as many
families earning $20,000 a year and up.

The exploration of the future has been a sizable business.
General Electric has set up TEMPO (Technical Manage-
ment Planning Organization) in Santa Barbara, where two
hundred physical scientists, sociologists, economists and engi-
neers contemplate the future on a budget that tops $7 million
a year. The Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base
conducts studies of the whole problem of scientiﬁc predic-
tion and spends $15 million a year to look into the future.

There are also numerous privately supported organiza-
tions that are taking a look at the future. One of these is
Resources for the Future that is supported by the Ford
Foundation. Most of these forecasters use a computer to
produce a symbolic ‘model” of particular social or economic
structures — including whole industries or nations —— and
then stimulate the interaction of variables.

The recent flood of forecasts, all taken together presetn a
remarkable vision. Most convenient benchmark for that
vision is the year 2000, a rounded and romantic date that is
neared than is generally realized — only 33 years away.

Cities, like industry, will tend to decentralize; with in-
stant communications, it will no longer be necessary for
business enterprises to cluster together. Some forsee the
possibility that many people will stay at home, doing their
work via country—wide telecommunications.

In general the experts expect regional shifts of population
to continue in recent patterns, though they predict a gradual
tapering off of these changes toward the end of the century.
The basic trend for the coming decades thus is for popula-
tion to grow fastest on the seacoasts and the industrial com-
plex bordering the Great Lakes. Using the middle range of
population-growth estimates, the experts report 41 million
people in California by 2000 A.D. New .York is shown with
29 million by then and Florida almost triples to 14.6 million

people. Moving of Americans into metropolitan areas also '

is expected to continue, with 71% of the population living
in urban areas by the year 2000.

Central cities, rather than suburbs, may become dominate
in growth if mass transis and urban-renewal projects are
pushed. Experts ﬁnd a trend to in-town living a deﬁnite
possiblility for upcoming decades. As suburbs grow and
spread out from central cities, entire areas even now are
merging together to form the built up area called a
“megalopolis”. An example cited: the 500 mile coastal
stretch from northern Virginia to southern New Hampshire.
Similar developments are underway around the Great Lakes
and on the West Coast.

Modern planners have three basic concepts of future cities
that they call Instant Communities, (2) Megastructures,
(3) Platform Cities.

Proponents of the Instant Communities are constructing
complete new towns in the open countryside, close enough
to the orbit of an existing large city for the new towns to
serve in effect as city satellites. Far from being mere bed-
room communities ,however, these new towns will build in
all the basic elements of a self—contained community — places
to live, to work, to shop, to learn and to ﬁnd recreation.
They aim to restore a richness to urban life, using such
devices as connected town houses and town buildings of
modest height which are neatly grouped in village—size
clusters, permitting signiﬁcant numbers of people to live
together. I

The thinkers who look to Megastructures see an exciting
bulk solution to the more monstrous problems of today’s
cities. Struck by the contrast between clogged city streets

and the high internal eﬂiciency of large automatic-elevator
office buildings, several architectural planners have suggested
designing new buildings big enough to qualify as self—con-
tained cities. Using a linear design, they could utilize im-
proved transportation techniques to get people and parcels
from one point to another within the long complex.

The third major concept in future urban design, the Plat-
form City, aims most directly at alleviating the degradation
of an asphalt-and—concrete existence. It can be grafted into
existing cities or used in combination with either the Instant
Community or the Megastructure. In the Platform City the
apparent “ground level” of whole towns — and in larger
cities the central business districts, at very least — would be
given over entirely to green landscapes and to uncluttered
sidewalks. All or most buildings would be erected on stilts;
all or most streets would be tucked “underground” cavernous
areas_ beneath the gardened platform.

The Platform City thus represents the first realistic chal-
lenge to the encroachment of the automobile on our society.
Autos could be shuttled into the underground parking areas,
their drivers traveling by escalator or ramps onto the beauti-
ful plateau which stretches through the city’s airy Mega-
structures or to smaller Instant Community buildings. Fur-
ther, there is a large consolation to the plan: essential con-
duit lines like sewers, power cables, phone lines, and
waterpipes could be stretched along concealed roadways,
easily accessible for maintenance.

None of the forecasters seem to have any good solution
for the traﬂic problem, though they count on automated and
possibly underground highways. Planes carrying one thousand
passengers and ﬂying just under the speed of sound will be
years old by the turn of the century. The new thing will be
transport by ballistic rocket, capable of reaching any place on
earth in forty minutes. Many scientists agree that a per-
manent lunar base will have been established long before
2000 A.D. and that men will have flown past Venus and

have landed on Mars.

The closer inner space, the ocean will be even more
radically transformed. Experts visualize ﬁsh herded and
raised in offshore pens as cattle are today. Huge ﬁelds of
kelp and other kinds of seaweed will be tended by undersea
“farmers” — frogmen who will live for months at a time in
submerged bunkhouses. The protein—rich underseas crop
will probably be ground up to produce a dull-tasting cereal
that eventually could be regenerated chemically to taste like
anything from steak to bourbon.

One of the most dramatic changes will be climate control.
Scientists estimate that the entire electrical energy needs of
the U. S. could be supplied by a dozen nuclear generating
stations spotted around the country, each with a capacity on
the order of 60,000 megawatts. If one such station. were built
on Mt. Wilson above Los Angeles, the heat produced as a
by—product would be guided into the atmosphere, raising
the inversion layer that hangs over Los Angeles to 19,000
feet, thus ridding the city of smog. A sea breeze could be
drawn into the space beneath, bringing rains that would
transform the high desert between Los Angeles and Las
Vegas into a flowering land.

As a conclusion to this brief look at the city of 2000 A.D.,
I believe that the next 33 years hold more engineering
potentials and problems than any other period of time in
the history of the world. As. proof of how very little progress
we have made in certain areas in the development of our
society, I cannot help but think of the simple problem of
garbage disposal. One thousand years ago people often
threw their garbage into the streets. Now we put it in cans
and carry it to the streets.

ENGINEERING
STUDENT
CABINET — —

So Whaf?

By
Dennis
Ramsier

36

Many students and also faculty have from time to time
questioned the “why?” of the Engineering Student Cabinet
—— and for good reason. However, anyone who has looked
into what Cabinet has done this year is not justiﬁed in
asking this question. The purpose of this article is to present
to you the student body, to you the faculty, and to you the
administration some of the things that have been accom-

plished by this year’s Cabinet.

As it is to be expected, some of the policies of this year’s
Cabinet were but continuations of the policies of previous
Cabinets. The planning of Engineers’ Week presents many
headaches not only for the Central Planning Committee, but
also for Cabinet, as it is charged with the responsibility of
making the Shamrock Ball arrangements. This year the
arrangements were aptly coordinated by our very capable,
Playboy Man—on—Campus, social chairman Laird Varzaly.
All those who attend the Ball this year will find the accom—
modations, the Churchill Valley Country Club, inviting and
the music provided by the Walt Harper Quintet simply

great.

Money-wise, Cabinet has done quite well. Combining
the money obtained from the vending machines in the
lounge and allocations, Cabinet this year, as in the four pre-
vious years, will present a 1500 check to the Oﬂice of Student
Aid which is applied to a loan fund for engineering students.
Also this year, a concert has been added to Engineers’ Week
and the price of a ticket for both the concert and the Sham-
rock Ball is no more than the cost of last year’s Ball ticket
alone——$4.00; if only the concert is attended, a donation of
$1.00 per person will be charged. And again this year
Cabinet will choose an ESCITT awardee and present him
with a check for 35500 to help cover the cost of travel to and
from Europe, where he will be employed as a summer trainee
with a ﬁrm employing engineers.

But this year’s cabinet has broken from the past in a
number of ways. If I had to choose a term that would best
describe this year’s Cabinet, I would pick “involvement” —
involvement in academic questions, in social questions, in
athletics, in politics. I think this has led to a more uniﬁed
engineering body, in which participaton and communcation
have been encouraged more than ever before.

This year Cabinet has taken an interest in campus politics
and had no less than six of its members running for Student
Government with four of them being elected — Al Nauda,
Larry Benson, Frank Tutino, and Ioe Folk. And speaking
of Ioe Folk, this year he, as editor, has actually gotten the
Bulletin out on a regular schedule. Also this year, after a
poor to mediocre and back to poor again football season, the
basketball league has flourished in the capable hands of our
sports chairman, Kent Weitzel and the chairman from the
various departments. Moreover, Cabinet is sponsoring a con-
test for the design of a new emblem for the School of
Engineering with Dean Hoelscher offering a $25.00 prize
for the winning entry. The entries are to be on standard
size paper and submitted to Room 201, Engineering Hall,

no later than 15 March 1967.

I‘ -«<-"“‘ "““ . ‘\

Cabinet, itself, has been involved to a great extent in
academic questions of great importance. As a group, we
meet with Dean Hoelscher and Associate Dean Turkes
about once per month. At this time new ideas, old gripes
are brought up. Two of the most notable things brought
up in our last meeting with the Dean were the possibility
of a pass—fail course program, such as that being studied in
the School of Liberal Arts and the possibility of the School
of Engineering following the Liberal Arts example and
starting to average original grades with repeated course
grades in the computation of the students’ QPA. The
Cabinet made strong stands in both areas by coming to the
meeting with two ﬁrm proposals. The Dean received both
the proposals quite well and promised a great deal of con-
sideration would be given them. (These proposals can be
found at the end of this article.) Two other projects are

now underway under the direction of several Cabinet Com-
mittees. Working closely with the faculty, we are in the
process of setting up a ﬁling cabinet in the library to house
copies of all the old tests professors permit their students
to keep. This will serve as a study guide for all the students
in engineering. Also under consideration and in early stages
of planning is an honor system.

So, as you can see, Cabinet, this year, has not been a
group bound by tradition only. We have initiated many
new programs which we hope will become permanent fea-
tures of Cabinet. But, if anything, it is our hope that we
have encouraged and increased the involvement of student
groups in the policy making of the School and individual
involvement on the part of each and every student to
promote a more uniﬁed and vital student body.

grade “F” will be recorded.

ENGINEERING CABINET PROPOSALS

Pass- Fail Option: School of Engineering

Upperclass students are encouraged to entend their general educational
experience and to supplement their majors with more challenging and complex
courses in disciplines removed from their areas of their primary concentration.
Students with a minimum of 64 credits who are in good academic standing
may, therefore, elect two courses (maximum of one per term) in which the
only grade assigned will be pass or fail. These courses will carry credit towards
graduation, but will not be used to compute the student’s quality point average.
The student may select courses from among those designated as Liberal Arts
Electives (Social Science or Humanities elective) or Technical Electives, with
no more than one Technical elective taken on this basis.

The student who elects the Pass—Fail Option must designate the course
to which it applies at the time of registration for :1 given term. Once registra-
tion has been completed, this designation cannot be changed unless the student
wishes to drop the course completely for that term, in which case he will be
subject to the regulations governing withdrawal.

Instructors will not know which students have elected their courses on a
Pass-Fail basis and will report a quality grade in the cusotmary manner to the
Office of Student Records. At that point, if the grade is “D” or above, it will
be recorded as “P.” On the other hand, if the student failed the course, the

INDUSTRIAL MATHEMATICS:

THE NEED AND THE CHALLENGE

By E. L. Wachspress

Mr. Wachspress, who joined KAPL 13 years ago, has
been a mathematician with The Laboratory’: Advanced De-
velopment Activity, specializing in numerical analysis for
reactor physics computations. A graduate in mechanical
engineering from Cooper Union, he holds a master's degree
in mathematics from Union College and is completing work
toward his doctorate at RPI. Mr. Wachspress is active in
professional society work and is the author of the recently
published ”Iterative Solution of Elliptic Systems." The pub-
lication, planned primarily as an industrial and college ref-
erence source, describes the use of iterative methods for
solving elliptic systems with digital computers.

40

It would be helpful indeed if we could apply an erudite
forecasting technique to the problem of identifying those
areas of applied mathematics that will present the greatest
challenge during the next decade. Such a forecast would not
only supply valuable information, but would illustrate
the man-machine interaction primarily responsible for the
widening role of mathematics in our society.

The acute shortage of industrial mathematicians makes
such a study impracticable —— there are other, more pressing
needs for their abilities. But we can hypothesize the results
of such a study by reviewing the pattern of industrial mathe-
matics over the past decade and projecting that pattern
against the future, recognizing our forecasting limitations
and the unpredictability of embryonic ﬁelds.

While the specifics that we discuss are revealing in them-
selves, they also identify overall trends such as the increasing
need for processing large volumes of complex information
through high-speed computers and for developing technolo-
gies to solve increasingly complex problems on machines
that are becoming ever more versatile.

The increased realization of contributions made by mathe-
maticians through computer applications has‘ greatly accel-
erated the demand for mathematical talent in industry. As
a result, manpower in this burgeoning ﬁeld is at a premium;
universities everywhere are expanding their facilities to meet
this demand.

University courses provide the foundation upon which a
mathematician builds according to his specialized interests.
Calculus, ordinary and partial differential equations, com-
plex and real variables, algebra, functional analysis, vector
analysis, matrix theory, computer programming and mathe-
matics of computation, probability and statistics, transform
theory, and survey-type courses on methods in applied mathe-
matics and mathematical physics are among the more im-
portant prerequisites. However, formal training does not
end upon graduation; thereafter it is just more dependent
upon the endurance of the individual. The Master’s or
Doctoral thesis is often the springboard into a specific area;
the student should be advised to choose his topic carefully
— one that may lead to years of fascinating and rewarding
research as well as increasingly more challenging job
assignments.

Many of the mathematical developments during the past
decade are the result of demands in the “new” sciences, such
as space and nuclear energy. In the latter ﬁeld, many achieve-
ments in applied mathematics have evolved from analytical
work in the design of nuclear reactors.

Boundary—value problems such as those encountered in
determining stresses, fluid flow, heat and neutron distribution

in nuclear reactors, and a variety of phenomena have re-
quired extensive development of new techniques for solving
linear and nonlinear, ordinary and partial differential equa-
tions in great number and degree of complexity.

Industrial mathematicians have been more concerned
with solving such problems than with following the tradi-
tional academic approach of developing existence and unique-
ness proofs. The need for immediate answers encourages the
former approach but does not minimize the latter; periodi-
cally a new theoretical result changes the outlook on an entire
class of problems.

Variational principles have played a signiﬁcant role, both
in problem formulation and in numerical solution. Dis-
cretization of continuous problems to enable approximate
solution by computerized ﬁnite difference techniques has
been accompanied by existence, uniqueness, and convergence
analyses, all requiring a wide background in basic mathe-
matics. Integral equation formulations are possible for these
boundary-value problems and have stimulated development
of many techniques such as the Wiener-Hopf method.

The Monte—Carlo technique is developing into a powerful
tool for solving otherwise intractable problems, such as the
frequently occurring statistical problems and stochastic pro-
cesses. Because of unresolved problems related to mathema-
tical techniques for variance reduction, however, the efficiency
of Monte-Carlo computations can be greatly enhanced.

Classical eigenfunction expansion methods for approxi-
mating solutions to complex systems have been embellished
by assorted schemes such as the Case—Wigner singular eigen-
function method.

The theory of approximation encompasses many ﬁelds of
mathematics and provides a basis for analysis of the relative
merits of alternatives for solving physical problems. Con-
cepts such as those encountered in functional analysis appear
highly abstract but actually have wide applicability to
numerical analysis.

The spectrum of training for industrial mathematics is
quite broad; i.e., we ﬁnd that engineering or physics, at the
other end of the spectrum from abstract mathematics, is
extremely valuable to an industrial mathematician for the
obvious reason that his major concern is mathematical for-
mulation and solution of engineering and physics problems.
During the past decade, the need for engineers with greater
proﬁciency in mathematics and physics has contributed to
the expansion of graduate engineering curricula in the
universities.

This demand for scientists and the expansion of facilities
for their training will surely continue. Modern trends in
mathematics have been greatly influenced by the development
of the computer. Until quite reecntly, most industrial mathe-
maticians were concerned with speciﬁc engineering and
physics applications, and their contributions were severely
restricted by the limitations of the computational equipment
available. Analytical solutions, obtained only for idealized
cases, served mainly as guides for designers and experi-
menters. Today, computers have increased tremendously the
industrial mathematician’s stature as well as the signiﬁcance
of his contribution; computer-implemented analysis now
supplants experiment in many areas.

The rapidly expanding capabilities of computers, making
feasible hitherto impossible computations, enhance the posi-
tion of the mathematician, who is indispensable for eﬂicient
utilization and operation of a computer.

Several distinct computer-oriented disciplines coexist in
industry today. In order to use a computer, the mathe-
matician must be able to communicate with it. He may
manipulate symbols meaningful to the computer, design
languages by means of which he can converse more freely,
and develop logical formalisms which facilitate programming
of speciﬁc problems. His contribution is known as computer
software. Highly abstract areas of mathematics, including
modern algebra and symbolic logic, provide tools for the
software designer. An informative reference on this aspect
of modern industrial mathematics is Volume 1 of the Pro-
ceedings of the International Federation of Information Pro-
cessing Societies (IFIPS) Congress, 1965, which discusses the
impact of computers on society and the role of the mathe-
matician in designing means for communicating with them.

Yesterday’s industrial mathematician has joined forces
with today’s numerical analysts whose primary function is
to formulate mathematical techniques for solving physical
problems. Sometimes the mathematician can solve the prob-
lem analytically, for he has some rather powerful techniques
at his disposal, but more often he must rely upon the com-
puter. That the computer has not decreased the importance
of classical analysis, but has stimulated its use, is somewhat
paradoxical. If one has analyzed a problem, or class of prob-
lems with similar principles, and has reached an impasse,
one now has recourse to a numerical analysis as elegant as
its classiﬁed antecedent.

This technique is in its infancy, and a creative mathe-
matician can contribute much to growth of the technology.
Each succeeding generation of computers has so many new
characteristics requiring advanced mathematical techniques
that the challenge to the creative mathematician is assured
for years to come.

One example of this challenge is in the solving of equa-
tions that describe the diffusion of neutrons within a reactor.
KAPL has been among the pioneers in this ﬁeld. Millions
of unknowns occur in some studies, and computation strategy
depends strongly upon the data—handling capabilities of the
computer. Mathematical procedures that involved the least
amount of data-processing were best for computers with
relatively slow data-processing. Improved computer designs
are shifting the emphasis to techniques that require the
least number of arithmetic operations. There is an optimum
balance between calculation and data-processing for each
computer. This balance appears superﬁcially to involve little
if any creative mathematics, but the underlying theory for
each scheme may be quite involved and the analysis is far
from routine.

Math students considering industrial employment should
scan some of the mathematics journals (the abundance of
which, incidentally, demonstrates the impetus given to
mathematics by the computer) to fully appreciate problems

Bill Callihan, a junior chemical engineer, is the intel-

ligent winner of the Ianuary Skycapers. Bill’s home is in
Iohnstown, Pa., where his many interests include sport cars,
drag racing, and tennis. Bill stated that it took him from
11/Z-2 hours to actually work the six problems. Bill felt that
these weren't exactly hard but the most diﬂicult one was
number two which required drawing four straight lines
through a square of nine dots. In Bill’s opinion,” I really
enjoyed the contest. The monetary prize was nice but I
really worked the problems for the fun of it.”

What’s

New In

Engineering

Clark Equipment Company’s Brown Trailer Division
has begun delivery of 1,000 sea—going containers —— with a
total capacity of 44,800,000 pounds.

The containers, 20 feet long and eight feet wide and high,
are among the ﬁrst to be built to new American Standards
Association structural standards. Each has a payload of 20
long tons — 44,800 pounds.

46

Designed for stacking six high in vertical cells in ships’
holds, each container will support up to 224,000 pounds with
safety to structure and contents.

Purchase of the steel—and—aluminum units is a part of
United States Lines’ long—range program for expanding its
containerization services. The company operates 45 cargo
ships with an aggregate displacement of some 530,000 dead-
weight tons in both domestic and international ports.

 

General Electric has unveiled a new silicone roof coating.
A liquid silicone rubber, the material is applied like paint
from a roller and solidiﬁes to a lightweight elastic rubber
membrane thate stays permanently ﬂexible. A primary fea-
ture of the new silicone is its resistance to weathering. Two
coats give an average thickness of 22 mils. Life expectancy
could exceed 30 years.

Characteristic of silicones, the new material can be easily
applied at all temperatures at which a man can work. It re-
mins liquid down to —65°F, and has equally good resistance
to heat — molten solder does not harm it. A membrane
made of the material “breathes” to allow internal moisture
to escape while it keeps exterior water out.

The new material has been under development for more
than four years. One of the early developmental applications
was on the domed General Electric Pavilion at the 1964 -
1965 New York World’s Fair where it was applied over a
plywood deck. The material has since seen successful
service on more than 200 developmental applications on
buildings from the Virgin Islands to New England.

On the General Electric pavilion roof, it covered a 200’
diameter dome consisting of 2200 sheets of plywood sealed
together with a silicone sealant. In the Virgin Islands, where
it is desirable to utilize roofs to gather rainwater, the mate-
rial has aroused great interest. A large number of successful
applications were completed there during the test period.
The success of these applications indicates considerable
potential for use in a similar manner in water—short areas of
the world.

Silicone Rubber is the most durable of all elastomers. It
is believed, therefore, that this characteristic of silicone rub-
ber roof coatings to retain their properties for many years
will make possible roofs requiring less maintenance. How-
ever, if silicone roofs do receive any physical damage, they
can be quickly repaired by rolling on fresh material.

The new material permits construction economies, while
at the same time adapting itself to roofs of any conﬁguration.
It can be applied in fewer man-hours per 100 square feet
than any other rooﬁng system. Applied either by brush or
paint roller, it goes on in fewer, thicker coats than any other
liquid rooﬁng system. Because the material contains rela-
tively little evaporating solvent (silicone cures by chemical
reaction rather than solvent evaporation), there is minimal
shrinkage during set up.

The lower weight of silicone rooﬁng, compared to most
commonly used rooﬁng materials, can also reduce building
costs. The high reflectance of white silicone rooﬁng reduces
air conditioning costs. Unlike asphalt/felt/gravel systems,
additional application savings come from unique handling
characteristics of the material — low material weight and
volume to lift and handle and from the simple application
methods.

The ability of the material to “breathe” while at the same
time exhibiting very low water absorption is unique among
many coatings. This high water vapor permeability permits
moisture to escape without causing blisters. The excellent
adhesion to properly primed surfaces is not aﬁfected by
temperature or extremes or age.

The materials can be used over concrete decks (rein-
forced, thin shell or precast slabs) regardless of slope and
over exterior plywood decks with slopes of 1/,” per foot or
more. They are not recommended for use over light—weight
ﬁlls or gypsum decks.

The new material may also be engineered to ﬁt speciﬁc
requirements, such as over wood plank decks and some types
of insulation. The material cost of the coating is approxi-
mately 55 cents per square foot. Although this is higher
than many conventional materials, the applied cost on new
construction will in many instances be less and long range

costs are expected to be considerably reduced due to the low

year—to-year maintenance.

The problem: To provide maximum blast protection to
liquid hydrogen and 10x tank shutoff valves during rocket
engine test operations. Conventionally placed valves are fre-
quently damaged during test operations resulting in ﬁres
caused by valve leakage.

The solution: An “in—tank” shutoff valve that is installed
with the valve poppet and actuator inside the tank.

How it's done: The Valve is installed directly at the tank
'outlet ﬂange with the valve poppet and actuator inside the
‘tank. Special seals are utilized because of the cryogenic ﬂuids
‘surrounding the actuator. The valve is constructed with a
vertical rising poppet contained in a cage housing permitting

and the valve seat is capable of complete shutoff under most

The problem: To match the How of air to a supersonic jet
aircraft engine with the instantaneous requirements of thrust
and eﬂiciency imposed on the engine. Properties of the air
ﬂow vary widely, especially as to density and pressure, with
aircraft speed and altitude and with atmospheric variations.

The soluiion: Modiﬁcation of a conventional jet engine
internal compression supersonic inlet that results in increased
shock stability and thus, engine instantaneous response to
changes in inlet air properties.

How H"s done: Reverse throat perforations are used to
change inlet performance to match the optimum engine per-
formance while allowing a variation in engine corrected
weight How. Reverse perforations in the throat region are
desirable because during operation at low pressure recoveries
with the “normal shock” downstream of the perforated
region, the supersonic flow is not easily diverted to go
through reverse perforation and the loss in flow is small.
Alternately, during operation at high pressure recoveries
with the “normal shock” located in the region of the per—
forations, the reverse flow portion of the boundary layer is
aligned in the direction of the perforations and is also at a
higher static pressure so more How is bled oﬁ‘.

  Worksfor your development.

When you've been around in aerospace
for as long as we have (from Kitty Hawk
to Cape Kennedy) you pick up some
pretty sound ways of developing ad-
vanced ideas. And careers. You have to,
if you're going to keep staying on top.
Here's how we do it at Curtiss-Wright.
In the first place, when you join our
staff you pick the work areas you'd like
to try on for size, choosing from 1) gas
turbines 2) rotating combustion (Wankel)
engines 3) missile and space propulsion
4) advanced energy conversion—if it's the
guts of aerospace, odds are we're work-
ing on it. You start off in one engineering
discipline, choosing from among design,
development, testing or analytical engi-

neering. And you also choose the product
line you'd like to try. After three months
of work you get three full weeks of con-
centrated classroom lectures and prob-
lem solving sessions led by our senior
engineers. Then you can try your hand
on a second, a third, even a fourth dis-
cipline, and each time we sit down with
you and evaluate how you stack up in the
field. By the time you're ready to make
up your mind you've built the foundation
for a broad and diversified background.
For another thing, we encourage you
to expand your education after you've
picked your field, to increase your abili-
ties, keep up with latest developments,
prepare for greater responsibility. And
our liberal tuition refund plan will help
see you through some of the nation's fin-
est schools, including: Stevens, Brooklyn
Polytech, Rutgers, Columbia, N.Y.U.,
Newark College of Engineering, all easy
to get to from our location in Wood-Ridge,
New Jersey. ’
You'll be working in a suburban area
rich in history, chock full of the whole
range of sports and recreation,-with a
company-maintained club tailored to out-

door living. And you're minutes away
from New York's culture and entertain-
ment.

When you interview the Curtiss-Wright
recruitment engineer ask him about the
many other rewards you can find with a
company which has led the field since
the very birth of aviation.

currently under investigation. This suggestion is not directed
only to potential industrial mathematicians; university pro-
fessors often obtain research grants for work in the same
area in which industrial mathematicians are active. Con-
versely, many industrial mathematicians remain close to the
universities — lecturing, attending seminars and advanced
courses, and exchanging ideas with the university staffs.

If computer language and utilization will be major prob-
lems for tomorrow’s industrial mathematicians, so also will
be computer management. Available resources for the mathe-
matical formulation and solution of physical ‘problems are
so limited that a manager must select very carefully those
problems for which he thinks analysis will be most fruitful.
Since a significant percentage of the budget of a research and
development operation may be allotted to numerical com-
putation on one or more computers, decisions affecting use
of these machines are among the most critical faced by
management. Furthermore, as computer development con-
tinues, the relative merits of these new units must be con-
stantly evaluated to determine the optimum point for
replacing or supplementing a unit. Such aspects of computer
work present demanding, highly specialized management
challenges; the increasing value of managers with technical
backgrounds is evidenced by an upsurge in the number of
managers with advanced degrees in the physical sciences.

More intricate technology is a natural consequence of
progress, and specialization is essential for effective imple-
mentation of this technology. The analyst who develops the
mathematical model for a physical problem and the basic
methodolgy for its solution may not prepare his equations
for machine computation. Similarly, software developers
are often involved with long-range planning of computer
language and programming techniques and are seldom ex-
pected to transcribe speciﬁc equations into a form acceptable
to the computer.

It is rather the task of the programmer to translate mathe-
matical formulations of physical problems into machine
language for numerical solution. His contribution is one of
placing programs at the disposal of engineers and physicists
so that they need only supply data in some standard form
to obtain solutions to specific problems as they arise.

Program accuracy is paramount; a great responsibility is
imposed on the programmer since an undetected program
error may yield wrong answers to complex problems upon
which important design decisions are based. The cost of
digital computation is high; even higher is the cost of
erroneous computation in an age when printed computer
output is all too readily accepted as fact.

We have described the need for capable applied mathe-
maticians, cited a few of the development areas of recurrent
interest, and assessed the computer as a stimulant to diverse
activity in applied mathematics. Throughout this discussion,
I have focused on one point: today the computer is a domi-
nant force in industrial mathematics; in the next decade it
will be an even more dominant force — evoking a challenge
that will encourage the very best kind of creative mathematics.

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF WOMEN

Atomic Weig/zt: Reputed to be 120. Isotopes are known
through 90 to 180.

Occurrence: Found both free and combined. In combined
state it is found with man.

Physical Properties: All colors, sizes and shapes. Seldom
found in the pure state. Boils at nothing and will freeze
without reason. Surface is usually covered with film of paint
or oxide in various colors and depths. Unpolished specimen
turns green in presence of highly polished one. All varieties
melt if used correctly. Density is not so great as generally
supposed.

Chemical Properties: Highly explosive and dangerous in
unexperienced hands. Extremely active in the presence of
men. Possesses great affinity for gold, silver, platinum and
all precious stones. Has the ability to absorb great quantities
of expensive food and drink. May explode spontaneously
when left alone with man. Fresh variety has great magnetic
attraction but ages rapidly.

Uses: Chieﬂy experimental. Ei‘I'lCIC1'1t cleaning agent. Acts
as a positive or negative catalyst in "the production of fevers.
Unsolved Problem: The thing that mystiﬁes many engineers
is the fact that the most streamlined specimens offer the

Bechtel today is the outgrowth of a family construc-
tion business established in 1898. During its early years,
it played an important role in the development of the
West, participating in such projects as Hoover Dam and
the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Headquarters
are in San Francisco, with major offices in various cities
of the world.

Activities are geared principally to the requirements
of such basic industries as petroleum, petrochemicals,
chemicals, natural gas, electric and nuclear power, min-
ing, ore processing and metallurgy, food and paper, ce-
ment and other heavy industrial plants — and to land use
and development. In the public sector, the firm is active
in water use and conservation, rapid transit, and the
missile and space program.

Project responsibility is assigned to one of eight
operating divisions or to a specialized scientific depart-
ment. The divisions are Power & Industrial; Hydro &
Transportation; Mining & Metals; Refinery & Chemical;
Pipeline; International Power, Industrial & Metals; Inter-
national Petroleum & Chemical, and Vernon, California.
The Scientific Development Department provides service
to clients directly and also works closely with the com-
pany’s operating divisions.

Engineering offices are located in San Francisco, Los
Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C., Houston,
Montreal, London, Paris, The Hague, and Melbourne.

Bechtel keeps pace with the growing body of scientific
knowledge in all its areas of interest. The company will,
in the future, continue to meet the requirements of its
clients in a rapidly advancing world, with emphasis on
work of magnitude, complexity, and challenge.

SPECIAL FEATURES AND ATTRACTIONS

As Bechtel continues to grow, its responsibilities in-
crease, providing capable employees with opportunities
for advancement with commensurate financial rewards
and personal satisfaction. Bechtel has two separate plans
which enable eligible full-time technical and adminis-
trative employees to participate in the company's suc-
cess: the Trust Plan and the Thrift Plan. Contributions
to the Trust Plan are made entirely by the company.
Participation in the Thrift Plan includes contributions
made by employees together with a percentage matching
amount by the company on a regular basis.

The Bechtel Group Insurance Plan combines high-
limit hospital, surgical, and extended major medical
benefits with liberal life insurance coverage for employ-
ees and their families.

All the company's major offices are located in areas
offering outstanding opportunities for cultural, recrea-
tional, and educational activities.

Bechtel is a large and dynamic organization. It is
highly competitive in the best sense of the word. An em-
ployee’s future with the company is up to him. Increased
responsibility, accompanied by higher pay, depends upon
the combination of appropriate openings and the individu-
al’s demonstrated ability to move ahead. Increasing
knowledge and effectiveness through participation in pro-
fessional societies, business study groups, and evening
classes can improve one’s readiness to assume more
responsibility.

“Industry has gone a long way toward satisfying those human
needs which can be reached through money, beneﬁts, and security.
The future points to the job itself through improved job design
as a source of increased performance and satisfaction.”

That’s what we say in a new paper coming out of
Building 56. It relates the job design function of the
industrial engineer to the sciences that study human
behavior. Such a paper would not have come out of a
company where top management is less than sold on
the beneﬁts of leading the ﬁeld in applying the most
advanced concepts in industrial engineering no less
than in chemical, mechanical, or electrical engineer-
ing. We have a balance sheet to prove that our man-
agement knows which way is up.

Industrial engineers can come into Building 56
either from college, from graduate school, from mili-
tary service, or from a well-reasoned decision that
their present employment is not what they want for
the long haul.

Once in and with a little time gone by, choice con-
fronts a good industrial engineer. Does he want to

The world’s foremost center

There it is. Would you like to work there?

remain an industrial engineer and enjoy a status in his
profession that may be more difﬁcult to attain for in-
dustrial engineers who practice under conditions less
favorable than prevail at Kodak? Or do multiple re-
gression technique and mathematical model building
and behavioral research mean less to him than swing-
ing over to one of Building 56’s intramural clients and
there starting his way up to where the whole mighty,
fascinating, and gloriously diversiﬁed ship is steered?

The fact that parallel choices have to be made by
those who join us as chemical, mechanical, or elec-
trical engineers will not be mentioned here for lack
of space.

We’d be honored to have a note about yourself.
