be overcome by using the new technique of transmitting the
light through hollow pipes or "wave-guides" much the same
way as is sometimes done with microwaves. We might
just end up replacing all those telephone wires now connect-
ing cities by pipes.
  Straight line of sight communication, i.e. the sending and
receiving stations are visible to one another, is usually im-
practical, but for coming space communication it will be
just the thing since space is relatively "clean" and a laser
beam can be made so narrow that it could cover great
distances without losing much intensity. In addition, it
would be difficult for unwanted parties to listen in on a laser
beamed message without them being directly in the path of
the beam.

other hand, have very high frequencies and thus very short
wave-lengths, which makes it nearly impossible to send
them around objects since the light waves will be reflected
off an object rather than diffracted around it.
   Using light waves as an information carrying medium
does have its advantages. For communication purposes,
each light source need only occupy a very small portion of
the spectrum . This makes it possible to tune in and obtain
information from a desired source while filtering out all
other sources. Not to be overlooked are some limitations
of a light beam as a message carrier. A light beam is
easily blocked by fog, rain, and dust in the air. This might

       Radar, especially for space, is another possible use for
     lasers since their narrow beam with its short wavelength
     would make laser radar units hundreds of times more ac-

 M  agnetohydrodynamic power generation  is a     novel
 method of utilizing the induced electro-motive force prin-
 ciple. This principle can be stated as follows: if a con-
 ductor is passed through a magnetic field, an electrical cur-
 rent will be induced in the conductor according to the
familiar right hand rule. In this manner, mechanical energy
can be directly converted to electrical energy. This is, of
course, the method that is used to generate electrical power
for industry and the home owner.

energy used in this process is obtained by converting the
heat energy of a working fluid into mechanical energy by
the use of a turbine. The heat energy is obtained from
either chemical or nuclear fuels. As a result, there are four
steps in the process:
     (1) STORED ENERGY (from chemical or nuclear
          fuels)
     (2) THERMAL ENERGY (of the working fluid)
     (3) MECHANICAL ENERGY (the turbine)
     (4) ELECTRICAL ENERGY (at the generator)
   Since the MHD generator produces power by passing an
electrically conducting gas through a magnetic field, the
mechanical energy step is eliminated. This is so because
the working fluid and the conducting elements of the MHD
generator are the same. The three steps of the MHD
power process are:
     (1) STORED      ENERGY (from chemical or nuclear
          fuels)
     (2) THERMAL ENERGY (of the working fluid)
     (3) ELECTRICAL ENERGY (at the MHD genera-
          tor)
  Before an MHD generator can be successfully operated,
the gaseous working fluid must be ionized so that it will
become a conductor of electricity. If materials of low
ionization potential such as potassium or cesium are used to
seed the gas, adequate electrical conductivity will be ob-
tained provided the gas temperature is maintained above
35000 Fahrenheit. This necessary high temperature is
responsible for both the advantages and the disadvantages
associated with MHD generators. The most frequently
proposed use of the MHD generator is to include it in a
conventional heat-power cycle as a topping unit. In this
application, the exhaust heat of the MHD generator would

be used to heat the working fluid of the conventional part
of the cycle. The theoretical thermal efficiency of such a
cycle would be close to 60%. An efficiency of 60%  be-
comes more meaningful if we note that modern heat-power
plants have efficiencies in the neighborhood of 40% and
that a manufacturer who can make his cycle one percent
more efficient enjoys a great competitive advantage.
   MHD temperatures create a severe materials problem.
 There are only a few ceramic or refractory materials which
 can withstand these temperatures.
   Additional material requirements are reasonable re-
sistance to thermal shock, chemical and physical inertness,
and both thermal and electrical conductivity and resistivity.
Fortunately, there are no moving parts in the MHD genera-
tor and mechanical stresses are small. If the MHD genera-
tor is to become economically competitive, it must be
capable of operating for a period of days or weeks and have
a power output in the range of 100,000 KW. A consider-
able amount of research and development must be done
before these objectives are reached. Research of this type

is being carried out at the Westinghouse Research Labora-
tories. The operation of a sizeable MHD generator early
in 1960 was a notable achievement for two reasons. It was
the first time that the combustion gases of ordinary fuels
were used as the working fluid. It was also the first time
that an MHD generator operated for a period of minutes
instead of seconds. Dr. Stewart Way, a consultant at the
laboratories, is directing this research program.
  This particular MHD generator consists of a ceramic
lined, stainless steel, rectangular duct. The ceramic brick
lining is interlocked to prevent the brick from falling into the
gas stream in case of fracture. The internal dimensions of
the duct with the brick in place are 1 5/8 inches in the
horizontal or magnetic field direction and 4 7/8 inches in
the vertical or current flow direction. Three pairs of graphite
electrodes are situated in the top and bottom of the duct
along a length of 16 inches. The graphite elecrodes are
interlocked in place with the ceramic side wall brick. There-
fore the ceramic material separating each pair of electrodes
must be an electrical insulator otherwise the generator

would be short circuited internally. Very little resistivity
data is available for ceramic materials at high temperatures.
zirconia and magnesium oxide are two materials that have
been used for generator side walls. They are considered
insulators at ordinary temperatures, but at MHD tempera-
tures they become fairly good conductors. To maintain the
resistance of these materials in the generator a water cool-
ing tube was installed the full length of each side wall.
   The assembled MHD generator duct is supported on an
 angle iron frame about six feet above floor level. To provide
 the necessary magnetic field a large iron core electromagnet
 is used. The "C" shaped core of the magnet has an air
 ap of five inches and pole faces of seventeen by eighteen
 inches. The entire magnet, weighing seven tons, is mounted
 on motor-driven screw jacks so it can be raised to three
 feet above floor level. In the raised position the generator
 duct is centered in the air gap of the magnet for MHD
 power production. The magnet is lowered to floor level
 when it is necessary to disassemble or adjust the generator.
   Since the working fluid of this MHD generator is seeded
combustion gas, it was necessary to build a suitable com-
bustion system. A swirl-type combustion chamber, 3 1/2
inches in diameter and 12 inches in length was designed.
The combustor consists of four main parts; (1) the backing
plate containing the fuel nozzle, (2) an oxygen manifold
vith swirl slots, (3) the combustion tube and (4) the
ignitor. The fuel nozzle is of the dual flow type and both
propane and diesel fuel can be passed through it independ-
ently. The oxygen manifold is a hollow stainless steel ring
with slots arranged around its inside diameter. As the
oxygen enters the burner through these tangential slots, a
strong swirl action results and the walls of the combustion
tube are protected by a layer of cool gas. Another advan-
tage of swirl-type combustors is that they are extremely
  table burning and relatively insensitive to changes in fuel-
  oxidizer ratio. This feature is due to the low pressure area
  in the center of the combustor which is caused by the swirl.
  The heat output of the burner at design conditions is equiv-


alent to 5900 horsepower.
   As the combustion gas leaves the burner it enters a water
 cooled, ceramic-lined   mixing   section. Combustion    is
 completed within the mixer and a nozzle is located at the
 exit to straighten the gas flow as it enters the generator
 duct. After passing through the generator, the hot gas is
 exhausted to the atmosphere.
   Originally it was intended to exhaust into a water filled,
 500 gallon septic tank. The idea was that the water would
 muffle the sound and reduce it to a tolerable suburban
 level. When testing began, it was found that the sound
 was not of the objectional high-pitched roaring type and
 the muffler was never used. An added advantage of not
 using the muffler was that the exhaust could be directly
 observed for signs of generator or combustion irregularities.
   The fuel used in the combustion system is diesel oil with
 45 per cent potassium hexoate added for a seeding material.
 The oil flow rate is 0.265 lbs. per second. Oxygen is used
 at the rate of 0.6 lbs. per second. An additional 0.265
 lbs. per second of nitrogen is also introduced to reduce
 flame temperatures while maintaining a constant mass flow
 rate through the generator. The gas temperature is close
 to 5000'F. and a velocity of Mach no. 0.8 is reached in the
 generator.  Combustion chamber pressure is about 1.6
 atmospheres. A combustion system of this type can be
 rather dangerous so the complete MHD machine is located
 in an isolated shack lined with Tektum. The control room
 is located in a nearby garage where the interior of the
 shack can be observed on a closed circuit television monitor.
 Equipment in the control room includes a loading circuit
 with a set of voltage and current meters for each stage
 of the MHD generator. An adjacent panel contains pres-
 sure gauges for various points in the combustor, mixer and
 generator.  It also includes the flowrators and valves
 which control the diesel fuel system. All of these gauge
 readings are recorded photographically on 35 MM      film
 during an MHD run. Five temperature recorders are used
 to measure temperatures at various points in the machine
 and the ceramic brick. Both thermocouples and thermo-
 piles are used as sensing elements.
   Preparation for an actual MHD test begins several hours
 before actual power production. The seeded diesel oil has
 viscosity characteristics similar to residual fuel oil and the
 entire fuel system must be maintained at a high constant
 temperature to insure the proper flow rates. The seven-

ton magnet is raised until it encloses the generator. Then
an engineer in the control room and a technician in the
MHD shack check out the water cooling system. Com-
munication is maintained with the aid of an earphone set.
The next step is to start the warm up. Since the ceramic
material in the mixer and generator is sensitive to thermal
shock, the temperature must be brought up slowly. This is
done by burning propane and oxygen at very low    flow
rates. When combustion is initiated an ultraviolet sen-
sitive element turns on a signal light in the control room.
   Then the fuel and oxygen flow rates are set at one per-
 cent of full load conditions. When the temperature rise
 of the ceramic material levels out at the one percent level
 as indicated on the recorders, the combustion rate is in-
 creased to two percent and then to three percent of full
 load. During this time it is still reasonably safe for per-
 sonnel to remain in the MHD shack. Various last minute
 jobs are done at this time such as reversing thermocouple
 polarities and checking the oil and electrical systems. At the
 three percent combustion rate the ceramic materials ap-
 proach temperatures which are close to full load conditions.
 When this point is reached the MHD shack is evacuated
 and the seeded oil system is readied for the run. As soon
 as the diesel oil reaches the burner an operator increases
 the oxygen flow and the combustion rate is quickly brought
 up to full load conditions. Then the magnet is energized
 and MHD power production begins. The generator is run
 at full load conditions until all of the required data is
 obtained or a serious malfuntion occurs. Both fuel and
 oxygen systems are interlocked so that shutting down the
 fuel system also closes the oxygen valves. Immediately after
 shut down, nitrogen at low flow rates is passed through the
 combustor, mixer and generator to prevent the accumula-
 tion of any combustible or toxic gases.
    Measuring the power output of the generator is accom-
 plished by varying the settings of load resistors in the con-
 trol room.
   The power output of an MHD generator varies directly
 with the square of the magnetic field strength, so data
 is obtained for various magnet settings from 7,000 to 14,000
 gauss. The load resistance of each pair of generator elec-
 trodes is varied from infinity to zero ohms or from open
 circuit to short circuit. MHD generators act the same as
 fuel cells or batteries as far as an external load is con-
 cerned, so the familiar straight line curve of voltage versus
 current is obtained. This explains why maximum power

(VI) is obtained when the voltage is one half of the open
circuit voltage. Notice the power and V versus I curve.
It will also be evident that maximum power is produced
when the current is one half of the short circuit current.
It takes approximately one minute to vary the load
resistors through a complete sequence. Naturally this
procedure cannot be      followed  unless the   generator
runs are at least several minutes long. Actually the West-
inghouse generator has run for as long as nine minutes
continously with power being produced during the entire
test period. Peak power is produced only momentarily
when the magnet is set at 14,000 gauss and the load circuit
set so that voltage is one half of open circuit voltage.
However, maximum power could very well be generated
for the entire nine minute run because the amount of
power produced has negligible effect on the materials
within the generator.
   But a nine minute run would then be represented by
 only a single point on the power curve. The actual peak
 power output of this MHD generator has been 10.4 kilo-
 watts. This is a long way from an output of 100,000
 kilowatts, but the long running time possible with the
 Westinghouse MHD generator is a significant step forward.
 If progress continues at the present rate, MHD generators
 may be producing commercial electrical power earlier than
 the most optimistic predictions *

HEATING




                           By DONALD LONG


  With an eerie hum     of high-voltage equipment, many
  heating, drying, soldering, brazing, and annealing processes
  are now accomplished by high-frequency heating. This
  field is constantly expanding with new applications to high
  temperature heating of not only metals, but also many
fibers, wood, micarta, rubber, and plastics. Versatility
and portability are becoming key words to the rapid ex-
pansion in this field. First of all, you may ask just what is
high-frequency heating?
   There are two distinct processes classified under high-
 frequency heating, dielectric heating and induction heating.
 According to the definition set down by the National Elec-
 trical Manufacturers Association, dielectric heating is the
 heating of a nominally insulating material due to its own
 dielectric losses when the material is placed in a varying
 electrostatic field. The induction heating process, how-
 ever, is defined as the heating of a nominally conducting
material due to its own (I-squared) R losses, when the
material is placed in a varying electromagnetic field. The
basic differences then, which should be readily understood
in the following study of the two systems, are the fields
(electrostatic vs. electromagnetic), and the insulating and


    DONALD    R  LONG, second semester Freshman    in

SCRAPER but this is his first article. His interest in
electronics began with four years of successful competition
in the Bull Science Fair.


conducting properties of the work material. Besides these
basic differences, there are several other distinguishing
characteristib.  First, dielectric work demands relatively
high frequencies at approximately     30 megacycles per
second as compared to a range of 60 cps to 450 kilocycles
per second for typical induction work. Obviously, then,
the high-frequency generators employed are not the same.
   In dielectric heating, electronic tube oscillators are the
 only generators used. The high-frequency, high amplitude

 voltage output of the generator is impressed across two
 flat, metallic electrodes. The work is placed between
 these electrodes and heat is produced by the intense and
 rapid reversal of the electrostatic field on the work. This
 causes molecular stress, internal friction, and subsequent
 heating. A typical dielectric system has the work and the
 adjustable inductor forming a resonant circuit at the
 generator frequency. This produces maximum heating ef-
 ficiency. Thermal power requirements, or Btu's, for this
 process are determined by multiplying the mass of the
 material times its specific heat times the temperature rise
 in Fahrenheit degrees desired. The heating time is then de-
 termined for a specific sample by dividing the Btu's/min.
required by the output Btu's/min. of the machine. Quite
unlike the previously described dielectric method, the in-
duction method employs a high-frequency current traveling
through an induction coil, establishing an electromagnetic
field of flux lines around each turn of the coil. The work
material is placed within the coil or very close to it. As

generated flux from the coil and a resultant current attempts
to flow within the work in the opposing direction. The
natural resistance of the material to the flow of the induced
current creates heat. This is often referred to as eddy
current loss. Hysteresis is another heating effect produced
when a magnetic material is being subjected to a changing
flux, but it is of little significance in the overall heating
effect and will not be discussed. Whether the material
being  heated inductively is magnetic or non-magnetic
makes very little difference. For example, the ferrous metals
may be heated with high total efficiency. Graphite which
is not magnetic has a high electrical resistance favorable for
rapid heating.
   In an induction system the work is included as an in-
ductive load within a tank circuit which is made to re-
sonate with a tank capacitor at the corresponding genera-
tor frequency. The thermal and time calculations are ap-
proximately the same as in the dielectric method.
   Perhaps one of the most important factors influencing
the growing popularity of induction equipment is its amazing
versatility. Why is this true? To begin with, a purchaser
of an induction heating system has a choice of three differ-
ent generators, each with its respective advantages and dis-
advantages. The purchaser may also choose any one of
six standard styles of inductors or he may choose to have a
special one designed to fit his particular need. Let us
examine more closely the components and operation of
these induction systems.
    The simplest generator for induction work is the spark-

gap generator which produces a voltage wave having a
rather broad operating range.  The average operating
frequency is usually considered to be at 200 kilocycles per
second. Two variable inductors plus two variable capacitors
provide the electrical circuit constants which largely deter-
mine the..versatile operating frequency. The setting of the
spark-gaps also determines the frequency .and operating
efficiency. The spark-gaps should be set so that they dis-
charge at the peak voltage rise of the primary supply.
Resonance is achieved by means of a large drum-type in-
ductor and contact slider, and is read by maximum indica-
tion on an R. F. ammeter. Some of the typical applica-
tions of the spark-gap induction system are soldering,
brazing, heat-treating, and annealing. The three relative
advantages of the spark-gap system are: a) The circuitry

 is not complex, b) The simple equipment can be main-
 tained by low-skilled personnel, and c) The initial cost of
 equipment is low. Efficiency, however, is low and main-
 tenance is high because the spark-gaps, which are housed
 in a hard to reach location inside a water-cooled jacket,
pit and must be periodically replaced.
  A far more efficient generator for induction heating is
the motor-generator set with an efficiency rating on the
order of 85%. It has a lower frequency range (960-9600
cycles per second) than the spark-gap. The frequency of
the set is determined by the speed of rotation of the gene-
rator and also by the number of poles. The generator is
connected by mechanical coupling to a high speed motor.
A variable capacitor and the work inductor form a parallel
resonant circuit tuned to the generator frequency.
  Another element of versatility enters at this point of the

 discussion. Power ratings of these machines start at 30KW
 and range to 250KW. A purchaser who realizes the im-
 portance of getting just the right machine with the right
 capacity, is offered another of many flexible advantages of
 high frequency heating. To further stress the importance
 of having flexible, versatile equipment, rather than bulky
 stationary outfits, induction-heating sets now offer portable
 and semi-portable units of the motor-generator type. This
 allows movement of the equipment to preferential work
 areas rather than making the heater a stereotyped, preset
 function of an inline manufacturing process. A summary
 of the advantages of the motor-generator set is as follows:
 a) Maintenance is low, b) Efficiency is quite high, and
 c) Operating voltage is lower than either the spark-gap or
 tube-oscillator which reduces both operator hazard and
 necessary shielding.
   The final generator to be considered is the electronic-
tube-oscillator, which may be used either for dielectric or
induction work. The common operating frequency for this
type generator is 450 kilocycles per second. A three phase
rectifier is used to convert alternating current (60 cycles)
to high-amplitude direct current voltage. Mercury vapor
rectifier tubes are used in the rectifier and are generally
grid controlled to provide a variable d-c output. Oscilla-
tion is sustained by a Hartley type oscillator. A peculiarity
of the electronic-tube-oscillator is that it does not operate
through a heating cycle on a "fixed frequency." The fre-
quency of the unit is determined in part by the resistivity
and permeability of the work material. These two factors
change according to the temperature of the material and
thereby change the inductive load and, correspondingly,
the frequency. This variable frequency is usually moni-
tored by use of a small, inexpensive portable absorption
wavemeter. Adjustments are then made on the machine
by conveniently tuning an internal tank coil. The effi-
ciency (50%) of the electronic-tube-oscillator is not as
high as the motor-generator. However, the tube-oscillator is
more versatile and can be used in a broader range of appli-
cation due to the expanded high-frequency band. Because
the tube oscillators can produce the higher frequencies,
they can be used for surface heat-treating called "skin-
effect." This effect is produced by the tendency of the
high frequency current to concentrate along the outside
surface of the conductor. Two disadvantages appear to be

  important enough to mention, and they are: 1) High-
  voltage requires shielding and extra safety equipment for
  the operator, and 2) Complex circuitry requires skilled
  electricians.
  Nearly all elements of both dielectric and induction heat-
  ing systems have now been touched upon with the excep-
  tion of work coils called inductors. The purpose of the
  inductor is to deliver the high-frequency energy to the
  work and to dielectrically or inductively produce heat.
  The design of the coil is largely dictated by the physical
  size and requirements of the work piece. As a general guide
  to coil design, two rules are followed. The first is to use as
  many turns of wire as practical to produce optimum heat-
  ing efficiency . The second rule states that the coil should
  be coupled to the work as closely as the required heating
  pattern on the work-piece will permit. With these rules
  in mind, the following six typical inductor types were
  developed: 1)The torroidal (most efficient), 2) The helix
  or spiral (often called the proximity coil), 3) The hairpin
  (single turn coil used for heating of narrow areas, 4) The
basket coil (shaped to the conformity of a spherical or
rectangular volume and having an opening or window
through which the work is inserted, 5) Special coil types
(made to fit odd configurations of parts,) 6) High perme-
ability core inductors (employ an inductor with a pow-
dered-iron slug core designed to fit into the window or
opening of the inductor).
   With the wheels of automation turning evermore rapidly,
 reliable and economical high-temperature heating systems
 are becoming more in demand. Today's industry requires
 heating units that can blend into a fully automatic work
 chain, can also be portable and moved to preferential work
 areas; and can be capable of a wide range of operating
 frequencies and power capacities. High-frequency heating
 units have met these demands and have exceeded them
 in many cases. Metals are now being joined without the
 once necessary corrosive flux. Plastics, woods, and fibers
 are being dried or cured. Many annealing processes are
 being accurately controlled and accomplished. Huge cop-
 per bus bars are being brazed economically with the new
 portable induction systems. Hence, it is obvious that high-
 frequency heating is here to stay and will play a greater
role in the industrial giants of today as well as those of
tomorrow

"IT'S HERE-IF YOU WANT TO WORK FOR IT"


   Even before Ron Spetrino received his engi-
neering degree from Case he had good job offers
from six companies.
   He joined The Ohio Bell Telephone Company
-his reason: "I was convinced an engineer could
go further here-if he was willing to work for it."
   As soon as Ron got his feet on the ground
in telephone engineering, he was tapped for a
tough assignment. The job-to engineer switch-
ing equipment modifications needed to prepare
Cleveland for nationwide customer dialing of long
distance calls.
   Ron wrapped it up in five months, and found
he had earned a shot at another tough assignment.
In this job Ron helped engineer a completely new

touches on the specs for this $1,600,000 project.
    Today, as a Supervising Engineer, Ron heads
a staff of five engineers and is responsible for
telephone switching in much of the greater
Cleveland area.
    He supervises the design and purchase of $3
million worth of equipment a year. And even
more important, he is charged with developing
the technical and managerial skills of his staff.
    Ron knows what he's talking about when he
 says, "In this business you have to do more than
 a good job. We expect a man to be a self-developer.
 We expect him to take responsibility from his
 first day on the job and think for himself. You

HIGH TEMPERATURE TRANSISTOR
Westinghouse scientists recently developed a transistor that
will operate at temperatures above 6500F. The device is a
unipolar transistor made from silicon carbide crystals about
two-thousandths of an inch thick. These crystals have less

When the material is exposed to vaporized aluminum       at
39000F., aluminum    atoms diffuse into the silicon carbide
crystal, changing its electrical behavior from n-type material
to p-type, and at the same time forming the semiconductor
junction. The transistor, shown undergoing testing, is the
tiny speck inside the quartz tube.

                                  certain spot in the field. When villagers investigated, they be-

                                  that came up out of the ground.
                                    Since in those days the Greeks considered the weak-minded
                                  as special favorites of the gods, they erected a temple at the
                                  spot in honor of the invisible magic that made people giddy.
                                  This was the famous Temple of Delphi, and the "something"

The graph on the left shows you that in 1958 alone the use of high-type
Asphalt pavement increased 618% over 1940. This is because advances
in engineering know-how, in Asphalt technology and in the develop-
ment of the mechanical paver have made modern, high-type Asphalt
pavement the first choice of highway engineers. Its more economical
construction and low maintenance costs have saved many millions of
tax dollars and kept America's wheels rolling.
     Recent engineering advances have developed new, DEEP
     STRENGTH Asphalt pavement which will provide even bet-
     ter performance and greater pavement economy in the future.
The tax savings possible will amount to millions of dollars and will
mean more and better local and interstate roads for our nation.

Interview with General Electric's

Francis J. Boucher

Manager-Manufacturing Personnel Development Service


How Good


Is Your Best Job Offer...


Q. Mr. Boucher, with all the job inter-
views a graduating engineer goes
through, how can he be reasonably
sure he has made the right choice?
A. This is a good question because
few seniors have enough work ex-
perience in industry, government
and   educational institutions  to
allow them to make a fully rea-
soned choice. However, I think the
first step is to be sure that short-
term factors like starting salary
and location don't outweigh long-
range factors like opportunity and
professional growth. All of these
factors should be evaluated before
making a final commitment.
Q. But you do feel that starting salary
is important?
A. Very much so. If you are mar-
ried-it may be an even greater
consideration. But you should also
look beyond starting salary. Find
out, for example, if the company
you are considering has a good
salary administration plan. If there
is no way of formally appraising
your performance and determining
your appropriate rewards, you run
the risk of becoming dissatisfied
or stalemated due to neglect of
these important considerations.
Q. What considerations do you feel
should be evaluated in reaching a job
decision?
A. Let me refer you to a paper
written by Dr. L. E. Saline, now
Manager of Information Systems
in our Defense Systems Depart-
ment. It is titled "How to Evaluate
Job Offers." (Incidentally, you may
obtain a copy by writing as di-
rected in the last paragraph.) In
it, Dr. Saline proposes six ques-
tions-the answers to which should
give you much of the information
you'll need for an objective job-
offer evaluation. He suggests you
determine . . .
* to what degree will the work be
challenging and satisfying?
* what opportunities are available
to further develop abilities?
* what opportunities are there for
advancing in the Company (and
how dynamic the Company is in
the marketplace is an important
aspect of this question).


* what salary potentials are pos-
sible with respect to the future?
* what about geographical location
-now and in the future?
* what effort does the Company
make to establish and maintain a
professional climate?
There is more to these questions
than meets the eye and I think
you   would   enjoy   reading  Dr.
Saline's paper.
Q. What about the openings on de-
fense projects that are listed in the
various magazines and newspapers?
A. Presumably, there will always
be a need for technical manpower
in the defense business. But I
want to point out to you that most
of these opportunities are for ex-
perienced personnel, or personnel
with specific additional training re-
ceived at the graduate level.
Q. How do you feel about training
programs? Do they offer any particular
advantages over any other offer I
might accept?
A. I feel training programs are par-
ticularly helpful in easing the tran-
sition from   an  academic to a
business environment. Of course
they provide formal training de-
signed to add to the individual's
basic fund of knowledge. They
also provide working experience in
a variety of fields and a broad
knowledge of the company con-
cerned and its scope of operations.
Upon completion, the individual is
generally better prepared to decide
the direction in which he will pur-
sue his professional career.
General Electric conducts a num-
ber of training programs. Those
that attract the greatest number
of engineers are the Engineering
and Science, Manufacturing, and
Technical Marketing     Programs.
Each combines a formal, graduate-
level study curriculum, on-the-job
experience, and   rotating assign-
ments. There is little question in
my mind that when an engineer
completes the   Program    of his
choice, he is far better prepared to


choose his field by interest and by
capability. I might also add that
because of this, he is more valuable
to the Company as an employee.
Q. Then you feel that a training pro-
gram is the best alternative for a
graduating engineer?
A. Not always. Some seniors have
already   determined  the specific
field they are best suited for in
terms of their own interests and
capabilities. In such cases, direct
placement into this specific field
may be more advantageous. Pro-
fessional self-development for these
employees, as for all General Elec-
tric technical employees, is en-
couraged   through  a variety   of
programs including the Company's
Tuition Refund Program for work
toward advanced degrees, in-plant
courses conducted at the graduate
level, and others designed to meet
individual needs.
Q. For the record, how would you
rate a job offer from General Electric?
A. I've tried to get across the need
for factual information and a long-
range outlook as the keys to any
good job evaluation. With respect
to the General Electric Company,
seniors and placement offices have
access to a wide variety of infor-
mation about the Company, its
professional environment and its
personnel practices. I think quali-
fied seniors will also discover that
General Electric offers professional
opportunity second to none-and
starting salaries that are competi-
tive  with  the   average  offered
throughout industry today. From
the above, you can see that I
would rate a job offer from General
Electric very highly.

General Electric's training pro-
grams? You can get it, together

reer Planning," General Electric

A Message

From the DecianII


By Dr. G. R. Fitterer














     At a recent meeting of the American Assembly at which Latin American
  relations were discussed, one frequently heard the comment that we, in the
  United States, were thought of as imperialists in many nations of the world.
     It was suggested that we exploit all nations for their raw materials to our
 advantage and to their great disadvantage. It appeared that only we gained
 in such transactions.
      It is about time for us to take stock in our foreign exchanges and to inform
 the people of the World of the things which we have supplied them, many of
 these being from our natural deposits. One such raw material is Coal.
     South America is generally considered to be extremely wealthy in all raw
 materials, yet it is singularly devoid of coal, at least in currently known deposits.
 In Chile, a somewhat inferior grade of coal is available three thousand feet
 underground and five miles out under the ocean. In Columbia, coal of variable
 quality is located in small pockets, otherwise the continent apparently is devoid
 of this very essential raw material.
     The Volta Redonda steel plant in Brazil, Huachapato in Chile, and San
 Nicolas plant (now under construction) either now or eventually are designed
 to operate through the use of some 60%/ to 70%9 Pennsylvania coal. The coal in
 this state is the best in the world for coking and steel manufacture and many of
 the steel plants, of not only South America but also even Europe and Japan,
 are practically dependent upon them, as exports to other countries during the
 past several years will indicate.

                 Bituminous Coal Exported from the United States
Exported to                                        Millions of Tons
                                         1956        1957       1958        1959
Canada and Mexico                       20.75       18.53      12.30       12.50
Argentina, Brazil, & Chile               2.80        2.27        1.45       1.50
Europe                                  41.16       49.70      32.89       19.11
Asia (mostly Japan)                      3.51        5.67       3.55        4.08
Africa                                   0.31       0.27        0.09       0.07
    Total Exported                    68.53      76.44         50.28      37.26

    Surely America cannot be considered as imperialistic if it permits from 37 to
76 million tons of one of its most valuable fuels (coal) to be exported to operate
steel mills.in direct competition to our own. It would seem that this story would
be worth telling, particularly to those countries which are receiving this valuable
raw material, some of whom do not hesitate to brand America as imperialistic S

An invention or improvement in a present device that
advances the usefulness and possibilities of the device by
one hundred per cent is considered remarkable. A new
device that projects the radio spectrum into a range some
ten thousand times higher than that which was previously
attainable may then only be described as fantastic. The
LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of
Radiation) does just that.
  So promising is this device that many companies are now
putting much time and money into laser research. Foremost
in this research are Hughes Research Laboratories and
Bell Telephone Laboratories who have already spent years
of research in solid-state electronics to develop the laser.
  You may have noticed the similarity between the words
"laser" and "maser" (Microwave Amplification by Stimu-
lated Emission of Radiation). That similarity is because
the laser is simply a maser capable of operating at fre-
quencies within the optical region. The inventor of the
maser, Dr. Charles Townes of Columbia University, some
time ago suggested that there seemed to be no factor that
limited masers to the microwave region of the radio spec-
trum. It was not until recently that Dr. Theodore H.
Maiman of Hughes Research Laboratories proved Dr.
Townes to be correct.
  Just what does the laser do? First, it provides, for the
first time in scientific history, true amplification of light.
Secondly, this light is coherent (single-frequency). In addi-
tion, the light emitted from a laser may be so concen-
trated that a laser beam of less than a hundreth of a degree
of arc could be radiated from the earth to the moon, nearly
a quarter million miles away, with an area of less than ten
miles wide illuminated on the lunar surface. If this was

tried with an ordinary searchlight, the area covered would
be over 25,000 miles wide and the brightness correspond-
ingly reduced.
  In appearance, the laser is quite simple.  The first
operational laser, the ruby laser, is approximately the size
of a glass tumbler. It consists of a rod of synthetic ruby
crystal containing chromium atoms surrounded by a coiled,
xenon-filled tube which supplies random light waves which
in turn excite the gem's tightly-packed atoms. The atoms
re-radiate this energy in the form of light with a single

  frequency. This light bounces back and forth between the
  Silvered ends of the ruby rod until it finally has enough
  intensity to shine through the end of the rod which has an
  extremely thin coating of silver.
    The second major type of laser is the gas laser. It uses
    a gas mixture, such as helium and neon, in a glass tube
    instead of a synthetic ruby. Whereas the ruby laser depends
    on a bright external light source to "pump" the chromium
  atoms in its crystal structure into an excited upper energy
  level, the gas laser may use an electrically discharged flow
  through the gas, much the same way as in a conventional
  neon tube, to excite the helium atoms to a very high upper
  "metastable" energy level. Neon atoms in the mixture col-
  lide with the excited helium atoms and, through the colli-
L  sion process, the energy is transferred to them. Then the
   neon atoms themselves can be stimulated to radiate their
   energy on demand in a continous stream. As in the ruby
   laser, the beam is reflected back and forth through the
   gas-filled tube by semi-reflecting end plates, growing in
   intensity with each trip, until the beam intensity is high
   enough to be transmitted through the plates to form a very
   narrow output beam of coherent light.
     As already mentioned, the light generated by a laser
   is coherent. Unlike natural light, coherent light is a pure
   light, that is, all the rays are of one frequency. Until the
   advent of the laser, coherent light was very rare on this
   earth since even light sent through colored filters contains
   many frequencies although admittedly far fewer than
   "white" light. Most man-made radio waves are coherent
   and can thus be made to carry information by either
   amplitude or frequency modulation. The laser's coherent
   light may be manipulated to carry messages the same way


radio waves do. An amplitude modulated light beam from
a laser could be created by placing in front of a laser a
filter that reacts to an electrical impulse. The electrical
impulse could be made by speaking into a microphone and
sending the feeble impulse through an amplifier where it is
then sent to the filter which impresses the spoken message
on the laser's light beam.
  There are some distinct differences between radio waves
and light beams. Radio waves, with their relatively low
frequencies and long wave-lengths, can be sent over and
around obstacles such as mountains. Light waves, on the
