for us. The sole purpose of a university, however, is not to
train students. It has another purpose, one which should be
more important -      to  educate its students. Although
engineering can and should involve creativity, rest assured that
your engineering "education" will consist mainly of training
the instruction and drill in habits of thought and action.
Except for a few electives, which you will probably cop out on
for an easy grade, the responsibility for your education, your
humanization, your involvement, will rest on your shoulders.
Our brothers and sisters in liberal arts have a chance to
stumble onto life by accident - maybe through a good teacher
or a book they are assigned to read. Unfortunately, you can
not find your fellow man in fluid mechanics.
      Our electives give us a chance also, but it is almost
obliterated by the choice of low quality, easy electives, and
the day to day pressures of engineering courses. If the
pressures are great and time short, though, what can be done?
When an engineer taking advanced ROTC graduates he receives;
two things, a degree and a commission. To do this he must
either work harder or go to school longer than the average
student. If you wish to leave this school with an engineering
degree and an education you will have to follow this example.
I hope both of these ends will be your goal; because if yo'u
seek just the degree and not the education, society - no
matter what it tells you or promises you - has no real need for
you.

               Dear Cabinet


              the engineer's

                 opinion...







          The Benedum Island
               of Engineering


      As an engineering student at the University of Pittsburgh
you will be isolated from the university community. This
isolation will be extended with the completion (?) of the new
facilities and the unifying of the engineers under the new
centralized curriculum. We will have our own building, faculty,
and administration as before. In addition, we will have our
own usable library where it will be almost necessary to study if
we are to have adequate reference sources. We will have our
own computer center. Finally, liberal arts courses such as
English, philosophy, and mathematics are being established
especially for engineering students. Indeed, we will be stranded
in the Benedum Island of Engineering.
     Most of these conditions are necessary for the efficient
training of engineers and will make life a lot more convenient


      As a member of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER staff
for three years one is inevitably brought into contact with
Engineering Cabinet, the School of Engineering's complement
to   student   government.  Consequently, one     becomes
acquainted with a few cabinet members as well as their
performance in office. Cabinet members, on the whole, are a
gratifying contradiction to the apathetic engineer stereotype.
The energy and enthusiasm they show is encouraging, as is the
increasing influence they maintain in some areas of our
school's operation. Dick Edgecomb, Cabinet Chairman,
outlines his body's progress in his letter on page 10.
Membership on all standing committees in the Engineering
School prompts Dick to write, "Now the channels for
responsible expression are open to the whole engineering
student body." Clearly, the channels are open, but to the
whole engineering student body? Only Cabinet members or
those they appoint sit on such committees, which admittedly
is as it should be. The question that remains is how can the
student body relay their opinions through Cabinet?
      Each department has three representatives in Cabinet,
one each from the Sophomore, Junior and Senior Class. They
are chosen during the winter term for the next fall by
nomination and vote of the department's undergraduates. That
nominating and voting is the extent of the average engineer's
participation in Cabinet. The election itself boasts almost
nothing in the way of meaningful participation in many
instances. Frequently, (in my seminar anyway) the balloting
degenerates into a popularity contest in which capability and
desire to participate in a minor factor. Fortunately, some
engineers with ability are lucky enough to be elected. Those

(Opinion Continued)
who are just building up their permanent record, the ones who
miss meetings regularly are cheating their "constituents" to a
voice in curriculum development and other important areas,
even though that voice is a weak one. In reality Cabinet
members really have no constituency as such since there is no
provision in the Cabinet constitution requiring members to
consult with those who they represent. The major bridge of
this   communications   gap   for  those   who   seminar
representatives are delinquent in passing on information of
Cabinet activities, is a page or so of the ENGINEERING
BULLETIN, a strictly one-way bridge.
      The "gap" is quite evident among the twenty-odd
members of the SKYSCRAPER staff. Not one of seven
sophomores were aware of more than that there was a Cabinet.
The rest of the staff was almost equally uninformed. Why
can't Cabinet members be required to present a brief report at
least, at every seminar? They could invite comment from the
student body and perhaps even put a measure to a vote. Such
actions would make Cabinet more representative of the School
of Engineering Student Body and certainly unique in student
government at the University of Pittsburgh.

            A Letter from


      Engineering Cabinet




      As many of the students at Pitt have discovered in the
 past several months, the basic source of power within the
 established structure of the university rests with the members
 of the faculty. These are the people who make important
 decisions about matters which involve and concern all
 students, namely academic and curricular development. As
 students, therefore, we need not concern ourselves with the
 old objectives of student power, for in no way can students
 collectively make a decision that bears an irrefutable impact
 on the case in point. Rather, the students must find ways and
 means to serve and influence the members of the faculty when
 they function in a decision-making capacity.
      To an extent, this has been in practice for several years.
 Student representatives belong to every standing committee
 within the School of Engineering. These committees generate
 the policies which regulate and sanction the implementation 4
 and  application of the academies programs operating
 throughout the school. The student committee members are
 appointed by the Cabinet to present the student point of view
 to the other members, in hopes that our interests will be given
 some consideration. In most cases, the student representatives
 have proven very influential. Of course, the standing
 committees generally operate by concensus, and therefore, all
 the members reach some agreement on each issue.
      Last October, the members of Cabinet decided that the
 proper mode for student expression should be more clearly
 defined. We agreed that the best interests of both the faculty
 and the student body would be served by giving students a role
 in the power arena. We petitioned the members of the faculty
 for the privilege of four student votes at every general faculty
 meeting. By a wide margin, the faculty found this proposal to
 be acceptable, so now it is possible for student opinion to
 reach the ultimate source of decision-making intact. Obviously
 our four votes represent no great power bloc, nor is our
 presence interpreted as a political threat. Just as the members
 of Cabinet had hoped, the faculty has once again welcomed
 student opinion, knowing that students are capable of making
 valid assessments of the academic program. The student must
 earn this distinction.
      Now the channels for responsible expression are open to
the whole engineering student body. Working within the
existing Cabinet structure, we can put them to good use. The
only way to help create a better academic environment in the
School of Engineering is to acquire an awareness of the
objectives of the program, to decide what's necessary or what's
obsolete, and then to "give a damn!"

POLYWATER


It freezes at -50oC and boils at 700oC



                                                    by Tom Getting


       In the past few months reports of a new form of
  "anomalous" water have been reported by chemists. A water
  which is ten times as viscous as ordinary water and has a liquid
  temperature range of -50oC to 7000C. Actually, reports of this
  phenomenon have dated back to 1928. Although most
  scientists have tried to avoid a direct confrontation; water, the
  substance basic to life and a universal standard, under proper
  conditions becomes something different than water. This
  water, discovered by the Russians, is reported, by the
  University of Maryland and the National Bureau of Standards,
  to be actually a polymer. Hence, the appropriate title
  "polywater."
                       PRODUCTION
       Making polywater is quite simple and it could be done in
  one's basement. Most polywater has been formed on the inside
  of freshly drawn quartz or glass capillary tubes. The diameter
  of these tubes have been as big as 0.5mm, but most of them
  have been in the 10 to 30um. range. The capillaries are
  suspended over distilled water in an evacuated vacuum
  dessicator. After about 18 hours, polywater can be found in
  some of the capillaries. No one has yet, been able to discover
  why this happens or why the polywater only forms on the
  inside of the capillary tubes. Some researchers reason that the
  quartz and glass surface have a catalytic effect on the water
  molecules condensing on the tubes from the vapor phase. This
  causes the water to restructure into a different form. The
  mechanism of catalysis is not understood, but it will only
  work with vaporphase water. Other methods that require
  temperature control to regulate water vapor saturation in the
  dessicator. The process takes more time, but it has more
  reliable results. Another, more rigorous process which obtains
  better results, is to condense polywater on flat or even convex
  quartz surfaces.
                       PROPERTIES
      Since efficient methods of mass production have not yet
 been developed, researchers have only microgram quantities to
 work with. This makes obtaining meaningful, analytical data
 to determine structure or to identify impurities almost
 impossible. The data that has been confirmed by several
 separate research teams is fantastic. Polywater is 10 times as
 viscous as ordinary water. One researcher said that it has a
 consistency like that of "Vaseline". Polywater's density ranges
 from 1.04 to 1.50 gm/cm3. It hardens (not freezes) at -400 to
 50-C and it would not boil, but revert to normal water vapor
 at 6500 to 700-C. Its index of refraction is 1.48 compared to
 1.33 for normal water.


14


       Samples of polywater were       exannined  under a
 microscope spectrophotometer and the observations were
 printed in Industrial Research. "When we took samples out of
 the capillary and put it on diamond platelets, we immediately
 got a spectrum that was different from any known substance.
 One of the features of this run was the complete absence of
 OH bands and the appearance of two new bands-one near
 1.595 cm-1 and an intense doublet in the 1,400 cm-1 region."
 Another type of analytical method, infrared spectral analysis,
 leads the researchers to believe that they have found a new
 type of chemical bond never seen before. In ordinary water,
 the two hydrogen atoms are held closely by the oxygen atom
 and the molecules are loosely attracted by Van der Waals
 forces on the order of 4Kcal. Researchers say that in this new
 form of water there must be a primary chemical bond with
 hydrogen between two oxygen atoms (O-H-O). This new bond

allows oxygen to form three linkages instead of the usual two
bonds. It is believed that the 0-0 distance is about 2.3
angstroms compared to about 2.8 angstroms for normal water.
In polywater, the hydrogen atom is centered between the two
oxygen atoms at about 1.15 angstroms and has a "hydrogen
bond" energy of 30 to 50 Kcal per bond unit. In normal
water, this is 119 Kcal for the O-OH bond. This indicates that
polywater is held together with much greater force than exists
between the molecules of normal water. This research has lead
to the theory that the polymer-like structures have either 1200
bond angles or 1090 bond degree angles. The former angle
would produce flat structures while the latter would produce
"puckered" structures.
                         HISTORY
      Actually, the first person to discover this phenomenon
was the son of a Russian immigrant, Leon Shereshefsky.
Shereshefsky received his education at Carnegie Institute of
Technology, a Master of Science degree from the University of
Pittsburgh, and a PhD. from John Hopkins. In 1928, his thesis
was published in the Journal of the. American Chemical
Society. His experiements described the action of water vapor
pressure in tiny capillaries. Shereshefsky's results were much
lower than the pressure predicted in tables of thermodynamic
constants. Shereshefsky did not continue his research of this
startling discovery.
      Not until 1962, did Dr. Docent Fedyakin of the Physics
Department of the Institute of Light Industry in Kostroma,
USSR, duplicate Shereshefsky's experiments and continue the
investigation as to the cause. Fedyakin found secondary
columns form near both ends of a column of water in a
capillary. He deduced that these new columns must have
different properties than normal water. Fedyakin joined
prominent surface chemist, Dr. Boris Deryagin, head of the
Division of Surface Phenomena at the Institute of Physical
Chemistry of the Academy of Sciences. After completing
research, they published a paper in 1968, in Priroda (Nature),
which gave their results. Critics found it hard to believe and
not until recently have British teams at Unilever Research
Laboratories and American teams at the University of
Maryland confirmed their results.
                PROPOSED APPLICATIONS
      Polywater    must   be   thought    of  as   a   new,
high-temperature polymer and not a funny water. It seems to
be thermally stable and very attractive as a working fluid in
steam   engines or as a lubricant in      high  temperature
environments. Polywater could possible provide a cheap way
to desalt water. Because of catalytic action on certain surfaces,
it could be useful in membrane processes for separating pure
water from dissolved impurities. Several research teams have
been able to make polywater from deuterium oxide (heavy
water). This "polyheavywater" seems to be very stable and
possible a good moderator for nuclear reactors. Since
polywater has a one-third greater density, there would be a
larger concentration of deuterium atoms which means that less
material could be used to get the same moderation. Also, since
polyheavywater has a high viscosity, leaks would be less of a
problem. Once mass production of polywater has been
mastered, and definite calculations of its properties have been
found, the uses of polywater will become unlimited.
      Researchers are also searching to find polywater in
natural form. It seems highly possible, since this form of water
may be more thermodynamically stable than ordinary water.
One possibility could be in the intracellular water in living
things. Researchers have used nuclear magnetic resonance to
probe the elastic fields surrounding the water molecules inside
living tissue. They have found that the water is more like ice

than ordinary liquid. It could be a highly concentrated form of
polywater.   Another    possibility which   researchers  are
investigating are minerals - in particular, clay types. Such
minerals as kaolinite and montmorillonites only give up water
when heated to 6000 to 7000C. This is the same range that it
takes to vaporize polywater. The density of water in these
minerals, as measured by surface chemists, seems too high -
from 1.2 up to 1.5. Even the infrared spectra tests that have
been prepared look suspicious.
      Even though polywater is stable, it will not nucleate or,
as it were, convert the whole global water system into
polywater. If a glass of polywater were poured into the ocean,
it would be so diluted that not a trace could be found. It is
projected though, that the unexpected absence of water on
Venus could be due to a complete conversion of the water to
polywater.
                      CONCLUSION
      Now that the scientists have discovered a new polymer,
it is the engineer's turn to develop the methods of cheap, mass
production and adapt it to the situations applicable. Because
of the small understanding of the properties and formation of
polywater, a new field of elements, bonds, and structures
could be opened.

     "When I got my metallurgy degree
 there were sixty companies with jobs for
 six of us. I checked out the top ten and
 picked International Nickel. Why?
     "Because they gave me the best chance
 to stay at the front edge of technology and
 also learn the other half of the equation-
 business.
     "It worked.
     "I spent the first year in research. Then
 moved on to marketing-Chicago, Hart-
 ford, and now New York. Fantastic city.
     "I'm responsible for development in
 mainstream markets-motor freight, con-
 tainerization, construction equipment.
     "Here I am on Wall Street, past half-
 way to my MBA at NYU with a thousand
 opportunities in front of me.
      "Yes, Sputnik took me quite a way."













 Nickel helps other metals resist heat, cold, im-
 pact, pressure, abrasion, corrosion...to advance
 engineering in vital fields-power, desalination,
 electronics, transportation, aerospace.
 We're doing everything we can to produce
 more nickel. Searching around the world-In-
 donesia, Australia, Guatemala, Canada. We've
 found ways to extract nickel from ores thought
 too poor to mine a few years ago.
 We count our blessings and respect our sur-
 roundings. From nickel ores, we recover plati-
 num, palladium, twelve other commercially
 useful elements. Make iron pellets for steel.
 Convert smoke in our stacks to chemicals for
 other industries. On sand left from processing
 ore, we grow meadows of hay.
 We are 33,000 people hard at work in 18 coun-
 tries-miners, researchers, market builders. We
 bring opportunity to underdeveloped lands,
 new technologies, new payrolls, new tax income.
 Nickel in the ground is useless.We put it to work.

      In order to keep pace with the ever decreasing value of
the American dollar the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER will
award $10 for the correct solution of this month's Skycapers.
If, by the time this issue appears, no correct solution has been
received for last month's puzzles, the mastermind that cracks
January's problems will collect $15.


                Here are January's puzzles.

 1. Three men who had a monkey bought a pile of mangoes.
   At night one of the men came to the pile of mangoes while
   the others slept and, finding that there was just one more
   mango than could be divided exactly by three, tossed the
   extra mango to the monkey and took away one third of the

    remainder. Then he went back to sleep. Presently another
    of them awoke and went to the pile of mangoes. He also
    found just one too many to be divided evenly by three, so
    he tossed the extra one to the monkey, took one third of
    the remainder, and returned to sleep. After a while the
    third arose also, and he too gave one mango to the monkey
    and took away the number of whole mangoes which
    represented precisely one third of the rest.
       Next morning the men got up and went to the pile.
    Again they found just one too many, so they gave one to
    the monkey and divided the rest evenly. What is the least
    number of mangoes with which this can be done?



 2. Suddenly acquiring the virtue of thrift, an engineering
   student put a penny in a bank the first of the month. Each
   succeeding day he put in twice as much as the day before
   until by the end of the 30 day month he had acquired quite
   a few pennies. Can you tell us exactly how much he saved?



3. A phonograph record has a total diameter of 12 inches. The
   recording leaves an outer margin of 1 inch, and has an
   unused center of 4 inches. There are 90 grooves to an inch.
   How far does the needle travel when the record is played?



4. Determine pi to thirty decimal places with the aid of this
   rhyme:
      See, I have a rhyme assisting
      My feeble brain its tasks some resisting.
      Efforts laborious can by its witchery
      Grow easier, so hidden here are the decimals

ANSWERS TO OCTOBER-NOVEMBER PUZZLES


1. Since the probability that two people will have the same
   birthday is 0.5, the probability that none will have the
   same birthday is also 0.5 or (1.0- 0.5).
      To find the number of people needed to give a
   probability of 0.5 that no one will have the same birthday
   as another person calculate as follows:
   No. of persons         2          3              4

3. Taking into account the fact that the grass continues to
   grow while the cows are eating, this problem is simply the
   solution of a first order differential. The correct answer is
   36 cows.



4. Knowing that the circumference of the earth, or any circle
   is given by C= 3.14 x D, we can differentiate to obtain
   dC = 3.14 x dD. Substituting 100 feet for the change in
   circumference we can readily find the change in diameter
   and thus the change in height. The correct answer is a
   change in height of 16 feet which, of course anyone can
   walk under.

     Well, we think the company responsible for
engineering innovations such as the transistor, radio
astronomy, high fidelity and stereo recording,
magnetic tape, synthetic crystals, negative feedback,
sound motion pictures, microwave relay, electronic

At Pratt & Whitney Aircraft "ceiling and visibility unlimited" is not just an expression. For example,
the President of our parent corporation joined P&WA only two years after receiving an engineering
degree. The preceding President, now Chairman, never worked for any other company. The current
President of P&WA started in our engineering department as an experimental engineer and moved
up to his present position. In fact, the majority of our senior officers all have one thing in common-
degrees in an engineering or scientific field.
To insure CAVU*, we select our engineers and scientists carefully. Motivate them well. Give them
the equipment and facilities only a leader can provide. Offer them company-paid, graduate educa-
tion opportunities. Encourage them to push into fields that have not been explored before. Keep
them reaching for a little bit more responsibility than they can manage. Reward them well when
they do manage it.
Your degree can be a B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. in: MECHANICAL . AERONAUTICAL * ELECTRICAL *
CHEMICAL * CIVIL * MARINE * INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING * PHYSICS * CHEMISTRY * METAL-
LURGY * MATERIALS SCIENCE * CERAMICS * MATHEMATICS * STATISTICS * COMPUTER
SCIENCE * ENGINEERING SCIENCE * ENGINEERING MECHANICS.

Consult your college placement officer-or write Mr. William L. Stoner, Engineering Department,
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, East Hartford, Connecticut 06108.


              CAVU* might also mean full utilization of your technical skills through a wide range of challenging
              programs which include jet engines for the newest military and commercial aircraft, gas turbines for
              industrial and marine use, rocket engines for space programs, fuel cells for space vehicles and terrestrial
              uses, and other advanced systems.

      Venture:

      Purify water

      with the fiber

      that made

      men whistle.

         Nylon. Reverse osmosis.
         A fiber that started making girls' legs
       more beautiful some 30 years ago.
         And a process that's been around a
       lot longer.
         But when Du Pont scientists and engi-
       neers look at them in a new way, they
       combine into an idea that can change
       the world.
         Reverse osmosis is a purification pro-
       cess that requires no phase change. It's
       potentially the cheapest way to desalinate
       water.
         Du Pont's innovation? Hollow, semi-
       permeable nylon fibers much finer than
       human hair. Symmetrical, with an outer
       diameter of .002 inch and a wall thickness
       of .0005 inch, with an accuracy of manu-
       facture maintained at close to 100%.
       Twenty-five to 30 million of them encased
       in a precisely engineered unit 14 inches
       in diameter by 7 feet long.
         The result: a semipermeable surface
       area of about 85,000 square feet-the
       size of a 2-acre lot-and up to 10,000
       gallons of desalted water per day.
         So far "Permasep''® permeators have
       been used experimentally to purify
       brackish and polluted water, and in
       various industrial separations. But the
       potential to desalt seawater, too, is there.
         So Du Pont scientists and engineers
       are even now working toward improved
       fibers, units and plant designs that
       should make it possible to get fresh water
       from salt at a price that any town or
       nation can afford.
         Innovation-applying the known to
       discover the unknown, inventing new
       materials and putting them to work, using
       research and engineering to create the
       ideas and products of the future-this
       is the venture Du Pont people are now
       engaged in.
         For a variety of career opportunities,
       and a chance to advance through many
       fields, talk to your Du Pont Recruiter. Or
       send us the coupon.

                   How to keep



a cow's mind on milk.



             Instead of flies.

An informal report on a few current projects at Shell. Some of them might seem like offbeat work
for an oil company. But this is a company that contributes broadly and significantly to society. A
company of experts that brings out the best in its engineering, scientific and business people.


          .  Shell scientists
             have come up with
             a vast improve-
             ment over even
             the most talented
cow tail. It's called VAPONA® in-
secticide. A plastic strip impreg-
nated with it will kill flies in a cow
stall for up to three months. And
VAPONA® insecticide combined
with CIODRIN® insecticide keeps
cows fly-free 24 hours a day-even
out in pasture. Give you ideas for
further applications?

Energy from under the sea
Shell is heading
into ever-deeper
waterinthesearch
for oil and natural
gas. We have de-
signed and installed permanent
drilling/production platforms as
tall as a34-story building, with still
bigger structures in the works.
And we are researching other
means for extending our opera-
tions even further into the sea.
We are also searching on land in
16 states to help meet burgeoning
energy needs.


      A,     Up, up and away
             Space exploration
             puts us in orbit,
             too. And, vice ver-
             sa, via our high-
     Sstrength         hydro-
             gen peroxide
             monopropellant.
Not to mention our 405* Catalyst,
which decomposes hydrazine
rocket fuel without heat. Once out
there, our AEROSHELL®
GREASE-15 lubricates the wheels
of progress in a tape system and
high-gain antenna used to trans-
mit pictures down to earth. On
terra firma, Shell epoxy resins
protect launch pads, ground con-
trol equipment and missile con-
trol centers that putthings in orbit.
The name of the game
More gasoline per  H
barrel of crude oil
delights   engi-
neers, scientists
and conservation-
ists alike. Our new hydrocrackers
actually produce more than a
gallon of refined product from a
gallon of feed stock. And we are
using sophisticated techniques to


tailor-make products by reassem-
bling hydrocarbon molecules.
Ourmost interesting development
When it comes to your own de-
velopment-so essential to our
pursuit of excellence-we' re work-
ing constantly to recognize, utilize
and help expand your knowledge
and abilities. We plan work as-
signments accordingly. We hold
"in-house" courses in advanced
technology and business, run
technical seminars, and 1000/o-
reimburse career-related college
courses. But we don't stop there-
we're striving to enrich the mix
for our professionals with activi-
ties like developing and teaching
advanced courses, representing
Shell on industry committees, and
company-wide internal consult-
ing assignments.

      A 3-D scene is transmitted as a series of slightly different
 2-D images that convey depth information. At the receiving
 end of the system, the 2-D images are combined to reconstruct
 the original 3-D scene. No special glasses are required to see
 the 3-D scene.
      The key to the new method is a pair of spherical mirrors,
 called varifocal mirrors. Because they are made of flexible
 mylar, their centers can be made to move rapidly in and out,
 from concave to convex shapes - like loosely-fitting drum
 heads.
      As the mirror at the transmitting end moves, it reflects
portions of the 3-D scene to a short focal length lens. The lens
then focuses these different views, or "depth planes," one at a
time so that they can be shown on a rear projection screen,
recorded by a TV camera, and transmitted.
      At the receiving end, a TV monitor displays the 2-D
images. An observer views them as they are reflected from a
second moving mirror, which is placed in front of the monitor.
The mirror forms an image of each       successive view,
instantaneously placing it in the correct depth position to
reconstruct the orginial 3-D scene.
      Although the new transmission technique requires
several times more bandwidth than commercial TV, it has
potential applications for 3-D data transmission in specialized
scientific and medical fields. But applications for commercial
entertainment are limited by a phenomenon associated with
the varifocal mirrors used in the system. Because of this
phenomenon, known as "phantom imaging," objects in the
foreground of a 3-D scene do not totally obstruct those in the
background.

                   Dune Bug Boom



       The world's most versatile tire and the world's most
 unusual car are expected to combine into a $230-million
 bloom of dune buggies next spring, according to The
 Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company.
       The rugged, multi-purpose dune buggies have been
 snyonymous with California, but now reports show the tiny
 vehicles are sweeping East. The No. 1 builder of dune buggy
 kits, Bruce Meyers, for example, reports more than 60 per cent
 of his sales this year have been from customers east of the
 Mississippi River.
      Goodyear, whose tires carry the vast majority of dune
 buggies in both off-road and on-road use, figures there will be
 fully 100,000 dune buggies registered by early 1970. And
 that's not counting those that will be assembled from kits by
 thousands of auto enthusiasts working in home garages and
 basements over the winter.
      Dune buggies have been exploding market that even
 their originator grossly underestimated. Meyers, whose original
 buggy, "Old Red," still stands on its combination of Goodyear
 Terra-Tire low-pressure tires (rear) and Goodyear street tires
 (front) started the whole shebang off quietly in November of
 1964.
      "My wife and I talked it over at that time," recalls
Meyers, "and figured I could build 10 or 15 cars in my spare
time and sell them, perhaps, to people in the Fountain Valley,
California area."
      Today, backed by an international network of 200
 dealers, B. F. Meyers & Company expects to gross $2.5-million
 this year after a record of $1.5-million in sales last year.
      The buggies themselves usually comprise frames from
 old Volkswagons mated with rebuilt, modified engines from
 VWs, Porsches and Corvairs. California, with a vast array of
 VWs and with empty sands dunes for off-road recreation, was
 a natural spawning ground for the automotive "component
 kit."
      The mating game between these and Meyers' pioneer
modern buggy, the Meyers' Manx, took place in Meyers' garage
in '64 when a new era in American automotive history got off
to a rolling start.
      Goodyear has compiled some interesting "averages"
about the dune buggy.
      For one thing, the average buggy owner is 32 years of
age, is a family man and drives the buggy to work as a second
car. He keeps a set of Terra-Tire high-flotation tires mounted
for off-road, weekend sports driving.
      The typical dune buggy weighs only 1,100 pounds and is
made primarily of fiberglass.
      Planning to build a nice, street-legal buggy? The average
cost is $2,300, with about half going for performance goodies
and the remainder for carpets, leather seats, magnesium wheels
and Goodyear Polyglas tires.




Dune Buggies take all kinds of terrain in stride, the reason for
their growing popularity. It's estimated 100,000 of them will
be registered by early this year.

     The Great Clean Air Race


     Plans were announced recently for a coast-to-coast
collegiate Clean Air Car Race in which new kinds of lower
pollution vehicles - electric, steam, turbine, hybrids, etc. -
will complete over public roads between Massachusetts and
California.
      The contest is an outgrowth and expansion of the Great
Electric Car Race which was fun in the fall of 1968 between
electric cars build   and  operated   by  students at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California
Institute of Technology.
      The Clean Air Car Race will be bigger and open to more
kinds of entries. The vehicles may be disigned, developed, built
and paid for by any kind of organization, including
commerical companies and foreign groups. The restriction is
that only groups of college or university students may do the
actual driving.
      Organizers are   Dr. Richard   D. Thornton, M.I.T.
professor of electrical engineering, and Dr. Jerome Shapiro,
Caltech professor of engineering. They plan to have the race in
September, 1970, and are asking that all potential entrants
make themselves known by a deadline of February 28, 1970.
Prospective entrants may write or call either of the organizers.
A copy of the preliminary rules may be obtained from the
Public Relations Offices of either M.I.T. or Caltech.
      The competition will be divided into three parts. The
first part will consist of a series of short events which
emphasize performance, safety, road handling, and energy
consumption and will start September 2. The second part will
be a race from M.I.T. to Caltech starting September 9 and the
final part will consist of emission measurements to be made in
California at the conclusion of the cross country race. Points
will be awarded for each part of the competition and prizes
will be awarded for winners of each part as well as for the
overall winner. All entrants must participate in all three parts
of the contest.
      The transcontinental race will be divided into six legs
between Cambridge, Cleveland, Chicago, St. Louis, Oklahoma
City, Albuquerque, and Pasadena. Recharging stations for
electric entries will be arranged by the race organizers in
advance. Each leg will be started at a prescribed time on


successive days. For each leg, each entrant will be allowed up
to 10 "time-outs." No time out will be less than 30 minutes or
more than one hour. Time outs are for activities such as
charging, refueling, making repairs, etc. All existing traffic laws
must be obeyed.
       No vehicle will be barred, provided it produces less
 emission than is specified by the 1974 California Standards.
 However, emission measurements to be made in the third part
 of the competition will penalize any vehicle which produces
 pollution during urban portions of the trip.







            Oil Under the Ice


      General Dynamics has announced that it has made
proposals to five oil companies to      build  170,000-ton
nuclear-powered submarine tankers to move Alaskan oil under
the ice to an ice-free North Atlantic port, where the oil would
be transferred to conventional tankers for delivery to U.S. East
Coast destinations.
      The submarines could traverse the Northwest Passage or
move under the ice of the Arctic Ocean to the open sea. They
would be loaded either on the surface or while submerged off
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay.
      Roger Lewis, General Dynamics president, said that the
proposals were made after extensive technical feasibility and
coast evaluation studies showed the submarine to be an
entirely practical and economically attractive means for
moving arctic oil.
      "Beyond the inherent reliability of nuclear power," Mr.
Lewis said, "the arctic submarine, operating submerged, enjoys
a steady 28-degree temperature and protection from ice, wind,
waves and storms. In this constant and protected environment,
the submarine is exposed to a minimum of environmental
hazard. Navigation and schedule adherence can be precise."
      Capable of carrying 170,000 tons of oil in its
rectangular-shaped hull, the submarine would be 900 feet long,
with a beam of 140 feet and a hull depth of 85 feet. Its twin
screws would give it a speed of 18 knots. General Dynamics
plans to build the ships at its Quincy, Mass., shipyard.

The largest submarine ever built,
displacing over a quarter million
tons when loaded, would traverse
the Northwest Passage or the Arctic
Ocean under the ice carrying as
much as 170,000 tons of Alaskan
crude oil from the North Slope to
the East Coast of the United States.

Full-Depth (TA) Deep-Strength
Asphalt Pavements
     Structurally designed Full-Depth Asphalt pave-
ment is one of the most significant road-building de-
velopments in the last two decades. Full-Depth Asphalt
pavement employs asphalt mixtures for all courses
above the subgrade or improved subgrade. The thick-
ness of Full-Depth Asphalt pavement is mathemati-
cally calculated in accordance with traffic require-
ments and subgrade soil characteristics, the asphalt
base is laid directly on the prepared subgrade. The
mathematical symbol, (TA) is used to denote "Full-
Depth" in The Asphalt Institute's structural design-
formula for asphalt pavements.
     With the development of Full-Depth Asphalt
pavements comes the need for engineers with a solid
background in the fundamentals of Asphalt technology
and pavement construction.
     Today, more than 90% of paved roads in the U.S.
are asphalt surfaced. And Asphalt pavements have


successfully kept America's wheels turning since
1876.
     Your contribution-and reward-in our nation's
huge road-building program in the "Surging Seventies"
can depend on your knowledge of modern Asphalt
technology. So-prepare for your future-NOW.

      Some people sow their wild oats on Saturday night and
then go to church on Sunday and pray for crop failure.

      Now there's a new game called, "Pony Express." It's a
lot like Post Office except there's considerably more horsing
around.

      Faculty advisor: "Let's not have any more jokes about
sex, drinking, and profanity."
      Joke editor: "OK, I'm tired of putting out this
magazine anyhow."

      It was a beautiful reception, but the mother of the
bride was worried that the newlyweds wouldn't have time to
change and pack their clothes in time to catch their
honeymoon flight to Rio. Seeing that the party was nowhere
near breaking up, she finally approached the groom and
whispered: "Don't you children think it's time to go upstairs
and get your things together?"

      A young lady, with a touch of hay fever, took with her
to a dinner party two handkerchiefs, one of which she stuck in
her bosom. At dinner she began rummaging to the right and
left in h0r bosom for the fresh handkerchief. Engrossed in her
search, she suddenly realized that conversation had ceased and
people were watching her. In confusion she murmured, "I
know I had two when I came in."

      A guy just called by his draft board happened to think
of a friend who was rejected because he wore a truss. So he
hastily purchased one and rushed down to the board. After the
examination, he noticed that the official had written N.E.
after his name.
      "What's the N.E. for?" he asked.
      "Near East," was the reply. "Anyone who can wear a
truss upside down can ride a camel for two years."

      Heard about the new deodorant called Vanish? It makes
you disappear and everybody wonders where the odor is
coming from.


      A young husband received a telegram stating that his
mother-in-law's body had been found floating at the seashore,
a lobster attached to each toe. He was asked to telegraph
instructions for disposition of the body.
      He wired back: "Sell lobsters and reset bait."

      It's been discovered that Adam was a Pollock. What else
would sit next to a naked woman and eat apples?

   The things men like to hear a girl say:
1. "No, I've never seen the golf course at night."
2. "Why bother? There's no one home here."
3. "You don't think this bathing suit is too tight, do you?"
4. "Let's go dutch."
5. "Chaperone? What chaperone?"
6. "No, it really doesn't make any difference whether I get
   back at all tonight."
7. "My, but I'm COLD."
8. "YES."

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER _JANUARY, 1970




        Once upon a time a beautiful girl was walking through
   the woods when she came upon a poor little frog who spoke as
   follows:
        "Lady, once upon a time I was a handsome prince, but a
   big black witch turned me into a frog."
        "Oh, that's too bad," said the beautiful girl. "Is there
   anything I can do to help you?"
        "Yes, indeed," replied the frog. "If you will take me
   home with you and put me on your pillow I will be saved."
        So the beautiful girl took the poor little frog with her,
   and the next morning when she awoke there was a handsome
   S,prince. And, do you know, to this day her mother still doesn't
   believe this story.

        A  scientist dreamed up a serum    that would bring
 linanimate objects to life. He tried it out on the statue of a
   great general in Central Park. Sure enough, the statue gave a
   quiver and a moment later the general, creaking a bit in the
7 joints, climbed down from the pedestal. The scientist was
   overjoyed. "I have given you life," he exulted. "Now tell me,
   General, what is the first thing you are going to do?
        "That's easy," rasped the general ripping his revolver
   from his side holster. "I'm going to shoot about two million
   pigeons!"

   If she calls you in the bedroom in the middle of the night
   And thru her half-closed eyelids you detect a tell tale light,
   If her bosom heaves in tumult like the tide upon the ocean
   And her voice is soft and tremulous, betraying her emotion;
   If her nostrils dilate wildly with each panting, labored breath
   And her luscious body trembles, as does one approaching
      death;
   If she begs you and implores you, as she grasps with trembling
     hand
 ) To alleviate her suffering with a pitiful demand ...
   Buddy, that's asthma!

        How do you catch an elephant?
        Dig a hole in the ground, fill it with ashes, and line the
   rim with peas.
        When the elephant comes to take a pea, you kick him in
   the ash hole.

        A virile Texan went to an Alaskan bar where he was told
   there were three things he had to do to prove himself a man.
   First, he had to drink a fifth of whiskey straight down. Then,
   he had to make love to an Eskimo maiden. Third, he had to
   kill a polar bear. He had no trouble with the whiskey which he
   drank straight down. He then left the bar and returned an hour
   later, his clothes ripped to shreds, his body badly lacerated.
        "Now," he moaned, "where's the Eskimo I have to kill."


        CE: "What would you say if I stole a kiss?"
        She:"What would you say to a guy who had a chance to
   steal an automobile but only took the windshield wiper?"

        And then there was the Liberal Arts student who let his
  EE roommate fix him up for a date with Allis-Chalmers.

       I found out the other day what doctors do with all those
 urine samples- It comes in a square bottle and is called
 POLISH LEATHER.

       A man was having trouble with his parakeet. Every night
 when he came home from work, the bird would fly up on his
 shoulder and pick holes in his shirt. After thoughtful
 deliberation the man decided that the only solution was to file
 off the bird's beak. So he went to the hardware store to buy a
 file.
      When the salesman found out why the man wanted the
 file, he tried to talk him ouf of it, explaining that the parakeet
 could not eat without his beak. But it was all to no avail, so he
 reluctantly sold him the file.
      A few weeks later the man was back in the hardware
 store and the salesman recognized him.
      "How's your parakeet?" asked the salesman.
      "Oh, he's dead," the man replied.
      "See, I told you so! I knew that your bird could die
 because he couldn't eat with his beak filed off!"
      "Yeah," replied the man, "but I think he was dead when
 I took his head out of the vice!"

      A man hired two Poloks to do some routine cleaning
 work for his business. One morning upon entering the
 storeroom, he found one Polok hanging by his feet from the
 ceiling while the other was busily sweeping the floor.
 Somewhat startled, he asked the busy one, "What the heck's
 he doing up there?"
      "Oh, he thinks he's a lightbulb," was the answer.
      "Well, he's fired," shouted the manager.
      With that, the inverted Polok descended and left without
 a word. Then his friend threw down his broom and started to
 leave himself.
      "Hey, come back," said the manager, "I didn't fire
you!"
      "Nothin' doin'," came the reply, "I'm not working in

      An A.E. phoned a veterinarian.
      "Say, Doc," he said, "I've got a sick cat. He just lies
around and licks his paws. He has no appetite. What shall I do
for him?"
      "Give him a pint of castor oil," was the reply.
      Somewhat dubious the A.E. forced the cat to take the
pint of castor oil. A couple of days later he met the vet in
town. "How's your sick calf?" asked the vet.
      "Sick calf! That was a sick cat I had."
      "You didn't give him the castor oil, did you?"
      "Sure did," said the A.E. "Last time I saw him he was
going over the hill with five other cats. Two were digging, two
were covering up, and one was scouting for new territory."

      As the drunk A.E. staggered up to the bar, he spoke to
a woman and her pet duck who were having a drink.
     Drunk: "Boy that sure is a good looking pig you have
there."
     Woman: "That's no pig, you idiot, that's a duck!"
     Drunk: "I was talking to the duck!"

Some chemical engineers prefer the North


Some chemical engineers prefer the South


Unlike our peers in industry, our major U.S. chemical manu-
facturing is done in only four communities. Therefore chem-
ical engineers who join us run less risk of being suddenly
uprooted from a community they like.* Subjects to occupy
their thoughts between breakfast and dinnertime:

What CHEMICAL ENGINEERS do at Kodak
Photographic coatings and processes must be designed to balance per-
haps seven critical diffusion and reaction steps necessary to form a
color image in "chemical reactors" as thin as 1/10,000 in.
  In photography and beyond, we work with surface diffusion of chemi-
sorbed species; rheology of non-Newtonian fluids; solid-phase poly-
merization; high-temperature vapor-phase pyrolysis; liquid-phase air oxi-
dations; desalting by reverse osmosis; new fiber yarn configurations.
More general: design of plant and equipment from laboratory data through
mathematical modeling and dynamic simulation; drying operations for
fibers, plastics, and chemicals; study of transport phenomena-mass,
fluid, heat; waste disposal and pollution control; on-line manufacturing
problems.
*If you happen to be a very serious-minded person and consider geography
an unsound basis on which to choose engineering employment, we had better
not mention the whippersnapper young chemist who admitted that he had
picked us over another company because he liked the sound from Rochester
radio stations, but admitted this only after moving into a spot where he was
responsible for the work of some 5,000 people.


For some chemical engineers this line of persuasion just
wastes ink. Getting tied into one town is precisely what they
wish to avoid, and the spouse, if any, may feel the same.
For them we offer lively duty in marketing. This consists of
working out a match between what's needed by our far-
flung chemical customers and what's created by the root-
loving engineers.

Xerox:

For engineers

who think

of more than

engineering.


Creative people like John Gardner
see engineering as only one outlet
for their talents.
Among John's other concerns is today's
widespread shortage of technical talent.
Due in large part, as he sees it,
to children's lack of exposure to the
excitement of science.
John's doing something about it.
He's turned the Gardner basement into a
part-time laboratory, with almost-weekly
demonstrations and projects for
neighborhood kids. Where children as
young as seven make simple photoelectric
devices. Measure ballistic projectile
velocities. And explore subjects like
polarized light, fiber optics, and electronic
calculators, with the help of equipment
loaned by Xerox.
"My biggest delight," John recalls, "was
seeing the first youngster's face light up
when he gave his home-made electric
motor a shove, and it kept moving."
"Children's interests," John maintains,
"should be stimulated early. Not by


spoon-feeding answers, but by stimulating
them to question."
As an Area Manager in our Advanced
Development Department, John asks-and
answers-some interesting questions of his
own. If you'd like to work for the kind of
firm that respects, supports and recognizes
people like John, why not talk to us about
the opportunities at our suburban
Rochester, New York facilities. Your degree
in Engineering or Science may qualify you
for some intriguing openings in a broad
spectrum of developmental and
manufacturing areas.

                That's sort of like asking why a banker goes to
            work in a bank.
                A guy goes to work where the best work is.
            And some of the best engineering work around today
            is in and around factories.
                What would you say to designing the numerical
            control system for an automated steel mill?
                Or developing quality control procedures for the
            world's most powerful airplane engine?
                Or managing a production team responsible
            for delivering power generation equipment
            to utility customers?
                And what would you say to a General Electric
            program that puts you right to work on jobs like those?
                We figure if you're ready for our Manufacturing
            Management Program, you're ready for that kind
            of responsibility. Right from the start.
                So our program packs about ten years of manu.
            facturing experience into about three years of work.
            And the work will take you all around the country.
                Ask GE's top management people what they
            thought about starting out in a factory. Many will tell
            you it was the best decision they could have made.
                And where will you find those managers today?
            Running our factories, of course.

Dear Editor:
      I wish to congratulate you on your courage to make an
honest appraisal in your recent editorial (October-November
1969) of the Skyscraper Engineer as it exists today. Certainly I
concur with you that the only comments I hear relative to the
Skyscraper Engineer relate to the jokes and technicuties. It is
indeed time for us to examine the original objectives of this
magazine and to revise as necessary so that criteria and an
operational play can be established for an undergraduate
engineer's magazine which provides a communication medium
concomitant with our present objectives and problems.
                          Sincerely,
                          A. G. Holzman
                          Professor and Chairman

                          Systems Management Engineering
                          And Operations Research
 Dear Sir;
      I read the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER whenever it
 comes out and almost always glance at the puzzle to see just
 how difficult you have made it to win the $5.00 prize. The
 problems are invariably impossible or extremely difficult to
 solve. I was just wondering, does anyone ever try to solve
 them?
                                        A dumb engineer
(Ed.) Engineers who spend many hours a week solving
    homework problems, apparently don't have any spare
    energy to solve extra problems even when a five dollar bill
    is at stake. At this writing only one person has attempted
    last month's puzzles and he only found two correct (of
    four) solutions. In an effort to arouse more interest in our
    Skycapers we have raised the kitty to a $10.00 minimum
    (more if the previous month's solutions haven't been
    turned in) and made the problems somewhat easier. (see
    page 18)
    Starting with this issue we would like to make
LETTERS     TO   THE   EDITOR    a  regular feature  of
SKYSCRAPER. Comments on any article, joke, or article you
would like to see in SKYSCRAPER from any student or
faculty member are welcome. Also, if you would like to a)
gripe b) suggest c) attack d) debate e) cry about f) none of
these, anything concerning the University of Pittsburgh's
Engineering School, put your thoughts down in writing and
send them to SKYSCRAPER. If we think you have something
worthwhile to say it will appear on the OPINION page of
SKYSCRAPER. (see page 8)
     Letters or "opinions" need not be typewritten, printed
or even written in English. Seriously, here is your chance to
"talk" with at least 1200 fellow engineers about how you feel
about what's happening to you. Take a little time out and
communicate.
