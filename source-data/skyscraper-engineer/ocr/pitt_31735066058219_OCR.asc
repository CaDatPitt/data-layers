“. . .Give him the opportunity to grow”

This is Joseph A. Neubauer. He is an important member
in the Columbia-Southern organization.

Right now, Mr. Neubauer is Technical Director of the
Corporation. He has been on the move, upward, ever
since he joined Columbia-Southern after graduation
from college.

His progress is worth emulation. But initiative alone
is not always the answer to a man’s career. You can’t
launch an ocean liner in a mountain stream. Neither can
a man travel far in an unprogressive, stagnant organi-
zation. A man needs freedom to put his ideas into action;
he needs to move ahead without waiting for vacancies
to occur from death or retirement. We believe Joe
'N'eu'bauer’s story will interest you and give you something
to think about.

He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in
Chemical Engineering from Case Institute of Technology
in 1932. In 1933, a depression year, he joined Columbia-
Southern as a production operator. Within a year, he
was named shift foreman.

Shortly afterward, Joe was assigned to the Develop-
ment Department to work out some problems involving
the Soda Ash process. Following this he supervised the

engineering and construction of Columbia-Southern’s
ﬁrst chlorine unit at the Barberton, Ohio plant. He
became assistant production manager at Barberton and,
in 1942, was assigned to engineering and construction
of the plant at Natrium, West Virginia.

He was elevated to superintendent of operations at
Natrium and in 1946 moved to Pittsburgh as technical
assistant to the Vice President. In 1949 he was named
Technical Director of the Corporation.

Recently he was selected and sent by Columbia-
Southern to take the Advanced Management Program
at Harvard University.

Joe Neubauer has some good advice to pass on to the
1954 graduate. “The main thing for a graduate is to
select a company which will give him the opportunity
to grow. In the Columbia-Southern organization, the
road to top positions is open from many ﬁelds . . . whether

. it be sales, chemical engineering, electrical engineering

or various other backgrounds. I would strongly advise
any graduate who has an interest in the future to look
into the opportunities at Columbia-Southern.”

YEARS
or NEW
IDEAS

T) MAINTAIN a top position in the
aircraft industry for more than 36 years re-
quires the engineering of new designs through
the application of engineering experience plus
imaginative thinking. Chance Vought Aircraft
has offered the opportunity for such a career
since the day of its founding in 1917 when it
began the design of the VE-7, a two-seated
biplane which was redesigned for the Navy as
the VE-9.

During the past 36 years young engineers
and scientists have been an important source
of these new ideas. Today, more so than ever
before, many interesting career opportunities
are available at Chance Vought as the com-
pany designs the latest versions of the F7U-3
Cutlass, the “Regulus” guided missile and other
high speed ﬁghter aircraft projects.

The achievements of the past 36 years at
Chance Vought, great as they have been, offer
little means of evaluating fully the potential of
aviation’s future. If you are interested in a po-
sition with an unlimited future, a position with
the constant responsibility of evaluating and
applying new ideas, if you are interested in
working for a company with a wealth of experi-
ence in its line and yet ambitious to create the
latest designs in its field, investigate the em-
ployment opportunities at Chance Vought.

Engineering and scientific graduates are
invited to contact their Placement Ofﬁcer to
arrange for a personal interview when the
Chance Vought Engineering Personnel Repre-
sentative visits on campus.

On THE SCIENTIST AND THE ENGINEER

by Dr. G. R. Fitterer

Engineering educators are often asked to explain
the difference between the scientist and the engineer.
The answer is that the engineer is a scientist who not
only has taken specialized courses in the sciences, but
who has gone on to study methods of reducing the
sciences to some useful object or process.

But, the question is asked, do not the scientists take
many more fundamental scientific courses than the
engineer; is he not better versed in the sciences than
the engineer? The answer can only be obtained by
comparing curricula for the two degree courses and
this has been done for the B.S. degrees in Chemistry
Honors Major and Chemical Engineering inasmuch
as they are the most easily compared.

It is obvious from the table that the chemist is re-
quired to take at least a total of 70 credits in the sci-
ences as compared to 117 credits in the sciences re-
quired of the Chemical Engineer.

None of the above is intended to imply that the
chemistry honors major curriculum is easier or less
effective, but it does indicate quite clearly that the en-
gineer is a scientist and can more than match technical
courses with the science major students.

MARCH, 1954

Of course, the ultimate aims of the two curricula
are different. In the science major courses, it is not
intended that a need for direct application of scientific
principles be built up in the mind of the student. It is
hoped that he will pursue his science for the pure joy
of unraveling some of the peculiarities of natural
processes.

John L. Synge, Professor of theoretical Physics at
the Dublin Institute of Advanced Studies, in his book
Science-Sense and Nonsense suggests that it is neces-
sary for the physicist and the engineer to dive from
the world of reality into the world of mathematics in
which he must be able to swim. However, he must
then climb out of the pool of mathematics back into
the world of reality carrying his mathematical pre-
diction regarding the physics or engineering process
in his teeth. Synge facetiously suggests that unless the
physicist climbs back out of this pool, he will die be-
cause he has lungs, whereas the mathematician has
gills and may remain in the pool indefinitely. Contrari-
ly, the mathematician cannot come out of the pool for
long because he is not able to breathe long in the
world of reality.

This, of course, is not altogether true because some
of our greatest mathematicians are physicists and engi-
neers, and vice versa.

What is more beautiful today than the fact that an
electrical engineer can start with an abstract mathe-
matical equation, determine its characteristics, even
in three dimensions, then design and build accuratel
operating airborne radar equipment. Similar thread);
can be drawn today from almost any one of the pure
sciences to the ultimate of applications in all the fields
of engineering.

The point which should be emphasized for the pur-
poses of the engineering student is that he is being
trained as a scientist as well as an engineer and that
he is most effective when he cooperates with the sci-
entist and keeps in continuous touch with his devel-
opments.

This is particularly true with the engineer after
graduation. He has been educated to read and under-
stand the sciences as well as to make use of them. If
he does not periodically plunge into the pool of pure
sciences to replenish his knowledge, he becomes stag-

nant and ineffective. If he intends to remain an engi-
neer, he should see to it that he does not remain in the
pool so long, however, that he begins to grow gills.

C Donald L. (Don) Dresser was a Physics Ma-
jor at Beloit, class of '50. He was a member of
Sigma Chi; played basketball, and shot golf in
the 70’s. He received his Masters from the U.
of Wisconsin in 195 1.

Before coming to Allison something over a
year ago, Don was recalled to military service
and served another 16 months in the Navy.

Now, he is a specialist in the instrumentation
and electronics group at Allison. Don was as-
signed a problem in studying the air ﬂow
through jet engine compressors with a hot wire
anemometer. It was his job all the way, working
with the vendor in supplying necessary equip-
ment which was developed to study rotating
stall in axial flow compressors.

Don is shown making an adjustment on one
of the probe actuators of the anemometer on a

jet engine in a test cell. Cables from the ane-
mometer lead to the control room panel where
results are recorded and studied.

The very nature of Allison business contin-
ually presents a variety of challenging problems
to the engineering staff, which—-along with the
Mechanical Engineers, Aeronautical Engineers,
Electrical Engineers, Metallurgical Engineers,
Chemical Engineers and Industrial Engineers-
includes quite a few majors in Math and Physics
like Don.

Allison needs more technically trained peo-
ple, especially young graduate engineers to help
handle the increasing work load in a field where
future development is unlimited. Why not plan
NOW for your engineering career at Allison,
the only manufacturer whose jet engines have
accumulated over three million hours in the air!

of photography to engineering methods.

BY PROFESSOR T. G. BECKWITH

Photographic practice and the fields of engineering
are in many ways very m11ch inter-dependent. Of
course the photographic industry relies quite heavily
upon engineering for the development of such things
as superspeed movies, electronic flash, fast shutters,
and above all for economical production methods. On
the other hand there are many engineering techniques
and practices that are completely dependent upon the
photographic process for their existence. This article

will cite and discuss examples of photography in en-
gineering. Let us start with a photographic practice
which becomes more and more useful to the engineer
in this day of fast moving machines and machine parts.

Many engineering problems have been solved by
the use of high speed photography or “magnified
time.” High speed movies are used to study the action
of rapidly moving mechanical devices, combustion
phenomena and other actions too rapid for the human
eye to follow. Figure 1 shovsgs another type of high
speed” photograph—“frozen time.” Pictures of this
type are made possible by flash photography using ex-
posures in the order of two or three micro-seconds.

Schlieren photographs and “shadowgraphs” are spe-
cial applications of high speed photography which
are used to record pressure distributions in compressi-
ble mediums. The shadowgraph yields similar data
with a somewhat different setup.

Radiographs (X-ray and gamma-ray inspection) of
engineering materials and fabrication has come into
wide spread use. In fact, certain code specifications
require 100% radiographic inspection of all welds.
The only satisfactory method of recording is by pho-
tography. Figure 2 shows results to be expected from
an “unsatisfactory” and from a “satisfactory” weld.

 

 

Figure 2. X-Ray inspection photograph of a weld. The upper
photo indicates a poor weld because of porosity. The lower photo
shows a satisfactory weld.

Cathode ray oscilloscopes and light-beam type
oscillographs are measuring devices to record any en-
gineering quantity that may be “transduced” into an
electrical voltage. In the electrical engineering ﬁeld
the signal may be in the form of a voltage to begin
with. In other cases such things as pressure, displace-
ment, acceleration, unit strain, etc. must be transform-
ed by proper transducers. Photographic methods are
required for recording, particularly when the measur-
ed quantity varies quite rapidly or is a “transient”.

Engineering is often concerned with things of mi-
croscopic size. This is particularly true in the field of
metallurgical engineering. Here, photomicrographs
provide a means for making a permanent record. Fig-
ure 3 shows the transition zone of a weld and locates
the points where hardness measurements have been
taken by means of a Knoop Hardness Tester.

The above examples represent applications whose
results would be extremely difficult or perhaps impos-
sible without the use of photographic recording. In

MARCH,1954

The diamond shaped depressions were made by Knoop hardness
tests.
addition there are many other engineering applica-
tions where photography considerably aids or simpli-
fies the process. Here are a few examples of these
practices.

Photoelasticity is an experimental method used to
determine stress distributions through out a loaded
member. The method takes advantage of relations
between the optical properties of certain transparent
materials and the stress distribution in them. Figure
4 is an example of a typical photoelastic pattern. It is
obvious that the photograph is the practical method
for making the record.

Figure 4. Here are photoelastic stress paterns in a notched bar.
The upper bar is in tension and the lower bar is in bending. Each
line represents a particular stress value.

Another experimental method for determining
stress distributions is stress-coat. A brittle lacquer is
sprayed over the actual machine part or member,
which is then loaded. The lacquer being both brittle
and relatively weak, fails. The strain which is required
for the initial formation of the cracks may be deter-

mined by calibration and the direction of the cracks

shows the principal stress directions. Here again, the
ﬁnal record of the pattern would be difficult to ob-
tain without photography. See Figure 5.

Figure 5. Crack formation in brittle lacquer sprayed on the
surface of a pressure vessel head shows areas and directions of
high stresses.

Photomacrographs are simply “close-up portraits”
of almost any engineering object. The shot is usually
taken with the idea that it will be reproduced at ap-
proximately “full scale.” Figure 6 is typical.

The reader is probably familiar with photos show-
ing a diver in several different positions assumed
during the dive, all shown on the same protograph.
Such a picture requires rather elaborate electronic
equipment; however, similar results are often possible
simply by taking numerous “double-exposures.”

In test work it is often desirable to make a number
of simultaneous instrument readings. The aeronautical
ﬁeld provides a good example. In wind-tunnel work it

lb

is often necessary to measure pressure distributions
over a model such as an airfoil. As many as 50 mano-
meter readings may be required. Naturally, these

readings must be made under the same conditions
of attitude, air speed, density, etc. To obtain simul-
taneous readings it is the practice to place the mano-
meters in a bank and simply photograph them at the
proper moment. This not only insures simultaneous
readings but also provides permanent records.

Micro-ﬁlming is a technique often used to make
permanent records of important drawings, technical
articles or papers so that they do not take up so much
room.

Record shots of laboratory or industrial setups is
a category which might include almost any photo-
graph taken for use in a report, a_technical article or
simply to be filed for the “record.” Figure 7 is an ex-
ample which shows a special welding fixture for use
with submerged arc welding. Subject matter could
include bridges, building structures, testing rigs, spe-
cial laboratory setups, etc.

 igr 7. Special fixure for use wih submerged arc wding.

There are no doubt many, many more examples of

.the application of photography to engineering. The

above lists, however, should show that engineering
makes very good use of photography in many of its
important processes and techniques.

Aside from the fact that photography lends itself
so handily to certain processes, the engineer has a
unique background for his appreciation of the “pic-
ture.” One of his first courses in engineering school is
mechanical drawing. He is taught the art of adequate-
ly describing even such a simple thing as a machine
screw by words alone. He uses the “sketch” to trans-
mit engineering ideas and thought. He knows that
the graphical presentation is both efficient and prac-
tical and that efficiency and practicality are by-words
to the engineer.

Many large companies provide complete photo-
graphic services and personnel, which are available

ENGINEERING

BY DR. R. A. PATTON

Dr. R. A. Patton received his graduate education at
Pitt where he now is Professor of Psychology and chair-
man of the department. He was a Research Fellow at
the University from 1940 to 1944 under grants from
the Buhl Foundation and the Williams-Waterman Fund
of the Research Corporation, New York. He spent a
number of years in full time research in areas related to
the field of mental disorders at the Psychiatic Institute
before assuming his present position. He is the author
of about 40 chapters and experimental papers. His
present research deals with the relationship of brain
damage to the behaviour of the rhesus monkey.

During the war, military authorities in all of the
armed services came to realize that the weapons and
machines of warfare were only as good as their
human operators. Bomber and fighter missions suc-
ceeded only when men moved proper controls in
proper sequence. Complicated bomb sights functioned
properly when trained bombardiers made certain ad-
justments. Shells hit targets when radar and fire-
control operators were able to become an integral part
of a weapon system which included many components.

Very often when these systems failed the “human
error” was found to be a consequence of machine
design rather than faulty operator selection or train-
ing. In designing new devices, insufficent attention
was given to the capabilities and limitations of the
men who were to operate them.

Quite often the machine was designed to require
a greater perceptual capacity or more muscular dex-
terlty than the operator possessed. The tailoring

of machines to fit men has come to be known as
Human Engineering and has required for the first
time a fruitful working alliance between engineers
and psychologists. Human engineering then is defined
as engineering design in relation to man’s anatomical,
physiological, and psychological capabilities and limi-
tations.

Much work has been done in the design of machine
controls, their location and their sequence of operation.
Much information is available on the optimal shape
of levers, knobs, and buttons. Similarly there are ex-
perimental data on the design of instrument dials;
one must know about their readability with reference
to accuracy and order of presentation. Those of you
who have studied the development of servo—mechan-
isms know that there are many problems in relating
feed-back devices to the human operator. Indeed,
many of the«~neuro-muscular reflex systems of man
himself have_ all the characteristics of error-
informed feedback systems. New information about
these systems is being gained with the help of engi-
neering methods which were evolved originally for the

description of mechanical or electronic systems.

The trend in many of the areas just mentioned has
been the attempt to engineer the human operator
more efficiently into the system. The standard engi-
neering approach has been called the “philosophy of
assemblage.” A new system is built up by assembling
available components and modifying them. When the
imputs and outputs of these components do not mach,
a new unit is added to take care of the discrepancy.
When the units are finally brought together, incom-
patibilities often appear which are hard to anticipate
and even harder to eliminate. Here is where the
human operator in the past has been introduced (as
a last resort). As one example, a heavy bomber has
more that 250 switches, handles, dials, and indicators
representing the imputs and outputs for which a pilot
is a computer or converter. Since many of these in-
dividual conversions were themselves too complex to
be automatically cared for, it is not surprising that all
of them in combination can give trouble to a pilot.

A second, and newer, engineering method is called
“systems engineering” and does not begin devising a
new system by modifying an old system or adding
components. Rather, this method begins with a com-
plete description of the task to be performed and is
then expressed abstractly in logical or mathematical
form describing the dynamic or time—varying char-
acteristics. When such a mathematical design has been
formulated, its performance can be determined under
a wide range of operating conditions by simulation
techniques utilizing electronic computers or analog
devices. When these tests are passed, components are
selected on the basis of performance specifications
indicated.

One of the greatest handicaps in applying this
method to large systems involving a human operator
is the absence of such mathematical descriptions of
human behavior. It is encouraging to note that many
psychologists are actually working in this area now.
Performance in behavioral tests is being measured in
such a way that the relationship with time is not lost.
The results of such research can be expressed first, in
differential equations with time as the independent
variable and second, as statements of the relation-
ships between the parameters of these equations and
other variables.

The communication engineer and the experimental
psychologist have recently learned to speak a common
language in their investigation of common problems
in referring to the increasing use of “infonnation

theory” as a tool of research. Continued on page 36

quality steel meets every requirement for
these vital parts. The precision machining

the job.

Reductio ad optimum

0 “Reduced to the most favorable
degree” describes exactly what hap-
pens to the huge U-S-S CARILLOY
steel ingots from which are formed
the rugged main columns in the land-
ing gears of every B-36.

To provide the tremendous
strength and shock resistance re-
quired to safely cushion the landing
impact of 179 tons of bomber weight
—and, at the same time, to keep
the weight of the -landing gear as low
as possible—calls not only for steel
of the highest quality but also for
unusual procedures in fabrication as
well.

Consider these facts. The original
ingot weighs approximately 37,500
lbs. From it are produced two cylin-
drical columns weighing only about
1200 lbs. apiece. Approximately 93 %
of the steel is removed by machining
to proper contour and in hollow-
boring the column. When ﬁnished, a

mere 7% of the original ingot is left
to do the job.

That U-S-S CARILLOY steel has
been exclusively selected for this ap-
plication—one of the most exacting
in the aircraft industry——is, we be-
lieve, highly significant. The same
care and skill, the same ability to
meet requirements that are beyond
the ordinary, go into every order of
CARILLOY steel we make—whether
it’s an ingot of giant size or a few
tons of special steel.

U-S-S CARILLOY is just one more
example of the better steel products
developed and produced by United

An explanation of the Color Television system and its com-

patability to black and white receivers.

During the past few years, many systems have been
developed for color television, but only one, the
National Television Systems Committee system has
proven compatible to black and white television. This
system was developed by NTSC, a group of two
hundred scientists and electronics engineers from
ninety-one companies, working as one unit for the past
two years. The primary function of this group was to
find a method by which full color pictures could be
transmitted and then received on color sets, and also
on monochrome sets in black and white without any
modification to those receivers. On April 14, 1953,
the Radio Corporation of America demonstrated this
system to the Wolverton Committee of the House o-f
Representatives and then on April 15, 1953 to a
group of industrial leaders.

With a definite system set up, they met and con-
quered problems of the transmitting camera, trans-
mission of color, the television studio, and the receiv-
ing tube or kinescope. Here are some of the problems
they solved.

Before any color picture could be considered the
problem of color was first to be examined. A color,
coming from any source, is specified in three simple
terms: brightness, hue, and saturation; that _is, how
much light is being radiated, what color it is, and of
what purity it is. If two small areas, which are close

the viewer will see one area illuminated by the mix-
ture of lights, giving one color. Figure 1 shows a
number of small areas lighted by red and green light
sources. The left-hand picture shows what actually
is taking place, and the right-hand picture shows what
the eye sees. This remains true whether the areas are
illuminated by both sources continuously or by flash-
ing each color intermittently. Any color other than
a primary color is made up of a combination of pri-
mary colors in different ratios. Thus, by starting with
the primary colors of red, green, and blue, we may
make any color that is desired along with its hue,
saturation and brightness. The ratio of their inten-
sities determine the hue and saturation; that is, how
much light is radiated to produce the resulting color.

Yellow

  

 

Figure I. When two colors are proiected on two tiny surfaces,
the combined areas radiate one color instead of two areas of dots.

The sum of the individual brightness equals the total
brightness. If the three primary colors are projected
on a surface with their intensities equal, and each
color slightly overlapping the other, they will produce
the color spectrum shown in Figure 2. A Combination
of any two gives a different color, while a combination
of all three at the correct intensities will produce white
light. By experimentation, it was found that of the
total brightness within the white light, green light
constituted 59 per cent, red light 30 per cent, and
blue light 11 per cent.

In color television, three signals are developed, one
for each of the primary colors. When the camera is
viewing a white, gray, or black scene, the camera
circuits are arranged in such a manner that these
signals are equal in amplitude. This is also true in the

receiver. When transmitting and receiving a color
picture, a luminance signal is derived which is made
up of the respective percentages of red, green, and
blue light. When this signal is applied to the mon-
ochrome set, it will give the correct brightness to the
black and white picture.

One of the main problems encountered was that of
placing all the information—the monochrome values,
hue and saturation values, and sound values—within
the same channel. Since the monochrome values car-
ried the picture detail, which is the same for the color
picture, the hues and saturation could be superim-
posed in a rough manner over the monochrome
picture. Thus the color carrier does not have to take
up as much of the channel as does the picture carrier,
eliminating any overcrowding.

Another problem that was solved was the inability
of monochrome sets to receive the picture in black
and white while ignoring the color aspect. This incom-
patibility was corrected by making the color signal
carrier a definite numerical frequency. When this
frequency is kept in exact relationship, the mono-
chrome receiver ignores the color carrier. The color
information is transmitted on a color subcarrier of
3.58 megacycles. This subcarrier is modulated in
both amplitude and phase so that the amplitude cor-
responds to the saturation of color, while the phase
corresponds to the hue. When the amplitude of a color
is maximum, that color is saturated; when the am-
plitude is zero, the color is either neutral or some
shade of gray.

Present day color transmission uses three typical
black and white cameras aranged around a pair of
crossed dichroic mirrors, which break up the light
waves so that only the red light is passed to one
camera, blue to another, and green to the third. A
single tube camera is now being developed to elim-
inate this bulky equipment. As shown in Figure 3,

the signals from the three cameras are fed into a mix-
ing, or more commonly called the matrixing unit
where these signals are combined in the various cir-
cuits to produce the luminance signal and the two
components for the resulting color subcarrier. The
signal then travels through a series of filters and mod-
ulators, into another mixer unit, and finally results
as the video signal.

As may be expected, the color receivers that are
developed to operate with the NTSC system are more
complicated than the standard monochrome receivers.
These sets will be more costly, but when they are
made by mass production, and include new parts, such
as the transistor, the price will be considerably re-
duced. A probable estimate of a color receiver of the
17-inch variety would range between $700 and $900.
These receivers are basically black and white sets
with essential circuits for detecting the signal, and a
new type kinescope.

The complexity and the types of circuits that will
be used depend on the type of picture tube employed.
The monochrome receiver uses a system by which the
signal is taken directly to the kinescope from the
video detector. The color sets cannot apply a chrom-
aticity or color signal directly to the picture tube, and
therefore, the circuits in these sets must produce a

signal for each of the primary colors. A color de-
coder is also needed to produce these desired signals.
In the future, a tricolor kinescope may be produced
that will do this automatically.

The video detector, or the circuit that picks up and
processes the video signal, has two outputs: A wide
band output for the luminance or brightness signal,
and a smaller band for chromaticity, which is equal to
the present video signals. The main signal is passed
into a matrixing unit where the three signals are sep-
arated, and the respective colors developed. It takes
the color signal and either adds to or subtracts from it.
From this unit the three signals are then applied to
the kinescope. A 3.58 megacycle signal must be gen-
erated and held in exact synchronization with the
color subcarrier signal from the transmitting point in
order to obtain precise color decoding. When this is
in correct operation, the monochrome set can receive
a color signal and ignore a color subcarrier, showing
that picture in black and white.

The greatest problem in the development of the
color television is the tri-color kinescope. Two suc-
cessful kinescopes have been produced. Figure 4
shows a deflection mask tube in which the variation in

Editor's Note: This is the fourth of a series of articles
on some of the industrial giants of Pittsburgh pointing
out to the students the opportunities for engineers in
Pittsburgh—the future engineering center of the world.

From relative obscurity to a present position of
leadership among the nonferrous metals is the amaz-
ing story of the growth of the aluminum industry in
the last half century. It is also the story of the Alumi-
num Company of America. Charles Martin Hall’s
discovery of an economical electrolytic process

Alcoa, the world leader in the aluminum
industry and aluminum innovations,
tells its story.

for reducing aluminum oxide to aluminum metal
made possible the birth of the industry. Armed
with his patented process, Hall teamed up with some
Pittsburgh businessmen in 1888, and The Pittsburgh
Reduction Company was formed to produce and mar-
ket aluminum made by young Hall’s process. In order
to more closely identify the Company with its opera-
tions, the corporate name was changed to the Alumi-
num Company of America in 1907.

Research and scientific development have been the
moving forces behind the rapid growth of Alcoa and
the aluminum industry. In a mere 65 years, the tech-
nology of aluminum has been developed to a par with
that of metals used since the dawn of civilization. As
a result, a substantial majority of the technical and
administrative people in Alcoa have engineering and
scientific backgrounds.

Youth is a characteristic both of Alcoa and of its
personnel. The whole history of the industry is
spanned by the lifetime of Alcoa’s Board Chairman,
Arthur Vining Davis. Mr. Davis aided when The Pitts-
burgh Reduction Company poured its first aluminum;
he rang industrial doorbells to make some of the first
sales of aluminum produced by the infant industry.
Today he heads the Board of the country’s largest alu-
minum company. Hall and Davis were men just out
of college when they helped usher in a new industrial
era; today Alcoa looks harder than ever toward the
recent college graduate as its source of men to fill to-
morrow’s executive spots.

The years between 1888 and the first World War
were ones of hard selling and good engineering. Peo-
ple who laughed at the possibility that aluminum
would ever find substantial markets found them-
selves taking notice as Alcoa fought successfully for ac-

ceptance of aluminum. The first real introduction of
the metal in any quantity was in cookware; traveling
“pots and pans” salesmen have brought aluminum to
American doors for over fifty years. At the same time
aluminum was also proving itself as an electrical con-
ductor and had many uses in the transportation field.

In 1939, generally considered as the starting point
of World War II, Alcoa was the sole domestic primary
producer of aluminum, with an output of 163,500 tons.
The year before, Alcoa’s 50th anniversary, marked pro-
duction of 143,000 tons. Aluminum was selling at 200
a pound. This was quite an advance from 1888: $8.00
a pound, and total output of less than 10 tons!

The impact of the war on the aluminum industry
was tremendous; no other basic metal was required to
make such an expansion of its producing facilities.
Steel expanded 10%; copper, 50%; aluminum, 600%!
America’s annual capacity to produce aluminum rose
from the 1939 figure of 187,500 tons to over 1,150,000
tons by 1944. if

Predictions at the end of the war were that the alu-
minum industry would have more metal than it could
sell. Instead, the productive capacity created to fill
fabulous military demands has had to be increased
still further as civilian demand has run constantly
ahead of the industry’s ability to fill it. There were
readjustments in facilities after the war that forced

the uneconomic smelting plants to shut down. The re-
maining smelting capacity, 675,000 tons, was available
for the post-war economy. The Korean war and the
natural pressures of the market have led the industry
to further expand to a new high in capacity, all of it
privately owned and financed.

By the end of 1954 there will be at least four and
perhaps five primary producers of aluminum in the
industry. With all facilities in operation, the nation
will have an annual smelting capacity of 1,500,00 tons
—eight times the 1939 capacity and 30% higher than
the wartime peak. Alcoa’s share of this will be 570,000
tons a year.

Fabrication is the most diverse activity of the alu-
minum industry. The versatility of Aluminum is
shown by the fact that it can be rolled, cast, forged,
extruded, and drawn. It is produced in sheet, plate,
foil, wire, rod, bar, extrusions, drawn tube, paste and
powder, forgings, die castings, and sand and penna-
nent mold castings. All the technical skills reflected
by these many processes are utilized by the industry,
where alloy development and research are as much a
part of these phases as the establishment of new facili-
ties for production.

The field of engineering and production requires
the largest single group of college graduates in the
industry, and consistently offers opportunities to me-
chanical, metallurgical, industrial, chemical, and elec-
trical engineers. To a somewhat lesser degree, this
field also offers attractive opportunities to civil and
mining engineers.

Mechanical engineers are employed throughout the
industry in design, development, installation, opera-
tion, and maintenance of all types of mechanical
equipment encompassing a wide scope of activity.
Currently, for example, the development, installation
and operation of huge forging and extrusion presses
present the maximum challenge to the ingenuity of
mechanical engineers.

Product. quality control, alloy development and test-
ing, methods of heat treatment and forming, and es-
tablishment and maintenance of fabricating practices
are the responsibility of the metallurgical engineer.
His job in the aluminum industry is challenging. The
increasing importance of high-strength alloys in the
transportation and construction fields, and the need
for alloys with high resistance to corrosion in the ra-
pidly expanding chemical and marine industries are

St. Patrick was an engineer. This fact has been pro-
claimed by engineering schools throughout the west
and midwest for the past fifty years, and has just re-
cently been historically proven. An ancient document
dating back to the time of St. Patrick was recently dis-
covered in Ireland and it contained the words which
every engineer knew it would. “Erin Go Bragh,” which
translated loosely means, “St. Patrick was an engi-
neer.”

Of course, it’s a rather loose translation, but it has
some basis. Didn’t St. Pat drive the snakes out of
Ireland, and wasn’t that the first worm drive! There-
fore, St. Patrick was an engineer. Simple!!!

C-Engineers bow during the Knighting Ceremony in 1905 at the Uni-

versity of Missouri. This was the third celebration of St. Pat's birth-
day and the first one not to be rewarded by disciplinary action.

Well, anyway, that’s the way it started back in 1903,
fifty one years ago, by the engineers at the University
of Missouri. At that time there was little proof that
the Irish saint ever had any connection with the pro-
fession. But needing a vacation, a group of students
from that campus claimed that they had received
knowledge of the saint’s field of endeavor in what they
called a “revelation,” and celebrated his birthday that
first year by cutting all their classes and engaging in
various forms of merriment.

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

As a result of the disciplinary action which followed
shortly thereafter, several of the more active cele-
brants were absent from their classes for a much
longer period. Two years later, however, the celebra-
tion of St. Patrick’s Day by the engineering students
was officially recognized by the university administra-
tion.

Iowa State College and the University of Arkansas
followed Missouri’s lead by establishing a special day
of festivities in 1909. It was not long before most of
the engineering schools west of the Mississippi took
up the cry, and now the “Engineer’s Day” or “Week”
is a very celebrated occasion around those parts. The
east-of-the-Mississippian schools have been somewhat
behind their “younger” brothers to the west but they
are now carrying on the tradition. There is a trend to
hold this festive occasion on Washington’s birthday in
February, he being the first American engineer, but
for this year it’s March 17.

Most of those “western” engineering schools have a
week of celebration filled with such events as float
parades, special Church services, lab exhibits and
Open Houses, barbecues and parties, professional so-

ciety meetings, beard growing contests, tea parties,
senior banquets, campus stunts, Engineers Carnivals,
and last but not least, pre-election political rallies put
on by the candidates for St. Patricia, usually in the
form of a “cheesecake” show. St. Patricia, is then
crowned at the Engineer’s Ball.

The big occasion for most of these schools (besides
the climaxing dance) is the arrival of St. Patrick
dressed in green and gold robes and sporting a beard
which would put Rip Van Winkle to same.

Each year he arrives by a different mode of trans-
portation, using anything from an airplane to a steam
shovel. His favorite “carriage”, however, is the rail-
road handcar. It is said that back in 1914, the actual
body of St. Patrick was resurrected from his grave
in Ireland and brought to the Iowa State Celebration.
After being carried around in a parade, St. Patrick was
called upon to make a speech to the students. Since
being interred for quite a few years and not up on the
latest talk, he was only able to say a few words. “I’m
glad to be here.”

found upon a slab of green marble dug up some three
years ago while excavating for the foundations of the
Engineering laboratory. The characters, more compli-
cated by far more than any ever carved into sphinxes
and mummies of ancient Egypt, have long been a
stumbling block to guns and sons of guns of trans-
lators and even now their meaning is obscure to all
except the Faithful. Ever since the stone was un-
earthed scores of engineers have burned the mid-
night kilowatt and Bull Durham trying to Sherlock
the riddle. They applied to it every known law of
mathematics from the three fundamental operations
to the Theory of Functions and the flow of liquids
down smooth pipes. The last mentioned law was pas-
sed by the city council with the malicious intent of
driving the “friend of the students” out of business.
The Faithful found that this law is very detrimental
to the solving of problems and, in fact, to all student
activity.

“EVer and anon while this great struggle was going
on, in spite of the above difficulty, those interested in
fossils and things primeval have gone to lectures,
dissertations and elaborations on ‘Excavations in the
Far East,’ ‘The remains of Babylon’ or the ‘Origin of
the Brick Bat’ (said lectures being infinitely deader
than the fossils), little dreaming that in their Very
midst was an excavated puzzle that could give ‘Recent
Discoveries in Crete’ cards and spades and beat them
balling-up translators. While these poor misguided
seekers after truth were trying mightily to decipher
the trade marks on a few old crocks and broken tea-
cups dug up in the Garden of Eden or some modern
backyard, the Faithful were slowly but surely unlock-
ing the secret of the great green slab. Only a few days
since was the last kink straightened and the last knot
untied. By an ingenious operation, in which he com-
bined the orthographic projection of three leaves of
a shamrock and the chemical affinities of cork into an
infinite series converging four degrees and twenty
minutes‘ northwest of Dublin, Wray Dudley dis-
covered that the snake and hod, being interpreted,
mean ‘Saint Patrick.’ This was the opening wedge.
Sunny ]im Barnes immediately applied the theory of
least squares to Dudley’s series and, integrated from
Ireland to the bench mark on the Engineering build-
ing and adding a twist of long green for a constant,
found the word ‘Engineer’. The rest was easy. Using

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

This germanium refining,
method keeps impurities
down to less than
5 parts in a billion

A new method of metal reﬁning, currently in use at the
Western Electric plant at Allentown, results in the pro-
duction of germanium that is better than 99.9999995%
pure — the highest degree of purity ever attained in a
manufactured product.

The need for germanium of such exceptional purity
came about when research by Bell Telephone Labora-
tories in the ﬁeld of semi-conductors led to the develop-
ment of transistors, which are manufactured by Western
Electric.

The transistor is a tiny crystal device which can amplify
and oscillate. It reduces space requirements and power
consumption to a minimum.

Various forms which germanium takes before being used in tran-
sistors are shown in this photo. Bar at top is an ingot of ger-
manium after reduction from germanium dioxide. N ext is shown
the germanium ingot after the zone reﬁning process used by
Western Electric. Below the ingots are shown 3 germanium crys-
tals grown by machine, 6 slices cut from these crystals, and several
hundred germanium wafers ready for assembly into transistors.

 

  

 
  
 
   

In this reﬁning apparatus, at Western Electric’s
Allentown, Pa. plant, germanium is passing through
multiple heating zones in tandem, producing a bar containing

impurities of less than 5 parts in a billion for use in transistors.
Note heating coils on the horizontal quartz tube.

Germanium crystals of the size required in transistors
do not occur in nature; they are artiﬁcially grown at
Western Electric. At this stage in transistor manufac-
ture, other elements are introduced in microscopic quan-
tities to aid in controlling the ﬂow of electrons through
the germanium. But before these elements can be intro-
duced, it is necessary to start with germanium of excep-
tional purity, so that the impurities will not interfere
with the elements that are deliberately added.

So Bell Telephone Laboratories devised an entirely new
method of puriﬁcation, known as zone reﬁning, which
was developed to a high-production stage by Western
Electric engineers.

In zone reﬁning a bar of germanium is passed through
a heat zone so that a molten section traverses the length
of the bar carrying the impurities with it and leaving
behind a solidiﬁed section of higher purity. By the use
of multiple heating zone: in tandem, a number of molten
sections traverse the bar. Each reduces the impurity
content thus producing a bar which contains impurities
in the amount of less than ﬁve parts per billion.
Because of the importance of the transistor in elec-
tronics, the zone reﬁning process —— like so many other
Western Electric developments — has been made avail-
able to companies licensed by Western Electric to man-
ufacture transistors.

This is one more example of creative engineering by
Western Electric men. Engineers of all skills — mechan-
ical, electrical, chemical, industrial, metallurgical, and
civil — are needed to help us show the way in funda-
mental manufacturing techniques.

Choose a company not for its bigness or smallness,
but for how it will treat you as an individual. Choose it
not only for its engineering activities alone, but also for
how it is set up to help its engineers develop themselves
professionally. Choose your company with an eye on the
opportunities ahead—and an eye on the future of the
company itself. Above all, select a company that has a
deﬁnite program to help you determine the work for
-which you are best ﬁtted.

Only you can make this vital decision. Whatever it
may be—-good luck! G-10275

KENNETH L. "STEELE

A post with a wide variety of re-
sponsibilities in a company manufac-
turing hundreds of widely different
products which directly inﬂuence the
personal safety of millions of work-
ers all over the world, results in a
position that is both stimulating and
a constant challenge. '

That’s the conclusion of Kenneth
L. Steele, Works Manager of Mine
Safety Appliances Company, Pitts-
burgh. Mr. Steele’s responsibilities
extend to three major manufactur-
ing activities in the Pittsburgh area,
and are quite diversiﬁed. They in-
clude administration of MSA’s in-
dustrial relations program, the in-
dustrial engineering and methods de-
partment, safety in the various
plants, responsibility for the physical
condition of all buildings owned or
leased, and maintenance of all plant
equipment and facilities. The prep-
aration and control of both operat-
ing and capital budgets for each of
these activities also comes under his
supervision.

Mr. Steele was born in Bellevue,
Pennsylvania and attended grade
and high schools in that community.
He was graduated from the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh in 1934 with the
degree of B.S. in Industrial Engi-
neering. Following graduation he
joined the International Business
Machines Corporation, and in 1936

came to MSA’s Sales Engineering
Department. In 1946, he was ap-
pointed Manager of the Sales Engi-
neering Department with the prin-
cipal responsibility of coordinating
the development of new products.

Meanwhile, he attended evening
school at the University of Pitts-
burgh for courses in accounting and
statistics, and Carnegie Institute of
Technology for a chemistry back-
ground. In the spring of 1949 he was
selected to be the ﬁrst man from
MSA to attend the Advanced Man-
agement Course at Harvard’s Grad-
uate School of Business Administra-
tion.

In June of 1949, he was appointed
Factory Superintendent and in July
of 1952 advanced to Works Man-
ager, his present position.

He is a member of the Psi Chapter
of Sigma Tau, the honorary engi-
neering fraternity of the University
of Pittsburgh, and the Pittsburgh
Chapter of the Society for the Ad-
vancement of Management.

ROBERT C. MYERS

Robert C. Myers has recently been
appointed director of product devel-
opment, commercial department,
United States Steel.

In this newly activated position
he will be responsible for the com-
mercialiphases of product planning
and the development of new prod-
ucts.

Mr. Myers will continue to oper-
ate in his capacity as director of
market development of United States
Steel.

A native of Johnstown, Pennsyl-
vania, Mr. Myers is a graduate of
the University of Pittsburgh. After
three years’ experience in sales and
merchandising, he joined U. S. Steel
as a development representative for
Carnegie-Illinois Steel Corporation.
After several promotions he was
made manager of market develop-
ment for Carnegie—Illinois in 1946,
later was made assistant director and
subsequently director of market de-
velopment for United States Steel
Corporation.

Mr. Myers has been active in trade
and civic organizations. He is a for-
mer president of the Pittsburgh In-
dustrial Advertising Council and
treasurer of the Sales Executives
Club of Pittsburgh. He is vice presi-
dent of the National Industrial Ad-
vertisers’ Association, vice president
of the Porcelain Enameling Institute,
and a member of the board of direc-
tors of the Construction Industry
Manufacturers Association. He is a
member of the American Iron and
Steel Institute, the Pittsburgh Cham-
ber of Commerce, and holds oﬂice
in a number of national trade as-
sociations.

million watt spark plug . . .

MARCH, 1954

Calling this jet engine ignitor a
million watt spark plug is an under-
statement. Actually this picture
shows a 1,500 kw discharge that
occurred in 25 microseconds.

One of a series of photographs
taken as we vary voltages and
ignition system design, it helps us
study the arc size and the pene-
tration of the discharge into the
combustion chamber. These and
other studies provide the knowl-
edge necessary for the design of
dependable ignition systems-
systems that will start combustion
at 45,000 foot altitude and —65°
temperature.

Good ignition is important. Yet
ignition research is only one small
phase of our development program.

But this work does suggest how
completely we explore technical
areas to produce dependable air-
craft engines. And it illustrates the
wide variety of tools and tech-
niques we use to solve difiicult
problems.

Here, emphasis is put on “get-
ting the facts” — all the facts. This
makes good sense to recent grad-
uates who want to do real engineer-
ing—explains why so many are
attracted to a career at Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft.

Television Tape Recording
by RCA Opens New Era of
Electronic Photography

In 1956, RCA’s General Sarnoff will
celebrate his 50th year in the ﬁeld of
radio. Looking ahead to that occa-
sion, three years ago, he asked his
family of scientists and researchers
for three gifts to mark that anniver-
sary: (1) A television tape recorder,
(2) An electronic air conditioner, (3)
A true ampliﬁer of light.

Gift No. 1—the video tape recorder-
has already been successfully demon-
strated, two years ahead of time! Both
color and black-and—white TV pictures
were instantly recorded without any pho-
tographic development or processing.

You can imagine the future importance
of this development to television broad-
casting, to motion pictures, education,
industry and national defense. And you
can se-e its entertainment value to you,
in your own home. There the tape equip-
ment could be used for home movies,
and——by connecting it to your television
set—you could make personal recordings
of your favorite TV programs.

Expressing his gratitude for this “gift,”
Gen. Sarnoff said it was only a matter of
time, perhaps two years, before the fin-
ishing touches would bring this record-
ing system to commercial reality. He
described it as the first major step into
an era of “electronic photography.”

Such achievements as this, stemming
from continuous pioneering in research
and engineering, make “RCA” an emblem
of quality, dependability and progress.

On these occasions, St. Patrick is assisted by the
Guard of St. Patrick, a group of outstanding engineer-
ing students who are tapped to this honorary society.
Pledges to the group are called “Squires” and members
of it are known as “Knights.”

The Squires are ‘initiated to the Guard of St. Pat-
rick on the evening of the Engineer’s Ball by being
“knighted” with a two foot slide rule by St. Patrick
and they show their faith by kissing the “Blarney
Stone.”

 

Since the Squires are required to kiss the Blarney
Stone before they become Knights the stone has
caused no little excitement in some of the Universities.
It seems that some of the boys from foreign schools
(any school other than Engineering or Mines) have
made strong attempts to steal it from the Engineers.
But under the protection of the Squires, it has been
kept out of mischievous hands.

A fine thing about these weeks at other schools is

St Pat chose a dirt scoop as his mode of transportation in 1951 at
the University of Missouri.
the fact that all the students take part in the week and
at least 50% of them are in on the planning of it or at
work on the departmental displays. That is what
makes the week what it is—an Engineer's Week.

What will Pitt’s be like? It’s hard to say. The cen-

How to speed production of high
precision iet engine parts

Engineers had the problem of designing a turret lathe
that would machine a stainless steel jet engine part having
a very complicated shape. And the part had to be pro-
duced in volume-—yet with extreme precision. Naturally,
they had to be sure the lathe spindle would be held rigid.
To solve their problem, they mounted the spindle and
gear train on Timken® tapered roller bearings, eliminat-

ing spindle vibration and chatter, insuring high precision.

Here’s how T|MKEN® bearings
maintain spindle rigidity

Timken bearings hold spindles in rigid alignment
because line Contact between rollers and races gives
spindles wide, rigid support. Because the tapered
design of Timken bearings lets them take radial and
thrust loads in any combination, deﬂection is mini-
mized, end-play and chatter eliminated. Spindles

 

maintain their accuracy, year after year.

graduation will involve bearing applications. For help

To be a successful engineer,
above all you must
know how to cut costs

SIMPLE DESIEN CHANGE
T0 STEEL CUTS BBST
FRDM $1.15 T0 31¢

BEFORE any product design is
accepted, the manufacturer asks,
"Can it be built for less money?” Un-
less your designs pass this test they
are likely to be rejected.

Knowing how to use welded steel
gives you the advantage in develop-
ing any product for lowest cost man-
ufacture. That’s because steel is three
times stronger than gray iron, two
and one half times as rigid, and costs
only a third as much per pound.
Therefore, where stiffness or rigidity
is a factor in a design, less than half
the material is necessary.

Here, for example, is how one re-
sourceful engineer put these qualities
to work:

to the engineering staff. Such service is quite useful;
however it is subject to several rather severe limita-
tions. ’

First, such service is subject to priority. An impor-
tant laboratory situation might exist at 10:00 A.M.
and then be forever lost at 10:05 A.M. (We may be
eternally thankful that the Wright brothers had not
only the foresight, but also their own equipment with
which to record a moment of engineering history of
tremendous importance.)

Secondly, with all due respect to the professional
photographer, he is not in the position to fully com-
prehend the technical aspects which he is called upon
to record. He knows how to subdue or emphasize
picture areas with the proper use of film or filters
and how to foreshorten or emphasize distance with

the proper lens selection, but he does not know why .

a particular shot requires this lens or that film or filter.

Thirdly, there are cases where the company photog-
rapher simply does not have the required skill. This
is true when the photography is an integral part of
the process, such as the Schlieren method or photo-
microscopy.

It would seem that the gist of the article up to this
point is to prove that every engineer should be a
“shutter bug.” Such is not entirely the case; however
it must be admitted that the avocation or hobby of
photography does offer very definite advantages to
the engineer. Sooner or later the engineer with the
ability to make a good photograph will have the op-
portunity to make his hobby pay off on the job.

In particular, the engineering student has many
on the job opportunities. A few snap—shots in his lab-
oratory reports will not only bring considerable per-
sonal satisfaction to the student himself, but it can be
guaranteed to impress his instructor also—and he is
the fellow that pays off. Elaborate equipment is not
required. In most cases the same equipment that is
used to record bits of personal domestic historyis com-
pletely satisfactory. A time exposure from a camera
on a steady support will give surprisingly good results.

From the preceding discussion it is only fair to
state that just as fine photography may depend on
engineering skill and knowhow for its tools, so may
many aspects of engineering depend on applied photo-
graphic methods for practical results and lasting rec-

ords. * * *

Broadly defined “communication” would include
any means whick links one mechanism or organism
with another. Within this frame of reference would
come the telephone and radio, speech, printed materi-
al, music, and the ceaseless transmission of volleys of
impulses in neural networks. Indeed the goal-seeking
missiles of modern warfare may be said to com-
municate with their targets. What is this which is
communicated? What theoretical bridge could link
neural impulses with the functioning of relays or tubes
in modern computers? Is there a common basis which
speech may share with telegraphy or radar? Is there
any possible way in which the time-honored concept
of entropy may apply not only to thermodynamics but
also to divergent problems of behavior? Information
theory promises to unify concepts from many fields
not ordinarily regarded as aspects of communication.

A perfectly organized, perfectly controlled physical
system would not require a theory of probability. in
order to predict its behavior. The outcome would be
certain and thus would furnish no information. Most
physical systems, however, whether they be electronic
or behavioral are not perfectly organized and control-
led. The greater the disorganization of such systems
the more information they provide the observer. To
measure information one must measure certainty.
Thus, probability theory gives us a measure of prior
expectation and the information becomes that which
changes anticipated results into certainty. The def-
inition of the “quantity of information” has developed
in large part through the work of Fisher, Shannon,
and Wiener. Some of you may be surprised to find
that information does not refer to meaning. In the
study of messages, either verbal or electronic, infor-
mation measure refers not so much to what is said as
to what could have been said: It turns out to be the
logarithm of the number of choices and a partner of
uncertainty.

It is exciting that the quantity of information also
turns out to be what is known as entropy in statis-
tical mechanics. To those of you who have studied
the physical. sciences it will be of great interest to
find an entropy-like expression as a measure of in-
formation. During the last century and the work of
Clausius, Boltzman, and the retiring genius of Yale
College, Willard Gibbs, this concept preceded enor-

'mous scientific advances. Eddington remarked that

the law that entropy always increases (second law of
thermodynamics) holds the supreme position among
the laws of nature. When such a concept is found in
communication theory it merits serious consideration
indeed. It is possible that information theory may be
utilized to advantage wherever scientific measure-
ment is possible.

Perhaps engineers and psychologists can utilize
these developments to their mutual advantage. We
want our courses in experimental psychology to bene-
fit future engineers. We also want our own students
to have had a background in mathematics and -the
physical sciences. It is our hope that we can work
profitably with the fine school of Engineering here
at Pitt during the coming years.

PRODUCT
ENGINEERING

cc hen considering your ﬁrst engineering job-
ask yourself this:

What kind of person am I? The kind of person
who likes to invent things—or design them?

The kind who likes to be in on the birth of an
idea? Or the kind who likes to meet the challenge
of new designs, new inventions, new ideas — by
ﬁguring out how to build them in quantity at a
price to make them available to the greatest
number of people?

For — the ﬁrst type is bound to be happiest as a
Product Engineer; the second as a Production
Engineer.

In Product Engineering, GM offers you a success-

ful career whether your interest lies in automo-
tive or Diesel engineering, design, fuel and

plastic research, or creating new beauties of‘

motorcar styling.

In Production Engineering, GM also—as has been
proved by its success in mass production of ﬁne
products—is a leader in manufacturing processes

but two examples of the interesting problems confornt-
ing him.

The industrial engineer is also employed in all phas-
es of the industry, but most demand for this training
exists in the fabrication branch where accurate time
study interpretation, job and work simplification,
product cost studies, and plant and equipment lay-
out are typical activities of his. This expanding and
highly important field of engineering is making an
ever-increasing contribution to the improvement of
production techniques.

The refining and smelting operations of the alum-
inum industry offer diversified opportunities to chem-
ical engineers where they are involved in many prob-
lems dealing with the development of metal products,
processes, equipment, and the production and ap-
plication of allied chemical products.

Economic electric power is a prime concern of the '

aluminum industry. The electrical engineer interested
in the generation, transmission, and utilization of
power will find a broad outlet for his educational
training, principally in conjunction with the smelting
operation. The decreasing availability of economic

Marketing is not of itself a part of the “production”
of the metal. However, sales engineering personnel
comprise an important segment of the technical men
in the industry.

Research and development activities have played a
prominent part in the growth of aluminum. This field
provides specialized opportunities in pure and ap-
plied research for men with undergraduate and grad-
uate degrees in electrical, mechanical, metallurgical,
and chemical engineering. Physical and analytical
chemists also perform vital research activities.

Some 85 years ago, five men started a research
group for Alcoa and in that short span of time it has
grown into a $3,000,000 a year project. From its orig-
inal home in part of a building at Alcoa’s New Kens-
ington Works, the Aluminum Research Labs now has
facilities in four locations in the United States.

Its large main laboratories at New Kensington has

These eleven are: Analytical Chemistry Division,
Chemical Metallurgy, Engineering Design, Lubri-

Division.

Their Cleveland branch has a modern fully equip-
ped building for work on castings and forgings of al-
uminum and magnesium. At East St. Louis (Ill.) is
one of the countries newer laboratories and pilot plant,
housing the Alumina and Chemicals Division. At

THE SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

HIDDEN HENCHMAN . . .

Early man used Nature’s rocks and stones to shape
and sharpen his crude tools and weapons. Today,
industry has at its command abrasives that will do
in seconds jobs that formerly required days of
tedious toil.

Yet relatively few people know or appreciate the
vital labor-saving, back—stage role which abrasives
play in the production of practically all mechani-
cally ﬁnished articles.

MAN-MADE MINERALS . . .

Through the centuries man’s ceaseless search for
better abrasives has paralleled progress in produc-
tion. Wheel-shaped sandstones replaced rocks . . .
only to give way to emery and corundum, which
were sieved, sized, glued to paper and cloth or
bonded in pottery mixtures to form artiﬁcial grind-
ing wheels.

But it was by the discovery of silicon carbide and
crystalline fused alumina—man-made minerals from
the electric furnace—that the grinding wheel be-
came a high speed, precision production tool.

AMERICA WORKS LIKE THAT . . .

trainee indoctrination and on-the-job study program.

Men hired as Alcoa salesmen are not hired for a
specific job in a specific location. They become mem-
bers of a sales trainee group which spends six months
in a program of orientation and study. During this
time the trainees are acquainted with Alcoa products
and methods of manufacture. After a preliminary
period of orientation in metallurgy at the Pittsburgh
home office, men spend a period of months at nine
Alcoa plants where they see all the company’s basic
processes. A final period of sales technique training at
the home office precedes assignment to a sales office,
where their training is completed.

Men recruited for engineering and technical po-
sitions at Alcoa’s plants are selected for specific job
opportunities. They become members of the plant
staff immediately upon joining the company. After a
preliminary orientation covering the plant and over-
all Alcoa operations, an engineer is assigned directly
to his job, where he is under the supervision and guid-
ance of an experienced member of his department.

The young graduate, particularly in engineering,
can get ahead in Alcoa. Alcoa wants young graduates
to learn the aluminum “business” and develop to ex-
ecutive positions. It has always been Alcoa’s policy to
find personnel to fill opportunities for higher positions
from _within the organization.

Much of the philosophy that makes outstanding
opportunities for the engineering graduate at Alcoa
was summed up in a speech given last year by its
president, I. W. Wilson. He closed his remarks by say-
my

“I can assure you that the executive branch of the
company in -Pittsburgh not only believes in the prop-
osition of constantly interchanging ideas, but practices
it every day in the year. And that is one of the reasons
that there has never been an “official” organization
chart of the company’s management. You can’t spend
your career inside a ‘block’ on an organization chart
unless you have already decided that you are where
you belong—permenently!

“As I have said earlier, I firmly believe that there
are great new prospects for aluminum, and for Alcoa,
in the years that lie ahead. It’s up to us to take full
advantage of these -opportunities, as a company and

as individuals——————.

Color Television

color is obtained by deflecting the electron beam near
the screen. It has only a single electron gun, and must
show its colors sequently to go with the line or dot se-
quential systems of the tube. This type of tube pre-
sents a flicker which is annoying. In this effect,
the colored lines appear to move in waves across the
tube screen. This is the Line sequential. In the dot
sequential, this effect is eliminated and a dot inter-
lace results which gives a better presentation of color.
The shadow mask tube, which has proven the better of
the two, uses three electron guns, one for each pri-
mary color which, when excited, cause their respective
phosphor dots on the face of the tube to glow in those
colors. The shadow mask tube was the first successful
all-electronic color-kinescope to be demonstrated. As
shown in Figure 5, this tube resembles a conventional

black and white kinescope except for its greater size
in lengh and tube face. The gun assembly consists of
three electron guns so situated that their beams hit the
center of the screen within an angle of 2 degrees of
each other. just behind the tube face is the shadow

“mask, a thin sheet of perforated metal or glass with
some 200,000 holes whose center to center spacing is
about 0.03 inches. In front of each are three phosphor
dots, one for each primary color. These dots are ar-
ranged in such a way that when a certain gun produces
a beam, only those dots associated with that gun are
excited into glowing. The other dots are screened by
the shadow of the mask. White light is produced when
all three guns are activating their respective dots
simultaneously. This type of tube acts as if it were
three separate tubes and three separate pictures. Of
the two types of kinescopes, the shadow mask tube
has proven the most effective.

Technical difficulties in developing these tubes
have held up their appearance in color television,
although modern technology will certainly speed their
production. Although we can only speculate on the
nature of future tubes now, it seems almost certain
that they will feature only one gun, be low in cost,
and present a really bright picture.

It is expected that color television sets will be in full
production by 1955, though color programs, especially
the larger ones, are still a few years off. Color tele-
vision, as presented to us today, shows a tremendous
change from monochrome sets, a revolution in them.
Thanks to The National Television Systems Commit-
tee, the new marvel of color television is in the Very
near future.

up the river of time to my grateful ears. But who is
that approaching with such gas-engine snorts and
cornﬁeld strides? Why looketh he so wild and why
paweth he the air so frantically with his hand and a
half? What do I hear him say? “Upon whose authority
do you blow a band upon the campus to—day?” (He
talks as though some one were smoking and blowing
rings.) I seem to hear him further say: “Rowdies, go
to town, gentlemen, go to classes; murder college
spirit.” Alas, that my day should be profaned by such
a poor misguided creature as he. Why should he want
the Faithful to murder College spirit by going to
classes?

“ ‘Methinks I see some other things that make the
angels weep. I see members of the Faithful canned for
lifting up their voices and blowing a band. By the for-
mer snakes of Ireland, it maketh me wild. But in the
sweet bye and bye shall they get their reward, for veri-
ly I say unto you, many cold bottles are laid up for

those who suffer for my sake. Much shall they eat and -

drink where faculties cometh not, neither do city ordi-
nances butt in and say a student may not buy, for in
the happy land prepared by me great cataracts of Bud
do flow without money and without price and whoso-
ever getteth in may dip it up in a can. Yea, verily, with
their cans shall my Faithful dip and drink while dis-
cipline committees gasp across the great gulf for just a
little foam to cool their blistered gaspers. But the faith-
ful shall say unto them “Nay, nay, Pauline & Co.; de-
part from me: go chase yourself: I know you not. You
may smoke but not drink for the deeds done in the
body.”

“ ‘A year has passed and my followers are still strong
in the faith though divers members of the faculty tell

them I am mythical as Santa Claus and differ from
him only in that I bringeth flunks, kerflops, much cus-
sing, and gnashing of teeth instead of peanuts. And
here must I pause to weep for those who went astray.
For verily some of my followers, even the tribe of
mechanics, though they were slaves to the Greene,
did murder college spirit by going to classes. Yea,
verily, their hearts became as those chickens.

“ ‘Although ingratitude tireth me like Doctor
Brown’s lectures and giveth me a pain like freshman
English, yet will I forgive them for their loyalty when
I again appear in the world. For, verily, I say unto
you, at the third great jamboree of the Faithful will I
be among them in the flesh. Yea, even I, the first engi-
neer, shall walk the earth once more and carry my
good instrument that made the profile of the Emerald
Isle. Down Ninth street shall I run my line and show
the editor of the catalogue how to build a walk there-
upon for the lack of which I see the Faithful are sorely
vexed. I shall also demonstrate that matter is indes-
tructible and that there is, therefore, a better way of
getting rid of undesirable dirt than by trying to wear it
out by moving it from place to place and back again.
I must run the snakes out of the buck-bushes around
the campus and last, but not least, I must bless the
Faithful. Yea, verily, shall I stand upon the steps of my
temple and they will bow before me and then shall I

stretch forth my hands and bless them muchly and
vanish from their sight. But each year shall I return
again upon the day set apart for me and admonish
each of the faithful to remember that day to keep it
holy if he would dip his can in the river of Bud and
drink with me under the Bushes. I have spoken.’ ”

WHILE taking the course, two engi-

circuit breaker mechanism.

“Our experience shows what can happen
if you work with people open to sugges-
tion. We found men of this kind at Alhs-
Chalmers, and it has given us a special
pleasure in our job.

“We started out like most other graduates
with a hazy idea of what we wanted to do.
After working in several departments, we
requested that part of our training be at
the Boston Works of Allis-Chalmers,
where circuit breakers are made.”

New Design Principle

“Circuit breakers soon became an obses-
sion with us, and we got the idea of de-
signinga hydraulic operator and trigger-
ing mechanism for these breakers. Most
operators for big breakers are pneumatic.

“Unsuccessful attempts had been made
in the past by all circuit breaker manu-
facturers to build hydraulic operators.

of the largest ever built in the United

The important thing is that no one at
Allis-Chalmers said, ‘Don'ttryit—it won’t
work.’ ”

Start New Era

“To make a long story short, our study of
the problem led us to the hydraulic accu-
mulator and high speed valves being used
by the aircraft industry. These had not
been available when earlier attempts were
made to build a hydraulic operator. With
these highly developed devices to work
with, we were able to build an operator

  
 
  

that combined the best features of pneu-
matic and hydraulic operation. We call it
the Pneu—drauIic operator. Engineers are
saying it starts a new era in circuit breaker
actuation.

out, there’s opportunity right from the

One evening last week, a poor

final breaths in this world; the
pangs of hunger were too strong
for his undernourished body. As
he was closing his eyes for the last
time, he spied a cafe worker put-

little bird could barely stretch his
wings but he did. He glided down
to the garbage can and landed. A
piece of bologna had fallen out of
the can and the bird began to eat.
He ate and ate until he was full,
then, satisfied and happy, he began
to sing. At this moment a cat heard
the singing and sneaked up, pounc-
en on the bird and ate him up.

All engineering careers at Boeing
have one thing in common: they pro-
vide plenty of opportunity to get ahead.
Regular merit reviews are held. Ad-
vancement is keyed to your individual
ability, application and initiative.

The aviation industry offers you a
unique opportunity to gain experience
with new techniques and new materials.
It oﬂers a wide range of application,
from applied research, to product de-
sign and production, all going on at
the same time.

What’s more, you can expect long-
term career stability in the aviation in-
dustry. Boeing, for instance, is now
in its 37th year of operation, and actu-
ally employs more engineers today than

even at the peak of World War II.
Besides designing and building the
world’s most advanced multi-jet air-
craft (the B-47 and B-52), Boeing con-
ducts one of the nation’s major guided
missile programs, and such other proj-
ects as research on supersonic ﬂight,
and nuclear power for aircraft.

PHOTOGRAPHY AT WORK- No. 8 in a Kodak Series

  Photography
shows prospects

how their new service stations are
going to look and operate

Alemite sets up scale models of their
service station equipment on the customer’s own floor plan——photographs them-
and portrays the new custom-built station ready for action

SALESMEN don’t just pull lube racks, grease pumps
and other service station equipment out of a sam-
ple case. They’re far too big—far too bulky. Besides,
ﬁnal location and arrangement count heavily in how
well they are going to work out.

The Alemite Division of Stewart-VVarner solves the
problem with photography. Prospects see new service
station equipmentvirtuallyright in their own premises.

ll works this way. The salesman sends in a rough
sketch of the space available, with windows and
columns marked. Experts ﬁt exact replicas of racks,
lifts, and other equipment to the plan, then put the
camera to work. The customer pictures his new sta-
tion—modern, eﬂicient, handsome—and the sale is
well on its way. It’s an idea for any company with

bulky products to sell. Photography is a great sales-
man for any business, large or small. And it’s very
much more. It works in all kinds of ways to save time,
cut costs, reduce error and improve production.

Graduates in the physical sciences and in engi-
neering ﬁnd photography an increasingly valuable
tool in their new occupations. Its expanding use
has also created many challenging opportunities at
Kodak, especially in the development of large-scale
chemical processes and the design of complex pre-
cision mechanical-electronic equipment. VVhether
you are a recent graduate or a qualiﬁed returning

ties, write to Business & Technical Personnel Dept.,

At Hughes the answers to these requirements for complexly interacting systems
involving advanced radar and fire control have been under continuing development
from 1948 and in production since I 949. Even more advanced systems are cur-
rently in process of development for supersonic aircraft.

Beginning with systems engineering and analysis, the military studies are initially
concerned with evaluation of the strategic and tactical needs of the services in order
to establish design objectives. This is followed by the analysis of problems involving
noise, smoothing and prediction, mu1ti—loop nonlinear servos, aircraft dynamics
and controls, and the properties peculiar to conversion of analog information
to digital quantities. From the analytic stage evolve the requirements for systems
design and circuitry, designs of computing sub—systems, microwave transmitting
and receiving equipment, the presentation of information to an airplane pilot, and
advanced testing needed to optimize over—all system performance.

The Torrington Needle Bearing
is designed for high radial loads

The many lineal inches of contact
provided by the larger number of
small diameter rollers‘ give the
Torrington Needle Bearing an
unusually high load rating. In
fact, a Needle Bearing has greater
radial capacity in relation to its
outside diameter than any other

type of anti-friction bearing.

Precision Manufacture
and Unique Design

The exceptional load capacity of
the Needle Bearing is the result
of proper selection of steels, pre-
cision workmanship to close tol-
erances, and the application of
modern anti-friction principles.

The one-piece shell, which
serves as the outer raceway and
retains the rollers, is accurately
drawn from carefully selected
strip steel. After forming, it is
carburized and hardened. There

is no further grinding or other
