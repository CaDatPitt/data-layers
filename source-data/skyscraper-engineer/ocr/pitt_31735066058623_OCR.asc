A Vital Pittsburgh Industry

Beer, not steel, may be this city’s foremost
product for many Pitt engineers.

lnfroducﬁon

One distinctive feature about Pittsburgh is its breweries.
Since at least 1818, beer has continuously been brewed here.
The first true lager in the United States was made here in
Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Brewing Company, at one time,
was the third largest brewing organization in the United
States. Even during Prohibition our breweries did not close.
Instead, they turned to manufacturing other food products,
such as ice cream and soft drinks, until the ban on alcoholic
beverages was alleviated. Since the end of Prohibition, Pitts-
burgh’s breweries have undertaken continual expansion and
modernization programs.

General Process

Each brewery has its own special brewing process which,
they claim, makes the best—tasting beer. The basic process
common to most breweries, however, can be described.
Most breweries in the U.S. produce lager beer. The yeast

that ferments this type of beer remains in the brew or sinks
to the bottom of the tank during fermentation rather than
rising to the top. (In the fermentation of ales, the yeast
rises to the top of the solution.) To begin, we will discuss
the generalized process.

Beer is a fermented sugar solution made from a rather
small number of constituents. To get a sugar solution,
brewers begin with a starch solution and, by enzymatic
reactions, they change -these starches to fermentable sugars.
Yeast, then, changes the sugars in the brew to alcohol and
carbon dioxide. Very generally, this is what takes place in
a brewery. From here we can see just how each ingredient
carries out these steps.

lngredienfs

Each constituent has a function to perform in the brew-
ing. The medium in which the process takes place is, of
course, water. It is ﬁrst purified to remove any foreign

chemicals, odors, or tastes given it by the supplier. Malt
(barley grains) serves more than one purpose. The malt
supplies part of the starch. It also yields enzymes which
change these starches to sugars and break up protein mole-
cules. Malt gives color and ﬂavor to the beer itself. Corn,
or possibly rice, provides the most inexpensive source of
starch; it adds nothing to the ﬂavor or color. The corn
arrives at the brewery crushed and germ-free. (The corn
supplier removes the germ or corn oil. This process is
advantageous to both brewer and corn supplier. The
brewery is interested only in the starch from the corn, not
the germ, while the corn supplier can make use of the germ
for oil.) Hops serve a purpose in brewing that is analogous
to tea steeping. The hop is a vine plant; the ripe female
ﬂowers of these plants go into the brew as it boils, and are
removed shortly after. The hops give ﬂavor, aroma, and
bitterness to the beer. The yeast changes the sugar in the
solution to alcohol.

What Happens At A Brewery?

As we have pointed out, each brewery has a different
brewing process from start to ﬁnish. In this article, we
will concern ourselves with a typical process. The grains,
malt and corn, arrive at the brewery in hopper cars. A
powerful airveyor (vacuum) system draws the grain from
the railroad cars at ground level to the top of storage bins
as much as ﬁve stories high. These bins have conical bot-
toms and hold approximately 500,000 pounds of grain. Grain
for use is always drawn out from the bottom of the bin so
as to use the oldest grain ﬁrst. Airveyors then take the
grain from the bins‘ to hoppers to be weighed and dis-
patched to a mill for pulverizing.

A grain mill is specially constructed to crush the grain in
three steps. It contains three pairs of rollers which crush
the grain to powder, but do not crush the hulls. In travel-
ing between the ﬁrst pair of rollers, the hull is broken and
the kernel is slightly crushed. In passing between the second
set of rollers, the kernel is further crushed. Finally, the
third set of rollers pulverizes the fragments of kernel to
powder. Before the powdered grain goes into the mash
tub, it is again weighed. This ﬁnal weighing assures the
brewmaster that the proper amount of malt goes into his
mixture.

Once pulverized, the malt goes to the mash tub and the
brewing begins. Hot water at a controlled pH ﬂows into
the mash tub, and the solution of water and malt is brought
to a boil by steam heat. Enzymes change the proteins to
starch, and boiling helps the enzymes to break the starch
cells. Meanwhile, in a separate tub called an adjunct cooker,
a mixture of corn, malt, and water is boiled. Boiling in the
adjunct cooker plus enzymatic action liquiﬁes the corn
starch. The liquid corn starch in the adjunct cooker ﬂows
into the mash tub, and the single mixture continues to boil.
Continued enzymatic action and further boiling will change
the starches to fermentable sugars. The solution ends up
as a sweet liquid (really a sugar solution) called wort.

Though the powdered malt and corn have yielded the
sugar solution (wort), the ﬂuid in the mash tub still con-
tains the grain husks. Separation of the wort from the husks
takes place in a lauter tub. From the mash tub, the solu-

tion goes to the lauter tub. Here, hot water sprays in, and
slowly-moving rakes cause the hulls to sink to the bottom
of the tub leaving the wort on top. The settled hulls form
a strainer, which ﬁlters the wort as it is drawn off through
the perforated bottom of the lauter tub. Once dried, grain
husks make excellent fodder. Selling this fodder provides
a secondary source of income to the brewery. The clear-
liquid wort now ﬂows to the brew kettle for about two and
one half hours of boiling.

Four important processes take place in the brew kettle.
Here, boiling the wort sterilizes it, concentrates it slightly,
and causes the extra protein to coagulate for removal. The
fourth process occurs when the added hops ﬂavor the wort
and help to preserve it from spoiling. Though the length
of boiling time is about two and one half hours, the exact
time varies according to the brewmaster. Each brewmaster’s
recipe involves an exact time. Each brewmast'er feels that
his particular amount of boiling time makes the best beer.

Boiling Time

Boiling time controls the degree to which sterilization,
concentration, coagulation, and ﬂavoring can occur. Sterili-
zation kills any bacteria that may be present in the wort.

some of the tanks in which the beer is fermented.

Later, when the yeast begins its job of fermentation, it must
be able to grow freely without any competition from other
bacteria. The bacteria, though harmless to humans, could
possibly interfere with the action of the yeast if allowed to
remain in the wort. Concentration due to the evaporating
water makes a sweeter wort i.e., wort with a higher per-
centage of sugar. Protein coagulation and, hence, elimina-
tion, must occur in exacting amounts. Boiling the wort too
long will cause too much protein to gel and, as a result,
the beer will not foam. Boiling for too short a time -will
not remove enough protein and the ﬁnished beer vvill be
cloudly instead of sparkling. After approximately two
hours, hops are added to the boiling wort. They remain in
the brew for thirty minutes adding ﬂavor, aroma, bitterness‘,
and preservatives to it.

After boiling for the speciﬁed length of time, the wort
flows from the brew kettle through a hop strainer which
removes the used hops. Spent hops serve no purpose and
are disposed. Still hot, the wort pours into a settling tank.
As the liquid runs into the tank, it picks up air. Aeriﬁcation
introduces oxygen and nitrogen to the liquid. These gases
stimulate fermentation, for they are employed by the yeast
during its growth. In the tank any insoluble material, called
trub, that may still be in the beer up to this time settles

out and is removed.

Before yeast can change the wort to beer, the brew re-
quires cooling to a temperature of 50°F, the ideal tem-
perature for yeast growth. A cooling unit employs activated
water as the initial coolant and ammonia as the secondary
coolant. In the process of cooling, the activated water itself
becomes heated. This warmed water is then used in the
next brew, thereby reducing heating expenses. Water alone
cannot cool the liquid to the desired temperature. An am-
monia cooler is then used to bring the- liquid temperature
down to 50°F.

Fermentation

Yeast is added to the wort (about one pound per barrel)
as it passes from the coolers to wooden fermenting tanks.
Fermentation takes sixteen to eighteen hours to begin. In
the tanks preceding fermentation, the cool temperature
causes another coagulation of protein. Some resins congeal
at this time also. Once fermentation begins, the liquid is
transferred to glass-lined or stainless steel fermenting tanks.
Fermentation time in these tanks depends on the type of
beer to be made — pilsner or lager takes ten to twelve days,
malt liquor takes a while longer, and 3-2 beer takes a
shorter time. These time spans are only general, since the
brewmaster controls the exact length of time for fermenta-
tion according to what he feels makes the tastiest beer. As
the yeast grows and feeds on the sugars, the sugars con-
tinuously give olf heat and carbon dioxide. The fermenting
tanks must be refrigerated to maintain the optimum tem-
perature which, again, is controlled by the brewmaster. The
beer’s ﬂavor now depends entirely upon temperature. Thus,
control of temperature at this stage is very important. When
fermentation ends and most of the yeast has sunk to the
bottom of the tank, the carbon dioxide can be drawn off as
a by—product. The beer, as it is now called, is drawn off
and pumped to primary storage tanks to age for several
weeks. The fermenting tank now contains about four times
as much yeast as was put into the wort. During fermenta-
tion the yeast quadrupled in amount. It can be used again,
sold, or discarded.

Filtering

After weeks of aging, the beer becomes, mature. How-
ever, it is still cloudly due to yeast in suspension and must
be ﬁltered before bottling. The beer goes through three
ﬁlters. The ﬁrst ﬁlter contains coarse diatomaceous earth
on vertical screens. The second ﬁlter contains ﬁne diato-
maceous earth on horizontal screens. The third ﬁlter is a
pulp ﬁlter containing cotton ﬁbers. Filtration is the ﬁnal
step before bottling. As the ﬁnished beer travels to the
bottling house, it passes through a government meter which
measures and records the amount of beer for tax purposes.

Conclusion

Last year over 113 million barrels of beer were consumed
in this country. (Consider that one barrel contains enough
beer to ﬁll about 340 bottles.) .

We have shown how beer is brewed. Actually, the pro-
cess is somewhat more complicated and involves careful con-
trol of ingredients, boiling time, fermentation, temperatures,
etc. These factors are different for each brewmaster’s recipe,
and we could touch only on the basic steps in the brewing
process.

Saline Water Conversion

A description of various processes used to

convert brackish or sea water to fresh water.

by William H. Kredel

Absfracl

The most abundant of all the earth’s many resources is
water, covering more than two—thirds of the earth’s surface.
Yet, due to our ever increasing population, water is becoming
one of the world’s biggest shortages. The fact that over 97%
of our water supply is salty or brackish makes it useless for
human consumption.

Sea water contains about 3.5% salt; man can tolerate only
2%. Should a person drink sea water, the salt burden is
more than human kidneys can secrete, and the body becomes
dehydrated in its efforts to rid itself of the excess. The
purest water is best, although pure water is tasteless, and
most people prefer to drink water with a slight mineral
content.

Brackish water has a salt concentration within body toler-
ance but it contains minerals such as sodium sulfate or
magnesium sulfate which cause intestinal disturbances.

Conversion of sea water and brackish ground water to
fresh water will make it possible for already densely popu-
lated areas to continue to grow and expand. It may also
make it possible to populate the arid lands that account for
60% of the earth’s land surface.

lnfroduclion

Desalination refers to a process by which the salt con-
tent of brackish water or sea water is reduced sufficiently for
human or industrial use. In general, water is desalinated in
one of two ways. Either fresh water is extracted from a
salty solution, or else salts are removed from water in a solid
or liquid state.

Salt can be separated only from a saturated solution of
sea water having a concentration about ten times that of
the original before salt starts to crystallize. This is expensive
and substantially all of_the salt would have to be separated
from all of the water. 011 the contrary, in separating fresh
water from sea water, only a small amount of fresh water
need be separated from a very much larger amount of sea
water. The water may be removed as a vapor, as a solid,
or as a liquid; and processes have been developed for each

Evaporation or distillation separates vapors which must
be condensed to liquid in order to be used. Pure ice separates
when water freezes. Most of the ice is pure except for a
thin ﬁlm of brine on the surface which must be washed off.
The ice crystals are removed and melted for use as water.

‘I6

Water in the liquid phase may be extracted from sea
water by a liquid solvent. It is then separated from the
solvent which is reused. Liquid water may also be separated
directly from the salt by a ﬁltration mechanism (membranes)
which allows desalted water to pass through, while retaining
on the filter the ionic complexes of salt (which are larger
than water molecules). This requires extremely high pres-
sures and extremely fine pores.

With this background, the various methods of desalina-
tion which have been used on a large scale will now be
discussed.

Evaporaﬁon or Dislillal-ion

Conventional evaporators are usually of the multiple-
effect, vapor-compression, or multiple—ﬂash types. These

evaporators have metal surfaces through which heat is trans-
ferred either to boiling liquids from condensing vapors or
between liquid and vapor. The metal surfaces are usually
tubes separating the hot and cold fluids-. These tubes may
be submerged in the boiling liquid, or the liquid may flow
with a forced circulation through the tubes, or only a film
of boiling liquid may be in contact with the tube surface.

In the multiple—effect distillation process, the sea water
passes through bundles of tubes in a series of evaporators
under progressively reduced pressure. If the liquid in one
evaporator boils at a suﬂiciently high temperature and pres-
sure, and if no water is circulated to the vessel enclosing the
condenser coil, the condensation of vapor heats the water
around the coil until it boils. If the vapor from this second
boiling or evaporating is passed to another similar condenser,
a two—effect evaporation sequence is completed.‘ In desalina-
tion of sea water, a maximum of twelve effects is considered
the optimum number that can be used economically. This is
based on thermal elﬁciency, which increases with the number
of effects compared to the cost of heat and the cost of
equipment.

A pilot plant in Freeport, Texas, built under the auspices
of the Oﬂice of Saline Water, Department of the Interior,
desalts water by the multiple effect distillation process.

The vapors from evaporating sea water, instead of being
condensed immediately, can be increased in pressure and
temperature by a compressor. The compressed vapor may
then pass to the steam side of the tubes, causing the evapora-
tion. The vapor condenses, because of its higher temperature,
to give fresh water. The heat transfer rate is increased by
circulating the sea water through the evaporation tubes at a
high velocity. I

Production of fresh water by vapor compression requires
no thermal energy, since the evaporation is done entirely by
the heat in the vapor boiled from the salt water, and con-
densation is done entirely by compression to a high tempera-
ture and pressure. The discharge of hot fresh water and hot
brine is equal to the salt water feed, and is used to preheat
the sea water feed to the system. I

This method of distilling is called vapor compression with
forced circulation, and is used to desalt water on a large
scale at the Rosewell, New Mexico desalination plant.

' . PRODUCT WATER

The mulﬁsfoge flash disfillofion process.

Flash Evaporation

Flash evaporation consists of spraying hot water under
pressure into a chamber that is at a lower temperature and
pressure. A portion of the water ﬂashes, almost instantane-
ously into vapor, passes through mesh separators, and then
condenses into pure water. Flashing occurs because of the
difference in heat storage ability of water under different
pressures. When the high-pressure water is sprayed into the
lower-pressure chamber, the excess heat is released in the
form of steam or vapor.

A single-stage evaporator consists of a heat-input section,
a heat—recovery section, and a heat—rejection section. The
heat-recovery and heat—rejection sections are usually com-
bined into a single unit. The heat-input section, or brine
heater, consists of a shell—and—tube heat exchanger. The most
common heat source is steam from a boiler or turbine cycle,

but other sources include exhaust gas from a gas turbine or
stack gases from a boiler.

The heated brine is forced to the ﬂash chamber through
an oriﬁce where it is partially ﬂashed and becomes a mixture
of vapor and liquid. The amount of vapor produced from
one pound of brine depends on the temperature drop of the
brine across the oriﬁce. About one percent of brine flashes
to vapor for each ten—degree Fahrenheit drop in tempera-
ture within the range 100 to 200°F.

The vapor passes through the moisture separator, con-
structed in the form of wire-mesh grids, which removes
liquid droplets that the vapor carries along. The vapor then
passes over tubes which condense it to pure distillate. This
condensation of vapor on tubes at lower temperature main-
tains the necessary pressure drop in the ﬂash chamber and
recovery section. The unﬂashed brine is recirculated through
the heat recovery section to the brine heater. The desired
brine concentration is maintained by adding makeup sea
water from the heat-rejection cooling water.

Since the ﬂash evaporator does essentially no work, the
heat—rejection section receives practically all of the energy
supplied to the heat-input section. The heat is rejected to a
heat sink, such as the ocean, rivers, or cooling towers. The
temperature of the rejecting-section coolant (heat sink) estab-
lishes the minimum ﬂashing pressure.

In the usual single-stage ﬂash evaporator, one pound of
heating steam produces about one pound of distillate. This
is not good energy economy, but it can be improved by using
the latent heat in the vapor to re-heat the circulating brine,
rather than rejecting it immediately to the heat sink. This is
accomplished in the heat—recovery section, which is divided
into a number of stages, with each stage maintained at a
lower pressure and temperature than the preceding stage.
Brine flows from stage to stage, giving up additional vapor
to the pressure drops; vapor condensed in each recovery
stage returns heat to the recirculating brine ﬂowing in the
heat-recovery tubes back to the brine heater. The latent
heat of vapor formed in the heat—rejection section is sent out
to the heat sink.

The heat performance of the flash evaporator cycle is de-
termined by the eﬂectiveness of the physical design in
conserving heat. The thermal performance of a multi-
stage ﬂash evaporator is determined by the number of
stages, the length of stages, the velosity inside the tubes,
and the material of the tubes.

The multistage flash evaporator method is the most popu-
lar method for desalination because of the economics in-
volved. It is estimated that with increased technological
developments, multistage ﬂash evaporation will become com-
petitive with conventional means of purifying water by 1980.
A largeﬂash evaporation plant is located at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba.

Freezing Process

sea water in the freezing process of desalination. The

temperature of freezing is almost independent of pressure;
it is ﬁxed instead by the salt concentration and varies from
0°C to about —4°C depending on the salt concentration. The
greater the concentration, the lower the freezing point.

The two methods of refrigeration used to desalinate sea
water are (1) absorption of vapors into a solution from
which they are later evaporated or regenerated by the use of
heat energy, and (2) mechanical compression of vapor.
Both use water or other refrigerants in either a direct or
indirect heat transfer relation.

Sea water may be evaporated at its freezing point, at a
low pressure of about one—two hundredths of an atmosphere.
The water is absorbed or condensed in a concentrated solu-
tion of material like lithium bromide, which considerably
depresses the equilibrium vapor pressure. This solution is
evaporated for concentration and then cooled for reuse. The
ice crystals are separated from the brine, washed to remove
the surface ﬁlm of brine, and then melted to obtain fresh
water.

Water is not very suitable as the refrigerant for mechanical
compression systems because of its very low vapor pressure
and large vapor volume at the freezing point. Another liquid
which has a higher pressure and lower freezing point is

therefore desirable. Ammonia is often used in an indirect
heat exchange relation; ice is then scraped from the metal
freezing surface and melted.

Another system uses butane as a refrigerant in direct con-
tact with, and insoluble in, sea water. A transfer of the
latent heat occurs simultaneously with the freezing of the
ice to supply the latent heat of vaporization of the butane.

Desalination by freezing is used in a plant at Wrights-
ville Beach, North Carolina, with ammonia as a refrigerant.

Eledrodialysis

Electrodialysis is the only commercially used desalting
method among those that remove salt from the water, in-
stead of removing the much larger amount of water from
the salt. It is called electrodialysis, since an electric current
is used in the dialysis of the ions through the membranes,
permeable to either positive or negative ions.

Membranes of synthetic resins have been developed which
are highly selective to the passage of positive ions;
other membranes have been developed which are highly
selective to the passage of negative ions. Hundreds of such
membranes form a stack which is alternately selective to
the positive and negative ions. One type of membrane
bounds a narrow compartment on one side, while the other

type of membrane bounds the compartment on the other side.
Salt water passes through all the compartments, while direct
current passes through the system.

The salt water is ionized, and positively—charged ions
(sodium) tend to migrate through the membranes permeable
to positive ions in the direction of current flow. The nega-
tively—charged ions (chloride) tend to migrate through the
membrane permeable to negative ions in the reverse direc-
tion to the current How. One compartment will tend to
lose sodium ions through the bounding membrane on one
side, and also to lose chloride ions on the other side through
its bounding membrane. The intermediate chambers each
tend to acquire both ions from the respective bounding
membranes. Thus, streams through alternate compartments
will become more desalinated, while intermediate compart-
ments become more concentrated in salts.

This process depends on the distance the liquid flows in
the compartments, the intensity of the current flow, and the
permeability of the membranes. Also, because sediments
and other impurities in the water can damage the membrane
surfaces and reduce capacity, pre—treatment of the water is
usually necessary to remove the undesirable materials.

Reverse Osmosis

A new process being developed for desalination is re-
verse osmosis. This process also employs membranes, and
reverses nature’s osmotic pressure that normally causes
liquids to How through a semipermeable membrane.

When saline water and fresh water are separated by a
semipermeable membrane, osmosis will create a flow of
fresh water through the membrane with the salt water.
If the saline water, however, is subjected to a pressure
greater than the natural osmotic pressure, the process is
reversed. Water in the brine is forced through the mem-
brane to the fresh water side, leaving the concentrated salt

behind.

The reverse osmotic process in inherently simple, and
requires little energy. This process may reduce signiﬁcantly
the cost of converting saline water. Practical application of
the process depends largely on development of suitable
membranes.

Energy and Cost Consideration

All processes for making drinking water from saline
water consume energy. The energy used to separate de-
salinated water may be electrical, mechanical, or, most often,
thermal. Regardless of what form of energy is used in a
particular system, a certain minimum amount is needed to

separate salt and water. When the salts in sea water go into
solution, a Fixed amount of heat is released. The process
designed to separate the salt from the water must restore
the heat produced when the salt dissolves.

Fossil fuels usually supply the energy. Electrical power
plants have often been coupled with desalination plants,
which then use the steam from turbines supplying
the desired power. When inexpensive nuclear power be-
comes available, fresh water may be made comparatively
cheaply. The supply of energy may be regarded as a funda-
mental problem by itself! The desalination plant, like any
other manufacturing plant, consumes energy hopefully to
the maximum elﬁciency and the minimum amount per unit
of product. The choice of heat energy must therefore be
based on economic considerations.

Currently the most promising process for large—scale
production of fresh water is distillation. Distillation sys-
tems require quantities of low temperature steam. One of
the places that steam of this temperature can be found is
in the turbines of thermoelectric power plants. These plants
produce high temperature steam to turn the turbogenera-
tors that generate electrical power. As the steam passes
through the turbine, its temperature decreases until a point
is reached where it is low enough so that it might be used
for saline water distillation. Thus, the steam used to gen-

erate electricity could also be used to provide energy to the
water plant.

This steam is usually provided by heat from fossil fuels,
but for large plants it is believed that nuclear fuel sources
will offer a lower total cost in the long run.

Separating processes, such as electrodialysis, depend on
the removal of the salt as positive and negative ions, and
cost is a function of the amount of salt to be removed.
These processes are economical for brackish water, but not
for removing the high salinity of sea water.

Conclusion

The future growth and development of the nations of
the world are highly dependent upon their supply of fresh
water. While the supply of fresh water remains constant,
an increasing population is causing shortages in some water.-
deﬁcient areas. Better utilization of fresh water by decreas-
ing wastes or imposing rations offers a limited solution.
However, the problem of supply and demand still remains.

Water desalination, when economically and technically
feasible, offers a better solution, by increasing the amount
of fresh water available. The desalting processes described
in this article are only a beginning in an ever—expanding
ﬁeld. The technological developments which will desalt
water in the future probably have not even been thought
of yet, leaving this challenging ﬁeld wide open for the
creative young engineer.

Clavichords for Fun and Profit

A Pitt student writes about an unusual

but interesting summer hobby.

by Rolland Rogers

lnfroducfion

During the summer, I began a project unlike any other
I have ever ventured. I built a clavichord.

A clavichord is a late 14th Century musical instrument,
rectangular in shape with a keyboard and metal strings.
By design, it is perhaps the simplest of all keyboard instru-
ments. It consists primarily of an outer case, an inner case
for string support, and a sound board to amplify its soft
tone.

The Clavichord

The outer case is traditionally a rectangular wooden box
3’ — 6’ long, 1’ — 2’ wide, and 4” — 8” deep. Occasionally
there have been clavichords with hexagonal or trapezoidal
shapes, but these are indeed rare. The clavichords of antiq—
uity frequently bore intricate carvings, metal inlays, and
paintings. Also, the keyboard was often topped with ivory,
shell, or fruitwoods.

From a position facing the keyboard, the clavichord ap-
pears as two sections. The area of the keyboard and a nar-
row tool compartment at the left occupy two—thirds of the
length, and the remaining one—third area to the right of the
keyboard is the location of the sound board and wrest pins
(tuning pins.) Near the middle of the sound board is an
S shaped bridge with pins to prevent string slippage; and
nearby, a small brass ﬁligree rises for decoration.

Lying along the back wall of the case, immediately be-
hind the keyboard, is the hitch—pin rail. Metal strings, each
ﬁrmly attached to a hitch pin, run diagonally from the walls
of the case, passing above the small brass tangents in the
ends of the keys,‘and over the crown of the bridge. From
the bridge, the strings bend slightly toward the wrest pins,
and wind downward around them.

When a key is depressed, the small brass tangent, at-
tached to the end of the key lever, rises vertically to strike
and hold a string. The‘ length of string between the tangent

and bridge is set vibrating, producing the characteristically
“bright” sound of a clavichord.

Hisfory

The forerunner of the clavichord was the monochord, a
Greek invention of the Sixth Century B.C. This instrument
consisted of a single string, stretched over a rectangular
sound board, and held in place by weights, or wooden pegs.
Sound was produced by plucking, and a movable bridge
enabled the player to vary the length of the vibrating string.

The monochord was of great importance to the Greeks,
who used it to study the relationships between pitch and

string length. In the Second Century B.C. three more
strings were added in order to study the simultaneous
sounding of two or more notes. The resulting instrument
was termed a helikon, or simply, polychord.

Except for an additional string or two, the monochord
existed virtually unchanged until the Twelfth Century
A.D., when for the ﬁrst time, ﬁxed bridges were placed
under various lengths of the string. A keyboard was added
a century or two later, and the resulting combination was
known as a fretted clavichord.

Because these instruments had only one string, it was
impossible to play more than one note at a time. To over-
come this problem, several more strings were added, en-
abling thirds, ﬁfths, or octaves to be played; but notes lying
closer together were still unplayable.

Finally in Italy, at the end of the 14th Century, the un-
fretted “true” clavichord appeared; each key had its own
string. The keyboards of these early instruments were
small (two to three octaves), but by the 18th Century, the
clavichord had been expanded to six full octaves.

To increase the small tone of the clavichord, “idle”
strings were often added. These strings were not struck,
but merely tuned to vibrate sympathetically. There were
also “double" strung clavichords, whose tangents struck two
strings simultaneously; and elaborate resonating sound
boxes were often constructed to amplify the sound. Despite
these efforts, the clavichord remained essentially a solo in-
strument.

With the invention of the harpsichord in 1521, the de-
cline of the clavichord was imminent. Because of its small
voice, the clavichord, often termed the most “sensitive and
soulful” of all keyboard instruments, could not compete
favorably for the concert hall.

The year 1651 saw the invention of the piano, whose
flexibility and dynamics would permanently replace both
the harpsichord and the clavichord, marking the end of an
era.

By popular consensus, there is often confusion regarding
the differences between the clavichord and harpsichord.
But indeed, similarity between them goes little further than
rhyme.

A harpsichord has a triangular shape, something like
the modern grand piano, and is much larger than the rec-
tangular clavichord. Both instruments use metal strings and
have keyboards of comparable size‘. The main difference
between them is the method of sound production. In the
clavichord, it is metal tangents that strike the string, where-
as the harpsichord relies upon leather or quill plectra to
pluck the strings.

The plucking mechanism of the harpsichord consists of
thin, six—inch long strips of wood called “jacks”, which
stand vertically at the distal ends of the key levers. Wooden
“tongues” with plectra extending perpendicularly are ac-
commodated by notches in the ends of the jacks.

When a key is depressed, ‘the jack with the tongue rises
vertically and the plectrum plucks the string as it passes.
On the return trip, after the key is released, the jack and

26

tongue descend. As the plectrum repasses the string, the
tongue pivots from its notch in the jack and the plectrum

slides quietly by.

Various stops have been built into the harpsichord en-
abling one to play either loud or soft. But because the strings
are plucked, no variation of volume by touch is possible.
The demands of Baroque and early Classical music for
crescendos and subtle nuances were beyond the capabilities
of its rigid dynamics, and the harpsichord soon fell to the
more ﬂexible piano.

Consi-rucfion

I began building my clavichord in Iune, after much
hesitance at tackling such a project. Having had little pre-
vious wood-working experience, my construction began
quite slowly. Fortunately I had access to a well equipped
home work-shop, which made things considerably easier.

The clavichord I built is much like the traditional
clavichord; it is 4’ long, 16” wide, and 7” deep. I bought
the keyboard (4‘/2 octave), metal pins, wire, tangents, lami-
nated sound board, and maple pin block in kit form from
the Zuckermann Harpsichord Company, 161 Charles St.,
New York. A detailed construction manual and a full. scale
diagram of the clavichord were also included. My next step
was to buy the wood, and begin. I used maple for the outer
and inner cases, and cherry for the name board (behind the
keys) and for the tool compartment lid. I believe the sound
board is laminated spruce or cypress.

First, an inner case for string support had to be made.
It consisted of two sides, the back hitch pin rail, a sound

box liner and a plywood bottom reinforced with diagonal

and longitudinal braces. Next, the wrest pin block was
drilled and attached to the inner case. Then a trapezoidal
hole was cut into the plywood bottom below the sound box.
At this point, I bolted a frame made of 1” x 1A,” angle iron to
the bottom and sides of the inner case, with the hope that
the added strength would prevent distortion of the case by
the strings when they are tuned.

With the inner case complete, I proceeded to make the
bridge. This was perhaps the most difficult task. Because
the bridge is S shaped, portions of it were necessarily cross-
grain with the board it was to be cut from, and there was
constant danger of breaking it. Once it was cut free, I
marked and drilled the holes for the bridge pins. Next, to
assure “clean” string support, the top of the bridge had to
be beveled; a small spoke shave and a quarter—round wood
rasp suﬂiced for this task.

The sound board was then cut to size, the bridge posi-
tioned and fastened to it, and a small brass ﬁligree rose
inserted. The completed sound board with bridge was then
glued to the sound box liners.

Then there was the matter of weighing the keys, insert-
ing tangents, and leveling the keyboard. After an assort-
ment of detail, the inner case with pins and keyboard was
complete.

Mr. Zuckermann’s plans for the lid and outer case
showed very attractive clean-cut lines. However, if one has
access to power tools such as a band saw, a lathe, and a
router, there are inﬁnite possibilities for modiﬁcation. My
clavichord is patterned after the French Provincial style,
and will rest on a stand displaying the traditional curved
legs. The inside of my clavichord is natural ﬁnish, and the
outside is champagne white with the fluted edges of the lid;
the outer case is trimmed in gold.

Tuning

Attaching the strings will be the next thing I must do.
The clavichord, like the piano, uses metal wires of varying
gauges in order to obtain several octaves without resorting
to extremely long strings, or great tensions. It was learned
many years ago that the pitch of a vibrating string varies
directly with the square root of the tension, and inversely
with the density per unit length. Brass strings are used
in the bass for their round full voice, and in the treble, steel
strings because they are clearer, and withstand greater
tensions.

Modern clavichords and pianos are tuned to “even-
tempered” scales. This method permits the playing of all
major and minor chords. Were they tuned to perfect ﬁfths
and fourths, or “true” scales, it would be necessary to retune
the instrument each time one wished to play in a different

key.

Brieﬂy, the technique of even—tempered tuning is to ex-
pand the fourths, and contract the ﬁfths. In order to do this,
one must listen for “beats.” Beats are the waxing and wan-
ing of sound produced when two notes of similar frequency
are played simultaneously. The beat frequency, or rise and
fall of sound per second, is equal to the difference between
the frequencies of the two notes, and is the key to proper
tuning. d

When I have mastered this technique, my clavichord
will be ﬁnished.

Bridge Construction in Pittsburgh

ic ori n sis 0 cans rue ion cc ni ‘ties in our Ci’ is "rt ' es.
A talaaly t t thq ty’bdg

Bridge building is one of the most basic applications of
engineering. It is quite possible that the ﬁrst bridge was
merely a log across a stream, built because it was necessary
for man to pass from one point to another. Necessity is the
key word in any innovation. Pittsburgh certainly provided
the necessity for bridge builders. The landscape is rugged,
laced with ‘ravines. An added incentive for bridge builders
is the Y of rivers formed by the Monongahela, Allegheny
and Ohio. In the development of Pittsburgh as an indus-
trial center, bridges satisﬁed the need for transportation of
people and materials over nature’s obstacles.

The ﬁrst bridges to span the rivers of Pittsburgh were
constructed by individuals who reclaimed their investment
by charging tolls for their use. The ﬁrst free bridge was
built in 1896 by the city of Pittsburgh spanning the Monon-
gahela River between Brady and South Twenty—seconcl
Streets. By 1926 all the bridges of the Pittsburgh district
were made free.

The ﬁrst river bridge of Pittsburgh for highway traffic
was constructed, in 1818 across the Monongahela at Smithﬁeld
Street. It was a wooden structure which stood until de-
stroyed by ﬁre in 1845, but was immediately reconstructed.
The early bridge builders were plagued by ﬁre and flood,
but perseverance gave us the present bridge system of over
200 bridges in the city limits and more than 1500 in the area.

The materials used in these structures are predominantly
reinforced concrete and steel. The latter is a natural for the
Pittsburgh district. In 1864 Andrew Carnegie founded a
bridge-building enterprise called the Keystone Bridge Com-
pany. He used the company to feed his steel industry. I. P.
Morgan bought this company in 1900, and formed the
American Bridge Company in association with several other
similar companies. This later became a subsidiary of U. S.
Steel.

The steel industry, coupled with Pittsburgh’s geography,
natural resources and enterprising engineering, has given
Pittsburgh an eminent place in America’s bridge building
history.

As far as the technical aspect of bridge erection goes,
there are ﬁve types of ﬁxed structure bridges. They are:

without projecting beyond its supports,

(2) Continuous span: those reaching over more than
one opening,

(.3) Arch: :1 series of arched'ribs backed by solid or
open spandels until a level line is reached upon which
the ﬂoor is constructed,

(4) Cantilever: two projecting arms reaching toward
each other, the gap between their ends being bridged
by an independent structure or suspended span,

(5) Suspension: cables of parallel .wires passing over
high towers and anchored at each end. The platform
is suspended from these and stabilized.

If 

    

playj-it-safe thinker;
with a
step-at-a-time philosophy...

you're not geared for the pace of things at celanese.

No other major corporation in our industry has grown so
fast. In the last ten years, sales have zoomed from $286.4
million to over $1 billion.

But that’s just the beginning of the beginning.

We have a lot of serious growing to do. Right now. And
some substantial, ground-floor opportunities to offer you.
If you can help us grow.

We need competent, imaginative, flexible people—with
degrees in chemistry, chemical or mechanical engineer-
ing, physics, or industrial engineering. People who can be-
come a part of our continuing leadership in areas such. as
acetyl chemicals, vapor-phase and liquid-phase oxidation
processes, fiber technology. And many more.

Frankly, we expect a lot. But we offer even more.

Like rewards based on performance—not on how old you
are, or how long you’ve been with us. By the same token,
we do not subject you to long formal training programs.
We d_ohave a deep interest in helping you grow just as
fast as you can. And in giving you as much responsibility
as you can handle.

We believe that is the reason for our su,ccess——and as-
sured growth—in international markets for chemicals,
fibers, plastics, coatings, petroleum and forest products.

If a pace like this sounds good to you, discuss us
with your faculty and placement officer. And see our
representative when he is on campus. Or write to: John

Adminisirafion

The restructuring of the School of Engineering begun
last year was continued during the 1966-67 academic year to
provide further increases in the eflectiveiiess of the admin-
istrative organization. The chairman of each department is
a member of the School Executive Committee, under the
direction of Dean Hoelscher, An associate chairman ap-
pointed for each department is a member of the Undergrad-
uate Engineering Administrative Committee, chaired by
Associate Dean Turkes. Policy decisions for the guidance of
all operations within the School and all planning are the
responsibility of the Executive Committee. Operational pro-
cedures for all undergraduate programs throughout the
School are the responsibility of the Administrative Com-
mittee. A Standing Committee on Graduate Studies, report-
ing to the Dean and chaired by Dr. T. W. Sze (Depart-
ment of Electrical Engineering), provides guidance for all
graduate programs and is charged with the maintenance of
uniform standards and requirements in graduate programs
throughout the School.

An Oﬂice of Continuing Education Studies and Oﬂice of
International Programs was established in the School of
Engineering with Assistant Professor Minor C. Hawk
serving as Director of both activities. The Oﬂice of Con-
tinuing Education Studies’ primary objective is to provide
short courses, engineering seminars, special classes, and engi-

Harold E. Hoelscher

Dean of the School of Engineering, Dr. Harold E.
Hoelscher, was also recently named Director of Engineering
Research. In addition to his administrative and research
responsibilities, Dean Hoelscher serves as consultant to the
American Cyanamid Company, the Texaco Division of Ten-
nessee Gas Transmission Corporation, Addison Wesley Pub-
lishing Company, and the Michigan Chemical Corporation.

f

neering institutes. Courses and programs are specially de-
signed to meet the needs of industries of the region served
by the University and are given on campus or at industrial
locations. The International Programs Oﬂice manages the
Engineering School’s participation in two AID sponsored
programs of assistance and collaboration which exist between
the University of Pittsburgh and universities in South
America. The program with the Central University in Quito,
Ecuador, has been in operation since 1963, and Engineering
is one of the participating schools of the University of Pitts-
burgh. The program at the Universidad Tecnica Federico
Santa Maria in Valparaiso, Chile, in operation since 1959,
has been exclusively an Engineering School program.

Under the direction of Professor E. A. DeLeo, the Engi-
neering Records and Services OHice’s functions were ex-
panded to provide improved information and records service
for the academic and administrative oﬂices of the School of
Engineering. A computerized information retrieval program
for student and alumni records is being developed and will
soon be operational. A clerical—stenographic pool under the
supervision of the director of the Engineering Records and
Services Office was initiated this year, and a School-wide
duplicating service for both students and faculty was in-
augurated on a cost—plus basis.

Faculty committees within the School of Engineering
serve to involve faculty members in important policy and
procedural activities for the School. Reports from committees
identify problem areas for study by the Administrative Com-
mittee, whose recommendations to the Executive Committee

produce School policy.

Engineering Undergraduare Adminisfrufive
Commiﬁee

The School of Engineering Undergraduate Administrative
Committee’s chairman is Associate Dean W. R. Turkes, and
the members are the associate chairmen from each depart-
ment and the director of the Engineering Records and
Services Office. This committee has prime responsibility to
maintain the effective operation of the undergraduate aca-
demic program, including preparation of class schedules,
application of academic discipline regulations, orientation
and counseling procedures, seminar schedules, and routine

problems of administration.

The Sianding Commiﬁee on Graduafe Programs

This committee was appointed at the beginning of the
1966-67 academic year to assist in the formulation of uniform
and effective policies relative to the operation of all graduate
programs in the School of Engineering and to assist in the
supervision of these programs. The committee reports to
the Dean, is chaired by Dr. T. W. Sze, and includes faculty

representatives from all departments.

Faculiy and Supporﬁng Staff

As a result of 1966-67 recruiting efforts, there will be 111
faculty associated with the School of Engineering at the start
of the 1967-68 academic year. There was a net gain of six
in the Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Full Pro-
fessor ranks during the year with another eight promoted
within those ranks. The number of adjunct and instructor
appointments was reduced substantially. Accompanying the
limited growth in numbers has been a marked improvement
in the academic and professional st'ature of the facility. In
our move toward excellence in professional personnel, some
faculty have been released to earn advanced degrees, to
mature at cither institutions, and to gain industrial experience.

Research

The School of Engineering grant and contract research
activities have increased substantially during the past two
years. In 1965-66 there were 37 active projects with a dollar
volume of $2,071,567 under the technical supervision of engi-
neering faculty. This year there are 38 active projects with a
dollar volume of $2,702,768, and 36 projects pending with a
dollar volume of $10,429,094.

The New Engineering Program

As the needs of our technology—dominated twentieth
century shift and change, as society and the industries of that
society become ever more complex, so the programs and
curricula which serve as the bases for the education of new
engineers to function within that society and its industries
must change.

The undergraduate program in the School of Engineer-
ing at the University of Pittsburgh has been studied and
restructured, and a new program which we believe will
provide a better education for all undergraduates has been
formulated. The new curriculum will depart from the tradi-
tional engineering programs in significant ways.

Traditionally, engineering students were required to
choose specialties such as electrical, industrial, or mechanical
engineering early in their college programs. Under the new
curriculum, all engineering students will follow a common
program for most of their first four terms. This program
is designed to provide a strong foundation in subjects which
are fundamental to all engineering. During the ﬁnal two
years the students will follow special areas of concentration
and will have more flexibility in choosing non-technical
elective courses. Upon completion of this eight—term pro-
gram, the engineering graduate will receive the Bachelor of
Science in Engineering with an area of special competence
designated.

The School of Engineering feels that its new program
can better accommodate three distinct types of engineering
students: those who plan full—time professional employment
upon graduation; those who plan full—time graduate study
in engineering; and those who plan to use their engineering
education as the basis for graduafe study in other professions
or disciplines.

Information about the new program may be obtained
upon written inquiry to the Oﬂice of the Dean.

How do you stop the ravages of cancer? Or control
the weather? Can natural resources be synthesized?
How do you unlock the secrets of the ocean?

These, and many more questions of vital importance
to society, need answers.

It is Varian’s business to find these answers, through
the design and production of scientific instruments
and components. This requires an atmosphere where
creativity is unhampered by rigid procedures, where
technical breakthroughs and accelerated professional
growth are commonplace. And this atmosphere

is what Varian provides.

For example, all Varian employees are invited to
frequent seminars conducted by renowned

scientists from leading universities and industry.
They are exposed to the latest scientific thinking and
receive stimulating cross-learning exposure in a variety
of fields, not necessarily related to company
technologies. They’re also able to continue their
education, with tuition reimbursement, at the accredited
universities and colleges near every Varian location.
And your scope isn’t limited at Varian. For example,

we led in the commercial development
of the Klystron power tube, invented the
VacIon pump and pioneered the commercial development
and application of linear accelerators, NMR spectrometers,
spectrophotometers, and gas chromatographs, to mention
just a few. Further, Varian research is finding new uses

for electronics principles in commercial applications,
increasing man's understanding of life processes, using
microwaves in heating and processing, and much more.
You're invited to come along.

Positions offering hard work and intellectual stimulation
exist, at all degree levels, for physicists, chemists, and
electrical and mechanical engineers. You pick the
department—research, development, design,
manufacturing, or service engineering —— and the area—
California, New York, New Jersey, or Massachusetts.

Microwave, still in its infancy, is the
workhorse of modern communications.

by Al Spires

lniroducfion

Recently, the laser has been introduced as the potential

_supercarrier of communications, with a single laser beam

transmitting thousands of channels around the world. Yet
today, exceptional reliability, large capacity, and lightning
speed maintain microwave at the forefront in communica-
tion systems.

Over half of all long distance phone calls travel via
microwaves. So do operation and control of electric power
transmission and oil pipeline systems. Computers “talk”
continuously to each other over microwaves. Police and
turnpike authorities control traffic with ease with them.
Railroads are turning to microwave in order to handle a
growth in data communication feasibly impossible to be
handled by any other means. Our space program would
not exist without microwave communications. Whereas in
the past microwaves transmitted primarily oral communi-
cations, today data, TV, and high speed facsimile trans-
mission are the prime justifications of a microwave system.
Any intelligence that can be reduced to electrical impulses
can be carried on microwave.

Wha'l' Are Microwaves?

Microwaves are simply electromagnetic waves of very
short wavelengths. They extend over a range of 1m. —
.01mm in wavelength and 300 Hz. — 300 GHz (1 GHz. =
109Hz.) in frequency. The frequency range from 1000 GHz.
— 3000 GHz. is very little explored, hence, most’ all micro-
wave communication takes place around the 6 GHz. region
where techniques of generation, detection, transmission,,and
ampliﬁcation are established, efficient, and relatively easy.

Microwave Generation and Amplificafion

Primarily two different types of tubes are utilized today
for the generation and ampliﬁciation of microwave signals:
the klystron tubes and the traveling—wave tubes.

Klystron operation depends chiefly on velocity modula-
tion of an electron beam. The schematic of a typical kly—
stron is shown in Fig. #1. Klystrons may vary in the num-
ber of cavities used, but the general operation is outlined
here with two cavities only. One cavity is the input cavity
(the buncher) and one is the output cavity (the catcher).
These cavities are simply hollow volumes of the proper
dimensions so as to resonate at the proper frequency. Across

the buncher’s grids appears a sinusoidal microwave voltage

that velocity-modulates the electron beam; i.e., the electrons
are bunched into discrete groups having a given Velocity
with a given intergroup spacing. The electron beam then
travels into a drift space where it receives energy (through
acceleration) from the collector, and the catcher is located
further on at a point of maximum bunching where it
“catches” the energy from the beam. Only a small amount
of energy is required for modulation, while the bunched
beam gives up considerable energy to the catcher. Hence,
microwave ampliﬁcation is possible, and if the buncher and
catcher are coupled by a feedback circuit, oscillation results.
However, single cavity klystrons called reﬂex klystrons are
most commonly used as oscillators.

Traveling—wave tubes consist of a slow—wave structure
and an electron beam. A schematic is shown in Fig. #2.
The beam is focused either magnetically or electrostatically,
and the speed of the microwaves in the direction of motion

is reduced to the speed of the electron beam by the slow-
wave structure. Energy interaction then occurs between the
electron beam and the waves, and the electromagnetic ﬁeld
energy of the waves is augmented by the kinetic energy of
the electron beam, resulting in ampliﬁcation.

The disadvantages of tubes are quite apparent. Power
consumption is rather large, and ﬁlaments burn out too
often. Relay stations located in remote areas need reliable,
low—power equipment to minimize maintenance visits, and
to insure continued operation on battery power if conven-
tional power should fail. Presently, therefore, transistorized
equipment dominates the microwave market. One type of
solid state signal source consists of a crystal—controlled tran-
sistor oscillator and varactor diodes for multiplying the fre-
quency into the microwave region. Another more recent
development not yet in general use is the Gunn pulser.
In this device a pulsed D.C. voltage lasting approximately
10‘8 seconds and occurring approximately 60 times per second
is applied across a crystal doped with gallium arsenide. A
microwave frequency is then generated that is inversely

proportional to the length of the crystal. These methods

are by no means the extent of solid state applications in
microwave, and many new advances are explored every day.

Microwave Transmission

Repeater stations are the key to microwave transmission.
Characteristic of the light ray because of their short wave-
length, microwaves propagate along a straight line-of-sight
path. Therefore, a parabolic antenna at the originating
point focuses the microwave energy into a narrow beam
that is aimed directly at a receiving dish. Here, at the
repeater station, the signal is ampliﬁed and sent to another
transmitting parabola where the process is initiated over
again. Hence, microwave messages are transmitted over
dishlike antennas that are spaced some 25 t'o 30 miles apart
over the countryside.

The older repeater stations consisted of two back—to-back

other mixer and combined there with another crystal—con-
trolled local oscillator. In this case the higher frequency is
chosen, then ampliﬁed and transmitted as the relayed signal.
The opposite channel works identically the same way, and
diplexers in the antenna system direct the two different
frequencies to their proper channels.

The heterodyne principle is also used at the terminal
stations as shown in Fig. #4. Here, the input signal is
ampliﬁed and used to modulate the LP. signal that drives
the power ampliﬁer. Incoming signals are detected by a
conventional broadband superheterodyne receiver. Phase-
lock detectors, parametric ampliﬁers, and tL1nnel diodes have
greatly improved effective signal—to—noise ratios in these

formance is a prime prerequisite of a good microwave sys-
tem. Therefore, techniques such as space diversity and
frequency diversity were developed to meet these speci-
ﬁcations.

Frequency diversity employs two separate frequencies,
both of which carry the same signal. The receiving equip-
ment then automatically selects the frequency giving the
best transmission at any given instant. The theory here is
that interference and fading will not occur on both frequen-
cies simultaneously. This practice is used extensively over
water where fading is most severe.

Space diversity utilizes one frequency but two separate
receiving dishes, usually on the same tower but separated
by a difference of about one—half a microwave wavelength.
Here again, the theory is that if fading occurs on one signal,
the other will not fade because of the one-half wavelength
separation. Receiving equipment can then instantaneously
switch to the stronger transmission.

Poor accessibility to repeater stations has also led to the
innovation of “passive repeaters.” A passive repeater is
simply a large metallic billboard arrangement that acts like
a mirror to microwave signals. In rugged terrain these pas-
sive repeaters are hauled to the rnountaintops by helicopter,
and the signal equipment is installed near highways and
power lines at a lower elevation. The signal is then bounced
from peak to peak and ﬁnally down to the receiver, or to a

regular repeater station. Passive repeaters can also be used
to reflect the signal at the top of a tower to its base, thus
eliminating the need for long waveguide runs. Again, main-
tenance is nil and realiability is optimum for passive repeaters.

When microwave began some 15 years ago, 24 voice
channels seemed quite adequate for the private systems.
Today this ﬁgure stands at 600, and the transmission of
closed circuit TV and high—speed data places more and more
demand on microwave systems. Telegraphy, slow-speed
data, telemetering, and control signals are transmitted as
pulsed tones over microwaves. Several hundred channels
can be transmitted over a single voice channel, and each
tone channel is capable of handling in excess of 70 bits of
information per second. Educational TV has had a marked
increase in microwave operation. A school or college facility
can now put up to four different lesson programs on the air
at one time with the same privacy enjoyed by a wire system
at minimal cost. Microwave systems provide remarkable
reliability for the private operator. Railroads, oil ﬁrms, and
power companies receive close to 99.99% operation time with
the new solid state equipment. Microwaves span rivers and
lakes with ease; they brave sleet, snow, hail, and ﬂoods that
wires could never weather. Certainly, today and long into
the forseeable future, microwave and communication are
synonymous.

The Heart of Stee1—Making

An explanation of the reactions inside a

modern blast furnace.

Introduction

In order to execute a thorough examination of the blast
furnace, it is necessary to follow through the steps of de-
velopment of the furnace, and then discuss the entire pro-
cess of producing pig iron as it is today.

Pig iron is the intermediate form through which almost
all iron must pass in the manufacture of steel and a high
variety of iron castings. The first attempts to produce pure
iron were in ancient “pit furnaces.” Here charcoal and iron
ore were placed in an open pit and burned. The product
was a ball of wrought iron that settled in the bottom of the
pit, and was created by the chemical reaction Fe2O3 —l—
3C = 3C0 -l— 2Fe. This process was quite crude, however.
Eventually bellows were added to force more air into the
pit. This raised the temperature enough to make the ball
spongy and semi—molten. Later the pit was abandoned and
stone walls were erected. This was known as the Catalan
Hearth.

The Catalan Hearth
The Catalan Hearth originated about 1293 A.D. and

represented a major advance in the manufacturer of
wrought iron direct from the ore. The Catalan forge
originally made use of a water blower or trompe for pro-
ducing the blast. In this device, water was" allowed to fall
vertically through a hollow wooden pipe, about 30 feet
long, which contained several small holes near the upper
end. The water thus aspirated air down the tube into a
Wooden chamber, from which the air was driven through
an opening in the top to a tuyere, and into the furnace.
The water escaped through a smaller opening in the bottom
of the chamber. The eﬂiciency of the Catalan Forge, which
is said to have produced about 140 pounds of wrought iron
in five hours, was considerably higher than that of earlier
furnaces.

The Stuckofen

It was not until 1350 that iron makers in Central Europe
developed a furnace that would produce something besides
wrought iron. This development was the result of efforts
to reduce the fuel consumption and the cost of manufacture
by increasing the size, especially the height, of the furnaces
used in the production of wrought iron. The new metal
made by these furnaces was not a wrought iron because it
was not impregnated with slag and it was taken from the
furnace in a molten state. Its properties were also much

unlike wrought iron because it was hard, brittle, and
showed a crystalline structure when fractured. This new
furnace, known as the stﬁckofcn, or old high bloomery, was
built of masonry that enclosed a vertical chamber in the
form of two truncated cones placed base to base, in a crude
Way resembling the lines of the modern blast furnace. The
raw materials—iron ore, flux, and charcoal——were charged
into the top of the shaft, while air under relatively low
pressure was blown into the furnace through a tuyere or
tuyeres near the bottom of the structure. The fuel and ore
was replenished in the top of the furnace from time to
time as smelting proceeded. Liquid, high-carbon iron often
was produced in the stiickofen, intentionally or otherwise.
This reaction occurred when the reduced iron came in con-
tact with hot fuel, away from the hot air blast, long enough
to absorb sufficient carbon to lower its melting point to a
temperature where it would become liquid. The reaction
which took place due to the increased height and tempera-
ture Were:

F920’ + CO -9 zfeo + co!
F¢°+C0-‘Fe-!-CO’
C "1" CO’--0-ZCO

By this process, the iron ore was reduced to FeO as it settled
down from above, and eventually to Fe as it reached the
bottom. Under this process, however, charcoal was still
employed as a source of carbon. This charcoal was highly
compressible and blocked the How of air and hot -gases as
they rose to the top of the furnace. For this reason, the
height of the furnace was limited until coke was intro-

duced as a source of carbon in 1619. Coke was bulky and
allowed air passages to fofm. With this improvement, the
size of the furnace could be greatly expanded, especially in
height. Some of today’s blast furnaces are over 200 feet tall.
One unfortunate disadvantage of coke was that it intro-
duced sulphur into the pig iron. This takes us to a
thorough discussion of the principles and operation of the
blast furnace as it is today.

The Modern B|as'|' Furnace

In order to expedite an orderly investigation of these
processes, we will follow through with the major materials,
reactions, and controls of the modern blast furnace. In the
blast furnace process, iron—bearing materials, coke, and flux
(limestone or dolomite) are charged into the top of the
furnace. Heated air and, in some instances, fuel are blown
in at the bottom. The blast air burns part of the fuel to
produced heat for the chemical reactions and melting the
iron. The balance of the fuel and part of the gas from
the combustion of coke remove the oxygen combined with

the metal.

The functions of the raw materials are as follows:

1. Iron-bearing materials supply the element iron,
which in turn represents 93.5% of the pig iron. The major
iron—bearing materials are ore, sinter, pellets, and roll scale.

2. Coke is used to produce the heat required for smelt-
ing and to supply the chemical reactants (primarily carbon
monoxide) for reducing iron ore. In addition, coke supplies
the carbon which dissolves in the hot metal —— 3% to 4%.

3. Since all of the carbon monoxide cannot be used in
the blast furnace (because of equilibrium limitations), the
gas issuing from the top of the furnace contains enough
combustible carbon monoxide to have a caloric value of
between 85 and_ 100 BTU/cubic foot. This gas is passed
through the uptakes of the furnace (see Fig. 2), until it
contains .2 grains of dust per cubic foot. This cleaned gas
is used to preheat the stoves and to generate power for
running the blowers, thus returning as much of the energy
as possible back to the process. The gas in excess of that
needed for the stoves and blowers is generally used for
ﬁring boilers to produce energy for other parts of the steel
plant.

The functions of fluxes are twofold: (1) to form a
ﬂuid slag with the coke ash, ore gangue, and any other
charged impurities; (2) to form a slag of such chemical
composition that will provide a degree of control over the
sulphur content of the iron.

Reaciions

The reactions start as soon as the raw materials enter
the furnace and come in contact with an ascending current
of hot gases (temperature 270°C). The ﬁrst change that
takes place is the physical change of drying. The hygro-
scopic water, being ﬁrst driven off and carried out of the
furnace by these gases, is then followed by the water of
crystallization. The stock, with its interstitial spaces ﬁlled
with an ascending atmosphere containing the reducing
gas CO, starts to descend toward the bottom of the furnace
and to regions of higher and higher temperatures. At
different levels then,°chemical reactions peculiar to the
temperatures of these levels occur (see Fig. 3). At ﬁrst only
the oxides of iron and carbon suffer change. During one
of -the ﬁrst reactions, 2Fe2O3 —l— 8CO = 7CO3 —l— 4Fe
+ 8C, carbon deposition may begin at a temperature as low
as 300°C. In the presence of both C and CO, a larger part

of the remaining iron and oxide, of small particle size, is

'next reduced at successive levels and temperatures as

follows:

3F¢’O’ 4' {go-.  + 2Fo’O‘, begin: at 450°C

I-7:30‘ -4- {E05 23; +3!-'90, complete It 600°C
FeO + {€022  4- F20, begins .2 7oo'c

At about 800°C, the free iron is subject to reoxidation by
C02, as are the compounds, FeO and Fe3O‘, though to a
lesser degree, the chief action being represented by this
equation: Fe + CO2 = FeO —l— CO. These reactions and
temperatures apply only to very ﬁne ore. Lump ore,
especially if it is not very porous, will descend to much
higher temperatures before it is acted upon, the large dense
lumps even to the level of the bosh. At 800°C, or a
little above, the decomposition of limestone takes place:
CaCO3 = CaO -l- CO2, complete at 1000°C. At 900°C,
carbon reduces CO2 to CO; C -1- CO2 = 2CO, so that CO2
does not normally exist below the 60-foot level. From this
level, the mixture is one of gangue, quick lime, coke,

spongy-iron, and varying amounts of unreduced ore, all of
which descend to the fusion zone with very little change.
At this level, which is located at the top of the bosh, the
lime combines with some of the gangue and forms part
of the slag. The slag, such as is already formed, and the
iron, both now in liquid state, trickle down through the
interstices of the coke to the hearth, where they become
separated by gravity, forming two layers: (1) a lower
metallic layer containing all reduced substances; (2) an
upper or slag layer containing all unreduced matter. Here,
since these two layers are in contact with each other and
with carbon of the coke, the hearth reactions occur.

During the material’s descent, there are several control
measures which influence the presence of desirable and un-
desirable elements: Below are some of the ones for major
elements in the hot metal.

At the temperature in the upper part of the blast furnace
stack, some of the higher oxides of manganese are reduced
by CO according to the following equations:

Mac‘ + co -- Mno+co*
Mn’0* + C0 -- 3M..o + co‘

The lower oxides of maganese (MnO), however, cannot be
further reduced by CO or hydrogen at any of the tempera-
tures that are encountered in the stack. Consequently, the
only chemical equation that expresses the ﬁnal reduction of
this element is MnO —l— C = Mn —l- CO. This reaction takes
place only at temperatures above 2700°C, and absorbs large
quantities of heat. At higher temperatures, the percentage of
Mn that can be reduced in a blast furnace increases. But
in most basic practices, this amounts to about 60 to 75 per
cent of the manganese charged. The manganese that is
reduced dissolves in the hot metal, while the unreduced
portion becomes part of the slag.

The reduction of SiO2 takes place only at very high
temperatures: SiO2 + 2C = Si —l— ZCO AH = 157,400 cal.

The rate of this reaction is relatively slow, but accelerates
with an increase in temperature. For any particular burden
and slag composition, the silicon content of the hot metal
is proportional to the hot metal temperature. The per-
centage of silicon in the hot metal can also be varied by
increasing the silicon content of the charge and the coke
input.

The reduction of phosphorous also takes place only at
very high temperatures; however, unlike manganese and
silicon, the phosphorous is almost completely reduced. For
this reason, almost all the phosphorous in the charge will
dissolve in the hot metal. The only means of controlling
the phosphorous content of the hot metal is by limiting the
amount in the charge.

Sulphur enters the blast furnace mainly in the coke, and
is released into the blast furnace gas stream as H28 or a
gaseous compound of carbon monoxide and sulphur (COS)
when the coke is burned. As the gas ascends through the
stack, some of the sulphur combines with this lime of the
flux and some combines with the iron. The exact mecha-
nism of the reaction by which sulphur combines with iron
is not known; however, it is generally believed to be

The "Doro'l-hy" Blasi Furnace of

FeO + COS = FeS -Jr C03. The sulphur that combines
with the iron must be removed at the very high tempera—
tures that exist in the hearth. This is done by reduction
of the iron sulphide in the presence of a basic ﬂux, such as
lime (CaO). The chemical equation for this reaction is
often written FeS + CaO —l— C = Q18 -1- Fe —I— CO. The
extent of sulphur removal depends on the temperature in
the hearth, and if the basicity ratio,
is greater than one, sulphur will be reduced. SiO3 —f— Al-‘O3

The conditions which tend to raise the silicon content
of the iron will lower the sulphur, provided the slag volume
is adequate and the high temperature is obtained without
the use ofexcessive amount of high sulphur coke.

Conclusion

The modern blast furnace, then, is a shaft furnace,
gradually evolved from the Catalan Forge, and stiickofen.
In its early days, it was called a high furnace, from its
German name “hochofen.” It is designed solely to produce
molten iron, and operates continuously in that the solid
raw materials (ore, colre, and limestone) are charged at the
top at regular short intervals, and the molten iron and slag
which collect in the hearth are tapped at longer intervals.

It is accomplishments and improvements like those men-
tioned above that reflect the usefulness of the metallurgical
engineer. There are still many problems that challenge the
metallurgical engineer to make even more improvements
and increase the efficiency of the blast furnace.

Ini-roducﬁon

Iust ten years ago a challenge was issued to the world of
physical and life sciences to produce an artiﬁcial heart capa-
ble of supporting life for a prolonged period. This challenge
has since been accepted by many researchers, and among
these is an engineering—medical team from the University
of Pittsburgh. Following a proposal formulated by N. H.
Wackenhut, Research Assistant Professor of Mechanical
Engineering, Professor Wackenhut and Dr. George I.
Magovern, Associate Professor of Surgery in the School of
Medicine, began a cooperative effort to develop a prosthetic
device which would assume completely the pumping func-
tion of the natural heart. They were joined, soon after, by
Dr. Richard Donovan, Assistant Professor of Mechanical
Engineering.

The rationale upon which the University of Pittsburgh
Artiﬁcial Heart is based may be summarized very briefly
as follows:

1. The components must be small in size and light in
weight so that the intracorporeal components can be
implanted in the chest or abdominal region, and so
that the extracorporeal components are portable.

2. The artificial heart should closely approximate the
essential pumping functions of the natural heart.
These include a pulsatile cardiac output (blood flow
rate) of adequate quantity and pressure, minimal
damage to red corpuscles and minimal tendency to
form blood clots, and ventricular bloodflow outputs
which are equal on the average and which are de-
pendent upon their venous (ﬁlling) pressure.
Maximum reliability of all components is essential.
This implies simplicity and minimum moving parts.

IUJ

The Pittsburgh Artiﬁcial Heart has been conceived and
is being developed on the basis of the above three criteria.
The artiﬁcial heart contains a closed hydraulic system in
which water is circulated by a centrifugal pump. Looking
at the hydraulic (water) side of the artiﬁcial heart system

(Figure 1), electrical energy is transferred to hydraulic flow
energy in the motor—centrifugal pump unit. The steady
hydraulic How is converted to a pulsatile How in the Huidics
pulse generator. This pulsatile flow alternately forces blood
from the two ventricles into their respective arteries. In the
ventricles, a double diaphragm separates the hydraulic fluid
from the blood with the space between the two diaphragms
vented to the atmosphere.

The fluidics pulse generator is of particular interest. This
device was developed because of the recognized inherent
reliability of fluidics elements, principally because of their

lack of moving parts. Fluidics devices are relatively simple,
usually two-dimensional geometric shapes or channels which
direct or otherwise control the How of fluid using principles
and phenomena of ﬂuid dynamics to perform functions of
sensing logic or control. The fluidics pulse generator
(Figure 1) contains three Huidics devices: a wall attach-
ment or Coanda effect (same effect that makes water pour
down the o_utside of a glass full of water if the glass is
slowly tipped), digital ampliﬁer, and two vortex ampliﬁers
which perform as proportional ampliﬁers or variable re-
strictors. Figure 1 shows the main stream of water at-
tached to the left wall of the digital ampliﬁer, thereby ﬁlling
the water side of the left ventricle and discharging blood
into the aorta. At the same time a small portion of the
stream is bypassed through the vortex ampliﬁer, forming a
strong vortex and thereby creating a high pressure at the
outer periphery of the device, which in effect “closes” the
return passage leading to the suction side of-the centrifugal
pump. On the other hand, since no stream is being directed
through the right side of the digital ampliﬁer, no vortex
exists and, therefore, the return passage connecting the
Water side of the right ventricle to the suction side of the
pump is “open.” Consequently, the water side of the right
ventricle is being emptied permitting blood to enter. Re-
turning our attention to the left side, when the water side
diaphragm reaches its limit of ﬁlling, a pressure pulse or
surge is transmitted through the left control passage and
flips the main stream over to the right wall. The previously
described events are now repeated on this side and the main
stream is then switched back to the left side where the en-
tire cycle begins anew. The pulse rate is a function of the
system impedance, the pump motor RPM and the ventricu-
lar displacement volume. Since the latter two are control-
lable, a wide range of pulse rates and stroke volumes are
possible.

66

A very important feature of the artiﬁcial heart is that
the blood ﬁlls the ventricles primarily in proportion to the
blood ﬁlling pressure or venous pressure, and is not affected
by the suction of the centrifugal pump, since the region be-
tween the water side diaphragm and the blood side dia-
phragm is vented to the atmosphere. A

The University of Pittsburgh Artiﬁcial Heart has been
used on experimental animals with encouraging results.
Although much progress has been made, much work lies
ahead. The several units must each be reﬁned and must be
brought together into a more compact package capable of
implantation.

When a physical system contains one or more nonlinear
components, (for example, saturation, hysteresis, threshold,
product of two signals, and power law devices, etc.,) its
analysis and design, in general, become very complicated.
The superposition principle upon which we heavily rely in
linear system analysis is no longer applicable here. The in-
teraction between components becomes rather complex, and
the system responses cannot be easily predicted. One of

Dr. C. C. Li’s current research projects is concerned with
the estimation of transient responses of a class of nonlinear
feedback control systems. By the use of the frequency re-
sponse of the linear components and other system para-
meters, a time-varying upper bound has been obtained for
the nonlinear system transient reponse. Such a bound is
calculable in a straight—forward manner. An example is
shown in Fig. 1. It is hoped that this may be used to
estimate, to a certain extent, how fast the system responds
under a given condition, and thus may prove useful in the
system design.

ACTH Research

Another nonlinear system research project is associated
with the modeling of a physiological process, namely,
dynamic response of adrenocortical secretion to ACTH.
Dr. Li has been collaborating with Dr. I. Urquhart, Depart-
ment of Physiology, School of Medicine, since 1964. The
adrenal cortex is one element of a neuroendocrine control
system which includes the hypothalamus and the anterior
pituitary gland as shown by the block diagram of Fig. 2.

One of the principal hormones secreted by the adrenal cor-
tex is cortisol, which is an important chemical messenger
for communication and control of protein metabolism, etc.
Three sets of nonlinear differential equations have been ob-
tained to represent three different mathematical models,
each of which simulates the experimentally measured cortisol
secretion rate of the adrenal cortex in response -to step
changes of ACTH input; but each suggests a different
hypothesis for biochemical mechanism. The objective of the
biological system modeling is to derive, as closely as we can,
the underlying principles of life processes. Abstract studies
are under way on these mathematical models with regard
to the sensitivity, stability, possibility of eliciting sustained
oscillations, and its information processing capacity, in order
to make further improvements onour models.

Editorial

Those Thousand Words

How could anyone ever photograph religion? This was a ques-
tion my photo editor asked me when I explained to him the subject
of my editorial. Curiously, the picture we chose to accompany the
editorial does not have any people in it. Could a subject so personal
as religion be represented fairly in a photograph of an empty building?

With the Holiday season approaching, I felt that my photogra-
phers certainly would be able to come through with a really expressive
photograph on religion. Our dozens of photographs of frantic down-
town shoppers, however, did not quite convey this religious feeling.
We took some fine pictures of two children on Santa’s knee; but then
we heard their parents arguing about these expensive Holidays, spend-
ing $400 for a color television, $200 for the children's toys, and $10 to
their church. I Won’t mention which ﬁgure was being debated.

We also had a delicious-looking photograph of a family surround-
ing a huge turkey and all its trimmings at the table on Christmas.
But then we thought of the many who won’t see such a palatable ex-
travaganza in their home this year, while the “religious” initiate this
feast with a very mechanical saying of Grace. I

But how can I judge from a photograph a person’s religious
sincerity? What makes one Christmas shopper a good-hearted altruist,
and another a commercialized purchaser? How can I tell whether the
person that gives a large" offering is just ridding himself of pocket
change, or is really making a substantial contribution considering his
ﬁnances? Or is just being present in church to make this offering
enough to expect of anyone this Christmas? How can I tell that the
family seated for dinner really appreciates this chance of being together
again, or are time-worn hatreds between certain members about to
break out again?

Rather than guess for these answers and be wrong, I decided to
use the quiet, sincere, simple but lovely church on the opposite page.
What you and I can’t see in this picture are the inhabitants. I used
four adjectives to describe this church. According to the old proverb,
you have 996 words to tell me about the people inside.

some engineering systems for possibly improving their per-
formances under diverse environmental conditions. A pre-
liminary study has been undertaken on the minimum—fuel
learning control of space vehicles. Fig. 3 illustrates a single-
axis learning control scheme of an inertia object. Under a
given input, there are two switching curves for the com-
bination of minimum—fucl and minimum—time performance.
When input changes from time to time, a pattern recogni-
tion device in the system monitors the system variables and
classifies the various situations to provide for adequate
switching conditions. A computer simulation study is
presently underway.

Po'|"l'ern Recogniﬁon Research

With regard to the pattern recognition research, Dr. Li
together with Dr. T. W. Sze and their students are working
on some aspects of feature extraction and learning algorithms
pertaining to the handwriting and handwritten character
recognition problems. If the direction—time coding method
is used in the feature extraction of handwriting characters,
the total strokes in a character are divided into a speciﬁc
number of segments; the slope of each segment is suitably
quantized by an integer as the direction number of the
segment as, for example, shown in Fig. 4  Then the
character “a” shown in Fig. 4 (b) may be represented
either by a quantized signal ‘shown in Fig. 4 (C) or by a
pattern vector whose components are the respective direc—
tion numbers of the segments. A statistical study of an
individual’s writing style is being compiled; with stochastic
features available, a new learning algorithm will be de-
veloped for testing pattern separability and eﬁiciency of’ the
recognition scheme. A new scheme for handwritten char-
acter recognition is also being investigated in conjunction
with Dr.  Castle’s research team at the University’s Learn-

ing Research and Development Center.

The various research projects mentioned above have
been largely supported by grants from NASA and NIH.

Siochosfic Model of Molion

Traditionally, transport processes of small suspended
particles are described‘ in the deterministic system by dif-
ferential equations. For example, in the transport of small
suspended solid particles in a corner of a straight channel,
secondary currents and the combination of the primary and
secondary ﬂows result in a three-dimensional spiral ﬂow.
Equations describing this flow cannot be solved analytically,
but can be solved by a numerical method such as the re-
laxation method, provided necessary boundary values are
available. One of the difﬁculties in using the relaxation
method to solve these equations is the absence of reliable
natural boundary values. The other difficulty experienced
in using the relaxation method is that the method is not
suitable for machine computations.

Above diﬂiculties suggest the use of the Monte Carlo
methodito ﬁnd solutions to the complex partial diﬂerential
equations. In the common usage, the Monte Carlo method

«)4

\a,-

is “synonymous with any use of random sampling in treat-
ment of either deterministic or probabilities problems.” In
using a Monte Carlo method to estimate the concentration
of solid particles, the particle motion of random character
can be represented by a stochastic model and simulated on
a digital computer by generating random numbers at each
step of the motion to trace the particle path.

The writer has attempted to develop a stochastic model
of the motion of a small solid particle suspended in a three-
dimensional (spiral) turbulent How. A corner region of a
straight channel, in which the semi—empirical method of
calculating secondary velocities is limited, is used as a “de-
vice” for generating secondary currents. The developed
model can be used to simulate the motion of each sediment
particle in the Monte Carlo method of estimating the par-
ticle concentration.

Mon'|'e Carlo Simulufion

In the Monte Carlo method, after‘ formulating the proba-
bilistic or random process of the transport of suspended par-
ticles, the next step is to simulate the process on a digital
computer; that is, to trace the path of the random walk of
each solid particle released from an instantaneous point
source. ‘The stochastic process model can be used to trace
the particle path. The boundary of the region in which the
coordinate system is valid may be considered to be an absorb-
ing barrier or a partially reflecting barrier. If the boundary
is considered to be an absorbing barrier, once a particle hits
the boundry in an attempt to penetrate, the particle is con-
sidered to be lost. A partially reflecting barrier, on the other
hand, reflects or returns a solid particle back inside the region
with a certain probability. By considering the boundary as
a partially reﬂecting barrier, it is possible to consider the
probability that a solid particle returns to the region inside
the boundary after penetrating the boundary and wandering
outside for a period of time.

A practical application of the above model and method
to a study of sediment transport in a three—dimensional tur-
bulent flow will be represented in a subsequent paper. How-
ever, to show the general pattern of the path of the particle
motion described by the developed model, Fig. 6 is pre-
sented here. The irregular curve shown in Fig. 6 is one of
the possible paths of the motion of a sample sediment par-
ticle in a corner of a rectangular channel, which was actually
simulated on an IBM 7090 digital computer.

Conclusions

A stochastic model of the motion of small solid particles
in a three—dimensional turbulent flow, within a region where
a semi—empirical method of calculating secondary flow is
valid, has been obtained. In the model the distance and the
duration of each step of the random walk of a solid particle
are considered as two variables, which depend on flow
properties and two generated random numbers at the start-
ing position of the step. The developed model can be used
for computer simulation of the particle motion in the Monte
Carlo method of estimating the concentration of particles.
Consideration of a large number of particles released simul-
taneously from a point source gives the important notion
used in the Monte Carlo method that the probability of a
solid particle being at a position is equivalent to the particle

concentration at the position. As time goes on, since particles
tend to lose the memory of the original source, the depend-
ence of the particle distribution on the location of the point
source may be neglected. Such a Monte Carlo method can
be used to solve an unsteady three-dimensional problem
which can be solved by neither an analytical method nor a
numerical method.

Although the Monte Carlo method is often not economical
for solving problems which can be solved satisfactorily by
conventional analytical or numerical methods, it may be the
only feasible method of hnding solutions for complex multi-
dimensional problems. Such problems as three-dimensional
unsteady motion of solid particles justify the possible large

cost of machine simulations and computations.

 Construction On Campus

A glimpse of new buildings at Pitt.

and Carl Baird

ln'l'roduc'l'ion

At the present time, the University of Pittsburgh operates
42 buildings on the 110-acre main campus in Oakland and
11 buildings in use or under construction at the regional

campuses.

There are many advantages of having the main campus
located in such a thickly populated urban area. Oakland is
an area of stately buildings and many cultural resources;
the symphony, the opera, the principal art gallery, the public
library and museum some of the few. But because the land
is‘ used so extensively, there are handicaps to both the speed
and extent of the University’s expansion.

Nevertheless, the amount of construction underway on
the campus is signiﬁcant and will become even greater in
the near future. Construction now underway on the campus
is valued at $37,200,000. The money for the buildings is
obtained through a combination of resources: the General
State Authority, federal construction grants, and private
resources. Some student activities buildings, such as a Stu-
dent Union, must be constructed largely with private support,
while health and science areas are eligible for federal grant
support, but they also require considerable private support
for certainly costly kinds of equipment and laboratories.

Throughout this article are pictures of the construction
now going on and something about each building. Plans are
made through 1973 for construction from the new dorms to

After these plans, probably the next major area for de-
velopment will be Forbes Field (home of the Pirates.) The
University purchased this property from the Pittsburgh Base-
ball Club for for $3 million in 1958 but will not be able to use
it until the new Pittsburgh Municipal Stadium is completed.
A number of professional schools are planned for the Forbes
Field area.

Buildings alone do not make a University great, but the

to make physical resources compatible with the quality of its

the side of the walk with a broken wing. Instead of going
to the movie she took the bird home bandaged its wing, and
fed it. In a week the bird was well enough to fly away.
Now let’s see you horny engineers ﬁnd anything dirty in

A middle-aged executive was becoming increasingly irritated
by the constant ribbing he received at the hands of junior
employees who couldn’t resist making fun of his baldness.
One morning, a particularly brash trainee had the gall to run
his hand across the older man’s pate while loudly exclaim-
ing, “Feels just like my wife’s ass!”

With a look of genuine curiosity, the aging exec. also felt
his gleaming pate. “You’re right,” he said, “So it does, so
it does.”

By the time Mr. Weymouth got to the hospital where his
wife was expecting, he was told by the receptionist that Mrs.
Weymouth had given birth to triplets. Highly excited, he
rushed upstairs and into the ward where his wife was lying,
to be stopped by a stern—faced nurse who said, “Don’t you
know better than to come in here like that? You’re not
sterilized.”

“Lady,” said the distraught father—of-three, “are you telling

Prepare now for your future in highway
engineering. ..get the facts on The Asphalt
Institute’s new computer-derived method
for determining structural design of Asphalt
pavements for roads and streets

Today, as more and more states turn to modern Deep-
Strength* Asphalt pavement for their heavy-duty highways,
county and local roads, there is a growing demand for engi-
neers with a solid background in the fundamentals of Asphalt
technology and construction.

Help to prepare yourself now for this challenging future by
getting the latest information on the new Thickness Design
Method developed by The Asphalt Institute. Based on exten-
sive statistical evaluations performed on the IBM 1620 and
the mammoth IBM 7090 computers, accurate procedures for
determining road and street structural requirements have
been developed.

All the facts on this new method are contained in The As-
phalt Institute’s Thickness Design manual (MS-1). This help-
ful manual and much other valuable information are included
in the free student library on Asphalt construction and tech-

Here in the hills of East Tennessee we are known as

Eastman

and the atmosphere is sort of different

 

Ladies’ picnic on a Thursday afternoon in Warrior‘s Path State Park near Kingsport, Tenn. Down in the
valley the chemical engineering is as up to date as any on earth, but the tensions of the big cities seem slow
to penetrate the hills of East Tennessee. Some call this isolation and like it. Some wouldn’t. We offer choice.

You may have ﬁrst heard of Kodak when you were eight
years old and grandpa pointed a camera at you. In Kings-
port, Tenn., Longview, Tex., and Columbia, S.C., there
are 15,000 of us who make no cameras and no photo-
graphic ﬁlm but turn out ﬁbers, plastics, and chemical
ingredients for a hundred other industries. In fact, we can
offer no less a variety of chemical engineering opportuni-
ties in those communities than in Rochester, N. Y., where
we produce our renowned photographic goods for enjoy-
ment, for business, for education, and for the professions.

Although many Kodak chemical engineers eventually
move into production or management functions, none
start there. First assignments are in development and
process improvement, or systems and research. A chemi-

cal engineer might also make full use of his professional
competence in liaison with our customer companies, in
which case he is in marketing and had better count on
moving around quite a bit. Otherwise we are so set up
that we can give an engineer all the opportunity for ad-
vancement he wants without ever asking him to change
communities.

We make the same promise to mechanical, electrical,
and industrial engineers, by the way.

Drop a note about yourself to Business and Technical
Personnel Department, Eastman Kodak Company,
Rochester, N.Y. 14650. If you have any geographical
preferences or any other category of preferences in work,
mention them. We are an equal—opportunity employer.

And here, just to be speciﬁc, are what occupy the chemical engineers down in the valley:

RATHER SPECIAL
Solid-phase polymerization
I-ligh—temperature vapor—phase pyrolysis
Liquid-phase air oxidations

That's the traffic picture for now, Bob.”
However, technical people at GE are doing something about it.
Development and design engineers are creating and improving elec-
tronic controls and propulsion systems to guide and power transit trains at
160 mph. Application engineers are developing computerized traffic control

systems. Manufacturing engineers are developing production equipment and

new methods to build better transportation products. And technical marketing
specialists are bringing these products and systems to the marketplace by
working with municipal and government agencies.

Young engineers at GE are also working on the solutions to thousands of
other challenging prob|ems——products for the home; for industry; systems for
space exploration and defense. When you begin considering a career starting

~ .» It might be said, instead, that we specialize in people, for

we believe that people are a most
important reason for our company's success. We act
on that belief.

We select our engineers and scientists carefully. Motivate
them well. Give them the equipment and facilities only a
leader can provide. Offer them company-paid,
graduate-education opportunities. Encourage them to push
into fields that have not been explored before. Keep them
reaching for a little bit more responsibility than they can
manage. Reward them well when they do manage it.
