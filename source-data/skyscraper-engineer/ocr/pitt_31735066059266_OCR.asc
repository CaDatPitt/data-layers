ENGINEERING
ACCELERATION

By Dr. G. R. Fitterer. Dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines

“There is nothing left for the young
man to do today but to record the valiant
deeds of those who have gone before.”

-/lgricola

Since this is the start of -‘the new school year, it
would be well for all engineering students to take a new
look at their profession.‘ Engineering is shifting into a
new gear and the acceleration is already noticeable.

For some time, the signs have been there for those
who will look because science and engineering develop-
ments are taking place in almost every ﬁeld at a stag-
gering rate. The engineering student should know this
and prepare for the age in which he lives.

Unfortunately, many students are interested in
learning only those items of subjects which they think
will be of immediate use to them upon graduation.
They listen attentively in their classes for applications
of sciences, to the production of things as they now
exist. When the professor expounds some theory with-
out inserting an application or two into the dis-
cussion, the interest of these students is quickly lost.
Yet, during his professional career, most of the indus-
trial processes and applications which he has been so
intent to learn (without the theory) will be obsolete
or altered beyond recognition.

D.uring this school year Americans will be ﬂying
regularly in “pure” jet planes for the ﬁrst time. Speeds
up to at least 600 miles per hour at an altitude of 40,-
000 feet will be commonplace in commercial aviation.

We are already deep in an age when complicated
engineering problems which formerly took months to
solve are being solved in minutes by electric computers.

With all these developments, it is the duty of every
engineering student to absorb as many of the various
disciplines to which he is introduced in college as possi-
ible. He should not only master his own specialty but
also as many of the allied sciences as well, so that he
may make a contribution of his own and leave his in-
dividual mark on his generation.

Those who are merely looking for the immediate
dollar upon graduation will probably get it, but within
ten years they will be as obsolete as the empirical
knowledge which they so carefully collected.

No one was ever so wrong as Agricola! I

OPERATORS can make tactical decisions, assign weapons
to attack hostile aircraft and take action to direct inter-
ceptors to their targets. All this is possible through the

sector information which concerns the location speed, and
direction of airborne objects, and the status of defense
weapons.

The reality of push. button warfare

protects the United States
from enemy attack.

J une 27, 1958 probably will not go down in history
as an epoch making date, yet; Americans have good
reason to remember it because on that date the ﬁrst
SAGE (SemiAutomatic Ground Environment) unit in
this country was declared oﬂicially operational during
ceremonies at McGuire Air Force Base near Trenton,
N. 

SAGE, is the nation’s vast, new electronic air warn-
ing network. The “brain” of this new system is a huge
electronic computer, a complex system of wires and tub-
es with an uncanny ability to receive, to memorize, to
calculate, and to record answers instantaneously in
the form of intelligible code upon the face of an elec-
tronic tube similar to a television screen. By watching
this screen, air defense commanders will be able to
follow the air battle situation in their area of responsi-
bility and direct those weapons available to them to

the point of the most immediate and certain destruc-
tion of enemy forces.

The successful air defense of this country depends
on a man’s conquest of the Fourth Dimension——-time.
The speed with which we may receive a warning of
attack and the speed with which we may be made
ready for that attack, if and when it should ever come,
is a problem that must be faced by our military forces.
It is good to know therefore that the SAGE digital
computer is the world’s largest and fastest. It can per-
form 65,000 computations per second.

As the Semi-Automatic portion of the abbreviation
SAGE implies, this new system will apply semi-auto-
matic operation to the handling of air defense informa-
tion and the direction of weapons. The fundamental
improvement which semi-automatic operation brings
under SAGE, is not only greater speed, but also greater

accuracy, reliability and capacity.

Over 30,000 aircraft ﬂights are scheduled over this
country every day, More than 600 incoming and out-
going international ﬂights cross over our borders with-
in each 24-hour period. In addition, there are a great
many more ﬂights that are not scheduled. It’s the job
of our Continental Air Defense forces to identify all
unscheduled or unknown ﬂights as friendly or hostile.
With the introduction of the SAGE system into the
Air defense network, the detection speed and reliabil-
ity with which this can be done has been immeasur-
ably increased.

Radars, located within the United States, Canada
and Alaska, the Civil Aeronautics Administration, Mili-
tary Flight Centers, Navy Picket Ships, Airborn Early
Warning Aircraft and Texas Towers, Air Weather
Service Stations and the Ground Observer Corps are
all a part of the vast information network that sup-
plies the Air Defense Command with vital ﬂight in-
formation. In all, there are 13 major sources of infor-
mation which are fed into the system.

All information received from these sources must
be processed and evaluated. The delays normally en-
countered in manually feeding a direction center with
this information have been eliminated by SAGE.
Air situation data from the radar network are process-
ed by specially designed equipment and sent over
telephone facilities to the SAGE Direction Center where
they are automatically inserted into the electronic
computer. Radar returns received from the smaller
unmanned “Gap Filler” radar stations are processed
in the Mapping Room before going to the computer.
Here the extraneous radar returns such as ground clut-

into the computer. This is accomplished by simply

desirable reutrns using an opaque ink. The photo-
electric cell mounted over the face of the scope cannot

in the painted out area to go into the computer.
Other data such as ﬂight plans, weather, aircraft
status, picket vessel plots and Airborne Early Warning
aircraft plots and Ground Observer Corps sightings,
processed with less frequency, are ﬁrst sent into the
center over the communications facilities and then
transferred to an IBM punch card before they are
inserted into the computer’s “brain”. The computer
then evaluates this information and stores it in “mem-

ory cores” or on revolving magnetic memory drums or
tape. These memory cores are the heart of the com-
puter and are the main disturbing and storage agency
for all data. An electrical impulse is sent to a small,
1/16th-inch donut-shaped core and is stored there
until needed. The revolving drums and magnetic tape
storage areas are used only when the memory core
unit becomes overloaded. Each time another donut-
shaped core becomes available, the information auto-
matically transfers from the drums and tapes. The time
required to store or recall information from the com-
puter is measured in micro—seconds. Over 4,000,000
bits of information may be stored by the computer for
instaneous release.

As far as the computer is concerned these bits look
like numbers. In the case of the SAGE computer, the
only numbers it recognizes are ‘1” and “O.” “1” and
“O” are in the machine in the form of elements that
are “on” or “off”, conducting or non-conducting,
magnetized in one direction or in the other direction.

After the incoming information reaches the com-
puter in this coded form, single arithmetical problems
are solved by comparing the results of calculations of
detected air craft furnished by the air defense network
with those of known ﬂight plans. The computer then
stores the results in an appropriate location or holds
it for the next operation.

A two-story-high pit in the center of the building
serves as the command post for the sector commander.
Directly in front of him and his key staff officers is a

15

large projection screen upon which is ﬂashed an en-
larged, over-all picture of one of the selected picture
display consoles. An English-manufactured Kelvin-
Hughes projector takes a picture of the face of the tube,
develops it and ﬂashes it on the large screen every 30
seconds.

In addition, a picture of the air situation appears
on the display tube of a TV-like console where the
commander sits. Upon these many display tubes ap-
pear letters, numbers and words, geographical outlines
of the area surrounding the direction center, and
radar-blip returns from aircraft ﬂying overhead. Every
few seconds, a new picture is displayed. With the push
of a button, the commander at a SAGE Direction
Center can choose for display on his own display con-
sole the air battle situation in his area, or other areas
adjacent to his own area of responsibility. Each SAGE
Direction Center’s area of coverage overlaps another
center’s so that there will be no “blind spots”. At any
time ,the air battle commander can have the com-
puter display the overall situation or whatever part of
it he wishes to monitor in detail.

Working in four shifts, the operators sit before
their consoles for a total of eight hours a day. They
sit and watch their display tubes as they blink on and
off, changing constantly, providing the latest data
which the operator might need can be called up from
the computer at any time. By pointing a “Buck Rogers”
type of electronic-eye gun at the face of the display
tube, the operator activates a relay that calls up from
the computer and transfers to a smaller ﬁve inch tube
on his console the complete information pertaining
to the situation he is monitoring.

At any time, the operator may introduce to the
computer a bit of information telephoned in to him
by pressing a series of buttons on his console. With un-
failing accuracy and an almost uncanny ability, the
computer accepts this information and stores it for
future use. It this information conﬂicts with the in-
formation already received by the “brain”, or if the
operator has made a mistake in his sequence of button-
pushing, a light ﬂashes and a bell rings, signaling him
to re-check his information or procedure. This is one
case where a man’s mind is overruled by a machine’s
capability!

The computer automatically transmits informa-
tion to ﬁghter-interceptors in the air, guiding them
to the unknown aircraft or enemy bomber. A smaller
display tube, similar to the console display screens in
the direction center, is located in the interceptor.
When the aircraft is equipped with an automatic pilot,
the aircraft itself can be automatically controlled from
the ground by using another SAGE feature called
“data-link.” With data-link, a transmitter on the
ground sends information to a receiver in the aircraft
which changes the radio signal into impulses guiding
the automatic pilot.

In addition, the computer automatically calculates
for the operators the most effective employment of

OPERATORS can make tactical decisions, assign weapons
to attack hostile aircraft and take action to direct inter-
ceptors to their trgets. All this is possible through the
sector information which concerns the location speed, and
direction of airborne objects, and the status of defense
weapons.

such defensive weapons as guided missiles, anti-air-
craft batteries and jet interceptors. The speed, direction,
height and point of possible interception is calculated
by the computor and is displayed on the console screens.
The ﬁnal decision, however, rests with the battle com-
mander. He must decide what form of action he wishes
to take. The press of another button sends a ﬁghter in-
terceptor or missile on its way to destroy the hostile
force.

Two electronic computers are in operation 24 hours
a day at a direction center. Each receives and stores
information simultaneously, one backing up the other
in case of failure or periodic shutdown for maintenance.
Even though only one computer is engaged in active
air defense, the other unit continues to operate, check-
ing on the computations of the active unit, ready to
take over with a minimum amount of delay if needed.

Each computer contains over 58,000 electronic
tubes, generating enough heat to comfortably warm
45 homes at 20 degrees below zero. Each tube is in-
dividually air conditioned. Three 400-ton air condi-
tioning units are available to maintain a constant
temperature and humidity for the electronic equip-

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

ment installed throughout the building. The tempera-
tures of the building is extremely critical for the effici-
ent operation of the electronic gear. The normal temp-
erature of the SAGE building is maintained at approxi-
mately 72 degrees. If the air conditioning should fail
the temperature would climb to 150 degrees within a.
matter of two minutes.

The electronic tubes are installed in the computer
in pluggable units. Instead of removing one tube at a
time to check for trouble, a complete rack of eight
or ten is pulled out and another unit immediately in-
serted. The faulty components or tubes can then be
taken to the maintenance area for check-out and re-
pair. The wiring between the direction center and other
agencies is a duplex arrangement having alternate
routing on all circuits.

The SAGE Direction Center is housed in a window-
less, 4-story building built of blast-resistant reinforced
concrete. The outside walls are six feet thick and the
interior partioning walls are twelve inches thick. The
electronic power needed to satisfy the demands of the
electronic equipment within the building is suﬂicient to
provide the needs for a community of 13,000 people.
Four 1250 KW diesel generators are available for power.
Only two are used, however, under normal load con-
ditions. The third diesel is in a standby condition while
the fourth is shut down for maintenance.

Eighty-ﬁve maintenance men using 99 volumes of
operational and maintenance instructions keep the di-
rection center running 24 hours a day. A special main-
tenance control room monitors the actions of the com-
puters and electronic equipment. By referring to a
schematic panel or by monitoring a panel of flashing
neon lights, maintenance men are able to instantly
track down any trouble that might develop. Mainten-
ance men are even able to forecast the failure of a
component by comparing the known voltage of various
circuits with those voltages being registered. Thus, a
component can be replaced even before it fails.

An interesting fact pointed out by the men in the
maintenance room is the ability of the machine to

diagnose its own troubles. If some part of the machine
should fail this is made known on a large electric
typewriter which sounds an alarm and then proceeds to
spell out not only the code number of the part that
has failed, but its exact location in the building, what
spare part is needed to replace it, and where that part
is stored!

Step-by-step automatic telephone dial systems, in-
tricate key arrangements and a two-position manual
switchboard have been installed. The installation of
this whole system required 320,000 connections and
3,000,000 feet of cross-connecting wire. These facilities
alone are sufficient to serve a city of 40,000 people.
Power for the telephone system is supplied from large
storage batteries which recharged by a 48-volt genera-
tor run by diesel power.

Even in the event of a complete power failure, the
batteries would continue to operate and service can
be continued for eight hours at full load or 24- hours at
normal load.

A SAGE Direction Center is often referred to as
the “house of blue lights.” In many of the rooins where
the display consoles are located, blue ﬁlter lamps con-
trolled by dimmers give the place an eerie look but
contribute toward reduced operator fatigue and higher
operational efficiency. Special accoustical treatment is
given to the wall and ﬂoor ﬁnishes within the center
to cut down on noise.

The dollar investment in SAGE is difﬁcult to com-
putebut we know that it is high. The building at.
McGuire alone cost some $5 million dollars and the
equipment contained inside is worth another $25 mil-
lion, and this is only one unit of "many.

It has been estimated that the annual maintenance
and operational costs for the whole complex may reach
$500 million dollars annually. Most thinking Americans
will gladly help to pay the bill though when they real-
ize that SAGE is a type of LIFE Insurance.'Even
though the premium costs are admittedly high it is the
only insurance from which we may expect to receive
“living” beneﬁts instead of death beneﬁts. I

You only know a mill when you see its heart, the blast
furnace and the rolling mills. These are the parts of the
mill that are worthy of inspection—worthy of a tour.

Your tour of one of these industrial marvels need
not be all awe and seriousness. It will be pleasant and
informative. Especially when you have two very at-
tractive girls to accompany you throughout the entire
trip. Marion Simpson and Diane McCrillis, your trav-
eling companiions, have already been ﬁtted for their
hard hats and are on their way to one of the open
hearth buildings at U. S. Steel’s Homestead Works.

As you enter the building you are immediately
aware of the intense heat of the furnace and the rum-
bling of an immense overhead crane. A crew of men
are preparing to tap the Number Five Open Hearth.

STEEL MILL

You see a small dynamite charge blast the pouring
spout clear allowing the molten steel to splatter into a
waiting collecting ladle. You also visit the main con-
trol panel which scrutinizes and guides all fueling pro-
cesses carried out during the preparation of the steel.

The rolling mill will be the next stop, and requires
a short ride by car. Again as you enter the rolling mill
you are aware of the intense heat needed in steel mak-
ing. This time the heat comes from ovens that bake
cooled ingots back to the red hot state in preparation
for the long trip through the rolling mill. You watch
an ingot enter as a stubby rectangular block. It is
pounded, squeezed, turned and rolled. At last you see
it emerge as a long, thin slab which is then cooled and
stored for later use.

That just about completes ‘our tour, but if you
would like to visit U. S. Steel’s Homestead Works first
hand, contact the Public Relations, Department in the
U. S. Steel Building. The Company offers weekly tours
for the public.

And now for our tour . . . .

Your life may he saved tomorrow by today’s crash-impact research.

TO SAVE

A LIFE

THE TREMENDOUS lMP'ACT on the dummy correspond-
ing to a six-year old child gives evidence to the necessity
of crash-impact study.

What would happen to you if you were to experi-
ence a head on collision? The resultant tragedy is
apparent, but the actual mechanism of disaster is a
problem which has only recently been understood.
Through a study of kinematics the complex forces
during an auto crash are serving as a guide toward
the incorporation of safety into the design of today’s
automobiles.

When an automobile stops suddenly as in a head on
collision, its velocity rapidly changes to zero. The oc-
cupants of the car may experience two different types
of deceleration. These are the decelerations experienced
by the unrestrained (free body) occupant and the
restrained (held by arresting harness of some kind) oc-
cupant. One is very different from the other, and
both require some explanation.

D.uring a head on collision, the unrestrained human
continues forward until his flight is suddenly stopped
by impact. This impact is a hammerlike blow where
the duration of the arresting force has been measured
in microseconds and the distance in fraction of inches.

The action is quite different when the body is at-
tached to the vehicle by an arresting harness of some
kind such as today’s seat belts. In this case, the body
slows down at the same time the vehicle starts losing
velocity. The stopping time is much longer and the
distance can be measured in feet instead of inches.
The forces on the body are, therefore, greatly reduc-
ed and, at the same time, the motion path taken by
the body or its parts is under control by the arresting
gear.

The Cornell Aeronautical Laboratories has con-
ducted an engineering analysis of the kinematics of
the human body under crash conditions. The human

body was considered as a complex linkage mechanism
with all link bars pivoted at the joints. All links, except
the spinal column, were considered as rigid bars from
joint to joint. The back bar was considered as a
flexible member the stiffness of which was made pro-
portional to the measured stiffness furnished by the
tense back muscles of laboratory volunteers.

The motion of a compound figure is affected by
its weight and the moment of inertia of each of its
connecting parts. The first studies were carried out
using a full-scale proportionally weighted dummy called
“Thin Man.” This dummy was designed to ride in a
horizontal cockpit accelerated along a track on the
laboratory floor by elastic shock cords. Time-spacial
recordings were made on graph paper below the dum-
my through special instruments. Plotted data of some
of the deceleration runs were made with loose joints to
represent minimum muscle restraint. All tests were
performed at 1.8g deceleration——about three times that
of frantic bracking. These tests were made in 1948
primarily for the study of the effect of lap-type belts
on body motions and the relative effects of head blows
with and without lap harness.

When the cockpit was subjected to a linear accel-
eration of 1.8g and no seat belt was used, the head
struck a point 27 inches forward of the head and
five inches higher at a velocity of 16 feet per second

atory were made dynamatically similar to man's counter-
parts.

and hit with an impact of 1,000 inch-pounds (600
inch-pounds is approximately skull fracture level
against a hard flat surface).

When a seat belt was used at a 30 degree angle
from the verticle and arbitrarily tightened to allow
four and two inches movement, the striking velocities
were 15 and 17 feet per second respectively. The
energies of the head blows, however, were reduced to
380 and 240 inch-pounds respectively; an average re-
duction of approximately 70%.

The tests so far have involved only linear trans-
lation of the body. The motion of the human body
during an automobile crash is very likely to contain
a rotational as well as a linear component. In order
to gather further information about this phenomenon
the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratories, in a project in
1953 sponsored by the Liberty Mutual Insurance Com-
pany of Boston, made a study of the action of ‘the
human body during automobile crashes. Again, full-
scale proportionally weighted articulated dummies, one
representing an adult and the other a six-year old
child, were used in a 1950 two-door sedan. The car
would run down a 200 foot track under its own power
and then suddenly be stopped to simulate a head on
collision. The motions of the dummies as they moved
through the car were photographed through a trans-
parent grid. Then the motion picture record was re-
duced frame by frame to give information as to the

22

flight path, hit locations, attitude of the body and
timing.

The performance of a six-year old child in the
front seat (unrestrained) showed almost pure linear
translation until the lower part of the body was ar-
rested when the knees and feet came in contact with
the car. Then there was a rotation about the hips until
the head struck something—usually the windshield.
When a seat belt was used, no blow was experienced
at all. The total action took place in less than one-half
second although the velocity of the car was only 17
mph. When the child (undestrained) was placed in the
seat behind the driver, the driver received the typical
head and chest blows in approximately .22 seconds
after the car ‘stopped plus an additional blow in the
back of the neck from the head of the displaced child.

The attitude of the body at the time it made
contact with the forward structures and the angle of
the flight path with the contact surface were deter-
mined from high-speed motion pictures. Both, the at-
titude and the angle determine the injury potential
of the blow. In order to learn more about the effect
of attitude and barricade angle on the severity of head
blows, the “Thin Man” was mounted on a board to
duplicate the observed impact attitude. When the
supporting pins were rapidly withdrawn, the dummy
would fall free and hit an impact energy meter pre-
viously set at various angles. The attitudes ranged from
a swan dive to a sitting position.

This observed information can be used in design-
ing the interior of automobiles to reduce head injuries.
The data on front end collisions showed that the head
hit 30 degrees down in a vertical plane. If this zone
were designed free of objects having high energy
potential and offered a maximum angle of 60 degrees
to the flight path, the energy blows to the head would
be reduced 50% or more. If a body in a car is assum-
ed to weigh about 200 lbs. and the distance between
the head and an object in the car is shorter than the
distance in which the car stopped in a head on col-
lision, only a 60 inch-pound blow would be required
by a sharp 90 degree corner to fracture the skull

THE PRODUCT of crash-impact research is the Cornell-
Liberty Safety Car into which are incorporated the most
recent safety features.

whereas the necessary blow to the head from a hard
flat surface would be 60.0 inch-pounds.

What is being done to reduce the potentiality and
seriousness of injuries during a collision? In 1955, a
safety car was designed by Cornell Aeronautical Labo-
ratories and Liberty Mutual. Six basic steps of crash
protection were followed; the first four being used in
the daily packaging of delicate objects. These steps
were (1) use a strong shipping case, (2) fasten lid
securely, (3) pack tightly, (4-) remove all hard objects
from padding, (5) improve driver’s working environ-
ment by increasing visibility, simplifying controls and
instruments and lowering the carbon monoxide of the
breathing atmosphere, and (6) remove dangerous
objects from the exterior to increase the safety of
pedestrians.

The exterior of the Cornell-Liberty Safety Car
differs little from the average four door sedan. Plastic
foam material is placed between the wrap-around front
and rear bumpers to absorb shock. The bumpers are
smoothly shaped to cause glancing instead of direct
blows. The car has “accordion” doors that are securely
closed by three bolt bars to add to the structural
strength and to keep the doors closed during a collision.

Two roll-over bars are used, one over the front
passengers and the other over the rear passengers.
Bucket seats are used because they give better lateral
support to the hips during a crash. The driver is
placed in the front center where there is more car
body between him and the crash contact points and
the other two front seats are on either side of the
driver, slightly to the rear and lower so as not to in-
terfere with the driver’s vision or arm movements.
These two seats slide back and forth on tracks for easy
entrance and exit.

Two foreward facing rear seats are placed inside
the rear wheel wells but not directly behind the front
seats so that the rear passenger will not strike the
front passenger. One rearward facing seat is placed
behind the driver. This seating arrangement not only
is safer but allows for better conversation. All pas-
sengers are securely held by seat belts so that they

do not become flying missiles. The driver is restrained
by a curved control panel which rocks into position
and locks there. The front seat riders are similarly re-
strained by body restraining panels that serve as tables
or arm rests. The occupants are protected from “whip-
lash,” which occurs when the head is snapped back
due to a rear end collision, by a pull up headrest for
the driver and nylon harnesses for the passengers.

Knobs, projections, sharp edges and hard surfaces
are absent to a great extent and the ceiling is shaped
to produce only glancing blows to the head. The back
shelf is lowered considerably to keep any objects on it
from becoming misguided missiles. A strong metal
bulkhead is placed between the trunk and passenger
compartments to keep any heavy objects in the trunk
from flying through and injuring someone. A guidance
device instead of a steering wheel and column is used.
The steering is supplied by hydraulic pressure and no
great motion is required for a complete turn of the
wheels. Much experimentation is being done on this
steering system, at present, and it may well be the
method used for steering cars in the future.

All control buttons are flush with the panel and
in easy reach. The conventional brake and accelerator
are on the floor. The instruments are out of range
of the driver’s head and just below his line of vision.
If any malfunction occurs, a small bulb on the panel
just below the line of sight will light. In this way, the
driver’s attention need not be taken off the road as
much as usual. The windshield allows 180 degrees of
clear undistorted vision and almost all of it and the
rear window can be kept clear during a storm.

Serious injuries can occur and often do during an
automobile collision even through the cars do not have
to be traveling at great speeds. This car has, in all
probability, the maximum in safety features combined
with average styling. There is one safety precaution,
however, that cannot be incorporated in a car and
that is the alertness of the driver. I

DEVELOPMENT CENTER . . .

Another Unmatched Engineering Facility to
Advance Propulsion Systems of the Future

Future aircraft and missiles may require propulsion
systems far different from those in wide use today
— different in size, power output, appearance, and
perhaps even in the basic method of utilizing energy.

To probe the propulsion future . . . and to build
and test greatly advanced propulsion systems for
coming generations of ﬂight vehicles, Pratt &
Whitney Aircraft is now operating its new Florida
Research and Development Center. This facility
supplements Pratt & Whitney’s main research and
development installations in Connecticut.

The new Florida Center, ﬁnanced and built by
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, is unique in America’s
air industry. Here a completely air-conditioned
plant with 17 acres under roof is specially designed
and equipped for the development of new power

 

plants of virtually any type. Testing is handled in
special isolated areas; the nearest is four miles
from the plant and many miles from any inhabited
area. The new Center can be greatly expanded on
its 10-square-mile site. Continued isolation is in-
sured by a vast wildlife sanctuary in which the
Center is located. '

Of the many people employed at the Center to-
day, about half are scientists, engineers and highly
trained technicians. By late next year, the total
number is expected to be almost doubled.

The new Florida Research and Development
Center is one more reason why Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft is able to continue producing the world’s
best aircraft propulsion systems . . . in Whatever
form they take.

the '59 Graduate
go?  

Industry's demand for capable graduates in the ﬁelds of science and
engineering is still exceeding the supply produced by American colleges
and universities. As a result, the most promising members of this year's
class may well wind up with a number of openings to consider.

In such circumstances, who would blame a bright young man for at
least letting the phrase “eeny, meeny, miny, mo" slip through his mind!

Of course, there is one inescapable conclusion -to be considered: open-

ings are one thing, genuine opportunities quite another. Thoughtful

examination of such factors as potential growth, challenge, advance-
ment policy, facilities, degree of self-direction, permanence, and
benefits often indicates that real opportunity does not yet grow

on trees.

Moreover, the great majority of personal success stories are
still being written by those who win positions with the
most successful companies.

A SEARCH ‘TO UNDERSTAND

  ndeiing heard, no. 1

BY S. R. WEATHERFORD

It is my belief that as a person matures, he learns
to question many of the ideas and concepts he has
been told are true, in his formative years. He has
been given a set of truths or laws in his youth that
more and more frequently he finds being broken and
distorted by the people he now lives among. Too many
people, when they ﬁnd out that much of what they
believe is not consistent or not true, openly rebel against
all society. Thus we have atheiests, criminals’, Bohe-
mians and by those who can’t accept the refutiation,
mental illnesses and sometimes even suicides.‘ I don’t
think that this happens to all men, because many are
satisﬁed with their laws no matter how contradictory,
and there are those who never notice the conflict be-
cause they live for the most part within themselves,
little effected by the world around them. Many others
are completely satisﬁed with their way of living and
never stop to think that anything could be different.
They are pleasantly satisﬁed with their newspapers’
editorials, their TV entertainment, and ﬁnd it too
much effort to think about any basic relation between
themselves and society other than that they are govern-
ed by society’s laws. There are others who stop and
begin a re—evaluation of “truth” to ﬁnd and /or prove to
themselves what is true.

I reached a point some years ago where I found
that I was not satisﬁed with much of what I read in
newspapers and newsmagazines; many of the attitudes
of the people around me and much of what I had been
instructed was true, or good, or bad. Slowly, through
reasoning, through bull sessions with others of different
beliefs, through reading the ideas of others, I began a
search to understand. A search to understand religion,
and life, my place in our world and many other things.
It wasn’t a concious search but now that I think of
it, I know that it has been going on for some time.

On religion: If we were to boil the religions of the
world down to their essence, I think that perhaps the
greatest similarity that we would ﬁnd among them is
that they each propogate a set of rules or laws for
their peoples to live in peace within their own society.
Man, being a very credulous creature, eager to achieve
some way by which he assumed stature in a world of
contradictions, hunting some means of mitigating his
fear of the unknown, death, readily accepted any sup-
ernatural reason if a means was offered by which he
was linked to the creator of the contradictions. In
accepting the concept of an all powerful Diety he also
bought, in the package deal, the set of laws too. Thus,
the tribes found a means of keeping their people
obedient and of tying them together, by capitalizing
on man’s individual fear of the unknown and his
desire for reassurance that he would be protected.
From these beginnings, in a very general sense, religions
grew. Some ﬂourished and continued, others died. New
ones came into being. For the sake of argument, let’s
say that most religions are monotheistic and that all
contain the basic set of laws mentioned before. There-
fore, why and how can we say that any one religion

OCTOBER 1958

is more correct than another. How can Judaism be
any more correct than Hinduism, Catholicism any
more “right” than Taoism? For what reason do we
have busy little missionaries scurrying into the back-
ward places of the world converting “heathens” into
good Christians? The humanitarian aspect of missions
I agree with but the sacred indoctrination is infring-
ing a little bit on others rights, I believe.

I don’t consider myself a Christian, nor a Jew, nor
Moslem, nor belonging to any speciﬁc religion that I
know of. I have arrived at my belief myself, and I
believe that a religion should be a personal philosophy,
one that is individually thought through and weighed
for its application to the individual life. It is difficult
to believe that a religion should ﬁt all men the same
way that a suit of clothes should be expected to ﬁt
all men.

I believe that there is a God, an Absolute Power,
whatever you may wish to call It. I believe that this
Force has created our universe and has given rather
indiscriminately the wonder of life to our world and
probably to many other worlds in various other solar
systems, in our galaxy and in others, throughout our
ﬁnite universe. Having done this It has gone about It’s
business somewhere else either within our universe or
beyond. To me the idea that this God is unique to us, or
that He is concerned one bit about what happens here,
on Earth, is unacceptable. Why .should He be? What
have we accomplished to be worthy of this inﬁnite
God’s attention? Is it our ability to wipe out whole
populations of other people with nuclear weapons?
Is it our unconcerned attitude about how we contam-
inate our earth with radioactivity? A contamination
that is capable of producing mutations of generations
to be born 2,500 years from now. Exactly what have
we done? Is it our ability to persecute Jews, or at the
least to ridicule them? Or is it the ease with which we
use the term and attitude, Nigger,‘ and silently restrict
them from our neighborhoods, better restaurants, and
schools? How easy it is to ridicule those which are
different from us. How much easier than trying to learn
about them, and trying to understand them.

I feel that after we have been created, it is up to us
to do with our world and ourselves what we may.
It is up to us, humanity, to create for ourselves a real

STRAIGHT TALK TO ENGINEERS

from Donald W. Douglas, r.

President, Douglas Aircraft Company

I’m sure you’ve heard about Douglas projects like
Thor, N ike—Ajax, Nike—Hercules, Nike-Zeus,
Honest John, Genie and Sparrow. While these
are among the most important defense programs
in our nation today, future planning is moving
into even more stimulating areas.

Working as we are on the problems of space
ﬂight and at the very borderline of the unknown,
engineering excellence in all ﬁelds is essential.

For you engineers who can help us move forward,
opportunities are almost as limitless as space
itself.

If you thrive on tough problems—— and there
are many—we’d like to discuss a future at
Douglas with you.

DC AMPLIFIERS

A rather important development in the improve-
ment of analog computers has been the concept of
stabilizing a DC operational amplifier against drift by
using an AC amplifier in a special manner. This con-
cept was first introduced in 1950 by E. A. Goldberg
of RCA laboratories.

Operational amplifiers are of two types: namely
AC and DC. The AC amplifiers, since having certain
difficulties in use, are superseded by the DC type
amplifier. This does not imply that the early type DC
amplifiers did not have much to be desired. It was
common for the earlier DC amplifiers to drift, that is,
the output does not necessarily remain steady and in
particular does not remain zero for zero input. This
characteristic was most undesirable since it made things
difficult to set up, not to mention the need for con-
stant maintenance, as well as the embarrassment of
inaccurate answers. There are several contributory
causes, including aging and changes of temperature
in tubes and components, and changes in the high-
tension and heater supply voltages. These effects can
be minimized by the use of high quality components,
suitable choice of tubes and operating conditions,
careful circuit design, and stabilization of supply
voltages, and for some purposes satisfactory perfor-
mance can be achieved by these means; but for highest
accuracy additional devices for reducing drift have
been devised. An example of such a device, as mention-
ed earlier, is the AC amplifier.

Since the DC operational amplifier is a funda-
mental unit of the analog computer itself, it might
be worthwhile to examine a few of its basic operations.

. To begin with, consider a high gain amplifier with a.

voltage gain of -A connected with the input and feed-
back impedances Zi and Zf as illustratedin Figure 1.

amplifier (usually called the “summing point”), the

Since output voltage is related to grid voltage by

The two equations can be combined to give the
following relation:

This can be easily simplified since the amplifier is

designed to have a very high gain, usually in the

range 0 to , an a very high input impedance
such that 1/A and ig become negligible. Upon simpli-
fication, the previous expression becomes

_ This can even be simplified a little more if both
input and feedback impedances were to be resistors.

a negative constant. "L

The resulting output is, therefore, the negative of
the sum of the input voltages, each multiplied by some
constant depending upon the ratio of the resistors
involved.

Since integrating circuits are those chiefly affect-
ed by drift, it would seem obvious that immediate
attention should be given to this general area of
aperation. Integration of an input voltage is achieved
if a capacitor is substituted as the feedback component
as in Figure 3.

Introduction of the capacitor will make the feed-
back impedance equal 1/Cp in which case p is the
differential operator and the output expression then
becomes

The inputs again may be combined, as previously
illustrated with resistors, to generate the integral of
a sum of voltages. As an obvious deduction, one might
immediately conclude that differentiation can now be
obtained by simply rearranging the positions of the
capacitor and resistor. Theoretically this is sound, but
in practice this arrangement has lent itself to unde-
sirable noise and therefore is not recommended practice.
With these fundamental functions in mind, it is now
possible to investigate the workings of the AC ampli-
fier and how it performs its task of regulating the
DC amplifier against drift. It does so automatically

syncronous vibrator

FIGURE 4. Automatic balancing circuit

with the aid of a synchronous vibrator and two 6SJ7
type pentode amplifiers. To illustrate this effect
qualitatively, refer now to Figure 4:.

Assume that a drift voltage, which for the sake of
demonstration will be called positive, is entered at
the input. This voltage is applied through resistor
R to contact 1 on synchronous vibrator EL. The vibra-
tor is driven by an external unit at the rate of 94
cps. The two contacts then will serve to change the
input voltage into a rectangular wave by alternately
grounding the input through each contact. This signal,
in turn, is conducted to the input of the two-stage
amplifier via capacitor C. The output voltage is then
amplified by V5 and V6. The output of the AC ampli-
fier is demodulated in another pair of contacts coupled
to the input contacts to give a DC voltage which
would be negative in this case. This negative pulsating
DC signal is then filtered via the filter network, where-
_upon it is applied to the grid of the second half of
V1. This half acts as a cathode-follower, wherein
its output is applied to the cathode of the first half
of V1. So in essence then, the same effect occurs as
if the grid by comparison were to be made more posi-
tive with respect to the cathode. This positive voltage
is then inverted by amplifier action, yielding a negative
voltage at the output. The negative voltage is applied
through the feedback element to the summing point
at the input of the amplifier. Here the negative voltage
cancels, or reduces to a large extent, the original
drift voltage. The drift voltage is reduced to approxi-
mately 1/A of what it would be without the stabilizing
amplifier. The operation of the automatic balancing
circuit provides continuous balancing of the amplifier
by continually reducing the effective drift voltage.
Other methods of drift correction, of course have been
devised aside from that mentioned here, while still
better ones are being sought. I

It is Western Electric’s job in the Bell System to manufacture some 65,000 different
parts which are assembled into a vast variety of telephone apparatus and equipment.
This job, coupled with our other responsibilities as part of the System, requires the
assistance of engineers in every ﬁeld.

Their skills and talents are needed to develop new manufacturing techniques, solve
quality control problems, determine machine and tool requirements, devise testing
facilities and methods. They work on new applications for metals and alloys, calculate
raw material needs, seek manufacturing cost reductions.

In helping meet the Bell System’s need for more and better telephone equipment,
Western Electric engineers have assignments in the other areas of our job—installation,
distribution and purchasing.

Our engineers are also deeply involved in defense projects entrusted to us by the
government. Because of our specialized experience as part of the Bell System we are
well equipped to handle the job. Among these projects: the Nike guided missile system
and the White Alice communications network in Alaska.

Of course, Western Electric engineers are encouraged and assisted in developing
professionally. . . in expanding their technical know-how. Company—sponsored pro-
grams —like the full-time Graduate Engineering Training Program and the Tuition
Refund Plan—help them along.

Promotion from within—a Western Electric policy—helps many of our engineers
move into positions of prime responsibility. Today, 55% of the college graduates in our
upper levels of management have engineering degrees. In
the next ten years, 7,000 key jobs must be ﬁlled by newly
promoted peop1e—engineers included.

Western Electric technical ﬁelds include mechanical,
electrical, chemical and civil engineering, plus the physi-
cal sciences. For more information pick up a copy of’

Halfway up the Hill

WHAT

Last month twenty-eight engineering students as-
sembled in a classroom to begin another year of what
every school retains as a matter of unquestioned
routine. What is said, discussed, and eventually decid-
ed upon may range from purchasing a new blotter
for an office desk or to setting a date for the Fall
Dance. Either motion will probably go unnoticed by
those not directly involved in the discussion. This is
student government.

At Pitt the Student Government Association (SGA)
is the undergraduate governing body. Each school
has or will have its own minor ruling group. The first

Some revenue is obtained from the various vending
machines in the student lounge.

and perhaps most unique of these groups is the En-
gineering and Mines Cabinet which legislates by and.
for the students of the Schools of Engineering and
Mines.

E & M Cabinet was in existence long before the
actual conception of the separate governing bodies,
and has taken a sense of pride in that it has served
as a model for -other undergraduate schools at Pitt.
It is unique because it has the money and administra-
tive cooperation to wield rather weighty decisions.

Dr. G. R. Fitterer, Dean of the Schools of En-
gineering and Mines, gives impetus to the Cabinet’s
power by backing up its decisions and carefully con-

36

sidering its recommendations. A good example is the
student lounge located on the first floor of Engineering
Hall. With classroom and laboratory space at a premi-
um the Cabinet still maintains control of the lounge.
Engineers’ Week which Cabinet sponsors is also il-
lustrative of administrative cooperation.

Cabinet receives no financial aid from the Uni-
versity Student Activities fee. Its main source of in-
come is from the sale of membership cards in the
E & M Association and from revenue from the vend-
ing machines in the student lounge. Rarely is any
money made through the Cabinet sponsored dances
held twice yearly. Although reproached many times
by students for hoarding a large bank account (some-
times $2000), it is to the Cabinet’s credit that this
money is spent wisely and to the advantage of the
entire student body.

During the past year Cabinet’s expenditures in-
cluded such items as membership cards which admit
the student to various social events, parts for the high
fidelity set in the lounge, payment to janitors for
lounge cleanup, and the many expenses involved in
arranging social events.

The eight engineering departments and the Aero-
nautical option each have four Cabinet members rep-
resenting the four classes. SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER
also has one representative. When the new fresh-
men class elects its representatives, total enrollment in

Weekly meetings keep current problems alive and provide

Cabinet will be thirty-seven. Weekly meetings keep
current problems alive and provide an efficient method
of disposing of ‘routine matters.

Planning of the meeting is done by a seven-man
Executive Committee. Presided over by the President,
the Cabinet’s officers include the Vice President, Re-
cording and Corresponding Secretaries, Treasurer, and
Coordinators of Standing and Special Committees.
Committee chairmanships are handled by the members
of Cabinet and by students not directly associated

with Cabinet. These committees perform a wide
variety of services for the Pitt engineer (see box).

One problem, which is the bane of Cabinet as well

as other student governing bodies, is recognition by
the general student body. Too often the only ones
interested in Cabinet’s proceedings are the members
themselves. If more interest could be generated in the
working of Cabinet, there would be more discussion
pro and con regarding the random motions proposed
by the representatives. I

As in all organizations, work is subdivided into oom-
mittees. Cabinet is no exception with its twelve ‘commit-
tees, and the SK YSCRAPER offers its own summary
of each committee’s work. Some are only opinions;

others are suggestions for an improved and eﬁicient
Cabinet for the present year.

SOCIAL

Chairman: Nino Barsotti _ o _
The social committee organizes the fall and spring

dances and other social events throughout the year.
Participation from the student body is very good at
the dances, but other affairs arouse little interest.

ENGINEERS’ WEEK
Chairman: Russell C. Max_we1l, Ir.‘ . _
Engineers’ Week 1S traditionally a week of intel-

lectual, creative, and social pursuits. Interest in the
Week has been waning in the past few years, and it
will take a great deal of effort from this year’s com-
mittee to revitalize the student body’s efforts.

EMITT
Chairman: Donald H. Vernau _
EMITT (Engineering and Mines Travel and

Training) is one of the most worthwhile of Cabinet’s
ventures. It is the first such program of its kind in
the United States. This past summer three students
were sent abroad to represent Pitt’s engineering school.
ATHLETIC

Co-Chairman: Iohn Costa and Sam Hazou ' _
Participation in the athletic program is steadily

increasing clue to an improved method of communica-
tion with the individual departments. This ‘is perhaps
the Cabinet’s closest association with a majority of
students.

E & M BULLETIN

Editor: Nelson R. Tonet .
A reevaluation of the Bulletin’s 0b_]CCt1V6S is neces-

sary to discontinue the sporadic outpour of announce-
ments and general information. Better cooperation
must be given by the students in order that they, in
turn, may benefit by this worthy effort which up to
now has gone unnoticed.

F RESHMAN INTEREST

Chairman: Richard L. DeN'ezza.

kAlthough only incoming freshman benefit from

this rather routine committee, interest in school activi-
ties is usually begun through a freshman’s contact
with a program arranged by this committee.

FINANCE

Chairman: Edward F. Reste-lli. Ir.
Chairmaned by the Cabinet’s Treasurer, this new

committee prepares the Cabinet’s annual budget and
allocates funds to the other committees.

PUBLICITY

Chairman: Ken. Rothert

Little publicity concerning the Cabinet’s activities
outside of the Engineering School is a problem which
needs certain revisions. An example of this is last year’s
visit of rocketeer Willie Ley for which little publicity
was distributed by cabinet and the program was one
of the University’s best attended programs in the series.

LOCKER

Chairman: Robert C. Stump

The free registration of all lockers in Engineering
and State Halls requires a great deal of time and
patience. A new system, needs to be substituted to
eliminate the tedious hours of bookkeeping involved.
STUDENT FACULTY RELATIONS

Ambitious past efforts to establish a worthwhile
contact between the students and faculty have been
ignored, to a great extent, by both principals. Any
accomplishments by this committee can be considered
worthwhile.
COORDINATION OF SOCIETIES

Co-Chairmen: Emil Steinhardt and Henry I. Zadell
This committee has the Herculean task of co-

ordinating the meetings and social events of the
honorary and professional societies. Groundwork has
been laid for this committee, and once functioning, it
can be of great service to students. This would eliminate
overlapping of meetings and conflicting of social events.

RELIGION AND CULTURE

Co-Chairmen: Richard Van Maldeghem and Dan Bolger
Although Cabinet is represented on the Student

Chapel Board, little attention is paid the fact by
students. A good project for this committee would
be the arrangement of chapel services for engineers.
Once accomplished, the next and much greater probl
would be getting the engineers to attend.

ASSEMBLY LINE SATELLITES

Pitt’s ROTC students will soon see Explorer I, the
nation’s ﬁrst successfully-launched satellite, through
models built for the Army by Ivel Construction Corpor-
ation, Brooklyn.

The Ivel ﬁrm has just completed construction of
some 300 plastic models of Explorer I under contract
to the Defense Supply Service. This contract is the
ﬁrst direct appropriation for acquainting ROTC stu-
dents with missiles and missile technology by means
of scale models. '

Each model measures just under seven feet in
length, with a diameter of nearly 61/2 inches, while
the actual Explorer satellite is 79 inches long. Models
are equipped with a supporting base designed to raise
units off the floor at a 5-foot height. Flexibility in posi-
tioning is achieved through a special-developed knuckle
joint assembly.

MODELS OF EXPLORER I will be seen in 300 college
ROTC departments this semester. They were manufactur-
ed to acquaint ROTC students with the latest missile
technology.

ELECTRONIC REFRIGERATION

Electronic refrigeration, up to now a laboratory
curiosity, has moved into the realm of practicality. To
illustrate the principle—refrigeration using no mov-
ing parts——Westinghouse has demonstrated a device
that can automatically cool or heat a baby’s bottle,
and a mobile hostess cart with both refrigeration and
oven compartments.

The devices demonstrated by Westinghouse are a
practical application of the cooling principle ﬁrst dis-
covered by the Frenchman, Peltier, in 1834. The prin-
ciple simply states that a current passed through the
junction of two dissimilar metals will produce a cool-
ing effect in the junction. When the current is revers-
ed, the junction exhibits a heating effect.

Scientists have applied the principle in junctions
of semiconductor materials to produce practical and
eﬂicient cooling. Conventional cooling techniques re-
quire apparatus such as compressors, motors and cool-
ing mechanisms since it does the job without the form-
erly necessary equipment. To illustrate this space sav-
ing a present-day 10-cubic-foot refrigerator converted
to electronic operation would yield 11.5 to 12 cubic feet
of usable internal space.

CARBON SANDWICH

A revolutionary concept in battery design has pro-
duced a new power source for transistor radios with
up to 67% longer life. The new “cathodic envelope”
technique is being employed in the manufacture of a
new “Eveready” energizer announced by National Car-
bon Company, Division of Union Carbide Corporation.

The additional service from the new battery stems
from the greater amount of energy-prod-ucing materi-
als that can be packed into a given volume. Rather
than using laminated construction of zinc anode plates
and cathode cakes, as in previous radio battery types,
the cathodic envelope construction surrounds the anode
with the cathode material, making use of all of the
active materials in a given cell volume. A flexible cath-
ode collector ﬁlm electrically connects the two cathode
cakes between which the anode is located in “sand-
wich” fashion.

START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW

By knowing about some of the projects underway at the
Babcock & Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his
personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.

Here's an indication of what’s going on at B&W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world’s
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the first refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the ABC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world’s first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel. '

These are but a few of the projects——not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases —- upon which B&W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.

How is the company doing right now? Let’s look at one
line from the Annual Stockholders’ Report.

Vought offers this range
to the young engineer

At Chance Vought the engineer's assign-
ments range from the depths of the ocean to
the farthest reaches of space . . . from hard-
ware operating aboard the Navy’s nuclear-
armed submarines to space research vehicles
still on the boards.

Here the engineer contributes to projects
such as the record-smashing Crusader jet
fighter series . . . the Regulus missiles . . .
and advanced weapons, details of which are
still classiﬁed.

Under the guidance of the Vought engi-
neer, such weapons take shape. He super-
vises critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.

Engineers with many specialties share these
experiences. Today, for example, Vought is
at work on important projects involving:

SPACECRAFT AND ASTRONAUTICS
AnvANcEn PROPULSION METHODS
ELECTRONICS DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE
ANTISUBMARINE WARFARE

Vought’s excellent R&D facilities help the
engineer through unexplored areas. And by
teaming up with other specialists against
mutual challenges, the Vought engineer
learns new ﬁelds while advancing in his own.

THE MAN* WITH KOPPERS

“. . . versatility recognized”

*Arthur Herman graduated from Johns Hopkins
in 1955 and went to work immediately in the Metal
Products Division of Koppers as a Design Engineer.

In December of the same year, he was promoted
to Supervising Engineer of the Design Section,
where he found that Koppers offers truly challeng-
ing problems in design engineering.

Then, in September 1957, Art was transferred
to the Coupling Sales Department as a Coupling
Application Engineer. He is serving in that
capacity now.

An employment record alone is seldom descrip-
tive of the opportunities and responsibilities many
positions represent. For instance, Art was recently
designated as Division Representative to investi-
gate the potentialities of a new product developed
by a European manufacturer. This assignment
took him abroad.

Art is particularly articulate about his job and
the constant challenge it presents for him as an
individual.

“When I ﬁrst started as a design engineer,” he
said, “I didn’t realize the scope of activities in

OCTOBER 1958

 

which I’d be called on to participate. Sure, I had
good theory and background for design engineering,
but I had little concept of the problems of produc-
tion, and even less familiarity with the techniques
of sales or marketing. My work as an application
engineer gets me into almost every phase of the
business — development, production, marketing,
ﬁnance, and so forth.

“At Koppers I feel that I receive the necessary
guidance to enable me to contribute fully to the
Company’s activities. I am encouraged to make
decisions. If these decisions involve factors with
which I am not entirely familiar, I can rely on the
judgment and experience of others working with
me. At all times, I feel that I have real access to
upper levels of management where my ideas have
always been received thoughtfully and given full
consideration. Now, I feel confident that I am
doing a job for Koppers, and, what is equally
important, that my associates and supervisors
understand and appreciate it, too! I have found
that through such methods as the Management
Appraisal Program, Koppers makes every effort
to recognize and reward good performance.”

A lot of things could be said about Art Herman,
and the career he found at Koppers. But as the
manager to whom Art reports commented recently:
“Art’s an able man . . . we’re glad to have him. He
is making a real contribution to the Company.
All we in management can do is try our best to
develop a man’s bestqualities and, when he proves
to have the versatility that Art has, to see that
this versatility is recognized.”

If you feel that this is the atmosphere in which
you would most like to build your profession and
mark your progress, write to the Manager of Man-
power Planning, Koppers Company, Inc., Pitts-
burgh 19, Pennsylvania or contact your College
Placement Director.

INCO NICKEL

Pnoemass Repom    .  to warm a mine

Inco shows a king-size operation
that helps mine more Nickel

The bigger the mine, the more men at work,
the more air they need. Gales of air. Warmed
in winter. Cooled in summer. That’s the rea-
son for this mammoth “air conditioner” in
an Inco-Canada mine.

In winter it raises the temperature of cold
air from outside by making ice. In summer
it uses- the ice to cool air that’s too hot! (See
diagram below)

 

warmer Water. The water loses its heat, freezes
into mountains of solid ice. In the process, the latent
heat of freezing is transferred to the air, warms it up
for use inside the mine.

At full capacity in a Winter season, this
system alone can generate as much heat as
350,000 gallons of fuel oil. During this
period, 150,000 tons of ice may form. (See
photo at left)

Installations like this are expensive in
time and money. Such outlays are typical of
many made by Inco-Canada. Their cost adds
up to millions. Results are—to continue the
increased production of Nickel.

Photography and X-rays pointed
the way for Goodrich-Gulf
Chemicals Inc. to achieve a
synthetic that matches natural
rubber.

Heavy-duty truck and airplane tires
always had to have tree rubber to
assure acceptable performance.
Usual man-made rubber didn’t
quite ﬁll the bill. Its molecules didn’t
hang together like natural rubber.

But now Goodrich-Gulf scientists,
using x-ray diffraction photographs
to check molecular structure, have
produced Ameripol SN, a man-made

rubber with the same physical prop-
erties as crude rubber even to tack
and stickiness. It’s an achievement
that can mean a source of supply for
the nation’s new-rubber needs.

Playing a part in research like this
is only one of the many ways photog-
raphy is working for business and
industry today. In addition, it also
delves into problems of product
design, production, and quality con-
trol. It trains employees, dealers and
salesmen—does a sellingjob right
to the consumer.

Where do you find better advancement
opportunities—in a large company or a
small one? To help you, the college
student, resolve that problem, Mr. Abbott
answers the following questions con-
cerning advancement opportunities in
engineering, manufacturing and tech-
nical marketing at General Electric.

Q. In a large Company such as General
Electric, how can you assure that every
man deserving of recognition will get it?
Don't some capable people become lost?

A. No, they don’t. And it’s be-
cause of the way G.E. _has been
organized. By decentralizing into
more than a hundred smaller oper-
ating departments, we’ve been able
to pinpoint both authority and re-
sponsibility. Our products are engi-
neered, manufactured and marketed
by many departments comparable
to small companies. Since each is
completely responsible for its success
and proﬁtability, each individual
within the department has a deﬁned
share of that responsibility. There-
fore, outstanding performance is
readily recognized.

Q. If that's the case, are opportunities
for advancement limited to openings
within the department?

A. Not at all. That’s one of the
advantages of our decentralized
organization. It creates small oper-
ations that individuals can “get their
arms around”, and still reserves and
enhances the inherent advantages of
a large company. Widely diverse
opportunities and promotions are
available on a Company-wide basis.

Q. But how does a department find the
best man, Company-wide?

A. We’ve developed personnel reg-
isters to assure that the best quali-
ﬁed men for the job are not over-
looked. The registers contain com-

plete appraisals of professional em-
ployees. They enable a manager to
make a thorough and objective
search of the entire General Electric
Company and come up with the
man best qualiﬁed for the job.

Q. How do advancement opportunities
for technical graduates stack-up with
those of other graduates?

A. Very well. General Electric is
recognized as a Company with out-
standing technical skills and facili-
ties. One out of every thirteen em-
ployees is a scientist or engineer.
And approximately 50 per cent of
our Department General Managers
have technical backgrounds.

Q. How about speed of advancement?
ls G.E. a “young man's Company”?

A. Deﬁnitely. A majority of all
supervisors, managers and outstand-
ing individual contributors working
in the engineering function are below
the age of forty. We believe that a
job should be one for which you are
qualiﬁed, but above all it should be
one that challenges your ability. As
you master one job we feel that
consideration should be given to
moving you to a position of greater
responsibility. This is working, for
in the professional ﬁeld, one out of
four of our people are in positions of
greater responsibility today than
they were a year ago.

Q. Some men want to remain in a
specialized technical iob rather than go
into managerial work. How does this
affect their advancement?

A. At G.E. there are many paths
which lead to higher positions of
recognition and prestige. Every man
is essentially free to select the course
which best ﬁts both his abilities and
interests. Furthermore, he may mod-
ify that course if his interests change

it Works

as his career progresses. Along any
of these paths he may advance
within the Company to very high
levels of recognition and salary.

Q. What aids to advancement does
General Electric provide?

A. We believe that it’s just sound
business policy to provide a stimu-
lating climate for personal develop-
ment. As "the individual develops,
through his own efforts, the Com-
pany beneﬁts fror'fr~his contributions.
General Electric hasﬁdone much to
provide the right kind‘ of opportu-
nity for its employees. Oi‘;+standing
college graduates are given graduate
study aid through the G-E Honors
Program and Tuition Refund Pro-
gram. Technical graduates entering
the Engineering, Manufacturing, or
Technical Marketing Programs start
with on-the-job training and related
study as preparation for more re-
sponsible positions. Throughout
their G-E careers they receive fre-
quent appraisals as a guide for self
development. Company-conducted
courses are offered again at all
levels of the organization. These
help professionals gain the increas-
ingly higher levels of education
demanded by the complexities of
modern business. Our goal is to see
every man advance to the full limits
of his capabilities.

If you have other questions or want
information on our programs for
technical graduates, write to E. G.

Westinghouse is the best place

for talented engineers

Howard Zollinger joined Westinghouse in 1951-
has since earned MSEE and two U. S. patents

At 28, Howard A. Zollinger, a 1951 BSEE graduate of
Michigan College of Mining, and Technology is doing
“ . . . exactly what I always wanted to do.” Now a
systems design engineer, he specializes in the develop-
ment of modern materials handling systems to support
increasingly automated production techniques. Since
completion of the Westinghouse Student Training Course
in 1952, he has earned an enviable reputation as an
expert in drive systems; and he has submitted ﬁfteen
patent disclosures, two of which are about to result in
patents in his name.

Most important, Howard Zollinger is doing exactly
ivhat he wants to be doing. At the completion of his train-
irig course, he speciﬁcally asked that he be assigned to
his present department. And, when he decided that
additional graduate study would be helpful, the West-
inghouse Graduate Study Program enabled him to
combine this study with his regular job. After complet-
ing all required course work and his thesis last December,

AiResearch engineered and produced
this electro-hydraulic servo system-
the most reliable and responsive
steering control system for missiles
yet produced. Extremely lightweight,
it consists of three control valves and
six actuators.

This unique system represents but
a part of the challenging, important
work under way at AiResearch in
missile, electronic, nuclear, aircraft
and industrial ﬁelds.

Speciﬁc opportunities exist in sys-
tem electronics and servo control
units; computers and ﬂight instru-
ments; missile auxiliary power units;
gas turbine engines and turbine and
air motors; cryogenic and nuclear
systems; pneumatic valves; indus-
trial turbochargers; air conditioning
and pressurization; and heat trans-
fer, including electronic cooling and
nuclear applications.

Intensified engineering is con-

ducted by small groups where indi-
vidual effort and accomplishment are
quickly recognized, providing oppor-
tunity for rapid growth and advance-
ment. An eight-month orientation
program is offered prior to perma-
nent assignment to help determine
your placement from a variety of
analytical or development projects.

Advanced education is available
through company ﬁnancial assistance
at outstanding nearby universities.

LETTERS

Since this is the ﬁrst issue of the
school year and the absence of any
bonaﬁde Letters To The Editor is
obvious, we present a series of let-
ters and replys concerning Sid Clump
——a bumpkin of the ﬁrst water,
whose transformation is exempliﬁed
in this correspondence between him-
self and his Pa during Sid’s one sem-
ester stay at Engineering School.

With apologies to Jay Nixon, Uni-
versity of Texas.

Pitzburgh, Pa.
Dear Pa,
Ah got here all in one piece OK,
only had to stop once to put sum
white gas in the John Deer. Mah
nu hause is all glass and you kin
see out wonderful well. Ah have
had a little trouble. Ah cain’t ﬁnd
the outhouse and Ah’m already tol-
erable uncomfortable. Ah looked
out back and all they is, is a parkin’
lot. Just don’t seem quite decent.
Ah have already bought mah books
and started in a readin’ and study-
in’. Ah’m gonna make all A’s this
year. Well it is gettin on towards
seven o’clock and Ah’m awful sleepy
so Ah’ll close.

Yore luvin son

train a glavanized tub for you tuh

a week if’n you need it or not. She
says fer you to bathe behind a
blankit since your house is glass.

Son stay away from the city wimen
—— they dune ruint your cousin
Caleb.

Yore
Pa

We will pass over a half semester’s
correspondence to allow the reader
a better view of the amazing change
that even so short a period at the
University brought about in Old
Sid . . . .

Pitsburgh, Pa.
Dear Dad

Well I just want tuh drop you all
a line to say hello.

I got through mah quizzies OK.
Made 4 Cs and a D. I wuz out with
the boys at the Ah-Felta-Thi house.
They got me a date with a real cute
gal frum Buda. She’s a country girl
and WOW! did we have fun. Her
name’s Lucy.

Well say Dad could you send me
ten dollars extra this month. I’m
runnin a little short.

Se ya Christmas.

Your Boy
Country

Dear Cuntry,

Mighty glad you did OK on them
quizzes. Ah heaord tell they are
right important.

There is a check enclosed for $10.00.
Ah hope it will be enough. Yore ma
says tell you to send her some store
bought Brogans in size 12. Her ole
ones is shot and Luke don’t have
any tripple Es at the General Store.
Glad you ain’t foolin around with
no city gals. We heard frum Cousin
Caleb an he says he’s glad too.

Yore
Pa

Another half semester’s passed
and completed the transformation
in persanolity as Sid Clump, edu-
cated man writes this letter just be-
fore ﬁnals.

Pittsburgh, Pa.
Whatcha Say Cat Man!
How’s kicks in the old hick town.
We had a party at the Felt House
the other night and used that tub
you sent me at the ﬁrst of school
to ice down the hooch. The guys
really got a buzz outa you hicks
thinking there were no bathrooms
up here.
Well, ﬁnals are coming up pretty
quick and I haven’t had time to

study much lately. Valerie has been
keeping me plenty busy. Yu know
what I mean—WOW! Kid wants to
go every minute. She’s from Home-
stead and she says they have a lot
more kicks up there than we do
and that chick ought to know.

Say Lad, how’s about ﬂoatin me
to a couple of C’s extra this month?
Val’s used to a good time and you
don’t want her to think her Siddy
is a square do you—

See you round,
The Hustler

Dear Son

Seems as though you’ve gone and
gotten mixed up with a city gal
after all. You better take your Pa’s
advice and git sut of her right now.
Yore Cousin Caleb thinks so too
and he says he don’t like Fort Bliss
any too well. He thinks that they
are about to be sent to Alaska pret-
ty soon though.

You will ﬁnd in this envelope a.
check for $35.00. It is all the more
we could spare. Please spend it
wisely.

Study hard and please leave the
city gal alone.

Yore
Pa

Then shortly came this . . . .

Dear Mr. Clump

It is my unpleasant duty to in-
form you that your son Sidney B.
Clump has failed to make suﬂicient
pasing grade to make him eligible
to continue on as a student at the
University of Pittsburgh . . . . !

It is apparent that higher educa-
tion had done all that it could for
Sid in preparing him for his future.
In a short time he received a letter
that began——

“Greetings from The President of
the United States”

Anyone receiving correspondence
from such high authority must have
been aided to the fullest by Univer-
sity life and training. The School
can be proud that another man
has left her hallowed halls and gone
on to fame and fortune . . .
