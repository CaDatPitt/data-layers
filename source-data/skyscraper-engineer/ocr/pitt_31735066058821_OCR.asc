OCTOBER I960

The influence which one man can exert on the
lives of others is extremely difficult to measure. He
can guide or he can rule, but regardless of his methods,
the only indication of his success will be found in the
actions of those with whom he has come into contact.

In the history of the SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER,
one man, far above all others has influenced the life
of the magazine, guiding it from a small, struggling
publication to its present position as one of the leading
college technical magazines in the country.

Dr. Swarts served as advisor to student publica-
tions at the University of Pittsburgh from 1953 until
his recent appointment as Dean of the Johnstown
College. During his years as advisor to publications
Dr. Swarts showed his dynamic leadership in many
ways. He welded all publications staffs at Pitt into a.
solid, cooperative unit. He stresses journalistic profes-
sionalism in all publications efforts and he led in the
constant improvement of all publications. It was under
Dr. Swarts guidance that the Pitt News became an
All-American college newspaper, The Owl became a
leading college yearbook and the Skyscraper Engineer
grew and flourished.

It was not long until Dr. Swarts became known
among faculty and students as a tireless worker and a
true friend of the students whose activities he guided.
Many extracurricular organizations asked Dr. Swarts
to be their faculty advisor. He always consented and
then devoted countless hours to his students in helping
them to build their organization. Dr. Swarts advised,
in addition to all student publications, Pi Delta Epsilon
journalism fraternity, Phi Eta Sigma, freshman scho-
lastic honorary, Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity
and ODK to name just a few.

In addition to his duties as director of student
publications and advisor to student organizations, Dr.
Swarts served as Associate Dean of Students and a
member of the English Department. He taught courses
in technical writing, and business english. In all these
activities Dr. Swarts friendliness and sincerity won him
the respect and admiration of faculty and students
throughout the University.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER is celebrating its
tenth anniversary this year. The present staff of the
magazine is proud to dedicate this issue, the first of
the tenth year, to Dr. Donald E. Swarts. .

HIGH PERFORMANCE PIPES

Ram Induction provides free supercharging with increased
volumetric efficiency

There have been many interesting technical devel-
opments this year in the American automotive industry.
The compact cars have been introduced and for the
first time in many years there is some variety in the
Detroit products. The Corvair has independent rear
suspension and an air cooled rear mounted engine. Other
compact cars to be unveiled this fall by General Motors
are rumored to be even more revolutionary.

The Chrysler Corporation, which introduced the
first high compression engines, hemispherical combus-
tion chambers and disc brakes to the American motor-
ist, continues to make its share of technical innovations.
Late last year, ram induction was made available to
buyers of Chrysler cars.

Ram induction is a method of increasing the volu-
metric efficiency and, therefore, the power output of a
piston engine. One of the first persons to use its prin-
ciples in this country was Harry Miller. Miller was
manufacturing racing carburetors during World War
I when he discovered that adding air horns to his car-
buretors improved engine performance. He varied the
length and shape of the air horns and tested them on the
tracks to determine the optimum configuration. In 1922
when Miller began to build complete racing engines he
combined his air horns with tuned, individual exhaust
pipes. In later years he even combined air horns with
superchargers. But when the era of board tracks and
riding mechanics faded away, so did Miller’s use of
tuned intake and exhaust systems.

Ram induction was a forgotten method of boost-
ing automotive engine performance until 1953. In that
year an attempt was made to qualify a Chrysler power-
ed Kurtis roadster for the Indianapolis 500 mile race.
The engine used was a destroked version of the hemis-
pherical combustion chamber Firepower engine equip-
ped with modified Hilborn fuel injectors and ram
tubes.

Stuart Hilborn, founder of the Fuel Injection En-
gineering Company, has since done a considerable
amount of dynamometer work with ram tubes. Because
of the highly competitive nature of the racing equip-
ment business he is reluctant to release his findings. But

I2

BY JOSEPH R. LANCE

in answer to an inquiry, Hilborn said that ram tubes
have added as much as thirty horsepower to unblown
Chrysler engines during his dynamometer tests.

The Chrysler Indianapolis engine of 1953 was not
the only one to use ram tubes. Almost all of the Offen-
hauser engines use ram tubes of varying length depend-
ing on the tastes of the individual mechanics. Leo Goos-
en, Design Engineer for the Meyer and Drake Engi-
neering Corporation, states that ram tubes increase the
horsepower output of the Offy engine by as much as
eight to ten percent.

In spite of these successes with ram induction, it is
still not widely used. One reason may be that ram tun-
ing can be quite complicated. Even the research and
racing engineers are not in complete agreement when it
comes to explaining ram tuning.

Harry Weslake, one of Britains noted designers of
racing combustion chambers and induction systems,
considers ram tuning as an art and not a science. Chrys-
ler Corporation’s explanation of the art follows:

The ram induction manifold represents the prac-
tical application of the two physical properties of iner-
tia and resonance. Inertia is the tendency for an object
(including gases) in motion to remain in motion and
an object at rest to remain so. A loaded wheelbarrow is
difficult to start and stop but requires less force to move
at a constant speed. Resonance is the phenomena of a
system vibrating at its natural frequency being rein-
forced by an external vibration operating at the same
frenquency or a multiple of the original. A swimmer
using a springboard adjusts his rate (frequency) of
jumping to match the natural frequency of the board
and thus secures the greatest possible boost from the
springboard. An application of these two principles can
be used to recover some of the pumping losses encoun-
tered by an engine in drawing——in fresh fuel-air mixture.

In order to apply these principles to a practical
induction system it is necessary to have the natural
frequency of the intake manifold branches match the
frequency (or harmonic) of the intake valve at some
desired engine speed.

In operation, the fuel-air mixture in the manifold

development of the General Motors fuel injection system.

will vibrate at its natural frequency regardless of engine
speed. These vibrations consist of high and low pressure

pulses traveling in the manifold branches at the speed
of sound. The pressure waves are reflected back and
forth by the ends of the manifold branch while the pre-
dominate motion of the fuel-air mixture is toward the
cylinder.

In the tuned speed range, the opening of the intake
valve reinforces the vibrations in the manifold, and co-
incides with the arrival of a high pressure pulse at the
intake port. This condition is known as resonance and
operates over approximately a 1500 rpm speed range
to supply a larger-than-normal charge of fuel-air mix-
ture to the cylinder. In addition to this, the inertia of
the fuel-air mixture in the manifold continues to force
fresh charge into the cylinder until the instant the in-
take valve closes. As the result of these two conditions,
a peak boost occurs at 2800 rpm (engine speed) and
amounts to a ten percent peak torque increase over
previous manifolding. Tuning can be done for any en-

OCTOBER l960

ginc speed by changing the length of the manifold
branches. This, of course, changes the natural frequency
of the manifold and thus the speed at which resonance
occurs.

There is another school of thought that includes
the cylinder volume with the intake pipe as part of the
resonating system. In this case the gas in the intake pipe
is the oscillating mass, and the gas in the cylinder is
considered as the spring on which the intake pipe gases
oscillate. This theory treats resonance as a phenomena
that occurs only during the time interval when the in-
take valve is open. The combination intake pipe and
cylinder volume is then similar to the classical “Helm-
holtz resonator” or fixed cavity acoustical resonator.
The difference is that the cavity, in this case the cylin-
dcr volume, is variable. If the frequency equation of
the Helmholtz resonator is modified to include a varia-
ble volume, the resulting equation leads to an infinite
trigonometric series solution. The oscillation of greatest
amplitude, or the principal resonant frequency of the
variable-volume resonator is very close to the resonant
frequency of a fixed cavity resonator. This occurs when
the total cylinder volume is taken as the fixed cavity.
Helmuth W. Engleman of the University of Wisconsin
published an ASME paper which treated resonance in
this manner. He ran some experiments with a small,
single cylinder four cycle engine. The data obtained
tended to confirm the Helmholtz resonator theory as
applied to ram induction.

Actually, both the Helmholtz resonator theory and
Chrysler’s resonating intake pipe theory are both sim-
plifications of the actual ram induction process. These
simplifications are necessary to gain understanding of
the process and to provide design criteria for ram induc-
tion engines. A complete theoretical analysis would have
to include the resonance in the intake pipe and cylinder
during the valve open and closed periods. Since the
process is a dynamic one, with flowing gases and mov-
ing pistons and valves, such a theoretical description
would be extremely complicated.

Also there are many variables involved when ram
induction is applied to a mass production engine. For
instance, manifold ports seldom match the cylinder head
ports in Detroit engines. A slight mis-alignment at this
point in the intake pipe could create a pressure disturb-
ance that interferes with resonant tuning. Any project-
ion into the gas stream will cause the building up and
shedding of vorticies at a regular frequency. These un-
desirable vibrations may interfere with resonant tuning
of the induction system. The timing of the intake valve
and its rate of opening and closing are important. Small
changes in valve action as caused by different valve
train operating clearances can affect manifold tuning.
Chrysler gets around this difficulty by using hydraulic
valve lifters with zero operating clearances. But it would
be expensive and almost impossible, for them to match
the intake ports perfectly on all of the ram induction
engines.

Resonant tuning can be applied to the exhaust

process also, but with four cycle automotive engines,
greater gains can be obtained by tuning the induction
system. Of course, induction tuning can be used in con-
junction with exhaust tuning as it is used in motorcycle
engines. Now that Chrysler has created so much in-
terest in manifold tuning, a considerable amount of ex-
perimental work will be done by hot-rod enthusiasts and
racing equipment manufacturers. These tests will not
answer all the

6

‘why’’ questions but they will undoubt-
edly lead to automotive engines with completely tuned
induction and exhaust systems.

Let’s take another look at the inertia aspect of
manifold tuning. Resonance is beneficial only in a lim-
ited speed range, but inertia effects can be utilized over
a much wider engine speed range to increase volumetric
efficiency. In modern automotive engines, the intake gas-
es move at velocities from 50 to 300 feet per second. As
the intake valve is closed in front of this high velocity gas
stream, the kinetic energy of the gas column is spent
to produce a pressure rise. This results in a mild super-
charging effect that does not depend on resonance. The
Chevrolet Corvette fuel injection manifold makes use
of the principle. The inertia of the intake pipe gases can
be increased by increasing the length or decreasing the
diameter of the intake pipe. This also increases the fric-
tion through the pipe and at higher engine speeds vol-
umetric efficiency may fall off rapidly.

It should be noted that as the length of the intake
pipe is increased, its natural frequency becomes lower.
Therefore the short Corvette intake pipes have a much
higher natural frequency than Chrysler’s thirty inch
tubes. The Corvette manifold probably resonates above
6000 rpm but inertia effects alone boost performance
at lower engine speeds.

shafts, uses inertia in a slightly different manner. He
produces what is called a 5 cycle camshaft for OHV
eight cylinder engines. If this case is to be effective the
engine must have completely separate intake and ex-
haust ports, and exhaust headers at least three feet long.
The fifth cycle is described as a cooling phase of Isken-
derian. The overlap period (when the intake and ex-
haust valves are open at the same time) of the cam is
very long. During valve overlap, the inertia of the gases
carries a charge of fuel-air mixture into the cylinder
and out the exhaust port before the intakestroke starts.
Admittedly, this is not the way to get good gas mileage
or low speed torque, but the relatively cool fuel-air mix-
ture greatly reduces the temperature of the cylinder
walls, pistons and valves. Improved volumetric efficiency
then results due to the lower cylinder temperatures when
the intake stroke starts. The lower temperatures also
reduce detonation tendencies when nitrated fuels or
high supercharge pressures are used.

Iskenderian’s fifth cycle camshafts are impractical
for use in passenger automobiles even if that curious
breed of Chevy owners at the local Eat’n Park uses them.
It is very possible that none of us will ever experience
the acceleration of a Hilborn equipped Offy coming out
of a turn at the Brickyard, but the Chrysler Corpora-
tion has made the benefits of ram induction available
to all new car buyers.

With this thought in mind, two late model Dodges
were borrowed to evaluate the road performance of
ram induction. The first Dodge was a 1959 model with
the Super D—500 engine, heavy duty Torqueflite trans-
mission, and a twin traction rear axle with 3:31 gears.
The second Dodge was a 1960 ram induction model with
the same transmisison and rear axle. The only difference
between the two engines was the ram induction mani-
fold ,' the 1959 engine has the same dual four barrel car-

buretors mounted on a conventional manifold. After
driving these cars one fact was evident. The engine
equipped with the conventional manifold has more low
speed torque than the one with the long ram tubes. This
is illustrated by the steep downward slope of the torque
curve on the low rpm side. The low relative torque of
the ram induction engine at low engine speeds is ac-
companied by a considerable amount of roughness. The
engine seems to “tremble” between idling speed and
1200 rpm. While these characteristics may be caused
by the manifold being out of tune; (a negative pressure
pulse arriving at the intake valve at the point of open-
ing) it is probably that they are caused by poor fuel
distribution or fuel droplets condensing on the manifold
walls due to low gas velocities or insufficient manifold
heating.

For a performance minded individual low speed
characteristics are not too important. We must remem-
ber that the four cycle automotive engine is by nature,
inflexible, its maximum power and torque are developed
within a small operating speed range. Above 1600 rpm
is where the ram induction manifold really becomes ef-
fective. The passing gear performance of the ram induc-
tion Dodge is really startling, the car literally leaps for-
ward, almost breaking traction at the rear wheels. By
comparison with the ’59 Dodge it is easy to believe the
torque increase is ten percent. Both of these cars were
tuned to factory specifications to eliminate any false
horsepower increases.

No timed acceleration or top speed runs were made
for these cars. No facilities were available and the local
constabulary does not approve of such wholesome activ-
ities. However, some data was obtained at the Salem,
Ohio quarter mile dragstrip where the ram induction
Dodge was run in the Super Stock automatic class. Get
ting off the starting line was a bit of a problem with
this car due to the low speed torque characteristics.

Flooring the accelerator pedal with the engine idling
in low range resulted in coughing and stalling. Holding
the brake pedal down while winding up the engine in
low range, and releasing the brake when the starter’s
flag was thrown did not change matters. The only alter-
native left was to rev up the engine in neutral and then
engage low range when the flag was dropped. When us-
ing this procedure it pays to be conservative. On one
occasion the owner of the Dodge was a little over enthu-
siastic; he let the engine rpm get too high in neutral,
and when the transmission shifted to low range, uncon-
trollable wheel spin resulted. Since the Dodge has a
twin traction rear axle, such action is a vivid demonstra-
tion of its tremendous maximum torque. Less exciting
runs gave better elapsed times and speeds; the best were
16.2 seconds and 89 miles per hour. An attempt was
made to improve the performance by varying the spark
plugs, ignition points and timing settings. No improve-
ment in elapsed time or speed resulted. Torque converter
transmissions have a way of damping out any small
gains in horsepower obtained in this manner. The pipes
connecting the exhaust manifold to the intake manifold

OCTOBER I960

heat chambers were removed to see what effect a “cold”
intake manifold would have on low speed operation.
Low speed throttle response was not changed at all. This
tends to confirm suspicions that the loss in low end
torque with the ram induction manifold is partly due
to poor fuel vaporization. One might say that the ram
induction manifold behaves like a conventional mani-
fold with its heat risers blocked. The situation could be
remedied by including heat chambers the full length of
the ram tubes in the manifold casting and using the
cooling system water as the heat source. Chrysler engi-
neers undoubtedly have some thoughts about this but
they have to contend with closely controlled production
costs.

In spite of critical production costs, the Chrysler
Corporation has made a great advance in intake mani-
fold design. The ram induction engine has a terrific
amount of performance potential; it’s a little disappoint-
ing to see them restricted by hydraulic valve lifters and
the lack of a close ratio syncromesh transmission. Never-
theless, the ram induction manifold is a perfect example
of the kind of ingenious and imaginative engineering
that is needed in more of our consumer products.

THIS VERSION OF THE OFFENHAUSER ENGINE is
designed for side mounting at an angle of eighteen degrees
from the horizontal. it develops 400 BHP at 6500 rpm using
Methanol for fuel. The ram tubes are approximately four-
teen inches in length from atmosphere to intake valve.

In April, 1942, the city of New York started con-
struction on one of the largest airports in the world.
Originally planned to be 1,100 acres, it was expanded
to 4,900 acres and became known as Idlewild Airport.
Although the aircraft facilities, such as runways and
aprons are important, the most impressive aspect of the
new airport is its terminal area, commonly known as
Terminal City.

Everything about the airport is huge. It has 81/2
miles of runways, over 20 miles of turnways, and five
parking lots with space for 6,000 cars. So far, over
250 million dollars hav-e been spent on the airport, ex-
clusive of furnishings and decorations employed in Ter-
rninal City.

Construction on the airport began in 1942, and in
1947, The Port of New York Authority leased the air-
port for the city of New York. The first scheduled flight
took place in July, 1948. Since that time, many spectac-
ular changes have occurred. Beginning with a trickle of
passengers and cargo, the services have developed to
where last year 16,175 passengers per day or 6 million
passengers per year were flown. One hundred and
sixty-eight million pounds of freight and 57,000,000
pounds of air mail were also handled. By 1965, it is
expected that 12,000,000 passnegers will be handled
annually.

To handle this large flow of traffic, Terminal City
has been built. It covers 655 acres of ground and includes
an eleven story control tower, six US.‘ airline terminal
buildings, an International Arrival Building, two airline
Wing Buildings which serve 21 foreign flag airlines, and
a 220 acre International Park. There is also a three

‘I6

acre chapel area and a central air conditioning and
heating plant.
The Control Tower stands next to the International

.Arrival Building. It was built by the PNYA (Port of

New York Authority) and has been leased to the Federal
Aviation Agency at one dollar per year. Costing one mil-
lion dollars, it is one of the largest and most modern
control towers in the world. The 40 x 165 foot structure
is 150 feet, or eleven stories, high. The top floor is an
octagonal control cab enclosed by double-wall one-
fourth inch, thick green glass which has been stressed
to withstand 90 mile per hour gales.

The control tower is operated by 15 skilled elec-
tronic specialists and 50 air traffic control specialists.
The equipment consists of 7 radio positions, 3 in the
tower cab and 4 in the radar room. There are 30 radio
transmitters, 25 radio receivers, and direction finding
equipment. Radar equipment consists of two air search
radars, and one airport surface detection unit which is
used to control movement on the runways and turn-
ways.Three seperate power sources insure the continu-
ous operation of equipment and safety facilities.

The central heating and air conditioning plant
serves the entire Terminal City. The building was dress-
ed up and now attracts many sightseers every day. The
plant uses different colored pipes to carry the chilled
water and heater water for the air conditioning. The
Carrier air conditioning plant provides 6,300 tons of
cooling per day, which makes it one of the ten largest
cooling plants in the world. The heated and chilled wat-
er travels through ten miles of pipe to completely air
condition the terminal buildings.

Incoming passengers from foreign countries usually
proceed to the International Arrival Building first. It is
three stories high, approximately 760 feet long and 640
feet deep with two double-deck 240 foot arcades. In-
coming passengers use the first floor in moving to the
inspection services in Health, Immigration and Customs.
Persons meeting the incoming passenger can watch their
progress through large glass windows. The present Cus-
toms procedure has been improved into a super market
type operation. The passengers are pre-checked and
then any duties owed are paid at checkout counters.
This building also features restaurant facilities, a 400

The foreign flag airlines are served at the Airline
Navy Building of Terminal City. There are two build-
ings, West and East Airline Wing Buildings. The Wing
buildings are adjacent to the International Arrival
Building. Each airline is responsible for the decoration
and functional design of their own facilities. When out-
going passengers are ready to depart, they go to the
office of their airline to be ticketed and have their bag-
gage checked. When their flight is called, they can pro-
ceed to their plane by way of the second floor with its
fully enclosed arcades. There are 24 plane positions to
serve the International Arrival and Wing buildings.

The individual terminal buildings for the U.S. Air-
lines will form an oval perimeter of Terminal City. The
individual airlines will not own the buildings but will
lease them from the NYPA. The buildings are designed

and decorated by the airlines themselves subject, of
course, to NYPA approval. The buildings that have been
built are long and spectacular in design.

TWA’s new million dollar terminal features a
swooping wing-like roof and a lounge that seats pas-
sengers like a theatre, allowing them to watch the field
like threatre patrons. The architect created a canti-
levered concrete shell that spans the entire 315 feet.
Tiers of upholstered seats in the main waiting lounge
are arranged in a semi-circle facing the high glass wall
of the main terminal. The seats overlook Idlewild’s
north-south and east-west runways. The TWA terminal
will provide direct access to Boeing 707 jet liners at ten
parking positions.

The 20 million dollar terminal being built for East-
ern Airlines is described as the largest single airline ter-
minal in the world. The terminal is twice as large as the
entire passenger terminal at Newark; while the main

lobby is longer than the arena at Madison Square Gar-
den. Eastern believes they will accommodate 2.3 million
passengers and visitors in 1960. The building was con-
structed of steel, glass and reinforced concrete. Another
feature of Eastern’s terminal is a snow melting system.
Fourteen miles of pipe carrying 380-degree water have
been laid in the upper and lower vehicle ramps, service
courtyard, luggage cart, runways, and passengers exits
leading to the open area.

United Airline’s two level terminal has been design-
ed to speed passengers through the lobby and onto their
planes. United claims the whole procedure of baggage
handling and ticketing can be accomplished in as little
as two minutes. By 1961, U.A.L. expects to handle
1,250,000 passengers a year. The terminal will then have
a complete shopping center to serve all the passenger’s
needs. In the terminal, flight information will be tele-
vised over sets in eight lounges.

Murals, stained glass, and gate lounges are featured
by American Airline’s 14 million dollar passenger termi_
nal. A glass wall 30 feet high runs the full length of the
building. Glazed tile is used in multi-colored abstract
patterns. A unique system is planned for passenger load-
ing. When the aircraft is in position, a telescopic pas-
senger corridor will pivot and then extended mechan-
ically until it fits against the rear door. Passengers will
pass directly from the terminal to the waiting aircraft
through these tubes. This tube will cornpletely protect
passengers from the elements.

Pan American’s terminal building has a roof that
resembles an umbrella. This unusual roof design has
been wind tunnel tested to determine its aerodynamic
characteristics. The four acre roof has been stressed to
withstand even hurricane winds. The overhanging roof
is enough to completely protect six big jets. Another

unique feature of the terminal is an 89 foot front “door”
that is composed of an air curtain. Six hundred thousand
cubic feet of air per minute are pumped across the open-
ing to insure that pasesngers will not be impeded by
opening or closing doors. Eight automated baggage
counters with 2 conveyors each will handle up to 1,000
pasesngers per hour. The seating capacity of the ter-
minal is very large, 1,000 passengers as compared with
358 in all at LaGuardia Airport. The all-glass walls of
this imposing building will give the impression of spa-
ciousness to the passengers. The architectural design in
the building is not only novel but also functional.

Another big operation at Terminal City is the re-
fueling service. Eleven hundred employees are kept busy
pumping 200 million gallons of fuel per year‘. One spe-
cial problem of Allied New York Services, Inc., the re-
fueling company, is the different fuels specified by the
various airlines. There are 22 different fuels handled and
kept segregated by Allied. Since a fuel order may call for
12,000 gallons for a jet or 50 gallons for a helicopter,
Allied must maintain a versatile and efficient fleet of
131 trucks.

The numerous major buildings have already been
described along with a few of the services available but
these are not the main reason why the complex is called
Terminal City. This name was given to the terminal
because it is a self-contained city. In the walls of the
various terminals and buildings can be found an Animal
Port, restaurants, an International Hotel, doctors, po-
lice, buses, and even a bank. The air passengers could
almost settle down to live for good in the new gleaming
expanse of dazzling architectural design. Terminal City
is a tremendous advance in the basic thinking of what
a passenger terminal should be and the service it should
provide.

Facts about chemical industry
growth that can be
important to your future career

Did you know that the chemical industry has grown at a rate of about
10% per year since 1929, as compared with only 3% for the econ-
omy as a whole? It's a fact! And there's every reason to believe that
this favorable growth rate will continue.

For the graduating chemist or chemical engineer, this spells oppor-
tunity. Opportunity to grow with a growing industry.

Allied Chemical, for example, now produces more than 3,000 diver-
sified chemicals at over 100 plants throughout the country. Many of
these products are ba_s.ig—used in volume by almostieargl industry.
Allied is at the heart of the nation's economy and looks forward
to continued growth and stability.

F LUTTER RESEARCH AT PITT

BY RICHARD P. JOHNSTON

With all the research being conducted in hyper-
sonic aircraft and rockets, it is surprising to learn
that a pair of engineers traveled more than 250 miles
to find a sub-sonic wind tunnel. This is exactly what
happened when Bell Aero Systems, formerly Bell Air-
craft, tried to find a slow speed tunnel recently to
test a new device for inducing wind flutter in an
aircraft wing. It was at the University of Pittsburgh
that Bell’s two project engineers, Benjamin B. D’Ewart
and Robert F. Farrell found their tunnel and began
their tests.

The problem of high speed wing flutter has been
a serious one since the coming of the Mach one plus
aircraft. The trouble with finding and analyzing the
causes of wing flutter has been that aircraft has a
peculiar habit of being destroyed when it goes fast
enough to induce the severe flutter needed for observa-
tion. The wing vibrations would begin and then rapidly

PART OF THE TEST|NGvwas monitoring the recording instruments to ascer-

 

become violent enough to destroy the wing before the
plane could be ‘slowed sufficiently to stop the flutter.
The device tested and developed at the University
of Pittsburgh’s Aeronautical Engineering wind tunnel
may alleviate this dangerous problem. Bell is working
on a method of artificially changing the mass charac-
teristics of a wing while a wind tunnel test is being run.
Changing the mass characteristics of a wing changes
the flutter behavior of the wing. This change can be
used to induce severe vibration. With the small model
wing tested here, the simulated mass changes were
caused by a small vane in the tip of the wing that
deflected a stream of high pressure nitrogen. This de-
flection caused a force to be exerted on the tip, which
in turn caused severe flutter to occur at much lower
speeds than would have normally occurred with this
wing. As the wing began to flutter, the vane deflected
the gas in a direction opposite to the win-g travel so

that the flutter was amplified and quickly overcame
the natural damping characteristics of the wing. When
the flutter reached a certain level, an accelerometer
on the wing would reduce the vane deflection and
limit the vibration amplitude.

The input data from the wing was sent into re-
cording machines so that the results could be analyzed
by the computer section at Bell. The instruments re-
corded displacement of the leading and trailing edges
and the angle of attack of the vane. Also, the pressure
of the nitrogen supply and the force resulting from
the gas deflection were recorded. Incidentally, the
data recorded on a previous test period indicated that
there was a rotary turbulence in the wind flow
through the tunnel. Before the tests were resumed,
vanes were installed to correct this condition.

The idea of changing the wing flutter characteristics
and speed was originated by Gerome Emerson, while
Benjamin DEwart has been the project engineer
in charge of developing the system. Many inquiries
have been made to Bell about the possibilities of using
the principle in actual flight testing. Benjamin D’Ewart
said that for an actual aircraft wing, at small rocket
could be used to supply the high speed jet of gas to
the vane. The plane would be able to fly at safe speeds
while violent fluttering could be imparted to the wing
to test strength characteristics. The flutter could be
closely controlled and turned on and off at will. This
would be a great advantage over present testing methods
where flight speeds are so great that aircraft destruction
is common.

The co-operation of the University of Pittsburgh
with corporations such as Bell Aero Systems in testing
and research is a mutually advantageous situation. The
corporations have the benefit of University testing fa-
cilities, while the School has the opportunity of allow-
ing teachers and students to observe first hand current
experimental projects in process. It would be a welcome
sight on the Pitt campus to have more such projects
as this.

ENGINEERING INFLUENCE ON OUR
POLITICAL ECONOMY

A long time defender of the “American System
of Free Enterprise,” world-famous industrialist Colonel
Willard F. Rockwell is the author of “Engineering In-
fluence on our Political Economy.”

A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Colonel Rockwell has been vigorously
engaged in the field of engineering, and industrial
orginization and management for 50 years. He has
participated in the top management of numerous
companies, currently heading both the Rockwell
Standard Corporation, producer of hydraulic drives,
executive type viprate planes, lighting standards, bridge
decking and axles for trucks, buses and streetcars; and
the Rockwell Manufacturing Company, one of the
world’s best-known diversified manufacturing firms,
producing power tanks, parking meters, electric
counters, electronic and pneumatic measurment and

counting devices, and automatic voting machines. He-

has been thrust even deeper into the economic stream
of our country through his directorship of several in-
surance firms, the Pittsburgh National Bank, Pitts-
burgh & Lake Erie Railroad, an engineering firm and
several investment companies.

During World War II, Colonel Rockwell served
as Director of Production of the U. S. Martime Com-
mission, directing America’s record-breaking war time
merchant shipbuilding program, and as a member of
the Executive Committee of the Army and Navy
Munitions Board. Shortly after President Eisenhower
took office in 1953, he was appointed special assistant
to the Administration of the Mutual Security Agency
and later a special assistant to the Secretary of Defense,
during which time he reported on the European pro-
duction situation, and represented the Defense Depart-
ment at a NATO Conference in Paris.

Colonel Rockwell has received numerous awards
in America and abroad for industrial achievement and
active support of the free enterprise. He received an
honorary Doctor of Laws degree from Grove City
College, and an honorary Doctor of Science degree from
Duquesne University for work as chairman of the
President’s Advisory Board. Here, he was further
honored for his long and outstanding service to
Duquesne when the Univcrsity’s newest and largest

26

building was opened under the name of “Rockwell
Hall.”

In addition to his many industrial awards, Colonel
Rockwell has been honored by several engineering
socities. In 1954 he was elevated to the grade of Fellow
in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, an
honor held by fewer than 400 members. He is a life
member of the ASME and a member of its Metals
Committee. Colonel Rockwell is also an Honorary
member of Sigma Beta Sigma Fraternity—a Profes-
sional Engineering Fraternity.

Colonel Rockwell maintains membership in
numerous social, educational, business, academic, and
religious boards and clubs.

Thus, as a businessman, industrial director, govern-
ment advisor and citizen, Colonel Rockwell speaks in
the area of foreign aid and inflation.

Colonel W. F. Rockwell

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

How many of us remember that George Wash-
ington was a civil engineer? Thomas _]efferson’s father,
Peter Jefferson, was a civil engineer; and the son was
educated at William and Mary College, where he
studied higher mathematics and natural sciences. The
ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA tells us he ac-
quired knowledge “only possessed at this age by men
who have a rare natural ability and taste for these
studies.’ He applied his knowledge of architecture,
civil engineering, and mechancial engineering most
skillfully in the design and building of his two homes --
Monticello and Poplar Forest -- where recent altera-
ations revealed mechanical devices he developed which

9

were far in advance of anything available in his time.
Benjamin Franklin could clearly claim to be our first
electrical engineer, and the records show he invented
many mechanical devices and wrote original essays
on scientific subjects.

Thomas Jefferson is generally regarded as a great
lawyer and lawmaker, so it is usally inferred that he
advocated the election of lawyers to our legislative
branches. On the contrary, when irritated by inaction
in Congress while the members were playing politics
instead of probing into the country’s current prob-
lems, he exclaimed: “If the present Congress errs in
too much talking, how can it be otherwise in a body
to which the people send one hundred and fifty law-
yers, whose trade is to question everything, yield
nothing, and talk by the hour? That one hundred and
fifty lawyers should do business together ought not
to be expected.”

Today, lawyers predominate in both houses of
Congress -- some are great lawyers, but too many
only ran for Congress because they lacked clients in
their home communities where they were best known.

Engineering, in contrast to most other professions,
deals primarily and principally with mathematics and
the immutable laws of nature. This stabilizing factor
contrasts most clearly with the legal profession, with
its current costly confusion and contradictions in
making and breaking down state and federal laws.

Dean Grinter of the University of Florida and
Professor Howland of Purdue both contributed to the
1955 edition of the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITAN-
NICA, and their comments on the success of engineers
in other lines are interesting. Dean Grinter says:
“Many engineers graduate into the management or
administrative function in industry or government
since their training and experience encompasses the
four essentials of handling men, money, methods and
materials.”

That modest statement does not indicate that a
Carnegie Institute engineering graduate became presi-
dent of our largest corporation, or that he resigned
to become Secretary of Defense.

Professor Howland says: “The need for men who
can view the whole area of engineering, wide and
complex as it is, as a single field of operation of rela-

OCTOBER I960

tively few basic laws and methods, became increasingly
recognized. Such men can work well with others of
different specialties, and, when they gain sufficient
experience and judgment, can successfully plan and
direct vast enterprises with economy and dispatch.”

Again, no mention is made of the pertinent fact
that ex-President Herbert Hoover was an engineer,
-- one who had the widest mining and engineering
experience, which, combined with business judgment,
enabled him to build a fortune in his pioneer work
in many of the most difficult, inaccessible, and un-
developed foreign fields. If, when he became Presi-
dent, he had possessed the political acumen which he
has accumulated since, he would never have been so
slandered as he was when paltry politicians led the
public to believe that the great depression originated
in the United States; that our people suffered more
than the people of any other area in the world; and,
most ridiculous of all, that Herbert Hoover could have
prevented it! He, with his engineering training, be-
lieved that eventually truth would prevail; but one
thing history has proved is, that when hard and pain-
ful truth first collides with political soft soap, action
and reaction are neither simultaneous nor equal in
force. His personal philanthropies and his ‘service to
starving millions, following both world wars, are in the
record, and so impressive that the Russian communists
try, even today, to “bury” them. Their most recent
charge is that Hoover, who saved the lives of millions
of starving Russians in 1921, did so for the selfish
purpose of gaining Russian mining concessions!

The importance of engineering in a nation’s in-
dustrial progress is recognized far better in Britain,
where all metalworking is classified in the engineer-
ing trade, whose unionized workers are mostly mem-
bers of the great Engineering Trades Union.

Editor Campbell of STEEL magazine of Cleve-
land, Ohio, states that, here in our country, metal-
working is our largest industry, with gross annual
sales of approximately $150 billion, accounting for
43% of all manufacturing employment in this country.
Metalworking sales and employment figures both equal
the total of the next five largest industries: food and
beverages, petroleum and coal products, chemicals,
lumber and furniture, and textiles. That rating should
remove any inferiority complex from the engineering
student’s mind!

When Krushchev visited this country and was
questioned about his threat to “bury” us, he explained
at length that he did not threaten military action --
he intends to “bury” us with economic warfare. En-
gineers who have contributed most to our peacetime
economic growth must realize what state capitalism
under a brutal dictatorship could do to a competetive
free enterprise system, where profits are essential to
encourage private investors to expand production when
possible, thus providing more jobs for a growing popu-
lation.

The First World War raised wages far more in
this country than in any other. The boom of the 20’s
brought more increases. Encouragement of union or-
ganizers by the Federal Government in 1937 greatly
expanded union membership, and the rapidly in-
creasing membership convinced politicians that their
every action which strengthened union powers would
strengthen their votes for re-election -- and that pro-
cess has finally brought us to the point that the
existence of an unrestrained labor union monopoly
cannot be denied. On the other hand, industry has
never been so harassed by anti—trust suits, on the theory
that almost any merger lessens competition in some
manner, regardless of cost reduction in selling, pro-
duction, or through greater quantity purchasing power.
Who can name any other industrial nation where there
is any similar constant and continuous attack on
domestic industry -- or where the employer has been
made subject to a union leader’s dictates in employee
relations? In Red Russia, the union leader who called
a strike would sink out of sight before he could move!
What other industrial nation ever encouraged its do-
mestic industries to set up plants in foreign countries,
when it is a mathematical certainty that the low wages
in other countries will take jobs away from domestic
workers and create new jobs for foreign workers?

This is international socialism, although our citi-
zens have never endorsed national socialism in a na-
tional election!

There are plants in this country which, through
mass-production methods provided to meet the de-
mands of our mass markets, can compete with primi-
tive production in Japan, but what happens if the
Japanese plant is given free trade access to our do-
mestic market, plus financial aid from any one of our
foreign aid agencies, enabling the Japanese plant
to expand and adopt mass-production methods? Of
course, they will “bury” our domestic plants, having
no handicap except the extra freight cost of ocean
transport. Their ocean freight cost handicap in ship-
ping to us becomes our handicap when we ship ex-
ports to other countries and other continents nearer
to their shores than to ours.

In the postwar period, our government agencies
in charge of foreign aid have spent billions of our tax-
payers’ money to build up the economic strength of
foreign competitors. Foreign aid, which subsidizes our
competitors but increases the tax load“ on our domestic
workers and investors, must be stopped to prevent
further weakening of our dollar and increasing domes-
tic unemployment. Even friendly foreign experts have
pointed out that our country is growing weak inter-

nationally, and that if they become victims of a.

communist war of agression, they need our great U. S.
productive capacity to win again - just as they did
in World Wars I and II.

During World War II and for several years after,
American exports of machinery and food went to

28

the wartorn countries, sometimes as commercial sales.
But, when foreign countries reached the point where
they could produce their own requirements, many of
our exports were shut out completely by various do-
mestic restrictions, such as currency in Britain and
import quotas in France, as examples. During that
period when our products were barred, their manu-
facturers suffered no competition from us; and many
of them copied our designs, which saved them all of
the costs of research, experimenting, and designing.
With such advantages, they are taking over more and
more of our export trade. Their invasion of our do-
mestic markets is becoming more evident every day,
with such drastic results that our steel production
dropped from 95% to 75% in less than a month, and
is now below 60%.

Some small producers dropped almost overnight
from six-day, three-shift operating to three days a
week. In Western Europe, steel mills are running at
capacity and requiring their home customers to place
orders ten months in advance of desired delivery
date.

When you buy a product manufactured in this
country, out of every dollar of its retail cost, on the
average, 24c goes back to pay all taxes accumulated
on every particle of matter and every service which
goes into the finished product to buy -- and most of
that 24c goes out in wages and salaries to local, state,
and federal payrolls! The manufacturing property
costs, such as interest, depreciation, and net profit to
the producer (which average less than 6c on the dollar),
total 15c, leaving 61c to pay accumulated labor costs
for workers in the mines, the forests, or the fields, as
the material needed for the finished article was pro-
duced; and also to pay the workers who furnish the
utility services, such as light, heat, power, water, etc.
Out of every dollar you pay at retail, more than 60c
goes back in wages and salaries to each and every
one of the people who helped to produce your pur-
chased article. With low-wage European competition,
the labor costs would be one-fourth, or around 15%
if they are as efficient as we are -- and that means
that our U. S. manufacturers must cut out 45c in
labor spent on that one-dollar article to compete
against such imports which are sold here.

Neither we nor the Western Europeans can com-
pete with Japan and Hong Kong, where wages would
require only 6c against our wage costs of file, and
corresponding European wage costs of 15c.

From every dollar spent here for a low-wage,
foreign-made product, our government does not get
the 24c in taxes received if the product were made
here, and, obviously, tax rates must be increased on
the decreased production to maintain the tax total.
Then the economic law of diminishing returns raises
i.ts ugly head!

Mr. John S. Knight, who writes the “Editor’s
Notebook,” which is published in such papers as THE

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

DETROIT FREE PRESS and THE MIAMI
HERALD, made this observation on March 20th:

“It is ironic to read how the industrialists and
labor leaders are bellowing about the competition from
foreign-made products.

“Col. Willard F. Rockwell is presently asserting
that the United States, through foreign aid, has fi-
nanced the resurgence of foreign industry which in
turn is now threatening the existence of ‘corresponding
industry in this country.’

“And some time ago, Walter Reuther was actually
talking like a McKinley Republican in advocating
what would be in effect a protective tariff to save
jobs in the automotive industry.

“So far as we know, Colonel Rockwell may al-
ways have been opposed to foreign aid. But most of
our leading manufacturers, businessmen and labor
leaders have long been advocates of more and more
foreign aid, even though they were unwittingly cutting
their own throats.

“Congress has now under consideration the Presi-
dent’s request for $4.1 billion in foreign aid. In addition,
he is proposing a new International Development As-
sociation to make ‘soft’ loans to underdeveloped nations.

“One day the American people will get a bellyful
of $40 million Korean fertilizer plants which lack
electric power to operate; overbuilt grain elevators in
India, and unrealistic highways in Vietnam.

“Foreign aid began as a compassionate measure
to help rebuild wartorn Europe. Now that Europe is
highly prosperous, and outselling U. S. products in
many markets, the new philosophy is that we must
develop the world at our taxpayers’ expense.

“Just let any scrubby little nation yell ‘Com-
munism,” and we’re hooked. The theory‘ is that a poor
country can buy more of our goods if it suddenly
becomes rich.

, “But that’s not what happened in Europe and
Japan. The people buy more cheaply at home and
their manufacturers flood the U. S. with cars, fishing
tackle, cameras and hundreds of other products. —

"This is really hurting business and jobs in
America. But we asked for it.”

We have some real friends in Europe who now
recognize this country faced great dangers because of
our enormous military expenditures, our unbalanced
budgets (which are a prime cause of inflation), our
imbalance in international trade, and our weakening
dollar, which, only a few years ago, was the world’s
standard. But all free Europe realizes that, if our
country becomes less powerful than Russia, world
communism will rise beyond restraint. The British
newspaper DAILY MAIL, recently warned its own
people and all Europeans with these words:

“Without generous dollar aid (from the U. S.),
Europe’s present prosperity would have been impos-
sible, having achieved it, she (Europe) is now, wit-
tingly or not, turning it against her benefactor. America

must expect intensiiied competition everywhere . . . ”
Any U. S. manufacturers who do not expect intensified
competition are in the position of “sitting ducks.”

There is an economic law of diminishing returns,
and now that we have the highest tax load in history,
that law will impede our recovery. Canada demonstra-
ted lately that lower tax rates can result in higher
government tax income. Several European countries
have taken similar action, with similar results.

Congress recently cut in half the 20% excise tax
on customers’ restaurant bills where entertainment was
furnished, and immediately one big restaurant in San
Francisco announced it would employ 19 musicians to
furnish entertainment which had been cut out when
the 20% tax was imposed. Can you imagine what
would happen to our present growing unemployment,
if taxes were cut all around?

Politicians and economic theorists can spin many
beautiful dreams, but if we apply engineering principles
in anlyzing their fine theories, many false theories will
be exposed, simply because they fall apart under
mathematical analysis. The ancient time-worn theory
that we can gain individual security by surrendering
our personal freedom to a self-anoited, power-grabbing
centralized government, is now being crushed under a
load of massive federal debt and bureaucratic injustices.
Recalling Woodrow Wilson’s statement that “Liberty
has never come from the government . . . the history of
liberty is the history or the limitations of governmental
power, not the increase of it.”

The frightening resemblance of our country‘s pre-
sent situation to that of ancient Rome in the Second
Century may be drawn from Will Durant’s HISTORY
OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. In the Second Century,
Rome had attained such a peak of wealth, splendor
and power that its citizens believed themselves to
be secure from any earthly menace, but, to quote

6.

Durant: . amid the prosperity that made Rome
brilliant in the Second Centruy, all the seeds were
germinating for the crisis that was to bring her ruin
in the Third Century. Private and local independence,
initiative and pride withered as the power of the
state increased. The wealth of the nation was drained
away by ever-rising taxation to support a self-multiply-
ing bureaucracy. Government expenditures and doles
exhausted the treasury and debased the currency.”

The parallels between the Roman situation and
our country’s present situation cannot be ignored, and
if they do not impel us to take action and correct our
course while it is still in our control, we shall have
no one to blame but ourselves.

There may be a shortage of engineers in our
country now, but if our engineers were to become the
nucleus of movement to recover our lost freedoms and
restore our self-reliance and faith in our constitutional
system of government, we can surely resume our
progress and go forward to greater achievements than
the human mind has ever conceived.

Thermal
Protection
Systems

BY ROBERT S. FATYOL

With the development of rocket propulsion systems
enabling speeds many times greater than the speed of
sound, a new factor has arisen for consideration in the
design and construction of airframe components. This
factor is extremely high operating temperatures. Air-
frame materials, now, must not only be selected for
their mechanical properties, but also for their thermal
properties. Airframe components designed on this basis
are defined as “thermal protection systems.”

In thermal protection design the greatest difficulty
arises from the need of exacting combinations of prop-
erties. These required combinations are often such “op-
posites” as high strength and low density; high resist-
ance to temperature and high resistance to shock and
oxidation.

Thermal protection systems for flight vehicles may
be divided into two general categories, based on the
method for handling the aerodynamic heat input.

1. Absorptive systems, which store most of the heat

acquired.

2. Radiative systems, which transfer most of the

heat -directly to the atmosphere.

The absorptive systems can be designed to with-
stand extremely high aerodynamic heat inputs without
bringing the interior of the structure to a high temp-
erature. However, since the incident heat flux is dis-
sipated, in part, by melting or vaporizing the surface,
weight considerations become important. This limits the
absorptive systems to short time use or pulse heating.

A few specific types of absorptive thermal protec-
tion systems are: (1) Heavy wall heat sink systems;
(2) Ablation systems; (3) Sublimation systems; (4-)
Transpiration systems. Each of these absorptive systems

will be thoroughly.discussed later in the article.
A heat sink system is a “low temperature” system

operating below the melting temperature of the mate-

rial. It absorbs heat by conduction from the surface,
and works effectively only if the heat flux is no greater
than can be accommodated by conduction.

Heavy-wall heat sink systems require materials
which have a high heat diffusivity. Heat diffusivity is
the ability of a material to conduct heat from the outer
or aerodynamic surface’ to the interior of the wall. This
property depends on thermal conductivity and specific
heat of the material. Since none of the potential heat
sink materials have high values in both properties, the
order of suitability of the materials is determined by
high values of one or the other property.

The yardstick for the efficiency of the heat sink
system, as well as all the absorptive systems, is called
the effective heat capacity, Q. It is defined as the aero-
dynamic heat input (BTU/sq. ft.), divided by the
weight of the material required for thremal protection.

To prevent the melting of the sink walls under
high heat flux, the wall thickness must be increased to
provide the required heat capacity. As the walls are
made thicker for higher aerodynamic heat inputs, a
limit is finally reached due to the material’s heat diffus-
ivity. Beyond this limit a corresponding increase in
heat flux capability does not occur with an increase in
the wall thickness.

On the basis of heat diffusivity, the best materials
for heavy-wall heat sinks are graphite, molybdenum,
copper, beryllium, and beryllium oxide. Copper has high
heat flux capacity and a low Q value; beryllium, beryl-

lium oxide and graphite have very high heat flux ca-
pacities but low thermal conductivities, and molybde-
num offers moderate values in both heat flux capacity
and thermal conductivity.

Unfortunately, beryllium oxide and graphite, which
have high heat flux capability along with light weight
construction, are highly brittle and difficult to fabricate.

Molybdenum is the least suitable because its poor
combinations of thermal properties result in very heavy
weight for thermal protection.

Beryllium and molybdenum are the only materials
acceptable at the present time for short time applica-
tions.

In an ablation system an ablating mixture of or-
ganic and inorganic materials, (for example, plastics
with glass fibers), having activation temperatures be-
tween 2,000 F. and 4,000 F. are applied to the aero-
dynamic surfaces. If the heat flux it encounters in use
is well below the activation temperature, the mixture
serves as an insulation and as low-grade heat sink. Un-
der these circumstances, the mixture is said to behave
as “transulation” or non-steady-state insulation. With
higher heat flux pulses, the activation temperature is
reached and decomposition of the ablating mixture be-
gins. The rate of ablation automatically adjusts to the
rate of the aerodynamic heat input. When the heating
rate increases there is a corresponding increase in the
ablation process without any increase in surface temp-
erature.

As the gaseous products of ablation enter the ex-
tremely hot boundary layer further decomposition and
dissociation to a plasma-like state occurs, with a coil-
sequent very high heat absorption. The average temp-
erature of the hot gas layer is lowered due to the result-
ing “blanket” cooling effect. Heat transfer is, however,

greatly decreased if the “blanket” effect is disturbed by
turbulent air streams.

Ideal sublimation materials have a high heat of
sublimation, low conductivity, and the ability to sub-
lime without entering into a liquid state. Since a high
heat flux is required to activate sublimation systems,
they are primarily high-flux systems. In intermediate
flux levels heat penetration causes thermal shock, which
destroys the subliming material. The material should
also sublime faster than the rate of heat transfer to the
interior region.

Graphite has the highest heat of sublimation of all
materials being considered. However, its relatively rapid
oxidation at high temperatures, coupled with high con-
ductivity, creates problems for sublimation system ap-
plications. The wall thickness depends upon the interior
of the structural wall, due to its high conductivity, rath-
er than the amount of wall thickness vaporized.

In transpiration cooling systems, a gas of the same
composition as the exterior streams is pumped through
a porous skin. As the gas is ejected from the pores, it
cools down the hot boundary layers by a blocking ac-
tion. The potential heat flux limit is very high and
depends primarily on the pumping rate and volumetric
heat capacity of the gas coolant.

The absorptive systems are best suited for vehicles
exposed to pulse heating. The specific type of absorp-
tive systems, heavy wall heat sink systems, ablation sys-
tems, sublimation systems, and transpiration systems
must be chosen for the particular environmental condi-
tions affecting the vehicle.

Radiative systems can be used under pulse heating
conditions only if the maximum heat flux encountered
does not exceed the melting point of the material be-
ing used. However, the best use for such systems are

conditions with long-time exposure of steady-state
heating.

Radiative systems can be divided into three spe-
cific types: (1) Hot structures; (2) Hot structures plus
insulation; (3) Insulated radiative heat shields. The
load-bearing structure in the hot structure system oper-
ates at the skin temperature and dissipates the heat
solely by radiaion. Its efficiency is related to the emis-
sivity of the skin. The hot structure plus insulation dif-
fers from the hot structure in that insulation is placed
behind the load-bearing structure to keep the interior
temperature down. The insulated radiative heat shield
systems differs from both the hot structure and the hot

structure plus insulation in that it utilizes a heat shield
which is not required to support any load. The heat
shield is also insulated from the load-bearing structure
so that the structural‘ members can operate at a cooler
temperature.

Insulated radiation systems in time develop a
steady state heat leakage to the interior when the insu-
lation becomes saturated to heat capacity. Since this
occurs, a heat absorption subsystem must be added to
maintain a cooler internal temperature. A weight pen-
alty is therefore imposed which increases with the ex-
posure time.

Special devices may be used for cooling localized hot-
spots. A liquid metal closed cycle subsystem may be
used to transfer some of the heat to a normally cooler
position, where it is radiated from the surface. A rela-
tively thick leading edge also conducts heat backward
to a cooler position for radiation from the surface. Such
systems cannot remove all the heat from the hotspot,
however they can decrease temperature to the point
where a specific material could be used which would
have been insufficient by itself. These systems are
basically radiative because the heat transfer merely
redistributes the radiative heat load.

Factors which determine the type of radiative ther-
mal protection system a situation calls for are: tempera-
ture level, exposure time, need for cool internal en-
vironment, and the amount of loading. For example,
it is undesirable to use a hot load-supporting structure
composed of dense and low-strength materials if the
loads and temperatures are high. An insulated radiative
shield system makes it possible to use low-temperature
metals which are very efficient for structures. Thin
skins of refractory materials can then be applied to the
external heat shield surface.

The radiative systems, hot structure plus insula-
tion, and radiative heat shields are best suited for
steady-state heating conditions. The specific type of
radiative system for any particular use must be chosen
for its functional aspects.

However, the materials capability at present is
very limited. It is only through concentration on par-
ticular requirements that materials progress can pro-
ceed. The problem of materials not only belongs to the
metallurgists but also to all those who are involved in
the design and construction of vehicles.

FUEL CELLS

Fuel cells came into the news lately, when it
was disclosed that a portable power supply utilizing
fuel cells was being developed for military use. Some
of the advantages claimed for this new power pack
are its light weight of thirty pounds, high output of
two hundred watts at twenty-four volts and silent
operation. Many companies such as General Electric,
Westinghouse, Allis-Chalmers, Chrysler and at least
‘_E‘V€I1lZ€‘6I1 others are devoting much time and money
to fuel cell research.

The basic principle of fuel cells has been known
for some time. As early as 1839, W. Grove demon-
strated the reversal of water electrolysis, the principle
on which most fuel cells operate. Despite repeated ef-
forts to build reliable fuel cells, the problem of dura-
bility was not solved until recent times. A fuel cell is
similiar to other batteries in that chemicals react at
the electrodes to produce electrical energy but, unlike
conventional batteries that store all their chemicals
internally, the fuel cell has fuel fed into it from outside
sources. Thus, the fuel cell will produce electricity
as long as the fuel supply lasts.

Much interest and research has been devoted to
fuel cells because their upper range of efficiency is
between 70% and 90%, whereas the efficiency of a
good diesel engine is only 40% with respect to the total
amount of fuel energy used. Fuel cells have an inherent
advantage over conventional power supplies in that
fuel cells do not operate on a heat cycle which, ac-
cording to the second law of thermodynamics, would
set an upper limit to conversion of 60%.

One of the simplest fuel cells, in principle, is the
ozygen concentration cell. This cell consists of two
electrodes with an electrolyte sandwiched between
which conducts an electric charge in the form of
oxygen ions and also acts as an insulator to electrons.
To create a voltage across the electrodes the oxygen
concentration must be different at the two electrodes.’
In operation, an oxygen molecule after moving through
the porous cathode picks up four electrons at the

junction with the electrolyte and then migrates into
the electrolyte leaving a positive charge at the cathode.
The oxygen ions move through the electrolyte to the
porous anode where they release the extra electrons
and recombine to form oxygen molecules. The extra
electrons at the anode give it a negative charge. If
a load is connected to the two electrodes by an exter-
nal circuit, current will flow.

A more promising and sophisticated type of fuel
cell is the hydrogen-oxygen cell. Hydrogen and oxygen
are fed separately to the cell through special hollow
electrodes. The hydrogen diffuses through the porous
electrode, dissociates with the aid of a catalyst, com-
bines with the hydroxyl ions in the electrolyte to form
water, and then releases two electrons to the anode.
The electrons flow through the external circuit to the
cathode where they combine with oxygen and water
to form hydroxyl ions. Subsequently, the hydroxyl ions

migrate via the electrolyte to the anode to complete
the circuit and allow continuation of the reaction.

The principles discussed above are being used in
nearly all of the fuel cells now under development, al-
though many variations and changes. are being investi-
gated. Air, for example, may be used instead of oxygen
but with a slight loss in output. Hydrogen is still an
expensive and bulky gas to transport; therefore, much
effort has gone into developing practical fuel cells that
will use a cheaper fuel such as ordinary cooking gas.
Other changes such as high temperature cells, solid
selectrolytes, different catalysts, better electrodes, and
pressurized fuel cells are being tried. Many of these
changes increase cell output or efficiency, but cost is
usually raised considerably too. For example, in the
hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell electrical energy output
varies nearly directly with the pressure of the fuel gases
and thus by doubling the pressure the output may be
doubled, but then heavy, costly pressure vessels are also
required.

Common to all fuel cells are the porous, cur-
rent conducting electrodes which allow gases to enter
the cell, but act as a barrier to the electrolyte. To
facilitate the reactions at ambient temperatures the
electrodes, most frequently made of porous nickel or
carbon, are impregnated with a suitable catalyst such
as platinum in the anode and silver or cobalt oxide
in the cathode. Electrodes are usually coated with a very
thin layer of paraffin to help prevent the electrolyte
from drowning the cell.

As the name implies, the consumable-electrode
fuel cell uses a material for the electrode that doubles

OCTOBER I960

as fuel. Both the metal anode and the solid cathode
shaped in the form of rods are fed continuously into
a liquid electrolyte. The cell reactions are very similar
to those in a hydrogen-oxygen cell, but the normal
disadvantage of most cells, electrode deterioration, is
turned into an advantage by being part of the normal
operation.

In the “redox” cell, the fuel and oxygen instead
of reacting directly with each other are made to react
with other substances in “regenerators” that produce
chemical intermediates which in turn generate current
in the cell. The over-all reactions in this cell are also
similiar to the hydrogen-oxygen cell but with proper
choice of “regenerators” the intermediates can cause
the electrode reactions to be not only efficient but also
rapid.

Just how well do present fuel cells compare with
other power sources? For example, if the military
wanted a silent 100-watt power source to be used near
the front lines, the use of motor-generators would be
excluded for reasons of noise, fumes and interference.
A 50 pound hydrogen-air fuel cell operating at ambient
temperatures and atmospheric pressure would require
about 43 pounds of a hydrogen producing solid hydride
to supply enough hydrogen to operate the fuel cell
for a whole month. In contrast, 3,400 pounds of con-
ventional storage batteries would be needed to do the
same job.

Who knows, in a few years you may be able to buy
an electric automobile that utilizes fuel cells. Adver-
tisement for this car will probably read, “The loudest
noise at 60 m. p. h. will be the other cars that you
silently pass.” .

On the riddle of
rolling friction

General Motors is pioneering research into the mystery of energy losses in the rolling ball. With a unique
measuring device (above), investigators have not only confirmed the hypothesis of lmjyv a rolling ball loses
energy (Answer: elastic hysteresis), but have also learned where this lost energy is dissipated (Answer:
in the interior of the material, not on the surface).

The effectiveness of automation depends upon the ingenuity of the scientist and engineer. If
you are about to begin a career in the field of technology you'll benefit yourself by working
where ingenuity and enthusiasm pay off. At General Motors they do, and in a big way.

What is your main interest? GM’s diversification covers many fields. Automotive research,
production engineering and manufacturing, electronics an’d astronautics are just a few. With
so many and varied divisions, GM can offer men who qualify the choice of specialization or
the opportunity to work on vastly different projects.

It all started like this . . .

For thirty centuries men fought—and many died—for the right to vote
for their leaders and their laws in secrecy, without fear or compulsion,
for this is the very heart of freedom. Long ago men voted by casting a
little ball into an urn, as shown above. (Our word “ballot” comes from
this ancient use of the Italian “ballota”—litt1e ball.) Other groups “bal-
loted” with shells and bronze disks of different sizes. The ﬁrst written
ballot was used in Rome in 139 B.C., and in America seventeen hundred
and sixty-eight years later.

All of these early methods of voting had one serious weakness in
common: There was no secrecy for the voter. The “Australian Ballot,”
brought to this country in 1888, did provide a degree of secrecy—but
did not eliminate the possibility of errors either in marking ballots, or
in counting them.

Thomas Edison was a pioneer in engineering a better way of voting,
and his work helped later inventors and engineers. In 1896, the United
States Voting Machine Company of Jamestown, New York, marketed
an improved device which soon was used widely throughout New York
State. This was the parent of our Automatic Voting Machine Division.

In the last election, twenty-ﬁve million men and women voted on
Automatic Voting Machines built by our AVM Division. They knew
their votes could not be thrown out because of the technical errors so
prevalent when paper ballots are used. They also knew there was no
way for anyone to tell how they voted, nor could the ﬁnal count be
tampered with.

It was engineers, of course, who developed our modern Automatic

Forthcoming space exploration
will require exotic fuels and new concepts in
energy conversion to keep men alive and equip-
ment operating for long periods of time beyond
the earth’s atmosphere. Advanced hydrogen sys-
tems recently developed by The Garrett Corpora-
tion have solved this problem of providing the
electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic power, plus
cooling and heating required aboard a satellite or
space capsule during launching, outer space flight
and re-entry.

Besides such spacecraft and missile systems,
other product areas in which Garrett engineers
work include small gas turbine engines, ﬂight
data systems for air and underwater use, nuclear
and solar power systems, cryogenic systems and

controls, and air conditioning and pressurization
systems for conventional aircraft and advanced
flight vehicles.

Such diversity of interest not only makes work
more interesting at Garrett, but gives the engineer
an opportunity to increase his knowledge and
chances for responsibility and advancement.

An orientation program lasting a period of
months is also available -for the newly graduated
engineer, working on assignments with experi-
enced engineers in laboratory, preliminary design
and development projects. In this way his most
profitable area of interest can be found.

BIG BOLTS

It took a little camera magic to make
a perch for the two young ladies out
of a high strength bolt. Shown here
at ten times actual size, the bolt is used
by construction engineers for technical
and cost cutting features in the erec-
tion of structural steel. Rows of spe-
cially designed knurles are formed on
the shank between the shank and
the thread section. The knurles are
rolled into the shank in a spiral pat-
tern to reduce the driving load and to
produce a body bound fit when the
fastener is driven or wrenchecl into
place.

CHANNEL CHAMBER

A new concept in design has been in-
corporated into the construction of
thrus-t chambers for liquid fueled rock-
ets. The thrust chamber! is made up of
“U’ channels sandwiched between thin
steel walls. About 100,000 spot welds
insure close fit and hold dimensional
and configuration requirements. In
operation, these channels will have
fuel circulated through them before
being ignited and thus lower chamber
temperature.

TRIMMER CAPACITOR

A new miniature trimmer capacitor
that provides linear tuning at the rate
of .4 micromicrofarads per turn has
been developed by the Corning Glass
Works. Described as having the finest
tuning capabilities now available, it
will have applications in systems re-
quiring high quality and small size,
such as airborne transmitters, compu-
ters and communications receivers.

COMBUSTION PRESSURES
Combustion pressures in all cylinders
of an engine can now be shown on an
ocilloscope or other recording device.
The Kistler Instrument Corporation has ¢.p\n,;---.._.,(\—w..‘...;
developed a miniature quartz crystal
pickup that can be mounted in a modi-
fied spark plug. With no mechanical
modifications to an engine required,
the pickup measures severe surface
ignition, detonation pressure and de-
tects borderline knocks in unmodified
internal combustion engines.

VIBRATION TESTING
Boeing Aircraft Company has begun
comprehensive experiments to deter-
mine effects of low frequency vibra-
tions on human performance. Vibra-
tions, produced by a hydraulic cylin-
__ l _ der, will be between one and thirty
IT!“-"""""-"r " "“"" cycles per second and with ampli-
tudes up to ten inches at the lowest
} frequencies and only about five hund-

redths of an inch in the upper levels.
The purpose of the program is to
study the effects of vibration on per-
formance of crewmen who will man
aircraft and space vehicles of the
future.

We’ve been told frequently that engineering graduates are attracted to a
company our size because of an honest and understandable desire to be
“a big ﬁsh in a little pond”. Perhaps others prefer to think of the future as
the challenge of “swimming up—stream”.

We believe that Sikorsky Aircraft is actually the “right—sized stream” for
young engineers who would enjoy diversiﬁed, small-group activities, as
well as stature opportunities in a ﬁeld that is not limited nor professionally
conﬁning. Sikorsky Aircraft is the company which pioneered the modern
helicopter; and our ﬁeld today is recognized as one of the broadest and most
challenging in the entire aircraft industry.

Because of this, we can offer stimulating experiences in an ideal environ-
ment. Work associations could include joining an eleclronic team of twenty
to thirty associates—or——working with a highly selective group of four or
ﬁve on interesting problems of rad1'a1'[on,, inslrumenlalion, auto pilolage,
automatic stabili2ali0n., etc.

And what of your future?

That, of course, involves your own potential for growth. As
a far-sighted company, we’re more than willing to help you
meet the challenge of “going up-stream”!

Some years ago when the Navy
football team was playing the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin at Madison, the
game was hard fought and a number
of penalties were called, most of
them against the Navy. Sitting di-
rectly back of us were four Waves,
who did not take kindly to these
Navy setbacks. After one 15-yard
penalty, a Wave demanded, “What’s
it for this time?”

“Illegal use of hands,” I told her.

“Wouldn’t you know it?” she
cried. “That’s the Navy for you
everytime ! ”

“You were away without official
leave,” his superior barked. “Why?”

“Well, sir,” the harrassed private
began, “my first day in the Army we
were issued combs, and that after-
noon all my hair was cut off. The
next morning they issued us tooth
brushes, and that afternoon the den-
tist pulled six of my teeth. The fol-
lowing day, I was issued an athletic
supporter. That’s when I went

AWOL.”

Already engineers working with
nuclear power have learned that only
utmost purity of materials and metic-
ulous accuracy in manufacture can be
tolerated in a reactor. Steels for the
reactors and reactor vessels are checked
for make-up and molecular structure
with photomicrography and x-ray dif-
fraction. Welds are proved sound and
moderators ﬂawless with radiography.
And stresses likely to occur are studied
in advance with photo—elastic stress
analysis.

In this new-day industry, as in any
ﬁeld on which you set your sights,
photography plays a part in making a
better product, in producing it easier,
in selling it faster. It cuts costs and
saves time all along the line.

So, in whatever you plan to do, take
full advantage of all the ways photog-
raphy can help.

Several surveys indicate that salary is
not the primary contributor to job
satisfaction. Nevertheless, salary con-
siderations will certainly play a big
part in your evaluation of career op-
portunities. Perhaps an insight into the
salary policies of a large employer of
engineers like General Electric will
help you focus your personal salary
objectives.

Salary———a most individual and per-
sonal aspect of your job—is difﬁcult to
discuss in general terms. While recog-
nizing this, Mr. Case has tried answering
as directly as possible some of your
questions concerning salary:

Q Mr. Case, what starting salary does
your company pay graduate engineers?

A Well, you know as well as I that
graduates’ starting salaries are greatly
inﬂuenced by the current demand for
engineering talent. This demand es-
tablishes a range of “going rates” for
engineering graduates which is no doubt
widely known on your campus. Be-
cause General Electric seeks outstand-
ing men, G—E starting salaries for these
candidates lie in the upper part of the
range of “going rates.” And within
General Electric’s range of starting sal-
aries, each candidate’s ability and
potential are carefully evaluated to de-
termine his individual starting salary.

Q How do you go about evaluating
my ability and potential value to your
company?

A We evaluate each individual in the
light of information available to us:

type of degree; demonstrated scho1ar- '

ship; extra-curricular contributions; work
experience; and personal qualities as
appraised by interviewers and faculty
members. These considerations deter-
mine where within G.E.’s current sal-
ary range the engineer’s starting salary
will be established.

One of a series

Interview with

General Electric’s Byron A. Case
Manager_Employee Compensation Service

Your Salary

at General Electric

Q When could I expect my first salary
increase from General Electric and how
much would it be?

A Whether a man is recruited for a
speciﬁc job or for one of the principal
training programs for engineers——the
Engineering and Science Program, the
Manufacturing Training Program, or
the Technical Marketing Program—his
individual performance and salary are
reviewed at least once a year.

For engineers one year out of col-
lege, our recent experience indicates a
ﬁrst—year salary increase between 6 and
15 percent. This percentage spread re-
ﬂects the individual’s job performance
and his demonstrated capacity to do
more difﬁcult work. So you see, salary
adjustments reﬂect individual perform-
ance even at the earliest stages of
professional development. And this
emphasis on performance increases
as experience and general competence
increase.

Q How much can I expect to be making
after five years with General Electric?

A As I just mentioned, ability has a
sharply increasing inﬂuence on your
salary, so you have a great deal of per-
sonal control over the answer to your
question.

It may be helpful to look at the cur-
rent salaries of all General Electric
technical-college graduates who re-
ceived their bachelor’s degrees in 1954
(and now have ﬁve years’ experience).
Their current median salary, reﬂect-
ing both merit and economic changes,
is about 70 percent above the 1954
median starting rate. Current salaries
for outstanding engineers from this

class are more than double the 1954
median starting rates and, in some
cases, are three or four times as great.

Q What kinds of benefit programs
does your company offer, Mr. Case?

A Since I must be brief, I shall merely
outline the many General Electric em-

ployee beneﬁt programs. These include D

a liberal pension plan, insurance plans,
an emergency aid plan, employee dis-
counts, and educational assistance pro-
grams.

The General Electric Insurance Plan
has been widely hailed as a “pace
setter” in American industry. In addi-
tion to helping employees and their
families meet ordinary medical expen-
ses, the Plan also affords protection
against the expenses of “catastrophic”
accidents and illnesses which can wipe
out personal savings and put a family
deeply in debt. Additional coverages in-
clude life insurance, accidental death
insurance, and maternity beneﬁts.

Our newest plan is the Savings and
Security Program which permits em-
ployees to invest up to six percent of
their earnings in U.S. Savings Bonds
or in combinations of Bonds and Gen-
eral Electric stock. These savings are
supplemented by a Company Propor-
tionate Payment equal to 50 percent
of the employee’s investment, subject
to a prescribed holding period.

This issue of the SKYSCRAPER
ENGINEER, the first. of the school
year, includes articles from a wide
range of interests by several veteran
contributors.

Terminal City, the terminal area
of New York’s Idlewild Airport,
covers 655 acres of ground and
handles 16,175 passengers per day.
Richard Le Donne describes the
complexity of this marvelously ef-
ficient control and service area for
27 airlines.

This summer, the wind tunnel in
Engineering Hall was used for a
research project by Bell Aero
Systems. Dick Johnston, in his
article “Flutter Research at Pitt.,”
explains the concept of “artificial
mass” used by the engineers on this
project to control the flutter
characteristics of an airplane wing.
This flutter problem is very signifi-
cant in the design of supersonic
planes of all types.

Fuel cells have caught the ima-
gination of the technically aware
in the last few years. Their light
weight and high output make them
ideal for space research, military,
and general scientific application.
John Beattie explores the principles
of fuel cells and explains some of

Richard A. LeDonne

the important specific types.

Ram Introduction, by increasing
the volumetric efficiency of a piston
engine, yields increased horsepower.
The experimenter reports an in-
crease of thirty horsepower due to
ram tubes, or “High Preformance
Pipes,” as Joe Lance has entitled
his article.

“Thermal Protection Systems,”
written by Robert F atyol, describes
the processes of heat transfer used
for high flux rates encountered dur-
ing high speed flight. Three in-
teresting processes, Transpiration,
Sublimation, and Ablation, are re-
lated to different thermal protective
requirements in this article.

The ability to express one’s
thoughts on paper is an attribute es-
sential to the successful engineer.
Professor Daniel Marder, head of
the University’s Technical Writing
Course provides Pitt’s engineers with
the essentials necessary to develop
the ability of technical expression.
In his article he supplements the
knowledge and ability gained in the
technical writing course by providing
interesting additional thoughts on,
“Communicating Technical Ideas.”

Why College men
choose Careers
with Du Pont

Every year, several hundred new college graduates choose
Du Pont. Many Masters and Ph.D.’s do, too.

From time to time we learn from recent graduates the
factors which led to their decision to join this company. They
cite more than half a dozen reasons. Here are four of the most
important:

OPPORTUNITY AND RECOGNITION

They were aware that college-trained beginners
go right to work with men who have achieved.

For example, research chemists work with individuals who’ve
done successful research. New engineers work with pros, some of
whom have designed new plants, or devised new manufacturing
methods, or distinguished themselves in some other way. And other
graduates, with B.A. or M.B.A. degrees, go to work with leaders
who’ve been successful in Sales or Advertising or Treasurer’s, or
another of Du Pont’s many departments.

They had been told—and rightly—that DuPont rewards indi-
vidual achievement. And they were eager to start achieving.

RESEARCH CREATES NEW PRODUCTS;
NEW PRODUCTS CREATE NEW JOBS

Men like working for a company that believes in
research, enough to invest in it...$90 million a year!

The fact is that important new products come from DuPont
laboratories and go to Du Pont manufacturing plants with frequency.

Here are but a few since World War II: “Orlon”* acrylic ﬁber
followed nylon (soon after the war). Then came “Dacron”* poly-
ester ﬁber, “Mylar”* polyester ﬁlm, “Lucite”* acrylic lacquer and
“Delrin”* acetal resin.

These, and many others, have created thousands of new jobs. . .in
research, manufacturing, sales . . . in fact, in all Du Pont departments.

DU PONT BACKS EMPLOYEES WITH HUGE INVESTMENT
New graduates feel that every facility is provided for doing the job well.

Last year, DuPont’s operating investment per employee was
$32,500. Since much of this was expended to provide the most
modern and best of equipment to work with, it further increases
the chance for individual achievement.

This applies to men in lab, plant and office.

DUPONT PROVIDES STEADY EMPLOYMENT
Career seekers appreciate the importance of security.

Today, the average annual turnover rate at DuPont is less
than one-third that of industry nationally.

These, and many other reasons, draw new talent to Du Pont each year.

Prospective graduates, M.S.’s and Ph.D.’s interested in learning
more about job opportunities at Du Pont are urged to see their Place-
ment Counselor, or to write direct to E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.

(Inc.). They should tell us the course they are majoring in so we can
send literature that is most appropriate.

A Message
From fhe Dean

G. R. Fitterer

NOTHING IN EDUCATION IS SO ASTONISHING AS THE AMOUNT OF
IGNORANCE IT ACCUMULATES IN THE FORM OF FACTS.
——Hem~y Adams

How true! Why is it that we frequently encounter a very intelligent and
successful man without a college education, who not only seems to comprehend the
most complicated situation but proves that he does, by making some ingenious sug-
gestion regarding it. At the same time, one often encounters persons with college
degrees, who seem to be completely ignorant of the same situation and insist on
protecting their ignorance by having nothing to say. Wherein lies the difference?

No one can become educated unless they are curious. Inherent curiosity is
an absolutely essential ingredient of success. It often is the only distinction between
the honor student and the one who fails. By inherent curiosity is meant an unwill-
ingness to accept facts without a complete review of their significance, their inter-
relationships and the underlying principles by which they are controlled. If one
approaches his college education with the simple desire to accumulate facts without
an understanding of the controlling theory, then one is accumulating ignorance
because he soon finds that he has forgotten the facts and he is left with nothing.
He is not an educated man. Also, sometimes the “facts” are wrong.

Translated into engineering education, this means that one should not merely
seek a formula into which he can “plug” data to obtain an answer. This soon be-
comes hysteria. One can even “plug” data into the wrong formula. None of this
has any place in engineering education. One must have a mastery over the facts
through a complete knowledge of the theory. This can only be attained by the
curious.

The successful engineers have inquiring minds throughout their lives.
