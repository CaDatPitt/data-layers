revolution in space

This amazing structure symbolizes the outer space theme for this year’s Century 21 International Exposition in
Seattle, Washington. Called the Space Needle, it soars 600 feet into the air on three steel legs, tapers to a slim
waist atthe 373-ft. mark,then ﬂares out slightlyto the 500-ft. level, and is crowned by a mezzanine,observation deck,
and a 260-seat restaurant that revolves slowly (one complete revolution an hour) while patrons enjoy their meals.

The Space Needle is a combination of sheer audacity and imagination with 3,500 tons of steel. Steel was
chosen because it would be faster to erect, stronger per unit area, quickly available. A relatively new type of
structural carbon steel called A36 was used because its greater strength (about 10%) permits higher design
stresses, atthe sametime maintaining factors of safety, and because it could be easily welded. This is an example
of the exciting materials and challenging projects engineers will find at United States Steel.

WHERE WILL YOU BE IN I966?

on.

WILL YOU BE ONE OF THE CROWD OR WILL YOU BE MOVING AHEAD?

We recently learned of “the engineers’ plateau.” It seems to come around
three to five years after graduation, at the time when the next move up
the business ladder means taking on some management responsibility.
Some engineers—too many—do not break through.

We learned about it when We discovered that most of our part-time
MBA students are engineers who see our program as a tool to help them
pass this barrier. They study with us at night, and Work during the day.
They are doing it the hard Way because they want to move up to more
challenging jobs.

As you look ahead, consider enrolling for a Master of Business Admin-
istration before you start on that job. It takes only eleven months (three
terms) and engineering gives you a good background for the MBA. Of
course, it costs something, but it is a good investment. The average start-
ing salary of an engineer with a Pitt MBA last year was $1,152 higher

than the national average for engineers Without this extra preparation. .
There are programs in:

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

A Message From the Dean

By Dr. G. R. Fitterer

We engineers need a new name for our profession. A
great portion of the American public has some misconcep-
tion of a career in engineering. The reason for this is
partly that the various segments of the press have used
the name “engineer” to describe all manner of activities.

Some one recently pointed out that years ago janitors
promoted themselves to building superintendents, but
now have risen to custodial engineers. Lobbyists in Wash-
ington are now legislative engineers. Apparently the Pied
Piper would be an extermination engineer today. Of
course, for many years, we have had unionized skilled
labor groups such as the stationary and locomotive engi-
neers.

Our press has further found it useful to speak of crim-
inals who engineered a robbery or a murder. Our former
Dean Holbrook used to tell of a college which actually
granted a degree in Mortuary Engineering.

Simultaneously, with the trends, the credit for a great
many of our engineering advancements has been given to
the scientists. According to the press, all discoveries are
being made by men of science. Atomic power, rocketry,
space travel, jet travel, etc. are all engineering develop-
ments. Many people are surprised to learn that there are
engineering sciences which are just as fundamental in
many respects as the natural sciences.

APRIL 1962

Natural scientists are observers of natural phenomena
and, as such, they discover many new characteristics of
nature which are useful to the engineering scientist. Some
natural scientists have a desire to apply their knowledge
to the development of something useful to mankind.
VVhen they desire to apply science, they would perform
their functions better if they had studied the engineering
sciences in addition to the natural sciences. The reason
for this is that the engineering scientist not only studies
the natural sciences to considerable depth but he also
has become proﬁcient in certain engineering sciences. In
doing so, he has learned how to direct and control the
natural phenomena for use by mankind. Often in his
research for control methods, the engineering scientist
becomes intrigued with natural phenomena and discovers
some secret of nature. In this event, he temporarily be-
comes a natural scientist. A

Thus it may be seen that the natural sciences and the
engineering sciences are both needed and often function
together as a team. However, both are scientists, never-
theless. Until a better name for the profession is devised,
the title, “engineering science” should be used. However,
the differences between the education of the natural sci-
entist and the engineering scientist should be recognized
and maintained. Today, many engineering colleges are
forgetting this difference and in their passion to develop
a graduate school and obtain research contracts they have
dropped or watered-down, many of the most useful engi-
neering science courses. The resulting graduates are more
nearly natural scientists that engineering scientists.

Our new plastic stops

a 30—cal. bullet cold
(he hopes)

That plastic sheet is a scant 5/8"
thick. But it’ll stop a bullet in its
tracks. Splaaaat.

Our model is actually one of the
inventors, John J. Aclin. He knows
it's infallibly bulletproof (but still
finds the concept a bit hard to
believe). It does work. Really. And
the plastic scales in at 1/7 the weight
of steel.

In addition to our bullet-stopping
plastic, we're working on quite a few
other “unbelievable” projects.

Like converting common clay into
alumina (already a laboratory reality,
now in the pilot plant stage).

Like a shotgun barrel made by

winding 500 miles of glass fiber
around athin steel liner(now bagging
its share of game around the world).

Like developing more powerful
liquid missile fuels (will Olin’s hydra-
zine get us to the moon?).

And getting back to Earth, a chem-
ical agent that arrests grass growth
(a long range project that lawn own-
ers are rooting for).

El Before the interview, stop in
your Placement Oﬁice and re-
view in some detail the literature
explaining Koppers diversiﬁed line
of products and services. Become
familiar with Koppers eight operat-
ing divisions and the particular con-
tribution each makes to industry.

[2 Try to determine as speciﬁcally
as you can the type of work
that seems to interest you most.
Then question the interviewer as to
how that type of work ﬁts into
Koppers many activities. If, like
many graduates, you ﬁnd that your
interests cover many areas of work,
tell the interviewer. You’ll ﬁnd that
he will understand your problem

How to get the
most out of a
job interview:

Every company that interviews col-
lege students is interested in hiring
students with high potential. But
matching the right man with the right
company is a complex assignment.
How can you know which company
you should join? You can’t know for
sure, but you can get a reasonably
accurate indication if you make the
most of your campus interview. Be-
low are a few suggestions to assist you
in making such an interview with
Koppers more worthwhile and produc-
tive for you.

and may be of help in deciding on
the kind of “Koppers opportunity”
for which you would be best suited.

El Be prepared to outline your
accomplishments. He will be in-
terested in your extra-curricular ac-
tivities as well as your scholastic
achievement. Point out any part-
time or summer experience which
you may have had. If you can effec-
tively communicate to the inter-
viewer your background and inter-
ests, both you and he will be better
able to decide whether or not this
is the right opportunity for you.

Review with the interviewer
Koppers on-the-job training
program. This program is designed

to allow you to make an immediate
and recognizable contribution. You
go to wor/a—you don’t return to the
classroom for training. You will be
working on projects that will permit
you to apply the knowledge you have
gained through your college training,
while at the same time you will be
furthering your knowledge and un-
derstanding of your ﬁeld.

Ask the interviewer about job

location, military policy, educa-
tional assistance policy, and any
other questions which you may have
about the Company. He will be
happy to provide any information he
can to assist you in getting the most
from your Koppers interview.

STAFF ENGINEERS
GATHER ALL THE PIECES

By WALTER H. RUPP, P.E.

WALTER H. RUPP, was born and raised in Pittsburgh,
graduating from the University of Pittsburgh in 1930
with high honors in chemical engineering. ]VIr. Rupp was
a staﬁ engineer at ESSO Research and Engineering Com-
pany’s oﬁices in Florham Park, New jersey, until he be-
came head of a new engineering information center in
January of 1962.

Partly as a result of his work at the new Fawley, Eng-
land reﬁnery, which was the first reﬁnery designed from
the start to be free of air pollution, Mr. Rupp became
co-author of an air pollution handbook published in
August, 1956.

His engineering patents number about 36 now, cover-
ing various oil reﬁnery practices. Among his chief spare
time interests are, economics, business finance, education,
relationship of business and religion, writing and reducing
technical results to easily understandable terms for all.

Mr. Rupp was chairman of Northern New Jersey Fund
raising campaign in 1960 for Pitt’s school of Engineering
and Mines.

This article takes a somewhat diﬂerent and informal
approach to telling the story of a “crossroads engineer”—
the staﬁ engine-er. It is written from the viewpoint of how
a large research and engineering company practices in-
dustrial management of engineers by engineers.

The staﬁ engineer lives at the crossroads where civil,
chemical, electrical, mechanical, and metallurgical engi-
neering and business paths cross. He is active in admin-
istrative policy and coordination matters, supported by
his engineering background.

THE PROBLEM
Have you ever tried to explain your daily work to a
fourteen year old boy? Well, try it and meet a challenge!

Their questions and remarks are razor sharp for concise-
ness and clarity. Their discernment is surprising and is
uncluttered by complicated inhibitions. Thus——

Johnny says, “Well, Dad, tell me what you do.”

Dad replies, “I’m a staff engineer, and I coordinate
technical services for worldwide affiliates of our parent
company.”

johnny answers, “I suppose that’s good, but what’s that
got to do with engineering?”

THE APPROACH
Johnny and reader—it has really a lot to do with engi-
neerin . A staff en ineer “ athers all the ieces.” Pieces

develo ed b en ineers and businessmen are ﬁtted to-

gether to result in new plants having low investment and
operating costs with early, assured product output.
The staff engineer is a supporting engineer for the main
line activities. This follows the classical deﬁnition of
“Staff” as used widely in American business today. Our
parent company's main objective is to ﬁnd, produce, trans-
port, reﬁne, and market products based on crude oil
as a source of energy.
In staff activities, an en ineer must use restraint to avoid

area of responsibility. This is not easy for an experienced
man who has started as a design engineer and spent ten
or ﬁfteen years in active work and supervision of other
technical experts. The ability to retain technical “feel”
for problems and to direct technical experience towards
guiding the solution of broader problems is a primary
qualiﬁcation for a staff engineer.

ORGANIZATION

Our engineering company has over thirty divisions in
New Jersey. Five of these divisions can be grouped into
engineering functions. Staff engineers of interest to
johnny are assigned to one of these administrative-type
divisions. The staff engineers are concerned primarily
with the ﬁfty-eight reﬁneries operated by afﬁliated com-
panies in twenty-six countries throughout the world. These
reﬁneries, including allied chemical plants, cost about
$2.6 billion at the end of 1960.

THE OBJECTIVES

The divisions employ technically-oriented engineers
who ﬁnd real pleasure in acquiring technical skills and
using these skills for commercial application of new
ideas from laboratories, development groups, and operat-

ing personnel. The prodigious How of knowledge in all
industries has resulted in the need for varied specialization
to create high quality engineering pieces.

Staff objectives involve clearly understanding the busi-
ness needs of an affiliate and translating their needs into
engineering problems for solution by technical specialists.
The staff engineer brings into every job, whether a service
request or a grass roots reﬁnery design, an understanding
and a plan of attack which blends the technical skill of
engineers with the business needs of the operating afﬁli-
ate. Hence, the staff engineer receives information on both
phases and must keep informed to be able to impart all
necessary information to his management.

The problem associated with all creative engineering
accomplishments is the selection of a proper alternate
for best results. “Best” results in industry means the most

proﬁtable alternate to accomplish management’s policy.
Engineers are trained to build practically and economically
what the dreamer, scientist and businessman hope can
be built.

The staff engineer brings functional experts in on all
matters whether in planning or basic engineering stage.
In visits to oﬂices and reﬁneries of aﬂiliates, the staff engi-
neer strives to convey an unprejudiced broad viewpoint

to problems without supporting or concentrating on any
one division’s problems.

THE METHODS

How does the staff engineer do this?

o By having many years of maturing experience.

0 By having a feel for research, process and engineering
technology in his particular industry.

o By personally knowing the individuals in key spots
and in decision-making roles.

o By being able to prepare a basic plan of attack for
any job.

0 By being informed and passing along useful informa-
tion to all concerned.

0 By soundly appraising the progress and quality of
services and calling attention to any deﬁciencies.

THE ANSWER

30 Johnny says, “I see—you gather all the pieces and put
them together. You don’t make the pieces, you gather
them. That’s staff engineering.”

Plans, agendas, meetings, visits, reports, schedules, work
descriptions, coordination procedures, letters and charts
are the vocabulary words of the staff engineer. All based
on a foundation of specialized engineering talent.

Scholarship, industry and loyalty are the qualities which
the committee of engineering faculty and students look
for in selecting the annual Engineering and Mines Travel
and Training Awardees. Of these, loyalty to the University
and to the Schools of Engineering and Mines, as demon-
strated through participation in activities and a sincere
desire to share experiences obtained abroad with the Uni-
versity community, is of basic importance. Scholarship is
also of prime consideration to the committee. And ﬁnally,
industry and application to the profession aside from the
prescribed ﬁeld of study, are considered in presenting the
awards which send Pitt Engineers abroad for a summer of

The number of awards presented each year is deter-

nual.ly by the E8cM Cabinet, others are given occasionally
by the Alumni Association and local industry. This year,
through the efforts of Dean Fitterer, the Alumni Associa-
tion has again provided the necessary funds for a second
EMITT award. _

The two EMITT awardees this year, WILLIAM
SCHNEIDER and REGIS STANA, are both from the
Chemical Engineering Department. Bill and Rege cer-
tainly fulﬁll the high ideals of the EMITT selection com~
mittee. Bill’s activity record indicates versatile participa-
tion not only in E8cM activities, but also those of the
University at large. Bill has served as photographer and
photo editor of the OWL, and is presently the Editor of
the 1962 OWL. He was elected president of both his

sophomore and junior classes of AIChE. Bill has been
part of the Chem. E’s debate team which has won the
Engineer's Week Debate ﬁnals for two consecutive years.
His honoraries include Pi Delta Epsilon, honorary jour-
nalism fraternity, Druids, Junior Worthies, and O.D.K.
He is also a member of Phi Delta Theta, social fraternity,
and the Pitt Photo Club.

The outstanding attributes of REGIS STAN A are schol-
arship and industry. In his three years at Pitt, Rege has
maintained a QPA of 3.38. Last year he was selected as
the “Outstanding Chemical Engineering Sophomore.” He
has been a member of the Special Fellowship Program
since his freshman year. Rege worked at the Allegheny
Ballistics Laboratory last summer and has kept well abreast
of the ﬁeld of rocket propellants. Much of the success of
the Chem. E’s excellent display and working lab can be
attributed to Rege’s work and knowledge of this chal-
lenging ﬁeld. He also helped the Chem. E’s debate team
prepare for their debate of the adoption of the metric
system. Rege is a member of AIChE and PSPE.

The important factor that both Bill and Rege share is
their enthusiasm of the EMITT program. They both have
a sincere interest in the continuation of the program and
in sharing their experience obtained abroad with the
engineering students, the University and the community.
The committee feels that Bill and Rege will serve as ex-
cellent representatives of the Schools of Engineering and
Mines, not only to the people of Europe this summer,
but also to the University community upon their return.

A TOMIC FUSION

Unfortunately, before a fusion reaction can be main-
tained, the deuterons must have enough energy to exist as
ions. Therefore, the achievement of a very hot plasma
is a basic requirement for the success of controlled thermo-
nuclear reactions. It is essential that the plasma be hot
because reactions do not occur frequently enough if the
ion energy is too low. The electrons must also be hot.
Cold electrons absorb energy upon collision with hot ions.
This heat transfer rate is much more rapid than the fusion
rate. For example, over 100 million deuterium nuclei
would cool down in this fashion for every one producing a
fusion reaction, and far more enrgy would be lost to the
electrons than would be generated by fusion. It is because
of this energy loss to cold surroundings that one cannot
simply ﬁre energetic deuterons into a solid deuterium
‘target and produce power from the thermonuclear reac-
tions. Since the electrons cannot be removed from the
plasma, the obvious solution is to heat them to the same
temperature as the nuclei. The creation of a hot plasma
is, therefore, a most necessary condition.

There are many methods of obtaining such a high
temperature, but the most practical way to date is
by means of an electric shock. One method it to use
a Pyrex T-shaped tube with two electrodes at the top
of the T. The tube is ﬁlled with deuterium gas at low

pressure, and then an electric charge from 5,000 to 25,000
volts is discharged through the gas with a very high cur-
rent. Because the jolt is so severe, and of a very short
duration, a shock wave is formed and is driven upward
magnetically. Upon colliding with the end of the tube,
the high mechanical energy the shock wave possesses
is transformed into heat. energy. This heat energy raises
the temperature of the plasma to about l,200,000°F. At
this temperature, no material on earth remains a liquid,
let alone a solid. What material could withstand these
temperatures? The answer was found in the use of a
magnetic ﬁeld. A magnetic ﬁeld is unaffected by heat and
low pressures. It will work through glass and most metals.
Hence, the development of the magnetic bottle.

The magnetic bottle consists of a glass tube surrounded
by a magnetic ﬁeld which forces all substances subjected
to it into the center of the tube, leaving a vacuum between
that substance and the side of the bottle. The vacuum
conducts no heat; thus, it restricts the temperature of the
substance. The glass sides permit a visual inspection of
the substance, yet no impurities can enter and spoil any
reaction taking place. The magnetic ﬁeld is generated
by iron magnets, or cores in the case of the Perhapsatron,
or by a continuous loop of wire, as in the Stellerator. Be-
cause heat does not affect a magnetic ﬁeld, the magnetic
bottle is ideally suited for fusion experiments. In addi-
tion, a fusion reaction would generate its own magnetic
ﬁeld, eliminating the need for expensive equipment re-
quired to supply one.

A current of up to 1,000,000 amperes is injected either
into the gas itself or around the windings surrounding the
magnetic bottle, causing the deuterium to ionize instantly
and completely. This ionized gas is called plasma. The
plasma is then subjected to magnetic forces. Next, a
magnetic ﬁeld is applied to the bottle, and the gas is
forced into the center of the tube. This shock instantly
heats the plasma to a white hot heat, causing the deu-
terium atoms to collide with each other more frequently.
The heat increases the speed of the plasma ions, and the
pinch conﬁnes this low pressure gas in a limited space.

The age of nuclear energy began on December 2, 1942.
On that day in the city of Chicago a group of scientists,
led by the late Enrico Fermi, ﬁrst achieved the controlled
release of energy from an atomic nucleus. They created the
world’s ﬁrst nuclear reactor, and thereby made available a
tremendous, previously untapped source of energy.

Nuclear reactors release the energy of the atomic nucleus
by splitting the heaviest atoms into lighter atoms. Such

charged molecule.

reactors are now being used to produce power in all parts
of the world. The amount of additional energy that the
world can obtain from uranium and thorium by the ﬁssion
process is at least a hundred times greater than could be
obtained by burning all the remaining coal and oil.

Impressive as this nuclear source may seem, it is small
in comparison with the thermonuclear energy available in
the nuclei of the lightest elements, such as hydrogen.
Thermonuclear energy is released when these light ele-
ments are made to combine with each other at very high
temperatures. This reaction will yield a thousand times
more energy than a ﬁssion reaction.

The principal fuel of a fusion reactor is deuterium,
or heavy hydrogen. Deuterium can be obtained from
ordinary water by repetitive electro.lyzation, as heavy
water takes more energy to decompose than regular water.
Thus, with continuous electrolyzation the concentration
of heavy water can become rather high. Heavy water
presently sells for about $28 a pound, and deuterium for
about $400 a pound. This is a real bargain, since one pound
of deuterium will yield 30 million times as much energy
as an equal weight of gasoline. Ten gallons of ordinary
tap water contain enough deuterium to supply the power
needs of one household for a year, and the deuterium can
be separated for about 30¢. One pound of deuterium
will produce 43 million kilowatt hours of electricity. The
deuterium in sea water can supply all the world’s power
at 1,000 times its present consumption for over a billion
years to come. If it was extracted and burned it would
produce one thousand million million million kilowatt
years of electricity, or 1 x 1021 kilowatt years. A typical
fusion reaction for a deuterium tritium mixture is as
follows:

D2 + T3——He4 + n1 —l— 17.6 MeV

T3 + P1 —|— 3.98 MeV
He3 —l— N1 + 3.25 MeV
One would have to burn more than 1 million gallons of

gasoline in order to come close to equalizing the energy
from fusing 1 pound of deuterium.

Economically, atomic fusion has many advantages. But
there are many more reasons for initiation of fusion over
fission. If atomic fission produced all the power used by
the United States in just one year, the radioactive waste
produced would be equivalent to the detonation of two
hundred thousand atomic bombs. Atomic fusion produces
so little radioactivity, if any, that no radioactive shielding
is necessary. This factor alone would save thousands of
dollars spent on shielding a typical fission reactor. A
typical fission reactor requires refueling periodically. This
necessitaties a complete shutdown of the reactor, both a
costly and time-consuming process. A fusion reactor will
run indeﬁnitely as long as deuterium gas is supplied. This
gas could be supplied by an ordinary low pressure gas
system.

Although extensive equipment is required to start a fu-
sion reaction, nothing is required to maintain it. Also,
the fusion reactor cannot go out of control. If a failure
would ever occur, the reaction would simply collapse.

Unfortunately, the intense current needed to create this

IN THE 8-SHAPED STELLERATOR ionized gas, or plasma, is con-
fined by an endless, twisted magnetic field. It is then heated by
two methods, known as ohmic heating and magnetic pumping.

magnetic ﬁeld (90,000 gauss) is presently obtained from the
discharge of a giant bank of capacitors. At this current,
the capacitors discharge rather rapidly, and the magnetic
ﬁeld does not remain high very long. Also, the thin rope
of plasma becomes unstable under the inﬂuence of the
magnetic ﬁeld. These factors combine quickly to such
an extent that the rope of plasma touches the wall of the
container, resulting in the instant cooling of the plasma
and the collapse of the reaction.

Thus, the problems of fusion become clear. First, the
deuterium gas must be raised to an extremely high tem-
perature. Then something must be found to contain the
deuterium mixture. Finally, a device must be engineered
to prevent the plasma from becoming unstable. All of
these problems must be solved for periods long enough
for the plasma to ignite. Several devices attempting to
achieve these requirements are presently being tested in
England and the United States.

About 10 different devices attempting to create a con-
trolled fusion reaction are now being tested. The ﬁrst of
these devices is the Perhapsatron. The Perhapsatron S-4
is a ring-shaped electrical discharge device consisting of
an aluminum torus and a fused—quartz liner containing
deuterium gas. It is 3” thick and 20” in diameter. The
system operates as an ion-cored pulse transformer, with
the gas discharge forming the secondary and the alumi-
num torus the primary of the transformer. A bank of
capacitors having a maximum energy storage of 90,000
joules is discharged through the aluminum primary, and
generates a damped oscillatory gas current rising to more
than 300,000 amperes in a 50 microsecond period. A
solenoid winding aroundthe torus creates a magnetic ﬁeld

which can be varied from 0 to about 4,000 gauss. The
combination of the magnetic ﬁeld and the proximity of
the aluminum primary to the gas discharge tends to sup-
press instabilities and distortion of the plasma rope.
Another device is known as the Stellerator. The pur-
pose of a Stellerator is to conﬁne the plasma by means of
an external magnetic ﬁeld in an endless closed container.
The ﬁeld is produced by large currents in copper wires
wound around the ionized gas. To achieve a uniform
conﬁnement, the ﬁeld must be twisted. This twist can be
produced by using a ﬁgure-eight shaped container, or
by adding additional currents of a special sort to a circular
or racetrack—shaped container. The B-2 Research Stel-
lerator is typical of the operation of the various types
of Stellerators. The external magnetic ﬁeld of the B-2
Research Stellerator is normally about 27,000 gauss. The
vacuum chamber itself is only 5 cm in diameter, and made
of aluminum. Two transformers in addition to the exter-
nal ﬁeld winding also .lie along the ﬁgure-eight shape. The
ﬁrst of these transformers is an ohmic heating coil which
induces a high current in the plasma. The high current
heats the plasma to about l,000,0000F. At that point
the ohmic heating is no longer effective, and the second
transformer is started. This transformer is a magnetic
pumping coil, which transfers large pulses of energy to
the plasma raising its temperature still higher. Once ig-
nited the ste.llerator would theoretically supply heat to a
conventional turbo—generator system to produce electricity.
Still another method is the Rotating plasma device.
In this device plasma is caused to rotate at a very high
speed by momentarily passing a pulse of current through
it perpendicular to a magnetic ﬁeld. The plasma held

together by the magnetic ﬁeld acts as the armature and
ﬂywheel of a motor-generator. The plasma is at ﬁrst
swept into the conﬁning region by the combined action of
pinch effect and centriﬁcal force from the rotation and
the magnetic mirror effect. The magnetic mirror machine
is a containment device using externally applied ﬁelds,
which may vary with time or be steady with time, or be
a combination of both, depending on the experiment. The
magnetic mirror consists of regions of increased magnetic
ﬁeld strength which reﬁect charged particles of either sign.
In the region between the mirrors, the ions travel in
spiral paths about the magnetic lines of force. As the ions
penetrate the ﬁeld region nearithe end of the tube, their
forward motion is impeded and the path becomes almost
circular as the ions are reﬂected from the mirrors. Ions
contained in this way make many thousands of traversals
all the while gaining energy as the magnetic ﬁeld strength
increases. As the comparitively cold plasma is injected
into the machine, the plasma gains heat when the mag-
netic ﬁeld violently compresses it.

Another type of device is the DCX or Direct Current
Experiment. This device consists of a high energy beam
of deuterons injected into a magnetic field perpendicular
to the beam, which traps the beam inside it.

A special direct current carbon arc then blasts the high
energy molecular ions into atomic ions. The deuterium
molecular ion consists of one deuterium atom and a deu-
terium nucleus bound together as a molecule. When this

particle passes through the arc, it is broken up into two
parts. One of these is the neutral deuterium atom which
escapes from the system immediately, and the other is the
deuterium nucleus, which is positively charged and stays
trapped in the ﬁeld. An unbroken molecule would travel
in a circular path and return to strike a source, but the
split nucleus, one half of the normal mass, will move in a
circle of only one half the usual diameter, and stay
trapped in the ﬁeld. The trapped deuterons move through
this ﬁeld in a circle of twenty centimeters in diameter at
over 1000 kilometers per second. At each revolution the
half deuterons gain more and more enregy. Unfortu-
nately, energy is lost to a rather low beam current (300
microamps) and a limited vacuum (lO‘7 mm of mercury),
but constant improvements are being made.

At this time only mechanical and technical limitations
have delayed the development of a thermonuclear fusion
reactor. No theoretical limitations have, as of yet, been
encountered. This means that with constant improve-
ments, a thermonuclear reactor can become a reality in
the very near future. V/Vestinghouse recently developed
a new super—magnet, whose power dwarfs that of the mag-
nets presently being used. Perhaps this is the key that
will unlock the power of the hydrogen atom, creating an
unlimited source of energy. Only time and perseverance
will give the answers to the problems yet to be solved.
Thermonuclear fusion may be a reality much sooner than
we expect.

Spreading the magic of hse skilled hands

APRIL 1962

Given native ability, years of experienc'e—and t'ime——the
craftsmen of‘grandfather’s day could work miracles of pre-
cision in wood and metal, using simple hand tools.

But craftsmen like that were too few—and too costly—to
ﬁll the demands of a rapidly growing nation wanting more of
everything fast, at prices most people could afford.

So engineering minds looked for ways to build craftsman-
like precision and skill into machines that could be used by
less skilled workers to build the many things America needed.
This is how the ﬁrst Delta Power Tool came into being, almost
forty years ago. It was a simple scroll saw, but with it even a
child could cut intricate patterns in wood.

Today there are 62 different Delta woodworking and metal-
working tools, ranging from a very modern scroll saw to pre-
cision metal lathes, and including a new radial drill that does
things impossible with any other drill press. Engineering, of
course, was vital in developing every one of these tools, and
it is engineers who keep the world’s most complete line of
power tools also the most modern in the world.

Engineers play an important part in all of the 19 product
lines (measuring devices, control devices, and power tools)
that Rockwell makes for 28 different industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like
to work for, buy from and invest in.

50. Your equipment must be wrong.”

The policeman assured the driver
that the radar was accurate and it
must be the Corvette’s instruments
that were incorrect.

“Maybe you are right,” agreed the
driver. “Perhaps you wi.ll allow me
to drive back down the road aways
and come by doing 60 miles per hour
on my speedometer. Then we will
compare with your reading.”

The officer agreed, but made the
man promise to come back. He drove
about 2 miles, and the second time
he came back the officer said he was
doing 135 mph. They have yet to
see him.

An attractive young lady entered
the lingerie shop and after looking at
some sheer nylon hose, asked if she
could have the words “If you can read
this, you're too darn close” embroi-
dered on the tops.

“We can do that,” said the clerk.
“Do you want block or script letters?”

“Neither,” the beauty said. “Just
Braille.”

The Theta Xi’s recently sent their
window curtains to the cleaners, and
there was some delay in having them
returned. One morning a note ar-
rived for the president from the Gam-
ma Phi house.

“Dear Sir,” it read, “may we suggest
that you procure curtains for your
windows. We do not care for a course
in anatomy.”

The president replied promptly
with the following answer: “Dear
Girls: This course is not compulsory.”

Eddy
and

ﬂlnne

At time (t) equals zero there lived
in a small cavity in a dielectric a poor
struggling dipole by the name of Eddy
Current. He was deep-ly in love with
a beauteous double layer by the name
of Anne Ion, the daughter of an in-
ﬂuential force in the town, Cat Ion.
Anne was the center of attraction of
the young dipoles of the town; her
golden curls, her symmetric line in-
tegrals, and her harmonic motion
affected the susceptibilities of all the
gay sparks- However, her father, a
rich magnet and power factor, had
laid down a strict set of boundary
conditions for her future husband.
Eddy’s ﬁrst contact with her came at
time (t) equals a. As he passed by a
beauty parlor on his periodic orbit,
he saw her have a standing wave in-
duced in her ﬁlaments. He.made a
ﬁne sight in his beautiful doublet and
it was a case of mutual polarization.

By a coincidence they met at a dis-
sipation function the following night.

32

After a few oscillations to the strains
of a number (n) by Mo Mentum and
his Incandescent Tuning Forks, the
couple diffused into the ﬁeld outside.
There on the Wheatstone Bridge the
young dipole felt that his big moment
had arrived. “Gauss, Anne, you are
acute angle, I am d(ter1nined) that
U shell ‘marry for I sphere that I’ll
never be happy without you.”

“O, Eddy, don’t be so obtuse,” said
Anne. “Integrate out here in the
alpha rays tonight?”

“Anne, are you trying to dump my
oscillations? Can't you see I'm in a
state of hysteresis over you?”

“Now Eddy, be a discreet particle.
What will father say?”

Eddy did not allow her reluctance
to phase him, for he knew it was only
a surface charge. “I admit I only get
paid a low calorie in my present po-
sition but I have potentialities and
I'm sure money can’t BTU of any
importance compared to my love.”

Alas, there was also in this cavity a
mean dipole who was resolved to
marry Anne, using coercive force if
necessary. Hearing these murmurings
of love he went Pi-i’d with fury and
crept stealthily upon the couple with
velocity V, his joules drooling with
the bestial erg which moved him.
“Low Schmidt!” cried Anne.

“What the infra-re dare you doing
here you ﬂat-bottomed vial villain?”
demanded Eddy. The situation grew
tens_or.

Schmidt advanced to choke the
beautiful coil: Eddy offered resist-
ance (R); his capacity (C) for ab-
sorbing the charge  was low and
Schmidt suffered little lost work con-
tent in knocking him out to inﬁnity
with a severe blow on his negative
charge. Eddy made a quick comeback
with acceleration (a) stripping off
Schmidt’s outer electrons; this so upset
the villain’s equilibrium that he was
converted into cosmic radiation and
vanished in the realms of space, leav-
ing Eddy the resultant vector in the
combat.

Old Cat Ion, attracted to the spot
by Schmidt’s oxidation, beamed upon
the young dipole. “Brave young lad,”
he emitted, “you have satisﬁed the
boundary conditions and by the the-
orem of uniqueness are the only one
for my daughter.”

“Our love will not be transient,”
said Eddy as he formed a closed
circuit about her.

“Darling, we'll raise a one para-
meter family of second order inﬁni-
tesimals,” murmured Anne happily.
As time (t) approached inﬁnity, they
lived happily ever after.

THE PHYSICS OF PHOTOGRAPHY NEEDS
GOOD PEOPLE

Patterns in blood

Electrophoresis is a means for sepa-
rating ionic components of a mixture
by virtue of their differing mobilities in
an electric ﬁeld. The man who ﬁrst
worked it out wound up with a Nobel
Prize for his pains. (We never had the
pleasure of an employment application
from him.) Subsequently other highly
creative types—biochemists mostly—
invented ways of doing electrophoresis
in wet paper, starch blocks, and
other media.

Recently two such chaps at The
Mount Sinai Hospital in New York used
polyacrylamide gels of two different pore
sizes in combination. This speeded it
up and permitted separation of blood
serum proteins into many more com-
ponents. It results in a visual pattern
that represents an individual’s body
chemistry at a given moment.

We found out about this so-called
disc electrophoresis by paying attention
to what people tell us. Savants are
always asking about Eastman Organic
Chemicals that they hope we can make
for them. Sometimes we ﬁnd there will
be no objection and some prospect of
beneﬁt to all parties if we will act as a
broadcaster of technical information
thus picked up.

This is happening right now with disc
electrophoresis, which uses Eastman
Organic Chemicals and about which
we are offering far and wide a 69-page
disquisition by the two New Yorkers.

In the name of corporate self-interest,
much good dope gets cheaply spread.

Q. Mr. Savage, should young engineers
ioin professional engineering socie-
ties?

A.

Q.

By all means. Once engineers
have graduated from college
they are immediately “on the
outside looking in,” so to speak,
of a new social circle to which
they must earn their right to be-
long. Joining a professional or
technical society represents a
good entree.

How do these societies help young
engineers?

The members of these societies
——mature, knowledgeable men——
have an obligation to instruct
those who follow after them.
Engineers and scientists—as pro-
fessional people—are custodians
of a specialized body or fund of
knowledge to which they have
three deﬁnite responsibilities.
The ﬁrst is to generate new
knowledge and add to this total
fund. The second is to utilize
this fund of knowledge in service
to society. The third is to teach
this knowledge to others, includ-
ing young engineers.

Specifically, what benefits accrue
from belonging to these groups?

A. There are many. For the young

engineer, afﬁliation serves the
practical purpose of exposing his
work to appraisal by other scien-
tists and engineers. Most impor-
tant, however, technical societies
enable young engineers to learn
of work crucial to their own.
These organizations are a prime
source of ideas-—meeting col-
leagues and talking with them,
reading reports, attending meet-
ings and lectures. And, for the
young engineer, recognition of
his accomplishments by asso-
ciates and organizations gener-
ally heads the list of his aspira-
tions. He derives satisfaction
from knowing that he has been
identiﬁed in his ﬁeld.

Interview with General Electric’s

Charles F. Savage

Consultant— Engineering Professional Relations

How Professional Societies

Help Develop Young Engineers

Q.

What contribution is the young en-
gineer expected to make as an ac-
tive member of technical and pro-
fessional societies?

First of all, he should become
active in helping promote the
objectives of a society by prepar-
ing and presenting timely, well-
conceived technical papers. He
should also become active in
organizational administration.
This is self-development at work,
for such efforts can enhance the
personal stature and reputation
of the individual. And, I might
add that professional develop-
ment is a continuous process,
starting prior to entering col-
lege and progressing beyond
retirement. Professional aspira-
tions may change but learning
covers a.person’s ‘entire life span.
And, of course, there. are dues to
be paid. .The-"amount is grad-
uated in terms of professional
stature gained and should al-
ways be considered as a personal
investment in his future.

How do you go about ioining pro-
fessional groups?

While still in school, join student
chapters of societies right on
campus. Once an engineer is out
working in industry, he should
contact local chapters of techni-
cal and professional societies, or
ﬁnd out about them from fellow
engineers.

Does General Electric encourage par-
_ticipation in technical and profes-
sional societies?

It certainly does. General Elec-
tric progress is built upon cre-
ative ideas and innovations. The
Company goes to great lengths
to establish a climate and in-
centive to yield these results.
One way to get ideas is to en-

courage employees to join pro-
fessional societies. Why? Because
General Electric shares in recog-
nition accorded any of its indi-
vidual employees, as well as the
common pool of knowledge that
these engineers build up. It can’t
help but proﬁt by encouraging
such association, which sparks
and stimulates contributions.

Right now, sizeable numbers of
General Electric employees, at
all levels in the Company, belong
to engineering societies, hold re-
sponsible ofﬁces, serve on work-
ing committees and handle im-
portant assignments. Many are
recognized for their outstanding
contributions by honor and
medal awards.

These general observations em-
phasize that General Electric
does encourage participation. In
indication of the importance of
this view, the Company usually
defrays a portion of the expense
accrued by the men involved in
supporting the activities of these
various organizations. Remem-
ber, our goal is to see every man
advance to the full limit of his
capabilities. Encouraging him to
join Professional Societies is one
way to help him do so.

“Your First 5 Years” published by
the Engineers’ Council for Profes-
sional Development Which you may
