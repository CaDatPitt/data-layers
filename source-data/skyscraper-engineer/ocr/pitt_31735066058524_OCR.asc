water. Without these, there could be no
extensive precipitation to supply fresh
water. The amount of existing water
would control the humidity in a breath-
able atmosphere. The uncomfortable
effects of high humidity are well
known, but there are adverse physio-
logical effects due to extremely low
levels of water vapor pressure in the air,
particularly at higher temperatures.

Other conditions taken into account
were wind velocities, radioactivity levels,
volcanism, excessive electrical activity
(lightning), and the meteor—infall rate.

Having summarized the principal re—
quirements of human beings, we must
now consider the question of what sort
of planet would possess the environ-
mental conditions outlined.

PLANETARY
CHARACTERISTICS

Mass is the most basic planetary
property and determines a variety of
other planetary properties, such as the
planet’s destiny, volume, gravity, escape
velocity, atmospheric composition, sur-
face pressure, water retention, topo-
graphy, and rate of volcanism.

Surface gravity would be the limiting
property in setting a maximum mass for
a habitable planet. To fall within the
required human limits, a planet must
have a surface gravity of not more than
1.5g. A surface gravity of this magni-
tude is produced by a planet having a
mass of 2.35 times that of the Earth.

Since no lower limit was placed on
surface gravity, the minimum mass of
a planet would be the point at which
it could no longer retain a breathable
atmosphere. This would occur on a
planet having a mass of 0.20 times that
of Earth.

Planets, falling within the limits set
previously on mass, would have rota-
tion periods ranging from 15 to 20
hours. Rate of rotation determines the
oblateness of the body, which, subse-
quently, determines the change in sur-
face gravity with latitude. Rotation
also effects the temperature cycles, wind
velocities, and atmospheric circulation.
A planet with a relatively slow rate of
rotation would have extreme daily
temperatures, and it is unlikely that
any plant life, could survive the long
hot days and the cold nights. At the
rate of rotation increases, surface gravity
diminishes, eventually reaching a point

where zero gravity results in a loss of
matter into space. The rotation period
of 1'5 to 20 hours would produce satis-
factory temperature variations and
would be insufficient to cause any
marked difference in surface gravity
with changes of latitude.

Possessing sufficient mass and a habit-
able rotation period, a certain amount
of time must elapse before a newly-
formed planet can develop surface con-
ditions suitable for life. How long
does this entire complicated process
take? One billion years? Two billion?
Three? It is impossible to say with any
accuracy, but the amount of time re-
quired is surely of this magnitude. The
Earth is estimated to be approximately
ﬁve billion years old, and traces of life
have been found which extend as far
back as three billion years. The Earth,
then, was approximately two billion
years old before life began to develop,
and any other habitable planet would
require a similar period of aging.

The eccentricity of a planet’s orbit
also would have its limitations. Within
our solar system, the eccentricity of the
planetary orbits is generally low. At
aphelion, the Earth is 945 million miles
from the sun, while at perihelion, it is
91.3 million miles. This 3.2 million
mile variance seems extremely great
but actually accounts for an eccentricity
of only 0.017. If the Earth’s orbit were
drawn to scale, it would look like a
perfect circle. Using the orbit of the
earth as an example, trial calculations
have indicated that the habitability of a
planet would not be effected at orbital
eccentricities up to 0.2.

The distance from the primary (the
main star of the system) and the in-
clination of the equator have related
effects on the satellite planet. The
amount of heat radiation at the surface
of a habitable planet must lie within

certain limits, and this depends on its 3

distance from its primary. But, a less
obvious characteristic can also have
major effects on the amount of radia-
tion received. Suppose that the angle
of inclination of the Earth’s equator
were 90°. This would mean that one
of the poles would be pointed directly
at the primary, resulting in one polar
region being baked 24 hours a day
while the other froze. As the seasons
progressed, the poles would be reversed,

   

Ti ronﬁeirs eyond

 

rendering the planet uninhabitable.
Arbitrarily, a requirement was set that
at least 10% of the planet’s land mass
must lie within the required radiation
limits in order to be considered habit-
able under the study.

So far, we have considered only re-
strictions placed on the planet in ques-
tion, but the position of the primary
star is also critical. For a planet possess-
ing the characteristics of Earth, limita-
tions on primary mass and distance can
be calculated. Where planetary bodies
revolve about a mutual center of grav-
ity, there is a minimum distance called
“Roche’s Limit,” after the astronomer
who calculated it.

At a closer distance than Roche's
Limit, the smaller of the planets in-
volved would tend to break up into
fragments as the result of the tide-
rising forces of the larger. Saturn’s
rings, for example, lie wholly within
Roche’s Limit for that planet. This
could mean that once—innermost satel-
lites of Saturn had broken up at some
undetermined time in the past and that
fragments had spread out to ﬁll the
orbit.

In order to provide a constant source
of heat and light, the primary must be
in its main sequence; that is, it must
be converting hydrogen to helium at a

steady rate. The “Red Giants” we
know of are stars that have left their
main sequence. Eventually these giants
go through a nova stage and end up as
tiny “White Dwarfs,” small in volume,
large in mass, and tremendously high
in density. The satellite of a White
Dwarf would have to travel in an orbit
very close to the primary to get enough
radiation for habitability. This nearness
would result in an attractive force that
would bring about a slowing down and
eventual halting of the rotation of the
satellite with regard to the primary.
Therefore, radiation from either the
Giants or Dwarfs would not be steady
enough for aihabitable satellite.

POSSIBLE CANDIDATES

After determining the planetary char-
acteristics that would meet the human
requirements, the question to be con-
sidered is where can we ﬁnd the solar
system candidates which meet these
conditions.

Under the Air Force contract, the
bodies studied were the 100 nearest
stars listed in Allen’s Table (Allen,
1955). All of these star systems lie
within 22 light years of the Sun. Of
the stars listed in the table, rigorous
elimination process left 14 with a proba-
bility greater than .01 of possessing a

habitable planet (See Chart). If we
combine the probability to determine
the possibility of the existence of at
least one habitable planet among these
likeliest of candidates, a probability of
.43 is achieved. This means that the
odds are 3 to 2 against our ﬁnding a
suitable planet out to 22 light years
from the Sun.

These are really fairly good odds, and
it must be remembered that we are con-
sidering only a very minute portion of
the universe. As we extend our study
further into the endless reaches of space,
the probability of ﬁnding a habitable
planet will increase. In fact, when the
whole of the universe was taken into
account, it was estimated that there are
likely to be as many as 600 million other
habitable planets awaiting discovery.

We can see now that the conditions
which we take as normal are actually
conﬁned within narrow limitations, and
researchers agree that it is unlikely that
man will ever ﬁnd a planet more aptly
suited to his needs than Earth.

Yourhome furnace would

be this small...if it had
an Allison combustor.

Or...in aircraft terminology: the new Allison Combustor
turns out four times the heat release of combustors in
production engines. Yet a Combustor for a 10,000 lb. thrust
engine can be held in one hand.

It's an Allison breakthrough in lightweight engine tech-
nology. Immediate application: Allison Lift engines. De-
signed to propel tomorrow's jet aircraft straight up.

So far, Allison Lift engines have attained thrust/weight
ratios over four times those of production engines.

Other factors have contributed: Like new com-
pressor blades that raise pressure 50%.

Advanced turbine cooling techniques allow
higher inlet temperatures. Greater power. Lower
blade temperatures.

 

Even greater advances are on the way—for turbojet and
turbofan engines. With 30:1 thrust/weight ratios forecast.
Shorter compressors. More efficient combustors. For lift or
cruise engines.

Advanced lightweight technology is another demonstra-
tion of Allison's broad capabilities in research, engineer-
ing, and production. Capabilities that help keep defense,
aerospace and nuclear projects on target.*

What's

New

A laminated ceramic tube that cuts
production costs of steel about $4 per
ton has added new promise to the pres-
sure pouring process of steelmaking.
The new pouring tube, vital link be-
tween ladel and mould, outlasts its
predecessors more than 3 to 1.

The big gain in tube life — one tube
can deliver 150 tons or more before re-
placement — substantially improves
economics of the process. It may lead to
pressure pouring of larger tonnages,
and of alloy and carbon steels as well
as stainless.

The refractory tube, actually com-
bines two high—alumina tubes in one.
The outer sleeve, which covers the part
of the tube that dips into the melt,
withstands slag corrosion, the major
problem along with outer surface. The
inner tube withstands erosion as molten
steel courses through the tube on its
way to the mold under pressure as high
as 55 psi.

In the photograph a laminated ce-
ramic pouring tube leaves holding
furnace enroute to ladel for pressure
pouring at Washington Steel Corpora-
tion, Houston, Pa., where it will handle
as much as 220 tons before needing
replacement. Double-wall construction
of the tubes permits thicker walls with-
out problems of thermal shock and
differential expansion.

They are the deaf, they are the blind;
in many cases they are incapable of
uttering recognizable speech. But a
new device now promises to expand
their world, and allow the grievously
handicapped to do something most of
us take for granted: to communicate
with someone by telephone.

Named the Sensicall, the new phone
substitutes sense of touch or the sense
of sight for speech and hearing.

The most important part of the new
telephone is a small, magnetically con—
trolled rod, which vibrates whenever a
sound comes over the line. The handi-
capped person, placing his ﬁngers on
this sending unit, feels the vibrations.
He is able to sense the duration of any
sound, so that a code can be set up
using “short” and “long” sounds, like

the dots and dashes of the Morse Code.

For people who are deaf but possess
their sight, another version employs a
lamp, which converts “long” sounds
and “short” sounds into long and short

flashes of light.

Besides the lamp or vibrating rod for
receiving incoming signals, each sensing
unit has a push button for transmitting
signals. When pressed, it sends a dis-
tinctive tone out over the line.

Engineering

 

Proctoscopes have long been the con-
ventional device for examining the
lower intestine for carcinoma, polyps,
and other disorders. Effective as they
have been, their inflexible design is far
from ideal.

The new proctosigmoidoscope is a
%—inch—diameter, ﬂexible tube having
an overall length of 24 inches. The first
eight inches from the proximal (near)
end are completely rigid. Flexibility in
the remaining portion is achieved by a
series of springs of varying stiffness
placed along the tube’s body so that ten-
sion decreases from the proximal end
to the distal end. This flexibility allows
the tube to be guided through the
sigmoid curve.

Three wires, spaced evenly throughout
the casing and controlled from the
proximal end, move the probe’s tip up
to 90 degrees in any direction.

Lighting and viewing are provided by
three ﬁl)CI‘—OptlC bundles. A ﬁxed—focus
lens is used in conjunction with the
viewing ﬁbers in the prototype model,
although a future version might in-
corporate a focusable lens.

Another element, housed in the body
of the probe, is a 5 mm vent, through
which material can be introduced to
and removed from the viewing area.
Lens cleaning is achieved by passing
water and air through a 1 mm tube.

work closely with Bell Telephone
Laboratory engineers on the latest

concepts in communications systems. It would
be your job to work out production techniques
for these systems, which might mean devel-

Force Measuremenf

The problem: In order to make precise
unidirectional force measurement, forces
in any direction other than the direction
of interest must be rigorously
constrained.

The so|u'|'ion: A system for measuring
unidirectional forces in the range 10 mg
to 20 g to an accuracy of 0.5 mg. The
measuring member is mounted in such
a way that it may move vertically but
is constrained from horizontal or
rotational movement.

How if's done: The system consists
of a tubular framework that mounts
detecting, measuring, and balancing de-
vices, plus a taut wire suspension sys—
tern which constrains movement of a
force—transmitting rod to the vertical
only. The rod, solenoid, and LVDT
(Linear Variable Differential Trans-
former) core together weigh many
times the forces to be measured. To
offset this dead weight, a modiﬁed
analytical balance is applied and the
balance point adjusted until minimum
output (null) is reached on the readout
from the LVDT. The sample (force)
is then attached to the lower end of the
rod causing torque in the taut wires
and deflection in the LVDT readout.
Direct current is applied to the solenoid
until the LVDT readout is brought to
the null position again. The amplitude
of the dc current required to null the
LVDT is a direct measurement of the
force exerted by the sample.

Vertical motion of the force trans-
mitting rod results in twisting of the
taut wires, which requires only small
forces. Motions of the rod in a horizon-
tal or rotational direction are trans-
formed into bowing of the wires. This
requires much greater forces and the
rod is effectively limited to vertical
motion over its design range.

Notes:

1. This system‘ can be used to accurately
measure small forces in one direction,
or as an analytic balance.

IMPROVED CIRCUIT

. . . And Improved

New Elecfromefer

The preblemt Previous electrometer
circuits lacked simplicity and stability
of gain and operating point. They had
relatively low input impedance, were
somewhat nonlinear in response, and
required considerable power.

The S0|l|‘|'i0|12 A circuit that possesses
the following characteristics: simplicity,
stability of gain and operating point,
high—input impedance, linear response,
and low power requirements.

How it's done: The operating charac-
teristics are improved by modifying the
circuit as shown. The previous circuit
has a load resistor, R , in the plate cir-
cuit of the electrometer tube, and a
resistor (bias), R , in the emitter of the
input transistor. The effect of both of
these resistors is to reduce the open loop
gain of the circuit and to increase the
power requirements.

In the improved circuit, the ampliﬁer
input transistor base—ernitter junction is
used as the plate load of the electro—
meter tube and the collector of the
transistor is connected to the following
ampliﬁer stage and to a feedback cir-
cuit including resistor R . This feed-
back greatly improves the linearity of
the electrometer over its operating
range and improves the operating point
stability an dinput impedance. With
the improved circuit, no source current
is wasted in a plate load resistor and no
degeneration occurs due to the emitter
bias circuit paralleling the plate load.
Notes:

1. This device should be useful in elec-
trometer applications and in general
high in-put impedance applications.

The repulsion of like magnetic poles
provides concentric support of the in-
ner member so that no metallic contact
occurs between the bearing surfaces.
How i'l"s done: The bearing consists
of a rotating shaft member and a sta-
tionary housing member. The housing
member is a beveled permanent mag-
net, as is one end of the shaft member.
The magnets are arranged so that, as
the shaft member is inserted in the
housing member, like poles of the mag-
nets are in near contact. The shaft
member rotates concentrically in the
housing and is effectively suspended in
the designed air gap by the repulsive
forces of the adjacent bearing elements.

netic pole eleemnts produces a large

when the air gap between the housing
and shaft is reduced. Under certain
transient conditions, the shaft may
touch the housing and disrupt the
normal paths. By making the housing
in three or more segments, effective
reluctance paths are provided for a re-
turn force-to restore concentric rotation.

Notes:

1. The magnetic portions of both shaft
and housing are designed with long
magnetic paths to provide high
residual magnetism.

2. Both ends of the magnet are used
for support and provide a self—cen—
tering feature.

Cyrogenic Tool

The problem: When it is necessary to
make emergency or quick mechanical
repairs to piping, ﬂanges, valves, and
safety devices of a cryogenic ﬂuid sys-
tem, the system must be emptied and
the Dewar and associated lines warmed
and neutralized before work may pro-
ceed. This is done to prevent contami-
nants such as oxygen and dirt from
mixing with any hazardous ﬂuid being
transferred in the system.

The solufionz Develop a method by
which mechanical repairs may be safely
made to the system without emptying it.
How i1"s done: Surround the opening
in the cryogenic system with a bath or
envelope of inert gas while repairs are
being made. This inert gas prevents
contaminants from mixing with the
the ﬂuid in the system. To apply the
envelope or bath to the opening to be
repaired, an apparatus made of copper
tubing which has been drilled with tiny
holes is used. These holes are drilled at
an angle that will allow the gas to be
sprayed in a desired pattern.

Noiest

1. Repair jobs can be completed in a
period of a few minutes to approxi-
mately four hours by use of this in-
novation. A conservative estimate of
time necessary to complete the same
job by the old method is 40 hours.
The amount of inert gas required is
negligible compared to the 40,000 to
50,000 cubic feet needed for warming-
up and neutralizing a large Dewar

by the old method.

2. This innovation can be used only

for mechanical type repairs (threads,
nuts and bolts, and such) and not
for welding, soldering ,or other heat-
ing operations. Obviously, even with
an inert gas envelope surrounding
the system there are traces of oxygen
present and possibly mixed with the
hazardous ﬂuid. Therefore, any re-
pairs to the system must be the type
that produces no source of ignition
(heating, generation of sparks, and
the like) which could cause these
trace amounts of oxygen to react
with the hazardous ﬂuid.

The problem: Remote control of ﬂuid
ﬂow in a low-power system. Constant
ﬂow rates must be maintained despite
ﬂuctuating pressure across the valev.

The Soltlﬁollt A ﬂow control valve
using a ﬂapper and nozzle ﬂow control
in conjunction with a spring—loaded,
pressure drop regulator spool.

HOW “"5 dcllet A signal is fed to a
ﬂapper control device (not shown).
This positions the ﬂapper a predeter-
mined distance from the ﬂapper nozzle.
The ﬂapper valve curtain area is deﬁned
as the product of the ﬂapper nozzle cir-
cumference times the distance between
the ﬂapper nozzle and the ﬂapper. Flow
through the ﬂapper valve curtain area
is proportional to the product of the
curtain area, the pressure drop across
the curtain area, and the ﬂapper nozzle
ﬂow coeﬂicient of discharge. The How
proceeds through port A and port B.
The area of port B open to the internal
pressure (P2) of the valve is deter-
mined by -the position of the regulator
spool. The regulator spool is force
balanced, that is, it will continue to
move until pressure P, times the spool
cross sectional area equals pressure P.;_
times the spool cross sectional area plus
the force of the spring. Thus, the spool
will continue to move until the differen-
tial pressure force equals the spring
force. With the spring force essentially
constant, the differential pressure
(P, —P,_) remains essentially constant
and ﬂow through the ﬂapper valve cur-
tain area varies 0s a function of ﬂapper
position input signal. As the total pres-
sure drop across the valve (P, —P3)
varies, the regulator spool will move,
adjusting the area of port B to maintain
the pressure drop (P, —Pg) across the
ﬂapper valve curtain area at a constant
value. Flow through the valve is, there-
fore, proportional to the ﬂapper position
and independent of the pressure drop
across the valve.

Notes:

1. By coupling multiples of ﬂapper
valves, flow in multiple ﬂuid systems
can be maintained proportional to

The Problem: To provide a means for
ﬂexure fatigue testing of honeycomb
composite sandwich structures at cryo-

genic temperatures.

The soluﬁon: A cryostat with an ar-
rangement for supporting a test speci-
men during application of flexure loads.

used to secure a titanium load rod to
the specimen.

The end clamps and the center clamp
are attached to the flexure specimen,
and the assembly is properly positioned
in the cryostat. One end of the load
rod is inserted through a sealed bearing
in the cryostat and fastened to the cen-
ter clamp. The other end of the load
rod is attached to a horizontal—loading
flexure fatigue machine. The specimen
deflection is sensed by means of a dif-
ferential transformer mounted on the
head of the fatigue-machine load actua-
tor, and the static and dynamic loads
are sensed through a load cell. Both de-
flection and loads can be permanently
recorded by conventional means.

COLLAPSED

Collapsible Sfrucfune

The problem: There exists a require-
ment fora collapsible truss structure
that can be automatically expanded.
The structure when expanded must pro-
vide excellent rigidity and maintain
close dimensional tolerance.

The S0l|I'l'i0I1= Coil springs wound with
maximum initial tension, formed into a
three—truss, closed-loop structure.

How il"s done: Coil springs, when
used as truss members in such a con-
ﬁguration, have the ability to assume a
rigid state within reliable dimensions
when allowed to expand to their
straightened position. In a space ap-
pi-lation, such a structure has been suc-
cessfully designed to expand to 20
inches from a collapsed dimension of
only 2 inches. In the expanded condi-
tion, the dimensional tolerance is

0.18 inch and the vibration frequency
limit is greater than 10 cps. Collapse
and compression of this structure with-
out damage is easily accomplished by
application of a compound loading in
excess of the compression load capacity
of the trus structure. Various means
may be used to release the structure
from its collapsed conﬁguration. One
means thate has been successfully em-
ployed uses a tungsten wire as the re-
straining medium. When a current is
applied to the wire, it heats to the melt-
ing point, releasing the truss springs
which then automatically extend to a
straightened position.

Notes:

1. This innovation would be useful
wherever automatic “pop up” to a
predetermined dimension by remote
control is required.

THE PROBLEM:

HOW DO YOU GIVE YOUR CAR

BATTERY THE ENERGY OF A GRIZZLY BEAR— UPHILL, DOWNHILL, OR JUST TO GET GOING?

There was a time when engineering an alternator
system was an impracticality. Most everyone in the
business tried it— no one could successfully mass
produce the automotive diode—the key to the sys-
tem. Finally, Motorola engineers made the break-
through— alternator systems, are committing hapless
generators to the museum showcase.

Today, alternator systems are designed for auto-
motive, industrial, and marine use.

This sort of engineering sophistication is producing

automotive electronic equipment to do things for the
car that are impractical to accomplish mechanically.

Transistor ignition systems and electronic tach-
ometers, hour meters for trucks and stereo tape
decks, all-in-one air conditioning and heat control
systems—these are a few of the projects currently
in motion with Motorola automotive engineers.

The car radio? Sure. Motorola makes that too. Paul
Galvin mass produced the first ones in 1929 . . . to
start a little business.

A PREVIEW OF YOUR CAREER AT GENERAL ELECTRIC

Achieving Thrust for Mach 3

When the North American Aviation XB-70 established a mile-

stone by achieving Mach 3 flight, it was powered by six’

General Electric J93 jet engines. That flight was the high
point of two decades of G-E leadership in jet power that
began when America's first jet plane was flown in 1942. In
addition to the 30,000—pound thrust J93’s, the XB-70 carries a
unique, 240-kva electrical system that supplies all on~board
power needs—designed by G-E engineers. The challenge of
advanced flightvpropulsion promises even more opportunity
at G.E. GETF39 engines will help the new USAF C-5A fly more
payload than any other aircraft in the world; the Mach 3
GE4/J5 is designed to deliver 50,000-pound thrust for a U.S.
Supersonic Transport (SST). General Electric’s involvement

in jet power since the beginning of propellerless flight has
made us one of the world’s leading suppliers of these prime
movers. This is typical of the fast-paced technical challenge
you'll find in any of G.E.’s 120 decentralized product opera-
tions. To define your career interest at General Electric,

VVhat does it take to gain recognition at
Ford Motor Company? If you have skills
that we can utilize, and if you’re ambitious
as well as able, you can move ahead fast at
Ford! Consider the career of Eric Mangelsen:

Eric came to work at our Ypsilanti Plant in
February, 1961. During the initial stage of
his training program, he was given the
assignment to supervise the development,
design and construction of special production
calibrating and test equipment for auto-
mobile voltage regulators. Later, he was
assigned to processing and production of the transistor ignition
ampliﬁer system for our 1963 cars. He was responsible for introducing
a new cleaning process for voltage regulator contact points, which
substantially reduced costs. He was also instrumental in processing
the reﬁned transistorized regulator system used in our new 1966
automobiles.

Now a member of management with broad responsibilities in a key
Production Department, Eric Mangelsen has moved ahead rapidly
with a company that believes in giving young men every opportunity
to demonstrate their skill and ingenuity. Why not investigate? Talk
to our representative when he visits your campus. You can go far

The earth is a typical, medium—sized
planet, orbiting a typical, medium—sized
star in the outer reaches of a typical
spiral galaxy. Astronomers tell us that
the number of individually detectable
luminous bodies in space runs into
several billions and that no less than
500,000 may be called well—obserVed

St8.I'S.

If we accept the theory that all of the
heavenly bodies were formed in the
same manner, it seems quite likely that
our Earth would have a counterpart
lying within one of the countless other
galaxies.

To get a more empirical notion of
this possibility, the United States Air
Force contracted the Rand Corporation,
and a systematic approach to the ques-
tion was set up in the following
sequence:

1. What conditions, and what range
of these conditions, are necessary
to support the human species.

2. What astronomical circumstances
would bring about the required
conditions.

3. Which of the known alien solar
systems are most likely to possess
planets on which the extremely
limited conditions prevail.

As we consider the results of the
study in the same, sequence, we also
gain a deeper appreciation of our planet
and the exceptional way in which it

more than meets the minimum require-
ments for habitation.

HUMAN REQUIREMENTS

Surface temperature of a habitable
planet was the ﬁrst parameter consid-
ered in the study. Though human
beings, by using protective clothing, can
tolerate brief exposures to very extreme
ranges of tempearture, the entire popu-
lation of the world has settled in regions
where the annual mean temperature
lies between‘32°F and 86°F.

But, it is not only man’s desire for
comfort that conﬁnes him to such a
narrow range of temperature. Within
this range lies the temperature require-
ments of most of the animals and plants
vital to man as sources of food and as
suppliers of oxygen through photo-
synthesis.

All types of photosynthesis seems to
proceed most efficiently between the
wave-length limits of 380 and 760 milli-
crons, which is that portion of the
electromagnetic spectrum visible to the
human eye as light. It was proven that
when intensity of illumination is too
high solarization occurs, and when in-
tensity is too low growth becomes in-
hibited. The limits for intensity of
illumination were set, then, primarily
by the needs of plant life, and the
acceptable range was determined to lie
between 0.02 and 30.0 lumens per
square centimeter.

At the surface of the Earth, gravity
exerts a pull which is designated as
“lg.” This attraction is exerted upon
all objects on that surface, including
man. By simulating the effects of grav-
ity in large centrifuges, it was found
that man can tolerate relatively high
levels of acceleration for brief periods
of time without permanent damage.
Experiments in the centrifuge indicated
that the work required to perform
small physical tasks became excessive at
acceleration above 2g, and it was con-
cluded that life would become too bur-
densome for people to live permanently
on a planet where the surface gravity
exceeded 1.25 to 150g.

There was no evidence of a corre-
sponding lower gravitational limit
which would effect the normal ph sio-
logical functions of man. No ill e ects
were suffered by astronauts who
tolerated fourteen days of complete

'weightlessness “Og.”

As far as could be determined by the
study, the only essential ingredients of
a breathatble atmosphere were oxygen
and a small amount of water vapor.
Since human beings vary a great deal
in their tolerances of environmental
extremes, it was impossible to set de-
ﬁnite limits on the partial pressure of
oxygen required.

Experiments indicated the upper
limit, above which oxygen toxicity be-
comes a problem, is approximately
400 mm. Hg. A lower limit was set at
60 mm Hg., although mountain climb-
ers have stated that they felt ﬁt at
altitudes up to 23,000 feet where the in-
spired partial pressure of oxygen is only
53 mm Hg.

Since carbon dioxide is also needed
by plants, a lower limit was set on the
partial pressure of this constituent. The
normal concentration of carbon dioxide
in the Earth’s atmosphere is 0.03%,
which is equivalent to a partial pres-
sure of 0.21 mm Hg. The reasonable
minimum for supporting plant life
would be approximately 0.05 mm. Hg.

Some nitrogen is also needed to sup-
ply the needs of plants and animals.
The minimum amount is not known
but would be very small. Only traces of
any other gases could be tolerated in the
atmosphere.

A habitable planet would also have
to retain fairly large bodies of liquid
