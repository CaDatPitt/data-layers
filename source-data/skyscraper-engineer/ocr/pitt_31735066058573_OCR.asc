Fig‘. 1. The first fuel cells, as depicted by Grove in 1842‘, consumed hydrogen and
oxygen at platinum electrodes immersed in sulfuric acid. A battery of 26 such
cells in series composed a fuel battery capable of decomposing water.

Fuel cells versus ordinary baﬂeries

Ordinary batteries do not use con-
ventional fuels; fuel cells do. The
substances ordinary batteries con-
sume at anodes (zinc, or magnesium,
or lead, or even sodium) are not
fuels at all—certainly not conven-
tional fuels. “Conventional” fuels are
the fossil fuels (coal and hydro-
carbons found in nature) and sub-
stances easily derived therefrom, such
as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and
simpler alcohols. In general, the
cheapest fuels are the most abundant,
but cheap fuels tend to react slug-
gishly at fuel-cell anodes——especially
when the fuels are solid. As most of
the attractiveness of the fuel cell re-
sides in the prospect of producing
electrical energy directly from con-
ventional fuels this matter of what is
consumed at the anode is vital in
distinguishing fuel batteries from
‘ordinary batteries.

In general, there is a great differ-
ence at the cathodes also. In ordinary
batteries, the substance reduced is
often a compound (manganese dio-
xide, lead dioxide, silver oxide), but
in fuel cells it is always the element
oxygen, either as such or as a con-
stituent of air. Air, after all, is still
free!

Ordinary batteries store in them-
selves the chemical energy to be con-
verted. Thus, ordinary batteries, both
primary and secondary, can deliver
their capacities in sudden discharges
because they convert readily available
chemical energy stored within them.
Fuel ba.tteries cannot do this as
readily because they consist of the
‘converters alone, and these cannot
store much fuel or oxygen. Fuel and
oxygen must be supplied.

Because of this difference, fuel
batteries will appear to greatest
advantage over ordinary batteries
when loads are moderate and long
continued. Fuel batteries are better
adapted to driving automobiles than
to starting them —— especially on a
cold morning!

Thermodynamic analysis

So for we have spoken of convert-
ing chemical into electrical energy.
To do a thermodynamic analysis of
the fuel cell, we shall have to abandon
“chemical energy,” convenient though
it is, in favor of more precise terms.

The ﬁrst and second laws of ther-
modynamics deﬁne the maximum
useful work G that can be re-
covered from a chemical reaction pro-
ceeding isothermally and reversibly
in a fuel cell at constant pressure.

Perhaps the most important relation
in chemical thermodynamics is
AG = AH — TAS (1)
in which TAS is the heat exchange
with the surroundings, and the in-
cremental value of each ofthe three
thermodynamic functions G (Gibbs
free energy), H (Heat content) and
S (entropy) is fixed by the properties
of the substances involved in the
reaction.
The over—all reaction in a fuel cell is

conventional

_ oxidation

products (2)

The application of Equation 1 to
Reaction 2 proceeding in a fuel cell
un(ler the conditions stated is the
thermodynamics basis for the attrac-
tiveness, of the fuel cell.

The driving force, G, expressed
in calories/mole must be related to
the driving force expressed in volts.
The relation is

AG = __E,.NF
(the minus sign is arbitrary) (3)

where Er is the reversible electrome-
tive force (or vpl'tage) that sends
the electrons from anode to cathode
in Fig. 3. The term NF is the amount
of electricity (number of electrons)
that pass from anode to cathode when
1 mole of fuel is consumed in Reac-
tion 2; N is the number of electrons
yielded by each molecule of fuel at
the anode, and F, the faraday, is the
amount of electricity‘ equal to 6
(1093) electrons. Theright-hand side
of Equation 3 thus has an “intensity”
factor E1‘, and a “capacity” factor NF
whose magnitude is determined in
part by Avogadro’s number. For
hydrogen 1 mole is 2 grams, and this
amount can yield almost 200,000
coulombs (ampere-seconds) in a
fuel cell.

Equation 3 gives us the electrical
work done when 1 mole of fuel is
completely oxidized in Reaction 2.
In general, this electrical work is
§Eai dt; that is, the integral of volt-
age, current, and time, all of which
are variables in an operating fuel cell

The energy charges in Reaction 2
are such that Values of Er according
to Equation 3 are limited to about
1 volt. The fuel cell must therefore
be regarded as a low—voltage source

Fig. 2. This modern fuel battery developed by Grove’s fellow-Bri-ton Francis T.
Bacon, is about 30 inches long and contains 30 hydrogen fuel cells in series. Its
open-circuit voltage is about 40; it gives 100 amps at 32 volts, 240 amps at 24
volts, if operating at 200° C and 400 psi.

of direct current. Cells would have
to be connected in series to achieve
the voltages needed in the electro-
chemical industry, and auxiliary
means would be needed to produce
alternating current.

The magnitude of the driving force
tells us nothing about how rapidly
the electrons will actually ﬂow — it
tells us nothing about how many
amperes we can expect from a given
fuel cell. (The electric current is of
course the product of electrode area
(ft?) and the current density (amp/
ft9). As the electrode area can be
varied at will, it is clear that the
current density is more fundamental
here than the total current.) Thermo-
dynamics can tell us nothing about
the current density, which is deter-
mined by the rates and mechanisms
of the electrode reactions.

Physical chemistry has not yet
progressed to the point where these
can be predicted. Fortunately it is
possible to build good fuel cells with-
out a detailed knowledge of rates
and mechanisms.

All fuel cells currently considered
promising give off heat. This is im-
portant in three ways:

(1) The rejection of heat, TAS,
which proceeds isothermally, must

not be taken as evidence that the
fuel cell is a heat engine.

(2) The heat thus rejected need not
be wasted. It is potentially the more
valuable, the higher the temperature
at which the cell operates. But in
some applications, satellites for ex-
ample, heat rejection poses problems.
(3) When heat is rejected, AG in
Equation 1 is numerically smaller

than A H.

Ideal versus actual efficiency
On the basis of Equation 1, the
ideal efficiency of the fuel cell is

Vii =AG/AH = 1 —-(ms/AH) (4)

This efficiency refers to the fuel
cell alone and not to a system of
which the fuel cell is a part. Effici-
encies are calculated with respect
to AH to make them comparable
with over—all efficiencies of central
power stations; strictly speaking,
they should be called comparative
thermal efficiencies of the fuel cell.

The ideal efficiency is determined
ultimately by the properties of the
substances taking part in the over-
all reaction occuring in the fuel cell,
and exact values of this efficiency
can be calculated from tabulated
values of the thermodynamic func-
tions for Reaction 2.

The case of hydrogen as fuel is
particularly interesting in connection
with the three points named above.
For steam as product, the ideal effici-
encies at different absolute temper-
atures are as follows: 92% at 400°K;
90"/0 at 500° K; 78% at 1000° K; 54%
at 2000°K. At the highest temper-
ature, the rejected heat TAS ap-
proaches AG. This rejected heat
co11ld of course be usefully employed.

Even this brief discussion shows
us that the optimistic statement “The
fuel cell has efficiencies near 100%”
must be taken with a grain of salt.

Equation 3 permits us to express
the ideal efficiency in more conven-
ient terms as follows:

ni : -—E', NF/AH. (5)

However, in a fuel cell under load,
the actual voltage Ea will drop below
Er, because some or all of these dif-
ficulties occur:

(1) An unwanted reaction at anode
or cathode (or elsewhere in the cell);
(Q) Hindrances of various kinds to
reaction at anode and cathode;

(3) Concentration gradients in the
electrolyte or in the reactants;

(4) IQR heating in the electrolyte.
Therefore the actual eﬂiciency is

Ina = — E,,NF/AH (cf. Equation 5)

Polarization curves

When Ea is less than E1‘, one says
there is polarization. This is one of
those unfortunate overworked terms,
sanctified by tradition, that ought to
be discarded. It is retained because
the polarization curve, which shows
E as a function of current density,
is generally accepted as the most im-
portant single criterion of fuel-cell
performance.

In Fig. 4, a hypothetical polariza-
tion curve is shown, and the labels in
the ﬁgure identify regions in which
three of the four difficulties listed
above may be expected to predomin-
ate. I have stretched concentration
polarization to include mass-trans-
port diffiiculties of all kinds; that is,
difficulty of moving ions in the elec-
trolyte, difficulties in removing re-
action products from the electrodes.

An important lesson Fig. 4 teaches
is that E21 and 71a vary strongly with
current density. It is meaningless to
speak of fuel-cell efficiency without

'|0

specifying current density. The high-
est efliciencies are often attained at
current densities so low as to be use-
less. A fuel cell as big as a barn ollght
to deliver more than a little electricity.
Performance requirements

A reasonable goal for a good fuel
cell is na = 0.60, Ea = 0.6 volt at a
currenty density near 100 amp/ft9
for a minimum of several months.

The requirements that must be
met in attaining this goal can be
succinctly summarized under th e
heading reactivity and invariance.

These headings do not include the
obvious requirement that internal re-
sistance losses should be minimized,
as by close—spacing the electrodes and
by providing an electrolyte of high
ionic and negligible electronic conduc-
tivity.

The reactivity requirements are
closely related to the four difficulties
listed above, three of which appear in
Fig. 4:. The ﬁrst requirement is proper
stoichiometery, the relation of pro-
perties to composition. In the usual
case,‘ H90 and/or CO9 should be the
only oxidation products so that the
quantity of electricity from one mole
of fuel will be a maximum. (For
example, carbon oxidized to CO
yields only 2 faradays per mole in-
stead of the 4- faradays produced
when CO9 is the product.) Water and
C02 are the oxidation products of
lowest energy.

The other requirement is high and
unimpeded electrode activity. Such

Fig. 3. Schematic shows how typical hydrogen fuel cell works. At the anode-
electrolyte interface}, hydrogen dissociates into electrons and hydrogen ions.
The electrons are conducted through a circuit to the load, where they do work.
The hydrogen ions migra.te through the electrolyte to its cathode interface, where
they combine with the returning electrons and with oxygen to form water.

activity will naturally result in high
current density. But it will also lnake
possible a close approach of Ea to E1‘
(see Fig. 4) If IQR losses are low.
These two reactivity requirements
involve the rates and mechanisms of
electrode reactions, and much more
research into these matters will be
needed if fuel cells are to succeed.
The chief ways of meeting the re-
quirements are by increasing the gas-
electrode-electrolyte interface, as by
using porous electrodes; by using
electrocatalysts, either as electrode
materials or incorporated in them;
by raising pressure; by raising temp-
erature; and by proper choice of fuel.
In general, current densities in fllel
cells are limited by failure to meet
completely the reactivity reqllire-
ments.

The invariance requirements stem
from the fact that the fuel cell is
solely a converter of energy. The
converter to start with should be as
good as can be built, and it should
remain invariant to ensure long life.
Invariance (or long life) requires no
corrosion or side reactions, an in-
variant electrolyte, and no change in
the electrodes. The invariance re-
quirements are ‘more drastic and less
obvious than might appear. A few
pitfalls follow. l\/fixing of fuel and

oxygen (as by diffusion) ought al-
ways to be avoided. Electrocatalysts
can be poisoned. The pores in porous
(“gas diffusion”) electrodes can be-
come filled with too mllch liquid or
with gas —— called “drowning” and
“blow-through” respectively -— or
with extraneous materials; in any
sllch case, they are put out of action.
If the wrong ions carry current, the
electrolyte will not remain invariant,
and the anode and cathode reactions
(only fuel oxidized at anode; only
oxygen reduced at cathode) may be
thrown out of balance. Ill general
invariance requirements are bet by
a proper choice of materials and oper-
ating conditions.

Reactivity and invariance require-
ments are usually difficult to satisfy
together. If, for example, one must go
to high temperatures to obtain high
reactivity, it will usually be more
difficult to keep the fuel cell invari-
ant. If one operates near rooln tem-
perature, electrode reactions are slug-
gish, and fuel cells—though invariant
—-lnay deliver little electricity.
Types of fuel cells

A most attractive feature of the
fuel-cell situation is the great number
of possible applications and the fuel
cells that may some day be available
to fill them. This situation encour-

ages one to hope that there will soon
be at least one important application
to which a fuel cell is better suited
than any other energy source.

In this situation, any classification
of fuel cells must necessarily be over-
simplified. Yet some classification is
prerequisite. to orderly discussion.

If the fuel cell is to be a successful
energy source, not only should it
deliver electrical energy at low cost,
but it should have other advantages
also. will
be weighted differently for the vari-

These other advantages

ous applications, but they may all be
grouped here under the general
h e a d i n g c(muem'e'nce. Important
factors making for convenience are:
‘high power in unit volume, high
power weight, cleanliness,
operation on air, and reliability. This
arbitrary division of potential fuel-

in unit

cell advantages into low energy cost
and con.ven'ie1zce makes possible the
simplified classification of fuel cells
shown above.

Any attempt to discuss applica-
detail
when no fuel cell is yet in widespread

tions in is premature now,
use.

At this early stage in their develop-
ment, fuel cells are still costly, and
capital investment required is an ex-
cellent criterion for the selection of
the most promising early applications.
Specialty applications might tolerate
as much as $10,000 per kilowatt _‘in—
stalled; successful central-station ap-
plications are unlikely if the cost per
kilowatt installed greatly exceeds
$100 value for
present conventional central
tions). The present capital cost of
fuel cells will make it difficult for
them to enter products intended for

(an approximate
s t a —

the consumer market.

The classification above is related
to the reactivity requirement. Hydro-
gen has obvious drawbacks as a fuel
in addition to its high cost, but it does
have the great advantage of being
very reactive at the fuel—cell anode
Consequently, it is the fuel most
likely to be used in the first specialty
fuel cells. These would seem easiest
of technical realization since cost is
relatively unimportant.

Hydrogen fuel cells
Four fuel cells, now to be described,

 

have passed most nearly from the re-
search phase to that of engineering
developnient. All use hydrogen. Three
of them use gas—diffusion electrodes,
which are so important in fuel—cell
technology that they too must be
given brief description.

ln 1842, Grove said of his hydrogen-
oxygen cell: “As the .chemical or
could only be
. . . at the line
or watermark where the liquid, gas,

catalytic action
supposed to take place

an(l platina met, the chief difficulty
was to obtain anything like a notable
surface of action.” Over a century
later, we are still struggling “to ob-
tain anything like a notable surface
of action,” andthe gas—diffusion elec-
trode is the major physical advance
in this struggle, while the use of
electrocatalysts is the major chemi-
cal advance.

The purpose of the gas—diffusion
electrode (Fig. 5) is to maximize the
electrode-gas-
eleetrolyte. Therefore it is a11 elec-

three-phase interface:

tronic conductor that consists of a
mass of small pores from 1() to 100
microns (millionths of a meter) in
diameter. These pores provide re-
active surfaces, and allow free en-

r-,

Fig. 5. Schematic cross section of typi-
cal gas-diffusion electrode exaggerates
sizes of pores to show their arrange-
ment. The re-active surface is in the
region where tl1e larger gas-fi-lled pores

merge with the smaller, electrolyte-
filled pores. Excess gas pressure that
keeps electrolyte from flooding elec-
-trode must not be so high that gas
bubbles are blown through into elec-
trolyte.

 

Fig. 6. The Union Carbide fuel battery
consists of 36 hydrogen cells in series.
At atmospheric pressure and a temper~
ature of 40° to 70° -C, the design criteria
for using hydrogen and oxygen are

trance to reactants and free exit to
products. In the latter connection, it
is especially important that liquid
water produced in the cell not remain
behind to drown the electrode. These
complex problems have been solved
in different ways in each of the
three fuel cells next described.

The Bacon cell (Fig. 2) is the
result of engineering research begun
in England by its inventor, F. T.
Bacon, in 1932 and resumed after the
Second World War. Its gas—diffusion
electrodes are nickel (anode) and
nickel coated with lithiated nickel
oxide (cathode). The electrolyte is
strong potassium hydroxide, and the
hydrogen and oxygen should prefer-
ably be of good purity. Removing the
water to keep the electrolyte invari-
ant. requires control gear; in fact, the
considerable auxiliary gear required
to operate the cell may be a draw-
back. In order to satisfy the re-
activity requirement, ‘operation is at
high pressure (up to 600 psi) and
moderately high temperature (near
200°C). As the caption of Fig. 2
shows, remarkable performance has
been achieved, and there has been
subsequent improvement. Ultimate
life of the cell for continuous opera-
tion has not been established. At the
very minimum, the Beacon cell is

a nota.ble landmark in fuel-cell histo-
ry; a battery of such cells successfully
drove a fork—lift truck in 1959.

In the Union Carbide cell (Fig. 6),
great ingenuity has been applied by
Karl Kordesch and his colleagues to
make carbon gas-diffusion electrodes
work satisfactorily below 100° C and
at pressures of at most a few atmos-
pheres. The electrolyte is strong pot-
assium hydroxide. Each electrode is
impregnated with an electrocatalyst
suited to the reaction occurring. This
helps meet the reactivity requirement,
and the electrodes are kept from
drowning by being treated to repel
the electrolyte solution. This re-
pellent treatment is perhaps t h e
weakest feature of the cell, but there
is promise of continued improvement.

In the Justi cell, E. Justi’s imagina-
tive use of nickel in the gas-diffusion
anode has solved the reactivity pro-
blem at this electrode. Raney nickel
sponge, known for its great activity,
is the electrocatalyst, and it is sup-
ported by a skeleton of carbonyl
nickel. Indications are that these
anodes are not wholly invariant. They
seem relatively insusceptible to poi-
soning, but there is some clogging
of pores as by corrosion products
during long continued operation.
Regeneration of the electrodes seems

feasible. The electrolyte is alkaline.
Mo1'e informed judgment about Justi
cell will become possible when the
cathode and the complete cell are
described in the published literature
as completely as the anode has been.

The General Electric fuel cell that
resulted from the work of W. Grubb
and L. Niedrach is distinctive in using
an ion-exchange membrane as a
quasi-solid electrolyte and in not
using gas-diffusion electrodes. The
electrodes it does use do not drown,
and their structure presents no barrier
to nitrogen removal, so operation on
air is easy. If the gases" are pure,
operation under a static head is
possible.

The electrolyte may be envisioned
as a three-dimensional polymer net
work to which sulfuric acid has been
attached as a sulfonic group and in
which the interstices are filled with
“bound” water. Hydrogen ion from
the sulfuric acid moves freely through
this water. The electr_ocatalysts are
noble metals (platinum, palladium)
bonded to the membrane to form a
structure so simple and compact that
an isolated cell (housing not in-
cluded) need be only 0.125 in. thick.
Reactivity is moderately good, 30
amp/ft.9 being attainable at 0.7V. At
low current density, 3 amp/ft? at

0.9 V, continuous operation is feasible
for years. Although the present mem-
branes permit the building of suc-
cessfully demonstrable devices (Fig.
7,) some improved polymeric materi-
als for these membranes are desirable
and appear to the forthcoming. At
present, the cost of the cells re-
stricts them to selected specialty ap-
plications, in which they have a good
chance of being the ﬁrst fuel cells
in use.
State of the art

Clearly, the hydrogen fuel cell is
farthest advanced. The high-tem-
perature cell for carbonaceous fuels
is a considerable distance behind. A
cell that would use hydrocarbons or
alcohols or similar substances at or
near room temperature under invari-

' ant conditions has not yet been pub-

licity demonstrated at acceptable
current densities and voltages. There
is in the background the possibility
that catalyticthermal conversion of
hydrocarbons and Water to carbon
dioxide and hydrogen may progress to
the point Where fuel-cell operation
on hydrogen from a compact conver-
ter will be practical. For the present,
it is well to close with the guarded
prediction that a successful specialty
fuel-cell application should be less
than ﬁve years away.

If I join

the Timken
Company
after
graduation,
what

will they do
for me?

The Timken Roller Bearing Company

Every man with any job hunting experience knows not to ask that question.

And yet, we think it has some validity. After all, a man’s growth can
depend as much on the company he works for as the company’s growth
depends on the man (remember, there are no statues to committees).

So to invest in your growth, and ours, every young graduate engineer
who joins the Timken Company spends from one to four years in one of
22 individualized training programs.

Extensive training

Instruction takes place on the job and in training sessions. Later there are
executive development programs at leading universities.

But don’t misunderstand us. The Timken Company is not a graduate
school. With us, you earn as you learn.

As one of our engineers, you’ll learn much of what we know about tapered
roller bearings, or ﬁne alloy steel, and their inﬁnite applications. Hopefully,
you’ll teach us something, too.

You can be an indoor-type working on straight application engineering,
research, testing and production. Or you can be an indoor-outdoor-type
and work in sales engineering. It doesn’t matter———choice of assignment is
up to you.

Challenging assigmnents
If you choose the latter group, you’ll work in automotive, industrial, and
railway bearing sales—or steel sales—helpin g customers solve their engineering
problems, which are also ours. ‘

Some of our recent efforts: bearing engineering for a telephone cable-laying
ship now crossing the Paciﬁc, the Alweg Monorail, the world’s tallest crane
and biggest strip mining shovel, Craig Breedlove’s Spirit of America, a
moveable grandstand for the new District of Columbia stadium. Steel prob-
lem solving for Atlas missile silos, Project Mohole, the latest Kaman Heli-
copters, a 400-foot crane boom and hundreds of automotive gear and die
applications.

We won’t forget you

Advancement is not restricted to one department or division. A steel sales
engineer may be transferred to automotive sales and from there to Inter-
national. Whatever your job, we’ll never forget where we’ve put you. This is
one of the advantages of working for a company that is the world’s largest
producer of tapered roller bearings and a foremost producer of seamless
steel tubing, but is not the world’s largest corporation. We employ about
20,000.

The Timken Company has three products: Bearings, Steel, Rock Bits.
Uses for these products number in the growing thousands. And there is
always something new stirring.

The dramatic switch of the nation’s railroad freight cars to roller bearings,
a ﬁeld we pioneered, is an example.

An international company
There are 31 Timken Company sales ofﬁces in the United States and Canada.
Practically every major city has one.

We serve markets in 119 countries from 14 manufacturing plants located
in Australia, Brazil, Canada, England, France, South Africa and the U.S.
And we’re still growing strong.

If you are, too, we’d like to hear from you. Write to Department MC for

HYPERVELO CITY

Since the end of World War ll, research scientists have been able to launch.
particles at true hypervelocity speeds. Now, rneteoroicl simulation is possible

under laboratory conditions.

Early this year the U.S. Explorer
XVI was badly damaged by meteo-
roid penetration. Such damage con-
stitutes one of the space exploration
problems that must be solved before
astronauts can safely venture into
space. It also dramatizes the impor-
tance of gaining knowledge about the
character of ultra-high-speed bodies
in the laboratory so that penetration-
resistant materials can properly be
developed.

It is generally agreed in the ﬁeld of
mechanics that hypervelocity research
refers to the study of objects moving
at rates above 10,000 feet per second
(fps), roughly two miles per second
or over 11 times faster than the pre-
sent speed of jet passenger planes.
Compared to the normal pace of
sound ambling through the_ atmos-
phere at 1,100 fps, the lowest order
of hypervelocity_is impressive; even
the bullet of a high powered rifle,
which can reach 4,400 fps, fails to
qualify for this class. On the other
hand, the slowest meteoroids consider-
ably exceed the lower limits of hyper-
velocity. These extra-terrestrial bodies
rush through space from 30,000 to
270,000 fps. Man-made machines are
now approaching these speeds. Earth-
orbiting satellites ordinarily travel
25,000 fps, and interplanetary probes,
like the recent Mariner II, reach
speeds close to 37,000 fps before
escaping the earth’s gravitational
force.

Scientists have only recently begun
to propel bodies at these speeds under
the controlled and measurable condi-
tions of the laboratory. Man’s efforts
to achieve true hypervelocity, how-
ever, precedes the space age by well

By Frank J. Zimmerman

over a decade. Early attempts evolved
out of research on high explosives.
R. W. Wood in 1936, for example,
recognized the usefulness of metallic
liners in the “Monroe” cavity charge
to produce particles accelerated to
extremely high velocity. This tech-
nique, commonly referred to as a
shaped charge, is now used in anti-
tank projectiles to penetrate the
tank’s thick armor plate. And al-

though no actual weapon has yet been

developed whose shell can reach true
hypervelocity rates, the higher speeds
attained have improved penetration
and hit probability.

Although the Germans had worked
hard during World War II at develop-
ing an electrical gun, no device what-
ever had achieved hypervelocity
speeds before 1946. At that time
Armour Research Foundation scien-
tists were studying captured equip-
ment and documents to evaluate the
progress G ermany had made in
this field of endeavor. Meanwhile
Dr. W. D. Crozier and Dr. W.
Hume of the New Mexico School of

Mines developed the ﬁrst hyper-
velocity gun — not a in the popular
understanding, but a laboratory

facility dozens of feet long. It was
constructed on a Navy contract for
a classified investigation. Instead of
using a charge of conventional powder
to propel the projectile, it employed
a gas with low molecular weight
(helium) to achieve velocities of ap-
proximately 12,000 fps. The light gas
gun is now one of the leading tools
in the field of hypervelocity research.

Since then several other types of
hypervelocity launchers have been
developed. One of these is the explo-

sive accelerator. In this device the
shaped charge principle is applied to
propel single particles to velocities of
about 30,000 fps and groups of micron-
size bodies to speeds of nearly 70,000
fps. This high velocity makes the ap-
proach attractive. The major dis-
advantage, however, is that it is very
difficult to determine the size, and
weight of the generated particles.
The problem is compounded because
of the difficulty in determining the
speeds of projectiles, singly or in
groups, and in correlating impaction
craters with appropriated particles.

Another launcher was an electrical
means to accelerate projectiles. This
is done in a number of ways. One is
by electrically heating a volume of
light gas with a capaciter discharge
and then using the gas to drive a
particle from a tube. Another ap-
proach is to create ahigh pressure
plasma by rapid electrical discharge
through a wire or coil. This plasma is
used to accelerate one or more parti-
cles to hypervelocities up to 100,000
fps.

Electrostatic accelerators are also
in use for hypervelocity research.
With this type of launcher a small
number of particles are charged to a
high potential and injected into an
electrostatic ﬁeld (which uses poten-
tials as high as two million volts).
The action of the strong ﬁeld causes
the particles to be accelerated to
speeds close to 50,000 fps. This device
has been used extensively for calibra-
tion of meteoroid detectors for satel-
lite systems.

One remaining approach to hyper-
velocity is the traveling charge gun.
This is conventional

similar to a

This large hyperveloci_ty range — constructed with a 155 mm. “Long Tom,” six 150 mm. Howitzersj, and three new 1.4-inch
launch tubes — is housed in its own building at ARF’s facility in Gary, Indiana. It is capable of launching various-shaped
projectiles as wide as 1.4 inches and as heavy as 75 grams at approximately 20,000 fps.

gun except that the charge is attach-
ed to the projectile instead of being
contained loosely in the breech. Ve-
locities achieved with the apparatus,
however, are at the lower end of the
hypervelocity range.

At ARF the greatest emphasis has
been placed on the light gas type of
launcher primarily because of its
ability to achieve hypervelocities with
discrete particles of known size and
shape. This system operates in a
manner similiar to that of a conven-
tional gun except that the power
charge is replaced with a high pressure
gas of low molecular weight. This is
done so that less of the system’s
energy is expended in moving the gas
itself, allowing more energy to be
transmitted to the projectile and
translated to higher velocity.

In a light gas gun, a somewhat
complicated method is required to
develop sufficiently high pressures.
The operation involves two stages:
ﬁrst, compression of low—pressure,
light gas in a long tube by means of
a piston driven by a power charge,
and, secondly, application of the pres-
sure to the projectile causing it to be
driven out of a launch tube. The

compression tube is connected to the
launch tube with a high pressure
coupling which stops the piston at
the end of its stroke. The projectile,
mounted i11 this section at the en-
trance to the launch tube, is restrain-
ed from motion until the piston has
compressed the light gas to a very
high pressure at the end of its stroke.
At this point, the gas drives the pro-
jectile from the launch tube.

The first light gas gun at ARF was
installed in 1958 and developed in
1959 for a research program that was
directed to the study of the inter-
action of high velocity particles in a
rareﬁed atmosphere. It proved to be
unsatisfactory, it was
unable to simulate velocities of
25,000 fps. Engineers worked at im-

h()\VCVCI‘, HS

proving its performance by electrical
augmentation. Meanwhile, a gun with
a .30,()00 fps. capacity was developed
in California. This gun employed a
deformable plastic piston and a taper-
ed high pressure section to obtain
maximum velocity.

Two guns of this type were built
here in 1960. These guns use a 20
mm pump section and either a
a .30 caliber launch tube. The over-
all length of the launcher is approxi-
Inately 20 feet. The ranges into which

.29. or

they fire are about 15 feet long and
are capable of being evacuated to an
altitude simulation of 300,000 feet.
The instrumentation sections of the
ranges are 12 inches in diameter and
are equipped with regularly spaced
viewing ports for observation of in-
flight or impacting particles. Special
photo-multipliers are used in the
velocity determination system. Vari-
ous shapes have been launched on
each of these ranges using sabots ——
that is, lightweight carriers used to
hold the projectile and seal the barrel
during launching. These are separated
from the projectile prior to impaction.

There were two reasons for con-
structing these facilities. One of them
was that this type of light gas gun was
the simplest and fastest way to ultra-
high velocities. The other was that
continually expanding research activ-
ity required a second range, which is
also being used to further develop
electrical augmentation techniques
aimed at achieving velocities 11p to
50,000 fps. They are presently being
used on two programs for the Air
Force. One of them is aimed at veri-
fication of a specific theory on pene-
tration of multiple plate targets by a
h_Vpervelocity particle. Various pro-
jectile conﬁgurations are being launch-

computer—controlled system.

Westinghouse has developed such a system. It is called the Transit Expressway. It looks so

impact measurements are then being
made with the ﬂash X-ray unit to
determine the results of the particles’

other program deals with the effects

shapes.

By 1961 there was a need to launch
larger projectiles of complicated
shapes such as rods, washers, and
aerodynamics shapes which were too
large for the two small guns just de-
scribed. Consequently the Foundation
built Hypervelocity Range No. 3,
which is also an accelerated reservoir
type light gas gun, but with a capacity
of launching particles up to .6 inch
in diameter. This gun uses a 1.5 inch
pump tube and a .60 caliber launch
tube. The total length is over 40 feet.
The velocity limits are the same as on
ranges one and two, but it can launch
projectiles from 1.2 to 10 grams. This
range is fully instrumented to deter
mine projectile size, shape, integrity,
and velocity as well as operating
pressure.

A fourth range has recently been
built. It uses a shock-heated light gas
gun to accelerate projectiles 1.4 inches
in diameter weighing from 30 to 75
grams. This launcher is currently

undergoing a final checkout prior to
becoming operational. It is consider-
ably more formidable than the
smaller caliber guns. Its si'ze has re-

quired installation in its own building.
The gun itself was constructed from a
surplus Army 155-mm “Long Tom,”
six 105 mm Howitzers and three new
1.4-inch launch tubes. Thirteen feet
of the Long Tom is used for the
primary powder chamber. The pump
tube uses 23 feet of the 105 mm
Howitzers; the launch tube is 25 feet
long. An alternate version of this
gun is also being constructed which
increases the length of the pump tube
to 45 feet. While the smaller launch-
ers use from less than a tenth of a
pound of powder to about three-
quarters of a pound, this gun uses a
charge of six to eight pounds of pro-
pellant, which generates about three
million foot-pounds of energy, enough
force to lift a 2,000 ton freighter
one foot.

The maximum propulsion capabil-
ity of this launcher is expected to be
about 24,000 fps for the lightweight
projectiles, and somewhat less for
heavier ones.

In addition to the regular velocity
and shadow-graph instrumentation,
certain special-purpose equipment is
used on these ranges. Included are
spectrographs, monochrometers, flash
X-ray systems, and ultraviolet mea-
suring equipment. One of the most
interesting items, currently employed
on a dynamic impact study, is the
sequential flash X—ray system. This
equipment is capable of taking four

flash radiographs simultaneously or
with discrete time delays between
each channel.

Since the exposure times are very .

short (20 x 10-9 seconds), it is possi-
ble to photographically “stop" the
highest velocity particles. A special
section, three feet in length, has been
constructed to accommodate. this
system. This section has been de-
signed to allow maximum flexibility
for studying all phases of impact,
and it can be attached to any of the
ranges in use.

These ranges are being used in four
research areas: the study of solids
under very high pressures and loading
rates; impact studies; launcher re-
search which involves associated pro-
blems in physics, metallurgy, chem-
istry, electronics and ﬂuid dynamics;
and meteoroid simulation.

In the area of high pressure loading
in solids, a number of programs are
underway. One of the most important
of these, directed toward a better
understanding of the transmission of
intense stress or shock pulses in
materials, is the development of
suitable gages for measuring pressures
in the high kilobar and low megabar
pressure ranges. The primary diffi-
culties are in finding materials and
geometries which will withstand the
transient pressure levels encountered
and,. once found, in designing a gage
which can be placed in a sample

without. changing its characteristics.

Other programs are aimed toward
more basic of the
manner in which shock waves pro-
pagate through materials.
This knowledge has wide application
in the determination of the equations
of solids, in the effects of underground
explosions, and in the detection of

determinations

various

nuclear explosions.

The requirements of space travel
have spurred a continuous research
activity aimed at increasing the
velocity of

launcher perform-

obtainable projectiles.
Improvement in
ance will make possible more mean-
ingful experiments such as simulation
of re-entry trajectories reaching well
into. the spectrum of meteoroid vel-
ocities. This development work is
being pursued in two programs. One
is directed at studying the import.ant
parameter of the traveling charge
gun. The other involves electrically
augmenting the light gas gun-.
Without suitable equipment, mete-
oroi(l simulation is one of the most
difficult problems in hyper—velocity
research. One reason is that the best
current laboratory methods of pro-
pecting particles are limited to veloci-
ties of 3(),00() to 6(),()()() fps. In addi-

_tion, the distribution of meteoroids

is such that the majority are minute.
In order to concentrate simulation
schemes on the most common type
of meteoroid, one. must deal with
particles of micron size (a few ten-
thousandths of an inch) traveling‘
nearly 100,000 fps. Accelerating and
making dynamic measurements on
particles of this type is extremely
difficult and — obviously — beyond
our present. ability.

The task is further complicated by
a relative lack of knowledge about
composition of meteoroids. This does
not imply a criticism of astronomers.
In fact., it is quite remarkable that
we have as m11ch information as we
do when one considers that all avail-
able information has been obtained
by observing the effects produced by
the earth’s
of the

environment at
atmosphere.

On the basis of such observations,
it is estimated that meteoroids vary
in density from .05 gram per cubic

centimeter to 8 grams per cubic centi-
meter, and that they range from
stone to iron in composition. The
lower density particles are thought
to be. lacy porous structures, while
the more dense particles are assumed
to be more compact and rocklike. The
lower density particles are probably
brittle like ordinary ston_e.
Meteoroid simulation in the labor-
atory has been based in the velocity
available in hopes that extrapolation
to high velocities is valid. As far as
composition is concerned, a number
of approaches is being followed. The
most common is to use glassy parti-
cles that have a density somewhere
in the meteoroid range. The extreme-
ly small particles generated by ex-
plosive means have been measured
on a statistical basis with micro in-
struments, while more easily obtained
data have been gathered on larger
light gas and
extrapolated down to the more
characteristic meteoroid The
work performed to date indicates that

ber guns at candidate structural
samples; impact effects are then
determined.

Various materials and conﬁgura-
tions are being investigated to deter-
mine their effectiveness for meteoroid
shieldiiig of space vehicles. One of the
most promising of these, on the basis
of preliminary investigations, is fiber
metal. This material, developed in
our laboratories, consists of a matrix
of fine metal ﬁbers which are felted,
pressed, and sintered. This method
of fabrication produces solid connec-
tions at each junction of the ﬁbers
which results in good mechanical in-
tegrity. In this way the density of a
metal structure can be considerably
reduced without sacrificing strength.
The resulting w e i g h t advantage
makes the material highly attractive
for space applications.

The final solution to the problem
I against
meteoroid penetration will be a major
achievement in the development of
space travel. It certainly will be the
most dramatic demonstration of the
importance of hypervelocity research.
Equally significant, perhaps, will be
the industrial application of the
knowledge gained in this endeavor
to help get man to the moon.

EXCITINGTHINGS HAPPEN AT FORD MOTOR COMPANY !

THE 100,000-MILE
ENGINEERING TEST
THAT SET OVER 100
NEW WORLD RECORDS

It began September 2! in Florida, when a team of tour
1964 Comets, specially equipped and prepared for
high-speed driving, set out to do the equivalent of four
earth orbits at Daytona International Speedway—l00,000
miles at speeds well over 100 miles an hour, round
the clock for 40 days, through weather fair and foul.

They did it, all four of them, and they made history!
They did it in the full glare of publicity. In semi-tropical
heat. ln the teeth of torrential squalls that fringed two
hurricanes. Including time out for refueling and mainte-
nance, the lead car averaged over l08 miles an hour,
toppling over l00 national and world recordsl*

For all practical purposes this was an engineering trial
—the most grueling test of staying power and durability
ever demanded of a new car. Only near perfection

could stand the punishment dished out to parts and
components hour after hour, mile after mile. Brakes,
engines, transmissions, ignition systems—every single
part a pawn in a grim game of truth or consequence,
with total product quality the stake. And they all came
through hands down!

Now that it's over and in the record books, what does
it mean? New proof of Ford-built stamina and dura-
bility! New evidence that Ford-built means better built!
Yes—and more, it is a direct reflection of the confidence
and creative know-how, the spirit and spunk of Ford
Motor Company's engineering, styling and manufac-
turing team—men who find rewarding adventure in
technical breakthroughs.

what’s new

Recently in Philadelphia at the General Electric Switchgear development
laboratory, engineers have completed what is described as the most powerful
high—voltage testing laboratory.

Housed in a new addition to the existing laboratory, the compound circuit
is capable of delivering more than 70,000 MVA of short circuit current and
Voltage to circuit breakers under test. Besides, this, the transient impedance
and transient recovery voltage imposed on a circuit breaker in actual service
will be supplied by the circuit.

The circuit is described by engineers as a compound circuit. The principale
of this is to create in the laboratory equivalent field conditions by combining
high short circuit current for a generator source with high voltage from
stored—energy capacitors and automatically synchronizing the two.

The expanded facilities are a result of the higher voltages and interrupting
ratings that will be required on EHV circuit breakers. This is due to the

V
trend toward power—pooling, to increase generator and transmission capacities,
to high speed interruption and the need for greater system stability.

Another development in the field of lasers has been .,
devised at Bell Telephone Laboratories. This new develop— ;
ment is a miniature helium—neon gas laser that emits only J
a single frequency of visible red light. The length of its ,

discharge tube is only two inches, its diameter is 0.04 inches
and it operates continuously at room temperatures on *1"
direct current. The frequency of oscillation is very stable ..
and the power of the emitted coherent light is eompara— if

tively high for the laser’s small size.

Previous gas lasers, because of their large size, can 
oscillate at many optical frequencies simultaneously; and
they are difficult to stabilize against frequency fluctuations.
The new lasers, because of their short length oscillate at 4..
only one frequency. Also, they are much less susceptible

to Vibration, thus considerably simplifying the problem If
of achieving frequency stability. .-
The combination of stability plus single frequency
oscillation is very useful in that the laser can act  a if’
very precise measuring instrument. If one of the mirrors ’
is connected to a positioning device, very slight changes ‘V

in position will cause the later to shift frequency. Dis-
placements considerably less than one millionth of an inch

properties of the plastic.

Through Dr. Hansens work, he found that many

local hot spots in solutions of gas in molten plastic passing

.. through an extruder significantly increase the number
and decrease the size of the bubbles formed in the platsic.

He also found that certain materials added to the plastic

"‘ will generate such hot spots by both chemical and ‘physical
effects. For example, he added carbon black particles to
solutions of gas in molten polymer. As the plastic emerged
from the extruder, he heated it with several projection
lamps. The plastic expanded in areas around the carbon
black particles and fine bubbles appeared. When he used
certain organic materials, he found that hot spots created
by chemical decomposition were even more effective than

carbon black in nucleating fine cells.

A more economical foamed plastic wire insulation
with better dielecttic properties has been invented by Dr.
Ralph H. Hansen of Bell Telephone Laboratories. The
plastic insulation is created by what he calls the “hot
spot” theory; that is, the more hot spots in a plastic, the
more bubbles created, and thus, the better the insulating

The Naval Electroncis Laboratory’s deep—diving bathyscaph Trieste, used
to probe for the missing submarine Thresher, found a new use for another
Generel Electric oil in the design of its propulsion unit.

The need for this oil was created by the extreme pressures and low
temperatures which must withstood by the propulsion motor in deep ex-
plorations of the ocean. Open spaces between the motor and its enclosure
necessitated that method be found to equalize the internal and external
pressures. This is to prevent possible collapse and subsequent damage.

One method of achieving this involved filling the tank with an oil and
sealing the motor inside. Protruding from the tank is the rubber hose. The
sea pressure is transmitted via the collapsible hoes thru the oil to the interior
of the enclosure to equalize the difference in pressures.

The desired properties of the oil included the ability to withstand pressures
up to 15,000 psi’s and remain fluid at temperatures below 32° F. It was also
required that the material’ be light enough to afford some buoyancy. A third
consideration was that the oil, which would come into Contact with the motor
windings, not have an adverse effect on insulation, which could be a cause
of electrical failure.

U. s. CITIZENSHIP REQUIRED
An equal opportunity employer.

Here are 6 reasons why you should
spend at least the next four years
with us...

You’ll ﬁnd that at least a few of
these six advantages are exclusive
with the civilian Navy generally,
and especially with the world-
renowned Naval Ordnance Labo-
ratory because of its perenially
powerful role in government weap-
onry research. No “Blue Sky”
promises here—-you’l1 soon see
why these advantages make sense
individually, and why collectively
they represent a career develop-
ment opportunity you really
should consider.

1 Vital assignments of national
importance

Whatever programs you may work
on . . . missile guidance, weapons
systems, re-entry components,
underwater ordnance, ﬁre control,
sonar, fuzes, sonobuoys, nuclear
explosives, propellants, solid state,
acoustics, infrared . . . you see
and follow the big picture, from
initial concept to ﬂeet acceptance.
More than 95 major weapons de-
vices developed at NOL are in
ﬂeet use today.

2 Training programs encourage
Breadth of Experience

During your ﬁrst year you will
rotate through four assignments
in research, engineering, and
evaluation. This enables you to
understand the whole and to help
select a permanent assignment
area.

3 Who|Iy- or Partly-Paid
Graduate Education Programs

Various accredited graduate pro-

grams, both with local institutions
or the university of your choice,
permit you to attain your ad-
vanced degrees. Many courses are
held right at NOL, and enable
young professionals to work full
time while participating. Most
such programs provide for reim-
bursement of tuition. Stipends, in
some cases, are available.

 Professional Stature and
Future Opportunity

NOL retains patents in the em-
ployee’s name for professional
purposes, and for commercial
rights in some instances. Attend-
ance at professional meetings is
encouraged, and there is ample
opportunity to conduct founda-
tional research. At the end of
these four years, many doors to
the future will be open to you . . .
as a professional engineer with an
unusually strong R & D back-
ground.

5 Top-Flight Equipment &
Facilities

Because so much in-house work

—$30 MILLION annually—goes
beyond the existing and known,
NOL has many of the ﬁnest re-
search and development facilities
available anywhere. NOL head-
quarters spread over nearly 1,000
acres of suburban Maryland just
outside Washington, D. C. (now
one of the nation’s leading R & D
centers). You may also work at
NOL test facilities elsewhere in
Maryland, in Virginia, and Florida
. . as well as with the operating
units of the ﬂeet. -

6 Reach the $10,000 to $12,000
level within 4 years

New and virtually unknown is
the fact that the new government
salary structure lets you earn more
than $10,000 within four years. . .
PLUS all the beneﬁts of Career
Civil Service.

What makes a Company“Modern”?

Not size. Not capital resources. Certainly not
age. At Celanese, we believe it is the degree to
which a company is equipped to meet the present
and future needs of its customers.

Efficient plant. Contemporary product. Aggres-
sive management. Industrious work force. The
ability to think ahead of the situation and be ready
for the problem when it occurs.

Celanese happens to be a young company. Much
more important, it’s a modern company.

Perhaps you’re among the men who will help

keep us modern. If you are trained in chemical
engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical
engineering, chemistry, or physics, we hope you
will stop in to see our representative when he
visits your campus. Or write directly to us, brieﬂy
outlining your background.

Are you interested in a career in management?

The key words are “career” and “management.”

The Bethlehem Loop Course is designed not to place a
man in a job, but to start a man on a career. Although we
have a speciﬁc initial job assignment in mind for every
man we recruit for the Loop Course, that assignment is
just the ﬁrst step toward increasing levels of responsibility.

The Bethlehem Loop..Course is designed to train men for
management. We select men whom we feel have the po-
tential; we start them out with an intensive ﬁve weeks’
course that gives them a comprehensive knowledge of the
Company’s operations; we follow this up with a training
program at the facility or within the department to which
he is ﬁrst assigned. A steel plant man, for instance, will

BETHLEHEM STEEL

An equa/ opporfun/'t_y emp/oyer

be given general plant training for a number of weeks; a
sales looper trains for a full year before he starts actual
selling.

Think it over. It should be abundantly clear that we
have a big stake in our loopers. We do everything in our
power to assure that you make good progress—the rest
is up to you.

If you are interested in a career in management with
one of the nation’s largest and most dynamic industrial
concerns, we urge you to read our booklet, “Careers with
Bethlehem Steel and the Loop Course.” You can get a
copy at your Placement Office, or by sending a postcard
to our Personnel Division, Bethlehem, Pa.

Wisconsin, 1962, is shown examining
combustion liners after a thermal
paint engine test at Allison Division,
General Motors, Indianapolis, Indi-
ana. Thermal paint, developed by
Allison, is used to determine temper-
ature gradients existing on engine
parts.

Gooderum is one of the young engi-
neers at Allison assigned to design
and development of air-cooled tur-
bine engine hardware. This work in-
volves rig testing of turbine engine
parts to determine optimum conﬁgu-
rations. Parts later are endurance-
tested on engines to prove the design.

New, air-cooled turbine blades de-
veloped by Allison engineering have
permitted more than 250 °F higher
turbine inlet temperatures on turbo-
prop engines, providing as much as
63% increased horsepower for the
same engine envelope.

We think you, too, will like the
creative climate at Allison, as well as
the advantages of being associated
with a long—established leader in the
design, development and production

During the aircraft carrier Princeton’s 1958 Far East
cruise, the consumption of fresh water was greater than
the evaporations could keep pace with. The executive
officer, trying every means to curb consumption, put the
following in the plan-of-the-day:

* * * *

“The U.S.S. Constitution (old Iron-Sides) as a
combat vessel carried 48,600 gallons of fresh water for her
crew of 475 men. This was sufficient to last six months
of sustained operations. Total evaporators installed:
None.”

The next day the Princeton’s daily news—letter
quoted the statement, adding this historical note:

“On August 23, 1779, the U.S.S. Constitution set
sail from Boston. She left with 475 officers and men,
48,600 gallons of fresh water, 7400 cannon shot, 11,600
rounds of black powder and 79,500 gallons of rum. Her
mission — to destroy and harass English shipping.

“Making Jamaica on 6 October, she took 826
pounds of flour and 68,300 gallons of rum. Then she
headed for the Azores, arriving there on 12 November.
She provisioned with 550 pounds of beef and 64,300
gallons of Portuguese wine. On 18 November, she set
sail for England.

In the ensuing days she defeated five British men-of-
war and captured and scuttled twelve English merchant-
men, salvaging only the rum. By 27 January, her power
and shot were exhausted.

“Unarmed, she made a night raid up the Firth
of Clyde. Her landing party captured a whiskey dis-
tillery and transferred 40,000 gallons aboard by dawn.
Then she returned home.

“U.S.S. Constitution arrived in Boston on 20 Feb-
ruary, 1870 with no cannon, no shot, no food, no power,
no rum, no whiskey, and 48,600 gallons of stagnant water.”

The engineer just back from hunting was describing
the trip. “Well, there was that big black bear hiding
behind the tree. I realized that I had o_1ly one shot and
that has to be bounced off the canyon wall. Well, I
calculate the angle of approach, the windage, and how
much ‘the bullet would deflect due to the flattening after
hitting the canyon wall.

“Did you kill the bear,” asked his friends.

Replied the engineer, “No, I missed the wall.’’

A cross—eyed Woodpecker with a cork leg and a
synthetic rubber bill requires four and one—half hours to
peek three—fourths the distance through a cypress log
108 years old. Shingles cost 79 cents per hundred and
weigh eight ounces each.

The log being peeked upon is 34 feet long and weighs
46 pounds per foot. Assuming that the coefficient of
friction between the cypress log and the bill is 0.069
and that there is negligible resistance to diffusion, how
many units of vitamin B-1 will the Woodpecker require
in peeking out enough shingles for a $7,500 barn with a
detachable chicken house?

gets time and a half for overtime.)

. . . Robert Hooke. Walker and Company Publisher . . .
January, 1964 . . . 256 pages . . . $5.95.

The Science of Science introduces the Westinghouse
Search Books series with a philosophical discussion of
science as a whole — the scientist’s approach, his purpose
and his methods. These methods are a science in them-
selves —— definition of the question, development of suit-
able tests, and finally, analysis of the results. The scientific
method is illustrated by a description of the classic
Michelson experiment and the development of Einstein’s
-theory of relativity.

Units of measurement are a fundamental tool of
science. Historical notes on some of the typical units of
measurement that have evolved are included. Unfortu-
nately, as new scientific areas such as nuclear physics
develop, the units established are often convenient for
that particular discipline but differ with units already
used in other fields of science. This lack of compatibility
between units of measurement causes much concern
among scientists.

Mathematics plays an essential role in the gathering
and analysis of scientific data. For example, all measure-
ment, no matter how accurate, contains variations because
of the tools used for measurement and the conditions
under which the measurement must be made. Mathe-
matical techniques such as sampling, probability theory,
and statistical analysis make it possible to evaluate the
measurement accurately.

Scientists have developed an array of sensing devices
to supplement the human senses, which, from a scientific
standpoint, are limited in many respects. Devices for ex-
tending each of the human senses are described. l\"Ian’s
perception of space, motion, an(l time has also been im-
proved by development of extremely accurate measuring
devices. Examples include atomic clocks that can keep
time to an accuracy of one second in 300 years.

But no matter how sophisticated the scientist’s
measuring device, he is eventually limited by the very
medium in which he must work — the discontinuous
makeup of nature. The atomic “randomness” that must
exist in fundamental noise, and it can be classified in
several basic categories depending on the phenomenon
involved. Shot noise, photon noise, and thermal noise are
some of the categories described.

In all scientific endeavor, the scientist has certai11
basic anchor points from which he can work -_-— the uni-
versal constants of physics, such as the Boltzmann lc,
Planck’s Constant, the charge of an electron, and the
velocity of light. Constants such as these, which are

amazingly few, remain unchanged — or do they? Some
scientists have proposed that even these universal con-
stants vary with space and time — with the age and

radius of the universe.

With this speculative ending, the authors hope to
inspire the scientists of the future — the intended audi-
ence for the Search series.

The chemistry of photography is far from being all of
chemistry that concerns us. Actually, it is rapidly going
into hiding inside such machines as these automatic x-ray
processors for hospitals, seen here under construction.

We need electromechanical engineers to design all
kinds of automatic photographic apparatus that we have
ideas for—big ones, little ones, simple ones, super-sophisti-
cated ones, inexpensive ones to sell by the millions, very
expensive ones for maybe internal use only.

We need process engineers, by which we mean those
who ﬁgure out the best way to make what the designers
have dreamed up.

The Role of
R&D in Industry

Q. Dr. Haller, how does General Electric define that overworked term, Re-

search and Development?

. At General Electric we consider “R&D” to cover a whole spectrum of

activities, ranging from basic scientiﬁc investigation for its own sake to
the constant efforts of engineers in our manufacturing departments to
improve their products—even in small ways. Somewhere in the middle
of this range is an area we call simply “technology”, the practical know-
how that couples scientiﬁc knowledge with the engineering of products
and services to meet customer needs.

. How is General Electric organized to do research and development?
. Our Company has four broad product groups——Aerospace and Defense,

Consumer, Electric Utility, and Industrial. Each group is divided into
divisions, and each division into departments. The departments are like
separate businesses, responsible for engineering their products and serving
their markets. So one end of the R&D spectrum is clearly a department
function——engineering and product design. At the other end is the Re-
search Laboratory which performs both basic and applied research for
the whole Company, and the Advanced Technology Laboratories which
also works for the whole Company in the vital linking function of putting
new knowledge to practical use.

Having centralized services of Research and Advanced Technology does
not mean that divisions or departments cannot set up their own R&D
operations, more or less specialized to their technical or market interests.
There are many such laboratories; e.g., in electronics, nuclear power, space
technology, polymer chemistry, jet engine technology, and so on.

. Doesn’t such a variety of kinds of R&D hamper the Company’s potential

contribution? Don’t you find yourselves stepping on each other’s toes?

. On the contrary! With a great many engineers and scientists working

intensively on the problems they understand better than anyone else, we
go ahead simultaneously on many fronts. Our total effort is broadened.
Our central, Company-wide services in Research and Advanced Tech-
nology are enhanced by this variety of effort by individual departments.

. How is Advanced Technology Services organized?
. There are three Advanced Technology Laboratories: Chemical and

Materials Engineering, Electrical and Information Engineering, and Me-
chanical Engineering; and the Nuclear Materials and Propulsion Opera-
tion. The Laboratories do advanced technology work on their own, with
Company funds, and on contract to product departments or outside customers
and government agencies. NMPO works for the AEC and the military to
develop materials and systems for high-temperature, high-power, low-
weight nuclear reactors. ATS is the Company’s communication and in-
formation center for disseminating new technologies. It also plans and
develops potential new business areas for General Electric.

. So R&D at General Electric is the work of a great many men in a great

many areas?

. Of course. The world is going through a vast technological revolution—

in the ways men can handle energy, materials, and information. Our
knowledge is increasing exponentially. In the last five years we have
spent more than half the money ever spent for research and development.
To keep competitive, and to grow, industry must master that mountain of
new knowledge and ﬁnd ways to put it to practical use for mankind. Only
by knowing his field well and keeping up with the rush of new develop-
ments, can the young engineer -contribute to the growth of his industry-
and society as a whole.

Superconductive computer Memory

Pictured above is a radically new type of
thin ﬁlm superconductive array capable of
storing 16,384 bits of data in an area smaller
than a playing card. This array is a step toward
a high-speed all electronic memory of hundreds
of millions or billions of bits, which is a
storage capacity now attainable only in slow
electromechanical devices.

The structure becomes superconducting with
its immersion in liquid helium; two pulses of
positive or negative electric current are sent
through the selection trees to a selected inter-
section. Their combined effect at the chosen in-
tersection produces a “normal” or non-super-
conducting area in the tin layer directly beneath.

When this occurs, a microscopic ring of
electric current is induced and instantly trapped
in the tin at this point. As the pulses cease,
the area again becomes superconductive, and
the stored current remains, moving in its micro-
scopic circle in either a clockwise or counter-
clockwise direction according to the positive
or negative character of the pulses that induced
it. In computer language, this stored current
represents one bit of information—a “zero”
or a “one,” depending upon its direction.

When the information is to be recalled by
the computer, two pulses are again sent to
the same intersection. If their polarity (positive
or negative) is the same as that of the stored
current, nothing happens. If it is opposite, the
direction of the stored current will be reversed
and a read out voltage will be induced in a
simple box-like structure extending under the
whole memory plane. The presence or absence
of this signal is part of a code which is deci-
phered electronically to obtain the desired
information.

Sun-Pumped Continuous Laser

Laser (optical-maser) action has been
achieved in CaF2:Dy2+ at liquid neon tem-
perature (27° K) using the sun as the pumping
source. The minimum power required to obtain
laser oscillations could be supplied with a
l0-inch-diameter condensing mirror. Laser
action at liquid-nitrogen temperature is antici-
pated using a 20-inch—diameter condensing
mirror.

Laser action in the CaF2:Dy2+ system was
reported at 2.36 microns. The laser oscillation
takes place in the sharp 517 —> 51a 4f - 4f
transitions, and it is pumped in broad 4f - 5d
absorption bands starting at 10,000 cm-1 and
extending throughout the visible region of the
spectrum. The low pulsed laser threshold, the
long lifetime (10 msec for a 0.05 molar %
Dy2+ in CaF2) and the convenient location of

the broad pumping bands of this system make
it especially suitable for sun-pumped operation.

The photograph shows the experimental
arrangement. A 1-inch long, 1/4-inch-by-IA;-inch
cross-section CaF2: 0.05 M % Dy2+ laser
crystal is placed in a dewar ﬁlled with liquid
neon just outside the focal point of a 14-inch
spherical mirror. The dewar was wrapped with
aluminum foil except for the area of illumi-
nation to insure better optical coupling.

From the known values of the pulsed laser
threshold at 27° Kand at 78° K, we estimate
that a 20-inch—diameter condensing mirror will
be suﬂicient to operate the laser at liquid
nitrogen temperature. Experiments using much
larger mirrors are in progress to evaluate the
high power output capabilities of the sun-
pumped laser.

Beam Plasma

An experimental RCA tube which may open
new communication and radar channels near
the frequencies of infrared light is shown being
prepared for test at RCA Laboratories. The
device uses the interaction of an electron beam
with a cesium plasma to amplify 23 Ge micro-
wave power.

The device consists, basically, of an electron
gun, input and output helixes and a cesium
plasma. The gun sends an electron beam
through the input helix where the input signal
impresses a space-charge wave on the beam.
The beam then traverses a three centimeter
length of plasma. The plasma is generated by
a cesium Penning-type arc. The resonant fre-
quency of the plasma electrons, which is pro-
portional to the square root of the plasma
density, is set equal to the signal frequency.
Interaction occurs between the space-charge
wave and the plasma oscillations which results
in an ampliﬁcation of the space-charge wave.
In the above tube, power in the space-charge
wave is ampliﬁed ten thousand times. The

 

ampliﬁed signal is delivered to the loadlby the
output helix as the beam passes through the
helix.

How to tell a career from a job

A job is a job. A career is a place to grow. A career has a future.
A job lives from day to day. In a job you get what you can, do
what you must. In a career, rewards parallel your contributions.

We’re a career company. More than a third of our 90,000
employees have been with us at least 15 years; 10,000 for more
than 25 years. There are reasons for this. To assure growth we
invest over $90 million a year in research. Fifty percent of last
year's sales ($2.4 billion) came from products unheard of just
28 years ago. Because customers [k_e these products, we've
grown 750% since 1937.

Our career men share in this growth because we fill virtually
all responsible positions from within. Our young men work in
several areas to develop their capabilities. This way they can
change positions without leaving the company.

There are job men and career men. If you seek a career, we'd

FUEL CELLS

By Herman A. Liebhafsky

Making valence electrons do work before
they’re captured by oxygen is the most direct
way to convert chemical into electrical energy.
But effective cells seem years away.

IN BRIEF: Like the ordinary battery, trolysis. (Figs. 1 and  But under- Anode 2H _ 4H+ +4e__

the fuel cell is a low—voltage source Cathode O2 +4H+ +49: ___ 21.120

Of dc; u7Il'i/C6 the battery. the fuel until the end of the last century when 0Ver_a11

cell does not store energy but merely
converts it. Ideally, it has most of
the advantages of the battery ——
compactness, no moving parts, sound-
lessness: has a disadvantage in its
need for accessory fuel supply and
omide removal apparatus; and has a
number of unique virtues — steady
output without recharging, long life,
and operation on air and convention-
al fuels. It can use these latter more
efficiently than conventional genera-
tors because, unlike them, it con-
verts the energy of fuel orcidation
directly into electricity.
The theory is simple:
electrons of a conventional fuel are
forced to do work enroute to the
oxidation product. But practice is
bedeviled by technical demands that
are difficult to meet one at a time,
let alone all at once. Still, after a
century of failure to develop a prac-
tical fuel cell, recent work has led to
a handful of devices that work well
enough to merit attention.—T.M.
Since the Second World War, and
largely because of military and space
needs for new energy sources, there
has been a tremendous expansion of
fuel-cell research here and abroad.
More is probably being done now
than in all the fuel cell’s long history.
A century before the Second
World War, Sir William Grove, an
Englishman distinguished in electro-
chemistry and the law, used a battery
of hydrogen fuel cells as an energy
source to decompose water by elec-

valence

Wilhelm Ostwald, the distinguished
German physical chemist, and others
came to appreciate through thermo-
dynamic analysis of the fuel cell that
it is potentially the most efficient
simple way of converting chemical
into electrical energy.

When fuels react directly with
oxygen, as in ordinary combustion,
the chemical energy of the reaction
is liberated as heat. But fuels can
be oxidized because their valence
electrons tend to transfer to the states
of lower energy they occupy in the
oxidation products. If these valence
electrons can be made to do useful
work before they come to rest in
the oxidation products — if they are
caught in ﬂight, so to speak — chemi-
cal energy can be converted directly
into electrical energy, and the inter-
mediate conversion to heat disap-
pears.

How if works

A fuel cell, like any other electro-
chemical cell, contains two electrodes
(the anode and the cathode). These
are joined externally by a metallic
circuit through which the valence
electrons from the fuel flow, and
internally by a conducting medium
(the electrolyte) through which ions
flow to complete the circuit.

In the hydrogen fuel cell of Fig. 3,
these component parts are labeled,
and the substances involved in the
reaction at each electrode are in-
These are the

d icated. electrode

reactions:

02 + 2111, = 2H._.o

Note that the over-all reaction, which
is the equation for combustion of
hydrogen, has in it no charged species.
But the electrode reactions involve
two charged species, the hydrogen
ion H+ (here written without its
water of hydration) and the electron
e—. The electron works for us in
passing from anode to cathode in
the external circuit of Fig. 3, and the
hydrogen ion completes the circuit by
passing from anode to cathode
through the electrolyte.

The electrons tend to be driven
through the external circuit by a
thermodynamic driving force called
the Gibbs free energy of the overall
reaction. Thus the fuel cell accom-
plishes the direct conversion of chemi-
cal energy involved in the electro-
chemical oxidation of a fuel.

Such direct conversion is one of the
principal assignments of electro-
chemistry. It has been carried out
successfully for years in electrochemi-
cal cells that consume substances
other than conventional fuels and
oxygen. In the current wave of en-
thusiasm for the fuel cell, there has
been some tendency to call almost
any electrochemical device by that
name. Therefore, it is well to define
the fuel cell: “A fuel cell is an electro-
chemical device in which energy
of reaction between a conventional
fuel and owygen is converted directly
and usefully into low—voltage direct-
eurrent electrical energy.”
