WINGS

Passengers crossing the Strait of Messina between Italy
and Sicily have always had to endure a rough hour long
voyage. Today they cross in approximately ten minutes,
in unbelievable smoothness. What caused this big change?
An Italian hydrofoil, the Freccia del Sole. The concept
of the hydrofoil has been on the minds of men for more
than 50 years and sporadic attempts were made prior to
World War II to develop hydrofoil craft. The Germans
tried in the early 1940's, but their work ended when an
80-ton vessel ﬂoundered in heavy seas. Canadian marine
engineers showed an early interest in hydrofoils, and since
World War II the Soviet Union has made progress in the

 

Robert Stiger, a senior in the Aeronautical option of
Mechanical Engineering, became interested in hydrofoils
because of their similarity to air foils. Besides being a
member of P.S.P.E., N.S.P.E., and I.A.S., Bob is the Dis-
play Chairman of the A.E. project for Engineers’ Week.

development of the fast moving craft. At present the
Russians have a large craft carrying 100 passengers be-
tween ports on the Volga. By 1960 eight coastal lines were
using hydrofoils in Italy. In the same year two lines were
established in Sweden and two in Norway.

What is a hydrofoil? The term hydrofoil is commonly
used to described a craft whose hull is supported by lift
which is created by underwater wings, or hydrofoils. For
a certain speed-length ratio, a hydrofoil offers a substan-
tial reduction in drag or resistance to forward motion.
A greater speed, therefore, can be attained than possible
with conventional craft of equal power.

Most hydrofoils ride four or ﬁve feet above the waves,
and are therefore unaffected by waves in relatively smooth
or slightly choppy seas. If the waves get larger, say ten
feet high, the hydrofoil will contour them, much like an
automobile riding up and down small hills. If the waves
reach hurricane-size, 35 to 45 feet, the hydrofoil will sit
on its hull and ride out the storm much like a conven-
tional ship. Actually the hydrofoil will be much better
off than the conventional craft because of its foils, since
they tend to dampen out the rock and roll of the heavy
seas. In fact the hydrofoil is expected to be about 80 per-
cent more stable than the conventional craft.

Due to the increased speed of the hydrofoil, it will
probably be able to carry passengers and cargo cheaper
than railroads or trucks along the seaboard. It also shows
much promise as a transporter of frui.ts and vegetables,
its speed in transit making refrigeration unnecessary.

The United States Navy believes the hydrofoil craft is
a solution to its most worrisome problem; How to combat
the atomic powered submarine. These subs can out-run
and out-maneuver any present anti-submarine surface ves-
sel. Faster destroyers or P.T. boats could not solve the
problem because in rough water at high speeds these
boats would be battered to pieces. The hydrofoil can

travel at top speed in any but the roughest seas, and as
for maneuverability, the hydrofoils can almost pivot in
their own length. They resist skidding like ordinary speed
boats because their foils check sideslip.

There were and still are many problems connected with
the development of hydrofoils. Some of these problems
are discussed in the following paragraphs.

One of the major problems which restricted the speed
to below approximately 40 mph was a phenomenon
called cavitation. Cavitation is a condition which occurs
when foils move through water at high speeds. In order
to obtain lift from any foil, airfoil or hydrofoil, there must
be a pressure difference with a low pressure over the up-
per surface of the foil and a high pressure on the lower
surface. This pressure difference caused a force, or lift.
As the speed increases over a hydrofoil a vapor pocket
forms on the low pressure surfaces of the propeller and
struts, causing a loss of thrust and a loss in the lifting
capacity of the foils. This problem was solved by navy
researcher Marshall P. Tulin. Tulin’s solution was a
change in blade and prop design called supercavitation.
The principle of supercavitation maintains lift without
sacriﬁcing speed, and supercavitation applied to a pro-
peller increases the speed at which the ship can be driven.

GRUMMAN'S SEA WINGS, a test boat for the Office of Naval Re-
search is 23-feet long, and can do 70 miles per hour.

MARCH 1962

 

THE H. S. DENISON uses the surface piercing foils.

There was also much question as to what would happen
if a hydrofoil would strike an object in the water. When
tests were run with small testing craft it was found that
with small debris the foils either chewed up the debris or
tossed it aside. Upon striking a large piece of debris the
foil is designed to break off at a shear point built into the
hydrofoil without damaging the hull of the craft. The
craft would then land in the water much like a sea plane.

At present hydrofoils are restricted to fairly low tonnage
ships between 1500 and 3500 tons. The maximum size
cannot be increased until new power plants with greatly
reduced speciﬁc weights are developed. Doorways were
opened to hydrofoils with the development of lighter
turbines, but if the size restrictions on hydrofoils are to
be removed power plants with a much greater power to
weight ratio must be developed. The size of hydrofoils
are also limited by the amount of torque that can be
handled by right angled V—type transmissions. In addition,
as the size of the craft increases the size and/or number
of foils increases out of proportion. Small craft are able
to retract their foils when docking, but with a very large
craft this would not be feasible. Thus special docking
facilities would become necessary.

The United States’ interest in hydrofoils came alive in

‘—-' '3 _.

BOElNG'S SUB CHASER AND PATROL BOAT uses completely sub-
merged foils anchored to right angle struts.

13

1948 when the Chief of Naval Operations ordered a thor-
ough investigation of the hydrofoil principle. This order
resulted in the 26 foot “High Pockets” powered by a 125-
HP reciprocating engine. The speed restriction of 40 mph
caused by cavitation, as stated previously, was solved by
M. Tulin with his principle of supercavitation.

In the United States at present there is work being done
on two large hydrofoils. One is Boeing’s high speed anti-
submarine patrol craft and the other is the passenger boat
H. S. Denison being built by Grumman. The big differ-
ence in these two craft is the types of hydrofoils being
used.

Boeing is using ﬂat, fully submerged foils, similar to
an aircraft wing. They are joined to the hull by a right-
angled strut. This craft uses an air-craft like autopilot for
stabilization. The autopilot will also measure the distance
of the craft from the sea, and automatically adjust the
flaps on the foils to get just enough lift to pass over the
waves. The autopilot will also have the job of keeping
the craft in proper trim.

Most hydrofoils today have a surface-piercing foil sys-
tem, as in construction at Grumman. Such foils have the
advantage of being intrinsically self-stabilizing but they
are unable to maintain speed on rough water. When a
wave hits, some dry foil goes under water, giving the foil
more lift to climb over the wave. When the vessel rolls,
one of the foils moves deeper into the water, and the lift
again increases to compensate for the roll. The response
is neat but makes a rough ride in heavy seas.

Admitting the present limitations as to size on hydro-

foils there remains many possible applications for small
high speed craft. These included comfortable point—to—
point passenger service, pleasure boats, air—sea rescue boats,
landing craft and other military application for small
stable craft that can travel at high speeds in comparatively
rough seas, and still maintain high maneuverability.

WHAT?
MECHANICAL ENGINEERS
IN A
CHEMICAL COMPANY?

True, we d_o employ a number of chemists and
chemical engineers at Du Pont. But our need for
mechanical engineers is just as urgent. In fact, the
ratio of MES to CHEs at Du Pont is 10:17.

Why? Well, we need mechanical engineers to
build new plants, equip and operate them. We need
them, too, to design and build equipment and to
develop new processes.

Just as important, we need mechanical engi-
neers to help us improve our present manufactur-
ing processes, which are constantly under study.
How can we operate more efficiently, more
economically? How can we better our products?
Mechanical engineers play an important role in
supplying the answers.

In a company the size of Du Pont—with annual
sales of $2,000,000,000, investment in plant and
equipment of another $2,000,000,000 and research
expenditures of $90,000,000 a year—there’s a
wealth of opportunity for the mechanical engineer.
Just as there is for engineers of almost every
specialty—and for chemists, physicists and math-
ematicians, too.

This amazing structure symbolizes the outer space theme for this year's Century 21 International Exposition in
Seattle, Washington. Called the Space Needle, it soars 600 feet into the air on three steel legs, tapers to a slim
waist atthe 373-ft. mark,then ﬂares out slightly to the 500-ft. level, and is crowned by a mezzanine,observation deck,
and a 260-seat restaurant that revolves slowly (one complete revolution an hour) while patrons enjoy their meals.

The Space Needle is a combination of sheer audacity and imagination with 3,500 tons of steel. Steel was
chosen because it would be faster to erect, stronger per unit area, quickly available. A relatively new type of
structural carbon steel called A36 was used because its greater strength (about 10%) permits higher design
stresses, at the same time maintaining factors of safety, and because it could be easily welded. This is an example
of the exciting materials and challenging projects engineers will ﬁnd at United States Steel.

A W orcl From the Dean

By

DR. G. R. FITTERER

Although it may appear to the casual observer that the
Engineers’ V/Veek-Saint Patrick tradition is frivolous, it,
nevertheless, has a very serious objective.

Coincident with a number of scheduled student events
in which the Saint Patrick tradition predominates is the
serious attempt on the part of engineering students to
communicate the scope of engineering as a career to high
school students.

Russia, which has decided that science is wonderful but
useless unless applied, has already surpassed us in the
number of engineering graduates per year. Meanwhile, in
the face of this competition, engineering enrollment in
this country has been decreasing. In addition, enrollment
has been increasing in the natural or “pure” sciences,
partly because of the mistaken idea that many of the ad-
vances in such areas as space travel, are scientiﬁc, rather
than engineering developments.

The tragedy of this increased enrollment in th“

«

 
  

  

is that science is chieﬂy interested in the very  . , .

MARCH 1962

who will be “syphoned” off and urged to continue towards
a doctorate degree. A B.S. in science is regarded merely
as a pre-science degree, whereas a B.S. degree in engineer-
ing prepares a student for a useful life-time career.

This spring, some 400 companies will come to this
campus to recruit about 200 graduating engineers. Each
student will receive at least several offers, at salaries well
above those of any other professional group on the
campus.

A recent study by the National Science Foundation in-
dicated that their previous estimate in l959, of the 782,800
engineers needed by the United States by 1970, was in
error. Instead, they now indieate that 1,484,000 engineer-
ing graduates with B.S. degrees will be needed by that
time. Students now in high school will be among the 1970
graduating class in engineering.

Thus, it is obvious that the Engineers’ Week—Saint
Patrick tradition has a very serious motive which involves
the future of this Nation.

The Schools of Engineering and Mines at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh greet the high school students and wish
t expre their appreciation to high school principals and

THE ENGINEERS’
WEEK STORY

St. Patrick was an engineer. This fact has been pro-
claimed by engineering schools for the past ﬁfty years,
and has just been historically proven. An ancient docu-
ment dating back to the time of St. Patrick was recently
discovered in Ireland, and it contained the words which
every engineer knew it would: Erin Go Braugh. This,
loosely translated, means “St. Patrick was an engineer.”

“Of course,” engineers explain, “it's a rather loose
translation.” But engineers further explain that there
is a deﬁnite basis for their claim. “Didn’t St. Pat drive
the snakes out of Ireland, and wasn’t that the ﬁrst worm
drivel Therefore, St. Patrick was an engineer.”

Actual celebration began 59 years ago by engineers at

 
 

ST. PATRICK was an engineer.

the University of Missouri. At that time there was little
proof that the Irish ever had any connection with the pro-
fession. But needing a vacation, a group of students from
that campus claimed that they had received knowledge
of the saint’s ﬁeld of endeavor in what they called a
“revelation,” and celebrated his birthday by cutting all
their classes and engaging in various forms of merriment.

As a result of the disciplinary action which followed
shortly thereafter, several of the more active celebrants
were absent from their classes for a much longer period.
Two years later, however, the celebration of St. Pat-
rick's Day by the engineering students was ofﬁcially recog-
nized by the university administration.

Iowa State College and the University of Arkansas fol-
lowed Missouri’s lead by establishing a special day of
festivities in 1909. It was not long before most of the
engineering schools west of the Mississippi took the cry,
and now the “Engineers’ Day” or “Week” is a very cele-
brated occasion around these parts. The east-of-the-Missis-
sippian schools have been somewhat behind their “young-
er” brothers to ‘the west but they are now carrying
on the tradition. There is a trend to hold this festive
occasion on Washington's birthday in February, he being
the ﬁrst American engineer, but the St. Pat tradition still
prevails.

Most of those “western” engineering schools have a week
of celebration ﬁlled with such events as ﬂoat parades,
special Church services, lab exhibits and open houses,
barbecues and panties, professional society meetings,
beard growing contests, tea parties, senior banquets,
campus stunts, Engineers Carnivals, and last but not
least, pre-election political rallies put on by the candidates
for St. Patricia, usually in the form of a “cheesecake”
show. St. Patricia is then crowned at the Engineers’ Ball.

The big occasion for most of these schools (besides the
climax'g d ce) is the rival of St. Patrick dressed in

THE ARRIVAL OF ST. PAT is always a closely guarded secret, and
the mode of transportation is usually a novel arrangement.

Each year he arrives by a different mode of transporta-
tion, using anything from an airplane to a steam shovel.
His favorite “carriage” is the railroad hand car. It is said
that back in 1914, the actual body of St. Patrick was resur-
rected from his grave in Ireland and brought to the Iowa
State Celebration. After being carried around in a parade,
St. Patrick was called upon to make a speech to the stu-
dents. Since being interred for quite a few years and not
upon the latest talk, he was only able to say a few words,
“I'm glad to be here.”

On these occasions, St. Patrick is assisted by the Guard
of St. Patrick, a group of outstanding engineering students
who are tapped to this honorary society. Pledges to the
group are called “Squires,” and members of it are known
as “Knights.”

The Squires are initiated to the Guard of St. Patrick on
the evening of the Engineers’ Ball by being “knighted”
with a two foot slide rule by St. Patrick and they show
their faith by kissing the “Blarney Stone.”

Since, the Squires are required to kiss the Blarney Stone
before they become Knights, the stone has caused no little
excitement in some of the universities. It seems that some
of the boys from foreign schools (any school other than
Engineering or Mines) have made strong attempts to

MARCH 1962

steal it from the Engineers. But under the protection of
the Squires, it has been kept out of mischievous hands.

A ﬁne thing about these weeks is the fact that all the
students take part in the week, and at .least 50 percent of
them are in on the planning of it or at work on the de-
partmental displays. That is what makes it what it is——
an Engineers’ Week.

At Pitt, Engineers’ V/Veek was ﬁrst observed in 1954.
Since then the annual celebration has become increasingly
larger in scope, until it is now one of the major events
on the University of Pittsburgh campus.

St. Patrick’s arrival is still one of the highlights of the
Week, and the mode of transportation is a closely guarded
secret until the time of arrival.

 

COMPETITION AMONG THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS runs high
during Engineers’ Week.

Competition runs high during the week among the nine
engineering departments. By means of a point system,
each department accumulates a certain number of points
for the entire week which positions it a certain number
of standard deviations on one side or the other of the
mean department. The winning department is then chos-
en. The points are awarded for participation in Engineers’
Week activities. These activities include presentation of
technical displays, participation in the debate, and gim-
mick and attendance at various activities throughout the

THE ARRIVAL OF ST. PATRICK

Shortly before the coming of Spring
every year, Pitt engineers celebrate 4
the arrival of Saint Patrick, patron of
the engineers. This wi1.1 be his eighth '
visit to the University of Pittsburgh’s .5

Stone

To the unsophisticated, the conglomeration of hiero-
glyphics appearing in the accompanying cut means noth-
ing. But to those who have dived deep into hidden things,
it means much. It is a facsimile of an interpretation found
upon a slab of green marble dug up some three years ago
while excavating for the foundations of the Engineering
laboratory. The characters, more complicated by far than
any ever carved into sphinxes and mummies of ancient
Egypt, have long been a stumbling block to guns and sons
of guns of translators, and even now their meaning is
obscure to all except the Faithful. Ever since the stone was
unearthed, scores of engineers have burned the midnight
kilowatt and Bull Durham trying to Sherlock the riddle.
They applied it to every known law of mathematics.from
the three fundamental operations to the Theory of Func-
tions and the How of liquids down smooth pipes. The last
mentioned law was passed by the city council with the
malicious intent of driving the “friend of the students”
out of business. The Faithful found that this law is very
detrimental to the solving of problems, and, in fact, to
all student activity.

Ever and anon while this great struggle was going on,
in spite of the above difﬁculty, those interested in fossile
and things primeval have gone to lectures, dissertations,
and e.laborations on “Excavations in the Far East,” “The
Remains of Babylon,” or the “Origin of the Brick Bat”
(said lectures being inﬁnitely deader than the fossils),
little dreaming that in their very midst was an excavated
puzzle that could give ‘Recent Discoveries in Crete’ cards
and spades, and beat them balling-up translators. V/Vhile
these poor misguided seekers after truth were trying
mightily to decipher the trade marks on a few old crocks
and broken teacups dug up in the Garden of Eden or
some modern backyard, the Faithful were slowly but sure-
ly unlocking the secret of the great green slab. Only a few
days since was the .last kink straightened and the last knot
untied. By an ingenious operation, in which he combined
the orthographic projection of three leaves of a shamrock
and the chemical afﬁnities of cork into an inﬁnite series

THE BLARNEY STONE was writ-
ten in 1905 by Homer H. Haggard,
then a senior C. E. at the University of
Missouri. Appearing in a special issue
of the MISSOURI SHAMROCK in
1949, THE BLARNEY STONE was
reprinted, with the permission of the
SHAMROCK, in the March 1954 and
March 1955 issue of the SKYSCRAP-
ER ENGINEER. Although some of
the names and places will be unfa-
miliar to the reader, he may use his
imagination, and substitute more fa-
miliar data in place of them.

converging four degrees and twenty minutes northwest of
Dublin, Wray Dudley discovered that the snake and hod,
being interpreted, mean “Saint Patrick.” This was the
opening wedge. Sunny Jim Barnes immediately applied
the theory of least squares to Dudley's series, and inte-
grated from Ireland to the bench mark on the Engineer-
ing building, and adding a twist of long green for a
constant, found the word “Engineer.” The rest was easy.
Using the key so long sought, the Faithful of Saint Pat-
rick’s department quickly ﬁnished the work. Interpreted,
the Sacred Tablet read as follows:

“Lo, I am Saint Patrick and an engineer. The spirit
now moveth me to speak, and I will write my sayings
upon this stone. Yea, verily, upon this stone will I write
them, and then will I bury it even where I now stand,
and many generations hence shall it be resurrected to
guide and direct the Faithful that cometh after me. For
in the latter days my followers shall be many and shall

wax great, and Legion shall be their name. A great na-
tion shall they be, and I will deliver their enemies into
their hands. Every beast of the ﬁeld and every creeping
thing shall they subdue. Their stubborn mule shall they
ride with bridle and saddle and lead with halters. Even
upon his back shall they beat him with a shelallah that
I give unto them, until he becometh as a lamb. Yea,
verily, I say unto you they shall tame the wild asses.

“Upon the spot where I now stand, even though the
‘Professor of Physics’ hath never yet run his wheelbarrow
over it, I see in the dim distance future a multitude of
the Faithful. Mightily do they yell for me, and the day
is set apart for me, even me, the first engineer. From all
sides they gather and ‘VVearin’ o’ the Green’ and ‘Turkey
in the Straw’ ﬂoat sweetly up the river of time to my
grateful ears. But who is that approaching with such gas-
engine snorts and cornﬁeld strides? Why looketh he so
wild and why paweth he the air so frantically with his
hand and a half? What do I hear him say? ‘Upon whose
authority do you blow a band upon the campus today?’
(He talks as though some one were smoking and blowing
rings.) I seem to hear him further say: ‘Rowdies, go to town,
gentlemen, go to classes; murder college spirit.’ Alas, that
my day should be profaned by such a poor misguided crea-
ture such as he. Why should he want the Faithful to mur-
der College spirit by going to classes?

“Methinks I see some other things that make the angels
weep. I see members of the Faithful canned for lifting up
their voices and blowing a band. By the former snakes of
Ireland, it maketh me wild. But in the sweet bye and bye
shall they get their reward, for verily I say unto you, many
cold bottles are laid up for those who suffer for my sake.
Much shall they eat and drink where faculties cometh not,
neither do city ordinances butt in and say a student may
not buy, for in the happy land prepared by me, great
cataracts of Bud do ﬂow without money and without
price, and whosoever getteth in may dip it up in a can.
Yea, verily, with their cans shall my Faithful dip and
drink, while discipline committees gasp across the great

MARCH 1962

gulf for just a little foam to cool their blistered gaspers.
But the Faithful shall say unto them ‘Nay, nay, Pauline 8c
Co.; depart from me: go chase yourself: I know you not.
You may smoke but not drink for the deeds done in the
body.’ '

“A year has passed and my followers are still strong in
the faith, though diverse members of the faculty tell them
I am mythical as Santa Claus, and differ from him only in
that I bringeth ﬂunks, kerﬂops, much cussing, and gnash-
ing of teeth instead of peanuts. And here I must pause
to weep for those who went astray. For verily some of my
followers, even the tribe of mechanics, though they were
slaves to the Greene, did murder college spirit by going to
classes. Yea, verily, their hearts became as those of chick-
ens. .

“Although ingratitude tireth me like Doctor Brown’s
lectures and giveth me a pain like freshman English, yet
will I forgive them for their loyalty when I again appear
in the world. For, verily, I say unto you, at the third great
jamboree of the Faithful will I be among them in the flesh.
Yea, even I, the ﬁrst engineer, shall walk the earth once
more and carry my good instrument that made the proﬁle
of the Emerald Isle. Down Ninth Street shall I run my
line and show the editor of the catalogue how to build a
walk thereupon, for the lack of which I see the Faithful
are sorely vexed. I shall also demonstrate that matter is
indestructible, and that there is, therefore, a better way

of getting rid of undesirable dirt than by trying to wear
it out by moving it from place to place and back again.
I must run the snakes out of the buck-bushes, around the
campus, and last, but not least, I must bless the Faithful.
Yea, verily, shall I stand upon the steps of my temple, and
they will bow before me. And then shall I stretch forth
my hands and bless them muchly and vanish from their
sight. But each year I shall return again upon the day
set apart for me and admonish each of the Faithful to
remember that day and keep it holy if he would dip his
can in the river of Bud and drink with me under the
Bushes. I have spoken.”

The dream lasts . . .With stainless steel

Now the new look of any dream house can be protected . . . if
stainless steel is used in the right places. Gutters, downspouts and ﬂashing will
never cause ugly corrosion stains. Doors and windows won’t dent, warp, stick
or rust. And the strength of stainless steel makes possible screening so ﬁne
you hardly know it’s there.

Many other things stand up against the weather too ——such as lawn
furniture, barbecues and garden tools. And inside the house, stainless steel
brings the same carefree beauty to kitchens.

The lifetime quality of stainless steel comes from chromium—one
of many essential alloying metals developed by Union Carbide. In the basic
ﬁelds of metals, as well as carbons, chemicals, gases, plastics and nuclear
energy, research by the people of Union Carbide will continue to help bring
forth more useful products for today’s living.

Harley A. Cloud (B.S.E.E., Penn State '58) is a group leader
in the development of simulation testing equipment for a‘
new airborne computer which IBM is building for the Air
Force.

TRIPS THROUGH THE STRATGSPHERE
WlTH0l|T LEAVING THE GROUND

A computer will be the heart of the navigation and control
systems for future aircraft designed to operate in the
stratosphere.

Such a computer is now being built by IBM for an advanced
aircraft under development for the Air Force. Harley Cloud,
an IBM engineer, is developing simulation equipment which
will put the computer through its paces. His equipment
will simulate the systems functions encountered by the
250-ton aircraft at Mach 3, fourteen miles up, with poten-
tial adversaries in wait.

Without the airplane leaving the ground, his testing equip-
ment will simulate such inputs to the computer as accelera-
tion in the inertial system, velocity in the doppler radar, and
air pressure in the air data subsystem. These simulation
techniques will help protect lead time for the entire project.

Responsibilities Are Large. As a group leader, he is direct-
ing the design, laboratory breadboarding, electrical draft-
ing, testing and evaluation of this ingenious equipment.
It's a very responsible job for a man out of school less
than four years.

But age is no barrier to advancement in IBM. In the fast-
moving world of data systems, it is ideas and the ability
to do the job that count. And fresh new ideas and abilities
are always welcomed at IBM—whether in development, re-
search, manufacturing, or programming.

If you feel you might be interested in one of these fields
associated with data systems at IBM, you might discuss
it with the IBM representative. Your placement office can
make an appointment. All qualified applicants will be con-
sidered for employment without regard to race, creed, color
or national origin. Or you may write, outlining your back-
ground and interests, to:

HOT WIRE

By JOHN T. ZAGRODNICK

The_ advent of the “electrical age” has been a prime
factor for the steady increase in the use of electricity in
the last twenty years. In the future, the use of electricity is
expected to increase at a more rapid rate than it has in
the past. The expected increase will place extremely heavy
demands on existing generating and supply equipment.
Recognizing that their present equipment will not be
capable of meeting future needs, some electric companies
are presently exploring methods that may be employed
in the future to economically supply electric energy.

One of the ﬁrms doing much investigation in future
methods of transmitting electric power is the Pennsyl-
vania Electric Company (Penelec) with system headquar-
ters in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Penelec embarked on a
project that was unprecedented in the electrical power
ﬁeld. They decided to investigate the feasibility of trans-
mitting electric power at extra high voltages (EHV) by
constructing a thirteen mile, 460,000 volt (460 KV), three-
phase transmission line and to test it under actual load
conditions.

The project was initiated in early 1959. The construc-

john T. Zagrodnick, an E.E. Sr., became interested in
high voltage transmission lines while he worked for the
Pennsylvania Electric Company during the summer of
1961 as a student engineer. John is a member of the
A.I.E.E., I.R.E., P.S.P.E., N.S.P.E., and is Vice-President
of the Amateur Radio Association.

32

tion and testing of the 460 KV line will require four to
ﬁve years for completion. After completion of the testing,
the line may be put into actual service or disassembled
and its components given thorough tests.

The 460 KV line is unique in that it is the country’s
ﬁrst and possibly the world’s ﬁrst transmission line that
would be capable of being utilized under actual load con-
ditions at 460 KV. There have been other EHV projects
at 460 KV and higher, but these have been merely “out-
door labs” consisting of short, open ended, single phase
lines. Penelec’s aim in the project is to determine if power
transmission at 460 KV is economical and practical as
compared to present day power transmission at 230 KV,
115 KV and at lower voltages. Since the line is the ﬁrst
EHV transmission line ever constructed for 460 KV,
Penelec’s engineers were required to design or aid in the
design of most of the components involved. The engineers
had few criteria available for design purposes. In fact,
the best references proved to be Penelec’s own design ex-
perience with their 230 KV and H5 KV lines (also the ﬁrst
in the nation).

The 450 KV project was the result of the cooperative
efforts of fourteen ﬁrms who contributed material, equip-
ment, and engineering assistance. Without the coopera-
tion of the fourteen ﬁrms, the project would never have
been a reality. Under Penelec’s supervision, actual con-
struction was completed in nine months.

To determine the most economical and reliable com-
ponents for EHV transmission, many different types of
towers and structures, conductors, and insulators were
used in constructing the line. ‘

Penelec engineers will make extensive studies on the
line to determine its economical and practical shortcom-
ings. The engineers will make many tests on the different
types of conductors, power transformers, towers and struc-
tures, and insulators used on the line. Also to be investi-
gated are the effects of wind caused vibrations on the sup-
porting structures and conductors, different weather con-
ditions, .lightning strokes, the inductive coupling effect of
the line on existing power and communications circuits
in the area, and the effect of radio inﬂuence voltages (RI).

The initial step in the project was the determination
of a suitable site for the line. Penelec engineers decided
that the selected site should be representative of Penelec’s

territory, terrain wise, and should present the extreme
in weather conditions. After making extensive aerial and
land surveys of their territory, which includes approxi-
mately forty percent of Pennsylvania, Penelec officials de-
cided that the line should be located in south-central
Pennsylvania, about forty miles from Johnstown, begin-
ning at the Claysburg Substation and terminating at the
Saxton Substation, a distance of approximately thirteen
miles. The selected route paralleled an existing 115 KV
line. Thus, the 460 KV line could be easily inserted into
Penelec’s network by making the proper connections to
the 115 KV line.

The terrain between Claysburg and Saxton is most
representative of Penelec’s territory. The line crossed two
mountain ridges and extended across a valley between the
mountains. The line starts at Claysburg, with an elevation
of 1150 feet above sea level and crosses Dunning Mountain
at an elevation of 2100 feet. For a distance of about seven
miles, the line crosses a valley having an average elevation
of about 1400 feet. After crossing the valley, the line goes
to the top of Tussey Mountain, an elevation of 2200 feet,
and terminates at the Saxton substation, an elevation of
800 feet.

The weather conditions between Claysburg and Saxton
are actually more extreme than those experienced on
Penelec’s other territories. The region has a high isoker-
aunic level providing an ample opportunity for extensive
lightning studies. Also, since the area has an unusually
large amount of snow, sleet, hail, and fog, the effect of
these elements on the line can be studied extensively.

Now that the line has been described in general, an ex-
amination of some of the details of its components is
possible.

Located at the Claysburg terminal is one of the largest
power transformers ever built. The transformer is a 60
MVA, three—phase, 115/4-60 KV autotransformer. The di-
mensions of the transformer are: height, 3l’ll”; width,
32’1l”; and depth, 24’1”. The transformer uses over 25,000
gallons of oil for cooling purposes——the capacity of three
standard railroad tank cars. The total weight of the trans-
former, excluding the oil is approximately 200 tons. The

MARCH 1962

bushing used on the transformer is over 24 feet long, is
rated at 1200 amps, and weighs over four tons. The ver-
tical disconnect switches, switches that isolate the 460 KV
line from Penelec’s network, are rated at 1600 amps steady-
state and 70,000 amps instantaneous. Each disconnect
switch weighs 81/2 tons.

The transformer at the Saxton end of the line was in-
tended to be the same type as the one at Claysburg, but,
due to the lack of suitable transportation facilities to the
Saxton site, three single phase transformers had to be em-
ployed. Each transformer is rated at 115/460 KV and 26
MVA. The oil capacity of each transformer is 8,840 gal-
lons. The total weight of the transformers, excluding oil,
is 2841/2 tons. Other than the difference in terminating
transformers, the circuits at both terminals of the line are
identical.

The insulating system on the 460 KV line is one of the
most elaborate used on any commercial line in the world.
It consists of over 19,000 individual insulators, and 147
insulator assemblies. The insulators are the ﬁrst ever used
in this country on EHV lines carrying commercial loads.
The insulating value of the insulators is 1835 KV. Be-
cause of the high voltages at which the insulators are
used, special corona shielding must be employed on all
insulators. The largest insulator used on the line, aside
from the transformer bushings, is 15 feet long.

One of the world’s largest highest rated lightning ar-
resters is employed on the line. It is rated at 378 KV and
is over 25 feet high.

THIS POWER TRANSFORMER, one of the largest ever built, steps
up the input voltage from H5 KV to 460 KV. The transformer is
located at the Claysburg Substation, the beginning of the 460 KV
line.

conductor, four different types of conductors were used.
The line was divided into four sections and each section
employed a different type conductor. The types of con-
ductors used in each section were: Section A——/1114 miles
of twin bundled expanded ACSR conductors 1.4” in di-
ameter; Section B——3.l7 miles of twin bundled expanded
ACSR conductors 1.6” in diameter; Section C—3.8 miles
of twi nbundled expanded ACSR conductors 1.4” in di-
ameter; Section D—l.9 miles of single expanded ACSR
conductors 2.32” in diameter. The above mentioned con-
ductors, some as thick as a man's wrist, will be tested for
the effects of RI, lightning, corona losses, line losses,
weather, and vibration. All the conductors are larger in
diameter than those used on Penelec’s 230 KV line.

The average distance between towers is 725’. The
weight of the 2.32” diameter conductor between towers
is approximately 2250 pounds. The line constructor was
forced to design new stringing equipment for the 2.32”
diameter conductor because of its tremendous weight. To
prevent the conductor from being scratched or damaged
by touching the ground during stringing operations, it
was constantly kept under a tension of 10,000 pounds.
Splicing was accomplished by compressing a 51" alumi-
num sleeve on the wire under 200 tons pressure. The 2.32”
diameter conductor was installed on a one-conductor per
phase basis.

The 1.75”, 1.6”, and 1.4” diameter conductors were
strung in two—conductor bundles i.e. two conductors con-
nected in parallel. The two conductors are held apart by
16" spacers.

In all, there are ninety-three structures and towers on
the 460 KV line. The ninety-three supporting units are
of fourteen different designs and are constructed of four
different materials. The structures are constructed of
laminated wood and timber. The towers are constructed‘

34

 

of tubular steel and structural steel. Each tower and struc-
ture was designed for a speciﬁc geographic location. All
units were designed for 1.75” expanded ACSR two—con-
ductor bundles. The height of the structures and towers
ranged from 60 feet to 127 feet and from 86 feet to 130
feet respectively.

The structures and towers are classiﬁed as follows: four
pole tangent, wood po.le dead end, wood pole angle, and
H—frame (two types), and suspension, dead end angle,
guyed H—frame, heavy duty guyed H—frame, portal, angle,
conventional steel (two types), and running angle re-
spectively.

To illustrate the tremendous size of a typical tower,
consider the largest structure in the 460 KV substation—
the dead end line termination tower. The tower is 88

Throughout the test period, the structures and towers
will be evaluated with maintainence costs, installation
costs, and characteristics at EHV being the signiﬁcant
factors. The right-of-way on which the above mentioned
support units were constructed is 210 feet wide.

of the line to determine their operation at EHV. The tests
are not being conducted for the sake of pure research,
but to conﬁrm the original design of the line, and to pro-
vide references for future lines.

The effects of RI will be thoroughly investigated. The
purpose of RI tests will be to determine which of the
many line conﬁgurations and which of the several types
of conductors will give the most efficient service at 460
KV. Radio inﬂuence varies as the weather conditions vary
and is greatest during rainy weather. Therefore, several
weather stations have been constructed at different points
along the line. At the weather stations, humidity, tempera-
ture, barometric pressure, rain and snow fall, wind direc-
tion and velocity will be constantly measured and re-
corded. The readings obtained at the weather stations are
compared to the RI reading at the particular location of
the weather stations.

To study the vibrations caused by the wind under en-
ergized and de-energized conditions, a special mobile lab-
oratory will be utilized.

The .lightning effects on the line will be determined by
using another specially instrumented mobile laboratory.
This laboratory will record the location, frequency, and
characteristics of the lightning strokes between the two
mountains.

Much depends upon the results of the above mentioned
tests because they will determine the practicality of the
460 KV line for use in the future. Penelec expects the

economical and practical. Penelec also hopes that the
project will provide the electric power field with much
information concerning EHV. Perhaps, as a result of this
experiment, greater amounts of low cost electrical power
will be available to future consumers.

Distinguished from that which has prac-
tical application, pure research is con-
cerned with the discovery of fundamental
knowledge to widen man's understanding
of himself and the universe.

Ford Motor Company's Scientiﬁc Labora-
tory in Dearborn, Michigan is dedicated
to the pursuit of knowledge in the physical
sciences. On its staff are scientists of
national and international reputation who
conduct independent basic research pro-
grams of an extremely broad nature.

Why does Ford Motor Company support
research which seemingly is unrelated to
the manufacture of its products?

It is our view, and a pioneering concept
in our industry, that entirely new ap-
proaches to automotive development can
come only from unhampered scientiﬁc
investigation. Deeper understanding of
matter itself, and of the conversion and
storage of energy—aside from widening
man's primary knowledge—may have
practical application in tomorrow's vehicle
design.

Thus knowledge wrested from nature by
scientists will be taken by technologists
and applied to serve practical needs and
desires. Another example of Ford's leader-
ship through scientific research and
engineering.

Machining Intricate Parts to Minute Tolerances . . . by the
numbers. Problem: How to cut lead time in producing a complicated,
three—dimensional cam for jet aircraft engines by a factor of ten.
Solution: Bendix numerically controlled cam milling machine. Oper-
ated by computer—developed punched tape, it cuts lead time to less
than a week, provides unmatched part-to-part repeatability (with r.m.s.
errors as low as .0001 inch). This Bendix development marks the first
successful production application of tape controls to a machine tool.
Previously, the operator made a digital—to-analog conversion when
translating “blueprint" dimensions into machine motion. This con-
version is done automatically in the Bendix system by employing
linear interpolation techniques to generate the contours. Input data
is reduced so that punched-tape control records are feasible. Storage
and data manipulation is handled by al|—electronic means; an improved
logic structure keeps the volume of circuitry to manageable proportions.
Where earlier models had interposed instrument servo links
between the electronic controls and the machine drive servos to

high precision digital servos with a band width of 100 cps to drive
the machine members directly. The machine structure itself was
designed to stringent requirements to insure adequate response.
Finally, efficient techniques were developed for generating the
required control tapes using specially prepared programs and a
general—purpose digital computer.

It all started like this . . .

For thirty centuries men fought—and many died—for the right to vote
for their leaders and their laws in secrecy, without fear or compulsion,
for this is the very heart of freedom. Long ago men voted by casting a
little ball into an urn, as shown above. (Our word “ballot” comes from
this ancient use of the Italian “ballota”—little ball.) Other. groups “bal-
loted” with shells and bronze disks of different sizes. The ﬁrst written
ballot was used in Rome in 139 B.C., and in America seventeen hundred
and sixty-eight years later.

All of these early methods of voting had one serious weakness in
common: There was no secrecy for the voter. The “Australian Ballot,”
brought to this country in 1888, did provide a degree of secrecy——but
did not eliminate the possibility of errors either in marking ballots, or
in counting them.

Thomas Edison was a pioneer in engineering a better way of voting,
and his work helped later inventors and engineers. In 1896, the United
States Voting Machine Company of Jamestown, New York, marketed
an improved device which soon was used widely throughout New York
State. This was the parent of our Automatic Voting Machine Division.

In the last election, twenty-ﬁve million men and women voted on
Automatic Voting Machines built by our AVM Division. They knew
their votes could not be thrown out because of the technical errors so
prevalent when paper ballots are used. They also knew there was no
way for anyone to tell how they voted, nor could the ﬁnal count be
tampered with.

It was engineers, of course, who developed our modern Automatic
Voting Machine into a device capable of being entrusted with man’s
most precious possession: the right to vote. And engineers will continue
to improve it, just as they play an important part in all of the 19 prod-
uct lines that Rockwell makes for 28 basic industries. Emphasis on
engineering has helped make this a company that people like to work
for, buy from, and invest in.

Deep in lacquer

That our name is never seen on a can
of lacquer doesn’t mean we aren’t in
it pretty deep.

The happy eye

Our newest cellulose ester for the
lacquer formulators has the butyryl-
ated, acetylated cellulose chains run-
ning much shorter than heretofore.
This results in higher solubility, which
means less solvent needed. It also
means poorer ﬁlm strength, but that’s
OK. A butylated urea-formaldehyde
resin, included at the right proportions
in the formulation along with the
proper catalyst, will cross-link to the

I cellulose acetate butyrate during the

drying of the coating. To provide a
point of attachment on the cellulose
chain, we restore one out of 12 of its
hydroxyls. This condenses with the
butoxy groups of the butylated urea-
formaldehyde polymer to split out
butyl alcohol.

Thus the short chains that are more
soluble in the can become very much
less soluble in the ﬁnish of a table on
which some gay dog has set down the
cup that cheers. No longer need a drop
of lotion spilled on the dresser trouble
the conscience of a good woman.

In these days of epoxies, silicones,
methacrylates, polyesters, etc., why do
we monkey with cellulose? What a
silly question I

For one thing, we have shown how
admixture of cellulose acetate butyrate
can improve them all.

For another, cellulose is by far the
world’s most abundant high polymer.
It is formed by sunshine.

Interview with General Electric’s Dr. J. H. Hollomon
    "   Manager—GeneraI Engineering Laboratory

mm M

Q. Dr. Hollomon, what characterizes
the new needs and wants of society?

A. There are four signiﬁcant changes
in recent times that characterize these
needs and wants.

1. The increases in the number of
people who live in cities: the accom-
panying need is for adequate control
of air pollution, elimination of trans-
portation bottlenecks, slum clearance,
and adequate water resources.

2. The shift in our economy from agri-
culture and manufacturing to “serv-
ices”: today less than half our working
population produces the food and goods
for the remainder. Education, health,
and recreation are new needs. They
require a new information technology
to eliminate the drudgery of routine
mental tasks as our electrical tech-
nology eliminated routine physical
drudgery.

3. The continued need for national
defense and for arms reduction: the
majority of our technical resources
is concerned with research and devel-
opment for military purposes. But
increasingly, we must look to new tech-
nical means for detection and control.

4«. The arising expectations of the peo-
ples of the newly developing nations:
here the “haves” of our society must
provide the industry and the tools for the
“have-nots” of the new countries if they
are to share the advantages of mod-
ern technology. It is now clearly recog-
nized by all that Western technology is
capable of furnishing the material
goods of modern life to the billions
of people of the world rather than
only to the millions in the West.

We see in these new wants, prospects
for General Electric’s future growth
and contribution.

Q. Could you give us some examples?

A. We are investigating techniques for
the control and measurement of air and
water pollution which will be appli-
cable not only to cities, but to individual
households. We have developed, for

Society Has New Needs
and Wants—Plan Your
Career Accordingly

DR. HOLLOMON is responsible for General Electric’s centralized, advanced engineering
activities. He is also an adjunct professor of metallurgy at RPI, serves in advisory posts
for four universities, and is a member of the Technical Assistance panel of President
Kennedy's Scientific Advisory Committee. Long interested in emphasizing new areas of oppor-
tunity for engineers and scientists, the following highlights some of Dr. Hollomon’s opinions.

example, new methods of purifying
salt water and speciﬁc techniques for
determining impurities in polluted air.
General Electric is increasing its inter-
national business by furnishing power
generating and transportation equip-
ment for Africa, South America, and
Southern Asia.

We are looking for other products
that would be helpful to these areas to
develop their economy and to improve
their way of life. We can develop new
information systems, new ways of stor-
ing and retrieving information, or
handling it in computers. We can
design new devices that do some of the
thinking functions of men, that will
make education more effective and per-
haps contribute substantially to reducing
the cost of medical treatment. We can
design new devices for more efficient
“paper handling” in the service
industries.

Q. If I want to be a part of this new
activity, how should I plan my career?

A. First of all, recognize that the
meeting of needs and wants of society
with products and services is most
important and satisfying work. Today
this activity requires not only knowl-
edge of science and technology but
also of economics, sociology and the
best of the past as learned from the
liberal arts. To do the engineering
involved requires, at least for young
men, the most varied experience possi-
ble. This means working at a number
of different jobs involving different
science and technology and different
products. This kind of experience for
engineers is one of the best means of
learning how to conceive and design
—how to be able to meet the changing
requirements of the times.

Forscientists, look to those new fields
in biology, biophysics, information, and
power generation that afford the most
challenge in understanding the world
in which we live.

But above all else, the science explo-
sion of the last several decades means
that the tools you will use as an engi-
neer or as a scientist and the knowledge
involved will change during your life-
time. Thus, you must be in a position
to continue your education, either on
your own or in courses at universities
or in special courses sponsored by
the company for which you work.

Q. Does General Electric offer these
advantages to a young scientist or
engineer?

A. General Electric is a large diver-
siﬁed company in which young men
have the opportunity of working on a
variety of problems with experienced
people at the forefront of science and
technology. There are a number of
laboratories where research and ad-
vanced development is and has been
traditional. The Company offers incen-
tives for graduate studies, as well as
a number of educational programs
with expert and experienced teachers.
Talk to your placement officers and
members of your faculty. I hope you
will plan to meet our representative
when he visits the campus.

Atomic power

Monsanto . . . a world leader in chemicals, plastics and
petroleum products . . . has also taken a giant step into
the atomic space age. Now broadcasting signals from
space is a Transit satellite transmitter, powered by an
“atomic generator.” This long-lived power source is
fueled with plutonium 238 processed and encapsulated
at Mound Laboratory, which Monsanto Research
Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Monsanto,
operates for the Atomic Energy Commission.

This achievement is important to you because it suggests
the kind of future the Monsanto family offers the young
engineer of exceptional promise. You’ll be joining a

OUTSTANDING
. SENIORS

Every winter trimester each department in the Schools
of Engineering and Mines selects a man who best exempli-
ﬁes the characteristics of scholarship, leadership, character,
and service to the Schools and to the University. The man
is designated as the Outstanding Senior from his respective
department. Of these departmental winners, one is se-
lected as the Outstanding Senior in the Schools of Engi-
neering and Mines.

4 WILLIAM L. HOSICK of the Metallurgical Engineer-
ing Department is this year's Outstanding Senior.

While with the United States Army, he attended night
school at the University of Hawaii for two years. Since
entering the University of Pittsburgh in January, 1959,
Bill has compiled a record in all of the areas of scholar-
ship, leadership, character, and service that has made him
one of the most outstanding students who has attended
the University.

For his excellent record as a scho.lar, Bill has received
many honors. At Tap Day Ceremonies in 1960 he was
named Outstanding Freshman Scholar. In 1960 and 1961
he was a University Scholar for maintaining a 4.0 quality
point average. This year he has been elected to Phi Beta
Kappa. At present, Bill has a 3.97 quality point average.

However, Bill is outstanding not only in scholarship.
He has also demonstrated his qualities of leadership. He
has served as Business Manager for the Skyscraper Engi-
neer, Chairman of E. 8c M. Cabinet’s Outstanding Senior
Committee, Chairman of E. 8: M. Cabinet’s EMITT
Committee, Co-chairman of E. 8c M. Cabinet’s Faculty
Evaluation Committee, and President of his seminar. In
recognition of his leadership, Bill has been inducted into
Druids, Sophomore Leadership Honorary Fraternity, Omi-
cron Delta Kappa, the National Leadership Honorary
Fraternity of which he is Vice—President, and was also
named Senior Worthy at Tap Day Ceremonies.

Leadership is closely connected with service, and after
reading the above, one would say that Bill has served
well. In addition, Bill has tutored Freshmen students for
Phi Eta Sigma, written numerous articles for Skyscraper
Engineer, and assisted in the Admissions Ofﬁce in guiding
high school students around the campus. In recognition
of his service, the E. 8c M. Cabinet awarded Bill its Out-
standing Service Award.

For his qualities of scholarship, leadership, character,
and service, Bill received the EMITT award last year
and worked in a zinc sinter development laboratory in
Avonmouth, England.
