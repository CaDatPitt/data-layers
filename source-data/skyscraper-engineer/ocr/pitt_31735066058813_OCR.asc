    Almost two decades of tradition here at Pitt may
come to an end next year. Since its beginning in
1954, Engineers' Week has set this school of En-
gineering apart from all others in the area. The
twentieth celebration to be held in March of 1973,
however, may very well be the last. Why?
    Interest in planning Engineers' Week has been
on the wane for the past few years, possibly because
the very character of the engineering student is
changing. Gone is the majority of students with a
fierce competitive pride in their departments. Most
have been replaced by a student with no great
attachment to his chosen profession. He comes to
class, does his homework, and goes home to do more
homework. Few get a chance to enjoy any social
activities to learn how to get along with the kind of
people he'll be working for in industry.
    A severe blow to the future of Engineers' Week
was dealt on November 14 during the meeting of the
Executive Committee of the School of Engineering.
Present were the deans, the department chairmen,
and myself as a guest. The topic of discussion was
Engineering Cabinet's request that four half days of
Engineering classes be cancelled for Engineers'
Week. After much discussion, a motion was passed 4
to 2 to grant the class cancellations requested, with
the stipulation that IF THE PARTICIPATION IN
THE EVENTS THIS YEAR DOES NOT IMPROVE
OVER    PAST   YEARS, NO      CONSIDERATION
WILL BE GIVEN FOR FUTURE CANCELLA-
TIONS.


    Thus the success and amount of support given
to 'EW 73' now takes on even greater importance. If
you are a freshman, sophomore, junior, or faculty
member, ask yourself if Engineers' Week is worth
having. If you're a senior ask yourself if future fresh-
man engineers should be able to enjoy a week of
their own in March.
     Every effort has been made to change Engineers
Week into something to which everyone can relate.
Numerous surveys have been conducted, and the
small Central Planning Committee has wracked its
brains to come up with fresh ideas. We tried to
please everyone in some way, even though everyone
wanted something different. The traditionalists want-
ed games, gimmicks, and competition, and so the
Shamrock Award, along with competition, has been
revived to satisfy them. In addition the Executive
Committee would have us put on a public relations
show for them. Unfortunately, we are funded almost
entirely by student activities money, and Allocations
prefers we hold social events. I just want to see
everyone enjoy themselves for all the work I've been
putting into this thing.

QUESTION: How can engineering students and
faculty meet on an informal basis?
ANSWER: Have a chess tournament.


     That's exactly what the Chemical Engineers de-
cided to do, and according to Prof. A. A. Bishop, the
tournament has added a new dimension to the
department; a common, non-professional interest for
students and faculty.
     It all started during the heat of the Fischer-
Spassky championship tournament. Humberto Vain-
ieri, a graduate student and an avid chess player,
suggested a tournament among all members of the
Chemical Engineering Department. Humberto took
upon himself the task of organizing the tournament,
devising a system of elimination, and signing up
players.
     Twenty-four players signed to play and were or-
ganized into two divisions. The players determined
the places and times where the matches were to be
held. After each match, the players signed a sheet
verifying the results. Points were scored as follows:
One point for a win, one-half point for a draw, and
no points for a loss.
    The top three players in each division went into
the final round. The winner of the final round will
become the chess champion of the Chemical
Engineering Department. Dr. E. B. Stuart, the de-
partment chairman, has provided a trophy and chess
books to be used as prizes for the winner and
runners-up. These prizes will be given at the Chem E.
Christmas Party or at a special seminar.

     A special note should be made here about Prof.
Bishop. Although he was the top scorer in his divi-
sion, he graciously withdrew from the final round in
order to give students a chance at the trophy. His
goal in the tournament was accomplished, that of
promoting student-faculty interaction.
    How did students react to the tournament? The
consensus of the students was that the tournament
was a success. Bill Zapf, a junior, felt there wasn't
enough active participation. He did admit, however,
that the tournament was a worthwhile experience.
Another student, Bob Campagna, said the tourna-
ment provided friendly competition and a means of
meeting other people.
    Why should an article such as this even be in an
engineering magazine? The chess tournament was a
successful experiment. It could, and should, be used
by other departments as a means of improving
student-faculty relations. Remember, going to school
doesn't mean just getting an education, but meeting
people too. A chess tournament can effectively be
used for this purpose. Why not use it?

"JABBERWACK E.'

             (the Jabberwack Engineer)






                  Twas winter, and the slithy notes
                  Did gyre and gimble on the pages
                  All scribbly were the lab reports
     9          And the Books not touched for ages.

                  "Beware the Essay Test, my son!
              The Multiple Guess, the ones that Match!
                Beware the Trick Question, and shun
                  The Crib Sheet they may catch! "

     9           He took his Xeroxed notes in hand:
                 So long from class, 'twas all forgot -
     9          How plain to see what a dumdum he;
                   And now the whole term shot.
                 And, as in oafish thought he looked,
              Approached the prof, with eyes of flame;
                Came shiffling out the answer books
                    And snickered as they came!

          Page One! Page Two! And through and through
               The slide rule blade went snicker-snack!
               He left, near dead, with empty head,
                    And went galumphing back

                'And hast thou blown the Big Exam?
                Stay there at Pitt, my beamish boy!
              O summer school! You dolt! You fool! "
                     His father wrote, annoyed.

                 'Twas winter, and the slithy notes
                 Did gyre and gimble on the pages
                 All scribbly were the lab reports
                 And the Books not touched for ages.





    James Prescott Joule began to formulate the
laws of thermo about 1850 with his famous heat and
work experiments. Since then the theory behind the
science of heat and work has baffled a number of
engineering students. Not only did they find dif-
ficulty in grasping such things as entropy, energy,
and equilibrium but they could see little utility for
the functions developed through thermodynamics. I,
myself, could accept such harmless variables as heat
and work, but was rather confused about what I was
expected to do with such things as enthalpy, entropy,
free energy and internal energy. Here in concise form
for the first time in print is a random selection of
some of the research and thinking that thermo-
dynamics has provoked in Benedum Hall.
    Of course, any article on thermo should include
a few words on that variable that defies all physical
models, entropy.
    Dr. Brainard, professor    in  Chemical
Engineering, has a reputation for teasing students
each term with its properties. An automatic A goes
to any student who can prove that entropy
maximizes within an internal constraint. Of course
the problem is insoluble and even the king of thermo
himself has shelved it.
    Entropy and the second law of thermo have
stimulated some interesting thought concerning such
things as philisophical as the direction of time and
the theory of evolution. Both have been explained
using the fact that the entropy or the randomness of
the universe is always increasing.


f




     Dr. Brainard, however, reiterated a more prac-
tical conclusion of the second law concept which
produces a problem in an area in which he feels
research should be initiated. Fossil fuels are quickly
depleting and hopefully in the future nuclear or solar
energy will supply the power needed for tomorrow's
society.
     Organic molecules, however, are used for much
more than just fuel, as synthetics make up a large
portion of our clothes, furniture, cosmetics, and
medicine. From the second law of thermodynamics,
we can see where direct production of complex car-
bon molecules from carbon and hydrogen would be
almost impossible and certainly not economically or
ecologically feasible. Plants have this ability, but
rather than discover the process of photosynthesis,
Dr. Brainard proposes we polymerize the organic
molecules produced by plants to manufacture the
needed synthetics. The problem of substituting for
fossil fuels will have to be dealt with sometime in the
future and now is as good a time as any to start re-
search.
     Research on a different aspect of thermodyn-
amics, is being done by Dr. Meier of Material and
Metallurgical Engineering which employs Gibb's
free energy of formation rule. Dr. Meier is con-
cerned with the internal oxidation of a copper-
titanium alloy to produce a strong, electrically con-
ductive metal. The metal would then have great
utility in reducing the size of wire presently needed
for electrical circuitry, for instance.
    The electric conductivity of copper drops off
drastically as another metal is mixed with it. If the
foreign metal could be oxidized in the alloy, a sub-
stance would be produced that not only could con-
duct electricity like pure copper but would have the
strength of the initial alloy.
    Dr. Meier's research is based primarily on the
fact that titanium oxide's free energy of formation is
much less than that of cuprous oxide. Titanium oxide
will form when oxygen is diffused into the copper
titanium alloy, and cuprous oxide will not. Some
work is even being done with a copper-titanium
beryllium alloy. In this case the titanium and
beryllium oxidizes with the titanium oxide nucleating
on the beryllium oxide to provide more conductivity.


     The Mechanical Engineering Department has
also turned some attention to applied thermo-
dynamics, and Dr. Roher of that department spoke
to me about two projects in which he is currently in-
volved in this field.
     The first of these concerns an assertion made
some time ago stating that before man uses up all
available fossil fuels he will have caused an ice age as
a result of thermal pollution and the melting of the
polar ice caps. Dr. Roher is involved in proving the
validity of this assertion by studying the effects of
pollution on climate. Such things as the transfer of
radiation from the sun to the earth and the tropo-
sphere to the earth, along with thermal pollution and
particulate pollution are variables for the math
model being developed. The basic problem here
concerns formulating an accurate math model that
will use a minimum of computer time.
     The second of the projects mentioned by Dr.
Roher concerns a facet of thermo being pursued by
both the Mechanical and the Chemical Engineering
Departments. The Environmental Protection
Agency is presently dictating a decrease in the
amount of nitric oxide emitted by automobiles from
the present 6 grams per vehicle per mile to .4 grams
per vehicle per mile. Nitric oxide is responsible for
photochemical smog. Presently, a parametric pump
which runs off the auto engine is being used to re-
duce the amount of nitrogen entering the carburetor.
The problem then reduces to determining how much
nitrogen must be removed from the air to meet EPA
standards, and developing a pump to do the job. To
date only 15 per cent of the nitrogen has been re-
moved, and a heavier oxygen concentration is need-
ed. Professor Roher feels confident, however, that
the experiment will prove successful.

     How to call


  a stereo u



  bluff.




  A buff will probably tell you you've got to drop
a bundle to get a really great stereo system.
  Nonsense.
  Stereo is all in the ear. It's how it sounds,
not how it costs, that makes a stereo system
great.
  So next time some buff hands you that old line
call his bluff. See if he can figure out how much
you paid for your Sylvania matched component
stereo system. Just by listening.
  Pick your favorite record. Put it
on the BSR micro-mini turntable.
(If tape's your thing, slip one into
the 8-track cartridge playback.)
  Then balance the bass and
treble on the FM stereo
FM/AM tuner
and amplifier.
And let
him have it. h
  Make sure he
digs those round
low notes from the
two six-inch woofers.
And those high sweet
ones from the two
three-inch tweeters.
They're all air-
suspension speakers,
so they sound as good as standard
speakers two sizes larger.
  Your buff won't have a chance. He'll stand
there, surrounded by sound, completely bluffed.
Trying like crazy to figure out how much you laid
out for a stereo that sounds that great.
  But don't tell him.
  After all, you just want to call his bluff. Not destroy his ego.

    Despite the widespread impression that engi-
neering is a high-unemployment occupation, such is
not the case. Although layoffs due to the economic
recession and shifts in national spending priorities
created serious imbalances in certain specialized
fields and in some localities, engineering unemploy-
ment is only half the national average, according to
the best available figures. And those unemployed are
mainly older engineers. Despite the recession, few
engineering graduates of 1971 and 1972 have been
unable to find suitable jobs, although the number of
job offers did decline from high pre-1970 levels.
    More importantly, the demand for engineers is
picking up, even as the supply of new graduates
begins to fall. Even assuming conservative rates of
growth, the future demand for engineers should
remain strong for at least this decade and probably
beyond.
    This is not to say that employment problems will
not continue to develop as new technologies displace
old, but these are problems that affect older workers
in all occupations, not just engineering. Possession
of an engineering degree is clearly an advantage in
today's competitive job market, as it has always been
in the past.
Demand high
    In interpreting the projected growth of employ-
ment in various fields it is necessary to look at the
total number of people involved as well as the rate of
growth. Figure 1 illustrates the danger of looking
only at rates. At first glance this chart based on U.S.
Department of Labor data would lead the reader to
conclude that engineering is a field with relatively
low potential for growth. However, the two columns
on the right, also taken from U.S. Department of
Labor sources, put the picture in better focus.
Although the percentage increase for engineering
puts it well down on the graph, engineering actually
shows the greatest numerical growth, with 400,000
new jobs anticipated between 1970 and 1980, and the
largest number of openings annually.
     Occupations such as in psychology and eco-
nomics will absorb relatively few people in the next
decade, despite faster growth rates in those fields
than in engineering. Even the computer programmer
field will produce only half as many new jobs as
engineering.
     So given the number of available job openings,
engineers dissatisfied with their current positions
might have more success finding a better job in engi-
neering, rather than leaving the profession entirely.
Enrollments down
     Admittedly, government estimates of future
demand for engineers are quite speculative and
based on some restrictive assumptions. But the
future supply of college graduates can be estimated
somewhat more confidently from current enroll-
ments (figure 3). On that basis, the number of new
BS engineering graduates will decline through 1976


and probably beyond. An upturn, if it comes, will be
gradual rather than drastic as some engineering
schools are closing and others have trimmed their
staffs.
EJC calculations
     Because of uncertainties in government em-
ployment figures, I have devised a new employment
model for the Engineering Manpower Commission
of Engineers Joint Council. From college degree
statistics (which are quite accurately known),
statistical mortality rates and estimates of retire-
ment, I estimate that there were almost exactly 1
million engineering graduates alive and available for
work as of June, 1972.
     There are some uncertainties in this approach.
Death rates for engineers are usually assumed to
equal those for white males as derived from national
actuarial statistics. The Labor Department, which
has developed estimates for all important occupa-
tions, gives the average annual death and retirement
rate for engineers as 1.3 percent. The rate ranges
from a low of 0.7 percent for aeronautical engineers
to 1.9 percent for civil engineers.1
     Retirement rates are strongly age-dependent,
 especially in the 60-65 year age bracket. Since these
 rates are based on the age distribution of the labor
 force, they will change as the average age of the pro-
 fession increases. For example, more than the
 "normal" number of openings due to death and re-
 tirement are expected between 1985 and 1995 as the
 particularly large engineering graduating classes of
 1949, 1950 and 1951 approach retirement age.
     Losses due to death and retirement alone
 should create between 10,500 and 16,600 openings
 annually in 1972 and 1973, depending upon the
 extent to which new graduates are hired to replace
 nongraduates.
     Estimates of transfers out of the profession are
 even less certain. While government manpower
 studies show about 15 percent of all engineering
 graduates as working in nonengineering occupa-
 tions, 30 percent of all engineering society members
 list themselves as managers of major departments,

divisions, programs or organizations. Many engi-
neers obviously do not view the typical gradual move
upward from engineering to management as consti-
tuting a change in profession.
     Transfers out of engineering probably take
place unevenly over the years since they depend on
the particular interests of individuals and the relative
attractiveness of other fields of employment.

     The Bureau of Labor Statistics has estimated
that an average of 20,400 engineers per year will be
needed between 1968 and 1980 to make up for
transfers out of the profession. But this figure ap-
parently included a considerable number of non-
graduates entering and leaving engineering employ-
ment.2
     Updating the most recent Labor Department
figures to account for graduates who have entered
employment since 1970, I estimate that there are
about 1,280,000 people employed as engineers
according to Labor Department definitions, and that
37 percent of these do not have college degrees. This
leaves 805,000 graduate engineers currently em-
ployed in engineering work. The remaining 195,000
available graduates must be largely employed in
nonengineering work.
     This model, figure 4, is consistent with the
measured 1971 unemployment rate of 3 percent for
engineers4 and leads to the conclusion that about 17
percent of all engineering graduates counted are em-
ployed in other occupations.
     Looking ahead to 1980, the potential supply of
new graduates based on current enrollment trends
will realistically produce a supply of between 850,000





































and 980,000 graduate engineers - substantially less
than the Bureau of Labor Statistics' projected need
for 1.5 million (not all of whom would have degrees).
    Although there are valid reasons for arguing
that the Bureau's estimate may be too high, the
figures clearly indicate a shortage of graduate
engineers in the years ahead. Naturally, engineers in
fields with heavy support from the federal govern-
ment should watch government actions especially
closely. Engineering employment is particularly
sensitive to government spending on research and
development, which is highly engineering and
science intensive. In his recent Manpower Report to
Congress, President Nixon included some figures
showing how employment would be affected by
spending in different areas.3 These are shown in
graphical form in figure 5, illustrating dramatically
why the demand for engineers and scientists was re-
duced when national spending priorities were shifted
from aerospace and defense to other programs.
Other methods for adjusting demand
     When graduate engineers were in chronically
short supply, at least until 1969, employers were
under strong pressure to adjust demand to an
achievable level. They did this mainly by using their
own engineers more effectively and by redefining the
work content of many engineering jobs so that they


could be performed in part by nongraduates.
    The extent to which nongraduates make up
today's engineering work-force is not known exactly,
but is obviously substantial. Data from a 1969 censal
study support the 37 percent figure used in my man-
power model.4 A 1970 survey of employers by the
Engineering Manpower Commission showed     a
somewhat different picture - 9 percent of those
working as engineers had degrees in other fields, and
16 percent had no bachelor's degree at all. The
different figures result from differences in survey
definition, methodologies and timing.
    The fact that a substantial proportion of "engi-
neer" jobs can be filled by nonengineering graduates
is reflected in the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimate
that about half of the 1980 demand will be satisfied
by nongraduates and immigrants (who also do not
show up in statistics based on the number of gradu-
ates of U.S. schools). The federal government shut
the door to almost all immigrant engineers last
February, but restrictions are likely to be lifted as the
demand for engineers picks up. Similarly, a 1966
Engineering Manpower survey indicated that 25
percent of the engineering openings that year could
have been filled by graduates of a nonengineering
curriculum, and another 11 percent could have been
filled by nongraduates.5

    On the other hand, there is considerable flex-
ibility among curricula and degree requirements for
engineering jobs, allowing employers to draw on
engineering graduates from related fields when there
is a shortage of applicants in the field of first choice.
Engineering graduates are also in demand for other
kinds of employment - as management trainees,
scientists and technical salesmen, for example. Un-
doubtedly, a greater percentage of engineering
graduates could be absorbed elsewhere if there were
a major shortage of new engineering jobs, but this
extra factor has not been included in either my esti-
mates or the federal estimates for demand.
    In short: jobs are available now for practically
all young engineering   graduates, according to
reports from college placement officials. Changes in
demand will be reflected mainly in the range of
opportunities available and in the extent to which
competition forces engineering salaries to increase.

A Tribute To Dean Hoelscher



               Dean and Mrs. Harold E. Hoelscher were
           honored at a reception held in Bevier Library to ex-
           tend a formal farewell to them both from the student
           body and from the faculty. Engineering Student
           Cabinet president Chuck Norrish presented Mrs.
           Hoelscher a broach, and awarded Dean Hoelscher a
           plaque with the following inscription:
                        "Dean H.E. Hoelscher
           From Engineering Student Cabinet in appreciation
           for outstanding service to the   undergraduate
           students of the School of Engineering at the Univer-
           sity of Pittsburgh.

     Owners of small business and manufacturing
 enterprises in Southwestern Pennsylvania were of-
 fered concentrated courses in water pollution con-
 trol with a series of one-day seminars held at the
 University of Pittsburgh during February 1973.
     The new program, sponsored jointly by the
 Pennsylvania Technical Assistance Program (PENN-
 TAP), a state government agency, and the University
 of Pittsburgh, is designed to clarify existing state and
 federal regulations on water pollution abatement as
 they affect smaller commercial firms and industrial
 plants and to provide practical information on com-
 pliance procedures and requirements.
     Seminar participants will have acess to the com-
bined resources and expertise of the project
developers - the Pitt School of Engineering's
Department of Civil Engineering and the Environ-
mental Health Program of the Graduate School of
Public Health (GSPH) - as well as the experience
and know-how of prominent private consultants.
     Project supervisors are Dr. William A. Duvel,
assistant professor of civil engineering, and Dr.
Julian Andelman, associate professor of water chem-
istry. The project director is William S. Carlson.
     According to authorities, the major thrust of
water pollution control thus far has been in the cur-
tailment of waste discharges from major sources of
pollution, such as domestic sanitary sewage from
municipalities, and waste discharges from large
industrial complexes. However, they point out that
an important pollution source remains in the collec-
tive effluent of approximately 3,000 relatively small
manufacturing firms and an equally large system of
commercial service industries in the nine-county
area covered by Pitt's program.
    Regulation of this segment has already begun,
and more pressure will be brought to bear upon the
small businessman to institute some type of waste
treatment. Officials feel that most businessmen and
small manufacturers will obey the law and do what is
required of them, but it is feared that some may act
hastily without benefit of expert advice and install
costly equipment which might become outmoded by
legislative change.
    The educational service offered by Pitt and
PENNTAP is regarded as particularly timely in the
light of recent congressional action in overriding a
presidential veto to pass a water pollution control
bill which calls for compliance by stages by the year
1985.


    Recognizing that the requirements of different
industries vary, the seminars will be organized to
focus on particular industries, with special emphasis
on each industry's needs.
    The complete seminar for any industry occu-
pied one full day and was divided into three sections.
Mornings were devoted to explanation of the basics
of water pollution, a description of the regulatory
agencies involved and how they operate, and applic-
able regulations. The afternoon was tailored to the
needs of client industries with specific technical
solutions available for control. The evening session
was taken up with small group discussion of
participants problems, and an opportunity to talk
with technical experts about case histories and indi-
vidual difficulties.
    Each participant was furnished with a source
book which included outlines of material covered
in the seminar presentations and organizational
charts of federal, state, and local regulatory agen-
cies, with names, addresses, and telephone numbers
of key personnel in agencies having jurisdiction in
the region.
     Government agencies include the main federal
enforcement arm, the Environmental Protection
Agency, the Army Corps of Engineers, and other
water-related agencies such as the Coast Guard,
Geological Survey, Bureau of Reclamation, Federal
Power Commission, Bureau of Fisheries, Atomic
Energy Commission, and the Public Health Service;
the state's Department of Environmental Resources
and the Fish Commission, and regional authorities
such as the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation
Commission (ORSANCO), and the Southwestern
Pennsylvania Regional Planning Commission.
     Literature furnished also included pertinent
laws with definitions and interpretations, types of
treatment processes and their costs, where to find
qualified consulting agencies, sources of legal assist-
ance and various types of financial aid programs.
     In the event of post-seminar inquiries, Program
Director Carlson will be available on a limited basis
for site visits and field consultations throughout the
geographical area served -   the counties of
Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette,
Greene, Indiana, Washington, and Westmoreland.

    At a recent meeting of the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers, Commissioner Hunt,
Allegheny County Commissioner engaged in a law-
suit regarding the controversial Skybus issue, listed
some of his views and stands on Skybus. At the time
of his lecture, he was attempting to prove in court
that Skybus was not an acceptable system. He
repeatedly stated that the "state of the art" (en-
gineering) was not sufficient to make feasible an un-
manned and totally automated mass transit system.

Hunt Discusses Skybus


     Commissioner Hunt further described what he
considered the impracticality of Skybus. He main-
tained that there would be a necessity for the pre-
sence of an operator in the car for the sake of com-
muter safety. In order to make this feasible in terms
of operating costs, however, the necessary salary of
this employee would in turn have to be taken out of
commuter fares. Skybus, however, has a low com-
muter capacity - 27 persons per car. (The pro-
moters of Skybus claim that they can carry 26 addi-
tional standees on each car, but Hunt insists that,
"No system in the world can carry this overload.")
    The size of the car, and thus the number of
passengers, is limited by the fact that the proposed
car is a rubber tired vehicle. Hunt stressed that when
a rubber tire system is used there is a loss of energy
which is converted to heat. In summertime he felt it
would be impossible to air-condition the stations
adequately. Also, no transit system with rubber tires
can safely be run in winter on roads open to snow
and ice argued Hunt. The rubber tire skids and slides
- when this rubber tire was tested under such winter
conditions it stopped after sliding for 320 feet, which
Hunt felt could not be considered an acceptable
margin of safety for emergency stops. Hunt said the
only way to preclude this problem was to have ap-
proximately 240 miles of heated runway in winter,
the cost of which would be extremely prohibitive.
The rubber tire had another point against it in that it
would necessitate changes every 7,000 or 8,000
miles, whereas a steel wheel can last 80,000 miles.
Hunt also pointed out that, as opposed to the public
relations claims, the speed of Skybus would be con-
trolled by the number of necessary stops it would be
forced to make while going through an urban com-
munity. The vehicles would also not be able to go up
grades over 6 per cent because the people standing
on board would fall. He repeated that no existing
rapid transit system in the world has ever been built


anticipating the use of "unmanned   vehicles.".
    Commissioner Hunt also discussed those factors
which he felt comprised a proof of the fiscal imprac-
tibility of Skybus. Hunt claimed that Allegheny
County simply didn't have the money to support
their share of the costs. It had other pressing
expenditures, among them airport and sewage costs.
Besides this, the actual costs of implementing the
system, as seen from the costs of the construction
and purchasing which has already been started,
would be vastly higher than those cited by the pro-
ponents of Skybus. Hunt further declaimed the irres-
ponsibility of starting construction before the system
had been adequately tested. He stated that there
exists no other case on record in which a system of
transportation, whether innovative, or old, the ven-
der asked to do the feasibility study on its own pro-
duct. In the Skybus case, Parsons, Brincherhoff,
Quade, and Douglas were hired by the venders of
Skybus to do the feasibility study, and subsequently
fired after they reported on the impracticality of the
system. Commissioner Hunt stressed that normally
no transportation system in the United States is al-
lowed to be started unless all the costs are known
and considered but in this too, Skybus was an excep-
tion.

    Hunt mentioned the popular conception of the
advantage of automation. He said that any system
can be automated, but in some situations this simply
isn't beneficial. He talked about the cooperation be-
tween special interest groups who stood to make a
profit making the Skybus situation clearly under-
stood. Furthermore, he declared, that the local com-
munity was simply without the funds for extensive
research and development into this system and its ef-
fects.

ROOM TO LET


... Yep, that's right. We have
room to let a few more
people (thirty or so) join the
Skyscraper staff. So, if
you can write, draw, take
pictures, or produce drivel
like this, give us a call!







































           .and thanks an awful

           lot for visiting us!


Five years ago companies were hungry for graduating engineers. Last
year graduating engineers were hungry for jobs.
Now it's easier both ways. You have choice. We have choice. Honesty
can prevail. We can part friends if we see we weren't meant for each
other. Maybe a little self-description here would save time:


* Only very rarely does Kodak hire a
manager. We hire workers, and some
  of them grow into managers. We
  consider engineers workers. A young
  engineer who lets on that his engi-
  neering is only temporary until he
  becomes a manager makes us un-
  comfortable. Yet we have some sur-
  prisingly young managers.
* We prefer engineers who know the
  difference between engineering and
  science. An engineer is a person who
  has learned a lot of science, not for


  the purpose of creating still more
  science, but for getting things done.
  (We also happen to need scientists.)
* Take, for example, a newly minted
  E.E. who shines in circuit design. Im-
  pressive talent. Hired. Could be put
  to work in that specialty but is lured
  instead into manufacturing engi-
  neering, a real action area. Expected
  there to be happy and productive
  spending 15% of time designing cir-
  cuits and the rest on a tool design
  project befitting a mechanical engi-
  neer. At the same time we have
  mechanical engineers doing some
  chemical engineering. Also vice versa.
* Engineers tell the factory what to do.
  How can you tell somebody what to
  do if you've never done it yourself?
  Since our factories do things nobody


  else knows how to do, it would be a
  while before you really earn your
  keep.
But we're interested in you. If you are
interested in us, you can write us some-
thing about your hangups, but tell us
more about your strengths. Eastman

We never stop learning
Since 1922, all college graduates employed
through Bethlehem's Loop Course have par-
ticipated in an orientation program at corpo-
rate headquarters. As they progress in their
careers, they benefit from other management
training activities. Another new program has
recently been added: an advanced orientation
course for experienced supervisory and man-
agement personnel to further educate and
broaden their understanding of our company
and their role in the company's future growth
and development. These programs are all part
of our corporation's continuing education and
development.

Our new corporate home
Martin Tower is the new address of our cor-
porate headquarters. Located in northwest
Bethlehem, Pa., the Tower brings together
many departments that have been scattered
in various locations around the city. The struc-
ture is 21 stories of steel and glass.

New ore boat on the Lakes
The Stewart J. Cort is Bethlehem's newest ore
carrier on the Great Lakes. She is 1,000 feet
long, longer than any other Great Lakes ore
carrier. Another investment to help cut the
cost of steelmaking, the Cort carries 54,000
gross tons of ore pellets from Erie Mining's
loading facility at Taconite Harbor on Lake
Superior to our steel plant on Lake Michigan
at Burns Harbor, Ind. She makes a round trip
about every 51/2 days throughout the shipping
season.


Computerization
continues
Our data processing experts continue to de-
velop new systems. For example, consider
our fasteners plant at Lebanon, Pa.-largest
of its type in the nation. A new computer-
oriented control system has made possible a
20% reduction in product inventories. Order
entry and production scheduling are com-
puterized for speed, accuracy and efficiency.
Computers constantly monitor product inven-
tories and the status of orders in production.
It all pays off in better productivity and faster
customer service.

R&D wins another award
The American Iron and Steel Institute recently
presented an award to F. M. Temmel, a mem-
ber of Bethlehem's Research Department, for
his paper on a method of treating steel proc-
essing and mining wastewaters. It's another
example of public and professional recogni-
tion of our programs for a quality environment.
The paper outlines the development of a high-
density sludge (HDS) process for neutralizing
acid wastewaters. The process reduces the
volume of the resulting sludge to as little as
1/50 of that produced by conventional neu-
tralization.

EDITORIAL-


    With the fast approach of Engineers' Week '73, I
cannot help being disappointed about the prospects
of this year's concert.
    I'm sure everyone has heard the news that this
year due to a cutback from Allocations (i.e. financial
coercion) we will be forced to share our concert with
the Greeks. This arrangement has inspired some
misgivings in me since its first announcement, and
has spurred me to attempt to discover some of the
background behind the decision.
    The following is a statement made by Jim Stana,
Central Planning Chairman, in response to my
queries concerning the decision to merge concerts.
      "The decision to form a combined Engineers'
  Week and Greek Week concert rather than have
  separate concerts, was based on a series of events
  and a list of well established facts.
     1. In June of 1972, Central Planning Committee
       submitted a request for $10,000 for a concert
       for Engineers' Week to Student Government
       Allocations. Since the request represented a
       large expenditure for winter programming,
       Allocations told us that it ,would be con-
       sidered later as an emergency request when
       more details were available. We were also
       told to consider the possibility of a com-
       bined concert since Greek Week and Engi-
       neers' Week concerts would be only one
       week apart.
    2. In September of 1972, I was contacted by the
       programming advisor of the Student Union.
       All concerts booked on campus with student
       activities,money must go through him. He
       also suggested a combined concert. He is
       also the fraternity advisor.
    3. We discussed the idea among engineers and
       those on the Student Government Board
       with whom we were able to talk. The follow-
       ing facts became evident.
    a. Allocations Committee historically has been
       pretty tight in their past decisions and has
       especially been nasty toward engineers.
    b. Six of the seven Board members were
       Greeks, one of whom was the only engineer
       on the Board. The Greks obviously stood to
       gain from the combined concert.
    c. We found that no advanced sales to special
       interest groups like engineers would be
       allowed and there was some doubt as to


        whether we would be allowed to sell tickets
        in Benedum Hall.
     d. There was no great strong opposition from
        the Board which we could count on to over-
        turn a combined concert recommendation
        from Allocations.
     e. Historically, engineers are pretty apathetic,
        so we could not count on a general uproar of
        engineering students to pressure the Board
        into giving us a separate concert.
     f. Hopefully, rather than  get at best
        $7500 for a separate concert (which Alloca-
        tions had told us they would not even con-
        sider) we thought that we might be able to
        get a decent concert if we combined our
        Allocations request with the Greeks. The
        date of the concert would be at the end of
        Engineers' Week, so that it wouldn't seem
        much different as far as Engineers' Week
        was concerned."

    I think it is rather alarming to hear that one of
Allocation's reasons for combining the two concerts
is the fact that Greek Week and Engineers' Week are
back to back. I can not help but speculate that soon
we will be advised to combine all the activities of the
two weeks in an effort to save funds. Engineers'
Week has always been a week designed for students
and faculty of the School of Engineering, and as such
I see no reason for us to be deprived of the right to
host a concert independent of any other campus or-
ganization.
    It is also interesting to note that the Allocations
Committee recommended $300 in movie income be
returned in payment, with any profit over that cost
going to the School for the Blind Service Project,
while the Greeks were allocated $800 for entertain-
ment for Fun Night, and no return of income was
suggested.
    Much of the information I have been able to
gather points to the fact that the Engineering School
activities are indeed receiving a disproportionately
small measure of the fees paid by their 1200 member
undergraduate student body. I suggest that Alloca-
tions is exhibiting prejudicial behavior toward engi-
neers and I would welcome any response from a
member of that committee which could explain
these anomalies in treatment of engineers.

WESTERN ELECTRIC REPORTS


  A*(z,t) = Ae*(z) - [(Af*-Ai*)/(1-e -fNtr)]e-/3Nt

In developing the model at Western Electric's Engineering
Research Center, it was found that melting behavior can
be described by this formula which includes terms for
shear heating and conduction heating effects. Other models
were developed for temperature and pressure profiles.


Molding by the millions. Western Electric people produce some
8 million phones a year. Molded plastic is used for housings and
many other parts. So there is a constant investigation into the
most effective way to use these materials.


End of molding cycle. At this point, the screw is stationary
and heat is conducted into the plastic on the screw. After
the plastic solidifies, the mold is opened as shown. The
parts can then be ejected.


Solving the mysteries of molding with mathematics.


     Even though plastics have been
around for many years, there's still a lot
to be learned about these versatile mate-
rials and their processing. So they are the
subject for continuing studies by our
engineers.
     Some of their recent investigations
have brought forth new and highly useful
information about a relatively unexplored
area: the melting behavior of plastics in
the injection molding process.
     One result of these studies is the
mathematical formula, or model, above.
     The model helps us predict melting
behavior along the length of the injection
screw molding machine used to mold tele-
phone housings and other parts. Melting
behavior is extremely important, because
plastic pellets should be completely
melted but not thermally decomposed
before injection into the mold.
     This information on melting is then
used to investigate screw designs, operat-
ing conditions, machine sizes and plastic
properties. All of which is aimed at ob-
taining optimum processing techniques.
     Predictions obtained from the mathe-
matical model have checked out closely


with experimental observations. So the
resulting screw designs are now under-
going evaluation by engineers at our
plants in Indianapolis and Shreveport.
     Conclusion: For new designs and
materials, the model can help reduce the
development cost for new molded parts
and materials. For manufacturing current
products, operating costs can be reduced.
     Perhaps most significant is that we're
getting information about molding tem-
peratures not available experimentally.
And many other types of information can
be obtained without the use of costly,
time-consuming experimental work.
     The end result will be more efficient
plastic molding and therefore a better
product for the lowest possible cost.

Dear Miss Zakrzewski:
    I just had the good fortune of reading a copy of
the FALL SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER. I felt special
empathy with the article "the staff speaks out!" First,
I'd like to make a minor correction. You see, Joan
Fitzpatrick is not SKYSCRAPER'S first female
member. I was. If you look at some copies around
1966-67, you'll see that the Business Manager was
Heather Harris.
    I took over with circumstances similar to yours.
I first had to throw out all the unsold copies, clean,
paint, and put a tile floor in the office before I could
even start to get the magazine out of the red. I only
regret that I didn't have a female editor with good in-
tentions to throw out the jokes and improve the edi-
torial department. After the first issue, I couldn't
believe the jokes - neither could Dean Hoelscher!
    I wasn't an engineering student but I went on to
public relations and being the editor of a magazine
for Duquesne Light. I, too, had the misfortune of not
receiving any scholarship aid for my efforts but it
was rewarding anyway. In my profession the tech-
nical background I picked up was very helpful.
    I hope you and your staff enjoy this year as
much as I enjoyed my tenure.
    I wish you and your staff much luck with your
SKYSCRAPER. I'm sure your enthusiasm     and
imagination will make it the best ever.
             Most sincerely yours,
             Heather L. Stein




(Editor's Note - We would like to apologize to Ms.
Stein for the mistake in our last issue and thank her
for her interest and considerate letter.)
