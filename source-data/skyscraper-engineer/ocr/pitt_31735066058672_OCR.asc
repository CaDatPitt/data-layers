opping or marching-
two paths to a career

A career is sometimes deﬁned as a
succession of jobs, whether with a suc-
cession of employers, or within a single
company.

A man is commonly said to be
"hopping” when he progresses by
switching from one employer to
another.

The man who sticks with a single
employer can be said to progress by
"marching."

Marching Pays 0ﬂ—There are many
advantages to a one-company career.
It's obvious that tenure is accom-
panied by status, security, and bene-
ﬁts that build in value as the years go
by. More signiﬁcant, perhaps, are the
intangibles. You can't put a dollar
value on your familiarity with the
organization and the people in it.
And the respect they have for you is
equally important. The man who is
dedicated to his employer, and conﬁ-
dent of his ability to progress without
looking aﬁeld, is free of distracting
tensions, free to concentrate his full
energies on the job at hand. And,
especially to the family man, just
"being settled” is mighty reassuring.

Finding the Right Employer — The
problem facing a graduating senior is
to locate a prospective employer that
offers an ambitious man promising

 

opportunities for a truly rewarding
and satisfying career. The best answer
we know of is to look for a company
with a ﬁrm policy of “promotion from
within." And a second consideration
is the size and scope of the organiza-
tion.

Loopers are Career Men—Every year
Bethlehem Steel Company enrolls a
group of graduating seniors in the
Loop Course—the entire class makes
an observational circuit (or "loop") of
a steel plant during the basic training
period. We select qualiﬁed men for the
Loop Course on the basis of their
potential for careers in management,
and we train them accordingly. There
are about 2,000 loopers on the job at
Bethlehem, at all supervisory levels,
and in all of our diverse operations.

The Loop Cozcrse—New loopers report
to our general headquarters, in Beth-
lehem, Pa., usually early in July. They
attend a basic course of ﬁve weeks, in-
cluding lectures, classroom discus-
sions, educational ﬁlms, and daily
plant visits. The Loop Course is not a
probationary period. After completion
of the course, every looper receives his
ﬁrst assignment. Then, after reporting
to a plant, yard, or home oﬁice divi-
sion, he receives further orientation

Bethlehem loopers embark on their
careers with thorough training behind
them.

Big and Dir/ersiﬁed—Because of its
size and diversity, Bethlehem Steel
offers unlimited opportunities to “get
ahead." One of the nation's largest
industrial corporations, with over
140,000 employees, we are engaged in
raw materials mining and processing;
basic steelmakin g and the production of
a wide range of steel products; manu-
facturing; structural-steel fabricating
and erecting; and shipbuilding and
ship repair. A new centralized research
facility, the Bethlehem Steel Company-
Homer Research Laboratories, costing
in excess of $25 million, located in
Bethlehem, Pa., rivals the ﬁnest in
any industry.

THE ENGINEER
IN OVERSEAS WORK

By ALBERT W. PLUMMER

In overseas work the Am-erican Engineer has the oppor-
tunity to test his ingenuity to the maximum extent to
which the name of the profession implies. The situations
in which he is likely to ﬁnd himself are normally consider-
ably different than those found in the United States. If
he is truly ingenious he will find it to be most helpful.

Jobs overseas can be both challenging and frustrating.
The engineer may be deeply involved in a project of such
national importance that it reaches into the highest levels
of government policy and attention. On the other hand,
he may ﬁnd himself out in the jungle somewhere that
isn’t even shown on a map. In any case, he is likely to be
drawing more salary than a local engineer of comparable
education and to have much more responsibility for his
experience than would be the case in the United States.
He is more likely to have to struggle with problems of
supply, personnel, and keeping alive. He is likely to have
to work with considerably less experienced fellow workers
and supervisors than would be the case in the U.S. These

MR. ALBERT W. PLUMMER received his B.S. in Civil
Engineering from the University of Washington. Mr.
Plummer wrote this article for the SKYSCRAPER EN-
GINEER last year while he was attending Pitt’s Summer
Institute in Economic, Social, and Industrial Development.
Mr. Plummer’s most recent position was Engineering Ad-
visor to the United States Operations Mission to Turkey.

are just some of the things that make life challenging
overseas, but one must be mentally prepared for the dif-
ferent way of life that brings these about. To be rigid is
near fatal in dealing with the problems of the overseas
work in cultural settings that differ greatly from ours.
There is almost a constant need to train the nationals
who work with one, for the American engineer would not
be drawing the high salary and be doing the work over-
seas if there were sufficient local engineers capable of
solving the problems.

Now let us deal with some of these differences in further
detail.
PROFESSIONAL SATISFACTION

In the less developed countries of the world today the
engineering profession is generaly highly respected. Where
literary levels are low and the way of life is simple, people
in general are very observant with their eyes and are more
impressed by what they see than by what they read or
hear. In this type of setting the engineer that builds the
large projects and machines and buildings is seen to be an
important man. He is a symbol of modern power and
accomplishment that the average person can somewhat

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

understand. The national leaders look to him to provide
the modernizing change which is the present trend of
the times. '

The number of professional and highly educated people
in the developing countries is likely to be a small percent
of the total population. These countries are just begin-
ning to construct the vestiges of modern society. There-
fore, the American engineer may ﬁnd himself right in the
middle of a young nation’s aspirations and associate with
the highest professional and administrative officials of the
government and leading business concerns. As a conse-
quence, what he does may be watched with interest by
high ofﬁcials and the common man alike and his stature
may go up or down rapidly according to the way he per-
forms in the eyes of the local population. On the other
hand, such ofﬁcials lack the experience of many of their
American counterparts and often expect too much too
quick with too little facilitating support. All of this con-
stitutes a challenge to the American engineer to be in-
genious enough to recognize his problems and to improve

the practical solutions that ﬁt the local conditions and
earn the respect of the local people. I use the word earn
with all of its inference concerning effort and difficulty,
because expectations are usually high and rather unpre-
dictable. As a consequence, some simple performance may
be well received and talked about whereas a really diffi-
cult accomplishment may be taken for granted. Such is
the way of life overseas and one has to be adaptable and
take the bad with the good without losing stride.

When the engineers move in and construct major proj-
ects, such as a network of modern highspeed national
highways, they are, in effect, participating in a revolu-
tionary program that will change the lives of millions of
people who are just beginning to realize what wonderful
things the world has to offer. To be a part of such en-
deavors can bring more professional satisfaction than, for
example, improving an American highway from a sub-
standard 45 miles per hour to a superhighway of 60 miles
per hour. When engineers help devise projects such as the

JANUARY 1962

Indus River Development Project, they are participating
in the future welfare of millions of people in India and
Pakistan.

TYPES OF ENGINEERING

The types of engineering jobs overseas. may be divided
generally as follows according to type of organization and
type of engineering services utilized:

U.S. Private Companies

Sales and promotion of American machines and equip-
ment.

Management and operation of foreign factories.

Investigation, planning, design of major projects.

Construction of factories, highways, water power, and
airport projects.

Local Foreign Companies

Consulting and advisory service on methods, approach
and techniques.

Technical designs of_ special factories and appurte-
nances

Specialized construction of factories and appurtenances.

Foreign Government
Technical Assistance (including organizing and train-

ing).

Very few American engineers are hired on a long term
basis by foreign companies or governments since the sal-
aries of American engineers are generally much higher
than those of local or European engineers of equal educa-
tion. The American engineers have to compete by pro-
viding a highly specialized talent that is not available
from engineers of other countries. As a consequence the
foreign organization is likely to want the American special-
ist who can train the local staff for the long term repeditive
jobs and to do the short term specialized jobs of major
difficulty and importance. For this reason the young in-
experienced engineer is generally not sought for hire by
the foreign governments or private foreign companies at
salaries competitive with those in the U.S. The same
situation generally applies to being hired by the U.S.
government, which is usually called upon to furnish high
level technical advice.

The American companies that have foreign operations
are likely to offer the best starting opportunities for young
engineers, as they can frequently utilize them under the
supervision of more experienced engineers of their staff
and can develop them rapidly to ﬁt into their overseas
operations. In this category are oil companies, construc-
tion companies, and branch factories of U.S. companies.
Such organizations frequently put the young engineer
through some training and testing in their U.S. operations
before sending him overseas. The American consulting
ﬁrms that do detailed designs of projects for foreign con-
struction can use a limited number of inexperienced en-
gineers in the home office or major design offices until
they have sufficient experience to send on foreign assign-
ments. In cases where the foreign work requires a strong
healthy engineer to work in primitive surroundings with-
out dependents, the more experienced engineers may be
difficult to recruit and engineers with limited experience
frequently are able to obtain such jobs and gain the ex-
perience needed to command better jobs. In such cases,
the young engineer may have responsibility that would be
unthinkable if he worked in the U.S.

GETTING THE JOB DONE
Since the salaries of the American engineers are rela-

12

C it

tively high, there is good cause to want to use as much
local talent as possible in order to keep the engineering
costs down. As a consequence, the American engineer is
likely to ﬁnd himself surrounded by untrained or inex-
perienced assistants, helpers, or what have you, seeking
to learn his job or assist him. These associates may be
interested and eager to learn, but they have a very differ-
ent background of experience and culture. To get them
producing efficiently is an education in training. The
American engineer may need considerable assistance from
these local associates to accomplish his mission. Training,
therefore, becomes a never ending process in many in-
stances and the success of the American Engineer may
depend greatly upon how successfully he can train the
local people to help him. This requires patience, under-
standing, tact, and a real effort to teach in ways beﬁtting
the varied experiences and backgrounds of the local staff.
The training of the local staff is in the long run one of
the most important things the American can do from the

local viewpoint. If done diligently and sympathetically,

he will win friends even though reducing the needs for
future foreign engineering assistance.

In general the American engineer will ﬁnd that basic
data required for planning and design will usually be
weak by American standards and its collection and utili-
zation will require much judgment and a good deal of
ingenuity and good common sense. In addition the prob-
lems of transporting may take on new dimensions involv-
ing slow rough roads or trails and frequent long hikes on
foot. The vehicles themselves may be difﬁcult to obtain
when needed and may be of poor quality and consume
much time; especially when spare parts have to be ordered
from a foreign country. Supplies and equipment may be
delayed in customs or by the red tape of import regula-
tions and procurement procedures. The telephones are
likely to be overloaded and frequently out of order. Com-
mon supplies probably do not exist on the shelves of a
nearby store and require long shipping time. All this adds
up to delays, frustrations, and a great need for advanced
planning and foresight along with the right mental atti-
tude of plugging along while not letting the job get you

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

down. The engineer must expect unusual problems and
troubles for, as the local people will tel.l, “We wouldn't
need your help if we didn’t have problems and troubles
and if; we always did everything right.”

' ’ CHANGING YOUR FAMILY LIFE

The engineer with the challenge of his work can fre-
quently adjust to foreign living more easily than his fam-
ily. For all members of the family, sanitation and health
is apt to be a problem that takes much of the joy out of
the stimulating new experience of living in a different
culture and witnessing ﬁrst-hand the different sites and
ways of the people of the foreign land. To get along well,
the wife needs to be a little adventuresome and willing
to forego many of the ordinary comforts of American life
in exchange for some of foreign origin. She will likely
forego the drudgery of cleaning and dishwashing and will
have more leisure, but will have to adjust to supervising
domestic help and tolerating the imperfections of the elec-
tricity, water supply, local draftsmen, and shops. In return
she will get a perception of how nice some of the things
are she has formerly taken for granted. In any case, you
can be sure that your outlook on life will be broadened
by some foreign experience.

The act of packing, moving, and encountering and
overcoming unanticipated problems can be frustrating and:
disconcerting at times, but it keeps you from getting in a
rut and has to be considered as part of the price of
traveling and gathering in the rich experience of other

lands and cultures. However, one should recognize these
aspects as part of. the way of life involved in foreign work.
He should balance the advantages against the disadvan-
tages and not expect that it will be all to the good, even
though it is almost always challenging and offers wide

-opporunities for individual initiative.

If, as a young engineer, you have strong interest in the
social development of people, as well as in the technical
aspects of engineering, you can ﬁnd satisfaction in the
challenges of overseas work.

ATOMIC

POWER?

By JOSEPH LANCE

One of the greatest needs of mankind is a source of
abundant .low cost power. It is needed immediately for
several reasons. They are: the great and increasing use of
energy, the decreasing reserve of conventional fuels, and
the need to improve living conditions in al.l parts of the
world.

 

JOSEPH LANCE, a senior M.E., works for the Westing-
house Electric Corporation in the Undergraduate Student
Program. His work in power and propulsion has given
him an excellent background for this article. ]oe, who has
written several articles for the SKYSCRAPER ENGI-
NEER, also belongs to the American Rocket Society.

16

The first of these reasons, the great rate of energy use,
is one of the most striking characteristics of modern times.
This energy rate is so large that it is convenient to use a
symbol to represent it. If we let E represent a ﬁgure of
300 million million kilowatt hours we are using 0.lE or 30
million million kilowatt hours per year. Dr. Homi 
Bhabha, Secretary to the Government of India for the De-
partment of Atomic Energy, has estimated that in the ﬁrst
eighteen and one half centuries after Christ 9E of energy
was consumed at an average rate of less than 0.5E per cen-
tury. The growth of industry was so rapid after 1850 that
another 5E was consumed by 1950. when the present rate
of l0E per century was reached.

The total energy value of the worlds reserve of conven-
tional fuels is estimated at 40 to 100E so it appears that
there is enough conventional fuel available for at least
another four centuries. But Nathaniel B. Guyol of the
United Nations Statistical Ofﬁce has found that our
energy needs are increasing at the rate of four percent
per year. This increase is due to world wide industrializa-
tion and population growth. By the year 2000 the popu-
lation of the earth will number about ﬁve billion. At that
time the rate of energy use will be approximately 0.5E
per year. This is one hundred times the E rate before the
Industrial Revolution, and yet it is a conservative estimate
because it neglects the possibility of war or serious eco-
nomic disturbances. Since the United States and Russia
are engaged in the cold war, either ﬁerce economic com-
petition or war itself must be expected. Therefore, it is

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

very possible that the world will exhaust it supply of con-
ventional fuels before the end of the century.

The cold war in the form of peaceful competition is the
improvement of living conditions in the underdeveloped
areas of the world. However, it is not possible to improve
living conditions without increasing the rate of energy use.

The following table shows the relationship between
energy use and standard of living. One column shows the
average annual income per person and the other column
the annual energy used per person in terms of coal.

INCOME ENERGY
(Dollars) (Tons o-f Coal)
UNITED STATES ............ .. 2000 8.0
GREAT BRITAIN .......... .. 1000 4.5
INDIA .................................. .. 50 0.5

If India and similar nations are to raise their living
standards, they need a supply of low cost energy. They
cannot import fuel and raise living standard because the
shipment of bulky conventional fuels is too expensive.
When future needs are considered, not only India, but
also Europe, Asia, South and Central America, Africa,
and Australia are without adequate conventional fuel re-
sources. Even if the population of India could be stablized
at 400 million and all of the native conventional fuel
utilized, the standard of living can be raised to only one
tenth of ours. But India cannot possibly stabilize its popu-
lation, and problems involved in utilizating its fuel re-

tracting power from the atom. This is a wooden mock-up of such

sources are formidable. In this keystone Asian country
where starvation is common, animal dung is used for fuel
instead of fertilizer while coal lies buried in the earth.
Sufﬁcient capital is not available to mine the coal and to
build railroads for distribution of it. The only solution
to India’s dilemma is the use of low cost atomic power.

The cost of energy is a serious factor even in the in-
dustrial nations which already have a relatively high
standard of living. If the European countries are to re-
main competitive with the rest of the world, they need a
growing source of low cost power. Norway and Switzer-
land, which depend on hydroelectricity, can still expand
their power supply for another twenty years. Then the
cost of building larger dams farther up in the hills will
become prohibitive. England, one country that is im-
porting fuel at the present time, has found that produc-
tion of electricity by atomic power is already competitive
with coal. In fact, the United States is one of the few
areas in the world where it is cheaper to burn coal than
to use atomic energy. Present estimates indicate that this
condition will be reversed by 1975 or sooner.

All of these factors illustrating the need for low cost
atomic power are related. At the same time that the
world’s population is growing at such a rate that it will
double in the next forty years, the majority of mankind
is no longer content to live in poverty. As the people of
Asia, Africa, and South America increase their living
standards, the conventional fuel resources of the world
will be rapidly consumed and atomic power will become
an absolute necessity for further progress.

principles—not to study pinheads, but to enable the
scientists in Fundamental Research to study the atomic
structures and surfaces of metals. With this amazingly
powerful instrument, they can actually see and identify

individual atoms!

Whatever their specialized training, those who work at
U. S. Steel are likely to be surprised, at the start, by

LIGHTNING
RESEARCH

Many people around the University have seen the ﬂag-
pole on top of the Cathedral of Learning that never flies
a ﬂag and have probably wondered what it was. This
‘ﬂagpole’ is not really a ﬂagpole; it is a mast for a light-

ning research project being conducted by the VVesting-
house Electric Corporation. The project is under the
direction of Mr. D. F. Shankle, manager of the Trans-
mission Section, Electric Utility Engineering Department
(EE’43). There have been various lightning research proj-
ects going on atop the Cathedral since shortly after its

at completion. The ﬁrst of these projects consisted of an

iron pipe held in place by guy wires. In order to elec-
trically insulate the building from the pipe, the guy wires
were insulated by wooden strain insulators made of a
high strength laminate. ‘Magnetic Links’ were connected
to the mast in such a way that current in the mast, due
to a lightning stroke, had to pass through them. The
‘Magnetic Links’ were made of an iron composition so that
the current would magnetize them and they would retain
their magnetism. By means of calibration tests and suit-
able instruments this retained magnetism could be meas-
ured and the strength of the magnetizing current could
be determined. During the period that this apparatus
was used the largest lightning ﬂash ever recorded———esti-
mated at 350,000 amperes, was received. This caused a
flashover in the previously mentioned guy wire insu-
lators. Since the magnitude of lightning strokes is
a purely random affair, frequency distribution curves of
the data obtained at the Cathedral were combined with
the curves of several other similar installations on a
nation-wide basis. The frequency distribution curve was

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

a plot of the current against the percentage of strokes
exceeding this particular value of current.

The reason for choosing the Cathedral for this project
is fairly obvious. The possibility of a structure being
struck by lightning increases as the heighth increases. As
an example of this an electric power transmission line,
approximately 100 feet high has the probability of being
struck once in five years; the Cathedral, 550 feet high,
twice a year; and the Empire State Building in New York
City, l350 feet high, twenty times a year. Since the aim
of this project is to investigate the effects of lightning
striking power transmission lines, the Empire State Build-
ing would be an unsuitable location because lightning
striking this building is.not typical of that striking power
lines. However, the Cathedral, because of surrounding
hills, approximates this condition very closely. People in
a building such as the Cathedral wou.ld, of course, be
unaware of the building being struck by lightning. The
only indication would be that of a bright ﬂash and a clap
of thunder occurring simultaneously, indicating that there
had been a stroke in the immediate vicinity.

The present mast was installed when the topmost room
was altered to become the board room for the Board of
Directors of the University. During the alterations the
old mast had to be removed. V/Vhen the renovations were
completed a new mast was installed. It was decided to
make the new mast sell’-supporting and to use a completely
new type of mast. This is the mast which can be seen
from the ground today. It is made from 50 feet of tapered
aluminum tubing similar to the type used for flagpoles.
The pole tapers from ten inches in diameter at the bottom
to ﬁve inches at the top and is capped with a ball eight
inches in diameter. The base of the mast is insulated
from the top of the building by means of four sets of
high strength porcelain insulators, two insulators to each

set, placed at the corners of a square approximately eight
feet on a side. The sparkover strength of the insulators
is in the vicinity of one-half million volts. The plate which
supports the mast is electrically connected to the steel
structure of the Cathedral by means of 32 boron-carbide
resistance rods which give a resultant resistance of about
one-half ohm.

Some type of measuring device that required little
maintenance and was inexpensive to build and install
was required. It was also desirable that this device provide
its own power. The kine-klydonograph was developed to
ﬁt the requirements.

Three kine—klydonograph recorders are used to deter~
mine the magnitude and time variation of the magnitude
of the lightning strokes. Its operating principle is the
fact that electricity travels with a finite speed. The basic
idea of this instrument is that if a voltage of fast changing
magnitude (in the order of kilovolts per microseconds in
this case), is applied to a long length of cable, there exists,
between one end and the other, a potential difference,
provided the cable is of sufficient length. This fact is
put to use in the kine-klydonograph by connecting the
mast directly to a long coil of subminiature coaxial cable.
The beginning of the cable is connected to a plate to
which a photographic film is attached. At '34 foot inter-
vals electrodes are fastened to the coil and the tips are
held a short distance from the plate. (The plate is of
negligible length compared to the length of the wire.)
There are eight such electrodes on the length of the coil.
The propagation velocity of the voltage in the coaxial
cable is approximately 680 feet per microsecond so that
a voltage applied to the beginning of the coil appears at
the ﬁrst electrode 005 microseconds later. This is the time
displacement. The displacement from the beginning to
the end of the 272 ft. cable would be 0.4 microseconds.

THE LIGHTNING RESEARCH INSTALLATION is atop the Cathedral
of Learning. The man is holding a kine-klydonograph.

When a potential difference, due to a disp.lacement of
the time varying voltage, arises between the electrode and
plate, ﬁgures are formed on the ﬁlm. The magnitude and
direction of the potential is recorded by the size and shape
of the ﬁgures. Such a ﬁlm is called a kine-klydonogram
and the ﬁgures formed are Lichtenberg ﬁgures. A ninth
electrode records total potential difference. By interpreta-
tion of the nine ﬁgures formed on the ﬁlm, the magnitude,
direction, and time variation of magnitude can be deter-
mined.

An example of this may help clarify the operation.
Suppose that a ‘ramp function’ of potential is applied to
the mast instantaneously. The ‘ramp function’ is a po-
tential function that starts at V.-:0 when t..—-:0 and in-
creases linearly until V—_—V1, and t_.—_t1, and then the
potential becomes a constant value. The potential of
electrodes number one through eight will follow this
function but displaced in time by a certain amount de-
pending on. its location on the coaxial cable. Electrode
number one will be displaced by 0.05 microseconds, num-
ber two will be displaced by 0.10 microseconds, and so
forth in sequence to electrode number eight which is

22

displaced by 0.40 microseconds. The potential difference
between the plate and an electrode would be shown on
a graph of voltage and on the vertical axis against time
on the horizontal axis as the vertical distance between
the voltage of the electrode and that of the plate. This
distance would depend on the slope of the potential
function from t=0 to it, As this slope increases the
potential difference would increase. When this potential
is first applied, the potential of the plate begins to in-
crease while the potential of the electrodes remains at
zero. The electrodes remain at zero potential until the
applied potential, displaced by the coaxial cable, reaches
the electrodes. Since the photographic ﬁlm registers the
maximum potential difference, the figures registered by
electrodes one through eight will increase in size. Elec-
trode number nine, which you will recall is grounded,
will register the total potential. By interpretation of fig-
ures one through eight the time rate of change or slope
of the potential function can be determined and figure
number nine will be used to determine the potential
at t:—:t1.

The potential difference in the first eight electrodes is
of very short duration. According to Mr. S. B. Griscom
of Westinghouse in a paper on the kine-klydonograph,
“In the course of testing the kine-klydonograph, some
testing was done to determine the 'minimum recording
time. Those tests indicated that its recording time is
less than 0.01 microseconds.”1

The example just cited was an extremely simple one
compared to those which actually take place in a light-
ning stroke.

You may now be asking, “V/Vhat happens if a stroke
reaches maximum amplitude in greater than 0.40 micro-
seconds and does not vary linearly? ‘Would the chart be
able to tell this?” The kine-klydonograph does have a
means of differentiating between these types of waves.
The answer lies in what is called the ‘Slow Response
Netw0rk’——almost identical to the ‘Fast Response Net-
work’ just mentioned. The ‘Slow Response Network’ must

"do the same thing as the ‘Fast Response Network’ except

that it is to have a longer time displacement, in order
to record waves that change more slowly. Because of
size and weight limitations it would be impractical to use
longer lengths of coaxial cable. The velocity of propaga-
tion in a transmission line is reduced because of the re-
actance of the long line. The reactance of a long length
of wire is simulated in this case by means of 2 millihenry
inductance coils and 500 microfarad capacitors between
each electrode. These components are equivalent to 680
feet of coaxial cable between each electrode. The time
displacement is then equal to 1.0 microsecond between
each electrode and a total of 8.0 microseconds for the
entire length. It would require 5,440 feet of coaxial cable
to do this. An entering section consisting of an 1880 ohm
resistor shunted by a ten millihenry coil is provided to
ﬁlter out any sharp changes in potential for the ‘Slow
Response Network.’

The name kine-klydonograph is a combination of My-
donogmph, a magnitude reading device, and kisne, mean-

ing time variation. It has a range of 3 to 20 kilovolts,
and by use of shunts, voltage dividers, and several instru-
ments the range is extended to about 6 to 240 kiloamperes.
Records of four different strokes have been obtained on
the Cathedral in the three years since the instruments
have been installed. This is slightly under the usual rate.

V/Vestinghouse has two smaller installations near Pitts-
burgh, one located on the \Vestinghouse L-Building in
East Pittsburgh and the other on the VVestinghouse Re-
search Laboratories in Churchill Boro. V/Vorking in
co-operation with ﬁve power companies, two of which
are local companies, V/Vest Penn Power Company and
Ohio Edison Company, there are a total of 80 instruments
similar to the kineklydonograph in service during the
summer months. The primary reason for doing this
work is to improve the reliability of. high voltage trans-
mission lines and secondarily, to reduce their cost for
a given reliability. Research of this type has been going
on in this country and abroad for at least 40 years.

The valuable information provided by these studies
has greatly increased the reliability of power transmission
as evidenced by the fact that transmission lines being
built today experience only one—tl1irtieth of the outages
from lightning as those of twenty-ﬁve years ago. This
is the practical reason for such research. However, it is
done with a scientiﬁc attitude. _

Despite the fact that much knowledge has been gained
from these studies there still remains much to be learned.
The manner i11 which a cloud becomes electrically charged
and the process of discharge are still highly controversial
topics. Since the accumulation of data on these subjects
is necessarily slow it will be some time until they are
fully understood.

By RALPH s. COOPER

Ralph S. Cooper of Los Alamos
Scientiﬁc Laboratory has brought to
the attention of the missile space in-
dustry an interesting document.

The historic paper, with Mr. C'oop-
er’s comments, was reproduced in the
form on an oﬂice memorandum on the
subject of “Scientiﬁc Review Commit-
tees.”

While it is well known that Colum-
bus made a vain appeal to the senate
of his native state of Genoa (as well
as to the King of Portugal, to Henry
III of England, and to the Dukes of
Medina Sedonia and Medina Celi),
it was not until very recently that the
full oﬁicial Genoan Senate reply came
to light. It was discovered, along with
other of his early documents and let-
ters, in a monastery library in south-
eastern Spain, and perhaps sheds some
light upon why Spain rather than
Italy was the dominant maritime and
colonial power in the 16th century.
A translation of the letter follows:
To: Cristobal Columbo
From: The Senate of Genoa

We the Senate of Genoa thank you,
dear countryman, sea captain, geog-
rapher, and adventurer, for your pre-
sentation before us of an ambitious
plan to open a new sea route to
Cathay. Being most impressed, but
untutored in the technical arts, we
assembled a committee of the ﬁnest
academic minds in our own and
neighboring states to examine and re-
view your proposal and make recom-
mendations upon our course of action.
We are most pleased with their in-
tellectual insight and broad under-
standing of the problem.

problems of the spiritual humour, in-
volving long periods of loneliness

leading to mutiny, for example.”

The committee included represent-
atives from the church (Msgr. Don-
ella), the government (Minister De
Stortzo), and the Bureau of Finance
(Sig. Barrata). These eminent gentle-
men discoursed at great length upon
the theological and political aspects
of such a project, and Sig. Barrata
most wisely pointed.out that one
must compare the development and
operational costs, of this uncertain
method of reaching Cathay with cost
of improving the well—established Polo
overland route. Indeed, he observed
that one could pave the entire route
with Florentine tile for the price of
one round trip sea voyage. Neverthe-
less, these are properous times and
the enthusiasm of the scientiﬁc mem-
bers of the committe was undamp-
ened. Thus their recommendations
were as follows:

1. Study programs be initiated to

2. When they are solved, a series
of unmanned, instrumented vehicles
be sent to Cathay, the ﬁnal ones carry-
ing animals and instructions for set-
ting them upon the return route.

conceived the trip, you are unlikely
to possess that exact mixture of at-

I/Ve feel you will be quite pleased
with the output of this progressive,
forward looking committee of pro-
found scholars. Incidentally, there
was one additional member of the
committee, a rather rash and impetu-
ous young mechanical engineer, lately
of Florence, who was sent in place of
ailing Dr. Taglatti of the University
of Milan. Though he came highly
recommended, he showed his imma-
turity and poor judgment by advo-
cating the voyage itself be initiated
immediately. Investigation proved
him to be quite eccentric (he talks of
flying machines and fancies himself
an artist), and he was therefore dis-
missed from the committee. He is the
illegitimate son of a Florentine notary
and takes his name from the place of
his birth, Vinci, Leonardo being his
given name, should you desire to con-
tact him.

Edward M. Davis, Jr. (B.S.E.E., Carnegie Tech '55; M.S.,
Cal Tech ’56; Ph.D., Stanford '58) is directing micro-elec-
tronic device development at lBM’s Poughkeepsie, New
York Laboratories.

DR. DAVIS AND MICRD-DEVICES

When Dr. Edward M. Davis was working for his bachelor's
degree, miniaturization was a novelty. Today, with the tran-
sistor and the printed circuit commonplace, micro-miniatur.
ization is one of the newest challenges in electronics. Ed
Davis is helping to meet that challenge.

Today's computeroperationstakeonly millionthsofa second;
tomorrow's may accelerate to billionths. In a billionth of a
second, however, even light can travel only about a foot, and
the physical size ofan electronic circuitmayslowits operation
critical|y.The answer is in micro-electronics where complete
circuitsare packaged on minusculesubstrates,andeachtran-
sistor may occupy less than a thousandth of a square inch.

Since early in 1961, Ed Davis has been in charge of an IBM
engineering project exploring the parameters of advanced

' micro-devices. His work mayverywell helpestablish thetech-

nology of future computers. Equally important, he and his
colleagues are already gathering significant knowledge in
the advanced study of solid state electronics.

A basic approach is encouraged at lBM.Whether in research,
development, manufacturing, or programming, the IBM sci-
entist and engineer are encouraged to go to the heart of the
problem.The|BM representativeinterviewingonyourcampus

SOME IMPORTANT
NEW JOBS
WERE CREATED
BY DU PONT
TODAY

   

JANUARY 1962

The development of new products always leads to
challenging new opportunities at Du Pont. Products
like time—honored neoprene synthetic rubber, for ex-
ample. Or more recently, “De|rin”* acetal resin for
a wide range of plastic applications, and “Cronaflex”*
engineering reproduction films.

Products like these have created thousands and
thousands of jobs at DuPont over the years. Good
jobs that not only contribute to the growth of the com-
pany, but assure Du Pont’s employees of steady em-
ployment and the chance to progress. To keep these
jobs coming in the future, Du Pont’s annual invest-
ment in research exceeds $90 million.

Right now, there are opportunities at Du Pont for
qualified engineers—chemical, mechanical, electrical,
metallurgical and industria|—chemists and physicists,
sales and marketing men. If you expect to receive
your bachelor's, master's, or Ph.D. degree this year,

“Well, son,” he replied, “it’s this
way. If you walk into a bathroom to

research and development program being conducted
by an industry team of Garrett, Aerojet-General
Nucleonics (reactor) and Westinghouse, Lima

300-1000KW electrical power in space for one year or
more. Power is obtained by conversion of nuclear

power and low thrust electrical propul-
sion in space for long periods of time.

Cutting projected 1 MW power sys-
tems to 1/10th the size and 1/5th the
weight of present power systems under
development will be possible because
of SPUR’s capability to operate at
higher temperatures, thereby sharply
reducing the required radiator area.

Garrett has been working with the
Air Force and the Atomic Energy
Commission on SPUR as the prime

contractor for more than one year and
has more than ﬁve years of experience
in space nuclear power development.
Also an industry leader in high speed
rotating machinery, heat transfer

power systems, the company is devel-
oping design solutions for SPUR in
these critical component system areas.

One use for an
artificial duck

On Sunday evening, September 24th,
a new associate of ours named Walt
Disney broadcast from 168 TV stations
a ﬁlm called “Mathmagicland.” It
featured an artiﬁcial duck he owns
named Donald. The ﬁlm illustrated the
mathematical unity of nature and man,
while the duck quacked in order to
reassure 20,000,000 viewers that there
is no harm in such a discussion.

Lots of kids who were too young for
it will be ready next fall. Movies can
teach conic sections as easily as pie-
throwing. Movie-makers with lesser
resources than Disney can also teach
laudably. What bothers the classroom
teacher about 16mm movies is how to
get the one she wants when she wants
it instead of seven weeks later. Nobody
is to blame. The can of ﬁlm has too
many classes to visit, but relief is on
the way.

Enter the Kodak Sound 6’ Projector. It
projects 8mm movies with commentary
from a magnetic stripe on the ﬁlm.

The greatly reduced cost and bulk
of 8mm ﬁlm and equipment got home
movies off the ground. The improve-
ment of sharpness and color in the
8mm Kodachrome II Film introduced
last year is making movies really soar
as entertainment in the home. In the
schoolroom 8mm sound movies can be
expected to simulate the effect of the
paperback on the book business. The
teacher will be able to handle a teach-
ing ﬁlm more like a weekly magazine
and less like a shipment of gold bullion.

A sharp eye
for infrared

The decision to announcef/1 Irtran-2
Asplzeric Lenses has been reached in
struggle against inhibitions. In the
photographic trade we are habituated
to a longer silence before the first blast
of the trumpets. Infrared technology
hates to wait, however.

These lenses transmit usefully from
2p. to 14,11. Three focal lengths, 1-inch,
2-inch and 3-inch, are offered off the
shelf. Atf/1, we seem to have done
well at providing high collecting—power
for energy without undue sacriﬁce of
sharpness. Sharpness was the goal. For
all the lenses, the minimum circle of
confusion computes at less than .001"
for any wavelength from 4.25;). to 10p..
Note italics.

In the 2p.-3,11. region, the sharpness
does not compute to be as good as
farther out in the infrared. Yet we
have customers who use the lenses
there and are happy with confusion-
circle minima as large as .008”.

In comparison with reﬂective optics
hitherto used, Irtran-2 aspheres offer
compactness and a wider ﬁeld that
doesn’t even show appreciable deteri-
oration as far as 2° off axis. You do give
up the perfect achromatism of mirrors.

These remarks can be interpreted as
a blatant offer here and now to sell these
lenses for cash. (Address inquiries to
Eastman Kodak Co., Special Products
Division, Rochester 4, N.Y.) Irtran-2
material resists water and common
organic solvents. It retains infrared
transparency at high temperature.

The can-boxamide way
to solvaiion

The joy that philosophers once felt in
considering an irresistible force acting
against an immovable object is as
nothing to the joy of the peddler who
carries in his pack both an inorganic
substance that resists common organic
solvents (see left) and a solvent which
dissolves inorganic substances which
common solvents fail to dissolve.

$2.75 buys from Distillation Products
Industries (a division of ours), Roches-
ter 3, N. Y. 5 grams of JV,N-Dimethyl-
benzamz'o’e. This comes as white crystals
that melt at 42°C. It is a new member
of a class of compounds of uncanny
solvent power for high polymers,
organometallics, and inorganics.

Solvation virtually demands the
liquid state. Solubility also usually rises
with temperature. Without the trouble
and peril of high-pressure tactics,
N,N-dimethylbenzamide can be main-
tained as a much hotter liquid than its
cousins. It doesn’t boil until 272°C, as
compared with 152°C for N,N-di-
methylformamide and 165°C for N,N-
dimethylacetamide. judged from some
of the 17 other N -substituted carboxa-
mides to be found among some 3900
Eastman Organic Chemicals we sell for
research, it is probably a swell solvent.
(Whether it dissolves Irtran—2 material,
nobody yet cares.)

Note: Whether you work for us or not,
photography in some form will probably
have a part in your work as years go on.
Now or later, feel free to ask for Kodak
literature or help on anything photographic.

Chemistry paints a. bright future

The ﬁnish on new cars is as tough as it is beautiful. Chemicals
developed through research at Union Carbide have played an important part
in achieving smooth, hard mirror—bright coatings that last for years.

Chemicals and plastics have also caused a revolution in other types
of paints and ﬁnishes in recent years. The result‘? Water—base latex paints
that dry in minutes have turned a time-consuming chore into a simple job
for any homeowner. Special solvents assure the uniform surface required in
the ﬁnishing of ﬁne furniture. And many new chemical materials are going
into coatings to safeguard industrial equipment from moisture and corrosive
fumes . . . and to protect ships from the ravages of salt Water.

This is an example of a vital industry that has forged ahead
because of the kind of chemical research that goes on at Union Carbide.
Looking to the future, the people of Union Carbide are continuing their
efforts to bring forth new and better materials for everyday living.

Interview with General .EIectric’s Dr. I. H. Hallaman
  Manager—GeneraI Engineering Laboratory

ow

Q. Dr. Hollomon, what characterizes
the new needs and wants of society?

A. There are four signiﬁcant changes
in recent times that characterize these
needs and wants.

1. The increases in the number of
people who live in cities: the accom-
panying need is for adequate control
of air pollution, elimination of trans-
portation bottlenecks, slum clearance,
and adequate water resources.

2. The shift in our economy from agri-
culture and manufacturing to “serv-
ices”: today less than half our working
population produces the food and goods
for the remainder. Education, health,
and recreation are new needs. They
require a new information technology
to eliminate the drudgery of routine
mental tasks as our electrical tech-
nology eliminated routine physical
drudgery.

3. The continued need for national
defense and for arms reduction: the
majority of our technical resources
is concerned with research and devel-
opment for military purposes. But
increasingly, we must look to new tech-
nical means for detection and control.

4«. The arising expectations of the peo-
ples of the newly developing nations:
here the “haves” of our society must
provide the industry and the tools for the
“have-nots” of the new countries if they
are to share the advantages of mod-
ern technology. It is now clearly recog-
nized by all that Western technology is
capable of furnishing the material
goods of modern life to the billions
of people of the world rather than
only to the millions in the West.

We see in these new wants, prospects
for General Electric’s future growth
and contribution.

Q. Could you give us some examples?

A. We are investigating techniques for
the control and measurement of air and
water pollution which will be appli-
cable not only to cities, but to individual
households. We have developed, for

One of a series . . .

Society Has New Needs
and Wants—Plan Your
Career Accordingly

DR. HOLLOMON is responsible for General Electric’s centralized, advanced engineering
activities. He is also an adiunct professor of metallurgy at RPI, serves in advisory posts
for four universities, and is a member of the Technical Assistance panel of President
Kennedy's Scientific Advisory Committee. Long interested in emphasizing new areas of oppor-
tunity for engineers and scientists, the following highlights some of Dr. Hollomon’s opinions.

example, new methods of purifying
salt water and specific techniques for
determining impurities in polluted air.
General Electric is increasing its inter-
national business by furnishing power
generating and transportation equip-
ment for Africa, South America, and
Southern Asia.

We are looking for other products
that would be helpful to these areas to
develop their economy and to improve
their way of life. We can develop new
information systems, new ways of stor-
ing and retrieving information, or
handling it in computers. We can
design new devices that do some of the
thinking functions of men, that will
make education more effective and per-
haps contribute substantially to reducing
the cost of medical treatment. We can
design new devices for more efficient
“paper handling” in the service
industries.

-Q. If I want to be a part of this new
activity, how should I plan my career?

A. First of all, recognize that the
meeting of needs and wants of society
with products and services is most
important and satisfying work. Today
this activity requires not only knowl-
edge of science and technology but
also of economics, sociology and the
best of the past as learned from the
liberal arts. To do the engineering
involved requires, at least for young
men, the most varied experience possi-
ble. This means working at a number
of different jobs involving different
science and technology and different
products. This kind of experience for
engineers is one of the best means of
learning how to conceive and design
—how to be able to meet the changing
requirements of the times.

For scientists, look to those new fields
in biology, biophysics, information, and
power generation that afford the most
challenge in understanding the world
in which we live.

But above all else, the science explo-
sion of the last several decades means
that the tools you will use as an engi-
neer or as a scientist and the knowledge
involved will change during your life-
time. Thus, you must be in a position
to continue your education, either on
your own or in courses at universities
or in special courses sponsored by
the company for which you work.

Q. Does General Electric offer these
advantages to a young scientist or
engineer?

A. General Electric is a large diver-
siﬁed company in which young men
have the opportunity of working on a
variety of problems with experienced
people at the forefront of science and
technology. There are a number of
laboratories where research and ad-
vanced development is and has been
traditional. The Company offers incen-
tives for graduate studies, as well as
a number of educational programs
with expert and experienced teachers.
Talk to your placement officers and
members of your faculty. I hope you
will plan to meet our representative
when he visits the campus.

Mass spectrometer—10,000 chemical analyses every second.
A valuable tool for fast analysis of gases, liquids, solids, and
plasma, the Bendix® Mass Spectrometer is another dramatic
result of Bendix teamwork. Physicists, engineers, chemists—all
contributed to the development of this first successful time-of-
flight mass spectrometer.

Based on the patented Bendix time—of—flight principle, the
Bendix Mass Spectrometer uses pulsed electron beam to create
ions which are immediately accelerated into a field-free region.
Here, ions separate according to their mass-to—charge ratios.These
separated ion signals are then amplified in the electron multiplier
and fed to an oscilloscope, whose sweep is synchronized to the
spectrometer frequency. As many as 10,000 complete mass
spectra are presented each second, making the Bendix Mass
Spectrometer ideal for applications requiring extremely rapid
response.

Two other developments resulted from this work. One is a

A Message

By W. R. Turkes

Assoc. Dean

Tlie educational objective of most students registered
in engineering is the earning of a bachelor of science de-
gree in a chosen ﬁeld. For many this is a sensible, attain-
able goal and leads to happy, rewarding, engineering em-
ployment. If this has been your objective, it is recom-
mended that a re—examination of your educational plans
and career goals be made "during your junior and senior
years. Career plans may have changed and now require
graduate study for adequate preparation. Regardless of
what the plans may be, some continued study, either for-
mal, or informal, should be anticipated. The rate of
scientiﬁc discovery and engineering advancement results
in the rapid obsolescence of an engineering education if
it is not maintained by continued study. If the desire for
lifelong study and learning is not developed in an under-
graduate education, the professional growth of an engi-
neer is likely to be subject to severe limitations.

In undergraduate engineering curricula today, the pres-
sures for more mathematics, science, humanities, and social
science courses have resulted in a reduction of the time
available for engineering courses. Departmental speciliza-
tion often equals only about one-fourth of the total of
the undergraduate educational program required for grad-
uation. An additional year of study leading to the master
of science degree will add greatly to an engineer’s com-
petence and earning capacity.

The decision to pursue graduate study can be a stimu-
lating, rewarding experience leading to a greatly en-
hanced career satisfaction and an enlarged engineering
horizon. Advanced degrees for engineers may be either
research or application and development oriented depend-
ing upon the content and design of the graduate program.

Engineering students who are considering careers in
teaching and research will ﬁnd graduate study leading to
the doctorate degree a real advantage and frequently es-
sential for success in these professional endeavors. The

JANUARY 1962

doctor's degree will generally be the Doctor of Philosophy
(Ph.D.), or it may be the Doctor of Science (Sc.D.), or,
possibly, the Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.). The earning
of the doctor’s degree requires a minimum of three years
of full-time study after the bachelor’s degree. There is a
deﬁnite advantage to full-time graduate study in residence,
or resident graduate study combined with teaching or re-
search experience in the engineering department of grad-
uate registration. Opportunity also exists for part-time
graduate study and full-time engineering employment in
industry.

The problem of ﬁnancing graduate study may necessi-
tate full-time engineering employment and part-time grad-
uate study or the delay of further formal education until
the necessary funds are accumulated. A delay of graduate
study should only be undertaken after all other means
have been exhausted. Rising educational costs should not
prevent talented engineering graduates from continuing
their education. All too frequently a short delay in be-
ginning graduate study becomes permanent because of
added family and ﬁnancial responsibilities acquired in the
delay interval. For a dedicated student willing to accept
some sacriﬁces, a means of ﬁnancing graduate study can
usually be found. Graduate fellowships, scholarships, as-
sistantships, and loans are available in many forms and
amounts and should be investigated thoroughly.

There is substantial evidence that in the next decade
the demand for engineers with doctorate degrees will
equal today's demand for engineers with masters’ degrees.
By then, the master’s degree may have replaced the bache-
lor’s degree for engineers who plan routine careers in en-
gineering employment. Career plans for engineering stu-
dents and recent graduates should not drift haphazardly.

Continued and adequate engineering professional de-
velopment is an individual responsibility. Do not neg-
lect it.
