Ernst Mach...on ahsolutes

“No one is competent to assert things about abso-
lute space and absolute motion: they are pure
matters of thought that cannot be produced in
experience. All our principles of mechanics, as we
have shown in detail, are experienced lmowledge
concerning the relative positions and motions of
bodies. They could not be. and were not, admitted

in the areas in which they are now recognized as
valid, without previous testing. No one is war-
ranted in extending these principles beyond the
boundaries of experience. In fact, such an exten-
sion is meaningless, as no one would possess the
knowledge to make use of it."

SELECTING YOUR
LECTIVES

MARCH 1958

G. R. Fitterer

Engineers at Pitt are privileged to be attending a
large University which offers them an almost unlimited
opportunity to take co-urses in the Liberal "Arts.

It is an all too common tendency on the part
of engineering students to avoid the’ Liberal Arts
courses. For this reason, the accrediting body for engi-
neering schools, i.e., the Engineers’ Council for Profes-
sional Development, has insisted since 1935 that at
least 20 per cent of all engineering curricula shall be
Liberal Arts and Humanities subjects. It has been
found that many excellent engineers could not ex-
press themselves and often failed to advance in their
work for this reason alone. They were inarticulate and
were inclined to resist any one who could express his
thoughts clearly. It was unusual for an engineer to
write a good report which was well organized and
cle-arly expressed.

Several years ago the Schools of Engineering and
Mines inaugurated a new program which is outlined in
our Bulletin and which should be reviewed by every
engineering student. Because of their importance, the
courses are listed herewith in the hope that each stu-
dent will intelligently select his elective courses from
at least three of the groups. I

AUDITORIUM OF THE FUTURE

Several years ago, the Lower H-ill district of Pitts-
bu-rgh was a part of the city’s -big problem of slum
clearance. By the year 1961 this area is expected to
-be a center of culture and entertainment at which
the main feature will be a twenty million dollar, 12-
stories high, Civic Auditorium. Today, we ﬁnd this
area in neither of the extreme conditions. Instead, the
area paints a picture of Pittsburgh’s redevelopment.

In its early stage-s, the idea of the civic center
-developed into the proposal of a multi-purpose arena
with several unique features, including a retractable
dome roof. As is true in most projects of this nature,
Edward F raher, Executive Director of the Civic Au-
ditorium Authority, found that the project was high-
ly supported verbally by various local concerns, but
the highlyimportan-t ﬁnancial backing posed a prob-
lem. From this problem rose a fund raising campaign.
In early 1956, when the program of fund-raising be-
gan, the cost estimates were ranging around four-
teen million doll-ars. At one of the initial meetings,
the Auditorium Building Fund collection proved to
be quite success-ful, having collected a million and
a half dollars toward their immediate goal of two and
a half million. Most of this money was provided -by
foundations and corporations.

The costs of the roof were the -ﬁrst problem. The
proposed retractable roof was estimated to cost two
and one quarter million dollars more than a ﬁxed

roof of the same diameter. Officials began discussing
the possibility of not using the retractable roof. But
in April, both city and -county officials approved the
inclusion of the movable -roof, a great deal of the de-
cision resting on the fact that this roof would be the
ﬁrst of its kind in the world. Thus, the auditorium
would be a feather in Pittsburgh’s hat.

The other problem formed around rising con-
struction costs and land prices. The estimated cost
jumped to twenty million, and the total cost, includ-
ing the cost of purchasing the land, jumped to twen-
ty-eight million. Thi-s problem was studie-d, and the
decision made that progress, should continue just as
previously planned.

After the property was o-bt-ained, the demolition’

crews moved in on March 1957, and the 266 struc-
tures were razed by the end of September. The ground-
breaking was then scheduled for late spring. The
contracts had to be presented to bidders and 62 bid-
ders looked over plans in order to bid for contracts
in eight catagoriesr‘ general, plumbing, heating, venti-
lating and air conditioning, main roof, mechanics of
roof, seats, and lawn, and landscape.

The Civic Auditorium will not only be one of the

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

ﬁnest indoor arenas but will also be able to be convert-
ed into a spacious, outdoor fresh-air stadium at the
ﬂip of a switch. It will provide an excellent place for
holding -sporting events, conventions, an-d exhibits.
Pittsburgh will then be a-ble to bid for many more con-
ventions, which should boost income by six million
dollars a year. It would be a center for educational,
cultural, and recreational activities. This would be
a place for symphonies, operas, and the Pittsburgh
Civic Light Opera. Stage shows, boxing, basketball,
hockey, and some other athletic events could be held
there.

Three events could be going on at once: -sports or
other entertainment in the main arena, a convention
a-n-d ex-hibits, and a large meeting in one of the meet-
in.g rooms. It would also provide some opportunities
to use closed—circuit television effectively. This would
provide an opening for coverage of Broadway shows and
sporting events in the future. The Auditorium Author-
ity is not interested in a cheap structure, “a cinder
block skating rink” as Mr. Fraher would call it.
Rather, all attempts are being made to make it as
multi-purpose as possible.

“We’ll be able to handle everything Madison
Square Garden does, and then sorne,” says Mr. Fra-
her. Some other things that could be ‘handled are cir-
cu-ses; house and garden shows; automobile, boating,
and sporting events; and religious programs such as
Easter Sunrise Services.

The building itself will cover four acres. Its ex-
terior will be in the shape of a hemisphere support-
ed by a cantilever. The center pivot will be 145 feet
from the ﬂoor. Stainless steel or aluminum will serve
as the exterior’s skin. For the dome’s interior, per-
forated, baked enamel panels with a three-i-nch, ﬁber-
glass, acoustic blanket are planned.

The hemispherical roof will have a 415-foot dia-
meter and will contain 2,950 tons of steel. The brac-
ing arm 171/2 feet thick and t-hree feet across, will
weigh 1,100 tons. It will consist of eight sections, six

of them movable. The idea was conceived by Mitchell
and Rit-chey, Pittsburgh architects.

Although s‘ome of the best engineers in the coun-
try will guarantee that the roof will work every time,
it cannot be -considered to be a toy to be opened and
closed all the time. It could be opened against a 60
m—.p.h. wind in less than three minutes, and it would
take a sudden storm to dampen customers. Each of the
six movable sections will be powered by its own 100
horsepower motor and will have automatic brakes in
case of power failure.

The three-foot thick, 260-ton sections will travel
on 30-inch railroad wheels planted on heavy duty
track circling the arena. The sections farthest away
would travel about 240 feet per minute. The con-
trols will be in a seperate control room, but there
will also be individual controls under the stands.
When closed, the leaves will be scaled by synthetic
rubber, but safety gutters inside will protect against
leaks.

Permanent seats will be provided for 9280 spec-
tators plus 1340 -seats ﬁxed on telescopic stands. One
750-seat section will be raised by hydraulic lifts to un-
cover a stage and orchestra pit. This stage would be
116 by 66 feet. The sound system, lights, and cur-
tains for the stage would be on the underside of the
seat section. This is one of its unique features.

A high pressure combined heating and air con-
ditioning system will be at work in all public spaces.
The arena will have an unusual weather feature, that
of creating its own weather like a dirigible hangar.
The ventilating system will prevent rain from falling
while the dome is closed. These showers would be the
result if moist air were to rise from the floor and cool
against the roof causing condensation.

These are the main features of the auditorium.

Completion is expected by 1960, and in 1961 Pitts-
burgh will have a Civic Auditorium to be proud of
—one which contributes to the educational, cultural,
and recreational development of this area. I

Cultivation of these microscopic plants

As the world’s population continues its steady
climb, scientiﬁc personnel and engineers are conducting
a relentless search for abundant, more nutr-itional, and
less expensive food. By the utilization of solar energy
for the “agriculture” of algae, they believe they have
found one such food.

Algae is a microscopic plant which turns sunlight,
carbon dioxide, inorganic nitrogen compounds, and
water into food energy. Its ma-chine-like performance
as an energy converter accumula-tes carbon, nitrogen,
and inorganic salts and converts the kinetic energy
of light into potential chemical energy.

Since solar radiation is used as the energy source
for growing algae, the algal cultures will ‘be subject
to changes of environmental -conditions, such a-s ﬂu-ctua-
tions of temperature, light intensity, and recurrence of
rainy and .dry weather. Provided solar energy, carbon
dioxide, and nutrient salts are available in sufficient
quantities, the requirements to be met for the algal cul-
ture masses are:

1. Maintenance of adequate temperature.

2. The construction of cultural units which will

withstand any adverse weather conditions.

3. The prevention of contaminating micro-organ-

isms which are harmful to algae.

4. And last, ’but not least, the low cost construc-

tion of manufacturing plants.

Algae must be grown in a dilute salt solution, con-
taining ﬁxed nitrogen. The concentrations can be ad-

justed to give rates of growth of algae far greater than
experienced in nature. -Carbon dioxide is the major
material requirement. One pound of algae requires
1.8 pounds of carbon dioxide. If air were used as the
source, it would take 432 pounds to make a pound of
-algae. As a result, air must be enriched with carbon
dioxide to provide the system with am-ple amounts
Temperature control becomes a problem because
algae suspensions exposed to direct sunlight must dis-
sipate considerable heat. In certain systems it mig-ht be
necessary to provide special cooling devices in order
to keep the temperature below 100 degrees Fahren-
heit. A particular type o-f algae, -Chlorella, is killed
by a temperature above 85 degrees Fah-renheit.
Light is by far the most important «factor in algal
growth. The spectral response is fairly broad, corres-
ponding closely to the visible «region of 4,000 t-o 7,000
Angstroms. About 40 percent of solar radiation at
the earth’s surface is available for photosynthesis and
algal growth. Efficiency of algae growth or solar
energy conversion is based on annual usable solar out-
put. Some efficiency rates have been obtained -which
range from 18 to 24 percent under favorable nutrient

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

conditions. These are based on over-all efficiency of
the synthesis of algal material. In quantitative terms,
20 percent efficiency indicates that every dry gram
of Chlorella, worth 5.8 kilocalories of energy, requires
29 kilocalories of absorbed light energy. If efficiencies
were based on whole spectrum output, only about 8
percent would be used.

Two methods of mass culturing of algae have
proved feasible and workable on a pre-pilot-plant
scale. One is the “closed circulation method” in which
the culture was circulated either in a lucid plastic tube,
-or in a shallow concrete trench covered ‘with a -plastic
ceiling. Experimental units were set up that were made
of vinyl sheeting and had an area of illumi-nation of
15 square meters. Carbon dioxide enriched air was
use-d at the rate of 25 to 50 liters per minute per ton of
culture. The major drawbacks of this system were
the vinyl sheeting became brittle within several months
and the plastic tubing was not stable in strong winds.
These -systems also required cooling devices.

The -other system developed was the “open bub-
bling system.” Units generally were in the shape of
ponds. Plastic pipes were placed between -them to
circulate enriched air at a rate of 250 liters per minute
per ton of culture. The area of illumination was about
2.5 to 5.5 square meters.

A particular type of -design for an open bubbling
systeml has proved quite effective. (See Figure 1.) This

Figure 1. This open bubbling system for the mass cultur-
cultur-ing of algae has proved quite effective.

pond requires small amounts of energy to circulate
the cultu-re and supply the carbon dioxide. It also pre-
vents precipitation of the algae on the bottom. There
are no cooling systems required such as in the closed
system. The rotor mixes the culture when new seeding
of algae is necessary. The initial cost of construction
seems to be the only major draw-back.

In comparing the two systems, the open bubbling
system proved to be more durable and required one-

MARCH 1958

  

ﬁfth of the power to operate. It did, however, require
5 to 10 times the amount of enriched air. In both sys-
tems, standard types of equipment are employed in
growing and harvesting equipment: centrifugal pumps,
heat exchangers, centrifuges, and stainless steel and
plastic piping.

According to estimates made by Arthur D. Little,
Inc., the cost of construction of the growth area of the
closed circulation system is about $18,400 per acre.
This estimate includes only a cooling system and not
a harvesting apparatus or mai-n system for gas or
nutrient supply. If the open bubbling system was con-
structed of concrete, a corresponding cost is estimated
at about $38,000 per acre. The cost would -be consider-
ably reduced if the units were made of earth covered
with plastic sheeting. These plants would produce
from 25 to 35 tons per day at a cost of about 25
cents per pound of dry product.

The price per pound is slightly less than that of
conventional food of equivalent protein quantity. Al-
gae, however, has decisive advantages over other food.
For -instance, the annual yield of food by algae is appre-
ciably higher per unit area than for conventional crops.
Algae are higher in protein, fat, an-d vitamin content
than vegetable sources with the exception of a
few seed products and yeast. All solar energy absorbed
a-nd used for growth goes into the production of use-
ful material for food. There are no waste products
such as roots, stalks or leaves. Algae can be grown in
otherwise useless areas and are adaptable to what can
be called “the process in-dustry ap-proach”_through
efficient operation techniques including continuous cul-
ture.

When the economics of producing it are solved,
individuals must decide whether they will accept algae
as a -foo-d. Algae, in the raw, tastes like seaweed, per-
haps a little worse. It would go under the heading of
“ﬁt for human consumption.” Algae will not be found
on the menu ten years from now—at least -not as
“algae a la carte.”

Today algae are becoming a most promising source
of food in Japan. Consequently, most of the research
is being carried on at that location. Experiments with
human food have shown promise. Even now, algae has
limited use in such foods as soups, candies, cakes, "sweets
drink-s, and it is even put into a green vanilla -ice cream.
Other possibilities in the algae picture as yet unexplor-
ed, are the production of special protien materials,
medicinal products, dietary supplements, and special
chemicals. Algae, as food for -animals, presents great
possibi-lities since there are no psychological problems
of acceptability.

The research in algae is only beginning. Its need
is apparent. Many statistical analyses have been made
of population growth and food needs of t-he world over
the next 50 to 100 years. All indicate that we can
safely assume the best present agricultural met'hods
on available land will not suffice. Therefore, any new
source of nutritional material for humans and animals
is worth consideration. I

AN APPROACH TO
SCIENTIFIC WRITING

Make your scientific knowledge

BY DANIEL MARDER

The scientist or engineer who lived ﬁve thousand
years ago might have reported his investigations by
talking about them t-o his apprentices, his tribesmen,
his magistrates. In terms that could be understood by
his live audience, he probably explained the shapes
and forces, -the muscles and materials which h-e brought
together in order to build or discover something of
value to his society.

When writing became widespread, this kind of
information was put into a more permanent form and
communicated across the barriers of time and distance.
He wrote a letter. During the industrial revolution,
the: personal letter succumbed to the objective approach
of expanding technology, and the factual report re-
placed the letter.

In the first stages of this new era, written com-
munication was largely in the form of operating in-
structions, time schedules, and work orders. The engi-
neer and the scientist might have escaped into some
laboratory corner. But the strides of technology across
the twentieth century -have invaded every nook and
cranny of industry and government. Now in the vast
intercomplexities of our te'chnological society, a syn-
t'hesis of knowledge and skills from an array of di-
vergent ﬁelds is necessary before anything new is pro-
duced. Industry and government must have effective
communication between men whose work ranges
through research, development, and production. Men
with a variety of specializations and education must
be able to understand one another. The man of tech-
nology may de-sign a new power plant or frame a new
theory, but his work can only be utilized through the
art of communication.

The work of a scientist or engineer must be re-
corded for the understanding of others, and the written
record is all that remains as testimony of his work after
the experimental and testing structures have been
disassembled. The written record is the end product,
the enduring pro-of that something has be'en uncovered
and offered for the use of society. Though his central
purpose is to investigate nature and build upon it, the
engineer or the scientist must also be a writer.

Writing is a craft to be mastered, not a science to
be learned. T-he rules are given in textbooks, these‘
need constant revision; the examples are offered by our
ﬁnest authors, these need constant study. But the mas-

MARCH 1958

available to others through
more effective writing.

tery is in the experience and this needs constant prac-
tice. By experiencing his own trials and errors, by
knowing the rules and the applications the -best writers

make of them, the man of technology develops the

most important facility for writing—the critical sense.
It tells him, like a gauge, when the writing is bad and
what is bad about it, and the developing ability as a
craftsman enables him to do the things which change
the writing from bad to good.

The critical sense he develops also has a direct
bearing on his laboratory work. To write effectively,
the author must take time to review what he has ac-
complished. As a result, he attains a detached point
of vie-w which may reveal inadequacies and inaccura-
cies in his work. Bottlenecks also show up in the writ-
ing. If the work cannot be communicated logically
and clearly, then the subject itself may not be clear
enough to the ‘writer. Re-examination often reveals ob-
scurities and inconsistencies and perhaps deeper prob-
lems which should have been at-tacked before the in-
vestigator proceeded to his conclusion. The very act
of organizing the work for communication assures a
critical view of the whole and serves as a check on its
validity and value.

The common denominator between the craft of
writing and the method of science is logic. There are
tricks and skills to be mastered as in other aspects of
any technological ﬁeld, but the technical writer -has
already been trained in the discipline of science; al-
ready he has formed the habit of logical thinking.
Writing is an extension and new application of this
habit.

In any kind of discourse, the writer has a central
purpose, a main intention. He may wish to change an
attitude, to render an experience, to relate an event,
or to inform the reader. These four main intentions
correspond to the four basic types of discourse: Argu-
ment, Description, Narration, an-d Exposition.

When the writer’s main intention is to work a
change in the reader, he will appeal to the emotion and
the powers of logic at the same time. The discourse is
argumentative.

When the main intention is to render an experi-
ence, the writer will try to make the reader perceive
something, to get the feel of it——a cat walking down
an alley or the arrangement of an experiment. The

21

discourse is descriptive.

When -he wishes to relate an event—what happen-
ed, how it happened—— the author will indicate how one
thing led to another in a time sequence. His major con-
cern will be to give an “immediate impression of -the
event, a sense of witnessing it. The discourse is narra-
tive.

When the central purpose is to inform the reade'r,
to explain, to make clear an idea, deﬁne, direct, the
discourse is expository.

These types of discourse are not arbitrary divi-
sions; each tells us of a fundamental wish on t-he part
of the writer, each fulﬁlls an actual need. The main
intention of the scientist or engineer is to give informa-
tion, to explain and, therefore, exposition is the type
of discourse which suits his need.

None of the forms of discourse ever occurs in the
pure state. The novelist’s main intention is narration,
but exposition, description, and argument are all in
his bailiwick and he uses them as tools to aid the pro-
cess of narration. The technical wr~iter’s primary pur-
pose is to inform, and -he uses the other types of dis-
course as tools to aid his exposition. He may use nar-
ration to give the movement of events in an experi-
ment or test, or he may use description to give the
reader a sense of the mechanism or the process he is
explaining. He may use argument in summing up, but
this leads to danger unless he is so adept that his writ-
ing techniques are not detected.

Technical exposition differs from other kinds of
informative writing because technical language and
quantitative statement are employed.

If we go back far enough, English becomes a foreign
language to us. The form.s and meanings of words are
no longer recognized. Some of the words were obsolete
——fain, wont——these are no longer in use. Other word.s
are disappearing from use—'betrothed, jape. There are
also the newly coined words, slang, recent borrowings

22

from other lan-guages——televise, transistor, gestalt, id.

Not only do words vary with time, they also vary
with situation. The word “horse” is familiar and in-
formal. In academic circles, or other formal environ-
ment it is conceivable that someone might still refer to
t-he same creature with the word “steed.” On the collo-
quial level, the animal is often called. a “nag.”

A strong relationship exists between the variations
of time and situations. The informal, “horse,” corres-
ponds to the current usage. “Steed,” is formal and also
archaic. In general, the formal level of speech incor-
porates both archaic and new words because it is the
language usually employed in the publishings of aca-
-demies and professional societies, groups which are in
the habit of looking both ahead and behind to familiar-
ize themselves with history and the future. In doing

so, these groups very often assume the tones and lan-'

guage of the new and the old; their writing may become
unnecessarily obscure. For example:

This is an essay toward a military deci-
sion theory analogous to thermodynamics
rather than to statistical mechanics. Such
a theory would presumably turn on .state
variables. This paper gives a clear deﬁni-
tion of one state variable ualready shadowy
recognized and achieves a shadowy recogni-
tion of another varia'b-le or complex of vari-
ables which are so new that they may be
meaningless. The former variable is termed
contﬁdence, and occupies -the same place in
the formal theory as a prior bounds and
the strategies of nature, but has a clear
operational deﬁnition. The latter variable
has no name nor formal status but seems
to be recognizable in military contexts as
that dimension which stretches between
purestatistical uncertainty and pure game-
theoretic competition.

The archaic use of the word, “essay,” tips the read-
er immediately. Today, we make “efforts,” or we “try,”
but only the knights of old “essayed.” The paragraph
displays the academic robe of the writer but does not
in-form. In fact, it even becomes poetic, speaking of
“the strategies of nature,” which are in God’s province,
not man’-s. Almost every word gets in the way of
every other word and no man from any walk of life
desires to ‘waste time ﬁguring out what the author
means. Most any reader would see’ immediately that
the author is more concerned with impressing than in-
forming. The paragraph tells far more about the
author than it does about a military decision theory.

Because‘ of the special vocabulary, technical writ-
ing is often placed on the formal level. But the; concepts
which must be explained and described are complicated
in themselves. Often the reader is hanging on by a
-ﬁngernail even when the communication is presented
in the simplest language possible. When the writer
‘compounds the felony’ by deliberately choosing words
and phrases because of their academic tone, he is actu-
ally plucking at the reader’s ﬁngerhold and forcing
him oﬁ the cliﬂ‘ of comprehension. Most concepts can

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

be explained with words from our current speech.
The author should delve into the formal or academic
pool of words only when he can’t get precise expres-
sion from ‘his stock of familiar language.

Basically, technical writing is concerned with facts.
It is objective, a term which is derived from the word
“objects,” and this word implies facts which are veriﬁ-
able propositions. There are al-so -facts which cannot
be veriﬁed; these are called subjective facts because
they pertain to conditions within the observer, rather
than the observed. Instead of writing, “smog was in
the air,” the technical writer records, “the air was dilut-
ed with 15 per cent carbon particles and 5 per cent
of other solids.” Both of these are statements of fact.
The air may be full -of smog to one person, but not
to another. The concept of smog depends on the ob-
server. It is subjective. A quantitative statement of the

An example of early, scientific writing is this letter
written in 152 .4.D. by N onius Datus, an engineer, to the
magistrates of Saldae in Algeria. The personal touches
which Datus injects in the letter distinguish it from the
modern technical paper.

I found everybody sad and despondent. They had
given up all hopes that the opposite section of the
tunnel would meet, because each section had already
been excavated beyond the middle of the mountain.
As always happens in these cases, the fault was attri-
buted to me, the engineer, as though I had not taken
all precautions to ensure the success of the work. What
could I have done better? For I began by surveying

air’s dilution at any one moment, however, can be
veriﬁed, and whether it is smog or not, is of no signiﬁc—-
ance. Our writing is technical in that it employs special
terms which have speciﬁc meaning to a large profes-
sional group and it is objective in that the emotional
reaction of the observer ‘has been eliminated.

The distinction between objective and subjective
attitudes is the fundamental difference between art and
science. In art, the individual observer renders facts
after they have ﬁltered through his intelligence and
emotions. The artist responds to a subject, and presents
it with his bias and his emotional coloring. In science,
the individual observer merely records natural phe-
nomena. The scientist or engineer applies only logic to
organize the observed facts. He orders his material,
and reports it without personal bias or impression.
After he has done this, then he may interpret, but
his interpretation must be based on external, not in-
ternal, observation. Other investigators may then inter-
pret the same observations in a diﬁferent light. ‘Observa-
tions of both investigators, however, must agree; other-
wise the work has not been objective and has no value

MARCH 1958

in technology.

The words the writer chooses reveal whether his
attitude is subjective’ or objective. His main intention
is to inform, to appeal only to the reader’s understand-
ing. H-is vocabulary, then, refers to actual objects, pro-
cesses and ideas which can be identiﬁed in the real
world. It avoids high-level abstractions as much as possi-
ble and, when generalizing, does so from concrete facts.
Generalizations are always substantiated by the facts,
either inductively or deductively.

Writing is communication, and to communicate,
the transmitter must operate on the same frequency
as the receiver; the writer should know what reader
he is trying to reach. In technical writing, the reader

at Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

in the field of Materials Engineering

The development of more advanced,
far more powerful aircraft engines
depends to a high degree on the de-
velopment of new and improved
materials and methods of processing
them. Such materials and methods,
of course, are particularly important
in the nuclear ﬁeld.

At Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, the
physical, metallurgical, chemical
and mechanical properties of each
new material are studied in minute
detail, compared with properties of
known materials, then carefully ana-
lyzed and evaluated according to
their potential usefulness in aircraft
engine application.

The nuclear physics of reactor
materials as well as penetration and

effects of radiation on matter are
important aspects of the nuclear re-
actor program now under way at
P & W A. Stress analysis by strain
gage and X-ray diffraction is an-
other notable phase of investigation.

In the metallurgical ﬁeld, mate-
rials work involves studies of corro-
sion resistance, high-temperature
mechanical and physical properties
of metals and alloys, and fabrication
techniques.

Mechanical—testing work delves
into design and supervision of test
equipment to evaluate fatigue, wear,
and elevated-temperature strength
of materials. It also involves deter-
mination of the inﬂuence of part
design on these properties.

In the ﬁeld of chemistry, investi-
gations are made of fuels, high-tem-
perature lubricants, elastomeric
compounds, electro-chemical and or-
ganic coatings. Inorganic substances,
too, must be prepared and their
properties determined.

While materials engineering as-
signments, themselves, involve dif-
ferent types of engineering talent,
the ﬁeld is only one of a broadly
diversiﬁed engineering program at
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft. That
program — with other far-reaching
activities in the ﬁelds of mechanical
design, aerodynamics, combustion
and instrumentation—spells out a
gratifying future for many of to-
day’s engineering students.

 

Engineer measures residual stress in a com-
pressor blade non-destructively, using X-ray
diffraction. Stress analysis plays important part
in developing advanced aircraft engine designs.

The important effects of gases on the properties of
metals have been increasingly recognized. Pratt & Whitney
chemists are shown setting up apparatus to determine
gas content of materials such as titanium alloys.

P & W A engineer uses air jet to vibrate
compressor blade at its natural frequency,
measuring amplitude with a cathetometer. Simi-
lar fatigue tests use electromagnetic excitation.

Pratt & Whitney Aircraft operates a
completely self-contained engineering fa-
cility in East Hartford, Connecticut, and
is now building a similar facility in Palm
Beach County, Florida. For further in-
formation about engineering careers at

MARCH

Modern chemistry is creating exciting new
horizons that challenge the inventive
minds of both scientist and student. Prod-
uct synthesis, by bold adaptation of natural
resources to our way of life, has pushed
the frontiers of chemistry far beyond its
early promises.

As the chemical industry forges ahead,
inventing new processes and producing
new materials which assure the progress
and comfort of our society, research and
development soar to new heights. Imagina-
tive exploration advances under chemists
and chemical engineers. New and greater
production facilities are created. Many
more engineers of all kinds tackle the com-
plex tasks of building new plants or de-

 

signing new processes to expand and per-
fect the many operations of this ever-
growing industry.

Yes, today’s chemistry is a fascinating
world. Filled with exciting accomplish-
ments and possibilities, it attracts young
men and women of vision who will give
the industry the inspiring leadership of
tomorrow.

Not all bearings can take loads from the sides, as well as from above.
The tapered design of Timken bearings lets them take both radial

roll the load on a full line of contact between their rollers and races,
they have extra load-carrying capacity.

YOUR SUMMER EMPLOYMENT

If you are one of the 115 student engineers that
completed the YMCA application for summer employ-
ment that appeared in the December issue of SKY-
SCRAPER ENGINEER, you can be sure that they
have been processed and are now on their way to in-ter-
ested companies. Some of you may already have meen
contacted by industrial concerns that have summer
jobs available.

The applications were delayed for a number of
days at the YMCA office because some were not sub-
mitted in black ink or typewritten. New forms had to
be completed before the Placement Bureau processed
and distributed them.

THE COLONEL SPEAKS

At the Petroleum Engineer’s seminar on February

given to U. S. citizens in a foreign country. According
to Colonel Sustar, “When we go a-broad, we have to
keep in mind that we go there to learn; and if we

their friends.”

A graduate of the School of Political Science and
Journalism at Prague University, Colonel Sustar serv-
ed 23 years with the Czechoslovak Forces. He arrived
in America in 1948. Since then he has distinguished
himself as one of the nation’s leading aut'horities on
world affairs. At present his foreign aﬁ"air’s analyses
are broadcas-t over radio station. WCAE and televi-
-sion ‘station WQED.

«Colonel Sustar is an administrative assistant to
the Cultural an-d Educational Exchange Program at
the University of Pittsburgh. His responsi-bility con-
cerns the foreign leaders’ and specialists’ programs of
the U. S. Department of State.

Lotus Blossom (Rheda Meyers’)

Captain Fisby’s arrival at Tobiki village has as
its directive the duty of instilling democratic ideals
into the natives. But as a former professor of the hu-
manities, Capt. Fisby undertakes his assignment with
a feeling for the art and -dignity of the villagers. De-

1 mocracy, the gentle captain believes, is not so much a
- union of states as it is a state -of mind.

Saki-ni, the local philosopher-at-larg-e, is the rag-
ged rascal who is ‘specially assigned’ to Capt. Fisby.
He is the official interpreter, peacemaker, and infect-
iously funny obstacle to the Army’s categorize-d plan
for democracy. Since he is both a civilian employee of
the army and a friend of the Tobiki villagers, he must
some-times makes rather humorous compromises.

‘One of these c-ompromises is Lotus Blossom. She is a

" Geisha, sold by her parents and learned in the ‘arts
«of music, dancing, and conversation. She is deﬁnitely

not a part of the Army’s plan, not a part of Capt.
Fisby’s plan, but she is a part o-f T0biki’s.

W-hen Lotus Blossom arrives, the women of Tobiki
ask her to train them to be Geisha girls. The men of
the village back the idea and plan a teahouse in: which
the women may entertain. Money fo-r -building the tea.-
house is earned through the sale of the -people’s native
sweet-potato brandy to distant Army and Navy in-
stallations. The Tea'house of the August Moon is ﬁnal-
ly built. and Tobiki is a happy, prosperous, democratic
community.

After Colonel Purdy, head of ‘ the Army occupation
team in Okinawa, receives reports from Army Intel-
ligence about the hu-ge sums of money pouring into
Tobiki, the Colonel pays the town an unexpected visit.

Washington reaction comes quickly and unexpect-

American “get up and go” in the recovery pro-gram,
plans an immediate visit to Tobiki. In a few minutes
the native “get up and go” reassembles the teahouse
an-d has it again in working order.

Fisby orders special brandy for the Colonel as they
await the Committee. And Sakini repeats the philoso-
phy he gave in the beginning: “Pain makes man think.
Thought makes man wise. Wisdom makes life endur-

SOMETHING NEW IN RAILROAD CARS

The latest entry in the industrial car ﬁeld is a
self-pnopelled, automatic, electronic weight-recording
‘scale -car. The 40-ton capacity cars carry iron ore and
other burden materials from storage bins to the blast
furnaces. They are constructed of all-welded COR-
TEN steel plates for strength, and the hopper is lined
with USS T-1 steel for high resistance to abrasion
and impact.

One of the unique features of the new car is its
weighing apparatus. The electronic scales, activated
by hydraulic type load cells, eliminate the constant
wear and jamming of mechanical scales now in general
use. The hydraulic load cells actuate an electronic
mechanism as the car is ﬁlled and operate the scale
which can be read by the operator. The weight is re-
corded on two tapes, one for immediate reference and
one to serve as a permanent rec-ord of materials charged
into the blast furnace.

The car’s two trucks are driven by 75 horsepower
motors which can operate separately or in unison. An
electronics interlocking system is one of the many
built-in safety features of the new cars. One such inter-
lock allows the car to be discharged only at the skip
hoist and only when the skip car is in position to re-
ceive materials. Another interlock prevents movement
of the car while its gates are open.

Six, two and one half ton high-grade graphite blocks are
prepared for shipment by National Carbon Company.

NEW PROP-JET ELECTRA

Lockheed’s new prop-jet Ele'ctra, ﬁrst production
airliner of America’s jet age, took to the air recently
and success-fully completed a maiden ﬂight of 1 hour
and 27 minutes. The ﬂight culminated 30 months of en-
gineering and production work set in motion when
American «Airlines ordered 35 Electras in 1955.

The new Prop-jet requires less than 1900 fe'et of
runway for its takeoff. “Earwitnesses” have described
the Electra’s takeoff as notably quieter than the best
of today’s four-engine transports.

The jet-and-propeller Electra is designed primarily
for a speciﬁc need: swift, proﬁtable operation on short-
to-medium-range routes. It can also, however, dis-
play the same turbine-powered performance on non-
stop ﬂights as long as 2700 miles.

Four General Motors Allison Model 501 prop- E

jet engines with a total of 15,000 h-0-rsepower turn
four-‘bladed propel-lers which generate intensiﬁed air-
ﬂow and lift over 60 per cent of the plane’s 99-foot
wingspan.

Especially developed for commuter-type air travel
on distances of 500' miles or less, which comprises near-
ly 87 per cent of the nation’s scheduled ﬂights, the
new transport is built as a convenience for mainten-
ance personnel as well as passengers. On-the--ground
time between ﬂights will be cut to approximately 14-
minutes because of single-point pressure fueling; large,
integrally lighted service centers; carry-on luggage
racks; integral stairs; and easy-to-reac‘h bag-gage com-
partments.

B-58 BUILDING BLOCKS

Six of the biggest blocks of high-grade graphite
ever made, each weighing more than two and a half
tonrs, have been prepared by National Carbon Com-
pany. Measuring 20 by 461/2 by 84 inches, the huge
graphite slabs will be used by Convair in producing
the delta-wing B-58 “Hustler,” the nation’s ﬁrst super-
seonic jet bomber. Convair will accurately machine the
graphite into intricate shapes on which will be placed
stainless steel components to be furnace blazed to-
gether at high temperatures to form honeycomb panels.

SKYSCRAPER ENGINEER

Convair and its subcontractors found graphite to be
the only acceptable material for this application be-
cause of its dimensional stability at elevated temperatur-
es and its resistance to thermal shock. The aircraft indus-
-try has turned to honeycomb sandwich panels in its
search for light-weight materials that will ‘withstand
the friction heat of supersonic planes. Large graphite
reference forms are required for producing assemblies
for today’s giant airplanes.

POCKET p-H METER

A new aid to student and graduate engineers is
the: lightweight portable Pocket pH Meter for accurate-
ly measuring pH, acidity and alkalinity. Ideal for use

This’ pocket-size pH meter gives quick accurate measure-
ment in the laboratory, plant, or field.

in laboratory research, and classroom and ﬁeld de-
monstration problems, the pH meter is produced by
the Scientiﬁc Instruments Division of Beckman Instru-
ments, Inc.

Anyone. can use this hand-size instrument -after
reading the brief simple instructions on the back of the

FLOATING METALS IN SPACE

Man’s newest “wonder” metals are now being
investigated by heating them thousands of degrees
above white heat, while they ﬂoat, freely suspended in
space. Called levitation melting, this unique and vers-
atile technique was invented by Westinghouse research
scientists and brought to its present state of develop-

A high-frequency alternating current flowing in the coil
produces heat for the levitation welding process.

ment by the‘ combined efforts of scientists at the
Westinghouse Research Laboratories and the Univer-
sity of British Columbia.

In levitation melting, compressed metal powder is
placed inside a copper coil which carries a high-fre-
quency current of electricity. Reversing its direction
nearly a million times a second, the electric current
generates a ﬁeld of force which, ﬂoats the metal charge
inside the coil. At t-he same time, it converts the metal
into a white-hot molten mass in a matter of seconds.

Simplicity of apparatus, speed of melting and ease
of handling a wide assortment of metals and alloys are
other advantages of levitation melting. The molten
metal even stirs itself, yielding unusually uniform al-
loys from mixtures of different metals.

Ductile Iron . . . another Inco

Over five

A deep sea tanker takes many a heavy
beating when waves are rough.

With each pitch and roll, she has to
weave. And her ﬁve or more miles of
piping have to weave with her.

If it is ductile iron piping, every pipe
length gives without break or leak.
Bends without breaking
Ductile iron is not only ductile, but also
tough. And resistant to the corrosive
action of sea water and sulfur laden
crude oil.

In some tankers, gray cast iron pipe
resists corrosion for ten years or more.
Sometimes, though, it’s cracked and
broken by the pounding of heavy seas
that overtax its strength.

In other tankers, steel pipe outrides
such storms without damage. But it cor-
rodes so badly it may have to be replaced

Research first

Now on many supertankers, ductile iron is a new material widely used by today’s engineers in designing heavy-duty equipment.

Ductile iron pipe, tanker owners ﬁnd,
combines the low cost and demonstrated

the tough strength of carbon steel.

So today, many of the newest tankers
carry pipe and ﬁttings of ductile iron.

We want engineers who ask

We want the inquisitive engineer—~and the inquisitive scientist and business
or liberal arts graduate. We want a man who will not only do a job and do it
well, but will look beyond the immediate “how” of the problem for the reasons
behind it.

WHY do we want such a man? Because the man who asks “WHY” is usually
the man who comes up with new ideas. Union Carbide has grown through new
ideas, in the ﬁelds of carbons and gases, alloys, chemicals, plastics, and nuclear
energy.

WHY should you consider Union Carbide for your future? It’s diversiﬁed
and growing (stability, soundness, many channels for advancement). But it
offers the advantages of smaller businesses, too, since its activities are handled
by Divisions which operate in many ways as independent companies.

WHY not do something about it‘? Representatives of Divisions of Union
Carbide Corporation, listed below, will be interviewing on many campuses.
Check your placement director, or write to the Division representative. For

Because engzneerzhg is a]2r0fe.s1s*z'072 at GM—
your professional stature grows year by year

I1ERE’s something of serious importance to you as a
young graduate engineer:

Are you taking just a job—or are you going out to really
practice the respected profession for which you have been
so fully trained?

Here at General Motors we long ago recognized that engi-
neering is a profession—and began treating our engineers
who work on our hundreds of products as professional men.

For example our engineers are used on assignments that
give them an opportunity to use their training and educa-
tion as they were meant to be used. To let them practice
engineering.

Or take the fact that GM encourages its engineers to gain
professional recognition by presenting technical papers to
engineering societies.

Take, too, the encouragement our engineers receive in
working for advanced degrees, in doing original research.
The fact that over 179 of our engineers and scientists
received over 164 patents for such work in a recent four-
month period is one indication of the opportunity for
creative work here at GM.

And these are but a few examples of the fact that engineer-
ing is a profession at General Motors.

Why do we place engineering in this special category?

Because we know that from the work of our engineers at
our 35 divisions and 126 plants in 71 cities and 19 states——
and at our huge Technical Center near Detroit—will come
the products that will keep General Motors on its progres-
sive path.

Naturally, you get more than professional recognition.
Your salary reflects your ability and progress.

And, of course, there is opportunity without limit. For 14
of the 33 GM Vice-Presidents are engineers, as are 23 of
the 42 Division General Managers.

Today we are looking for young men who may ﬁll tomor-
row’s GM executive positions. Should you wish to join us
and practice your profession as you build your career, let
us hear from you. It could be the most important letter

of your life. , , ,

ENGINEERING TRAINING

helps speed careers at Western Electric

Right now, VVestern Electric engineers are back “on campus”
in a unique new Graduate Engineering Training Program.
They’re attending courses at special study centers established
by the company in Chicago, New York and Winston-Salem,
N. C. It’s a rare chance to study advanced engineering and get
full pay at the same time.

These “students”-are guided by a teaching staff of top West-
ern Electric engineers, outside experts and professors from
leading universities. They’re learning the latest technical devel-
opments . . . boning up on everything from manufacturing proc-
esses to computer applications.

VV hen the program reaches its peak, some 2,000 to 3,000 VVest—
ern Electric engineers will attend each year. . . studying in an
atmosphere as close to a university graduate school as is prac-

 

Knowledge born in the classroom often sparks on-the-
job ideas. Thes-e engineers are working on transistor
manufacturing problems.

tical for industry.

This engineering “university” was born because of the ever-
increasing complexity of VVestern Electric’s job as the manu-
facturing and supply unit of the Bell Telephone System. Today
VV. E. engineers are right in the middle of exciting fields like
microwave radio relay, electronic switching and automation.
Graduate engineering training is designed to spur their devel-
opment and advancement throughout their entire careers.

How Graduate Engineering Training would work for you

The program gets under way after approximately six months on-the-job

experience. First off: ~-

1. A nine-week Introduction to Western Electric Engineering helps you
learn about your W.E. engineering ﬁeld, sharpens your skills in getting
ideas across. Technical subjects include communications systems, prod-
uct design principles, military electronic systems.

2. Another nine-week program, General Development, starts after your
first year with us, helps broaden and strengthen your engineering back-
ground. Besides technical subjects like engineering statistics, measure-
ments and instrumentation, and electronics, you receive grounding in
human relations and the socio-economic importance of engineering.

3. To meet continuing needs for formalized technical training, Advanced
Development offers four-week courses tailored to the individual needs
of the engineers selected to attend. These courses are designed to help
develop creative engineering abilities. Computer applications, switching
theory, feedback control systems, and semi-conductor devices and cir-
cuits are sample topics covered in this phase.

Besides taking part in the Graduate Engineering Training Pro-
gram, engineers are eligible for our Tuition Refund Plan for
after hours study at nearby colleges.

In short, there’s a unique opportunity at Western Electric to

develop a professional career . . . and work in the exciting world
of communications.

START TODAY TO
PLAN TOMORROW

By knowing about some of the projects underway at the

1 Babcock & Wilcox Company, an engineer may see his

personal avenues of growth and advancement. For today
B&W stands poised at a new era of expansion and
development.

Here’s an indication of what’s going on at B&W, with
the consequent opportunities that are opening up for
engineers. The Boiler Division is building the world’s
largest steam generator. The Tubular Products Division
recently introduced extruded seamless titanium tubing,
one result of its metallurgical research. The Refractories
Division developed the ﬁrst refractory concrete that will
withstand temperatures up to 3200 F. The Atomic Energy
Division is under contract by the ABC to design and
build the propulsion unit of the world’s first nuclear-
powered cargo vessel.

These are but a few of the projects——not in the plan-
ning stage, but in the actual design and manufacturing
phases — upon which B&W engineers are now engaged.
The continuing, integrated growth of the company offers
engineers an assured future of leadership.

How is the company doing right now? Let’s look at one

A great big beautiful car pulled
up to the curb where a cute little
working girl was waiting for a
bus. A gentleman stuck his head out
and said, “Hello, I’m driving west.”

“How wonderful,” said the girl,
“bring me back an orange.”

Introducing the new deacon to
her deaf father, a young girl said:
“Father, this is the new deacon.”

“New dealer,” exclaimed the
father with surprise.

“No, no. Not a new dealer; a
new deacon. He’s the son of a
bishop.”

The father nodded wisely, “They

all are.”

He kissed he.r on her rosy lips;
How oould he then but linger?
But oh, when he caressed her hair,
A cootie bit his ﬁnger.

When the college man caught
his girl in t-he arms of an engineer
he calmly replied: “I don’t mind if
you neck with my girl, but there is
going to be one heck of a ﬁght if
you don’t get your hand off my

“My husband thinks there’s some-

‘Why Vought Projects

Bring Out The Best
In An Engineer

At Vought, the engineer doesn’t often
forget past assignments. Like all big
events, they leave vivid memories.
And it’s no wonder.

For here the engineer contributes to
history-making projects — among
them the record—breaking Crusader
ﬁghter; the Regulus II missile, chosen
to arm our newest nuclear subs; and
the new fast-developing 1,500—plus—
mph ﬁghter, details of which are still
classiﬁed.

The Vought engineer watches such
weapons take shape. He supervises
critical tests, and he introduces the
weapons to the men with whom they
will serve.

Engineers with many specialties share
these experiences. Today, for exam-
ple, Vought is at work on important
projects involving:
electronics design and manufacture
inertial navigation
investigation of advanced propulsion
methods

Mach 5 conﬁgurations

Vought’s excellent R&D facilities
help the engineer through unexplored
areas. And‘ by teaming up with other
specialists against mutual challenges,
the Vought engineer learns new ﬁelds
while advancing in his own.

The structures engineer who
found a fast detour

“Advise and assist on structural problems.
Do what you can to keep the program moving. . .”
With this outline of his liaison duties, Stress Analyst
Ed Clay accompanied Vought’s Regulus II missile to
its desert test site.

On the desert, Ed found a dearth of structural
problems. Regulus II reliability gave the ﬂight test
program tremendous momentum. In quick succession
the missile notched l0 ﬂights. When time came for a
critical high-speed test, the program was three
months ahead of schedule!

Then, the very fact that things had moved so
fast threatened to rob the program of the time it
had gained.

As Vought had planned, a wind tunnel flutter test
had to precede the upcoming high-speed flight.
But Vought’s prearranged date at a government
tunnel was over a month away. The facility was
booked solidly up to the appointed day. And Vought’s
own Mach 5 tunnel was under construction.

Then Ed revealed the scope of his liaison. It had
ranged to the rocket test track at nearby Edwards Air
Force Base. There, with the help of a cooperative
track project engineer, Ed had spotted a rusting
rocket sled, left behind from a radome test. Now, if
the sled could be rigged to carry that spare Regu-

MARCH 1958

lus ﬁn, Ed ﬁgured, they might get ﬂutter data before
the tunnel test.

That changed Ed’s state of liaison. All Vought
was suddenly at his service. Shopmen reworked the
sled to mount the fin. Instrumentation technicians
ﬁtted the ﬁn with gages and transducers. Vought’s top
ﬂutter men double—checked, raised their eyebrows,
then endorsed the whole thing.

At the track, moments before the rockets exploded,
Ed had a twinge of doubt. His sled was a mon-
ster, indeed. Air loads would be terriﬁc . . .

Then the sled shot off on the ﬁrst of two success-
ful trips that revealed all the data required.

At Chance Vought, there’s liaison in spirit as well as
in name. It allies engineers of many specialties and view-
points against mutual problems. It builds channels
instead of walls between diverse technical areas.
It’s another reason why top engineers are choosing
Vought—— to keep abreast of all fields while advancing
in one.

Magnetic fields, acting as a double piston,
drive luminous ionized shock waves through
transparent tube. One-tenth microsecond ex-
posure in STL’s Physical Research Laboratory.

MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS
and SPACE TECHNOLOGY

Magnetohydrodynamics provides one of the most promis-
ing approaches for attaining the velocities and speciﬁc
impulses that will be required for manned space ﬂight to
a planet, landing, and returning.

The critical problem in attaining velocities of hundreds
of thousands of miles per hour is the containment of tem-
peratures comparable to those in the interior of stars.
Because the temperature of the driving reaction will have
to rise as the square of the exhaust velocity, temperatures
greater than one million degrees will be encountered in
reaction chambers. Magnctohydrodynamics offers a
unique solution to the basic problem of containing the
reaction without contact with the chamber walls.

Brieﬂy, the physical principles of magnetohydrody-
namics are these. Since gas at such temperatures is com-
pletely ionized and is an effective conductor of electricity,
the introduction of currents in the gas (in this state
called a plasma) creates an electromagnetic ﬁeld. This
ﬁeld makes it possible to control the plasma by applying
an external opposing magnetic ﬁeld which creates a mag-
netic bottle to contain the charged gas particles. Similarly,

a magnetic—ﬁeld piston can be used to accelerate the par-‘
ticles. Such magnetohydrodynamic reactions are expected
to develop exhaust velocities that are an order of magni-
tude greater than those generated by present chemical
rockets.

At Space Technology Laboratories, both analytical and
laboratory work are proceeding in the ﬁeld of mag-
netohydrodynamics. This work illustrates the advanced
research in STL’s Physical Research Laboratory, which
emphasizes the application of basic physical principles to
the requirements of space technology.

In support of its over-all systems engineering respon-
sibility for the Air Force Ballistic Missile programs, and
in anticipation of future system requirements, STL is
engaged in a wide variety of research and experimental
development activity. Projects are in progress in elec-
tronics, aerodynamics, propulsion, and structures.

The scope of work at Space Technology Laboratories
requires a staﬁ‘ of unusual technical breadth and compe-
tence. Inquiries regarding the many opportunities on the
Technical Staff are invited.

Q. Mr. Hill, what can I do to get the
most out of my job interviews?

A. You know, we have the same
question. I would recommend that
you have some information on what
the company does and why you be-
lieve you have a contribution to
make. Looking over company in-
formation in your placement ofﬁce
is helpful. Have in mind some of the
things you would like to ask and try
to anticipate questions that may
refer to your speciﬁc interests.

Q. What information do you try to get
during your interviews?

A. This is where we must ﬁll in be-
tween the lines of the personnel
forms. I try to ﬁnd out why partic-
ular study programs have been fol-
lowed, in order to learn basic motiva-
tions. I also try to ﬁnd particular
abilities in ﬁelds of science, or math-
ematics, or alternatively in the more
practical courses, since these might
not be apparent from personnel rec-
ords. Throughout the interview we
try to judge clarity of thinking since
this also gives us some indication of
ability and ultimate progress. One
good way to judge a person, I ﬁnd,
is to ask myself: Would he be easy
to work with and would I like to
have him as my close associate?

Q. What part do first impressions play
in your evaluation of people?

A. I think we all form a ﬁrst im-
pression when we meet anyone.
Therefore, if a generally neat ap-
pearance is presented, I think it
helps. It would indicate that you
considered this important to your-
self and had some pride in the way
the interviewer might size you up.

Q. With only academic training as a
background, how long will it be before
I'll be handling responsible work?

One of a series*

Interview with General Electric’s

W. Scott Hill

Manager — Engineering Recruiting

Qualities I Look For

When Recruiting Engineers

A. Not long at all. If a man joins a
training program, or is placed direct-
ly on an operating job, he gets
assignments which let him work up
to more responsible jobs. We are
hiring people with deﬁnite consider-
ation for their potential in either
technical work or the management
ﬁeld, but their initial jobs will be
important and responsible.

Q. How will the fact that I've had to
work hard in my engineering studies,
with no time for a lot of outside activi-
ties, affect my employment possibilities?

A. You’re concerned, I’d guess, with
all the talk of the quest for “well-
rounded men.” We do look for this
characteristic, but being president
of the student council isn’t the only
indication of this trait. Through
talking with your professors, for
example, we can determine who
takes the active role in group proj-
ects and gets along well with other
students in the class. This can be
equally important in our judgment.

Q. How important are high scholastic
grades in your decision to hire a man?

A. At G.E. we must have men who
are technically competent. Your
grades give us a pretty good indica-
tion of this and are also a measure
of the way you have applied your-
self. When we ﬁnd someone whose
grades are lower than might be ex-
pected from his other characteristics,
we look into it to ﬁnd out if there
are circumstances which may have
contributed.

Q. What consideration do you give work
experience gained prior to graduation?

A. Often a man with summer work
experience in his chosen academic

ﬁeld has a much better idea of what
he wants to do. This helps us decide
where he would be most likely to
succeed or where he should start his
career. Many students have had to
work hard during college or sum-
mers, to support themselves. These
men obviously have a motivating
desire to become engineers that we
ﬁnd highly desirable.

Q. Do you feel that a man must know
exactly what he wants to do when he is
being interviewed?

A. No, I don’t. It is helpful if he
has thought enough about his in-
terests to be able to discuss some
general directions he is considering.
For example, he might know whether
he wants product engineering work,
or the marketing of technical prod-
ucts, or the engineering associated
with manufacturing. On G—E train-
ing programs, rotating assignments
are designed to help men ﬁnd out
more about their true interests be-
fore they make their ﬁnal choice.

Q. How do military commitments affect
your recruiting?

A. Many young men today have
military commitments when they
graduate. We feel it is to their ad-
vantage and ours to accept employ-
ment after graduation and then ful-
ﬁll their obligations. We have a
limited number of copies of a De-
partment of Defense booklet de-
scribing, in detail, the many ways in
which the latter can be done. Just

It remained for Nicholas Lobachevsky to solve a riddle that bothered mathe-
maticians for the better part of twenty-two centuries.* He was able to construct
a rational geometry by denying Euc1id’s ﬁfth postulate——by maintaining that
parallels do meet.

Here at Sylvania Electric we have a noneuclidean geometry of our own, in
which parallels also meet. It’s a geometry of professional development, though,
and not just of points, lines, and planes.

\ .,
 ’/WHAT no we MEAN.

THIS: At Sylvania a man advances by one of two parallel paths.

10 $0
$0 £0
$0 10

If his interests and talents lie in the areas of engineering and scientiﬁc
specialization, he advances as a specialist.

If his forte is in the areas of organization and administration, he advances
through management.

These parallel paths meet in a common point: At Sylvania a man knows that
he is given the fullest opportunity to develop and exercise his talents. He knows
that a man goes as far and as fast as he is able in the path of his choice. Whether he
chooses management or specialization, he ﬁnds equal rewards and compensation.

PROBLEMS
Sir:

Your magazine, for the most
part, is pretty good. There is one
part, however, that I don’t like——
“Skycapers.”

I know that engineers h-ave a
good background in mathematics,
but the questions you ask would
‘take a mathamatician a week to
ﬁgure out. Of course, the problems
should be difficult—must they be
impossible? I suppose you don’t
print the answers to the questions
in your proceeding issue because
you .can’t ﬁgure them out your-
self.

Finally, why aren’t the winners
of the ﬁve dollar prizes announced?
Doesn’t anyone ever win?

Harry Malls
EE ’59

Your complaint is justified. The
reason we haven’t announced any
“Skycaper” winners is that no one
has ever answered all of the questions
correctly. With this issue, therefore,
we are beginning a new policy of
offering the five dollar prize to the
person who answers the most ques-
tions correctly. The problems in this
issue are also less difficult than
previous ones — Ed.

A GOOD QUESTION
Sir:

In regard to your column in the
January issue entitled “Slips O’ The
Stick,” 1 wan-t to congratulate you
on achieving the ultimate in a

Chester Milquetoast attitu-de. Some
of your “humor” left much to be
desired in the way of entertain-
merit.

Although I realize that being a
school sanction-ed publication, you
cannot print jokes of an objection-
able nature. Nevertheless, there is
no reason to try to pass on school
girl humor to “well-rounded engi-
neers.”

For example:

During a grouse hunt one sports-
man was shooting at a clump of
trees near a stone wall. Suddenly
an angry face popped over the top
of the wall.

“Curse you, you almost hit my
wife!”

“Did I? cried the man. “I’m
terribly sorry—-have a shot at mine
over there.”

Since jokes have long been a
good selling point, why not re-
turn to your former practice of
printing good, solid, adult jokes?

James R. F aherty
Aero E ’58

Publishing jokes can sometimes be
a risky business. With one eye on the
student body, one eye on the admini-
stration, and one eye on a code of
decency, it becomes difficult to
select the jokes that will please
everyone. Sometimes it seems as if
we are favoring one group or are
printing jokes that are either too
adult or too childish. We ‘try not to
have this happen, but it does come
up now and then — Ed.

Shamrock Ball.

To give you a preview of the
Players’ performance, SKYSCRAP-

Speaking of Engineers’ Week, we
know you will want to read the
cover story, “Auditorium of the
Future,” by Russ Maxwell. In addi-
tion to his du-ties as C-hairma-n of
Engineers’ Week, Russ found time
to cover one of t-he more spectacu-
lar phases of Pittsburgh’s renais-
sance.

Even though construction of the
auditorium will only begin in the
near future, we feel that the plans
for this fascinating project deserve
special coverage. See page 14:.

Each year the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet undertakes a pro-
gram for the selection o-f the out-
standing seniors graduating from
the nine engineering departmen-ts.
From these nine men a student-
faculty committee selects one man
as The Outstanding Graduating
Senior.

Again this year SIKYSCRAPER
ENGINEEER recognizes these men
for their scholarship, leadership,
character, and service to the
Schools of Engineering and Mines.

One of SKYSCRAPER’s objec-

tives is to promote tech-nical writ-

ing. To give you an insight into
this ﬁeld, we offer Daniel Mar-
der’s “An Approach to Scientiﬁc
Writing.” This article is adapted
from the author’s address to writ-
ers and editors at the Army Chemi-
cal Center, Edgewood, Maryland.

His experience in technical writ-
ing includes work with corporations
in New York and the editorship of
an English l-anguage newspaper in
Madrid, Spain. He is presently a
full-time advisor in technical ‘writ-
ing at the Ballistics Laboratori'es
at the Aberdeen Proving Ground
in Maryland. See page 21.

Kenneth Speckhals presents a
unique approach to food produc-
tion in “Algae on Your Menu?” He
wrote this article from a paper he

 

Ken Speckhals

presented in a contest sponsored by
the Koppers Company.

When he first began to prepare
this report, he was primarily inter-
ested in the applications of solar
energy. After reviewing all avail-
able material, Ken found that the
cultivation of algae was one of its
newest applications. See page 16.
