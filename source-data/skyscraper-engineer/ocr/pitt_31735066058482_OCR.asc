Outside Madrid, to the northwest, is
the University City. With construc-
tion beginning in 1927, a great num-
ber of modern educational buildings
and sports grounds have been com-
pleted. There are few dormitories
since the University is primarily a
commuter school. One building of
particular interest was the new Aero-
nautical Engineering Building whose
size is comparable to Alumni Hall’s.
Yet Madrid’s Aero Department is
smaller than Pitt’s!

There are only about 400 aeronau-
tical engineers working in Spain.
The majority of engineers are civils
and industrial-metallurgicals. Of the
twelve universities in Spain, the Uni-
versity of Madrid is the only one
offering a degree in aeronautical engi-
neering. In addition to the univer-
sities there are many technical-skills
schools granting technician degrees.
At the University of Madrid, engi-
neering is 3. seven-year program! Upon
graduation, their engineers can begin
work in practically any technical ﬁeld.
Moonlighfing. Many of t-he lecturers
in engineering departments are engi-

neers who work for the government or
private engineering ﬁrms. In fact,
most professional men in Madrid hold
two jobs. Government working hours
for these men are from about 8: 30 a.m.
until 2: 30 p.m., when everything closes
until 5:00 or 6:00 p.m. Then these
men can work in private jobs as tutors,
consulting engineers, or in other ﬁelds
of interest until 11:00 p.m. In many
homes, these unusual Work hours
cause lunch to be served at 3:00 p.m.
and supper at midnight.

In an apartment on the Avenue of
America, a major boulevard in north-
east Madrid, I lived with a Spanish
family, teaching each of the three
eldest children English daily in ex-
change for room and board. My stay
with the Garay family was very re-
warding. Generalizations about
Spanish family life cannot, of course,
be drawn from one case; however,
family ties appear to be very strong.

Twenty minutes outside of Madrid

is the National Aerospace Ins-titute
(INTA), the center of Spanish indus-
trial testing and research. INTA also
cooperates with German, French,
English and American companies and
governments in various projects.

During June, I worked in INTA’S
Non—Destructive Testing of Material
Section where Sr. Morcillo, an indus-
trial engineer, taught me to take

X—rays of parts suspected of defects
and to develop and read these X-rays.
Under the supervision of Sr. Ramilez,
considered as one of Spain’s experts
on materials’ testing, and his assist-
ants, Sr. Monteil and Sr. Rosas, I
learned and ran several types of elec-
tromagnetic tests and helped use
ultrasonic testing equipment for
defect detection.

During July, I worked in Protective
Coatings section under Sr. Izu with

his assistants, Flores and Alejo. From
them I learned how to chemically
analyze paint and run tests for prop-
erties like viscosity, hardness, peel,
and color durability.

One o-f the INTA projects com-
pleted during my employment was the
construction of Sr. Munoz’s test struc-
ture for t-he study of zero gravity
conditions. In July, the men of this
division, directed by the section head,
Sr. Tarifa, presented a series of semi-

’merrymaking and

nars to discuss their outside work on
particular projects. I was very for-
tunate to attend two of these semi-
nars, being the ﬁrst American to do so.
Fiesfas. Near INTA is the small
pueblo, or village of ‘Torrejon, where
life goes on much more slowly than in
Madrid. The main amusement is the
weekly bullﬁght in the pueblo bull-
ring and the frequent small ﬁestas.

Beginning on the 7th of July is the
week-long Feast of San Fermin in the
city of Pamplona, thirty miles from
France. Each year the local young
men chase the bulls, guided by special
fences through the streets of Pam-
plona into the bullring. After the
amateur toreros climb out of the ring,
there is an hour of rest before the
street—dancing
begin. Wine ﬂows freely in this well
organized and well mannered crowd
until the afternoon bullﬁghts begin.
Throughout the long afternoon and
into the early morning hours the
merrymak-ing and socializing
continues.

Between cool, green Pamplona and
Madrid on the Central Plateau in
Segovia. Here still stands a Roman
aqueduct built over two thousand
years ago. In the summer the intense
heat bakes the ground brown and

one but tourists wander the winding
narrow streets.

An hour from lVIadrid is the Sierra
de Guadarrama, an internationally
popular skiing spot. Here, too, is the
Valley of the Fallen, a momument to
the soldiers of the 1936-1939 Civil
War. Beneath a towering cross on the
mountain top is hollowed a beauti-
fully designed chapel. This structure
of strong beauty is visited by tens of
thousands each year.

South of Madrid is Toledo, home of
El Greco, the seventeenth century
artist noted for his religious paintings.
One travels narrow, sloping streets
visiting his museum, his house, and
the St. Thomas Chapel which dis-
plays his famous painting, The Death
of Count Orgaz. Nearby ‘is the Al-
cazar Castle of Toledo where a hand-
ful of men with several hundred
women and children withstood a
Communist attack for three months
during the Civil War.

I have tried to give some hi-g-hlights
of my stay in Spain, though there is
much more to see and learn. It is im-
possible to generalize Spain except to
say that the people, swarthy in the
South and fair in the North, are very
friendly, the country, a blend of lush
green, rugged hills, and dry ﬂats,
is lovely Spain, with its contrast of
new and old, is enchanting. I enjoyed
Spain. I hope to return.

More economical designs are now
possible in construction of steel-frame
high-rise bu-ildings as a result of re-
cently completed research in plastic
analysis or lim-it design — an im-
proved structural analy-sis technique
that takes advantage of the reserve
strength of steel beyond the elastic
yield point.

Of primary importance in limit de-
sign is the fact that the designer has
a more realistic understanding of how
steel frames respond to the loads they
carry. The designer has greater free-
dom in selecting members of the frame
that produce a balanced, economical
design. Expected savings resulting
from plastic analysis will be approxi-
mately 10 to 20 per cent.

Formerly, steel-frame buildings were
designed on the basis o-f elastic theory.
Elastic theory is based on Hooke’s
law — simply stated as stress is pro-
portional to strain. That is, struc-
tural steel shows a linear relationship
between stress and strain up to a cer-
tain point called the proportional
limit for structural steel, the propor-
tional limit usually lies somewhere
between 30,000 and 36,000 psi.

‘I2

Above the proportional limit, struc-
tural steel shows a nonlinear relat-ion-
ship between stress and strain. The
strain rate becomes higher in regard
to the stress rate. Eventually, struc-
tural steel reaches the yield point,
where strain increases without any
appreciable increase in the stress.
Elongation. Above the yield point,
elongation of structural steel con-
tinues without any appreciable in-
crease in loading and the steel is said
to be plastic. This phenomenon con-
tinues until the plastic yielding may
be as much as 10 to 15 times the
elastic stretch, up to the proportional
limit.

Eventually the -steel begins to
strain-harden and recovers some of
its elastic property. Thereafter the
stress-strain relationship remains non-
linear until the point of ultimate
strength is reached. After the point of
ultimate strength, stress reduces until
fracture occurs.

Thus, if Working stresses were based
on the ultimate strength of the mate-
rial, a more realistic and economical
analysis would result. However, in
application of Hooke’s law, as in elas-

 

by Robert W. Furry

tic analysis, the stresses above the
proportional limit are meaningless.

Plastic analysis is not based on
elastic working stresses, but on the
ultimate load — the maximum load a
member can carry without collapse.
Calculations to determine this load
are based on the knowledge that the
member is deformed beyond the point
where stress and strain are still pro-
portion-al (porportional limit). In
plastic analysis, engineers proportion
members to carry an ultimate load
which is computed by multiplying the
working load by a safety factor.

The theory of plastic analysis is
based on the following assumptions:
Structural steel is perfectly elastic-
plastic; that is, stress is proportional
to strain up to the proportional limit,
after which strains increase without
change in stress. This is valid for
structural steel since it has a pro-
nounced yield point.

Strains in a structural member sub-
ject to bending are proportional to the
distance from the neutral axis. After
the strain at a cross-section of the
member equals or exceeds the elastic
limit, a “plastic hinge” is created.

With ‘increase in load, the member
will rotate freely about a plastic hinge
while it sustains a constant bending
moment (plastic moment).

From these assumptions, it follows
that zones of yielding in a beam will
create plastic hinges at po-ints of peak
bending moment. Beam-to—column
connections will transmit the needed
plastic moment capacity.

Formation of plastic hinges results
in a redistribution of bending moments
in continuous structures from t-he most
highly stressed portions to those
carrying less stress. After a plastic
hinge forms at one portion of a beam,
bending moments increase in other
portions until more plastic hinges are
created. When sufficient hinges have
been formed so that the structure
becomes a mechanism, the ultimate
load has been reached.

UH'ima'|'e load. The basic assump-
tions of plastic analysis imply that
the ultimate load for a tension m-em-
ber or short compression member is
P, = F, A, where F, is the yield
stress and A is the cross-sectional
area. Also, the plastic moment in the
beam is My = F, Z, where Z is the
plastic section modulus, the statical
moment of the cross-sectional area

about the neutral axis.

The ratio of the pl-astic section
modulus of a rectangular shape is 1.5.
For rolled I-beams and wide-ﬂange
sections the ratio ranges from 1.09 to
1.20. This ratio contributes to the
economy possible with plastic analysis
compared to elastic analysis.

Thus, the designer is able to select
members wh-ich are suitable and which
generally result in a reduction of the
cross-sectional area of the members as
compared to those chosen according
to elastic analysi-s. This is deﬁnitely
an economic advantage.

A less obvious advantage to plastic
analysis is the substantial savings in
the reduction o-f design time. Further-
more, Where plast-i-c analysis results in
less weight for a building, further
economies are gain-ed in steel transpor-
tation and handling costs. Founda-
tion construction costs can also be
appreciably reduced.

Owners, builders, and ﬁnan-cvers of
high-rise buildings such as offices,
apartments, hotels, hospitals, and
educa‘tional facilities will beneﬁt from
plastic analysis as engineers -and archi-
tects become familiar wit-h this tech-
nique and apply it to their designs.

Lehigh University 'I'esI'ing frame . . .

 

A special conference was held at
Lehigh University, Bethlehem, Pa.,
this summer to acquaint practicing
engineers and engineering educators
with the new design theories and with
practical methods for their application.

Research in plastic design at Lehigh
began in 1934. By the mid-1950’s
enough tests had been performed and
enough information accumulated to
formulate plastic design met-hods for
one-and two—story buildings. In 1958,
building codes in the United States
were revised to permit plastic design
in such buildings.

Recently completed research at
Lehigh University, sponsored by the
American Iron and Steel Insti'tute and
other organizations, has produced ad-
ditional information from which new
structural design concepts were
evolved. This new data makes it pos-
sible to extend the plastic theory to
the design of multi-story steel--frame
buildings.

The economic beneﬁts offered by
plastic design wi'll be important in the
construction of structures for indus-
trial use, public utilities, government
and other public buildings, research
institutions and parking facilities.

to prove your worth early in your career. Dale
Anderson’s experience is a case in point.

After receiving his B.A. in Physics in June, 1962,
Dale joined our College Graduate Program and
was assigned to our Research Laboratories.
Recently he was given the responsibility for cor-

EMITT

On June 18, probably a normal day
for most University engineers, I left
Kennedy International Airport for a
12-week stay in Europe as an EMITT
Award winner. I ﬂew to Amsterdam,
Holland, where I was to spend the
ﬁrst eight weeks of my trip working at
the National Luchten Rui1ntevaart-
la-boratorium (NLR), the National
Aero and Space Laboratory, on a job
obtained by the International Asso-
ciation for the Exchange of Students
for Technical Experience (IAESTE) .

Canals, ﬂowers, trees, and orange-
tiled roofs added color to my ﬁrst
View of Amsterdam. As we ﬂew over
the city, the streets gave the pictur-
esque scene of a relief map.

Landing a few minutes later at
Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, which
is built thirteen feet below sea level, I
had the odd experience of looking up
a-t a canal.

In Pittsburgh the new Westinghouse

The bus ri-de from the airport to

the city afforded m-e my first oppor-
tunity to observe the suburbs of this
large Dutch city. Lack of space and a
large population on the western part
of the Netherlands (the provinces of
North and South Holland) necessitate
erecting most of the buildings upward
rather than low along the ground and
hence I saw many ten—story apart-
ment houses. These modern buildings
are a signiﬁcant civil engineering feat
because the sandy soil offers practi-
cally no support for construction. All
construction, be it a building, train
tracks, or a road, -is built on piles
which are driven through the soft
sand until they hit a clay deposit.
The roads, usually made of concrete
blocks or bricks, still sink i-nto the
ground and must be newly layed
every three years.
Home. Arriving in downtown Amster-
dam, I went directly to Leidenhoven,
the student house Where I was to
stay. A third of the residents of
Leidenhoven, which is like a YMCA
for students, were studyin-g at Dutch
Universities; the rest were students
also working in IAESTE summer
jobs; and the managers were foreign
men Working in Amsterdam tempo-
rarily. No one in the house was
Dutch. My two roommates, an
English and a Yugoslav, as well as
almost everyone else in the house
spoke English.

Rofferdam harbor

On my ﬁrst Sunday, I went to town
to look around. Everyone except the
American tourists, was dressed up in
his ﬁnest clothes. The Dutch usually
take their families fo-r a walk, a picnic
in the park, or a game of miniature
golf on Sunday afternoons and many
times local bands give public concerts
in the park. Sunday evenings in
Amsterdam are quiet and peaceful.

Royal palace

The next day my English roommate
and I started work at NLR. The
company supervisor received us very
warmly and we spent the day getting
to know the laboratory and its em-
ployees. Both of us worked in the
transonic aerodynamics section for all
eight weeks.

That ﬁrst day our boss gave us our
assignments. Although security pre-
vents me from adequately describing
my project, it was equivalent to those
of the permanent NLR employees.
Many times during my Work, I con-
sulted other NLR personnel and on
one occasion traveled a hundred kilo-
meters to seek advice from another
branch of the laboratory.

My supervisor estimated my project
to take eight weeks for completion,
but I ﬁnished it in four. This was un-
expected and for several days I did
ﬁller work, such as analyzing graphs.
For the remaining three and a half
weeks, I had a project similar to the
ﬁrst. The problem was to devise a
check on the work of another em-
ployee to correct certain faults in his
performance.

Language problem. The result of
both projects was the writing of a
computer program. The company
computer was an Elliott model, made
in England and using the computer

language ALGOL. Although I took a
course at the University in computer
programing, I had to learn this new
language as part of my job. I found
it true that in many phases of my
projects, whatever I knew was not
enough. I often had to go to the com-
pany library for more material.

Although I was only a summer
worker, I was treated in the same
manner as the regular employees and
in some ways better. I was allowed a
day and a half off per month plus un-
limited sick leave (with proof) and
an educational leave. The educational
leave was useful because the Dutch
Foreign Student Service conducted
tours for IAESTE students working
in the Netherlands. We were also
allowed use of all facilities open to
regular employees including a canteen
service at which tea costs one cent,
coffee 11/2 cents and Coca-Cola at
'7 cents for a small bottl-e.

I went to work every day by bus
or trolley. The latter is one of the
most common and inexpensive means
of travel in Amsterdam and most of
Europe. A ride costs only about
11 cents although a pass reduced the
price to less than 5 cents. These prices
included enough transfers to get
almost anywhere in the city. Although
inexpensive, trolleys were not the
most popular mo-de of transportatio-n.
In the city of Amsterdam with one

million people, there are 600,000 bicy-
cles and every morning they all
seemed to be on the streets. Special
roads for bicycles parallel the main
highways.

Since few people outside Holland
speak Dutch, all students in the
Dutch public schools must learn
French, German, and English. They
are taught English with a distinct

Os+en bridge

 

British accent. Whenever I went to a
store not usually visited by tourists,
I would take out my phrase book and
try to speak in Dutch. Before I could
get started, the saleslady would
always ask, “May I help you?” When
I arrived in Holland, I could not
speak Dutch and, as a result of the
prevalence of English, when I left, I
still didinot know the language.

Wafer. Because most of Holland is
below sea level, the Dutch have
always fought the water. Throughout
Dutch history, ﬂoods have killed large
parts of the population. Several years
ago, the citizens built a 22 mile dike
and, at present, are planning to build
even more spectacular ones. These
dikes are not inland, but divide large
bodies of water. The 22 mile dike, for
exam-ple, separates the North Sea
from a larger. one connected to it.
Besides t'he dikes, there are many,
many canals running through the
country and the cities. Despite all
this, the Dutch are, I believe, the
worst plumbers in the world: there
seemed to be leaky faucets-everywhere.

The entire trip, both my stay in the
Netherlands and my later travels
through Europe, was very enjoyable
and exciting. More than that, my
many experiences such as those with
the Dutch people who generally were
very friendly but initially reserved and
formal, were culturally broadening.

‘I9

The Company's first engine, the Wasp, took
to the air on May 5, 1926. Within a year the
Wasp set its first world record and went on
to smash existing records and set standards
for both land and seaplanes for years to
come, carrying airframes and pilots higher,
farther, and faster than they had ever gone
before.

In recent years, planes powered by Pratt
& Whitney Aircraft have gone on to set
new standards of performance in much the
same way as the Wasp had done in the
1920's. The 727 and DC-9 are indicative of
the new family of short-to-medium range
jetliners which are powered by the highly
successful JT8D turbofan. Examples of
current military utilizations are the J58-
powered Mach 3 YF-12A which recently
established four world aviation records and
the advanced TF30-powered F-111 variable-
geometry fighter aircraft.

Charles Proteus Steinmetz

The story of electrical wizard
Charles Proteus Steinmetz, the great
engineer, scientist, and mathematician,
begins in 1865 in Breslay, Germany.
He was born deformed, on April 9 of
that year, a third generation hunch-
back.

When Steinmetz ﬁrst went to
school, he had considerable trouble
with mathematics — especially with
the multiplication tables. However,
by the time he reached the upper
grades and continued on to the Uni-
versity of Breslau, he was by far the
brightest math student in his class.
Steinmetz was always amazing his
classmates with his remarkable
mathematical ability. He carried a
table of logarithims with him at all
times — in his head!

Steinmetz at this time was active in
turbulent 19th century German poli-
tics. He fought for higher wages and
political equality for the working man.
Shortly before he was to have to
received his Ph.D., he was forced by
Chancellor Bismark to leave Germany
or face political imprisonment. The
thesis he was to have presented was
entitled “On Involuntary §elf-Recip-
rocal Correspondences in Space which
are Deﬁned by a Three-Dimensional
Linear Systems of Surface on the Nth
Order”.

Einstein and! Steinmetz

Edison and Steinmetz

Steinmetz ﬂed to Switzerland and
continued studying at the Zurich Poly-
technical School, barely supporting
himself by tutoring and writing
articles. At this time he was deeply
involved in studies of astronomy,

engineering, and mathematical theory.

Steinmetz wa-nted to come to the
United States and did so with his
American friend and roommate, Oscar
Asmussen, as a steerage passenger in
1889. Steerage travel was gruesome
in those days and w-h-en Steinmetz re-
ported to the New York customs, he
was a sickly sight. When the immigra-
tion oﬂicials asked the necessary ques-
tions about his job status and such,
Steinmetz answered mostly in his
native German. Asked if he could
speak any words in English, he replied,
“A few.”

Asmussen saved Steinmetz from de-
portation by explaining the situation
to the officials and telling them that
Steinmetz would be his personal
responsibility.

Within three years after his ar-
rival in New York, ‘Steinmetz was
prominent in engineering circles. By
the time of his death, this strange
looking man, barely four feet tall, was
known as the “Supreme Court” to the
General Electric Company and as the
“wizard of electricity” to the whole
world.

First job. Arriving from Europe, Dr.
Steinmetz had a letter of introduction
from a friend in Germany that go-t
him his ﬁrst job in America. He began
as a draftsman with the ﬁrm of
Eickemeyer and Osterheld in Yonkers,
New York, working on the design of
an electric motor for street cars. Be-
fore long, Eickemeyer realized the
genius that was Steinmetz and named
him to head his ﬁrst lalboratory.

It was here in this crude laboratory
that Steinmetz solved a major elec-
trical problem that had been baffling
engineers for years. The problem was
that of power losses, or “hysterisis”,
caused by the alternating current
magnetic flux in a—c motors, genera-
tors, and transformers. Before the
time of Steinmetz, no one know knew
how to determine this power loss, nor
was it possible to predict the efficiency
of prospective electrical apparatus.

Dr. Steinmetz solved the problem
through pure mathematics. When he
ﬁnished his calculations, he drew up a
table which showed the amount of
power loss for each particular volume
of magnetism. Thus, for the ﬁrst
time, the efficiency of electrical ap-
paratus could be determined before it
was built.

Hysterisis. Steinmetz described his
Law of Hysterisis as his greatest ac-

How to join DuPont closest to the top

Join us right out of school. Few men start higher at Du Pont
—or with more promise—than graduating engineers. That's
because we fill virtually a|_l important positions from within.

|t’s a policy that's helped us grow 750% since 1937. Since
1950 our sales have more than doubled from $.1 billion to $2.4
billion. We spend $90 million a year-on research, $60 million
of which goes into the discovery of new scientific truths and
new materials.

And because new products continually emerge from our re-
search labs, responsible new career opportunities constantly
spring up for our technical men. In fact, there’s room for you
to actually “change jobs” within Du Pont—to seek out the spot
best suited to you without loss of your accrued benefits.

compli-shment and explained it as fol-
lows. Unlike the electr.ic current,
which requires power for its mainte-
nance, the maintenance of a magnetic
ﬂux does not require energy expendi-
tures. The energy consumed by the
magnetizing current in the ohm-ic re-
sistance of the magnetizing windings
has an electric-al and not a magnetic
effect. The energy required to produce
a magnetic ﬂux is stored as potential
energy in the magnetic ﬂux and is
returned at the decreased or disap-
pearance of the magnetic ﬂux. How-
ever, the amount of energy returned
at the decrease of magnetic ﬂux is less
than the energy consumed at the same
increase of magnetic flux, and energy
is therefore dissipated by the mag-
netic change and converted into heat
by what is called molecular magnetic
friction (MMF).

Thus if a magnetic flux is periodi-
cally changed between +B and—-B or
between —B and +B as by an alterna-
ting or pulsating current, a dissipation
of energy by molecular magnetic frie-
tion occurs during each magnetic
cycle.

The energy which is consumed by
an electric current as a magnet.izing
force is in effect f(H,B) where H is
the ﬁeld intensity and B is the mag-
netic ﬂux. The lag of the magnetism
behind the magnetizing force is the
phenomenon called hysterisis.

In general, if a magnetic flux
changes from condition H] , B1 to
condition H2 , B1 , is is assumed this
magnetic circuit is surrounded by an
electric circuit of N turns. The change
of magnetic ﬂux induces in the
electric circuit the voltage

Shortly after Steinmetz’ discovery
of the law of hy-sterisis, General
Electric, as part of its expansion pro-
gram acquired the Eickemeyer ﬁrm-
its patents and its Steinmetz.

Within a short time, Stein-metz was
put to the task of solving the com-
plexities of alternating current. The
Doctor at once decided that there
must be a better Way. For month-s he
struggled and ﬁnally came up with
the Steinmetz method of making cal-
culations on alternating current. The
books he wrote for engineers explain-
ing his method for making the mathe-
matical ca‘lculations are still being
used and form the basis of many elec-
trical engineering courses.

Steinmetz is perhaps best known
for his Work with lightning. He was
the ﬁrst m-an to create lightning in
the laboratory. Through his studies,
Steinmetz and followers obtained pre-
cise information about lightning and
thus produced efficient lightning
arrestors.

Dr. Steinmetz found that although
lightning was often the original cause
of the disturbances on electrical sys-
tems, the actual damage and destruc-
tion was not done by the lightning.
It was done by the electrical energy
of the system itself, produced by the
electrical generators in the regular
way. This line energy would break its
bounds, or get out of control, when
lightning struck Within a certain
radius of the system.

Pint of current. Said Steinmetz on
lightning, “The diiference between
lightning and ordinary current is simi-
lar to that between a pound of dyna-
mite and a pint of gasoline. The pint
of gasoline contains more energy and
can do more work than the pound of
dynamite, but the pint of gasoline
gives its energy off only slowly, at a

Figure 2

moderate rate of power, while the
dynamite gives off its energy explo-
sively, all at once, at an enormous
rate of power, and thereby locally
tears and destroys.”

During his inventive years in
Schenectady, Dr. Steinmetz assigned
201 patents to the General Electric
Company in his name. His greatest
role to G.E. was in the capacity of
consultant. He was referred to as the
“Supreme Court”, to whom an engi-
neer would go for professional advice.
If Steinmetz gave his approval, the

company would not hesitate to ﬁnance
a new project.

Late in 1923, Stein-metz took a
combination business and pleasure
trip to the West Coast. He was tired
and il‘l when he returned. His doctor
ordered him to rest for two weeks.
On October 26, 1923, just as he was
showing signs of recovery, Charles
Proteus Steinmetz died. He left be-
hind a legend and the framework
around which our electrical age has
been and continues to be built.

What kind of engineer will you be...

preliminary design, design, development?
At AiResearch Phoenix, you Work as all three

before you decide.

Ymr future as an engineer is
strongly inﬂuenced by your ﬁrst
assignment. What that assign-
ment will be, should be, is an
important decision.

At Garrett you control that
decision. During an eight-month
orientation program, you work
with experienced engineers on a
variety of assignments in different
areas. Your permanent assignment
depends on your own aptitude
and interest.

In preliminary design you may
work on gas turbine engines, jet
engine starters, or advanced power
systems for space vehicles. Analy-
sis is the key—and the emphasis
is on thermodynamics, fluids,
vibration, heat transfer, and math
to solve today’s problems.

As a design engineer, you see
your solution to a product design
problem take shape on the draw-
ing board and in fabrication. You

as

   

may work on controls systems for
turbine drives, engine fuel sys-
tems, or a laboratory test system.
Mechanics is the theme—statics
and dynamics, materials and pro-
cesses, and graphics are your tools.

In development, you’ll test
designs before they go into pro-
duction. Manufacturing processes
are examined and production
techniques are explored. Every-
thing from nuts and bolts to com-
plete power systems are tested,
and your lab work and practical
judgement will pay off in this area.

Your career at AiResearch
Phoenix can be stimulating and

 

rewarding. You can work in all
three important areas of engineer-
ing on diverse aerospace products.
You can use your total education,
learn more on top of it, and take
part in a wide variety of advanced
engineering.

At AiResearch Phoenix, the
product lines include gas turbines
for auxiliary power, turboprop
engines for business and military
aircraft, secondary power equip-
ment for aircraft, advanced space
vehicle nuclear power systems,
pneumatic and hydraulic control
systems, as well as a variety of
related equipment for aerospace,
ground, and undersea applications.

What's New
in
Engineering

Glass memory. The computer aboard
the Gemini manned spacecraft has a
unique feature, glass memory loca-
tions. Glass memories were chosen
due "to their ability to resist the effects
of electro-magnetic vibrations. Other
important installation requirements
on Gemini are sm-all size, relatively
light weight, and small power require-
m-ents.

Packaged in an epoxy case the glass
memories have withstood vibr-ation
testing that demonstrated satisfactory
operation under 50 g’s rms at vibra-
tion of ﬁve to QOOO cycles per second.
In shock tests, the memories con-
tinued to operate satisfact-orily under
shocks of 85 g’s rms.

The light Weight and small size of
the glass memories contributed to the
remarkable lightness and smallness of
the entire computer, which weighs
only 57.6 pounds and requires only
about one cubic foot of space.

Prospeciors. Tremendous electrical
explosions on the surface of the earth
are now making the search for oil far
more efficient and inexpensive.

The Globe Exploration Company,
Inc. has devised a system called
“Dyna—Pulse” which uses surface-
generated seismic energy to deﬁne
sub-strata conditions. Large amounts
of electrical energy stored in conden-
ser banks is released as a plasma dis-
charge in a transducer which converts
the “explosion” into seismic energy.

Precise control of the instant and
amount of energy released makes pos-
sible the simultaneous use of several
ﬁeld units, thus reducing operating
costs. “Dyna-Pulse” units can be
truck mounted, or used aboard a
barge or boat.

Besides the simplicity and safety of
electrohydraulic equipment over

If you still think glass is just glass,

ask NASA.

Ask NASA about the windows on the Gemini spacecraft
—formed from glass specially designed by Corning.

They not only provide mechanical and thermal protec-
tion, but also increase visual transmission beyond the
theoretical 92 per cent to 99 per cent. Ask, too, about the
high-speed glass memories that help guide Gemini to in-
space rendezvous and re-entry.

And ask about the glass resistors, as thick as telephone
poles, which serve as dummy loads and power dissipating
terminations at tracking stations.

Glass can be designed to maintain constant electrical
properties at missile speeds. Withstand the pressures at
the ocean’s ﬂoor. Save weight without sacriﬁcing strength.

The personnel manager of a sm-all oil company was giving
a recent Pet. E. one of those intelligence tests. He asked
the applicant to select t-he one word out of place in this
group: man, woman, eggs, carpet, loving.

As -a matter of fact, the tester didn’t know what the
correct answer was, but the applicant reasoned thusly:
“Well, you can beat a man, and you can beat a woman,
and you can beat eggs, and you can beat a carpet. But
you can’t beat loving.”

The old river boat captain was bragging to one of his

Just then the boat ran aground with a sickening lurch.
“See,” said the captain cal-mly, “tvhere’s on-e of ’em n-ow.”

Passing a cemetery in the wee hours of the morning, a
drunk noticed a sign which read, “Ring the bell for the

“What do you want?” asked the pajama clad man.
“I wanna know why you can’t ring the damn bell

A young couple recently moved into an Oakland apart-
ment. Finding the place infested with mice, the husband
purchased two mousetraps and placed them in the base-
ment. One he put by a basket of apples and another
by a box of nuts.

Late that night a loud “snap” was heard downstairs and
the husband rushed to investigate. His wife followed
him to the top of the stairs.

“I got him!” yelled the jubilant husband.
“Did you catch him by the apples, dear?” queried his

wife.

“No, clear” he answered.

Sergeant: “I suppose when you get out of the army
you’ll be waiting for me to die so that you can spit on
my grave.”

Private: “No, sir. After I shed this uniform, I’l-l never

a shadow hiding behind the shower curtain. Immediately
he opened it and found a man standing in the tub. The
man jerked the curt-ain closed again.

“Pl-ease,” he said, “I haven’t ﬁnished voting yet!”

EXPLORE THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES AT

 

ational SecurityAgency

. . . where special programs encourage rapid professional advancement
for the engineer, scientist and mathematician launching his career.

 

NSA is a scientific and technological com-
munity unique in the United States, perhaps
in the world. Unique in its mission, its oper-
ation, its requirements. . . unique, too, in the
scope of opportunity it affords a young scien-
tist or engineer beginning his career.

A separate agency functioning within the
Department of Defense, NSA is responsible
for developing ”secure” (i.e., invulnerable)
communications systems to transmit and re-
ceive vital information. Within this area, which
encompasses the whole field of Cryptology-
the science of codes and ciphers—NSA project
teams pursue a broad spectrum of investiga-
tions taking them well beyond many known
and accepted boundaries of knowledge. Be-
ginning with basic research, these investiga-
tions progress through applied research,
development and design, prototype engineer-
ing, and on into various phases of applications
engineering.

At NSA you might specialize in any or sev-
eral of these sectors, depending on your
talents and special interests:

ENGINEERING. Antenna/transmitter/receiver

design . . . high speed computers (digital and
analog) . . . transistor circuitry . . . advanced
radio communications techniques . . . micro-

wave communications . . . audio and video
recording devices . . . cryogenic studies and
applications . . . integrated circuitry . . . mi-
crominiaturization.
PHYSICS. Solid state (basic and applied)
. . electromagnetic propagation . . . upper
atmosphere phenomena . . . superconductivity
and Cryogenics (Ph. D. graduates only).
MATHEMATICS. Statistical mathematics . . .
matrix algebra . . . finite fields . . . probability
. combinatorial analysis . . . programming
and symbolic logic.

Unequaled Facilities and Equipment
In a near—academic atmosphere, NSA scien-
tists and engineers enjoy the most ful|y-instru-

mented laboratories and use of advanced
computer and other equipment, some found
nowhere else in the world.

Skilled clerical and technical support will
free you to concentrate on the most challen-
ging aspects of your projects, and thus help
speed your professional growth.

Outstanding Colleagues

You will work alongside people of enor-
mously varied backgrounds and intellectual
interests, over 500 of whom hold advanced
degrees.

Researchers at NSA also receive constant
stimulus from outside the agency. To assist in
certain program areas, NSA often calls on
special boards of consultants—outstanding
scientists and engineers from industry and

academic centers as well as from other gov-
ernment agencies.

Career Development Opportunities

Your professional growth and earning power
expand from the day you join NSA, without
having to accumulate years of ”experience.”
NSA career development is orderly and swift;
substantial salary increases follow as you as-
sume more and more responsibility.

A number of NSA career development
programs help shorten the time when you
can contribute at your maximum potential.
These programs include:

ADVANCED STUDY. NSA’s liberal graduate
study program affords you the opportunity to
pursue part-time study up to eight hours
each semester and/or one semester or more

of full—time graduate study at full salary. Near-
ly all academic costs are paid by NSA, whose
proximity to seven universities offering a
wealth of advanced courses and seminars is
an additional asset.

IN-HOUSE TRAINING. The new NSA em-
ployee first attends a six—week general orien-
tation program, followed by a period of spe-
cialized classroom study designed to broaden
familiarity with an area or areas of heavy NSA
concern (e.g., communications theory, crypt-
analysis, computer logic and analysis, solid
state physics). Formal study is complemented
by on—the-job training, as you work and learn
under the guidance and direction of highly
experienced associates.

PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, TRAVEL.
The agency fosters a climate of recognition
and advancement for its young professionals
by encouraging participation in professional
association affairs, and assisting you to attend
national meetings, seminars and conferences
as well as visit other research facilities where
related work is underway—government, uni-
versity and industrial—throughout the United
States.

Liberal
Location
NSA policies relating to vacations, insurance
and retirement are fair and liberal. You enjoy
the benefits of Federal employment without
the necessity of Civil Service certification.

Located between Washington and Balti-
more, NSA is also near the Chesapeake Bay,
ocean beaches, ski resorts and other popular
summer and winter recreation areas, not to
mention the varied |eisure—time attractions
of the nation's capital itself. The location
permits your choice of city, suburban or
country living.

You can talk to someuof our chemical engineering big-

has not yet forgotten everything he learned in freshman
calculus is an impractical theorist and a shirker. (Your
impression would be wrong. He doesn’t mean that at all.
Bessel functions were his meat at one time.)

Others of our boss chemical engineers will sound as
though it is no longer decent for an educated professional
to look inside a reactor personally. (He neglects to tell
you how hard it was to give up a grand time as an ap-

Observe, then, that both of these types have risen to
bigwigdom. It takes all kinds to run an outﬁt like ours.
The chap who applies new directions in the solid state

theory of catalysts to knock a nickel off the tankwagon
price of a monomer deserves reward comparable to that
of the grimy one who cuts a plant’s downtime in half by
relocating the ﬁlters so that the pump motors quit burn-

CHOICE is what we believe in offering, in addition to
the expected emoluments. We believe in it for our own
good. We can offer it because of our vast and ever-grow-
ing diversiﬁcation, which is all from within. We offer
choice at the outset and choice after you have had a
chance to try out your ambitions and see how they work.

Drop us a line about your ambitions. If your ambitions
happen to be in mechanical or electrical engineering,
drop us a line just the same. We offer choice there, too.

Neural Networks

For a long time machines that recognize speech
have stimulated the imagination of scientists,
from the engineer to the linguist, both because
of their potential usefulness to communication
technology and for the formidable technical
challenge they represent. Several years of re-
search at RCA have resulted in notable suc-
cesses in this ﬁeld by using networks of elec-
tronic neurons (simulated nerve cells) to iden-
tify phonemes—the smallest practical units
into which speech sounds can be divided with-
out losing their identity. These neural net-
works operate on the several outputs of a
spectrum—analyzing ﬁlter, dynamically examin-
ing the spectrum and making decisions as to
phoneme identity.

PHONEIIE

CIRCUITS

 

During recent investigations, 18 consonant
sounds (for example, /m/ as in “mad” and
/h/ as in “hid”) and 10 vowel sounds were
identiﬁed with 86% to 99% reliability when
uttered by any of 6 speakers. Machine recog-
nition of consonants is, in general, much more
elusive than that of vowels, since the identity
of consonants is hidden in the transient be-
havior of the spectrum to a much greater ex-
tent than in its steady-state nature, as is the
case with vowels. Vowel characteristics, how-
ever, usually are more speaker dependent.
The recognition performance obtained repre-
sents, by a considerable margin, the best re-
sults achieved to date by any investigator.

A “neuron,” as used in these networks, is a
simple computing element exhibiting the char-
acteristics of fan-in and fan-out, an input
threshold, and a speciﬁed analog relation be-
tween output and input when the input ex-
ceeds threshold. An array of several hundred
neurons used in speech analysis is structured
in layers; the ﬁrst layer receives 20 parallel
inputs from the spectrum ﬁlter, and by inter-
connections among its member neurons makes
elementary decisions about the shape of the
spectrum. The many outputs of the ﬁrst layer
pass, in turn, to a second and then to succes-
sive layers, which make ever more sophisti-
cated judgments both of the instantaneous
characteristics of the spectrum and of the
nature of its changes with time. Finally, binary
logic networks make decisions as to the most
likely identity of the phoneme.

In speech processing, neural networks per-
form with great simplicity, limited-accuracy
operations on a large number of simultaneous
inputs, and maintain continuously analog
measures of the reliability of each decision by
virtue of the analog properties of the comput-
ing elements. These properties, so well suited

for speech analysis, are just those required for
solving pattern recognition problems in general.
It is not surprising then, that neural networks
also show exciting promise in the ﬁelds of
visual and other kinds of pattern recognition,
as well as speech.

A Novel Frequency Divider for
TV Sync Generators

An economical, efficient and high-performance
frequency divider circuit for use in new RCA
color TV broadcast equipment has been de-
veloped. The circuit is a monostable multivi-
brator with a unique ability to adjust its timing
period to be proportional to the period of the
input trigger pulses. The circuit uses only two
transistors, and it has the ability to divide an
input frequency by a constant for a wide range
of input frequencies. It is also quite immune
to power supply variations and requires no
precision capacitors. The circuit requires no
externally-applied AFC voltage for regulating
the timing period, such as would be required
in this application with an ordinary mono-
stable divider.

The two periods of a cycle of operation, as
shown in the waveforms, are ﬁrst, “measure,”
and then a “recover.” When the circuit is in
the rest or “stable” state, Q1 is saturated and
Q2 is turned off. Once triggered by an input
pulse, Q2 is placed in a constant current con-
ducting mode which causes C2 to discharge at
an essentially constant rate. This action is ter-
minated by the next succeeding pulse which
leaves the voltage across C2 at a value directly
related to the time period between the pulses.
The capacitor voltage is thus a measure of the
pulse repetition interval. The second pulse,
which terminates the measure period, also
causes regenerative circuit action which turns
Q2 off. Succeeding input pulses cause no fur-
ther circuit action until C2 charges (through
R4) to the point where diode CR2 can again
conduct. The ﬁrst trigger pulse following the
“recover” period causes the cycle to reoccur.

A constant frequency division ratio is main-
tained over a wider input frequency range than
was previously possible as a result of the self-
adjusting timing feature. A new color sync
generator, which uses this type of circuit in
the frequency divider that relates the horizontal
and vertical scanning frequencies, is proving
to be highly successful. A 525:1 divider chain

is used which requires only 8 transistors. If a
chain of binary stages were used, 22 transistors
would be required. Also, a modiﬁed form of
this circuit is used to relate the horizontal
scanning frequency to the color TV subcarrier
frequency.

Transistorized Portable “Victrolas”

Although transistors have previously enjoyed
widespread use in portable receivers and mili-
tary communication equipment, only recently
have solid-state devices made any signiﬁcant
penetration into line operated home instru-
ment equipment. Advancing device technology
has made transistor circuitry cost competitive
with equivalent tube circuitry, while providing
improved reliability, instant warm-up, lighter
weight and cooler operation.

In low-cost phonographs using single stage
tube ampliﬁers, high-output pickups are re-
quired. Such pickups are quite stiﬂ" mechani-
cally, require a high stylus force, and thus
track marginally. These low-cost ampliﬁers
ordinarily use “transformer1ess” power sup-
plies with the attendant design problems of
minimizing hum and shock hazards.

RCA Victor’s new transistorized portable
phonographs use multistage DC-coupled cir-
cuits providing ample power gain for use with
pickups of higher compliance and smoother
frequency response. Record wear and tracking
are thereby improved. The higher efﬁciency of
the output stage and the elimination of the
heater-power requirement result in a cooler
ampliﬁer—and make possible the use of a
secondary winding on the phonograph motor
for the power supply. The resulting isolation
eliminates the shock hazard and makes pos-
sible the application of conventional ground-
ing techniques.

To minimize costs and improve reliability,
this ampliﬁer has been designed to be built on
a printed circuit board. The need for a separate
supporting chassis has been eliminated by
mounting the printed board under the turn-
table on the record changer motorboard, al-
lowing the output chokes and ﬁlter capacitor
to extend through the motorboard. The motor-
board serves both as a heat sink and mounting
for the output transistors. Volume and tone
controls are mounted on the motorboard, and
all inter-connecting cables and wiring are in-
tegral with the record changer assembly.

Does this look
like an answer

to global problems of

ignorance,

disease and physical deprivation?

Not yet. But we're getting closer.

Behind this movement is a simple statistic with startling im-
plications for all of us — if you count all the scientists and
engineers since the beginning of recorded history, ninety
percent are alive today!

We are now in the midst of the result—an incredible explo-
sion of information from every corner of the globe. And
somewhere within this explosion will be the ultimate answers
to mankind's oldest, and newest problems.

The challenges are many. First, to understand the nature
of this giant intellectual force. Then, to find the best way to

 

collect it, classify it, store it...and distribute it appropriately
and instantly to the people who need it.

In this light, you might consider today's Xerox products early
and primitive steps along a difficult but fascinating path.
You'd be right. Yet, has anyone taken these steps before us?

Your degree in Engineering, Science, Business Administration
or Liberal Arts can qualify you for some intriguing openings
at Xerox, in fundamental and applied research, engineering,
manufacturing, marketing/sales, finance and administration.

After visiting the other European
countries in ﬁve weeks, I arrived in
Madrid, Spain. This beautiful city of
over two million people is an incredi-
ble combination of the new and the
old in its customs and appearance. In
addition to the many small shops,
there are over six ultra—modern de-
partment stores with escalators and
front doors that fold back during the
day to be replaced by a curtain of air.
Many Spanish women still sew for the
entire household, so one of the eight
ﬂoors in each store exclusively dis-
plays fabrics, especially materials for
towels and wedding dresses. The
specialty shops, like the bread shop,
the ﬁsh stalls and the all—purpose
store are smaller than the Engineering

and Mines Cabinet office. In Madrid,
there is only one supermarket.

On Sundays and ﬁestas, several
streets in the old section of the city
are closed off as the market area,
El Rastro. Here one sees demonstra-
tions of guaranteed spot removers,
impromtu auctions, and household
items being sold at a low cost; all
faintly reminiscent of a state fair.
Brass rail. A step away from th-e
Rastro are the tasca or cafe—bars
where the tired shoppers rest with one
foot on the brass rail and enjoy cold
beer with griddle-fried shrimp. In the
evening this area is crowded with peo-
ple tasca hopping, sampling wine and
tiny sandwiches, while visiting with a
rising torero. In addition to thou-

sands of open-air cafes and regular
nightclubs, Madrid has many luxu-
rious dining clubs.

The heart of Madrid is the Door of
the Sun, Puerta del Sol, from which
all house numbers are counted and all
distances measured. Here is the so-
called downtown shopping area with
ships lining the dozen streets radiating
from the circle.

West of Puerta del Sol is the Royal
Palace which has been unoccupied
since the last king, Alfonso XIII, ﬂed
in 1931. Visitors may tour the palace,
with its richly furnished rooms, as
skillfully designed and decorated as
anything I saw in Rome. Highlight
of the tour is the Royal Chambers,
still in readiness for a king. 'I‘«his king,
