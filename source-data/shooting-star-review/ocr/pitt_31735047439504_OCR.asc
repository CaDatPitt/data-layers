THE International Sweethearts
Of Rhythm

The Best All Girl Band
In America
Book Review by Michael Whitely

The year was 1946, the
war was over and the
world’s most popular _
music was big-band jazz.
Swing...sweet and hot
from bands like Basie, Miller,
Shaw, and Luncefort. But how
many people remember that one
of the best bands at the time

was a mostly Black, all-girl,
Saxophone choir 15-piece band from rural
Original International Sweethearts of Rhythm Mississippi called the
International Sweethearts of
Rhythm? D. Antoinette Handy’s
book of the same name goes a
long way toward correcting that
oversight.

The story of “America’s
favorite all-girl band” begins in
1909 with Lawrence Clifton
Jones...a man of unusual
vision...who was determined to
bring basic education to young,
Black people in Mississippi. This
was no mean feat at a time
when schools were all but non-
existent in Mississippi’s piney
woods and Governor James
Vardeman called Negro
education ‘a threat to White
supremacy.” Jones began on
donated land with one student,

but soon attracted eight students,
then ﬁfty, then hundreds; and the
Piney Woods Country Life School
was born.

Jones saw the school as a
place where students would
develop fully; educating their
“head, heart, and hands” in a
Christian environment; taking
classes as well as working at
chores to help pay their way.
They also learned music and took
voice and instrument lessons. By
the 1920’s, Jones needed more
money for the school and, as
Handy points out in her preface,
it was only natural for him to
utilize the innate talents of the
students to help raise funds.

The ﬁrst fund raising student
ambassadors for the Piney Woods
school were choral groups who
sang at community events; after-
wards Jones or his wife would tell
the Piney Woods “story” and
accept donations. This led to
male bands going out and then,
in the 1930’s, to the formation by
Jones of the International
Sweethearts of Rhythm; 15 girls,
ages 14 to 19, of mixed
parentage, pulled from the
school’s best marching and
concert bands.

The Sweethearts were an
immediate hit, taking their
swing arrangements and stylish
show throughout Mississippi and
then over much of the United
States. From 1939 til 1941, their
success and reputation grew as
they traveled. “By 1941,” Handy
writes, “the band was rated as
‘one of the nation’s best
draws’...they had broken
attendance records at such places
as Cincinnati’s Cotton Club, D.C.’s
Howard Theatre, Chicago’s Regal
Theatre, (and) Los Angeles’
Plantation Club. . .to name a few.”

The skyrocket the Sweet-
hearts rode to fame, however, was
not without costs. Handy
continues: “This group of young-
sters who enrolled at Piney
Woods Country Life School only
a few years earlier, with no more
than the desire to get a basic
education and learn a '
trade...were now participating in
popularity contests with such jazz
stalwarts as Duke Ellington and
Count Basie.” The girls were also
doubting the school’s interest in
their education versus the
growing sums of money they were
making for the school. There
were sharp disagreements

between the band’s
manager/chaperon, Rae Lee
Jones, and its founder back at
the school, Lawrence Jones (no
relation). Finally, the disputes
ended in 1941, when Rae Lee
Jones and the band decided to
break from the Piney Woods
Country Life School and go
professional.

Author Handy continues
the Cinderella story of the Sweet-
hearts as they enter the big-time
and hold their own; achieving
great success during the war
years, making the USO tours for
the troops, recording records and,
by 1946, ﬁnishing a very success-
ful European tour. Yet the signs
of the end were beginning to
show. Despite the successes, 1946
was the year some of the Sweet-
hearts began to leave; tiring of
the road, seeking other careers,
or marriage. They were replaced,
but by 1948 the Sweethearts were
facing the problem that eventually
meant the fall of the big bands;
the music times were changing.

The swing played by the
big bands was dance music and
suddenly a new kind of jazz
called be-bop was taking hold. >

Summer, 1987—Page 3

Shooting Star Review

1:

Be—bop was music that you sat
and listened to. The tide had
turned. The big bands were on
the decline. Concerning the
Sweethearts speciﬁcally, Handy
quotes various members as saying
the end came because of the low
pay, the number of “originals”
leaving and the death of manager
Rae Lee Jones. By the end of
1949, the International Sweet-
hearts of Rhythm from Piney
Woods Country Life School were
gone.

In her prologue, Handy
states, “it has been my intention
from the beginning to write the
deﬁnitive history of the ladies’
jazz band from the Piney Woods
Country Life School”...“to ﬁll in
the gaps, to present other sides
of the Sweethearts history and to
tell the story from a black
perspective” She achieves this in
an appealing way that tells the
Sweethearts’ story in the context
of the times they lived through.

The International

Sweethearts of Rhythm
begins with the author meeting
with 15 of the Sweethearts in
1980 at the Third Annual

 

Summer, 1987—Page 4

Women’s Jazz Festival in Kansas
City. There, a day was set aside
for the reunion of the
Sweethearts and was an
emotional spark for the book.
Handy writes, “this will be the
commentary of one who rejoiced
in the idea of the Women’s Jazz
Festival, was dismayed that the
Black Press gave the event so
little coverage...(ironic, in view of
the fact that the Black press
followed the Sweethearts so avidly
during their day)...and was
distressed that so few Black
people were in attendance

That emotion and
conviction is combined with the
scholar’s eye for accuracy and
detail as Handy draws on
hundreds of documents, letters,
pictures, interviews, and press
accounts of the period to trace
not only the history of the Sweet-
hearts but of Black America
itself. Just reading the footnotes
at the end of each chapter can
be an education. Handy ends the
book with an epilogue that
contains selected musical histories
of some of the Sweethearts
following their band membership
and appendices that trace all-

black female ensembles and black
female instrumentalists.

The International Sweethearts
of Rhythm, band and book, helps
answer a question a lady friend
once asked while we were talking
about some of the great jazz
bands. She asked, “But don’t any
women play jazz?” D. Antoinette
Handy’s ﬁne book stands as a
reminder that they did and they
do.

of Rhythm

Handy notes that although
the post-April, 1941 story of the
Sweethearts (when their ties to
the Piney Woods Country Life
School were broken) currently
occupies the attention of writers,
ﬁlm makers, record producers
and a few scholars, only casual
references are made to the
group’s earlier travels and
numerous accomplishments.
Handy suspects that none have
gone to the Sweethearts’ source,
the Piney Woods School, none
have given proper recognition to
the girls’ original teacher or the
band’s original road managers.
Handy ﬁnds that, for most, the
fact that the group was interracial
after 1941 represents the band’s
historical signiﬁcance while
Handy places equal value on the
Sweethearts’ all-black years.

In 1982, University Press of
Mississippi released Dr. Alferdteen
Harrison’s Piney Wooa'.s School:
An Oral History. Handy says,
“One sees evidence that the
school is reclaiming its ..
sensational ladies band. This
writer hopes that the trend will
continue”

Shooting Star Review

His name was Rohrs. They
called him the Lion, of course;
they could not be expected to do
much else. The name was out
there with the others, on the big
poster by the box ofﬁce: Bump
Roxy and his Famous Blue
Band. Featuring Adelia Roxy,
Step-Up Tate, “The Lion” Rohrs.

He sat in front of the dimly

lighted hall and chorded lightly

with long knobby ﬁngers on eighty-
eight keys. The hall was beginning to ﬁll. Couples
straggled through the door, circling timidly
around the vastness of the bare dance ﬂoor,
staring at the young white man who sat on the
piano stool. A few were young: tall buck Negroes
in high hitched pants and bulging shoulder pads;
girls in gay dresses, giggling up at their grinning
escorts. But most of the early comers were the
older folks, who came to listen only and not to
dance. They came before eight o’clock to get the
choice seats underneath or at the ends of the
footlights. Often they sat without moving for the
whole ﬁve or six hours, tapping their shoes along
with the big bass, ﬂashing grins that gleamed
weirdly in their black and brown faces.

The Lion Rohrs sat alone on the big stage,
playing gently, quietly, to the early comers. He
had learned that it took the Negroes a little time
to get used to the idea of a white man playing in
a colored man’s band. He usually managed to get
up on the stage while the others were unpacking
the paraphernalia.

He looked up from the keyboard and into the
eyes of a staring young couple across the lights.
He grinned at them—a savage grin, a grin of joy
born of the chords that chortled under the long
hands. And the couple grinned back.

He pressed the loud pedal and did a sudden
trick in the bass, watching an older couple sitting
near the stage. As they jerked their heads up, he
winked at them, into their startled faces, and
heard their laughter, clear and relieved.

Tonight a few white men were out there to
listen. That would be a nuisance. Bump Roxy
hated to play to white men. But there was no
sense worrying about it now.

Bump strode from the wings, nodding curtly to
Rohrs. Stagehands followed him on and began
setting up the traps on the platform in center
stage.

“Here sits the Lion, warmin’ up the audience,”
said Sam Lester. The others straggled in: Hadley
the number one horn man, LeRoy Bunner with
his guitar, Clarence Jackson, the incomparable
Step-Up Tate. Tate and Willie Shepherd stopped
beside the Lion. He cocked an eyebrow at them
and rolled the treble playfully.

“M—m, mm,” Willie sighed. “That Lion, you just
never know what he’s gonna do next.”

“Lion, he don’t know what he’ll do his damn
self.” Step-Up chuckled and touched Rohrs lightly
on the arm before moving away.

It was funny, the Lion thought, funny how easy
it was to get along—with everybody but Bump, at
least. All you had to do was smile most of the
time and play music all the time. The music was
the thing, of course; it sometimes thawed even
Bump Roxy’s scowling distrust. He had sold
himself to Bump by sitting on a piano stool and
touching the keys as he talked.

“Man, it wouldn’t work,” Bump had said. “It
wouldn’t work at all. I ajn’t taking on no white
man...Man, play that damn thing some more.”

cm-

Rohrs looked up at Bump, sitting up on the
high chair behind the traps, the sticks in his
hands. Oh, Lord! thought the Lion, for Bump
was glaring across the lights at the little knot of
white men in the near comer of the ﬂoor. Most

Summer; 1987—Page 7

of them were all right——kids, college kids maybe,

‘who paid their way into a colored dance hall to

hear the music they wore out on records. But a
couple of them, big smirking men in sport coats,
looked mean. The lights distorted their faces, but
Rohrs could see the coats and the sport shirts
with the tight-buttoned, long-pointed collars—the
uniform of the toughs.

It was bad enough when there were just decent
white men out there for Bump to glare at. A
couple of mean ones might spoil the whole show.
They might make cracks at Adelia, and that
would really be something. Bump usually
tolerated a white audience, but it was different
when his wife came into it. He had raised a lot
of sand in St. Louis when a white man had just
whistled at his wife. And he had snapped at the
Lion for a week afterward.

The Lion watched Bump grip the sticks. Bump
Roxy was a great drummer and a great musician.
He told them when they overdid it or underdid
it; he mapped the order of the solos. He held
the band together.

It was worth holding together, the Blue Band.
They were one of the few low-down outﬁts left in
the country, perhaps the only great one. To
Rohrs they were a way of life. He had left home
to play piano against his family’s wishes. When
he joined the Blue Band, a year ago, he had
written of it to his father. There had been no
reply.

He watched Bump drop his eyes to the drums,
touch the sticks to the snare. The muttering roll
grew slowly, rising, fading, then higher still.
Rohrs, although he had heard the theme a
thousand times, held his breath until he heard
the alto wail, the shuddering note of Step-Up’s
break.

It was a loafer for the Lion, nothing but
rhythm and a couple of quick breaks. He glared
from Adelia’s empty chair to the wings, wondering
where she was, what the hell she was doing.
Bump always got sore when she was late getting
on, and Bump would be sore tonight as it was,
with those two nasty-looking white fellows out

there. Besides, she had to do It Ain’t Necessarily
So in the ﬁrst set.

Then, while he worried, Adelia came. She
glided out of the shadows of the wings in her
bold red gown, dazzling band and audience with
her smile. The dance hall sighed.

And she spoiled Bump’s big drum break. She
walked on and grabbed at the eyes and minds of
the audience just when they should have been
ﬁxed on the wooden blur over the tomtoms. The
Lion thought, I wonder if she did that on
purpose.

As she sat down, someone in the white corner
whistled. Bump jerked his head up and stared
deadpan over the lights. Rohrs heard Clarence
Jackson’s ﬁngers stumble on the big ﬁddle.

They played a couple of pops for the dancers,
and it was time for It Ain’t Necessarily So—the
bawl of Hadley’s muted trumpet, Lester’s slim
clear notes on the clarinet. And Adelia with her
head bent a little to one side, Adelia calling to
the lovers in her husky voice. When she ﬁnished
and the band started another dance tune, she
came and stood by the piano. As the saxes
played, she leaned down and gave the Lion that
brilliant smile.

“How was 1?” she asked. “Better than usual?”

“There’s nothing better than your usual,” he
replied, and she laughed and touched his
shoulder. Even as she did it, as the brown hand
rested there for a second, he saw her eyes ﬂicker
over his head, up to Bump on the high chair,
looking for a reaction.

Damn it, Rohrs thought, I wish she’d cut that
out. He gets sore at me often enough as it is.
Aloud he said, “Why don’t you put that thing
away?”

“What thing?” ‘ -

‘”I‘hat needle you’re stickin’ in him all the
time,” Rohrs said. She giggled, and he grinned at
her. He went on, “No kidding, you better lay off
him. There’s a couple guys out front he don’t
seem to like the looks of.”

“He just frets about them on account of me,”

she said. “If he ain’t got sense enough to know’

He heard Bump move toward him, felt him
standing directly behind. He made himself stay
loose when the huge hand touched his
shoulders. . .

better, let him worry.”

She walked away and sat down in her chair; it
stood at the end nearest the white comer, the
Lion noticed. He shook his head, worrying.

He had been warned about that situation when
he ﬁrst joined the band. On the night of his ﬁrst
trip with them, he had ridden alone in the coupe
with Sam Lester. He had asked questions by the
dozen, anything about the band that came into
his head. And naturally he asked about Adelia.

“Bump and Adelia married?”

Lester looked sidewise at him. “Yeah, they’re
married. That’s a good thing for you to
remember?’

“Jesus! Do I look like forgetting it?”

“Lots of white men do,” Lester grunted. “Lots
of white men come to hear the band try to make
her forget it. Lots of colored men, too. We had a
horn player once, tried to fool around with
Adelia. Bump damn near killed that man. Hard
to tell what he’d do to a white man. Damn if I
ever want to see.”

Rohrs had remembered that. He was friendly
when he talked to Adelia, but he only did it
when -he had to, and he was always careful to
avoid giving any impression of talking
conﬁdentially to her. Even then, Bump sometimes
resented it.

Clarence Jackson once told the Lion that
Bump had a sister who ran off with a white man.
That would explain a lot. If Adelia knew that, she
ought to have more sense than to dog him all
the time.

Another time Step-Up Tate had said, “That
man crazy about that woman. He ought to tell
her so more often.” The Lion was still thinking
about that as they wound up the fox trot. Bump
Roxy shoved a handkerchief across his scowling
face. He sat staring at the drums.

Rohrs was suddenly concerned. Bump always
wanted to play loud when he was mad; he liked
to hit the drums as he would hit the heads of
the whistling white men; he liked to hear the
horns open up and blast, maybe blow the leering
faces off the ﬂoor.

That was all right, but they weren’t in shape to
blast. It was nine o’clock and they had nothing
but a few dance numbers behind them. They
would blow their brains out on anything like
High Low Jack or Shattered Slumber...

Bump lifted his head and called it. “Shattered
Slumber.”

The Lion said, “Hold it now.” He slid off the
stool, grinning, seeing the startled faces of the
band staring up at Bump. When he stood by the
drums, he said, “Man, you know better than
that.”

“Goddamn it, Lion...”

“Man, it ain’t ready, it ain’t ripe,” the Lion went
on. “We ain’t ready and the audience ain’t ready.
You got to build up to a thing like that. You
know that.” It was true; the boys would kill them-
selves and the audience wouldn’t give a damn.

“’l‘hat’s right, Bump,” Sam Lester said. “You
know that.”

“I ﬁgured it was the Lion’s time,” Bump said
lamely. There was a long piano solo in Shattered
Slumber. “I ﬁgured it was Lion’s time for a big
one. Everybody else had one.”

“Crosstown, then,” said the Lion. “Crosstown, if
it’s my time It’s too early for the other.”

Bump’s face was sullen. Rohrs grinned at him
and said conﬁdentially, “Man, we can’t all warm
up as quick as you do.”

He walked away, chuckling at the relief in the
faces of Hadley and Step-Up, winking at Willie
Shepherd. He wondered how mad Bump would
be. '

They played the Crosstown Blues. Nobody
would ruin himself on melancholy Crosstown, but
it was something, just the same. The horns
started: Hadley, Step-Up, and Lester, in turn,
wailing the moumful one-bar phrase, then

together. They held one, cut it off.

The Lion broke, with tingling chords. He
talked to Step-Up for a while, piano and sax
alternating and then mixing in dialogue. There
were little appreciative chortles from the faces
that crowded each other and peered over the
edge of the stage.

The horns swept it up again and carried a
chorus, fading, dying into silence. Bump took a
rimshot. The Lion rolled one, high on the
keyboard, held it, did tricks with it. He broke it,
walked his hand down the board. With the left
he reached deep down for the boogie bass.

They said that the Lion had it; everyone who
knew, who had ever heard him, said so. He had
the touch, they said: the touch of the great ones
that had gone before; the touch that twitched the
muscles and boiled the blood. There is music
that can grow only of the love of music, and its
greatest and supreme thrill is in its playing. This
the Lion knew.

He gave it back to the horns, and the yells at
the solo’s end drowned even the trumpet. He
wiped sweat from the comers of his eyes and
swiveled on the stool to watch the boys ﬁnish it
up. As his head swung, he saw the ugly smiles on
the faces of the two white men who stared up at

Adelia. 

It was midnight, fourth intermission time. The
Lion, alone, leaned against the wall outside the
stage door and watched the rain drizzling into
the alley. It pattered in the puddles and dribbled
from the roofs edge over his head. He knew that
the puddles were dirty, black with the soot and
grime of the mill town, and he grinned, singing
his song to himself.

I wake up in the momin

Black water drippin from the eaves

Bump Roxy said, “Move youh goddamn chair!”

The Lion jerked away from the wall. The voice
was so close that he was sure it spoke to him,
but when he looked around the edge of the door
he saw Bump and Adelia in the tiny vestibule

“What you talking about?” said Adelia.

“You hear what I say. I say move that goddamn
chair!”

“Why should I?”

“You know why. You know I don’t like them
men lookin’ at you,” Bump said. His ﬁngers
clenched.

“What harm that do you?”

“That’s all right. I don’t like the way you look
at them, either!”

“How can you tell how I look when you sittin’
up there behind me?” Adelia was angry now,
Rohrs realized. “You talk like you crazy. In the
ﬁrst place, I move my chair, those men move S
right with me if they want to. In the second
place, I can’t move my chair anywhere without
sittin’ right in front of somebody. You must be
out youh head.”

She stalked back toward the stage. Bump,
following, yelled, “And stay away from that
goddamn Lion, too!”

Rohrs shook his head. He thought of Step-Up
saying, “Crazy about her. Ought to tell her so
more often.” He shrugged and walked back to the
stage ﬂopping his hands loosely from the wrists,
wriggling and drooping the ﬁngers, trying to relax
them. The last set was coming up.

The last set was the big one. It was mostly
their own stuff, and it was all what they loved to
play. The fox-trotters had heard their last ballad,
and they knew it; they moved from the edges of
the hall and crowded toward the stage.

The last set had Shattered Slumber—the
shouting horns, the thunder of the drums, the
hilarious vocal dialogue between Jackson and
Shepherd. The last set had Basement Stuff, and
High Low Jack, and Adelia singing the haunting
Ride On. The crowd gulped it and howled for
more. They groped over the edge of the stage
with their hands, trying to pull more music from

Shooting Star Review

That man is great, he thought, great enough
that this white-audience business is going
to hurt him some day...

the grinning, sweating players.

Bump did a specialty. Rohrs turned and
watched admiringly. That man is great, he
thought, great enough that this white-audience
business is going to hurt him some day...

It was time for Adelia’s last song, The Man I
Love. Hadley stood up and scatted it, and the
bawl of the trumpet ﬁlled the hall, made the
Lion shiver. And Adelia sang.

The guitar carried the accompaniment alone,
and the Lion had turned to look. Oh, Jesus! he
thought...

She was singing it at the toughs, at the two
leering white men who stood directly below her.
She swayed her body, and smiled and ﬂicked her
eyes at the two men.

This is going to be bad, the Lion thought as
he had to swing back to the piano. This is going
to be hell.

And when, at the end of the number, he
fearfully turned again, what he saw was so un-
expected that he literally rubbed his eyes and
looked again. The two men were gone.

He didn’t have much time to wonder about it.
Bump called them into a huddle. He was wet all
over; he wiped his eyes and cheeks as he talked.
“Now Black Waterf’ he said hoarsely. “Black
Water, and then we got to slack it off. We got to
tone it down or they’ll never let us out of here.”

Black Water Blues was the Lion’s favorite
specialty. He had written it himself, and it was a
little poetry, and a lot of sadness, and all the old-
time blues scheme and rhythm. It was the only
thing he ever sang. He was no Cab Calloway, but
he carried a tune well enough, and he could put
the mourning in his voice.

Black water is somethin

Lord that I sure do hate
Black water is somethin

That I sure do hate

Fortune teller told me

Black water gonna be my fate

He stroked the keyboard and listened to the
soft play of the band. The thing was his and
theirs at the same time. They had taken it in;
they played it happily, lovingly. And the audience
strained forward over the lights.

I wake up in the momin
Black water in my bed

I go to eat my breakfast
Black water in my bread
Well I believe

Believe I better go my way
Black water gonna haunt me
Until my dying day

I had myself a woman

She liked to dress in red

I found her in black water
Found her lyin dead

Well I believe

Believe I’ll go far far away

Black water gonna dog me
Until that judgment day

The crowd yelled and clapped. The boys were
grinning. Jackson leaned over and hit him on the
back. Rohrs gave LeRoy the ﬂat hand sign of
approval for the guitar solo. It was all good: the
joy of playing it and the sadness of hearing it;
the way the crowd clapped and the boys grinned.

{Mrs

A stagehand stood in the wings, trying to get
Adelia’s attention. She heard his whisper and
walked to him. He said something, pointing
offstage, and she nodded and went off, out of
sight. The Lion watched her go out, wondering.

They played three more, quietly and sweetly,
tapering-off tunes to calm the audience so that
they could quit. Then it was closing time, theme
time, and Adelia had not returned. Bump was
scowling again. The Lion shook his head in
disgust. She was going too far, not being on
stage at theme time

Shooting Star Review

Clarence Jackson once told the Lion that Bump had
a sister who ran off with a white man.

The drums rolled again, and Step-Up broke. He
had ﬁnished, and Hadley was standing, when the
terriﬁed face of the stagehand appeared over the
piano. “Man! Man, there’s trouble!” He was almost
crying.

“What’s wrong?”

“End it! End it, man, quick!”

“Start the curtain down,” said the Lion, and called
out, in the singsong, syncopated voice that they used
for communicating during numbers, “Knock it off,
right now! There’s trouble brewin’!”

They stared at him, but Hadley cut the solo, and
they blew the ﬁnal blare as the curtain fell.

Then everything happened fast. The stagehand
cried out, “I didn’t mean nothin’! I didn’t know nothin’
was wrong!” and the manager, calmer, said, “Mistuh
Roxy, I'm afraid youh wife hurt ba .”

Then they all charged off and were in time to see
two stagehands carrying Adelia through the hall
backstage—Adelia with her red gown torn mostly off,
and what was left smeared and dripping with the dirty
water from the alley; Adelia crying in little gasps of
amazement and horror...

Bump Roxy roared and the stagehand ghibbered
and the manager soothed; a doctor followed the
bearers into a dressing room, and Bump plunged after
them.

“Two white men,” the guilty stagehand babbled to
the frozen band. “’1wo white men told me to ask Mrs.
Roxy come out ’n’ autograph...”

“You know you hadn’t ought to do nothin’ like
that!”

“I didn’t know nothin’ was wrong! They gimme ﬁve
dollahs. Jesus, I didn’t know nothin’ was wrong!” the
manager guided him gently away.

There was an old piano in the end of the tiny
hallway, near the dressing-room door. The Lion sat
heavily on the stool. A stack of folding chairs was
heaped against the wall; the band opened them and
sat down, lined along the hall, waiting for the door to
open.

Rohrs was staring at the keyboard when someone
touched his arm. LeRoy Brunner’s face was grave.
“You better get out of here, man.”

The Lion shook his head.

“Lion, you crazy. Don’t you know what them men
done to Adelia? It ain’t gonna be safe out here for no
white man.”

“You might be right,” said the Lion. He touched the
keys softly, hit a B-ﬂat chord.

“I tell you that man like to kill somebody,” LeRoy
said. He looked around for support.

“Let him be,” Step-Up said. “The Lion, maybe he
know what he’s doini”

“Bump gonna go for the ﬁrst white man he sees!”

“That’s all right,” the Lion said. “This way he won’t
have to go out in the street and chase one.” Old Step-
Up, he thought, he sees it, he sees it like I do. He
started to play quietly. He took a simple, four-note
walking bass ﬁgure and worked over it gently, playing
sadness. LeRoy looked around, licked his lips, and
then sat down.

The Lion played, waiting.

It was for Bump, so that he wouldn’t go raging the
streets and get arrested. But it was for more than
that; Rohrs knew it and Step-Up had seen it. It was
for the great Bump Roxy, who might never be able to
face another white audience if this wasn’t handled
right. It was for the music: for Crosstown and
Shattered Slumber, and the Black Water Blues that
might never be played again; for the grins and ﬂat-
hand signs when they ﬁnished one. It was for Adelia,
and for himself. It was for Bump Roxy and his Blue
Band.

He did not look up when the door opened and the
footsteps came out slowly and then stopped. He heard
Bump move toward him, felt -him standing directly
behind. He made himself stay loose when the huge
hand touched his shoulders and the back of his neck.

The hand did not move; it lay there gently. He did
not let himself sigh; he sat and played the blues. He
did not look up even when the hand began to
tremble and he heard the ugly, harsh sobs.

The chords rippled the stillness of the room.

As Benjamin Lee Whorf
(Language, Thought and
Reality), and Stuart
Chase found, “There is
no one metaphysical pool
of universal thought.
Thinking is relative to the
language learned.”

Building on this premise,
Broadway and Emmy-
nominated director Gilbert
Moses says,

“Ignorances, unfounded
myths and unchallenged
assumptions about the
African-American are
hidden in the language of
the American people.

“Left to us is the
enormous task of
changing and enriching
the American language;
of filtering out the myths
grounded in shoddy, and
yes, perhaps even
perverse, intellectualism;
and the exhilaration of
creating myths of our

own.”

These two poems are from a
beautifully done collection called
ROUTES. The poetry is by James
Strecker in collaboration with Bill
Smith, a photographer long involved
with the visual representation of
music and musicians.

B.B. King, who presented the
foreward to Routes said, “...
thinking about you who might read
this book, it’s going to be a

treat. The book is good.”

Strecker has published widely in
Canadian literary periodicals and
is_ an English Instructor for
Sheridan College in Oakville His
previous books of poetry include
two general collections, Corkscrew
and Bones to Bury. Strecker has
also done two collaborations with
the artist Harold Town called
Black, also a tribute to black jazz
musicians, and Pas de Vingt on
ballet.

Bill Smith’s photography has been
exhibited at the Museum of Modern
Art and he co-produced the award-
winning documentary ﬁlm Imagine
the Sound.

Routes is published by Image

Publishing, Hamilton, Ontario,

Canada. B.B. King was right Their book
is a treat.
