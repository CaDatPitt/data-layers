Directions for forming a. good style.

Style is the peculiar manner in which a man expresses
his thoughts.

The requisites of a good style are perspicuity and orna-
ment.

By perspicuity is meant clearness to the mind, easiness
to he understood, and freedom from obscurity and ambi-
guity.

Ornament in style consists in the use of ﬁgurative lan--
guage, (see page 46th, lesson 24th, &c.) the adaptation of
the sound to the sense, and the selection of such expres-
sions as are harmonious and pleasing to the ear.

In most treatises on rhetorick, twelve kinds* of style are
described, namely, The CONCISE, xDIFFUSE, NERVOUS, FEE-

 

*rThe ﬁrst four kinds above mentioned, are founded on the de-
gree of perspicuity,-—the next ﬁve. relate to the omament,——and the
the last three refer to the ideas which the author intends to convey.

104 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN .

BLE, DRY, PLAIN, NEAT, ELEGANT, FLOWERY, SIMPLE, AF-
FECTED and vEHEMEN'I‘.*

To acquire a" good style, the following directions. are giv-
en by Dr. Blair.

1. Study clear ideas of the subjecton which you are to
write or speak. ’ - .

2. Compose frequently and with care.

3. Make yourself acquainted with the style of the best
authors. S

4. Avoid a serivile imitation of any author whatever.

5. Adapt your style to the subject, and to those to
whom it is addressed.

6. Let not attention to style he so devoted, as to pre-
vent a higher degree of attention to the thoughts.

RHYME.

The following rules in“ relation to rhyme, should be fa-
miliar to those who wish to write or judge of verse.

1'. The two corresponding syllables of a rhyme must
begin their consonance with the accented vowel, and pre-
serve it through the remaining letters. ,

Thus, text and vext, song and 1022.2“ echo with one anoth-
er respectively, in the sounds ext and (mg.

2. The sounds and not the letters, constitute the rhyme,
Thus, reign. and plain, t/zroug/t and hue, though different
to the eye, form an unobjectionable rhyme.

3. The letter, or letters in the syllable which precede
the accented vowel, must not be the same in each, other-
Wise the consonance would be disagreeable to the ‘ear.

Hence tend and the last syllable of contend, make a
bad rhyme. »

[After the teacher has explained the different kinds of
versiﬁcation, it will be a useful exercise for the pupil to put
words’ together in the form of verses, either in rhyme or
otherwise, without regard to any thing more than accent

 

*As these exercises are not designed to supply the place ofa
treatise on rhetorick, the learner is referred to his teacher, or to some
treatise for an explanation of the various kinds of style mentioned
above. An imitation of‘ the various styles is recommended to all who
Wish to acquire ease in writing.

and quantity. This exercise, which properly belongs to
prosody, will be more advantageously pursued, after the
pupil has had some practice in composition ,= when perhaps
he will be tempted to unite ideas with his words, and at-
tempt to write his themes or compositions in verse. The
teacher cannot be too particular in explaining the diﬂ"er-
ence between poetry, and rhyme or verse. Young persons
are very apt to consider them as synonymous terms. The
pupil should be led to understand that good poetry requires
something more than smooth numbers and harmonious
rhymes. As poetry is the offspring of the imagination, ﬁg-
urative language must formya large proportion of its dress]

CRITICISM.

The ﬁrst requisites of an exercise are that the sentences
be clearly and distinctly written, and the words correctly
spelt. Attention then must he paid to the syntax, more
especially to the use of relatives and other words, used for

transition and connexion.

The structure of the sentences then must be regarded,
and the rules of cle-arness, unity, strength and harmony
be observed.‘ The style must be suited to the subject,—-
and lastly, nothing must be introduced at variance with
truth, or with morals.

EPISTOLARY WRITING.

It will be useful for the teacher to give some instructions
to the pupil in relation to writing letters, notes or billets.
It is not thought expedient to devote a lesson to the sub-
ject in this book;*‘ but the teacher should show him the
proper manner of dating, addressing, folding and sealing.
In addressing notes to several persons of the same name
and family, there seems to be a general misunderstanding
whether the name or the title should be pluralized. Thus,
ifa note is to be addressed to several ladies of the name of
Brown, by some, the note would be directed to The Miss
Browns; and by others, to The Misses Brown. In like
manner the address, L0 The Mr. Brow/ts and the Messrs.
Brown prevail respectively with different individuals. Now

* It will be proﬁtable as an exercise in epistolary writing, for the
teacher to require the pupil to write a billet or letter addressed eith-
er to a ﬁctitious or real person, announcing some event, or on any
subject assigned.

106 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN

in order to ascertain which of these is the most proper, we
must recollect that every title is expressed in an elliptical
form. When we say John the Apostle, we mean John 20/L0
was the Apostle; when we say Miss Brown, we mean the
Miss who is calferl Brown, or the Miss by the name of
Brown. This view of the subject seems to determine the
propriety of the address to The Misses Brown ; The
Messrs. Brown, &c.

SUGGESTIONS

.Wit/3 regard to the rneclzanicczl ervecution of written ex-
ercises, and the mode of correcting them.

1. No exercise should be received from a pupil, which
is not fairly copied with all his skill; for negligence in the
mechanical execution will induce neglect of the more im-
portant qualities.

‘2. The pupil should be required to leave the alternate
pages of his paper blank; either to make room for the
corrections; or, to make a clean transcript after the cor-
rections have been made. The original and the corrected
exercises will then face each other, and the writing over
the theme a second time will imprint the corrections in the
pupil’s mind.

3. When the subject of composition is assigned to pu-
pils in clases, it is recommended that a uniformity be re-
quired in the size and quality of the paper,—that the name
(real or ﬁctitious) of the writer, together with the date and
number of the composition be placed conspicuously on the
back of the exercise. The writing should be of a plain
kind so that no room being left for display or ﬂourish, the
principal attention of each pupil may be devoted to the lan-
guage and sentiments of his performance.

4. No abbreviations should be allowed; and neglect of
punctuation and errours in spelling should be particularly
noticed.

5. In correcting an exercise, the teacher should en-
deavour to give the pupil’s thought a proper turn, rather
than to change it for one more accurate; for it is the pu-
pil’s idea which ought to be “ iaug/it /1071) to shoot.” An
idea thus humoured, will thrive much better in the mind
than one which is not a native ofthe soil.

6. He should accommodate his corrections to the style
of the pupil’s own production. An aim at too great correct-
ness may possibly cramp the genius too much, by rendering

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. I07

the pupil timid and diﬂident; or perhaps discourage him
altogether, by producing absolute despair of arriving at
any degree of perfection. For this reason, the teacher
shouldshow the pupil where he has erred, either in the
thought, the structure of the sentence, the syntax or the
choice of words. Every alteration, as has already been ob-
served, should diﬁ'er as little as possible from what the pu-
pil has written; as giving an entire new cast to the thought
and expression will lead him into an unknown path not
easy to follow, and divert his mind from that original line
of thinking which is natural to him.

LESSON V.

VARIETY on EXPRESSION.

A very common error of pupils just commencing compo-
sition, is the frequent and unnecessary use of the conjunc-
tion and. The following eXampl'es will show, that the
use of the present or perfectparticiple will correct this
fault. ‘

MODEL, with the present participle.

He descended from his throne, and ascended the scaffold, and
said, “ Live, incomparable-pair.”

Better thus: Descending from his throne, and ascending the
scaffold, he said, &c. ‘

Or thus: He descended from his throne, and ascending the
scaffold, said, 840. '

Or thus: He descended from his throne, and ascended the scaf-

ANALYSIS, Of COMPOUND SENTENCES.

Analysis means the separation of the parts, of which a
thing is, composed.

A compound_sentence is composed of several simple sen-
tences, joined together by conjunctions, pronouns, or other
connecting words. -

To analyze a compound sentence, (or the analysis ofa
compound sentence) means to separate the simple sentences
and phrases of which it is composed; and it is performed
by omitting the connecting words, and supplying the words
which were omitted in the connexion.

SYNTHESIS OF SIMPLE SENTENCES.

Synthesis is the reverse Of Analysis,‘ and is here used to
signify the union of several simple sentences, to form a
compound sentence. -

In the composition of simple sentences, there must be
an ellipsis, or omission of those words, which occur more
than once in the simple sentences of which it is composed;

and conjunctions, pronouns, or other connecting words,_
substituted for them.

The pupil must take particular care, that the pronouns, verbs,&c.
be of the right number, person and gender. This caution is the

more necessary, because young persons frequently make mistakes
in these respects.

A recollection of the rules relating to the UNITY of a sentence,
will be needed in this lesson ; particularly the first two: namely,
that “ During the course of the sentence, the subject, or nominative
case, should be changed as little as possible ;” and that “Ideas
which have so little connexion that they may well be divided into two
or more sentences, should never be crowded into one.

MODEL.

Simple sentences to be united in a compound sentence.

Man is a rational animal.

Man considers triﬁes as the principal object of desire in this ﬂeet-
ing world. '

PREFACE-

Two great obstacles beset the pupil in his ﬁrst attempts
at composition. The zﬁrst is the difﬁculty of obtaining
ideas, (or learning to think;) the second is that of express-
ing them properly when obtained. In this volume the Author
has endeavoured toafford some assistance to the pupil in over-
coming these pdiﬂiculties, It is not unfrequently the case
that the scholar is discouraged in the very onset, and the
teacher, from the vyant of a regular and progressive system,
ﬁnds his labours unsuccessful, and his requisitions met with
reluctance, if not with opposition. The simplicity of the
plan here proposed, requires no laboured explanation, The
first exercise or lesson consists in giving the pupil a Word,
or a number of words, and instead of asking for a deﬁnition
of them, requiring him to use them in a sentence or idea of
his 07,072..”-* From this simple exercise he is led onward through
a series of Lessons in easy and regular progression, from the
simplest principles to the most diﬁicult practice. After the
principle of each lesson is stated, (and, When necessary, ex»
plained,) a “MODEL ” is presented, which is designed to show
the pupil how the exercise is to be perforrned. The EXAM-
PLES FOR PRACTICE furnish him with the materials with
which he is expected to perform his exercise. The teacher

preference is expressed for a ‘written exercise, yet several of’ the
early lessons may be read from the book, at the discretion» of the
teacher. For some suggestions on the mechanical execution of
written exercises, and the mode of correcting them, the teacher is
referred to the close of the volume.

Honour and shame from no condition rise;
Act well your part; there all the honour lies.

Like birds whose beauties languish half concealed
Till mounted on the wing, their glossy plumes,

Expanded shine with azure, green and gold,

How blessings brighten as they take their ﬂight.

I am monarch of all I survey,

My right there is none to dispute ;
From the centre all round to the sea,
I am lord of the fowl and the brute.

0, Solitude ! where are the charms,
That sages have seen in thy faces’!
Better dwell in the midst of alarms;
Than reign in this horrible place.

Sweet was the sound when oft at evening’s close,
Up yonder hill the village murmur rose.

Here rests his head upon the lap of earth,
A youth to fortune and to fame unknown.

And melancholy marked ‘him for her own.

And seize the pleasures of the present day.
Live, while you live, the sacred preacher cries,
And give to God each moment as it ﬂies.

I live in pleasure, when I live to thee.

8. Oh, for a lodge in some vast wilderness,
Some boundless coritinuity of shade,
Where rumour of oppression and deceit,
Of unsuccessful or successful war,

LESSON XVI".

ARRANGEMENT, OR CLASSIFICATION.

The pupil is to he required in thistlesson to arrange or classify a.
subject assigned. Thus, if a chapter of Proverbs, for instance, be as-
signed him to classify, he will put all the verses together which be-
long tothe same subject; such as similar characters, similarﬂvirtues,
conditions of life, &c. The following Model exhibits a classiﬂbation
of some of the verses of the 11th chapter of Proverbs.*

MODEL.

Verses relating to the rightebus man.

The integrity of the upright shall guide them.

The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way.

The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them. .

The righteous is delivered out of trouble.

When it goeth Well with the righteous the city rejoiceth.

By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted.

To him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.
Righteousness tendeth to life; such as are upright in their way

are the Lord’s delight.

*In estimating the merit of an exercise of this kind, that one should be preferred
which leaves the smallest number of verses unclassiﬁed.

32 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN

The seed of the righteous shall be delivered. The desire of the
righteous is only good.

The righteous shall ﬂourish as a branch.

The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life.

Behold the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth.

Righteousness delivereth from death. Through knowledge shall
the just be delivered. s

EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.

1. The pupil may now classify the remaining verses of the same
chapter, by selecting the Verses which relate to The wicked, or
unjust, The wise, The liberal, The z'llibe7'al, &c. 87:0.

2. The pupil may then take a sentence assigned by the Teacher,
and classify the Words in it, by arranging them under the following
heads : namely, 1st, Such as signify things; 2d, Such as signify
qualities; 3d, Such as signify circumstances ; 4th, Such as signify
relations ; 5th, Such as signify connexion ; 6th, Such as signify ac-
tions, together with such other classes as he can discover.

3. Another exercise of the same kind, will be furnished by classi-
fying the different animals, beasts, birds, ﬁshes, insects, 8:0. which
the'pupil,has seen, or about which he has read. For instance, he
may Write a list of those animals with which he is acquainted that
have four feet, called quadrupeds ; then of those which have
but two, then of‘ those which have none. 2dly, Those which have
horns, that chew the cud, 810.

4. The pupil may now classify the books ofa Library according
to their subjects.

5. The words of a language.

6. The articles of furniture in a. house.

7. Tools used for cutting.

8. , Tools used for cultivating the earth, mentioning for what
each is intended.

9. The different sorts of vegetables.

JV‘ote to Teachers.

The utility of‘. this lesson may be questioned by some, on account
of its apparent diﬂiculty. As it is designed to lead the pupil to think,
and on that account is not alien to the subject of composition, it is in-
serted, in the hope that a fair trial will'be 1nade,before it is wholly

neglected. Nopupil can be taught to parse, without learning to

classify.

LESSON XVII.

DEFINITION, AND DISTINCTION, OR DIFFERENCE.

The pupil may write in his own language a deﬁnition of
the following words, accordiig to the manner pointed out
by the model.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 33

MODEL.

Elastick.

When a thing is of such a nature that on being bent, or compressed,
itreturns to its former state, it is said to be elastick. Thus a bow,
India rubber, the air, are elastick substances.

EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.

Eternal, Inﬁnite, Omnipotent, Omnipresent, lncarcerate,
Explanation, Demonstrated, Indivisible, lnevitable, Incom-
prehensible, lnspissated, Evaporate, Justice, Mercy, Virtue,
Vice, Honesty.

T/ze diyference or distinction between two words may some-
times be shown by an analysisi of each.

MODEL.

The difference between the Capital and the Capitol of a country.

The Capital is the chief city where the legislature meet to enact
laws, &c. A

The Capitol is the building in which they assemble.

The Capital contains the Capitol. ,

The different parts of the Capital are streets, lanes, squares, alleys,
courts, houses, &c.

The different parts of‘ the Capitol are halls, rooms, closets, ﬁre-
places, doors, windows, stairs, chimneys, cellar, &c.

The Capital is generally several miles in length.

The Capitol is seldom more than one or two hundred feet.

The pupil may now show by an analysis, the difference between
the following words:

1. A bird and a beast. 8. Geography and Grammar.
2. A ﬁsh and a bird. . 9. A bed and a sofa.

3. A reptile and aquadrup‘ed. ,, 10. A ﬁeld angd a garden.

4. A clock and a watch. . . .....1].. A horse and a cow.

5. An adverb and an adjective. , 12. A falsehood and a mistake.
6; A verb and a noun. 13. A ﬁsh and a beast.

7. A pen and a pencil. 14. Mercy and justice.

 

* The pupil should be directed to give an instance of the proper
application of the word, after he has explained its meaning.

LESSON VIII.

ANALOGY, OR RESEMBLANCE.

Analogy means a resemblance between two or more
things in some circumstances, which in other respects are
entirely different. Thus-there is an analogy between a
ship and a carriage; because a ship is designed to carry
us over the water, and a carriage to carry us over the land.
But in their shape and construction they are entirely differ-
ent.

MODEL.

There is a close analogy between the wings ofa bird and the ﬁns
ofa. ﬁsh. The former enables the feathered tribe to move aloft in
the air. The latter empowers the inhabitants of the deep to pursue
their course through the water. The one is provided with strong
sinews to act on the air, the other with equal power to impress the
Wave; while each is moved with equal facility in the element for
which it is designed.

EXAMPLES FOR. PRACTICE.

The pupil may now describe the analogy between tll6f0l-
lowing words .-

1 The wings ofa bird and the legs of an animal.
2 The wheels of a carriage and the sails of a vessel.
3 The art of painting and the art of writing.
4. Snow,and rain.

5. Genius and the sun.
6. Intoxication and insanity.

'7.‘ Darkness and aﬂliction.

8 A watch and an animal.

9 Prosperity and brightness.

10. A tree and an animal.

11. Food and education.

12. The gills ofa ﬁsh andthe lungs of an animal.

LESSONAXIX.

TAU FOLOGY.

Tautology means the repetition of a word or idea in a
sentence ; and is a fault that should always be avoided.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 35

iWhen the tautology is in a word, it may be corrected
by substituting a word of similar meaning; but when it
consists in the idea, it should be wholly omitted.

MODEL.

He went to Liverpool in the packet, and then went to London in
his carriage.

Same sentence with the tautology corrected.

He Went to Liverpool in the packet, and then proceeded to Lon-
dog in his carriage.

EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.

The pupil may now correct the taatology in the following
sentences.

]. The sun shines by day, and the moon and stars
shine by night. i

2. The circumstances which I told to John, he told to
his brother, who -told them to the General.

3. The Colonel orderedilthe subordinate oﬂicers to or-
der their troops to come to order.

4. The ﬁrst day was spent in forming rules of order,
and the second day was spent in presenting resolutions.

5. The birds were clad in their brightest plumage, and
the trees were clad in their richest verdure.

6. Grammar teaches us to speak properly and write cor-
rectly, and geography teaches us the various divisions of the

earth. Grammar is divided into four parts, and geography
divides the earth into a number of grand divisions.

7. Notwithstanding the rapidity with which time passes
away, men pass their lives in triﬂes and follies ;'.although
reason and religion declare, that notga moment should pass
without bringing something to pass. .

8. It is folly to endeavour to arm ourselves ‘against
those trials and difficulties which no arms can overcome.

9. The brightness of the sun brightens every object ‘on
which it shines. The brightness of prosperity, shining on
the anticipations of futurity, casts the shadows of adversity
into the shade, and causes the prospects of the future to
look bright.

A short story or tale being presented to the pupil, and
an outlineof the same given in different language, he is re-
quired to ﬁll it up in such a manner as to exhibit the same
narration in a variety of expression.

MODEL.

Poetus was condemned to die; but was permitted to choose the
manner in which the sentence should be executed. Arria. his Wife,
exhorting him to quit life courageously, drew a dagger which she

seeing him break into an orchard, he asked him at night
Where he had been. The boy replied, in school. Trajan
was so offended with this falsehood, that neither the Da-

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 39

Plancus made his appearance, and offered himself to death.
This generosity of Plancus made the Triumvirspardon him.
They said, Plancus only was worthy of so good servants, and the
servants only were worthy of so good a master.
Same, in a connected narrat2"ve.

Plancus, a Roman citizen, being proscribed by the Triumvirs,
Antony, Lepidus, and Octavius, was forced to abscond. His slaves,
though put to the torture, refused to discover him. New torments
being prepared,—-to prevent farther distress to servants that were so
faithful to him, Plaucus appeared, and offered his throat to the
syvordstof the executioners. An example so noble, of mutual affec-
tion betwixt a master and his slaves,'procured a pardon to Plancus ;
and Rome declared, that Plancus only was worthy of so good
servants, and they only were worthy of so good a master.

EXAMPLES FOR. PRACTICE.

The pupil will now write a corrected narrative from the
following detached sentences.

1.

The city of the Falerii was besieged by Camillus, gen-
eral of the Romans. ,

A schoolmaster decoyed the children of the principal cit-
izens into the Roman camp.

He told Camillus that the possession of these children
would soon make the citizens surrender to him.

Camillus told him, the Romans loved courage, but hated
treachery.

He ordered the school master to have his hands bound,
and to be whipped back into the city by the boys.

The citizens were charmed with this generous behaviour
of Camillus, and immediately submitted to the Romans.

2.

Calais revolted from the English, and was retaken by
Edward III. In "revenge for their treachery, he ordered
them to choose six citizens to be put to death.

While all were struck with horror at this sentence, Eus-
tace de St. Pierre offered himself for one.

Five more soon joined him; and they came With halters
about their necks to Edward.

He ordered them to be executed ; but his queen pleaded
so powerfully for them, that he pardoned them.

The queen not only entertained them sumptuously in
her own tent, but sent‘ them back loaded with presents.

iv PREFASE.

will ﬁnd no difficulty in supplying the deﬁciency, if the
EXAMPLES are not sufficiently numerous in some cases, or in
omitting what may be superﬂuous in others. If, on
the ﬁrst inspection, any of the Lessons appear too
diﬂicult, the Author respectfully requests the tests of
trial and experience before they are condemned. They have
been performed, and _the Models of some of those apparently
the most diﬂicult, were written by pupils in the school of
which he has the charge.

The Author is encouraged to believe that the plan Will be
favourably received, if it leadsthe pupil to think, or removes
any of the diﬂiculties which lie in the way of those who are
just turning their attention to Composition. Justice requires
the acknowledgement that some hints have been derived, and
some extracts have been taken from Walker’s Teachers’ As-
sistant, Booth’s Principles of English Composition, and Jar-
dine’s Outlines of a Philosophical Education; but the plan,
and the general features of the Work, are believed to be new.

The book is designed as the Sequel to a Grammar which
Will shortly be published, on a plan, in some respects, differ-
ent ﬁ°om any now in use. It therefore presupposes some
acquaintance with syntax; although the practical exercises
under most of the Lessons, can be performed with tolerable
facility by those, wh.o have but a slender knowledge of any
part of Grammar.

NARRAITION AMPLIFIEI5.

The following particulars are generally embraced in nar-
rations: viz. 1. The description* of the place, or scene
of the actions related. 2. The description of the persons
concerned in the narration. 3. The time, place, posture,
state of mind, associations or trains of thought, of the cir-
cumstances and individuals mentioned. In ampliﬁed or
extended narrations, the pupil must be particularly careful
that his sentences are clear, and that the connectives are
properly applied. In this Lesson a short narration is pre-
sented for the pupil to amplify, or enlarge. The model
presents several degrees of ampliﬁcation, and it is recom~
mended to the teacher to require similar degrees from the
pupil. The EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE in the Qtlt/2, and 2133

Short narrative.

Damon having been condemned to death by Dionysius, ob-

pledging his life for his return on the day of execution. He faith-
fully returned,and Dionysius was so pleased with their mutual at-
pachment, that he not only pardoned them, but took them both into

avour.

* Description is made the subject of a subsequent lesson.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 41

Same story ampliﬁed.

Damon and Pythias were intimate friends. Damon, being con-
demned to death by Dionysius, the tyrant, demanded liberty to go
home to set his affairs in order 3 and l11S friend offered himself to be
his surety, and to spbmittltl) death  shoultd no; return. Eviry
one was in expecta ion w a Won (1 e e even an every one e-
gan to condemn Pythias for so rash an action : but he, conﬁdent of
the integrity of his friend, waited the appointed time with alacrity.
Damon strict to his engagement returned at the appointed time.
Dionysius, admiring their mutual, ﬁdelity, pardoned Damon, and
prayed to have the friendship of two such Worthy men.

Same story more ampliﬁed.

Damon, being condemned to death" by. Dionysius, tyrant of Syra-
cuse, obtained liberty to visit his wife and children; leaving his
friend Pythias as a pledge for his return, on condition that, if he fail-
ed, Pythias should suffer in his stead. Damon not appearing at the
time appointed, the tyrant had the curiosity to visit Pythias in prison.
“ What a fool were you,” said he, “ to rely on D-amon’s promise! How
could you imagine that he would sacriﬁce his life for you, or for any
man 3” “ My Lord,” said Pythias, with a firm voice and noble aspect,
“ I would suffer a. thousand deaths rather’ than my friend should fail
in any article of honour: He cannot fail; I am as confident of his
virtue, as of my own existence. But I beseech the gods to preserve
his life : Oppose him, ye winds; disappoint his eagerness, and suffer
him not to arrive till my death has saved a life of much greater con-
sequence than mine, necessary to his lovely Wife, to his little inno-
cents, to his friends, to his country. 0! let me not die the cruelest
of deaths in that of my friend.” Dionysius Was‘ confounded and
awed witl1 the magnanimity of these sentiments: He wished to
speak : He hesitated : He looked down; and retired in silence. The
fatal day arrived. Pythias was brought forth; and, with an air
of satisfaction, walked to the place of execution. He ascended the
scaffold and addressed the people : “ My prayers are hea.rd 3 the
gods are propitious; the winds have been contrary; Damon could
not conquer impossibilities; he will be here tomorrow, and my blood
shall ransom that of my friend.” As he pronounced these words, a.
buzz arose, a distant voice was heard, the crowd caught the words,
and “ Stop, stop the execution !” was repeated by every person. A
man came at full speed. In the same instant he Was off his horse,
on the scaffold, and in the arms of Pythias. “ You are safe,” he
cried; “ you are safe, you are safe, my friend! The gods be praised,

' you are safe.” Pale, cold, and half‘ speechless, in the arms of his Da-

mon, Pythias replied in broken accents : “ Fatal haste-—-cruel impa-
tience——What envious powers have wrought impossibilities against
your friend! But I will not be wholly disappointed: Since I cannot
die to save you, I will die to accompany you.” Dionysius heard
and beheld with astonishment : his eyes were opened, his heart was
touched, and he could no longer resist the power of virtue. He de-
scended from his throne, and ascended the scaffold. “ Live, live, ye
incomparable pair! ye have demonstrated the existence of virtue ;
and consequently of a God who rewards it. Live happy, live re-
nowned ; and as you have invited me by your example, form me
by your precepts to particilpptg worthily of a friendship so divine.”

42 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN

The same story still more ampliﬁed.

When Damon was sentenced by Dionysius of Syracuse to die on :2
certain day, he begged permission, in the interim, to retire to his own
country to set the affairs of his disconsolate family in order. This
the tyrant intended peremptorily to refuse, by granting it, as he con-
ceived, on the impossible condition of his procuring some one to re-
main as hostage for his return, under equal forfeiture of life. Pythiasi
heard the conditions, and did not wait for an application upon the part
ot Damon ; he instantly offered himself as security for his friend:
Which being accepted, Damon was immediately set at liberty. The
king and all the courtiers Were astonished at this action ; and, there-
fore, when the day of execution drew near, the tyrant had the curi-
osity to visit Pythias in his conﬁnement. After some conversation
on the subject of friendship, in which the tyrant delivered it as his
opinion, that self-interest was the sole mover of human actions: as
for virtue, friendship, benevolence, love of one’s country, and the
like, he looked upon them as terms invented by the wise to keep in
awe and impose upon the Weak. “ My Lord,” said Pythias, with a
ﬁrm voice and noble aspect, “ I would it Were possible that I might
suffer a thousand deaths, rather than my friend should fail in any ar-
ticle of his honour! He cannot fail therein, my lord : I am as conﬁ-
dent of his virtue as I am of my own existence. But I pray, I beseech
the gods to preserve the life and integrity of my Damon together.
Oppose him, ye winds! prevent the eagerness and impatience of his
honourable endeavours, and suffer him not to arrive, till by my death
I have redeemed a life a thousand times of more consequence, of
more value than my own; more estimable to his lovely wife, to his
precious little innocents, to his friends, to his country. 0 leave me
not to die theworst ofdeaths in that of my friend!” Dionysius was
awed and confounded by the dignity of these sentiments, and by the
manner in which they were uttered: he felt his heart struck by a
slight sense of invading truth; but it served rather to perplex than
undeceive him. The fatal day arrived ; Pythias was brought forth, and
Walked amidst the guards with a serious, but satisﬁed air, to the place
of execution.___ Dionysius Was already there; he was exalted on a

moving throne that was drawn by six white horses, and sat pensive
and attentive to the prisoner. Pythias came; he vaulted lightly on
the scaffold, andybeholding for a time the apparatus of his death, he
turned with a placid countenance, and addressed the spectators:
“My prayers are heard,” he cried ; the gods are propitious 3 you know,
my friends, that the Winds have been contrary till yesterday. Da-
mon could not come ; he could not conquer impossibilities: he will
be here tomorrow; and the blood which is shed to day shall have
ransomed the life of my friend. 0! could I erase from your bosoms
every doubt, every mean suspicion of the "honour of the man for
Whom I am about to suffer, I should go to my death even as I would
to my Wedding. Be it sufficient, in the mean time, that my friend
will be found noble; that his truth is unimpeachable; that he will
speedily prove it; that he is -now on his way, hurrying on, accusing
himself, the adverse elements, and fortune ; but I haste to prevent
his speed :—Executioner, do your ofﬁce.” As he pronounced the
last Words, a buzz began to rise among the remotest of the people; .a.
distant voice washeard-—-the crowd caught -the words, and “Stop,

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 43

stop the execution !” was repeated by the whole assembly. A man
came at full speed; the throng gave way to his approach: he was
mounted on a steed that almost ﬂew : in an instant he was off his
horse, on the scaffold, and held Pythias straightly embraced. “ You
are safe,” he cried; “ you are safe, my friend, my dearest friend!
the gods be praised, you are safe! I now have nothing but death to
suffer, and am delivered from the anguish of those reproaches which
I gave myself for having endangered a life so much dearer than my
own.” Pale, cold, and half speechless in the arms of his Damon,
Pythias replied in broken acce,nts—-—“ Fatal haste !-—Cruel impa-

LESSON XXIII.

DESCRIPTION.

Description may in most cases be considered as an ampliﬁed deﬁ-
nition. The want of lzabits of observation, frequently renders it
difficult for the pupil to give a correct description. He is often at a
loss how to approach the subject, where to begin, and what particu-
lars to enumerate. Within the compass ofa single lesson, it is not pos-
sible to give such directions, as will apply to all the various subjects,
which are embraced in this kind of writing. But to afford some as-
sistance to the beginner, the following hints are offered. It is not ex-
pected that he will take them in the order in which they stand; much
less that all of them should,in all cases,»be.embraced in the same exer-
cise. If he is to describe a sensible object, he may notice the subjoin-
ed particulars, in any orderconsistent with a‘ proper classiﬁcation.

1. The time when, and place where it exists, or was seen.

2.. The purpose for which it is designed, its -name, uses and con-
veniences. '

3. Its novelty or antiquity, general or particular existence.
4. Its ﬁgure or form, and position, together with an analysis of its
arts. '
P 5. Its resemblance to any other object.

6. Its size, colour, beauty, or Want of it.

7. The persons or artists by whom it was made. .

8.. Materials of which it wasmade, and the tnannerin which it
is constructed. .

9. - Its effects on mankind by increasing or abridging their com-
fort, &c. .

10. The feelings or reﬂections which it excited.

11. Its connexion with any other subject.

Description of Pompeyﬁs pillar.

(1.'*) In visiting Alexandria, what most engages the attention of
travellers is the pillar of Pompey, as it is commonly called ; situated
at a quarter of a league from the southern gate. (8.) It is compos-
ed of red granite,a hard kind of stone, variegated with black and white
spots, and very common in Egypt and Arabia.  The capital or
uppermost part of the column‘ is of the Corinthian order of architec-
ture, the palm leaves composing the volutes not being indented, be-
cause of the height for which they were destined, Which would ren-
der the indentation invisible to the spectator below.  The shaft,
or ma.in body of the pillar, together with the upper part of the base or
foundation, is composed of one entire block of marble, ninety feet long,
and nine in diameter. (4. &L8.) The base is a square of about ﬁfteen
feet on each side. This block of marble, sixty feet in circumference,
rests on two layers of stone, bound together with lead.  The
whole column is one hundred and fourteen feet high. It is perfectly
Well polished, and only a little shivered on the eastern side. There
Was originally a statue on this pillar, one foot and ankle of which are
still remaining. The statue must have been of gigantick size, to
have appeared of a man’s proportions at so great a height. To the
eye below, the capital does not appear capable of holding more than
one man upon it; but it has been found that it could contain no
less than eight persons very conveniently. Nothing can equal the

majesty of this monument. Seen from a distance it overtops the

town, and serves as a signal for vessels. (10.) Approaching it near-
er it produces an astonishment mingled with awe. One can never be
tired with admiring the beauty of, the capital, the length of the shaft,
and the extraordinary simplicity of the pedestal.  The purpose
for which this splendid monument was designed, (1,) the time when it
was raised, and (7,) the artist by Whom it was planned and executed, are
all equally involved in obscurity.  History throws no light Which
can penetrate Egyptian darkness; nor can tradition aver any thing
certain with regard to it. (2,) By some, it is thought to have been erect-
ed in honour of Pompey; who, ﬂying from Caesar after the battle of
Pharsalia, was basely assassinated, in this place. But the more probable
opinion is, that it was raised in gratitude to the emperor Severus, who
had conferred great favours on the inhabitants of Alexandria. (II.)
The pillar of Pompey, or of Severus, call it by which name you will,

, is a standing monument of the perfection attained by the ancients in

all the arts on which the science of architecture depends; and proves,
beyond dispute, that in what respects soever the moderns may have
surpassed the ancients, yet in grandeur of design, boldness in execu-
tion, taste, richness and elegance of combination, they must yield the
superiority.

life, &c. and in an ampliﬁed history, represent his subject in ﬁctitious
scenes.

     

LESSON XXIV.

FIGURATIVE LANGUAGE.

“lords that belong to one class of objects are frequently
applied to other classes. Thus the words morning and
evening properly belong to the day; but as they signify the
ﬁrst and last parts, they are also applied to other subjects.
Thus, the phrase, the morning of life is often used for
youth; and the evening of life for old age. This is what
is called a ﬁgure of speech.

Figures of speech always denote some departure from
simplicity of expression ; they represent in a forcible man-
ner, the idea which we intend to express, and present it
with the addition of some circumstance which renders the
impression more strong and vivid. Thus when we say, “ A
good man enjoys comfortin the midst of adversity,” we ex-
press an idea in the simplest manner possible. But as
there is an analogyii between comfort. and light, and between

‘adversity and darkness, we may express the same idea in

ﬁgurative language, thus: “ To the upright there ariseth
light in darkness.” Here a new circumstance is introduc-
ed ; two objects, resembling one another in some respects,
are presented to the imagination ; light is put in the place
of comfort, and darlmess is used to suggest the idea of ad-
versity.

Figures are divided into two kinds or classes, ﬁgures of
Words, and ﬁguresof thought.

Figures of words are called TROPES.

Figures of thought are called METAPHOES.

The word Trope, signiﬁes a turning; and Metaphor,
transferring.

* See Lesson 18th, which is incorrectly numbered 8th.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 47

ATROPE is the change or turning of a word from its
original signiﬁcation. ,

Thus, in the sentence already adduced, “ To the upright
there arisethlight in darkness,” the». trope consists in “ light
and darkness” being changed, or turned from their usual
meaning, and employed to signify “ comfort and adversity ;”
on account of some resemblance or analogy, which they are
supposedto bear to those conditions of life.

A .lV_lETAPHOR is a ﬁgure, in which the Words are used in
their original signiﬁcation ; but the idea which they convey
is transferred from the subject to which it properly belongs,
to some other which it resembles. Thus, when we say of
a man, “He is the pillar of the state,” we use the word pil-
lar in its common acceptation; but the idea ofsupport, which
a pillar implies, is transferred from a building, to the state ;
and our meaning is, that the man, by hiswisdom or pru-
dence, contributes as much to the safety and security of
the nation, as a pillar, by its strength and solidity, does to
the stability of a building.

Tropes and metaphors so closely resemble each other,
that it is not always easy, noris it important, to be able to
distinguish the one from the other. '

In this lesson, ﬁgurative language is presented to the pun
pil, which he is to convert into plain.

MODELS.
Figurative language: A poor hind nursed in the lap of igno-
rance.

Same idea in plain language .- A poor hind who had never been

For e’en our fallen fortunes lay

In light.
18. Rising from thy hardy stock,

Thy sons the tyrant’s frown shall mock,
And slavery’s galling chains unlock,
And free the oppressed.
All, who the wreath of freedom twine,
Beneath the shadow of their vine
Are blest.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 49

LESSON XXV.

The previous lesson having introduced the pupil to ﬁgurative ex-
pressions, the object of this is, to lead him to form similar language
himself. He will recollect that analogy or resemblance is its foun-
dation; and When, therefore, he is required to convert plain into ﬁg-
urative terms, he must endeavour to call to mind some other subject
which resembles the one proposed for his exercise. In applying the
terms, phrases and ideas relating to one subject, to another that re-
sembles it, or in other words in the use of metaphors, the following
rules are to be observed :

1. Metaphors should neither be too numerous, too gay, nor too
elevated, but suited to the nature of the subject.

2. They must be drawn from proper objects; avoiding all such
as Will raise in the mind disagreeable, mean, or low ideas.

3. Every metaphor should be founded on a resemblance which is
clear and striking ; notfar fetched, nor difﬁcult to be discovered.

4. Metaphorical and plain language must not be jumbled to-
gether ; that is, a sentence should never be constructed, so that part
of it must be understood literally, and part metaphorically.

5. Two diflerent metaphors must not meet together on the same
subject.

6. Metaphors should not be crowded together on the same
object.

7'. Metaphors should not be too far pursued.

It is a good rule likewise when we have written a metaphor, to
make a picture of it, in order to see whether the parts agree; and
What kind of ﬁgure the whole presents. Thus when Shakes-
peare says, “ to take arms against a sea of troubles,” if we make a
picture of this metaphor, we mustrepresent a man clad in armour,
going out to fight water ! The impropriety of such mixed and incon-
sistent metaphors must be very apparent.

MODELS.
Plain language :
‘Our misfortunes soon end, and we are favoured with prosperity.

Same idea in ﬁgurative language.

The clouds of adversity soon pass away, and are succeeded by the

sunshine of prosperity.
Plain language :

The waters falling from the rocks, made a pleasing noise which

1 distinctly heard.
Figurative :

I heard the voice of the Waters as they merrily danced from rock

LESSON XXVI.
ALLEGORY.

An allegory is the representation of one thing by another
analogous* to it. It may be considered as a series or chain
cf continued metaphors. _,

‘ The only material difference between allegory and meta
aphor, beside the one being short and the other prolonged,
is, that a metaphor always explains itself, by the words
that are connected with it, in their proper meaning ; where-

as in allegory, something is intended more than the words

in their literal signiﬁcation imply.
Apologues, parables, fables and riddles, may all be con-
sidered as allegories.

MODELJ‘

The diﬂiculty of writing composition without the assistance of
thought and imagination is expressed in the following

ﬂllegory.

As I was reclining one morning at the bottom of a. beautiful gar-
den, in an arbour overhung with honey suckle and jessamine of the

amazed, not knowing how to reply. At length I was relieved by the
approach ofa beautiful nymph, who called herself Imagination; at
Whose appearance, the hideous monster disappeared. The sweet
and soothing voice of this beautiful nymph relieved my apprehen-
sions; but when I awoke from my slumbers, I found it was but a
dream. «

EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.

The pupil may write an allegory, showing the danger of
ambition without talent. To assist him in the exercise, the
following hints are ofered.

A snail despised the closeness of his shell, and sighed
for moreroom.

He one day found the empty shell of a lobster.

He took possession and was envied by all his kindred.

He one day perished with cold in a corner of the shell.

As instances of allegory which may be studied and imita-
ted, the following may be mentioned: “ The Hill of Sci-
enee;” “ The Journey of a Day ;” and “ The Vision of
Zllirza.-” The 80th Psalm and No. 55 of the Spectator,

- furnish other beautiful allegories. The Pilgrim’s Progress
is perhaps the longest allegory ever written.

LESSON XXVII.

HYPERBOLE, O1‘ EXAGGERATION.

Hyperbole, or exaggeration, consists in magnifying an ob-
-ject beyond its natural bounds. ~

This ﬁgurepoccurs very frequently in common conversa-
tion ; as when to represent the quickness of motion, we
say ‘.‘ as guielc as lightning,” or “ as swift as the wind.”

Hyperbole should be sparingly used; but no rule can be
given for its management, except that i_t must be under the
guidance of judgment and good sense.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 53

MODEL.

The speech of Mr. Otis was so interesting and impressive, that the
very walls listened to his arguments, andwere moved by his elo-
quence.

[By this hyperbole a forcible impression is given of the attention
of every individual of the assembly, and the effect which the ele-
quence of the speaker had upon each individual.]

iaxAMPL1ts FOR PRACTICE.

The pupil may represent the following expressions in an
liyperbole. —

1. The immense number ofthe stars.

2. The brightness of a lighted room. _

LESSON XXVIII.

PERSONIFICATION, O1’ ‘ PROSOPOPOEIA.

Prosopopoeia, or Personiﬁcation, is that ﬁgure, by which
life and action are attributed to inanimate objects.

This ﬁgure may be considered as the foundation of a.
large proportion of ﬁgurative language. When we say that
“ the earth tliirsts for rain,” or “ smiles with plenty,”
we represent the earth as a living creature thirsting and
smiling.

E2

54 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN

There are three degrees of this ﬁgure, namely,

1. When some of the properties or qualzities of living‘
creatures are attributed to in*ani'rn‘-ate objects. As

A furious dart; thirsty ground; adeceitfulvdisease; the angry
ocean.

Here the personiﬁcation consists in ascribing fury, thirst, deceit,
and anger, which, In reality are felt by living creiatures only, to the
manimate objects, a dart, a disease, and the ocean.

2. When inanimate objects are represented as acting
like those which have life. Thus :.

Lands intersected’ by a narrow frith abhor each other.

‘ ' The calm shade

Shall bring a kindred calm, and the sweet breeze
That makes the green leaves dance, shall waft a balm
To thy sick heart.

The cool Wind

That stirs the stream in play, shall come to thee
Like one that loves thee, nor will let thee pass
Ungreeted 3 and shall give its“ light embrace.

Here the words in Italick show in what the personiﬁcation consists;
namely ; in representing the lands abhorring, the shade bringing,
the breeze wafting, the leaves dancing, the wind stirring a stream and
playing, coming and embracing.

3. When they are represented as speaking to us; or
listening to whatwe say. Thus:

SI_MJLE, or COMPARISON.

A simile, or comparison, is where the analogy, or resem-
blance between two objects is expressed in form, and usually
pursued more fully than the nature of a metaphor admits.
Thus when we say of’ a great. man, “ He is the pillar of
the state,” it is a metaphor ; but when we say of him, “ He
upholds the state like a pillar,” which supports the weight
of anediﬁce, it. then becomes a comparison. X

Comparisons are used for two principal purposes, name-
ly, to explain a subject, or to render it pleasing."

It is necessary in a comparison, that it serve to illustrate
the object, for the sake of which it is introduced, and give
a stronger conception of it. i X _

i In drawing comparisons, the following rules must be ob-

1. Comparisons must not be drawn from objects, which
have too near and obvious a resemblance of the object with

_ which they are compared.

2. They must not be founded on too faint and distant
likenesses.

3. The object from which a comparison is drawn, ought
never to be an unknown object ; nor one, of which few
people can have a clear idea.

4. Similes, or comparisons, should never be drawn from
mean, or low objects.

LESSON XXXI.

ANTITHESIS, or CONTRAST.

Antithesis is the reverse of comparison ;i for as the latter
in general,‘ signiﬁes, or is founded on resemblance, the for-
mer implies contrast, opposition, distinction or difference.

Antithesis is frequently used where we wish to give a
clearer impression of our meaning ;——to show the truth or
absurdity of an opinion ; the excellence, or the inferiority
of a subject; or to exhibit in amore lucid manner, the dif-
ference, or distinction between twothings.

MODEL.

Geography describes the countries si_tuated on the earth, and the
parts into which they are divided. History teaches us the manners
and customs of the inhabitants of those countries. The former,
relates to the habitations of mankind , the latter, to the inhabitants
themselves. The one, embraces a View of the physical, the other,

describes the moral condition of the world. Geography maybe

considered as the more useful, but history the more interesting
study.

No two feelings of the human mind, are more opposite than pride
and humility. Pride is founded on a high opinion of ourselves-
humility, on the consciousness of the want of merit. Pride is the
offspring of igno‘rance,—humility is the child of wisdom. Pride
hardens the heart———humility softens the temper and the disposition.
Pride is deaf to the clamours of conscience,———humility listens with
reverence to the monitor within ; and ﬁnally, pride rejects the
counsels ofreason, the voice of experience, the ‘dictates of religion ;
While humility, with a docile spirit, thankfully receives instruction
from all who address her in the garb of truth.

Milo was unwilling to cause the death of‘ Clodius, at a time
when all mankind would have approved theideed. Is it probable,
then, he would embrace an occasion when he would be stigmatized
as an assassin? He dared not destroy his enemyieven with the con-
sent of the law, ina convenient place,cn a ﬁt occasion, and without
incurring danger. Wouldhe attemptit then in deﬁance of the law,
in an inconvenient place, at an unfavourable time, and at the risk of

‘his liﬁ: ?’

When we would aﬁirm, or deny with great earnestness, express-y

to the hearers. for the impossibility of thecontrary, We frequently put
our assertions in the form of a question or interrogation.

LESSON XXXIII.

CLEMAX.

Climaxﬁ“ called also, “ gradation,” or “ ampliﬁcation by
steps,” is the gradual ascent of a subject from a less to a
higher interest. r ,

Sometimes the word Or expression which ends the former
member of the period begins the next, and so on through
the sentence.

Climax generally forms an artful exaggeration of the cir-
cumstances of some object or action, which we wish to
place in a stronglights.

MODEL.

There is no enjoyment of property without government; no gov-
ernment without a magistrate ; no magistrate without obedience ; and
no obedience where every one does as he pleases.

What hope of liberty is there remaining, if what it is their plea-
sure, it is lawful for them to do ; if What is lawful, they are able to
do; if what they are able to do, they dare do ; if what they dare do,
they really execute; and if what they really execute, is no way of-
fensive to you ?

What a piece of Work is man ! how noble in reason i how inﬁnite
in faculties! in form and motion -how expressive and admirable; in
action how like an angel! in apprehension how like a God!

After we have practised good actions awhile, they become easy;
and when they are easy, we begin to take pleasure in them; and
when they please us, we do them frequently ; and by frequency of
acts, a thing grows into a habit; and conﬁrmed habit, is akind of
second nature ; and so far as any thing is natural, so far it is neces-
sary, and we can hardly do otherwise ; nay, we do it many times
when we do not think of it.

The state of society in large cities necessarily produces luxury; -

and luxury gives birth to avarice; while avarice begets boldness,
and boldness is the parent of depravity and crime.

Many beautiful instances of climax may be found in the sacred
scriptures. See the following :

*Theword climax is from the Greek language, and signiﬁes es
ladder. F

In ﬁlling up the preceding skeletons, the pupil will rec-
ollect that each successive member must rise in meaning so
as to express something of a higher and more important
kind than that which precedes it; There is another ﬁgure
in which the terms descend, as in the following :

His offence deserved not the punishment of cruciﬁxion ;
nay, not of death ; nay, not of stripes; nay, not of impris-
onment ;-—nay, not even ofcensure; nor yet even of disap-
probation.

See also Matthew 5th chapter, verse 18th.

This lesson ﬁnishes the subjectof ﬁgurative language. The pupil
should be appitizedthat the ﬁgures which are herein enumerated, are
a few only of those which belong to the subject. A complete list of
rhetorical ﬁgures includes several /mndred diﬁ"erent kinds 3* many of
which, however, _are but names for common expressions. Those

 

V which have been noticed in these lessons, are the principal ones that

are embraced in common treatises. The author thinks it expedient,
that the pupil should be made acquainted with ﬁgurative expressions,
before his introduction to themes and regular subjects. The previous
lessons are designed to prepare him for exercises which require orig-
inality, both of thought and expression. It is not a question here to
be discussed, Whether such preparation is necessary. The author
can only say, that teachers, who have been able to interest their pu-
pils in composition at an early age, and prepare them both to think
and to Write with clearness, elegance and precision, Without the aid
of some such introductory exercises, are happy in their success. To
those who seek some “ breve zterper ercempla," he addresses the lines
of Horace :

“ Si quid novisti rectius istis,
Candidus imperti; si non his utere mecum.”
or, as they are quaintly translated: '

“ If a better system’s thine,
“ Impart it freely, or make use of mine.”

 

’* Holmes’ Rhetoric enumerated a. list of two hundred and ﬁfty.

64 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN

Whether the arrangement of the principlescontained in the seve-
jral lessons, is as strictly progressive as it might be, is a question sub-
mitted with deference. Having enjoyed little conversance with the
collected wisdom of others on this" subject, either in person or in
print, diﬂidence ot his own opinion forbids the author to recommend
any adherence to the order in which they arepresented.

PARAPHRASE, 01' EXPLANATION.

Paraphrase means an explanation, or interpretation.

Maxims and proverbs frequently occur, which have some-
thing of thenature of ﬁgurative language. Many of them
are included in a ﬁgure whichby some writers is called
Allusion. The object of this lesson is, to accustom the
pupil to the use of such expressions, and enable him to ex-

plain them.
MODEL.

“ Look before you leap.”_

Paraphmse, or Explanation.

This maxim implies that we should not engage in any undertaking
before We have seriously considered the consequences ; together with
the probability of obtaining the object of our desire. We should also
consider, whether the pleasure or the beneﬁts which we promise our-
selves, are Worth the trouble they will occasion; and whether We
should not have reason to lament our participation in the affair.

LESSON XXXV.

CLEARNESS,IHUTY,STRENGTH AND HARMONY.

Before commencing t-he subject of simple themes, it will
be proper to premise a few remarks on the choice of words
and the structure of sentences; which have been reserved
for this place, in order that the previous lessons may pre-A
pare the beginner for a proper understanding and applica-=
tion of them. It cannot be doubted that the first step in
composition must be to teach the beginner lzow to rvrile

“ at al .f’’ p The second to show him how to write well.

The following rules must be _pc2°7rzan.r322ll3/ fasted in zflze

leamer’s mind.

1. The words which are employed in a sentence should
be such as exactly convey the meaning which the writer
intends, and not more, nor less.

2. All vulgar and low expressions should be avoided ;
and such words chosen, as the most correct usage has ap~

ipropriated to the ideas which are to be expressed.

Sentences should have the following properties : Clear-=
ness, Unity, Strength and Harmony.

CLEARNESS

A sentence is clear, when the meaning is easily under-
stood, and the expressions are such as to leave no doubt of
what the writer intends.

The following rules relate to clearness.
1. The words should be such, as are easily understood,
in the sense which the writer intends.

T 2. i The words and members of the sentence, which are
most nearly related, should be, placed as near to each oth-
er as possible ; that their mutual relation may clearly ap-
pear.» This rule requires particular attention to the situa-
tion of adverbs, pronouns, and other connecting words.

66 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN
UNITY.

The unity of a sentence implies that it contains ONE
principal idea, and has one subject, or nominative, which
is the governing Word from the beginning to the end.

RULES OF UNITY.

Ii. During the course of the sentence, the subject, or
nominative, should be changed as little as possible.

2. Ideas which have but little connexion, should be ex-
pressed in separate sentences, and not crowded into one.

 A parenthesis should not occur in the middle of a
sentence. ‘

4. The sentence should be brought. to a full and per-
fect close.
STRENGTH.

The strength of a sentence requires such an arrange-
ment of the words and members, as will exhibit the sense
to the best advantage ; give every word its due weight and
force, and thereby convey a. clear, strong and full idea of
the writer’s meaning.

Rules of Strength.

1. Take from it all words which are not necessary for
the full expression of the sense.

2. Pay particular attention to the use of copulatives,
relatives, and particles, employed_for transition and connex-
ion.

3. Place the principal Word or Words in‘ a situation,
Where they will make the most striking impression.

4. Make the members of ‘ the sentence go on rising in
their importance, above one another, in the form of a climax.
(See Lesson 33d.) -

5. Avoid ending the sentence with an adverb, preposi-
tion, or any insigniﬁcant word.

6. In the members of a sentence where two things are
compared or contrasted, where either resemblance or oppo-
sition is to be expressed, some resemblance in thelanguage

and construction ought to be observed. (See Lessons 30th
and 31st.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 67
HARMONY.

, The harmony of a sentence means its agreeableness to
the ear, and requires such an attention to the sound of the

words and members, as to avoid all harsh and disagreeable

combinations, when others equally expressive can besele.ct-
ed. This property, however, should never be sought at the
expense of either of the preceding.

Rules of Harmony.

1. Whatever is easy to the organs of speech, is gener-
ally -agreeable tothe ear; therefore, such words should be
preferred, and such an arrangement of theymembers of the
sentence adopted, as can be pronounced without difﬁculty.

2. Long Words and those vvhichare composed ofa due
intermixture of long and short syllables, are more harmoni-
ous thanshort ones; or than those which are wholly com-
posedoflong or short syllables. '

3. Theharmony or melody of the different periods
should be varied; and a proper» succession of long and
short sentences kept up.

4. The longest members of a period, andthe fullest and
most sonorous vvords,'should generally bereserved for the
conclusion of the sentence.

5. The sound should, in all cases where it can be done,
be adapted to the sense.

6. Thehissing sound of the letter 5 should be avoided.

LESSON XXXVI.

SIMPLE THEMES.

The most important rules that can be given for conduct-
ing all kindsof themes are the same; so far, at least, as

* The author anticipatestbe objection of stiffness, which will prob-
ably be raised by some, to the plan pursued in this and in several
other lessons. He desires, however, that it will be remembered, the
book is designed for beginners; and that its object “ is not so much
to form the style, as to furnish matter for Writing.” “ Ease is the
completion of every operation of‘ art, and therefore ought not to be
expected in the beginning.” T

68 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN

the object ofallis the attainment of clear notions, lucid are»
rangement, and perspicuous expression.

The ﬁrst difﬁculty which perplexes the beginner, is what
to say about his subject, He would naturally endeavour
to ﬁnd some book, which treats of it; and, if he is so for-
tzmate as to ﬁnd one, would take from it what would serve
his purpose. But he is here instructed that there is anearu
er, and morefertile source, wizicft w27i’Zfm~nz's7z 7r27m wit/z ma-
terials; provided he seek for them in a props‘ away. That
nearer source is his own mind, Working on the materials
which it already possesses. The manner in Whicli these
ideas or materials may be obtained, will now be explained.

1. Before taking up his pen to write, it will be Well to
thinlc for some time on the subject; beginning by fixing
in his own mind its exact meaning; removing every thing
that is doubtful or equivocal in its signification ; and when
diﬂiculties of that kind occur, determining the true import
of the Word by its etymology or derivation ; (see Zesson l3t/"2,
page 28th,) or, by the manner in which it is generally used
by good writers.

2. Having determined the true meaning ofthat, which
is the subject of his exercise, the next step to be taken is,
to ascertain its necessary and accidental qualij:’:.ies. This
may generally be done by an analysis. (See;’S7§.%3so9z 111%,
page  Having ascertained these qualities,..§’ney should
be considered according to their order, ‘or importance, with
a reference both to the general and the particular eﬁects of
each.

3. The qualities of the subject having been ascertained,
together with their et}"ects‘upon general or particular ob»-
jects, a comparison is easily drawn between it and some
other object; (see lessen 30$/L, page 5“7l}’z,) and such com--
parison will readily furnish hints for an antithesis. (See
lesson 3lst,',page 5952;.) The antithesis will serve to pre-
sent the subject in stronger light; and remove the iambi.-=
guity, which may exist with regard to any parts of the ex»
planation. ’ .

4-. A consideration of what has been gained to the World
by the inﬂuence or operation of the subject; or, what the
world would have lost or wanted, had the subject no exis»
tence, will suggest further ideas which may with advantage
be introduced into the exercise.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 69

5. These reﬂections will enable the writer to determine
with accuracy, whether the subject be good and commen-
dable; or bad and deprecable; and from what its excel-
lence, or inferiority respectively proceeds.

6. Ifthe writer have any acquaintance with history and
geography, he may consider, likewise, its connexion with
the manners and customs of different nations, both of an-

cient and modern times; its prevalence at any period, or

in any particular portion of the world ; and the station in
society whereit especially prevails.

7. These considerations and reﬂections form what may
be called the study of the subject ; and should generally be
made before the writer takes up his pen to record a single
idea. Each and all of them by a fundamentalprinciple of
the mind, called association, will suggest other ideas, which
will not come alone; and the difficulty of ascertaining what
to say will probably be succeeded by the difﬁculty of de-
termining what to omit. Here too he may be assisted by a
recurrence to the rules of Unity ; as they relate, not mere-
ly to a sentence, but to the whole exercise.*

ON A SUBJECT, AND THE METHOD OF TREA’1‘ING- IT.

Having studied the subject in the manner pointed out in
the preceding remarks, the pupil may write in the follow-
ing order, such ideas as he may have acquired.

1. If the subject require explanation, deﬁne or explain
it more at large, either by a formal deﬁnition; (see lesson
17th, page 3205,) by a paraphrase; (see lesson 35th, page
64th) or by a description ;, ( see lesson 23d, page 43d.)
To avoid tautology (see lesson 19th, page 34th,) in the deﬁ-
nition, make use of a periphrasis. (See lesson 9th, page
20th.)

2. Show what is the cause or origin of the subject; that
is, what is the occasion of it, from what it proceeds, from
what it is derived, (see lesson 18th, page 28th,) and how it
differs from what it is thought to resemble. (See lesson 17th,
page 32d.)

 

* In these remarks, the author has borrowed some of the ideas and
part of‘ the language in numbers one and two, from Jardine. The
plan itself is partly taken from Walker, but is considerably enlarged,
and, it is thought, improved by reference to the previous lessons or
principles contained in this book.

6. Present the subject in an antithesis, (see lesson 31st,
page 59th,) with its opposite, or with something different
from it; and show, from the antithesis, why the subject is
to be sought, or avoided, and its opposite is to be desired
or deprecated. ’

s '7. The exercise may be concluded with any general
observations suggested by the subject, and intimately con-
nected With it; or it may be brought to a close with acom-
parison. (See lesson 30th, page 57th.)

These particulars may be thus brieﬂy recapitulated :

1. The deﬁnition. 2. The cause. 3. The antiquity,
or novelty. 4. The universality, or locality. 5. The ef-
fects, namely, the advantages or disadvantages. 6. The
antithesis. 7. The conclusion and comparison.

The same remark may be made with regard to these
suggestions, as has already been made in reference to the
enumeration of the particulars under description, in lesson
23, pages 43 and 45, namely, that it is not necessary to
embrace all of them in the same exercise; nor in all cases
to adhere to the same order in the arrangement. The pu-
pil should be allowed to exercise his judgment as well as
his invention, in this, as also in all other cases.

On Education.

Deﬁnition. The culture of the human mind (see lesson 9th,
page 20th) has ever been considered as one of the
most important concerns of society. Hence educa-
tion,‘ which has for its object, the improvement of the

intellectual powers, (see lesson 8th and 14th, pages
19th and 28th,) is a subject which demands the seri-
ous attention and the most liberal support of every
individual in the community. ’

A parent, who is sensible that his child is a ra-
tional being, endowed With faculties susceptible ofa
high degree of cultivation, and is likewise conscious
that the happiness of the child would in a great de-
gree be promoted by the improvement of those pow-
ers, would naturally bestow much attention to the
subject. ‘

Accordingly we ﬁnd, that from the earliest ages of
the world, wherever the means of education have
been enjoyed, few have neglected to avail themselves
of its advantages. The Greeks and the Romans among
whom were produced such prodigies of excellence in
every kind of writing, and in every department of civil
and military life, were remarkably attentive to the
education of their children; insomuch that they
began their education almost with their birth. In
Sparta, children were taken from their parents at a
very early period of their age and educated at the
public expense ; and a celebrated Roman writer ad-
vised those parents who destined their children for
public speakers, to choose ‘nurses for them, who
have a good pronunciation.

At the present day we ﬁnd no less attention paid to
this momentous subject; although the modes of edu-
cation adopted by the moderns, differ in many respects
from those which were practised in ancient times.
The strictness of discipline which prevailed among
the Spartans, the Romans and the Greeks, has given
place to a milder regimen; . but whether this very
strictness, coupled as it was with methodical instruc-
tion, had‘ not a beneﬁcial tendency, is a question
which is not yet fully decided.

differ in their modes ofdiscipline and instruction, the
subject of education itself has received from all na-
tions, and in all ages, that attention which its impor-
tance demands. Even the savage takes care to in-
struct his child in hunting, ﬁshing, and those branches
of knowledge which are necessary for him.

But in no country has greater attention been paid
to the subject than in this. Here its importance is
properly estimated : and on no subject has more ex-
pense been lavished, and more talent employed, than
in the advancement and improvement of the cause of
education. Our forefathers have incorporated it in
their civil institutions, and pledged their substance
for its support. Hand in hand with religion, it has
received the smiles of the aged, the favour of the

good, and the support and encouragement of the law.
(See lesson 24th, page 46th.) '

From the promotion of this important subject, the
greatest beneﬁts have been derived. The knowl-
edge acquired by one portion of the world has been
trarismitted to another, Without distinction of distance
or diversity of age. The circle of human enjoyments
has been enlarged, and a wide ﬁeld has been opened
Where the highest happiness of which our nature is
susceptible, may be enjoyed, independently of the
common sorrows and misfortunes of" life. The en-
larged and enlightened views it gives of the world at
large,justly entitle it to much attention 5 and go very
far to supply those imperfections which every one in
a state of nature, must necessarily feel.

But nothing will show the advantages of education
in astronger light, than a contrast with the disadvan-
tages which arise from the Want of it. A person Who
l1as been well educated, has the mind and body so
cultivated and improved, that any natural defects are
removed, and the beauties of’ both placed in so ﬁne
alight, that they strike us with double force 3 while
one who has enjoyed no such advantage has all his
natural imperfections remaining ; and to these are
added artiﬁcial ones, arising from bad habits. The
former engages the attention of those with whom‘ he
converses, by the good sense he shows on every sub-
ject, and the agreeable manner in which he shows it.
The other disgusts every company which he enters,
either by his total silence and stupidity, or by the ig-
norance and impertinence of his observations. The
one raises himself to the notice of his superiors, and
advances himself to a higher rank in life. The other

is obliged to act an inferior part among his equals in .

fortune,and is sometimes forced to seek shelter for his
ignorance among the lowest orders of mankind.

From thesebonsiderations, we must rank the cause
of educat1o-n among the vital interests of mankind.

To extinguish it,'would produce a darkness in the
moral world, like that which the annihilation of the
sun would cause in the material ; while every effort
that is made to advance and promote it, is like remov-
ing a cloud from the sky, and giving free passage to
the light “ which freely lighteth all things.”

LESSON xxxvn.

COMPLEX THEMES.

A simple theme describes some subject generally express-
ed in a single word, term, or phrase; and, as has been seen
in the last lesson, embraces a view of its properties, quali-
ties and effects. A complex theme is a proposition, or as-
sertion, Which relates to a simple subject; an exhortation to
practise some particular virtue, or action, or to avoid some
particular vice, or deed ; or, it is the proving of some
truth. i

The directions relating to the study of the subject in
simple themes, (See pages 68 and 69.) are to be regarded in
relation to complex subjects. In addition to these direc-
tions, the following special rules must be observed :

I. No assertions must be _made in the exercise, but such
as are generally received and believed to be true; unless
they are accompanied with proper proof. This proof must
be furnished either by the senses; by consciousness; by
experience ; by undeniable truths, such as axioms and intui-
tive propositions ; by analogy ; (see lesson 18th, page 34th,)
by facts already proved ; or, by the undeviating laws of
nature.

2. The meaning of the subject, the attribute, and the
object, (see grammar, introduction to syntax) must be ac-
curately determined, so that the proposition may be stated
in the most intelligible manner.

  3. The arguments which are introduced must be so ar-
ranged, that those which precede shall throw light on those
which are to follow, and form a connected chain of com-

7'4 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN

parisons; by which, ultimately, the agreement or disagree-
ment expressed in the propositions shall be made manifest.

4. All objections which may be raised against the prop‘-
osition must be candidly and explicitly stated and a.n-
swered.* ‘

5. The proof may be concluded with a recapitulation,
containing a brief review of the united strength of all the
arguments which have been brought to conﬁrm it.

The following directions may guide the beginner in writ-
ing complex themes. t -

1. Commence the exercise by deﬁning or explaining
the subject of the assertion.

2. If it have any opposite, it may be deﬁned and ex-
plained, and the one compared with the other by an an-
tithesis.

3. Give some reasons drawn from the antithesis why
what is asserted with regard to the subject, is not true in
relation to its opposite.

4. Additional reasons‘, drawn from the nature of the
subject, such as its permanency, immutability, effects on
society, on ourselves, 8430. may then be adduced.

5. Introduce some quotation from a respectable author,
to show that others think as we doon the subject.

6. Give some example of the truth of the proposition
drawn from history. ,

'7. Draw the conclusion wherein the truth of the propo-

sition is asserted as a necessary inference from what has
been advanced.

8. A simile, or comparison, may frequently be used at

the close, by which an argument drawn from analogy may
be given with good effect.  

These directions may be varied as occasion requires in
the following manner :

After the theme, or truth  laid down, the. proof consist-
ing of the following parts may proceed as follows :1‘

‘* It frequently has a good eﬁ"ect to state, and answer the objec-
tions to a proposition or truth first ; and then to adduce the argu-
ments in favour ofit, reserving the strongest for the last.

i This method is taken literally from Walker.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 75

1. THE PROPOSITION, or NARRATIVE; where we show
the meaning of the theme by amplifying, paraphrasing, (see
lesson 35th, page 64th,) or explaining it more at large.

2. THE REASON ; where we prove the truth of the
theme by some reason or argument.

3. THE CONFIRMATION; where we show the unreason-
ableness of the contrary opinion ; or if we cannot do that,
we try to bring some other reason in support of it.

4. THE sIMII.E, or COMPARISON; where we bring in
something in nature or art, similar to what is aﬂirmed in
the theme, for illustrating the truth of it.

5. THE EXAMPLE ; where we bring instances from his-
tory to corroborate the truth of our theme.

6. THE TESTIMONY, or QUOTATION; where we bring in
proverbial sentences, or passages from good authors, to
show that others think as we do.

7. THE ooNoLUs1oN; when we sum up the whole, and
show the practical use of the theme, by concluding with
some pertinent observations.

With regard to these particulars, it may be observed that
it is not necessary that all should enter into the plan of ev-
ery exercise ; nor is it expedient that they should in all
cases be taken in the order here ‘presented. The remark
that was made under lesson 23d and 36th, is here repeated ;
namely, that the judgment of the pupil, being a faculty as
susceptible of improvement as any other, must be ‘exercised.
As the examples for practice in this, and the previous les-
sons, will require a vigorous exertion of the intellectual
powers,‘ and more especially of the faculty of invention, it
may be advisable to give the pupil but one part of the sub-
jegt at a time ; requiring him to Write a simple or complex
theme by degrees, and making each particular in the pre-
ceding enumerations the subject of a distinct exercise. He
may then be required to write the whole connectedly ; and
thus, in the language of Dr. Johnson, lDivide,——and conquer.

nant to the light of reason, so agreeable to our mor-
al sentiments, and produces so much satisfaction
and content of mind, that it may be said to carry its
own reward along with it, even if unattended by
that recompense which it generally meets in this
world.

The reason of this seems to lie in the very nature
of things. The all wise and benevolent Author of
nature has so framed the soulof man,that he cannot
but approve of virtue; and has annexed to the prac-
tice of it an inward satisfaction and happiness, that
mankind may be encouraged to become virtuous.

If it were not so,—if virtue were accompanied with
no self satisfaction, no heart-felt joy, we should not
only be discouraged from the practice of it, but should
be tempted to think there was something very wrong
in the laws of nature, and that rewards and punish-
ments were not properly administered by Provi-
dence.

But as in the works of nature and art, whatever is
really beautiful, is generally useful; so in the mor-
al world, whatever is virtuous, or praiseworthy, is
at the same time so beneﬁcial to society, that it gen-
erally meets with a suitable recompense.

How has the approbation of all subsequent ages
rewarded the virtue of Scipio. That young warrior
had taken a beautiful captive, with whose charms he
was greatly enamoured; but, ﬁnding that she was
betrothed to a young nobleman of her own country,
he, without hesitation, generously delivered her up
to him. This one virtuous action of the noble Roman
youth has rendered him more illustrious than all his
conquests. - .

The loveliness of virtue has been the constant top-
ick of all moralists both ancient and modern. Plato
beautifully remarks, that if virtue were to assume
a human form, the whole world would be in love
With it.

If, therefore, virtue is of itself so lovely; if it is
accompanied with the greatest earthly happiness,-
a consciousness of acting rightly,—it may be said to
be its own reward 3 for, though it is not denied that
virtue is frequently attended with crosses and mis-
fortunes in this life, and that there is something of
self denial in the very idea of it; yet, as the poet ex-
presses it,

The broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears,
s
Less pleasing far than virtue’s very tears.

heads, he may be required to write from an outline or skel-

ing '

MODEL.

On the importance of a well, spent youth.
' OU’1‘LINES.

1. All desire to arrive at old age ; but few think of acquiring
those virtues, which alone can make it happy.

2. The life of man a building ; youth the foundation.

3. All the later stages of life depend upon the good use made of
the former.

4. Age, therefore, requires a Well spent youth to render it
happy-

The pupil will observe, that in introducing these heads or sugges-
tions, the expressions are altered (see lesson 8th, page 19th,) and the
ideas are ampliﬁed or paraphrased. (See lesson 35th, page 64th.)
In performing his own eccercises, therefore, he will vary, amplify and
paraphrase the heads accordingly.

T1-IE THEME FOUNDED ON THE ABOVE.

[The numbers in the following, refer to the preceding heads.]

(1.) A desire to live long is the fervent wish of' all the human
species. The eastern’ monarchs, who wanted to make all human
happiness centre in themselves, were saluted With the ﬂattering ex-
clamation, Uh king, live forever ! Thus all propose to themselves a
Long life, and hope their age will be attended with tranquillity and
comfort; but few consider that a happy old age depends entirely up-
on the use we have made of our time, and the habits we have form-
ed, when young. If we have been proﬂigate, dissipated and insig-
niﬁcant in our earlier years, it is almost impossible we should have
any importance with others, or satisfaction to ourselves in age.

(2.) The life of man is a building. Youth is to lay the founda-
tion of knowledge, habits, and dispositions; upon which, middle life
and age must ﬁnish the structure ; and in moral as in material ar-
chitecture, no good ediﬁce can be raised upon a faulty foundation.

 This will admit of further illustration in every scene of life
through which we pass. The children who have not obtained such
a knowledge of the ﬁrst rudiments of learning in their infancy as
they ought to have done, are held in contempt by boys or girls who
have played less, and learned more. The youth who mispends his
time, and neglects his improvement at school, is despised at the
higher seminaries of-‘learning, by those who have been more indus-
trious at school. The man of business and the man of leisure who
have lost the golden opportunity of advancing themselves in knowl-
edge while young, often ﬁnd themselves degraded for the want of
those acquirements which are the greatest ornaments of’ human life ;
and’ when age has lost every occasion of advancing in‘ knowledge
and virtue, what happiness can be expected in it P

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 79

_ (4.) - The inﬁrmities of age Want the reflections of a well spent
youth to comfort and solace them. These reﬁections, and nothing
but these, are, by the order of a Wise Providence, capable of support-
ing us in the last stage of our pilgrimage.

Thus, a mispent youth is sure to make either a. miserable or a
contemptible old age. This has beenhappily expressed by the poet,

Where, speaking of those who in youth give themselves up to the
vanities of life, he says,

t See how the world its veterans rewards,
A youth of‘ folly ;—--an old age of cards.

EXAMPLES FOR. PRACTICE.

The pupil may now write a regular theme from the fol-
lowing outlines. He will recollect that each head is to be
paraphrased, ampliﬁed, and variously expressed. (See
pages 19th and 64th.)

On the necessity of submission to Teachers.

I. Submission to teachers and superiors necessary in
all states of life, exemplified in the cases of the young sol-
dier, and the patient, suffering under disease.

2.. The_ancient Lacedemonians thought submission to
superior authority so necessary, that they required their

magistrates to submit to singular customs, in token of their
obedience to the laws.

3. Itis a law of nature, that if We would gain any thing,
we must give up something. i

4. It is a law of" necessity, that part of our liberty must
be given up for the preservation of the remainder.

5. If we wish to gain health or knowledge, it must be
by giving up our own opinion, and submitting to physicians
and teachers.

6. The bee, an excellent example of the utility of obe-
dience to superiors.

The pupil should be informed that bees are governed by
one who is generally called the queen bee ; and that all who
do not work are expelled from the hive.

2.

ute to a gentleman.

3. Good breeding intimates the necessity of early in-
struction.

4. The true signiﬁcation of the, word politeness as

1.- Both history and biography teach philosophy by ex-
ample; but the example exhibited by biography is the more
interesting.

2. The single character 01 biography engages more of
our attention than it would do if mixed with others equally
COIISPICUOUS.

3. We form, as it were, a friendship for a single char-
acter in biography, and our benevolent affections are the
stronger for being ﬁxed upon one.

4. Universal benevolence sounds prettily; but it is par-
ticular benevolence only, that proves our moral character.

18.

On Novels.

1. Most novels are either the ﬂimsy productions of those
who write for bread; or the offspring of vanity in the idle
and illiterate; or poor imitatlons of some few which are
really good.

2. Novels give us false views of life; they palliate the
vices and follies of mankind, and discredit the sober virtues.

3. Novels vitiate the taste, as strong liquors vitiate the
stomach, and hurt the constitution.

On ContempZatz'on.

1. ‘Rational contemplation both proﬁtable and delightful.
2. Contemplation of the heavenly bodies raises our minds
to adore the power and the glory of the Deity.

3. A view of the earth with its various animals, excites
us to admire his wisdom and benevolence.

4. A sight of the beautiful and salutary vegetables shows
his goodness and condescension.

On Generosity.

1. Generosity is doing something more than we are
obliged to do.

laws ; but to be generous, We must do something more than
the laws require.

3. Christian morality is true generosity.

4. Generosity produces generosity.

21.

On the correspondence between true Politeness and Religion.

1. It is commonly supposed that politeness and religion
have no relation to each other.

2. Ifwe attend to the deﬁnition of each, we shall ﬁnd
them nearly allied. '

3. The rules of politeness express that benevolence ar-
tiﬁcially, which the rules of religion require of us in reality.

4. Polite persons, devoid of sincerity, are hypocrites in
benevolence.

5. As hypocrites in religion ought not to lessen our re-
gard for its ceremonies, so hypocrites in benevolence ought
not to lessen our esteem for politeness.

22.

On the art of pleasing.

1. A desire to please in conversation is laudable.

2. If we desire to please others for their sakes We shall
generally succeed ;—if for our own sake, we shall general-
ly fail. -

3. Good sense must show us how we are to adapt our
conversation to our company.

4. J ustness of thinking, and propriety of expression,
the basis of the art of pleasing[ in conversation.

structs our childhood, but sympathy’!

3. What is it that performs all the kind oﬂices of friend-
ship in riper years, but sympathy ’!

education than on birth or fortune.

 Fortune may descend to us from others; but educa-
tion must be acquired by ourselves.

part of education. ‘

4. Religion the best guard and guide of the passions.

On the dzfcrence between Fashion and Beauty.

1. Fashion reconciles us to the greatest oddities and
extravagancies.

2. If there be not a beauty in dress independent of
fashion, it is absurd to call one fashion prettier than another.

3. The power of custom is that which makes us always
think the present fashion pretty ; and this power of custom
is strengthened by association. .

4. That theibeauty of dress is independent of fashion,

appears from the practice of painters, and the dresses of for-
eign nations.

On Solitude.

1, Solitude much admired by those who have never ex-»
perienced it; and seldom approved by those who have;
since many have been obliged to quit it, and return to the
world.

2. The reason why solitude is generally intolerable to
those who have been in busy life, is, that habits are not ea-
sily changed.

3. The mind must- be employed actively or passively,
or be miserable.

4. The generality of the gay world are used only to pas“

2. A love of order appears in the regulation of our ex-
penses, in the spending of our time, in the choice of our
company, and in our very amusements.

3. Affectation hurts the pride of others, either by en-
deavouring to impose upon them or excel them, and there-
fore makes them its enemy. ’ ‘

LESSON XXXIX.

METI-IODISING.

After the learner has acquired some degree of skill in
thinking and writing, and has been taught by the models
and other directions, to ﬁll up the outlines, it will be a use-
ful exercise for him to make the outlines or skeleton ofa
subject. This exercise, for the want ofa better name, is here
called met/todising; and resembles that part of a regular
discourse, which in common treatises on rhetorick is called,
The division. The diﬂiculty of‘ the exercise should not
prevent the pupil’s attempting it ; for, it will be recollected,
no one can write well, who‘ has no ability to present his sub-
ject in a methodical manner.

As no two individuals would probably methodise a subject
in the same manner, the only directions that the teacher
can give are,

First. That particular attention must be paid to the
UNITY ofthe subject; and no particular or head, be introduc-
ed, which is not strictly and intimately connected with it.

ENGLISH COMPOSITION. 

Second. The heads or divisions, should be suﬂicientlyi

‘comprehensive to embrace all that is important pertaining
to it.

After the subject has been methodised, the pupil may be
required to ﬁll up his outline on the principle of the preced-
ing lesson.

There are two methods by which the principle of this ex-
ercise maybe performed ; namely, one, by presenting mere-
ly the heads of an essay; as for instance, if the subject of
Independence were given to be methodised, the skeleton
may thus be presented.

LESSON XL.

INVESTIGATION.

The‘ principles of the preceding lessons having been
practised with special reference to the effect intended to be
produced by them, namely, to make the pupil in some de-
gree conscious of the resources of his own mind, he may
now be taught to investigate a subject, assign causes,‘ trace

* The teacher will ﬁnd a list of subjects from which selections may

effects, and draw inferences. ‘ Inductive reasoning involves
no principle which is not clearly intelligible, and easily
practised at an early age. The facility of the process
has already been tested in other branches of education;
and itsimportance is so great, that no one can make a. good
writer Without considerable attention to it.

' The manner in which it is to be applied in this lesson,
will be betterunderstood by an example than by any other
explanation.

Suppose then, that the teacher’-‘ proposes to the pupil as an object of investigation, to
discover The state of Egypt, in respect to government, science and art, in the time
of Moses ; and the only datum, (or subject of certain knowledge,) given him is this
single fact thatfine linen existed in Egypt at that period.

Now if this subject be given to the pupil, without any direction as to the manner of con-
ducting the investigation, it is not probable that he will be able to prosecute it. The teach-
er must begin by directing the attention of the learner to the manner in which linen is
produced ;—that_it is an gfcct proceeding from some cause ;—that ﬁne linen, that is,
fine compared with other tabricks at that time, must be "formed of ﬁne thread—That
ﬁne thread can be made of ﬁne ﬂax only That ﬁne ﬂax must go through various
acts of preparation, in which many workmen are employed, before the thread could be
made into ﬁne linen. ‘ _

A ain —The u )ll must be informed that the roduction of ne ﬂax re uires an im-

S 2 P l _ P (1

 

‘proved state of agriculture, and the raising of many other kinds of grain——wheat, barley,

&c. to support the cultivators of ﬂax, and the artists who form it into cloth. ]n no coun-
try can ﬂax be the sole article of cultivation. It may, then, certainly be inferred that in
the time of Moses, the art of agriculture, and the arts connected with it, had arrived at
considerable perfection. A

Returning again to the datum, ﬁne linen can be woven only in a ﬁne loom, which
must be accommodated to the ﬁne texture of the threads ; and a ﬁne loom cannot be made
without much skill in the arts of working wood and metal. The latter, is extracted with
great labour from ores, dug from the bowels of the earth, and must undergo many diﬂicult
and laborious processes before it becomes malleable.—-The former, also, must undergo
much preparation before it can go into the hands of the carpenter; and the loom itself is
a complex machine, and proves great skill and progress of the mechanical arts in Egypt
at the time ofl‘/loses.

Againfthe weaving of ﬁne linen supposes that artists by imitation and example have ac-
quired skill and dexterity in that art; and such perfection cannot be expected in any
country, till a division of labour,——the gr eat instrument ofimprovement in all the arts,—-
be in some degree established.

The skilful weaver must be wholly occupied in making ﬁne linen; and, therefore, there
must exist many other a1 tists employed in providing food, clothes, and lodging,»-the ne-
cessaries and conveniences of life.

Before the arts could have made such progress in any country, men must have acquir-
ed much knowledge of facts and events, by observation and experience; and have laid
the foundation of general knowledge, by speculating on means of improving the arts;
on removingthe obstacles which retard their progress, and in opening up prospects of
higher degrees ofperfection.

Farther, without taking up time to follow the natural and connected progress of the
arts from their rude to their more perfect state—this process of investigation may be con.
cluded, with observing that there can be littleprogress either in art or science in any coun-
try, without the existence ofa supreme controllin power, in some or other of its forms;
by which, men are compelled to live in peace an tranquillity, and the diﬁ"erent orders of
society are prevented from encroaching on each other, by every individual being kept in
his proper station. No arts or division of labour——no ﬁne linen or ﬁne workmanship of
any kind, can be found in those nations which live in continual warfare, either amon
lhemselves, or with their neighbours. Thus, by such a continued chain of regular and
progressive deductions, proceeding from the datum with which it begun, and without
information from any other qua: ter, we have suﬂicient reason to believe, that at thetime
of Moses, lfgypt was a great and populous country; that the arts and_-‘sciences had made
considerable progress, and that government and laws were established.

* These remarks are taken with slight alteration from J ardine.

94 PROGRESSIVE EXERCISES IN

By presenting such connected chains of reasoning to the
mind of the pupil, he will readily perceive the connexion of
the facts, and be prepared to apply a similar process to
other subjects of investigation.* E

MODEL.

When Pompeii was discovered, a barber’s shop was found furnished
with materials for dressing hair. From this circumstance, what
may be inferred with regard to the attainments of this city, in the
arts and sciences ?

Among savage nations we ﬁnd no distinct trades or occupations.
Each person prepares such articles only as are necessary for his own
use; such as his tenement, his tools and his clothing; without re-
ceiving assistance from others. Therefore, if the old maxim,“ Prac-
tice makes perfect” be true, all work must be very rudely and in-
completely ﬁnished, as each person would be a learner in every dif-
ferent article he needed. The principal food of the savage consists
of such fruit and vegetables as the earth produces spontaneously,
in addition to what is easily obtained from the sea and the forest.
His habitation is usually a mere hut, little better than those formed
by sagacious animals. The skins of beasts, taken in hunting,
form the clothing of the savage. The lemales of such nations are
almost universally treated as slaves, having the most severe portion

..of' the labour assigned for their performance.

What a different picture, did Pompeii present from the dwelling
ofa savage, when overwhelmed by the burning lava, and buried for
so many ages in oblivion! A barber’s shop, with implements for
dressing hair, argues an improved state of the arts. In the ﬁrst place,
the principal art learned by the ancients was war. Now their pas-
sion for this must have subsided in some degree, and a paciﬁck
disposition have pervaded the inhabitants of Pompeii, ere their at-
tention would have been directed to improvement in any thing
else. A wise legislator Would likewise have been required to
frame laws, and magistrates to administer justice, by enforcing
them. Again, a state of undisturbed peace must always con-
tinue some length of time, in order that the sciences may ﬂourish;
as political commotions whenever they exist, usually occupy the
ﬁrst place in the minds of a nation. Distinct and separate trades
must have had existence in Pompeii; otherwise there would have
been no such thing as a barber’s shop. Doubtless there were a
great variety of trades, as that ofa barber is one of the least useful.
1.n order to the erection of a shop, farmers would be needed to cul-
tivate the earth, that those engaged in other occupations might
be supported. Mines must have been discovered, and their uses
determined. Articles ofiron must have been made by blacksmiths,
after the iron had been prepared by those whose business it Was.
Knives, and other cutting instruments would require a cutler, af-
ter the steel had been prepared from iron by another class of per-

the principle of investigation, unfolded in this lesson, can be credi-

sons. Again, after the timber had been taken from the forest and
in some measure prepared, a carpenter would be needed to build
the house. To heat his curling irons, the barber must have a chim-
ney, which would require a mason ; and the mason must have
bricks and mortar with which to erect it. The clay of which bricks
are made must be moulded into the proper shape, and then burnt
till sufﬁciently hard to be used. The mortar consists oflime, sand,
and hair. The art of making glass must have been discovered, oth-
erwise the barber’s shop would have been rather too dark to dress
hair with much taste.* Glass besides other materials, would re-
quire a particular kind of sand, and pearl-ash. Pearl-ash requires
much labour in its extraction from ashes. A diamond must have
been obtained to cut the glass, consequently, precious stones must
have been in use. Again, a glazier would have been needed to set
the glassin window frames. For that purpose, he would have wanted
putty. . One of the materials of putty is linseed oil. This oil is
extracted from the seed of ﬂax. Now it is not probable that ﬂax
was cultivated merely for its seed; therefore, We may reason-
ably suppose, that it went through all the various operations re-
quisitefor making it into cloth. The loom and wheel used in manufac-
turing the cloth, must have required much skill and workmanship
in the artist, and much genius in the inventor. And if’ cloth were
made from ﬂax, might it not also be made from other productions of
the earth P As mines Were. common, and men were engaged in so
many different arts, it is not likely, that they remained without the
convenience of’ coined money. The existence of a barber’s shop also
argues that balls and publick amusements were common; other-
wise, there would have been no occasion for a barber ; as most per-
sons by spending a few moments, can dispose of their hair very
decently. 1t also argues that there were a class of persons, Who,
being possessed of wealth, could spend their time in pursuit of
pleasure. lf the Various mechanical arts had arrived at such a de-
gree of perfection, is it not probable that the commerce of Pompeii
had become quite extensive. If so, vessels must have been employed
to transport articles fi'om place to place. For the management of
vessels, something of navigation and astronomy must have been
known. It paint was in use, and vessels were painted, as was doubt-
less the case, chemistry must have been understood in a degree.
Pompeii, therefore, at the time ofits overthrow, was nearly as far
advanced in the arts and sciences of civilized life, as we now are.
Yet they were in a state ofheathenisb superstition, without any cor-
rect system of morals or religion; and compared with the United
States of America, were a miserable people. This, then, should ex-
cite the gratitude of every inhabitant of our happy land.
