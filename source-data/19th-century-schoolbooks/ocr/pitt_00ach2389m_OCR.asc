live a great way off, in the woods.102 LESSON XLVIII.-CoNTINUED.
0, this was not a wild bear.
He was tame.
Where did you see him?
A man had him in the road.
He led him   with a rope. The
boys all ran to see him.
He would stand up on two
legs and dance.
He would march,. and carry a
stick` as if it were a gunm.::' You didn't go near him, did
you, Johnny?
I did not go very near him,
mother; but the man said the
bear would not hurt us.
I don't.know about that, Johnny.
I would keep out of the way of
a bear.
The man said the bear once
got away and went into a house
where some children were playing.LESSON X':L-VIII. - Co NTINUED,.  103
Oh, dear! what did they do?
How did they get away from him?
They didn't try to get away.
They thought it was a dog.
They patted him on the head,
and got on his back. He seemed
to like it.
mWhile they were playing with
-him, the'mother camue home. She
gave a loud scream.
Just- then the man came and
took the bear away. He hadn't
hurt the children at all.
Well, Johnny, that is a good
bear; but I don't want you to
play with him...!:,~~~~~~~.104       LESSON XLIX.

pleaed        word         took
A poor man had a parrot.
He had taught the parrot to say,
"There is no doubt about it."
Poll would say this all day long.
It was all she could say.106   LESSON L.-CONTINUED.
One day the man went out to
sell Poll.
"Who will buy my parrot?"
said he.'"WVTho will give ten dollars for my parrot-?"'  
"Ten dollars!" said a man, who
was going by. "Are you worth it,
Poll?'-"
"There is no doubt:about it,".said the bird.
The man was so pleased to hear
this, that he gave ten dollars for
the parrot.  
But when he took Poll home,
she would not say a word.
"What a, goose I was to pay
ten dollars for you!" said the man.
"What a big goose I was!"
"There is no doubt about it,"
said Poll; and I think Poll was
right.LESSON  LI.

Once a blind man said to a lame
man, "I wish I had your eyes."
"I wish I had your legs," said
the lame man. "I will lend you
my eyes, if you will carry me."
"Agreed," said the blind man.
"Get on my back."
The lame man did so, and they
started off.
Soon the lame man said, "Stop!
I see a purse in the road."
"A purse! where is it?"
"Go straight on,-now turn to
the right. There it is, just before
you. Pick it up."
The blind man did as he was
told, and picked up the purse.
107L ESSON L I.-CONTINUED.

in  connection  with  Script, as a desirable x;ay of giving
children their first lessons in reading and writing.:  
Some of the important features of the book may be briefly
indicated.
1. Easy and careful gradation is a Clhief characteristic;
short and easy steps and no long or hard ones.
2. Only a very few new words,-usually, from' four to
eight,-are introduced in any lesson.  In some of the later
lessons this number is slightly exceeded.
3. The new words are placed at the head of the lesson--in'
which they occur.  As soon as these are learned so as to be
known at sight, the child is ready to get-the thought when
they are joined with other words already mastered, and to
read the sentences aloud intelligently.
4. Much thought has been given to theo se'lection     of
words which are most profitable for beginners to acquire as a
vocabulary.  Such have been chosen as are in frequent use
in ordinary speech and writing.  The child hears others use
them  every day, and uses them himself, and therefore knows
their meaning.

P 5. In the first lessons, easy words of only one syllable are'employed; but in subsequent lessons a few words of two
~ syllables are introduced.  The youngest reader freely uses
many wvords of two or more syllables, and he learns to know
them at sight, in print, quite as readily as the short monosyllables.
6. Forced sentences-such as are framed for the sake of
using words of a particular sound-and forms of expression
unfamiliar to children have been avoided.
7. The young learner must, above all, be interested in what
he. is doing.  His progress will then be sure, easy, and as
rapid as can be reasonably expected. On this account great
pains have been taken to gain the attention of the little ones
by the matter of the lessons.
8. The subjects chosen are of the simplest kind, wholly
within the range of a child's experience. The ideas and expressions have something of the simplicity which characterizes the
language of childhood. The sentences are not isolated assertions, but are connected so as to form a simple dialogue, narrative, or story.
9. In pursuance of this plan of keeping the child's pleased
attention, much variety has been sought in the subjects and
the mode of treating them.
10. The large clear type will commend itself to teachcrs.
11, It has been felt that the pictures of the first book
put into a child's hands are of great importance, both in the
way of making the pages attractive and of affording substantial30  LESSON XXIV-CoNTINUED.

aid in their direct application to the lessons.  The illustrations in this Primer are by artists and engravers of the
highest repute for workmanship.
12. The short sentences in script, which have been
introduced from the first, are intended to be copied by the
children on their slates.  In regard to this feature also, the
utmost care has been taken to provide the style of script
most generally approved by teachers.
13. For the sake of much repetition of the words, frequent Review    Lessons have been given.     In these the
sentences have been so framed that the words previously used
are seen in new combinations and relations, and are thus more
deeply impressed on the mind.
14. Pages 109, 110 and 111 contain easy words arranged
in classes. It has been thought best to. put them all in one
place, instead of interspersing themn between lessons.  After
the children have'made some progress, the first group may be
written on the blackboard by the teacher, to be pronounced.
At the teacher's discretion, the next group may be taken. In
this way the pupils will learn, with little or no conscious
effort, some of the' important analogies of pronunciation.
These words may also be used in strictly phonic exercises,
if the teacher is so inclined.
Acknowledgments are due to Prof. B. F. Tweed, of Cambridge, and Miss M. A. Pinney, of New Haven, for assistance
in the preparation of this book.LESSON I.

Whales look like fish, but they
are not fish,LESSON XLVI.-CONTINUED.
AVhy, papa?   They swim in
the water like a fish.
Yes; but they can inot breathe

A'whale has to come to the

Are they good to eat?
No; they get oil from them.
Where do they go to get whales?
They go far off in ships.
Tell me how they catch them,
papa.
When a whale comes up to
breathe he throws a stream of
water in the air.
"There's a whale!" shout the
sailors, and take to their boats.
When they get near the whale,
one of them throws a long spear,
or harpoon, at him.

If the harpoon sticks in him,
they must keep out of his way.
He may hit the boat with his tail.
