how to mark, or to pronounce Syllables in Words
according to their true Accent and QYantity.
111. What is Etymology'?

at leaft he has as much rite to be Ange-ry with you

who contend for no more than hon our and Viacery
cannot give their adverifarya greateradvantage tbver

wvith a weak and ignorant parron, who ought to be,

It would be ridiculous to read common Things

And, on the other'and, to pronounce great Af.
fairs, and Matters of extraordinary Moment, in a
owv, unconcerned and familiar Voice. So that
(as was faid before) every Subje&amp; requires T'urn.s
of Voice fuitable to it; and whofoever does not hitthe Tone peculiar to each, becomes difagreeable
to the Hearers, by Impropriety in PronunciatiolLn
In readling a Sentence or Period, there is ufually
to be fornewhat-o al ie and Cadence; that is,
the Voice fihoulld be gently raifed, until one gets
to the Iiddle; and then it fihould gently fall to
t.he End of it. At the End of a-Sentence, fpeak
deliberately; and take Care you do not drop your
Voice too low- left tlhe Hearers fiould lofe the
Souncl and Mvecaning of two or three of the laa
Words.
ItI. Of E M PvHA S     s.
As that Force of the Voice, which is placed on
a particular Syllable in any WordJ, is called Accent;- fo that which is laid upon a particular Word
in a Sentence-is called Enmphafis.
To place thel. Emphafis upon any Word, is only
to pronounce that Word with a peculiar Strength
of Voice above the Relft, which gives Force, Spirit:,
anrld Beauty, to the whole Sentence: But if the
Word be of two or more Syllables, then the ac.
cented Syllable of the enmphlatical'Word is pro.
noiunced ftroniger than otherwife it would be and
a niew     f and diflerent- Accent is not to be placed
upon that Word; as, ill this Quefion, 4r'e you
trave/ling to -London?
Here tile firft fy llable in the Word( London muft be
pronounced with a ftrong Sound; becaufe the enm~
phafis lies upont that Word: Antd:hence it is t'hat

4 5'-'tS4 -     ThZe A P P E N D I X.
differently, to fignify the SLrefs that muft be laid
on any Word in a Sentence; becaufe both are
ufually placed on the fame Syllable.
Thhere may be feveral emrphatical Words in a
Sentence; as, the Boy is neither a Fool, nor a Wit,
nor a Blockhead, nor a Poet: Where Fool, Vit,
Blockhead, Port, are all enmphatical Words.
i he great:and genleral Rule to find out which
is thl emphatical Word in a Senitence, is this
Confider what is the chiel DeAfigll of the Speaker
or Writer; and that Word which fllews the chlief
Defign of the Sentence, is the emphatical Word;
for it is for the fake of fuch Word or Words, the
wholc Scttence feems to be made.
-There might be fome particular Rules given to
fiId out the emphatical Word; fuch as thefe:
I. When a Queftion is aflked, the Emphafis of.
ten iies onr the queftion'ing Word; as, v,to, wh/at,
-whither, zthen: Thus, Who is there? What is the
Mlatter? Whither di. iyou go? When did yotu re'urn?
Yet this is not always to; as, 7J1ho is the firongeft
or wifefti- Ifan? In which Sentence, flrongefJ ant
qv-/eq are the emrpha.tical Words.
2. Whent two Words are fet in Oppbfition one
to the other, anid one of them is pronouniced witi
iis phas, th     he h other fihould have an Ema
phafis alfo; as, f they run, we will run; jor our
cet are as god as theirs. In wh'-ich Sentence, they
and zve, our arnd i eirs, are the emphatical' Words.
To ma ke it appear of how-great importance it is
to place t'hc Emphafis rightly, we may obferv that
the very Scnrfe and Meaning of a Sentence is often-.
times very different, according as the Emphafis is
lai., upon differr -nt Words; - and that the particular
Defigho of thte Speaker is di{finguifhed thereby; as
n- tlis ihort  eftilol; namely,i'he A P P E N     D  I X.
2     3      4
1ill you ride to Town To-lday?
In thefe feven Words there may poffibly be four
different Senfes, from the diffcrent placing of the:
Emphafis, viz.
i. If the Emphafis be laid upon the Word you,
the negative anfwer mnay be, No, but my Brother will.
i. Ifthe Emphafis be laid on the Word ride%
the anfwer may be, No, but I hall walk.
3. If upon Eo,wn, Ao, I cannot, for 1 muli go inn
to the Country.
4. If upon To day, No, but I intend to go To.
morrow
Hence we fee hovw ufeful the proper placing of the
EJmphafis is to right leeadirng. Farthzr, concerning
the Imphafis, obfe.rve thf four foilowing dire tions,
I. Carefdlly avoid a,, Monotony, i. e. an Uniformiiy
f Voice or readi'ng without any Ez.phafs at all; rike
an ignorant Boy, who underfiands not.what he reads,

one pro nounces the moj moving and patheti  Ora io, as

2. Do not mutiply the Ezphqfis or, Chane t'e Tone
