comnfort and tranquillity depends.
If there is any natural object in the wide creation
worthy of the attention and study of youth, it is the
human system. Certainly there is no other material
object which more fully displays the Creator's wisdom, power, and goodness. The slightest study of
our mortal frame draws forth that reverent and feeling
exclanmation--" We are fearfully and wonderfully
made!"   Yet our children are too often suffered to
grow up, and finish their term of school instruction,
without ever having their attention called to this subject. Such ignorance should not be suffered any
longer to exist. It is unworthy of rational beings to
spend months and years in acquiring frivolous and
useless accomplishments, while they remain wholly
uninformed concerning the organs, powers, and faculties which the all-wise Creator has given them; and
of the most obviously necessary precautions for their
preservation.
The editor believes that the members of the medical
profession will approve of that part of the volume to
which he at present refers; as one of the most frequent causes of their want of success, is the deplorable
ignorance of their patients on those points of physiology
with which every one should be acquainted.

PRE ACE,STRUCTURE OF BIRDS.
THE frame of birds is very beautifuilly adapted
to their habits. Many of them pass a great portion
of their time in the air, either in the pursuit of
their prey, or in sportive gambols, and in these we
find every part of the body framed as lightly as
possible. In order to enable them to glide easily
along, all their feathers lie one way, pointing
backwards, and folding over each other in regular
order. No resistance is offered to their flight by
this arrangement, whilst beneath these there is a
layer of soft down, which preserves them from
cold, to the effects of which, but for this provision,
they would have been much exposed.
The wings of birds are the means by which they
support themselves, and contain the largest and

FEATHERS, ETC.STRUCTURE OF BIRDS.
strongest feathers; though made of very light
materials, they are moved by powerful muscles.
These propel them forwards with great rapidity,
and enable theim- to sustain long flights during their
migrations.  Their bones are also exceedingly
light and thin; and to make them still more
buoyant, air-cells, connected with their lungs, are
extended almost over the whole body.   In the
mammalia, the lungs are confined'"to- the chest,
but in this class they pass along the sides of the
body into the bon;es, and even into the pinions or
wing-feathers,. All these are filled vwhen the bird
breathes, and it is thus made almost as light as the
air, and floats in it very easily an-d lightly. Next io
the wings, the largest.feathers are in the tail, and
this is used as a kind of rudder, to guide and regulate their motions when flying.
Birds have no teeth for masticating their food,
and therefore either swallow it vwhole, or crush
and tear it with their bills.  Some of them, which
feed principally on grain, always swallow it without breaking; and in these the food does not pass
at once into the proper sto'mach, or gizzard, as it is
termed, but is received into a pouch called the
crop, where it is softened and rendered fit for
digestion. These birds are in the habit of swallowing pebbles and gravel, which appear to be
useful in the crop, and to assist in bruising the
hard skin of the grain.
The greatest part of birds live in trees, some on
the water, and but very few on the grouhd only
97STRUCTURE OF BIRDS.
Those that live in trees, and spend their time on
land, have the toes separate.; as the sparrow, the
linnet, and the canary; whilst the goose, the duck,
the swan, and other waterfowl have their toes
connected by a membrane or web, and are hence
called web-footed.    This web enables them       to
swim readily and quickly, as it offers a wide' surface-to the water, and serves as a broad oar.
The feathers of birds are of very curious construction, and have a series of webs or beards, one
lying over the other so as effectually'to keep out
moisture, and forming a complete dress. To assist
in keeping the body dry, birds are also provided
with a gland or little bag, seated near the tail, from
which they procure a supply of oil to smear over
their feathers, and thus allow the water to run of
without penetrating.

98FOOD OF BIRDS.
THE food of birds is very various.  Some live
principally on worms, caterpillars, and insects;
others, as birds of prey, eat' mice and other animals; others live on seeds and grain. Birds of'prey are ealled carnivorou., or flesh-eating, and
those which lve on.seecis ranivorous, or seedeating.
Granivorous birds are the most prolific and most
useful to man, as they are easily tamed and domesticated. They.are in general social, or gregarious
in their habits, and often live together in great
numbers, forming extensive colonies, as rooks and
doves. The fowl, the duck, the goose, and the
turkey, are used very largely for food, the flesh
being sweet and good, and highly nutritious. The

light us with their song, are granivoropus, and may
be seen busily pecking the thi'stleand groundsel
when ripe; whilst the yellow-hammer, the bunting, and the reed-sparrow, run along the ground,
collecting the seeds of the different kinds of grass.
C,arnivorous birds have very different habits
from the granivorous.  Their manners and dispositions are, in-;general, fierce and unsocial towards
each other, and they are rarely seen in flocks oi
companies. Each pair build themselves a separate
habitation, either on the top of some lonely rock,
or in the depths of thick woods, and suffer nothing
else to dwell near them. Many, as the eagle and
the hawk, have strong and active bodies, a powerful sweep of wing, and are armed with curved bills
and strong talons.  Their heads are commonly
large, with a short neck; and they possess very
acute senses of sight and smell. The hawk may
be observed soaring at a height so great, that it
appears only a speck, when, all at once, it will descend like an arrow, and pounce upon its prey;
perhaps a poor wren cowering amongst the grass,
and hardly visible; and the vulture, when a piece
of carrion is exposed, scents it at an amazing distan ce.
The condor, which is the largest flying bird,
is carnivorous.  It is a very powerful creature,
frequertly' standing a yard high, and its wings
measuring six or eight feet from the tip of the one
to that of the other.  It is capable of carrying

man.   It lives in the most elevated situations, and
where no other animal or vegetable can exist,
making its home on the very highest ridges of the
Andes in South America.    From these vast heights
it soars still higher, and then looks down on the
plains, three or four miles beneath it, for its prey.
It lives upon carrion, and destroys deer, vicunas,
and other animals, which it carries to its "aery."
This immense bird builds no nest, but places its
eggs on the bare rock. During the time it is rearing its young ones it commits terrible ravages
among the cattle and herds of wild horses with
which the extensive plains of its,native country
abound.

THE dress of birds is, in many instances, of the

the splendour and brilliance of the different colours with which the Father of all things has clad
the " winged denizens of the air." The skins of
the birds of paradise, which are brought to this
country, are of dazzling lustre. Some of them
have tippets of feathers, spreading over the breast
and back, of the richest hues; and others have long
lines of feathers springing- fiom  beneath their

from the head in the most curious and beautiful
manner. So richly are these creatures clothed,
that although their bodies are not-larger than those
of the blackbird, yet from their quantity of plumage they appear as large as the pigeon; and it is
impossible for them to fly, except against the wind.
The dress of the hlmming-birds is equally splendid, and when they are seen flittering about amidst
the flowers they are quite dazzling to the eye.
Some of our own birds are also very richly drest.
The feathers on the neck of the common cock,
when he is in complete plumage, possess a metallic lustre hardly to be matched; and the "eyes"
in the tail feathers of the peacock are as splendidly
bright as the golden breast of the green hummingbird. The great crowned pigeon of the East
Indies is the most beau'tiful of the pigeon kind.
Birds shed their feathers at certain periods of the
year, and have thus annually a new dress, fit to
preserve them from cold. This process is termed
rnoztlting, and birds generally- are weak and languid whilst it is going on. The largest feathers
are in the wings, and from these quills are made.
Some birds have no pinions or quill-feathers, and
on this account cannot fly, as these are requisite
to enable them to support themselves in the air.
The ostrich, the cassowary, the penguin, and some
others are in this condition.
Every species of bird has its own peculiar voice.
Sgme of them easily imitate the song of others;
and if a number of young birds are shut up with a
103PLUMAGE OF BIRDS.
full grown one, they all acquire the same general
tone of singing.  The mocking-bird, in a state of
nature, imitates the eries and notes of its neighbours with the greatest clearness; and the bullfinch
and canary may be taught to pipe a variety of tunes
quite correctly.  The parrot kind soon learn to
articulate words, and will repeat a sentence, or sing
a song accurately both as to words and tune. A
parrot has been known to sing upwards of fifty different songs, keeping time with its foot, and never
missing a word. This famous bird, when moulting
and unwilling to sing, turned its back to all who
asked it, and repeatedly said, "Poll's sick."
Song-birds are a delightful race of creatures.
During the spring and early summer, and occasionally in autumn, the whole air is filled with the
sound of their gladness; not a bush, brake, shrub,
hedge-row, or tree, but has its little chorister, each
striving with the other in a rivalry of voices.
The robins, the orioles, the bobolinks, the blue
birds, the wrens, and many others, are either residents with us, or periodical visiters; whilst the
"'household-bird," the robin redbreast, throughout
the entire summer warbles its cheerful melody
close to our habitations.

LESSON XVII1.
BIRDS' NESTS-SITTING OF BIRDS-AGE OF BIRDS.
BIRDS' nests strikingly show the care taken by
God of all his creatures.  rhe instinct which
leads to their construction affords some of the
most curious proofs of animal sagacity.   The
beauty of their contrivance, the selection of materials, their firmness of structure, all render these
"leafy homes" objects of admiration; and this
more especially, when we consider how few are
the means possessed by the little architects, and
the nature of the substances on which they have to
work. A slender bill, a few twigs and blades of
dlied. grass, and a little hair, or moss, are all, and
yet what a beautiful and perfect structure is produced.
Every species of bird selects the fittest materials
for building its nest, and also builds it.in situations
Tailor-bird's nest.BIRDS9 NESTS.
where its wants are most readily supplied, and
where it can best defend itself.  Some, as the
finches, use light and simple materials, such as hay,
roots, leaves, and reeds; and others, as the thrush,
in addition to these, prepare a sort of mortar from
clay and wool, and plaster their nests. The Cape
titmouse makes its snug dwelling of vegetable
down, so that it looks like flannel, and constructs
at its side another little nest for the male. In most
cases the female is the builder, though often assisted by the male in the collection of materials.
Excepting, however, amongst the swallows, where
both work with equal industry, he performs a
much lower part, though he gathers food for his
mate, and cheers her labours by singing, and by
every token of gladness.
The shape of nests differs very widely, and is
much more simple in some species than in others.
The snipe, the bustard, and the plover content
themselves with a plain bed of twigs and straw
placed on the ground, and sheltered from wet.
The jay, the sparrow, and the jackdaw build warm
and comfortable nests in clefts of rocks, in hollow
trees, and in old walls. -A number of singing-birds,
as the wren, build in the shape of a cup; others, as
the hedge-sparrow, in the shape of an oven; and
others, in that of a purse. The tailor-bird sews
together the edges of a leaf to form its nest, as represented in the cut at the beginning of this lesson.
Birds are very oareful, in finishing their nests,
to guard the opening from wet, and -o make the
107AGE OF B3IRDS.
outside as near the colour as possible of the branch
which supports them. The nest of the long-tailed
tit is shaped like an egg, and has only a very small
opening at the top; over this the bird fixes a feather
in a slanting direction, so as to carry off the rain;
and if the finger is passe(l into the mouth of the
nest, several feathers are found placed crosswise as
an additional protection.
When the nests of birds are -undisturbed, and
they have laid the usual number of eggs, which
varies in different species, the female begins to sit.
The constancy with which this sitting, or incubation, is continued, is a beautiful illustration of the
instz'nct of animals. If the mother-bird were to
absent herself for a few hours, and leave her eggs
exposed to the cold, the young ones contained in
them would be destroyed. This fact she has been
taught by G-od; and, contrary to all her usual
habits, she remains day after day, very rarely stirring; and in some instances she sits so closely,
that she requires feeding by her mate. We have,
indeed, known examples in which the whitethroated wren, thougn a very shy and timid bird?
has suffered herself to be taken by the hand, ratlihe
than abandon her eggs. The length of tilne required for hatching differs in different species.
The common fowl hatches in about twenty-one
days.
Some birds live to a great age. The eagle and
the parrot will live, under favourable cir(.umstances,

crops inj,ured or destroyed, by swarms of minute
creatures, which these birds prevent from increas
ing too fast. The stork anld the crane keep down
frogs, snakes, and lizards; ducks clear the gardens
and fields of slugs; and the martin and swallow
devour myriads of caterpillars, insects, and grubs.
Many birds destroy-w/eedds, and others promote
the extension of useful animals and vegetables in
a wonderful manner. Trees that are often found
growing upon high' walls, or rocks, have in general been planted there by birds, which deposited
the seed on places out of common reach.  Wild
geese, in their journeys, convey fish-spawn to distant ponds and lakes; and sea fowls, which gather
in thousands, deposit their offal on bare rocks, and
cliffs on the sea coast, from which, in the course of
time,a soil is formed, and thus they become covered
with vegetation.
The mischief done by birds is very trifling,
when compared with the services which they render us. Birds of prey, as the condor, the great
eagle, and the vulture of the Alps, now and then
kill colts, calves, goats, and sheep. The hawk
picks up occasionally a stray chicken, or pigeon;
and the falcon, the sparrow-hawk, and the butcherbird sometimes do the like. The heron, the
osprey, and other water fowl, are destructive to
fish, and fish-spawn. Storks, which are supposed,

AEPTILE S-1STRUCTURE OF REPTILES-CLOTHING
OF REPTILES-POISONOUS ANIMALS.
REPTILES form the next class of living objects.
The word reptile signifies in general any thing
which creeps, but it is used in a more strict sense
by naturalists. Frogs, lizards, crocodiles, alligators, tortoises, turtles, and serpents, are amongst
the reptiles.
Reptiles differ very widely from both the mam.
malia and from birds in structure, habits, and
appearance. The latter have red, or warm blood,
and are of the same heat as ourselves, and are
hence called warm-blooded animals: but in reptiles, the blood is of a paler colour, and they
generally feel cold to the touch, and'have in consequence been called cold-blooded animals. They
breathe, however, by means of lung[s, which are
transparent, and of very fine texture, and they areCLO'I'RING OF REPTILES.
capable of living a long time without drawing
breath. Toads have been discovered alive, though
enclosed in the trunks of trees, or in blocks of
stone, where they must have remained torpid probably for centuries. Creatures of this class can also
endure extreme degrees of cold without perishing.
Instances have been known in which frogs imbedded in thick masses of ice, have been found
living when the ice has thawed gradually and
slowly.
Most reptiles have voice; the frog for example
croaks, and the serpent makes a hissing noise.
The organs of voice are, however, in general, much
less (leveloped than in the former classes, with
which the reader has been made acquainted, and
some of them, as the green lizard, are quite mute.
The shape of reptiles is very various. Crocoo
diles, tortoises, frogs, lizards, and newts are fourfooted. Serpents, on the contrary, are without
feet, or any external apparatus for motion. These
have, nevertheless, the power of moving with great
rapidity, by contracting alternate portions of their
long and slender bodies. They can also spring
considerable distances by the same means.
God has clothed many of the reptiles in a wonderful manner. Some are cased in bony coverings
so hard and so strong, that scarcely any weight is
sufficient to crush, or any blow to injure them, and
into these cases, on the approach of danger, the
animals can withdraw their body.   Others are
114POISONOUS ANIMALS.
or shields; and others, that have naked bodies, are
covered with thick and glutinous slime.   Many
of them change their skins from time to time.
Some are remarkable for the sudden alterations of
colour they undergo. Several kinds of lizard have
this peculiarity, more especially the chameleon.
Many of the serpents have their bodies beautifully
marked with the most lively and brilliant colours,
and when slowly waving along the ground, produce very striking effects on the eye. Several
lizards are also equally beautiful in colour.
It is in the class of reptiles that some poisonous
animals are found. The viper, the rattle-snake,
the hooded-snake, the asp, the whip-snake, and
others, inflict deadly injuries by their bites, as they
convey into the wounds made by their teeth a
poison fatal to life. The poison-fczng of snakes is
one of the most sitgular contrivances in the whole
animal world; and it is fortunate that these creatllres are in general inoffensive and timid, and seldom use their deadly weapon against man, unless
made angry or injured.?

HABITS OF REPTILES-TORTOISES-FOOD AND
VITALITY OF REPTILES.
H   OTyl6 ung of reptiles are produced from eggs,
they are therefore oviparous, like birds; but they
differ widely fiom these in one respect, namely,
that the eggs are not hatched by the mother, but
by the warmth of the sun, after she has deposited
them in proper places for this purpose. These
places, however, she selects with the utmost care,
and the most admirable foresight, so that the eggs
may be safe, and that the young ones, when they
come out, may find a supply of food.
The greater part of them pass the winter months
in a state of torpidity. Some of them, as frogs
and lizards, are found occasionally in this state,'1'8,oR'OISLS ANiND'UIkTLES.
assembled in considerable numbers at the bottom
of ponds, or under heaps of rubbish, or Lhe foundation of old walls.
Tortoises and turtles, which both belong to the
same family, live partly in rivers, partly in the
sea, and partly on the land., At certain seasons,
when they lay their eggs, they travel great distances, to reach suitable situations. The wide current
of the river Orinoco in South America, is covered
for miles with these creatures at such times; and
in some West India islands, where the smaller
tortoises chiefly gather together, the ground is covered for great distances as they travel to the seashore, for the purpose of laying their eggs in the
sand. They lay more than a hundred eggs at
short intervals, digging shallow pits, and then covering them with a layer of sand. The mother
takes no further care of them, and they are hatched
by the heat of the sun. The moment the young
ones escape from the shell, they hasten to the
water, instinctively taught by their Great Preserver that this is their proper home during the
first weeks of their existence, and the only way
of escaping the numerous enemies which are lying
in wait for them.
Some kinds of turtle, as the green and the loggerhead, grow to a vast size, weighing as much as
800 or 1000 pounds. Their eggs and flesh are
excellent food, and are largely used in hot countries,
and brought to Europe and the United States in
great quantities as a delicacy. All of them have
118F OOD OF REPTILES.
strong bony coverings, or shells, which afford a
sure protection against their natural enemies.
The upper part of these shells is composed of large
horny laminae, or plates, which are in some
species beautifully coloured.  This, when separated from the rest, is known under the name of
tortoise-shell, and is used for a variety of useful
and ornamental purposes; as the making of combs,
boxes, watch-cases, and toys.
The food of reptiles is very various. Serpents
live on small animals; tortoises on sea weed,
called turtle-grass; lizards and toads on insects
and worms. Nearly all of them are capable of
living for considerable periods without food.
The salamander will fast for several months, and
the tortoise for upwards of a year, andc neither of
them appear to lose much bulk by their want of
food. The tenacity with which these cold-blooded
animals cling to life is also very remarkable; they
often recover from the most dreadful injuries, and
sometimes even when a part of their body has
been destroyed, as a leg or a tail, it is reproduced

AGE - F REPTILES-CROCODILE-BOA-TOAD---
SALAM ANDER.
MIANY of the reptiles grow slowly, and are very
long-lived; indeed, a general remark may be made
here, which the reader must bear in mind: throughout the animal and vegetable kingdom, whenever
an object grows to a great size, or grows very
slowly, it invariably lives to a great age. Thus,
the mighty whale, which attains so vast a magnitude, is supposed to live some hundreds of years;
and the oak, the king of our forests, which increases in bulk very slowly, will live for a thousand
years, and witness many generations of quickgrowing trees perish around it, whilst it is in its
prime. Tortoises have been known upwards of
one hundred and twenty years old, and it is probable that the crocodile and the larger snakes live
to a very great age in their native haunts.
The largest animal living in fresh water is the
crocodile, one of the reptiles. It is a native of hot
eountries, and in some situations is found in greatTHE CROCODILE-TI-IE BOA.
abundance.  It sometimes grows to the length
of thirty or forty. feet, and is possessed of great
strength, and carries off with ease a man, a tiger,
or an ox. The upper part of the body being covered with hard scales, it is a dangerous enemy,
though its motions are not very quick.  It resorts
chiefly to swampy grounds covered with weeds,
andi inland lakes, but never approaches the salt
water. When waiting for prey, it generallylies
motionless on the water, lookling like a log of decayed wood, near places where animals come to
drink, upon which it seizes and drags to the bottom. The female lays about a hundred eggs, and
is so prolific, that were it not that snakes of all
kinds- are fond of their eggs, and destroy vast
numbers, the countries they inhabit would be
overrun by them. In Egypt, a little animal called
the ichneumon has a wonderful i-stinct for finding
the nests of crocodiles, and destroys great numbers. Though these creatures are of such immense
bulk, their eggs are hardly so large as those of the
goose, and are covered by a thick leather-like skin.
Alligators, which abound in South America, are
very similar in habits and appearance to crocodiles,
and belong to the same family.
The boa constrictor, another of the reptiles,
attains a great length. It is one of the largest serpents, and kills its prey by folding itself round and
round its victim with the utmost quickness, and
then crushing it to pieces. Its muscles are exceedingly powerfill, and capable of pressing almost
any animal to death,
1~22THE TOA)D,,The common toad is popularly looked upon as
being venomous. This is an error, as it is, in fact,
a harmless and timid creature, and very useful in
gardens. It feeds chiefly upon insects, which it
catches with the most singular dexterity. Crouched behind a cabbage-leaf, it watches attentively till
a fly settles within its reach, when in an instant, it
jerks out its long tongue, and very seldom fails to
strike it. This is done so quickly, that the eye
can hardly perceive the motion. To secure the
insect, its tongue is covered with a thick glutinous
saliva, very sticky, and which holds it, as if it were
bird-lime. The eye of the toad'is particularly
bright and beautiful, so much so indeed, that it has
been said to "wear a jewel"' in its head. It is capable of being tamed, and rendered quite familiar.
The salamanders have a lengthened body, four
feet, and a long tail, which gives them the general
form of lizards, and they were formerly placed in
that order; but they have all the characters of the
frogs.
The name of the salamander, says Lacepedle, has
been celebrated firom antiquity, and embellished
with the tints of fable in all ages. It was on the
fortunate soil of ancient Greece, in the bosom of a
wise and warlike nation, whose imagination, fayoured by a happy climate, exaggerated even the
wonders of creative power, that the reputation of
the salamander originated, and that an immortal
and generally adopted name was employed to characterize a small reptile, which has usurped theTHE SALAMANDEie.
most universal celebrity; and is even still one of
the objects of the curiosity of man.
On the sides of tlle common salamander of
France and Germany are ranges of tubercles, from
which, in time of danger, a bitter milky fluid oozes,
of a powerful odour, and poisonous to weak animals. This probably has given rise to the fable,
that the salamander can resist the flames.

Fish are generally social in their habits, and
may be seen glancing in the sun in large shoals;
they are also very sportive and playful, are full of
activity and animation, and seem happy creatures.
Their character in a general way is that of gentleness and harmlessness; and they show no marks
of cruelty towards one another, beyond satisfying
the commdn instinct for taking food.    There
are, indeed, in the sea, as on the land, some fierce
and voracious creatures, which are objects of
terror; but those which are most abundant, and
which come more immediately under our notice,
are gentle and beautiful creatures, in no way
to be feared, but very much to be admired.
The eyes of fish differ from our own in their
shape and structure; as they live in a different
element, the care and wisdom  of their Creator
has been shown in the way their different organs
are adapted to it. Had their eyes been constructed like those of the mammalia, they would
not have been able to see accurately, and would
therefore have been unable to catch their prey.
This has been cared for, and fish see as well in
the water as other animals see in the air.
Fish have -no voice, and no external organs of
hearing; yet a few utter slight sounds, as the

hear, as carp may be trained to assemble at the
sound of a bell.
Fish are produced from    eggs, and in amazing
numbers; a single fish often containing many thousand eggs, roe, or spawnu, as they are termed.
Many kinds migrate, as the period for spawning
approaches, to great distances, often crossing wide
seas, in order to reach fit places for this process.
The eggs are laid in the sand or gravel, and
hatched by the warmth of the sun.       The young
fish, orfrJy, are capable of supporting themselves
the moment they leave the egg; and governed
by a wonderful instinct, though they have never
known a parent, they have immediately the same
habits, seek the same haunts, and take the same
means to defend themselves.
Fish live to a great age, and many of them

127FINS OF FISH.
LESSON XXIV.
FITS OF FISH-AIR-BLADDER-ELECTRIC FISH.
THE provision made to enable fish to move
in the water is very beautiful; this consists of
parts called fins; and these serve the same purposes as the wings of birds, and the legs and arms
of the mammalia. The situation of these fins upon
the body, and their number, vary according to
the habits and species; the common trout having
eight, two on the back, two on the breast, two on
the uinder part of the body, and two single ones;
whilst the common eel has no fins on the breast.
In the haddock, the fins, which in the trout are
placed on the breast, are fixed on the throat;
and in the perch, the same fins are fixed close
to the pectoral or breast-fins. The fins differ
greatly in size, and are made up of bony spines,
connected together by a membrane, and are
moved by strong muscles, just in the same way
as the wings of birds and our arms. By means
of these fins, the fish, which may. be said to be
suspended in the water, can move in all directions easily and with great velocity. Many fish,
which feed partly on insects, can leap to a considerable height out of the water in pursuit- of
them. This is done by means of the tail, which
is reckoned as a fin, and is also used as a rudder
to direct their motions. In many instances this
128ELECTRIC FISH.
is a very powerful instrument; and, in the larger
kinds of fish, can inflict severe, and even fatal
blows.
Another very curious organ with which many
fish are furnished, is the air-bladder: this is
double, and being placed within their bodies, gives
them the power of ascending or descending in the
water without any apparent effort. It renders
the body, too, exceedingly buoyant, and about
the same weight as the water in which they dwell.
Such fish as are unprovided with this organ are
generally found at the bottom of ponds, lakes, and
seas, as the different kinds of flat fish. It is supposed that the fish has the power of secreting or
forming air to fill this bladder, and we know of
no other animal which possesses any thing of the
kind.
Several fish are provided, as a means of defence,
with a species of electric or galvanic battery,
which acts just like a shock from an electrical machine. This is a very extraordinary provision,
and is possessed in great perfection by the torpedo
and the gymnote, or electrical eel. This last creature abounds in the rivers and ponds of some parts
of South America, and grows to a large size. So
powerful is the shock they are capable of giving,
as to prove almost fatal both to man and animals:
mules and oxen, when about to cross a stream infested by these creatures, talke the greatest precaution to avoid being entangled in their folds, and
exhibit every mark of terror when attacked by

bodies, and by a series of electric discharges, so
benumb and torture the animals that they fall down
in the wvater, and are drowned. Great numbers

LESSON XXV.
HERRINGS-SALMON-RE MORA.
THE providence of God has stored the waters
with proofs of his bountiful goodness. Some of
these are of the greatest utility to man, and
amongst the rest, one single species of fish annually feeds many thousand people. This is the
herring, which, although millions are destroyed
every year for our use, appears as abundant as
ever. Our Almighty Benefactor has so ordained,
that that species of fish should increase and mnultiply so rapidly as to defy all ravages, and season
after season it issues from the Polar Seas in vast
shoals, which are so broad and so deep that they
alter the very appearance of the ocean.
These shoals are divided into columns five or
six miles in length, and three or four in breadth,
which drive the water before them in a continued
ripple. In fine weather, these imm'ense floating
islands glisten in the sun, and reflect a variety of
splendid colours. Each column is led by a herring larger in size than the rest, which seems to
govern their motions, and to act as leader.
Herrings, in their annual migration, appear
off the Shetland islands in April and May; one
great shoal then takes the eastern, and another
the western, side of Great Britain. The station
for fishing is near the Hebrides;; but they are1  i-!; RING S--SALMON.
caught in great abundance all along the English
and Irish coasts. Herrings are important articles
of commerce; nearly 400,000 barrels being
cured annually in Great Britain, of which a
considerable portion are sent to other countries,
in exchange for money or useful articles of a
different kind. Herrings are both a wholesome
and nutritious food, whether eaten fresh, pickled,
or smoked.
The salmon is another-fish of the utmost value
as an article of commerce, and of food, being
by far the most delicate fish taken in our rivers.
It grows to a considerable size, sometimes weighing fifty or sixty pounds.  At a certain season of
the yearthis fish, led by a singular instinct,begins to
ascend our streams from the sea,and makes its way
as far up as there is water to cover- it, often leaping over weirs and ledges of rocks several feet in
height, and overcoming all obstacles in the most
extraordinary manner. When it has reached a
shallow part of the river, the male and female
form  a trench in the gravel, hollowing it out
with their snouts and shoulders to the length of
eight or nine feet, and in this the female deposits
her.eggs to the amount of 17 or 18,000. After
this is done, which occupies several days, both
the fish employ themselves diligently in covering.these up carefully, in order to protect them from
other fish, and from water-fowl, which greedily
devour them. The eggs are then left by the
parents, and after some time, the fry, or young
]c.orifish, are formed, and appear in vast numbers,
keeping near the shores, and gradually descending
the rivers, till the floods carry them out into the
sea.
The remora, or sucking-fish, is another singular
instance of the care taken by God of his creatures.
This animal lives in the sea, and having very small
fins, is incapable of quick motions.   To compensate it, however, for this weakness, it has, on the
crown of its liead, a curious apparatus, by which
it can fix itself firmly to any larger body, as a ship,
or another fislh, and thus be carried along with it.

LESSON, XXVI,
INSECTS IN GENERAL--BREATHING-EYESFEELERS.
THE power and wisdom of the Supreme Being
are made manifest in a wonderful manner by the
insect world. We cannot ramble on a summer
evening, but we find the air filled with sportive
and happy creatures.  Every leaf, every branch,
every pool, every bank, abounds. with animal life;
and every insect, however minute, is seen pursuing
with unerring regularity its settled course for action, and fulfilling some important purpose for
which it has been created. Some are busy supplying their wants, others in providing for their
offspring, others again, exerting the most singular
and wise precautions to screen themselves or their
eggs from danger, and others in laying up stores
of provisions. Their endless variety of form, their
endless number, and the care which has been bestowed upon them, fill us with astonishment and
joy, for all seem happy, and all full of enjoyment.135
Insects, under which name are included flies,
oeetles, butterflies, and others, form the fifth class,
into which all living creatures have been divided.
They differ very mruch from  the four classes the
reader has already had described, both in their
structure, their forms, their habits, and their appearance.  They have been called articuleated
animals, from being made up of many jointed
parts, without having a regular system of bones.
Mammalia, birds, reptiles, and fishes, breathe either
by means of lungs or gills. Insects have nothing
of this sort, but have, in their place, a number of
little breathing-holes, called spiracula, placed
along their bodies, through which the air passes, as
all animals, however various their structure, have
organs of respiration, these being essential to animal
life.
The formation of the eyes of insects is very
curious. Those of other animals are single, and
seldom exceed two, but in this class, what appears
to be a single eye is, in fact, a collection of eyes,
being made up of a number of distinct lenses, looking in all directions. These creatures have, therefore, no need to turn their heads in any way, in
order to see either upwards or downwards, to the
right or to the left. The two large eyes of the
dragon-fly, which is so common with us, have
been supposed to contain above 20,000 of these
little eyes or lenses.  Spiders, which form a class
of themselves, have eight separate eyes, two on
the top of the head, two forward, two backwards,
l~~~S OF INSECTS.136
and two in front, so that they can look nearly all
round them    at the same moment, and are thus
enabled to see the fly on which they feed, on whatever side it may happen to be.
Insects are provided with very singular organs
of feeling.  These are called antelnuze, and are
fixed on the head, like long delicate horns.  They
are hollow, jointed, and moveable, and in some
instances of great length and beauty.    They are
very sensible, and with them these creatures feel
their way, as the bodies of many of them are
covered with hard and insensible coats, either in
the shape of hairs, scales, or horny membranes.
In addition.to the antennae, insects have other feel,
ers ranged round the mouth, which serve to catch
their prey, and also as hands to hold it, whilst they
are engaged in eating.

LESSON XXVII.
TRUNK OR TONGUE OF INSECTS-WINGS--FEET.
THE tongue of insects is a highly curious instrument, and should be rather termed a proboscis or
trunk. A good idea may be had of its uses and
form, by looking at that of the huge elephant.
Many insects live chiefly oni honey and other
liquids, and in these instances the proboscis serves
as a syringe or sucking-pump. The proboscis of
butterflies is very long, and curled up, like a spiral
wire. This the creature can unfold at pleasure,
and insert into flowers, at the bottom of which the
honey lies. The bee may be observed, ranging
from  "flower to flower," busily thrusting its
tongue into them, and loading itself with sweets.
The common fly has a proboscis shaped like a club,
through which it will speedily imbibe a drop of
milk, or a few grains of sugar. It is curious to
watch how cleverly it uses this organ, and howv
busy it generally is with it. Other insects, as the
gad-fly and the gnat, feed chiefly upon the blood
or juices of larger animals. In these the tongue
serves as a borer to pierce the skin, which has first
to be penetrated, before they can reach their food.
When this is done, then. it becomes a sucker, and
draws the liquids into their stomachs.
Many insects are provided with wings of the
most beautiful texture and appearance. Those of
WI -
137I38
the dragon-fly and the house-fly are of fine yet
strong texture. Some of the beetles have wings
of the most surprising delicacy, which are folded
in a wonderful manner under strong cases, or elytra, when they are at rest. The finest gauze that
can possibly be made is coarse in comparison with
these fine and transparent membranes, and no hand
but the hand of God could make such curious and
beautiful structures. The wings of butterflies are
covered with minute scales of the most brilliant
colours, which resemble small feathers. Many of
these are singularly elegant creatures, and have
been well called "flying flowers."  One of our
poets, in speaking of the yellow spring butterfly,
has very aptly and beautifully said:-.The butterfly
That o'er the primrose restlessly,
Itself a flying primrose, hovers.
The wings of insects are moved by muscles, like
those of birds. It is astonishing how fast they can
fly. A swarm of common flies will accompany a
horse at full gallop, gambolling round its head, and
occasionally settling upon it, all apparently without
effort.
The number of legs possessed by insects, is
another of their peculiarities. None of them have
less than six, and others have twelve, twenty-four,
thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, and even more.
The feet of the house-fly are very curious. This
active creature walks with the, greatest steadinessLEGS.
along the smoothest surfaces, and it makes no difference whether the body is upwards or down
wards. To enable it to do this, its feet are so
made, that when placed flat, a slight vacuum may
be produced in the centre, which holds the edges
fast, just in the same way that the hand sticks to
a wetted slab, when the palm is a little raised, and
as boys lift up stones by a piece of moistened leather with a string through it.

LESSON XXVIII.
HABITS OF INSECTS-CARPENTER ANTS-BEES.
MANY insects make themselves habitations witi
great ingenuity and labour. The blhck carpenter ant hollows out cells and passages in the
trunks and roots of trees of' very hard texture.
It eats away the fibres with its nippers, and
works with the utmost nicety. When a piece
of wood is examined which has been colonized
by these little creatures, it presents a most curious
appearance, being completely honey-combed, and
the partitions between the cells are far thinner
than paper. What is very singular is, that these
excellent carpenters never spoil their work nor
open one cell into another, every one being foundquite perf ect and smooth. In these wonderful
houses we find numerous arcades and galleries,
leading to the various divisions, all finished with
the nicest slkill; and though the whole trunk of a
tree seems bored in every direction, it is nevertheless left quite strong, and generally lives as if
nothing had touched it. These colonies are amazingly populous, upwards of a million of inhabitants being congregated in very small space.
The habits of bees are amongst the most
interesting of any in the animal kingdom.  The
instinct they display in a variety of actions,
whether in a wild or domesticated state, is a
source *of continual wonder and admiration.
The structure of their cells, the treatment of
their eggs, the government of their hives, and
their storing of food, are equally remarkable.
Every bee-hive contains three different sets of
inhabitants. A queen bee, drones or male bees,
and neuters or woorkers.  There is never more
than one queen; if another is formed, it is destroyed at once, and its body removed. The
number of drones is about six or seven hundred
in each hive, and these are regularly killed by
the worlkers in August. This is done, in order
that the winter stock of food may be preserved,
and not eaten by a greater number than are actually useful.
The working-bees perform  all the labour of
building, collecting materials, preserving the ho
ney, and   nding th~   young. When they are
141
BEE6.constructing their houses, they first gather a
kind of cement from the gummy buds of flowers,
which thev knead into- little balls with their
proboscis and legs, and carry it away to stop up
all the crevices, and make the hive safe from
intruders. This done, they next fetch matter
for- wax. This is made from the fine dust or
pollen found in flowers, which they first eat, and
it is then changed into wax in the stomach.
From this wax, one set of workers construct
cells, having six sides, and of the most beautiful
regularity.  By giving them  this shape, the
greatest number possible are contained in any
given space, a question which long puzzled the
wisest men, but which these creatures, taught
by their own Divine Author, had practised from
the first hour of their creation. These cells are
used partly to hold honey, closely covered by
lids, and partly as nests, in which to place the
eggs.
When a number of cells are completed, the
queen bee begins to lay her eggs. During this
process she is attentively fed and followed by
the workers, which remove every egg, and place
it in a separate cell. During the summer, it has
been calculated that a single queen will produce
40,000 eggs. She first lays the eggs which are
to give birth to working bees, then the drones,
and lastly, a few are stored away in cells set
apart for this particular purpose, for a supply of
queens, lest the present sovereign should be
142
BEES.destroyed, or the hive should become so populous, that. a part of its inhabitants may have to
remove.
The eggs which have been deposited in tne
cells, in the course of a few days, pass into a grub
state, and are carefully fed by the untiring workers, with a peculiar food they prepare for them.
This continues for about a week, when the grubs
or maggots wrap themselves.- in a silken web, and
are closed up in their cells with a covering of wax.
In this state they remain for a fortnight, changing
their skins several times, and finally becoming
perfect bees, they eat their way through the lid of
their nests. In a few hours they join their fellows,
and fly away with them, capable at once of doing
all that these can or have done.
From the rapid increase of numbers in a hive,
they often become over-tenanted. When this is
the case, the bees may be observed to be agitated
and uneasy, running in and out,'and io work
going forwards. There is, in fact, a sort of civil
war raging, which ends by a portion of the bees
being driven out. This is called swarming, and
the expelled bees are always accompanied by one

LESSON XXIX.
CHANGES OF INSECTS-CABBAGE-BUTTERFLYGNATS.
ONE of the most striking circumstances about
insects is the curious and extraordinary changes
in shape, or transformnalions, through which they
pass. First they are an egg, then a grub or maggot, then a caterpillar, then a chrysalis, and in the
end a perfectly formed insect. In these various
states the animal often dwells on vegetables; then
under ground, or in the water; then on land; and
eventually is clothed with wings, and lives chiefly
in the air. During these cha.nges, which often
occupy years, for the stag-beetle remains a larva or
grub for six, and the day-fly for three years, food
of various kinds is eaten. The care of Almighty
God, has, however, amply provided for all these
variations, and we cannot sufficiently admire his
wisdom, who feeds and clothes the maggot hidden
under ground, equally with the splendid insect
which is to spring from it.
Any one who examines a cabbage leaf will find
little parcels of eggs, and if these are watched,
caterpillars will be found to come firom them.
These have sixteen short legs, twelve eyes, which
are exceedingly small, and a pair of jaws, with
which, as it crawls, it is constantly eating. Each
creature keeps increasing in size, changes its: skin

145THE UNIVERSE.
LESSON I.'TIE UNIVERSE.
IWE understand by the word universe, the entire
system of things which God has created.  The
world in which we live forms a very small part of
the universe. There are numberless other worlds,
far surpassing ours in magnitude. Many of these
worlds, that cannot be seen in the day-time,
may be seen with the naked eye, in a clear night
They appear, indeed, like points of light; but,
if they were not very large, we should not be able
to discern them at all: they are always moving
about in that vast blue vault which is above our
1lseveral times, and then seeking out some con
cealed place, either in walls, or under ground. It
then loses its caterpillar form, and becomes a chrysalis, that is, an egg-shaped case, enclosing a living
creature: and now it has neither mouth, nor eyes,
nor legs, nor wings; it eats nothing, and lies torpid. In this state it continues for several months,
and then escaping from its confinement, it comes
forth a butterfly, furnished with beautiful wings,
and with six legs: it has now no jaws, but a curled
trunk or proboscis for sipping honey, and has two
long horns springing from its head, and only two
eyes. Can any thing make us feel more sensibly
the power, the wisdom, and the wonderful ways
of our Creator?
Gnats undergo very singular changes.  The
female gnat lays her eggs on the surface of the
water, and to prevent them sinking, covers them
with a kind of glue, at the same time fastening
them by a thread to the bottom, that they may
not be driven away from a place which she knows
to be suited for them. As these eggs grow, they
keep sinking deeper and deeper, and at last the
young gnats leave them in the form of worms, and
burrow in the mud, making themselves a coating
of cement. After this they again change theiI
form, before appearing as gnats, and may be seen
in stagnant pools, hanging with their head downwards and their tails on the surface of the water,
at which part there is a sort of funnel for breathing.
The hlead is now covered with little hooks, by
146
GNATS.which they seize upon- minute animalcula and bits
of grass, on which they feed. After this change
they turn into chrysalides, and are rolled up in a
spiral form; and now they do not feed at all, but
lie on the water, and on the least disturbance, unrol themselves, and plunge to the bottom by means
of small paddles, with which they are provided.
From   this state they become proper gnats, and
leave the water. The head of the gnat is ornamented with a beautiful tuft of feathers, and its
whole body covered with fine hair and scales:
these are very surprising changes, and cannot fail
to impress us with admiration of the extreme care
taken for the preservation and production of such
minute animals.

LESSON XXX.
WINTER-SLEEP OF INSECTS-USEFULNESS 0F
INSECTS.
MosT insects pass the winter in a torpid state.
Spiders roll themselves up in a thick shroud of
web, and are found lying apparently dead, but are
easily revived by placing them in a warm situation: heaps of torpid beetles are met with in situations suited for their preservation. The pupe
of butterflies occupy crevices in bark, or are buried deep in the ground, some of them naked, and
others wrapped in garments of beautiful silk.
The larvae of cockchafers, dragon flies, and others,
may be found, each carefully protected, and in
places fitted for their wants.
The care which God takes of all his creatures
is singularly shown in the modes in which the
eggs of insects are preserved from cold or wet.
Some are deposited by a parent who never felt the
cold, deep in the earth; others are placed on twigs
and branches, but never on the perishable leaves;
and others are found covered wvith a thick coating
of water-proof varnish, or with down taken from
the mother's body.
Insects are of the most extensive utility. We
are too apt to consider them as troublesome
plagues; but this is an error. Beetles and cockroaches may be called the scavengers of the insect

world, as vultures are amongst birds, and they
clear away vast quantities of decaying vegetable
and dead animal matter. An insect supplies us
with the valuable colouri ng matter called cochineal,
which is nothing but its body dried. Silk is furnished by another insect whilst it is undergoing its
transformations.
The silk-worm, like the young of many other
insects, changes its skin several times, and when it
has arrived at its full size, it spins itself a web as
a covering.  The outer part of the web is coarse
and irregular, but the inner lining is' of fine silk,
and in regular threads. The enclosed worm and
its web is called a cocoon: this is placed in a hot
oven for the purpose of destroying the insect,
which would, otherwise, after a while, eat its way
out, and thus spoil the web. After this the silk is
wound off, and, by various processes, made fit for
being manufactured into the most beautiful fabrics.
If the cocoon were left uninjured, in the course of
a short time a butterfly would issue from it. Silk
forms a very important article of commerce, vast
quantities being used for dress and other purposes.
The more we examine the insect world, the
more sensible do we become of the mighty power
and goodness of God. No other portion of the
animal kingdom is filled with such curious and
beautiful instances of his care and continual protection; in place, therefore, of looking upon the
numberless "creeping things," which beset us on

LESSON XXXI..MOLLUSCOUS ANIMALS-STRUCTURE-CUTTLErISH-POLYPI.
THE sixth class in the animal kingdom has been
named Molluscolus, that is; soft animals, or worms.
Mammalia, birds, fishes, reptiles, have a regular
system of bones, or a skeleton; insects, as we
have already seen, have no skeleton, but consist
of a number of jointed parts, and are generally
covered with scales, or delicate feathers: the
worms have nothing at all resembling these,
their bodies being, generally, soft and naked.
Their flesh is white, as their blood is free from
colour, and they are cold to the touch. Snails,
leeches, worms, and shell-fish are among the molluscous animals.
Worms, like other cold-blooded creatures, are
very tenacious of life, and suffer the most seveie
injuries without being destroyed.  Many of themCUTTLE-FIISHe.
can exist for long periods without food, as some
kinds of snails have been known to live for years
in a quiet state, without eating, and almost without air.
Some of these animals are provided with feelers, or tentacula, which generally surround
the mouth, and sometimes with a foot for motion.
The tentacula can be moved about in all directions, and serve the same purpose as the antenne
of insects. The cuttle-fish has eight of them,
with which it catches its prey, or defends itself:
il this singular creature they are very strong,
and of considerable length, and what is very
curious, they are furnished with numerous little
cups or suckers along their inside, which enable
them to cling fast to anybody they are applied to.
The cuttle-fish grows to a great size, and becomes very powerful.  It generally lies hid in
holes in the rock, with its arms stretched out in
all directions, ready to seize any thing that may
pass its den. It has also a strong pair of jaws, a
beak like a parrot, and is covered with a tough
coarse skin, looking like leather. Another singular thing about the animal is, that it possesses a
bladder filled with a black fluid, which it can throw
out at pleasure, and thus hide itself. This fluid
when dried, forms a valuable colour, and is much
used by artists. One.kind of cuttle-fish is very
common on our coasts, and a particular bony substance, found in its body, is largely used for making tooth-powder.
152Snails have horns or feelers growiig out from
the top of their heads, and at-the end of these, in
some species, the eyes are placed.
The' structure of miany molluscous animals, as
the polypi, is so extremely simple,' that we cannot
discover any particular organ, except a cavity
which is supposed to be their stomach.       They
seem to be nothing but a mass of soft jelly-like
substance, and were it not that they move about,
one might imagine they were only pieces of some
inanimate matter.   Yet myriads of these creatures
fill the waters, and are placed there for some useful and important purpose, as the Lord hath done
nothing in vain, "and the earth is full of his goodness.~"

LESSON XXXII.
HABITATIONS-SHE LLS-PEARLS-HABITSA  GREAT number of the molluscous animals
dwell in a hard covering called shell. The colour
of shells is, in some instances, remarkably beautiful, and their shape and make very curious. The
animal, as it increases in. size, enlarges its dwelling
by adding fresh layers of matter at the edges;
and, if the shell is injured, it is repaired again
with the greatest nicety.
Such shells as are single are termed univalve
shells, and those which have two plates, as the
oyster, bivalve shells Bivalve shells are fastenedMOLLUSCOITS ANIMALS.
to the bodies of most of their inhabitants by muscles, and by these they are able to open or shut
them at pleasure
Pearls, which are so ornamental as articles of,dress, are procured from a bivalve shell-fish: they
are found growing in shells in many parts of the
world, and are common in some of our own rivers.
The principal fishing-ground for them, however, is
on the shores of the island of Ceylon, where vast
numbers of shells are brought up by divers from
great depths in the sea.  Mother-of-pearl is the
inner lining of shells, freed from the rough outside
crust.
Molluscous animals live on the land and in the
water. Those which dwell on land breathe by a
contrivance somewhat like our lungs; and those
which inhabit the water have gills like fish.
The mode by which these creatures keep themselves in a state of rest is highly curious. This is
done, in many of them, by means of a sucker,
which is a soft, muscular body, like what is called
the foot, or the belly of snail. It is quite astonishing how fast many of them stick by this
means; but whenever we are on a rocky sea-shore
we may easily learn by endeavouring to gather
limpets. Others hold themselves by a kind of
glue, or cement, which adheres to any thing which
it touches; and many shells are actually fastened
to rocks by a stony matter, so that the animals
which inhabit them never move from one spot.

know it to be a space which is without any limit,

We name the world in which we live, the
earth; we name the bodies which give or reflect
light, the sun, the moon, and the stars. These
bodies are shaped like balls, and, from their shape,
are called globes, or orbs.
Some of the heavenly orbs are supposed to
be inhabited, but' they are unfit for the abode
of such a being as man, who lives on the earth.
Their inhabitants must, therefore, be of a different
nature from  ourselves.  The Almighty Malier,

Astronomers call the space in the heavens,

call any straight line passing through the centre
of an orb, and ended at each extremity by the circumference, a diameter; and the diameter round
which an orb is supposed to move, they call its
axis. The circumference of a globe or circle is
the distance round it.

LESSON XXXIII.
ZOOPHYTES-CORAI -CORAL REEFS--NEW ISLANDS
- SPONGE S--ADRE PORES.
A VERY singular portion of the animal kingdom
is included in our present class. This consists of
sponges, corals, and other objects, which have
been called zoOVphyles, or animal-plants.  This
name has been given to them because many resemble
vegetable productions very closely; and there are
others amongst them that have a likeness near to
masses of stone or rock.
Some of these zoophytes are fixed to the bottom of the sea by a kind of root, and grow very
much in the same way as plants. They multiply,
also, by nearly the same means,-that is, by bluds
and slips, and asAthey never move from one spot,
and give very little sign of feeling, they are often
taken for sea-weed. rI'liey are, however, perfect
animals of their kind, and are provided with tentacula or feelers, which they employ to catch their
food.
Others of these minute and extraordinary creatures, which have the common name of polypi,
dwell together by millions, and build for themselves strong habitations, which we call coral.
Each of these little masons has, however, its own
house, in which it dwells separate from its neigh0
-157bours. What is exceedingly wonderful is, that
this stony matter, or coral, is formed from the
body of the animal itself. They are also furnished
with a number of delicate feelers, which are almost
constantly stretched out in the water, and in active
motion.
The " great deep" has no wonder more striking
than the formation of coral reefs. In warm
climates they are seen rising, like strong walls,
from the bottom of the sea, and forming immense
circles. The little architects carry on their labours
till the buildings are above the surface, when they
are exposed to the influence of heat and air.  This
renders their workmanship crumbly, and thus it
becomes a bed for vegetation, the seeds of which
are borne to it upon the winds, or by the tide, or
brought by some wandering bird which has sought
it as a resting place. Thus God, working by such
apparently insignificant agents, is continually producing new islands, which in the course of time,
become covered with soil, and fit for the habitation
of man.
Sponges, which grow plentifully on the rocky
shores of the Mediterranean sea, are also polypes.
These, in place of covering themselves with stone,
have a soft, fleshy dwelling, and this forms what
we call sponge. Others amongst them.bore holes

LESSON XXXIV.
THE VEGETABLE KINGDOMrI-STRUCTURE OF
VEGETABLES-LEAVES.
THE natural objects with which the reader has
been made acquainted compose the animal kingdom, and every thing contained in it has anirnaG
life, that is, it can move and feel. We now come
to the second grand division into which the productions of nature have been arranged, namely the
vegetable kingdonm.
The objects which come under this division
live, but the life they erijoy differs from animal
life. Vegetables can neither move nor feel, they
grow and perish in the same situations, and though
they appear sensible to light and heat, they show
no trace of feeling beyond thtis.
The term vegetable is applied to trees, shrubs,
grasses, fungi, mosses, ferns, and lichens. It is
these which clothe the earth with verdure, and
cover it with woods and forests, and which supply
a great part of the food of man and of the rest of
the animal kingdom.
The structure of vegetables is highly curious,
and consists of a number of narrow tubes, through
which a fluid is conveyed called the sap, and of
woody fibres. The outer bark of plants is in
general hard and rough, and serves as a protection
to the parts beneath. These are an inner fibrousS'iRUCTURE OF VEGETABLES.
bark, and a layer of soft wood, called alburnum,
Then comes the solid wood, which serves as a
support for the whole, and in the centre of this
there is, in some species of plants, a soft matter
called the pith. All these parts may be very
clearly seen in the young branch of an elder'
tree.
The leaves of vegetables are of many shapes,
and serve in a great measure for marking one species from another. The upper sulface of leaves
is in general very smooth and glossy, and of a
much deeper colour than the under side; this
may be observed in the laurel, the willow, and
many other trees.
Leaves differ, too, very much in size. In some
plants they are large, broad, and numerous, almost
hiding the branches, as in the sycamore and
lhorse-chestnut; in others, they are smnall, long, and
narrow, as in the ash and willow. Some leaves
are simple, that is, having a single body; in
others, each leaf-stalk holds several small leaves,
called leaflets, as in the rose tree; such leaves are
named by botanists compound leaves.
Leaves form  the foliage of plants; and are
found to be set upon the branches in particular
ways, according to the species. Thus, if we
examine the leaves of the elm or ash, we shall
find them arranged in one certain form, which is
just alike in every branch we can find. In the
weeping willow, the long and slender leaves are
pendent, or hanging, whilst the common willow,
o02
161STRUCTURE OF VEGETABLES
though its leaves are very similar in shape, has
them standing upright.
Leaves are made up of a number of very fine
nerves, as they are called, and small tubes or
vessels, and of a delicate thready net-work. This
structure is very prettily seen, by picking up in
autumn the leaf of a poplar. After this has lain
for a time, it loses the soft matter, and becomes a
sort of skeleton, made up of membrane like very
fine net. Leaves serve the same purpose in the
vegetable kingdom, that lungs and other contrivances for breathing do amongst animals.    The
air, when confined over a plant, is found to undergo
certain changes, and if not renewed, the plant dies.
Thus, a free circulation of air is as needful to the
life and health of vegetables as of animals.

162ROOTS -AND SEEDS.
LESSON XXXV.
ROOTS-SEEDS-BUDS.
THAT part of a vegetable which is concealed
under ground is termed the root. This consists of
a number of what we may call branches, that shoot
in all directions deep into the soil, and thus serve
as stays or supports to keep. the tree in an upright
position. These branches divide and sub-divide
till the extreme twigs, or radicles, are as fine as
threads, and it is through thlese that vegetables are
nourished.  They take up or absorb moisture,
and other matters for this purpose, which are then
carried by the tubes in the trunk to the leaves,
where they undergo a process which fits them foI
nourishing the plant.
Roots sometimes extend many yards along the
ground, more especially if they are placed in
rocky situations, where the soil is scanty, and only
to be found in the fissures and crevices. In such
cases, they shoot over broad spaces of bare rock,
and dive into every hole where soil can be found.
When an ash or oak tree has been planted in these
places, their roots may be seen straggling in all
ways, looking like knotted branches, and clinging
firmly to surfaces where we might suppose it
impossible for them to find support.
The seeds of vegetables are exceedingly curious
in their make, and show strlJ.i ]r proofs of the'16power and wisdom with which they have been
designed. Many are covered in the most careful
manner, to preserve them from injury, so that they
may be thrown about without doing them any
harm.   The pulpy part of apples, pears, and
plums, which forms such grateful fruit, is nothing
but seed coverings, and meant to nourish the seeds
when they fall to the ground. Other seeds, as
beans or peas, are shut up in pods, or shells;
others, as nuts, plums, and apricots, are enclosed
in a wooden shell; others. are. furnished with a
bitter rind to preserve them from the ravages of
insects; and others, as the oat and grass seeds, have;
a thick and tough membrane as a coating.
When seeds are sown, after a time, a number of
delicate roots spring from one end, and a green
sprout, or bud, from the other. What is very
singular about the vegetating or growing -of seeds
is, that in whatever direction they may happen
to fall, the root always strikes downwards, and the
bud which contains the rudiments of the future
plant appears above the surface. This is a beautiful provision of Providence, for if every seed
required to be placed in its proper position, there
would be no possibility of sowing grain. As it is,
however, if a seed fall with the root-end uppermost, when the fibres have grown a little distance,
they turn downwards, and the sprout which was
growing into the soil turns upwards, and makes
its way into the air. Those seeds which are shut
up in hard cases, as nuts, when the sprout begins

to grow, gradually enlarge, and the shell divides,
to permit the young plant to make its escape.
Buds, which are little conical green bodies found
on trees during winter and spring, are full of mat
ter for wonder and admiration. There is not,
indeed, any object in nature that evinces more
design than a bud. On examining that of the horsechestnut early in spring, it is found covered on the
outside by a gum-resinous varnish, which protects
the tender parts inside from  wet and cold.
Beneath this is a strong and thick casing of leaves,
and enclosed within these is a complete plant in

The flower of that beautiful annual, the sweetpea, so common in our gardens, is very remarkable, and resembles in some degree a butterfly.
This delightful flower has four petals, as the
coloured flower-leaves are called.  The lowest
of these, which is named the keel, encloses the
seed-vessels, and over these are stretched two
others, in the shape of a sloping roof, called the
wings, whilst towering over all is a broad petal,
termed the standard, or banner, which serves as a
sort of vane, and as the whole flower is placed
upon a slender pedicle, or flower-stalk, it is thus
enabled to turn away from the wind whichever
way it may blow. We should all examine thisflower, as its parts are very distinct, and we are sure
to learn something from it.
Flowers are found of all shapes and sizes. Some
are so small as hardly to be visible to the naked
eye; others gr;ow to an immense size, as the
krufibl, which is found in some hot countries.
This is the largest flower at present known, and
measures a full yard across: each of its petals are
a foot long, and the nectarium, or honey-vessel, is
large enough to hold three'quarts. A specimen
of a nectaritem may be seen in the columbine. In
this flower it has the form of a curved horn or
spur.
The odour or smell of flowers is in general exceedingly grateful. That of the hawthorn, whichFLORA S CLOC(.
covers the hedgerows with its white blossoms, is
wafted to us on the earliest gales of spring.  The
mignonette, or little darling, the polyanthus, stocks,
wall-flowers, roses, and many others, shed their
fragrance through our gardens, whilst others are
found in all our spring and summer walks, through
every lane and "alley green,'" affording a constant
source of delight.
A very curious thing about flowers is, that many
of them close their petals punctually at certain
hours of the day, and others at the approach of rain.
This periodical shutting of flowers has been called
Flora's clock. The yellow and purple star of Jerusalem closes at noon; the purple goat's beard
shuts at twelve o'clock, and has from this circumstance been named go-to-bed at noon, whilst the
evening primrose opens its petals at sunset and
closes them  at daybreak. During summer the
dandelion opens about half past five in the morning and shuts at ten, when the sun is becoming
powerful; the flower of the garden lettuce spreads
its petals at seven, and collects them together at
ten: the cat's-ear closes at three in the afternoon,
the mouse-ear at half past two, and the prince's
leaf at four, and hence is called the four o'clock
flower.
The pimpernel, or, as it is familiarly called, the
poor man's weather-glass, is an excellent guide as
to the weather. If its petals are seen fairly opened, it is almost sure to be fine, and if closed, rain is
certainly near. Linnmeus, the celebrated botanist

is said to have had so perfect a knowledge of the
periods of flowers opening and closing, and of the
signs given bS them, that he wanted neither watch,

TREES-USEFULNESS OF TREES.
THOSE vegetable productions which grow to a
certain size, and have a distinct trunk or stem, are
called trees. Shrubs differ friom trees merely in
being smaller and having a bushy character, and
from several stems often springing together from
the same root.
Trees are applied to a great variety of useful
purposes. The wood obtained fromn them is used
for the building of houses and ships, particularly
oak, teak, and pine.  The ash, the beech, the
elm, the lime, the white pine, and the birch,
amongst our native trees, are of the greatest value
to the cabinet-maker and the carpenter, all sorts
of useful wooden articles are being made from them.
The fruit of the oak and the beach, called acorns
and beech-mast, is used for feeding herds of hogsUSEFULNESS OF TRELES,
Pines and firs grow to a great length, and are used
for the masts of ships and for building. Turpentine, rosin, pitch, and tar are procured from this
species of tree.
The largest and most magnificent trees are,
however, found in hot countries. Amongst these,
various kinds of palms afford the noblest specimens of the vegetable kingdom. They attain a
vast height, the palnma real of Cuba often being
seen one hundred and sixty feet high. - They have
tall, slender stems, without branches, with a crown
of immense leaves springing fi-om the very top,
and hanging down in the lightest and most graceful manner. These leaves are twelve or fifteen
feet long, and have at their root bunches of the
most brilliant blossoms.
iMost of the palms bear a friuit, which supplies
the people where they grow with the greatest part
of their food. The date palm and the cocoa nut
palm are amongst the most useful, and their fruit
is also made an article of commerce. The baobab,
or monkey-bread tree, is the largest vegetable
known. This tree has a short stem, but is of
amazing thickness, and from this it sends out
branches till it looks like a forest in itself: its
fruit is highly valuable, being used both as food
and medicine

the mother-tree. India rubber is the dried juice
of another South American tree. This is obtained
by making cuts into the bark, from which the sap
flows plentifully of a milky whiteness. It is then
exposed to the sun, which dries it, and this is all
the preparation it undergoes. Another tree found
in hot countries is frequently useful to the natives,
by furnishing them witlh water.'I'he wild pine
of Campeachy has deep leaves, which are so made
as to hold water: these are filled during the heavy
tropical showers, and serve both to refresh the
plant and as drink to the traveller.
The wood of many trees is of a very beautiful
colour and takes a high polish, and is used for
furniture and ornamental purposes.  Mahogany,
rose-wvood, zebra-wvood, ebony, and many others,
are important articles of commerce on this account,
the greatest part of ouIr chairs and tables being
made from them.
The cotton tree, however, affords the most valuable vegetable production for the use of man.  It
is a shrubby tree growing in warm countries, and
produces a nut, in which the seeds are covered
by the soft downy substance called cotton. Vast
quantities of this are gathered every year, and the
making of it into cloth employs the labour of many
thbousands of our countrylnen.
The varieties of the forest trees of the United
States are very numerous.  Of the oak alone, as
imany as ten varieties maybe often seen from the

three quarters of a year; but the sun is so large
that, even travelling at the same speed, he would
be 75 years in making a journey round it.
Next to the sun, the moon is, to us, the most
interesting object among the heavenly bodies.
The dazzling splendour of the sun renders a full
view of it painful to the human sight. The brightness of the moon, on the contrary, arising from the
light which it reflects, is grateful and pleasing to
the eye, and its silvery beam relieves with a cheering influence the dulness of our long winter nights.
Its changes from the thin crescent to the full orb,
and its waning from the full to the crescent again,
lead us to admire the wisdom and power of God,
by whom all these wonderful things were made,
and who regulates all their motions.
The earth, and the other orbs which move
round the sun, compose what is called the solar
system.  Twenty-three of these orbs may be distinctly seen: they are called planets.  Planet
means moving star. Primary planets move round
the sun: secondary planets move round some one
of the primary planets, and are called their moons,
or satellites.  All the planets move also round
their own axis; some in a longer, others in a
shorter time; and the length of their days varies
accordingly..

LESSON XXXIX.
FRUIT-GRASSES-GARDEN AND FIELD
VEGETABLES.
GOD in his bounty, when providing seed-vessels
for many vegetables, covered them with rich pulpy
and nourishing matter. This we call fruit, and it
is of the utmost value to us as food, and in many
instances as mnedicine.
We cannot turn, indeed, to any portion of the
three kingdoms of nature, without finding something to remind us of the goodness and bounty of
our universal Father. The bud or the leaf of a
plant is as full of instruction as the form and structure of the elephant, or of the mighty whale.
The apple, the pear, the plum, the cherry, the
peach, the apricot, the gooseberry, the currant, the
raspberry, the strawberry, and others, grow abundantly in our, country. In warmer climates, the(IRASSES.
orange, the lemon, the olive, the grape, the fig, the
date, the bread-fruit, the pine-apple, the melon, and
a great variety of others, grow in endless profusion, and afford to the inhabitants a wholesome and
grateful provision, fitted for their peculiar wants.
The grasses; or cerealia, as they are termed by
botanists, form one of the most important and most
useful families in the vegetable kingdom.  It is
these which cover the earth with verdure, and it is
these which form the principal part of our food.
Wheat, oats, barley, rye, millet, maize, or Indian
corn, and rice are included in the grasses, and
furnish man with bread, and its substitutes, in all
parts of the world in which they grow.
\That is generally called grass consists of a
number of plants, all remarkable for their slender
stems, their thin and delicate leaves, and for their
mode of flowering.  One of their most valuable
and singular properties is, that the more they are
eaten away and apparently injured, the more they
flourish, as this strengthens their roots, and makes
them grow with double vigour. This eminently
fits them for being browsed upon by cattle, which
find their entire support from them.
Some of these, which are small in our country,
grow to a great size in hot countries, and are found
taller than a man, covering vast plains. The inhabitants of warm climates are supported in a great
measure by rice and maize, whilst in colder countries man lives chiefly on wheat and oats. The
sugar-cane, from the juice of which sugar is proVE G tTABLES5.
cured, is another of the grasses. The bamboo, the
reeds, and the rush, which are applied to many
useful purposes, are also members of the same
family.
Great numbers of vegetables, useful as food, are
cultivated in our gardens and fields. Amongst
these are cabbages, brocoli, beans, peas, asparagus,
cauliflowers, turnips, carrots, potatoes, and many
others.  The potato, which now forms so necessary a part of our diet, has only been known amongst
us about two hundred years. Onions, leeks, garlic,
parsley, beets, and radishes, are also grown in
gardens, and are called with the -rest culinary, or
garden vegetables.
Flax is cultivated for the purposes of making
linen; hemp for ropes and matting; rape for oil;
and hops, used in brewing.    Clover, lucern-grass,
vetches, Swedish turnips, and others, are cultivated for feeding cattle; and saffron and madder for
the purposes of dyeing cloth; the one yields a
yellow, and the other a red colour.

LESSON XL.
MOSS-FUN"GI-FERNS--LICHENS-SEA-WEED.
THE reader has been told that most plants produce flowers. There is, however, one portion of
the vegetable kingdom, on which flowers are never
seen, and this embraces mosses, fungi, or the mushroom tribe, lichens, ferns, and sea-weeds.
A bed of moss consists of a great number of very
small and very beautiful plants. Bare rocks, coralreefs, swamps, bogs, and other situations, where
larger vegetables would not grow, are covered with
moss; these, by their de6ay, form a stratum, or
layer of soil, which in course of time becomes
planted with the seeds of grass and other herbs,
and thus barren places are made fertile, by the
agency of these apparently useless objects.
Fungi are those fleshy bodies which are found
so plentifully upon decaying wood, in damp and
shady places. Many of them grow to a considerable size, and are of a beautiful colour.  Great
numbers of these curious vegetable productions
may be found, by examining an old wood-heap at

the begoinning of October. They are very useful
in hastening the decay and removal of dead-wood,
as it is upon this that the greatest part of them live.
Mushrooms, toad-stools, puff-balls, fairy-purses,
and many others, are very common in our fields
and lanes.
Some of the fungi, as mushrooms, morels, and
truffles, are fit for food; others are poisonous, and
we should be very careful in collecting them, not
to eat any but such as xwe know are esculent, many
accidents having happened to children, from a want
of proper caution. The seeds of mushrooms are
very numerous, and grow in the gills as they are
termed, that is, the ribbed part on the under side
of the head or cap. It has been calculated that
several millions are containedl in a single plant.
Ferns are amongst the most graceful productions
of the vegetable kingdom.  They are found adorning shady lanes, and woody slopes, with their
slender stems, and delicate foliage.  Nothing can
exceed the beauty and delicacy of the half unrolled
leaves of a young fern, and Nwe should never pass
one, without pausing a moment to admire it, and
to wonder at the wisdom which has so charmingly
clothed it. In hot countries, ferns grow thirty or
forty feet high, and look like trees. The roots
and stems of this species of plants, when ground,
are said to afford a very tolerable food.
In very cold countries, where co'rn and other
field-vegetables will not live, the ground is covered
by lichens and moss. The care of Almighty God
-QLICHEIE S.
has left no place, hoNwever bleak, without some
means Qf supporting animal and vegetable life; and
thus the lichens afford nourishment to-the rein-deer
in those inhosDitable regions, vwhere it is the only
animal that can exist, and where it supplies nearly
all the wants of the inhabitants.  One species of
lichen, called Iceland moss, is used among ourselves, both as food and medicine.
The bottom of the sea is also clothed with vegetable productions. These are called sea-weed, and
in some situations it -grows so plentifully as to
cover the surface of the ocean, and give-it the appearance of a vast fiel-d.  Sea-weeds afford food to
marine animals, and are likewise burnt for making
soda.

rHsE natural objects which have hitherto been
r,rought under oul readers' notice, have life. They
are found in the early stages of their existence
small in size, then growing larger, living a certain
period, and in the end dying. Minerals differ
from these in having no life. They are found in
large masses, and undergo scarcely any change in
the course of ages.
ATWe have also seen, that an all-wise Creator has
placed both animals and vegetables in peculiar
situations, and that they are found differing in form
and habits, according to climate. This is not the
case with mineral bodies. As far as the nature of
stone and metals is concerned, they are nearly the
same in all countries. Volcanoes, which are minerals in a state of combustion, burn in the same
manner, and with the salne results, in the very
hottest and the very coldest countries.184'I'E MINERAl KINGDOM.
The mineral kingdom forms what is called the
crust of the earth, and includes roclks, metals, chalk,
stones, coal, sand, salt, and other bodies.. What is
termed the- soil, or that soft covering, which serves
for the support of the vegetable kiingdom, is made
up of decayed animals and plants, and of minerals,
which have either been reduced into fine powder,
or broken into small fragments.
The mineral kingdom is as fuill of the beauty
of design, and shows the handy-work of God as
forcibly, as the most finished animal or vegetable.
When we examine it, we find that the different
parts of which it is composed are arranged in a
certain and definite manner, which is the same in
all situations and in all climates.
Our own country is particularly favoured in the
number and valuable nature of its mineral productions. These are, indeed, some of our chief
sources of wealth.
Amongst the most important may be reckoned
coal, iron, lead, copper, lime-stone, clay, buildingstone, and salt.
Almighty wisdom, in laying the foundatioii of
the world, has placed the different parts of the
mineral kingdom in regular order, one kind of
rock, stone, sand, or clay, being laid over the other:
these layers are called stratc, and are founid to be
the same wherever they have been examined.
In some of these strata, or layers, the remains
of animals, such as bones and shells, are found in

called the Georgium   Sidus.
Mercury, the nearest to the sun, being distant
from it thirty-four millions of miles, is 3,200 miles
in diameter, and performs its journey, round the,sun in about eighty-eight days, moving in a single
second nearly thirty of our miles.

LESSON XLIII.
METALS--THEIR PROPERTIES--THEIR USEFULNESS.
METALS form one of the most important parts
of the mineral kingdom.  They are found in the
earth, lying in veins, or narrow beds, generally in
fissures of the rock. Sometimes they are nearly
pure, but more commonly mixed with other mineral bodies, and in tl  state are called ores, as
lead-ore, iron-ore, and copper-ore.
Metals are the heaviest bodies with which we
are acquainted. This may be easily found by taliing
a piece of iron and a piece of stone, or any other
substance of the same size, in each hand; they are
also lustrous or shining, often sonorous, and can
be bent without breaking.
Some of the metals; as gold and silver, more
particularly, may be extended or drawn into veryTHE MINERAL KINGDOM.'
fine wire, and beaten into leaves thinner than the
finest paper. A single ounce of gold may be
spread by the hammer over a surface of one hun
dred and fifty square feet, and yet remain quite
whole, without the least flaw or hole in it; and
the same -quantity may be drawn into a wire more
than a hundred miles long. All of them melt,
or are fused, by heat.
The place from which metals are procured is
termed a mine: these often run to great distances
underground, and the miners are exposed to serious danger at times, from want of a free circulation of air. When the ore has been dug out and
brought to the surface, it has to be freed from the
impurities which are mixed with it: this is done
either by reducing it to a coarse powder, and then
washing it repeatedly, when the water carries off
the lighter particles, and leaves the metal behind;
or it is roasted, that is, mixed with coal and burnt.
T his removes most of the impurities, and it is then
smelted and made fit for use.
No class of the producins of nature are more
useful to man than the metals. In all the arts of
life, and in all our manufactures, they are quite
indispensable: without them, indeed many of these
could never have been carried into effect. Every
implement requiring to be hard, durable, and flexible, is made of metal.  Vessels that have to
be exposed to the action of fifrare made of the
same material, and every thing also used for cutting, where a fine edge is necessary.
187MET ALtS.
Wnerever we look around us, indeed, the utility of these bodies is apparent. Some of them,
besides being extensively employed in the arts,
and for domestic purposes, are coined into money.
Gold and silver are the most important of these, and
in all civilized countries are employed by buyers
and sellers. Commerce is chiefly carried on by
their means, and by the exchange of one article
for another, the value of each being first calculated
by the quantity of gold or silver it is worth. Copper is largely used, amongst ourselves and other
nations, for coin of inferior value.

LESSON XLIII.
IRON, COPPER, TIN, AND LEAD.
OF all the mineral bodies which God has provided for our use, iron is the most universally
valuable. The purposes to which it is applied are
almost numberless. By its means man chiefly
supplies his,wants, as without it agriculture could
never have arrived at any perfection, nor the
plough have rendered the earth fertile. It is also
essential in the preparation of other metals, mining-tools of all sorts being made firom it, so
that were it not for iron, the mineral stores of the
world would not have been available to us.
The greatest part of our manufacturing machinery is constructed of iron; and it is largely
used at the present time in building houses, mills,
and bridges, and in making rail-roads and steamengines: stoves, cannon, knives, scissors, saws,
scythes, and cutlery of every kind are likewise
made from it.
Steel is iron, which has been mnade red-hot in a
charcoal fire. This may be hardened to any degree by being heated, and then suddenly cooled
by plunging it into cold spring water. The ternper given to steel by this mode of proceeding is
so great, that a sword properly prepared will cut
through iron without its edge being turned, or it
will divide a hair or a down feather.
Iron-ore is found in many parts of the world~
189I RON-COPP-E i.
and ahundantly in the United   States. In tno
country is it more valuable than in our oV1,, because we have coal and mechanical contrivances for
procuring it, and turning it into a useful shape.
The loadstone, or natural magnet, is an ore oI
iron.   This possesses very curious properties,
and is capable of transferring them  to any piece
of iron or steel on which it is rubbed. Artificial
magnets made in this manner are very common,
and it is highly curious to watch how they attract
or draw towards them   needles, penknives, and
other things made of iron, and to feel how fast
they hold them. One of the most singular and
valuable properties, however, of the magnet is,
that when properly prepared and nicely balanced,
one end always points to the north.  The needle
contained in the mariner's compass is an artificial
magnet, and by its help ships can be steered over
the widest seas.
The iron-trade has long been one of the staple
trades of our country, and employs a numerous
body of labourers and artisans. Nearly a million
tons are also annually made in Great Britain, some
part of which is exported, but by far the greatest
portion  is used  amongst themselves.   They
send almost two millions' worth of hardware
and cutlery to other countries every year.
Copper is another metal which is applied to many
useful and domestic purposes; boilers, kettles, and
pans being made from, it. Brass is a compound
metal, consisting of copper and another metallic
190body called zinc. Bronze is composed of copper
and tin. Some care is required in using copper.
If acids or fruits are put into vessels of this metal,
they should be well cleaned afterwards, or a green
substance or salt is formed on them, which is
poisonous. For this reason many copper pans are
covered with tin.
Tin, which belongs almost exclusively to England, is found in great quantities in the mines of
Cornwall. It is an important article of commerce,
as the English supply nearly the whole world
with it. Many domestic utensils are made of it,
and when rolled into very thin leaves, called tinfoil, it is used for covering sheets of iron, which
are then termed block-tin, from which cans and
many other things are made.  Pewter is a composition of tin, lead, and brass; and many years ago
was extensively used for making dinner plates and
dishes.
Lead, of which there are many rich mines in
Missouri, and also in England and Wales, is em
ployed for spouts and water-pipes, and is rolled
into sheets for covering roofs. For this purpose
it is better fitted than many other metals, as it is
not liable to be so much injured by the air. Bullets are cast from it in moulds; and small shot is
now made by first melting a quantity, and then
pouring it into an iron vessel pierced with holes,
and placed at the top of a high building: from this
it is allowed to fall to the bottom into water, and
in its descent it assumes a round shape.

LESSON XLIV.
COAL, SULPHUR, AND NAPHTHA.
COAL is another mineral body deserving particu
lar attention. One great reason why the mineral
kingdom is so valuable in Great Britain arises from
her coal, as this enables the people both to bring
them up cheaply from the greatest depths by means
of the steam-engine, and to refine them when thev
are brought to the surface.   Other countries have
coal-mines as well as Great Britain, but few so
plentifully.
192
CO A.L.In various parts of the United States coal is
found abundantly, particularly in Pennsylvania.
Coal and wood, though so different in their appearance, are much of the same nature. Coal-fields
are indeed the remains of vast forests, which have
at some distant period been buried under the surface of the earth, and in the course of time changed
into this mineral. When we examine pieces of
coal, procured from some of our mines, the shapes
of many kinds of plants can be discovered in them.
Some of these impressions are very beautiful, and
so perfect that the particular plant can be easily
named.
Coals are found lying in beds, or strata, and
always with strata of certain other mineral bodies.
By boring some little distance into the earth, we
soon find out whether there are any in that particular situation, for if we bore through one of these
bodies, it is quite certain that coal is below.
This mineral is called combustible, which signifies capable of supporting flame, that is, of being
made into fires. Besides being the food of manufactures and commerce, vast quantities are used as
fuel for domestic purposes, and contribute greatly
to our comfort. In London nearly two million
chaldrons are annually consumed, and in all England upwards of fifteen millions. This amazing
consumption we might suppose would exhaust the
mines. Of this, however, there is no likelihood,
as it has been calculated that there is a supply for
four thousand years; besides which there are
1.93
COAL.SULPHU R-NAPHTHA.
inmmense beds of peat and other vegetable substances, which are slowly undergoing a change
into this mineral.
Sulphur is another combustible body, which is
exceedingly useful in various arts.  Great quantities are found about volcanoes, as Mount ]Etna,
Mount Vesuvius, in Iceland, and Mexico.       It is
an important article of commerce in these countries.
Gunpowder is made in part from sulphur. One
of its principal uses, however, is for making sulphuric acid, which is essential in bleaching, hatmaking, tanning, and dyeing.
Naphtha and petroleum are two combustible
bodies, also belonging to the mineral kingdom.
They are found in various parts of the -world,
either floating on the surface of water, or forming
actual springs. They are very inflammable, and
burn like oil in lamps.

LESSON XLV.
ROCKS-GRAN IT}E-LIME-STO NE-FREE-STONE---
SLATE-CLAY-SALT.
MOUNTAINS and hills are, in general, masses of
rock of various kinds. Some of these tower to
great heights, being many thousand feet above the
level of the sea. One kind of rock called graniite
is very hard, and of this some of the highest mountains are composed. The hardness and toughness
of granite has caused it to be used for laying down
roads, as it lasts much longer than other kinds of
stone: the pavement, the curb-stones, and the carriage-ways in London are, in most instances, of this
rock, which has been brought chiefly from Scotland.
The Astor House in. New York is entirely built
of it, and some of our public buildings are also of
the sarme substance. Granite takes a fine polish,
and is difficult to break.
Lime-stone forms many mountainous ranges in
England, as in Derbyshire, Somersetshire, and
Yorlishire. This kind of rock often contains leadr
ore, and is quite full of fossil remains, so much so,
indeed, that it would seem to be almost entirely
composed of them, principally the shells of molluscous animals. This stone, when burnt in a kiln
with coal, becomes lime, which is largely used in
agriculture, for spreading over the ground, and

called, froml the splendour of its appearance, the
morning star, when it is to the westward of the
sun, and therefore rises before him; and the evening
star, when it is to the eastward of that luminary,
and sets after him.
The Earth, on which we live, is nearly eight
thousand miles in diameter. It revolves upon its
axis in twenty-four hours, which is our day, and
completes its journey round the sun in 365 days,
six hours, and some minutes, which constitute our
year; and it travels in that time 550 millions of
miles. The moon is the constant attendant of the
earth, round which it revolves at the distance of
240,000 miles, and is about 2000 miles in diameter.
The moon is the nearest to us of all the heavenly
bodies; and in size about one sixty-fourth part
of the earth.
Mars is 4,220 miles in diameter, and about
one-fifth as large as the earth. It is 145 millions
of miles from the sun, and revolves round it in 686
days.
Vesta, Juno, Ceres, and Pallas, are four small
planets, discovered in the present century, which
revolve between Mars and Jupiter.   Juno, the
largest of them, is supposed to have a diameter
of about 200 miles, while that of Pallas does not
exceed seventy.  Their distances firom the sunvary between 223 and 260 millions of miles.
Jupiter is nearly 500 millions of miles distant
from the sun, around which it revolves in about
twelve years. It has a diameter of almost 90,000

when slaked or thrown into water, it becomes hot,
and crumbles into a white powder, of which mortar is made, and the whitewash with which many
of our rooms are washed. The different kinds of
marbles are lime-stone. Many beautiful kinds are
found in the United States, but the finest and best
are imported from Italy and Sicily.
The most useful stones for building are freestone and sand-stone. Granite, which is the most
durable, is so difficult to work, that it is very expensive; but the Portland-stone is softwhen taken
out of the quarry or stone pit, and may be cut
very easily, by a saw, into blocks of a proper size;
when it has been exposed some time to the air it
hardens.
Clay is found lying in vast beds under the soil
of many countries. It is generally stiff, somewhat
tenacious, and capable, by the addition of a little
water, of being moulded into a variety of shapes.
Clay is of very great utility. Bricks, so much
used for building houses, are made of it.
All kinds of earthenware are made from a clay
called potters'-clay. England is particularly famous for her manufacture of pots, and one large
district in Staffordshire is named the Potteries,
from its being almost covered with works devoted
to this purpose.
Common salt, which is of such importance to
u.~, as a seasoning for our food, and in nlany of
the arts, is found either dissolved in water, as in
salt springs and sea-water, or in solid masses, as
196rock salt.  This last is dug out of the earth like
other minerals; the salt is procured from springs
and firom   sea water, by allowing the liquid to
evaporate.   The   United   States is rich   in  saltsprings, and they are also plentifully found in
many other countries.

ON THE
STRUCTURE, SENSES, AND HABITS
OF
MAN.
LESSON I.
OF MAN IN GENERAL.
MAN, who in the beginning obtained from God
"dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the
fowl of the air, and over every living thing that
moveth upon the earth," obtained from him also
higher powers, and a structure of a superior kind.
Man is the only creature on our earth that
walks erect. This position of the body enables
us to look forwards, or around us, with ease, and
gives us an appearance of authority and dignity.
Man is the only being possessed of hands. By
the aid of these beautiful organs he can perform a
multitude of wonderful and delicate operations,
quite- beyond the reach of other creatures. He
builds houses, makes clothes, constructs the most
curious machines, and applies them to an endless
variety of purposes.
The mechanism of the hand is at once perfect
and beautiful. Animals of the tribe of monkeys(O It! AN.
approach the nearest to us in this respect, and are
called quadrrtmaanous, or four-handed; but their
thumbs are exceedingly imperfect, as compared
with ours, and their hands altogether fitted for
different purposes.
The noblest gift, however, which has been
bestowed upon man by our bountiful Creator, is
THE SOUL; an intelligent and immortal principle,
including the miind and affections. It is this
which raises us above all other animals, for it
enables us to love God, to reason, to think, and to
compare. It is this which makes us charitable;
generous, and humane; which gives us taste and
ingenuity, a sense of right and wrong, and above
all, of religion. Hence we see, on every side,
places of public worship, hospitals for the sick
poor, manufactories, and courts of justice. It is
this also wvhich makes man, though naturally the
most defenceless of creatures, the most powerful,
and capable of overcoming "every thing that
inoveth on the face of the earth."
Most animals are provided with some outward
means of defence. Oxen have a thick and tough
skin covered with hair, and horns and hoofs; the
tortoise has its armour of shell; and the lion has
teeth and strong claws.
Man has nothing whatever of this kiind, but his
reasoning faculty enables him to take measures
by which he may protect himself from the fiercest
and strongest among other creatures, and to destroy
them for his own benefit.
199It is the soul' also which displays itself in our
speech,-which enables us to improve ourselves,
to acquire knowledge, and to become wise, learned,
and good. How different from otlrselves is man
in a savage state! how rude his habits! how ignorant he is! and how few are his wants! yet this
man, having a soul and reason, may, by care, be
raised to our own level.
This is not the case with brutes.      The bird
built its nest, and the mole burrowed out its underground dwelling, in the very earliest ages of the
world, as perfectly and just in the same way as at
present; and will continue to do the same as long
as they exist, without change or improvement.

OF MiAN..THE HUMAN BODY.
LESSON II.
GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN BODY.
OUR body is a wonderfuil piece of machinery,
perfect in all its parts, curious in all its arrangement, and admirably fitted for our peculiar wants.
We have going on within us, at all times, an
infinite variety of singular operations, such as
digestion, nutrition, secretion, and circulation;
and yet we are not sensible of them, although there
are thousands of vessels at work; some removing
parts, some laying down fresh matter, some carrying black blood, some red blood, some bile, and
some watery fluids.
The heart contracts and expands, and sends a
stream of fresh blood through our bodies seventy
or eighty times every minute. The lungs are
filled with fresh air, and this is returned quite
changed above a thousand times every hour, and
all these things are done so gently, and by parts
so perfectly made, that were we not told of the
wonders within us, we should be in ignorance of
their existence. Let us, however, inquire about
them; and an examination of our own frames
cannot fail to increase our love of God's goodness,
and our admiration of his almighty wisdom and
power.
Our bodies consist of solid and fluid parts. The
fluids are by far the most plentiful. The body of
2011' tHE HItUMAN BODY.
a full grown native of the Azores, where the
people formerly exposed their dead in open places
to be dried by the sun, has been found weighing
not more than twelve pounds, though the bones
and other solids were quite perfect: yet this must
have weighed at least 120 lbs. when living, or in
its natural state.
Alost of our organs are double. Thus we have
two eyes; the nose is divided; the tongue consists
of two parts; the neck has a set of muscles and
vessels on each side; we have two arms and.
hands; two legs and feet; and the brain consists
of two divisions. These double parts are very
similar in their structure.
Those organs by which we move from place to
place, and eat, drink, and perform manual labour,
and other actions, are under our own government
or will: that is, we can employ them or not, just
as we choose; hence they are named voluntary.
Other organs, on the constant action of which
our very life depends, are not under our own
government.  The heart, the lungs, the intestines, and other parts, act, whether we are
waking or sleeping, whether we wish or not, and
on this account are called involuntary. Over
these our Divine Author has given us no power,
or our lives would be in continual danger, as
our passions and negligence might prove our
destruction.
The whole body is covered with skin. This
serves as a protection to the delicate and sensitive'002THE HUMAN BODY.
parts beneath. The outside of the skin is in itself
insensible, but it is so thin that we feel through it.
The importance of the skin as a defence against
pain, is soon known when a portion is removed by
a blister or by any other means; we cannot then
bear any thing to come near the part; even the
very air gives us an uneasy feeling.
All the parts of our body are held together by
a fine membrane or web; called from its form the
cellular membrane; as it is made up of a number
of very small cells. This makes parts play easily
one over another, and lets them distend or swell
out, without doing injury. It is also through this
that vessels and nerves pass from one part to
another.
Questions.
Mention some 9.f the operations constantly going on
within us.
Are we sensible of these operations.
What kinds of fluids are carrying backwards and forwards
in our vessels?
How often does the heart act in a minute?
How many times are the lungs filled and emptied in an
hour.
Of what are our bodies composed.
Are the solids or fluids most abundant.

What parts act without our knowledge or will.

e03'2BONES, JOINTS, MUSCLES.
LESSON III.
ORGANS OF SUPPORT AND MOTION-BONESJOINTS--MUSCLE S.
CERTAIN parts of our bodies are very hard and
firm; these are called bones, and consist, in a
great measure, of earthy matter. When these are
jointed, or articulrated together, they form the
skeleton.
The form and make of the skeleton are beautifully perfect, and fitted to our system  with the
most surprising art; so far is the skeleton from
being a thing to cause terror, that the more we
examine it, the more we admire it.
The bones form the frame work of the body, on
which the soft parts are arranged and supported.
They are held together by means of ligaments,
which are strong, whitish bands, crossing from one
bone to another, and commonly called gristle.
The ends of the bone, where they meet, are covered with a substance somewhat like gristle, called
cartilage. This is very elastic, or springy, and
preserves them from being injured by the shocks
and motions of our bodies. That they may move
easily one upon another, they are furnished with
glandular bodies, which keep them  constantly
smooth by means of an oily fluid. The places
where bones meet are called joints, as the shoulder204BONES, JOINTS, MUSCLES.
joint, the elbow-joint, the wrist-joint, the kneejoint, and others.
The number of bones in the human body is
about 260. They are divided into the bones of
the head, of the trunlk or body, of the upper extremities or arms, and of inferior extremities or
legs. Their shapes are very various, some being
long, round, and hollow, as those of the thigh, the
leg, and the arm; others are flat, as the shoulderblade, the breast-bone, and the bones of the head;
and others are in small rounded pieces, as those of
the hands and feet.
Bones are very soft in infancy, only part of them
being ossified, or made into bone. As we grow
older, and have occasion to use our limbs for motion and support, they harden; and about the
fifteenth year of our age, are perfect.
Muscles are the organs or parts by which we
move our bodies. WVhat we call flesh is muscle,
and this consists of a number of fibres, or little
threads, bound together in bundles, by the cellular
membrane, and a strong sheath on the outside.
One of these bundles forms a muscle. Muscles are
fastened to the bones by a tough strong substance,
which seems to grow into it.
Muscles have the power of shortening and
lengthening themselves, and thus produce motion.
For example, stretch out your arm:-this is done
by the muscles at the back of the upper arm, which
arise above the elbow-joint, and are fixed into the
bone below it. When these contract or shorten
S.
205miles, aind is 1470 times as large as the earth.
This planet, the largest of the solar system, is remarkable for four moons, which move round it, as
our moon moves round the earth, and- during its
nights, reflect upon it light received from  the
sun.
Saturn is at the distance of nearly 900 millions
of miles from the sun, about 80,000 miles in
diameter, and requires twenty-nine years and a
half to perform  his journey.  Saturn has seven
moons revolving round it, and reflecting upon it
the sun's light, and it is encircled also by a broad
ring, that is always brilliant.  The ring is composed of two distinct parts, separated by a space
of about 250 miles. It is in breadth about onethird of Saturn's diameter, and at the same distance
from the planet.
The planet Uranus takes eighty-three years to
complete its revolution round the sun.  Its distance from that luminary is 1803 millionts of miles.
Being about 40,000 miles in diameter, it is seventyeight times as large as our earth.
COlMETS.
A class of moving bodies, occasionally seen,
followed by a train of light, which bears a fancied
resemblance to flowing hair, are thence called
comets.  At their first appearance, comets are
scarcely perceptible, but as they approach the sun,
they increase in size and velocity; and then, by
degrees, diminish and disappear.  Their motions

themselves, therefore, they pull the arm backwards,
or stretch it out.  For this reason they are called
extensors, or extending muscles.
Now bend your arm. This motion is perform
ed by the muscles on the front of the arm. These
are fixed at their upper ends above the elbow, near
the shoulder, and at their lower ends just below
the elbow. When these contract or shorten themselves, they pull the arm upwards, and thus bend
it. On this account they are called flexors, or bending muscles, and the same throughout the body.
Muscles, before they terminate, or are fixed into
the bone, are generally reduced to a thick cord of
white glistening substance, which is very strong,
and called tendon.  Where this passes over joints,
it is bound down by a strong band, to keep it in
its place when the muscle is acting, and to preserve
the shape or symmetry of the parts.
The power with which muscles contract is very
great, and is termed irritability.  Our voluntary
muscles are soon tired, and require rest, or they
get weak, but those which are involuntary are in
perpetual motion, and are never fatigued, but keep
acting, without rest, from the hour of our birth to
that of our death.

LESSON IV.
STANDING-WALKING-RUNNING-LEAPINGSITTING.
THE principal actions which our bodies can perform, are standing, walking, running, leaping, and
sitting. Besides- these, the hand and fingers are
capable of a wonderful variety of minute and
delicate operations; and the muscles of other parts
of our bodies, as the face, the throat, and the eyes
have each a great variety of motions.
How do you stand? Your body is erect, and
you keep yourself from inclining either to one side
or the other. If it were the will of God that you
should die in this posture, you would fall down at
once; or if any other cause should deprive you of
207STANDING, WALKING.
strength, or if you should fall asleep, or forget
yourself, the same thing would follow.
Standing is, therefore, an action of the voluntary
muscles; you wish to stand, and that enables you
to do it. This is done by what we may call a
balance of action between the two great orders of
muscles, the Jexors, and the extensors. These
extensors, by acting on the bones, keep the limbs
and trunk erect, whilst the flexors yield and make
no efforts to contract.
By these means, we are enabled to retain an
upright posture. But we are soon fatigued by it.
This is owing to there being no change of action,
one set of muscles only being employed. Hence
when we are obliged to stand for a long time, we
are continually changing our posture, now resting
on one leg, and then on the other. This is done
in order to relieve the muscles from their state of
continued action, by calling others for a moment
into play.
Walking is easier to us than standing quite
still, for this reason, that both sets of muscles,
namely, the flexors and extensors, act now one and
now the other, and thus are constantly relieving
each other.
When we walk, one leg is lifted and carried forwards; at the same time, the body is made to rest
on the leg that is planted on the ground. The leg
which has been carried forwards is now fixed on
the ground, and the body is shifted upon it, by the
strong muscles of the trunk and thigh bone. Thus
-208W'VALKING, RUNNTING, LiEAP'INLG.
what is called the centre of gravity--or the
point on which the greatest weight falls-is borne
by turns upon each limb, and we move forwards
step by step.
Running and leaping are varieties of the same
action, as when we run, we rnmake a succession of
short leaps. These differ from walking, inasmuch
as in the latter action the body always rests on one
limb; whilst, in leaping and running, it is for a time
raised quite above the ground, and carried forwards by the impetus or fbrce which has been
given to it.
Now, how is this managed? When we wish to
leap, we bend our body forwvard. In this state, we
exert violently all the extensor or stretching muscles of these parts, as well as those of the arms; and
such is their power, that they lift us up, and throw
us to very considerable distances. When we run
fast, our'bodies acquire so much velocity, that we
cannot stop at once, as we can. in walking, but are
obliged to check ourselves by degrees.
It is highly useful and necessary to exercise
ourselves in walking, running, leaping, and other
actions requiring the use of our muscles.  By
these means, they become stronger, and capable of
more exertion, and we are less liable to fatigue.
This exercise is called gymnastics, but we should
be careful not to over exert ourselves, many injuries
and accidents having arisen from a want of due
caution.

LESSON V.
VESSELS OF THE HUMAN BODY IN GENERALARTERIES-VEINS.
NOTHING is more surprising than the vast number of vessels, filled with different kinds of fluids,
which crowd our bodies in every part. If we
prick ourselves with the finest needle, blood is
sure to follow,-a proof that it has wounded some
vessel.
Vessels are tubes having thin yet strong coats.
One set of vessels carries the blood from the heart
-these are called arteries; another set receives
it, and carries it back-these are called veins; a
third takes up the nourishing juicgs from our intestines-these are called lacteals; a fourth set rises
from the surfaces of the joints and other places, and
210ARTERIES, VEINS.
removes the fluids which are poured out into them
-these are called absorbents; a fifth set covers
the surface of the body, the mouth, the linings of
other great cavities, and is always exuding or
secreting fluid to keep them moist--these are called secretory vessels.  How wonderful it is, that
we can run, jump, and perform other violent exercises, without disturbing the action of these thousands of delicate organs.
The arteries are the vesse.ls which convey blood
from the heart to all parts of the body. One great
artery arises directly from the heart. This is very
large. Before it has gone far, however, it begins
to divide, or branch, and, in its progress along the
body, it sends off divisions to all the parts which
it passes.
When this has reached the lower part of the
back-bone, it divides itself into two large vessels,
one of which goes downwards to supply each of
the lower limbs. These branches, as they pass
along, keep ramifying, or dividing, till they are
so small, that we can no longer trace them.
Every thread of muscle, and the coats of the
arteries themselves, are thus abundantly provided
with small vessels; nay, so full are the muscles,
that their red colour is owing to blood vessels.
The large arteries are very carefully protected
from injury, and generally lie buried deep amongst
the muscles. Were they to be cut, we should soon
bleed to death. There are some places, as the
wrist and the elbow, where they have to pass over
1211ART]ERIEES VEINS.
joints, and where they must come near the surface.
We should be careful about these parts, as many
accidents have happened from boys playing carelessly with penknives.
When we put our finger upon an artery, it is
found to beat, or pulsate; and if one is pricked,
the blood springs from. it in jets, and is of a bright
florid vermilion colour.
Arteries, when they have divided into the smallest branches, and reached the extreme parts of the
body, end, by inosculating, or meeting mouth to
mouth, with the beginnings of veins.  These carry
the blood back to the heart, as it has become changed in its qualities during its progress through the
system, and requires to' be renewed,
The coats of veins are much thinner than those
of arteries, and they are provided with valves to
assist the blood along them. The blood passes
along veins slowly, and is of a dark colour. When
one is opened, its contents escape in a quiet stream,
and not in jets or leaps, like those of an artery.
The blue lines which we see under our skin are
veins. These continue to enlarge as they approach
the heart, and end in very large vessels, which
pour the blood into one of its parts.

LESSON VI.
NERVES   GLANDS--SECRETION.
TWHEN we examine the great blood vessels, we
generally find that they have lying near them
white cords. These are nerves.
All nerves are connected either with the brain
or spinal marrow. Like the arteries, they are
large at their beginning, and as they remove from
it, become smaller and smaller, by sending off
branches. These end in the substance of our
bodies, in filaments or twigs, so very small, that
we should not know of their presence, were it not
that the parts are sensible, or possess feeling.
Nerves are the organs by which we are made
acquainted with the world around us. By their
means, we feel, see, hear, smell, and taste. If the
nerve supplying the tongue is injured, we can no
longer perceive that what we eat has any flavour.
213NERVES, GLANDS, SECRETION.
If the nerve supplying one of the fingers is cut
through, that finger is no longer sensible; we may
prick it, or crush it, and feel no pain.
Besides this, we can no longer move it, as the
nerves are the medium by which we will, or call
muscles into play. We thus see that a person who
labours under palsy, which is a disease of the brain
or spinal marrow, from which nerves proceed, cannot move the affected limb; it hangs down quite
powerless and useless.
Every part of our body, except the hair, the
nails, the bones, and some others, is full of nervous
twigs or filaments. We cannot cut or scratch ourselves anywhere without feeling pain. We should
not suffer this, were it not that a nerve is cut or
torn.
We find, in certain parts of our system, small,
roundish, or oval bodies, abundantly supplied with
blood vessels and nerves.  These are glandgs.
When we have a bad cold and sore throat, many
of these may be felt about the neck, as they swell
and become painful at these times. The breast is
also a gland, and there are many others in various
places. When we examine them, we see many
vessels going from them, which, in some instances,
unite and form what is called a duct, or outlet.
These glands are the parts of secretion. A
secretion means a peculiar fluid made friom the
blood, as the saliva, the tears, bile, and others.
The gland secreting the saliva lies on the cheek,
iust before the ear, and the duct opens in the
214NERVES, GLANDS, SECRETION.
inside of the mouth. The lachrymal, or tear,
gland is concealed in the orbit of the eye. When
we weep, it secretes very copiously.
The tearls are   carried away through a little
opening, which may be seen. at the inner corner
of the lower eyelid. This is the orifice, or mouth,
of a duct leading into the nose, and hence called
the nasal duct.
The secretions are very much under the influence of our feelings: thus, when we are in sorrow, we shed tears almost in spite of ourselves;
and if we suffer severe pain, the same thing occurs
unless we are very determined.

THE FIXED STARS.
The other heavenly bodies which are seen in
the firmament are called fixed stars. The number of stars which may be seen at any time by the
naked eye is not much above one thousand; but
44,000 have been discovered by the aid of the
telescope.   These stars have been- arranged by
astronomers into various collections called constellations, and names are given to them, as, the great
bear, the virgin, the scales, &amp;c. All these constellations are delineated on the celestial globe.

LESSON VII.
THE SXIN-HAIR--NAILS.
THE whole of our body is covered by slrin,
The structure of the skin is very curious, and it is
impossible to look at it without being reminded of
the care which our Creator has bestowed upon us.
The skin consists of three layers, or coats. The
outside one is called the epidermis, or scarf skin,
and is very elastic or stretching. It is pierced
with innumerable holes, through which the hair
passes, and the perspiration exudes. It is, moreover, quite insensible, and appears to have no blood
vessels. With great care, we may thrust a needle
through it, and neither see blood, nor feel pain: and
when we are scalded or burnt, or have a blister
applied to us, it is seen raised in the form of a bladder. It is also half-transparent, and shows the
colour of the parts beneath it.
The epidermis is stretched over some of our
limbs in little folds. Look at the joints of your
fingers. Bend them, and observe how these folds
disappear. Besides where we cannot see any folds,
the epidermis is capable of great extension. There
is a disease called emphysema, and another,
dropsy, in which it is stretched out amazingly, yet
when the cause is removed, it recovers its tone,
and, after a time, becomes smooth as before, though
at first it is a good deal wrinkled.
Under the epidermis, lies a second coat. This.16SKIN, HAIR, NAILS.
is very soft, and it'seems to be rather a layer of
mautcus, or slime, than a distinct lining, and, for
this reason, it is named the rete mucosum, or
mnUCous coat.
It is this which gives colour to the skin, as the
scarf skin itself is colourless in all nations. But
very little of it is found beneath our own skins,
our colour being chiefly owing to the parts below.
In the Negro, it is black and plentiful; in the native American, copper coloured; and in the Malays,
olive.
The next layer is the true skin, or coriumn.
This is much thicker than the others, and quite
spongy. It is made up of a network of arteries,
veins, nerves, and secretory vessels.
This is the most sensible part of our bodies, and
we could not bear to be touched, were it not protected, and its sensibility blunted, by the epidermis, or scarf skin. When a piece of this last is
removed and the corium exposed, the vessels immediately secrete a thickish fluid, called lymph;
into these new vessels shoot, and, in the course of
a few days, it is changed into proper skin.
The surface of our bodies is, in a great measure,
covered with hair.  In general, these hairs are
very delicate and small, and do not take away
from the smoothness of the skin. The head, lhowever, is thicklly clothed, and there the hair grows
long.
Hair was given to mankind to serve, in some
sort, as a protection against the weather.
T
217.SIKIN. HAIRI, NAILS
Every hair is a hard and elastic tube, growing
from an oval bulb beneath the true skin.
The backs of the ends of our fingers and toes
are covered and supported by nails. These are
smooth, horny in their texture, and have no feeling.  They are formed from      a very tender part,
called the root.   The mode in which the skin is
folded under and around the nails is exceeding
beauitiful.
Nails are highly useful to us in touching and
grasping bodies, and in walking, as they afford a
firm support to the soft fleshy extremities.

218'DIGESTIVE ORGANS.
LESSON VIII.
THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION.
AS there is a constant waste going on in our
bodies, it is needful that it should be regularly supplied with nourishment.' For this purpose, we take
food, and have a stomach and various other parts,
fitted for changing it into a proper form for repairing our system.
The changes which our food undergoes to prepare it, constitute what is called digestion; and the
actual laying down of new matter by the different
vessels is called the process of nutrition.
The stomach is a hollow bag, placed just below
the breast bone, and lying partly across the body.
It is large enough in a grown man to hold about
three pints of fluid, and is joined to the mouth by
a tube, or passage, called the gullet. The opening into this is seen lying quite at the back of the
throat, and it receives the food after it has been
crushed by the teeth, or masticated, and mixed
with saliva. In this pulpy state it is passed into
the stomach by the gullet pressing it downwards.
After the food has remained in the stomach for
a time, it begins to contract and pushes it through
an opening into the intestines.
The intestines form  one continued canal, or
tube, about five or six yards long, lying in a wonlerfully small space, and most curiously folded one,Apon another.
2is220
They have several coats or linings, the inner one
being red, full of plaits, and covered with little
eminences, termed villi, which give it a velvety
appearance. These villi are the beginnings of the
vessels which convey away the nourishing juice.
The outer coat of the intestines is smooth and
shining, and always moistened by a watery fluid
to keep it soft, and to allow the parts to move
easily over each other.
Between these two coats is another, called the
muscular coat. It is this which enables the intestines to push forward their contents, and which
gives to them a constant motion, something like
that of a worm when crawling, and hence called,
vermicular, or peristaltic.
Different names have been given by anatomists
to different parts of the intestines, and the whole
are divided into the large and the small. The
small intestines receive the food from the stomach,
and the useless parts are allowed to collect in the
large ones, till it is proper and needful that it be
discharged.
The liver is another part closely connected with
the stomach. It is a large, dark-looking glandular
body, filled with veins, and makes a peculiar fluid,
which is of a yellowish colour, and very bitter.
This is bile. This fluid is collected in a little
bladder seated under the liver, and called the gall
bladder. From this it is carried by a duct into
the upper part of the small intestines, where it is
mixed with the food.
DIGESTIVE OR&amp;Ai'N,The importance of bile may be judged of from
the fact that our food never digests well when it is
too small in quantity, or its properties are changed
by disease.  In jaundice, the bile, in place of being
poured into the intestines, is carried into the blood,
and tinges the whole body with a yellowish hue.
There are several other glands in union with the
stomach   and intestines.    These   secrete various
fluids, which serve some useful purpose in digestion.

221222               THE TEETH.
LESSON IX.
THE TEETH-CONVERSION OF FOOD INTO BLOOD--
DIGESTION.
No part of our bodies is more remarkable than
the teeth; and none can more clearly show us how
much wisdom and design have been bestowed upon
our form by the Divine Architect of the universe.
If you look into the mouth of a very young
child, you see no teeth. The gums are low and
rounded, and show no marks of the great change
that a few months will produce in theimi. There
are, however, buried beneath them, two or more
complete sets of teeth, each tooth shut up in a
little bag, or capsule, and separate from the rest.
Now why is it that infants are without teeth?
Because at this period of our lives we live upon
milk and other soft diet, and because our digestive
organs are not fitted to receive food so solid as to
require chewing. After a time, as we become
stronger, and require different food, the teeth appear in regular order; first the front teeth, then
the side teeth, and lastly the double teeth.
The set of teeth which first appears, occupies
only part of the jaw, and is generally completed
about the ilifant's second or third year. These
teeth are called -the milk-teeth, and are shed, with
the exception of six or eight, in the course of three
or four years. Our bodies are now become stronger,CONVERSION OF FOOD.
and our mouths wider, and for this change God has
provided.
At this time, the second, or permanent, set of
teeth pushes forwards, and gradually displaces, the
others.  This set, when complete, consists of
thirty two teeth, sixteen in each jaw; but they
seldomi- all appear till we are fourteen or fifteen
years of age, as there is not room for them before
we have reached nearly our full growth.
That part of a tooth which stands up above the
gum is called the crown, and is covered by a very
hard ivory-like substance, termed enamel. The
roots of the single teeth, and the fangs of the double ones are hollow, and contain a nerve, artery,
and vein. The nerve, when exposed or inflamed,
gives rise to that distressing pain, called toothach.
Trhe food which we eat to supply the waste in
our bodies, is first submitted to the action of the
teeth. These, by their hardness and sharpness,
break it into small fragments, whilst the glands
give out saliva in abundance.
By these means the food is made into a soft pulp,
and in this state it passes into the stomach. When
it is received there, the vessels of that part throw
out a fluid called the gastric juice. This is a very
powerful solvent, and by mixing with the food,
brings it into a half fluid state, when it is called?hyme, and is of a grayish colour.
This change being finished, the lower opening
of the stomach, which had remained fast closed,
225whilst it was going on, opens and permits the
chyme to pass into the small intestines.  Here it
is made still more fluid, by the addition of various
juices, and becomes of a milky whiteness, and now
-it is called chyle.  In this state it meets with the
bile, which is supposed to have the property of
separating the nutritious from the useless parts.
The reader has learnt that the inner surface of
the small intestines is lined by villi, which are
the mouths of lacteals. These are now actively
at work, taking up the milky part of the chyle,
and carrying it to a number of glands, where is
undergoes some farther change.
From  these it is carried forwards, till all the
lacteals are at last collected into one large duct.
which conveys the stream of chyle, now fitted for
mixing with the blood, along the spine, up as high
as the neck; here it opens into one of the great
veins, and after passing through the heart and
lungs, becomes perfectly mixed, and ready for
nutrition.
These are the changes undergone by our food
before it becomes blood, and they come under the
general term, digestion.

THE HEART-CIRCULATION OrF THE BLOODTHE BLOOD.
THE heart is a wonderful piece of machinerv.
At one moment it shuts itself and forces a stream'of blood through all parts of our bodies, by means
of the arteries; the next it opens and receives it
back again from  the veins, and these actions con
tinue, night and day, throughout our lives.
If any thing were to interfere with this we
should die immediately.
The heart is a hollow body, placed in the left
side of the chest.  Its broad end, or base, is turned
upwards, and its narrow end, or tapex, a little crossiwise and downwvards.   It is enclosed in a loose
bag or purse, in which its apex moves freely,
striking against the side every time it contracts.

LESSON IV.
FORM AND MIAGNITUDE OF TIIE EARTH.
IT is difficult to discover the form of the earth
by merely looking upon it, because we can see
but a small part of it at once, and because we are
too near to it.  The general form of an object is,
lhowever, to be ascertained by the form     of its
shadow.   Now, whenever the earth, in its journey
rouiind the sun, happens to be in a straight line
between the sun and the Tnoon, it always casts a
circular shadow upon the face of the moon, and
thus we know     that the earth is round, like a
globe.
The circumference of the earth is about 25,000
miles.  It is possible, then, to. travel round the
earth. If you turn your back on your home,
and continue to travel with your face to the west,
the quarter in which the sun sets, you will arrive
at home again from    the east, or the quarter in
19226     CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.
It is this which we feel when we place our hand
over the fifth and sixth ribs.
The heart is divided into four cavities, or chambers, which have thick walls of muscle, and it is
into these chambers that the blood is received, and
by these muscles that it is forcibly pushed out.
Besides these, it has several very curious valves to
keep the blood flowing in its propel' directions.
The heart may be called double, one part being
employed in forcing the blood through the body
at large, and another in forcing it through the
lungs.
We have mentioned how our food is changed
into blood; let us now see in what way the blood
is passed to all parts of the system, for the purpose
of nourishing them, and supplying the waste.
The heart-is the great centre of the circulation,
and is placed between the two sets of blood vessels
already described; namely, the arteries and veins.
From these last, one of the chambers of the heart
is filled with dark or venous blood, no longer fitted
to serve the wants of the system, as it is mixed
with the chyle and other matters. This chamber
contracts, and forces it into a second and strongei
one, which, in its turn, drives it through the lungs.
Here it gives off its impurities, and becomes a
bright red, or arterial blood. From  hence it
flows back into a third chamber, and from this into
the fourth, which is the most powerful of them all,
and from which the great artery arises. Into thisTHE BLOOD.
it is thrown with great force, and urged on into the
farthest vessels.
These are the feeders of the body, and when
they have supplied what is needful, they end in
minute veins, by which the blood is again brought
to the heart, which opens to receive it.
This is the round of the circulation, which is
continued without stop or rest, and without any
wish or action of our own, our all-wise Maker
having placed it out of our control. This alternate
shutting and opening of our hearts produces that
motion in our arteries called the pulse.
In childhood the heart beats upwards of a hundred times in a minute; in youth, about eighty,
and in manhood, from    sixty to seventy.  In
fevers and some other diseases, it also beats very
quickly. There is no pulsation in veins.
The blood from which all our solid and fluid
parts are formed, when it is first drawn from a
vein or artery, looks like a simple liquid. After
it has stood, however, for a little while, it coagulates, as it is termed, and separates into three very
distinct parts.  When we look at it, we see a red
mass swimming in a straw coloured liquid. This
liquid is slightly viscid and salt to the taste, and is
called serum. The mass is made up of two bodies,
one a fine thready matter, which is named fibrin,
and' the other of red globules, or little round bodies. The fibrin, being heavier than the serum,
falls to the bottom as it cools, and carries with it
the globules.

LESSON XI.
THE  LUNGS AND     THEIR    APPENDAGESRESPIRATION.
ONE of the most important actions of our system
is breathing.   This is so essential to life, that if it
be interrupted for a very short space of time, we
die from suffocation. Breathing consists of two
actions: inspiration, or drawing in the air; and
expiration, or forcing out the air.
The lungs are soft, spongy bodies, full of very
small hollows, called air-cells. The thorax, or
228cavity of the chest, in which the lungs are contained, is covered by the ribs and breast-bone, and
is divided by a broad muscle from the abdomen.
This nluscle, which is named the diaphragm, is
the great agent in breathing. There are also several other muscles fixed to the ribs and other parts
which assist it. The lungs themselves are in two
divisions, lying one on each side of the chest, with
the heart between them.   These divisions are
termed the right and left lobes.
When we feel the front of our neclks, we find a
hard body. This is a tube, and composed of oartilagin'bos, or gristly rings, so that it is always kept
open, and is named the trachea, or windpipe. It
is through this that the air is conveyed to and
fronm the lungs.
The windpipe opens at the back of the mouth,
before the entrance into the gullet, so that all our
food has to pass over it. How does it happen that
none of the food gets into it? Now and then, indeed, this does occur, and is followed by the most
serious consequences, and often by death.
When we are eating fast or,carelessly, a crumb
will sometimes slip into what we familiarly call
the wrong passage, that is, it gets into the windpipe. To prevent this constantly happening, it is
protected in a very curious way. The opening into
it is a narrow slit, called the rizna; the part itself
is named the glottis; and over the slit is fixed a
moveable little body, or valve, called the epiglottis; and this is so arranged, that whenever we

are about to swallow, the motion of the tongue
pulls down this covering an'd closes up the opening with the utmost nicety.
How wonderfLul and beautiful this is, as we are
not sensible of it; and if before swallowing we had
always to think and exercise our will in shutting
this aperture, how different would be the process
of eating, and how frequently must accidents happen from our forgetfulness!
Why is it that breathing is so absolutely essential to our life? For this reason,-that the blood,
in its passage through the body, is changed, becomes dark coloured, and is no longer fit to support life. In this state it reaches the heart, and
before it is sent back into the arteries, it is passed
through the lungs. Here it is purified by an exposure to the air, through the thin linings of the
air-cells, with which the lungs are quite filled, and
all of which communicate with each other, and
with the windpipe. After this exposure, the blood
becomes of a bright red colour, is taken back to
the heart, and thrown into the body for its support.
The blood being thus changed, let us see what
change has been undergone by the air in our
lungs. If you put a piece of quill into the nozle
of a pair of bellows, and blow into a cup of lime
water, you will find no change in its appearance.
You blow into it just the same kind of air which
you draw into your lungs. But now put the quill
into your mouth, and blow into the lime water,
and you will see that it becomes turbid and white,

and if allowed to stand, a fine powder falls to the
bottom.
The air which vou have blown into the water
has passed through your lungs, and during its progress has lost a part of its oxygen, and in its place
we find fixed air, or carbonic acid. It is this which
causes the lime wvater to become white, by uniting
with it.
This fixed air is very unwholesome;-animals
soon die if confined in it, and this is the reason
why close and crowded rooms are so unhealthy, as
the air becomes very impure, and unfit for breathing. We soon become oppressed and languid in
these situations, and whenever we feel these symptoms, we should have the room      ventilated, or remove to more open places.

2312THE VOICE.
LESSON XII.
THE ORGANS OF VOICE-WARMTH OF THE HUMAN
BODY.
THE organs of voice are in close union with,
and, indeed, form part of, the parts used for breathing. They are placed at the upper end of the
windpipe, so that the current of air necessary to
respiration passes through them.
If you feel with your fingers just below the
chin, you find the thyroid cartilage, a prominence
which has a somewhat triangular shape; and, in
common language, is not unfrequently called
Adam's apple.
This projection is composed of several pieces of
hard substance, very curiously contrived and put
together, and forming a hollow body which encloses the parts producing sound. These are four
chords, called the cordae vocales, which pass from
side to side like strings, and it is the rush of air
over these that gives rise to our voice. There are
several muscles connected with these cords, which
can tighten or relax them, and thus produce different tones.
The tongue, the lips, the cheeks, and the palate
assist in modulating or shaping the sounds which
proceed from the parts above- named. By these
means we articulate, or speak, that is, express
ourselves in words or language. Reason, which
23_N2 iMiAL HE AT.
our bountifill AMaker has given to us, enables us
to clothe all our ideas and varieties of thought and
feelings in equally varied tones and language.
Other animals have voice also, but the want of reason confines its use to the expression of their simplest wants.
During a severe cold when the vocal organs are
inflamed and thickened, our voice is hoarse and
indistinct; and if the parts are so much swollen as
to prevent their usual action, our voice is lost, and
we speak in a whisper.
The warmth of our bodies is a very wonderful
circumstance. It is called animal heat, and depends on respiration. By this heat, we are preserved at nearly the same temperature, whatever
the nature of the climate may be around us. This
is confined to the animal kingdom.
If we examine a mineral or a vegetable, we shall
always find it just of the same heat as the air,
whilst our own body never varies more than three
or four degrees from 96~ of the thermometer; and
this, whether we are surrounded by an atmosphere
many degrees below the freezing point, or by one
nearly as hot as boiling water.
Now this is a very remarkable fact, and shows
how wonderfully we are constituted, thus to resist
the influence of changes from heat to cold which
must have proved fatal to us, or confined us to a
particular climate like many animals, or forced us
to migrate at certain seasons. It is this, together
with the power of accommodating ourselves by

LESSON XIII.
THE BRAIN-THE SPINAL MARROW--ORIGIN OF
NERVES--SUPERIORITY OP MAN.
ALMIGHTY GOD, in making our bodies, has carefully protected those parts which are most important to our well being. Thus the heart and the
lungs are covered and shielded by the ribs, breastbone, and spine; and the stomach is placed amidst
soft and yielding parts, that it may give way to
blows or fulness. It is, however, in those organswhich are the seat of mind, and which make us
intelligent and sentient creatures, that wisdom and
care are most conspicuous.
The brain is at once the most important and
most delicate portion of our system; and to guard
it from injury, it is shut up in a bony case consisting of many pieces curiously fastened together,
and strengthened by ridges of bone.
The skull in which it is contained, is not only
thus fortified, but its cavity is divided by strong
webs, on which the different parts of the brain are
supported. No accident of any ordinary kind can
reach it, and nothing but falls from considerable
heights, or heavy blows with some hard instrument, can break through its walls. Were it otherwise, we should be liable to injuries from numerous
causes, which would either destroy us, or make us
miserable objects for the whole of our lives.
The substance of the brain is soft and white, and
is arranged in the most curious manner. It is
divided into two portions: one occupying the front
and upper part of the head, and called the cerebrum,
or proper brain; and the other the lower and back
part, and called the little brain.
It is more copiously supplied with blood than
any other part of our body, for though it seldom
weighs more than three pounds, one sixth of all
the blood passes through it. From its lower surface are given off in regular pairs those white cords
called nerves, which we have seen running in all
directions through the body.

which the sun rises. A voyage round the world
may be performed in a year, if a ship does not
stay long in a place, and wind and weather prove
favourable.
LAND AND WATER.
The earth consists of two parts, land and water
It has an uneven surface, occasioned by the many
mountains which are upon it. But the mountains,
though many of them seem to us very lofty, are,
when compared to the size of the earth, as small
as grains of sand would be in comparison of a
cricket-ball. The water occupies about twice as
much space on the surface of the earth as the
land.
Representations of the surface of the earth
are called maps.  On a map which represents
the whole world you see two large circles. But
you must not on that account imagine that,the
earth consists of two such circles. The whole
surface of a globe or ball cannot be shown in
any other way.  Suppose you wanted to represent
the whole surface of an orange, you would be
obliged to draw it as two circles.  Each of the
circles which represent the earth is called a
hemisphere. The word hemisphere means half a
globe.
The land of the earth is divided into five great
parts, sometimes called quarters of the world. Each
part has a distinct name. The smallest part, situate
towards the top of the hemisphere on the rightSPINAL MIAtRO~Ov.
The spinal marrow is a continuation of the substance of the brain which proceeds down the backbone. This forms a hollow column, made up of
twenty-four separate bones, which are strongly
bound together by cartilage, ligaments, and muscles, within which the spinal marrow is safely
lodged. As it proceeds downwards, a pair of
nerves arises at every bone, one of them going to
the right, and one to the left.  These supply the
various parts of the body as they branch and ramify
in every way.
When any portion of the brain, or spinal mar
row, is pressed upon or injured, the function oi
office of the nerves which proceed from it is de
stroyed, and the parts they supply lose motion and
feeling. It is to these organs, therefore, that we
owe all our sensations or feelings.
The brain is also the seat of the mind, or of our
intellectual faculties; and' if it be oppressed or
diseased, we lose our consciousness, or sense of
being. Were it not for this organ, we should
not be sensible of any of the beauties of nature;
and the whole world would be a blank. We
should know  nothing of the light of day, the
warmth of the sun, the beauty of the night; nor
would any of the sweet sounds which now delight
us ever meet the ear.
Many parts of the animal creation appear to be
destitute of brain, and in none is the brain so perfectly made as in mankind. Our sphere of enjoymenrt is therefore much greater than that enjoyed

and with all our strength.'

LESSON XIV.
THE SENSES-THE ORGANS OF THE SENSESTOUCH.
IT is by means of ouLr senses that we become
acquainted with the qualities of the objects whicl
surround us.
The senses are five in number: namely, Sight
--Smell-Taste-Touch-and Hearing; each of
which conveys feelings of a different kind to the
brain.
These different impressions assist us in forming
an accurate idea of the nature of any body which
we examine. For instance:-we see an apple, its
colour is green, and it looks spherical; we touch
it, and find that it is a hard smooth body; we
smell it, it has a slight but agreeable odour; we
taste it, and discover that it has a grateful subacid flavour: thus four of our senses are called into
play, in order to acquire an accurate knowledge of
the properties of a single body.
Let us consider a moment how imperfect our
knowledge- would be, if any one of these conditions were wanting, and how much gratification
would be lost to us. It is, indeed, from the use
of our senses, that we obtain most of our pleasurable enlotions; the summer evening's ramble, and
the snug and comfortable winter parlour, would
be deprived of their charms, were our senses denied
to us, or imperfect.
238THE SENSES.
All the sights and sounds that fill the world with
beauty and hlarmony are conveyed to us by their
means, nor can we sufficiently admire the goodness,
which has so wonderfully provided them as things
of necessity, and which has, at the same time,
made them the sources of so much pleasure and
instruction.
The organs of our senses are supplied with
nerves from certain parts of the brain, which nerves
convey the feelings made upon them from without, and are found in no other part of the body.
Thus, the olfactory nerve serves the nose, and
gives it. the sense of smell. This sense is enjoyed
by this organ alone; and if the nerve is destroyed
the sense is lost, none of the other nerves being
able to convey a similar impression; and the same
with the eye-the ear--and the tongue.
Four of our senses are confined to small spaces,
3ut that of touch or feeling is extended over the
whole body, though it is enjoyed in much greater
perfection by some parts than by others. The
iand, and especially the fingers, have a most delicate and nice sense of touch. In these the skin
s thin, and they are plentifully furnished with
nerves.
Habit will, however, render them almost insensible; blaclksmiths and others, who are always
handling very hard substances, and lifting heavy
hammers, can for a short time even bear fire without feeling it. This want of feeling is owning to
the epidermis, or scarf skin, becoming thick and
239THE SENSES.
horny, and thus preventing impressions being
received by the nerves.
The sense of touch is of the greatest use to us,
and enables us to know whether bodies are hard
or soft, solid or fluid, rough or smooth, hot or cold.
As the knowledge it conveys is the most accurate,
it is generally called in to assist the other senses;
and when we are deprived of some of these, by a
wonderful dispensation of Providence, it supplies
their place. Thus, touch alone enables the blind
man to learn many useful arts, which we cannot
attempt without using our eyes.
Though many parts of our bodies are very sensible, the knowledge they convey is vague and
uncertain.  It is the peculiar province of the hand,
furnished as it is with long and slender fingers, to
make us sensible of the exact nature of whatever
comes near us.

LESSON XV.
THE TONGUE-THE NOSE-THE EAR.
THE tongue is the principal agent in tasting,
It is quite full of vessels and nerves; so much so.
that it possesses a greater portion of vital energy
than any other part of the bo(ly, and its muscles
retain their motion for some time after death. It
can be moved about freely in all directions, and
made broad,:narrow, or slightly hollow, at pleasure.
If you pass the finger over the surface of your
tongue, you find that it is rough.  This is owing
to a multitude of little points, called papille;
these are very sensitive, and erect themselves
when we are tasting.   It is in these papillae that
the nerves end, and it is in them that the sense of
taste immediately resides.
The flavour of what we eat is very various;
Some things are agreeable, others disagreeable;
but taste, like the other senses, soon reconciles
itself to almost any thing, however unpleasant it
may be at first.  The gustatory, or tasting nerve,
is fitted to convey different flavours to the brain;
X
241THE NOSE.
but to do this it is necessary that they should he in
a liquid state, and in order to render them so, the
mouth, whenever we are eating, is furnished with
saliva.
Smelling is closely connected with tasting; and
the organs of taste and smell, namely, the mouth
and the nose, open freely into each other.
Most bodies emit a smell:-that is, they give
out odorous particles. These, floating in the air,
are drawn into the nose, and are there made sensible to us, by means of the olfactory, or smelling,
nerve.
The structure of the nose is very curious, and
most beautifully adapted for its purposes. The
nose is a large cavity formed of bones and gristle,
opening in front by the nostrils. These are directed downwards, in order to receive smells, which
generally ascend; and behind are two wide apertures which lead into the back of the mouth.
The whole inner surface of the nose is lined by
a soft and delicate membrane, called the pituitary
nmembrane, in the substance of which the nerve
of smelling is spread out. This membrane is
abundantly supplied with blood, and it is in consequence of the softness of its texture that we are
very liable to bleedings from the nose.
The senses of smell and taste convey many
powerful and delightful sensations, and are of the
highest utility in guiding us in the selection of our
food. The effluvium, or smell, proceeding from
substances is in general a correct way of judging
241(oas to their wholesomeness or unwholesomeness,
and we are naturally led to smell any thing new to
us before we venture to taste it.
The ear is a most complex and beautiful organ.
It is the most perfect acoustic, or hearing instrument, with which we are acquainted, and the
ingenuity and skill of man would be in vain exercised to imitate it.
By the ear we are made sensible of sound. If a
glass, or any other sonorous body, be struck, it vi6rates, and emits what we call sound. This sound
spreads into the surrounding air, and is carried
forwards, by a series of undulations, or waves, to a
distance determined by its force or intensity, and
the direction of the wind.
These undulations strike the ear, and give us
the impression of sound. In order that this impression should be oonveyed to the sensorium, or
brain, the ear has been provided; and it is singularly and beautifully adapted for the purpose.
The outward ear is so constructed as to collect
the sound, which passes forwards and strikes what
is called the drum. This is a circular membrane
stretched across the passage leading to the internal
ear.  This drum  vibrates, and gives the same
vibration to a set of curious little bones connected
with it, and these carry the sound onwards to a
winding passage filled with fluid.
The whole surface of this part is lined by the
filaments, or twigs, of the auditory or hearing
nerve, and this is the immediate seat of the impres243,I'HlE EAR1.244                  THE EAR.
sions conveyed to us by the sense of hearing.
These impressions are very varied in their charactelr, and excite equally varied emotions in the
mind, from the rush of the summer breeze
through the dancing leaves, to the peal of the
thunder storm, and the softest breathing of "distant music."

LESSON XVI.
THE EYE-VISION.
WHEN we look at the eye, we see that the front
part of it is bright and transparent, and that behind
this there is a dark-looking curtain, with an opening in its centre. The bright part is the cornea,
and is fixed into what we call the white of the
eye, very much in the same way that a watch-glass
is fixed into its case. The curtain is named the
iris, and the opening through it the pupil.
The iris is a very delicate circular muscle, and
its colour is. owing to a dark paint which covers it
behind, and which easily washes off. The action
of the iris is seen if we bring a candle close to the
eye; the pupil contracts closer and closer, according to. the brightness of the light, and enlarges
again as it is removed. In order that its action
may be perfectly free, the part in whicll the iris
moves is filled with a watery fluid, called the
aqueous hu?mour.
Farther back, in the ball of the eye, are other
curious parts, as the crystalline lens, which is in
shape-just like a small glass in a telescope, and
is placed exactly behind the pupil; and a third
humour called the vitreous humour.
All these parts are made like an optical instrument, to conduct and gather the rays of light.
They are subservient to another part called the

hand, is called Europe. In the same hemisphere
are situate three other parts of the world, ASIA,
AFRICA, and part of AUSTRALIA. In the hemisphere on the left lie AMERICA and part of Australia. We live in America.
You find upon a map outlines of countries, with
their names, and the names of their principal cities.
T'he names of countries are distinguished by capital letters. Black crooked lines show the courses
of rivers, and dark patches in the midst of the land
are large lakes. Land surrounded by water is
called an island; and land nearly surrounded by
water is called a peninsula.
HILLS, MOUNTAINS, MINES, CAVERNS.
Irf most parts of the earth there are hills and
mountains. Some of these are composed wholly
of stone, which is useful to man for many purposes.
In different places, both the hills, which rise above
the ground, and the earth, wvhich is beneath it, conTHlE EYE.
retina, which is the expansion of the optic or
seeing nerve.  This nerve passes through the
coats of the eye, and immediately divides itself
into a half circular net work, covering and lining
the whole of the inner surface of its back part.
It is from the retina that we receive impressions
of light, and see the objects around us.
The ball--of the eye is of a roundish shape, and
furnished with six muscles, by means of which it
call be turned in every direction.
This delicate and curious organ, the eye, is very
carefully protected. It is placed in a bony cavity
called the orbit, and provided with two moveable'
outside curtains, known under the name of eyelids. These guard it from  dust, keep the front
bright and clear, and spread the tears over the
whole surface of the eyeball, so that it may be
always moist, and easily moveable.   In these
offices the eyelids are assisted by the eyelashes
and the eyebrows.
To enable us to close our eyes when we go to
sleep, or when we are pained by an excess of
light, the lids are provided with muscles, and can
perform very rapid motiorts.
Let us now consider how admirably our eyes
are fitted for vision. It is light which renders
things visible to us, for we cannot see in a dark
room, or in a very dark night. Now what we
call light is a succession of rays, proceeding from
any luminous body, which rays, after striking
upon objects, are reflected, or thrown back. Whern
246we see an object, therefore, it is because these reflected rays enter otr' eyes, and impinge or fall
upon the retina.  In this way a perfect picture is
formed at thle bottom of the eye, just as we see our
face reflected in a looking-glass.
In order, however, that the image or picture
may be formed upon the retina, it is needful that
the rays of light should pass through the eye.
For this purpose the cornea and parts behind are
transparent, and-permit the rays to pass freely,
whilst the crystalline lens refracts or bends
them, so that they proceed in a proper form and
direction.
During this operation, the iris contracts or
expands, to regulate the quantity of rays which
the retina can bear.  By this beautiful and siniple
contrivance, the eye accommodates itself to the
different degrees of light to which it is exposed.
It is a bad thing to look for a long time at a strong
light, as this weakens the iris, and blunts the sensibility of the retina, and consequently injures the
sight.
It is wonderful to think what perfect instru-.
ments the eyes are. Thus in looking at a landscape of hill, dale, and plain, even of many miles
in extent, the whole space, with its numberless
objects of all colours and sizes, is represented on
the bottom of the eye; and though the picture is
not half an inch in diameter, how accurate it is,
and how minute in all its details, not a line or a
shade being omitted9

advance from infancy to old age, are not less curious than instructive. The hand of our Almighty
and all-wise Creator is visibly at work upon us, and
we find that in every period of life our organs and
their actions are wonderfully fitted to our wants
and conditions.
What helpless little creatures we are in the
earlier periods of our life, and how totally we are
dependent upon the care of others.      An infant
cannot, for some months, even direct its eyes to
248CHANGES OF THE IIUMAN BO5DY.     249,any particular point, or carry its hand to its mouth.
Its bones are soft, and if it were allowed to support
itself, its limbs would bend beneath its own weight.
A great part of its time is passed in sleep, or in
satisfying its mere animal wants, and beyond these
its feelings seem  very limited.  Digestion and
nutrition are however very active, and the infant
grows rapidly.
A:few short years, and what different beings we
become! We can talk, run, leap, feed ourselves,
and from morning till night are never still. We
are now children; our bones are harder, our muscles stronger, and our senses more perfect. -We
eat frequently, because our bodies are fast increasing, and our digestion is active. We have teeth,
and our diet is no longer milk and pulpy matter, but
consists of various articles, as bread, butter, cheese,
fruit, and animal food. We now begin to exercise
the mind; we are taught the names of objects, how
to distinguish what is right from what is wrong,
and we learn how to be good and obedient. We
still, however, require the constant care of our
parents, and ought never to be long out of their
sight, lest our ignorance and thoughtlessness should
lead us into danger.
Again, a few years pass ovel us, and we arrive
at youth, or boyhood.  We are no longer confined
to the nursery or playground, nor do we need constant care, for we have learnt how to protect ourselves, and know what to avoid. Our bodies are
now strong and vigorous. Our bones are almostCHANGES OF I'HE HUMAN BODY
completely hardened, and our muscles capable ol
powerful exertion. WTe can carry heavy weiglhts,
and go through a great deal of labour or of active
sport. We are sent from home to acquire knowledge, for during this part of our lives the mind is
active and inquisitive, and it is our duty to store it
with usefill information, so as to fit us for performing our public and private duties. We now begin
to mix with our seniors, and occasionally to enter
into conversation with them, as we can think, compare, and recollect. Our growth is still going on,
but less actively than before, and most of our
organs and functions are perfect.
Again a few brief years, and we are men, mixing with the world, and probably remboved from
our parental roof. The body is full grown and
vigorous; the complexion darker; the voice deeper
and more powerful; the muscles larger and firmer;
the bones increased in thickness; and the mental
faculties quite mature. The whole body has the
appearance of ripeness, and its shape is rounded
and well defined. We are now masters of our
own actions, and responsible agents, and in most
cases dependent on our own exertions for support.
Our character becomes more grave, and from the
constant occasion we have for exercising the judgment, we think more, and lose our fondness for
many of those active exercises which delighted us
in earlier life.
But a short; time, and another change comes over
us. We become old; we lose the firm step andCHANGES OF THE HUMAN BODY.
determined purpose of manhood; the buoyancy
and intelligence of youth; the hilarity and sportiveness of childhood, and the quiet unconsciousness
of infancy.  The body shrivels, and its otrtlines
become angular; the teeth fall out; the eyes are
dim; and the hearing, touch, and taste, imperfect.
We reach the verge of life; and, after tottering for
a while upon the brink of the grave, we die, and
the place which knew us knows us no more.

251DIFFERENCES IN THE FORM
LESSON XVIII.
DIFFERENCES IN THE FORMS OF MANKIND AND THE
INFERIOR ANIMALS.
MAN has faculties and powers which raise him
in the scale of creation far above every other living thing with which we are acquainted. To man
we may apply the words of the Psalmist, in speaking of the works of the Lord, and say,--" Thou
madest him to have dominion over the works of
thy hand."  It has been shown how wonderful his
structure is, and we will now point out a few of the
differences which exist between mankind and other
animals.
The structure of the teeth, and the form and size
of the intestines in man, differ considerably from
those of the inferior animals. These are so constructed as to be fitted for the kiinds of food which
are taken by human beings.
The teeth have the enamel all on the outside
but in such animals as graze or feed on vegetable
matter, the top of the teeth is broad and uneven,
and has ridges of enamel mixed with the bone.
This enables them to grind their food; for the
softer bone wears away, and leaves the teeth very
irregular, in consequence of the greater hardness of
the enamel.
The stomach and intestines of these gramini
vorous, or grass-eating, animals, also differ from
252OF MIEN AND ANIMALS.
ours. Those who chew the cud, as the cow, for
instance, have more than one stomach, and they
can return their food into the mouth to be still far.
ther masticated.  Their intestines are also very
long, much longer than our own.
Such animals as are carnivorous, or flesh-eating,
have a structure- just the reverse: their teeth are
large, sharp, and pointed; their stomach is small
and simple; and their intestines are very short.
The teeth and intestines of man are in form and
size between the two: we have neither the rough
grinding teeth and double stomach of the cow, nor
the fangs and short intestines of the lion.
The cause of this difference is obvious. Vegetable food is much less nutritious than animal food,
and it requires a long time to extract the nourishing juices from it. Hence, the cow grinds it twice
over, and hence it has to pass through a canal of
great length. In the lion, the food is much more
nourishing and easier of digestion.  Hence its
teeth are made to tear, and pull the food into pieces,
its stomach is small and simple, and the canal
short.
In man, the teeth are set even in the jaws, and
are fitted both for biting and grinding, though he
cannot tear his food like the lion, or reduce it into
so complete a pulp as the cow. His stomach is of
moderate size, and his intestines of a medium
length. By these means we are enabled to feed on
and to digest both animal and vegetable substances;
and for this reason man is called omnivorous.
Y
253254     FORM OF MEN AND ANIMALS.
Man alone has the front teeth in the lower jaw
standing in an upright direction; in all other creatures they slope backwards, hence we are the only
animal which has a proper chin.
Quadrupeds whose heads are heavy and hang
down, are provided with a very curious and strong
ligament, popularly called pack-wax, at the back
of the neck, to hold the head up.       We have
nothing of the sort, as our head is placed on the
top of the spine, and needs no such support.
If we watch a horse or a cow on a warm day,
when the flies are troublesonle, we shall see that
they have the power of wrinkling and contracting
the skin, so as to dislodge any thing which settles
upon it.  This is owing to a thin muscular layer
stretched beneath the skin, and called the pannicutlUs carnosus.  We have nothing of the sort, as
our hands can reach all parts of our bodies, and
consequently we do not want it.

LESSON XIX.
OF THE INSTINCT OF 5MAN AND ANIMALS--
REASON.
ANIMALS are guided in supplying their wants,
in rearing their young, and in protecting themselves from danger, by instinct. If grass be given
to a dog, and flesh to a cow, neither will be touched
by those animals. This is the result of instinct.
The structure, indeed, of the digestive organs in
animals is fitted only for that one kind of food
which they always take when they are in a state
of nature.
In judging of the habits of animals, we should
remember that we are liable to be deceived if we
consider those only which are domesticated. The
taste of domesticated animals becomes to some
extent changed, and this is the reason why their
health is inferior to that of wild creatures, and
why they are liable to many diseases.
By instinct we understand a propensity and a
power for performing certain actions which are
necessary for our preservation.  Instinct has been
given to us by our Almighty Father in order that
such actions may be performed at once, and without
the aid of our slower process of reasoning,--for we,
as well as animals, have instinctive actions.
Thus when we are in danger, we eithei fly from't, or defend ourselves as we best can, with scarcely
255LAND AND WA'i'ER.
taiii copper, iron, and ot;her valuable substances,
mixed with earthy matter.  In many places, coal,
salt, and various other productions of great value,
are found deep in the bowels of the earth. The large
and deep openings made to obtain them are called
mines, and the earthy or stony matter, among which
the metals and minerals are found, are called ores.
Men employed in digging mines are called miners.
Mountains which send forth flames and clouds
of smoke are called volcanoes. These sometimes
discharge also streams of liquid matter called lava,
which lookl like rivers of fire, and spread terror,
death, and destruction around. The principal volcanoes in Europe are Vesuvius and -Etna.
Fire and water have formed in the earth many
extraordinary caverns, some of which run for miles
under ground, and terminate in abrupt precipices.
The water incessantly dropping from the roofs of
caverns, sometimes forms what are called stalactites, which hang down in a variety of curious and
beautiful shapes.
In some parts of the earth mighty torrents have
broken through and rent asunder huge mountains,
the sides of which now form, as it were, immense
gateways. Such was the origin of the straits by
which some countries are separated, and seas have
become connected: the straits of Gibraltar supply
an instance, where Europe and Africa approach
near to each other, and by which the Mediterranean sea is connected with the Atlantic ocean.
22,any knowledge of what we are doing.   If, for
examlple, we have the misfortune to fall into water,
and cannot swim, the instinct of self-preservation
often enables us to escape drowning, though we
can give no account, or but a very confused one,
of the means we took to effect this.
As it is essential to our well-being and existence
that we should be nourished and refreshed by food
and drink, what we call hunger and thirst are instinctive wants, and are quite independent of our
will.
This is a wise and merciful arrangement of
Providence; for did the supply of our necessities
depend solely upon our own wishes, how often
should we neglect them, and thus derange the
system, or, perhaps, even destroy health. In grief,
in the hurry of business, in study, and on other
occasions when the attention is engrossed, did not
hunger and thirst iremind us of what was going on
within us, we should abstain from food till our
strength was exhausted.
Thus man and animals are equally possessed of
instinct. In addition to this, however, man has
reason-the noblest of all his attributes, and which
has been denied to the brute creation.
The importance of reason or understanding may
be seen by noting our own actions:-when, for
instance, we meet with some new object, as a stone,
or a plant. We look at it, and examine it; we
know nothing about it; it is quite new to us.
Reason is now called in to assist us; we wish to
256
REASON..acquire a knowledge of the object, and we begin
to think about it, and we endeavour. to find out
what it is.
First, then, we consider whether we have ever
seen any thing resembling it; this is an exercise
of memory; then we compare it with surrounding
objects; we then taste it, or smell it, and feel it,
and thus acquire a knowledge of its sensible qualities. We now know a great deal about it, and
begin to reflect as to what its nature and uses may
be. We judge that it is fit or unfit for food, that
it has the same properties as some other known
body, and finally N*e satisfy ourselves upon all
points connected with it. This done, we seldom
forget it. We know something that. we were ignorant of before, and thus by a course of observation we go on acquiring knowledge.
Nothing of this is ever seen amongst other animals. The most beautiful objects are passed over
by them with perfect indifierence, and not the
slightest attention is paid by them to any thing but
what supplies their simplest wants.
Thus man stands alone in his pre-eminence of
intellect, and well might the greatest of uninspired
poets exclaim:-" What a piece of work is man!
how noble in reason! how infinite in faculties! in
form and moving how express and admirable! in
action how like an angel! in apprehension how
like a God! the beaLuty of the world! the paragon
of animals!"

LESSON XX.
THE BEAUTY AND PERFECTION OF BODY AND
MIND-HEALTH.
THE human form is beautiful and graceful.
The limbs are straight and full of symmetry,-the
countenance pleasing and expressive,-the motions
active and powerful. Much of this depends upon
the care taken of infants during their early years,
for awkward    habits  are  acquired, and bodily
sltrength is impaired, by negligence.
In infancy children should be taught to hold the
body erect, whether sitting, standing, or walkingi
and they should never be allowed to lounge withHIEALTH.
tile head hanging down, or the shoulders brought
forwards.' They should be encouraged to take
light exercises suited to their strength, and tending
to make the limbs agile and supple, and prepare
them for labour.  Nothing is worse than to sit
moping and idle. If we do so, we lose our liveliness and spirits, become dull and stupid, and never
possess that charm which cheerfulness gives to
ourselves and to others.
But beauty does not consist alone in bodily perfections. It is in vain that we are handsome or
well shaped, if our mind and disposition be not
properly cultivated.  Our passions and tempers
require particular care.  If we are quarrelsome,
revengeful, or obstinate, we-are constantly doing
some wickedness, and making ourselves and our
friends unhappy. Our countenance is deprived
of its delightful expression,-our hearts are full
of bad thoughts,-and nobody loves us.
In early life also, we should be very attentive
to the instructions which are given to us, for our
minds are then peculiarly suited to receive instruction. If we suffer this time to pass away in
idleness and indifference, we shall never cease to
regret it, because in after life we shall neither have
time nor inclination to atone for our foolishness.
However perfect the body and mind may be,
we are useless to ourselves and to others without
health. This is the greatest blessing that we can
enjoy, for without it neither riches, nor wisdom,
nor goodness can avail us. How needful is it,HEALTH,
therefore, that we should take every means to
procure it, and every care to preserve it.
5We are in good health when we relish our
fbod, and feel no uneasiness; when we have the
free use of our limbs, when our senses are perfect,
when our mind is unclouded, when our sleep is
sound and undisturbed, and when we can bear the
changes in the weather;-or, in other words, we
enjoy good health, when all the functions of our
body are performed in their proper order, and
without conveying any disagreeable sensations.
Much of their future health depends upon the
treatment children receive till they are ten years
of age. If during that time they are allowed to
eat improper food, are confined in a close and
unwholesome atmosphere, and are suffered to be
filthy in their persons, the seeds of many diseases
are sown in the system, from which they may,
probably, never be able to free themselves.
To keep our body in health many things are
needful. It must be nourished by proper food,
protected by fit clothing, refreshed by rest, exercised by labour, kept perfectly clean, preserved
from:itward injuries, respiration carried on in
pure air, and the passions properly regulated.

LESSON XXI.
OF EATING AND DRINKING-FOOD AND DRINKS.
WE eat and drink in order to appease our
Ihunger and thirst, and to supply the waste going
on in our bodies. Young people generally eat
more than old people, because they are growing,
and their digestion is rapid.  The principal articles of our diet are-bread,: garden vegetables,
fruit, milk, and animal food, such as fish, fowl,
beef, mutton, veal, and pork.
We live best on a mixed diet, neither confined
to animal nor vegetable food, nor to one particular
kind of either. It is for this reason that our meals
generally consist of different dishes. We should,
however, be very careful not to mix too great a
variety of different substanlces in our stomachs at
one time.
261EATING AND DRINKING.
Hunger is the best sauce, and the best cook.
We may pamper our appetites with luxuries, but
we shall never relish any thing unless we come to
it hungry; and if we are hungry, the simplest
fare becomes a luxury.
Labour and exercise in the open air are the
best promoters of appetite; when we have taken
these,.we eat our meals with a relish, and they do
us good. It is a grievous error, however, to suppose that eating a great deal is a proof of a healthy
appetite; or that by eating much, we get more
nourishment.
It is useless to eat more than the stomach can
digest, and no stomach can digest food when it is
overloaded. The undigested food, therefore, has
to be pushed into the bowels unprepared, and
there it excites all sorts of mischief; hence we
see that great eaters are in general thin, and pale,
and look unhealthy.
It is advisable that most part of our food,
whether animal or vegetablei should undergo some
preparation before it is taken into our stomach,
that it may be softened, improved in flavour, and
rendered more digestible. This process is called
cooking. Vegetables are mostly boiled or stewed;-animal food either roasted, stewed, or boiled.
We should not, when we are in health, take
food too often. The stomach is three or foul
hours in digesting a meal; and if we take another
before the previous one is removed from it, it in
terrupts its actions, and deranges its functions.
262EATING AND DRINKING.
Every meal-should consist of a due mixture of
solids and fluids. It is a bad thing to eat largely
without drinking, and properly mixing the food
with the saliva. We should, therefore, never eat
hastily, but masticate what we take very well, and
drinlk when we feel a desire so to do.
The best and most universally palatable drink is
pure water. At meal times this is the most proper
drink,--but there is no objection to weak table
beer: children should never be allowed any thing
stronger; and it would be much better for all, to
abstain from wine and strong drinks. These stimulate the stomach too much; and in the end injure its tone, and bring on indigestion.
It is a dangerous thing to begin to drink wine
and spirituous liquors early in life. God, who has
given them to us, has no doubt designed them for
our benefit; but no part of his gifts is more abused.
As they are not necessary for us in health, we had
better avoid them, lest we should be betrayed into
that most odious of vices-drunkenness.
In this state we are deprived of reason, and may
commit crimes of the most horrid character almost
unknowingly; and even if we escape these, we
are objects of detestation, and offend all decency
and good manners. Besides this, the constant excessive use of these fluids weakens the stomach,
impairs the senses, and brings on dropsy, and other
diseases
We should make it a rule never to eat or drink
any thing very hot, as this spoils the' teeth and

injures the digestive organs.  WThen we are much
heated by exercise, and perspiring profusely, we
ought never to drink cold water. Many accidents
have happened from this imprudence--the system not being able to bear the shock.

LESSON XXII.
OF CLOTHING.
OIR dress should be made in such a manner,
and of such materials, that we may feel neither
uncomfortably hot, nor uncomfortably cold. It
should, therefore, be suited to the season, and the
particular habit of body or the state of health,We should not allow what is called fashion to
Interfere with this arrangement of clothing; for,
if our system- is delicate, and our constitution
naturally cold, it concerns our health and daily
comfort that we should be clad accordingly. At
the same time, our dress ought always to be neat,
as nothing can look worse than a young person
who is slovenly and careless about his apparel.
It is by far the best to be accustomed from
childhood to a light and cool dress, and to be
inured to cold. Nothing is, indeed, more hurtful
than to be nmuffled up and buried in a heap of
clothes, so that we cannot stir or talke any proper
exercise, without becoming overheated, whilst the
perspiration is pent up), and does not evaporate.
Thus our clothes are made damp and uncomfortable, and we are liable to take cold the moment we
get into a draught of air.
We generally err, however, in wearing too light
a dress in summer. We should bear in mind,
that the heat of the weather relaxes the skin, opens
the pores, and increases the action of the heart.
We, therefore, almost constantly feel hot, and are
perspiring, and we throw the windows open, or
seek the coldest places we can find. It is in this
way that so many colds are caught; as the perspiration is suddenly checked, and produces fever, and
slight inflammation of the air passages.
Never wear any part of your dress so tight as
to press upon the body. All that is required is
that ypur clothes fit comfortably, and if they pinch

The best dress for a boy is a round short jacket,
made of strong woollen cloth, a waistcoat of the
same, and quite easy, a pair of wide trousers, buttoning to the waistcoat-in winter of good kerseymere, and in summer of some thinner woollen
cloth; light woollen stockings, and shoes made
sufficiently wide.
Boots which lace up the leg are the worst things
that can possibly be worn, as they not only interrupt the circulation, but keep the feet hot and
damp. Narrow pointed shoes are also very improper, as they cramp and contract the toes, and
prevent that freedom of action in them which was
intended to assist us in walk-ing.
The feet should always be sufficiently clad, and
preserved from wet. Colds are often given by
want of proper care in this respect; and it is a
maxim, that to preserve health, we must keep the
"feet warm by exercise, and the head cool by
temperance.'"
Thick fur caps are rarely advisable as coverings
for the head; they overheat it, and often give rise
to scald head and tender eyes. Amongst children,
too, the neck should be left nearly bare, and every
thing in the shape of handkerchief studiously
avoided.

LESSON    XXIII.
OF EXERCISE AND REST.
HOWEVER good our health may be, exercise is
absolutely essential to keeping it so.  This should,
if possible, be taken in the open air; and then we
fiind that it exhilarates and refreshes us, makes us

cheerful and lively, promotes digestion, and pro
cures us sound slumbers.
Labour, which is only exercise of a severer kind,
is highly salutary to us. It makes the body strong
and robust, gives it firmness and tone, and prolongs life, by warding off those evils which flow
fr.om idleness.
Walking, running, leaping, riding, and perform
ing manual labour, are all proper for us; and we
ought to diversify our studies and pursuits, if
sedentary, by devoting some part of every day to
them. We should, however, be careful not to
continue them too long -or too violently; as by
doing so, we exhaust our strength, and may injure
aur health.
Exercise is particularly advantageous to children. At that time of life our feelings prompt us
to be always in motion; and this disposition should
not be checked. We observe the same thing in
the young of all animals; witness the--layfulness
of kittens, and the sportive actions of the colt.
1this is a wise ordination of Providence, and calculated to encourage the growth of all our organs.
WVe are not then fit for any thing like labour, ouI
bodies not having attained sufficient strength for
continued exertion.
We should generally avoid taking exercise immediately after a full meal. The stomach is then
actively engaged in digestion, and violent motion
disturbs its operations, and is very apt to produce
nausea, or sickness.EXERCISE AND REST.,It is necessary that some part of our time
should be passed in sleep. Complete repose, and
the absence of all usilal stimulants, recruit and
refresh the body and mind; and however languid
and fatigued we may be, a night's sound sleep
renovates our strength and spirits.
It is a bad thing to indulge in sleep during the
day, as we almost always feel heavy and dull after
it. Young children, however, should repose an
hour or two about noon, because their activity
tires them out, and makes them fretful and uneasy
before bed-time.
Sleeping apartments should be large and lofty,
and plenty of fresh air should be admitted. Bedhangings are bad things in the rooms of young
people, as they confine the air, prevent it circulating freely about the bed, and render the apartment unwholesome.
A hair mattress is by far the best thing to sleep
upon, and children should never be-laid upon any
thing else. Feather beds, though very comfortable, and indispensable to persons who are accustomed to them, are too warm and relaxing.
WTe should be very careful not to be loaded
with bed-clothos, and above all things; never sleep
with the head buried under them: on the contrary, the head, neclc, and upper part of the chest,
should rest on the pillow, and always be exposed.
The habit of lying in bed late i-n the morning is
very prejudicial to health. Not only do we lose

do not require more than eight hours' rest, out
of the twenty-four.    Young children, however,
should go to bed at seven o'clock in the evening,
and be allowed to remain till the same hour in the
morning.

LESSON XXIV
OF CLEANLINESS IN PERSON AND DRESS.
IF we wish to enjoy good health, we must keep
our persons, dress, and habitations clean. Numerous
disorders arise fiom want of due attentiotl to this.
270CLEANLIkNESS.
The houses of many poor people in towns are
filthy, and are situated in back streets, which are
seldom swept, and are badly paved. This makes
them liable to contagious diseases. Not only does
the general health suffer, but the skin, when it is
allowed to be dirty, contracts a number of disgusting and malignant eruptions.
If a child is regularly washed, its skin will be
friee from rasles, and as soft and smooth as velvet;
but what wretched objects do we often see-the
face and body covered with blotches, and the eyes
red a-nd inflanmed.
To keep ourselves free from these dangerous
and unsightly affections, the use of soap and water
is all that is necessary. Not only should the face,
lFands, and feet, but the whole body also, be constantly washed, and bathing should be resorted to
as often as possible.
All boys should be taught to swim, and no child
should ever venture into the water except in the
presence of a grown-up person.
Wlhen you bathe, plunge at once over head, and
keep constantly moving about. Never bathe just
after violent exercise, and when you are overheated and perspiring: this is very dangerous, and
may -bring on cramp of the stomach or limbs.
If the health is delicate, it is safer to bathe in
the sea than in rivers; but, as a general rule, we
ought to be in good health when we go into the
water. After bathing, we should never sit or
stand still: if we do so, we are apt to get chilly
271CLEANLINESS.
and cold: gentle exercise, as quiet walking, should,
therefore, always follow.
Great care should be taken that the place we
bathe in is free from sunken rocks and deep holes,
as we may strike ourselves against the one, and
stick fast in the other.  We ought, therefore,
never to venture into an unknown place; many
boys have lost their lives for want of this caution.
It is not enough that our skin is clean; unless
our dress and habitations are free from filth, we
cannot keep it so.   Our under clothing should
be frequently changed, and our dress at. all times
should be perfectly clean and neat.
The rooms in which we live should'be washed,
scoured, painted, and whitewashed, from time to
time, and there should be a free current of air
through them.
Our bed-linen should also be clean, and often
renewed, and the beds and mattresses beaten, and
now and then taken into the open air. Not only
should the inside of our houses be attended to, but
every thing about the outside as well.

LESSON    XXV.
OF PURE AIR.
HEALTH    is frequently injured  by breathing
impure air. People who are employed in preparing metals, especially lead and quicksilver, are
generally pale and emaciated, and die young,
because the vapours which proceed from the substances on which they work are noxious, and, by
being drawn into their lungs, poison them by degrees.  Painters are often afflicted with palsy of
the arms, and dreadful attacks of cholic, from inhaling the effluvium of white lead when they are
painting.
How uncomfortable are our feelings when shut
up in a close room   with several other persons.
We become hot, uneasy, drowsy, stupid, and unwilling to move: but let us escape from it, and get
into the open air, and what a delightful change
takes place. We shake off our lethargy, are lively
and animated, and wonderfully refreshed. How do
PURE AIR
273you account for this? Because the air in the close
room' was exceedingly impure, and, to some degree, poisonous.
You have learnt, that when we respire, the air
undergoes a great change, is robbed of that portion
which is essential to life, and its place supplied by
another kind of air, which kills animals.'When several candles,or lamps are burning in
the room, the air is still more'rapidly rendered
unwholesome; because these bodies, in burning,
also deprive it of its oxygen. We can now easily
explain why, in crowded evening parties, we so
soon. get fatigued and listless; and why people who
are fond of them, and very frequently go out, are
often ill, and look pale and poorly.
It is very hurtful for several children to sleep
together in the same room, unless it is spacious and
freely ventilated; and it is still worse for them to
sleep in the same bed. When this cannot be helped, the windows should be often opened, and a
ventilator fixed into one of them, in order that,
during the night, the heated and foul air may
escape.
Many contagious disorders are conveyed by
means of the air. This should make us very cautious in going near places where sickness prevailsbecause if we breathe an atmosphere loaded with
effluvia from diseased bodies, we run a great risk
of catching the disorder.
Rooms in which sick persons are confined soon
become full of pu{rid exhalations, or bad smells.
274
PURE A1H.and are very noisome and unhealthy, if shut up,
and Irept warm. This is very wrong, both on
account of the patient, and the attendants. A constant supply of fresh air is even more necessary
during sickness than in health.
Low, damp, and confined apartments are not fit
for dwelling places, as it is quite impossible we
should ever keep well in them. When deprived
of the cheering influences of light and cool fresh
air, we droop-are languid-depressed in spiritsand have no enjoyment. Our appetite is poorwe do not relish our food-our sleep is disturbedour whole frame, indeed, shows signs that it is
labouring under some weakening agent;-and this
is a damp and confined atmosphere.
Houses, to be healthy, should be built with airy
rooms, and in dry situations, and not too closely
surrounded by trees.
People who live in swampy districts, where vast
quantities of vegetable matter are constantly decaying, are subject to agute, and other troublesome
and dangerous disorders. This is owing to their
breathing damp and impure air.
Neither man, nor animals, nor vegetables can
live, if the air which surrounds them be not constantly renewed. A plant, confined in a glass case,
soon dies;- and instances have been known, where
a number of men, shut up in a small close dungeQn, have perished, after dreadful sufferings.
PURE AIR.
275THE SEA, RIVERS, ETC.
THE water which encompasses the land is called
the sea. This purifies the earth from unwholesome vapours by drawing them into itself, and it
is for the most part of vast depth.  Its depth,
however, is very unequal; for, like the surface of
the land, the bottom of the sea consists of mountains and valleys. Wonderful masses of rock are
often raised from the bottom of the sea, in which
little animals make their habitations.
As the boundless extent of the sea, and its
majestic movement, fill the mind with delight, astonishment, and awe, so in the dark, its luminous
appearance is inexpressibly grand.  Very often
the sea, as far as the eye can reach, seems to be on
fire. This wonderful appearance is produced by
very small animals, scarcely so big as a pin's head,
with an extremely delicate, transparent, jelly-like
body, mixed with others, called Medusas and Seanettles, which emit light from their long feelers,
while their bodies remain quite dark.
The saltness of the sea water renders it less liable
to freeze than other water.  But the sea at bothPR2ESERVATION'OF THE BODY,

LESSON XXVI.
OF THE PRESERVATION OF INDIVIDUAL PARTS OF
OUR BODIES.
As our comfort depends so greatly on having
our limbs and organs in a perfect state, we should
be careful not to do any thing which might injure
them. If we are heedless in moving about, or in
using cutting instruments, or going, without due
caution, near machinery, when in motion, we may
fracture our limbs, inflict severe cuts upon them,
or even be deprived of them.     Any of these are
276PRE'SERVATION OF THE BODY.
serious nmisfortunes, and may be a source of torment
and suffering all our after life.
The senses of hearing, smelling, and sight are
strengthened by exercise out of doors. It is very
bad for us to mope our time away in the house,
when the weather is fine, and we are not engaged
in some necessary duty; because, it makes the
nose, eyes, ears, and skin tender, and likely to become sore when exposed to a fresh and cool breeze.
The sight is injured by a dazzling, unequal, and
varying light. In reading we should never have
the sun shining on the page, nor should we ever
read by firelight; for not only is the light unequal
and uncertain, but the -sitting near the fire overheats the eyes, and makes them painfill.
The- shades used to cover lamps which darken
the room, and direct the light downwards, are far
from being proper things to read or work by.
Candles are the best, and should always be preferred to gas-light in sitting rooms.
The hearing is rendered dull by violent and
sudden noises, and by an accumulation of wax in
the ear. This should be carefully cleared away,
as it gives rise to many uneasy feelings.
The taste is injured by the constant use of
pungent food, and by indulging in spices. If these
are persevered in, the tongue and palate are made
insensible to any thing less stimulating, and a simple diet becomes tasteless., Whatever injures the
tone of the stomach, such. as the immoderate use
of wine and spirits, injures the taste also.
4
2'*7PRESERVATION OF THE BODY.
The touch is kept perfect by being exercised on
a variety of objects;by the body being in a sound
and healthy condition; and by strict attention to
personal cleanliness.
When the hands and feet are stiff and benumbed
with cold, we should never try to warm them by
the fire, as this causes excruciating pain, and may
do them harm. The best thing to restore the circulation is to rub them together, or to rub them
with snow, or to plunge them into cold water.
The teeth require particular attention. These
are so necessary to us for a variety of purposes,
that if we lose them, or they become diseased, we
are sadly harassed, and perhaps tormented, by that
terrible pain-toothach.
It is in most instances our own fault that the
teeth become unsightly, and fall away, so early in
life. We either disorder our stomachs by taking
improper food, or we take our meat hot, and our
drinks scalding-certain modes of destroying the
teeth. Another foolish thing children are fond of
doing, is cracking nuts, or plum stones, or biting
very hard substances. It is very wrong to do so,
for mischief is always produced by such habits.
Perfect cleanliness about the mouth should be
diligently practised. Every morning, and after
meals, the teeth should be cleansed by a soft brush
and pure water. A little charcoal now and then
is all the tooth powder requisite. Picking the
teeth with pins, knives, and forks is not only a
disgusting habit, but it is also exceedingly hurtful
278TEMPER AND PASSIONS.
When a tooth is so far decayed as to be useless,
and is a source of frequent pain, extraction is the
only cure. To endeavour to allay toothach by
violent applications- is very pernicious, and the
ruin of the rest of the teeth is often caused in this
way.

27928'TEMPER AND PASSIONS.
LESSON XXVII.
THE TEMPER AND PASSIONS-ADVANTAGES OF
CHEERFULNESS AND CONTENT.
IT is not enough for the preservation of health,
that our bodies are properly nourished,--that we
are fitly clothed,-that we take exercise, and enjoy
rest,--that we are cleanly in our persons, and live in
open and airy situations. The good effects of these
are in danger of being quite done away with, if
our temper and passions be not properly regulated.
It is useless to make a good meal of fit and nourishing diet, unless the mind is quiet and compdsed
after it. A sally of passion, or a fit of sulkiness,
spoils the digestion, and we had better have gone
without food.
But it is not after we have taken food alone, that
passions and bad temper may injure us; we cannot
even eat if we yield to them. We lose our appetite, the stomach gets disordered, and the most delicate meal is looked at with loathing and disgust.
So that unless the temper be serene and cheerful,
we eat without an appetite; what we take we
cannot digest; and food rather does us harm than
good.
A happy-minded and amiable child is one of the
most beautiful and loveable things that God has
given to us, to soften our hearts, and to call into
280TH E'T'E PER AND PASSIONS.
play oulr best affections,-and we may all be happy
if wAe will.
When we are grown old enough to be taught
these things, we shall, if we have any regard for
our health and comfort, never indulge in bursts of
violent passion, in- fits of anger, or in sullenness.
To do so, is to commit the greatest folly of which
we are capable. We can enjoy nothing when our
lhearts are filled with bad thoughts; because as our
internal feelings or disposition are bright orgloomy,
so does every thing around us appear.
If then we are cheerful and contented, all nature
smiles with us:-the air seems more balmy, the
sky more clear, the ground has a brighter green,
the trees have a richer foliage, the flowers a more
fragrant smell, the birds sing more sweetly, and
the sun, moon and stars all appear most beautiful.
We take our food with relish, and whatever it may
be, it pleases us. We feel better for it--stronger
and livelier, and fit for exertion.
Now what happens to us if we are ill-tempered
and discontented? Why, there is not any thing
which can please us. We quarrel with our food,
with ouir dress, with our amusements, with our
companions, and with ourselves. Nothing comes
right for us; the weather is either too hot or too
cold, too dry or too damp.   Neither sun, nor
moon, nor stars have any beauty; the fields are
barren, the flowers lustreless, and the birds silent.
We move about like some evil spirit, neither
loving nor beloved by any.thing.
2 A 2
28124 THRE'TEMPER AND PASSIONS.
Besides robbing ourselves of comfort and health,
and becoming hateful to ourselves and to all around
us, by passion and bad temper, we also unfit ourselves for performing our private and public duties.
The passionate man-and the passionate child
leads to the passionate man-is not fit to mingle in
society. He is always making himself enemies,
and giving pain to his friends and family. Nor is
this all; every one who indulges in bad temper, and
gives way to morose and sour feelings, sets a mischievous example to all around him, and spreads a
baneful influence over the whole range of his connexions. The affections become weakened-confidence is destroyed-health is injured-nervous
and painful diseases are created, and comfort and
happiness are banished from his dwelling.
To a man of this miserable disposition, the
troubles which all must expect to go through in
this life, become so many sources of torment; and
all the common evils of life are changed into real
misfortunes. Whilst the cheerful and thankful
man passes his days in such happiness as we are
fitted to enjoy, the other is gloomy and dissatisfied,
and makes his home cheerless. His countenance
is clouded, and his gait sluggish; his body loses its
healthy tone, and his mind is incapable of receiving
those impressions from the external world, which
our all-bountiful Creator has sent to minister to our
health and pleasure.
Always bear in mind, therefore, that if you
would preserve health, you must be good-temo

and to others, you must be good-tempered; and
that if you desire to show yourself worthy of the
blessings which Almighty God showers down
upon you, you must be content, good-tempered,
and thankful.

I,ESSON VI.
THE ATMOSPHERE--THE WINDS-DEVWFOGS--CLOUDS.
THE earth is surrounded on all sides by ~:The air, with the vapours that it contains, is called'
the atmosphere. The higher we ascend into this
atmosphere, for instance, upon high mountains, the
more does the air become rarefied, and the less
does it press upon the body.
The pressure of the atmosphere upon the human
body is equal to fifteen pounds upon every square
inch; and, as a man's body contains, upon an
average, fifteen square feet of surface, he must
sustain a weioht of 32,400 pounds, or sixteen tons.
for his usual load. By this enormous pressure
we should undoubtedTly  be crushed in a moment,
if every part of ou0r body were not filled either
with air, or with some elastic fluid, the spring
of which is just suficient to counteract the weighlt
of the atmosphere. On the tops of high mountains, the pressure of the atmosphere is considerably less than what it usually is on the plain. The
height to which the atmosphere extends is generally supposed to be about sixty miles, above
which elevation, th-ere are neither clouds nor
wind, and where the lightness of the air would
render it impossible for any animal to breathe.
The vapourr, which are continually rising from

the earth, and from every thing upon the earth,
collect in the atmosphere, and, uniting together,
produce rain, snow, fog, and all other changes of
weather.
r' ~''?'~~         ~WINDs.
The winds- which are continually blowing over
the earth are nothing but air put in motion chiefly
by means of heat. When any part of the air is
heated by the rays of the sun, or any other cause,
it is expanded and becomes lighter; and as the
lightness causes it to ascernd, it leaves a partial
void, into which the surrounding air rushes, to
fill up the void and restore the balance. For air,
like water and every other fluid, never rests until
it has found its level. This simple process, the
effects of which are very extensive, meeting with
various checks and interruptions from numberless
obstacles, causes those agitations of the air, which
are called wind. When the wind is violent, it is
called a storm, or tempest; and when it is very
furious, a hurricane. Storms and hurricanes sometimes break and uproot the strongest trees, overthrow houses, and lay waste large tracts of country.
What is commonly called a high wind, which
does not amount to a storm, generally moves at
the rate of about thirty-five miles an hour; and
in a hurricane the velocity of the wind is calculated at one hundred miles in an hour.DEW-O GS.
DEW.
Dew arises from the watery vapours which
ascend in the daytime from the earth, and, being
condensed by the cold at night, fall down again.
WBhen, therefore, the night is very warm, there
falls little or no dew. When it is so cold that
the dew is frozen, it is then called hoar-frost;
and the trees and grass appear as white as if they
were powdered.  The reason is this: when trees
and other bodies are extremely cold, the vapours
falling upon them are changed into particles of
ice. In very severe cold, even the vapours issuing
from our mouths are frozen, and fasten themselves
in that state to the hair, as the dew does to thgrass.
FOGs.
Fogs, or mists, consist of watery particles,
which are raised into the air; where, not being
completely dissolved, they form a vapour, which'
extends itself inf the lower par.t of the atmosphere, and is so thick that objects cannot be seen
through it.
Fogs are more frequent in low, wet, and marshy
situations, near ri-vers and ponds,.than in those
parts of a counttry'which are high and-dry. Fogs.
are much mnore common in cold seasons and in
-cold climates than in such as are warm; because,
in the former, the watery particles, being condensed almost as soon as they proeeed fro,m the surface of the earth, are prevented from rising into the
higher parts of the atmosphere.
The light mists which are observed in serene
summer evenings are composed of the same kind
of watery exhalations, rendered visible by the
cooling of the air. In winter, when it freezes
sharply, rivers that are not yet frozen appear
to smoke, because the upper'layers of water, on
account of their greater heaviness, sink to the
bottom, and cause the warmer water below to
rise to the top; and the particles rising from the
warmer water assume the appearance of smoke.
CLOUDS.
When vapours rise to a height in the atmosphere, and are collected in a dense state, they form
clouds, which float in the atmosphere at a greater
or less height, according to their weight. As
the atmosphere is heaviest below, dense and tlick
clouds, which are on the point of melting into
rain, float near the surface of the earth, while
the thin fleecy clouds soar far above them. Both
kinds may be frequently seen at different heights
in the atmosphere at the same time.
Clouds, being formed of water, are produced
in greatest abundance where the air has most
opportunity of acting upon water.  Winds, therefore, which blow from the east and soutlh-east,
over the Atlantic ocean, bring more clouds to
this country than westerly winds, which pass over
the land.i
CLOUDS.
29The wonderful variety of colours        displayed
by  the clouds, arises from     the  different ways
in which the sun's light is reflected among them.
Many of the clouds rise to the height of fifteen
miles from   the surface of the earth; but their
general height is not above a mile.

LESSON VII.
E VAPORATION-RAIN-SNO r-HAIL-RAINBO Wo
T'HERE is a process, according to the wise deerees of the Creator, constantly going on, by which
a. portion of all liquids is converted into steam, or
vapour. This process is called evaporation. It is
much greater in warm than in cold climates.
Now God has provided that the whole of the
water that is raised by evaporation shall not subsist
in the atmosphere at one time in the state of vapour. A portion of it is continually returning to the
earth, and not a day passes without rain falling in
some part of the world. The secondary cause off38               9NOVV-- W-HIfL.
rain is the condensation of the clouds through the
effect of cold. When they are greatly condensed,
they become too heavy to float in the air, and descend in drops.
The cold of the higher regions of the atmosphere
is sometimes so great as to freeze the particles which
form clouds. If the particles become frozen before
they have had time to unite into drops, they descend in the shape of small stars with six points;
and several of these, joined together, form flaky
masses, which are called snow.,X;1
The quantity of matter contained in snow is
small in proportion to its bulk. Snow, therefore,
meets with great resistance in passing through the
atmosphere, and consequently falls very slowvly.
Its great surface, also, renders it very susceptible
of evaporation, which considerably diminishes its
weight, even in the coldest weather.
If the cold is so moderate as to allow the particles
of water to unite into drops before freezing talkes
place, they form pieces of ice called hail. Hail, when
first formed, is not larger than the drops of water
xwhich fall in rain; and, being formed from a fluid,
it must be perfectly round; but when it arrives at
the' earth it is often sharp-cornered, and as large as
nuts, or even as hens' eggs. In these cases, either
the particles composing such hailstones have begun
to dissolve, or they were sufficiently cold to congeal and attach to their surface the particles with
which they came in contact during their fall.
If, when the sun is shining, a shower of rain fallsRAINIBO W--E LE CTRICITY,
either around or at some distance before us, we
may see in-the air opposite to the sun a large bow,
of bright and beautiful colours, which is called a
rainbow. This striking appearance is caused by the
sun's rays being refracted, or broken, in the falling
drops. The uppermost colour of the rainbow is red,
and the lowest violet. The moon also sometimes
shows a rainbow, formed by the refraction of her
rays in drops of rain during the night: but this
appearance, called the lunar rainbow, is very rare.

LESSON VIII.
ELECTRICITY-THUJNDER AND LIGHTNING.
GOD has also provided a     matter, respecting
which we know little more than that it communicates to certain bodies the power sometimes
of attracting, and sometimes repelling, other bodies.  At the same time a spark of liglit appears,
a snapping noise is heard, and a shock is commuo
nicated. This matter is called electricity.
334T~H-U NDE X R-LIGHT'IN G.
When, for example, a glass tube is rubbed
with a woollen cloth; small pieces of papelr,
straw, feathers, or other light bodies held over
it, will be drawn towards the tube, and driven
from it. If you put your finger to this tube in
the dark, you see a spark, hear a snap, and feel
a slight pricking in the finger. If you rub the
tube hard for some time, and then hold it near
your face, you feel a sensation, as if a cobweb
was spread upon your check.       Similar effects
are produced by other substances when they are
rubbed; such as amber,: sulphur, porcelain, and
sealing-wax.
The observation of these facts led to the construction of a machine, by which electricity can
easily be produced, and which is called the electrical machine.   By  means of this machine,
sparks have been produced of such power as,
in an instant, to melt metals and to kill animals.
This electric matter subsists in the clouds called
thunder-clouds, from which it issues in the form
of flashes of fire, which are called lightning.
The noise which usually follows the flash, or
the lightning, we call thunder.
The electric flame, which we call lightning,
when it strikes a tree or a house, either damages
or destroys it entirely, or sets it on fire.  If it
strikes men or beasts, it either stuns, maims, or
kills them. God, however, in his mercy, generally
protects his creatures from harm; and in the
benefits that attend thunder-storms compensates
34any mischief they do. Thunder-storms cool the
atmosphere and purify it from noxious vapours.
The rain which usually accompanies thunder and
lightning promotes the fertility of the soil and
the growth of plants.
Men have a contrivance for securing buildings from the effects of!ightning. A  long iron
rod, called a lightning-conductor, is erected close
to the house, in such a manner that the lower
end reaches into moist earth, and the upper rises
above the ridge of the roof. A rod of this kind
attracts the electric matter, and conducts it down
to the earth without injury to the building.  A
house surrounded by tall trees is rarely struck by
lightning, because the lightning is attracted by the
trees. Remember not to take shelter under trees
during a thunder-storm.
Sound is transmitted at the rate of 1142 feet,
or 380 yards, in a second; the distance of lightning may therefore be calculated, by accurately
observing the time which intervenes between
the flash, and the thunder which follows it.
IGNIS-FATUUS--FALLING STARS-AURORA
BOREALIS.
We have all heard of- lights, commonly called
Will-with-a-wisp, -or  Jack-with-a-lantern, but
known to scientific men by the name of ignisfatuus.  These lights are seen most frequently

in mines, in. marshy places, and near stagnating
waters. They consist of vapours, which, taking
fire, appear bright so long as they burn. They
move about with a dancing niotion, and have
sometimes caused serious accidents, by misleading
persons who have followed them in the dark,
under the idea that they were lanterns carried
by passengers.
Balls of- fire sometimes descend from the upper
region of the atmosphere. When they fall, they
look precisely like stars dropping from the sky;
they shoot along with great rapidity, and sometimes leave behind them, in the air, a reddish.
line, which gradually disappears. Sometimes
their motion is attended withi a hissing sound,
and they burst with a loud noise. Their light
is of dazzling brightness.'They have been often
observed, but the nature and cause of them are
not satisfactorily known.
Sometimes at night there is to be seen, in the
northern quarter of the heavens, a bright light,
like the morning atukora, or day-break, from
which rays issue, and which spreads itself by
degrees over a great part of the firmament.
The whole of the heavens at length appear quite
red and fiery, and exhibit a most beautiful sight.
This appearance is called the northern light,
or aurora borealis; and it is, like lightning,
an effect of electricity. It has never done mis
chief of any kind.

LESSON IX.
DIFFERENT RACES OF MANKIND.
THE whole world is supposed to contain about
700  millions of human      inhabitants.  Of those,
such as dwell together in a country, and are of
the same general structure, colour, language, and
manners, form one people, or nation.
Each of the principal divisions of the world is

subdivided into smaller portions, called countries.
there are various nations in each of the great
divisions of Europe, Asia, Africa, America,
and Australia; but all the different people in
the world bear some resemblance to each other,
either in shape, colour, look, or mode of life.
We believe, on the authority of the sacred
Scriptures, that all the races of mankind, scattered over the surface of the globe, notwithstanding the differences that the observer may at once
discover between them, are descended from one
pair. We believe, on the same authority, that
the whole earth was overspread by the descendants of three sons of Noah. /The influence of
climate, food, anrA civilization, particular modes
of life, and a variety of causes have, however,
produced many and striking diversities in the
outward appearance of the human form.
Those persons whom    we term  naturalists, because they devote particular attention to the
study of nature in all its branches, divide mankind into several principal races;-as, the Polar,
or Lapland race; the Mongol, or Tartar; the
Negro, or Ethiopian; the Red, or Coppercoloured; and the White race.

The Tchuktchi. (Siberian_.)
LESSON X.
THE POLAR RACE.
ALL the northern parts of the two hemispheres,
into which the globe is divided, are peopled by
nations belonging to the Polar race, who are very
dark, having a flat visage, and black hair and
eyes.  They are thick in form, and extremely
short in stature. To this race belong the Laplanders, in Europe; the Samoyedes, the Ostiaks, the
Tchuktchi, and the Kamtschadales, in Asia; the
Greenlanders and the Esquimaux, in America.
The inhabitants of Finland resemble those nations
in almost every circumstance, excepting their
height, which nearly equals that of other Europeans. Living under a severe climate, and subsisting
on particular kinds of food, their stature seems to40THE POLAR RAC'E.
have been affected by the hardness of their fare, as
well as their complexion by the intense cold.
The natural productions of the countries inhabited by these people being few, and the conveniences of life difficult to be procured, all their
efforts and study are directed to the supply of the
most urgent wants, the incessant recurrence of
which leaves them no leisure for the improvement
of their minds. Their manniers, tlherefore, are as
uncultivated as their appearance is uncouth.  The
tallest among them seldom exceed the height of
five feet, and many are not more than four. They
are of dlisagreeable look, haxvingo broad faces, with
short flat noses, eyes of a yellowish brown, high
cheek-bones, thick lips, and, in general, a weak and
effeminate voice. They have large heads, lank
black hair, and dark-brown complexions.
The resemblance of manners among these north
ern tribes, is not less remarkable than their simi
larity in stature, complexion, and features. They
are extremely ignorant, and have few religious
ideas. Being totally unacqtuainted with the arts
of civilized life, they covet none of its conveniences or luxuries; they are immoderately fond of
tobacco and spirituous liquors, which they procure
from their southern neighbours, in exchange for
the furs of various animals, the hunting of which
is one of their chief employments.
Though these people are strangers to every art
and science, and appear to be incapable of any
vigorous efforts either of body or mind, they
40Pt1iE POLAPR RACE.
tevertheless display considerable ingenuity when
stimulated by necessity; as well as great strength,
activity, and courage, wvhen (lifficulties or dangers
call for the occasional exercise of those qualities.
Providence, in withholding from  the people of
these northern countries the many blessings enjoyed by thle inhabitants of more temperate regions,
has given them a contented disposition: and so
strongly are they attached to their native land,
consisting in general of immense tracts of moun~
tains and morasses, that they cannot reconcile
themselves to any other situation, or to a residence
in a different part of the world.

LESSON XI.
THE MONGOL RACE.
THE second great variety in the human species
is the Mongol race, to which belong most of the
people we call Tartars; as the Mongols, the Mantchous, the Calmucks.   Tartary comprises the
whole of Central Asia, and is peopled by numerous
tribes, which, though somewhat different in features and complexion, retain those particular traits
of resemblance by which the whole race is distinguished from any other nation. All the Tartars
have the face broad and wrinkled, even in youth;
the lower part narrow, and inclining to a point at
the chin.  They have a flat forehead, a short flat
nose, high cheek-bones, thick eyebrows, small
oblique eyes, thick lips, and a colour more or less
yellow. They are of middle stature, strong, robust, and healthy.
All the tribes of Tartars lead a wanderitng life43
TfIE MOINGOL RACE.
They build no towns, neither do they cultivate
the ground, except for the purpose of raising a
grain called millet. They live in tents covered
with the skins of animals. Their chief food is
horses' or camels' flesh, which they often eat raw,
and their usual drink is camels' milk. Their principal wealth consists in lhorses, in the management
and care of which great part of their time is employed.   They practice robbery as a profession,
and thinlk it neither criminal nor dishonourable,
provided that it be exercised on people of a different tribe. Some of the Tartars are Mohamedans;
some are followers of a mock deity called the
Grand Lama, who is worshipped as a divinity;
while others of these wandering tribes appear to
have scarcely any religious ideas beyond a general belief in a Supreme Being.
In the Mongol race are inciuded the natives of
China and Japan. The features and the general
cast of countenance of these people show that
they are of Tartar origin; whilst the difference in
their manners, customs, and habits of life, is the
effect of a certain degree of civilization and of the
moral influence of political institutions.
Travellers are of opinion, that not only the'Tartars, the Chinese, and the Japanese, but all the
inhabitants of India beyond the river Ganges, have
one common origin, and belong to the same race.
The natives of the South Sea Islands and of the
great continent of New Holland are of Malay
origin. Those who live in the hottest of thoseTHE MONGOL RACE.

LESSON XI1.
TI'HE NEGRO PRACE.
THE negroes, or blacks, form the third and most
distinct race of mankind. They inhabit all the
coasts of South Africa, from the river Senegal to
the Red Sea. Indeed, it is believed, that the interior also of that extensive tract of country is
occupied by the black-complexioned race, with the
exception of Abyssinia, the inhabitants of which
are olive-coloured.
The negroes are not more remarkable for their
jet-black colour, than for the delicate smoothness
of their skin. They have deep hazel eyes, a short
flat nose, thick lips, long muzzle, prominent cheekbones, beautifully white teeth, and crisp, short,
woolly hair. The natives of Guinea are accounted
the ugliest of the black tribes, and those of Congo
and Mosambique the handsomest. Further southward they become a little paler, and take the name..::'.:,:::::::::::7::X:l:::-::::::::;,,.I.,.. " % "..,''..".", "..

It was among these black nations that the people
of Europe for several centurins purchased human
beings, whom they carried away to be employed
as slaves in the cultivation of the land in their
American colonies.  Our own nation was the first
to give up this barbarous traffic, an example that has

LESSON XIII.
THE RED, OR COPPER-COLOURED RACE.
THE original natives of America form a fourth
race, not less different in colour, than distinct in
habitation, from the rest of mankind.  All the
savage tribes of this vast continent, with the exception, as we have seen, of the Esquimaux, are
of a red, or copper colour. In the old world (that
is, in Europe, Asia, and Africa) diversity of climate never fails to produce difference of complexion; but among the original tribes of America,
(called the new world, because it was not discovered by the Europeans till about 350 years ago,) that
effect is not so perceptible: so that, among its
various nations, there is scarcely any difference in
colour, and less than might be expected in the
shape of the body and the features of the face.
They have all high cheek-bones, small noses and
eyes, thick, black, coarse hair, and remarkably
thin beards. Both men and women paint their48   THEI RED, OR COPPER-COLOUREI) RACE.
bodies and their faces; and, among some of the
tribes, fashion and taste in this method of decoration
seem to be as much studied as in the various modes
of dress among civilized nations.
Towards. the southern point of America is found
the tallest race of men in the world, called Patago
nians. Earlier travellers represented them as real
giants, but according to later observations, their
average height is between six and seven feet.
The native Americans are said to be more back
ward in facing danger than the people of Europe;
but, no sooner does it appear unavoidable, than
their courage is excited to the highest pitch.
They are then ready to suffer or to inflict the most
cruel tortures; and, either through native fortitude,
or the influence of custom and education, they display the utmost composure amidst the greatest
agonies. To conquered enemies they are invariably cruel, though kind and just to persons of their
own tribe. They are grave and serious in their
deportment.
Though many of'the tribes of the Americans
are equal in stature to thle Europeans, they are not
so muscular and strong, probably owing to the
climate, together with the scantiness or the bad
quality of their food. Most of these people lead a
wandering life, subsisting on the animals which
they kill in hunting, on fish, and on wild fruits and
roots.

LESSON XIV.
THE WHITE RACE.
THE WHITE RACEK.
A FIFTH and last great division of mankind is
the white race, with oval face, long hair, and
pointed nose. It comprehends the people of Europe, and some of the adjacent countries; for instance, the Turks, the Circassians, and otlher tribes
about Mount Caucasus, the Persians, the natives
of Hindoostan, the Arabians, the Moors, who inhabit the north of Africa, and the Abyssinians, as
well as the Jews.
In countries of such extent, there is considerable
variety of complexioli and countenance: in the
north, the people are larger and fairer, with light
hair, and blue eyes; whereas, in the south they
are dark, often very brown, and have black hair
and eyes.   There is an intermixture of these'I'HEWHITIE  RACE.
colours in the more temperate regions. As this
appears to us to be the most comely of all the
varieties, so it also surpasses the others in courage
and activity, and in the arts and sciences.
It seems that climate has a great influence on
the human complexion: yet the mode of life, and
the general tendency in children to resemble their
parents, contribute not a little to effects which are
often attributed to the former cause alone. The
Circassians, for instance,, the handsomest people in
the world, live under the same climate as the Tartars, who fall exceedingly short of the standard of
European beauty; and the Abyssinians are olivecoloured, while they are almost surrounded by

LESSON XV.
SAVAGE, PASTORAL, AND CIVILIZED NATIONS.
IN regard to their mode of life, the different
nations of the world have many points of resemblance. Some of them, which are called savage
nations, take no trouble to ensure a regular subsistence. They neither plant nor sow; they lay
up no store of provisions; they give themselves
no concern about the future, but go in quest of
food only when they are urged by hunger. Their
sole employments, therefore, are hunting and fishing. They do not even dwell together in villages;
have no fixed habitations, but only wretched huts,
consisting of a few poles, thrust into the ground,
and covered with skins of animals, coarse felt, or
only the large leaves of trees. Some even live in
holes under the surface of the ground; and among
these savage nations only a few families in general
associate together. These have no common head,
and no magistrates; but, in time of war, or on occasion of a great hunt, they have a leader, whom
they obey till the war or the hunt is over.
Other nations, called Pastoral Nations, or Nomades, from their wandering way of life, have no
fixed abodes, but only tents or huts, which they
easily take down and set up again; but they are
much more intelligent and less rude than the savage tribes, because they are engaged in rearing
cattle-a pursuit which requires much more attenCIVILIZED NATIONS.
tion and skill than hunting. Their herds and flocks
are their only wealth.'rThey move about from place
to place, and make a longer or shorter stay only in
situations where they meet with good pasturage.
Other nations, which are called civilized nations,
(such are all those of Europe,) employ themselves
not only in rearing cattle, but also in agriculture,
and in all kinds of arts and handicraft business.
They dwell together in communities, in permanent
and commodious habitations, forming cities, towns,
anci villages. These communities consist of persons
of various classes, namely, princes, nobility, gentry,
citizens, farmers, artisans, and others who follow
all sorts of trades, professions, arts, and sciences.
Civilized nations live according to laws; that is
to say,.they have agreed among themselves what
it shall be lawful or unlawful for each person to
do; and all who wish to dwell among them must
promise to submit to these laws and to obey them.
To enforce this obedience, even on the part of
the most ignorant and the worst disposed, they select a certain number of intelligent and upright
men, to cause obedience to be pai.d'to the laws,
and to punish offenders. The persons so charged
are called magistrates.
In many states a single individual possesses a
right to make laws and to appoint the magistrates.
This person is called the sovereign, or monarchg
and has the title of emperor, king, prince, or
duke. The countries which are under his governmient constitute his dominions.  A state in which
63CIVILIZED NATIONS.
there is no single person supreme, but all have a
voice in making the laws by which they are governed, is called a republic.
The form of government subsisting in the United
States is called a republic; the supreme head being
the president. From the circumstance of its being
composed of separate states, it is called a confederated or federal republic.? XC

THREE KINGDOMS OF NATURE.
PART' THE    FIRST.
LESSON 1.
V ANATURAL OBJECTS IN GENERAL.
THE earth, the air, and the waters, are filled
with living and inanimate objects. The more
we examine these, and the wider our knowledge
of them extends, the more do we learn of the
wisdom, the power, and the providential care of
our Maker and Preserver.
Nothing has been created in vain, for every
thing we can see is filled with beauty and design. The same care has been bestowed on the
structure of the most minute beings, as on that
of the largest animal, and every step in the study
of nature is full of interest and instruction. - We
cannot look any where without finding something
to admire, something to astonish and delight us,
and something to make us sensible of the goodness and bounty of God.
Some of these objects, such as man, beasts,
birds, fishes, and insects, live and move, and are
said to have animal life: others, as trees, plants,
grain, flowers, and moss, have also life, but it is
life of a different kind, and called vegetable life
whilst others, as stones, chalk, coal, and earth,

have no life, and therefore called inanimate
objects, that is, objects without life.
Every thing which " lives and moves, and has
a being," does so by the direct and mysterious
laws of God, which we can neitlher understand
nor imitate. " These are called natural objects,
or the " productions of nature;" terms by which
we distinguish them from the works of man,
which are called "productions of art."
The productions of nature are not alike in all
countries, as their growth and existence depend
in some measure on climate. Some countries are
very hot all the year round, others are very cold,
and others neither very hot nor very cold, but temperate.  This difference of climate makes the soil
vary in its degrees of productiveness.     Many
useful things, therefore, which plentifully grow
in one country, are not found in another; and this
has led the people of different countries to buy
and sell with each other, exchanging such articles
as they do not want amongst themselves, for others
which they stand in need of.  By this means the
productions of nature are spread over the whole
world, for the comfort and convenience of man.

LESSON II.
THE THREE KINGDOMS OF NATURE.
ALL objects with which we are acquainted have
been arranged by naturalists in three divisions,
called the "kingdoms of nature."  These are,
first, the animal kingdom; second, the vegetable
kingdom; and, third, the mineral kingdom.
The animal kingdom    is so named because
every thing which it includes possesses animat
life, that is, it can move and feel. This kingdom is already known to contain upwards of
twenty-three thousand different species, or kinds
of animals. The forms and sizes of these animals
are exceedingly varied; and they are found in
great abundance on the earth, in the air, and in
the waters. Some are so small as to require
the aid of a microscope to discover them; others,
as the elephant and the whale, excite our wonder
by their magnitude and strength, whilst others
delight us by the beauty of their colours, or the
elegance of their shapes.
The vegetable kingdom, which includes trees,
plants, shrubs, grasses, and mosses, is so named
from the objects embraced by it having what is
termed vegetable 7ife, that is, they do live, but
can neither move nor feel. A plant lives and
dies in the very same place it first took root, and
shows no signs of being sensible to injury. This
5708     AANIMAL AND VEGETABLE KINGDOM.
kingdom   is known to contain as many as fifty
thousand different species.
The mineral kingdom     includes all those natural objects which have no life, such as stones,
earths, metals, and many others. This kingdom
contains about two hundred and seventy species.
We are thus already acquainted with upwards
of seventy-three thousand -different kinds of objects, the whole of which come under the general
term, "productions of nature," and fall into one
of the great divisions, or kingdoms.
These kiingdoms are essential one to another,
for without the vegetable world animals could
not live, nor the vegetable without the mineral.
The meanest animal is designed for some certain
use, so is the most insignificant vegetable or
mineral; and this should make us careful to
examine every thing that comes before us, as we
shall never fail to find much that will both please
and instruct us.

Which the following? A rose-a pine tree-a strawberry?PRODUCTIONS OF HOT COUNTRIES.
LESSON III.
PRODUCTIONS OF HOT COUNTRIES.
THE animal, the vegetable, and the mineral
kingdoms, are found to differ in different countries.  The wisdom  of God has ordained that
every climate should produce those objects which
are necessary for the comfort and convenience of
its inhabitants. Thus we find that hot countries,
which have no winter, abound in juicy and refreshing fruits.  The cocoanut, the olive, the
date, the melon, the orange, and the pineapple,
grow luxuriantly, and afford grateful and refreshing food. A few dates and a crust of bread are
the dinner of the Arab, and a slice or two of breadfruit the simple and healthy repast of the South
Sea islander.
The animal kingdom, in hot countries, contains
some of the largest species that live on land. The
elephant has its native home there, and in its wild
state is found from ten to twelve feet high, and
from thirteen to fourteen feet long, and often60     PRODUCTIONS OF HOT COUNTRIES.
weighing six or seven thousand pounds. Even
with this enormous bulk and weight iL is an animal of quick motions, and will travel seventy or:
eighty miles a day. The camel, so beautifully
called the "ship of the desert," is capable of enduring intense heat, and, though burdened with a load
of six hundred pounds, can perform a journey of
sixty miles in ten hours. Many dry and sterile
regions of the earth would have been impassable
by beasts of burden, but for this docile and patient
animal. By a singular and wonderful provision,
it is enabled to travel several days without clrinking, over burning sands and under a scorching sun,
where any other creature would perish.
The ostrich, one of the largest birds, also dwells
in hot countries.  It cannot fly, as its wings have
nothing but soft, downy feathers upon them.  To
compensate it for this want, however, it can run
exceedingly fast, faster than the fleetest horse, and
would soon outstrip its pursuers, who hunt it for
the sake of its feathers, were it to go straight forwards; but it runs from side to Fide, and is soon
caught. Some of the largest snakes. as the boa
constrictor, have also their haunts in hot countries.
The people inhabiting warm climates are seldom
so strong or so active as the natives of temperate
regions. The soil is, however, so fertile, that the
finest fruit and grain are produced with little or no
labour. The fields are always green, and the trees
never stripped of their leaves; but blossom and
fruit,, seed-time and harvest, are in constant sucPRODUCTIONS OF IIOT COUJNTRIES.

THE PRODUCTIONS OF COLD COUNTRIES.
THE animal and vegetable kingdoms, in cold
countries, have a very different appearance from that
which they have in very hot ones.,..: The care of
Almighty God is however seen alilkie in;both; and
their productions are equally fitted to the'comforts
and wants of the inhabitants.'
The soil of very cold countries:caTntao- yield
much.   The summer is so short, that fruit and
grain do not ripen; and the few vegetables which
flourish there are chiefly lichens, mos~s, and stunted shrubs. The natives, therefore, do not seek
their support friom the vegetable kingdom, but live
almost entirely on the flesh of fish, water-fowl, and
wild animals. These exist in'great plenty, and
many of them are covered with thick fur, which
serves as a warm  clothing against the extreme
cold.
The rein-deer is an animal peculiar to cold countries. It supplies the inhabitants with almostPRODUC'I'IONS OF COLD COUNTRIES.  63
every thing which we obtain from the horse, the
ox, and the sheep, and provides for the greatest
part of their wants. A man's wealth in these
countries is calculated by the number of rein-deer
he possesses; for they supply all the purposes of
food, clothing, and draught. Their skins are made
into shoes, bedding, tent covers, and dress; their
horns into various kinds of vessels- their bones
into knives, spoons, and needles; and their sinews
into cord and thread. Very little trouble is required to keep the rein-deer, as it feeds chiefly on
leaves and mosses, which it seeks for itself, by
scraping away the snow that generally covers
the ground with its hoofs and horns.    It is
the familiar -.companion of its owner and his
family; and"iit can perform a journey of more
than a hundred miles in twenty successive hours.
The -fem-ale giv:es a rich milk, and the flesh forms
an excellkefi-t food.
In  other countries still colder, the dog is
almost equftly useful. In these situations, where
he is the ser'vant and companion of man, he gives
striking proofs of sagacity and docility. He serves
for drawing sledges over the frozen snow, and has
been known to travel nearly a hundred miles a
day. He braves the severest snow storms, and is
rarely known to miss his way, even when his
driver cannot keep his eyes open. The flesh is
considered an excellent article of diet; but so great
is his value that he is seldom killed, unless his
owner is severely pressed by famine.

T'he "mighty whale" and the seal form a, great
part of the means of sustenance to some tribes of
people in very cold countiies.  They are fondest
of the fat, or blubber, and, according to the account of travellers, are the greatest eaters in the
world.
The inhabitants of very cold countries are of
small size, but are strong and active in their persons. Their dress, which is composed principally
of skins covered with fur, is very warm, and
often very valuable, the fur being an important
article of commerce.

LESSON V.
PRODUCTIONS OF TEMPERATE COUNTRIES.
MANY of the most useful and valuable objects
in the three "kingdoms of nature" are found in
temperate countries, where the climate is neither
very hot nor very cold. We live in a temperate
country, and have summer, autumn, winter, and
spring, in regular and equal succession.  The
weather in these countries is in general very
changeable, but these changes are in the highest
degree favourable to the fertility of the soil.
The animal kingdom, in temperate countries,
embraces those creatures which are the most serviceable to man. The horse, the ox, and the sheep,
are found in theixr most perfect state, and are made
use of for draught, for riding, for food, and for
clothing; while the different sorts of grain and
grass, which serve for our own support, as well as
for that of animals, are more abundant than in any
other part of the world. In very cold countries,
none of these animals will live. The horse, whenTHE

reduced to a very diminutive size, being siarcely
so large as the smallest of our ponies, and soon
becoming old and useless; whilst in very hot
countries the cow loses some of her most valuable
properties, and the wool of the sheep is deprived
of its fleecy character, and is converted into hair.
The prodluctions of the vegetable kingdom, in
temperate countries, are much more varied than in
other situations. The wisdom of God has so ordered, that many of the most useful plants, which
grow in other climates, should also flourish here.
A much greater number of valuable vegetables are
therefore cultivated amongst us than any where
else. Wheat, the potato, many of our richest
fruits, and most of the ornamental shrubs which
adorn our gardens and shrubberies, have been
introduced from warm countries. And our forests,
though wanting in the magnificence and grandeur
of those of hot climates, abound with useful trees,
such as the oak, the ash, the elm, and the beech.
The mineral kingdom is peculiarly rich in temperate regions, where the climate is also favourable
for the labour necessary to make its Stores available.
Coal, iron, tin, lead, copper, and other minerals
essential to arts and manufactures, and to the comforts of life, are found in great plenty.  These
form valuable articles of commerce, as they are
useful to mankind in every part of the world.
The inhabitants of temperate countries are of

and vegetable matter. In this respect they differ
from the natives of very hot and very cold regions.
People in the latter climate, it-has been already
said, eat nothing but animal food; and in warm
climates, very little but vegetable food is consumed.
Thus we find that the productions. of nature are
fitted, in every country and in every climate, to
the peculiar wants and condition of their inhabitants; and thus, whereve-we look, we find cause
to admire the wisdom, and to love the goodness,
of the Creator of all things.

LESSON VI.
OF ANIMALS IN GENERAL.
ALL animals living upon the earth, in the sea,
or in the air have been arranged into six classes;
namely, mammalia, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects,
and worms, or molluscous animals.
Every animal has a stomach, that is, a cavity in
some part of its body, into which food is received,
and which there undergoes a process called digestion. This is one great mark of distinction between animals and vegetables, as these last have
nothing whatever in the shape of a stomach.
No animal but man possesses reason.  God has,
however, given to other creatures instinct, by
which they are enable(l to provide for allsFtheir
wants with unerring certainty. The instinctive
actions of many animals are very surprising,
They build habitations of the most curious construction, catch their prey with the most surprisingOF ANIMALS IN GENNERAL.
address, and do many other things which might
appear to arise from reflection and judgment.
A  particular kind of spider, which makes
itself a house in holes in the ground, shuts up
the entrance by means of a door, composed of
particles of soil, fastened together by threads of
silk. This door is held by a silken hlinge to the
opening at the upper side, and is so nicely
balanced, that, when pushed up, it shuts itself
again by its own weight. The most wonderful
examples of instinct are shown, however, by those
animals which live together in great numbers, as
the bee and the ant.  These build themselves
habitations of the most beautiful regularity, and
full of commodious apartments.
The niodes which some animals take to defend
themselves afford singular proofs of the care
taken for their preservation.  Horses have been
known, when attacked by a wolf, to range them
selves in a circle with their heads close together,
and to defend themselves by kicking out with their
hind-legs; oxen use their horns for the same
purpose, and the hedge-hog erects its prickles.
Some creatures, which live in water, make it
muddy when in danger, and the cuttle-fish throws
out an inky fluid, and by this means hides itself,
and escapes pursuit. Others, particularly amongst
insects, feign to be dead. The dor-beetle, which
is so commonly found humming about, will,
when it is caught, stretch out its legs quite stiff,

and lie perfectly   motionless, as long as there
appears to be any danger.'The force of instinct is also very strongly shown
by the way in which many birds build their nests.
Their eggs and young being much exposed           to
danger, the greatest ingenuity is displayed in
guarding them   against it.  Sonie build in thick
bushes, others in the clefts of rocks; the bankswallow burrows in sand; the starling covers her
nest with thorns; the spotted-woodpecker and the
nuthatch build in hollow trees, taking the greatest
pains to fill up part of the entrance with clay;
and many    birds, as the grosbeali, and    others,
in countries abounding with     snakes, which    are
very fond of nestlings, suspend their nests from
the extremities of the most delicate twigs, and
enter them through a narrow funnel-shaped passage from below.      ~

70ON THE SENSES OF ANIMALS.
GREAT differences are found to exist amongst
animals, as to the quickness and extent of range
of their senses. The eye of the eagle is very
acute; and he can see his prey when soaring at
immense heights in the air. Such animals as feed
ont carrion scent a carcass at great distances; and

That;'household depredator," the mouse, has also
a keen smell; and may be allured from its most
secret and distant haunts by a bit of toasted cheese.
The senses of the dog seem to be very acute.
Led by that of smell, he can find his way home
from great distances, and trace his master through
a crowded street. All his sensations indeed appear
keen; as he shows every mark of delight when in
company with those to whom he is attached, and
is dull and languid when absent from them. So

instances,have been known in which he has pined
and died when separated from his master. The
horse, too, obeys cheerfully the voice of his driverthe huge elephant pays willing obedience to his
keeper; and the patient camel bends to the earth
to receive his load.
There can be no doubt but that the possession
of a very nice sense of taste and smell is. the cause
which enables animals to select their food. I'he
larger horned cattle, such as cows, will eat only
about two hundred and seventy kinds of plants out
of the fifty thousand which the vegetable kingdom
contains.  They' leave all the rest untouched,
however beautiful and nutritious they may be.
The horse feeds upon two hunidred and sixty-two
species; whilst the hog, still more choice in its
selection in a wild state, eats only of seventy-two,
and will not taste any other.  Caterpillars show
the same capacity of selection; for if thirty different kinds of leaves are put in their wvay, they will,
perhaps, touch only one out of the whole number..The silk-worm subsists on the leaves of the mulberry tree, and the persons engaged in the rearing
of silk-worms are under the necessity of cultivating this tree on purpose to support them.
Thus, looking at a pasture-field, it will be seen
that some places are cropped quite bare, and others
left untouched; but as the tastes of animals vary,
those plants which are refused by one species are
eaten by another. Some plants, too, which are
poisonous to one creature, are eaten greedily, andON THE SENSES OF ANIMALS.
without doing any harm, by others. The goat,
the horse, and the sheep feed upon the waterhemlock, which is a' certain poison to the cow.
The sense of touch varies greatly in different
animals.   Man uses his hands, feet, tongue, and
lips for feeling: monkeys do the same.     In other
instances, this sense is chiefly seated in the snout,
the proboscis, or lips.  Birds use their feet and
bills for touching.   In snipes and ducks, which
have long bills, and which seek their food among
mud, the extremities of these are soft, and have a
very delicate sense of touch.
The hearing of most animals is remarkably
acute: thus, in watching birds and other creatures,
it is quite obvious that they are sensible of many
sounds that we do not hear.

CLOTHING OF ANIMALS.
THE carie " o'f a beneficent Creator is beautifully
seen in the clothing with which he has provided
his creatures.  This varies greatly in different
species, and in the same species, according as the
climate is hot or cold in which it lives; thus the
dogs of Guinea, and the sheep of Africa and India,
which are very hot countries, have so little wool
upon them that they may be said to be naked,
whilst the Siberian dog, and Iceland sheep, where
the climate is very cold, are covered with a thick
long fur. The covering of swine, in hot regions~.
consists of nothing but bristles; in colder districts,
however, there is, in addition to these, a quantity
of fine short wool next the skin.
The same variations are seen amongst our own
domestic animals. The hair upon horses growsCLO'THING OF ANIMALS.
longer and thicker as winter approaches, and thins
and falls off in the spring: this is called their winter-coating, and preserves them  from the cold.
The same thing takes place with cows and sheep.
Those animals which are sought after on account
of their furs, as the beaver, the fox, the hare, the
rabbit, and others, are never hunted during the
summer, because the fur is then thin and short, and
of little value. As soon, however, as winter sets
in, the fur ripens, as it is called, and rapidly increases in quantity and length.
Not only does the clothing of animals vary in
quantity, according to climate and season, but, in
many cases, it also changes colour.  The arctic
fox, during the mild weather, is of a bluish-gray
tint, but becomes quite white during the severe
cold of winter. The Alpine hare, which inhabits
the mountains of the northern part of Great Britain.
has a coat of tawny-gray for its summer-dress,
but in winter it changes to a snowy whiteness. A
similar circumstance takes place with the ermine,
which, from a pale reddish-brown, changes to a
beautiful whiteness.  This alteration in colour,
like the alteration in quantity, is a wise and beneficent provision to preserve animals from the, effects
of extreme cold.
The colour of the plumage of birds, like that
of the hair of animals, changes with the season in
many instances. The ptarmigan, or white grouse,
during the summer, has feathers of an ash colour,
mottled with dark spots and bars; but as coldEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1836, by

wveather comes on, the dark spots disappear, and
its plumage is left of a pure white: in spring, the
ashy colour returns again. The guillemot, a waterbird which frequents our coasts, during summer
is quite black, excepting a single white spot on its
wings. In the winter, the bird becomes of a dusky-white colour; and when seen in situations still
colder, it is perfectly white.

LESSON IX.
SLEEP, AND THE WINTER SLEEP OF ANIMALS.
OTHER animals have, like man, times of action
and of repose; and, when fatigued, seek a safe
and convenient resting place. Some are exceedingly watchful during sleep, and appear scarcely
to shut their eyes, as the hare and the chamois.
Cats, owls, and several beasts of prey, pass the
day partly in sleep, and seek their food during
the night.
The attention bestowed by.Almighty God
upon the works of his hand, is very forcibly
shown by the torpid state in which many of these
pass certain portions of the year. Animals which
have this peculiarity are called hybernating;
and, during the winter months in temperate
countries, and the dry seasons in hot ones, they
fall into a deep sleep, and remain motionless for
weeks and sometimes for months. They are, by
this singular means, preserved from  being destroyed by cold, and from perishing for want
of food, in seasons when it would have been impossible for them to have procured it.
Some of these hybernating animals towards
the end of autumn prepare for themselves, with
great, labour and skill, a winter-house, and
store it with provisions. The hamster, a very
common animal in Switzerland and Germany.

makes itself an extensive habitation under ground;
and in this it shuts itself up, first closing and
fortifying all the openings. Here, as the cold
weather advances, it feeds upon its stores, and
finally becomes torpid; in this state it remains
till the warmth of spring revives it, and fresh food
can be found. The marmot burrows a similar
house for itself; but it lays up no provisions, as it
becomes torpid at once, and never awakes till late
in the spring.
Bats retire to caves, the hollows of old trees, or
to the chimneys of uninhabited houses; and in
these situations may be found hanging in clusters.
The hedge-hog rolls itself up in leaves and dried
grass, and conceals itself in hedges; frogs congregate at the bottom  of ponds; lizards hide
themselves in -the clefts of rocks; spiders wrap
themselves up in their webs; the common housefly may always be found in some retired corner;
and snails fasten themselves to crevices in old
walls and other similar places.
Several hybernating animals occasionally awake
if a few fine days occur during the cold season.
Instinct has, in these cases, taught them to lay
up provisions, such as nuts, acorns, and other
things: these are either enclosed in their dwelling, as in the lhamster, or placed somewhere conveniently near.  That beautiful little  creature,
the dormouse, may sometimes, on a mild. day,

crevice not far off.
Creatures that pass the winter in   a torpidstate are generally cold to the touch, and appear to be almost dead.  They also become much
lighter during their torpidity, and when they
awake, in the spring, are very thin.

LESSON X.
MIGRATION OF ANIMALS-BIRDS OF PASSAGE.
THERE is another very curious proof of the
instinct of animals, and of the care taken for
their preservation;- and this is their mnigrations.
This signifies that, at certain times, they remove
from one situation to another- often to very
great distances; crossing wide seas, and passing
over entire countries: one kind of bat being
known to live here during the summer, and to
remove to the south during the winter.
There are but few quadrupeds which migrate
very far. These rather remove from one part
of the same country to another, according to the
seasons. Some kinds of deer, however, in northern regions, change their residence in summer and
winter, and travel considerable distances.
Many birds migrate, and   are hence called
birds of passage. We are, told in the Bible, that
fc the stork in heaven knoweth her appointed
times; and the turtle, and the crane, and theBIRDS OF PASSAGE.
swallow, observe their time of coming."  The
regularity with whichl these creatures depart from,
and return to us, is very surprising.  The same
pair of swallows have been known to occupy, for
several successive yealrs, the samle nest, and to
twitter, as old friends, at the same windowv-sill;
yet these, during their absence, muist have passed
their time a thousand miles to the south.
That most delicious warbler, the mocking bird,
which spends the summer with us in Pennsylvania, removes, at the end of autumn, into the south.
This bird is so constituted as to be unable to bear
the coldness of our winter.  During the summer our groves and orchards are filled with
"feathered choristers," busily engaged in rearing
their young; but no sooner is this effected, and
the cold winds of autumn begin to blow, than they
wing their way to more genial climates, again to
delight us by their reappearance, in sp!'ing, as the
harbingers of our finest seasons. T'hese birds are
called summnizer birds of passage; it is God who
teaches them their appointed times of coming and
going, and who guides them in their long journeys.
Most birds, when preparing to migrate, assemble together in great flocks. Thus we may see
clouds of swallows wheeling about in the air, in
September, as if they were trying their strength
of wing before their final departure. Woodcocks,
turtle-doves, wild-g,eese, and shear-waters, do the
same, and are always seen travelling in company.
There are other migratory birds, which spend
Sl82             3BIRDS 0o' PASSAGE.
the winter with us, and not the summer.     These
are called winter birds of passage; and are chiefly
water-fowl, that are driven from   more northern
regions by the freezing of the creeks, lakes, and
marshes. These leave us in the spring, when the
waters are again open, and breed while they are
absent; generally retiring  to Canada and New
Britain. Such birds as feed in the night, as the
woodcock, perform their- migration by night; and
others, that seek their food during the day, fly
during daylight, and rest at night.
When it is asked how birds can make such distant journeys? the answer is simple-The rate at
which they fly is quite astofiishing, and has been
calculated at from fifty to seventy miles an hour.
A day's journey would carry them, therefore, four
or five hundred miles; and, as they are capable
of remaining for many hours without food, ther
easily pass from one country to another

LESSON XI.
FIRST CLASS OF ANIMALS-MAMMALIA.
ALL animals, however various their forms, and
however different in their modes of living, have
been arranged inf i six classes. The first of these
classes is called maminalii, because the animals
included in it suckle their young, till they are able
to provide themselves wit-h food. They have also
been called viviparous animals, because their
young are born alive.
The mammalia, generally speaking, are quadrupeds, that is four-legged animals: man has
however, two feet, and is hence called a biped;
and the monkey tribe, instead of four feet, have
four hands, and are called quadrumanous, or fovu
handed animals.
The greatest part of the mammalia live upon the
ground. There are however some, as apes, squir84    STRUCTURE OF THE MAMMBALIA.
rels, and the sloth, which spend most of their time
in trees. A few, as the mole and-.,the hamster,
dwell chiefly underground; others, as the beaver,
the water-rat, the white bear, and the seal, are
sometimes on land, and sometimes in the water,
and a few live entirely in the sea.
Such of these animals as live partly on land and
partly in water have their fingers and toes con
nected by a membrane or web, which is of great
use to them in swimming. Bats have the long
finger-like toes of their fore-feet united by a
delicate web, which, when the toes are opened,
expands and forms wings, andc are by this means
enabled to fly.  They are the only mammalia
which have this power, though there is one species
of squirrel, called the flying-squirrel, which can
support itself for considerable distances through
the air when springing from tree to tree.
Many animals in this class have horny and undivided hoofs, as the horse and the ass; others
have cloven feet, as the sheep and the cow. MIost
of them walk on their toes, only a very few species
planting the sole of the foot on the ground.
The bodies of most of the mammalia are covered
with hair. Some have it scatterel very thinly
over the body, as the elephant and the rhinoceros;
others''are very thickly covered, as the sheep.
This hair varies greatly, both in length and colour.
In some species it is curled and woolly, as in many
varieties of dogs; in others it is stiff and straight,
forming bristles; and sometimes it is in the shapeSIT'RUC'TURIE OF THE MAMMALIA.  8
of strong and pointed spines, as in the hedgehog
and the porcupine.     There   are some   animals
which have the hair on the neck long and flowing,
as in the horse and lion, in these cases it is called
a mane; and in others it grows long under the
chin, and is then called a beard, as in the goat.
Besides claws and teeth, many of the mammalia
are furnishe(d with horns to defend themselves.
Those of the stag are branched, and termed antlers.
They are shed or cast off every year, and replaced
by new   ones, which are at first very soft and
tendelr.
Some animals of this class, as the ape, the seal,
and the hamster, are furnished with cheek-pouches, or little bags placed on each side the lower jaw.
These they use as pockets, and carry provisions
in them; others have a pouch or bag on the body,
which is large enough for their young to creep" in
when feeding, or when tlireatened with danger.

opossumI.. -.

85PRE FACE.
THE following work was originally published, as
one of a series of school books, by the Committee of
General Literature and Education appointed by the
Society for promoting Christian Knowledge. Alterations and additions have been made to adapt it to the
use of schools in this country, and it is now offered
to the public as a suitable class-book of natural science,
for popular use; presenting the pupil with a general
survey of the universe as a system; of the three kingJloms of nature, and the classes of objects comprised
in each; and, finally, of the form and structure of the
htumanl frame.
The editor believes that a work of' this description
will be acceptable to parents, teachers, and pupils.
The summary views of the universe, and of the several
classes of objects comprised in the departments of
zoology, botany, and mineralogy, will supply a want
which has been frequently complained of by persons
interested in education. That part of the volume
which is devoted to a description of the human form
and structure, is, perhaps, the most important of all,
though it relates to a subject which has been surprisingly neglected in our schools and academies. While
our children are taught many branches of learning
which are nearly useless, not a single school book
in colnmon use contains that amount of information
concerning the physiology of man which is essential

LESSON XII.
MAMMALIA OF THE SEA.
SEVERAL of the mammalia live entirely in the
sea.  Amongst these are various kinds of whale,
the narwhal, and the dolphin. These animals,
though living in water like fish, and having the
same habits in general, nourish their young in the
same manner as the other mammalia.
The whale is the largest of all animals, and
grows to a vast size, sometimes measuring eighty
or ninety feet in length, nearly as many in circumference, and weighing from two to three hundred
thousand pounds. The mouth of the whale is very
large, and the tongue fourteehn or fifteen feet long,
and seven or eight feet wide.ILLAMMALIA OF'1THE SEA.
This immense creature, however, lives upon
small sea-animals, and is provided with a very curious apparatus for catching them. This is what
is called whale-bone, and consists of numerous
plates, fixed to the top of the mouth, with a fringe
griowing from their lower edges. It is by means of
this fringe that the whale is enabled to catch its prey,
as it serves as a sort of sieve to entangle the small
animals that are taken into its enormous mouth. Its
skin is very smooth, and looks almost like oiled
silk, and beneath this is a coating of fat from ten to
twelve inches thick. It is for the fat, or blubber,
as it is termed, that this huge animal is principally
sought after, as it supplies us with train-oil. The
nostrils open on the top of the head, and are called
blow-holes, through which it can spout water with
great force. The whale dwells in the frozen seas
of the north, and is very useful to the people inhabiting those desolate regions.
The spermaceti-whale yields the fine oil called
spermaceti. These huge creatures are very quiet
and inoffensive, and are generally seen in shoals
or pairs.
Another of the mammalia, which lives in the sea,
is the dolphin. This animal is much celebrated
for the beauty of its colours, and for its sportive
character.  It is often seen playing about ships in
great numbers, gamiboling  backwards and forwards; and when taken from the water, exhibits a
series of very brilliant colours.

LESSON XIII
UTILITY OF THE 3MAMIMALIA TO MAN.
ALL the "productions of nature" are designed,
by their Divine Author, to fulfil some wise and
beneficial purpose. Among the rest, the mammalia are especially useful to man; and serve for
riding, for drauglht, for carrying burdens, and for
cultivatinig  the land.  For these purposes the
horse, the ass, the ox, the buffalo, the rein-deer,
the elephant, the camel, the dog, and the llama
are willing servants.  Man also finds his principal supply of food in this class of animals; the
flesh of the ox, the sheep, the goat, the hog, the
stag, the hare, and the rabbit forming a nourishing and palatable diet. In some countries the
flesh of the horse and the dog is much esteemed.
The fat, the blood, and the milk of mammalia are
also used as food.
Besides these uses, many parts of animals are
of the utmost importance to the comfort and conIT'rILITY OP THE MAMIMALIA TO MAN.   91
venience of man. He derives the greatest part
of his clothing from  their skins, their hair, and
their wool. Many skins are prepared with the
hair left upon them, and in this state are called
furs, or in commerce peltry. These are furnished
chiefly by wild animals; as the fox, the hare, the
beaver, the ermine, and the sable.
The fur of these, and the hair of the dog and
the goat, are made into hats. That of cows and
calves, and horses, is used for stuffing chairs,
sofas, and mattrasses, and for making hair-cloth,
the finler sorts of which are sometimes used for
clothing, and the coarser for packing valuable
goods. The   shining  stuff, used for covering
chairs, is made of horse-hair, and the hair of
violin-bows is procured from the tails of horses.
Camel-hair is used for making hats, and a stuff
called camlet; and that of the Angora goat is
manufactured into a yarn, from  which various
stuffs are woven. The wool of the sheep is,
however, the most valuable, being converted, by
means of the loom, into woollen cloth, shalloon,
serge, baize, and flannel.
The skins of wild boars and seals are used (
covering trunks; but the most important use p o
the skins of animals is to make leather, by a
process telmed tanning. This is the business of
the tanner, wno employs the skins of oxen,calves,

a variety of useful and ornamental articles; as
knife-handles, boxes, and combs; and glue is
made by boiling down their bones, horns, and

TDS TIN GENERAL.
BIRDS form the second class in the animal
kingdom. They differ very widely from    the
mammalia, both in their structu're and appearance, and in the mode of producing their young.
They all lay eggs,' and are hence called oviparov X animals. These eggs, on being incubated
or sat upon, are hatched by the warmth of the.
mothrr, and at the end of a certain time young
birds are produced from them.
TYLe form of birds is very gracefull, and though
a Dumerous class, they have a strong general
resemblance to each other. All of them  have
twvo legs, two wings, a horny bill, and a body
covered with feathers. They are found in every
part of the world; and, like all other natural
objects, afford striking proofs of the wisd(om and
care of their Creator.  In very hot countries

forests, or gliding over the richest plains in the
most brilliant and gorgeous colours, and of the most
beautiful and delicate shapes. The parrots, the
crested pheasant, that " floating gem" the humming bird, and the singular but superb bird of
paradise, are very numerous. In very cold countries birds are much less plentiful, and consist
chiefly of water-fowl. These seek their support
in lakes and creeks of the sea, as the ground is
almost continually frozen or covered with: snow,
and consequently does not yield any food. In
temperate countries there are a great variety of
birds, as some from hotter climates spend the summer there, and others the winter, from cold regions. MaIay of the birds of these countries are
also song-birds, and fill the grove and forest with
the most delightful music.
The vision of birds is in general very quick,
and of very wide range. The swallow, which,
feeds on small insects, catches them when on the
wing, and many of the rapid evolutions it makes
are for the purpose of seizing a prey too minute
to be seen by man. The hen, when surrounded
with her brood, will detect a hawk at a distance
far beyond our limit of sight; and the redstart,
though perched on the top of a lofty tree, will
dart to the ground, and with unerring aim seize
upon the smallest insect.
