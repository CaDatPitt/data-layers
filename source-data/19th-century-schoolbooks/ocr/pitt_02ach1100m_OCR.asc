6. Sophia’s uncle made her a present
of a very pretty little chair, with a satin
hair bottom and brass nails. Whenever
Eliza wanted it, Sophia would get up in
a-moment, place her dear sister on it, and
allow her to sit there as long as she
pleased. Her father then bought a little
chair for Eliza, so that each of the children
had one.

'7. When Eliza took up any of her sister’s
books, Sophia did not snatch them away
from her, but she only said, “ Come here,
my dear Eliza, bring me the book, I will
show you the pictures, and explain them
to you.”

8. When the children went out to walk,

6. The sun is glorious, but He that made

GUN POWDER.

1. Gumownsn is in little black grains;
it is used to kill animals and men. Al-
most every body l1z1sl1e:;trd the noise inade
by guns and cannon: it is very loud, like
thunder. This noise is caused bf.’ gun-
powder.

2. The gunpox"vder is put into a gun, or
cannon; and as soon as it is touched by
fire, it bursts from the gun with {-1 great
noise. This is called an explosion. Gun»
powcleriis made of three things: sulphur

JUVENILE nmnna. 109

or brimstone, nitre or saltpetre, and char-
coal

3. Before men had learned to make
gunpowder, they used to kill each other
with swords; now, when they ﬁght, they
take pistole, guns, or cannon, ﬁll them
vrith gzempowder, and leaden or iron balls,
and point to the Spot whither they wish
the balls should fly; the balls kill the per-
sons whom they etrike.

4. The art of making gunpowder was
found out before the art of printing was
invented. Gunpowder was first made in
1380.

 

GEORGE WASHINGTON.

1. ON a ﬁne morning in the fall of 1737,
Mr. Washington, having little George by
the hand, came to the door and asked my
cousin and myself to walk with him to the
orchard, promising to Show us a ﬁne eight.

2. On arriving at the orchard, we were
presented with a ﬁne sight indeed. The
whole earth, as far as we could see, was
strewed with fruit: and yet the trees were

them. He would not play with bad
boys.

12. Now, James, you and George ma
go and play. You must not play Wit
bad boys, for they will cheat. You must
play fairly.

13. Do not play too hard; you will
hurt the little boys. You must be brisk
and lively at play; butdyou must not be
rude. Use no bad W01’ s when you play.

14. W'l1ot will you play’? Will you
play hide and vs'hoop, or ball? Or will
you wllip the top, or jump the rope?

15. Here is a top. Can you spin the
top? You should not Spill your top on
the foot pavement, because you will be
m the way. People must walk on the
foot pavement. Go into the yard, and
spin your top there.

16. James, can you play ball’! Here
is a. ball for you; toss it u . This is a
very good ball; I bought It for a good
boy; see how it will bound.

17. George, can you jump the rope‘!
Little girls jump the rope. Girls must
play sometimes as well as boys; Jane and
Ann may jump the rope. It will be good
for them.

bending under the Weight of apples, which
hung in clusters, like grapes, and vainly
strove to hide their red cheeks behind the
green leaves.

3. “ N ow, George,” said his papa,

“ look her-e, my son! do not you remem-.

ber, when this good cousin of yours
brought you that ﬁne large apple last
spring, how hardly I could prevail on you
to divide with your brothers and sisters;
though I promised you that if you would
but do it, God would give you plenty of
apples this fall 9.”

4-. Poor George could not say a Word ;,

but hanging down his head, was quite
confused, While With hislittle naked toes
he scratched in the soft ground. “ N ow
look up, my son,” said his papa, “ and
see how richly that blessed God has made
good my promise to you. Wherever you
turn your eyes, you see the trees loaded

,With ﬁne fruit, many of them indeed

breaking down, While. the ground is cov-
.er,e‘d with mellow apples, more than you
could ever eat, my son, in all your life
tithe.”

5. George looked in silence on the Wide
wilderness of fruit; he marked the busy

JUVENILE READER. 111

humming bees, and heard the gay notes
of birds, then lifting his eyes ﬁlled With
shining moisture, he said, softly, to his
papa, “ VVell, papa, only forgive ‘me this
time, and see if I ever be so stingy any
more.” i

6. Wlien George was about six years
old, he Was made the Wealthy master of a
hatchet, of which, like most boys, he was
very fond, and Was constantly going about,
chopping every thing that came in his Way.

7. One da.y in the garden, Where he
had often amused himself hacking his
1na.mma’s pea-bushes, he tried the edge of
his hatchet on the body of a beautiful
young English , cherry-tree, which he
barked so badly, that I do not believe the
tree ever got the better of it.

8. The next morning, the old gentle-
man, ﬁndin out What had befallen his
favourite tree, came into the house, and
asked for the a‘uthor of the mischief, de-
claring at the same time, that he would
not have taken ﬁve dollars for the tree. ,

9. ,Nobody could tell him any thing
about it. Presently George a.nd his little
hatchet made their appearance. “George,”
said his papa, “ do you know who killed

112 conn’s

that beautiful little cherry-tree yonder in
the garden ’Z’’

10. This was an unpleasant question;
and George staggered under it for a mo-
ment, but quickly recovered himself; and,
looking at his papa, witli the sweet face
of youth, briglitened with the charm of
honesty, he bravely cried out, “ I can not
tell a lie, papa; you know I can not tell
a lie. I did it with my little hat<:.l1et."

11. “ Run to my arms, my dearest boy,”
said his papa; “ you have paid me for
my tree a thousand times ; and I hope my
son will always be hero enough to tell
the truth, let what will come.”

 

HOW TO MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

1. Roninm‘, a peasant of forrain, after

 him! day’s work at the next market

town, was returning home with a basket
in his hand.

2. What a nice sn per I shall hate!
(said he to himself ;) this piece of kid well
stewed down, with my onions sliced,
thickened with my meal, and seasoned

JUVENILE READER. 113

with my salt and pepper, will make an
excellent dish. Tien I have a piece of
good barley loaf at hrnne to finish With;
how I long to be at it!

3. A noise in the liedge now attracted
his notice, and he spied a squirrel running
up a tree, and popping into a hole between
the branches. Ha, tlicmglit. be, what a
nice present a nest of youiig squirrels will
be to my little master! I will try ii’ I
can get it.

4. Upon this, he set down his basket in
the road, and began to climb up the tree.
He had half ascended, when, casting a
look at his basket, he saw a dog with his
nose in it, getting out the piece of kid’s
ﬂesh.

5. He made all possible 5 eed down,
but the dog was too quick liir him, and
ran off witli the meat in his mouth. Robi-
net looked after him. VVe1l, said he,
then I must be content with a soup
meager, and no bad thing neither.

6. He travelled on, and came to a little
pgbliitk house by the road side, where an
acqtiaiiitance of his was sitting on a bench,
drinking. He invited Robinet to take 2-.
draught.

Vigiichﬂtlifg pnelal vlvals tied up, and hopped

8. Robinet did not perceive the theft
till he was on his Way again. He return-
ed to search for his bag, but could hear
no tidings of it.

9. W311, said he, my soup will be the
thinner but I will boil a slice of bread
with it,’ and that will do it some good at
least.

port her With his other hand, let his basket
drop into the stream.

12. As soon as she was safe over, he
jumped in and obtained it; but when he

took it out, he perceived that all the salt
Was melted, and the pepper washed away.

HARRY AND LUCY.

1. HARRY. Was brother to Lucy, and
Lucy Was sister to Harry. Harry had

_J11St come home to his papa’s house: he

had been left at his unole’s when he Was
an infant, and had always lived at his un-
ole’s house.

2. Lucy lay in a little bed in a closet
near her mamma’s room, and Harry lay in
a little bed in another closet.

8. Early in the morning, While Lucy
was in bed, the sun shone through the
window upon her face, and awoke her;
when she was quite awake, she knew that
it was morning, because it was daylight.

4. And she called to her mamma, and
said, “ Mamma, may I get up ’l’’ but her
marnma did not answer her; she did not
hear her, because she was asleep. Wlien
Lucy knew that her matmna was asleep,
she lay still, that she iniggltt not distltrb
her, until she heard her stir; then she
asked her again if she riiiglit get up, and
her mamma said she might.

5. So Lucy got up, and put on her
stockings and shoes, and ﬁnished dressing
herself, and then went to her mamma, and
asked for some breakfast. Her mamma
asked her to make her bed, and told her,
when it was made, she should then have
some breakfast.

6. Little Lucy began to make her bed,
and her mamma vsrent into her other
closet, to awake Harry; she said, “ Har-
ry! get up 2” Harry jmiiped out of bed in
an instant, and put on his trousers, his
jacket, and his shoes; and then he washed
his face and hands, and combed his hair,
and While he was Wiping his hands, his
mamma went down stairs.

7. As soon as Lney had eaten the
breakfast which her mamma had given
her, she sat down in her little chair, and

JUVENILE READER. 117

took her work out of her work bag, and
worked some time; then her mamma told
her she had worked an hour, and that she
did not choose she should work any more;
so Lucy got up, and brought her work to
her inanima, and asked her if it were done
as it ought to be done.

8. Her n*1an"nna said, “ Lucy, it is done
pretty well, for a little girl that is but six
years old; I am pleased to see that you
have tried to mend the fault which I told
you of yesterday :” then Lney’s mamma
kissed her, and said to her, “put your
work into your work bag, and your work
bag into its place, and then come back to
me.” Lucy did as she was desired to do.

9. Lney’s mamma took her little daugh-
ter out with her into the ﬁelds. As they
walked along, Luey’s rnamma said, “ I
think I see some pretty ﬂowers there;
will you run and gather me a nosegay ?”
Lucy said, “ Yes, niamrna,” and ran away
to do \Yl1£1tl1(i‘I' mamma had desired: when
she came to the place where the flowers
Were, she gathered two or three of the

that had a sweet smell, and she gathered
some of them, and was taking them to her
mamma., when she saw some honey-
suckles, that were Very sweet, and they
were very pretty too.

11. She was glad she had found them,
because she knew her mamma liked them;
but when she came close to them, she saw
they were so high from the ground that
she could not reach them.

12. Lucy did not like to go away With-
out taking some honey-suckles to her
mamma; so she Walked about till she
came to a place Where there Was a large
stone; she climbed upon it, and gathered
as many honey-suckles as she liked.

13. While she was getting down, she
held the flowers fast, for fear that she
should drop them, and she felt something
prick her linger Very sharply; she look-
ed, and saw a large bee drop down off
one of the honey—suckles, which she had
squeezed in her hand: so she thought
she had hurt the bee, and that the bee had
stung her, to make her let him go.

THE GOOD BOY, AND BAD BOY.

1. VVHEN Clxarles Bruce was at home
for 3. short time from S(IllOOl, he went to
see his aunt. T118 :m11t lmcl no boys or
girls of her own to play ’Witll him ; so she
told him she would take him to play with
the son of afriend of hers.

2. Charles Bruce was at good boy, and
his aunt thought that George Smith, the
boy to whose house she took him, was a
good boy also; for she had not yet heard
of his bad tricks.

3. George Smith had carts, and whips,
and bats, and balls, and kites, and to s.
He had more toys and playtllings than he
could use; and sohe did not care for them
at all.

4. George was but a rude boy. He did
not love to go to school, not yet to read

bee Very much, for Whenshe opened her
hand, the bee did not ﬂy away, but
dropped down ; so she looked for it on the

ground, and she soon found it in some
‘Water, trying with its little legs and Wings

to get out, but it was not strong enough.
15. Lucy was Very sorry for the bee,

but she was afraid to touch it, lest she

should hurt it again, or that it should hurt
her. She thought a little While What she
could do, and then she got a large stalk
of a ﬂovver, and put it close to the bee,
and as soon as the bee felt it, he clasped
his legs round it, and Lucy raised the
stalk, with the bee upon it, gently from

the Wet ground, and laid the bee upon a

large ﬂower that was near her.

16. The bee was sadly covered with
dirt, but as soon as he felt that he Was
standing upon his legs again, he began

stostretoh his Wings, and to clean him-

selﬂ and to buzz a little upon the ﬂower.

17. Lucy Was glad to see that the bee
adid not seem to be much hurt, and she
Stook up her nosegay, and ran as fast as
::she i could to her inainina ; but the ﬁnge-if
‘Which the bee had stung was Very sore,

18. She met her mannna coming to her,

who wondered what made her stay so
long ; and when Lucy told her what had
happened, she said, “ I thank you, my
dear, for getting me so sweet a nosegay,
and I am Very sorry you have been hurt
in doing it; I am sure you did not intend

to hurt the poor little bee; we will walk

home now, and I will put some hartshorn
to your ﬁnger, and that will lessen the
pain you feel.” T

19. Lucy said, “indeed, mamma, I did
not intend to hurt the bee; I did not
know that it was in my hand; but when
I am going to gather ﬂowers another
time, I will look to see if there are any
bees upon them.”

20. Wlien Luey’s mamma got home,
some hartshorn was put to Lucy’s ﬁnger,
and soon after it grew easier; and her
mamma said to Lucy, “ I am going to be
busy ;, if you like it, you may go into the
garden till dinner time.” Lucy thanked
her mamma, and ran into the garden. I

21. After breakfast, H.arry’s papa took
him out to walk; they had not walked
far, before it began to rain; they made
haste to a blacksmith’s shop that was

door.

22. A farmer came riding to the shop,
a.nd asked the blacksmith to put a shoe
on his horse; he said the horse had just
lost a shoe a little Way off, and would be
lamed, if he Went farther on the stones
Without a shoe.

23. “ Sir,” said the blacksmith, “ I can

not shoe your horse ; I have not iron
enough. I have sent to town for some
iron, but the person I have sent, Will not
be back before night.”
, 24. “ Perhaps,” said the farmer, “you
have anold shoe that may be made to fit
my horse.” The smith had none. Little
Harry, hearing him say so, told his papa,
that he thought he could find a shoe for
the farmer’s horse.

25. His papa asked him Where he
thought he could ﬁnd a shoe. He said,
that ,he had observed something as they
came along, which he believed was a horse
shoe. His papa, begged the farmer to
Wait a_ little While; and then, as the rain
hadiceased, he walked with Harry on the

when the smith tlhought the iron was hot

had made the shoe “of a proper size and

shoe on the horse’s foot.

31. While the smith was making jthe
nails, the shoe lay on the ground near the
anvil; Harry wanted to take it up, to look
at it; but he would not meddle With it
Without lea.ve. L

82. Another little boy ‘came into the
shop, who stooped down and took up the
shoe in his hand; but he quickly let it
drop, roaring’ in a vi.olent manner, and said
that he Was burnt.

33. While he was crying, and blowing
his ﬁngers, and pinching and squeezing

them, to lessen the pain, the smith. turned
him out of the shop, and told him, if he
had not meddled with What did not be-

TlT’e“li.ttie boy Went away muttering, that
he did not know black iron would burn
him.

34. Harry had‘ never seen a horse shod
before; he was very much surprised to see
the smith drive nails into the horse’s foot,
and to see that the horse did not seem to
be hurt by the nails, for the horse did not
draw away his foot as if he felt pain.

35. Harry’s papalsitsked him if his nails

the horse’s hoof gave a piece of it which
he had cut oﬁ", to Harry. Harry ilelt that
it Was not so hard as bone, nor so soft as

10. The eye that sleeps not is God’s;'

his hand is always stretched out over us.
He made sleep to refresh us when We are

5. George would throw stones at the
doge and pigs, and call it good fun, when
he made them howl and cry. If he were

6. Charles did not know all this, but he

soon found it out; for the cat was lyi g

on the mat by €he_door, and George gal e
her a kick as he went by; he next met
the dog, and struck him with a Whip he

ﬂesh, a pleasant repast; and the skin,

and of the bones, spoons. A Laplander
can travel ﬁfty or sixty miles in a day,
with his raindeer and sledge.)

5. There are several other kinds of
deer, all of which are beautiful and very
sprightly. The stag, Whose female is
called the hind, is the most common; His
height is about three feet and a half, and
his general colour reddish brown. _

6. He has large and branching horns,

by which he is sometimes entangled in

the Wood, impeded in his ﬂight from
hounds a.nd huntsmen, and in conse-
quence is caught.

7. The ﬂesh of the deer, which is called
Venison, is meat of great value; and his
skin is dressed for clothing. Sometimes
the meat of a stag has been found to
Weigh three hundred pounds.

8. Besides the stag and the hind, there
are among the animals called by the
name of deer, the buck, Whose female is
called the doe, and the hart, the male of

WILLIAM AND MARY,

OR THE HAPPY CHILDREN.

1. MR. CANTINE, one ﬁne summer day,
having promised his two children, William
and Mary, to treat them with a Walk in a
ﬁne garden a little Way out of town, Went
up into his dressing-room to prepare him-
self, leaving the two children in the
parlour.
  2. William was so delighted with the
thoughts of the pleasure he should re»
ceive from his Walk, that he jumped about
the room, Without thinking of any, evil
-consequence that could happen.

3. But he had the misfortune to brush
‘the skirt of his coat against a ﬂower of

‘Very great Value, which his papa was

srearing with great pains, and which he
 just removed from before the window,
in order to screen it from the scorching
glneat of the sun.

4. “ O, brother,” said Mary, taking up

132 coBB’s

the ﬂower which was broken off from the:

stalk, “ what have you done '2”

5. The sweet girl was holding the ﬂower‘
in her hand, when her papa., having dressed:
himself, came into the parlour.

6. “Bless me! Mary,” said Mr. Cantine,
in an angry tone, “ how could you be so
thoughtless as to pluck a flower, which
you have ‘seen me take so much care to
rear, in order to have taken seed from it “.3”

.7. Poor Mary was in such a fright, that
she could only beg her papa not to be
angry. Mr. Cantine, growing more calm,
replied, he was not angry, but reminded
her, that, as they were going to a garden
where there were so many Various kinds
of flowers, she might have waited till they

got there to indulge her fancy. He there-

fore hoped she would not take it amiss if
he left her at home.  

8. This was an unpleasant condition for
Mary, who held her head down, and said‘
nothing. Little William, however, was
of too generous a temper to keep silences
any longer.

9. He went up to his papa, with his‘:
eyes swimming in tears, and told hint,
that it was not his sister, but himself, who»

nnly. 'l‘l1e pecsple cultivate it in the East
II1(li€S, in the \Vest Indies, and in South
Amerir:a..

2. The {X111 grown tree is abcmt twanty-
five feet Iligh. The coffee grows in the
centre of a kind of fruit, like a cherry, of

JUVENILE READER. 135

a deep red colour, from which the kernel

separates in many different ways.

3. It begins to bear the second year,
and is in full bearing the third. In the

iWest Indies and in South America, each

plant produces from one to two pounds of’
eoﬂ'ee in a year.

 

TEA PLANT.

1. THE tea plant, which is an ever-
green, grows to the height of five or six
feet. The leaves, which are the only
part of any value, are about an inch and
a half long, narrow, indented, and taper-
ing to a point, like those of the sweetbrier,
and of a dark green colour. .

2. Its ﬂowers resemble those of the

v,,vl1ite wild rose. The stem spreads into

many branches, which are not regular.
The wood is hard, of a whitish greencol-
our, and the bark is of a greenish colour.

3. The leaves are not ﬁt for being
plucked till the shrub is of three years’
growth. In seven years it rises to a
man’s height; but as it then bears but a

136 coBB’s

few leaves, it" is cut down to the stem,
and this produces a crop of new fresh
shoots the following summer, every one
of which bears nearly as many leaves as
a whole shrub. i  

4. Our teas a.re chieﬂy brought from
China, in the east of Asia. There are
many diffefelit kinds of tea, among which
are hyson, souchong, and bohea; _ but
whether these all grow on the same plant
or not, is doubtful.

5. The quality of the tea depends Very
much on the soil in which the plant grows,
the time when the tea is gathered, and
the manner in which it is treated.

6. Fifty or ‘a hundred years ago, our
ancestors made their breakfast and supper
on milk, and sometimes broth; now, tea
or coffee is drunk twice a day in almost
every house. Milk, no doubt, is better for
children; and, it is very probable that it
would be more healthy for adult persons.

 

SUGAR CANE.

1. THE sugar cane grows in the West
Indies, and in the southern part of the

JUVENILE READER. 

United States. The canes are planted in
ﬁelds somewhat like corn; and, when
they arein full blossom, such a ﬁeld is one
of the most beautiful productions that can
be seen.

2. The sugar cane is a jointed reed,
‘commonly measuring from three feet and
a half to seven feet in height, and some-
times rising to ‘twelve feet. When ripe,
it is of pa ﬁne straw colour, incliningito
gyellovv, producing leaves or blades, the
‘edges of which are ﬁnely and .sharp1y
serrated. j ‘ r

 The joints of one stalk are from .ﬁfty
to sixty in number, and the stalks rising
from one root are sometimes very nu-
merous.

e 4. In harvesting the cane, the leaves
are reserved as food for Cattle, andpthe
stalks cut into pieces about 'a yard long,
bound into bundles, and carried to mill,
Where they are bruised, and the juice is
extracted, and boiled into sugar.

5; ,When the soil is very good, one
acre ‘commonly produces about three or
four thousand pounds of moist, brown
sugar, and sometimes even as zarany as

"eight thousand pounds.

HARRY, PETER, AND... WILLIAM,

AND THEIR THREE CAKES.

1. THERE was a little boy whose name
Was Harry; and his papa. and mamma.
sent him to school. Harry was a fine boy,
and loved his book; and he  the first
in his class.

2. His mamma arose very early one
morning, and called the maid, and said, I
think we must bake a. cake for Harry,
for he has learned his book very well.
And the maid said, yes, with all my heart.

3. So they made 3. nice cake. It was

very large} and ﬁlled full of plums and;
sweetmeats, orange, and Citron; and if

was iced all over with sugar: it was
White and smooth on the top like snow.
So this cake was sent to school. I

4. When little Harry saw it he was
ver glad, and jumped about fer joy; and
he I ardly stayed for a knife to cut a piece,
but gnawed it.

5. So he ate till the bell rang fer school,
and after school he ate again, and me till
he went to bed; and, his bedfellow wd

that he laid his cake under his pillow, and
sat up in the night to eat some.

(5. So he ate till it was all gone. But
presently ztfter, this little boy was very
siclc ; and ever}: bod}; said, I woiitler
wliat is the matter witli llarry: he used
to he so brisk, and play about more nim-
bly than any of the boys; and now he is
pale and very ill : and somebody said,
Harry has had a rich cake, and ate it all
up very soon, and that has made him ill.

7. So they sent for Dr. Chamomile, and
he gave him a great deal of bitter medi-
cine. Poor Harry did not like it at all,

‘but he was forced to take it, or else he

might have died, you know. So at last he
was well again: but his mamma said she
would send him no more cakes.

8. Now, there was another boy, who
was one of Harry’e school-fellows: his
name was Peter. Peter had written his
mamma a very neat pretty letter; there
was not one blot in it.

9. So his mamma sent him a cake.
Now Peter thought with himself, I will not
make myself sick with this good cake, as
silly Harry did; I will keep it a great
while.

10. So he took the cake and carried it
up stairs. It was very heavy: he could
hardly carry it. Andihe locked it up in
his box; and once a day he Went slyly up
stairs,and ate a very small piece, and then
looked his box agaixi.

11. So he kept it several weeks, and it
was not gone, for it was t'ery large; but,
behold! the mice got into his box and
nibbled some.

12. And the cake grew dry and mouldy.
and at last was good for nothing at all.
So he was obliged to throw it away, and
it grieved him to the heart, and nobody
was sorry for him.

13. Well, there was another little boy
at the same school, whose name was
Wiylliam. And one day his mamma sent
him a cake, because she loved him dearly,
and he loved her dearly. So when the
cake came, William said to his school-
fellows, I have a cake, come, let us go and
eat it.

14. So they came about him like a par»
cel of bees, and Williaxn took a slice of
cake himself, and then gave a piece to one,
and a piece to another, and a piece to an-»
other, till it was almost gone.

15. Then William put the rest by, and
lid, I will eat it to-morrow. So he went

play, and the boys all played together
try merrily.

16. But presently after an old blind
.dd1er came into the yard; he had a long
vhite beard; and, because he was blind,
me had a little dog in a string to lead him.

17. So he came into the court, and sat
iown upon a stone, and said, my pretty
lads, if you wish, I will play you a tune.
And they all left off their play, and came
and stood round him.

18. And William saw that while he
played, the tears ran down his cheeks.
And’! William said, “ Old man, why do you
or .”

19. And the old man said, “ Because
I am ver hungry; I have nobody to give
me any inners or suppers; I have nothing
in the world but this little dog; and I can
not work. If I could work I Would.”

20. Then William went, without say-
ing a word, and brought the rest of his
cake, which he had intended to have eaten
another day, and said, “ Here, old man!
here is some cake for on.” The old man
said, “ Where is it’! or I ameblind, I can

MISS JOANNA HAWKINS.

for her age.  

2. She had a good memory, and learned
gramular, history, and poetry, very Well.
But, with all her acquirements, this young
lzgdy was not much beloved, because her
behaviour was not ladylike, and she was
often very rude and violent.

JUVENILE READER. 2'5

3. One day, when Joanna was not in
an obliging liumour, she began Worrying
and teasing her little brother Robert, till
he was quite cross, and cried so much
that her nurse begged her to let him
alone, and not to make him naughty.

4. 'I‘hen Joanna flew into a passion,
struck her nurse, and spoke to her in a
very haughty manner, asking‘ her how she
durst ﬁnd fault with her, who Wasa lady,
and saying she did not choose to obey a
servant.

5. The nurse said she did not think it
was behaving like a lady to strike any
one, for she had always been told that
ladies were persons who were mild and
gentle in their manner.

6. Joanna answered, I do not care, I
will strike you if I like; I know you dare
not touch me. J nst as she was lifting up
her arm to strike the nurse again, Mrs.
Hawkins came into the room.

'7. She was much surprised to see Jo-
anna so naughty. Mrs. Hawkins told the
nurse not to take any notice of her, or
do any thing for her, until she would con-
duct herself more properly.

8. The next momgng Joanna, as usual,

26 conn’s

began to call for the nurse to dress her
first. The nurse answered, Miss Joanna,
it is of no use to call to me, for young
ladies who will not belmxre civilly to set-
vants must wait upon themselves.

9. Joanna was rather»surprised at this
speech, betas she fancied herself ex-
tremely clexterons and skllful, she mot»
tered, “I do not care; I call dress myself
quicker thE1.n that tiresome old nurse, who
always keelws me wsrztiting, while she is
anmslingg all the other children.”

10. So u 1 shejmnped? and began to put
on her clothes; but in her hurry to get to
her dear papa before he had done break-
fast, she forgot to Waslx her hands and
face, and to comb her hair.

11. She‘ managed to put on her clothes
in an awkward manner, for the strings
came into knots} and in trying to undo
the knots, she broke the strings.

12. At last she began to recollect that
she might prevent her dress from falling
oﬁen by tying the handsome pink sash
s he wore in the afternoon, tight over her
waist.

13. So she put this ﬁne sash upon her
strawcolonred morning frock; and, as

JUVENILE nmnen. 27

she did not know which way to tie it be-
hind, she tied it before her; and then
dragged it on till '.she felt that the how
was behind her, and she thought that she
haul managed all titles very eleve1‘ly.

Ll. She then went to the drawer to get
a clean I1pl‘(.)l1; but the d1':tw(:r stttck so
tiglit that Sllc was not able to open rit;
so she was obliged to put on the dirty one,
and she went into the breakfast parlour
such a figure as you never saw.

15. Her hair was roitigh, her hands and
face dirty, her frock lianging on one side,
her sash riband twisted, with the bows
tied the wrong way, and her apron quite
dirty.

16. Her papa stared at her with amaze-
ment, and her Innamma then told him that
Joanna had behaved so ill to her nurse,
that she had desired the nurse not to do
any thing for her.

17. Mr. Hawkins replied, that he thought
children who choose to behave in a haugh-
ty manner to servzmts, otiglit to wait on
themselves, and as he did not like to have
so dirty a child to breakfast with him, or
even to come near him, he desired that
the nurse might give her something toeat

by herself, for he thought she was not fit
to sit with her brothers and sister.

18. Joanna, who saw that her father
was very much displeased, slunk away.
At ﬁrst she was sulky; but, after sitting
a little while, she began to think that it
was all her own fault.

 3  She thought she had been very
sill l as well as very naughty in being so
r11 e to the person who had to wait on and
take care of her, when she knew she was
not ﬁt to be seen without her assistance.

20. As her papa had refused to see her
While she was such a ﬁgxire, she resolved
to ask her nurse to forgive her.

 

21. When the nurse saw that Miss J 0- .

anna was really sorry, and that she intend-
ed to behave roperly in future,she washed
and dressed ler, and Joanna went to see
her dear papa, who kindly forgave and
kissed her.

22. Miss Joanna, always keeping it in
mind that her ill behaviour had made her
very unhappy, left. off making improper

speeches, and learned to speak civilly to’

every body, and to thank those who wait-
d on her.
23. Then every body spoke well of Mi&

mvnma airmen. 29

Joanna, for she could spell and read v
well, and was learning to draw lan -
scapes; and she Wrote very neatly, never
tumbling her paper or scrawling it over,
as rnany thoughtlew children do.

24. Mr. Hawkins was much pleased
that she had so much reformed, and told
all his friends that his little daughter Jo-
anna was an excellent child.

ally wicked; for he did not mind break-
ing his word, or telling nntri.it.lis to con-
ceal his faults, by denying wliut he had
done.

5. This was partly owing to his mam-
ii1a’s spoiling him when he was a babe,
by giving him every thing he cried for;
and, as James found that the louder he
screamed the :-sooner he obtained wliathe
wanted, he g"reW up a very passionate and
furious child} so that evcfry person, exceﬁt
his mainma, disliked little J airieseﬂoeley.

6. As soon as he was old eneuglfto run
about by himself, he vs*as constantly in
mischief’, breaking and spoiling his mam-

ma’s furniture, who, not liking this, now
began to be angry and punish him.

7. James, who had been so long used
to have his own way, instead of being
sorry when his momma punished him,
and trying to do better, attempted to
avoid ptuiislnnent by denying What he
had done, and laying the blame upon
some other person.

8. As his mamma could not think that
her son would be so Wicked as to tell false-
hoods, two or three servants were ttfrned
away for destroying the china and other
things which this naught boy had broken
himself, and then told 1iS marnrna they
had done it.

9. Just after Mrs. Cooley had left the
house, James looked out from the window,
and saw Giles, theploughboy, driving the
cows u to the yard to be milked.

10. here were three cows. One of
them was quite black, excepting her face,
which was almost as white as snow.

11. Another cow was red, with vet
large white spots; this cow ‘was srnali:
but very handsome. She had so good
temper, that she was the dairy-ma.id’s fa-
vourite.

12. The third cow was a very large
brindle cow, with great horns; her (301--
our was a dark red, with streaks of
black or brown, so that she was not so
pretty as either of the other two.

13. This cow was an ill-tempered

creature at all times, but much more so

when she had a young calf, so that Ra-
chel, the dairy—-maid, was quite afraid of
her; and even Giles was forced to fasten
her head, before he began to milk her.

14. When Master James saw Giles
driving these cows into the cow-house,
he ran out after him, and said, “ Sto for
me, Giles", I must see the calf that is in
the cow-house.”

15. “ N o,” replied Giles, “ you must
not. It is the brindle cow’s calf, and she
is so ill~tempered, that you must not come
near her.” is

16. “ But I will come, I am rwolved,”
said James; and he was hurrying on,
when Rachel, knowing his stubbornness,
took him rip, and earriegl him by force into
the house. He screamed, and struck poor
Rachel, and hurt her sadly.

17. Still she held him fast until the
nurse met her, and locked him up in her

34 eoBB’s

closet, Where he ﬁrst roared, and then
was sulky fora long time. p

  18. At last he promised to be good;
and as the cows were then gone back into
the ﬁeld, the nurse let him go into the gar-
den to play with hissisters in the bower.

19. But this naughty child chanced to
spy that the small gate was not fastened,
and he knew that Was the Way to the
ﬁelds. So the moment the nurse had
turnedand left him with his sisters, off
he ran, pushed open the gate, and scam-
pered into the meadow Where the cows
Were grazing.

20. The moment the brindle cow,
Which happened to be nearest the gate,
saw James, she ran up to,lii1f1’, and, bend-
ing down her head, tossed him up so high
in the air with her large horns, that the
fall broke both. hislegs.

21. She was going to toss him again,
when Giles and two ploughmen came
with long poles, to drive her away, and
then they took up poor James, and carried
him into the house.

SHOES.

1. SHOES. that you Wear on. your feet
are made of leather. The shoes are
made by the sl1oemake1'. Tiles Cobbler
mends shoes.

2. Leather is the skin of animals, tan-
ned, after the hair is taken oﬁ‘. There are

JUVENILE READER. 39

two kinds of leather in your shoe. The
upper leather, which covers the t@ of
your foot, is of one kind, and the sole or
bottom of the shoe, is of another.

3. The upper leatlier of shoes is made
of the skin of a calf, or sheep, or S(3£"ol.
Sometimes the Iipper leather  made of a
kind of fine leather called morocco ; some-
times of prnnello. The sole leather is
made of the skin of the cow, or ox.

4. After the bntclier has killed‘ the ani-
mal, he strips off the skin, and sends it to
the Currier.  The cnrrier puts some lime
upon it, which loosens the hair ; afterward
he scrapes the hair off the skin" with his
enrrying-knife, and then washes itclean,
and dries it.  

5. When the hair is taken on‘, the skin
is tanned. Tanning  the trade of the

of a tree, either the henilock or oak,

bark draws the skin to make it leather.

8; When the skin has been tanned a
sufficient time, it is taken out and dried.
The tanner then colours, or makes black
the leather which is to be used for upper
leather ; but the thick leather to be used
for sole leather, is not blacked. Harness
is also made of tanned leather.

9. The astringent property of some
substances draws up the parts of other
things, and makes them harder and thick»
er. Alum is astringent, and the bark used
for tanning is astringent.

MR. BRO\VN"S FAMILY.

1. IN a neat genteel cotta,-.;,re, near a
populous village in New England, there
lived a family of the name of Brown.

2. Mr. Brown had two daughters and
two sons. " The names of the daughters
were Lucy and Frances, and the names
of the sons were Lewis and George.

3. L110 was nearly nine years old, and
many sai she was pretty; but she was

JUVENILE READER. 41

so rude and so rough, that an old gentle-
man, wlio lived just opposite, and visited
Mr. Brown, gave her the name of “Miss
Tomboy.”

4. Frances, who was between seven
and eight years old, had a ditlerent tem--
per ; for she was very gentle and obliging,
and never grumbled at her nurse, or re-
fused to comply with any thing she was
desired to do.

5. If Lucy, in a passion, chanced to
thump or strike her, as she sometimes did,
Frances would go quietly away until her
sister’s ﬁt of passion was over.

6. Lewis was a sturdy little fellow,
and he loved Frances dearly, and he loved
Lucy too, but not quite so much, because
she often liked to tease him, and to snatch
things from him.

7. Lucy was most to blame, because
she was older than Lewis, and therefore
knew better; besides, her bad example
made him almost as rude and violent as
she was.

8. Lucy sometimes snatched the play-
things from George, the babe, and then
he would scream and cry: yet Lucy was
not an ill-tempered child; she was fond of

4!

42 coBB"'s

her brothers and sister, bntshe loved her
own will best. i

 Lucy always felt Very sorry after
her passionwase OV€I',_'8.IlCl promised to
behave fbetter ;   but the moment any one
did not instantly give lierwhat she Want-
e_d,, she Would snatch it, and thenthere
would be great noise, and also a quarrel,
which is a Very unpleasant sight, at least,
between lbrotlier and sister.

 ltliappened one «day, that Mrs.
Brown showed Lucy two large pieces of
silk, one was green, the other was crim-
son, and told her, that as she Was the
older, she might choose which she liked
better for her doll’s slip. i

11. Lucy chose the crimson,and lVlrs.
Brown gave Frances the y green silk.
Frances ran to her nurse, saying, “ See
What a large piece of nice green silk I
have for my doll’s best dress; I am going
to make it directly; is it not a bealltlflll
green 1?”,

12. The nurse answered, “ Yes, Miss
Frances, it is Very pretty; briglit. green is
my favourites colour.” A

13. Lucy, who was standing by,seemed
rather vexed, for she gave Frances a great

JUVENILE READER. 43

push, sa.ying;, it‘; Get away, Frances, ietlne
come and show my silk; is it notbeautié
ful, nurse 3 see What a. ﬁne /briglitycrimson
it is. I might have had that green piece,
but 1 did notlike it, and E am sure mine
is _p.rettier.”

14, “ Very] likely it may be,” "answered
the nurse, “ and Iain glad‘, Miss Lucy,
that you a.rep1ea.se,dfWith it.” y

15, Lucy replied, “  am sure you must
like it better too; do you not think it more
handsome, nurse 2?”   “ 1 cannot say that I
do, Miss Lucy,’ said the nurse; “ it is Very
pretty, but to my fancy, green is ‘a better
colours than crimson.”  

i 16; Lucy began to turn her silk, and
twist it over her, ﬁngers for a minute,
then she Went to Frances, and said, “ I
will give you this handsome crimson‘ silk,
and you shall give me your green silk.’’: 2

17. Frances was a sitting at the table,
with her scissors in her hand, ready to out
the skirt of the do11’s frock, and she an-
swered, “ No,,i thank you, sister Lucy, I

do not Wish to ci1a.ng‘e.” “ But you must,

change,” said Lucy, “ for i like yours bet-
ter, and I will have it; E am the older.”
18. “ You did choose,” said Frances,

44 coeB’s

“ and you can not choose again.” “ But
I will,” said Lucy, “ so give it me direct-
ly ;” and she took hold of the silk which
Frances held tight with both her hands.

19. Lucy seized the scissors, struck
Frances, and cut her arm, which bled
over her white frock. The nurse scream-
ed, and Mr. Brown ran up stairs, and put
a bandage on Frances’ arm.

20. Wlieti Lucy was a. babe, her pa-
rents used to say, “ how funny it is to see
her try to beat us; dear little creature,
she shall have What she wants ;” and
then they kissed her, and let her do what
she chose.

21. But now Mr. and Mrs. Brown were
convinced that she deserved correction,
and they resolved to make her good ; and
when Lucy was corrected and reproved
for her naughty tricks and rough behav-
iour, she left them oil’, and became a
gentle ladylike child.

WHAT IS PLEASANT.

1. IT is very pleasant to walk in the
ﬁelds, and to have the sun shining wherev-
er we go, and always to have some gay
thing before us.

2. There are some people who would
like to have nothing but summer, and who
wish that the days were always long and
bright, and that there were no cold wind,
or snow, or winter nights.

_3. I have heard some little boys and
girls say, the should be very sorry when
the bad Weat ier came, for they should not
then be able to play at all, and would
have nothing to make them happy.

4. But they were very wrong, or else
were very idle children, for there are many
reasons why they should not be sorry,
when the snow or the rain keeps them
Within doors.

5. Without snow or rain, the seeds from
which the ﬂowers and the fruits of the
summer spring up, would perish and never
do any good.

6. This is cause enough to make all
good children contented, though the bad

46 coBB’s

Weather should s:.oxnctimes keep them at
home.

'7. But I will tell you zanrtxtlaer thing,

HUGH AND ROBERT.

1. 37112. JACKSON lmd two fine sons,
wlxose names were Ilugla and Robert, to
whom he gave 3;! nice little pony.

‘2. It \Y2\S the fztvomite empl«)yn1ent of
Robert, the younger son, to feed this pony,
which knew his \*0iee, and mused to gallop
up to him wllenever he went to the gate
of the ﬁeld and called him.

3. Hugh, the older son, was x*ery fond
of stutly, and spent, but little time in
axxmsemexlt of any kind. He paid so
good attention to his books, that, at the
ag-e of seven year.~s, he could spell, read,
and write very Well; and, he could also
cipher in the rules of addition and sub-
straction.

48 comfs

4. He was so very studious, that, at the
age of twelve years, he had not only made
great advances in eiphering, but was
quite well acquainted with the history of
diﬂerent countries.

5. He then commenced the study of
botany and cliymistry, which he pursued
with great ardour, and soon became a very
good botanist and chymist.

6. Htigll loved his little brother very
much, and was grieved to see him de-
vote so much time in playing with his
toys and ony, and neglecting his books.

7. Hug 1 was also very fond of visiting
the shops of meehanicks; and, he was so
attentive and observing, that he knew the
use of nearly all their tools. He was not,
however, a rneddlesome boy, but was cu-
rious to know the use of what he saw.

8. He knew the use of the hammer,
addiee, girnlet, chisel, saw, pincers, vice,
awl, last, and many other tools; and, he
knewhow a mortise, tenon, shoe, scythe,
hoe, and many other things, were made.
Robert was quite different from him.

9. Robert was very liberal; for when
his papa or mamma gave him any sugar
plums, raisins, chestnuts, walnuts, or ﬁgs,

JUVENILE READER. 49

he ‘Would always request his brother
E’I11g‘_l1ltO:aC(3€ptia part of them. E T _

ll). Robert had a little trough orbasin
in which he fed his pony, and gave‘ him
drink. The saddler made him a small
saddle, on which Robert” sat when he rode
his little pony; and his papaibought an
epaulet for him to Wear on his shoulder,

so that he had the appearance or a little

r—e(:1'uiting sergeant;  
11. Tliough Robert was so good—na-E
tured to animals‘, he did not spoil them;
and henseidto show his mamma that his
pony was not restiﬁ" or unkind when he

rode him, for the moment he said, “ Go

on ” the animal used to rick L1 his ears
7 7

and trotoff’ as fast as he could, and Robert  

doted Very much on his skill in riding
him.

12. I am sorry to say that there are many
cruel boys who are fond of beating ani-
mals, at least poor ponies, not being
aware that the more ponies are beaten,
the more obstinate they become.

13. Indeed, it is a fact, that evenchil-
«dren, who are often -sadly beaten and
knocked about, are always sulky and
aobstinate.

THE METALS.

1. GOLD is of a deep yellow colour. It
is very pretty and b1'igl1t. It is exeeecling:
heavy; l1€‘clYi€I‘ tlmn any thing else except
platina. »

2. Men dig it out of the ground. Shall
I take my spade arid get some? No; tliere
is none in the ﬁelds hereabouts: it comes
from a great \\'ay oil ; and it lies deeper
3. great deal than) you could dig with your
spade.

3. Eagles are made of gold; and half
eagles. This \\~'atcl'1 is gold; and the
lookirig-glass frame, and the picture frames.
are gilt witli gold. Here is some leaf gold.
Wliat is leaf gold’? It is gold beztthvery
thin; thiimerthanleaves of paper.

4. Platina is of a whitish colour; not
quite so lorigllt as silver; it is very lxard,
and t.l1el1ea\'iest ofall metals. Reﬂectixig
mirrors for telescopes, pendulums, and
watcli-springs, are made of platina.

5. Silver is white and shinintr. The
spoons are silver; and this thimble is
silver; and dollars, and half dollars,
and dimes, and half dimes, are made of

JUVENILE’ READER. 51

silver. Silver comes from a, great way

‘off too.

6. Copper is red. The kettle and pots
are made of copper, and cents and half
cents. Brass is briglit and yellow, al-
most like gold. This saucepan is made of
brass; and the looks upon the door, and
this eancllestick. What is this green upon
the saucepan’! It is rusty 3, the green is
verdigris; it Would kill you if you were
to eat it.

'7. Iron is very hard. It is: not pretty,

but I not know What We should do
Without it, for it makes us a great many

things. A
8. Go and ask the cook Whether she
can roasther meat Without a spit. Wel-l,
What does she say C’ She says she can not.
But the spit is madeof iron 3, and so are
the tongs, and the poker, and the shovel.
9. Go and ask James if he can plougli

Without the plougl'isl1are. Well, what

does he say? He says, No; he cannot.
But the ploughshare is made of iron.

10. Will iron melt in the fire? Put the‘

poker in and try. Well, is it. melted?
No; but it is red hot, and soft; it will
bend. But, I will tell you, Charles; iron

52 comfs

will melt in :1 very hot fire when it has
been in :1 great while; then it will melt.

11. Come, let us go to the smith’s shop.
What is he cl0in_g_r;’? He llas El forge; he
blows the tire with 21 pair of gwat bel-
lows, to make the iron hot. New it is
hot. Now he takes it out with the twigs,
and puts it upon the arrvil. Nmv he beats
it with :1 lmxmner.

13. Lead is soft, and very lieavy. Here
is apiece: lift. it. There is lead in the

7. The sun is supposed to be a very
large globe of ﬁre} but (lilf€I'€illL from any
we kimw. It is many tliousaml times
larger than the world you live in. It keeps
every thing‘ that grows, alive by its heat;
for in all plants and trees there is a juice
called sap, which, if the sun did not melt

JUVENILE READER. 55

It, would be so thick, that they would not
shoot out.

8. Ytiu know that in winter all the
leaves drop oil" the trees, and there are no
plants or corn gro\\*in,9;; that is because
the sun shines but little at that time of the
year, rises late, :intl sets early ; so that the
earth Iias less heat than it has in the sum-
mer, when it appears early in the mom~
ing, and we do not lose sight of it till late
at night.

9. The constant heat of the sun, in
the long warm days, dissolves the sap

but as it is only for a little while, We do
very well, because there is plenty of pro-

moisture out of the earth, but much more

are too heavy, they break, and fall down
in showers.

he minds his business, a.nd, if they speali:
to him,ansWers them very civilly.

9. He‘ never talks or Whispers to his
school-fellows; for that, he knows, would
prevent both them and himself from doing
the business they have to do ;, and he has
plenty of time to talk when he is not at
school  

10. When the scholars, in his class, are
reading, or spelling, or repeating their ta-
bles, or any thing Which they have learn-
ed, he is very attentive, and learns a great

deal by hearing them, and What they are

taught.

11. He is always ready to answer any
question that his master asks him; and
when he reads or speaks,.pronounces his
Words so distinctly, that he can easily be
heard, and understood.

12.. When he does not understand any
thing he has to learn, or that is said to
him, he asks his master, in a very respect-
ful manner, to explain it‘ to him; but he
never interrupts his master when he is
speaking or is very busy.

. 13. ’I‘he diligent scholar is desirous to
learn something useful every day; and to
remember What he has learned; and he

JUVENILE READER. 61

is not contenteil with hixnself if he does
not lind that he lll)[)l‘()V'(3S every day he
lives.

14. He wants to learn  quick as pos—-
sihle} all that he ean learn at selmol, in
()l‘(lCl‘ that he inay go to \\’()I'l{ tn ggget his
own living, and not be a hixrtlen to his
poor parents an 3' longer than he can help.

133. He lmnours and 1'e:~;peets his master,
and pa g_;*reat Elli/((?llll(’lll to all he says,
not giving him the l,..l‘()1ll)lC to repeat the
same tllll'lg (wer and over agaliri.

16. He lIllll(lS his l)1lSil'1(I.‘$S as well,

he is stamling near l"llll"l, and looking at
him. ‘ If I were a niaster,’ says he, ‘ I
slmnld like my selmlztrs to be kind and
attentive; de.~:.imn.~s to learn and to im-
prove, and to give me as little trouble as
they emild.’ “

17. When he has any thing to learn or
to do at sclinol that is Vt:-ry dillicult, he
often thinks within liiimsell: ‘ my pzirents
will he very glzid when tlw_y hear that I
l1a\'elea1'x1ed to do this liard task; and

 He is very kind to the yolingest

scholars, almost as if they were his own
little h1'otol1er.~;:. He tells t.hem \\‘l’l:1t to do,
and how to l.)oliz1x'e, and tzxkes their part if
any I'\;l('lt3 lioycsr, who are lzxrgei‘ than they,
wouhl harm them.

28. If ztny of his S(.'«ll(“)(l)l-i~t~?lIOVVS; or any
other boys, mimltl tempt him to join with
them in rohhing orchzmls or gardens, or
in* telling; lies, or in doing an__\* other
wrong actions; he is never a.“5l1i1Il'lC(.l} or

29. When he sees any of his school—fel-
lows steztl or light, or hears them lie, and
1.138 hzugl words, he is \'e1*}' .~3or1°}* for them,
and often begs them not to do so wicked-
ly.

30. If any of the scholars llave ﬁner
clothes than he has, he does not trouble
l1i1nsell' about that: his parent.s:, he knows,
give him elothes and every tllillg else, as
good as tliey can afford, and he wants no
better.

31. He does not em'}' the soliolars
who are riclxer, or more handsome, or
strongrer, or wiser them he is; or despise
those‘ who are very poor: or sickly, or
lame, ordetlmnetl. or dull.

32. He knows that the great and good

JUVENILE READER. 65

God made them all; and that We ought
to behave as kindly to all persons as we
wish that they should behave to us.

33. When school-time is over, he goes
away without xixakingg any noise or dis-
t1{lI‘l)aI1Ce. He does not stay to play or
loiter in the stnrccts and on the road.

31. He goes home asyquickly as he can,
he has so much to tell his parents and to
do for them. ‘My parents,’ says he, ‘are
very good to let. me go to school that I
may learn writing and accounts, and ma-
ny iiseful things.

35. ‘They say they have not time to
teach me all they could wish me to learn,
and they do not know how to teach me
so well as my master does.

36. ‘Before I went to school they taught
me to read, and almost every thing I
knew; and now, whenever I am at home,
they are almost always teaching me some-
tliing about my work and about my duty;
and I think I could not take so much pains
at school as I do, if it were not to please
them. y

37. ‘I am sure I ought to do all I can
to help and serve them. 43:1 often wish
that I could do as much, mornings and

almost think I could do it, if I were to

39. Wl1CI1lllS xnastor tells him, or he
hears or rearls at school, any tliing; that
is very good, or that he t.hinks his pa.-
rents would like to know, he is sure to
tell them: he likes to tell all the good
he can.

40. But when any thing had happens,
he does not like to mention that, unless
it be to prevent some mischief to any
body; or unless his nmster or his parents
order him to do it; and then he tells it ex-
actly as he thinks it was. A

41. He is Very kind and good to his
brothers and sisters. He likes to teach
the little ones, and to help to take care
of them, and he endeavours to set them
all a good example.

42. He never neglects his duty to God,

JUVENILE READER. 67

either in the morning; or at niglit. Often
in the clay he thinks of (incl, and of his
great g()t)(.l1le.~3S, even when he is not
readim: about him, or p1'ayino; to him.

43. He lm'es to hear the Bible read,

are very kind to him.

45. Ilis mzirster too loves him, and com-
mends him very much to all who make
inqiiiries about him, and often speaks of
him, and his good conduct, to his other
scholars, and wishes them to take pat»-
tern by him, and to behave as he does.

46. When he leaves school, he will
often, I dare say, think of what he learned
there, and try to remember it, and to im-
prove himself in it.

47'. He will be tlizmkful to his parents
and to his master, who were good to him,
and took so much pains to teach him; and,
he will also he tliankful to God who gave
him so good parents, and so good a master.

48. If he is to go into a store or he an
apprentice, 111:in_y' people who lime htxml

THE HONEST BOY, AND THE
THIEF.

1. Cn.-mnss was the name of the honest
boy, and Edwin was the name of the
thief. Charles ne\'e;;t,ook for his own W hat
did not belong to him; this is being an
honest boy.

2. Edwin often took what was not his
own; this is being a thief. Charles’ fa-
ther and mother} when he was a very
little boy, had taught him to be honest,
by always reprox*ing him when he med-
dled with what was not his own; but
when Edwin took What was not his own,

JUVENILE READER. 09

his fatlier and motlier did not reprove
him, so he grew up to he a thief.

came to the door, ‘I will not have In

'7. ‘Can you so ‘.1’ said the orange man,
then I will engage, my lad, to give you the
ﬁnest orange in my basket when If come

While I a1n aWay.’—-—‘ Yes,’ said Charles,
‘I Will take care of your oranges.’ ,

8. So the man put the bridle into his
hand, and he Went into the house to eat
his breakfast.

9. Charles had Watched the horse and
the oranges about ﬁve minutes, when he
saw one of his sc11ool—felloWscoming tow-
ard him. As he came nearer, Charles
saw that it Was Edwin.

10. Edwin stopped as he passed, and
said, ‘ good morning to you, Charles;
What are you doing there———Whose ‘horse
is that, and What have you inthe bask-
ets ’§’

11. ‘ There are oranges in the baskets,’
said Charles; ‘and a man who has just
gone to the inn there, to eat his breakfast,
bid me take care of them, and so I did;
because he said he would give me an
orange when he came back again.’

12. ‘ An orange,’ cried Edwin; ‘are you

to have one! However, let me lookhow
large they are.’ Saying this, Edwin went
towards the pannier, and lifted up the
cloth that covered it. ‘La! what ﬁne
oranges!’ he exclaimed, the moment he
saw them. ‘Let me touch them to feel
if they are ripe.’,

13. ‘No,’ said Charles, ‘you had better

eatthem. You should not meddle with
them; they are not yours, you must not
touch them.’ _

14. ‘Not touch them! Surely,’ said Ed-
win, ‘there is no harm in touching them.
You do not think I mean to steal them, I
suppose ‘I.’ ‘So Edwin put his hand into
the orange man’s basket, and he took up
a.n orange, and he felt it.

15. When he had felt it, he smelt it.
‘It is Very sweet, and it is very soft; I
long to taste it; I will only just suck one
drop of juice at the top.’ Saying these
words he put the orange to his mouth.

16. ‘Wl1a.t are you about, Edwin ‘I’
cried Charles, taking hold of his arm.
‘You said you only wanted to smell the

72 coBB’s

orange; do put it down, for shame.’
‘Do not saypfor shame to me,’ cried Edwin,
in a surly tone , ‘ the oranges are not yours,
Charles !’ t

17. ‘No, they are not mine: but I promis-»
ed to take care of them, and so I will;
so put down that orange l’

18. ‘Oh, if it comes to that, I will not,’
said Edwin, ‘and let us see who can make
me if I do not choose it; I am stronger
than you.’  

19. ‘I am not afraid of you for all that,’

replied Charles,’ for I am in the right}
Then he snatched the orange out of Ed;
 hand, and he pushed him with all
his force from the basket.
p 20. Edwin returned and hit him a Vio-
lent blow, which almost ‘stunned. him.
Still, however, this good boy, without
minding the pain, persisted in defend-
ing what was left in his care; he still held;
the l}'i”'l.{fil*3 with one  and covered the
basket with the ether arm, as well as he
could.  

21. Edwin struggled in vain to get his

hands into the pannier again; he could not; i

so he pretended to be out of, breath, and
to leave oﬂ" trying; but he meant as soon

as Charles looked‘ away, to creep soft-
ly rour'1‘d‘ to the basket, on the other
side.

22. Edwin, intent upon getting round to
steal the oranges, forgot, that if he Went
too close to the horse’s heels, he should
startle him.

23. The horse, indeed, disturbed by the
bustle near him, had left off eating his
ha.y, and began to put down his ears; but
when he felt something touch his hind
legs, he gave a sudden kick, a.nd Edwin
fell backwards, just as he had seizedthe
orange. .

24. Edwin screamed with the pain;
and at the scream all the people came out
of the publick house, to see what was
the matter, and among them came the
orange man.

25. Edwin was now so much ashamed,
that he almost forgot the pain, and WiSl1-

ed to run away ;‘ but he was so much

hurt, that he was obliged to sit down
again.

26.. The truth of the matter was soon
told by Charles, and as soon believed by

all the people present, who knew him ;.

for he had the character of being an hon-

7

74 coBB’s

est boy; and Edwin was known to be a
thief and a liar. ’

27. So nobody pitied Edwin for the
pain he felt. ‘He deserves it,’ says one.
“Whydid he meddle with What Was not
his own ‘.3’ said another. ‘ He is not much
hurt, I will answer for it,’ said at third.

28. Charles Was the only person Who
said nothing; he helped Edwin away to
a bank; ‘come here,’ said the orange man,
calling him; ‘ come here, my honest lad !
did you get that black eye in keeping my
oranges’! you are a good little boy,’ said
he, taking him by the hand, and leading
him into the midst of the people.

29. Men, Women, and children, had

gathered round, and all the children ﬁxed

their eyes upon Charles, and Wished to
be in his place. , J
30. 'I‘he orange man took Charles’ hat

off his head, and ﬁlled it with ﬁne oranges. ’

‘There, my little friend,’ said he, ‘take’
them, and God bless you With them ! If I
could but afford it, you should have all
that is in my basket.’

31. Then the people and all the
children shouted for joy; but as soon as
there was silence, Charles said to the

‘JUVENILE READER. 7 5

orange man, ‘ thankyou, Sir, but I can not
take your oranges, only that one I earned;
take the rest back again; I thank you
as much as if I had them.’ Saying these
Words, Charles offered to pour the oranges
back into the basket; but the man would
not let him.

32. ‘Then,’ said Char1es,~‘if they are
honestly mine, I may give them away;’
so he emptied the hat among the children
his companions. ‘Divide them, among
you,’ said he ; a.nd Without Waiting for
their thanks, he ran home. The children
ran after him, clapping their hands and
thanking him. .

33. The little thief came limping after.
Nobody praised E him; nobody thanked
him; he had no oranges to eat, nor had
he any to give away. .Edvvin Went home
crying, and saying to himself, fAll this
was «for one orange; it was not Worth
While.’   ’

34. No; it is never Worth While to do

‘Wrong. Children, when you read this,

think about it-——vvhich would you rather
have been, the honest boy or the thief ‘.1

THE WAY TO GET A LESSON.

1. One day in the summer time, Mr.
Dalben told little Henry Milner, at break-
fast,that if he would do all hislessons
before dinner, he should go to the mead-
ow, after dinner, and help the men make
hay. Henry heard this with great delight,
and the moment breakfast was ﬁnished,
set himself to do his lessons.

2. He had a copy to Write, and a sum to
do ; he had two lessons to learn in history,
his Bible to read, and his grammar lesson:
all these lessons he loved, excepting his
grammar. So he did those he liked best
first, and then said to his uncle, “May I
go, Sir, into the closet where I sleep, and
learn my grammar there '3”

3. Mr. Dalben gave his consent, and

Henry ran up stairs, shut the door, and

sitting down on a little stool, opposite the
Window, set liimselfto learn his lesson.
It was W arm, and the Window was open;
but there was nothing to be seen Where
Henry sat, through the Window, but the
tops of the tallest trees, and the distant
mountains.

ll. VVhile Henry Was saying these

‘Words, and Whilehe Was looking for his

place in his grammar, which had fallen to

'3flIé‘5ﬂ()O1” in his‘ haste to shut the Window,

he heard as kind oflittle nibbling, rattling
noise in the Wall. “Wl1at now 1” said
the littleeboy; gfyvlio is coming next '2”
He turned towards the place, and there
was a pretty little brown mouse, with
sparkling black eyes, peeping through a
hole in the old Wainscot. '

12. “There now,” said Henry, “there
is a new visiter come; Well, I am glad
the cat is not here, at any rate. Get
back, mouse, get back to your hiding
place; but I will not look at you, I will
learn; I am resolved to learn.” I

other corner of the room, and had just set-

thebutterﬂy may ﬂutter; and the hum-V

blebee may buzz; and the mouse may

I shall be able to learn my lesson.”
15. So little Henry, being filled with a
desire to do Well, ke t liooking at his

book, and repeating t e words with all

his might, till he was able to say his les-

son perfectly; and then he Went joyfully
down and said hislesson to his uncle;

and when he had said his lesson, he gave-

an account of all his Visiters.

16. ,After dinner, his uncle called him
to the door of a closet under the stair
case, and presented to him a nice strong lit-
tle rake, which he had made for him. The
little boy was now as happy as he could
be, following ‘his kind uncle through the
garden, with his little rake over his
shoulders, and asking, as he Went along,
how it ought to be used. -r“ You will see
other haymakers at work, Henry,” said Mr.
Dalben, “ and you must do as they do.”

  17. When they arrived in the ﬁeld,
Henry fell to Work with so much earnest-
ness, that in less than an hour he was quite

Henry. “ They will not want much at-
