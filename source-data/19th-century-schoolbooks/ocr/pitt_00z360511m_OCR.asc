.fPl’lere were, perhaps, in the American
army, officers who were more dashing than
Washington; but there was none that so
united all the qualities which make a great
captain.  He wassometimes defeated, as at
Long Islandand on the Brandywine. He
had often to retreat before the enemy, as in

New Jersey and in Pennsylvania. But he

made/the enemy pay dearly for any success.
4. Sometimes he would turn upon them
(as at Trenton, after his retreat behind the
Delaware), and deliver a stunning blow when
the enemy least expected it. His march on
Yorktown, afteroutwitting Clinton at New
York,»was a great stroke of generalship.

Boone. He Was born in North Carolina.
Being very fond of a wild, free life, Boone
left his home about sixiyears before the
American ‘Revolution began, and with a few
companions threaded his way to the "country
south of the Ohio River. »
B 3. Standing on the banlgs of that stream,
he looked abroad over a limitless landscape
of stream, wood, and hill. Over its face
roamed vast herds of buffalo. ' _ It was the
home of many tribes of savage, Indians; but
for these Boone was well prepared, being
himself a sort of Indian and amighty hunter.
He wore a cap of fur and the buckskin dress
of the red man, and was armed with hunt-
ing-knife and rifle, as you see him pictured
on the previous page. »
4. Boone had many daring adventures

and hair-breadth escapes among the savages,

He was several times captured, but always

got away. I-list companions were not so for-'

tunate, for three of them were killed by the
Indians and one was eaten by wolves; so

V BATTLE OF MURFREESBORO’.

22. This actionwas fought between an- A

other Union army of the West under General
Rosecrans and the Confederates under Bragg.
It was a very hard fight; and lasted three
days. The Union army held the battle-ﬁeld,
and hence it was a sort of victory ; but both
sides lost terribly; a S
23. You see, then, that the principal bat-
tles of the West, in 1862,were Fort Donel-
son, Shiloh, and Murfreesboro’.  

MCCLELLAN’S CAMPAIGN ON THE PENINSULA. e

24. In the East, the ﬁrst important event

of 1862 was the campaign on the r orktown  ‘

CAPTURE OF NEW ORLEANS.

31. One of the greatest events of the ward

was the capture of New Orleans. The Con-
federates had forts below New Orleans to
prevent the Union ships from going up and
attacking the city. Thus, by holding New
Orleans, the Confederates controlled the
navigation of the l\/lississippi River.

3. It was the most wonderful voyage ever

peopled the ocean with awful dangers. The
compass pointed wrong, and the men thought ,

that the tragle-winds, which carried the ships
swiftly westward, would prevent them from

In May, General Grant crossed the
Rapidan River and attacked the Con-

federates under Lee. The result was

the- battle of the Wilderness, which

was not decisive. Grant then, by
a series of “ﬂanking” movements,

forced his way down to the James

River. In the course of this march
several great battles were fought, as
Spottsylvania, North Anna, and
Cold Harbor. These were attended
with great loss of life to the Union
army. Grant then crossed the James
River and laid siege to Petersburg
and Richmond. ‘

ture, fanatical cruelty, wild superstition, and boundless

.2. No sooner had Columbus planted a colony in the .1

West Indies than crowds of adventurous spirits passed
over from Spain to America. They took possession of
all the West India Islands, and from there beganto
push off to the mainland. In this way the Spaniards
discovered and took possession of the Isthmus of Pana-
_ma, of the rich gold-land of Peru, of Yucatan, of 
andof Mexico. : _ J

  16. Smith had many adventures with the
Indians. In one of his expeditions he was

captured and carried before the chief, whose
name was Powhatan. , You remember the I

after the landing at Jamestown.

Washington as c.ornmander-in-chief of the
American army. Washington went to Cam-
bridge, near Boston, and there took command
of the forces, just two weeks after the battle
of Bunker Hill. The great elm under which
he took command is still standing. ‘

12. The American army was made up of
brave, patriotic men, who were determined

to ﬁght for their country. But they were

very green in War, and the army was very
poorly supplied with many things needed,
especially powder. Hence, Washington
thought it was best tobegin by teaching
them the art of war. Some people, wise in
their own conceit, said he ought to have
rushed right on the British in Boston; but
he knew.better. I   T

was fully shpvvn by the result. He hemmed

in the British so closely in Boston during -
A thewinter, that they came near starving.

Finally, the British commander, whose name

was General Howe, was forced to ask Wash- .
ington to let him evacuate Boston. ‘To this
