These letters are therefore called pure mutes. A less close
articulation admits a small prolongation of sound, as (2, cl,
g, as in the syllables, eb, ed, eg. These are called impure-
mutes. .

Imperfect articulations do not completely interrupt all
sound. Some of them admit a kind of hum ; others of a
hissing sound ; others of a breathing, which may be contin-
ued at pleasure. Of this kind are the following letters: ef,
el, em, en, er, es, ez, esh, eth. These are therefore called
semi-vowels.

  H is a mark of breathing, and may be called an aspirate.

Articulations or consonants precede or follow vowels, as
in at, go, blush. They therefore determine the manner of
beginning and ending vocal sounds. But even when they
produce no sound, they so modify the manner of uttering
vowels, as to aid in forming distinct words. Thus in bat,
gap, cap, we hear the "same vowel, but the articulations
which precede or follow that sound, form with it different
words, that may be distinguished as far as the voice can be
heard.

An articulate sound is properly a sound which is ‘pre-
ceded or followed by a closing of the organs ; but we extend
the signiﬁcation to sounds formed by organs capable of ar-
ticulation, that is, by the human organs of speech.

The great difference between men and brutes, in the ut-
terance of sound by the mouth, consists in the power of ar-
ticulation in man, and the entire want of it in brutes.

On articulation, therefore, depends the formation of sylla-
bles and words. It is the basis of human speech or lan-
guage, and the faculty of articulation is the distinguishing
characteristic and privilege of man.

All men, having similar organs of speech, use nearly the
same articulations. Hence the same simple letters, or let-
ters with the same powers, occur, with slight differences, in
all languages. The compound letters, or combinations of
sound, are subject to greater variety.

Articulations formed by the lips are called labial letters,
or labials, lip-letters, from the Latin labium, a lip. Such
are I), l, m, p, 19. Those formed by the tongue and teeth,
are called dental letters, or dentals, from the Latin dens, a
tooth. Such are d, t, th, s and z. The two latter are also
denominated sibilant letters, or sibilants, from the Latin
sibilo, to hiss. Letters formed by the tongue and palate, are

What will the hypercritic say to this sentence, “ Either sex and every
age was engaged in the pursuits of industry.”— Gib. Rom. Emp. ch. 10.

N ore 2.——-When names and pronouns belonging to different persons,
are thus joined, the plural pronoun must be of the ﬁrst person in pref-
erence to the second and third, and of the second in preference to the
third--I, on and he are represented by we; you and he, by you. Pope
in one of] his letters makes you or I to be represented by we or you.
“ Either you or I are not in love with the other.” The sentence is an
awkward one, and not to be imitated.

RULE VII.

  When an aﬂirmation or predicate refers to one subject
only among a number, which are separately named in the
singular number, the subjects are joined by the alternative
or or nor, with a verb, substitute and name in the singular
number; as, “Either John or Peter was at the Exchange
yesterday; but neither John nor Peter is there to-day.”

“Neither of them [Tillotson and Temple] are remarkable

Substitutes for sentences, whether they represent a single
clause, or the parts of a compound sentence, are always in
the singular number; as, “It is true indeed that many have
neglected opportunities of raising themselves to honor and
to wealth, and rejected the kindest offers of fortune.”--Ram
bler, No.58. Here it and that refer to the clauses which
follow-é“ It is true that, many have rejected the kindest of-
fers,” , c..

“It bein unavoidable in discourses differin ﬁ-om the
., 3 . . . ’ 3

ordinary received notions, either to make new words, or to
use old words in a new s«ign§ﬁcatz'0n.”--Locke, 2. 12. 14.

, Here it refers to the two alternative clauses which succeed.

RULE VIII.

Collective or aggregate names, comprehending two or
more individuals under a term in the singular number, have

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 99

a verb or pronoun to agree with them in the singular or plu-
ral; as, The council is or are unanimous; the company was
or were collected; this people, or these people.

No precise rule can be given to direct, in every case,
which number is to be used. Much regard is to be had to
usage, and to the unity or plurality of idea. In general,
modern practice inclines to the use of the plural verb and
pronoun; as may be seen in the daily use of clergy, nobil-
ity, court, council, commonalty, audience, enemy, and the
like. ‘

“The clergy began to Withdraw. themselves from the tem-
poral courts.”-——Blac7cstone’s Com. Introduction.

“ Let us take a view of the principal incidents attending
the nobility, exclusive of their capacity as hereditary coun-
selors of the crown.”-—Bl. Com. 1. 12.

“The commonalty are divided into several degrees.”
Ihm.

“The enemy were driven from their Works.”
Portuguese Asia, Jlliclcle, 163.

“The chorus prepare resistance at his first approach--the
chorus sings of the battle—--the chorus entertains the stage.”
Johnson’s Life of Jllilton.

“ The nobility are the pillars to support the throne.”
Bl. Com. 1. 2.

Party and army, in customary language», are joined with a
verb in the singular number. Constitution cannot be plu-
ral. Church may be singular or plural. Mankind is almost
always plural.

The most common and palpable mistakes in the applica-

tion of" this rule, occur in the use of sort and kind,with a .

plural. pronoun—-these sort, those kind; This fault infects the
Works of our best writers ; but these Words are strictly singu-
lar, and ought so to be used. ,
W‘hen a collective name is preceded by a deﬁnitive which
clearly limits the sense of the word to an aggregate with an
idea of unity, it requires a verb and pronoun to agree with
it in the singular number ;— as, a company of troops was de-
tached; a troop of’ cavalry was raised; this people is be-
come a great nation; that assembly was numerous; a “gov-
ernment established by that people.”--Bl. Com. 1. 2.

Yet our language seems to be averse to the use of it, as
the substitute for names even thus limited by a, this or that.
“ How long will that people provoke me,and how long will
it be ere they will believe me for all the signs that I have
shewed among them ?”-—--Nam. 14. 11. “ Liberty should

common nature.”-—-Spectator, No. 287. In these passages,
it, in the place of they, would not be relished by an English
ear; -nor is it ever used in similar cases.*‘

RULE IX.
When a nominative word in the singular number is followed
by adjuncts, having a noun in the plural number, the verb is to

he in_ the singular or plural number, according to the ideas

expressed by the nominative: if that conveys the idea of
plurality, the verb must be in the plural; otherwise, in the
singular. Thus in this sentence, “A part of the exports
consist of dry goods,” the word part seems to convey the
sense of plurality, or of many particulars, and the verb consist
is properly in the plural. So‘. also in this sentence : “ The
greater part of philosophers have acknowledged the excellence
of this gove”r"nmeut.”--—LocIce. Theword part can not be con-
sidered, as including one philosopher only, but many; hence
the verb is plural.

But in this sentence : “ Of which seeming equality we have
no other measure, but such as the train of our ideas have
lodged in our memories.”——Loclce. The word train seems
rather to require the verb in the singular. So in the following.
“The number of the names together were about a hundred
and tWenty..”-—-Acts, 1. 15. The word number expressing a.
sum of particulars, might well have the verb in the singular.
In the fcllovying sentence, there can be no question that the
verb ought to be in the singular... “ The ‘correctness of these
remarks is questionable.” Here correctness can not imply an
aggregate. of particulars.

N orrz.-Whengan aggregate amount is expressedby the plural names of
the artlculars composing that amount, the verb is/often in the singular
num er; as, ~“’Ther‘ewas more tharr:-a hundred andﬁfty thousand pounds
sterling.”-—M'a;:or’.s; Voyages, 1.

However repugnant to the principles. of grammar, this may seem at ﬁrst
view, the tactics is correct; for the afﬁrmation is notmade of the individual

parts or ivisions, named, the pounds, but of the entire sum or amount.
(See this subject more fully explained under rule XIV.)

“ “The Romans used axgreater latitude in joining plurals with collective names than
we can-—-“Magus pars in villis repleti cibo vtnoque.”-—Li'v. 2. 26. Here is a ronoun
plural of the masculine gender, agreeing with a noun in the singular, of t e femi-
nine gender.

or THE‘ ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 101

RULE X.

Pronouns or substitutes must agree with the names they
represent, in number, gender and person; as,

“ Mine answer to them that do examine me is this.”
1 Cor. 9. 3.

“ These are not the children of God.”——Rom. 9. 8.

“ Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, when ye
come into the land whither I bring 3/ou.”——Num. 15. 18.

“ This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on
his inheritance.”—-Matt. 21. 38.

“Esther put on her royal apparel——-she obtained: favor in
his sight--then the king said unto her.”——Esth. 5.

“A river went out of Eden to water the garden, and it was
parted.”——Gen. 2. 10.

“The woman whom thou gavest to the with me.”
i Gen. 3. 12.

“Qnatius, who was bishop of Antioch, conversed‘ with the
apostles.”-——Paley’s Evid. Sect. 3. I

“A letter, which is just received, gives us the news.”
“O thou who rulest in the heavens.”

Who and whom are exclusively the substitutes for per-
sons; whose is of all genders, and as correctly applied to
things as to persons.

“ The question whose solution I require.”-.-Dryden.
“That forbidden fruit whose mortal taste.”-—-Zllilton-.
“A system whose imagined suns.”--—Goldsmith-.

“These are the charming agonies of love
I/Vhose miseries deIight.”—- Thom.

It, though neuter, is used as the substitute for infant or

disregarded. 1

Formerly, which was used as a substitute for persons; as
appears from old authors, and especially in the vulgar ver-
sion of the scriptures»-—-“ mighty men which were of old.”
But this use of the word is entirely discarded. It/Vhich how-
ever represents persons, when a question is asked or dis-
crimination intended; as, which of the men was: it; I know
not which person it was.

T/Vho is sometimes used as the substitute for‘ things, But’
most unwarrantably: “The countries who.”-——Dcwenant ow
Rev. 2. 13. “ The towns who.”—--I:Iume, Contin. ll.ch. 10,
“ The faction or party who.”-——E“’qua1ly faulty is the use of ‘
who and whom for brutes : “ The birds who-—-”

The use of it for a sentence, seems to have given rise to
a very vague application of the word in phrases like this:
How shall I contrive it to attend court '9' How fares it with
you ? But such phrases, whatever may have given rise to
them,. are used chieﬂy in familiar colloquial language, and‘
are deemed inelegant in any other style.

A more justifiable use of it is seen in this sentence: “ But
it is not this real essence that distinguishes them into species ;.
it is men who range them into sorts,” &Lc‘..—-Locke, 3. 6. 36.

Here it is in the singular, though referring to men in the
plural. The cause or origin of this, in our language as in
others, may perhaps be found in the disposition of the mind
to combine the particular agents employed‘ in performing an
act, into asingle agent. The unity of the act or cfect seems
to predominate in idea, and control‘ the gramrnatical construc-
tion of the substitute.

RULE XI.

In compound sentences, a single substitute, who, which or‘
that, employed to introduce a new clause, is the nominative
to the verb or verbs belonging to that clause, and to others
connected with it; as, “ The thirst after" curiosities, which
often draws contempt.”-—-Rambler, No. 83. “ He who suf-
fers not his faculties to lie torpid has a chance of doing
good.”—--~Ib‘m.a “ They that are after‘ the ﬂesh, do mind the
things of the ﬂesh.”---Rom. 8. 5. “ Among those who are

the most richly endowed by nature, and [are] accomplished’

by their own industry,’ how few are there whose virtues are
‘r/obscured by the ignorance, prejudice or envy of their
behofders I”--—Spcc. No. 255.

In a few instances, the substitute for a sentence or a clause, ,

is introduced as the nominative to a verb before the sentence
or clause, which it represents; as, “i There was therefore,
which is all that we assert, a course of ’ life pursued by them,
different from that which they before ledl.”--Paley, Evid.
ch. 1. gHe‘re which is the representative of the whole of the
last part of the sentence, and its natural position is after that
ause.

or THE» ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 103

The substitute what combines in itself" the offices of two
substitutes, which, if expressed, would be the nominatives to
two verbs, each in distinct subsequent clauses; as, “ Addto
this, what, from its antiquity is but little known, has the rec-
ommendation of novelty.”-—-—IIermes, pref. 19. Here what
stands for that, which--and the two following verbs have no
other nominative. ' i

This use of what is not very common. But what is very
frequently used as the representative of two cases——~one, the
objective after a verb or preposition, and the other, the nom-
inative to a subsequent verb. Examples:

“ I heard what was said.” “ He related what was seen.”
“ We do not so constantly love what has done us good.”
Locke, 2. 20. 14.
“ Agreeable to what was afterwards directed.”
Bl. Cam. I). 2. ch. 3.
“ Agreeable to what hath been mentioned.”
7 Prideamz, p. 2, 6, 3.

“ There is something so overruling in whatever inspires
us with awe.”-—--Burke on the Sublime, 304. In these sen-
tences what includes an object after a verb or preposition,
and a nominative to the following verb. “ I have heard that,
which was said.”

RULE XII.

When a new clause is introduced into a sentence with two

pronouns, or with one pronoun and a name, one of them is

the nominative to the verb, and the other is governed by the
verb or a preposition 1n the objective case, or by a noun in
the possessive; as, “ Locke, whom there is no reason to

suspect of favoring idleness, has advanced.”-——Raimb,. 
Here reason is the nominative to is, and whom 18 governed

by suspect.

“ Take thy only son Isaac, whom thou lovest.”---G‘en. 22.
Here are two. substitutes, one the nominative to the verb,
and the other governed by it in the objective.

“ God is the Sovereign of the universe, whose majesty
ought to ﬁll us with awe,to whom we owe all possible rever-
ence, and whom we are bound to obey.”

_It is not unusual to see in periods, a third clause introduced
within a second, as a second is within the ﬁrst, each with

I04 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

a distinct substitute for a. nominative ; as, “ Those modiﬁca-
tions of any simple idea, which, as has been said, I call sim-
ple modes, are distinct ideas.”--Locke, 2. 13.

Involution to this extent may be used with caution, with-
out embarrassing a period; but beyond this, if ever used, it
can hardly fail to occasion obscurity. Indeed the third mem-
ber included in a second, must be very short, or it will per-
plex the reader. I

Substitutes are sometimes made to precede their princi-
pals; thus, “When a man declares in autumn, when he is
eating them, or in spring, when there are none, that he loves
grapes.”-—Loclce, 2. 20. But this arrangement is usually
awkward and seldom allowable.

RULE XIII.

When there are antecedents in different persons, to which
a nominative pronoun refers, the pronoun and‘ verb follow-
ing may agree with either, though usage may sometimes
offer a preference; as,“ I am the Lord that make all things;
that stretchforth the heavens alone ; that spread abroad the
earth,” &c.---Isa. 44. Here I and Lord are of different per-
sons, and that may agree with either. If it agrees with I,
the verbs must be in the ﬁrst person; “ I am the Lord that
make.” If that agrees with Lord in the third person, the
verb must be in the third person; “I am the Lord that
maketh.” But in all cases the following verbs -‘should all be
of the same person.

RULE XIV.

The deﬁnitive adj,ectives, this and that, the only attributes
which are varied to express number, must agree in number
with the nam.es to. which they refer; as, this city, that church;
these cities, those churches.

This and that are often used as substitutes for a name in
the singular number, which is omitted’; but the same name
in the plural immediately follows after a connective; as in
this example, “ The mortality produced by this and other
diseases.”-——Lzfe of Washington, 3, 6. That is, by this dis-
ease and, other diseases. The sentence may be varied thus——-
by this disease and others--but the ﬁrst form is the most com-
mon, and it occasions no obscurity.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 105

Other adjectives and participles, used as adjectives, are
joined to the names which they qualify without inflection;
as, a wise man, wise men; an amiable child, or amiable chil-
dren; a received truth, or received truths ; a shining‘ charac-
ter, or shining characters.

Adjectives are often used as substitutes for the names of
men and things which they describe by their qualities; ‘as,
few were present; the wise are respected; the bravest are
not always victorious.

In this character, attributes take aplural form, and are
qualiﬁed by other attributes; as, the goods of fortune, two
jinites or inﬁnites, universals, generals-—the chief good, a
happy few ; “the extraordinary great.”-—-Burlce on the Sub-
lime, 304. “ The blue profound.”--Akenside.

When nouns are joined by a copulative, an adjective pre-
ceding the ﬁrst, is applied to theothers Without being repeat-
ed ; as, “ From great luxury and licentiousness”———here great
belongs to licentiousness as well as to luxury. “ Converted
to strict sobriety and frugality of manners.”-—En_ﬁeld.

When a period of time is described by its component parts
or portions, speciﬁed by plural names, an attribute in the sin--
gular number, or denoting unity, is often joined to the plural

names of the parts; as, “ I have not been to London this ﬁve‘

years ;” “an election regularly takes place every seven
years ;” that is, in every single period or term of seven
years.  
This idiom is explainable on very natural principles. The
whole portion of time has no name, and we are therefore
obliged to express our idea of it by something equivalent,
which, in this instance, are the parts jive and seven years.
The mind is ﬁxed upon the entire period, and while the lips
utter the name of the parts, the mind naturally considers the
whole as a unity, and overlooking the several portions, at-
taches the attribute to that unity or whole period. Hence
originated the customary abbreviation of twelve months, into
a twelvemonth ; seven nights into se’night; fourteen nights
into a fortnight; and hence dozen, hundred, Sec. admit the
deﬁnitive a. .
To the same cause probably may be ascribed the common
phrases, twenty pound, thirty foot, and others similar; in
which a whole quantity or space, for which We have no ap-
propriate name, is described by smaller portions equivalent.

The idea of unity, in all such cases, being predominant, and

106 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

the only one which the speaker wishes to communicate, is
very apt to control the language, and occasion the omission
of the sign of the plural even when it is necessary to the
very purpose intended.

Hence we learn the cause why enumeration and addition
of numbers are usually expressed in the singular number;
two and two is four; seven and nine is sixteen; that is, the
sum of seven and nine is sixteen. But modern usage in-
clines tg,reject the use of the verb in the singular number,
in these and similar phrases.

RULE XV.

Adjectives are usually placed before the nouns to which
they belong ; as, a wise prince ; an obedient subject; a pious
clergyman, a brave soldier.

Exception 1. When some word or words are dependent
on an attribute, it follows the name; as, knowledge requi-
site for a statesman ; furniture convenient for a family.

Exception 2. When an attribute becomes a title, or is
emphatically applied to a name, it follows it; as, Charles, the
Great; Henry, the First; Lewis, the Gross; Wisdom in-
comprehensible. t

Eizception 3. Several attributes belonging to the same
name, may precede or follow the name to which they be-
long; as, a learned, wise and martial prince, or a prince
learned, wise and martial.

Exception 4. The verb be often separates the name from
its attribute ; as, war is expensive; gaming is ruinous.

Exception 5. An emphatical attribute is often used to in-

troduce a sentence,.in which case it precedes the name which

it qualiﬁes, and sometimes at a considerable distance; as,
“Great is the Lord ;” auspicious will be that event; fortu-
nate is that young man who escapes the snares of vice.

Exception 6. The attribute all may be separated from its
noun by the, which never precedes it in construction; as,
“ all the nations of Europe.” Such and many are separated
from names by a; as, “ such a character is rare ;” “many a
time.”

All adjectives are separated from names by a when pre-
ceded by so and as——so rich a dress---as splendid a retinue;

and they are separated by a or the, when preceded by Item

and however; as, “ how distinguished an act of bravery,”--
“ how brilliant the prize.” “ However just the complaint ;”
and by too; as, too costly a sacriﬁce.

The word soeverimay be interposed between the attribute
and the name; “ how clear soever this idea of inﬁnity”--
“ how remote soever it may seem.”——L0eke. .

Double is separated from its noun by the; as “ double the
distance,”—--the, in such cases, never preceding double. But
a precedes double, as well as other attributes.

All and singular or every precede the before the name
in these phrases. “ All and singular the articles, clauses and
conditions.” “ All and every. of the articles”-phrases of
the law style.

RULE XVI.

Adjectives belong to verbs in the inﬁnitive mode ; as, “to
see is pleasant,”---“ to ride is more agreeable than to walk ;”
“ to calumniate is detestable.”

Sometimes the attribute belongs to the inﬁnitive in union
with another attribute or a name; as, “ to be blind is unfor-
tunateg” “to be a coward is disgraceful.” Here the attri-
bute unfortunate is the attribute of the first clause, to be
blind, &c.

RULE XVII.

Adjectives belong to sentences, or whole propositions:
Examples :  

“Agreeable to this, we read of names being blotted out
of God’s boolc.”-—-Burder’s Oriental Customs, 375.

What is agreeable to this! The answer is found in the
whole of the last clause of the sentence.

“ Antiochus—to verify the character prophetically given
of him by Daniel-—aeted the part of a vile and most detesta-
ble person, agreeable to what hath been aforementioned of
him.”-—Prideau:c, part 2, b. 3.

“ Her majesty signiﬁed her pleasure to the admiral that
as soon as he had left a squadron for Dunkirk, agreeable to
what he had proposed, he should proceed with the ﬂeet.”--—
Burchet, Nav. Hist. 439.

“Independent of his person, his nobility, his dignity,’hi3
relations and friends may be urged,” &c.-—-Guthrie’s Quinc-
tilian.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 9

called palatal letters, or palatals, as   g, 7:, Z, r. The two
former, when they represent a deep utterance of sound from
the throat, may be called gutturals.

When an articulation occasions a sound through the nose,
it is called anasal letter. Such are m, n, and ng, in -ing.

J, in English, represents the sounds of d and soft g. X
represents the sound of It and s.

A diphthong is the union of two vowels, which are so ra-
pidly uttered in succession, as to be considered as forming
one syllable, as oi, and oy, in voz'ce,joy.

A triphthong is the union of three vowels in a syllable.

ETYMOLOGY.--CLASSIFICATION OF WORDS.

Words are naturally divided into two CLASSES, PRIMARY
and SECONDARY.
iThe ﬁrst class consists of words which are essential to
the language of men; on which other words depend, or to
which they are added as auxiliaries. In this class are in-
cluded the Noun or Name, and the verb. These two spe-
cies of words are so necessary to a communication of ideas,
that no complete sentence or proposition can be formed
without the use of both, unless when a substitute is used for
a name. Thus, the sun shines, is a complete sentence, con-
taining a name and a verb; but remove either of them, and
the proposition is destroyed. From the importance of these
words, they are here denominated Primary, or the PRIMARY
PARTS 01+‘ SPEECH. T
The second class consists of words of secondary or subor-
dinate use, or of such as are dependent on other wprds in
construction. Of these there are several species.
lst. Words which supply the place of other words and of
sentences, which are here called pronouns or substitutes.
2d. Words which express the qualities of things, and
which therefore are attached to the names of those things.
These are here called actjectives, attributes or attributives.
These are ‘primary words in point of importance; but be-
ing necessarily dependent on other words in construction,
they are here ranked with the secondary.
3d. Words which modify the sense of other words by ex-
pressing the manner of action, or degree of quality. These
are here called adverbs or mode’ ers.

No'rE.—--Writers and critics, misapprehending the true construction
of these and similar sentences, have supposed the attribute to belong to
the verb, denoting the manner of action. But a little attention to the
sense of such passages will be suﬂicie-nt to detect the mistake. For in-
stance, in the example from Enﬁeld, the attribute contrary cannot qual~
ify the verb adopted ; for the conquerors did not adopt the opinions of
the» conquered in a manner contrar to what usually happens——the
manner of the act is_ not the thing a rmed, nor does it come into con-
sideration. The sense is this, the fact, that the conquerors adopted the
opinions and manners of the conquered, was contrary to what com~
monly happens in like" cases. The attribute‘ belongs to the whole sen-

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 109

In consequence of‘ not attending to this construction, our hypercritics,
who are very apt to distrust popular practice, and substitute their own
rules for customary idioms, founded on common sense, have condemned
this use of the attribute, and authors, suffering themselves to be led
astray by these rules, often use an adverb in the place of an adjective.

“ The greater part of philosophers have acknowledged the excellence
of this government, which they have considered, some relatively to
society, and others as it,has‘ relation to the general system of nature.’
ﬂnach. ch. 62. -

“The perceptions are exalted into a source of exquisite pleasure in-
dependently of every particular relation of interest.”
I Studies of Nature, 12.

In the ﬁrst of these examples, relatively is used very awkwardly for
as relative, or as relating, or as it relates, or in relation; for the word
has a direct reference to government.

In the second example, independently is used as if it had been in-
tended to modify the verb exalt--—the perceptions are independently cz-
alted. But the manner of exalting is not the thing described. It is
not that the perceptions are exalted in an independent manner, nor in a
manner independent of a relation to interest: but the fact, that the per-
C?tl0nS are exalted into a source of errquisite pleasure, is independent
0 every relation of interest. Equally faulty is the following sentence :

“ ﬂgreeably to this law, children are bound to support their parents.”
Pale? , Phil.

Johnson, in his life of Thomson, has this sentence——“ Why the dedica-
tions are to winter and the other seasons, contrarily to custom, left out
in the collected works, the reader may imagine.” It is strange that a
man of this author’s discernment should not perceive that it was not the
manner of leaving out, which he was stating, but the fact——-The dedica-
tions to winter and other seasons are left out, which fact or thing is con-
trary to custom.* I do not recollect this use of contrary in any other
passage; though it is certainly as vindicable as the use of any other
modiﬁer under like circumstances; for in ever case it entirely perverts
the sense of the passage. In this instance, t e use of the adverb in-

stead of the attribute, may have been an oversight. .

In this kind of phrase, I have even seen an instance of the participle
according converted into accordingly. See this word explained in the
sequel. I have not seen Priorly used for prior, in like ‘sentences-—
“ Priorly to his arrival in England”——N or anteriorly, posteriorly,
eztteriorly, inferiorly, n-or adjacently or contiguously to the river‘ ;
and the like barbarisms; but subsequently, anteeedently, consistently,
corjormably, are frequent in our best authors. “ To do what we will,
consistently with the interests of the community, is civil liberty.” Pa-
ley, Phil. 6. 5. This is not English; for it is not the manner of doing,
but the thing done, _ which must be consistent with the public interest.
A misapprehension of the true import and construction of such passages,
has done immense mischief to the language.

* The idiom in question has resulted from that disposition to abridge
the number of words used imcommunicating ideas, which I have re-
peatedly mentioned; the effects of which are among the prime excel-

encies of every language.

In the plane of this awkward phrase, in which an adverb is made to
precede to, Iwould use a noun with a preposition. Instead of“ In con-
eidering sound relatively to its external cause”——I would use in relation
..J‘ In considering sound in relation to its external cause.” “ This was
one in conformity with,” not eonformably to. He could not in consis-
tency with not consistently with. In agreement or accordance with;
not agreealrly to. V

These forms of expressions are genuine and more elegant and correct
English; but in most instances, the adjectives, relative, conformable,
consistent, agreeable, referring to a clause in the sentence, would be
equally correct. ~

RULE XVIII.

Adjectives are used to modify the action of verbs, and to
express the qualities of things in connection with the action
by which they are produced. Examples :

“ Open thine hand ‘wide.--—-Dent. 15. 17.

We observe in this passage, that wide, the attribute of
hand, has a connection with the verb open; for it is not
“ open thy wide hand ;” but the attribute is supposed to be
the efect of the act of opening. Nor can the modiﬁer,

widely, be used; for it is not simply the manner of the act
which is intended; but the efeet.

‘‘ Let us write slow and e:tact.”—-Guthrie, Quinct. 2. 375.

We might perhaps substitute slowly for slow, as describ-
ing only the manner of writing; but exactly cannot be

substituted for exact; for this word is intended to denote

the efect of writing, in the correctness of what is written.
The attribute expresses the idea with a happy precision and
brevity.

As this is one of the most common, as well as most
beautiful idioms of our language, which has hitherto escaped
due observation, the following authorities are subjoined to
illustrate and justify the rule. 4

“We could hear distinctly the bells-——-which sounded
sweetly soft and pensive.”-—-C'handler’s Travels, ch. 2.

“ He obliged the Nile to run bloody for your sakes.”*--

“ Correct the heart and all will go rz'glzt.”--Porteus,
Leet. 3. y

The poets sometimes use adjectives in this manner, when
modiﬁers would express the idea. Sometimes they are in-
duced to it by the measure; and not unfrequently by the
obvious superiority of the attribute in expressing the idea
with force and precision.

When two qualifying words are wanted, the latter may
be an adjective, though applied to a verb ; as, “ He beat time
tolerably e:I:act.”—-Golds. An. 1Vat. ch. 12.

“ The air will be found diminished in weight exactly equal
to what the iron has gained.”-——Lav0z'sier, ch. 3.

“ Horses are sold extremely dear.”-—-Golds.

“ And greatlyiindependent lived.’ ’-—- Tlwm. Spring.

“This was applying a just principle very z'll.”——Vattel.
Trans. 2. '7. T

It will be remarked that we have no adverbial form of the
attribute in the comparative and superlative degreesyexcept
that of more and most, less and least, preﬁxed. But we use
the adjectives with the regular terminations, in these degrees,
to qualify verbs. Examples 2--

“ To hands that longer shall the weapon wield.”

“ Her smiles, amid the blushes, lovelier show;

Amid her smiles, her blushes lovelier glow.”
.H00le. Tasso. b. 15. -

Authors, misguided by Latin rules, and conceiving that
every word which is used to qualify a verb, must be an ad-
verb, have pronounced many of the passages here recited
and similar ones to be incorrect———and in such as are too well
established to bear censure, they call the adjective an ad-
verb. Were it not for this inﬂuence in early education,
which impresses a notion that all languages. must be formed
with the like idioms, we should never have received an idea.
that the same word may not modify a noun, an adjective and
a verb.

So far are the Words here used from being adverbs, that
they cannot be changed into adverbs, without impairing the
beauty, weakening the force or destroying the meaning of
the passages. Let the sentences be put to the test—-Magne-
sia feels smoothly-—the cakes eat shortly and crisply--the
apples boil softly or hardly—-glows not her blush the more
fairly. Every English ear rejects this alteration at once--A-the
sentences become nonsense. Nor can the attribute be sep-
arated from the verb--“Amid her smiles, her blushes, be-
ing lovelier, glovv”—-this is not the sense—-nor will it an-
swer to say, “her lovelier blushes glow”—-this is not the
idea. The sense is, that the attribute expressed by lovelier,
is not only a quality of blushes, but a quality derived, in a
degree, from the action of the verb, glow;

Thus, clay burns white---objects may be seen double-~

* In remarkin upon such phrases as “The vices which enter deeper
or deepest into t e soul,” Murray says, deeper and deepest should be
more deeply, most deeply. It is recommended to change the adjective

is pronounced shortly”--“ The next should be pronoﬂnmiii much more
highly!” This alteration will put his rule to the test

fat, or lean-—~one may speak loud--the sun shines clear-—
the ﬁner a substance is pulverized—to grow wiser, to plunge
deeper, spread wider--and similar expressions without num-
ber, constitute a well established idiom, as common as it is
elegant.*

The attributes thus ‘connected with verbs may easily be
distinguished from those which merely qualify names, the
latter being separable from theverb. Thus,

  “ Our great enemy

All uncorruptible, would, on his throne,

Sit unpolluted.” Milton, P. L. 2

Here unpolluted has no effect at all upon the verb; but
may be separated from it, and carried into the ﬁrst line with-
out altering the sense. «

“ And the birds sing concealed.” Thomson.

‘-‘ He roved uncertain through the dusky shade.”--—Hoolc..

RULE XIX.

Some adjectives are used to modify the sense of others
and of participles; as a very clear day, red hot iron, 3. more
or most excellent character. “Without coming any near-
er.”---Locke; more pressing necessity, mast grating sound’,
“ a closer grained wood.”——-—Lavo'isz'er. Trans. A

“ Full many a gem with purest ray serene.’ ’—-Gray.
“Some deemed him wondrous Wise.”-—Beattz'e’s Minstrel.

W* The Roman writers hvailied themselves of the same idiom.--“ Ob
multitudinem familiarum, qure gliscebat immcnsum.”
Tacitus. ﬁn. lib. 4. 2'7.

‘-‘ Fabius-—-Arpos primum institit oppugnare-—quaa maxime neglectam
custodiam vidit, ea potissimum adgredi statuit.”-—-Liv. lib. 24. 46.

How much more impressive is the description which Tacitus here
gives of an alarming insurrection of slaves, than if he had used the, ad-
verb ! “ A multitude of slaves which was increasing and growing im-
mense !” this is giving to prose the rhetorical sublimity of verse. It is

iving the verb its ful effect, and at the same time, attaching the attri-
ute to that effect.

In the word potissimum, in Livy, as in many others, we see the effect
of ngt understanding this gleglant up; of at1;.:°1i:1J1'1It‘esl.1 Sﬁlcll wotiida‘ are
mar ed in dictionaries as a ver s . ow wo u y ivy an aci-
tus smile to see their native tongue, disﬁgured with aiscents to distin-

ish adverbs from adjectives, in a modern dictionary of the language-!

t is a just remark of Mr. Tooke, that all words which critics have not
understood, they have thrown into the common sink of adverbs.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 115

In these expressions the last attribute belongs more im-
mediately to the noun expressing its quality—and the jirst
attribute qualiﬁes the second.

Not unfrequently two attributes are used to modify a
third, or the principal one; as, “The manner in which ex-
ternal force acts upon the body is very little subject to the
will.”-——Rambler, No. '78.

RULE XX.

Adjectives are used to qualify the sense of adverbs; as, a
city was very bravely defended; the soldiers were most am-
ply rewarded; a donation more beneﬁcially bestowed; a
house less elegantly furnished; a man the least peaceably
disposed.

In, these phrases, the modiﬁer attends the verb or partici-
ple to mark the manner or character of the act or affirma-
tion; and the attribute attends the modiﬁer to mark the de-
gree or extent of that manner of character.

For a like purpose of deﬁning the degrees of quality and
modification, We make great use of much before attributes
of the comparative and superlative degrees; as, a prince
much more humanely disposed; or much less martially in-
clined.

We have a few other words which are often used to mod-
ify attributes as well as verbs-—as, a little, a great deal, a
triﬂe. “Many letters from persons of the best sense——d0
not a little encourage me.”-Spectator, 124. “It is a great
deal better;” “ a triﬂe stronger ;” the last of which expres-
sions is colloquial.

RULE XXI.

The adjectives each, every, either and neithc—r,. have verbs
and substitutes agreeing with them in the singular number;
as:

“ Each one was a head of the house of his fathers.”
Josh. 22. 14.

“ Every one that ﬁndeth me, shall slay me.”-Gen. 4. 14.
“ And take every man his censer.”—--Num. lb. 17.

“ Nadab and Abihu took either of them his censer.”
Lev. 10. 1.

“ Neither of the ways of separation, real or mental, is com-
patible to pure space.”——-Loclce, 2. 13.

Errors.—-—“ Let each esteem others better than them-
selves.” ' It ought to be himself.

“ There are bodies, each of which are so small.” It ought
to be is.—-—Locke, 2. 8.

NOTE.-—-A plural verb, which aﬁirms something of a number of par-
ticulars, is often followed by a distributive which assigns the aﬁirmation
to the particular objects or individuals. Thus, “ If metals have, each a.
peculiar earth”—-Hence We ma consider each as the nominative to has
understood——“ If metals have, i each metal has a peculiar earth.” There
is no other way of resolving the phrase. This manner of expression is
common, though quite useless—-—~as the last clause, “ if each metal has”
-—-is suﬂicient. It has not the merit of an abbreviation. This phrase,
“ Let us love one another,” is of a similar construction, but it is not
easy to ﬁnd a substitute of equal brevity.

RULE XXII.

Names of measure or dimension stand without a govern-
ing word, followed by an adjective; as, “a wall seven feet
high and two feet thick”--“a carpet six yards wide”---“ a
line sixty fathoms long”-—-“ a kingdom ﬁve hundred miles
square”-——“ water ten feet deep.”

“ An army forty thousand strong,” is a similar phrase.

Norris.--—Double comparatives and superlatives, most straitest, most
highest, bein improper and useless, are not to be used. The few which
were former y used are obsolete. Worser, a mistake in spelling wyrsa,
is obsolete ; but lesser, a mistake forlessa, is still used, as well as its ab-
breviation, less. We never say, the less Asia, but lesser.

The superlative form of certain adjectives, which, in the positive de-

ree, contain the utmost degree of the quality, as ezctremest, ehiefest, is
improper and obsolete. But authors indulge in a most unwarrantabe
license of annexing comparison to attributes whose negative sense pre-
cludes increase or diminution; as in these sentences, “ These are more
formidable and more impassable than the mountains.”—- Golds. ﬁn. Nat.
ch. 2. “‘ This diﬂiculty was rendered still more insurmountable by the

licentious spirit of our young men.”-—-.Murphy, Tacit. Orat. 35. “The

contradictions of impiety are still more incomprehensible."--Jlfassilltm,
Serm. to the Great.

Similar to these are numerous expressions found in good authors-
more impossible, more indispensable, less universal, more uncontrollable ;
and others, in which the sign of comparison is not only improper,
but it rather enfeebles the epithet; for the word itself‘ expressing the full
extent of the idea, ought to bear some emphasis, which, if a qualifying
word is preﬁxed, will naturally be transferred to that word.*

‘* This effect may proceed also from another consideration. If the at-
tributes-lone is used, its sense precludes the idea. of increase or diminu-

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 117

In a few instances, this usage seems to be too well established to be
altered, and particularly in the use of more and most, less and least per-
fect. In general, it would indicate more precision of thought to apply
a term of diminution to the aﬁirmative attribute—less possible, less sur-
mountable, less controllable ; rather than a term of increase to a negative
attrioute.

N on: 2.-—In English, two names are frequently united to form a new
name; as, earth-worm, drill-plow, ink-stand, book-case. In some cases,
these compounds are by custom effectually blended into one term; in
other cases, they are separated into their component parts by a hyphen;
in other cases, words are united, and the ﬁrst term forms a sort of occa-
sional attribute to the second ; as, family-use or family-consumption.

NOTE 3.—From a disposition to abridge the number of words in dis-
course, we find many expressions which are not reducible to any pre-
cise rule, formed at ﬁrst by accident or ellipsis; such are at ﬁrst, at last,
at best, at worst, at most, at least, at farthest, at the utmost. In these
expressions there may have been an ellipsis of some name ; but they are
well established, brief and signiﬁcant.

Norm 4.—We have certain attributes which follow a verb, and a name
to which they belong, but never precede the noun. Such are adry,
a eared, afraid, alone, alike, aware, akin, alive, asleep, awake, athirst,
aloft, aghast, aﬂoat, ashew, -ashamed, pursuant, plenty, worth; to
which may be ‘added amiss, aground, ashore, aside, and a. few others
which may be used as attributes or modiﬁers. We say, one is adry,
ashamed, alive or awake. But never an adry person, an ashamed child,
&c. We say,“ A proclamation was issued pursuant to advice of coun-
cil.” But we can in no case place pursuant before the noun.

Plenty, as an attribute, has not yet been recognized by critics; but‘

critics do not make language, nor can they reject what a nation has
made. Plenty is constantly used as an adjective after a name in collo-
quial language, and is. found in our best writers ; to cavil at this usage,
therefore, is as idle as it is impertinent.

“The sea muscle is perhaps the most plenty.”-—Golds. ﬂn. Nature.
“ Where shrubs are plenty and water scarce.”—-Ibm. 2. 21.

“In those provinces where wood was plenty.”
Rycaut Garcillaso, 923.

“ This species is more plenty in France.”--i—Encyc., ﬂrt. Loxia.
“ Provisions are plenty and living cheap.”—-Ibm., ﬂrt. ﬂdrianople.

Worth not only follows the name which it qualiﬁes, but is followed by

a name denoting price or value ; as, a book worth a dollar or a guinea-—
it is well worth the money—“ It is worth observation.”-—-Beloe’s Herodo-
tus, Erato, 98. lfa substitute is used after worth, it must be in the
ob'ective case. It is worth them or it. ' .
ut worthy, the derivative of worth, follows the usual construction

of attributes, and may precede the name it qualifies; as, a worthy man.

There are therefore two classes of words containing seven

IV. Adjectives or Attributes, which express the qualities
of things, and qualify the action of verbs, or the sense of
other attributes and modiﬁers.

V. Adverbs or Modiﬁers, which qualify the action of

and also the condition of things.

VII. Connectives or Conjunctions, which unite sentences
in construction.

tinct part of s eech; and they certainly have some claims to be so con-
sidered; but have chose to‘ follow the common arrangement which is
attended with no inconvenience.

NOUNS ‘OR NAMES.

A noun or name is that by which a thing is called; and
it expresses the idea of that which exists, material or imma-
terial.---Of material substances, as man, horse, tree, table——
of immaterial things, as faith, hope, love. These and simi-
lar words are, by customary use, lmfade the names of things
which exist, or the symbols of ideas, which they express
without the help of any other word.

118   AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

RULE XXIII.

One name signifying the same thing with another, or de-
scriptive of it, may be in apposition to it; that is, may stand
in a like character or case, without an intervening verb; as,
Paul, the apostle; John, the baptist; Newton, the philoso-
pher; Chatham, the orator and statesman.

N on 1.-—-In the following sentence, a name in the plural stands in
apposition to two names in the singular, joined by an alternative. “ The
terms of our law will hardly ﬁnd words that answer them in the Spanish
or Italian, no scanty languages.”-—Loeke, 3. 5. 8.

N on: 2.—-Names are not unfrequently set in apposition to sentences;
as,“ Wherebfif a man had a positive idea of inﬁnite, either duration or
space, he could add two inﬁnites together; nay, make one inﬁnite inﬁ-
nitely bigger than another; absurdities too gross to be confuted.”---
Locke, 2. 17. 20. Here the absurdities are the whole preceding propo-
sitions.

“ You are too humane and considerate; things few people can be
charged with.”——P0pe, Let. Here things are in apposition to humane
andeonsiderate. Such a construction may be justified, when the ideas
are correct, but it is not very uncommon.

“ The Dutch were formerly in possession of the coasting trade and
freight of almost all other trading nations; they were also the bankers
for all Europe; advantages by which they have gained immense sums.”
Zimmerman’s Survey, 170. Here advantages is put in apposition to the
two first members of the sentence. ‘

RULE XXIV.

When two names are used, one denoting the possessor,
the other the thing possessed, the name of the possessor pre-
cedes the other In the possessive case; as, “In my Father’s
house are many mansions.” l_\/Ien’s bravery; ‘England’s
ﬂeet; a Chr1st1an’s hope; Wash1ngton’s prudence.

N OTE 1.—-When the thing possessed is obvious, it is usual to omit the
name; as, “Let us go to St. Paul’s,” that is, church; “He is at the
President’s,” that is, house. I

“ Nor think a lover’s are but fancied woes.”--Cowper.
That is, a lover’s woes. “ Whose book is this? William's.”

News 2.--When the possessor is described by two or more names, the
sign of the possessive is generally annexed to the last; as, “ Edward,
the Second of England’s Queen.”-——Bacon an Empire.

“In Edward the Third’s time.”--Black. Com. b. 1. ch. 2.

as “ John the Baptist’s head.”--Matt.

“ ﬂvmember qfparlz'ament’s paying court to his constituents; I‘
in e.

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 119

But if the thing possessed is represented as belonging to a number
severally speciﬁed, the sign of the possessive is repeated with each ; as,
“ He has the surgeon’s and the physician’s advice.” “ It was my fa-
ther’s, mother’s, and uncle’s opinion.”*

Norm: 3.—-When of is used before the possessive case of nouns, there
is a double possessive, the thing possessed not being repeated; as,“ Vi-
tal air Was a discovery of Priestleg/’s.” “Combustion, as now under-
stood, Was a discovery of Lavoisier’s.” The sense of which is, that
vital air was one of the discoveries of Priestley. This idiom prevents
the repetition of the same Word.

NOTE 4.—-The possessive may be supplied by of, before the name of
the possessor 3 as, “ the hope of a christian.” But of does not always de-
note possession ; it denotes also consisting of,‘ or in, conceming, &c.;
and in these cases, its place cannot be supplied by the possessive case.

_ Thus cloth of wool, cannot be converted into wool’s cloth ; nor a cup of

water, into water’s cap ; nor an idea of an angel, into an angel’s idea;
not the house of Lords, into the Lord’s house.

RULE XXV.

Participles are often used for nouns, and have the like ef-
fect in governing them in the possessive case; as, “ A 0011-
rier arrived from Madrid, with an account of his Catholic ma-
jest}/’s having agreed to the neutrality.” “ In case of his
Catholic majesty’s dying without issue.” “Averse to the
nation’s involving itself in another war.”-—I[ume, Cont. vol.
7, b. 2, ch. 1. “ Who can have no notion "of the same per-
son’s possessing different accomplishments.”—-S_pect. N0.
150.

This is the true idiom of the language; yet the omission
of the sign of the possessive is a common fault among mod-
ern writers, who learn the language by grammar, and neg-
lect usages which are much better authority, and the basis

* The contrary rule in Murray is egre iously wrong ; as exempliﬁed
in this phrase—-“ This was my father, mot er and uncle’s advice :”-——this
is not English. When we say, “ The king of England’s throne,” the
three words king of England, are one name in effect, and can have but
one sign of the possessive. But when two or three distinct names are
used, the article possessed is described as belonging to each : “ It was
my father’s advice, my mother’s advice, and my uncle’s advice.” We
can omit advice alter the two ﬁrst, ‘but by no means, the Sign of the pos-
sesslve.

“ There is no reason for hydrogen being an exception.”

RULE XXVI.

Transitive verbs and their participles require the objective
case or the object of action to follow them ; as, “ In the be-
ginning, God created the heaven and the earth.”

“If ye love me, keep my commandments.” “ 0 right-
eous Father, the world hath not known thee.”

Sometimes the object and often the objective case of sub-
stitutes precedes the governing verb; as, “The spirit of
truth, whom the world cannot receive.” “ I/Vhom ye igno-
rantly worship, him declare I unto you.”

I/Vhom and which, when in the objective case, always pre-
cede the verb. ,

In verse, a greater license of transposition is used, than
in prose, and names are often placed before the governing
verb.

  1 “ But through the heart

Should jealousy its venom once d2_'ﬁuse.”—- Thomson.

“She with extended arms his aid implores.”--"-Ibm.

A‘ name with whatever, whatsoever or whichever, pre-
ceding, is placed before the governing verb; as, “whatsoever

positive ideas we have.”——Loche, 2. 1'7.

The object is often omitted after a transitive verb; as, he
reads.  

N ore 1.-——VVe have some verbs which govern two words in the ob-
jective case; as, I
“ Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay
To mold me man .?”-—.Milton, 10, 744.
“ God seems to have made him what he was.”--Life of Cowper.
“ Ask him his opinion ;” “ You have asked me the news.”

,Will it be said that the latter phrases are elliptical, for “ ask of him his
opinion?” I apprehend this to be a mistake. According to the true idea
0 the government of a transitive verb, him must be the object in the
phrase under consideration, as much as in this, “ Ask him for a guinea ;”
or in this,“ Ask him to go.” »

This idiom is very ancient, as we often see in the Latin--“ Interro -
tus sententiam.” Liv. 26. 33. “ Se id Scipionemorm-e.”--lbm.
“-Auxilia regem orabant.”—--Ibm. lib. 28. 5. The idiom in both lan-
guages had a common origin.

Nora 2.-—Some verbs were formerly used as transitive, which are no
longer considered as such ; as, “ he repented him,”—-“ ﬂee thee away,”
-r--“ he was swerved ”——“ the sum was amounted,” &c. which are held
improper. .

Cease, however, is used as a transitive verb by our b writers—
“ Cease this impious rage.”-—.Milton. “ Her lips their music cease.”-——
Tasso by’ Hoole.

RULE XXVII.

Intransitive verbs are followed by the name of the act or
efect, which the verb expresses in action; as, “To live a lzfe
of virtue ;” “to die the death of the righteous ;” “ to dream
dreams ;” “to run a race ;” “to sleep the sleep of death.”

We observe, in these examples, life is the name of living
-supposed to be complete ; as race is the name of the act of
running, when accomplished.

Nora.--N early allied to this idiom is that of using, after verbs transi-
tive or intransitive, certainnouns which are not the objects of the verb,
nor of precisely the same sense ; but which are either the names of the
result of the verb’s action, or closely connected with it. Examples : “ A
«guinea weighs ﬁve penny weight, six grains ;” “ a. crown Weighs nine-
teen penny weight ;”* “ a. piece of cloth measures ten yards.”

“ And on their hinges grate harsh thunder.” “ And rivers run pota-
ble gold.” “ The crispid brook ran nectar.” “ Groves whose rich trees
wept odorous gums and balm.” “ Grin a. ghastly smile.”--.Milt_on.

“ Her lips blush deeper sweets.”——Thomson.

“ To ascend or descend a ﬂight of stairs, a ladder, or a.mounta.in”—-
“ To cost a gu1nea.”

Under this rule or the following may be arranged these expressions-—
“ Let them go their way”-—-“ When matters have been brought this
length.” Lavois. Translation. “We turn our eyes this way or that
way.” “Reckoning any way from ourselves, a yard, 3. mile,” &c.
Locke, 2, 17.

Similar to this idiom are the phrases to go west or east--poz‘ntina
north or south—-north-west or south-east and the like, which I ﬁnd to be
Saxon phrases and very ancient.

In someinstances verbs of this sort are followed by two objects ; as,
“ a ring cost the purchaser an eagle.” l

p..__

* The radical idea of weight is carry, bear or sustain, from the Saxon
wceg, a balance. The idiom in question has its ori inal in that idea~—a.
guinea weighs ﬁve penny Weights six grains--that 18, carries or sustains
that weight in the scales. How much of the propriety, and even of the
beauty of language is lost, by neglecting to study its primitive state and
principles! i

RULE "XXVIII.

Names of certain portions of time and space, and espe-
cially wogls denoting continuance of time or progression,
are used without a governing word; as, “ Jacob said,I will
serve thee seven years for Rachel.” “And dust shalt thou
eat all the days of thy lzfef” “And he abode with him the
space of a month.” “The tree of life yielded her fruit
every month.” “ In those days I Daniel was mourning three
full weehs.” “Whosoever shall urge thee to go a mile, go
with him twain.” “ To walk a mile, or a league.”

“ Effects occurring every moment to ourselves.”
“ You have asked me news a hundred times.”---.Pope.*

Words expressing particular or precise points of time
are usually preceded by a preposition; as, “ at that hour ;”
“ on that day.” But to both these rules there are excep-
tions.

RULE XXIX.

The verb be has the same case after it as before it; or
two substitutes connected with be in construction are in the
same case. “It is I, be not afraid.” “ Thou artshe,” “it
is he.” “ I/Vho was he .7” “ T/Vho do men say that I am ’l’’
‘‘ T/Vhom do they represent me to be ?” But “ I/Vhom do
men say that I am,” is incorrect.

RULE XXX.

Transitive verbs and their participles admit of a sentence,
8. clause or a number of wordsas their object; as, “ He is
not alarmed so far, as to consider how much nearer he ap-
proaches to his end.”——Rambler, N0. 78.

Consider what’! The whole following clause, which is
the object of the verb.

* Lowth, followed by the whole tribe of writers on this subject, al-
ledges some prepositions to be understood before these expressions of
time. But this is a palpable error, arising from preconceived notions of
‘the necessity of such words. The fact is otherwise. All these peculiar
phrases are idiomatic; and the remains of the early state of our lan-

ua e.
g T we same idiom is found in the Greek and Latin languages, which
were built on a Teutonic foundation--—it is found in the Saxon, from
which it is derived to modern English; and is therefore to be considered
as original, or coeval with the language.

“ For to say, a man has a positive clear idea of any quan-
tity, without knowing how great it is, is as unreasonable as
to say, he has a positive clear idea of the number of sands on
the sea shore.”———-Loclce, 2, 1'7. 15. Here the parts of this
period in italics are the things said, the objects of the verb
say. The ﬁrst clause, being the object after say, forms, with
the preceding words, the nominative to is——and the same
clause of the period is qualiﬁed by the attribute unreasona-
ble——For to say all which follows is as unreasonable, &c.

“If he escapes being banished by others, I fear he will
banish himself.” Pope, Let. to Swift.

Here being banished stands in the place of a noun, as the
object after escapes.

“ Whether that which we call ecstasy be not dreaming with
the eyes open, I leave to be examined.” Loclce, 2, 19.

“We cannot avoid observing their sensible qualities, nay

This rule comprehends the construction of the verbs
save, except, add, admit, allow, suppose, and many others-
when used to govern sentences; and in strictness, the old
verbs  though, unless. Examples :—

“ Add to this, what, from its antiquity, is but little known,
has from that very circumstance, the recommendation of nov-
elty”-—IIermes, Preface. In this sentence the whole of
the clauses in italics, is what is to be added-——and is the ac-
tual object governed by the verb add.

“And he could there do no mighty works, save that he

a “He that is washed, needeth not, save to wash his feet.”
John 13.

" Add to this their custom of plantation of colonies.”
Bacon.

In these and similar passages, the object of the verb is a
whole proposition or statement, in a sentence or clause of a
sentence. In this passage, “Except ye repent, ye shall all‘
likewise perish,” the fact excepted is aﬂirmed in a single
verb. Take away this fact “ that you shall repent’.’---and the
consequence must be, you will perish. This is one of the
modes of abbreviation in language which I have so frequent-r
ly mentioned, and which constitutes a principal. excellence
of the English.

We observe in some of the passages here cited, the pro-
noun that, after the verb. This is probably the true origin-»
al‘ construction; the substitute that, pointing to the whole
following clause. “ He could do ‘no mighty works there,
save that, [except that single fact which follows] he laid his
hand on a few sick and healed them.”

NOTE.-—-It may be here observed that in‘ some of the passages cited
theverb has no deﬁnitive nominative--—the verbs save, except, sup ose,
add, &c. are in the imperativemode ; but the address is not ma e to
any particular person or persons. And this probably has led authors to
class save and except among conjunctions, prepositions or adverbs, or to
consider them as used adverbially; for it has been already observed

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 125

that the class of adverbs has been a sort of common sink to receive all
Words which authors have not been able to comprehend.

Is it not strange that suppose, add, admit, allow, and other verbs,
which are constantly used in the same manner, should h.ave hitherto es-
caped the same doom ? In the passages above cited from Paley, suppose
is used precisely in the same manner as except and save in others. In-
deed nothing but the most inexcusable negligence could have led critics
to this classiﬁcation of save and exce;ut-——f'or in many passages of scrip-
ture, these very words, in the sense in which they are called conjunc-
tions or adverbs, have an object following them, like other transitive
verbs ; as, “ Israel burned none of them save Hazor only.”—-Josh. 11. 13.
“ Ye shall not come into the land, save Caleb and Joshua.”——.N'um. 14.
30. “ I would that all were as I am, except these bonds.”-—ﬂcts.

This use of verbs without a definite nominative occasions no incon-
venience; for the address is not made to any particular person, but is
equally applicable to any one who will apply it. See the subject further
explained under rule 38. The following passage in Locke, 2, 27, 2,con-
tains another verb used in the same manner; “ Could two bodies be in
the same place at the same time, then those two parcels of matter must
be one and the same, take them great or little.”

The error of considering save as an adverb or conjunction, has how-
ever produced a multitude of mistakes in construction, as in these pas»-
sages : “ Save he who reigns above."--Milton. “ Which no man know-
eth, saving he that receiveth it.”-—-Rev. 2. 17. The nominative he can-
not be reconciled to any principle of true construction. He ought to be
him, the object after the verb. Except might have been used, and this
word being called a preposition, would have required after it the objec-
tive case. But both words are verbs, and ought to have the same con-
struction.

RULE XXXI.

The inﬁnitive mode follows, ﬁrst, another verb-or parti-
ciple; as, “ He loves to cherish the social aﬂ'ections”-—“ be
persuaded to abandon a vicious life”—-“ he is willing to en-
counter danger”—-—“ he was proceeding to relate his adven-
tures.”

2dly. The inﬁnitive follows anoun; as, “ The next thing
natural for the ’ mind to do.”-——Loclce. “ He has a desire to
improve.” T

Sdly. It follows ‘an adjective or verbal attribute; as, “ a
question difficult to be solved.” “ It is delightful to contem-
plate the goodness of Providence.” “God is worthy to be
loved and trusted.” “ Be prepared to receive your friend.”

4thly. It follows as; thus, “ an object so high as to be in-
visible ;” “ a question so obscure as to perplea: the under-
standing.”
ll *

126 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

5thly. It follows than after a comparison; as, “Nothing
makes a man suspect much, more than to know little.”—-—Ba-
con on Suspicion.

6thly. It follows the preposition for, noting cause or mo-
tive; -as, “ What went ye out for to see.”---Zllatth. 11.

This is the true original idiom; but it is usual now to
omitfor; as, “ he went to see a reed shaken with the wind.”
In every phrase of this sort, for is implied in the sense;
but the use of the word is vulgar.

The inﬁnitive mode is independent,‘ standing as a substitute
for a whole phrase; as, “It is not once in ten attempts that
you can ﬁnd the case you seek, in any law book; to say
nothing of those numerous points of conduct concerning
which the law professes not to prescribe.”-—-Paley, Philos. 4.

RULE, XXXII.

The verbs bid, make, see, hear,_ feel, let, with the auxilia-
ries, may, can, must, shall and will, and dare and need, when
used as auxiliaries, are followed by the inﬁnitive without the
preﬁx to ; as “ He bids me eo7ne”——“We cannot make them
understand”-l-—-“Let me see you wrz°te”--“ We heard him
relate the stor ”—--“ We felt the earth tremble”---“VVhich

Y
they let pass.”——Loclce. “He may go, can go, must go,
shall go, Wlll go." “I dare engage; I dare say”-—-“ He
need not be anxious.”  

N orrc ’1.—-In the uses of clare and need, there are some peculiarities
which deserve remark.

When dare signiﬁes to defy or challenge, it is regular in the tenses
and persons, is a. transitive verb, and followed bythe inﬁnitive with the
usual preﬁx; as, “ he dares me to enter the list.” But when it is in-
transitive, denoting to have courage, it more generally drops the per-
sonal terminations, has an anomalous past tense, and is followed by the
inﬁnitive without to ; in short it has the form of an auxiliary; and in
the German, it is classed with the, auxiliaries. Examples: “ I dare en-
gage.”—-—Pope’s Works, Letter to Gay. “I dare not confess.”--Swz:ft to
Gay. “ I dare say.”--—LocI£e. “But, my Lord, you dare. not do 91.
ther.”--Jum'“us, Leta. 28. ,“ Durst I venture to deliver my own senti-
ment.”-—Huxr_n,e, Es. 7.

The past tense, when regular, is followed by the inﬁnitive with the
usual reﬁx :,--—-“ You have dared to throw more than a suspicion upon
mine.”-—-Juni‘us, Let. 20. ’ The same remark may be extended to the
future tense ; “ He will not dare to attack his adversary.”

In like manner, need, when a transitive verb, is regular in its inflec-
tions; as, “ A man needs more prudence”--“ The army needed provis-
ions.”--But when intransitive, it drops the personal terminations in the

OF ‘THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 127

present tense ; is forme-d like an auxiliary, and followed by a verb, with-
out the preﬁx to ; as, “ N obod need be afraid he shall not have scope
enough.”---Locke, 2, 22, 9. “ need not go any farther.”---Ibm. “ Nor
need we 2oondcr.”—-Ibm. “ The lender need be under no fear.”--—-./.‘1n-
ach. ch. 69. “There need be no diﬁ'1culty."—-—Beddoes, Hygeia, 1. 27.
“ She need dig no more.”--Spectator, No. 121. “ A man need not be
uneasy on these grounds.”--Boswell, 3, 41. “ He need not urge to this
honorable court.”-Judge Chase.

In the use of this verb, there is another irregularity, which is peculiar,
the verb being without a nominative, expressed or implied. “ Whereof
here needs no account.”——Milt. P. L. 4. 235. There is no evidence of
the fact, and there needs none. This is an established use of need.

N on: 2.—-The inﬁnitive mode has, in its sense and use, a near affinity
to a noun, and often has the construction of one. It is much employed
to introduce sentences which are the nominative to verbs, as well as the
objects following them ; as, “ To will is present with me, but to perform
that which is good I ﬁnd not.” Here the ﬁrst inﬁnitive is the nomina-
tive to is, and the second begins the sentence which is the object alter

' ﬁnd.

N on: 3.-—-A common mistake in the use of the inﬁnitive is, to use the
perfect tense after another verb in the past time ; when in fact one of the
verbs in the past time would correctly express the sense , thus, “ It
would have been no diﬂicult matter to have compiled a volume of such
amusing precedents.”--—C'owp. to Hill, Let. 29. Here the ﬁrst verb states
the time past when it was not difficult to compile a volume; at that
time the compilation could not be past; the verb therefore should have
been to compile, which is present and always indeﬁnite.

In the followingipassage, we have a like use of verbs which is cor-
rect. “ A free pardon was granted to the son, who was known to have
ojfered indignities to the body of Varus."--Murphy, Tacitus, 6. 1.
Here the ofering of indignities was a fact precedent to the time stated
in the verb was lcnozon ; and, therefore the verb, to have ofered, is well
employed.

RULE XXXIII.

The inﬁnitive signifying motive or purpose, often intro-
duces a clause or sentence which is not the nominative or
objective to any verb; as, “ To see Itow far this reaches, and
what are the causes of wrong judgment, we must remember
that things are judged good or bad in a double sense.”-—
Loelce, 2, 21, 61. “ To prevent property from being too
unequally distributed, no person should be allowed to dis-
pose of his possessions to the prejudice of his lawful heirs.”
—-Anaeh. ch. 62.

No'r1a:.-—Tl1is form of sentence seems to be derived from the use of for
before the verb, for to see. The modern practice is to preﬁx some noun ;
aain order to see, or “ With a view to prevent.”

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 11

DIVISION OF NAMES OR NOUNS.

Names are of two kinds; common, or those which repre-
sent the idea of a whole kind or species; and proper or ap
propriate, which denote individuals. Thus animal is a
name common to all beings, having organized bodies and
endowed with life, digestion, and spontaneous motion;
Plant and vegetable are names of all beings which have or-
ganized bodies and life, without the power of spontaneous
motion. Fowl is the common name of all feathered animals
which ﬂy; fish, of animals which live wholly in water.

On the other hand, Thomas, John, William, are proper
or appropriate names, each denoting an individual of which
there is no species or kind. London, Paris, Amsterdam,
Rhine, Po, Danube, Massachusetts, Hudson, Patowmac, are
also proper names, being appropriate to individual things. "

Proper names however become common when they com-
prehend two or more individuals ; as, the Capets, the Smiths,
the Fletchers——“ Two Roberts there the pagan force defy’d.”

Hoole’s Tasso, b. 20.

LIMITATION OF NAMES.

Proper names are suﬂiciently deﬁnite without the aid of
another word to limit their meaning, as Boston, Baltimore,
Savannah. -Yet when certain, individuals have a common
character, or predominant qualities which create a simili-
tude between them, this common character becomes in the
mind a species, and the proper name of an individual pos»
sessing this character, admits of the deﬁnitives and of plural
number, like a common name. Thus a conspirator is called
a Catiline; and numbers of them Catilines or the Catilines
of their country. A distinguished general is called a Cesar;
an eminent orator the Cicero of his age. ,

But names, which are common to a whole kind or species,
require often to be limited to an individual or a certain num-
ber of individuals of the kind or species. For this purpose
the English language is furnished with a number of words,
as an, or a, the, this, that, these, those, and a few others,
which deﬁne the extent of the signiﬁcation of common
names, or point to the particular things mentioned. These
are all adjectives or attributes, having a dependence on some
noun expressed or implied; but some of them are used also

128 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

RULE XXXIV.

In the use of the passive form of the verb,.there is often
an inversion of the order of the subject and object; thus,
“The bishops and abbots were allowed their seats in the
house of lords.”—-—Blachs. Com. 1). 1, ch. 2.

Here the true construction would be, “ Seats in the house
of lords were allowed to the bishops and abbots.”

“Theresa. was forbid the presence of the emperor.”-—
Murphy’s Tacitus, 2, 540. No'rE.——-This is a common
phrase. It may be resolved thus: the presence of the em-
peror was forbid to Theresa-—or, Theresa was forbid to ap-
proach the presence of the emperor.

“I was this day shown a new potato.”-—Darwin, Phy-
tol. Sect. 18.

“ He was shown that very story in one of his own books.”
, Guth. Quins. 1. 32.
This idiom is outrageously anomalous; but perhaps in-
corrigible.

RULE XXXV.

The participle of the present tense without a deﬁnitive a
or the, or with any possessive attribute, usually retains the
sense of its verb, and has the objective case after it; as, “ The
clerk is engrossing the bill.” “ The love we hear our
friends is generally caused by our ﬁnding the same dispo-
sitions in them, which we feel in ourselves.”

. Pope’s Letters.

“ In return to your inviting me to your forest.”——1bm.

But when the participle is preceded by a or the, it takes
the characterand government of a noun, and in most cases,
must be followed by of; as “ The middle station of life
seems to be most advantageously situated for the gaining of

-~ wisdom. Poverty turns our thoughts too much upon the

supplying of our wants, and riches, upon enjoying our su-
perﬂuities.” Spectator, No. 464.

In many cases this participle becomes a noun, without a
or the; as, “It is more properly talking upon paper, than
writing.”--Pope, Let.  

Norm.---The fore oing rule is often violated by our best writers, and
to make it universe is to assume an authority much too dictatorial.

with the participle of the perfect tense, often perform, at

of a sentence or a substitute for a sentence; ‘ as, “ Concerning
relation in general, these things may be considered.”

Locke, 2. 25.

, Here concerning relates to the whole of the last clause of
the sentence—-—“ These things may be considered”---all which
is concerning relation in general.

“ This criterion will be diferent, according to the nature
of the object which the mind contemplates.” I
Enﬁeld, Hist. .P]l.2. 15.

That is, the difference of criterion will accord with the na-
ture of the object.

“According to Hierocles, Ammonius was induced to ex-
ecute the plan of a distinct eclectic school,” &c‘.
Ibm. p. 63.

Here the whole statement of facts in the last clause was
according to Hierocles; that is, it accorded with his testi-
mony.

“I have accepted thee, concerning this thing also.”

“Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites, touching their
charge.”—-—Num. 8. 26.

“ And touching the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear
ye the word of the Lord.”—Jer. 21. 10.

“ Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that
We all have knowledge.”-—.1 Cor. 8. 1.

In general, as is used in scripture before touching, and
the construction is, “Now, as, or that which follows is
touching things offered to idols.” Since the translation of
the Bible, this word touching, in this sense, has been obso-
lescent, and respecting has taken its place.

“He ﬁnds the ideas he has in his mind to agree or dis-

Nora.--The use of participles explained under this rule, coincides
with that of attributes as explained under rule 17.

RULE XXXVIII.

Participles often stand without a name, sentence or sub-
stitute on which they immediately depend, being referable
to either of the persons indeﬁnitely; as, “It is not possible
to act otherwise, consicleringthe weakness of our nature.”
—S’pectator.

Norn 1.—Johnson, in his Dictionary, calls this a kind of conjunction,
and adds--“ It had been more grammatically written considered, vu
French, but considering is always used.”

This criticism indicates an incorrect view of the subject. Considered
cannot be used without a change in the structure of the sentence-—
“ The weakness of our nature being considered.” But to make this form
of expression correspondent to the other clause, that ought also to be
varied, and a deﬁnite person introduced, thus-—-“ It does not appear (to
us) possible to act otherwise, the wdakness of our nature being consid-
ered.” But this amendment would be of‘ no advantage.

To comprehend the use of such expressions, we should consider that
men ﬁnd it useful to deal in abstract propositions and lay down truths
without reference to persons. This manner of discoursing is often less
lnvidious than to apply propositions or opinions to persons. To accom-
plish this purpose, men have devised words and modes of speech which
enable them thus to communicate their ideas. ‘ In the passage cited, the
ﬁrst clause contains a general abstract proposition ,equall’y applicable to
any person—-“ It is not possible to act otherwise.” That is, it is not pos-

3132 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

sible for me, foryou, for him, or for her—-—but it might be invidious to
specify persons. It is not possible for .J ohn or Thomas to act otherwise,
he considering the weakness of his nature. Hence the proposition is
left without application—and it follows naturally that the persons who
are to consider the cause, the weakness of our nature, should be left
indeﬁnite, or unascertained. Hence considering is left without a. direct
application to any person.

Whatever foundation there may be for this explanation, the idiom is
common and well authorized.

“ Generally speaking, the heir at lawis not bound by the intention of
the testator.”-—-Paley, Phil. 23.

“ Su posing that electricity is actually a substance, and taking it for

can be referred; we would be most naturally understood-—

,“ Supposing the ﬁrst stratum of particles to remain in their place,

after their union with caloric, we can conceive an aﬁinity,” &c.—--Ibm. ,

Here supposing may beireferred to we, but is this the real construction?

“ Comparing two men, in reference to a common parent, it is easy to

“ Granting this to be true, it would help us in the species of things
no farther than the tribes of animals and vegetables.”--Loclw, 3. 6, 23.

Eating for abating, in a like construction, is found in old authors, but
now obsolete. ﬂdmitting, allowing, and some others are frequent in a
like construction. ,

The substitute, which, in most of these phrases, might be most con-
veniently supplied, is we, as the writer may be considered as addressing
himself to his readers, and including them with himself.

It will be readily observed how nearly this idiom is allied to the inde-
pendent clause; for, by a triﬂing change, these sentences may be re-
solved into that case. “Two men being compared in reference to a

common parent, it is easy [for us, you or him to frame‘ the ideas of

brothers.”-—“ Hinder me not, since (seeing) t e Lord hath prospered
my way.”

OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 133

RULE XXXIX.

Adverbs or modiﬁers are usually placed near the words
whose signiﬁcation they are intended to affect.

First. They are placed before adjectives; as, truly wise ;
sincerely upright ; unaﬂectedly polite.

Secondly. They usually follow a verb when single; as,
he spoke eloquently; and if a verb is transitive with an
object following, the modiﬁer follows the object; as, “ John.
received the present gratefully.”

To this rule, the exceptions are very numerous, and not
to be classed under general heads. “ So it frequently hap-
pens ;” “ men often deceive themselves.”---Indeed, in many
cases, the position of the modiﬁer makes no difference in the
sense, and may be regulated entirely by the preference of
sound, in the general structure of the period, provided it is
not such as to mislead the reader, in the application of the
word.

Thirdly. When one auxiliary and a participle are used,
the modiﬁer is usually placed between them, or it follows the
participle; as, “ hepwas graciously received,” or “he was
received graciously.” The first is the most elegant.

Fourthly. When two auxiliaries are used, the adverb is
usually placed after the second ;‘ as, “ We have been kindly
treated”—-—But it may follow the participle, “We have been
treated kindly ;” and in some cases it may precede the aux-
iliaries ; as, “ And certainly you must-have known.”---Jum'u,s,
Letter 8.

Fifthly. When adverbs are emphatical, they may intro-
duce a sentence, and beseparated from the word to which
they belong; as, “How completely this most amiable of
human virtues‘ had taken possession of his soul l”-——'-Port.
Lect. 8. This position of the modifier is most frequent in
interrogative and exclamatory. phrases.

The adverb always is usually placed before a verb.

Never commonly precedes a single verb, except be, which
it follows; as, “ We are never absent from church‘ on Sun-
day.” It is sometimes placed before an auxiliary; as, “ He
never has been at court ;” ‘but it is more correctly and ele-
gantly placed after the ﬁrst auxiliary; as, “ He has never
been at court”—-“ He has never been intoxicated.”

This word has a peculiar use in the phrase, “ ask me
never so much goWr'y.”-——Gen. 34. “The voice of charm-

I

134 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

ers, charming never so wisely.”—-Psalm 58. The sense is,
“Ask me so much dowry as never was asked before”--an
abbreviation singularly expressive of the idea of asking to
any amount or extent. Authors not understanding it, have
substituted ever for never, which impairs the force, if it does
not destroy the sense, of the phrase. The use of both is
now common, but never is preferable——“Some agreements
indeed, though never so expressly made, are deemed of so
important a nature, that they ought not to rest in verbal
promise on1y.”—-—BlacIc. Com. B. 3. ch. 9.

The use of here and there, in the introduction of sentences
before verbs, forms an authorized idiom. of the language;
though the words may be considered as redundant. The
practice may have originated in the use of the hand in
pointing, in the early stage of society.

Here, there, and where, originally denoting place, are
now used in reference to words, subjects and various ideas
of which place is not predicable. “It is not so With re-
spect to volitions and actions; here the coalescence is inti-
mate.”-—-Ilermes, ch. 8. “ We feel pain, in the sensations,
where ‘we expected pleasure.”-—-Loche, 2. 7. 4.

Hence, whence, and thence, denoting the place from which
a. departure is stated, are used either with or without the
preposition from. In strictness, the idea of from is in-
cluded in the words, and it ought not to be used. These

.words also are used not only in reference to place, but to

any argument, subject, or idea, in a discourse. ,
Hither, thither, and whither, denoting to a place, are
nearly obsolete in popular practice; and obsolescent in
writing; being superseded by here, there, where. This
change is evidently the effect of the all-controlling disposi-
tion of men to abridge speech’ by dismissing useless sylla-
bles, or by substituting short Words of easy pronunciation

i for those which are more difficult. Against this disposition

and its effects,’ the critic remonstrates in vain; and we may
rest assured that common convenience and utility are better
guides in whatever respects the use of Words, than the
opinion of men in their closets. No word or syllable in a
language, which is essential, or very useful, is ever lost.

T/Vhile is a noun denoting time, and not a modiﬁer. In
this phrase, ‘? I will go while you stay,” the word is used
in its primitive manner, without government, like many
other names of portions of time-—a month, a week.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 135

We are accustomed to use, as modiﬁers, a little and a
great deal. “ The many ‘letters I receive, do not a little
encourage me.”——Speet. No. 124. Many names are used in
like manner, as modiﬁers of the sense of verbs. “ You don’t
care s-ix-pence whether he was wet or dry.”—Jolmson.

RULE XL.

In polite and classical language, two negatives destroy the
negation and express an aﬁirmative ; as, “ Nor did he not
perceive them,”-—that is, he did not perceive them. This
phraseology is not common nor agreeable to the genius of
our tongue. r

The following is a common and well authorized use 0
negatives; “ His manners are not inelegant,” that is, are
elegant. This manner of expression, however, when not
accompanied with particular emphasis, denotes a moderate
degree of the quality.

No'ri«:.—-In popular language, two negatives are used for a negation,
according to the practice of the ancient. Greeks and the modern French.
This idiom was primitive, and was retained in the Saxon; as, “ Oc se
kinning Peada ne rixade nane while.”——-Sasv. Chron. p. 33. And the
king Peada did not reign none while—that is, not a. long time. The
learned, with a view to philosophical correctness, have rejected the use
of two negatives for one negation. The consequence is, we have two
modes of speaking directly opposite to each other, but expressing the
same thing. “ He did not owe nothing,” in vulgar language, and “ he
owed nothing,” in the style of the learned, mean precisely the same
thing. i

RULE XLI.

Prepositions are followed by the names of objects and the
objective case; as, from New York to Philadelphia; across
the Delaware; over land; by water; through the air; with
us; for me; to them; in you; among the people; toward
us.
The preposition to is supposed to be omitted after verbs
of giving, yielding, aﬁording, and the like‘; as, “ give them
bread,” instead of “ give bread to them.” “ Afford him pro-
tection ;” “ furnishrher with books.” But this idiom seems
to be primitive, and not elliptical.

From is sometimes suppressed, as in this phrase‘: “He
was banished the kingdom.”

Home, after a verb denoting motion to, is always used
without to; as, “ We are going home.”

136 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

After the attribute near, to is often. omitted; as, “ To
bring them nearer the truth.”—--rlfassillon. Also, after ad-
joining ; as, “ a garden adjoining a river.”

The preposition is sometimes separated from the word
which it governs; as, “With a‘ longing for that state which
he is charmed with,” instead of “ with which he is charmed.”

In many cases, the relative pronoun may be suppressed;
as, “ I did not see the person he came with,” that is, with
whom he came—-—-and in other cases, what is employed for the
word governed; as, ‘‘ I know not what person he gave the
present to.”

This separation of the preposition from the word govern-
ed by it, and the suppression, of the substitute, are most
common. and most allowable in colloquial and epistolary
language. In the grave and elevated style, they are sel-
dom elegant; and never to be admitted to the prejudice of
perspicuity; as in i the following p.assag.e-——-“ Of a space or
number, which, in a constant and endless enlarging progres-
sion, it can in thought never attain to.”—-—-Locke, 2. 17. 8.

A separation of the preposition to such a distance from
the word with which it is connected in construction, is per-
plexing and inelegant.

No.'rn.,—--In, the use of who as an interrogative, there is an apparent
deviation from re njlar construction--—it bein used without distinction of
ease ; as, “\ Who '0 you speak to P” “ Who IS she married to?” “ Who
is this reserved for?" “ Who was it made by?” This idiom is not
merely colloquial ; it is found in the Writings of our best authors. It is
the Latin cui and qua. l

N o'rE.—-—We observe, in the foregoing passages, the preposition has
two uses-——one is to precede a word to which other words are annexed
as necessary to complete the sense---“ about the beginning.” Here the
sense is not complete~——the time is not designated. To deﬁne the time
which is the object of the preposition about, it is necessary to add the
words “ of the eleventh century”——about that time. So that the whole
clause is really the object after the preposition.

The other use of the preposition is to precede nouns, verbs or other
Words, which are not the object of the preposition, but which have a
construction independent of it; as, “ after men became christians."
Here men is the nominative to became ; yet the whole proposition is as
really the object governed by aﬁer, as the Word hour, in the phrase, af-
ter that hour. pk“ Against I see you,” is a phrase of like construction.
N 0 single word is an object or in the objective case after against; but
the whole atﬁrmation is the object. “ Without we can possess our-
selves,” has a like construction, and though su rseded, in a degree, by
unless, a word of similar import, is a. true Eng ish phrase: Aﬂzer [this
fact] men became christians-—Against [that time when} I see you—--
Without [this fact] we can possess ourselves.

Let us examine the following sentence : “ After thus consider-in
what was likely to happen, we are next to inquire,” &c.—-Paley, Em’ .
ch. 2. Here considering refers to we-; but is it not, with the whole
clause, governed by after as the object ?

peat in our minds the idea of years and ages P”-—LocIce,2. 1'7, 10. Here

as substitutes. Of these an or a and the are never employ-
ed as substitutes, but are constantly attached to some name,
or an equivalent word; and from their peculiar use, have
obtained the distinctive appellation of articles. But dgin-i-
tive is a more signiﬁcant and appropriate term ; as they are
deﬁnitive attributes, and have, grammatically considered, the
like use as this, that, some, none, any.

An is simply the Saxon ane, or am, one. It was formerly
written an before a consonant ;“" but for the ease and rapidi-
ty of utterance, it is written and pronounced a before a con-
sonant, and before a vowel which includes the sound of a con-
sonant; as, apen, aunion : also before It aspirate ; as, a house.
It retains its primitive orthography an, before a vowel, and
a silent consonant; as, an eagle, an hour.

The is used before vowels and consonants; but in poetry,
3, for the sake of measure, may be omitted, and th made to
coalesce with a succeeding vowel; as, “ th’embroidered vest.”

RULE I.

A noun or name, without a preceding deﬁnitive, is used
either in an unlimited sense, extending to the whole species,
or, in an indeﬁnite sense, denoting a number or quantity, but
not the whole.

“ The proper study of mankind is man.” Pope.

Here man comprehends the whole species.

“a In the first place, woman has, in general, much stronger
propensity than man to the perfect discharge of parental

  duties.”—-Life of Cowper.

Here woman and man comprehend each the whole spe-
cies of its sex.

“From whom also I received letters to the brethren.”-—

“ The men were overwhelmed by the waves, and absorb-
ed by the eddies. Horses, baggage, and dead bodies, were

In these passages, letters, horses, and, dead bodies, with
out a deﬁnitive, denote some, an indefinite number, but no
all. So in the following sentence :

A house is consumed by _ﬁre--ﬁre is extinguished by water.

“ What with more decency were in sil.ence kept,
And but for this unjust reproach, had slept.”-—Dryd. Virg. 10.96.
“ The law never speaks but to command.”-——Pa.ley, Ph. 3.

RULE XLIII.

The words if, though, unless, and lost, may be followed
by verbs in the future tense, without the usual auxiliaries
shall, will or should; as, “ If his son ash bread, will he
give him a stone?” “ If he ask a fish, will he give him a
serpent l” “ Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.”
“ He shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his
“ﬂesh with Water.” “Lest thou say, I have made Abram
rich.”

Except has a like effect upon the following verb; as, “ I
will not let thee go, except thou bless me.” Whether has
been numbered’ also among the conjunctions, which require
the conditional mod,e,'but by an egregious mistake. It is
not a connective, nor does it imply a condition or hypothe-
sis, but an al-ternative.

N o'rr:.—-—The arrangement of the foregoing form of the verb, in the
present tense of the subjunctive mode, is one of the most palpable -mis.
takes that the compilers of English rammars have committed. It seems
to have originated in the Saxon an ancient English practice of omitting
the personal termination, to express future time-—-—shall and will not being
much used, in ancient times, for this purpose. In consequence of this
practice, the translators of the Bible, who wrote the style of the age of
Elizabeth,* rarely made any diﬁ"erence between a present uncertainty
and a future contingency ; so that the present and future tenses of the
ori inal are confounded, and the form of the verb in English which com-
pre ends both, has been placed by grammarians in the present tense of
the conditional mode.

Deut. 9. 28.. Lest the land say--—In the original, lest the land shall
say--in the future. a

Deut. 30. 17.. If thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear—---
original'—-if thine heart shall turn-—‘—in the future.

1 Kings 8. 31. If any man trespass against his neighbor-—origina1-
shall trespass. .

As a general fact, the original Hebrew verb, which the translators
have rendered by a verb without shall or will or a personal termination-,
is in the future tense; and the English verb, having the ense of the fu-
ture, ought to be arranged in grammars under that tense.

* The present translation of the Bible is commonl considered as made
In the reign of James I. but on comparing it with t e translations pub
lished in the beginning of Elizabéth’s reign, it is evident that the last
translators merely revised the formercopies, altering a few phrases and
words; but leaving the body of the style unaltered.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 139

This remark is conﬁrmed by the Greek translation of the seventy-
who render the Hebrew by a verb in the future or by an aorist, the sense
of which after a sign of condition, is future.

Job 13. 15. Though he should slay me.

Levit. 22. 6. Unless he shall wash his body.

Gen. 14. 23. Lest thou shouldst say--or that thou shouldst not say.
Gen. 32. 26. Except thou shalt bless me.

See also Gen. 19. 15, Ex. 20. 19, and indeed examples in almost every
chapter in the Old Testament.

In the New Testament, the aorist, with the sense of a future, is gen-
erally rendered by a like form of the English verb. “Take heed lest
any man deceive you”—-—that is, shall or should deceive you. See 1 Cor.
10. 12, Heb. 3. 12, a future tense,-Luke 8. 12, and numerous other
examples. ,

The translation may be considered as correct ; but to make it correct,
the verbs should in grammars be arranged under the future tense, or an
aorist.

For want of attention to the distinction between present uncertainty
and future contingency, the translators have confounded two tenses of
the original, into one in English. Thus Matt. 4. 3. cu ht to be trans-
lated-—if thou art the son of God; so also Luke 23. 35. he original is in
the indicative——if' he is the son of God. So also in John 10. 24-1. 25-
15. 18. If the world hates you; in the indicative. ﬂats 3. 39——if it is
of God. See also John 7. 17-1 John 4. 1. and 8. 13.

In these and numerous other passages, the original Greek tense is cor-
rectly placed in the present tense of the z'ndicatioe——-expressing a condi-
tion or uncertainty respecting a present fact or event. And our common
people who learn the language by tradition, preserve this use of the In-
dicative, which was its primitive use ; for the Greeks and English derive
it from the same source.

“ And shall not God avenge his own elect, who cry to him day and
night, though» he bear long with them ?”—-Luke 18. 7. In the ori inal,
though he bears lon with them. The fact is not mentioned as a uture
contingency——-thoug he should bear ; butasa fact adniitte_d——-though he
bears lon with them, still he will be avenged.

“ But t ough our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed
day by day.”—-2. Cor. 4. 16. The original, diaphtheieretai, is in the pres-
ent tense of the indicative—though our outward man parishes, or rather
is pcrishing or decaying. The translation, which indicates a future
casual event, though our outward man perish, [that is, should perish,]
seems not to convey the Apostle’s meaning, for he evidently speaks of a
fact conceded, as present.

I might extend these criticisms to almost every passage in the Bible,
in which this pretended present tense of the subjunctive mode is used in
our version, and show that the translators have confounded two tenses,
which, in the original, are uniformly kept distinct.

To demonstrate the impropriety of that practice, let us attend to the:
principles of our own ton ue.

It has been before remarked that if, though and unless, are old “Saxon
verbs in the imperative mode, and that the ingenious invention of our
ancestors to express a condition or supposition was, to employ a verb,
with the sense of give, grant, put, be, zf, that is, give the fact. Were-

140 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

tain the idiom, and the words employed; but as these have lost their in-
ﬂections, critics have ignorantly classed them with conjunctions--—a part
of speech to which they have no more alliance than they have to nouns.
or adjectivesf‘ We have also certain words of Latin original, employed
for precisely the same purpose—suppose, allow and admit, which indeed
are not yet misnamed and classed with conjunctions.

The Saxon method therefore of expressing condition, doubt or hy-
pothesis, was to declare the fact which was to be supposed, by a verb in
the indicative mode, and preﬁx to this fact or statement, a verb in the
imperative mode, denoting give, grant or suppose. Thus, “Give his
son shall ask bread, will he give him a stone?” Give, in the imperative,
and his son shall ask bread, a sentence following give as its object. This
is precisely the construction of such sentences of a conditional kind. N ow
to omit the personal termination of the verb in the hypothetical sentence,
“ Give,he ask bread,” is to convert the sentence into false English, un-
less We suppose the tense future, and the auxiliary will or shall sup-
pressed. In the present tense, it is just as bad English, as to omit the
termination after the Latin equivalent Words suppose or admit. “ Sup-
pose his son ask bread”-—“ Suppose he be the son of God.”

Unless is a verb, onlysan, to unloose, release, dismiss, put away, re-
move. Unless he Wash his ﬂesh, he will be uncle-an... That is, dismiss
(or suppose not to exist) this fact——/ze wash his ﬂesh, and he will be un-
clean. This showsthat the sentence is not En Iish, except We consider’
wash as in the future, and the auxiliary shall; suppressed. That the
tense is future, is not only obvious, from the sense of the verb itself, but
from the following clause———If his son (shall) ask bread, will he give him
a stone ?,--—-Unless he (shall) Wash his ﬂesh, he will ‘be unclean--the last
clauses are in the future, corresponding in time with the contingent
events expressed in the ﬁrst clause.

The use of the present tense of the subjunctive, without
the personal terminations, was formerly very general. It
was reserved for the classical writers of the eighteenth cen-
tury to lay aside the pedantic forms,  he go,  it proceed,
though he come, &c., and restore the native idiom of the lan-
guage, by writing it as men spoke it, and as they still speak
it, unless perverted by grammars.

It is needless to multiply authorities-—-they may be cited

To the false rules of Grammars, we may ascribe the emis-
sion of the personal terminations of verbs after till and be-
fore——-—“At the end of which a new shaft is sunk, and this
is done repeatedly, till the shaft penetrate to ‘the bottom of
the mine.”——Heron’s Fourcroy, 2, 248. “The resounding
of the rock when it is struck, warns the workmen before
this event take place.”-——1hm. 249. T

It has been remarked under the head of tenses, that the
present tense is properly used for the future, after words
which carry the mind forward to the time. Till is a word
of this sort--its meaning is, to the time, which has such an
effect upon future time, that we conceive and speak of it in
the present tense. ‘

In the ﬁrst passage just cited, shall may perhaps be sup-
plied—-shall penetrate--which will render. the sentence tol-
erable ; but it cannot be preﬁxed to take in the second pas-
sage, and the sentence appears not only incorrect, but ludi-
crous. The same fault in Pinke‘rton’s Geography, renders
many passages incorrect, and some ridiculous.

of Paley.*

“ Those who hold such doctrine must require that a man
so attacked, must, before he strike the assailant, stop and

I know not whether this inaccuracy is the fault of the
judge or of the reporter; but strike cannot be considered
here as either future or conditional; it expresses time in that
indeterminate manner, which constitutes a principal oﬁice
of a present tense of the indicative—-it ought to be strikes.

RULE XLIV.

Connectives join two or more clauses or members in a
compound sentence; as, “Keep thy tongue from evil, and
thy lips from speaking guile.”

Here are two‘ clauses united by and, which continues the
sense and prevents the repetition of the verb keep.

“ I sought the Lord, and he heard me, and delivered me
from all my fears.” Here are three clauses combined into
a sentence or period by the help of and; but a new verb is
introduced in each, and the second connective prevents the
repetition of the substitute he only.

“ A wise son heareth his father’s instruction; but a scorn-
er heareth not rebuke.” Here but joins the two clauses,
but a new character is the nominative to a distinct verb, in
the second clause, which exhibits a contrast to the ﬁrst, and
no word is omitted.

* From a careful survey of the history of our langua , I have ascer-
tained beyond any reasonable doubt, that the En lish éiammarsrwhich
have been published within the last forty years, ave introduced more
errors than they have corrected.

144 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

RULE XLV.

Connectives join single words, which are the nominatives
to the same verb, expressed or understood—-—or words which
follow a transitive verb or a preposition in the same case.
Connectives also join verbs, attributes, and modiﬁers. Ex-
amples:

“ Peter and John went up into the temple.”

Here Peter and John are the nominatives to the verb, and
the connective and prevents the repetition of the verb and
following part of the sentence—-—Peter wen.t up into the tem-
ple. John went up into the temple. I and you will go to
Boston—-—-VVilliam and Thomas must go to Washington.
Neither I nor John was present-Peter or Henry will attend.
“I am the way and the truth and the life.”

In the following, the connective joins words which are
the object of a verb or preposition. “The torch of truth
discovers malevolence and envy.” “I have dispatched my
correspondents with fair words and general civility.”-—-Ram-
bler.

I esteem him and her and them—-—He loves us and you.
It is for you and me.

In the following, two verbs in the same tense or mode
are joined by a connective. “Their fondness of allegory
dazzled and confounded their understanding.”--—En_]z'eld.
“ Plutarch taught philosophy and was a voluminous writer.”
--Ibm. “ All are offthe dust and turn to dust.” “ The idea
is likelyto sink deeper and spread the farther.”

Connectives join attributes and modiﬁers; as, “He is wise
and virtuous.” “An orator pleads eloquently and plan-
sibly.”

The connectives perform a very important office in abridg-
ing language, by enabling us to omit words which must
otherwise be repeated. Thus, when I say, “ I esteem re-
ligion and virtue,” two affirmations, “I esteem religion, I
esteem virtue,” are actually included in the sentence.

When several words or clauses succeed each other, it is
not uncommon to omit the connective; as, “ We hear nothing
of causing the blind to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to
hear, the lepers to be cleansed.”-—-—Paley, Enid.

fkfter the connective than, there may be and usually is an
ellipsis of a verb, name or other words; as, “There 18

on ‘THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 145

none greater in this house than I.”—-Gen. 39. 9, that is, than
I am. '

“ In the throne only will I be greater than thou.”-Gem
6l, that is, than thou shalt be.

“ He loves his money more than his honor,” that is, more
than he loves his honor.

“ The king of the north shall return and set forth a rnul¥-
titude greater than the former.”-—-—Dan. ll. 13, that is, than
the former multitude.

“I will pull down my barns and build greater.”--Luke
lf2, that is, greater barns.

Sometimes other words may be suppressed without ob-
scuring the sense, as, “ It is better for me to die than to live.”
—-—Jonah 4. That is, better than for me to live.

Precise rules for the ellipsis of words, in all cases, cannot‘
be given. In general, a writer will be governed by a regard
to perspicuity, and omit no word, when the want of it leaves
the sense obscure or ambiguous, nor when it weakens the
strength of expression. But the following remarks and ex-
amples may be of use to the student.

1. When a number of words are joined in constrtictipn,
the deﬁnitive may be omitted, except before the first; as,
the sun, moon and stars——-a house and gar-den.——-So also when
two or more attributes agree with the same name ; as, a great,
wise, and good prince. But when attributes or names are
particularly emphatical, the deﬁnitive should be expressed
before each—--the sun, the moon and the stars.

2. The repetition of names adds emphasis to ideas; as,
“ Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God,” is more
emphatical than “ Christ the power and the wisdom of God.”

3 An‘ adjective belonging to two or more nouns joined
by a connective, may be omittedlexcept before the ﬁrst; as,
my house and garden--good qualities and actions—-—“ their
interest and solicitation”-—-—Rambler, 56. Nor does it make
any difference that the names are in different numbers; as
our attributes have no distinction of number, the same word
may be applied to the singular number and the plural; as, a
magniﬁcent house and gardens——- his house and lands. But
when a precedes the first attribute, this construction is not
elegant.

13

146 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

4. In compound sentences, a nominative pronoun or name
may be omitted before all the verbs except the first; as, I
love, fear and respect the magistrate--instead of I love, I
fear and I respect. The substitute may sometimes be sup-
pressed; as the man I saw, for the man whom I saw.

N o'rE.—-In this particular of the substitute, authors often indulge an
unwarrantable license. The use of that for that which is obsolete and
not justifiable. “ We speak that we do know,” is an. original English
phrase, but has ceased to be used by good writers.

The omission of the substitute in phrases like this—-“ There was an
instance occurred”——for which occurred—-is found in all our good authors
-—~but it is so gross a violation of syntax, without utility or pretext of any
kind, that every writer should avoid it.

The verb may often be omitted; as, he is wise and virtuous—-that is,
he is wise, he is virtuous. They go to see and be seen--that is, they go
to see, they go to be seen.

After hence, thence and whence a verb is often omitted without occa-
pionling obscurity ; as, “ Hence the ﬂood of vice which overspreads the
an .”

The auxiliaries often supply the place of a principal verb; as, John
loves money better than you do ; John has read more books than Peter
has [read ;] John shall go, but Peter shall not [go.]

5. An adverb need not be repeated with every Word which
it qualiﬁes, the connective and rendering it unnecessary; as,
he spoke and acted gracefully. Here gracefully belongs
to speakmg as well as to actmg.

A preposition may be omitted after a connective; as, he
walked over the hills and the valleys-—-that is, over the valleys.

After like and near, to is usually omitted ; as, “ Like three
distinct powers in mechanics.”—--Blacks. Com. 1. 2. That
is, like to three—-—“ Such opinions as seemed to approach
nearest the truth.”—-—Enﬁelcl, 2. 59-that is, nearest to the
truth.

Likewise after Join and acyoin, to is sometimes omitted;
as, “ a garden adjoining the river.”

For is omitted by the poets after mourn.

“ He mourn’d no recreant friend, no mistress coy.”

o Beattie.

N on: 1.--—The common rule respecting connectives is, that they join
like modes and tenses, as well as like cases ; or if the tense or mode is
changed, the nominative to the additional verb must be repeated. But
this is often false. “ He lives temperately and he has long lived temper-
n.t,ely,” is an instance in which the repetition of the nominative is alledg-
 to be indispensable. This I apprehend to be a great mistake--the
‘nentence is more correct, as well as more easy and familiar, without the

last nominative. So when we pass from the atlirmative to the negative
or from the negative to the afﬁrmative, the subject or nominative is said

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 147

to be always resumed. This is doubtless an egregious error.-—“ He is
rich, but he is not respectable,” is not so-«common a sentence, as, “ He
is rich, but not respectable.” The general rule respecting the ellipsis,
is, that a word may always be suppressed, when the omission occasions
no obscurity or. ambi uity. “ He is indolent, and therefore will be
poor,” is perfectly goo English. But let the rule be put to the test of
authorities. T

“ Not that he is or ever was, obliged by these statutes to call a new
parliament every year.”——Blacks. Com. b. 1. 2.

Is this incorrect? No man will pretend that this is not an authorized
idiom and perfectly correct. And how shall we supply the ellipsis?
Not that he is or he ever was ! What sort of language is this ?

“ For when a man says gold is malleable, he means and would insin-
uate something more than this.”-.-Locke, b. 3. ch. 10. 17.

What necessity is there of repeating the nominative before would I
Not the least. It is impossible to improve the perspicuity of the sentence.

“ That they have contributed and will probably yet contribute in a
considerable degree to the abridgment o the labor.”--.Miller’s Retro-
spect, Vol. 1. 390.

“But whatever they were or are.”——Burhe. Reflections on the Fr.
Rec. 72.

“The whole has been done under the auspices, and is conﬁrmed by
the sanction, of religion and piety.”--Ibm.

“ It has opened and will more and more open their eyes.”——Ihm.

“ If I have been born, or dwell or have served an apprenticeship in one
town.”--Paley. Phil. b. 6. 7. .

“He neither receives nor can give delight.”——Johnson.

“ Cowper’s exhortation—-is not inferior to similar exhortations--in the
accomplished translator of Tansil1o’s poem, the Nurse, by which these
enchantin writers have induced and will continue to induce, so many
mothers,” c.--—Life of Cowper. Will any person say, this latter sen-
tence is not correct? How will the grammarian supply the nominative?
It cannot be done without repeating a part of the preceding clause-—-b
which these enchanting writers have induced, and by which they wi 1
continue to induce-—And of what use is this repetition? ‘Does it add
any thing to the perspicuity or elegance? Not the least. Nothing can
show, in a stronger light, the falsity of the rule.

“The philosopher who hath busied himself in considering their na-
tures, and thinks he knows how far,” &c.--Locke, b. 2. ch. 8. 3.

Here a repetition of the nominative who before thinks, would improve
the structure of the sentence, but is by no means indispensable.

“ These are the fountains of knowled e, from whence all the ideas
we have or can have, do spring.--Locke, . 1 v

“I neither do nor can comprehend all I would.”--Ilzm. 2. 17.

In the two last examples, the repetition of the nominative, instead of
im roving, would impair the structure of the sentences. T
he mischiefs resulting from a vague manner of instituting Grammar
rules, will be fully seen in the perpetual confusion of tenses which
occur in almost every author. We are told that conjunctions connect like

or THE sscmsn LANGUAGE. 1*

None.--The rule laid down by Lowth, and transcribed implicitly by
his followers, is general. “ A substantive Without any article to limit it,
is taken in its widest sense; thus man means all mankind.” The ex-
amples already given prove the inaccuracy of the rule. But let it be
tried by other examples.

“ There are ﬁshes that have wings, and are not stran ers to the airy
regions.”--Locxn, b. 3. ch. 6. 12. If the rule is just, t at ﬁshes is tobe
“ taken in its widest sense,” then all ﬁshes have wings !

“ When ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies’ ’——What! all
armies? “ There shall be signs in ,the sun”-—What I all signs? “ Na-
tion shall rise against nation”-—-VVhat! every nation? How the rule
vanishes before the test!

RULE II.

The deﬁnitive an or a, being merely one, in its English
orthography, and precisely synonymous with it, limits a
common name to an individual of the species—-—its sole use
is to express unity, and with respect to number, is the most
deﬁnite word imaginable-—--as an ounce, a church, a ship,
that is, one ship, one church. It is used before a name,
which is indeﬁnite, or applicable to any one of a species ; as,

“ He bore him in the thickest troop,
As doth a lion in a herd of neat.” Sha/cspeare.

Here a limits the sense of the word lion, and that of herd to
one-—but does not specify the particular one—--“ As any lion
does or would do in any herd.”

This deﬁnitive is used also before names which are deﬁnite
and as speciﬁc as possible; as, “ Solomon built a temple.”
‘E The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden.” Lon-
don is a great commercial city. A decisive battle was fought
at Marengo. The English obtained a signal naval victory
at the mouth of the N ile.*

* “ ./9 respects the primary perception and denotes individuals as 1471--
known--the respects our secondary perceptions and denotes individuals
as known. ./3 leaves the individuals unascertained, whereas the article
the ascertains the individual also.”——-Harris’ Hermes, 215, 217.

“ ./1 has an indeﬁnite signiﬁcation and means one, with some reference
to more.”-——Johnson’s Diet. Grammar. i .

“ J? is used in a vague sense to point out one single thing of the kind,
in other respects z'ndeterminate”——~“ a determines it to be one, single
thing of the kind, leaving it still uncertain which.” .

Lowth’s Introduction.

But let us try this rule. Harris wrote, or rather compiled from Greek

grammarians, “ fl Philosophical Inquiry concerning Universal ‘Gram

tenses and modes—--and whether is a con'unction. Let us see the corn-
sequence, “ If I should ask any one, w ether ice and water were two
distinct species of things.”-——-Locke, 3. 6. 18.

To resolve this sentence by common grammars, we are to say, that
should ask is a verb in the imperfect tense of the subjunctive mode,
whether is a conjunction, and were, a verb connected with ash by that
conjunction. And what sort of language is this--“ If I should ask”--a
eontin ent event or hypothesis--—of course the time future-—-“ Whether
ice an water were, two distinct things,” that is, were, in time past, and
perfectly past; for were by itself never denotes time imperfectly past?

In this way, the author is led to write what he never intended-——sheer
nonsense- The verb was intended to express a fact of general existence
--—one which is always true or false-«that is, the identity or diversity of
ice and water-—-a fact existing in nature, and therefore to be mentioned
in the present tense indeﬁnite--“ Whether ice and water are two dis-
tinct substances.” v

“ It would seem that inquietude was as natural to it as its ﬂuidity.”--~
Golds. ﬂn. Nat. ch. 17. Here is a similar mistake——the use of the first
verb in what is called past time, leading the author to use a second verb
in the same tense--But that is no connective, any more than every sub»
stitute in the language--The inquietude of the ocean is a natural prop-
erty, existing at all times--and the author meant the verb to express
that idea. “ It would seem that inquietude is as natural to the sea as
its ﬂuidity.” To show this to be the real construction, let the order
of the words he changed. “ Inquietude was as natural to the sea as its
ﬂuidity-——that would seem.” This arrangement exhibits the mistake in

its true light. Let the reader attend to the following passages.

“ If’ my readers will turn their thoughts back on their old friends, they
will ﬁnd it difficult to call a single man to remembrance, who appeared
to know that life was short, [is short] till he was about to lose it.’’—--
Rambler, N0. 71.

“ Two more were stationed in Dalmatia, in a situation, if a war broke

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 149

The employment of these verbs by the translator is the less excusable,
as he had the original to guide him to the true sense-—‘.‘ Qua;-——si repen-
tinum auxilium Italia posceret, haud rocul accirentur.” If Italy should
reqétire sudden a.id—--the legions mig t be called from a small distance.

_ xamples of this mistake may be cited without end—but those which
I have collected are amply sufﬁcient to show the miserable state of
grammatical knowledge. How easy would it have been to detect these
blunders, had the parts of speech been understood, and properly classed!
Take for example, the passage from Murray--and resolve it according
to the explanation of that which is given in the preceding pa_ es——“ This
was verse—-a stranger to the poem would not easily discover t at.” What
nonsense ! But correct the verb. ’ ‘.‘ This is verse—-—a stranger would not
easily discover that.” The whole error has arisen probably from con-
sidering that as a conjunction--when in fact it isa representative of the
following ‘member of the period—and the sentence is found to consist of
two clauses——one hypothetical, the other declaratory——“ A stranger to
the poem, (if he should attempt) would not easily discover that-—-this is
verse.”

From the practice of connecting like tenses, probably has arisen a sim-
ilar misapplication of tenses, Where no connective is used ; as, “ In this
way we might indicate which of their elements existed [exists] in ex,-
cess.”——Lavoisicr by Kerr.

“ It would be true gold to him and belong to that species, who include
malleableness in his nominal essence.”——Lockc, 3. 6 35. I

It ought to be who should include. A similar mistake in the follow-
ing passage is really 1udicrous—-“ I said to him that he should rebuild
the Greek cities and give them wise laws, until a proper time arrived to
restore them to 1iberty.”—-éaﬂnacharsis, 3. 231. It ought to be should
arrive.

A few authors, led by their own sense of right and wrong, for surely
they have had no Grammar to guide them,] ave occasional y avoided
these errors and written the language with correctness. And among
these is the translator of Anacharsis, notwithstanding the mistake just
cited.

“ They said that man is an animal.”—-ﬂnach. vol. 4, note.

“ He told us these birds are natives of Samos.”—-Em. ch. 74.

“ Sabellius, who openly taught that there is but one person in the
Godhead.”-—Encyc. art. Sabellius. .

ciple.”---Enﬁeld, Hist. Phil. 1, ch. 8.
“ Anaxagoras aﬂirmed that a pure mind gosems the universe.”

If we examine these sentences, we shall ﬁnd the time correctly

now existing, as well as when the affirmation was made.

I have been the more particular in illustrating this part of my subject,
to show the necessity of tracing the idioms to their true source, of under-
standing the principles of construction, and of calling the parts of speech‘
by their true names.

Punctuation.

Punctuation is the marking of the several pauses which
are to be observed, in reading or speaking a sentence or
continued discourse. By means of pauses, a discourse is di-
vided into periods or complete sentences, and these, into
phrases.

A period is a sentence complete, making perfect sense,
and not connected in construction with what follows. The
pause after the period is marked by a point  and in speak-
ing, is distinguished by a cadence or fall of. the voice.

The members of a period, or clauses and phrases, are all

more or less connected in sense, and according to the near- ‘

ness of the connection, are marked by a comma, [,] a. semi-
colon  or a colon  '

The comma is the shortest pause, and is often used to
mark the construction, where very little interruption of voice
is allowable.

A simple sentence or clause contains an aﬂirmation, a
command or a question, that is, one personal verb, with its
nominative and adjuncts. By atyzmct, is meant any phrase
or number of words added by way of modifying or qualify-

I ing the primary words. Thus when it is said, “ Cicero was

an orator of a dzfuse style,” the latter words, of a diffuse
style, are the adjunct .of.,2a,ra?t0r’,Ca;nd the whole forms a com-
plete simple sentence, Wiw"i..93E mrb or aﬂirmation.

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 151

A phrase contains no assertion, or does not amount to a
proposition. I

COMMA.

RULE I. In general, the parts of a simple sentence or
clause are not to be separated by any point whatever; as
“ Hope is necessary in every condition of life.” But when
a simple sentence is ‘long, or contains a distinct phrase or
phrases, modifying the affirmation, it may be divided by a
comma; as, “ To be very active in laudable pursuits, is the
distinguishing characteristic of a man of merit.” “ By re-
venging an injury, a man is but even with his enemy.” In
most cases, where a short pause will give distinctness to
ideas, a comma is well placed after an important word; “ To
mourn without measure, is folly ; not to mourn at all, insen-
sibility.”

The pause after measure, in this sentence, is essential to
the strength of the expression. “The idea of beauty is
vague and undeﬁned, different in different minds, and diver-
siﬁed by time or place.”-Rambler.

RULE II. When a connective is omitted between two or
more words, whether names, adjectives, pronouns, ‘verbs or
modiﬁers, the place is supplied by a comma; as, “ Love, joy,
peace and blessedness are reserved for the good.” “ The
miseries of poverty, of sickness, of captivity, would, Without
hope, he insupportable.”-—RambZer. “ We hear nothing of
causing the blind to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear,
the lepers to be cleansed.”——Paley. “ He who loves, serves
and obeys his Maker, is a pious man.” “ Industry steadily,
prudently and vigorously pursued, leads to wealth.” “Da-
vid was a brave, martial, enterprising prince.” “ The most
innocent pleasures are the most rational, the most delightful
and the most durable.” ’'

RULE III. Two or more simple sentences closely con-
nected in sense, or dependent on each other, are sepa-
rated by a comma only ; as, “When our vices leave us, we
ﬂatter ourselves we leave them.” “The temperate man’s
pleasures are durable, because they are regular.” “That
all the duties of morality ought to be practised, is without

difficulty discoverable, because ignorance or uncertaintys

would immediately involve the world in confusion and dis-
tress.”--Rambler, Bl.

152 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

RULE IV. The sentence independent or case absolute, de-
tached aﬂirmations or phrases involved in sentences, and
other important clauses, must be separated from the other

parts of a sentence, by a comma; as, “The envoy has re-

turned, his business being accomplished.” “The envoy,
having accomplished his business, has returned.” “Provi-
dence has, I think, displayed a tenderness for mankind.”-—
Rambler. “The decision of patronage, who was but half
a goddess, has been sometimes errone~ous.”—-Rambler. “ The
sciences, after a thousand indignities, retired from the pa]-
ace of patronage.”--—Ibm. “ It is, in many cases, apparent.”
Ibm.

RULE V. A comma is often required to mark contrast,
antithesis, or remarkable points in a sentence, and sometimes
very properly separates words closely dependent in con-
struction; as, “a good man will love himself too well to
lose, and his neighbor too well to win, an estate by gaming.”
“Prosperity gains friends, and adversity tries them.” “It
is harder to avoid censure, than to gain applause.”

“ Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull.”

RULE VI. A single name in apposition is not separated by
a comma;.as, “the Apostle Peter”—-—but. when such name
is accompanied with an adjunct, it should be separated; as,
" Parmenio, a friend of Alexander’s, hearing the great offers
that Darius had made, said, ‘Were I Alexander, I would ac-
cept them..’’’ “So would I, (replied Alexand-er,). were I
Parmenior”

RULE VII. Terms of address, and words of others re-
peated, but not introduced as a quotation, are separated by
a cnmmea; as, “Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer.” “ My
 hear the counsel of thy father.” “ Thus shalt thou say
 ‘lite children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.”

;  us.

RULE VIII. Modifying words and phrases, as, however,
nay, hence, besides, in short, ﬁnally, formerly, &,c.‘are usu-
ally separated  comma; as, “ It is, however, the task of
criticism to establish principles.”-—-Rambler.

SEMICOLON.

The Wmicolen issplaced a between the clauses of a period,
which  less closely connected than such as are separated
by a comma.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 153

First. When the ﬁrst division of a sentence completes a
proposition, so as to have no dependence on what follows,
but the following clause has a dependence on the preceding,
the two parts are separated generally by a. semicolon; as,
“It may be laid down as a maxim, that it is more easy to
take away superﬂuities than to supply defects; and there-
fore he that is culpable, because he has passed the middle
point of virtue, is always accounted a fairer object of hope,
than he who fails by falling short.”—Ramblcr. In this sen-
tence, the part of the sentence preceding the semicolon, is a
perfect period in itself, and might have been closed with a
full point; but the author has added another division, by
way of inference, and this is dependent on the ﬁrst division.
The author proceeds——“ The one has all that perfection re-

» quires, and more, but the excess may be easily retrenched;

the other wants the qualities requisite to excellence.” Here
the ﬁrst division makes a complete proposition; but the an-
tithesis, begun by the numeral one, is not complete, without
the last division.

“Economy is no disgrace; for it is better to live on a lit-
tle, than to outlive a great deal.”

“Be in peace with many; nevertheless, have but one
counselor of a thousand.”

“ A friend cannot be known in prosperity; an enemy can-
not be. hid in adversity.”

In general then, the semicolon separates the divisions of
a sentence, when the latter division has a dependence on
the former, whether the former has a dependence on the lat-
ter or not.

Secondly. When several members of a sentence‘. have; a
dependence on each other, by means of a substitute for. the
same principal word, and the clauses, in other respects, con-
stitute distinct propositions, the semicolon may be used; as,
“Wisdom hath builded, her house; she hath. hewn out her
seven pillars; she hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled
her wine; she hath also furnished her table.”--Prov. 9.

COLON.
The colon is used when the sense of me division of a pe-
riod is complete, so as to admit of a full int, but me-
thing is added by way of illustration; as, “A brute arrives

154 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

at a point of perfection that he can never pass : in a few
years he has all the endowments he is capable of; and were
he to live ten thousand more, would be the same thing he is
at present.”—--Spect. No. 111.

N o'rr:.-—-This point is of little use ; the difference between the colon
and semicolon is so small, that the two pauses are frequentl confounded,
as may be seen in our present version of the Proverbs. ft is said thata
colon should be placed before a quotation ; but I consider the use of the
semicolon as preferable. I conceive the colon might be rejected without
in'ury to the perspicuity of sentences; and punctuation very much sim-
pliﬁed by substituting the semicolon and the full point. That slight de-
pendence of a subsequent sentence upon a preceding one, which is mark-
ed by a colon, is also marked by the full point; for we are not to sup-
pose a full point precludes a connection between sentences. Let the fol-
lowin sentences from the Rambler, No. 31,be cited as an example.

“ ith the great and ambitious, I would discourse of honors and ad-
vancements. To the rich I would tell of inexhaustible treasures and the
sure method to attain them. I would teach them to put out their money
on the best interest, and instruct the lovers of pleasure how to secure
and improve it to the hi best degree. The beaut should learn of me
how to preserve an ever asting bloom. To the a icted I would admin-
ister comfort, and relaxation to the busy.”

All the parts of a continued discourse are connected ; and often by such
nice grades of dependence, that it is not easy to discern, much less to
mark the minute distinctions. I have never examined any author,
whose use of the points is either accurate or uniform ; and in particular
the colon is every where confounded with the semicolon or the period.

PERIOD.

The period or full point marks a completion of the sense,
a cadence of the voice, and the longest pause used between
sentences. It closes a discourse also, or marks the comple-
tion of a subject, chapter or section.

The full point is used also after initials when used alone;
as, after N. S. for New Style; and after abbreviations; as,
Clrac. Anglia. for Crocus Anglicanus.

To these may be added,

The dash -—- which marks a break in the sentence, or an ab-
rupt turn ; as, “ If thou art he-——-but 0 how fallen!”

The interrogation point’! that closes a sentence which
‘asks a question; as, “ How long, ye simple ones, will ye
love simplicity ’!”

The exclamation point ! which is used after sudden ex-
pressions of surprise, or other emotion; as, “O happiness!
our being’s end and aim!” I I

a The parenthesis ( ) and hooks [] include a remark or
clause, not essential to the sentence in construction, but use

ful in explaining it or introducing an important idea. They
mark a moderate pause, and the clause included is read with
a depressed tone of voice; as,

“ Know then this truth (enough for man to’ know)
Virtue alone is happiness below.”--Pope.

It will be readily seen that the sentence is not at all de-
pendent on the parenthetical clause; but the converse is not
true, for that clause has a dependence more or less remote,
on the sentence. Thus, enough for man to know, is not in-
telli ible without connecting it with the parts of the sen-
tencge preceding and following. So in this passage; “If
any one pretends to be so sce tical, as to deny his own ex-
istence, (for really to doubt oIi' it, is manifestly impossible,)
let him enjoy his beloved happiness.”——-Loclce, 4, 10, 2. The
included clause here is connected with the preceding part of
the sentence, and it is a substitute for existence. '

With regard to the duration of the pauses, it may be ob-
served that the comma, semicolon, colon, and full point, may
bear to each other. the proportion of one,'two, three, four,
and _;t1he (interrplgation point and exclarnlationlpoint may. hie
COl'lSl ere eac as equa in time to t e coon or perio .
But no precise rule can be given, which shall extend to
every case; the length of the pauses must depend much on
the nature of the discourse, and their respective proportions
may be often varied to advantage by a judicious speaker.

Prosodg/.*‘

Pnosomz is that part of Grammar which treats of the
pronunciation of words, and the laws of versiﬁcation.

Pronunciation is regulated principally by accent and
quantity.  

Accent is a particular stress of voice with which a certain
syllable of a word is uttered, and by which it is distinguish”-
ed from the others. Thus, in pronouncing probability, we
lay a greater stress of voice upon the third syllable, than

" The substance of the remarks under this head was published more
than forty years a 0. For some of the observations I am indebted to
Sheridan’s Art 0 Reading; but for more of them, to the Honorable
John Trumbull, Esq. one of the judges of the Supreme Court of Con-
necticut. His rules of metrical composition, originally published in my
Grammar, and afterwards in my Dissertations on the English Language,
are probably the best that have been written.

I56 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

upon the others--'-the voice naturally resting upon that, and
passing over the others with rapidity and a slig [enuncia-
tion. This stress of voice on a particular part  word,
is equally necessary to the ease of utterance and the melody
of speaking.

In addition to the accent, which may be called primary,
there is, in pronouncing words of many syllables, a secon-
dary accent, less distinct than the principal accent, but evi-
dently distinguishing some one syllable, from those which
are unaccented. Thus in the word indiscriminate, the prin-
cipal accent is on the third syllable; but the ﬁrst syllable is
evidently uttered with more force of voice, than the second
and last two syllables. The ﬁnal cause of both accents is
the case of pronunciation, and by this should both be regu-
lated; for that manner of pronouncing words which is most
easy for the speaker, enables him to utter the several sylla-
bles with then most distinctness, which is consistent with a
rapid communication, of thoughts; and this is necessary to
render his enuneiation agreeable to his hearers. Hence no
rules of pronunciation drawn from the termination of words,
from their etymologies, ‘ or from the practice of popular
speakers, should be suffered to interfere with this funda-
mental principle, the ease of utterance-——for a forced, un-
natural accent is not only painful to the speaker, but utterly
destructive of melody.

The accent may fall on a vowel or on a consonant.
When it falls on a vowel, the vowel is long; as in glory,
table, lawful. When it falls on a consonant, the consonant
closes the syllable, and the preceding vowel is short; as in
hab’ it, grat’itude, deliv’erance.*

* It may be thought that I am captions in criticising the works of
English authors, or of others who have written on this sub'ect, but the
propriety of detecting error, wherever found, supersedes t e necessity
of apology.

It has been the practice of most English authors to place the marks
of accent, in all cases, over the vowel of the accented syllable——a prac-
tice probably borrowed from the.’ Greek language. Thus in” J ohnson’s
Dictionary, the vowel er in habit, as well as 0 in fully, has the mark of
accent, for which reason the mark is no guide to the true sound of the
letter, and alearner would be led to give to at its long sound thus, habit
--as well as to 0 its long sound in holy. _ _, _

‘ But this is not the worst evil. The usual rules for dividing syllables,
are not only arbitrar , but false and absurd. They contradict the ver
deﬁnition of a syllablie given by the authors themselves. Thus Lowt
deﬁnes a syllable to be “ a sound, either simple or compound, pronounced

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 157

The quantity of a syllable is the time in which it is pro-
nounced. In English this time is long or short-——-long, as in
frame, denote, compensation--short, as in that, niit, mélon.

The accent has no small inﬂuence in determining the
length of a syllable, by prolonging the sound of the vowel;
but, in many words, vowels have their long sound, though
not under the accent; as, nosegay, agitate.

There are some general rules for accenting syllables,
which may be discovered by attending to the analogy of
formation. Thus words ending in tion and sion have the
accent on the last syllable save one; as protection, adhesion:
words ending in ty usually have the accent on the last syllable
except two ; as, vanity, hostility.

Few of these rules however are so general, that the ex-
ceptions to them are not almost as numerous as the words
which fall within the rule; and therefore the accent of words
is best learnt from a dictionary and general usage. The
rules laid down for this purpose in several works of distinc-
tion, are so numerous, and subject to so many exceptions,
that they tend rather to embarrass, than to assist the student.

Most prosodians who have treated particularly of this
subject, have been guilty of a fundamental error, in consid~
ering the movement of English verse as depending on long
and short syllables, formed by long and short vowels. This
hypothesis has led them into capital mistakes. The truth
is, many of those syllables which are considered as long in
verse, are formed by the shortest vowels in the language;
as, strength, health, grand. The doctrine, that long vowels
are necessary to “form long syllables in poetry, is at length

by a single impulse of the voice, and constituting a word or part of
a. word.” But in dividin syllables, no regard is ad to the definition-—--
for manifest Lowth divides thus, ma-ni-fest. Here, the first syllable
man is pronounced with a single impulse of the voice-according to the
deﬁnition ; yet in writing, the syllable is split—-the constituent part of a.
word is divided into two pm-ts—-that which is to be pronounced with It
single impulse of the voice, is so separated, as to require two impulses,
A syllable in pronunciation is an indivisible thing; and strange as it
may appear, whatgis imlivisible in utterance, is divided in writing;
when the very purpose of dividing words into syllables in writing, is to
lead the learner to a just pronunciation. Thus Murray, though be ad-
mits that“ a syllable is short when the accent is on the consonant,” yet
separates that consonant from the syl1able—-«as in me-Ion--ci-vil--ti-mid.
Most of the English elementary books which I have seen are liable to
the same objection.

No'r1a.---When the sense of words is suﬂiciently certain, by the con-

It is also omitted before names whose signiﬁcation is general, and re-
quires no limitation——-as, “ wisdom is justiﬁed of her children”—“ anger
resteth in the bosom of fools.”

The deﬁnitive a is used before plural names, preceded by
few or many--—as, a few days, a great many persons.*‘ It is
also used before any collective word, as, a dozen, a hundred,

he history of this word is briefly this. An and one are the same
:word——an, the Saxon or English orthography, and one a corruption of
the French an or nne. The Greek en, the Latin anus, that is, an with
the usual ending of adjectives, and the Saxon an or ane, are mere dia-
lectical differences of orthography, as are the German ein and the Dutch
een. Before the Conquest, an was used in computation or numbering-
an, twa, threo--one, two, three, &c. ; and the n was used before articu-
lations, as well as before vowels—-“ Ac him seed hyra an”—-But to him
said one of them.—-—-ﬂlfred Orosius, lib. 6.30. y “ ﬁn cyning”——one king.
Sax. Chron. . 82. This Word was also varied to express case and gen-
der, like the atin anus. “ And thaes mb anne monath”——And within
this one month.-—Saa:. Chron. 82. “ T e on tham anum scipe wazeron”
-I-Who were in that one ship.-—-ibm. 98. ﬁn therefore is the original
English adjective or ordinal number one ; and was never writtena until
iaﬁieil-‘rs the Conquest.

itive character of many, which was a noun in the Gothic and Saxon, sy-
n nyrnous wi'tl1.maltitude. .6 many was therefore correct. Its use as
an attribute is secondary or derivative; but this use carries with it the

exploded, and the principles which regulate the movement
of our verse, are explained; viz. accent and emphasis.
Every emphatical word, and every accented syllable, will
form what is called in prose a long syllable. The unaccented
syllables, and unemphatical monosyllabic words, are consid-
ered as short syllables.

But there are two kinds of emphasis; a natural emphasis,
which arises from the importance of the idea conveyed by a
word; and an accidental emphasis, which arises from the
importance of a word in a particular situation.

The first or natural emphasis belongs to all nouns, verbs,
participles and adjectives, and requires no elevation of the
voice; as,

“ Not half so swift the trembling doves can ﬂy.”

The last or accidental emphasis is laid on a word when it
has some particular meaning, and when the force of a sen-
tence depends upon it; this therefore requires an elevation
of the voice; as,

“Perdition catch my soul--—i-but I do love thee.”

So far the prosody of the English language seems to be
settled; but the rules laid down for the construction of verse,
seem to have been imperfect and disputed.

Writers have generally supposed that our heroic verse
consists of ﬁve feet, all pure Iambics, except the ﬁrst foot,
which they allow may be a Trochee. In consequence of
this opinion, they have expunged letters from words which
were necessary; and curtailed feet in such a manner as to
disiigure the beauty of printing, and in many instances, de-
stroyed the harmony of our best poetry.

The truth is, so far is our heroic verse from being con-
ﬁned to the Iambic measure, that it admits of eight feet, and
in some instances of nine. I will not perplex my readers
with a number of hard names, but proceed to explain the
several feet, and show in what places of the line they are
admissible.

An Iambic foot, which is the ground of Englishinumbers,
consists of two syllables, the ﬁrst short and the second long.
This foot is admitted into every place of the line. Example,
all Iambics ;

“Whére slaves iince mﬁre théir native land be-hold,

N6 ﬁends térmént, n6 Christians thirst for gold.”
Pope.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 159

The Trochee is a foot consisting of two syllables, the ﬁrst
long and the second short. Example;

“ Worms in thesun, refreshes III the breeze,
Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees.’ Pope.

The Trochee is not admissible into the second place of the
line; but in the third and fourth it may have beauty, when it
creates a correspondence between the sound and sense.

“ Eve rightly ca1l’d mother of all mankind.”

“ And staggered by the stroke, drops our large ox.”

The Spondee is a foot consisting. of two long syllables
This may be used in any place of the line.

1. “ Good life be now my task, my doubts are done.”
Dryden.
2. “ As some lone moz'mtain’s monstrous growth he stood.”
Pope.
But it has a greater beauty when preceded by a Trochee.
“ Load the toll bdrlc and lanch into the main.”
3. “The mountain goats come bounding o’er the lawn.”
4. ‘p‘ He spoke, and speaking in proud triumph spread
The long contended honors of her head.” Pope.
5. “ Singed are his brows, the scorching lids grow block.”
‘ T Pope.
The Pyrrhic is a foot of two short syllables; it is grace-
ful in the first and fourth places, and is admissible into the
second and third. .
1. “ Nor in the helpless orphan dread a foe.”   Pope.
2. -———--——-—-—-“ On they move,
Indissolilbly ﬁrm.”-—-—-—---——.Mz'lton.
3. “ The two extremes appear like man and wife,
Coupled togethor for the sake of strife.” Churchill.
But this foot is most graceful in the fourth place.
“ The dying gales that pant icpon‘ the trees.”
“ To farthest shores the ambrosial spirit ﬂies,
Sweet to the world and gratefzil to the skies.”

The Amphibrach is a. foot of three syllables, the ﬁrst and
third short, and the second long. It is used in heroic verse
only when we take the liberty to add a short syllable to arline.

“ The piece you say is incorrect, why trike it,

I’m all submission, what you’d have it, mo/co it.”

160 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

This foot is hardly admissible in the solemn or sublime
style. Pope has indeed admitted it into his Essay on Man.

“What. can ennoble sots or slaves or cowards?
Alas! not all the blood of all the Howards.”

Again;
“ To sigh for ribands, if thou art so silly ;
Mark how they grace Lord Umbra or Sir Billy.”
But these lines are of the high burlesque kind, and in this
style the Amphibrach closes lines with great beauty.

The Tribrach is a foot of three syllables, all short; and
it may be used in the third and fourth places.

“ And rolls impetzioies to’ the plain.”

Or thus;
“ And thunders down impeti'wi2s to’ the plain.”

The Dactyl, a foot of three syllables, the ﬁrst long and
the two last short, is used principally in the first place in the
line.

“ I7‘z'uf‘ioi2s he spoke, the angry chief replied.”

“ Mtlrmziring, and with him ﬂed the shades of night.”

The Anapest, a foot consisting of three syllables, the two
first short and the last long, is admissible into every place of
the line.

“ Can 5 bosom so géntlé remain
Unmoved when her Corydon sighs’?
Will a nymph that is fond of the plains,
These plains and these valleys despise l
Dear regions of silence and shade,

Soft scenes of contentment and ease,
Where I could have pleasantly stay’d,
If aught in. her absence could please.”

The trisyllabic feet have suffered most, by the general
ignorance of critics; ‘most of them have been mutilated by
apostrophies, in order to reduce them to the Iambic measure.

Thus in the line before repeated,

“ Murmuring,. and with him ﬂed the shades of night,”
we find the word in the copy reduced to two syllables,
murm’rz'ng, and thebeauty of the Dactyl is destroyed.

Thus in the following,

"t On every side with shadowy squadrons deep,”

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 161

by apostrophizing every and shadowy, the line loses its har-
mony. The same remark applies to the following.

“ And hosts infuriate shake the shudd’ring plain.”
“But fashion so directs, and moderns raise
On fashion’s m0uld’rz'ng base, their transient praise.”

C/zurclzill.

Poetic lines which abound with these trisyllabic feet, are
the most ﬂowingand melodious of any in the language; and
yet the poets themselves, or their printers, murder them with
numberless unnecessary contractions-.

It requires but little judgment and an ear indiﬂerently ac-
curate, to distinguish the contractions which are necessary,
from those which are needless and injurious to the versiﬁca-
tion. In the following passage we ﬁnd examples of both.

“ She went from op’ra, park, assembly, play,
To morning walks and prayers three times a day;
To pass her time ’twixt reading and bohea,
To muse and spill her solitary tea;
Or o’er cold coffee triﬂe with the spoon,
Count the slow clock and dine exact at noon °
Divert her eyes with pictures in the ﬁre, ,
Hum half a tune, tell stories to the ’squire;
Up to her godly garret after sev’n
There starve and pray, for that’s,the way to heav’n.”
Pope’s Epistles.
Here e in opera ought not to be apostrophized, for such a
contraction reduces an Amphibrachic foot to an Iambic.
The Words prayers, seven‘ and heaven need not the apostro-
phe of e; for it makes no difference in the pronunciation.
But the contraction of over and betwixt is necessary; for
without it the measure would be imperfect.

PAUSES.

Having explained the several kinds of feet, and shown in
what places of a verse they may be used, I proceed to an-
other important article, the pauses. Of these there are two
kinds-—the cesural pause, which divides the line into two
equal or unequal parts; and the ﬁnal pause, which closes
the verse. These pauses are called musical, because their
sole end is melody of verse.

14*

I62 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

The pauses which mark the sense, and for this reason are
denominated sentmtial, are the same in verse as in prose.
They are marked by the usual stops, a comma, a semicolon,
-a colon or a period, as the sense requires, and need no par-
ticular explanation. V

The cesural pause is not essential to verse, for the shorter
kinds of measure are without it; but it improves both the
melody and the harmony.

Melody in music is derived from a succession of sounds;
harmony from different sounds in concord. A single voice
can produce melody ; a union of voices is necessary to form
harmony. In this sense harmony cannot be applied to
verse, because poetry is recited by a single voice. But har-~
mony may be used in a ﬁgurative sense, to express the
effect produced by observing the proportion which the mem-‘
bers of verse bear to each other?“

The cesural pause may be placed in any part of the verse;
but has the ﬁnest eﬁeet upon the melody, when placed after
the second or third foot, or in the middle of the third.
After the second;

“In what retreat, inglorious and unknown,
Did genius sleep, when dullness seiz’d the throne '2.”

After the third ;

“ 0 say What stranger cause, yet unexplored,
Could make a gentle belle reject a lord ’!”

Inthe middle of the third;

“ Great are his perils, in this stormy time,
Who rashly ventures, on a sea of rhyme.”

In these examples we ﬁnd a great degree of melody, but
not in all the same degree. In comparing the divisions of
verse, we experience the most pleasure in viewing those
which are equal; hence those verses which have the pause
in the middle of the third foot, which is the middle of the
verse, are the most melodious. «Such is the third example
above. ,"

In lines where the pause is placed after the second foot,
we perceive a smaller degree of melody, for the divisions
are not equal; one containing four syllables, the other six,
as in the ﬁrst example.

L__.

* Sheridan’s Art of Reading.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 163

But the melody in this example, is much superior to that
of the verses which have the cesural pause after the third foot;
for this obvious reason : When the pause bounds the second
foot, the latter part of the verse is the greatest, and leaves
the most forcible impression upon the mind; but when the
pause is at the end of the third foot, the order is reversed.
We are fond of proceeding from small to great, and a cli-
max in sound pleases the ear, in the same manner as a
climax in sense delights the mind. Such is the ﬁrst ex-
ample.

It must be observed further, that when the cesural’ pause
falls after the second and third feet, both the ﬁnal and
cesural pauses are on accented syllables; whereas, when the
cesural pause falls in the middle of the third foot, this is on a.
weak syllable, and the ﬁnal pause on an accented syllable.
This variety in the latter, is another cause of the superior
pleasure we derive from verses divided into equal portions.

The pause may fall in the middle of the fourth foot; as,

“ Let favor speak for others, worth for me :”

but the melody, in this case, is almost lost. At the close of
the ﬁrst foot, the pause has a more agreeable effect.

“ That’s vile ; should we a parent’s fault. adore,
And err, because our fathers err’d before 1"

In the middle of the second foot, the pause may be used,
but produces little melody.

“ And who but wishes to invert the laws
Of order, sins against the eternal cause.”

Harmony is produced by a proportion between the mem-
bers of the same verse, or between the members of differ»
entverses. Example;

“ Thy forests, Windsor, and thy green retreats,
At once the monarch’s and the muse’s seats,
Invite my lays. Be present,sylvan maids,
Unlock your springs, and open all your shades.”

Here we observe, the pause in the first couplet is in the
middle of the third foot; both verses are in this respect sim-
ilar. In the last couplet, the pause falls after the second
foot. In each couplet, separately considered, there is a uni-

formity; but when one is compared with the other, there is I

a diversity. This variety produces a pleasing eﬁ'ect.* The
variety is further increased, when the first lines of several
succeeding couplets are uniform as to themselves, and dif-

ferent from the last lines, which are also uniform as to them-“

selves. Churchill, speaking of reason, lord chief justice in
the court of man, has the following lines;

“ Equally form’d to rule, in age or youth,
The friend of virtue, and the guide to truth;
To her I bow, Whose sacred power I feel,
To her decision make my last appeal ;
Condemn’d by her, applauding words in vain
Should tempt me to take up my pen again ;
By her absolv’d, the course I’ll still pursue;

‘ If Reason’s for me, God is for me too.’ ”

The ﬁrst line of three of these couplets, has the pause
after the second foot; in this consists their similarity. The
last line in three of them, has the pause in the middle of the
third foot; they are uniform as to themselves, but different
from the foregoing lines. This passage, which on the whole
is very beautiful, suffers much by the sixth line, which is not
verse, but rather hobbling proseri

The foregoing remarks are suﬂicient to illustrate the use
and advantages of the cesural pause.

The ﬁnal pause marks the close of a line or verse, wheth-
er there is a pause in the sense or not. ‘Sentential pauses
should be marked by a variation of tone; but the ﬁnal pause,
when the close of one line is intimately connected with the
beginning of the next, should be merely a suspension of the
voice without elevation or depression. Thus;

“ Of man’s first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world, and all our woe,” &c.

* Sheridan. ,
’r Churchill has improved English versiﬁcation, but is sometimes too in-
correct. It is the remark of some writer, “ That the greatest geniuses

are seldom correct,” and the remark is not without foundation. Homer,

Shakspeare and Milton, were among the greatest geniuses that ever liv-
ed, and they were certainly guilty of the greatest faults. Virgil and
Pope were much inferior in point of genius, but excelled in accuracy.
Churchill had genius, but his contempt of rules made him sometimes
indulge a too great latitude of expression.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 165

When these lines are read without a pause after the words
fruit and taste, they degenerate into prose. Indeed in many
instances, particularly in blank verse, the ﬁnal pause is the
only circumstance which distinguishes verse from prose.

EXPRESSION.

One article more in the construction of verse deserves
our observation, which is Expression. Expression consists
in such a choice and distribution of poetic feet as are best
adapted to the subject, and best calculated to impress senti-
ments upon the mind. Those poetic feet, which end in an
accented syllable, are the most forcible. Hence the Iambic
measure is best adapted to solemn and sublime subjects.
This is the measure of the Epic, of poems on grave moral
subjects, of elegies, &c. The Spondee, a foot of twolong
syllables, when admitted into the Iambic measure, adds
much to the solemnity of the movement.

“ While the clear sun, rejoicing still to rise,
In pomp rolls round immeasurable skies.” Dwight.

The Dactyl, rolls round, expresses beautifully the majes-
ty of the sun in his course.

It is a general rule, that the more important syllables
there are in a passage, whether of prose or verse, the more
heavy is the style. For example ;

“ A past, vamp’d, future, old, reviv’d new piece.”
“ Men bearded, bald, cowl’d, uncowl’d, shod, unshod.”

Such lines are destitute of melody, and are admissible
only when they suit the sound to the sense. In the high
burlesque style, of which kind is Pope’s Dunciad, they give
the sentiment an ironical air of importance, and from this
circumstance derive a beauty. ‘On the other hand, a large
proportion of unaccented syllables or particles, deprives lan-
guage of energy; and it is this circumstance principally
which in prose constitutes the difference between the grave
historical, and the familiar style. The greatest number of
long syllables ever admitted into a heroic verse is seven, as
in the foregoing; the smallest number is three  

“ Or to a sad variety of woe.”

"The Trochaic measure, in which every foot closes with a.
weak syllable, is well calculated for lively subjects.

166 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

“ Softly sweet in Lydian measures
Soon he sooth’d his soul to pleasures;
War he sung is toil and -trouble,
Honor but an empty bubble,” &c.

The Anapestic measure, in which there are two short syl-
lables to one long, is best. adapted to express the impetuosity
of passion or action. Shenstone has used it to great advan-
tage in his inimitable pastoral ballad. It describes beauti-
fully the strong and lively emotions which agitate the lover,
and his anxiety to please, which continually hurries him
from one object and one exertion to another.

“ I have found out a gift for my fair,

I have found where the wood pigeons breed;
Yet let me that plunder forbear,

She will say ’twas a barbarous deed.

For he ne’er could prove true, she averr’d,
Who could rob apoor bird of her young :
And I lov’d her the more when I heard

Such tenderness fall from her tongue.”

The Amphibrachic measure, in which there is a long syl-
lable between two short ones, is best adapted to lively comic
subjects; as, in Addison’s Rosamond,

“ Since conjugal passion
Has come into fashion,
And marriage so blest on the throne is,
Like Venus I’ll shine,
Be fond and be ﬁne,
And Sir Trusty shall be my Adonis.”

Such a measure gives to sentiment a ludicrous air, and
consequently is ill adapted to serious subjects.

Great art may be used by a poet in choosing words and
feet adapted to hisgsubject. Take the following specimen.

“ Now here, now there, the warriors fall; amain
Groans murmur, armor sounds, and shouts convulse the
plain.” T
The feet in the last line are happily chosen. The slow
Spondee, in the beginning of the verse, ﬁxesythe mind upon
the dismalscene of woe; the solernnity is heightened by the
pauses in the middle of the second and at the end of the
third foot: But when the poet comes to? shake the plains, he
closes the line with three forcible Iambics. T

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 167

Of a similar beauty take the following example.
“ She all night long, her amorous descant sung.”

The poet here designs to describe the length of the night,
and the music of the nigl1tingale’s song. The first he does
by two slow spondees, and the last by four very rapid syl-
lables.

The following lines, from Gray’s Elegy written in a
Country Church-yard, are distinguished by ahappy choice of
words.

“ For who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,
This pleasing, anxious being e’er resigned,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind ’I’’

The words longing and lingering express most forcibly
the reluctance with which mankind quit this state of exist-
ence.

Pope has many beauties of this kind.

“ And grace and reason, sense and virtue split,
With all the rash dexterity of wit.”

The mute articulations with which these lines end, ex-
press the idea of rencling asunder, with great energy and
effect. The words rash and dexterity are also judiciously
chosen.

In describing the delicate sensations of the most reﬁned
love, he is remarkable for his choice of smooth ﬂowin
words. There are some passages in his Eloisa and Abelard,
which are extended to a considerable length without a sin-
gle mute consonant or harsh word.

OF READING VERSE.

With respect to the art of reading verse, we can lay down
but a few simple rules; but these may perhaps be useful.

1. Words should be pronounced as in prose and in con-
versation ; for reading is but rehearsing another’s conversa-
tion.  

2. The emphasis should be observed as in prose. The
voice should bound” from accent to accent, and no stress

should be laid on little unimportant words, nor on weak syl-
lables.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 15

singular, many, the very essence of which is to mark plu-
rality, will, with a intervening, agree with a name in the
singular number; as,

“ Full many a gem of purest ray serene.” Gray.
“ Where many a rose bud rears its blushing head.”
Beattie.
RULE III.

The deﬁnitive the is employed before names, to limit their
signiﬁcation to one or more speciﬁc things of the kind, dis-
criminated from others of the same kind. Hence the per-
son or thing is understood by the reader or hearer; as. the
twelve Apostles, the laws of morality, the rules of good
breeding.

This deﬁnitive is also used with names of things which
exist alone, or which we consider as single; as, the Jews,
the Sun, the Globe, the Ocean; and also before words when
used by way of distinction; as, the Church, the Temple.

RULE IV.

The is used rhetorically before a name in the singular
number, to denote the whole species, or an indeﬁnite num-
ber; as, “the jig-tree putteth forth her green ﬁgs.”--Sol.
Songs.

, “ The almond-tree shall ﬂourish, and the grasshopper shall
be a burden.”—--“ Or ever the silver cord shall be loosed-—
or the golden bowl be broken,” &:c.—-—Ecclesiastes.

“ There loaded camels move in solemn state,
And the huge elephant’s unwieldy weight.”
Hoole’s Tasso, b. 15.

“ For here the splendid treasures of the mine,
And richest offspring of the ﬁeld combine.”
Lusiad, 2.

“ The Christian, who, with pious horror, avoided the abom-
inations of the circus or the theatre, found himself encom-
passed with infernal snares,” &c.—-Gib. Rom. Emp. ch. 15.

“ The heart likes naturally to be moved and affected.”—--
C'ampbell’3 Rhet. ch. 2.

N on: 1.-——This deﬁnitive is also used before names employed ﬁgura-
tively in a general sense; as,
“ His mates their safety to the waves consign.” I/usiad, 9.

3. The sentential pauses should be observed as in prose;
these are not affected by the kind of writing, being regula-
ted entirely by the sense. But as the cesural and ﬁnal paus-
es are designed to increase the melody of verse, the strict--
est attention must be paid to them in reading. They mark
a suspension of i voice without rising or falling.

To read prose well, it is necessary to understand what is
read; and to read poetry well, it is further necessary to un-
derstand the structure of verse. For want of this knowl-
edge, most people read all verse like the Iambic measure.
The following are pure Iambics.

“ Above how high progressive life may go!
Around how wide, how deep extend below!”

It is so easy to lay an accent on every second syllable,
that any school-boy can readvthis measure with tolerable
propriety. But the misfortune is, that when a habit of read-
ing this kind of meter is once formed, persons do not vary
their manner to suit other measures. Thus in reciting the
following line, -

“ Load tketall bark, and lanch into the main,”

many people would lay the accent on every second syllable;
and thus read, our poetry becomes the most monotonous
and ridiculous of all poetry in the world.

Let the following line be repeated without its pauses, and
it loses its principal beauty.

“ Bold, as a hero, as a virgin mild.”
So in the following.

“ Reason, the card, but passion, is the gale.”

“ From storms, a shelter, and from heat, a shade.”

The harmony is, in all these instances, improved much
by the semi-pauses, and at the same time the sense is more
clearly understood.

Considering. the difiiculty of reading verse, it is not sur-
prising to ﬁnd but few who are proﬁcients in this art. A

“knowledge of the structure of verse, of the several kinds of

feet, bf the nature and use of the ﬁnal, the cesural and the
semia-cesural pauses, is essential to a graceful manner of
reading poetry; and even this, without the best examples,
will hardly effect the purpose. It is for this reason that
children should not be permitted to read poetry of the more
difficult kind, without the best examples for them to imitate

or a sing song cant, which, when grown into a habit, is

Critical Notes.

“ I persecuted this Way unto the death.”—-Acts 22. 4.

As no particular sort of death is here intended, the deﬁni-
tive the ought to have been omitted.-—-Lowth.

“ When he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
into all truth.”-—John 16. 13. ‘

As the sense is probably all evangelical truth, and not
other kinds of truth, Lowth supposes the deﬁnitive the ought
to have been used; all the truth, agreeable to the original
Greek. This criticism is probably just; but the student
must be cautious of following implicitly the use of the Greek
article; for nothing is less determinate’! and Lowth himself
acknowledges that it has puzzled all the grammarians to re-
duce the use of it to any clear and certain» rules. In the
New Testament, it is often used in passages where it is not
admissible in an English translation. Matt. 3. 8, “Bring
forth therefore fruitsmeet for repentance ;” in the Greek,
worthy of the repentance. Verse 11, “Whose shoes I am
not worthy to bear;” in the original, whose the shoes. In
the same verse, “He shall baptize you with the Holy
Spirit;” in the original, with Holy Spirit. Matt.— 18. 8,
“ It is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed ;” in
the original, into the life. Same chapter, verse 2, “And
Jesus called a little child unto him ;” in the original, there
is no deﬁnitive--And Jesus calling child. Verse 3, “Ex-
cept ye be converted and become as little children ;” in the

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 173

original, as the children. Matt. 22. 13, “There shall be
weeping and gnashing of teeth ;” in the original, there shall
be the [or this] weeping——and the gnashing of the teeth. Ch.
24. 3, “ Upon the mount of the olives.” Rom. '7. 1,
“Know ye not, brethren, [for I speak to them that know
the law,] how that the law ;” in the original, I speak to them
that know law. Verse 2, “ For the woman that hath a hus-
band is bound by the law ;” in the original, bound by law.
Verse 8, “For without the law, sin was dead ;” in the ori-
ginal, without law. Verse 21, “ I ﬁnd there a law ;” in the
original, I ﬁnd there the law. A multitude of similar pas-‘
sages might be cited to prove how little is the analogy be-
tween the Greek and English languages, in regard to the use
of the deﬁnitives.

But to place this fact in a stronger light, let it be observed
that the Greeks use both the article or deﬁnitive in conjunc-
tion with the pronoun thz's—--that is, two deﬁnitives with the
same word. Rom. 7. 24, “Who shall deliver me from the
body of this death?” in the original, from the body of the
this death, or the death this. Matt. 4. 3, “ If thou art the
Son of God, command that these stones be made bread ;” in
the original, the these stones. This is a common idiom of
the Greek, and one utterly repugnant to the genius of the

English.

Equally singular is the use of the Greek article before
proper names. Matt. 2. 22, “ He turned aside into the parts
of Galilee;” in. the original, into the parts of the Galilee.
Chap. 17. 1, “ Jesus taketh Peter ;” in the original, the Pe-
ter. Chap. 3. 1, i

“Preaching in the wilderness of Judea;” orig. of the
Judea.

We cannot therefore draw any general inference, , res-

pecting the extent of the signiﬁcation of words in English,

from the use of the Greek article. Indeed, there are many
cases where this article must be omitted, or utterly pervert
the true meaning. ’Matt. 11. 8, “Behold, they that wear
soft clothing are in kings’ houses ;” in the original, in the
houses of the kings. Ver. 11, “ Among them that are born
of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the
Baptist ;” in the original, them that are born of the women.
In other cases, the English the must be used where no
article is found in the Greek; as in Matt. 11. 5, “The blind
receive theirlsgghta-the lame walk--the lepers are cleansed

174 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

--—and the deaf hear.” Here is no article in the Greek, but
in English it cannot be omitted, except before lepers.

Of the arbitrary and uncertain proof of the deﬁnite article,
the French language furnishes abundant proof.

“ L’avarice est de tous les vices, le plus odieux.”
The avarice is the most hateful of all vices.

“Le gouvernment doit avant toutes choses protéger les
proprietes.” The government ought before all things to
protect the properties. “Theophraste loue l’hospitalité et
il a raison.” Theophrast praises the hospitality, and he has
reason. ‘ Barret. Trans. of Cicer. de Of‘.

The use of the le before names of general application, is
wholly arbitrary and useless, but established by custom.

Some author, I think Blair, boasts of the superiority of
the English over the Latin language, in the use of articles.
This is a great error. The Latin units is the English (172--
and is, ille, hie, answer all the purposes of the, this and that.
The Romans used these deﬁnitives when they wanted them,
nor is any part of their writings left obscure for Want of
other articles.

“ Truly, this was the Son of God.” Matt. 27, 54. Lowth
supposes that the should be a, as this was spoke by a pagan
who probably believed in a plurality of Gods.

So also in Dan. 3. 25.

In this passage, “ About an eight days,”—-«Luke 9. 28,-—-an

“ Nevertheless, Asa his heart was perfect with the Lord.”

solete.

tive is admissible only in the comic and burlesque style.-—

In popular practice, that and this are often followed by
there and here-—that there. house ; this here tree. This idiom
is robably as old as language, and is not a corruption. It
existed in the Celtic--an tigh ad, that house there; and the
French has preserved it-—-Cet maison la. It may have
had its origin in the poverty of the primitive languages of
the world, or it" may have proceeded from the practice of
pointing to objects described, or from the Saxon genitive of

this, thissere; but in the improved style of modern lan-
guage, it is unnecessary, and in English, is conﬁned to the
vulgar and colloquial style.

“ I had rather,” is probably a mistake for “ I would rath-
er,” but the error, at least in colloquial language, seems in-
corrigible.

“The rules of our religion, from which we are swerv-
ed.”-—Tillotson. The passive form of swerve is obsolete.
“ Flee thee away”-—-“ Was entered into a conspiracy”--“ To
vie charities”--“ Take pains to agree the sacred and pro-
fane chronology”—-are incorrect; for intransitive verbs do
not admit the passive form, nor an object after them.

Succeed, though numbered among intransitive verbs, has
obtained a general use in a transitive sense—-“ Succeed the
means of grace,” is the customary language o—f divines, and
Well authorized.

“ If Jove this arm succeed.” Pope.

In the words abed, ashore, &c. and before the participles
acoming, ageing, ashooting, a has been supposed a contrac-
tion of on or at. It may be so in some cases; but with the
participles, it is sometimes a contraction of the Saxon preﬁx
ge, and sometimes perhaps of the Celtic ag.

“ In him who is, and him who ﬁnds, a friend.” Pope.

Lowth condemns this use of a noun in the nominative and
objective at the same time; but without reason, as the cases
are not distinguished in English. -

In the use of mistaken, there is a singularity which de-
serves notice. When applied to persons,"it is equivalent to
being wrong or in an error. “ I am mistaken-—you are mis-
taken ;” mean, I am in an error-you are in an error. But
applied to things, it signiﬁes misunderstood; his words or
opinions are mistaken, that is, misunderstood.

As used for that in the following sentence, and in similar
cases, Lowth condemns as improper or obsolete--“ the rela-
tions are so uncertain as they require a great deal of exam-
ination.”--Bacon. This use of as is obsolete; but is genu-
ine English.

It is a popular mistake to use wives for the possessive

We sometimes hear the strongest of the two, used for the
stronger of the two. In such cases, the comparative degree
is the more correct.

Then and above are often used as attributes; the then min-
istry; the above remarks; nor would I proscribe this use.
It is well authorized and very convenient.

Johnson observes, “A has a peculiar signiﬁcation, de-
noting the proportion of one thing to another ; as, theland-
lord hath a hundred a year.” But the only peculiarity of
this use is, that no preposition is employed; a hundred a
year, for a hundred in a year or for a year-—a dollar a day,
instead of a dollar for a day._

Averse, in Lowth’s opinion, should be followed by from;
but why, any more than repugnant or unwilling? Prac-
tice has established the use of to, with propriety.

The verb lag is often used for lie—-—I will lay down. Lay
is transitive—-I will lay myself down. When no object fol-
lows, the intransitive verb lie should be used; let him lie
down.

The word rather is used to express a small degree of ex-
cess; “ She is rather profuse in her expenses.” In like man-
ner is used full; “ the coffee is full strong.”--—Priestley.

The signiﬁcation of words in construction, sometimes de-
pends on the tone of voice with which they are uttered ; thus,
“ I cannot ﬁnd one of my books,” if uttered without any pe-
culiar force of voice upon one, means that one of my books
is missing. But with an emphasis upon one, it means that
all are missing. Thus, if I say “ No laws are better than

In the following sentence, an important distinction is made
by the deﬁnitive a--“ He behaves with a little reverence.”
This is positive, and rather praises than dispraises ; but omit-
ting a—-“ He behaves with little reverence,” and I rather dis-
praise the person. Thus, when I say “ There were few men
present,” I speak of the number as inconsiderable by way of
diminution-—-—But there were a few men present, I intend to
represent the number in the most favorable light.--—Priestley.

There are many grammatical errors in the writers of the
16th and 17th centuries, which Lowth, Priestley, Blair, and
Campbell have enumerated in their respective Works, and
many of them are copied into Murray’s Grammar. But the
greatest part of them are now so perfectly obsolete, that stu-
dents are in no danger of learning them, either from books
or common practice ; and it seems to be inexpedient to swell
the size of a modern grammar, by criticisms upon modes of
writing no longer used.

CONCLUSION.

In the preceding pages, I have attempted to unfold the
true principles of construction in the English language. It
is probably the ﬁrst correct analysis of many sentences ever
attempted. The following observations and examples will
show that the same or a similar analysis is necessary to ex-
plain the true construction of sentences in other languages.

Orda vyocg oer: aux once: sv spot, troucr ssw ev crou dagm prov, ayaéov.
‘‘ For I know that in me, that is, in my ﬂesh, dwelleth no
good thing.”

In this sentence, the Greek 041, that, is called a conjunc-
tion, as that is in English. This is a mistake ; 04': is a pro-
noun relative or substitute for the following part of the sen-
tence. The sentence is to be thus resolved——“ In me, that
is, in my ﬂesh, dwelleth no good thing ;” that I know, or I
know that. I know the fact stated in the whole of that part
of the sentence which in Greek follows on. Similar is the
use of on in most other cases. This pronoun, like quod in
Latin, and that in English, is to be considered as of neuter
gender ; and never varied for expressing number. The rea-
son is obvious; when such words represent or refer to, sen-
tences, no variation is necessary.

Homo autem, quod rationi-s est particeps, per quam con-
sequentia cernit, facile totius vitae cursum videt.--C'icero de
Of. ca. 4. The literal construction of this sentence is, “ But
man, that he is a partaker of reason, readily sees the whole
course of life.”  

We are accustomed to call quod a conjunction, and per-
haps because it seems to have no word to govern it. But

Here waves cannot be understood of any particular waves; but the
Word is a metaphor for a particular thing, the ocean.
In addresses and exclamations, the deﬁnitive may be, and usually is,
omitted ; as, “ Sink down, ye mountains, and, ye valleys, rise.”
“Be smooth, ye rocks; ye rapid ﬂoods, give way.” Pope, Mes.
“Granville commands; your aid, 0 Muses, bring.” Wind. Forest.

Nora 2.-—The deﬁnitive the is used before an attribute, which is se-
lected from others belonging to the same object; as,“ The very frame of’
spirit proper for being diverted with the laughable in objects, is so dif-
ferent j  that which is necessary for philosophizing on them."-—
Campbcll, Rhet. 1. 2.

Asmen have occasion to speak of a single object, or of

itwoor more individuals of the same kind, it has been found

necessary to vary the noun or name, and usually the termi-
nation, to distinguish plurality from unity. The different
forms of words to express one or more are called in gram-
mar, numbers ; of which there are, in English, two, the sin-
gular and the plural. The singular denotes an individual,
or a collection of individuals united in a body; as, a man, a
ship, an oﬂice, a company, a society, a dozen. The plural
denotes two or more individuals, not considered as a collec-
tive body; as, men, ships, oﬂices, companies, societies. The
plural number is formed by the addition of s or es to the
singular.

RULE 1. When the terminating letter of a noun will ad-
mit the sound of s to coalesce with the name or the last syl-
lable of it, s only is added to form the plural ; as, sea, seas;
hand, hands; pen, pens; grape, grapes; vale, Vales; vow,
vows.

2. When the letter .9 does not combine in sound with the
word or last syllable of it, the addition of 3 increases the
number of syllables; as, house, houses; grace, graces;
page, pages; rose, roses; voice, voices; maze, mazes.

3. When the name ends in X, ss, sh, or ch with its English
sound, the plural is formed byadding es to the singular;
for a single 3 after those letters cannot be pronounced ; as,
fox, foxes; glass, glasses ; brush, brushes; church, churches.
But after eh with its Greek sound, like It, the plural is form-
ed by s only ; as monarch, monarchs.

is When a name ends with 3; after a consonant, the plu-
rel  formed by dropping y and adding ies ,- as, vanity, van-
ities. Alkali has a regular plural, allcalies.

usage constitutes the correctness of the phrase, and no other
rule of government is necessary; it is the only rule of cor-
rect language in all cases. Quad we render by because, or
as, or since; but in this use, quad expresses cause, reason,
or purpose, in a brief idiomatic form, and is really the rela-
tive pointing to "the following part of the sentence. It is
perhaps elliptically used, for per quad.

In unfolding the structure of sentences, it would be useful
to the tyro, to resolve compound words into their component
parts. Thus quamobrem, is guam ob rem, or ob quam rem ;
guare, is qua and re, in the ablative; interea, is inter ea;
prwterea, is prceter ea; qualibet, is guam or quad libet;
quamvis, is quam and vis; quaqua, a duplication of the rela-
tive in the ablative.

The principles explained in this work throw much light
on what are called impersonal verbs. As it is written in
the prophets, “ Behold I send my messenger before thy face,
who shall prepare thy way before thee.”——Mark 1. 2. Here
the whole passage cited is the nominative to 7/8';/gaarrott, that
is written in the prophets. In English it--precedes the
verb, but, as has been observed, it is the representative of the
sentence which follows.

“ Sed animadvertendum est diligentius, qua natura re-
rum sit.”——C'icero de Of. lib. 2. 20. Here the last member
of the sentence is the real nominative to the verb est-—-what
is the nature of things, is to be considered.-—It is observable
that in this form of construction, where a sentence or mem-
ber is the nominative, the participle or attribute is of the
neuter gender.”"

“ Quamquam te, Marce ﬁli, annum jam audientem Cratip-
pum, idque Athenis, abundare oportet praaceptis institutisque,
philosophia3.”—-—Ibm., l. 1. “ Although, Marcus, it behooves
you, who have now attended Cratippus a year at Athens, to
be well furnished with the precepts and maxims of philoso-
phy.”—'--Here the last part of the sentence is really the nom-
inative to oportet. To be well initiated in the principles of
philosophy becomes you, my son, who enjoy the advantage
of the institutions of Cratippus, at Athens, the seat of sci-
ence and the arts. The same remark is applicable to licet,

nub muris.” It was ought under the walls.

lcbet, lubet, placet, &c. “ Si placet tibi audire”-—-if to hear
pleases you.

But the French exceeds all languages in the number of V

nouns, verbs and adjectives, which are thrown into the com-
mon sink of adverbs, conjunctions and prepositions. Thus
autre fois, azg°ourd’huz', cependant, auteur, autant, pourquoi,
pent étre, are denominated adverbs——-autant gue, pourvu que,
a condition que, de sorte que, pendant gue are called con-
junctions——concernant, suivant, attendu, joignanf, pendant,
ezcepté, all regular verbals or participles, are classed among
the prepositions. Yet it would be far better to resolve all
words and phrases according to their original principles, as
far as it can be done. “ Il est, pent étre, diﬂicile de ranger
sous l’ordre de la nature, la divination qui vient de l’art et
de l’etude.”——-Zlforabins, Trans. Cic. de Divin. lie. 1.

It is difficult to rank, in the order of nature, the divination
which proceeds from art and study—-all this—-——peut étre--—
may be. In strictness, the Whole sentence or proposition
which is aﬂirmed to be possible, is the nominative to pent
étre. Ce pendant——that pending, admitting that to be the
fact, is the case absolute or independent. Pendant gate, that
depending, during that——pourvu que—-that being provided.
—-“ J ’ai quelque chose a vous dire concernant cette alfaire.”
I have something to say to you, concerning that affair.
Here concerning retains its verbal signiﬁcation, as in Eng-
lish, and relates to or agrees with the preceding part of the
sentence. “ J’obeis suivant vos ordres.” I obey, follow-
ing your orders. “ Il travaille toute la semaine ezcepté le
dimanche.” He labors the whole week, Sunday e:ccepted—--
that is, Sunday being excepted——the case independent.--—
Parce que-—because--that is, for that which follows-—Parce
gue il pretend qu il y a dans la nature des signes des choses
--Par the preposition, ce the pronoun or deﬁnitive, and quc
the substitute representing the following part of the sentence.
“ Soit qu’ il parte ou qu’ il demeure.” Whether he goes or
stays-—that is, Be it, soit que—-—be that fact which is express-
ed by il parte--que is a substitute‘ or relative referring to the
following aﬂirmation——z'l parte——and the nominative to soit.
In the second member of the sentence soit is understood
before que. ~

The sentence fully expressed would stand thus; soit que
——-il parte; ou soit que, il demeure. Be that, he goes; or,
be that, he remains.

“ Qui a fait qua j’ai trouvé grace devant Ie roi.” Literal-
ly, who hath made that I have found favor before the king.
But let the clauses of the sentence be transposed. “ I have
found favor before the king; who hath made or caused that.”

Mais pendant que les hommes dormoient. But while men
slept; literally, but pending that men slept. Here gue relates
to the last words, les hommes dormoient.-—Matt. 13.

Pourvu qua j’acheve avec joie ma course. Provided that,
I may [or might] ﬁnish my course with joy. Here pourvu
is a participle, which with que, constitutes the case absolute,
or independent sentence ; and gate, the relative, refers to the
following part of the sentence.--Acts 20.

These criticisms, already extended to an inconvenient
length, considering the limited nature of this work, may
serve to show the reader how artiﬁcial and arbitrary are the
distribution and denominations of the several species of
words, in our grammars, and how ill calculated are the com-
mon rules to illustrate the origin or the true principles of
language. Before a language can be correctly understood,
words must be traced to their source, their radical signiﬁca-
tions explained, their mutations, contractions, and combina-
tions, developed. a It is not the English language only whose
history and principles are yet to be illustrated; but the
grammars and dictionaries of all other languages, with which
I have any acquaintance, must be revised and corrected, be-

fore their elements and true construction can be fully un-

derstood.

foreigner an odd irregularity 3 but the cause is very obvious. Formerly
the singular number of this class of words ended with ie ; as, glorie, van-

from caprice, negli ence, or a desire to simplify the orthography, the
termination ie was aid aside for y in the singular, while the old plural 532:

which the progreés pf‘ our language exhibits. T i

common discourse; brethren, in the scripture style, but is
not restricted to it.

Clzerubim and seraphim are real Hebrew plurals; but
such is the propensity in men to form regular inﬂectiorrs in
language, that these words are used as in the singular, with
regular plurals, cherubims, seraphims. In like manner, the
Hebrew singulars, cherub and seraph, have obtained regular
plurals. V

The inﬂuence of this principle is very obvious in other
foreign words, which the sciences have enlisted into our ser-
vice; as may be observed in the words radius, focus, index,
&c. which now begin to be used with regular English plural
terminations. This tendency to regularity is, by all means,
to be encouraged; for a prime excellence in language is the
uniformity af its inflections. The facts here stated will be
evinced by a few authorities.

In authorities equally’ respectable, we ﬁnd stamens, stra-
tums, funguses; and in pursuance of the principle, we
may expect to see lamens for laminae; lamels for lamellaa;
baryte for barytes ; pyrite for pyrites; strontite for stron-
tites; stalactites for the plural stalactites. These reforms
are necessary to enable us to distinguish the singular from
the plural number. i

CLASS 3. The third class of irregulars consists of such
as have no plural termination; some of which represent
ideas of things which do not admit’ of plurality; as, rye,
barley, ﬂax, hemp, ﬂour, sloth, pride, pitch, and the names

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 19

of metals, gold, silver, tin, zink, antimony, lead, bismuth,
quicksilver. When, in the progress of improvement, any
thing, considered as not susceptible of plurality, is found to
have varieties, which are distinguishable, this distinction
gives rise to a plural of the term. Thus in early ages our
ancestors took no notice of daiﬂerent varieties of wheat, and
the term had no plural. But modern improvements in ag-
riculture have recognized varieties of this grain, which have
given the name a plural form. The same remark is appli-
cable to fern, clay, marl, sugar, cotton, &c. which have plu-
rals, formerly unknown. Other words may hereafter under-
go a similar change. »

Other words of this class denote plurality, without a plu-
ral termination; as, cattle, sheep, swine, kine,*deer, hose;
trout, salmon, carp, perch, and many other names of ﬁsh.
Fish has a plural, but is used in the plural sense without the
termination; as,

“ We are to blame for eating these ﬁsh.”
Anacharsis, 6. 272.

“ The ﬁsh reposed in seas and crystal ﬂoods,

The beasts retired in covert of the woods.”
Hoale, T. 2. 726.

Cannon, shot and sail, are used in a plural sense; as,

“ One hundred cannon were landed from the ﬂeet.”
Burchett, Naval Hist. 73?.

“ Several shot being ﬁred.”—-Ibm. 455.
“Several sail of ships.”-—17)m. 426.

In the sense in which these Words are-here used, they
hardly admit of a plural ending.

Under this class may be noticed a number of words, ‘ex-
pressing time, distance, measure, weight and number, which,
though admitting aplural termination, are often, not to say
generally., used without that termination, even when used
with attributes of plurality ; such are the names in these ex-
pressions, two year, ﬁve mile, ten foot, seven pound, three
tun, hundred, thousand, or million, ﬁve bushel, twenty
weight, &c. Yet the most unletteredpeople never say, two
minute, three hour, ﬁve day, or week, or month; nor two
inch, yard or league; not three ounce, grain, "dram, or peck.

We observe this practice in the Saxon Chronicle. “ He
heold that Arcebisceop-rice 18 year.”-—p. 59. He held that
archbishopric eighteen year. In that work, winter is used

in the same manner; forty-one winter-—p. 41. Yet year i

and ‘winter had, in the Saxon, plural terminations. But this
use is considered as vulgar.

A like singularity is observable in the Latin language.
“ Tritici quadraginta millia modium.”—-—Liv. lib. 26. 47 . For-
ty thousand modium of wheat. “ Quatuor millia pondo auri,”
four thousand pound of gold.——Ibm. 27. 10.

Here we see the origin of our pound. Originally it was
merely weight-—-four thousand of gold by weight. From
denoting weight generally, panda became the term for a cer-
tain division or quantity; retaining however its signiﬁcation
of unity, and becoming an indeclinable in Latin. Twenty
pound then, in strictness, is twenty divisions by weight; or,
as We say, with a like abbreviation, twenty weight.

The words horse, foot and infantry, comprehending bod-
ies of soldiers, are used as plural nouns, and followed ‘by
verbs in the plural. Cavalry is sometimes used in like man-
ner.

CLASS 4. The fourth class of irregular- nouns consists of
words which have the plural termination only. Some of
these, denoting plurality, are always joined with verbs in the
plural; as thefollowing:

Annals drawers lees customs
archives downs lungs shears
ashes dregs matins scissors
assets embers mallows shambles
bitters entrails orgies tidings
bowels fetters nippers tongs
compasses ﬁlin s pincers or thanks
clothes 00 s pinchers Vespers
calends hatches pleiads vitals
breeches ides . snuifers victuals

Letters,‘ in the sense of literature, may be added to the
foregoing list. Manners, in the sense of behavior, is also
plural. . .

Other words of this class, though ending In s, are used
either wholly in the singular number, or in the one or the
other, at the pleasure of the writer.

riches optics tactics

Of these, pains, riches, and wages”“ are more usually con-
sidered as plural——news is always singular-—odds and means
are either singular or plural-—the others are more strictly
singular ; for measles is the name of a disease, and, in strict-
ness, no more plural than gout or fever. Small pox, for
poclcs, is sometimes considered as a plural, but it ought to
be used as singular. Billiards has the sense of game,“ con-
taining unity of idea; and ethics, physics and other similar
names, comprehending each the whole system of a particu-
lar science, do not convey the ideas of parts or particular
branches, but of a whole collectively, a unity, and hence
seem to be treated as words belonging to the singular num-
ber.

Means is so generally used in either number, (every means,

GENDER.

Gender, in grammar, is a difference of termination, to ex-
press distinction of sex.

There being two sexes, male and female, words which
denote males are said to be of the masculine gender; those
which denote females, of femim'ne gender. Words ex-
pressing things without sex, are said to be of neuter gender.
There are therefore but two genders; yet for convenience,
the neuter is classed with the genders ; and we say there are
three, the masculine, feminine and neuter. The English
modes of distinguishing sex are these :

1. The regular termination of the feminine gender is ess ;
which is added to the name of the masculine ; as, lion, lion-
ess. But when the word ends in or, the feminine is formed
by retrenching a vowel, and blending two syllables into one;
as, actor, actress. In a few words, the feminine gender is
represented by in: ; as, testatrix, from testator ; and a few oth-
ers are irregular. The following are most’ of the words
which have a distinct termination for the feminine gender :

Actor actress deacon deaconess
abbot abbess duke duchess
adulterer adultress embassador embassadress
baron baroness emperor « empress
benefactor benefactress tiger tigress
overnor governess son gster songstress
ero eroine seamster seamstress

heir heiress viscount viscountess
peer peeress jew jewess

priest priestess lion lioness

poet poetess master mistress
prince princess marquis marchioness
prophet prophetess patron patroness
shepherd shepherdess protector protectress
sorcerer sorceress executor executrix
tutor tutoress testator testatrix
instructor instructress elector electress
traitor traitress administrator adrninistratrix
count countess

2. In many instances, animals, with which we have most
frequent occasions to be conversant, have different words to

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 23

express the different sexes; as, man and woman; brother
and sister; uncle and aunt; son and daughter; boy and
girl; father and mother ; horse and mare; bull and cow.

I Man however is a general term for the whole race of
mankind; so also, horse comprehends the whole species.
A law to restrain every man from an offence would compre-
hend women and boys; and a law to punish a trespass com-
mitted by any horse, would comprehend all mares and colts.
In like manner, goose, though originally the name of the fe-
male, is used generally for the whole species; as is the plural
geese.

3. When words have no distinct termination for the female
sex, the sexes are distinguished by preﬁxing some word indi-
cating sex; as, a male rabbit, a female opossum; a he goat,
a she goat; a man servant, a maid servant ; a male coquet; a
female warrior ; ya cock-sparrow, a hen-sparrow.

4. In all cases, when the sex is sufficiently indicated by a.
separate word, names may be used to denote females with-
out a distinct termination. Thus, although females are rare-
ly soldiers, sailors, philosophers, mathematicians, or chimists,
and we seldom have occasion to say, she is a soldier, or an
astronomer; yet there is not the least impropriety in the
application of these names to females, when they possess the
requisite qualiﬁcations ; for the sex is clearly marked by the
word she or female, or the appropriate name of the woman ;
as, “ Joan of Arc was a warrior.” “ The Amazons were a.
nation of female warriors.”—-Ency. art. Amazonsﬁ‘

5. Although the English language is philosophically cor-
rect in considering things without life as of neither gender,
yet by an easy analogy, the imagination conceives of inani-
mate things as animated and distinguished by sex. On this
fiction, called personiﬁcation, depends much of the descrip-
tive force and beauty of poetry.

“ Indus or Ganges rolling his broad wave.” Akensicle.
“ There does the soul
Consent her soaring fancy to restrain.” Ibm.

* The termination or in Latin is a contraction of ver, a man ; as er in
English i of war, the same word in Saxon. But in common under-
standing, the idea of gender is hardly attached to these terminations ; for
we add er to words to denote an agent without life; as, grater, heater.

CASE.

Gase in grammar denotes a variation of words to express
the relation of things to each other. In English, most of
the relations are expressed by separate words; but the rela-
tion of property, ownership or possession, is expressed by
adding 3 to a name, with an apostrophy ; thus, John’s book ;
which words are equivalent to “the book of John.” This
is called the Possessive Case. In English therefore names
have two cases only, the novninative or simple name, and
the possessive. The norninative before a verb, and the. ob-
jective after a verb, are not distinguished by inﬂections, and
are to be known only by position or the sense of the pas-
sage.

When the letter s, added as the sign of the possessive,
will coalesce with the name, it is pronounced in the same
syllable; as, Jolm’s. But if it will not coalesce, it adds a
syllable to the word; as, Thomas’s bravery, pronounced as
if written fI7zomasz's--the church’s prosperity, churckis
prosperity. These examples show the impropriety of re-
trenching the vowel; but it occasions no inconvenience to
natives.

When words end in es or 3.9, the apostrophy is added
Without e; as, on eagles’ wings; for righteousness’ sake.

PRONOUNS OR SUBSTITUTES.

Substitutes or pronouns are of two kinds; those which
are used in the place of the names of persons only, and may
be called personal; and those which represent names, at-
tributes, a sentence or part of a sentence, or a series of pro~
positions.

 The pronouns which are appropriate to persons, are, I,
thou, you, he, she, we, ye, and who.

I is used by a speaker to denote himself, and is called the
jirst persen of the singular number.

When a speaker includes others with himself, he uses we.
This is the ﬁrst person of the plural number.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 25

Thou and you represent the person addressed-—-thou in
solemn discourse, and you, in common language.*" T'hese
are the second person. In the plural, ye is used in solemn
style, and you in familiar language.

IIe represents the name of a male, and size, that of a fe-
male, who is the subject of discourse, but not directly ad-
dressed. These are called the third person.

*As you was originally in the plural number, grammarians insist that
it must still be restricted to that number. But national usage rejects the
arbitrary principle. The true principle, on which all language is built,
rejects it. What fundamental rule have we to dispose of words, but this,
that when a word signiﬁes one, or unity, it belongs to the singular num-
ber E’ If a word,,once exclusively plural,becomes, by universal use, the
sign of individuality, it must take its place in the singular number. That
this is a fact with you, is proved by national usage. To assign the sub-
stitute to its verb, is to invert the order of things. The verb must follow
its nominative-—-if that denotes unity, so does the verb.

“ When you was at Athens, you attended_ the schools of the philoso-
phers.”--Cz'cero, Tusc. Quest. Trans. b. 2.

“ On that happy day when you was given to the world.”-Dod(l’s
.Massillon, Serm. 1.

“ Unless you was ill.”—-Boswell’s Life of J. .193. 68.
“You was on the spot Where your enemy was found killed.”--Gw

“You was in hopes to have succeeded to the inheritance.”--Ibm. b. 5.
“ When you was here comforting me ”-—-Pope’s Let.

“ I am as well as when you was here.”—-—Gay’s Let. to Swift.

“ Why was you glad ?”——Boswell’s Lzfe of Johnson.

These writers did not commit mistakes in the use of the verb after you
-—they wrote the language as established by national usage-——the founda-
tion of all language. So is the practice in the United States—--not mere-
ly popular usage, though this, when general, is respectable authority;
but the practice of men of letters.

It is a substitute for the name of any thing of the neuter
gender in the third person, and for a sentence.

They is a substitute for the names of persons or things,
and forms the third person of the plural number.

Who is a relative or a personal pronoun, used to intro-
duce a new clause or affirmation into a sentence, which
clause has an immediate dependence on the preceding one.*
I/Vho is also used to ask questions, and hence it is called an
vifrterrogative.

Which is also a relative, but is of neuter gender. It is
also interrogative. .

These pronouns have two cases; the nominative which
precedes a verb, and the objective which follows it. They
are inﬂected in the following manner:

Sing. Plu. 1 Sing. Plu.
Nominative I1‘ we Nom. - - she they
Objective me “ us Obj. - - her them

Obj. - - - thee you Obj. - - it . them

No'r:s.—.Mine, thine, his, hers, yours and theirs, are usually consid-
ered as the ossessive case. But the three first are either attributes,
and used with nouns, or they are substitutes. The three last are alwa s
substitutes, used in the place of names which are understood, as may 6
seen in the note be1ow.t

* Who is called ‘a relative, because it relates to an antecedent. But
this is also true of he, she, they, and most of the substitutes. They all
relate to the words which they represent. ' ’

’vMe is also used in the nominative, in popular practice-—-it is me.
This is condemned as bad English ; but in reality is an original idiom of
the language, received from the primitive Celtic inhabitants of England

: and France, in whose lanlguage mi was the nominative case of the ﬁrst

. personal pronoun. The

rench language retains the same word, from
the same original, in the phrase c’est moi—-it is I.

1 That mine, thine, his, ours, hers and theirs, do not constitute a pos-
sessive case, is demo-nstragle; for they are constantly used as the nom-
inatives to verbs, and as the objectives after verbs and prepositions, as in

on THE‘ ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 27

Its and whose have a better claim to be considered as a possessive
case ; but as they equally well fall under the denomination of attributes,
I have, for the sake of uniformity, assigned them a place with that part
of speech.

But it must be observed, that although it and who are real substitutes,
never united to names, like attributes—--it day——Who man; yet its and
whose cannot be detached from a name expressed or implied ; as, its
shape-——its ﬁgure-—whose face-—whose works———wh0se are they? that is,
whose Works? These are therefore real attributes.

In the use of substitutes, it is to be remarked, that I, than,
you, ye and we are generally employed without an antece-
dent name. When I and the name of the person are both
employed, as they are in formal writings, oaths and the like,

the following passages: “ Whether it could perform its operations of
thinking and memory out of a body organized as ours is.——Loe/re, b. 2.

27. “ In referring our ideas to those of other men called by the same .

name, ours may be false.”——-“ It is for no other reason but that his agrees
not with our icleas.”——[bm. ch. 32. 9 and 10.

“ You may imagine What kind of faith theirs was.”-—Baeon. Unity
in Religion.

“ He ran headlong into his own ruin whilst he endeavored to precip«
itate ours.”--Bolingbrohe. Let. to Windham.

“ The reason is, that his subject is generally things; theirs, on the
contrary, is persons.” Camp. Rhet. b. 1. ch. 10.

“Yours of the 26th Oct. I have received, as I have always done
yours, with no little satisfaction.”--- Wycherley to Pope.

“ Therefore leave your forest of beasts for ours of brutes, called men.”
--Ibvm.

“ These return so much better out of your hands than they went from
mine.”--Ibm.

“ Your letter of the 20th of this month, like the rest of yours——-tells
me with so much more wit, sense and kindness than mine can express,”
&c.—-—Ibm.

“ Having good works enough of your own besides to ensure yours
and their immortality. ”—172m.

“The omission of repetitions is but one, and the easiest part of yours
and of my clesign.”—-Pope to Wycherley. .

“ My sword and yours are kin.”-r-——Shakspeare.

It is needless to multiply proofs. We observe these pretended P081.-
sessives uniformly used as nominatives or ob'ectives. To say that, in
these passages, ours, yours, theirs, and mine orrn a possessive case, ,i
to make the possessive perform the ofiice of a nominative case to verbs,
and an objective case after verbs and prepositions—--a manifest solecism.

Should it be said that a noun is understood ;  reply, this cannot be
true, inregard to the grammatical construction : for supply the noun for
which the word is a substitute, and the pronoun must be changed into

He and they are used in the same indeﬁnite manner; as,
“ He seldom lives frugally, who lives by chance.” “ Bless-
ed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.”

He and they, in such sentences, represent any persons
who fall within the subsequent description.

Who and whom are always substitutes for persons, and
never for things or brutes. I/Vhose is equally applicable to
persons as to thingsi

an adjective. “ Yours of the 26th of October,” becomes your letter-—
“he endeavored to precipitate ours,” becomes our ruin. This shows
that the words are real substitutes, like others, where it stands for other
-men or things.

Besides, in three passages, just quoted, the Word yours is joined by a.
connective to a name in the same case : “ To ensure yours and their im-
mortality.” “The easiest part of yours and of my design.” “My
sword and yours are kin.” Will any person pretend that the connective
here joins different cases ?

Another consideration is equally decisive of’ this question. If yours,
ours, &c. are real possessives, then the same Word admits of two differ-
ent signs of the case ; for we say correctly, “ an acquaintance of yours,
ours, or theirs”——-of being the sign of the possessive; but if the words
in themselves are possessives, then there must be two signs of the same
case, which is absurd.*‘

Compare these words with a name in the possessive case-—-“ My house
is on a hill; my father’s is on a plain.” Here father’s is a real posses-
sive case ; the word house being understood; and the addition of the
noun makes no alteration in the Word father’s ; “my father’s is,” or
“my father’s house is.”

* This case does not compare with that of names. We say,“ a soldier
of the kin ’s”—-or a soldier of the king’s sold1ers—-but we cannot say,
“ an acquaintance of your’s acquaintance.”

1‘ “ Whose is rather the poetical, than the regular genitive of which.”
-—-Johnson. Lowth also condemns the use of whose, in the neuter gen-
der, citing, at the same time, the most respectable authorities for this
use—-Dryden, Milton and ﬂddison. “ The question whose solution I re-
quire"-—“ the tree whose mortal taste.”--But these critics seem not to
have penetrated to the bottom of this usage. The truth is, who and its

inﬂections are a part of the primitive language. The Latin qui, cut, qua,

us, are the English who--—quem and quad are whom and what--cujus
:3 whose. The Scots formerly wrote quha, quhat ; the Saxons, hwa.-—

'Whoever is often employed as the nominative to two
verbs; as, “ Whoever expects to ﬁnd in the scriptures a spe-
ciﬁc direction for every moral doubt that arises, looks for
more than he will meet with.”-—Pale3/, Phil. ch. 4.

Mine, thine and his are equally well used as substitutes,
or as attributes. “ The silver is mine, and the gold is mine.”
—-—IIag. 2. 8. “ The day is thine, the night also is thine.”——
Ps. '74. 16. “ The Lord knoweth them that are his.”--2
Tim. 2. 19. In these examples, the Words mine, thine, his,
may be considered as substitutes.—“ The silver is mine,”
that is, my silver.

In this character, the words usually follow the verb; but
when emphatical, they may precede it; as, “ His will I be.”
—-2 Sam. 16. 18. “ Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, the pow-
er and the glor .”-——-1 Ch. 29. ll. “ T/zine is the hingdom.”"“

These wordsyare also used as attributes of possession; as,
“Let not mine enemies triumph.” “ So let thine enemies
perish.” “ And Abram removed his tent.” Mine and thine
are however not thus used in familiar language; but in sol-
emn and elevated style, they are still used as attributes.

“ Zlline eyes beheld the messenger divine.”-—-—Lusiad, h. 2.

The Germans still use war, wessen, wem ; the Dutch, wie, wiens, wien.
In a fragment of the Laws of Numa, cujus is spelt qu0ius—-We have
this Word in whose. From the time of N uma, at least, this genitive has
been of all genders, andI believe, remains so, in all branches of the
Teutonic. It is better classed with adjectives or attributes, like his.

* In addition to the proofs already alleged, that these words are not a
possessive case, according to the usual acceptation of the word, we may
remark, that mine, thine and his, in the passages used in the text, do
not stand in the place of‘, of me, of thee, of him. The silver is of me,
the gold is of me, the day is of thee, the Lord knoweth them that are of
him, do not convey the same ideas, as the present form of expression.
Of, in these expressions, would rather imply proceeding from.

Besides, the same Words admit the sign of the possessive ; as, “ And
the man of thine, Whom I shall not cut oil?’ from mine altar.”—-1 Sam. 2.
33. “ Sing to the Lord, all ye saints of his.”-Ps. 30. 4. “ He that
heareth these sayings of mine.”—Ma.tt. 7. When we sa , “ a soldier of
the king’s,” we mean one of the king’s soldiers; and in t e passage here
cited from Samuel, “ the man of thine” has a like sense--“ the man of
thy men,” that is, any one of them. But in the passages from Psalms
and Matthew, the words “ all ye saints of his,” “ these sayin s of mine,”
are evidently meant to include the whole number. It is t erefore im-
possible to resolve these passages, without considering mine, thine and
his as substitutes, in the same case, as the nouns would be, which they
represent.

30 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

There is another class of substitutes, which supply the place
of names, attributes, sentences or parts of a sentence.

It.

In the following sentence, it is the substitute for a name.
“ The sun rules the day; it illumines the earth ;” here it is
used for sun, to prevent a repetition of the word.

In the following passage, it has a different use: “The
Jews, it is well known, were at this time under the dominion
of the Romans.”-—-Porteus, Lect. 8. Here it represents the
whole of the sentence, except the clause in which it stands.
To understand this, let the order of the words be varied.
“ The Jews were at this time under the dominion of the R0-
mans, it [all that] is well known.”

“ It is a testimony as glorious to his memory, as it is sin-
gular, and almost unexampled in his circumstances, that he
loved the Jewish nation, and that he gave a very decisive
proof of it, by building them a synagogue.”-—1hm.

To discover what is represented by the ﬁrst it, we must
inquire, What is a glorious testimony’! Why, clearly, that he
loved the Jewish nation, and gave them a decisive proof of it,
by building them a synagogue. It then is a substitute for
those clauses of the sentence. The second it refers to the
same clauses. In the latter part of the sentence, he gave a
magniﬁcent proof of 2't——of what? of what is related in a pre-
ceding clause-—-he loved the Jewish nat.z'on-—-of that he gave
a decisive and magniﬁcent proof. Here it represents that
member of the sentence.

“ As for the pulling of them down, if the affairs require
it.”—--Bacon on Ambition. Require what’! “ The pulling
of them down”---for which part of the sentence it is a sub-
stitute.

“ Shall worldly glory, impotent and vain,

That. ﬂuctuates like the billows of the main;

Shall this with more respect thy bosom move
Than zeal for crowns that never fade above '!
Avert it, heaven !”—--IIoole’s Tasso, 6. 5.

Avert what’! All that is expressed in the four preceding
lines, for all which it is a substitute.

“ And how could he do thisso effectually, as by perform-
mg works, which it utterly exceeded all the strength and
ability of men to accomplish.”-—Porteus, Lect. 5.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 31

What utterly exceeded 1 To what does it refer ‘I Let us
invert the order of the words—-—“ as by performing works, to
accomplish which exceeded all the strength of men.” Here
we ﬁnd to accomplish, a verb in the inﬁnitive, is the nomina-
tive to exceeded, and for that verb, it is a substitute.

This inceptive use of it forms a remarkable idiom of our
language, and deserves more particular illustration. It stands
as the substitute for a subsequent member or clause of a sen-
tence, and is a sort of pioneer to smooth the way for the
verb. Thus, “ It is remarkable, that the philosopher Seneca
makes use of the same argument.”---Po1'teus, Leet. 6. If
vge ask, What is remarkable? the answer must be, The fact
siated in the last clause of the" sentence. That this is the
real construction, appears from a transposition of the clauses,
“ The philosopher Seneca makes use of the same argument,
that is remarkable.” In this order We observe the true use
of that, which is also a substitute for the preceding clause
of the sentence, and it becomes redundant. The use then
of the inceptive it, appears to be to enable us to begin a sen-
tence, without placing a verb as the introductory word; and
by the use of it and that as substitutes for subsequent mem-
bers of the sentence, the order is inverted without occasion-
ing obscurity.

It is to be noticed also that this neuter substitute it, is
equally proper to begin sentences, when the name of a per-
son is afterwards used; as, “ It was John who exhibited such
powers of eloquence.” But if we transpose the words, and
place who or that, the substitute which begins a new clause,
next after the inceptive word,‘ we must use be for the incep-
tive-—“ 1%, who or that exhibited such powers of eloquence,
was John.”

In interrogative sentences, the order of Words is changed,
and it follows the verb. Who is it that has been thus elo-
quent?

There is a sentence in Locke, in which the inceptive it, is
omitted, “ Whereby comes to pass, that, as long_ as any un-
easiness remains in the mind.”---B. ch. 21. In strictness, this
is not a defective sentence, for that may be considered as the
nominative to comes--Whereby that comes to passwhich
follows. Or the whole subsequent sentence may be consid-

ered as the nominative-—-for all that comes to pass. But,

the use of the inceptive it is so fully established as the true
idiom of language, that its omission is not to be vindicated.

32 AN rmrnovnn GRAMMAR

This and that, these and those.

This and that are either deﬁnite attributes or substitutes.
As attributes, they are used to specify individuals, and dis-
tinguish them from others ; as, “ This my son was dead and
is alive again.” “ Certainly this was a righteous man.” “ The
end orfthat man is peace.” “ Woe to that man by whom the
Son of man is betrayed.” This and that have plurals, these
and those.

The general distinction between this and that, is, this de-
notes an object to be present or near in time or place; that,
to be absent. But this distinction is not always observed.
In correspondence however with this distinction, when, in
discourse, two things are mentioned, this and these refer to
the last named, or nearest in the order of construction; that
and those to the most distant ; as,

“ Self-love and reason to one end aspire,
Pain their aversion, pleasure their desire;
But greedy that [self love] its object would devour,
This [reason] taste the honey and not wound the ﬂower.”
Pope.
“ Some place the bliss in action, some in ease,
Those call it pleasure, and contentment these.”--—Ibm.

The poets sometimes contrast these substitutes in a simi-
larmanner, to denote individuals acting or existing in de-
tached parties; or to denote the whole acting in various ca-
pacities ; as,

“ ’Twas war no more’, but carnage through the ﬁeld,

Those lift their sword, and these their bosoms yield.”
Hoole’s Tasso, b. 20.

“ Nor less the rest, the intrepid chief retain’d ;
These urged by threats, and those by force constrain’d.”
’ Ibm.

There is a peculiarity in the use of that; for when it is an
attribute, it is always in the singular number ; but as a sub-
stitute for persons or things, it is plural as well as singular;
and is used for persons as well as things more frequently than
any word in the language; as,

“ I knew a man that had it for a by-word, when he saw

men hasten to a conclusion, ‘ Stay a little, that we may make
an end the sooner.’ ”-—Bacon on Dispatch.

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 33

Here that is the representative of man, and it stands for the
last clause of the sentence or by-word.

“ Let states that aim at greatness take heed how their no-
bility and gentlemen multiply too fast.”-—Bacon.

Here that is a substitute for a plural name. So also in the
following. “ They that are whole need not a physician, but
they that are sick.” “ They that had eaten were about four
thousand”--“ they that are in the ﬂesh”--“ they that weep”
-——-“ bless them that curse you.”

Another very common use of this and that, is to represent
a sentence or part of a sentence ; as,

“It is seldom known that, authority thus acquired is pos-
sessed without insolence, or that, the master is not forced to
confess that, he has enslaved himself by some foolish conﬁ-
dence.”--Rambler, No. 68. «

In this sentence, the first that represents the next mem-
ber—--“ Authority thus acquired is possessed without inso-
lence, that is seldom known ;” it represents the same clause.
The second that represents all which , follows, including two
clauses or members; the third that is the substitute for the
last clause. In strictness, the comma ought always to be
placed after that; which punctuation would elucidate the
use of the substitute and the true construction; but the prac-
tice is otherwise; for that, in this and like sentences, is
either a nominative or an objective. The ﬁrst that in the
foregoing sentence is the nominative, coinciding with it, or
in apposition to it; and when the clauses are transposed,
the inceptive it, being redundant, is dropped, and that be-
comes the nominative. The same remark is applicable to
the second that; the verb and ﬁrst clause, it is seldom known,
being understood. The third that is the objective after con-
fess. “The master has enslaved himself by some foolish
conﬁdence—-—he is forced to confess that--all that is seldom
known.”

Such is the true construction of sentences--—the deﬁnitive
that, instead of being a conjunction, is the representative of
a sentence or distinct clause, preceding that clause, and
pointing the mind to it, as the subject which follows. And it
is as deﬁnite or demonstrative in this application to sentences,
as when it is applied to a name or noun.

The following sentence will exhibit the true use of that
as a substitute : “ He recited his former calamities; to which

34 T AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

was now to be added that he was the destroyer of the man
who had expiated him.”—-Beloe’s Herodotus, Clio, 45.

According to our present grammars, that is a conjunction ;
if so, the preceding verb was, has no nominative word. But
the sense is, “to which was to be added that” which is re-
lated in the following words.

The useand importance of this substitute are more clearly
manifest, when it denotes purpose or effect; as in this pas-
sage, “And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth;
that it might be fulﬁlled which was spoken by the prophets,
He shall be called a N azarene.”——Matt. 2. 23. Here that is
equivalent to that purpose or (feet. ' He came and dwelt in
Nazareth, for the purpose expressed in what follows. It and
which represent the last clause in the sentence—-—-“ He shall
be called a Nazarene.” The excellence and utility of sub-
stitutes and abbreviations are strikingly illustrated by this use
of that.

This substitute has a similar use in this introductory sen-
tence, That we may proeeed——that here refers to the fol-
lowing words. The true construction is, But that we may
proceed--but, as will hereafter be shown, denoting supply
or something more or further; so that the literal interpreta-
tion of the expression is—-—]lIore that, or further that, we may
proceed. It is the simple mode our ancestors used to ex-
press addition to what has preceded, equivalent to the mod-
ern phrase; let us add, or we may add what follows, by
way of illustrating or modifying the sense of what has been
related.

That, like who and which, has a connecting power, which
has given to these words the name of relative; in which char-
acter, it involves one member of a sentence within another,
by introducing a new verb ; as, “ He, that keepeth his mouth,
keepeth his life.” Prov. 13. 3.-—-In this passage, that lceepeth
his mouth, is a new aﬁirmation, interposed between the ﬁrst
nominative and its verb; but dependant on the antecedent
nominative.

“ The poor of the ﬂock, that waited upon me, knew that
it was the word of the Lord.”-———Zech. 11. 11. In this passage,
we have that in both its characters-——the ﬁrst that is a substi-
tute for poor of the ﬂock ; the second, for the last clause of
the sentence, it was the wordof the Lord.

This exposition of the uses of that enables us to understand
the propriety of that that joined in construction.

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 35

“Let me also tell you that, that faith, which proceeds
from insuﬂicient or bad principles, is but little better than
infidelity.” In this passage, the ﬁrst that is a substitute for
the whole subsequent part of the sentence; the second that
is an attribute agreeing with faith-—“ That faith which pro-
ceeds from bad principles is little better than inﬁdelity——let
me tell you that.” Hence it might be well always to sepa-
rate the two words by a comma. We now distinguish these
words by a stronger emphasis _on the last.

“He, whom thou now hast, is not thy husband; in that
saidst thou truly.”—-John 4. 16. That is, in that whole
declaration.

From these passages and the explanation, we learn that
that is a substitute——either for a single word or a sentence;
nor has it any other character, except when an attribute.

This is much less frequently a substitute for sentences
than that; but is used in this character, as well as in that of
an attribute ; as, “ Let no prince measure the danger of dis-
contents by this, whether they be just or unjust; for that
were to imagine people to be reasonable, who do often spurn
at their own good; nor yet by this, whether the griefs where-
upon they rise be in fact great or small.”

Bacon on Kingdoms.

Here this, in each part of the sentence, is the representa-
tive of the clause in italics succeeding.

“Can we suppose that all the united powers of hell are
able to work such astonishing miracles, as were wrought for
the conﬁrmation of the Christian religion’! Can we suppose
that they can control the laws of nature at pleasure, and that
with an air of sovereignty, and professing themselves the
lords of the universe, as we know Christ did? If we can
believe this, then we deny,” &c. We observe, here, this
represents a series of sentences.

In some cases, this represents a few words only in a pre-
ceding sentence, as in the following--—“ The rule laid down
is in general certain, that the king only can eonvoke a par-
liament. And this by the ancient statutes of the realm, he
is bound to do, every year, or oftener, if need be.” Blacks.
Comment. B. 1. ch. 2.

If we ask, What is the king bound to do? the answer
must be, Convoke a parliament; for which words alone this
is the substitute, and governed by do.

36 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

The plurals these and those, are rarely or never used as
substitutes for sentences.

I/Vhich.

I/Vhichi is also a substitute for a sentence, or part of a
sentence, as well as for a single word; as, “ if there can be
any other way shown, how men may come to that universal
agreement, in the things they do consent in, which I presume
may be done.”--Locke on Und. B. 1. 2.

I/Vhich, in this passage, represents all which precedes-—
which or all that is above related, may be done.

“ Another reason that makes me doubt of any innate prac-
tical principles, is, that I think there cannot any one moral
rule be proposed, whereof a man may not justly demand a
reason; which would be perfectly ridiculous and absurd, if
they were innate, or so much as self-evident, which every
innate principle must needs be.”-—1bm. chap. 3.

In this passage, the ﬁrst which represents the next prece-
ding part of the sentence, a man may justly demand a reason
-——-which power of demanding a reason would be ridiculous.
The second which is a substitute for self-evident; which, that
is, self-evident, every principle must be.

“ Judas declared him innocent, which he could not be, had
he, in any respect, deceived the disciples.”——-Porteus, Lect.
2. Here which represents the attribute innocent.

That would equally well represent the same word, with a
connective. “ Judas declared him innocent, and that he
could not be,” &c. 7

“ We shall ﬁnd the reason of it to be the end of language,
which being to communicate thoughts”-——that is, end of lan-
guage; and for those words, is which the substitute.

I/Vhat.

This substitute has several uses. First-—-it has the sense
of that which; as, “ I have heard what has been alleged.”

»S'econdly--I/Vhat stands for any indeﬁnite idea; as, “ He
cares not what he says or does.” “ We shall the better know
what to undertake.”-—-Locke on Und. 1. 6.

Thirdly--I/Vhat is an attribute, either in the singular or
plural number, and denotes something uncertain or indeter-
minate; as, “In what character, Butler was admitted into
that lady’s service, is unknown.”——Johnson’s Life of Butler.

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 37

“ It is not material what names are assigned to them.”
Camp. Rhet. 1. l.

“ I know not what impressions time may have made upon

your person.” Life of Cowp. Let. 27.
“ To see what are the causes of wrong judgment.”
Locke, 2. 21.

Fourthly--I/Vhat is used by the poets preceding a name,
for the or that which, but its place cannot be supplied by
these words, without a name between them; as,

“ I/Vhat time the sun withdrew his cheerful light,

And sought the sable caverns bf the night.”
Hoole’s Tasso, 6. 7’.

That is, at the time when or in which. «

Fifthly——-A principal use of what is to ask questions; as,
“What will be the consequence of the revolution in
France?”

This word has the singular property of containing two cases ;
that is, it performs the oﬂice of a word in the nominative, and
of another in the objective case; as, “I have, in what goes
before, been engaged in physical inquiries farther than I in-
tended.”--Locke, 2. 8. Here what contains the object after
in, and the nominative to goes.

What is used with a name as an attribute and a substi-
tute; as, “It was agreed that what goods were aboard his
vessels, should be landed.”—--Michle’s Discovery of India,
89. Here what goods are equivalent to -the goods which;
for, what goods include the nominative to two verbs, were
and should he landed. This use of the word is" not deemed
elegant.

As.

As primarily signiﬁes like, similar; the primary sense of
which is even, equal. It is used adverbially in the phrases,
as good, as great, as probable. The sense of which is, like
or equally good, great or probable. Hence it frequently fol-
lows such. “ Send him such books as will please him.”
But in this and similar phrases, as must beconsidered as the
nominative to will please; or we must suppose an ellipsis of
several words. “Send him such books as the books which
will please him, or as those which will please him.” So in
the following sentences :

ble conclusions, as were sufficient for the practical purposes

“ The malcontents made such demands as none but a ty-
rant could refuse.” Bolingbrolce on Hist. Let 7.

In the last example, if as is to be considered as a pronoun
or substitute, it is in the objective case.

These and similar phrases are anomalous; and We can
resolve them only by supplying the ellipsis, or by considering
as in the nature of a pronoun, and the nominative to the
verb.

In the following form of expression, We may supply it for
the nominative 2 “ Do every thing as was said about mercu-
ry and sulphur.”-—-Encyc.

“ As it was said.”

In poetry, as supplies the place of such, or such as.

“ From whence might contest spring and mutual rage,
As would the camp in civil broils engage.”
H00le’s Tasso.

In prose, we should say, “ such contest and rage as.”

A3 sometimes refers to a sentence or member of a sen-
tence, and sometimes its place may be supplied by which.
“On his return to Egypt, as I learned from the same au-
thority, he levied a mighty army.” Beloe, Herod.

I/Vhich I learned. “ On his return to Egypt, he levied a
mighty army, which [fact] I learned from the same authority.”

As often begins a sentence. “As to the three orders of

Both.

Both is. an adjective of number; but it is a substitute also
for names, sentences, parts of sentences, and for attributes.

tech, and both of them made a covenant.”

As an attribute, it has a like position before names; as,

“ It is both more accurate, and proves no inconsiderable
aid to the right understanding of things, to discriminate by
different signs such as are truly diﬁ'erent.”

C'ampbell’s Rhet. 1. 33.

In this passage, both represents more accurate, and the
following member of the sentence; but the construction is
harsh.

“ The necessity which a speaker is under, of suiting him-
self to his audience, both that he may be understood by them,
and that his words may have an inﬂuence upon them.”—--

Here both represents the two following clauses of the sen-
tence. The deﬁnitive the is placed between both and its
noun; as, “ To both the preceding kinds, the term burlesque
is applied.”--C'amp. Rhet. 1. 2.

Same.
The adjective same is often used as a substitute for per-

sons and sentences or parts of a sentence; as, “Nothing ap-

pears so clearly an object of the mind or intellect only, as

any where else. Not but the same, if we consider, is equal-

In this ill-constructed sentence, same has reference to all
which is predicated of the future tense——that is, that it is an
olgiect of intellect only, since we can ﬁnd no place for its esc-
istence any where else-—-The same, all this, is true of the
past also.

“ For brave and generous ever are the same.” Lusiad. 1.

strange phenomenon ; that, even a man of discernment should -

write without meaning, andnot be sensible that he hath no
meaning; and that judicious people should read What hath
been written in this way, and not discover the defect. Both
are surprising, but the ﬁrst much more than the last.”—Camp.
Rhet. 2. 7.

Here both represents the two clauses of the sentence, pre-
ceded by that---both of those propositions are surprising.
Firstrand last stand in the place of the same clauses.

“Sublimity and vehemence are often confounded, the lat-
ter being considered as a species of the former.”-—C'amp.
Rhet. 1. 1.

Here latter and former are used for names which are near
in construction, and no obscurity is occasioned by the sub-
stitutes. But these words, when placed far from the words
which they represent, obscure the sense, and compel the

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 41

reader to peruse a sentence the second time, which is always
a fault in style. For example: “ As to the /Etolian, it is
frequently confounded with the Doric; and as this union
takes place also in other essential points, it is only between
the Dorians and Ionians that a kind of parallel can be drawn.
This I shall not undertake to perform; I shall only make
one general observation; the manners of the former have
ever been severe, and the characteristics of their architect-
ure, language and poetry, are grandeur and simplicity. The
latter more early made a progress in reﬁnement.”-—-Anarclz.
ch. 72.

In every case, where the antecedent word or sentence is
not obvious, so that the mind instantly applies the substitute
to its principal, the use of a substitute is a fault. For exam-
ple : “ When a speaker addresseth himself to the understand-
ing, he proposes the instruction of his hearers, and that by
explaining some doctrine unknown or not distinctly compre-
hended by them, or by proving some position disbelieved or
doubted by them. In other words, he proposes to dispel ig-
norance or to vanquish error. In the one, his aim is their
information; in the other, their conviction. Accordingly, the
predominant quality of the former is perspicuity; of the latter,
argument. By that, we are made to know; by this, to be-
lieve.”---Camp. Rhet. 6.‘ 1. ch. 1.

To what antecedent words or clauses, do all these substi-
tutes refer’! In the one——and the other what’! Doubtless, the
antecedents must be the two parts of the sentences, beginning
with, by explaining and by proving. That is, in explaining
an unknown doctrine, his aim is instruction-——in proving a
doubted point, his aim is conviction. The predominant
quality of the former——former what’! unquestionably, the
same sentences are the antecedents to the former and latter.
These words cannot refer to information and conviction ; for
although perspicnity may be predicated of information, yet it
cannot be a predominant quality of it; and argument cannot
be predicated of conviction. But the whole passage is per-
plexed and obscure?‘

* This criticism is the more necessary, as the use offormer and latter
in our best writers, is indulged to a fault. There are few places in which
it is not better to repeat the antecedents than to use former and latter.
The injudicious use of these and other substitutes isa great blemish in
Campbell's Philosophy of Rhetoric. I

Self and own.

tutes and‘ attributes.’“‘ Sometimes it is used as a noun-. In

them; as,himself, herself, themselves. And though annexed
to substitutes in the objective case, these words are indiffer-
ently in the nominative or objective. Self is never added to
his, their, mine, or thine.

The compounds himself, herself, thyself, ourselves, them-
selves, may be placed immediately after the personal substi-
tute; as, He himself wrote a letter to the minister ; or immedi-
ately after the following verb or its object; as, “ He wrote a
letter hz'mself,”-—“ he went himself to the admiralty.” In such
phrases, himself not only gives emphasis to the eaﬁirrnation,
but gives to an implied negative, the force of one expressed.
“ He went himself to the minister,” carries with it a direct
negation that another person went. In negative sentences, it
has a different effect. “ He did not write the letter himself,”
implies strongly that he wrote it by an agent, or had an agency
in procuring it to be written.

These compound substitutes. are used after verbs when re-
ciprocal action is expressed “go as, “ They injure themselves.”

Itself is added to names for emphasis; “this is the book
2'tse_lf.”

Own is an attribute denoting property, used with names to
render the sense emphatical ; as, “ this book is my own.”

Own is sometimes a substitute; as, “ He came unto his
own, and his own received him not.”--John 1. ll.
“ This is an invention of his own.”

One, other, another, none.

The attribute one is very often a subst-itute—-other is used
in the same manner, and often opposed to one. “ All ration-
alor deductive evidence is derived from one or the other of
these two sources.”--C'amp. Rhet. ch. 5. To render these

always be joined to a verb in the plural, we are under the necessit ‘of
saying, “ You yourself were,“ when we address a single person---w ml:

appligd to an individual, it must be considered as a verb in the singular

more explicit, the deﬁnitive the is placed before them; as,
“ either he will hate the one, and love the other.”

Another has sometimes a possessive case; as, “the horse is
another’s ;” butthis form of speech is but little used.

Another is the Saxon am, one, and other—--one other. It is
an attribute ; but often used as a substitute. “ Let another
praise thee, and not thine own mouth.”—-—Prov. 27. 2.

None [no one] is often a substitute; as, “ Ye shall lie
down and none shall make you afraid.”—-Lev. 26. 6. It is
used in the plural as well as the singular number.

The cardinal numbers ‘are all used as substitutes, when
the things to which they refer are understood by the train of
discourse, and no ambiguity is created by the omission of the
name ; as, “ The rest of the people also cast lots, to bring one
of ten to dwell in Jerusalem.”—--Neh. ll. 1.

One has sometimes the possessive form; “ One’s person
is to be protected by law ;” and frequently the plural num-
ber ; as, “ I have commanded my sanctified ones, and I have
called my mighty ones.”-—-—Isa. 13. 9.

One, when contrasted with other, sometimes represents
plural names, and is joined with a plural verb, as in this pas-
sage; “ The reason why the one are ordinarily taken for
real qualities, and the other, only for bare powers, seems to
be,” &c.—-—LoeIce, b. 2. ch. 8. 25.  

One and another have a peculiar distributive use in the
following and the like expressions; “ Brethren, let us love
one another.” The effect of these words seems to be, to
separate an act affirmed of a number collectively, and distri-
bute it among the several 'individuals—-“ Let us love—-let
eachone love the other.” “ If ye have love one to another”
-——“ by love serve one another.” One another, in this phrase-
ology, have the comprehensive sense of every one. “ By
love serve”-—-every one serve the other. Each is used in a
like sense--They love each other—-—that is--—-they love -—each
love the other.

Several.

Several is an attribute, denoting originally one thing sev-
ered from others. But this sense seems to be now conﬁned
to technical law language ; as, “ a joint and several estate.”
In common use, it is always plural, expressive of an indeﬁ-
nite number, not very large. It is frequently a substitute;

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 45

as, “ Several of my unknown correspondents.”-—-Spectator,
281.

Some.

The attribute some is often used as a substitute ; as, “ Some
talk of subjects they do not understand ; others praise virtue
who do not practice it.”——-Johnson.

Eaeh, every, either, neither.

Each is a distributive attribute, used to denote every indi-
vidual of a number, separately considered ; as, “ The king of
Israel and the king of Judah sat each on his throne.” “ Thou
also and Aaron, take each of you his censer.” “ The four
beasts had each of them six wings.”

In these passages, each is a substitute for the name of the
persons or objects, one separate from the other.*

Every denotes all the individuals of a number considered
separately; it is therefore a distributive attribute, but some»
times a substitute, chieﬂy in the law style ; as, “ every of the
clauses and conditions.” It is generally followed by the name
to which it belongs, or by the cardinal number one.

We sometimes see every separated from its name by the
deﬁnitive the and an attribute of the superlative degree; as,
“every the least variation.”-—-Loc/ce.

Either and neither are usually classed with the con'unctions ; but in
strictness, they are always attributes or substitutes. heir correlatives
or and nor, though considered as conjunctions, belong to the latter class
of words—-or being merely an. abbreviation of other, and nor being the
same word with the Saxon negative preﬁxed, as will be hereafter shown.

Either and or denote an alternative ; as, “ I will take either
road at your pleasure.” That is, I will take one road or the
other. In this use, either isan attribute.

Either is also a substitute for a name; as, “ Either of the
roads is good.” It also represents a sentence or a clause
of a sentence; as, “No man can serve two masters, for ei-
ther he will hate the one and love the other, or else,” &c.
Matt. 6. 2. To understand the true import of either, let or
be also reduced back to its original orthography; “ foreither
he will hate the one and love the other; other else he will

hold to the one and despise the other.” Here we are pre-
sented with the sentence as it would have stood in the Saxon;
and we see two distinct aﬂirmations, to the first of which is
preﬁxed either, and to the last other. These words then are

‘substitutes for the following sentences, when they are intended

to be alternative. Either and or are therefore signs of an
alternative, and may be called alternatives.

Either is used also for each; as, “ Two thieves were cru-
ciﬁed-——on either side one.” This use of the word is con-
stantly condemned by critics, and as constantly repeated by
good writers ; but itwas the true original sense of the word,
as appears by every Saxon author.

Either is used also to represent an alternative of attri-
butes; as, “the emotion must be either, not violent or not
durable.”--Camp. Rhet. 1. 2.

Neither is not either, from the Saxon ne~either; and nor
is ne-other, not other. As either and or present an alterna-
tive or a choice of two things; so neither and nor deny both
or the whole of any number of particulars ; as, “ Fight neither
with small nor great.”---1 Kings, 22. 31. Which sentence,

when resolved, stands thus; “ Fight not either with small, not

other with great.” Such is the curious machinery of lan-
guage!

Neither is also used as an attribute and as a substitute for
aname; as, “ Neither oﬂice is ﬁlled, but neither of the of-
ﬂees will suit the candidate.”

N orn.--Or, either, nor and neither, are here explained in their true
original character; but when they stand for sentences, it is more natu-
$1 to consider them as connectives, under which head I have arranged

em.

In general, any attribute [adjective] which describes per-
sons or things with suﬁicient clearness, without the name to
which it strictly belongs, may be used as a substitute; as,
“The rich have many friends”-——“ Associate with the wise
and good”—-“ The future will resemble the past”—-“ Such is
the opinion of the learned.”

ATTRIBUT ES OR. ADJECTIVES.

Adjectives in grammar are words which denote the quali-
ties inherent in, or ascribed to things, or deﬁning them ; as,
a bright sun ; a splendid equipage ; a miserable hut ; a mag-
niﬁcent house; an honest man; an amiable woman; liberal
charity; false honor; a quiet conscience.

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 47

As qualities may exist in different degrees, which may be
compared with each other, suitable modes of speech are de-
vised to express these comparative degrees. In English,
most attributes admit of three degrees of comparison, and a
few admit of four. There are therefore four degrees of
comparison.

The ﬁrst denotes a slight degree of the quality, and is ex-
pressed by the termination ish; as, reddish, brownish, yel-
lowish. This may be denominated the imperfect degree of
the attribute.

The second denotes such a degree of the attribute as to
constitute an absolute or distinct quality; as, red, brown,
great, small, brave, wise. This is called the positive degree.

The third denotes a greater or less degree of a quality,
than exists in another object, with which it is compared; as,
greater, smaller, braver, wiser. This is called the compara-
tive degree.

The fourth denotes the utmost or least degree of a quali-
ty; as, bravest, wisest, poorest, smallest. This is called the
superlative degree.

The imperfect degree is formed by adding ish to an attri-
bute; as, yellow, yellowish. If the attribute ends in e, this
vowel is omitted ; as white, whitish.

The comparative’ degree is formed by adding r to adjec-
tives ending with e; as, wise, wiser--and by adding er to
words ending with a consonant ; as, cold, colder--or by pre-
ﬁxing more or less; as, more just, less noble.

The superlative degree is formed by adding st to attri-
butes ending with e; as, wise, wisest--—and est to those
which end with a consonant; as, cold, coldest--or by preﬁx-
ing most and least ; as, most brave, least charitable.

Every attribute susceptible of comparison, may be com-
pared by more and most, less and least.

All monosyllables admit of er and est, and dissyllables
when the addition may be easily pronounced; as, happy,
happier, happiest; lofty, loftier, loftiest. But few words of
more syllables than one will admit of er and est. Hence
most attributes of more syllables than one are compared by
more and most, less and least; as, more fallible, most up-
right, less generous, least splendid. .

When attributes end in y after a consonant, this letter is
dropped, and i substituted before er and est; as, lofty,lqft-
ier, loftiest.

PREFACE.

THE British Grammars of the English language appear to me to
be very imperfect, and, in some particulars, very erroneous. Since
the publication of the grammars of Lowth and Priestley, who
added most of the improvements, which have been made since the
days of Wallis, some important discoveries have been made in the
origin of Words and in the construction of sentences, which have
not been introduced into any grammar published in Great Britain;
at least as far as my knowledge extends.

Grammar is a diﬁicult subject, especially to the young student;
and the diﬂiculties that belong to the subject, have been increased
by the use of terms merely technical in designating the parts of
speech. On entering upon the subject, the young student meets
with the words noun, ronoun, adjective, verb, adverb; words he
never saw or heard of efore, as they are no part of the common
language which he has been accustomedeto use; and words which
he does not understand. To remedy, as far as possible, this evil, I
have, in this work, not only explained the technical terms, but have
used other terms, with them, which serve as interpreters of the
words commonly used. These interpreting words are more easily
understood, and some of them are more strictly correct, or better
adapted to express their true signiﬁcation. Thus fotnoun, the
English word name is often used; a word which every child undera-
stands. This accords with the practice of the nations on the con-
tinent of Europe. For pronoun, the word substitute or representa-
tive is sometimes used; for several of the words called pronouns
are often used in the place of sentences, or they refer to them.
aﬁlttribute is a word better understood than adjective; though it were
to be wished, we could ﬁnd a more familiar term for that class of
words. For adverb, I often use'imod1_°ﬁer; a term much wanted to
denote certain words which have the uses of diﬁerent parts of
speech. Thus most and -very, which are adjectives, are often used
as adverbs‘, as in the phrases most wise, very good. If we call
the words, in such phrases, adverbs, then WE call them by the same
name as we do mostly and verily. In like manner, u , over, to, which
areprepositions, are used to modify verbs, in suc phrases as to
give up/co give over, to come to; and it seems very unnaturalto call
them, 1n these and similar forms of speech, repositions.

The terms used to express the tenses of nglish verbs, are bor-
rowed from the Latin; but some of them are improperly applied.
Thus, he created is called the im erfect tense, denoting unﬁnished
action; but this is not correct: tiie imperfect tense in English is,

48% AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

A few attributes have different words or irregular termi-
nationsfor expressing the degrees of comparison; as, good,
better, best; bad or evil, worse, worst; fore, former, first ;
little, less or lesser, least; much, more, most; near, near-
er, nearest or next; old, older, oldest or eldest; late, later,
latest or last.

When qualities are incapable of increase or diminution,
the Words which express them do not admit of comparison.
Such are the numerals, ﬁrst, second, third, &c., attributes of
mathematical ﬁgures, as square, spherical, rectangular--—for
it will readily appear, that if a thing is ﬁrst or square,» it can-
not be more or less so.

The sense of attributes however is not restricted to the
modiﬁcation, expressed by the common signs of compari-
son; but may be varied in an indeﬁnite number of ways, by
other words. Thus the attribute very, which is the French
vrai, true, formerly written veray, is much used intensively
to express a great degree of a quality, but not the greatest;
as, very wise or learned. In like manner are used much,
far, extremely, exceedingly, and most of the modiﬁers in ly.

Some adjectives, from particular appropriate uses, have
received names, by which they are distinguished. But the
usual classiﬁcation is by no means correct. The following
distribution seems to result from the uses of the Words
named.

An or a, the, this, that, these, those, other, another, one,
none, some, may be called definitives, from their oﬁce, which
is to limit or deﬁne the extent of the name to which they
are preﬁxed, or to specify particulars.

My, thy, her, our, your, their; and mine, thine, his, when
used as attributes, with names, are possessive attributes, as
they denote possession or ownership. Its and whose, if
ranked with attributes, belong to the same class.

Each and every are distributives, but they may be classed
with the deﬁnitives. ,

Either is an alternative, as is or, which is now considered
merely as a connective.

Own is an intensive adjective. The words to which self
is affixed, himself, myself, themselves, yourself, yourselves,
ourselves, thyself, itself, may be denominated intensive sub-
stitutes, or, for brevity, intensives. Or they may be called
compound substitutes.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 49

VERB.

The verb is a primary part of speech, and of the most im-
portance. The uses of the verb are,

lst. To afﬁrm, assert or declare; as, the sun shines;
John loves study; God is just; and negatively, avarice is
not commendable.

2d. To command, exhort or invite; as, go, attend, let us
observe.

3d. To pray, request, entreat; as, 0 may the spirit of
grace dwell in us.  

4th. Tb inquire or question; as, does it rain’! will he
come’!   s

From the various uses and signiﬁcations of verbs, have
originated several divisions or classes. The only one in
English which seems to be correct, and suﬁiciently compre-
hensive, is into transitive and intransitive. To these may
be added a combination of the verb be, with certain auxilia-
ries and participles, which is called a passive verb, or rather
the passive form of the verb?” in

1. A transitive verb denotes action or energy, which is
exerted upon some object, or in producing some effect. In
natural construction, the word expressing the object, fol-
lows the verb, without the intervention of any other word,
though the order may he sometimes varied. Thus, “ ridi-
cule provokes anger,” is a complete proposition-—-ridicule
is the agent or nominative word, which causes the action--
provolce is the verb, or aﬂirmation of an act—-anger is the
object or effect produced, following the transitive verb pro-
volce.

“ The wind propels a ship,” is the afﬁrmation of an act of
the wind exerted on a ship. T/Vind is the agent, propels, the
verb, and ship, the object.

2. An intransitive verb denotes simple being or exist-
ence in a certain state ; as, to be, to rest; or it denotes ac-
tion, Which is limited to the subject. Thus, “ Jolm sleeps,”
is an affirmation, in which John, the nominative to sleeps,

* The common distribution into active, neuter and passive, is very ob-
jectionable. Many of our neuter verbs imply action in a pre-eminent
degree, as to run, to walk, to fly ; and the young learner cannot easily
conceive Why such verbs are not called active. _

50 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

is the subject of the aﬂirmation; sleeps is a verb intransi-
tive, affirming a particular thing of John, which extends to

‘no other object.

3. The passive form of the verb in English, is composed
of certain auxiliaries and participles with the verb be. It
denotes passion or suffering ; that is, that the subject of the
aﬂirmation or nominative is affected by the action aﬂirrned ;
as, “ John is convinced.” “ Laura is loved and admired.”

In this form of the verb, the agent and object change
places. In the transitive form, the agent precedes the verb,
and the object follows; as, “John has convinced Moses.”
In the passive form, the order is changed, and the agent fol-
lows the verb, preceded by a preposition; as, “ Moses is
convinced by John.” .

To correspond with their nominatives, verbs are used in
both numbers, and with the three persons in each.

As action and being may be mentioned as present, past
or future, verbs have modiﬁcations to express time, which
are called tenses. And as action and being may be repre-
sented in various ways, verbs have various modiﬁcations to
answer these purposes, called modes. Hence to verbs be-
long person, number, tense and mode.

The persons which have been already explained, are, I,

thou or you, he, she, it, in the singular number ; in the plu-

ral, we, ye or you, they. The numbers have been before
explained.

TENSES.

There are six tenses, modiﬁcations or combinations of the
verb to express I time. Each of these is divided into two
forms, for the purpose of distinguishing the dtginite or pre-
cise time from the indeﬁnite. These may be thus explained
and exempliﬁed :-

Present Tense, - indeﬁnite.

This form of the present tense aﬂirms or denies action or
being, in present time, without limiting it with exactness to
a given point. It expresses also facts whichiexist generally,
at all times, general truths, attributes which are permanent,
habits, customary actions, and the like, without reference to
a speciﬁc time ; as, God is inﬁnitely great and just; man is
imperfect and dependent; plants - spring from the earth;
birds ﬁg; ﬁshes swim.. I

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 51

Present Tense, deﬁnite.

This form expresses the present time with precision;
usually denoting action or being, which corresponds in time
with another action; as, I am writing, while you are wait-

zng.
Past Tense, indejinite.

This form of the past tense represents action which took
place at a given time past, however distant, and completely
past; as, “ In six days, God created the heavens and the
earth.” “Alexander conquered the Persians.” “ Scipio
was as virtuous as brave.” “ The Earl of Chatham was an
eloquent statesman.”

Past Tense, deﬁnite [imperf'ect.]

This form represents an action as taking place and unﬁn-
ished in some speciﬁed period of past time; as, “I was
standing at the door when the procession passed.”

Perfect Tense, indeﬁnite.

This form of the perfect tense represents an action com-
pletely past, and often at no great distance, but the time not
specified; as, “I have accomplished my design.” But if a
particular time is named, the tense must be the past; as,
“ I accomplished my design last week.” “ I have seen my
friend last week,” is not correct English. In this respect,
the French idiom is different from the English; for, “ J’ ai

‘vu mon ami hier,” is good French, but “I have seen my

friend yesterday,” is not good English. The words must
be translated, “I saw my friend yesterday.” No fault is
more common than a mistranslation of this tense.

It is to be noted however that this perfect indeﬁnite tense,
is that in which we express continued or repeated action.
“ My father has lived about eighty years.” “ The king has
reigned more than forty years.” “ He has been frequently
heard to lament.”—-Life of Couper. We use it also when
a speciﬁed past time is represented, if that time is expressed
as a part of the present period. Thus, although we cannot

say, “ We have been together yesterday,” we usually, say,’

“ We have been together this morning, or this evening.”
We even use this tense in mentioning events which happen-
ed at a greater distance of time, if we connect that time with
the present; as, “His brother has visited him once within

52 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

two years.” “ He has not seen his sister, since the year
1800.”

Perfect Tense, deﬁnite.

This form represents an action as just ﬁnished; as, “ I
have been reading a history of the revolution in France.”

Prior-Past Tense, indeﬁnite [pluperfect.]

This form of the prior past tense expresses an action
which was past at or before some other past time speciﬁed;
as, “ He had received the news before the messenger ar-
rived.”

t Prior-Past, deﬁnite.

This form denotes an action to be just past, at or before
another time speciﬁed; as, “ I had been reading your letter
when the messenger arrived.”

Future Tense, indrjinite.

This form of the future tense gives notice of an event to
happen hereafter ; as, “ Your son will obtain a commission
in the navy.” “ We shall have a ﬁne season.”

Future Tense, deﬁnite.

This form expresses an action which is to take place and
be unﬁnished at a speciﬁed future time; as, “ He will be
preparing for a visit at the time you arrive.”

Prior-Future, indeﬁnite.

This form of the future tense denotes an action which will
be past at a. future time speciﬁed; as, “ They will have per-
formed their task, by the appointed hour.”

Priar-Future, deﬁnite.
This form represents an action which will be just past at

a future speciﬁed time; as, “We shall have been making
preparations, a week before our friends arr1ve.””“

* The common names and distribution of the tenses, are so utterly in-
correct and incompetent to give a just idea of their uses, that I have ven-
tured to offer a new division, retaining the old names, as far as truth will
Warrant. The terms prior-past, and prior-future, are so perfectly de-
scriptive of the tenses arranged under them, that I cannot but think they
will be well received. The distinction of indefinite and deﬁnite is not
Wholly new ; but I have never seen the deﬁnite forms displayed, though
they are as necessary as the indeﬁnite forms. Indeed, I see not how a

foreigner can learn our language, as the tenses are commonly distributed
and deﬁned.

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 53

In the use of the present tense, the following things are
to be noticed.

I. The present tense is customarily used to express fu-
ture time, when by any mode of expression, the mind is
transported forward to the time, so as to conceive it pres-
ent; as, “I cannot determine, till the mail arrives.” “ As
soon as it is light, we shall depart.” “ When he has an op-
portunity, he will write.” The words till, when, as soon as,
carry the mind to the time of an event to happen, and we
speak of it as present.

2. By an easy transition, the imagination passes from an
author to his writings; these being in existence and present,
though long after his decease, we substitute the writer’s name
for his works, and speak of him as living, or in the present
tense; thus, Milton resembles Homer in sublimity and in-
vention, as Pope resembles Virgil, in smoothness of versiﬁ-
cation. Plato is fanciful; Aristotle is profound.

3. It gives great life and effect to description, in prose or
verse, to represent past events as present ; to introduce them
to the view of the reader or hearer, as having a present ex-
istence. Hence the frequent use of the present tense for the
future, by the historian, the poet and the orator :-—-

“ She spoke ; Minerva burns to meet the war;
And now heaven’s empress calls the blazing car;
At her command rush forth the steeds divine ;
Rich with immortal gold, the trappings shine.’

. Iliad, 5.

The deﬁnite tenses, it will be observed, are formed bythe
participle of the present tense, and the substantive verb,’ be.
This participle always expresses present time, even when
annexed to a past or future tense; for I was writing, de-
notes, that, at the past time mentioned, the action was pres-
ent; I shall be writing, denotes future time, but an action
then to be present. ‘

The past tense of every regular verb ends in ed-—-cl being
added to a verb ending in e; and ed to a verb with other
terminations; as, hate, hated ; look, looked.

The future tense is formed by the present tense of shall
and will; for, Ishall go, he will go, are merely anappro-
priate use of I shall to go, I will to go. See an explanation
of these Words urider the head of auxiliaries.

54 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

There are other modes of expressing future time ; as’, “ I
am going to write”-—-“ I am about to write.” These have
been called the inceptive future, as they note the commence-
ment of an action, or an intention to commence an action
without delay.

We have another mode of expression, which does not
strictly and positively foretell‘ an action, yet it implies a ne-
cessity of performing an act, and clearly indicates that it will
take place. For example, “ I have to pay a sum of money
to-morrow.” That is, I am under a present necessity or ob-
ligation to do a future act.

The substantive verb followed by a radical verb, forms
another idiomatic expression of future time; as, “ John is
to command a regiment.” “ En as went in search of the
seat of an empire which was, one day, to command the
world.” The latter expression is a future-past———that is, past
as to the narrator"; but future as to the event, at the time
speciﬁed.

MODES»

]IIode, in grammar, is the manner of representing action
and being, or the wishes and determinations of the mind.
This is performed by inflections of the verb, or by combina-
tions of verbs with auxiliaries and participles, and by their
various positions.

As there are scarcely two authors who are agreed in the
number and denominations of the modes in English, I shall’
offer a distribution of the verbs, and a display of their in-
ﬂections and combinations, somewhat different from any
which I have seen.

1. The first and most simple form of the verb, is, the verb
without inﬂections, and unconnected with persons. This
form usually has the preﬁx to; as, to love.

This form of the verb, not being restricted to person or
number, is usually called the Inﬁnitive Mode.

2. Another use of the verb is to aﬁrm, assert or declare
some action or existence, either positively, as, Ice runs, or
negatively, as, you are not in health. This form is called the
Indicative Mode.

3. Another oﬂice of the verb i to command, direct, ask,
or exhort; as, arise, make haste, let us be content. This is
called the Imperative Mode.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 55

4. Another use of verbs is to represent actions or events
which are uncertain, conditional or contingent; as,  he shall
go;  they would attend. This is called the Sulgjnnetive
Mode; but would better be denominated the Conditional.

The indicative becomes conditional, by means of words used

to express condition; as, if, though, unless, whether.

The Moons then are four-—-the Inﬁnitive, the Indicative,
the Imperative, and the Subjunctive.

It may also be observed that the combinations, and ar-
rangements of our verbs and auxiliaries to express negative
and interrogative propositions, are really modes of the verb,
and a place might be assigned to the verb for each purpose,
were it not for the inconvenience of having modes of modes.
For the sake of distinction, I denominate these verbs inter-
rogative and negative, and have exhibited the conjugation of
each.

PARTICIPLES.

Participles are derivatives from verbs, formed by particu-
lar terminations, and having the sense of verbs, attributes or
names.

There are two species of participles-—one denoting pres-

ent time, and formed by adding ing to the verb; as, turn,
turning: or, when the verb ends with e, by dropping that
letter and adding ing; as, place, placing. But e is retained
in dyeing, from dye, to color, to distinguish it from dying,
the participle of die; in which word, y is used to prevent
the duplication of i. In singeing, from singe, e is retained
to soften g, and to distinguish the word from singing; so also
in twingeing.
p This participle of the present tense is used, as before ob-
served, to form the deﬁnite tenses. But it often loses the
sense of the verb, and becomes an attribute; as, a loving
friend, lasting friendship. In this use, it admits of compar-
ison by more and less, most and least; as, more lasting, less
saving, most promising.

This participle also becomes an adverb or modiﬁer by re-
ceiving the termination ly ; as, lovingly, laughingly: and this
species of modiﬁers admits of comparison; as, more lovingly,
most charmingly.

This participle also becomes a name and admits of the
deﬁnitive; as, “ the burning of London in 1666.” In this
capacity, it takes the plural form; as, “the overﬂowing: of

56   AN mpnovnn enAMMA:a

the N ile”—-—“ He seeth all his goings.” And sometimes the
plural is used when a modiﬁer is attached to the participle ;
as, “the goings out, the comings in.”-—Ezelc. 43. 11. But
this use of the participle is not esteemed elegant, nor is it
common.

In a few instances, the participle in ing becomes a name
by receiving the termination ness; as, willingness, from will-
ing.

The other species of participle is formed from the verb, by
adding d or ed, and in regular verbs, it corresponds exactly
with the past time ; as, loved, preceded. This may be called
the participle of the peifect tense.

This participle, when its verb is transitive, may be joined
with the verb be, in all its inﬂections, to form the passive form
of a verb, and the participle, in such combination, is called
passive. But

This participle, when formed from an intransitive verb, can-
not, except in a few instances, be joined to the substantive
verb, or used in a passive sense; but it unites with the other
auxiliaries.

This participle often loses its verbal character, and be-
comes an attribute ; as, a concealed plot, a painted house. In
this character, it admits of comparison; as, “ a more ad-
mired artist,” “ a most respected magistrate ;” and a few of
these verbal attributes receive the termination ly, and be-
come modiﬁers; as, pointedly, more conceitedly, most deject-
edly. I

Those verbs, whose past tense and participle end in ed,
are deemed regular. All which deviate from this rule, are
deemed irregular, and their participles of the perfect tense
end mostly in t, n and g. A list of th-em will be found in the
sequel.

AUXILIARIES.

In English, a few monosyllabie verbs are chieﬂy employ-
ed to form the modes and tenses of other verbs, and from
this use, are denominated auxiliaries or helping verbs.
These are followed by other verbs, without the preﬁx to;
as, “ he may go ;” though they were originally principal
verbs, and some of them still retain that character, as well
as that of auxiliaries.

The verbs which are always auxiliary to others, are may,
can, shall, must; those which are   sometimes auxiliaries,

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 57

and sometimes principal verbs, are will, have, do and be. To
these may be added need and dare.

May conveys the idea of liberty or permission; as, “he
may go, if he will.’’ Or it denotes possibility; as, “he may
have written or not.’’‘’‘‘

Can has the sense of to be able.

Shall, in its primitive sense, denotes to be obliged, coin-
ciding nearly with ought; which sense it retains in the Ger-
man. But this signiﬁcation, though evidently the root of
the present uses of this word, is much obscured. The fol-
lowing remarks will illustratethe several uses of will and
shall.

Will has a common origin with the Latin volo. Hence
the German wollen, the old English woll, and the present
contraction won’t, that is, woll-notxl‘

This was originally a principal verb, and is still used as
such in our language. It denotes the act of the mind in de-
termining, or a determination ; for he wills to go, and he will
go, are radically of the same import.

When a man expresses his own determination of mind, I
will, we are accustomed to consider the event, or act willed,
as certain; for we naturally connect the power to act, with
the intention; hence we make the declaration of will a.
ground of conﬁdence, and by an easy association of ideas,
we connect the declaration with an obligation to carry the
determination into effect. Hence will expressed by a per-
son himself, came to denote a promise.

But when a person declares the will of another, he is not
supposed to possess the power to decide for him; and to
carry his will into eﬂ‘ect. He merely offers an opinion,
grounded on information or probable circumstances, which
give him more or less conﬁdence of an event depending on
another’s will. Hence will in the second and third person
simply foretells, or expresses an opinion of what will take
place. 

Shall, in many of its inﬂections, retains its primitive sense”
——to be obliged or bound in duty; but in many of its uses,

* The primitive idea expressed by may was power; Sax. magan, to
be able.
1 It is supposed that the Roman 11 was pronounced as our w, wolo.

4 PREFACE.

he was creating. The words pluperfect and reter-pluper/‘eat,
which signify more than ﬁnished, beyond more t n ﬁnished, are
very awkward terms. For which reason I call the tense which
they designate, the p1ior—past, which denotes an act past prior to
another act, event or time. In like manner, the term prior;/'uture
is used to denote an act past prior to a future timeor event speci-
fied.

In this work, I have given a complete exhibition of the English
verb, in all its forms or combinations, declarative, interrogative and
negative. This will show foreigners, as well as our own youth, the
proper place of the auxiliaries, and of the sign of negation not, in
all the various combinations.

In all or most English Grammars, an or a is said to be an indeﬁ-
nite article. This is not true; it is used before deﬁnite nouns, as
well as before those which are indeﬁnite. It is also said, that a
becomes an before a vowel; but the fact is directly the reverse:
an is the original word, and losesthe n before a consonant. It is
the same word as one, but in Saxon orthography.

Grammars also tell us, that is sometimes a conjunction. This is
not true ; it is always a pronoun or substitute: when it is called a
“}uhgi1nCtl0n, it refers to a sentence.

In most grammars, notwithstanding is called a conjunction. This

is not true; it is a compound of not and the participle withstandi ,
and with that expressed or understood, or with a sentence, consu-
tuting the case absolute, like non obstante in Latin.

Provided is also called, in certain cases, a conjunction. This is
not true; it is a participle forming the case absolute, as above
stated, in regard to notwithstandin .

I is called also a conjunction. his is not true ; it is always 0.
ver , being only a contracted form of give. The fact is the same
withtﬁough; it is a verb, but defective.

Tothe syntax, I have added several new rules and illustrations;
the .B1'iti.shs,GsraInmars, in this particular, being very defective. In-
dead, so defective and erroneous are the British Grammars, and the
cnrnpilations ‘in the United States, formed on their principles, that
without some further helps, the construction of many established
andilegtitimate phrases and sentences in our language, cannot be

e%med. ; r

its sense is much varied. In the ﬁrst person, it merely fore-v
tells; as, “I shall go to New York to-morrow.” In this
phrase, the Word seems to have no reference to obligation;
nor is it considered by a second person as imposing an obli-
gation on the person uttering it. But when shall is used in
the second and third persons, it resumes its primitive sense,
or one nearly allied to it, implying obligation; as, when a
superior commands with authority, you shall go; or imply-
ing a right in the second and third person to expect, and
hence denoting a promise in the speaker; as, “you shall
receive your wages.” This is radically saying, “ you ought
to receive your wages;” but this right in the second person
to receive, implies an obligation in the person speaking to
pay. Hence shall in the ﬁrst person foretells; in the
second, promises, commands, or expresses determination.
When shall, in the second and third persons,is uttered with
emphasis, it expresses determination in the speaker, and
implies an authority to enforce the act. “You shall go.”

Hence proceeds the impropriety of using shall, when the
Supreme Being is supposed to be the person addressed or
spoken of. The Lord shall ﬁght for us—-—-the Lord shall
destroy them-——-the Lord shall comfort Zion. “ Thou shalt
not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.” Acts 13. 35.
See Ps. 16. 10. Acts 2. 27.

No human being has a right to use words respecting God
which imply authority or command. In the examples cited,
will is the proper auxiliary, expressing prediction.

But when shall is preceded by another word, as by when,
while, whoever,  provided, &c. it ceases, in the second and
third person, to express promise, command or determination;
as, When you shall have read the books; while he shall be
present; whoever shall put away his wife; if you shall see
my friend; provided you or he shall receive information. In
these and similar examples, shall refers to event merely,
Without implying obligation, promise or command.

Illast expresses necessity, and has no variation for per-
son, number or tense.

Do is a principal and a transitive verb, signifying to act
or malce; but is used in the present and past tenses as an
auxiliary, to give emphasis to a declaration, to denote con-
trast, or to supply the place of the principal verb.

“ It would have been impossible for Cicero to inﬂame the

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 59

minds of the people to so high a pitch against oppression,
considered in the abstract, as he actually did inﬂame them
against Verres the oppressor.”-——C'amp. Rhet. l. 10. Here
did expresses emphasis.

“It was hardly possible that he should not distinguish
you as he has done.”-——Cowp. Let. 40. Here done stands in
the place of distinguished you. For it must be observed
that when do is the substitute for another verb, it supplies
the place not only of the verb, but of the object of the verb.

“ He loves not plays
As thou dost, Antony.”

That is, as then lovest plays.

Do is also used in negative and interrogative sentences;
the present and past tenses of the indicative mode being
chieﬂy formed by this auxiliary; as, “I do not reside in
Boston.” Does John hold a commission’?

Have is also a principal and transitive verb, denoting to
possess; but much used as an auxiliary ; as, “ He has lately
been to Hamburg.” It is often used to supply_the place
of a principal verb or participle, preventing a repetition of
it, and the object after it; as, “I have not seen Paris, but
my brother has”—-—that is, has seen Paris.

Equally common and extensive is the use of be, denoting
existence, and hence called the substantive verb. Either in
the character of a principal verb, or an auxiliary, it is found
in almost every sentence of the language.

The inﬂection of‘ a verb, in all the modes, tenses, num-
bers and persons, is termed ~ Conjugation. The English
verbs have few inflections, or changes of termination; most
of the tenses and modes being formed by means of the aux-
iliaries.

N orE.——In the following conjugations, a small n in an Italic charac-
ter, is inserted in the place where not should stand in negative sen-
tences. The same placeis generally occupied by never, but not in every

case. It is believed this letter will be very useful, especially to foreign-
ers. The learner may conjugate the verb with or without not, at pleasure.

No'rn.—A command, request or exhortation must, in the nature of
things, be addressed to the second person; nor can these phrases, let me
have, let us have, be considered, in strictness, as the ﬁrst person of this
mode; nor let him have, as the third.

The true force and effect of the verb, in this mode, depend on its ap-
plication to characters, and the manner of utterance. Came, go, let him
go, if uttered with a respectful address, or in a civil manner, may ex-
press entreaty, request or exhortation. On the other hand, such words
uttered with a tone of authority, and addressed to inferiors, express
command.

CONDITIONAL OR SUBJUNCTIVE MODE.

The Conditional or Subjunctive Mode is the same as the
Indicative ; with some preceding word expressing condition,
supposition or contingency. These words are if, though, or
although, unless, except, whether, lest, albeit. -

If is a corruption of  the imperative of gifan, the
Saxon orthography of give. Though, the Saxon theah,
signiﬁes permit, allow. Although is a compound of all and
though, give or allow all. The old word thqf, still used in
some parts of England, is the imperative of the Saxon tha-
ﬁan, to allow. Unless is the imperative of the Saxon on-
lesan, to loose, or dissolve. Except is the imperative of
that verb. Lest is from lesan, to loose or dissolve. Albeit
is a compound of all, be and it, let it be so.

These words, if, though, answer in signiﬁcation and use,
to the following: admit, grant, allow, suppose, as signs
of a condition or hypothesis: “ If you shall go,” is simply
“give, you shall go ;” that is, give that condition or fact;
allow or suppose it to be so.

It has been, and is still customary for authors to omit the
personal terminations of the second and third persons of the
verb in the present tense, to form the subjunctive mode; 
thou go,  he write.

The correct construction of the subjunctive mode is pre-
cisely the same as that of the indicative; as it is used in
popular practice, which has preserved the true idiom of the
language;  thou hast,  he has or hath; to denote present
uncertainty. But a future contingency may be expressed
by the omission of the personal terminations;  he go, that
is,  he shall go.

Be.

Be is a verb denoting existence, and therefore nailed the
substantive verb. It is very irregular, ‘being derived from
different radicals, and having undergone many dialectica,
changes.

be, for  he shall be.

The following is the form of expressing supposition or
hypothesis, and may be called the

Hypothetical Tense.

If I were We were
Thou wert Ye were

{ You was or were A You were
He were They were

“If I were,” supposes I am not; “if I were not,” sup-
poses I am.*
The other tenses are the same as in the indicative mode.

* No fault is more common than the misapplication of this tense. In
the Saxon, were was often used in the third person of the indicative
mode, and without a preceding sign of condition ; as in these examples-—
"After thisum hafde se cyng mycel getheat, and swithe deope space
with his witan ymbe this land, hu hit were gesett.”——Sa:z:. Charon. ﬁn.
1085. “ After this the King held a great council, and made important
representations respecting t is land, how it were settled.” , In the Ger-
man, the inﬂection of the word, in the imperfect tense of the indicative,
is-—Ich war, du warest, er war, he were. The orthography of the word,
in the imperfect tense of the sub‘unctive, is were, and our early English
writers seem to have confounde the two tenses. The regular Saxon
verb in the past tense of the indicative, was thus inﬂected——Ic wees, du
were, he wees. .Hence our greatest writers, Milton, Dryden,‘Pope and
others, retained that form of the word—-Before the heavens thou wart ;
remember what thou wart-—expressions which Lowth condemns as not
analogous to the formation of words in different modes. I would con-
demn this use of the verb also, but for a different reason; it is now
obsolete. _

But the use of this form of the verb is retained in the subjunctive
mode, which, Eu; grammars teach us, must follow the signs of condi-

tion—-i—z:f, though, unless, whether-—a rule which, without qualiﬁcation,
has a mischievous effect. On carefully examining the original state of

the language, I ﬁnd the common and true use of were in the sin ular

number, is, to express h othesis or supposition. Thus, Sam. 0 ran.
ad armam 1017. On the t ird of the ides of December, at night, the
moon appeared—-“ svv lce he eall blodig wwre”—-such, or, as, zf, he all
bloody were--and the aven was red, "‘ swylce hit bryne wtere”—-as if '
it were on ﬁre. This use of were, in‘ the singular’ number, is legitimate,
and is still retained by good writers—but its use to express a mere un-
certainty respectin a past event, after a si n of condition, is obsolete or
not legitimate. T e following examples will illustrate the distinction-
“ Whether the killing were malicious or not, is no farther a subject of
inquiry,” &c.—Jad e Parker, trial of Selfridge, p. 161. Here were is
improperly used. 0 also where the fact is admitted: “Though he
were a son, yet learned he obedience.”--—Heb. 5. 8, where Lowth justly
condemns the use’ of were-“ Unless a felony were attempted or intend-
ed.”-—Selfn' e’s Trial, p. 125. It ought to be was.

The following is the true sense of were in the singular nurnber—-
“ Were it necessar for you to take your books with you ?”‘--Jud e Par-
ker, Ihm. 159. y“ f it were possible, they would deceive the e eet.”-

OF LANGUAGE.

LANGUAGE, in its most extensive sense, is the instrument
or means of communicating ideas and affections of the mind
and body, from one animal to another. In this sense, brutes
possess the powers of language; for by various inarticulate
sounds, they make known their wants, desires and suffer.

ings. Thus the neighing of the horse, the lowing of the ox, '

the cackling and chirping of birds, constitute the language
of those animals; and each respective species ‘understand
instinctively their own peculiar language. The signs made
by deaf and dumb people form also a kind of imperfect lan-
guage ; and even the looks, when made to express ideas and
affections, speak an intelligible language. i

As brutes have few affections or ideas, and little neces-
sity for communicating them, their language consists in a
few inarticulate sounds. But man, being   a rational animal,
capable of acquiring, and of learning to communicate num-
berless ideas, is furnished with suitable organs for uttering
an indefinite variety of sounds to express his ideas; and the
modulations of his voice, in the distinct utterance of sounds,
by opening and closing the organs, constitute wha’tiareLd”e-
nominated articulate sounds.

DIVISION OF LANGUAGE.

Language is of two kinds, spoken and written. The ele-

ments of spoken language are articulate sounds, uttered by
the voice, which is formed by the air issuing through‘ the
glottis, a small aperture in the wind pipe, and modulated by
articulations of the throat, tongue, palate, teeth, and lips.
This is the original and proper sense of the word language.

But as sounds are ﬂeeting, and not capable of being com-
municated to a great distance, if men had no other means of
communicating their thoughts, their intercourse would be
limited to a small compass, and their ideas would be en-

Some authors omit the personal terminations in the se-
cond and third persons-—--zf than love,  he love. With this
single variation, which I deem contrary to the principles of
our language, the subjunctive mode differs not in the least
from the indicative, and to form it the learner has only to
preﬁx a sign of condition, as, though, unless, &c. to the
indicative, in its several tenses: With this exception, how-
ever, that in the future tense, the auxiliary may be and often
is suppressed. Thus instead of

If I shell or will love We shall or will love
Thou shalt or wilt love Ye shall or will love
You shal-1 or will love You shall or will love

He shall or will love They shall or will love

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 69

Authors write,

If, &c. I love We love
Thou love Ye love
You love You love
He love They love

It is further to be remarked, that should is very often used
to form the conditional future-—-if 1 should, thou slwuldst,
&c. This tense is inﬂected like the past tense, but is pro-
bably, more used for the conditional future than shall and
will.

The other auxiliaries also in the past time are used in this
conditional mode in a very indeﬁnite sense.

I shall therefore offer a new tense in this mode composed
of any principal verb, with might, could, should, and would,
expressing, like the Greek aorists, time indeﬁnite present,
past or future, especially the future.

In the subjunctive mode, there is a peculiarity in the tenses
which should be noticed. When I say, if it rains, it is un-
derstood that I am uncertain of the fact, at the time of

speaking. But when I say, “  it rained, we should be ob-

liged to seek shelter,” it is not understood that I am uncer-
tain of the fact; on the contrary, it is understood that I am
certain, it does not rain at the time of speaking. Or if I
say, “if it did not rain, I would take a walk,” I convey the
idea that it does rain at the moment of speaking. This form
of our tenses in the subjunctive mode has never been the
subject of much notice, nor ever received its due explana-
tion and arrangement. For this hypothetical verb is actu-
ally a present tense, or at least indeﬁnite,--it certainly
does not belong to past time. It is further to be remarked,
that a negative sentence always implies an aﬂirmative--“ if

70 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

it did not rain,” implies that it does rain. On the contrary,
an affirmative sentence implies a negative--“ if it did rain,”
implies that it does. not.

In the past time, a similar distinction exists; for “if it
rained yesterday,” denotes uncertainty in the speaker’s mind
--—but “ if it had not rained yesterday,” implies a certainty,
that it did rain.

Let the learner be instructed that in interrogative sen‘-r

IRREGULAR VERBS.

All verbs whose past tense and perfect participle do not
end in ed are deemed irregular. The number of these is
about one hundred and seventy-seven. They are of three
kinds. .

1. Those whose past tense and participle of the perfect

are the sameas the present; as, beat, burst, cast, cost, cut,

hit, hurt, let, put, read, rid, set, shed, shred, shut, slit, split,
spread, thrust, sweat, wet. Wet has sometimes wetted; heat
sometimes hat; but the practice is not respectable.

2. Verbs whose past time and participle are alike, but dif-
ferent from the present; as, meet, met; sell, sold.

3. Verbs whose present and past tenses and participle are
all different; as, know, knew; known.

A few‘ verbs ending with ch, ck, 2:, 19, ll, 4235, though regu
lar, suffer a contraction ‘of ed into 25, as, snatcht for snatched,
checkt for checked, snapt for snapped, mixt for mixed, dwelt
for dwelled, past for passed. Others have a digraph short-
ened; as, dream, dreamt; feel, felt; mean, meant; sleep,
slept; deal, dealt. In afew,v is changed into f; as, bereave,
bereft; leave, left.

As some of the past tenses and participles are obsolete or
obsolescent, it is deemed proper to set these in separate col-
umns, in italics, for the information of the student.

trusted to memory and tradition only; by which they would
soon be obscured, perverted, or forgotten. Hence the in-
vention of characters to represent sounds, exhibit them to
the eye, and render them durable. This was the origin of
written language. The elements of this language are let-
ters or characters, which, by consent of men, and common
usage, are combined into words, and made to represent the
articulate sounds uttered by the voice. These characters
being easily inscribed or engraved upon durable substances,
as paper, parchment, wood and stone, render language per-
manent, and capable of being transmitted from age to‘ age,
and of being communicated over the habitable globe. Of
this art, it is not easy to decide which deserves to be most
admired, the diﬂiculty, the ingenuity, or the ussefu-lness of
the invention.
or GRAMMAR.

Grammar, as a science, treats of the natural connection
between ideas, and words which are the signs of ideas, and
develops the principles which are common to all languages.
These principles are not arbitrary, nor subject to change,
but ﬁxed and permanent; being founded on facts and dis-
t.in('-tions established by nature.   Thus the distinction be-
tween the sexes; between things and their qualities; be»-
tween the names of substances and of their actions or mo-
tions ; between/junity and plurality; between the present,
past and future time, and some other distinctions, are found’-
ed in nature, and give rise to different species of words, and
to various inflections in all languages.

The grammar of a particular language is a system of gen-
eral principles, derived from natural distinctions of words
and of particular rules,deduced from the customary forms
of speech, in the nation using that language. These usages
are mostly arbitrary, or of accidental origin ; but when they
becomecomrnon to a nation, they are to be considered as
established, and received as rules of the highest authority.

A rule, therefore‘, is an established form of construction
in a particular class of words. Thus the usual addition of
s or es, to a noun, to denote plurality, being a general prac-
tice, constitutes a rule.

An exception to a rule, is the deviation of certain words
from the common construction. Thus man, if regularly
formed in the plural, would be mans; but custom having

N O.T.E 1.——The old forms of the past tense, sang, spake, sprang, for-
get, &c. are here placed among the obsolete words. They are entirely‘
obsolete, in ordinary practice, whether popular or polite ; and it seems
advisable not to attempt to revive them. In addition to this reason for
omitting them, there is one which is not generally understood. The"
sound of a in these and all other like cases, was ori inally the broad a
or aw; which sound, in the Gothic and Saxon,.as in t e modern Scotch,
corresponded nearly with o in spoke, swore. Sjooke is therefore nearer
to the original than spake, as we now pronounce the vowel a with its
first or long sound, as in suite.

N ore 2.—In the use of the past tense and participle of some of these
verbs, there is a diversity of practice; some authors retaining those
which others have rejected as obsolete. Many words which were in
use in the days of Shakspeare and Lord Bacon‘, are now wholly laid aside ;
others are used only in books, while others are obsolescent, being occa-
sionally used; and‘ a few of the old‘ participles, having lost the verbal’
character, are used only as attributes. Of the last mentioned species,
are fraught, drunken, molten, beholden,’ sham, boumien, cloven. Holpen
is entirely obsolete. Holden, swollen, gotten, are nearly obsolete in OOH].-r
mon parlance. Wrought is evidently obsolescent.

Bishop Lowthl‘ has attempted to revive the use of many of the obsolese
cent past tenses and’ participles, for which he has, and Ipthink deserved-
ly, incurred the severe animadversions of eminent critics. “ Is it not
surprising (says Campbell on Rhetoric, b. ii.._ch. 2.) that one of Lowth’s
ﬁznetration should think a single person entitled to revive a form of in-

ction in a particular word, which had been re’ect'ed by all good writ-
ers of every denomination, for more than a hun red and ﬁfty ears ?”--
This writer declares what Lowth has advanced on the use of? the past
tense and participle, to be inconsistent with the very ﬁrst principles of
grammar. He observes justly that authority is every thing‘ in language,
and that this authority consists in reputable, national, present usage.

Independent of authority, however, there are substantial reasons in
the language itself for layin aside the participles ending with en, and
for removing the differences etween the past time and participle. In
opposition to the opinion of Lowth, who regrets that our language" has so

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 79

few inﬂections, and maintains that we should preserve all we have, I
think it capable of demonstration that the differences between the past
time and participle of the past tense of our irregular verbs, is one of the
greatest inconveniences in the language. If we used personal termina-
tions to form our modes and tenses, like the Greeks, it would be desira-
ble that they should be carefully retained. But as we have no other
than about half‘ a dozen different terminations, and are therefore obliged
to form our modes and tenses by means of auxiliaries, the combination of
these forms a part of the business of learning the language, which is ex-
tremely difficult and perplexing to foreigners. Even the natives of Scot-
land and Ireland do not always surmount the difficulty. This difficulty
is very much augmented by the difference between the past tense and
the participle. To remove this difference, in words in which popular
usage has given a lead, is to obviate, in a degree, this inconvenience.
This is recommended by another circumstance——it will so far reduce our
irregular verbs to an analogy with the regular, whose past tense and par-
ticiple of the perfect are alike. i

In a number of words, the dropping of n in the participle wil-l make
a convenient distinction between the participle and- the adjective 3 for in
the latter, we always retain the en——we always say a written treatise, a
spoken language, a hidden mystery——-though the best authors write, a
“mystery hid rom ages;” “ the language spoke in Bengal.”

Defective Verbs.

Verbs which want the past time or participle, are deemed
defective. Of these we have very few. The auxiliaries
may, can, will, shall, must, having no participle, belong to
this class. Ought is used in the present and past tenses on-
ly, with the regular inﬂection of the second person only--I
ought, thou oughtest, he ought, we, you, they ought. Quoth
is wholly obsolete, except in poetry and burlesque. It has
no inﬂection, and is used chieﬂy in the third person, with
the nominative follow-ing it, quoth he.

I/Wt, to know, is obsolete, except in the inﬁnitive, to in-
troduce an explanation or enumeration of particulars; as,
“There are seven persons, to wit, four men and three wo-
men.” Wot and wist are entirely obsolete.

Adverbs or Modgﬁers.

Adverbs are a secondary part of speech. Their uses. are
to enlarge, restrain, limit, deﬁne, and in short, to modify the
sense of other Words.

Adverbs may be classed according to their several uses.

1. Those which qualify the actions expressed by verbs and
participles; as, “a good man lives-piously,-” “a room is
elegantly furnished.” Here piously denotes the manner-of
livz’ng—--elegantly denotes the manner of being furnished.
The words of this kind, which are very numerous, are really
compound adjectives, formed by annexing the attribute like

80 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

to any other attribute——pious-like, elegant-like. The phrases
mentioned, when expressed according to the primitive
idiom, stand thus: “he lives pious-like;.” “a room elegant-
like furnished.” So that the most numerous class of modi-
ﬁers of verbs are really attributes or adjectives; but being
used as the qualiﬁers of verbs and other attributes, and not
to express the qualities of names, they may well take a dif-
ferent appellation.

In this class may be ranked a number of other Words ;. as,.
when, soon, then, where, whence, hence, and many others,
whose use is to modify verbs.

2. Another class of modiﬁers are words usually called prep-
osrtions, used with verbs to vary their signiﬁcation; for
which purpose they generally follow them in construction;

as, to fall on, give out, bear with, cast up; or they are pre-

ﬁxed and become apart of the word; as, overcome, under-
lay. In these uses, these words modify, or change the sense
of the verb; and when preﬁxed, are united with the verb in
orthography.

A few, modiﬁers admit the termination of comparison; as,
soon, sooner, soonest; often, oftener, oftenest. Most of
those which end in ly, may ‘be compared by more and most,
less, and least; as, more justly, more excellently; less hon-
estly, least criminally.

No'rE.—-—The numerous distinctions of adverbs» into those of time , place
and quantity, casual, illative, adversative, &c. seem to be more perplex-
ing than useful. We might as Well make the deﬁnition of every word
in our dictionaries the foundation of a class, as to recognize the divisions

of this species of words, with which the ingenuity of authors has ﬁlled-
our grammars. ’

Prepositions.
Prepositions, so called from their being put before other

words, serve to connect Words and show the relation be- i

tween them, or to show the condition of things. Thus, a
man of benevolence, denotes a man who possesses benevo-
lence. Christ was cruciﬁed between two thieves. Receive
the book from John and give it to Thomas.

The prepositions most common are, to, for, by, of, in,
into, on, upon, among, between, betwixt, up, over, under, be-
neath, against, from, out, with, through, at, towards, befvre,
behind, after, without, across. "

r We have a number of particles, which serve to varycyr
modify “the words to which they are preﬁxed, and which are
somatimes called inseparaélee prepositions, because they are

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 81

never used but as parts of other words——such are a, be, con,
mis, pre, re, sub, in abide, become, eorgoin, mistake, prrﬁsr,
return, sulyoin, &.c. These may be called preﬁxes.

Connectives or Coiyzmctions.

Connectives are words which unite words and sentences.

in construction, joining two or more simple sentences into
one compound one, and continuing the sentence at the pleas-
ure of the writer or speaker. They also begin sentences

after a full period, manifesting some relation between sen-

tences in the general tenor of discourse.

The connectives of most generaluse, are, and, or, either,
nor, neither, but, than. '

And is supposed to denote an addition ; as, “The book is
worth four shillings and sixpence.” That is, it is worth four
shillings, add sixpence, or with sixpence added. “ John're-
sides at New-York, and Thomas at Boston.” That is, John
resides at New-York, add [add this which follows] Thomas
resides at Boston. From the great use of this connective
in joining words of which the same thing is aﬁirmed or pre-
dicated, it may be justly called the eopulative by way of
eminence.  

The distinguishing use of the connective is to save the
repetition of words ; for this sentence, “ John, Thomas and
Peter reside at York,” contains three simple sentences;
“ John resides at York”--—“ Thomas resides at York”-—-“ Pe-
ter resides at York ;” which are all combined into one, with
a single verb and predicate, by means of the copulative.

Either and or have been already explainedunder the head
of substitutes; for in strictness they are the representatives
of sentences or words ; but as or has totally lost that char-
acter, both these words will be here considered as connect-
ives. Their use is to express an alternative, and I shall call
them alternatives. Thus, “Either John or Henry will be
at the Exchange,” is an alternative sentence; the verb or
predicate belonging to one or the other, but not to both;
and whatever may be the number of names or propositions
thus joined by or, the verb and predicate belong to one only.

One very common use of or, is to join to a word or sen-
tence, something added by way of explanation or deﬁnition.
'I‘hus, “‘ N0 disease of the mind can more fatally disable it
from benevolence than ill-humor or peevishness.” Ram-
bler, Na. '74. Here peevishnes-sits not intended as a distinct

82 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

thing from ill-humor, but as another term for the same idea
In this case, or expresses only an alternative of words, and
not of signiﬁcation.  

As either and or are affirmative of one or other of the par-
ticulars named, so neither and nor are negative of all the
particulars. Thus, “ For I am persuaded that neither death,
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any
other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of
God.”--Rom. 8. 38. Here neither is in fact a substitute
for each of the following particulars-——-all of which it denies
to be able to effect a certain purpose--not either of these
which follow shall separate us from the love of God. It is
laid down as a rule in our grammars, that nor must always
answer to neither ;v-. but this is a great mistake, for the nega-
tion of neither, not either, extends to every one of the fol-
lowing alternatives. But nor is more generally used, and
in many cases, as in the passage just recited, is far the most
emphatical. '

But is used for two Saxon words, originally by mistake,
but now by established custom; bet or bote, the radical of
our modern words better, boot, and denoting snﬂieiency, com-
pensation, more, further, or something additional, by way
of amendment; and beuton or butan, equivalent to without
or except. i

In the former sense, we have the word in this sentence;
“John resides at York, but Thomas resides at Bristol.”
The primitive sense here is, John resides at York; more,
add or supply, Thomas resides at Bristol. It does not al-
ways signify opposition, as is usually supposed, but some
addition to the sense of what goes before.

In the latter sense, or that of butan, it is used in this pas-
sage, ?“ He hath not grieved me, but in part.”---F3 Cor. 2. 5.
That is, “ He hath not grieved me, except in part.” The
ﬁrst assertion is a complete negation; the word but (beutan)
introduces an exception. “ Nothing, but true religion, can
give us peace in death.” Here also is a complete negation;
with a saving introduced by but. Nothing, except true reli-

ion.
g These were the only primitive uses of but, until, by means
of a mistake, a third sense was added,rwhich is that of only.
Not knowing the origin and true meaning of but, authors
omitted the negation in certain phrases where it wastes-

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 83

sential to a true construction; as in the following passages:
“ Our light aﬂiiction, which is but for amoment.”--42 Cor. 4.
“ If they kill us, we shall but die/’——2 Ifings 7.

The but, in these passages, is buton, be out,.except'; and,
according to the true original sense, not should precede, to
give the sentence a negative turn : “Our light aﬂliction is
not, but (except) for a moment.” “ We shall not, but die.”
As they now stand, they would in strictness signify, Our
light affliction is except for a moment~—-—We can except die,
which would not be sense. To correct the sense, and repair
the breach made in the true English idiom, by this mis-
take, we must give but a new sense, equivalent to only. Thus
we are obliged to patch and mend, to prevent the mischiefs
of innovation.

The history of this word but should’ be, as Johnson ex-
presses the idea, “ a guide to reformers, and a terror to in-
novators.” The ﬁrst blunder or innovation blended two
words of distinct meanings into one, in orthography and
pronunciation. Then the sense and etymology being ob-
scured, authors proceeded to a further change, and suppress-
ed the negation, which was essential to the baton. We have
now therefore one word with t.hree different. and unallied
meanings; and to these may be reduced the whole of John-
s0n’s eighteen deﬁnitions of but.

Let us however trace the mischief of this change a little
further. As the word but is now used, a sentence may have
the same meaning with or without the negation. For exam-
ple: “ he hath not grieved me, but in part”-——and “ he hath
grieved me, but in part,” have, according to our present use
of but, precisely the same meaning. Or compare different
passages of scripture, as they now stand in our Bibles.

He hath not grieved me, but in part.
Our light affliction is but for a moment.

This however is not all ; for the innovation being directed-
neither by knowledge nor judgment, is not extended to all
cases, and in a large proportion of phrases to which but be-
longs, it is used in its original sense with a preceding nega-
tion, especially with nothing and none. “There is none
good, but one, that is God.”--Zllatt. 19. 17. This is cor-
rect--there is none good, except one, that is God. “ He

  saw a ﬁg-tree in the way, and found nothing thereon but

leaves only.”--—Z|Iatt. $21. 19. This is also correct-—-“ he

84 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

found nothing, except leaves ;” the only is redundant. “ It
amounts to no more but this.”—-—Loc/cc, Und. b. 1. 2. This
is a correct English phrase ; “ It amounts to no more, except
this ;” but it is nearly obsolete.

Hence the propriety of these phrases ; “ They could not,
but be known before.”---Locke, 1. 2. “ The reader may be,
nay, cannot chuse but be, very fallible in the understanding
of it.”—-—L0clcc, 3.9. Here but is used in its true sense—-—-
They could not, except this, be known before. That is, the
contrary was not possible. The other phrase is frequently
found in Shakspeare and other old writers, but is now obso-
lete. They cannot clmse but—-—-that is, they have no choice,
power or alternative, except to be very fallible.

But is called in our grammars, a disjunctive conjunction,
connecting sentences, but expressing opposition in the sense.

. To illustrate the use of this word which joins and digjoins

at the same time, Lowth gives this example: “ You and I
rode to London, but Peter staid at home.” Here the bishop
supposed the but to express an opposition in the sense. But
let but be omitted, and What difference will the omission
make in the sense ? “ You and I rode to London, Peter staid
at home.” Is the opposition in the sense less clearly mark-
ed than when the conjunction is used’! By no means. And
the truth is, that the opposition in the sense, when there is
any, is never expressed by the connective at all, but always
by the following sentence or phrase : “ They have mouths,
but they speak not ; eyes have they, but they see not.”—-
Psalm 115. 5. Let but be omitted—-—“ They have mouths,
they speak not; eyes have they, they see not.” The omis-
sion of the connectives makes not the smallest alteration in
the sense, so far as opposition or difference of idea in the
members of the sentence is concerned. Indeed the bishop
is most unfortunate in the example selected to illustrate his
rule; for the copulative and may be used for but, without
the least alteration in the sense : “ You and I rode to Lon-
don, and Peter staid at home.” In this sentence the oppo-
sition is as completely expressed as if but was used ; which
proves that the opposition in the sense has no dependence
on the connective.

Nor is it true that an opposition in the sense always fol-
lows but: “ Man shallvnotlive by bread alone, but by every
word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God.”-—Matt.
4. 4. Here the last clause expresses no opposition, but

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 85

merely an additional fact. The true sense of but when
used for bate, issupply, more, further, something additional,
to complete the sense—--it may be in opposition to what has
preceded or in continuation only. In general, however, the
word but is appropriately used before a clause of a sentence,
intended to introduce a new and somewhat different idea, by
way of modifying the sense of the preceding clause. This
use is very naturally deducedfrom the original sense of the
word, something further which is to make complete or quali-
-fy what has preceded.

Than is a connective of comparison: “ John is taller than
Peter.”

Because is a mere compound of by and cause--by cause.
"‘ It is the case of some to contrive some false periods of busi-
ness, because they may seem men of dispatch.”-—Bac0n, of
Dispatch. See also Apoth. 7. 6. This is a correct English
idiom, Dr. Lowth’s criticism to the contrary notwithstand-
ing; but it is now obsolete.

Easclamations.

Exclamations are sounds uttered to express passions and
emotions ; usually those which are violent or sudden. They
are called inteijections, words thrown in between the parts
of a sentence. But this is not always the fact, and the name
is insigniﬁcant. The more appropriate name is exclama-
-tions; as they are mere irregular sounds, uttered as passion
dictates, and not subject to rules.

A few of these sounds however become the customary

modes of expressing particular passions and feelings in eve-c

ry nation. Thus in English, joy and surprise and ‘grief are
expressed by oh, uttered with a different tone and counte-
nance. Alas expresses grief or great sorrow——pish, pshaw,
express contempt. Sometimes verbs, names, and attributes
are uttered by way of exclamation in a detached manner;
as, Hail! Welcome ! Bless me!

In twoor three instances, exclamations are followed by
names and substitutes in the nominative and objective-—-as, 0
than in the nominative--ah me in the objective. Sometimes
that follows 0, expressing a. wish—-—-‘‘ 0 that the Lord would
guide my ways.” But in such cases, we may consider wish
or some other veg) to be understood.

Derivation.

Hownvea numerous may be the Words in a language, the
number of radical words is small. Most words are formed
from others by addition of certain Words or syllables,
which were originally distinct Words, but which have lost
their distinct character, and are now used only in combina-
tion with other words. ’ Thus er, in lover, is a contraction of
war, a Saxon word denoting man, [the Latin m'r;] ness de-
notes state or condition; ly is an abbreviation of like or
liche ; fy is from facio, to make, &c.

Most of the English derivatives fall under the following
heads:

1. Names‘ formed from names, or more generally from
verbs, by the addition of r, er or or, denoting an agent ; as,
lover, hater, assignor, ﬂatterer, from love, hate, assign, ﬂat-
ter. In a few instances, words thus formed are less regular;
as, glazier from glass, courtier from court, parishioner from
parish.

2. Names converted into verbs by the preﬁx to, as, from
water, cloud, to water, to cloud. V

3. Attributes converted into verbs in the same manner;
as, to lame, to cool, to warm, from lame, cool, warm.

4. Verbs formed from names and attributes by the termi-
nation ize; as method, methodize ; system, systemize; mor-
al, moralize. When the primitive ends with a vowel, the
consonant t is preﬁxed to the termination; as stigma, stig-
matlze.

5. Verbs formed from names and attributes by the addition
of en or n ; as, lengthen, widen, from length, wide.

6. Verbs formed by fy; as brutify, stratify, from brute,
stratum. i

7. Names or nouns formed from attributes by ness ; as
goodness from good ; graclousness from gracious.

8. Names formed by dam and ric, denoting jurisdiction;
as, kingdom, bishopric, from king~and bishop. Dam and ric
are nouns denoting jurisdiction or territory.

9. Names formed by hood and ship, denoting state or con-
dition; as, manhood, lordship, from man, lord.

10. Names ending in ment and age, from the French, de-
noting state or act; as, commandment, parentage, from’ com-
mand, parent.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 8'7

11. Names in er, or, and ee, used by way of opposition,
the former denoting the agent, the latter the receiver, or per-
son to whom an act is performed ‘; as, assignor, assignee;
indorser, indorsee.  

12. Adjectives or attributes formed from names by the
addition of y; as, healthy, from health; pithy, from pith;
or ly added to the name; as, stately, from state. Ly is a con-
traction of like.

13. Attributes formed from names by the addition of ful ‘}
as, hopeful, from hope.

14. Attributes formed from names or verbs by ible or
able; as, payable, from pay; creditable, from credit; com-
pressible, from compress. Able denotes power or capacity.

15. Attributes formed from names or attributes by ish;
as, whitish, from white; blackish, from black; waggish, from
wag.

16. Attributes formed from names by less ; as, fatherless,
from father ; noting destitution.

17. Attributes formed from names by ous; as, famous,

from fame ; gracious, from grace.

‘I8. Attributes formed by adding some to names; as, de-
lightsome, from delight.

19. Modiﬁers formed from attributes by ly; "as, sweetly,
from sweet.

20. Names to express females formed by adding ess to
the masculine gender ; as, heiress, from heir.

21. Names ending in ty, some directly from the Latin,
others formed from attributes; as, responsibility, from re-
sponsible; contractility, from contractile; probity, from
probitas.

22. Attributes formed by adding al to names ; as nation-
al, from nation.

23. Attributes ending in is mostly from the Latin, or
French, but some of them by the addition of is to a name ;
as, balsamic, from balsam; sulphuric, from sulphur.

24. Names formed by ate to denote the union of sub-
stances in salts ‘; as, carbonate, in the chimical nomenclature,
denotes carbonic acid combined with anotherbody.

established the use of men as its plural, the word is an ex-
ception to the general rule.

Grammar is commonly divided into four parts——orthogra-
phy, etymology, syntax and prosody.

Orthography treats of the letters, their powers and com-
binations in syllables; or, it teaches the true manner of writ-
ing words, called spelling.

Etymology treats of the derivationrof words from their
radicals or primitives, and of their various inﬂections and
modiﬁcations to express person, number, case, sex, time and
mode.

Syntax explains the true mode of constructing sentences.

Prosody treats of the quantity or accent of syllables and
the laws of versiﬁcation.

No'r1:.--In this compilation, the only subjects treated are, a part of
etymology, and syntax and prosody.

OF LETTERS.

The elements, or ﬁrst principles of language, are articu-
late sounds, and letters or characters, which represent them.

There are in the English language twenty-six letters,
which represent sounds or articulations: A. a.-—B. b.---
C. c.—-D. d.-—-E. e.--F. f.—--G. g.-—H. h.———I.,i.--J.  k.
--L. l.—M. m.--N. n.--0. o.—-P. p.—--Q. q.—-R. r.-—-S. s.-—--
T. t.-——U. u.—-—V. v.——W. W.-—-X. x.-Y. y.-—Z. z. Of these,
J and X represent a combination of articulations.

Letters are of two kinds—-vowels and consonants; or,
more strictly, of three kinds--—vowels, consonants and aspi-
rates.

A vowel is a vocal or open sound; or a simple sound,
uttered by opening the mouth in a particular manner. A
simple sound is one which is begun and continued at pleas-
ure, with the same position of the organs, as---a, e, 0, and
the broad a or aw; the Italian ‘a as in father, and 0-0, which
in English represents the Italian u and French on.

An articulation is the forming of a joint—-a jointing or
closing of the organs of speech; by which the voice is whol-

Syntax.

Syntax teaches the rules to be observed in the construc-
tion of sentences.

A sentence is a number of Words arranged in due order,
and forming a complete aﬂirmation or proposition. In phi-
losophical language, a sentence consists of a subject and a
predicate,,, connected: by an aﬂirmation. Thus, “ God is om-
nipotemt,” is a complete proposition or sentence, composed of
God, the subject, omnipotent, the predicate or thing aﬁirmed,
connected by the verb is, which forms the affirmation.

The predicate is often included in the verb; as, “ The sun
shines.”

A simple sentence then contains one subject and one per-
sonal verb; that is, the name and the verb; and without
these, no proposition can beformed.

A compound sentence consists of two or more simple sen-
tences, joined by connectives. The divisions of a compound
sentence may be called members or clauses.

Sentences are declaratory, as, I am writing; the wind
blows--—imperative,. as, go, retire, be quiet-—z'nterr0gative,
as, where am I’! who art thou’! or conditional, as, if he
should arrive.

The rules for the due construction of sentences fall under
three heads. First, concord or agreement-—-»S'econd, gov-
ernment- Third, arrangement and punctuation.

Concord is the agreement of words in construction; as,
verbs in person and number with their nomvinatives; adjec-
tives with nouns, in number, case, and gender.

on THE ENGLISH‘ LANGUA“GE.. 89

Government is when one word requires another to be in
a particular case, mode or position.

In agreement, the name or noun is the controlling word,
as it carries with it the verb, the substitute and the attribute.
In government, the verb is the controlling word; but names
and prepositions have their share of inﬂuence also.

RULE I.

A verb must agree with its nominative in number and
person.

Examples.

In solemn style. “ Thou hast loved ri.ghteousness.”——-
Heb. 1. 9.

“ Thou madest man a little lower than the angels, and
crownedst him with glory and honor.”-——I{eb. 2.. 7 ..

“ Thou shalt not steal.”-—C'ommandment.
“ Art thou called, being a servant ’l”—-1 Cor. 7. $21.

“ But ye are washed; but ye are sanctified.”-—~l Car.

“Know ye not that we shall jusdge angels ’!”—-1 Car. 6. 3.

“ Do ye not hnourthat the saints shall judge the world ’l”

N orn 1.-—~The nominative to a- verb. is: found by young learners, by
asking who or what does What is affirmed, “ Eumen.-es, a youn man of
great abilities-, inherited a large estate from his father. His fat 1*, bar-
assed with com titions, and perplexed with a multiplicity of business,
recommended t e quiet of a private station..” Let the question he ask-_
ed, Who inherited a. large estate ? The answer is, Eumenes, which is the
nominative to the verb inherited. Who recommended the quiet of a
private station? His father, which is therefore the nominative to the
verb recommended;

fN}(l)’I7'E. 2.—-Let the following rules be observed respecting the position
0 t e nominative :-—-

I. The nominative usually precedes the verb in declarato-
ry phrases; as, “God created the world;” “the law is a
rule of right.” But the nominative may be separated from

8 as

90 MN mpnovnn GRAMMAR

its verb, by a member of a period; as, “Liberty, say the fana-
tic favorers of popular power, can only be found in a de-r
mocracy!’--—-Anach. ch. 62.

II. The nominative often follows an intransitive verb, for
such, a verb can have no object after it, and that position of I
the nominative creates no ambiguity: thus, “Above it stood

the seraph2'm.”-——Isa. 6. “ Gradual sinks the breeze.”--
Thomson.

III. When the verb is preceded by here, there, hence,
thence, then, thus, yet, so, nor, neither, such, the same, here-
in, therein, wherein, and perhaps by some other words, the
nominative may follow the verb, especially be; as, “here
are five men ;” ‘f there was a man sent from God 3” “hence
arise wars;” “thence proceed our vicious habits;” “then
came the scribes and Pharisees ;” “thus saith the Lord.”
“ Yet required not I bread of the governor.”-——-Neh. 5. 18».
“So panteth my soul after thee, O Lord.”--Psalm 42.
“Neither hath this man sinned nor his.parents.”--John 9.
“ Such were the facts ;” “ the same was the fact.” “ Here-

in consists the excellency of the English govern-ment.”—-—
Blacks. Com. 6. 1. 4

IV. When an emphatioal‘ attribute introduces a sentence,
the nominative may follow the verb; as, “Great is the Lord,
glorious are his works, and happy is the man who has an in-
terest in his favor.”

V. In certain phrases, which are conditional or hypothet-
ical, the sign of the condition may be omitted, and the nom-
inative placed after the auxiliary’; as, “ Did he but know my
anxiety ;” for, if he did but knowa-—-“ Had I known the fact ;”
for, if I had known-‘—--“ ‘Would they consent ;” for, if they
would, &c.

 When the Words’ whose, his, their, her, mine, your,
&.c,”’fprecede the verb with a governing word, the nomina-
tiveemay follow the verb; as, “ Out of whose modiﬁcations
have been made most complex modes.”-i--Loclce, 2. 22. 10."

VII. In interrogative sentences, the nominative follows
the verb when slime, or the ﬁrst auxiliary; as, Believest
then’! Will he consent’! Has he been promoted’! The
mminative also follows the verb in the imperative mode;
W, go thou, “‘ be ye warmed and ﬁlled.” But after a single
verb, the nominative is commonly omitted; as, arise, ﬂee.

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 91

N ore 3.—-In poetr , the nominative is often omitted in interrogative
sentences, in cases wliere in prose the omission would.,be improper; as,
“‘ Lives there who loves his pain ?”--Milton. That is, lives there a man
or person.

N on: 4.——In the answer to a question, the whole sentence is usually
omitted, exce t the name which is the principal subject of the interro-
gation ; as, “ ho made the chief discoveries concerning vapor P” Black.
“ Whose theory of respiration is generally received?” Crawford’s.

N orr. 5.—-In poetry, the verb in certain phrases is omitted, chieﬂy
such verbs as express an address or answer ; as, “ To whom the mon-
arch”—-that is, said or replied. e

NOTE 6.-—When a verb is placed between two nominatives in differ-
ent numbers, it may agree with either; but generally is made to agree
with the ﬁrst, and this may be considered as preferable; as, “ His meat
was locusts and wild honey.” “It [piracy] is the remains of the man-
ners of ancient Greece.”—./inach. ch. 36.

N on: 7.-—Verbs follow the connective than, without a nominative
expressed ; as, “ Not that any thing occurs in consequence of our late
loss, more aﬁiictive-than was to be expected.”-—Li;fc of Cowper, Lot. 62.

“ He felt himself addicted to hiloso hical s eculations with more ar-
P P P 3 .

dor than consisted with the duties of a Roman and a senator.”-—.M5wh
phey’s Tacitus, 4. 57.

“ All words that lead the mind to any other ideas, than are supposed
really to exist in that thing.”--Locke,

These forms of expression seem to be elliptical ; “ more aﬂiictive than
that which was to be expected.” That which or those which generally
supply the ellipsis. H

N OTE 8.-——We sometimes see a nominative introducin a sentence, the
sense suddenl interrupted, and the nominative leﬁ. wit out its intended
verb; as, “ T e name of a procession; what a great mixture of inde-

pendent ideasof persons, habits, tapers, orders, motions, sounds,does it _

contain!” &c.—-—Loclw, 3. 5. 13. This form of expression is often very
striking in animated discourse. The ﬁrst words being the subjectof the
discourse, and important, are made to usher in the sentence, to°"invite§2§a
tention; and the mind of the speaker, in the fervor of animation,'.qni
ting the trammels of a formal arrangement, rushes forward to.a descrip-
tion of the thin mentioned, and presents the more striking ideas in
the form of exc amation.

N on: 9.——We have one phrase in which the personal pronoun me
recedes a verb in the third person--Jmethinks, methought. Anciently,
him was used in like manner--him thuhte, him thought.--ﬂif. Orosius.
And names also; as, “ tham halgan Gast was ethuht.” It thought (or
seemed good) to the Holy Ghost. Lamb.  Laws. 21. Him, me
and tham are here in the Saxon dative case. his thinks, itseems. to

me, rnihi videtur. ’
RULE II.

A name, a nominative case or a sentence joined with it
participle of the present tense, may stand in construction

 

92 AN rmpnovnzo GRAMMAR

without a verb, forming the case absolute, or clause ind}:-.
pendent; as, “Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multi-
tude being in that place.”—~—John 5. 13. Here multitude, the
name, joined with being, stands without a verb.

“By memory we conceive heat or light, yellow or sweet,
the object being removed.”-——-Locke, 2. 10.

“ I have, notwithstanding this discouragement, attempted
a dictionary of the English language.”——-Johnson’s Preface.

“Whatever substance begins to exist, it must, during its
existence, necessarily be the same.”-—Loche, 2. 27. 28*

“ The penalty shall be ﬁne and imprisonment, any law on
custom to the contrary notwithstanding.”

The latter phraseology is peculiar to the technical law‘
style. In no other , case does notwithstanding follow the‘
sentence. But this positionmakes no diﬁerence in the true-
construction, which is, “any law or custom: to the contrary“
not opposing”——-the real clause independent-

It is very common, when this participle agrees with a.
number of words, or a whole clause, to omit the Whole ex-H
cept the participle; and in this ‘use of notwithstanding, We-
have a striking proof of the value of abbreviations in lan-
guage. For example; “Moses said, Let no man leave of it
till the morning. Notwithstanding, they hearkened not to
Moses.”-—-Ere. 16. 20. Here notwithstanding stands .With-
out the clause to which it belongs ;. to complete the sense in
words, it would be necessary to repeat the whole preceding
clause, or the substance of it——-A-“ Moses said, Let no man leave
of it until the morning. Notwithstanding this command of
Moses, or notwithstanding Moses said that which has been
recited, they hearkened not to Moses.”

“‘ Folly meets with success in this world; but it is true,
notwithstanding, that it labors under disad“va-ntages.”——-—Por-
teus, Lecture 13. This passage at length would read thus--—-A

* During is the participle of an old verb now obsolete; but its deriv-
atives endure and enduring are in use. During is usually called _a. pro-
position ; but notcmsideration can justify the practice’--—it retains its true
verbal sense. Equally erroneous is the classiﬁcation of notwzthstand--
ing with conjnnctions. The two words not and withstanding are
'oined indeedwithout reason; but the resolution of sentences in which
hhis compound i: found‘, demands a restoration. of it to its true place and
eharacter. l

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 93

“ Folly meets with success in the world; but it is true, not-
withstanding folly meets with success in the world, that it
labors under disadvantages.” By supplying What is really
omitted, yet perfectly well understood, we learn the true
construction; so that notwithstanding is a participle always
agreeing with a word or clause, expressed or understood,
and forming the independent clause, and by a customary
ellipsis, it stands alone in the place of that clause.

Such is its general use in the translation of the Scriptures.
In the following passage, the sentence is expressed-——“Not-
withstanding Ihave spoken unto you.”——Jer. 35. That is,
“This fact, I have spoken unto you, not opposing or pre-
venting.” Or, in other words, “ In opposition to this fact.”

It is also very common to use a substitute, this, that, which
or what, for the whole sentence; as, “Bodies which have
no taste, and no power of affecting the skin, may, notwith-
standing this, [notwithstanding they have no taste, and no
power to affect the skin,] act upon organs which are more
delicate.”—-—Fourcro_2/. Translation.

I have included in hooks, the Words for which this is a
substitute.

“To account for the misery that men bring on them-
selves, notwithstanding that, they do all in earnest pursue
happiness, we must consider how things come to be repre-
sented to our desires under deceitful appearances.”———Loclce,

2. 21. 61.
Here that, a substitute, is used, and the sentence also for

which it is a substitute. This is correct English; but it is

usual to omit the substitute, when the sentence is expressed
-—“Notwithstanding they do all in earnest pursue happi-
ness.”

It is not uncommon to omit the participle of the present
tense, when a participle of the perfect tense is employed—--
“The Son of God, while clothed in ﬂesh, was subject to all
the frailties and inconveniences of human nature, sin ect-
cepted.”-—-Loclce, 3. 9. That is, sin being excepted; the
clause independent.

This omission is more frequent when the participle pro-
vided is used, than in any other case. “ In the one case,
provided the facts on which it is founded be suﬂiciently nu-
merous, the conclusion is said to be morally .certa1n.”--
Campbell on Rhet. 1. 114. Here being is omitted, and the

94 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

whole clause in italics is independent-——“ The facts on which
it is founded are suﬁciently numerous, that being provided,
the conclusion is morally certain.” Provided, in such cases,
is equivalent to given, admitted, or supposed.

“ In mathematical reasoning, provided you are ascertain-
ed of the regular procedure of the mind, to affirm that the
conclusion is false, implies a contradiction.”-—1bm.- 134.

In this phrase, that may follow provided——provided that,
you are ascertained, &,c. as in the case of notwithstanding,
before mentioned-—that being a deﬁnitive substitute, point-

ing to the following sentence-—that which follows being pro-
vided.’‘‘‘

It is not uncommon for authors to carry the practice of
abridging discourse so far as to obscure the common regu-
lar construction. An instance frequently occurs in the
omission both of the nominative and the participle in the
case independent. For example: “ Conscious of his own

weight and importance, his conduct in parliament would be

directed by nothing but the constitutional duty of a ‘peer.’’—---
Junius, Let. 19. Here is no noun expressed to which con-
scious can be referred. We are therefore to supply the
necessary words, to complete the construction-—-“ He being
conscious”---forming the clause independent.

RULE III.

A sentence, a number of words, or a clause of a sentence,
may be the nominative to a verb, in which case the verb, is
alwaysin the third person of the singular number ; as, “ All
that is in a man’s power in this case, is, only to observe what

  the ideas are which take their turns. in the understanding.”

Locke, 2. 14. Here the whole clause in italics is the nom-
inative to is.

“ To attach; vices in the abstract, without touching per-
sons, may be safesﬁghting indeed, but it is ﬁghting with shad-
ows.”-—Pope, Let. 48.

“ I deny that men’s coming to the use of reason, is the
time of their discovery.”--Locke, 1. 2.

* Provided that, says Johnson, is an adverbial expression, and we
sometimes see" ovided numbered among thefconjunctions, as its corres-
pondent word 18 in French. What strange work has been made with

grammar !

on THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 95

“ That any thing can exist without existing in space, is
to my mind incomprehensible."—-—Darwin, Zoon. sect. 14.
Here the deﬁnitive substitute may be transferred to a place
next before the verb—-——“ Any thing can exist, without exist-
ing in space,” that [whole proposition] is incomprehensible.

No species of sentences falls under this rule more fre-
quently than those which begin with the inﬁnitive mode.
“ To-show how ”the understanding proceeds herein, is the de-
sign of the following discourse.”-—Loche, 1. 4.

This sentence may be inverted without the change of a
single word. “The design of the following discourse is to
show,” Sec.

“ To fear no eye and to suspect no tongue, is the great
prerogative of innocence.”—-—RambIer. This sentence may
be inverted; but according to our idiom, the substitute it
would precede the verb--“it is the great prerogative of in-
nocence to fear,” &c. The sentence thus inverted would
be good English without the substitute—-“ The great pre-
rogative of innocence is”—-but this alters the sense, and
limits the prerogatives of innocence to the one mentioned.
By changing the to a, this inconvenience would be remedied;
but in either case the force of the sentiment would be im-
paired.

“ Our ideas of eternity can be nothing but an inﬁnite suc-
cession of moments of duration. ”——L0cke, 2. 17. 16. “ The
notion they have of duration, forces them to conceive,”F&c.—--
Ibm. In these passages, we observe the nominative or subject
of the affirmation consists of several words; for it is not simply
an idea which is aﬂirmed to be nothing but an inﬁnite suc-
cession" of moments of duration; but our idea of etwnity.
In like manner, attributes and other Words often make an
essential part of the nominative. “A wise son maketh a
glad father ; but a foolish son is the heaviness of his moth-
er.” Abstract the name from its attribute, and the proposi-
tions cannot always be true—-“ A son maketh a glad father
——a son is the heaviness of his mother.”

“ He that gathereth in summer is a wise son.” Here the
predicate belongs to the person described——“ He that gath-
ereth in summer.” Take away the description, that gath-
ereth in summer, and the affirmation ceases to be true or be-
comes inapplicable.

These sentences or clauses thus constituting the subject
of an aﬂirmation, may be termed nominative sentences.

96 AN IMPROVED GRAMMAR

RULE IV.

The inﬁnitive mode may be the nominative to a personal
verb ; as, “ to see is desirable; to die is the inevitable lot of
men.” Sometimes an attribute is joined with the inﬁnitive;
pas, “ to be blind is calamitous.” In this case the attribute
has no name expressed to which it refers. The proposition
is abstract, and applicable to any human. being, but not ap-
plied to any.

RULE V.

In some cases the imperative verb is used Without a deﬁ-
nite nominative; as, “I will not take any thing that is thine
-—save only that which the young men have eaten.”——Gen.
14. 24.  

“ Israel burned none, save Hazor only.”---Josh. 11. 13.

“ I would that all-—-were such as I am, ecccept these bonds.”
Acts 26. 29.

“ Our ideas are movements of the nerves of sense, as of
the optic nerve in recollecting visible ideas, suppose of a tri-
angular piece of ivory.”—--Darwin, Zoon. Lect. 39.

This use of certain verbs in the imperative is very fre-
quent, and there is a peculiar felicity in being thus able to
use a verb in its true sense and with its proper object, with-
out specifying a nominative; for the verb is thus left ap-
plicable to the ﬁrst, second or third person. I may save or
except, or you may except, or we may suppose. If we ex-
amine these sentences, we shall be convinced of the propri-
ety of the idiom; for the ideas require no application to
any person whatever.

RULE VI.

When the same thing is aﬂirmed or predicated of two or
more subjects, in the singular number, the nominatives are
joined by the copulative and, with a verb agreeing with
them in the plural number ; as, “ John and Thomas and Pe-
ter reside at Oxford.” In this sentence, residence at Oxford
is a predicate common to three persons; and instead of
three aﬂirmations——John resides at Oxford, Thomas resides

at Oxford, Peter resides at, Oxford-——-the three names are

joined by and, and one verb in the plural applied to the
whole number.

“‘ Reason and truth constitute intellectual gold, which de-
ﬁes destruction.”--JoImso‘n. “ Why are whiteness and cold-

or THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 97

ness in snow?”-—,-Loelce. “Your lot and mine, in this re-
spect, have been very diﬁ'erent.”—-Cowp. Let. 383*

In like manner, names and attributes, representing all the
subjects or particulars connected by and, must be in the
plural number; as, “Plato and: Aristotle were learned men;
these philosophers founded the Academic and Peripatetic
schools.” ‘_‘ The most. able generals of the last century
were Frederic of Prussia, the Duke of Marlborough and
Prince Eugene.” “We look on the iohiteness and softness,
produced in the Wax, not as qualities in the sun, but efects
produced by its power‘s.”—-—Loeke, 2. 8.

When three or more particulars are enumerated, the con-
nective may be omitted, except before the last; as, “The
particular bulk, number, ﬁgure and motion of the parts of
ﬁre or snow are’ really in them.”,-'--Loelce, 2. 8.‘ The copu-
lative may, however, be inserted where the repetition of it
adds to the ideas .;dignity, force or solemnity.

When terms of number are employed to specify the par-
ticulars, the copulative is suppressed; as, “These three then,
ﬁrst the law of God, secondly the law of political societies,
thirdly the law of fashion or private censure, are those to

which men compare their actions.”--Locke, 2. 28. 13.

NOTE 1.--The rule for the use of a plural verb with two or more
names in the singular number, connectedby and, is laid down b critics
with too much positiveness and universality. On original principles, all
the names, except the ﬁrst, are in the objective case; for it is probable
that and contains in it the verb add. “ John and Thomas and Peter re-
side at York,” on primitive rinciples, must be thus resolved-—“ John,
add Thomas, add Peter resi ’e at York.” But without resorting to. first
principles, which are now lost or obscured, the use of the siiigular verb
may be justiﬁed by considering the verb» to be understood after each
«name ; and that which is expressed, agreeing only with the last; as,
“ Nor were the young fellows so tyvholly lost to a sense of right, as pride
and conceit has since made them affect to be.”-—Rambler, No. 97;‘ That
is, as pride has and as conceit has. “ Their‘ safety and Welfare is most
concerned.”—-Spectator, No. 121. In our best ‘authors the singularverb
is frequent in, such sentences}
