3. It was an ancient saying of the Persians, that the waters
rush from the mountains and hurry "forth into all the’ lands to
ﬁnd the lord of the earth ; and the ﬂame of ﬁre, when it
awakes, gazes no more upon the ground, but mounts heaven-
‘ward to seek the lord of heaven; and here and there the earth
has built the great watch-towers of the mountains, and they lift
their heads far up into the sky, and gaze ever upward and
&I';’)1111Cl, to see if the Judge of the World comes not ! Thus, in
nature herself, without man, there lies a waiting, and hoping, a
.ooking, and yearning, after an unknown somewhat.

4. Yes; when, above there, where the mountain lifts its
head over all ‘others, that it may be alone with the clouds and
storms of heaven, the lonely eagle looks forth into the gray

dawn, to see if the day comes not! When, by the mountain

torrent, the brooding raven listens to hear if the chamois is
returning from his nightly pasture in the valley; and when the
soon uprising sun calls out the spicy odors of the thousand
ﬂowers, the Alpine ﬂowers, with heaven’s‘ deep blue and the
blush of sunset on their leaves, then there awakes in nature,
and the soul of man can see and comprehend it,’ an expectation
and a longing for a future revelation of God’s majesty.

5. It awakens, also, when, in the fullness of life, ﬁeld and
forest rest at noon, and through the stillness is heard only the
song of the grasshopper and the hum of the bee; and when at
evening the singing lark, up from the sweet—swelling vineyards
rises, or, in the later hours of night, Orion puts on his shining
armor, to walk forth in the ﬁelds of heaven. But in the soul
of man alone is this longing. changed to certainty and fulﬁlled.
Fgr lol the light of the sun and the stars shines through the

air, and is nowhere visible and seen; the planets hasten. with.

more than the speed of the storm through inﬁnite space, and
their footsteps are not heard, but where the sunlight strikes the
firm surface of the planets, where the storn1—wind srnites the
wall of the mountain cliﬂ’, there is the one seen and the other
heard. _

6. Thus is the glory of God made visible, and may be sees

where in the soul of men it meets its likeness changeless and
Thus, then, stands man; a mountain on the
boundary between two worlds; its foot in one, its summit far-
rising into the other. From this summit the manifold land-
scape of life is visible, the way of the past and perishable,
which we have left behind us; and, as we evermore ascend,

ﬁrm-standing.

To DEATH.

Methinks it Were no pain to die

On such an eve, when such a sky
O’ercanopies the West; .

To gaze my ﬁll on yon calm deep,

, And, like an infant, fall asleep

On earth, my mother’s breast.

. There’s peace and Welcome in you sea

Of endless blue tranquillity.
These clouds are living things;
I tracetheir veins of liquid gold,
I see them solemnly unfold
Their soft and ﬂeecy wings.

. These be the angels that convey

Us weary children of a day,
Life’s tedious nothings o’er,
Where neither passions come, nor W068,
To vex the genius of repose
On Death’s majestic shore.

. No darkness there divides the sway

With -startling dawn and dazzling day;

ODE TO ELOQUENGE.
, HENRY enter.
1. CE CRO’ PI A is the original name of Athens, being derived from Ce-
crops, who was the earliest founder of that city.

2. HER’ MES, among the Greeks, was the name of Mercury, the mes-
senger of the gods, and himself the god of Eloquence and the patron of

Orators. Hence the appellation “Son of Hermes,” in allusion to De-

mosthenes, the greatest of all the Grecian orators. _

3. NAIADS (Na’ 2/ads), in the Greek Mythology, were certain inferior
deities, represented generally as young and beautiful Virgins who pre-
sided over rivers, brooks, springs and fountains.

whose praise it Was sung. I0! is a mere Word of exclamation, like

Sparks were kindled by the shock—-
Again thy ﬁres began to burn!

Now shining forth thou mad’st compliant
The conscript fathers to thy charms,

Roused the World—bestriding giant,
Sinking fast in Slavery’s arms!

I see thee stand by Freedom’s fane,

Pouring the persuasive strain,
Giving vast conceptions birth :

Hark I I hear thy thunders sound,

Shake the Forum round and round,
Shake the pillars of the earth.

First-born of Liberty divine !
Put on Religion’s bright array,

Speak I and the starless grave shall shine
The portal of eternal day.

Rise I kindling with the orient beam,
Let Calvary’s hill inspire the theme,
Unfold the garments rolled in blood 1
Oh, touch the soul—-touch all her chords
With all the omnipotence of words,
And point the way to Heaven———to Gen 9

1 PLEIADES (PZe’ya (2263) is the constellation of the seven stars, that
rises at the end of Spring.‘ Job says: (chap. Xxxviii, v. 31.) “ Ocmst
thou bind the sweet inﬂuences of Pleviades?” alluding to the agreeable-
ness of the Spring season.

HUMAN PROGRESS.
CHARLES summsn

1. Humanity has ever advanced, urged by the instincts and
necessities implanted by God, thwarted for a time—-a moment
only, in the immensity of a:ge———to deviate from its true line,
or to seem to retreat, but still ever onward. At last we know
the law of this movement; we fasten our eyes upon that star
unobserved in the earlier ages, which lights the way to the fu-
ture, opening into vistas of inﬁnite variety and extension.

2. Amid the disappointments which may attend individual
exertions, amid the agitations which now surround us, let us
recognize this law, let us follow this star, conﬁdent that what
ever is just, -whatever is humane, whatever is good, whatever is
true, according to an immutable ordinance of Providence, in
the golden light of the future, must prevail. With this faith,
let us place our hands, as those of little children, in the great
hand of God. He will ever guide and sustain us———through
pains and perils it may be——in the path of Progress.

3. In the recognition of this law, there are motives to beneﬁ-
cent activity which shall endure to the last syllable of life.
Let the young embrace it; they shall ﬁnd in it an ever-living
spring. Let the old cherish it still; they shall derive from it
fresh encouragement. It shall give to all, both old and young
a new appreciation of their existence, a new sentiment of their
force, a new revelation of their destiny.

4. A life ﬁlled by this thought shall have comforts and con-
solatioris, which else were unknown. In the ﬂush of youthful
ambition, in the self-conﬁdence of success, we may be indifferent
to the calls of Humanity; but history, reason, and religion, all
speak in vain, if any selﬁsh works, not helping the progress of

102 csannnss? NEW snnrns.

mankind, although favored by worldly smiles, can secure that
happiness and content which all covet as the crown of life.

5. Look at the last days of Prince Talleyrand, and learn the
wretchedness of an old age which was enlightened by no mem-
ory of generous toils, by no cheerful hope for his fellow—men..
Then, when the imbecility of existence rendered him no longer
able to grasp power, or to hold the threads of intrigue, he sum
rendered himself to discouragement and despair. By the light.
of a lamp which he trimmed in his solitude, he traced these
lines——~the most melancholy lines ever written by an old man:

_“Eight_2/-three gears of life are now past I filled with what anxi-
eties, what agitations, what enmities, what troublousperplexities.’

And all this with no other result than a great fatigue, phg,/sical
and moral, and a" profound sentiment of discouragement with
regard to the Future, and of disgust for the Past.”

6. Poor old man! Poor indeed! In his loneliness, in his
failing age, with death awaiting at his palace gates, what to him
were the pomps he had enjoyed! What were titles! VVhat
were oﬁices! What was the lavish wealth in which he lived 1
More precious far, at that moment, would have been the conso-

lation that he had labored for his fellow-men, and the joyous

conﬁdence that all his cares had helped the progress of his race.
7. Be it, then, our duty and our encouragement to live, and

to labor, ever mindful of the Future. The goal is distant, and

ever advancing; but the march is none the less certain. As
_well attempt to make the sun stand still in his course, or to

-restrain the sweet inﬂuences of the Pleiadés} as to arrest the

incessant, irresistible movement, which is the appointed destiny
of man.

EXERCISE XXIV.

UNITY AND PROGRESS OF MANKIND.
GEORGE BANCROFT.

1. The authors of the American Revolution avowed for their
{inject the welfare of mankind, and believed that they were in

the service of their own and of all future generations. Their

faith was just; for the world of mankind does not exist in frag-_

ments, nor can a country have an insulated existence. All men
are brothers; and all are bondsmen for one another. All na-
tions, too, are brothers, and each is responsible for that federa-
tive humanity which puts the ban of exclusion on none.
. . 2. New principles of government could not assert themselves
in one hemisphere without affecting the other. The very idea
of the progress of an individual people, in its relation to»univer-
sal history, springs from the acknowledged unity of the race.
To have asserted clearly the unity of mankind, was the distinc-
tive glory of the Christian religion. N o more were the nations
to be severed by the worship of exclusive deities. The world
wasinstructed that all men are of one blood ; that foriall there
is but one divine nature, and but one moral law ; and the reno-
vating faith taught the singleness of the race, of which it em-
bodied the aspirations and guided the advancement. V

3. In due time appeared the mariner from Genoa. To
Columbus, God gave the keys that unlock the ‘barriers of « the
ocean, so that he ﬁlled Christendom with his glory. The voice
of the world had whispered to him that the world is one; and
as he went forth toward the West, plowing a wave which no
European keel had entered, it was his high purpose not merely
to open new paths to islands or to continents, but to bring
together the ends of the earth, and join all nations in commerce
and spiritual life. i

4. VVhile the world of mankind is accomplishing its nearer
connection, it is, also, advancing in the power of its intelligence.
No period of time has a separate being We are cheered by
rays from former centuries, and live in the sunny reﬂection of
all their light.‘ What though thought is invisible, and, even
when effective, seems as transient as the wind that raised the
cloud I It is yet free and indestructible; can as little be bound
in chains as the aspiring ﬂame ; and, when once generated,
takes eternity for its guardian.

5. We are the children and the heirs of the past with Which,

as with the future, we are indissolubly linked together ; and he
that truly has sympathy with every thing belonging to man,
will, with his toils for posterity, blend affection for the times
that are gone by, and seek to live in the vast life of the ages.
it is by thankfully recognizing those ages as a part of the great
existence in which we share, that history wins power to move
the soul. She comes to us with tidings of that which for us
still lives, of that which has become the life of our life.

6. And, because the idea of improvement belongs to that of

‘continuous being, history is, of all pursuits, the most cheering.

lt throws a halo of delight and hope even over the sorrows of
humanity, and ﬁnds promises of joy among the ruins of em-
pires and the graves of nations. It sees the footsteps of Provi-
dential Intelligence everywhere, and hears the gentle tones of
His voice in the hour of tranquillity;

“Nor God alone in the still calm we ﬁnd;
He mounts the storm and Walks upon the Wind.”

7. Institutions may crumble, and governments fall, but it is
only that they may renew a better youth, and mount upward
like the eagle. The petals of the ﬂower wither, that fruitmay
form. The desire of perfection, springing always from moral
power, rules even the sword, and escapes unharmed from the
ﬁeld of carnage; giving to battles all that they can have of
luster, and to warriors their only glory; surviving martyr-
doms, and safe amid the wreck of states.

EXERCISE XXV.

THE MEN AND DEEDS OF THE REVOLUTION.
EDWARD nvnanrr.
\_ 1. Often as it has been repeated, it will bear another repetition ;
it never ought to be omitted in the history of constitutional
liberty; it ought especially to be repeated this day ;——-—the vari-
ous addresses. petitions, and appeals, the correspondence, the

resolutions, the legislative and popular debates, from 1764 to
the Declaration of Independence, present a maturity of polit-
ical wisdom, a strength of argument, a ‘gravity of style, a
manly eloquence, and amoral courage, of which unquestion-
ably the modern World affords no other example.

2. This meed of praise, substantially accorded at the time
by Lord Chatham in the British Parliament, may Well be re-

peated by us. For most of the venerated men to Whom it is

paid, it is but a pious tribute to departed Worth. The Leos
and the Henrys, Otis, Quincy, VVarren, and Samuel Adams, the
men who spoke those words of thrilling power, which raised,
and directed the storm of resistance, and rang like. the voice
of fate across the Atlantic, are beyond the reach of our praise.
To most of them it was granted to witness some of the fruits
of their labors--—such fruits as revolutions do not often bear.
Others departed at an untimely hour, or nobly fell in the on-
set; too soon for their country, too soon for every thing but
their own undying fame.

3._ But all are not gone; some still survive among us, to
hail the jubilee of the independence they declared. Go back,
fellow-citizens, to that day, when Jeﬁerson and Adams com-
posed the sub—committee Who reported the Declaration of In-
dependence. Think of the mingled sensations, of that proud,
but anxious day, compared to the joy of this. What reward,

-what crown What treasure could the world and all its king-
7 3 ED

doms afford, compared with the honor and happiness of having
been united in that commission, and living to see its most
Wavering hopes turned into glorious reality!

4. Venerable men ! you have outlived the dark (laws which
followed your more than heroic deed ;. you have outlived your
own strenuous contention,who should stand ﬁrst among the
people whose liberty you had vindicated! You have lived to
bear to each other the respect, which the nation bears to you
both ; and each has been so happy as to exchange the honor-
able name of the leader of a party, for that more honorable
one, the Father of his Country, While this our tribufze of re-

spect, on the jubilee of our independence, is paid to the gray
hairs of the venerable survivor in our neighborhood (Adams),
let it not less heartily be sped to him (Jefferson) whose hand
traced the lines of that sacred charter, which, to the end of
time, has made this day illustrious.

5. And is an empty profession of respect all that we owe to
the man who can show the original draught of the Declaration
of the Independence of the United States of America, in his
own handwvriting? Ought not a title-deed like this to become
the acquisition er the nation? Ought it not to be laid up in
the public archives ? Ought not the price, at which it is bought,
to be a provision for the easeand comfort of the old age of
him who drew it? Ought not he, who, at the age of thirty,
declared.the independence of his country, at the age of eighty,
to be secured by his country in the enjoyment of his own ?

6. Nor would we, on the return of this eventful day, forget
the men who, when the conflict of council was over, stood for-
ward in that of arms. Yet let me not, by faintly endeavoring
to sketch, do deep injustice to the story of their exploits. The
eﬁbrts of a life would scarce sufﬁce to paint out this picture, in

all its astonishing incidents, "in all its mingled colors of sub- ‘
limity and woe, of agony and triumph. But the age of coma

memoration is at hand. The voice of our fathers’ blood begins
to cry to us from beneath the soil which it moistened. Time

is bringing forward, in their proper relief, the men and the-

deeds of that high—souled day.

7. The generation of contemporary worthies is gone; the
crowd of the unsignalized great and good disappears ; and the
leaders in war, as well as council, are seen, in fancy’s eye,
to take their stations on the Mount of Remembrance. They
come from the embattled cliffs‘ of Abraham; they start from
the heaving sods of Bunker’s Hill ; they gather from the blaz-
ing lines of Saratoga and Yorktown, f1*oiif‘ the blood-dyed
waters of the Brandywine, from the dreary snows of Valley
Forge, and all the hard-fought ﬁelds of the war! With all
their wounds and all their honors, they rise and pleadplwith us

for their brethren who survive ; and command us, if indeed we
cherish the memory of those who bled in our cause, to show
our gratitude, not by sounding words, but by stretching out the
strong arm of the country’s prosperity, to help the veteran

THE VOICE OF, PRAISE.
MARY RUSSELL mrronn.
1. There is a voice of magicpower

To charm the old, delight the young,--—
In lordly hall, in rustic bower,

In every clime, in every tongue,

Howe’er its sweet vibration rung,
In Whispers low, in poet’s lays, I

There lives not one who has not hung
Enraptured on the voice of praise.

2. The timid child, at that soft voice,
Lifts, for a moment’s space, the eye;
It bids the ﬂuttering heart rejoice,
And stays the step prepared to ﬂy ;
’Tis pleasure breathes that short, quick sigh,

And ﬂushes o’er that rosy face ;
VVhilst shame and infant modesty
Shrink back with hesitating grace.

. The hero, when a people’s voice

Proclaims their darling victor near,
Feels he not then his heart rejoice,

Their shouts of love, of praise to hear?

Yes I fame to generous minds is dear;
It pierces to their inmost core ;

He weeps, who never shed a tear;
He trembles, who ne’er shook before.

. The poet, too-——ah I well I deem

Small is the need the tale to tell-—
Who knows not that his thought, his dream,
On thee at noon, at midnight dwell ?
Who knows not that thy magic spell
Can charm his every care away?
In memory cheer his gloomy cell ;
In hope can lend a deathless ray? ‘T
’Tis sweet to watch afFection’s eye,
To mark the tear with love replete;
To feel the softly-breathing sigh
When ﬁ'ieI1dship’s lips the tones repeat;
But, oh! a thousand times more sweet,
The praise of those we love to hear!
Like balmy showers in summer heat,
It falls upon the greedy ear.

. That voice can quiet passion’s mood,

Can humble merit raise on high ;
And from the wise and from the good

It breathes of immortality !

There is a lip, there is an eye,
"Where most I love to see it shine,

To hear it speak, to feel it sigh,—-

EXERCISE XXIX.

THE NOBLENESS OF A TRUE LIFE.
‘HORACE MANN.

‘1. Whoever yields to temptation dehases himself with a de-
basement from which he can never arise. This, indeed, is the
calamity of calamities, the bitterest dreg in the cup of bitter-
ness. Every unrighteous act tells with a thousandfold more force
upon the actor than upon the sufferer. The false man is more
false to himself than to any one else. He may despoil others,
but himself is the chief loser. The _World’s scorn he might
sometimes forget, but the knowledge of his own perﬁdy is un-

dying. The ﬁre of guilty passions may torment whatever lies '

within the circle of its radiations; but ﬁre is always hottest at
the center, and that center is the proﬂigate’s own heart.
2. A man can be wronged and live ; but the unresisted, un-

checked impulse to do wrong is the ﬁrst and second death.
The moment any one of the glorious faculties with which God
has endowed us, is abused or misused, that faculty loses, forever,
a portion of its delicacy and its energy. Every injury, which
we inﬂict upon our moral nature in this life, must dull forever
and ever our keen capacities for enjoyment, though in the midst
of inﬁnite bliss, and weaken our power of ascension, where vir-
tuous spirits are ever ascending.

3. It must send us forward into the next stage of existence
maimed and crippled, so that, however high we may soar, our
ﬂight will always be less lofty than it would otherwise have
been; and, however exquisite our bliss, it will always be less
exquisitely blissful than it was capable of being. Every instance
of violated conscience, like every broken string in a harp, will
limit the compass of its music, and mar its harmonies forever.
Tremble, then, and forbear, oh man I when thou wouldst forget
the dignity of thy nature and the immortal glories of thy des
tiny ; for, if -thou dost cast down thine eyes to look with compla-
cency upon the tempter, or lend thine ear to listen to his se-
ductions, thou dost doom thyself to move forever and ever
through inferior spheres of being; thou dost wound and dim
the very organ with which alone thou canst behold the splen-
dors of eternity. T -

4. The world is entering. upon a new moral cycle. The

great heart of humanity is heaving with hopes of a brighter
day. All the higher instincts of our nature prophesy its ap-
proach ; and the best intellects of the race are struggling to turn
that prophecy to fulﬁllment. Thoughts of freedom, duty, be-
nevolence, equality, and human brotherhood agitate the nations.
VVere these thoughts imprisoned in the center of the earth,
they would burst its granite folds, speed onward in their career,
and fulﬁll their destiny. They are imbued with a deathless
vigor. They must prevail, or the idea of a Moral Governor of

the universe is an imposture, and the divine truths of the Gos-'

pel a fable.
5. Here, then, is opened a new and noble career for the am-

bition of emulous youth; not the ambition for subduing men
into slaves, but the holy ambition of elevating them into peers ;
not for usurping principality or kingdom, but for building him-
self up into principality and kingdom ; not merely for gathering
renown, as it were, star by star, to be woven into a glittering
robe for his person, or to make a crown of glory for his head;
but to expand his .own soul into grander proportions, to give it
angelic and archangelic loftiness of stature and to fill it perpetu-
ally with that song of joy, which even the morning stars could
not but sing, when they beheld the splendor of the "Godhead
reflected from thenew creation.

6. Here are opportunities, means, incitements, through which
the young man may build himself up more and more into a
likeness of the universe in which he dwells, and conﬁgure himself
more and more to the Inﬁnite Perfection that governs it. In a
physical and in a spiritual sense, the universe around is full;
and, as we can not go beyond the circumference of present
physical discoveries without discovering new theaters of being,
so we can not go beyond the circumference of existing spiritual

‘iirelations without ﬁnding new spiritual relation.

7. Columbus was devoted to the study of geography. As
the result of that study, he felt that there was a continent to be
discovered; and he discovered it. The mind of Newton pon-
dered on astronomical truths. His contemplations engendered
the belief that some cohesive. principle bound together the
Worlds on high: and he demonstrated the law of gravitation.
‘Washington was a patriot. He yearned for liberty ; and by his
valor and his wisdom our republic was established.

8. So new moral blessings and beauties are certain to reward
the efforts of new moral power, whatever direction that power
may take. Grrander discoveries than any which have yet been
made, revelations that lay beyond the ken of Bacon’s far-seeing
vision, andbeauties that shone outside the imagination of the
vast-minded Shakspeare, await the invoking power of philan-
thropic genius. . A

as yet, have hardly begun to explore. We have, as it were,
only skirted along its coasts for a few leagues, Without penetra.t-
Tug the recesses, or gathering the riches of its vast interior.
Hostile nations and repugnant races of men are wayward and
devious orbs, yet to be brought into a system of brotherhood
by the attractions of love. Justice, honor, love, and truth, are
the corner-stones of the holy government which is yet to be or-
ganized upon earth; For all true-hearted adventurers into these
new realms of enterprise, there are moral Edens to be planted,
such as Milton with his celestial verse could never describe, and
there are hights of moral sublimity to ‘be attained, such as
Rosse with his telescope could never descry.

10. Glowing with a vivid conception of these truths, so won-
derful and so indisputable, let me ask, whether, among all the
spectacles whichearth presents, and which angels might look
down upon with an ecstasy too deep for utterance, is there one
fairer’ and more enrapturing to the sight than that of a young
man, just fresh from the Creatorls hands, and with the unspent
energies of the coming eternity wrapped up in his bosom, sur-
veying and recounting, in the solitude of his closet or in the
darkness of midnight, the mightyegifts with which he has been
endowed, and the magniﬁcent career of usefulness and of bless-
edness, which has been opened before him; and resolving, with
one all—concentrating and all-hallowing vow, that he will live,
true to thenoblest capacities of his being, and in obedience to the
highest law of his nature I '

that is ever putting on fair appearances and false pretenses--=
of “ the buyer that says, it is naught, it is naught, but when
he is gone his way, then boasteth”———of the seller who is always
exhibiting the best samples, not fair but false samples, of what
he has to sell ; of the seller, I say, who, to use the language of
another, “if he is tying up a bundle of quills, will place several
in .the center of not half the value of the rest, and thus sends
forth a hundred. liars, with a fair outsi_de, to proclaim as many
falsehoods to the world ?” '

V 2. These practices, alas ! have fallen into the regular course
of the business of many. All men expect them; and, therefore,
you may say, that nobody is deceived. But‘ deception is in-
tended: else why are these things done? “That if nobody is
deceived ? The seller himself is corrupted. He may stand ac-
quitted of dishonesty in the moral code of worldly traﬂic; no
man may charge him with dishonesty ; and yet to himself he
is a dishonest man. Did I say that nobody is deceived ? Nay, but

[somebody is deceived. This man, the seller, is grossly, woefully de-

ceived. He thinks to make a little proﬁt by his contrivances : and
he is selling, by pennyworths, the very integrity of his soul.

3. Yes, the prettiest shop where these things are done, may
be, to the spiritual vision, a place of more than tragic interest.
It is the stage on which the great action of life is performed.
There stands a_man who, in the sharp collisions of daily traﬂic,
might have polished his mind: to the bright and beautiful im-
age of truth, who might have put on the noble brow of candor,
and cherished the very soul of uprightness. I have known
such a man. I have looked into his humble shop. I have
seen the mean and soiled articles with which he is dealing.
And yet the process of things going on there was as beautiful
as if it had been done in Heaven I

4. But now, what is this man—the man who always turns
up to you the better side of every thing he sells—-the man of
unceasing contrivances and expedients, his life long, to make
things appear better than they are? Be he the greatest mer-
chant or the poorest huckster, he is a mean, a knavish-—and

were I not awed by the thoughts of his immortality, I should
say-——a oontemptible creature, whom nobody that knows him
can love, whom nobody can trust, whom nobody can reverence.

5. Not one thing in the dusty repository of things, great or
small, which he deals with, is so vile as he. ‘What is this thing,
then, which is done, or may be done, in the house of traffic?
I tell you, though you may have thought not so of it-—-—I tell
you that there, eventhere, a soul may be lost !——-that that very
structure, ‘built for the gain of earth, may be the gate of hell I
Say not that this fearful appellation should be applied to Worse
places than that. A man may as certainly corrupt all the in-
tegrity and virtue of his soul in a warehouse or a shop,‘ as in
a gambling-house.

THE POOR MAN.

. They call him poor; yet hath yie not an eye

To trace the glory of created things?
Which lingers long upon the sunset sky,

And ’mid the loveliness each season brings?
'Which oft allures the willing spirit, even.
To follow beauty to the shores of heaven 

. They call him poor; yet hath he not an ear

For mellow lute, or maiden—tuned guitar?
To list the Warbles of the vernal year,

And roaring water-fall echoed from afar?
To catch from human lips the winged desire,
And drink in words which social joys inspire?

. They call him poor; yet hath he not a mind

To relish hooks of philosophic lore 3
To grasp the truths a Newton groped to ﬁnd,
And tread where reason only can adore 3
In Nature’s book to read, in every line
The ruling purpose, and the cause divine?

. They call him poor; yet hath he not a heart

Susceptive of volition and its meed?

Which knows love’s gifts to take and to impart,
And crave the sweetness of a generous deed?
Which draws“the honey from the ﬂowers of earth,
And is the touchstone of immortal worth ? H

In the peal of thethunder, the chirp of the bird;
It comes in the torrent, all rapid andvstrong, "
In the streamlet’s soft gush as it ripples along;
Itnbreathes in the zephyr, just kissing the bloom ;
It lives in the rush of the sweeping simoom;

Let the hurricane whistle, or warblers rejoice‘,
What do they all tell thee but God hath a voice?

THE STREAM OF LIFE.
BISHOPHEBER.

1. Life bears us on like the stream of a mighty river. Our
boat, at ﬁrst, glides down the narrow channel, through the
playful murmuring of the little brook and the winding of its
grassy border. The trees shed their blossoms over our young
heads, the ﬂowers on the brink seem to offer themselves to our
young hands; we are happy in hope, and we grasp eagerly at
the beauties around us—but the stream hurries on, and still our
hands are empty.

2. Our course in youth and manhood is along a wider and
deeper ﬂood, amid objects more striking and magniﬁcent. VVe
are animated by the moving picture of enjoyment and industry
passing before us; we are excited by some short-lived disap-
pointment. The stream bears us on, and our joys and our

griefs‘ are alike left behind us. We may be shipwrecked, but’

we can not be delayed; whether rough or smooth, the river
hastens toward its home, till the roar of the ocean is in our
ears, and the tossing of its ‘waves is beneath our feet, and the
land lessens from. our eyes, and the ﬂoods are lifted up around
us, and we take our leave of earth and its inhabitants, until of
our further voyage there is no witness, save the Inﬁnite and
Eternal. l

How lovely and joyful the course that he -run,
Though he rose in a mistwhen his race he begun,

And there followed some droppings of rain l
But now the fair traveler ’s c.ome to the West, A
His rays are all gold, and his beauties are best;
He paints the sky gay as he sinks to his rest,

And foretells a bright rising again.

Like the sun in a mist, when he mourns for his sins,
And melts into tears; then he breaks out and shines,

And travels his heavenly Way: ‘
But, when he comes nearer to ﬁnish his race,
Like a ﬁne setting sun, he looks richer in grace.
And gives a sure hope at the end of his days
Of rising in brighter array.

PROGRESS‘ or LIBERTY.
‘ CHARLES JAMES FOX.

Liberty is order. Liberty is strength. Look round the
world, and admire, as you must, the instructive spectacle. You
will see that liberty not only is power and order, but that it is
power and order predominant and invincible,—-—that it derides
all other sources of strength. ' And shall the preposterous
imagination be fostered, that men bred in liberty,—the ﬁrst of
human kind who asserted the glorious distinction of forming
for themselves their social compact,———can be condemned to
silence upon their rights? Is it to be conceived that men who
have enjoyed, for _such a length of days, the light and happiness
of freedom, can be restrained, and shut up a.gain in the gloom
of ignorance and degradation? As well might you try, by a
miserable dam, to shut ‘up the ﬂowing of a rapid" river! The
rolling and impetuous tide would burst through every impedi-
ment that man might throw in itsway; and the only conse-
quence of the impotent attempt would be, that, having collected
new force by, its temporary suspension, enforcing itself through
new channels, it would spread devastation and ruin on. every
side. The progress of liberty is like the progress of the stream.
Kept within its bounds, it is sure to fertilize the country
through which it runs; but no power can arrest it in its pas-
sage; and short—sighted, as well as wicked, must be the heart
of the projector that would strive to divert its course.

Tranquil its spirit seemed, and ﬂoated slow;
E’en in its very motion there was rest;

While every breath of eve that chanced to blow , ’
Wafted the traveler to the beauteous west.

Emblem, methought, of the departed soul,
To whose white robe the gleam of bliss is given,

And by the breath of mercy made to roll

POETRY. '
  GEORGE r. MORRIS.
1. To me the world ’s an open book,

4 Of sweet and pleasant poetry;
I read it in the running brook
That sings its way toward the sea.
It whispers in the leaves of trees,
The swelling grain, the waving’ grass,
And in the cool, fresh evening breeze
That crisps the wavelets as they pass.

2. The ﬂowers below, the stars above,
In all their bloom and brightness given,
Are, like the attributes of love,
The poetry of earth and heaven.
Thus N ature’s volume, read aright-,
Attunes the soul to minstrelsy,
Tinging life’s clouds with rosy light,
And all the world with poesy.

her brow; grace and dignity are in her steps; peace and joy,-

virtue andlove, are her companions. She frequents the simple

cottage, the shady dell, or the calm retreat, and, in that glorious V

temple erected by nature and religion, she delights to worship
the Dvinity. It is here she presides. an infallible priestesxt,
and hither the pure in heart come to dwell upon her perfecw
tions, and obtain oracles that can never deceive. Happy, in:
deed, is he to whom she reveals herself in all her charms 1 Who
can behold her without loving her? Who can love without
being happy? ‘ F

2. Falsehood may be compared to a base and gilded coin.
Truth, onthe other hand, is like rubies, and more precious than
ﬁne gold. Falsehood is the faint light which, glimmering amid
the darkness of the noisome fens, leads the unfortunate traveler
to destruction. Truth is the radiant sun in Leo, when he has
gained the zenith, and pours a ﬂood of light upon the wander-
er’s path. Falsehood brings misfortune and misery in her
train, like the spreading pestilence or the wind of the desert;
but truth, like the odoriferous gales of summer, imparts health
and vigor, while she administers pleasure and delight. *

All are but parts of one stupendous whole,
Whose body Nature is, and God the soul;

a That, changed through all, and yet in all the same,
Great in the earth, as in th’ ethereal frame,
Warms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,
Glows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees;
Lives through all life, extends through all extent,
Spreads undivided, operates unspent;

Breathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,
As full, as perfect, in a hair as heart;

As full as perfect, in vile Man that mourns,
As the rapt Seraph that adores and burns;
To Him, no high, no low, no great, no small;
He ﬁlls, He bounds, connects, and equals all.

EXERCISE XXXIV.

1. HAROUN AL RASCHID, that is, Haroun, the Just, the most powerful-

prince of his race, became Calif of the Saracens, A.D. 786. He died in
the 23d year of his reign, and in the 47th of his age, renowned for his
victories, his valor, his magniﬁcence and his encouragement of learning.
He was, however, cruel and tyrannical, and ill deserved the title of the
Just. .

niﬁes the true God. '

1. Every body, young and old, children and gray—beards, has
heard of the renowned Haroun Al Raschidi the hero of Eastern
historyand Eastern romance, and the most illustrious of the

califs of Bagdad, that famous city on which the light of learn-.

ing and science shone, long ere it dawned on thebenighted re-
gious of. Europe, which has since succeeded to the diadem that
once glittered on the brow of Asia. Though, as the successor
of the Prophet, he exercised a despotic sway over the lives and
fortunes of his subjects, yet he did not, like the ‘Eastern despots
of more modern times, shut himself up within the walls of his

‘ palace, hearing nothing but the adulation of his dependents;

seeing nothing but the shadows which surrounded him; and
knowing nothing but what he received through the medium of
interested deception or malignant falsehood. »

own ears, he was accustomed to go about through the streets
of Bagdad by night, in disguise, accompanied by Griafer, the
Barmecide, his grand vizier, and Mesrour, his executioner; one
to give him his counsel, the other to fulﬁll his commands
promptly, on all occasions. If he saw any commotion among
the people, he mixed with them and learned its cause; and, if,
in passing a house, he heard the moanings of distress or the
complaints of suffering, he entered for the purpose of adminis-
tering relief. Thus he made himself acquainted withthe con-
dition of his subjects, and often heard those salutary truths
which never reached his ears through the walls of his palace,
or from the lips of the slaves that surrounded him.

3. Onone of these occasions, as Al Raschid was thus peram-
bulating the streets at night, in disguise, accompanied by his
vizier and his executioner, in passing a splendid mansion, he
overheard through the lattice of a window, the complaints of
some one who seemed in the deepest distress, and silently ap-
proaching, looked into an apartment exhibiting all the signs of
Wealth and luxury. On a sofa of satin embroidered with gold,
and sparkling with brilliant gems, he beheld a man richly
dressed, in whom he recognized his favorite boon companion,
Bedreddin, on whom he had showered wealth and honors with
more than-Eastern prodigality. He was stretched out on the
sofa, slapping his forehead, tearing his beard, and moaning pit-
eously, as if in the extremity of suffering. At length, starting
up on his feet, he exclaimed in tones of despair : “Oh, Allah?!
I beseech thee to relieve me from my misery, and take away
my life.” ,

4. The Commander of the Faithful, who loved Bedreddin,
pitied his sorrows, and being desirous to know their cause that
he might relieve them, knocked at the door, which was opened
by a black slave, who, on being informed that they were strang-
ers in want of food and rest,'at once admitted them, and in-

formed his master, who called them into his presence, and bade-

them welcome. _iA plentiful feastgwas spread before them, at

which the master of the house, sat down with his guests, but of

which he did not partake, but looked on, sighing bitterly all
the while.

5. The Commander of the Faithful at length ventured to ask
him what caused his distress, and Why he refrained from‘ par-
taking in the feast with his guests, in proof that they were wel-
come. “ Has Allah afﬂicted thee with disease, that thou canst
not enjoy the blessings he has bestowed? Thou art surrounded
by all the splendor that wealth c-an procure : thy dwelling is a
palace, and its apartments are adorned with all the luxuries
which captivate the eye, or administer to the gratiﬁcation of

the senses. Why is it ‘then, oh! my brother, that thou art

miserable ?”

6. “True, 0 stranger !” replied Bedreddin. “I have all these.
I have health of body; I am rich enough to purchase all that
wealth can bestow, and, if I required more Wealth and honors, I
am the favorite companion of the Commander of the Faithful,
on Whose head lies the blessing of Allah, and of Whom I have
only to «-ask, to obtain all I desire, save one thing only.”

7. “And what is that?” asked the Calif. “Alas! I adore
the beautiful Zuleima, whose face is like the full moon, whose

~ eyes are brighter and softer than those of the gazelle, and whose

mouth is like the seal of Solomon. But she loves another, and
all mywealth and honors are as nothing. The Want of one
thing renders the possession of every other of no value. I am
the most wretched of men; my lifeis a burden, and my death
would be a blessing.” . I

8. “ By the beard of the Prophet,” cried the Calif, “ I swear thy
case is a hard one. But Allah is great and powerful, and will,
I trust, either deliver thee from thy burden, or give thee strength
to bear it.” Then thanking Bedreddin for his hospitality, the
Commander of the ‘Faithful departed, with his companions.

9." Taking their way toward that part of the city inhabited
by the poorer classes of people, the Calif stumbled over some-

-thing, in the obscurity of night, and was nigh falling to the
, ground; at the same moment a voice cried out: “Allah, pre-

serve me! Am I not wretched enough already, that I must be

10. Mezrour, the executioner, indignant at this insult to the

-Confmander of the Faithful, Was preparing to cut off his head,

when Al Raschid interposed, and inquired of the beggar his
name, and Why he was there sleeping in the streets, at that hour
of the night. I

11. “ Mashallah,” replied he, “ I sleep in the street because
I have ‘nowhere else to sleep, and, if I lie on a satin sofa, my
pains and inﬁrmities would rob me of rest. Whether on divans
of silk. or in the dirt, all is one to me, for neither by day nor by
night do I know any rest. If . I close my eyes for a moment,
my dreams are of nothing but feasting, and I awake only to
feel more bitterly the pangs of hunger and disease.”

12. “ Hast thou no home to shelter thee, no friends or kin-
dred to relieve thy necessities, or administer to thy inﬁrmities '4?”
“No,” replied the beggar; “ myhouse was consumed by ﬁre;
my kindred are all dead, and my friends have deserted me.
Alas ! stranger, I am in want of every thing-—-health, food,
clothing, home, kindred, and friends. I am the most wretched
of mankind, and death’ alone can relieve me.”

13. “ Of one thing, at least, I can relieve thee,” said the
Calif, giving him his purse. “ Go and provide thyself food and
shelter, and may Allah restore thy health I” The beggar took
the purse, but instead of calling down blessings on the head of
his benefactor exclaimed--—“ Of What use is money ; it can not
cure disease?” and the Calif again vvent on his Way with Griafer,
his vizier, and Mezrour, his executioner.

14. Passing from the abodes of Want and misery, they, at
length, reached a splendid palace, and, seeing lights glimmering
from the windows, the Calif approached, and looking through
the silken curtains, beheld a man Walking backwards and for-
Wards, with languid step, as if oppressed with a load of cares.
At length, ca.sting himself down on a sofa, be stretched out his
limbs, and yawning desperately, exclaimed : “ Oh I Allah, what

Shall I do; what will become of me! I am Weary of life; it I

affording only hopes that end in disappointment, or, if realized,
only in disgust.” ‘ I I

15. The curiosity of the Calif being awakened to know the
cause of his despair, he ordered Mezrour to knock at the door,
which being opened, they pleaded the privilege of strangers to
enter, for rest and refreshments. Again, in accordance with
the precepts of the Koran, and the customs of the East, the
strangers were admitted to the presence of the lord of the place,
who received them with welcome, and directed refreshments to

be brought. But, though he treated his guests with kindness,

he neither sat down with them, nor asked any questions, nor
joined in their discourse, walking back and forth languidly,
and seeming oppressed with a heavy burdenof sorrows.

16. "At length, the Calif approached him reverently and said : ,

“Thou seemest sorrowful, O my brother! If thy suffering is
of the body, I am a physician, and, peradventure, can afford thee
relief; for I have traveled into distant lands, and collected Very
choice remedies for human inﬁrmity.” .

17. “My sufferings are not of the body, but of the mind,” an-
swered the other. “ Hast thou lost the beloved of thy heart,
the friend of thy bosom, or been disappointed in the attainment
of that on which thou hast rested all thy hopes of happiness?”

1 8. “Alas! no. I have been disappointed not in the means, but
in the attainment of happiness. I want nothing but a want. I

am cursed with the gratiﬁcation of all mywishes, and the fruition ‘

of all my hopes. I have wasted my life in the acquisition of riches,
that only awakened new desires, and honors that no longer gratify
my pride, or repay me for the labor of sustaining them. I have
been cheated in the pursuit of pleasures that weary me in the
enjoyment, and am ‘perishing for lack of the excitement of some
new want. I have every thing I wish, yet" enjoy nothing.”

19. “Thy case is beyond my skill,” replied the Calif; and the
man, cursed with the fruition of all his desires, turned his back

on him in despair. The Calif, after thanking him for his hos--

pitality,‘ departed with‘ his companions, and when they had

longer fatigue myself in a vain pursuit; for it is impossible to
confer happiness on such a perverse generation. I see it is all
the same, whether a man wants one thing, every thing, or noth-
ing. Let us go home and sleep.”

1. In the garden of the Tuileries there is a sunny corner
under the wall of a terrace which fronts the south. Along
the Wall is a range of benches commanding a View of the
wvalks and avenues of the garden. This ‘genial nook is a place
of great resort in the latter part of autu.n1n, and in ﬁne days

His dress, though ancient, had an air of decayed gentility,
and I observed that he took his snuff out of an elegant, though
old-fashioned, gold box.

4. He appeared to be the most popular man on the W alk.
He had a compliment for every old lady, he kissed every child,
and he patted every little dog on the head; for children and
little dogs are very important members of society in France.
I must observe, however, that he seldom kissed a child without,
at the same time, pinching the nursery-maid’s cheek ‘; a French-
man of the old school never forgets his devoirs to the sex.

5. I had taken a liking to this old gentleman. There was

4 an habitual expression of benevolence in his face, which I have

very frequently remarked in these relics of the politer days of
France. The constant interchange of those thousand little
courtesies which imperceptibly sweeten life, have a happy ef-
fect upon the features, and spread a mellow evening charm over
the wrinkles of old age. ‘ 7

8. He was secretly denounced by his own steward during
a sanguinary period of the Revolution, and a number of the
blood-hounds of the Convention were sent to arrest him. He
received private intelligence of their a.pproach in time to effect
his escape. He landed in England without money or friends,

but considered himself singularly fortunate in having his head

upon his shoulders : several of his neighbors having been guil-
lotined as a punishment for being rich.

9. When he reached London he had but a Zouis in his
pocket, and no prospect of getting another. He ate a solitary
dinner on beefsteak, and was almost poisoned by Port wine,
which, from its color, he had mistaken. for claret. The dingy
look of the chop-house, and of the little mahogany-colored box
in which he ate his dinner, contrasted sadly with the gay sa-
loons of Paris. Every thing looked gloomy and disheartening.
Poverty stared ‘him in the face ; he turned over the few shill-
ings he had of change ; did not know what was to become of
him; and—went to the theater! _

10. He took his seat in- the pit, listened attentively to a

tragedy of which he did not understand a word, and which’

seemed made up of ﬁghting, and stabbing, and scene-shifting,
a.nd began to feel his spirits sinking within him ; when, casting
his eyes into the orchestra, what was his surprise to recognize
an old friend and neighbor in the very act of extorting music
from a huge Violoncello. ,

11. As soon as the evening’s performance was over, he tapped
his friend on the shoulder; they kissed each other on each

cheek, and the musician took him home, and shared his lodg-

ings with him. He had learned music as an accomplishment;
by his _friend’s advice he now turned to it as a means of sup-
port. He procured a violin, offered himself for the orchestra,
was received, and again considered himself one of the most
fortunate men upon earth.

12. Here, therefore, he lived for many years during the as-
cenden cy of the terrible Napoleon. iHe found several emi-
grants living, like himself, by the exercise of their talents.

They associated together, talked of France and of old times,
and endeavored to keep up a semblance of Parisian life in the
center of Londdn.

13. They dined’ at a miserable cheap French restaurateur
in the neighborhood of Leicester-square, where they were
served with a caricature of French cookery. They took their
promenade in St. J ames’s Park, and endeavored to fancy it the
Tuileries ; in short, they made shift to accommodate themselves
to every thing but an English Sunday. Indeed, the old gen-
tleman seemed to have nothing to say against the English,
whom he afﬁrmed to be braves gens;* and he mingled so much
among them, that at the end of twenty years he could speak
their language almost well enough to be understood.

14. The downfall of Napoleon wasanother epoch in his life.

A He had considered himself a fortunate man to make his escape

penniless out of France, and he considered himself fortunate to
be able to return penniless into it. It is true that he found
his Parisian hotel had passed through several hands during
the vicissitudes of the times, so as to be beyond the reach of
recovery; but then he had been noticed benignantly by gov-
ernment, and had a pension of several hundred francs upon
which, with careful management, he lived independently, and,
as far as I could judge, happily.

15. As his once splendid hotel was now occupied as a hétel
gamij he hired a small chamber in the attic; it was but, as
he said, changing his bedroom up two pair of stairs. He was
still in his own house. His room was decorated with pictures
of several beauties of former times, with whom he professed to
have been on favorable terms; among them was a favorite
opera-dancer, who had been the admiration of Paris at the

~ breaking out of the Revolution.

16. The old gentleman was a devout attendant upon levees;
he was most zealous in his loyalty, and could not speak of ’ the

. royal family without a burst of enthusiasm ; for he still felt to-
ward them as his companions in exile. As to his poverty he

made right of it, and, indeed, had a good-humored Way of con»
soling himself for every cross and privation. If he had lost
his chateau in the country, he had half a dozen royal palaces,
as it were, at his command.

17. He had Versailles and St. Cloud for his country resorts,
anl the shady alleys of the Tuileries and the Luxembourg for
his town recreation. ' Thus all his promenades and relaxations
were magniﬁcent, yet cost nothing. When I. walk through
these ﬁne gardens, said he, I have only to fancy myself the
owner of them, and they are mine.’ All these gay crowds are
my visitors, and I defy the grand seignior himself to display a
greater variety of beauty. Nay, what is better, I have not the
trouble of entertaining them. My estates is a perfect Sans
;S’oucz',* where every one does as he pleases, and no one troubles
the owner. V ' V ,

18. All Paris is my theater, and presents me with a con-
tinual spectacle. I have a table spread for me in every street,
and thousands of waiters ready to ﬂy at my bidding. When
my servants have waited upon me, I pay them, discharge them,
and there ’s an end: I have no fears of their wronging or pil-
fering me When my back is turned. Upon the whole, said
the old gentleman, with a smile of inﬁnite good-humor, when
I think upon the various risks I have run, and the manner in
which I have escaped them; when I recollect all that I have
suffered, and consider all that I at present enjoy, I can not but
look upon myself as a man" of singular good fortune.

19. Such was the brief history of this practical philosopher,
and it is a picture of many a Frenchman ruined by the Rev-
olution. The French appear to have a greater facility than
most men in accommodating themselves to the reverses of
life, and of extracting honey out of the bitter things of this
world. The ﬁrst shock of calamity is apt to overwhelm them,
but when it is once past, their natural buoyancy of feeling
soon brings them to the surface. This may be called the re-

sult of lev..ty of character, but it answers the end of reconcil-
ing_ us to misfortune, and, if it be not true philosophy, it is
something almost as efficacious. Ever since I have heard the
story of my little Frenchman, I have btreasured it up in my
heart; and I‘ thank my stars I have, at length, found, What I had
long considered as not to be found on earth——-A CONTENTED MAN.

20. P. S. There is no calculating on human happiness.
Since writing the foregoing, the law of indemnity has been
passed, and my friend restored to a great part of his fortune.
I was absent from Paris at the time, but on my return hastened

to congratulate him. I found him magniﬁcently lodged on the

ﬁrst ﬂoor of his hotel. I Was’ ushered, by a servant in livery,
through splendid saloons, to a cabinet richly furnished, Where
I found my little Frenchman reclining on a couch. He re-
ceived me with his usual cordiality; but I saw the gayety and
benevolence of his countenance had ﬂed; he had an eye full
of care and anxiety.

21. I congratulated him on his good fortune. “ Good
fortune '2” echoed he; “bah! I have been plundered of a
princely fortune, and they give me a pittance as an indem-
nity.” I

22. Alas! I found my late poor and contented friend one
of the richest and most miserable men in Paris. Instead of
rejoicing in the ample competency restored to him, he is daily
repining at the superﬂuity Withheld. He no longer Wanders
in happy idleness about Paris, but is a repining attendant in
the ante—chambers of ministers. His loyalty has evaporated
with his gayety ; he screws his mouth when the Bo11rbons are
mentioned, and even shrugs. his shoulders when he hears the

praises of the king. In a word, he is one of the many philos-

ophers undone by the law of indemnity, and his case is des-
perate; for I doubt whether even another reverse of fortune,
which should restore him to poverty, could make him again a
happy man.

It deals, therefore, with words, not only as individuals, but as
members of a sentence, and parts of a connected discourse; in-

Of “greedy populace,” and “dirty crowd,”

Nor slander thus the nature which I bear.

Still to be men ; and Where untaught they fall,
It is a noble duty, to awake

The heart of truth, that slumbers in them still.
It is a glorious sight to rouse the soul,

And Wisdom is a laggard at her task

When but in closet speculations toiling

TAMMANY is the name of a sort of mythic Indian personage, assumed
as the patron Saint of the Tammany Society, a political organization formed
in New York city many years ago. The Society was fancifully divided into
thirteen tribes, answering, to the number of States then in the Union: each
tribe having some Well-known animal as the symbol of its character.

In an address of Dr. Mitchell before the Society, delivered May 12th,
1795, Tammany is set forth as a person of extrabrdinary wisdom and
foresight. Being on the eve of his departure on an important public
mission, he is represented as calling together his native tribes, and ad—-

rcssing them each in the manner following: i

SPEECH OF TAMMANY.
DR. SAMUEL L. MITCHELL.
1. CHILDREN OF THE FIRsT TRIBE!

The Eagle should be your model.« He soars above the
clouds, loves the mountain—tops, takes a broad survey of the
country round, and his watchfulness in the day-time lets noth-
ing escape him. From him learn to direct your thoughts to
elevated objects, to rise superior to the fogs of prejudice and
passion, to behold in the clear atmosphere of reason all things
in their true light and posture; and never expose yourselves to
be surprised, while the sun shines, in a ﬁt of drowsiness or
slumber. T

2. CHILDREN OF THE SECOND TRIBE!

The Tiger affords a useful lesson for you. The exceed-
ing agility of this creature, the extraordinary quickness of
his sight, and, above all, his discriminating power in the dark,
teach you to be stirring and active in your respective callings,
to look sharp to every engagement you enter into; and to let
neither misty days, nor gloomy nights, make you" lose sight of
the worthy object of your pursuit. 5

sounds at a great distance, and where danger threatens, and a

. retreat is advisable, can force his passage surprisingly through

the thickets, or even make his escape across the lakes and rivers
by swimming. In like manner, open ye your ears to whatever
is passing; collect the substance of distant rumors; and learn,
before danger surrounds your corn—ﬁelds and wigwams, what is
going on at a distance. Thus shall you be forewarned, -and pre-
pared against calamity from abroad; and, if it thickens and
threatens you with irresistible force, you will know how to avoid
with prudence what you could not oppose with success.

4. CHILDREN on THE FOURTH TRIBE!

There is one quality of the Wolf, to which I request your
attention. . His wide extent of nostrils, catches the atoms ﬂoat-
ing in the air, and gives him notice of the approach of his p1‘6j"
or his foe. Thus, when power grows rank, and, like a cont-5

gion, sends abroad its pestilent steams, I see the wolf—like myr _

midons* of Tammany, the ﬁrst to rouse, turn round their heads
and snuff oppression in every tainted breeze.

5. CHILDREN on THE FIFTH TRIBEl

You, Iny children, are to take useful hints from the .Buﬁ2zZ0.
He is one of the strongest animals of the wilderness; but strong
 he is, he loves the company of his kind, and is not fond of
venturing alone upon distant excursions. This is wise in the
buffalo, and wise will it be in you to imitate him. It will, in-
deed, be your duty to acquire, by hunting, sw,.InIning, running,
and all other manly exercises, great bodily vigor and personal
strength. But it will be ridiculous to value yourselves highly on
these; a fall, a cramp, or a sprain, but too frequently disables
an individual; and then, if he is alone in‘ the woods, he Inay
perish for want of help. Operate in concert, stand together,
support each other, and you will be a mountain that nobody
can move; fritter down your strength in divisions, become the
sport of parties, let wigwam be divided against Wigwam, you
will be an ant—hill_, which a baby can kick over.

That social and valuable creature, the Dog, aﬁfords some~
thing for you to proﬁt by. The warmth of his attachment, the
disinterestedness of his friendship, and the unchangeableness of
his ﬁdelity, mark him as the object of your kindness and imita-
tion. Oh ll 1ny children, I Weep for the faithlessness, the false-
hood, and the deceit of man! Do but love "each other with
half the warmth, sincerity, and steadiness with which these
your constant hunting companions love you all, and happiness,

ye shall experience all the pleasure that human nature can

You are to take a pattern from the ‘Beaver. His industry
merits your observance. His perseverance claims your regard.
His judgment, in the choice of a place for him to live in, de-
mands your consideration. Like him, you are to avail your-
selves of natural advantages, and opportunities in all cases ; and
to superadd to these your manual improvements and works of
art. In the pursuit of your industrious project, no difficulty
should» deter, no obstacle discourage you. Forests must be
cleared, hills leveled, rivers turned, to accomplish your plans;
and land and Water be made to afford their joint aid in pro»-
moting your undertaking: labor and perseverance overcome
every thing ;——for I have heard the old people say, their ances-
tors assisted in making the sun-light, immense as he appears,
by collecting into a heap all the ﬁre-ﬂies and gloW—Worms they
could ﬁnd; and the moon, Whose light is fainter, and size small--
er, was in like manner formed by their gathering into a pile
all the fox-ﬁre, or phosphoric rotten Wood, they could procure.

with nourishment during the stormy season, when, aftei the fall
of the leaf, it would be dangerous to venture far abroad. In
like manner it becomes you to look forward to old age, the win-
ter of life, and have some provision ready to help yourselves
With, at that needy time. You can not labor to equal advan-

tage every day ; it is, therefore, your duty to collect something

ahead, and lay it by in store against the pinching severity of an
unproductive season. This you may enjoy by your ﬁresides,
while all around you the frost rends the trees asunder, and the
white powder lies so thick upon the ground that you can not
venture out without your snow-shoes.

9. CHILDREN on THE NINTH TRIBE ! ‘

You are to learn a lesson of caution from the Fox. He
looks Well before him as he travels, examines carefully the
ground he treads upon, and takes good care that his enemies
come not on him by surprise. By reason of his Wariness he is
not easily fled into a stratagem, and when entangled, by his con-
trivance, he is very successful in making his escape. Thus may
you proceed in your business with circumspection, examine all
tifngs around you with prudence, and never suffer the artiﬁces
of the deceiver to entrap you unawares. Such keen examina-
tion’ will guard you from difficulties, and, if in the course of
nature, you should be, in spite of all this, beset by them, nothing
will more effectually enable you to extricate yourselves.

10. CHILDREN on THE TENTH TRIBE!

The Tortoise, that supports on his back the World* We

himself up securely in his impenetrable coat. His moderation,

for he possesses none of that feverish fretfulness, which shortens ’

life, secures to him great length of days. His temperance, for he
does not Waste his vital energy in frolics and carousing, gives
him an animation so quick and inherent in every joint and
meniber, that it is diﬂicult to kill him. If then you wish to at-
tain to long life, and possess sensibility and comfort While it
lasts, imitate the virtues of the tortoise, for so shall you be pro-
tected With armor less vulnerable than his shell, or your own
shields of bark and hides, and arrive to good old age without
danger of earthquakes or inundations.

I recommend to your attention the wholesome counsel
derived to man from the Eel. He was never known to make a
noise or disturbance in the World, nor speak an ungentle sen-
tence to any living creature. Slander never proceeded from his
mouth, nor does guile rest under his tongue. He forms his plans
in silence, carries them into effect without tumult, and glides
and slips along through life in a most easy and gentle course.
Are you desirous, my children, of modest stillness and quiet?
Do you wish for the unenvied condition of retirement and hu-
mility? Vi-Tould you like to live peaceably among men in the
uninterrupted pursuit of your business, without attracting the
broad stare of the surrounding crowd? If such are your de-
sires, learn a lesson of wisdom from the eel; W ho, although he
knows neither his birth an r parentage, but is cast an orphan

12. CHILDREN on THE TWELFTH TRIBE I

I shall point out for your improvement some excellent
traits of character in the Bear. - He is distinguishedfor his
patient endurance of those inconveniences which he ﬁnds it
impossible to Ward off. _When frost and snow, with all their
A-chilling horrors, surround him in Winter, he learns to live with
a smaller degree of heat than he did before ; and, by aid of his
furry skin, protects himself as Well as he can from the rigor
of the season. VVhen from these causes his supplies of nour-
ishment are cut off, and little or nothing is to be obtained to
satisfy the cravings of hunger, he endures with resolution the
calamities which await him, until the foodful season shall ar—
rive. Thus, when scarcity threatens your country with famine,
when diseases among the beasts strew your hunting-grounds
with carcases, when insects destroy the stalks of your beans,
and Worms corrode the roots of your corn, When the streams
refuse their accustomed supplies of ﬁsh, when hurricanes and
hail lay Waste your plantations, or when the clouds withhold
their stores of rain, what is to be done? Why certainly,
when every effort has been tried in vain, and discouraged and
spiritless you lay you down, lay not yourselves down to dz'e,° but
bear with patience and resignation Whatever necessity imposes
upon you, make the allowance of your meal correspond to your
stock of provision; and, if you have but little, contrive with
all your skill to make that little do. Show yourselves men ;
for it is adversity that gives scope to great talents, by enabling
you to endure with fortitude what your best‘-directed efforts
have failed to surmount.

13. CHILDREN on THE THIRTEENTH TRIBE I

lploiyment. Hours of labor, of refreshment, and of rest are

assigned, and each member is obedient to the summons of duty.

‘Idlers, vagrants, and embezzlers of the public property, have

no toleration there; and it seems to be a pretty Well estab-
liSl16d'i.I1’lt1XlII1, with but few exceptions, among them, that he
who works not, shall have nothing to eat. Regularity and
method‘ pervade every department of a government whose
unwearied inhabitants in their ﬂights to distant places, possess
the singular secret of extracting honey from nauseous and fetid
blossoms, and of collecting, without injury to any one, the
whole sweets of the surrounding country, in their own inimitae
ble commonwealth. '

Borrow from the Bee an idea of arrangement in business;
of the importance of system to make matters go on aright, of’
the advantage accruing from an accurate division and distri-
bution of labor; of the equity causing every one to contribute
his share to the support of the general weal, or be precluded
from participating its beneﬁts and blessings. And, above all,
derive from their instructive example that alchemy of mind,
which, by an operation somewhat analogous to the production
of nectar from venom, converts private failings into public ad-
vantages, and makes even crimes and vices ultimately conduc-
ive to good.

_IRON AND GOLD.
SAMUEL JOHNSON.

1. Those who are skilled in the extraction and preparation
of metals, declare that iron is everywhere to be found; and
that not only its proper ore is copiously treasured in the cav-
erns of the earth, but that its particles are dispersed throughout
all other bodies.

2. If the extent of the human view could comprehend the

whole frame of the universe, I believe it would be found invari-
- ml:

ably true, that Providence has given that in greatest plenty
which the condition of life makes of greatest use; and that
nothing is penuriously imparted, or placed far from the reach of
man, of which at more liberal distribution, or more easy acqui-
sition, would increase real and rational felicity.

3. Iron is common and gold is rare. Iron contributes so
much to supply the wants of nature, that its use constitutes
much of the diﬁerence between savage and polished life, be-
tween the state of him that slumbers in European palaces, and
him that shelters himself in the cavities of a rock from the
chillness of the night, or the violence of the storm. Gold can
never be hardened into saws or axes ; it can neither furnish in-
struments of manufacture, utensils of agriculture,‘ nor weapons
of defense; its only quality is to shine, and the value of its

luster arises from its scarcity.

4. Throughout the whole circle, both of natural and moral
life, necessaries are as iron, and superﬂuities as gold. What we
really need we may readily obtain; so readily, that far the
greater part of mankind has, in the wantonness of abundance,

= confounded natural with artiﬁcial desires, and invented necessi-

ties for the sake of employment, because the mind is impatient
of inaction, and life is sustained with so little labor that the
tediousness of idle time can not otherwise be supported.

5. Thus plenty is the original cause of many of our needs;
and even the poverty, which is so frequent and distressful in
civilized nations, proceeds often from that change of manners
which opulence has produced. Nature makes us poor only
when We want necessa1*ies; but custom gives the name of pov-
erty to the wantoﬁitif superﬂuities.

6. When Socrates passed through shops of toys and orna-
ments,.he cried out: “How many things are here which I do

i not need!” And the same exclamation may every man make

who surveys the common accommodations of life. Superﬂuity
and diﬂiculty begin together. To dress food. for the stomach is
easy’,-——the art is to irritate the palate when the stomach is suf-

» ﬁced. A rude hand may build walls, form roofs, and lay floors‘,

and provide all that warmth and security require; we only call
the nicer artiﬁcers to carve the cornice, or to paint the ‘ceilings.
Such dress as may enable the body to endure the different ‘sea-
sons, the most unenlightened nations have been enabledlto pro-
cure; but the work of science begins in the ambition of dis—-
tinction, in variations of fashion, and emulation of elegance.
Corn grows with easy culture ; the gardener’s experiiﬁnents are
only employed to exalt the ﬂavors of fruits, and brighten the
colors of ﬂowers. T »

7. Even of knowledge, those parts are most easy which are
generally necessary. The intercourse of society is maintained
without the elegances of language. Figures, criticisms,‘ and
reﬁnements, are the Work of those whom idleness makes weary
of themselves. The commerce of the world is carried on by
easy methods of computation. Subtilty and study are re-
quired only when questions are invented merely to puzzle, and
calculations are extended to show the skill of the calculator,
The light of the sun is equally beneﬁcial to him whose eyes tell
him that it moves, and to him whose reason persuades him that
it stands still; and plants grow with the same luxuriance,
whether we suppose earth or water the parent of vegetation.

8. If we raise our thoughts to nobler inquiries, we shall still
ﬁnd facility concurring with usefulness. No man needs stay to
be virtuous till the moralists have determined the essence of
virtue ; our duty is made apparent by its proximate conse-
quences, though the general and ultimate reason should never
be discovered. Religion may regulate the life of him to whom
the Scotists and Thomists are alike unknown; and theassertors
of fate and free-will, however different in their talk, agree ‘to
act in the same manner.

*9. It is not my intention to depreciate the politer arts or ab-
struser studies. That curiosity which always succeeds ease and
plenty, was undoubtedly given us as aproof of capacity which
our present state is not able to ﬁll, as a preparative for some

a better mode of existence, which shall furnish. employment for

the whole soul, and where pleasure shall be adequate to our

count of his crimes, condemned in the lower regions to roll a huge stone up
a high hill, which became a never-ending toil; for no sooner had the stone
reached the top of the hill than it rolled irresistibly back to the bottom.

2. PRO ME’ THE US, which name signiﬁes Fore-ofzénker, was a person
of extraordinary foresight and sagacity. He was the inventor of many
arts, especially those of working in metal and clay. His zeal in behalf
of the human race is said to have incurred the dispieasure of Jove, who
bound him with chains to a rock or pillar, and sent an eagle or vulture
to prey upon his liver every day; which, however, grew as much dur-
ing the night as it was diminished during the day.

3. VULCAN was the deity who presided over ﬁre, and was the patron A

of all those who worked in iron or other metals. He was the husband
of Venus, who, in the following pieee, is called “the Queen of Love,”

From his hut and the grave of his friend far away;

2. He has left the green valley for paths where the bison
Roams through the prairies, or leaps o’er the ﬂood;
Where the snake in the swamp sucks the deadliest poison,
And the eat of the mountains keeps watch for its food.
But the leaf shall begreener, the sky shall be purer,
The eyeshall be clearer, the riﬂe be surer,
And stronger the arm of the fearless endurer,
That trusts naught but Heaven, in his way through the
wood.

3. Light be the heart of the poor lonely wanderer,
Firm be his step through each wearisome mile,
Far from the cruel man, far from the plunderer,
Far from the track of the mean and the vile ;
And, when death, with the last of its terrors, assails him,
And all butthe last thro_b of memory ‘fails him,
He ’ll think of the friend, far away, that bewails him,
And light up the cold touch of death with a smile.

4. And there shall the dew shed its sweetness and luster,
There for his pall shall the oak leaves be_spread ;
The sweet-brier shall bloom, and the wild grape shall cluster,
And o’er him the leaves of the ivy be shed;

Amid the sea~like solitude,

And rushing, thundering, down were ﬂung,
The"Titans of the wood;

Loud shrieked the eagle as he dashed

From out his mossy nest,which crashed
With its supporting bough,

And the first sunlight, leaping, ﬂashed
on the wolf ’s haunt below.

2. Rude was the garb, and strong the frame

Of him who plied his ceaseless toil:

To form that garb, the wildéwood game
Contributed their spoil;

The soul that warmed that frame, disdained

The tinsel, gaud, and glare that reigned
Where men their crowds collect;

The simple fur, untrimmed, unstained,
This forest tamer decked.

3. The paths which wound ’mid gorgeous trees,
The streams whose bright lips kissed their ﬂowers,
The winds that swelled their harmonies
Through those sun-hiding bowers,
The temple vast, the green arcade,
The nestling vale, the grassy glade,
Dark cave and swampy lair;
These scenes and sounds majestic, made
His world, his pleasures there.

1. There is no virtue Without a characteristic beauty to ren-
der it particularly loved of the good, and to make the bad
ashamed of their neglect of it. To do What is right, argues
superior taste, as well as morals; and those whose practice is
evil, have a certain feeling of inferiority in intellectual power
and enjoyment, even Where they take no concern for a prin-
ciple. Doing well has something more in it than the mere
fulﬁlling of a duty. It i_s a cause of a just sense of elevation
of character-; it clears and strengthens the spirits; it gives
higher reaches of thought; it Widens our benevolence, and
makes the current of our peculiar affections strong and
deep. , . _
2. Never yet was a sacriﬁce offered to a principle, that was not
more than made up to us by self—approva.l, and the considera-
tion of what our degradation would have been, had we done

A otherwise. Certainly it is a pleasant and a wise thing,’ then, to

follow what is right, even when we only go along with our
affections, ‘and take the easy Way of the better propensities of
our nature.

3. The world is sensible of these truths, let it act as it may.
It is not because of his integrity alone that it’ relies on an
honest man. It has more conﬁdence in his judgment and
wise conduct, in the long run, than in the schemes of those of
greater intellect, who go at large Without any landmarks of

principle ; so that virtue seems of a double nature, and to stand

oftentimes in the place of what we call talents.

4. This reasoning, or rather feeling, pf the World is right;
for the honest and good man only falls in with the order of
nature, which is grounded in truth, and will endure along with
it. And such a hold upon the World has a man of this
character,——even where he has not been called upon to make a.
sacriﬁce to a principle, or to take a stand against wrong, but
has merely avoided running into vices, and suffered himself to
be borne along by the delightful and kind affections of private
life, and has found his pleasures in the duties of home,-—-that he
is looked up to with respect, as Well as regarded with
kindness.

5. VVe attach certa.in notions of reﬁnement to his thoughts,
and of depth to his sentiment; and the impression he makes
on us, is beautiful and peculiar. Although We may have noth-
ing in particular to object to in other men, and though they
may be very Well in their way, still, While- in his presence, they

strike us as lacking something, we can hardly say what,——a

certain sensitive delicacy of character a11d manner, Wanting
‘which, they affect us as more or less insensible, and even

coarse. -
6. N o creature in the World has this character. so ﬁnely

marked in him as a respectful and affectionate son,———pa.rticularly
in his relation to his mother. Every little attention he pays
her, is not only an expression of ﬁlial attachment, and a grateful
acknowledgment of past cares,“ but is an evidence, also, of a ten-
derness of disp0siti0n,‘Which moves us‘ the more, because not

somuch looked on as an essential property in a man’s charac-
ter,. as it is in the light of an added grace which is bestowed
only upon a few. -

7. His regards do not appear like mere habits of duty, nor
does his watchfulness of his mother’s Wishes seem like taught
submission to her Will. They are the native courtesies of a feel-
ing mind, showing themselves amid stern virtues and masculine
energies, like gleams of light on points of rocks. They are
delightful as evidences of power yielding voluntary homage to
the delicacy of the soul. The armed knee is bent, and the
heart of the mailed man laid bare. ‘

8. Feelings that would seem to be at variance with each
other, meet together a.nd harmonize in the breast of a son.
Every call of the mother, which he answers to, and every act
of submission which he performs, are not only so many
acknowledgments of her authority, but so many instances,
also, of kindness, and marks of protecting regard. The servant
and defender, the child and guardian, are mingled in him.
The World looks on him in this way ; and to draw upon a man
the confidence, the respect, and the love of the World, it is
enough to say of him,-He is a good Son I

retrace the course of our own lives. The past states and peri-
ods of a man’s being are retained in _a connection with the
present by that principle of self-love which is unwilling to re-
linquish its hold on what has once been his. Though he can

events, yet he has felt it more important to himself than all
other trains together ; and you will very rarely ﬁnd him tired
of narrating again the little history, or at least the favorite parts
of the little history, of himself.

V 2. VVe ha.ve all accounted our life an inestimable possession,
which it deserved incessant cares and labors to retain, and
which continues in most cases to be still held with anxious at-
tachment. VVhat has been the object of so much partiality,
and has been delighted and pained by so many emotions, might
claim, even if the highest interest were out of the question,
that a short memorial should be retained by him who has pos-
sessed it, has seen it all to this moment depart, and can never
recall it.

3. With respect’ to any friend that greatly interests us, we
have always a curiosity to obtain an accurate -‘account of the
past train of his life and feelings; and, though there may be
several reasons for such a wish, it partly springs from a con-
sciousness how much this retrospective knowledge Would assist
to decide or conﬁrm our estimate of that friend; but our esti-
mate of ourselves is of more serious consequence.

4. The elapsed periods of life acquire importance, too, from
the prospect of its continuance. The smallest thing becomes
respectable, when regarded as the commencement of what has
advanced, or is advancing, into magnificence. The first rude

‘settlement of Romulus would have been an insigniﬁcant cir-

cumstance, and might justly have sunk into oblivion, if Rome
had not, at length, commanded the world. The little rill, near
the source of one of the great American rivers, is an interest-
ing object to the traveler, who is apprised, as he steps across
it, or walks a few miles along its bank, that this is the
stream which runs so far, and which gradually swells into so
immense a ﬂood.

5. So, while—I anticipate the endless progress of life, and
Wonder through what unknown scenes it is to take its course,
its past years lose that character of vanity, which would seem
to belong to a train of ﬂeeting perishing moments, and i see

of 'curiosity.about this little life, inwhich I am setting out on
such a progress: I can not be content without an accurate
sketch of the windings thus far of a stream which is to bear
me on forever. V g

6. I try to imagine how it will be to recollect, at a far distant
point of my era, what I was when here, and wish; if it were
possible, to retain, as I advance, the whole course ‘of my exist-
ence within the scope of clear reﬂection; to ﬁx in my mind so
strong an idea of what I have been in this original period of
my_time, that I shall possess this idea in ages too remote
for calculation. The review becomes still more important, when
I learn the inﬂuence which this ﬁrst part of the progress will
have on the happiness or misery of the next.

so high—only not supreme—-subordinate alone to the exercises

so surely ﬁnd rest from labor; succor under its burdens; for-
getfulness of its cares; composure .in its annoyances.

2. It is not always that the busy day is followed by the
peaceful night.’ It is not always that fatigue wins sleep. Often

some loss in a bargain; some loss by an insolvency; some un-
foreseen rise or fall in prices; some triumph of a mean or

fast in all fortune, a‘ genuine and passionate love of reading.

than “poppy or lmandragora, or all the drowsy syrups of the
world”———by that single taste, by that single capacity, he may
bound, in a moment, into the still regions of delightful studies,
and be at rest.

4. He recalls the annoyance that pursues him; reﬂects that
he has done all that might become a man to avoid or bear it;
he indulges in one good long, human sigh, picks up the volume
where the mark kept his place, and in about the same time that
it takes the Mohammedan, in the Spectator, to put his_head in
the bucket of water and raise it out, he ﬁnds himself exploring
the arrow-marked ruins of Nineveh with Layard; or worship-
ing at the spring—head of the stupendous Missouri with Clarke
and Lewis; or watching with Columbus for the sublime mo-
ment of the rising of the curtain from before the great mystery
of the sea; or looking reverentially on while Socrates-—the
discourse of immortality ended——-refuses the offer of escape,
and takes in his hand the poison, to die in obedience to the un-
righteous sentence of the law; or, perhaps, it is in the contem-
plation of some vast spectacle or phenomenon of Nature that
he has found his quick’ peace—-the renewed exploration of one
of her great laws—--or some glimpse opened by the pencil of
St. Pierre, or Humboldt, or Chateaubriand, or Wilson, of the
“ blessedness and glory of her own deep, calm, and mighty ex-

THE LITTLE IRON SOLDIER.
V ‘ JOHN G. WI—IIT'l‘IER.

1. Aininadab Ivison started up in his bed. The great clock
at the head of the staircase, an old and respected l1el1"~lO01D. of
the family, struclzione.

“ Ah,”  he, heaving up a great sigh from the depths of
his '1 ner man, "‘ l’ve had a tried time of it I”

“ﬁnd so have I,” said his Wife. “ Thee ’s been kiclzing, and
thrashing about all night. l do Wonder What ails thee.”

2. And well she might; for her husband, a well~—to‘-do, portly,

rniddleoaged gentleman, being blessed with an easy conscience,

a genial temper, and a comfortable digestion, Was able to bear
a great deal of sleep, and seldom Varied a note in the gamut
of his snore from one year’s end to another.

8. “A Very reinarliable exercise,” soliloquized Aminadab;
“ very I”

“ Dear me I what Was it ?” inquired his Wife.

“ Itmust have been a dream,” said Aminadab.

“O, is that all?” returned the good woman. “Pin glad
it ’s nothing worse. But what has thee been dreaming
about 3”

4. “ It ’s the strangest thing, Hannali, that thee ever heard

of,” said Aininadab, settling himself slowly‘ back into his bed. I

“ Thee recollects Jones sent me yesterday a sample of castings
from the foundry. ‘Well, I thought I opened the box, and
found in it a little iron man, in regimentals, with his sword
by his side, and a cooked hat on, looking‘ Very much like the
picture in the transparency over neighbor O’Ne2j.l’s oyster cellar
across the Way. _ .

5. “I thought it rather out of place for Jones to 1”urnish
me with such a sample, I should not feel easy to show it
to my customers, on account of its warlike appeaiance. l?h:>w~

set him -upon the table, against the wall; and, sitting down op-

posite, I’ began to think over my business concerns, calculating

how much they would increase in proﬁt, in case a tariff man
should be chosen our ruler for the next four years.’

6. “Thee knows I am not in favor of choosing‘ men of
blood and strife tobear rule in the land; but it, nevertheless,
seems proper to consider all the circumstances in this case, and,
as one or the other of the candidates of the two great parties
must be chosen, to take the least cf two evils. All at once I
heard a smart, quick tapping on the table; and, looking up,
there stood the little iron man close at my elbow, winking and
chuckling. ‘That ’s right, Aminadab I’ said he, clapping his
little metal hands together till he rang all over like a bell, ‘take
the least of two evils 1’

7. “His voice had a sharp, clear, jingling sound, like that
of silver dollars falling into a till. It startled me so that I
woke up; but,"ﬁnding it only a dream, presently fell asleep
again. Then I thought I was down in the Exchange, talking
with neighbor Simpkins about the election and the tariff. ‘ I
want a change in the administration, but I can’t vote for a mil-
itary chieftain,’ said neighbor Simpkins, ‘ as I look upon it
unbecoming a Christian people to elect men of blood for their

' rulers.’

8. “ ‘I don’t know,’ said I, ‘what objection thee can have to
a ﬁghting man; for thee ’s no Friend, and has n’t any consci-
entious scruples against military matters." For my own part,

I do not take much interest in politics, and never attended a ‘

caucus in my life, believing it best to keep very much in the
quiet, and avoid, as far as possible, all letting and hindering

things ; but there may. be cases where a military man may be

voted for as a choice of evils, and as a means of promoting
the prosperity of the country in business matters.’

9. ‘ Wl1atI" said neighbor Simpkins, ‘ are you going to vote
for a man Whose whole life has been spent in killing people ?’
This vexed me a little, and I told him‘ there was such a thing

‘as carrying a good principle too far, and that he might live to

be sorry that he had th,rown~ away his vote, instead of using it
discreetly. . ' , —

10. “ ‘ ‘Why, there ’s the iron business,’ said I ; but just then
I heard a clatter beside me; and, looking round, there was

‘be little. iron soldier clapping his hands in great glee. ‘ That’s.

t, Aminadab 1’ said he; ‘ business first, conscience afterward 3
Keep up the price of iron with peace, if you can, but keep it
up at any rate.’ This Waked me again in agood deal of
trouble; but, remembering that it is said that ‘ dreams come
of - multitude of business,’ I once more composed myself to
sleep.” ’ I

11. “Well, what‘ happened next ?’?, asked his wife.

.“ Why, I thought I was in the ii‘i‘e<;_l‘iIig~house, sitting on the
facing seat as usual. I tried hard to. settle my mind down

-into a quiet and humble state; but somehow the cares of the

world got uppermost, and, '*b,gt:ore I was well aware of it, I was
far gone in a calculation of thieifsztcliances of the election, and
the probablerise in the price of iiion, in the event of the choice
of a president favorable to a high tariff. T ,

12. “ Rap, rap, went something on the ﬂoor. I opened my

eyes, and there was the little image, red-hot, as if just out of

the furnace,’dancing, and chuckling, aid clapping his hands.
‘That ’s right, Aminadab 1’ said he; ‘go on as you have be-
gun; take care of yourself in this world, a.nd I ’ll promise you
you ’ll be taken care of in the next. Peace and poverty, or
war and money. It ’s'a choice of evils at best; and here ’s
Scripture to decide the matter ; “Be not righteous overmuch.” ’

13. “Then the Wicked—looking little image twisted his hot
lips, and leered at me with his blazing eyes, and chuckled and
laughed with a noise exactly  if a bag of dollars had been
poured out upon the meeting-house ﬂoor. This waked me just
now in such a fright. I wish thee would tell me, Hannah,
what thee can make of these three dreams ?” l

14. “It don’t need a Daniel to interpret them,” answered

’Hannah. “ Thee ’s been thinking of voting to-morrow for a

wicked old soldier, because thee cares more for thy iron busi-

ness than for thy testimony against Wars and ﬁghtings. I
don’t a bit wonder at thy seeing the iron soldier thee tells of ;
and, if thee Votes tO=-11101'1‘OW for a man of blood, it would n’t
be strange, if he should haunt thee all thy life.”

15. Aminadab Ivison was silent; for his conscience spoke in
the words of his wife. He slept no more that night, and rose
up in the niorning a Wiser and a better man.

‘vVhen he went forth to his place of business, he saw the
crowds hurrying to and fro; there were banners flying across
the streets, huge placards were on the Walls, and he lieaird all
about him the bustle of the great election.

16. “Friend Ivison,” said a red—faced lawyer, almost breath-
less with his hurry, “ more money is needed in the second
Ward; our coinmittees are doing a great work there. ‘What
shall I put you down for? Fifty dollars? If We carry the
election, your property will rise twenty per cent. Let me see;
you are in the iron business, I think ?” A

17. Aininadab thought of the little iron soldier of his dream,
and excused himself. Presently a bank director came tearing
into his oﬁice

“Have you Voted yet, Mr. Ivison? It ’s time to get your
vote in. I wonder you should be in your office now. No busi-
ness has so much at stake in this election as yours.”

“I don’t think I should feel entirely easy to vote for the
candidate,” said Aminadab.

18. “ Mr. Ivison,” said the bank director, “I always tool: you
to be a shrewd, sensible man, taking men and things as they
are. The candidate may not be all you could wish for; but,
when the question is between him and a Worse man, the best
thing you can do is, to choose the least of the two evils.”

19. “Just so the little iron man said,” thought Aminadab.
‘~” ‘. Get thee behind me, Satan 1’ No, neighbor Discount,” said
he, “I ’ve made up my mind. I see no warrant for choosing
evil at all. I can’t vote for that man.”

 

“ Very Well,” said the director, starting to l.eave the room;

“ you can do as you please; but, if we are deteated through

pinches in consequence, you need n’t expect us to help men
who won’t help themselves. Grood~day, sir I.”

20. Aminadab sighed heavily, and his heart sank Within
him; but he thought of his dream, and remained steadfa.st.
Presently he heard heavy steps and the_ tapping of a cane on
the stairs; and, as the door opened, he saw the drab surteut
of the worthy and much-esteemed friend who sat beside him
at the head of the meeting.

21. “ How ’s thee do, Aminadab ?” said he. “ Thee ’s voted,
I sﬁppose.”

' “ No, Jacob,” said he : “I don’t like the candidate. I ca.n’t
see my_ way clear to vote for a warrior.”

“ Well, but thee does n’t vote for him, because he is a
warrior, Aminadab,” argued the other; “thee votes for him
as a tariﬁ” man, and an encourager of home industry. I don’t
like his wars and ﬁghtings better than thee does; but I’m
told he ’s an honestlman, and that he disapproves of war in
the abstract, although he has been brought up to the business.

22. “If thee feels tender about the matter, I don’t like to urge
thee; but it really seems to me thee had better vote. Times
have been rather hard, thou knows ; and, if by voting at this
election, we can make business matters easier, I don’t see how
we can justify ourselves in staying at home. Thou knows we
have a command to be diligent in business as well as fervent
in spirit, and that the Apostle accounted him who provided
not for his own household, worse than an inﬁdel.

23. “ I think it important to maintain on all proper occasions
our Gospel testimony against wars and ﬁghtings ; but there is
such a thing as going to extremes, thou knows, and becoming
over-ser'upulous, as I think thou art in this case. It is said,
thou knows, in Ecclesiastes : ‘ Be not righteous overmuch: why
shouldst thou destroy thyself?’ ”

24:. “ Ah,” said Aminadab to himself, “ that ’s what the little
iron soldier said in meeting I” So he was strengthened. in his
resolution, and the persuasions of his friend were lost upon him.

25. At night Aminadab sat by his parlor ﬁre, comfortable
alike in his inner and his outer man. “ VVell, Hannah,” said he,
“ I ’ve taken thy advice. I did n’t vote for the great ﬁghter
to-day.”

“I ’m glad of it ;” said the. good Woman, “ and I dare say
thee feels the better for it.”

Aminadab Ivison slept soundly that night, and Saw no more
of the little iron soldier.

EXERCISE LII.

LAW OF COMPENSATION IN THE ATMOSPHERE.
LIEUTENANT M. F. MAURY.

' 1. VVhenever I turn to contemplate the works of nature, I
am struck with the admirable system of compensation, with the
beauty and nicety with which every department is poised by the
others; things and principles are meted out in directions the
most opposite, but in proportions so exactly balanced and
nicely adjusted, that results the most harmonious are produced.

2. It is by the action of opposite and compensating forces
that the earth is kept in its orbit, and the stars are held sus-
pended in the azure vault of heaven; and these forces are so
exquisitely adjusted, that, at the end of a thousand years, the
earth, the sun, and the moon, and every star in the ﬁrmament,
is found to come to its proper place at the proper moment.

3. Nay, philosophy teaches us, when the little snoW—drop,
which in our garden walks We see raising its beautiful head to
remind us that spring is at hand, was created, that the Whole
mass of the earth, from pole to pole, and from circumference to
center, must have been taken into account and weighed, in
order that the proper degree of strength might be given to the
ﬁbers of even this little plant. ‘

> 4. Botanists tell us that the constitution of this plant is such

as to require that, at a certain stage of its growth, the stalk
should bend, and the flower should bow its head, that an opera--
tion may take place which is necessary in order that the herb
should produce seed after its kind; and that, after this, its
vegetable health requires that itshould lift its head again and
stand erect. ’

5. Now, if the mass of earth had been greater or less, the
force of gravity would have been different; in that case, the
strength of ﬁber in the snow—drop, as it is, would have been too
mugli or too little; the plant could not bow or raise its head at
the right time, fecundation could not take place, and its family
would have become extinct with the ﬁrst individual that was

planted, because its “seed” would 11ot have been in “itself,” and,

therefore, it could not reproduce itself.

6. Now, if we see such perfect adaptation, such exquisite ad-
justment, in the case of one of the smallest ﬂowers of the
ﬁeld, how much more may we not expect “compensation” in the
atmosphere and the ocean, -upon the right adjustment and due
performance of which depends not only the life of that plant,
but the Well-being of every individual that is found in the en--
tire vegetable and animal kingdoms of the world?

7. VVhen the east winds blow along the Atlantic coast for a
little while, they bring us air saturated with moisture from the
Gulf Stream, and We complain of the sultry, oppressive, heavy
atmosphere; the invalid grows worse, and the well man feels ill,
because, when he takes this atmosphere into his lungs, it is
already so charged with moisture that it can not take up, and
carry off that which encumbers his lungs, and which nature
has caused his blood to bring and leave there, that respiration
may take up and carry it off. At other times the air is dry and
hot; he feelsthat it is conveying off matter from the lungs too
fast ; he realizes the idea that it is consuming him, and he calls
the sensation parching.

8. Therefore, in considering the general laws which govern
the physical agents of the universe, and regulate them in the
"due performance of their oﬁices, I have felt myself constrained

184 sixnonns’ NEW snnrns.

A

to set out with the assumption that, if the atmosphere had had

a greater or less capacity for moisture, or if the proportion of

land and water had been different———if the earth, air, and water

had not been in exact counterpoise—-—the whole arrangement

, of the animal and vegetable kingdoms would have varied from

their present state. But God chose to make those kingdoms
what they are ° for this purpose it was necessary, in his judg—
ment, to establish the proportions between the land and water,
and the desert, just as they are, and to make the capacity of the

, air to circulate heat and moisture just what it is, and to have it

to do all its work in obedience to law _and in subservience to
order.

9. If it were not so, why was power given to the winds to
lift up and transport moisture, or the property given to the sea
by which its waters may become ﬁrst vapor, and then fruitr"ul
showers or gentle dews? If the proportion and properties of
land, sea, and air were not adjusted according to the reciprocal

‘capacities of all to perform the functions required by each,

why should we be told that He “measured the waters in the
hollow of his hand, and comprehended the dust in a measure,
and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a bal-
ance?” ‘Why did He span the heavens, but that He might
mete out tne atmosphere in exact proportion to all the rest, and
impart to it those properties and powers which it was necessary
for it to have, in order that it might perform all those offices
and duties for which He designed it?

10. Harmonious in their action, the air and sea are obedient
to law, and subject to order in all their movements’; when we
consult them in the performance of their oﬁices, they teach us
lessons concerning the wonders of the deep, the mysteries ct?
the sky, the greatness, and the wisdom, and goodness of the
Creator. The investigations into» the broad-—spreading circle of
phenomena connected with the. winds of heaven and the waves
of the sea, are second to none for the good which they do, and
the lessons which they teach. The astronomer is said to see
the hand of God in the shy; but does not the rigl1t—minded

CHRISTIAN IN DOUBTING CASTLE.
JOHN BUNYAN.
1. Now there was, not . far from the place where they lay, a
castle, called Doubting Castle, the owner whereof was Giant
Despair, and it was in his grounds they now were sleeping;
wherefore he, getting up in the morning early, and walking up

and down in his ﬁelds, caught Christian and Hopeful asleep in A

his grounds. Then, with a grim and surly voice, he bid them
awake, and asked them whence they were, and what they did
in his grounds? They told him they were pilgrims and that
they had lost their way. Then said the giant, “ You have this
night trespassed on me, by trampling and lying on my ground,
therefore, you must go along with me.” So they were forced to
go, because he was stronger than they. , They also had but
little to say, for they knew themselves in fault.

2. The giant, therefore, drove them before him, and put them
into his castle, in" a very dark dungeon, nasty and stinking to
the spirits of these two men. H Here they lay from Wednesclay

morning till Saturday night, without onexbit of bread, or drop.

of drink, or light, or any to ask how they did : they were, there-
fore, here in evil case, and were far from friends and acquaint-
arce. N ow, in this place Christian had double sorrow; because
it was through his unadvised haste that they were brought into
this distress. .

3. N ow Giant Despair had a wife, and her name was Diffi-
dence : so when he was‘ gone to bed, he told his wife what he

had done, to wit, that he had taken a couple of prisoners and

192 szrnnnnsvnnw snnrns.

cast them into his dungeon, for trespassing on his grounds.
Then he asked her, also, what he had best to do further to
them. So she asked him what they were, whence they came,
and whither they were bound, an.d he told her. Then she
counseled him, that when he arose in the morning, he should
beat them without mercy. So when he arose, he getteth him a

grievous crab—tree cudgel, and goes down into the dungeon to,

them, and there first falls to rating them, as if they were dogs,
although they never gave him a word of distaste: then he
falls upon them, and beats them fearfully, in such sort that
they were not able to help themselves, or turn them upon the
floor. This done, he withdraws, and leaves them there to con-
dole their misery, and to mourn under their distress : so all that
day they spent their" time in nothing but sighs and bitter
lamentations. , i

4. The next night she talked with her husband about them
further, and, understanding that they were yet alive, did advise
him to counsel them to make away with themselves.‘ So when
morning was come, he goes to them in a surly manner, as be-
fore, and perceiving them to be very sore with the stripes that he
ha<:l given them the day before, he told them, that since they
were never like to come out of that place, their only way would
be f ‘“"'"_1\Vlt.l1 to make an end of themselves, either with knife,
halter,’ or poison : “ F or why,” said he, “should you choose life,
seeing it is attended with so much bitterness?” But they de—
sired him to let them go; with which he looked ugly upon
them, and rushing to them, had doubtless made an end of them
hiinseh”, but that he fell into one of his ﬁts, (for he sometimes in
sunshiny weather fell into ﬁts,) and lost for a time the use of
his hands : wherefore he withdrew, and left them, as before,
to consider what to do. Then did the prisoners consult between
themselves whether it was best to take his counsel or no ; and
thus they began to discourse 2

5. C’/‘tr. “Brother,” said Christian, “ what shall we do 3 The
life that we now live is miserable. For .my part, I know not
whether it is best to live thus, or die out of hand. ‘ ‘My soul

chooseth strangling rather than life,’ and the grave is more
easy for me than this dungeon! Shall -we be ruled by the
giant?” '

6. Hope. “Indeed, our present condition is dreadful, and death
would be far more welcome to me, than thus forever to abide;
but let us consider, the Lord of the country to which we are

 going hath said: Thou shalt do no murder: no, not to any

man’s person; much more then are we forbidden to take his
counsel to kill ourselves. Besides, he that kills another, can but
commit murder upon his body; but, tier one to kill himself,
is to kill body and soul at once. And, moreover, my brother,
thou talkest of ease in the grave ; but hast thou forgotten the
hell, whither for certain the murderers go? For no murderer
hath eternal life, 830. And let us consider, again, that all laws
are not in the hand of Giant Despair : i others, so far as I can
understand, have been taken by him as well as we, and yet have
escaped out of his hands.

7. “ VVho knows but that God, who made the world, may
cause that Giant Despair may die; or that, at some time or

“other, he may forget to lock us in; or that he may in a short

time have another of his ﬁts before us, and may lose the use of
his limbs? and, if ever that should come to pass again, for my
part, I am resolved to pluck up the heart of man, and to
utmost to get from under his hand. I was a fool that I t
try to do it before ; but, however, my brother, let us be patient,
and endure a while: the time may come that he may give us a
happy release; but let us not be our own murderers.” With
these words Hopeful at present did moderate the mind of his
brother; so they continued together, in the dark, that day in
their sad and doleful condition. '

8. Well, toward the evening, the giant goes down into the

   

dungeon again,_to see if his prisoners had taken his counsel,
‘ but when he came there he found them alive ; and truly, alive

was all; or now, what for wantof bread and water, and by

reason of the wounds they received when he beat them, they

could do little but breathe. But, I say, he found them alive;

at which heifell into a grievous rage, and told them, that seeing
they had disobeyed his counsel, it should be worse with them
than if they had never been born.

9. At this they trembled greatly, and I think that Christian
fell into a swoon; but, coming a little to himself again, they
renewed their discourse about the giant’s counsel, and whether
they had best take it or no. Now, Christian again seemed to
be for doing it; but Hopeful made his second reply as follow-
eth: , . _

10. ./‘lope. “ My brother,” said he, “ rememberest thou not how
valiant thou hast been heretofore ?’ Apollyon could not crush
thee, nor could all that thou didst hear, or see, or feel, in the
Valley of the Shadow of Death; what hardships, terror, and
amazement, hast thou already gone through I and art thou now
nothing but fear? Thou seest that.I am in the dungeon with
thee, a far Weaker man by nature than thou art; also, this giant-
has wounded me as well as thee, and hath also cut oil" the

bread and water from my mouth, and with thee I mourn with-

out the light. I But let us exercise a little more patience: re-

member how thou playedst the man at Vanity Fair, and wast»

neither afraid of the chain nor the cage, nor yet of bloody
death; wherefore let us, (at least to avoid the shame that be-

being a-bed, she asked concerning the prisoners, and if they
had taken his counsel ; to which he replied: “ They are sturdy
rogues; they choose rather’ to bear all hardships than to make
away w.th themselves.” Then said she: “Take them into the
castle yard to-morrow, and show them the bones and skulls of
those thou hast already dispatched, and make them believe, ere
a week comes to an end, thou wilt also tear them in pieces, as
thou hast done their fellows before them.” -

12. So when the morning was come, the giant goes to them
again, and takes them into the castle-yard, and shows them as
his wife had bidden him. “These,” said he, “ were pilgrims, as

0 not a Christian to be found in,) bear up with patience as
ﬁwe can.” ' .

you are, once ; and they trespassed on my grounds, as you have
done; and, when I thought ﬁt, I tore them in pieces, and so,
within ten days, I will do you : go, get ye down to your den
again 1” and with that he beat them all the way thither.

13. They lay, therefore, all day on Saturday in a lamentable
case, as before. Now, when night was come, and when Mrs.
Diﬁidenee, and her husband, the giant were got to bed, they be-
gan to renew their discourse of their prisoners; and, withal,

the old giant wondered that he could, neither by his blows nor

counsel, bring them to an end. And with that his wife replied:
“I fear,” said she, “that they live in hope that some one will come
to relieve them, or that they have picklocks about them, by the
means of which they hope to escape.” “And sayest thou so, my

dear ?” said the giant; “I will therefore search them in the morn-

ing.” _

14. Well, on Saturday, about midnight, they began to pray,
and continued in prayer till almost break of day. Now, a little
before it was day, good Christian, as one half amazed, broke
out in this passionate speech: “What a fool,” quoth he, “am I
thus to lie in a stinking dungeon, when I may as well walk at
liberty? I have a key in my bosom, called Promise, that will,
I am persuaded, open any lock in Doubting Castle.” Then said
Hopeful : “That ’s good news, good brother; pluck it out of thy
bosom and try.” ‘

15. Then Christian pulled it out of his bosom, and began to
try at the dungeon—door, whose bolt, as he turned the key,
gave back, and the door ﬂew open with ease, and Christian and
Hopeful both came out. Then he went to the outer door that
leads into the castle_-yard, and with his key opened that door
also After, he went to the iron gate, for that must be opened
too; but that lock went very hard, yet the key did open it.
Then they thrust open the door to make their escape with
speed; but ihat gate, as it opened, made such a cracking, that it
Waked Giant Despair, who, hastily rising to pursue‘ his prison-
ers, felt his limbs fail ; for his ﬁts took him again, so that he
could, by no means, go after them. Then they went on, and

came to the king’s highway, and so were safe; because they

16. Now, when they were gone over the stile, they began to
contrive with themselves what they should do at that stile to
prevent those that should come after from falling into the hands
of Giant Despair. So they consented to erect there a pillar,
and to engrave upon the stile thereof this sentence : “ Over this
stile is the way to Doubting Castle, which is kept by Giant
Despair, who despiseth the King of the Celestial Country, and
seeks to destroy his holy pilgrims.” Many, therefore, that fol-

BUNYA.N’S PILGrRIM’S PROGRESS.
MAOAULAY.
1. The characteristic peculiarity of the “ Pilgrim’s Progress”
is, that it is the only work of its kind which possesses a strong
human interest. Other allegories only amuse the fancy. The
allegory of Bunyan has been read by many thousands with
tears. ‘There are some good allegories in J ohnson’s works, and
some of still higher merit by Addison. In these performances
there is, perhaps, as much wit and ingenuity as in the “ Pilg'1‘im’S

Progress.” But the pleasure which is produced by the Vision

of Mirza, or the Vision of Theodore, the ‘genealogy of ‘Nit, or
the contest between Rest and Labor, is exactly similar to the
pleasure which we derive’ from one of Cowley’s Odes, or from a
Canto of Hudibras. It is a pleasure which belongs wholly to
the understanding, and in which the feelings have no part what-
ever. '

2. Nay, even Spenser himself, though assuredly one of the
greatest poets that ever lived, could not succeed in the attempt
to make allegory interesting. It was in vain that he lavished
the riches of his mind on the “ House of Pride,” and the “ House

of Temperance.” One unpardonable fault, the fault of tedious
ness, pervades the whole of the “ F aery Queen.” VVe become
sick of Cardinal Virtues and Deadly Sins, and long for the so-
ciety of plain men and women. Of the persons who read the
ﬁrst Canto, not one in ten reaches the end of the First Book,
and not one in a hundred perseveres to the end of the poem.
Very few and very weary are those who are in at the death of
the Blatant Beast. If the last six books, which aresaid to have
been destroyed in Ireland, had been preserved, we doubt whether
any heart less stout than that of a commentator, would have held
out to the end.

3. It is not so with the “ Pilgrim’s Progress.” That wonder-
ful book, while it obtains admiration from the most fastidious
critics, is loved by those who are too simple to admire it. Doc-
tor Johnson, all whose studies were desultory, and who hated,
ashe said, to read books through, made an exception in favor
of the “Pilgrim’s Progress.” i That work, he said, was one of
the two or three works which he wished longer. It was by no
common merit that the illiterate sectary extracted praise like
this from the most pedantic of critics, and the most bigoted of
Tories. In the wildest parts of Scotland, the “ Pilgrim’s Pro-
gress” is the delight of the peasantry. In every nursery, the
“ Pilgrim’s Progress” is a greater favorite than “Jack, the Giant-
killer.” . -

4. Every reader knows the straight and narrow path as well
as he knows a road in which he has gone backward and forward
a hundred times. This is the highest miracle of genius——that
things which are not, should be as though they were; that the
imaginations of one mind should become the personal recollec-
tions of another. And this miracle the tinker has wrought.
There is no ascent, no declivity, no resting-place, no turn—stile,
with which we are not perfectly acquainted. The wicket gate,
and the desolate swamp which separates it from the City of De-
struction ; the long line of road, as straight as a rule can make
it; the Interpreter’s house, and all its fair shows; the prisoner
in the iron cage ; the palace, at the doors of which armed men

kept_ guard, and on the battlements of which walked persons
cloth ed all in gold; the cross and the sepulcher; the steep hill
and the pleasant arbor; the stately front of the House Beauti-
ful by the wayside; the low green Valley of Humiliation, rich
with grass and covered with ﬂocks, are all as well known to us
as the sights of our own street. i

5. Then we come to the narrow place where Apollyon strode
right across the whole breadth of the way, to stop the journey
of Christian, and where, afterwards, the pillar was set up to testify
how bravely the pilgrim had fought the good ﬁght. As we ad-
vance, the valley becomes deeper and deeper. The shade of
the precipices on both sides falls blacker and blacker. The
clouds gather oveiﬂnead. Doleful voices, the clanking of chains,
and the rushing of many feet to and fro, are heard through the
darkness. The way hardly discernible in gloom, runs close by
the mouth of the burning pit, which sends forth its ﬂames, its
noisome smoke, and its hideous sh apes, to terrify the adventurer.
Thence he goes on, amid the snares and pitfalls, with the
mangled bodies of those who have perished, lying in the ditch
by his side. At the end of the long dark valley, he passes the
dens in which the old giants dwelt, amid the bones and ashes
of those whom they had slain. * * * *

6. The style of Bunyan is delightful to every reader, and ir
valuable as a study to every person who wishes to obtain a Wide
command over the English’ language. The vocabulary is the
vocabulary of the common people. There is not an expression,
if we except a few technical terms of theology, which would
puzzle the rudest peasant. We have observed several pages
which do not contain a single word of more than two syllables
Yet no writer has said more exactly what he meant to say. For
magniﬁcence, for pathos, for vehement exhortation, for subtle
disquisition, for every purpose of the poet, the orator, and the

divine, this homely dialect, the dialect of plain working—men, was’

perfectly sufﬁcient. There is no bookin our literature on which
we could so readily stake the fame of the old unpolluted English
language ; no book which shows so well how rich that language

is in its own proper wealth, and how little it has been improved
by all that it has borrowed. _

7. Cowper said, forty or ﬁfty years ago, that he dared not
name John Bunyan in his verse, for fear of moving a sneer. To
our reﬁned forefathers, we suppose, Lord Roscornmon’s “ Essay
on Translated Verse,” and the Duke of Buckinghamshire’s
“Essay on Poetry,” appeared to be compositions inﬁnitely su-
perior to the allegory of the preaching tinker. VVe live in bet»
ter times; and We are not afraid to say that, though there were
many clever men in England during the latter half of the seven-
teenth century, there were only two great creative minds. One
of those minds produced the “Paradise Lost ;”the other the
“ Pilgrim’s Progress.”

The wandering rivers for the fountain lake’.

But duty. Yet we see not all that is,
Or may be, some day, if we love the light.

A multitudinous world, where Heaven and Hell,
Strangely in battle met,
Their gonfalons have set.

“Dust though we are, and shall return to dust,
Yet being born to battles, ﬁght we must;
Under which ensign is our only choice.

We know to wage our best,

God only knows the rest.

And some things good, why not, with hand and soul

Wrestle, and succor out of wrong and sorrow--
Grasping the swords of strife, ‘

And Scotland hears its echoing far as Orkney’s breakers roar:
It climbs'New England’s rocky steeps as victor mounts a throne;
Niagara knows and greets the voice, still mightier than its own.

. It spreads where Winter piles deep snows on bleak Canadian plains.

And where, on Essequibo’s banks, eternal Summer reigns.
It tracks the loud, swift Oregon through sunset valleys rolled,
And soars where California brooks wash down their sands of gold.

It kindles realms so far apart, that while its praise you sing,
These may be clad with Autumn’s fruits, and those with ﬂowers of
Spring.

' It quickens lands whose meteor lights ﬂame in an Arctic sky,

VINDICATION FROM TREASON.
THOMAS F. ME.‘-IGHER.
1. It is my intention to say a few words only. I desire that
the last act of a proceed_ing which has occupied so much of the
public time, should be of short duration. Nor have I the in-
delicate wish to close the dreary ceremony of a State prosecu-

tion with a vain display of words. Did I fear that, hereafter,—- -

when I shall be no more——the, country I have tried to serve
would think ill of me,‘ I might, indeed, avail myself of this
solemn moment to vindicate my sentiments and my conduct.

But I have no such fear. The country will judge of those 'sen- '

timents and that conduct, iii a light far different from that in
which the ‘ jury, by which I have been convicted have viewed
them; and by the country, the sentence which you, my Lords,
are about to pronounce, will be remembered only as the severe
and solemn attestation of my rectitude and truth.

2. VVhatever be the language in which that sentence be
spoken, I know that my fate will meet with sympathy, and that
my memory Will be honored. In speaking thus, accuse me not,
my Lords, of an indecorous presumption. To the efforts I have
made in a just and noble cause, I ascribe no vain importance,———-
nor do I claim for those efforts any high reward. But it so
happens, and it will ever happen so, that those who have tried
to save their country, no matter how weak the effort may have
been, are sure to receive the thanks and blessings of its people.
With my country, then, I leavemy memory,:—my sentiments,—---
my acts,——-proudly feeling that they require no vindication from
me this day. '

3. A jury of my countrymen, it is true, have found me guilty
of the crime for which I stood indicted. For this I entertain not
the slightest feeling of resentment toward them. Inﬂuenced as
they must have been by the charge of the Lord Chief Justice,
they could have found no other verdict. What of that charge?

Any strong observations on it, I feel sincerely, would ill beﬁj
the solemnity of this scene; but I would earnestly beseech of
you, my Lord,--—you who preside on that bench ,——when the pas-
S1OI1S and the prejudices of this hour have passed away, to ap-
peal to your own conscience, and to ask of it, was your charge,

as it ought to have been, impartial and indiﬁerent between the I
subject and the crown?

4. My Lords, you may deem this language unbecoming in me,
and, perhaps, it may sealmy fate. But I am here to speak the
truth, whatever it may cost; I am here to regret nothing I
have ever done ;——to retract nothing Ihave ever said. I am
here to crave, with no lying lip, the life I consecrate to the lib-
erty of my country. Far from it, even here,——here, where the
thief, the libertine, the murderer, have left their foot—prints in
the dust,———here, on this spot, where the shadows of death sur-
round me, and from which I see my early grave opened to re-
ceive me,—-—eVen here, encircled by these terrors, the hope which
has beCl{OI16Cl,,~II18 to the perilous sea upon which I have been
wrecked, still consoles, animates, enraptures me. ‘

5. With these sentiments, my Lord, I await the sentence of
the Court. Having done what I felt to be my duty,~—having
spoken what I felt to be the truth, as I have done on every
other occasion of my short career, I now bid farewell to the
country of my birth, my passion, and my death,~—the country
whose misfortunes have invoked my sympatLies,—-whose fac-
tions I have sought to still,——whose intellect I have prompted
to a lofty aim,———whose freedom has been my fatal dream. I
offer to that country, as a proof of the love I bear her, and the
sincerity with which I thought, and spoke, and struggled for her
freedom,-——the life of a young heart, and, with that life, all the
hopes, the honors, the endearments of a happy and an honored
home.

6. Pronounce, then, my Lords, the sentence which the laws
direct, and I will be prepared to hear it. I trust I shall be pre-
pared to meet its execution. I hope to be able, with a pure heart
and perfect composure, to appear before a higher tribunal,-a

1. VVI at a glorious gift is that of eloquent utterance I Thai.
laureln of the warrior are only achieved on the ﬁeld of blood;
the honors of the statesman depend on the ﬁckle breath of thu
multitude ; but the author, the creator, he who in the seclusion
of his closet can commune with the solemn majesty of truth,
whose oracles [he has been chosen to interpret; he who can
people the narrow limits of his solitary chamber with images

‘of beauty; he who, amid the sands of worldliness has found

the “diamond of the desert,” while its sweet waters are well-
ing up in all their freshness and purity ; what a noble power is
his! _ .

2. And what a strange and mystic faculty is that which
gives to “ airy nothings” such shapes as make them seem,
even to the coarse—minded worldling, like familiar friends;
which imparts to unsubstantial dreams a visible and life—lil:e
presence; which invests the impalpable shadows of the brain
with the attributes of humanity, and demands for these fairy
creatures of the fancy our kindliest and warmest sympathy!
What a god-like gift is that which enables the lonely student
to sway the minds of myriads on whom his eye may never
rest with a glance of friendly recognition»; to move, as if by
one impulse, the hearts of thousands; to stir up high and holy
feelings in bosoms which the commerce of the world and the
exigencies of life had Echilled and hardened l

the a at of unfettered volition. The man who, in the sportive-
ness of health and spirits, will go into the woodland and
make the strokes of his ax ring through the forest aisles,
would ﬁnd little pleasure in the» same labor, if necessity had
driven him to be a hewer of wood. The Well trained dancer,
Whose lithe form moves to the voice of music, as if she were
but an embodiment of the spirit of harmony; feels none of the
pure joy which once possessed her, when, in the freedom of
childish mirth, her dance was but the evidence of a lightsome
heart.

4. It is only when the will is left free to direct the faculties
that We can derive full gratiﬁcation from our consciousness of
power; and, if this be true of the body, that mere machine
which, from its earliest sentient moment, is submitted to re-
straint and subjection; how much more so is it of the free
and unchained mind. It matters not whether the fetters that
are laid upon the soul be forged from the iron scepter of
necessity, or wrought from the golden treasures of ambition;
still they are but chains, and he who would feel the true_maj-

esty of mental power must never have worn the badge of ;

thralldom.

5. It is not the triumph of satisﬁed ambition, which affords

the highest gratiﬁcation to the truly noble—minded. Intellect-
ual toil is its own exceeding greatpreward. The applause of
the world may gladden the heart and quicken the pulse of
the aspirant for fame, but the brightest crown that was ever
laid on the brow of genius, imparts no such thrill of joy as he
felt in that delicious moment, when the consciousness of power
ﬁrst came upon him. ‘

-6. It is this sense of power, this ‘innate consciousness of
hidden strength, which is his most valued guerdon; and well
would it be forvhim, if the echoof worldly fame never re-
sounded in the quiet, secluded chambers of his secret soul!
Well would it be, if no hand ever offered to his lips the cup
of adulation, Whose magic sweetness awakens a thirst no re-
peated draughts can slake 1 Well would it be, if the voice of

a clamorous multitude never mingled with the sweeter music
of his own gentle fancies I

7. VVell would it be, if he could always abide in the pure
regions of elevated thought, leaving the mists and the dark-
ness, the lightnings and tempests of a lower world, beneath
his feet! Titian, living amid wealth and honors, and dying
in the arms of a /weeping monarch, presents to the eye of
thought, a far less noble pictures than the poor, unfriended
humble Correggio, when, at the sight of some glorious works
of art, the Vail which had hidden his own resplendent genius
was suddenly lifted from his eyes, and he exclaimed, in the ec-
stasy of an enlightened spirit: “Io (make so pittore !” I too am
a painter !

8. With the ﬁrst knowledge of innate power to the mind of
genius comes, also, the desire of beneﬁting humanity, and, at
that moment, when the ﬁre which God has lighted within the
soul, burns upward with a steady light toward Heaven, while
it diffuses its pure splendors on a darkened world around; at
such a moment man is, indeed, but little lower than the angels.

“ Could he keep. his spirit to this pitch
‘He might be happy ;”

but, alas! the mists of earth rise up around him; the light 1S
dimmed upon the altar; less holy gleams shoot athwart the
growing darkness, and, too often, the fading ﬂame of spiritual
existence is rekindled at the bale-ﬁres of the nether world.

9. There is something fearful in the responsibility which at-
taches to the expression of human thought and feeling. “We
may have done that yesterday,” says Madame de Stael, “ which
-has colored our whole future life.” Appalling as this idea is,
the reﬂection that in some idle mood, and in some uncounted
moment now gone past recall, we may have uttered that which
has inﬂuenced the opinions, the feelings, perhaps, the fate of
dnotiter, is even more terriﬁc to the conscience.

10. Who can not recollect some single word, some careless
remark, which, coming from lips fraught with eloquence, or

uttered from a heart ﬁlled with truth, has affected our early
fortunes and, perhaps, our life-long destiny? Who can not
look back upon some moment in life, when the unconscious
accents of another have withheld the foot which already
pressed the verge of some frightful precipice? Who can not
recall, in bitter anguish of spirit, some hour, when the “ voice
of the charmer” has won the soul to evil inﬂuences and late
remorse? '

11. If such’ things come within the experience of each one
of us (and that they do, no one can doubt,) may not every hu-
man being, however humble, feel awed before the simple power
of human expression? Oh! it is a fearful thing to pour out
one’s soul in eloquent utterance! fearful, because it opens the
inner sanctuary to the gaze of vulgar eyes ; fearful, because its
oracular voice is rarely interpreted aright; doubly fearful, be-
cause even its most truthful sayings may be of evil import to
those who listen to its teachings. '

EXERCISE LXII.

TACT VERSUS TALENT.

1. Talent is something, but not every thing. Talent is sen-
ous, sober, grave, and respectable. Tact is all that and more,

too; it is not a sixth sense, but it is the life of all the ﬁve ;.

it is the open eye, the quick ear, the judging taste, the keen
smell, and the lively touch; it is the interpreter of all riddles,

’ the surmounter of all difficulties, the remover of all obstacles.

It is useful in all places and at all times; it is useful in soli-
tude, for it shows a man his way into the world ; it is useful. in
society, for it shows his way through the world.

2. Talent is power, tact is skill. Talent is weight; tact is

momentum. Talent knows what to do ; tact knows how to do‘

it. Talent makes a man respectable; tact will make him re-

spected. Talent is wealth; tact is ready money. For all the
practical purposes of life, tact carries it against talent tento
one. Talent will produce you a tragedy that will scarcely live
long enough to be condemned, while tact keeps the house in a
roar, night after night, with its successful‘ farces. There is no
Want of dramatic talent, there is no want of dramatic tact, but
they are seldom together; hence We have successful pieces
which are are not respectable, and respectable pieces which
are not successful. , i

3. Take them to the bar, and let them i shake their learned
curls at each other in legal rivalry. ‘Talent sees its way
clearly, but tact is ﬁrst at its journey’s end. Talent receives
many a compliment from the bench, but tact receives fees from

attorneys and clients. Talent speak learnedly and logically; .

tact triumphantly. Talent makes the World wonder that it gets
on no faster; tact excites astonishment that it gets on so fast;
and the secret is that it has no weight to carry; it makes. no
false step, it hits the right nail on the head, it loses no time, it
takes all hints, and, by keeping its eye on the weather-cock, is
ready to take advantage of every wind that blows.

4. Take them into the church. Talent has always something
worth hearing; tact is sure of abundance of hearers. Talent
may obtain a living, tact will make one; talent gets a good
name, tact a great one. Talent convinces ; tact converts. Tal-
ent is an honor to the profession; tact gains honor from the pro-
fession. Take them to the court. Talent feels its weight; tact
ﬁnds its Way. Talent commands; tact is obeyed. Talent is
honored with approbation ; and tact is blessed by preferment.

5. Place them in the senate. Talent has the ear of the
house ; but tact Wins its heart, and has its votes. Talent is ﬁt
for employment; but tact is ﬁtted for it. It seems to know
every thing without learning any thing. It has served an in-
visible and extemporary apprenticeship. It needs no drilling;
it never ranks in the awkward squad; it has no left hand, no

' deaf ear, no blind side. It puts on no looks of wondrous wis-

dom; it has no air of profundity,b-ut plays with the detail of

place as dexterously as a well-taught hand ﬂourishes over the
keys of the piano-forte.

6. It has all the air of common-place, and all theforce and
power of genius. Talent calculates slowly, reasons logically,
makes out a case as clear as daylight, and utters its oracles
with all the weight of justice a.nd reason ; tact refutes without
*ontra<liction, puzzles the profound without profundity, and
without art outwits the wise. Set them together on a race for
popularity, and tact will distance talent by half the course.
Talent brings to market that which is wanted; tact produces
that which is wished for. Talent instructs; tact enlightens.
Talent leads where no one follows ; tact follows where the hur
11101‘ leads. ' ' T -

7 . Talent is pleased that it ought to have succeeded ; tact is

delighted that it has succeeded. Talent toils for a posterity,

which will never repay it; tact throws ‘away no pains, but
catches the passions of the passing hour. Talent builds for
eternity; tact for a short lease, and gets good interest. In
short, talent is certainly a very ﬁne thing to talk about, a very
good thing to be proud of, a very glorious eminence to look
down from; but tact is useful, portable, applicable~—always
alert, marketable; it is the talent of talents, the availableness
of resources, the application of power, the eye of discrimina-
tion, and the right hand of intellect.

THE CARELESS WORD.
, ' MRS. Names.
1. A Word is ringing through my brain ;
It Was not meant to give me pain ;
It had no tone to hid it stay,
When other things had passed away;
It had no meaning, more than all
Which in an idle hour do fall;
It Was, when ﬁrst the sound I heard,
A lightly uttered, careless word.

2. That word-—-oh 1 it doth haunt me now
In scenes of joy, in scenes of Woe;
By night, by day, in sun or shade,
With the half smile that gently played
Reproachfully, and gave the sound
Eternal power through life to wound;
There is no voice I ever heard,
So deeply ﬁxed as that one Word.

3. VVhen in the laughing crowd, some tone
Like those whose joyous sound is gone, ,
Strikes on my ear, I shrink,——for then
The careless word comes back again.

THERE’S A SILVER LINING TO EVERY CLOUD

, ELIZA COOK.
1. The poet or priest who told us this,

Served mankind in the holiest Way ;
For it lit up the earth with the star of bliss V
That beacons the soul with cheerful ray.
Too often we wander, despairing and blind,
Breathing our useless murmurs aloud;
But ’tis kinder to bid us seek and ﬁnd
“A silver lining to every cloud.”

‘2. May we not walk‘ in the dingle ground,
When nothing but autumn’s dead leaves are seen,
But search beneath them, and peeping around
Are the young spring—tufts'of blue and green. A
- ’Tis a beautiful eye that ever perceives
The presence of God in Mortality’s crowd ;
’Tis a saving creed that thinks and believes
“There ’s a silver lining to every cloud.”

- 3. Let us look closely before we condemn
E Bushes that bear no bloom nor fruit;
There may not be beauty in leaves or stem,
But virtue‘ may dwell far down at the root;
And let us beware how we utterly spurn
Brothers that seem all cold and .proud,——-
If their bosoms were opened, perchance we might learn
“There ’s a silver lining to every cloud.”

4. Let us not cast out Mercy and Truth,
V‘/Then Guilt is before us in chains and shame,
‘When Passion and Vice have cankered youth,
And Age lives on with a "branded name;
Something of good may still be there,
Though its voice may iiever be heard aloud,
For, while black with the vapors of pestilent air,
“ There ’s a silver lining to every cloud.”

5. Sad a.re the sorrows that oftentimes come,

Heavy and dull, and blighting and chill,

Shutting the light from o11r heart and our home,
Marring our hopes and defying our will ;

But let us not sink beneath the woe,
’Tis well, perchance, we are tried and bowed,

For be sure, though we may not oft see it below,
“There ’s a silver lining to every cloud.”

6. And when stern Death, with skeleton hand,
,_ Has snatched the ﬂower that grew in our breast,
Do we not think of a fairer land, ,
Where the lost are found, and the weary at rest?
Oh! the hope of the unknown future springs,
In its purest strength o’er the coﬂin and shroud,
The shadow is dense, but F aith’s spirit—voice sings

tiality; and under his administration the Weak were protected,
the learned received honor, and the diligent became rich ;
Mirza, therefore, was beheld by every eye with complacency,
and every tongue pronounced blessings on his head. .

2. But it was observed that he derived no joy from the bene-
ﬁts which he diffused ; he became pensive and melancholy ; he
spent his leisure in solitude;'in his palace he sat motionless
upon a sofa; and, when he Went out, his walk was slow, and his
eyes were ﬁxed upon the ground: he applied to the business
of state with reluctance, and resolved to relinquish the toil of
government, of which he could no longer enjoy the reward.

3. He therefore obtained permission to approach the throne
of our sovereign; and, being asked what was his request, he
made this reply: “ May the Lord of the World forgive the slave

Whom he has honored, if Mirza presume again to lay the bounty .

of Abbas at his feet. Thou hast given me the dominion of a
country fruitful as the gardens of Damascus; and a city glori-
ous above all others, except that only Which reflects the splen-
dor of thy presence. ‘But the longest life is a period scarcely

-suﬂicient to prepare for death. All other business is vain and

trivial, as the toil of emmets in the path of the traveler, under

Whose foot they perish forever; and all enjoyment is _unsub-

stantial and evanescent as the colors of the how, that appears in
the interval of a storm. Suffer me, therefore, to prepare for the
approach of eternity; let me give up my soul to meditation;
let solitude and silence acquaint me with the mysteries of devo-
tion; let me forget the World, and by the world be forgotten,
till the moment arrives in which the Avail of eternity shall fall,
and I shall be found at the bar of the Almighty.”

4. Mirza then bowed himself to the ground, and stoodysilent.
By the command of Abbas it is recorded that at these Words
he trembled upon the throne, at the footstool of which the World
pays homage; he looked round upon his nobles, but every

countenance was pale, and every eye was upon the earth. No‘

man opened his mouth, and the king ﬁrst broke silence, after it
had continued near an hour.

5. “Mirza, terror and doubt are come upon me. I an:
alarmed as a man who suddenly perceives that he is near the
brink of a precipice, and is urged forward by an irresistible
force : but yet I know not whether my danger is a reality or a.
dream. I am,’ as thou art, a reptile of the earth : my life is a
moment, and eternyy, in which days, and years, and ages, are
nothing,’eternity is before me, for which I also should prepare:
but by whom, then, must the faithful be governed? By those
only who have no fear of judgment? by those only whose life
is brutal, because, like brutes, they do not consider that they
shall die ? ‘

6. “Or who, indeed, are the faithful? Are the busy multi-
tudes that crowd the city in a state of perdition? and is the
cell of the Dervise alone the gate of paradise? To all, the life
of a Dervise is not possible: to all, therefore, it can not be a
duty. Depart to the house, which has, in this city, been pre-
pared for thy residence; I will meditate the reason of thy re-
quest; and may He who illuminates the mind of the humble,
enable me to determine with wisdom.”

7. Mirza departed ; and on the third day, having received no’

command, he again requested an audience, and_ it was granted.
When he entered the royal presence, his countenance appeared
more cheerful; he drew a letter from his bosom, and, having
kissed it, he presented it with his right hand. “My Lord,”
said he, “I have learned by this letter, which I received from
Cosrou, the Iman who stands now before thee, in what manner
life may be best improved. I am enabled to look back with
pleasure, and forward with hope; and I shall now rejoice still
to be the shadow of thypower at Tauris, and to keep those
honors which I so lately wished to resign.” '

8. The king who had listened to Mirza with a mixture of
surprise and curiosity, immediately gave the letter to Cosrou,
and commanded that it should be read. The eyes of the court
were at once turned upon the hoary sage, whose countenance
was suffused with an honest blush; and it was not witliout
some hesitation that he read these words: “To Mirza, whom

-9.. “Under the instruction of the physician Aluzar, I ob-
tained an early knowledge of his art. To those who were
smitten with disease, I could administer plants which the sun
has impregnated with the spirit of health. But the scenes of
pain, languor, and mortality, which were perpetually rising be-
fore me, made me often tremble for myself. I saw the grave
ope11-at my feet; I determined, therefore, to contemplate only
the regionsbeyond it, and to despise every acquisition which I
could not keep.

10. “ I conceived an opinion, that as there was no merit

but in voluntary poverty, and silent meditation, those who de--

sired money, were not proper objects of bounty ; and that by
all who were proper objects of bounty, money was despised.
I, therefore, buried mine in the earth ; and, renouncing society,
I wandered into a wild and sequestered part of the country.
My dwelling was a cave by the side of a hill. I drank the
running water from the spring, and ate such fruits and herbs
as I could ﬁnd. To increase the austerity of my life, I fre-
quently watched all night, sitting at the entrance of the cave,
with my face to the east, ‘resigning myself to the secret influ-
ences of the Prophet.

ceived the horizon glow at the approach of the sun, the power
of sleep became irresistible, and I sunk under it. I imagined
myself still sitting at the entrance of my cell ; that the dawn

was in motion; it increased in size as it drew near, and, at
length, I discovered it to be an eagle. I still kept my eye
ﬁxed steadfastly upon it, and saw it alight at a small dis-
tance, where I now descried a fox, whose two fore-legs ap-
peared to be broken. ‘Before this fox, the eagle laid part of
a kid, which she had brought in her talons, and then disap-
peared. ,
and blessed the Prophet for the instruction of the morning. I
reviewed my dream, and said thus to myself, Cosrou, thou hast
done well to renounce the tumult, the business and vanities of
life: but thouhast as yet only done it in part; thou art still,
every day, busied in the search of food; thy mind is not
wholly at rest; neither is thy trust in Providence complete.
What art thou taught by this vision? If thou hast seen an
eagle commissioned by Heaven to feed .a fox that is lame,
shall not the hand of Heaven, also, supply thee with food, when
that, which prevents thee from procuring it for thyself, is not
necessity, but devotion ? I

13. “I was now so conﬁdent of a miraculous supply, that I
neglected to walk out for my repast, which, after the ﬁrst day,
I expected with an impatience which left me little power of
attending to any other object. This impatience, however, I
labored to suppress, and persisted in my resolution; but my
eyes at length began to fail me, and my knees smote each
other; I threw myself backward, and hoped my weakness would
soon increase to insensibility. But I was suddenly roused by

‘ Cosrou, I am the angel, who, by the command of the Al-

now commissioned to reprove. While thou wast attempting to
become wise above that which is revealed, thy folly has per-

14. “At these words, I was not less astonished than if a
mountain had been overturned at my feet. I humbled myself
in the dust; I returned to the city; I dug up my treasure; I
was liberal, yetI became rich. My skill, in restoring health.
to the body, gave me frequent opportunities of curing the dis-
eases of the soul. I grew eminent beyond my merit; and it
was the pleasure of the king that I should stand before him.
Now, therefore, be not offended ; I boast of no knowledge that
I have not received. As the sands of the desert drink up the
drops of rain, or the dew of the morning, so do I, also, who

THE EPHEMERA; AN EMBLEM OF HUMAN LIFE.
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN.
1. You may remember, my dear friend, that when we lately

spent that happy day in the delightful garden and sweet so-
ciety of the Moulin Joly, I stopped a little in one of our walks,

and staid some time behind the company. We had been.

shown numberless skeletons of a kind of little ﬂy, called an
ephemera, whose successive generations, we were told, were

bred and expired within the day. I happened to see a living com-

pany of them on a leaf, who appeared to be engaged in conversa-
tion. You know I understand all the inferior animal tongues.
My too great application to the study of them is the best ex-
cuse I can give for the little progress I have made in your
charming language. _ ,

2. I listened through curiosity to the discourse of these little

creatures; but, as they, in-their national vivacity, spoke three-

or four together, I could make but little of their conversation.
I found, however, by some broken expressions that I heard now
and then, they were disputing warmly on the merit of two for-
eign musicians, one a cousin, the other-'a mzosquito ; in which

dispute they spent their time, seemingly as regardless of the A

shortness of life as if they had been sure of living a month.

wise, just, and mild government, since you have no public
grievances to complain of, nor any subject of contention, but
the perfections and imperfections of foreign music. I turned
my head from them to an old gray-headed one, who was single
on another leaf, and talking to himself. Being amused with his
soliloquy, I put it down in writing, in hopes it will likewise
amuse her to whom I am so much indebted for the most pleass
ing of all amusements, her delicious company and heavenly
harmony. ,

4. “It Was,” said he, “the opinion of learned philosophers
of our race, who lived and ﬂourished long before my time, that

_this vast world, the Moulin Joly, could not itself subsist more

than eighteen hours; and I think there was some foundation
for that opinion; since, by the apparent motion of the great
luminary that gives life to all nature, and which in my time has
evidently declined considerably toward the ocean at the end
of our earth, it must then ﬁnish its course, be extinguished in
the waters that surround us, and leave the world in cold and
darkness, necessarily producing universal death and destruction.

5. “ I have lived seven of those hours, a great age, being no
less than four hundred and twenty minutes of time. How very
few of us continue so long! I have seen generations born,
ﬂourish, and expire. My present friends are the children and
grandchildren of the friends of my youth, who are now, alas,
no more! And I must soon follow them; for, by the course
of nature, though still in health, I can not expect to live above
seven or eight minutes longer. .

—CONVERSATION, AS A MEANS OF CULTURE.
‘ THOMAS DE QUINCEY.

1. The ﬂight of our human hours, not really more rapid at
any one moment than another, yet oftentimes to our feelings
seems more rapid, and this ﬂight ‘startles us, like guilty things,
with a more affecting sense of its rapidity, when a distant church-
clock strikes in the night—time, or when, upon some solemn
summer evening, the sun’s disk, after settling for a minute with
farewell horizontal rays, suddenly drops out of sight. The
record ofxour loss, in such acase, seems to us the ﬁrst intimation
of its possibility ; as if we could not be made sensible that the
hours werelperishable, until it is announced to us that already
they have perished. , A

2. We feel a perplexity of distress when that which seems t
us the cruelest of injuries, a robbery committed upon our dear-
est possession by the conspiracy of the world outside, seems,
also, as in part, a -robbery sanctioned by our own collusion.
The world, and the customs of the world, never cease to levy
taxes ‘upon our time; that is true, and so far the blame is not
ours ; but the particular degree in which we suﬂer by this rob-
bery, depends much upon the weakness with which we ourselves
become parties to the wrong, or the energy with which we re-
sist it. Resisting or not, however, we are doomed to suffer a
bitter pang as often as the irrecoverable ﬂight of our time is
brought home with keenness to our hearts. ‘

3. The spectacle of a lady ﬂoating over the sea in a boat,
"and waking suddenly from sleep to ﬁnd her magniﬁcent ropes
of pearl-necklace, by some accident detached at one end from
its fastenings, the loose string hanging down into the Water, and
pearl after pearl slipping off forever into the abyss, brings be-
fore us the sadness of the case. That particular pearl, which at
the very moment is rolling off into the unsearchable deeps, car-
ries its own separate reproach to the lady’s heart. But it is
more deeply reproachful as the representative of so many others,
uncounted pearls, that have already been swallowed up irrecov-
erably while she was yet sleeping, and of many beside that must
follow, before any remedy can be applied to What We may call
this jewelly hemorrhage. A constant hemorrhage of i the same
kind is wasting our jewelly hours. ‘

4. A day has perished from our’ brief calendar of days: and
that we could endure; but this day is no more than the reitera-
tion of many other days, days counted by thousands, that have
perished to the same extent and by the same unhappy means,
viz., the evil usages of the world, made effectual and ratiﬁed by
our own Zache2fé.* ‘ Bitter is the upbraiding which we seem to
hear from a secret monitor: “My friend you make very free
with your days: pray, how ma-ny do you expect to have? What
is your rental, as regards the total harvest of days which this
life is likely to yield?

5. Let us consider. Threescore years and ten produce a total
sum of 25,550 days; to say nothing of some seventeen or eight
een more that will be payable to you as a bonus on account of
leap years. Now, out of this total, one third must be deducted
a.t a blow for a single item, viz., sleep. Next, on account of ill-
ness, of recreation, and -the serious occupations spread over the
surface of life, it will be little enough to deduct another third.
Recollect, also, that twenty years will have gone from the earlier
end of your life, (viz., above seven thousand days) before you
can have attained any skill or system, or any deﬁnite purpose in
the distribution of your time. Lastly, for that single item

ties, viz., eating, drinking, washing, bathing, and exercise, de-
duct the smallest allowance consistent with propriety, and, upon
-summing up all these appropriations, you will not ﬁnd so much
as four thousand days left disposable for direct intellectual culture.

6. Four thousand, or forty hundreds, will be a hundred for-

six weeks by the phrase of “ forty days,” you will have a hun-
dred bills or drafts on Father Time, value six /weeks each, as the
whole period available for intellectual labor. A solid block of
about eleven and a half continuous years is all that a long life
will furnish for the development of what is most august in man’S
nature. After that, the night comes when no man can work;
brain and arm will be alike unserviceable ; or, if the life should
be unusually extended, the vital powers will be ‘drooping as re-
gards all motions in advance. .

7. Limited thus severely in his direct approaches to knowl-
edge, and in his approaches to’ that which is a thousand times
more important than knowledge, viZ., the conduct and discipline
of the knowing faculty, the more clamorous is the necessity
that a wise man should turn to account any INDIRECT and sup-
plementary means toward the same ends ; and among these
means a chief one by right and potentially is CONVERSATION.
Even the primary means, books, study, and meditation, through
errors from without and errors from within, are not t/Lat which
they might be made. Too constantly, when reviewing his own
eﬁforts for improvement, a man has reason to say : (indignantly,
as one injured by others; penitentially, as contributing to this
injury himself 1) “Much of my studies has been "thrown away;
many books which were useless or worse than useless, I have
read; manybooks which ought to have been read, I have left
unread; such is the sad necessity under the absence of all pre-

8. In a Wilderness so vast as that of books, to go astray
often and widely is pardonable, because it is inevitable; and
in proportion as the errors on this primary field of study have
been great, it is important to have reaped some compensatory
beneﬁts on the secondary ﬁeld of conversation. Books teach
by one machinery, conversation by another; and, if these re-
sources were trained into correspondence to their own separate
ideals, they might become reciprocally the complements of
each other. The false selection of books, for instance, might
often be rectified’ at once by the frank collation of experiences,
which takes place in miscellaneous colloquial intercourse.

9. But other and greater advantages belong to conversation
for the effectual promotion of intellectual culture. Social dis-
cussion supplies the natural integration for the deﬁciencies of
private and sequestered study. Simply to rehearse, simply
to express in words among familiar friends, one’s own intel-
lectua.l perplexities, is oftentimes to clear them up. It is
iivell known that the best means of learning is by teaching;
the effort that is made for others is made eventually for our-
selves; and the readiest method of illuminating obscure’ con-
ceptions, or maturing such as are crude, lies in’ an earnest
effort to make them apprehensible by others. Even this is
but one among the functions fulﬁlled by conversation.

10. Each separate individual in a company is likely to see
any problem or idea under some diﬂ'"erence of angle. Each
may have some difference of views to contribute, derived either
from a different course of reading, ora different tenor of re-
ﬂection, or, perhaps, a different train of experience. The ad
vantages of colloquial discussion are not only often commensu-
rate in degree to those of study, but they recommend themselves,
also, as being different in kind ; they are special and Sui. gen-
e-r2'.s.* It must, therefore, be important that so great an organ
of intellectual development should not. be neutralized by mis-
management, as generally it is, or neglected through insensi-
bility to its latent capacities.

ANCIENT AND MODERN ELOQUENCE.‘
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

1. With the dissolution of Roman liberty, and the decline of
Roman taste". the reputation and the excellency of the oiatorical
art, fell'aliI€e into decay. Under the despotism of the Caesars,
the end of eloquence was perverted from persuasion to pane-
gyric, and all her faculties were soon palsied by the touch of
corruption, or enervated by the impotence of servitude. Then
succeeded the darkness of the middle ages, when with the other
liberal arts, she slumbered in the profound darkness of the cl oister.

2. At the revival of letters in modern Europe, Eloquence, to-
gether with her sister muses, awoke, and shook the poppies
from her brow. But their torpors still tingled in her veins. In
the interval her voice was gone; her. favorite languages were
extinct; her organs were no longer attuned to harmony, and
her hearers could no longer understand her speech. The dis-
cordant jargon of feudal anarchy had banished the musical dia-
lects in which she had always delighted.

3. The theaters of her former triumphs were either deserted,
or they were ﬁlled vvith the babblers of sophistry and chicane.
She shrunk intuitively from the forum; for the last object she
remembered to have seen there was the head of her darling
Cicero, planted upon the rostrum. She ascended the tribunals
of justice; there she found her child, Persuasion, manacled and
pinioned by the letter of the law ; there she beheld an image of
herself’, stammering in barbarous Latin, and staggering under
the lumber of a thousand volumes.

  4. Her heart fainted Within her. she lost all conﬁdence, in
herself’. Together with her irresistible powers, she lost propor-
tionably the consideration of the World, until, instead of com-
prising the whole system of public education, she found herself
excluded from the circle of science, and declared an outlaw
from the realms of learning.

5. She was not, however, doomed to eternal silence. With
the progress of freedom and of liberal science, in various parts
of modern Europe, she obtained access to mingle in the delib-
erations of their parliaments. With labor and diﬁiculty she
learned their languages, and lent her aid in giving them form
and polish. But she has never recovered the graces of her
"ormer beauty, nor the‘ energies of her ancient vigor.

THE ART OF BOOK—KEEPIN(:‘r.,
THOMAS HOOD.
' I.

How hard, when those who do not wish to lend, thus lose, their books,
Are snared by ang1ers,—-folks that ﬁsh with literary Hooks,-—
Who call and take some favorite tome, but never read it through;
They thus complete their set at home, by making one at you.

II.

I, of my “Spenser” quite bereft, last winter sore was shaken;

Of “Lamb” I ’ve but a quarter left, nor could I save my “ Bacon ;”
And then I saw my “Crabbe,” at last, like Hamlet, backward go;
And, as the tide was ebbing fast, of course I lost my “Rowe.”

III.

‘

My “ Mallet” served to knock me down, which makes me thus a talker;

And once, when I was out of town, my “Johnson” proved an “ Walker.”

VVhile studying, o’er the ﬁre one day, my “Hobbes,” amidst the smoke,-
They bore my " Colman” clean away, and carried off my “ Coke.”

IVO

They picked my “Locke,” to me far more than Bramah’s patent worth,
And now my losses I deplore, without a “Home” on earth I

If once a book you let them lift, another they conceal,

For though I caught them stealing “Swift,” as swiftly went my “ Steele.”

“ Hoge” is not now upon my shelf; Where late he stood elated;

But what .s strange, my “Pope” himself‘ is excommunicated.

My little “Suckling” in the grave is sunk to swell the ravage;

And What Was Grusoe’s fate to save, ’t was mine to lose,—a “Savage.”

VI.

Even “Grlover’s” Works I can not ‘put my frozen hands upon;
Though ever since I lost my “ -Foote,” my “Bunyan” has been gone.
My “Hoyle” with “Cotton” Went oppressed; my “Taylor,” too, must
fail;
To save my “Goldsmith” from arrest, in vain I offered “ Bayle.”

VII.

I “ Prior” sought, but could not see the “Hood” so late in front;

And when I turned to hunt for “Lee,” 01 Where was my “Leigh
Hunt ?” .

I tried to laugh, old care to tickle, yet could not “Tickle” touch;

And then, alaok! I missed my “ Mickle,”—-and surely Micl;le’s much.

VIII.

’Tis quite enough my griefs to feed, my sorrows to excuse,

To think I can not read my “Reid,” nor even use my “ Hughes ;”
My classics Would not quiet. lie, a thing so fondly hoped;

Like Dr. Primrose, I may cry, my. “Livy” has eloped.

IX.

My life is ebbing fast away; I suffer from these shocks,

And though I fixed a lock on “Gray,” there ’s gray upon my l.ocks;
I ’m far from “Young,” am growing pale, I see my “Butler” ﬂy ;
And when they ask about my ail, ’tis “Burton” I reply.

X.

They still have made me slight returns, and thus my griefs divide
For 0! they cured me of my “Burns,” and eased my “ Akenside.”
But all I think I shall not say, nor let my anger burn,

For, as they never found me “ Gay,” they have not left me “ Sterne.”

of the woods, held in especial reverence by the tillers of the soil. They
are represented as having the legs, feet, and ears of goats, and the re-
maining parts those of a human being.

2. DRY’ADs, or DRY’A DES, that is, Wood-Nymphs, form one of the vari
ous classes of nymphs, or female deities, with which the imagination of’
the ancient Greeks peopled the woods and groves. The nymphs were
the attendants of the goddesses. They waited on'Juno and Venus,
and, arrayed in the attire of a huntress, accompanied "Diana in the
chase.

3. SAT'YRs, or SATYRI, were a sort of demi-gods presiding over, or
dwelling in, the country. They had feet and legs like those of goats,
short horns on the head, _and the whole body covered With hair. The
Satyrs were among the Greeks what the Fauns were among the R0-

THE LIFE or BURNS.
THOMAS CARLYLE.
1. Properly speaking, there is but one era in the life of
Burns, and that the earliest. We have "not youth and man-
hood; but only youth; for, to the end, we discern no decisive

change in the complexion of his character: in his thirty—sev-

enth year, he is still, as it were, in youth. With all that reso-
luteness of judgment, that penetrating insight, and singular
maturity of intellectual power exhibited in his writings, he
Ifever attains to any clearness regarding himself: to the last he
never ascertains his peculiar aim, even with such distinctness as
is common among ordinary men; and, therefore, never can pur-=
sue it with that singleness of will, which insures success and
some contentment to such men.

Hren scnoor. READER. 241

‘2. To the last, he wavers between two purposes. giorying in
his talent, like a true poet, he yet can not consent to make this
his chief and sole glory, and to follow it as the one thing need-

ful, through poverty or riches, through good or evil report.

Another far meaner ambition still cleaves to him; he must
dream and struggle about a certain “ Rock of Independence ;”
which, natural and even admirable as it might be, was still but
a warring with the world, on the comparatively insigniﬁcant
ground of his being more or less completely supplied with
money than others ; ‘ of his standing at a higher, or at a
lower altitude in general estimation, than others. For the
world still appears to him, as to the young, in borrowed colors:
he expects from it what it can not give to any man; seeks for
contentment, not within himself, in action and wise effort, but
from without, in the kindness of circumstances, in love, frien(l-
ship, honor, pecuniary ease. I

3. He would be happy, not actively and in himself, but pass-
ively, and from some ideal cornucopia of enjoyments, not
earned by his own labor, but showered on him by the beneﬁ-
cence of Destiny. Thus, like a_ young man, he can not steady
himself for any ﬁxed or systematic pursuit, but swerves to and
fro, between passionate hope, and remorseful disappointment:
rushing onward with a deep tempestuous force, be surmounts
or breaks asunder many'a barrier; travels, nay, advances far,
but advancing only under certainguidance, is ever and anon
turned from his path : and to the last, can not reach the only
true happiness of a man, that of clear, decided activity in the
sphere -for which, by nature and circumstances, he has been ﬁt-
ted and appointed.’ '

,4. Wle do not say these things in dispraise of Burns: nay,
perhaps, they but interest us the more in his favor. This bless-
ing is not given soonest to the best; but rather, it is often the
greatest minds that are latest in obtaining it ; for where most is
to be developed, most time may be required to develop it. A
complex condition had been assigned him from without, as com-
plex a condition from within: “no pre-established harmony” ex-

l1is arm long cumbered, and his sight confused, in so vast and
discordant an economy, as he had been appointed steward over.
Byron was, at his death, but a year younger than Burns ; and
through life, as it might have appeared, far more simply situ-
ated; yet in him, too, we can trace no such adjustrnent, no
such moral manhood ; but, at best, and only a little before his
end, the beginning of what seemed such. ’

5. By much the most striking incident in Burns’s Life is his
journey to Edinburg; but, perhaps, *a still more important one
is his residence at Irvine, so early as in=his twenty-third year.
Hitherto his life had been poor and toil-worn; but otherwise
not ungenial, and, with all its distresses, by no means unhappy.
In his parentage, deducting outward circumstances, he had
every reason to reckon himself fortunate : his father was a man
of thoughtful, intense, earnest character, as the best of our
peasants are ; valuing knowledge, possessing some, and, what is
far better and rarer, open-minded for more ; a man with a keen
insight, and devout heart; reverent toward God, friendly, there-
fore, at once, and fearless toward all that God has made; in one
word, though but a hard-handed peasant, a complete and fully
unfolded Jifom.

6. Such a father is seldom found in any rank in society ; and
was worth descending far in society to seek. Unfortunately he
was very poor; had he been even a little-richer, almost ever so
little, the whole might have issued far otherwise.“ Mighty events
turn on a straw; the crossing of a brook decides the conquest
of the World. Had this Williarn Burns’ small seven acres of
nursery ground anywise prospered, the boy Robert had been
sent to school; had struggled forward, as so many weaker men
do, to some University ; came forth not as a rustic wonder, but
as a regular well-trained intellectual workman, and changed the
whole course of British Literature,———for it la.y in him to have
done this I

HIGH scnoor. READER. 243

V

7. But the nursery did not prosper; poverty sank his whole
family belpw the help of even our cheap school—system : Burns
remained a hard—worked plow-boy, and British liter_ature took
its own course. Nevertheless, even in this rugged scene, there
is much to nourish him. If he drudges, it is with his brother,

and for his father and mother Whom he loves, and would fain if
shield from Want. Wisdom is not banished from their poor’

hearth, nor the balm of natural feeling : the solemn words, Let
us wars/zip God I are heard there from a “ priest-like father 1” if
threatenings of unjust men throw mother and children into
tears, these are tears not of grief only, but of holiest affection :
every heart in that humble group feels itself the closer knit to
every other: in their hard Warfare they are there together, a
“little band of brethren;”

8. Neither are such tears, and the deep beauty that dwells in
them, their only portion. “Light Visits the hearts as it does the
eyes of all living: there is force, too, in this youth, that enables
him to trample on misfortune ; nay, to bind it under his feet to
make him sport. For a bold, warm, buoyant humor of charac-
ter has been given him ; and so the‘thick—coming shapes of evil
ire welcomed with a gay, friendly irony, and, in their closest
pressure, he bates no jot of heart or hope. Vague yearnings of
ambition fail not as he grows up; dreamy fancies hang like
cloud—cities around "him ; the curtain of existence is slowly
rising, in many—colored splendor and gloom; and the auroral
light of first love is gilding his horizon, and the music of song
is on his path ; and so he walks

 

. “in glory and in joy,
Behind his plow, upon the mountain side.” ‘
9. We know, fr-om the best evidence, that up to this date,
Burns was happy; nay, that he was the gayest, brightest, most
fantastic, fascinating being to be found in the world ; moie so
even than he ever afterwards appeared. But now, at this early
age, he quits /-the paternal roof; goes forth into looser, louder,
more exciting society; and becomes initiated in those dissipao
tions, those vices, which a certain class of philosoplners have

asserted to be a natural preparative for entering on active life ;
a kind of mud-ba.th, in which the youth is, as it Were, necessi-
tated to“steep, and, we suppose, cleanse himself, before the real
toga of manhood can be laid on him.

.10. VVe shall not dispute much with this class of philoso-
phers, we hope: they are mistaken: for Sin and Remorse so
easily beset us at all stages of life, and are always such indif-
ferent company, that it seems hard We should, at any stage, be
forced and fated not only to meet, but to yield to them ; and
even serve for a term in their leprous armada. ‘We hope it is not
so. Clear we are, at all events, it can not be the training one
receives in this service, but only our determining to desert from
it, that ﬁtsus for true manly action. We become men, not
after We have been dissipated, and disappointed in the chase of
false pleasure; but after we have ascertained, in any Way, what
impassable barriers hem usin through this life ; how mad it is
to hope for contentment to our inﬁnite soul from the gifts of
this extremely finite World I that a. man must be sufﬁcient for
himself; and that “ for suffering and enduring there is no
remedy but striving and doing.”

11. Manhood begins when We have in any Way made truce
with necessity; begins, at all events, when we have surren-
dered to necessity, as the .most part only do; but begins joy-
fully and hopefully only when We have reconciled ourselves to
necessit :, and thus, in reality, triumphed over it, and felt that

in necessity we are free. Surely, such lessons as this last,

which, in one shape or other, is the grand lesson for every mor-
tal man, are better learned from the lirsof a devout mother, in
the looks and actions of a devout father, while the heart is yet
soft and pliant, than in collision With the sharp adamant of
Fate, attracting us to shipwreck us, when the heart is grown
hard, and may be broken before it will become contrite! Had
Burns continued to learn this, as he was already learning it, in
his father’s cottage, he would have learned it fully, which he
never did,~-and been saved many a lasting aberration, many a
bitter hour and year of remorseful sorrow.

old Sheva forced it upon him.

Sir §tep/zcn.—-—It mocks all belief; it only pr_oves that Sheva,
the most inveterate miser in existence, has a fellow Jew for his
servant, one of the completest liars in existence.

Saunde7's.——I am apt to give him credit for the fact, notwith-
standing. I

Sir Stephen.—Then give me leave to say, you have more
faith than most men living : was I to give so much credit, Mr.
Saunders, I should soon stop.

~ Sazmde7's.—-—I am not quite so ﬁxed in my persuasion of old
Sheva’s character as you are. In his dealings, all the world
knows he is punctiliously honest: no 1nan’s character stands
higher in the Alley; and his servant tells me, though he starves
hiinself, he is secretly very charitable to others.

Sir Stephen".-——Yes; this you may believe, if you are disposed
to take one Jew’s word for another Jew’s character : I am. ob-
stinate against both ; and, if he has supplied the money, as I am
sure it must be on usurious principles, as soon as ever I have
the old miser in my reach, I will wring either the truth from
his lips, or the life out of his carcass.

Or the water frame its monads, or the mist its swarming

MILITARY GENIUS.
- ‘ CHANNING.
1. Military talent, even of the highest order, is far from hold
ing the ﬁrst place among intellectual endowments. It is one

of the lower forms of genius ;‘ for it is not conversant with the

highest and richest objects of thought. We grant that a mind,
which takes in a wide country at a glance, and understands,
almost by intuition, the positions it affords for a successful cam-
paign, is a comprehensive and vigorous one. The gene; al who
disposes his forces so as to counteract a greater force; who
supplies by skill, science, and invention, the want of numbers ;
who dives into the counsels of his enemy, and who gives unity,
energy, and success to a vast variety of operations, in the midst
of casualties and obstructions which no vvisdom could foresee,
manifests great power.

2. But still the chief work of a general is to a.pply physical
force; "to remove physical obstructions; to avail himself of
physical aids and advantages; to act on matter; to overcome
rivers, ramparts, mountains, and human‘ muscles ; and these are
not the highest objects of mind, nor do they demand intelli-
gence of the highest order; and, accordingly, nothing is more
common than to ﬁnd men, eminent in this department, who are
wanting in the noblest energies of the soul; in habits of pro-
found and liberal thinking, in imagination and taste, » in the
capacity of enjoying works of genius, and in large and original
views of human nature and society. ’

3. The office of a great general does not differ widely from
that of a great ...mechanician whose business it is to frame new
combinations of physical forces, to adapt them to new circum-
stances, and to remove new obstructions. Accordingly, great
generals, away from the camp, are often no greater men .than
the mechanician taken from his workshop. In conversation
they are often dull. Deep and reﬁned reasonings they can not
comprehend. We know that there are splendid exceptions.
Such was Caesar, at once the greatest soldier and the most
sagacious statesman of his age; while in eloquence and litera-
ture, he left behind him almost all who had devoted themselves
exclusively to these pursuits. ‘ But such cases arerare.

4. The conqueror of Napoleon, the hero of Waterloo, pos-
sesses undoubtedly great military “talents; but we do not under-
stand that his most partial admirers claim for him a place in
the highest class of minds. We will not go down for illustra-
tion to such men as Nelson, a man great on the deck, but de-
based by gross vices, and who never pretended to enlargement
of intellect. To institute a comparison in point of talent and
genius between such men and Milton, Bacon, and Shakspeare,
is almost an insult on these illustrious names. W

calm wisdom and fervid imagination which they conjoined ; of
the Voice of power, in which “though dead, they still speak,”
and awaken intellect, sensibility, and genius in both hemi
pheres,———who can think of such men, and not feel the immense
inferiority of the most gifted warrior whose elements of thought
are physical forces and physical obstructions, and whose em-
ployment is the combination of the lowest class of objects on
which a powerful mind can be employed?

PROSE AND POETRY. ‘
HENRY mam.

1. It is a good practical rule to keep one’s reading well pro-
portioned in the two great divisions, prose and poetry. This is
very apt to be neglected, and the consequence is a great loss of
power, moral and intellectual, and a loss of some of the high-
est enjoyments of literature. It sometimes happens that some
readers devote themselves too much to poetry; this is a great
mistake, and betrays an ignorance of the true use of poetical
studies. ‘VVhen this happens, it is generally with those whose
reading lies chieﬂy in the lower and merely sentimental region
of poetry; for it is hardly possible for the imagination to enter

2. The disproportion lies usually in the other‘ direction,--
prose reading to the exclusion of poetry. This is Owing chieﬂy
to the want of proper culture ; for, although, there is certainly

a great disparity of imaginative endowment, still the imagina-
tion is part of the universal mind of -man, and it is a work of
education to bring it into action in minds even the least imag-
inative. It is chieﬂy to the willfully unimaginative mind that
poetry, _with all its wisdom and all its glory, is a sealed book.

3. It sometimes happens, however, that a mind, well gifted
with imaginative power, loses the capacity _to relish poetry
simply by the neglect of reading metrical literature. This is a
sad mistake, inasmuch as the mere reader of prose cuts himself
off from the very highest literary enjoyments; for, if the giv-
ing of power to the mind be a characteristic, the most essential
literature is to be found in poetry, especially, if it be such as
English poetry is, the embodiment of the very highest wisdom
and the deepest feelingiof our English race.

4. The neglect of poetical reading is increased by the very
mistaken notion that poetry is a mere luxury of the mind, alien
from the demands of practical life,——-a light and effortless
amusement. This is the prejudice and error of ignorance. For

V look at many of the strong and largely cultivated minds which

We know by biography and their own works, and note how
large and precious an element of strength is their studious love
of poetry. T

5. Where could we ﬁnd a man of more earnest, energetic,
practical cast of character than Arnold ?——eminent as a his-
torian, and in other the gravest departments of thought and
learning, active in the cause of education, zealous in matters of
ecclesiastical, political, or social reform; and, withal, never
suffering the love of poetry to be extinguished in his heart, or
to be crowded out of it, but turning it perpetually to wise uses,
bringing the poetic truths of * Shakspeare and of Wordsworth
to the help of the cause of truth ; his enthusiasm for the poets
breaking forth, when he eXclaims,—“ What‘ a treat it would
be to teach Shakspeare to a good class of young Greeks in
regenerate Athens; to dwell upon him line by line and word
by word, and so to get all his pictures and thoughts leisurely

6. It was no false boast when it was said that “our great
poets have been our best political philosophers ;” nor would it
be to add, that they have been our best moralists. The reader,
then, who, on the one hand, gives himself wholly to visionary
poetic dreamings, is false to his Saxon blood ; and equally false
is he who divorces himself from communion with the poets.’
There is no great philosopher in our language in Whose geniusete
imagination is not an active element; there is no great poet
in whose character the philosophic element does not largely
enter.

7. For the combination of prose and poetic reading, a higher
authority is to - be found than the predominant characteristic
of the Saxonintellect as displayed in ourliterature. In the
One Book, Which, given for the good of all manlzind, is super-
naturally ﬁtted for all phases of humanity and all conditions
of civilization, observe that the large components of it are
history and poetry. How little else is there in the Bible! In
the Old Testament all is chronicle and song, and the high;
Wrought poetry of prophecy. In the New Testament are the
same elements, with this difference, that the actual and the
imaginative are more interpenetrated—narrative and parable,
fact and poetry blended in matchless harmony; and even in
the most argumentative portion of Holy VVrit, the poetic ele-
ment is still present, to be followed by the vision and imagery
of the Apocalypse. ,

8. Such is the unquestioned combination of poetry and
prose in Sacred VVrit—§—the best means, We must believe, for
the universal and perpetual good of man; and, if literature
have, as I have endeavored to prove, a kindred charactei of
an agency to build up our incorporeal being, then does it
follow that we should take this silent Warning from the pages
of Revelation, and combine in -our literary culture the same ele-
ments of the actual and the ideal, or imaginative.

all known what slavery is, and no place of retreat lies behind us

‘ The sea even is insecure when the Roman ﬂeet hovers around.

Thus arms and war, ever coveted by the brave, are now the
only refuge of the cowardly. In former actions in which the
Britons fought with various success against the Romans, ou1
valor was a resource to look to; for we, the noblest of all the
nations, and,on that account, placed in its inmost recesses, un-
used to the spectacle of servitude, had our eyes even inviolate
from its hateful sight.  

2. We, the last of, the earth, and of freedom, iiiilcnown to
fame, have been hitherto defended by our remoteness; nowthe
extreme hliinitslof Britain appear, and the unknown is ever re-
garded as the magniﬁcent. No refuge is behind us; naught
but the’ rocks and the waves, and the deadlier Romans,——men
whose pride you have in vain sought to deprecate by moderation
and subservicnce. The robbers of the globe, when the land
fails, they scour the sea. Is the enemy rich ?.they are avaricious;
is he poor? they are ambitious; the East and the West are un-
able to satia.te their desires. Wezilth and poverty are alike cov-
eted by their rapacity. To carry off, massacre, seize one false

call it peace.

they are carried off by levies to serve elsewhere. Our goods
and fortunes they seize on as tribute, our corn as supplies; our
very bodies and hands they Wear out, amid strife and oontumely,
in fortifying stations in the woods and marshes. Serfs born in
servitude are once bought, and ever after fed by their masters ;
Britain alone daily buys its slavery, daily feeds it. As in fam-
ilies the last slave purchased is often a laughing-stock to the
rest, so we, the last whom they have reduced to slavery, are the
first to be agonized by their contumely, and reserved for de-
struction.

4. We have neither ﬁelds, nor minerals, nor harbors, in work-
ing which we can be employed : the valor and ﬁerceness of the
vanquished are obnoxious to the victors : our very distance and
obscurity, as they render us the safer, make us the more sus-
pected. Laying aside, therefore, all hope of pardon, assume the
courage of men to whom salvation and glory are alike dear.
The Trinobantes, under a female leader, had courage to burn a
colony and storm castles; and, had not their success rendered
them negligent, they would have cast off the yoke. We, un-
touched and unconquered, nursed in freedom, shall we not
show, on the ﬁrst onset, what men Caledonia has nursed in her
bosom? i

5. Do not believe the Romans have the same prowess in war a

as lust in peace. They have grown great on our divisions ; they
know how to turn the vices of men to the glory of their own

will dissolve it, unless you suppose that the Grauls and the Ger-
mans, and, I am ashamed tc say, many of the Britons, who now
lend their blood to a foreign usurpation, and in their hearts are
rather enemies than slaves, can be retained by faith and affec-
tion.

v THE BETTER TIl\IES."1-3'
FRANCES BROWN.
1. “Better times I” said the desolate Chief, as he drained,
From the clear-gushing spring of the cleft,
One cup to the land where his memory remained,
And the friends whom his fortunes had left.
“Better times I” ’tis the hold of each storm—beaten heart,
That hopes against hope as it climbs;
Though the signs of their coming grow faint and depart,
Yet the watch-word is still,———“ Better times 1”

2 The young and the fearless, what temples of trust
They build on- the promise of years !
It may bring them but wrecks, it will bear them to dust,
Yet how radiant the prospect appears 1 _
There are honors to win; there are love-tones to hear;
There are homes beneath leaf—laden limes:
And some in the future may ﬁnd them, but ne’er
VVhat they dreamed of in those “better times!”

3. The patriot believes, though the land of his pride,

' In whose triumphs he trusted, hath found

How wisdom grows feeble, and brothers divide,
When days of disaster abound;

But concord and victory rise to his sight

4 Through the deluge of tears and of crimes;

And he sees his hope’s banner still ﬂoat in the light

Of those future and far “better times!”

4. Our friends-has their love grown forgetful, and far.,
From the hearts that remember them thus?
Let us hear of their weal, it will shine likea star
Through the clouds that close darkly o’er us:

from a small spring in the island of Elba; namely, “ THE BETTER TIMES."

RETURN OF COLUMBUS AFT-ER HIS FIRST VOYAGE.
WILLIAM H. PRESCOTT.
1. In the spring of 1493, while the court was still at Barce-
lona, letters were received from Christopher Columbus, announc-
ing his return to Spain, and the successful achievement of his
great enterprise, by the discovery of land beyond the western
ocean. The delight and astonishment, raised by this intelli-
gence, were proportioned to the skepticism with which his pro-
ject had been originally viewed. The sovereigns were now

filled with a natural impatience to ascertain the extent and
other particulars of the important discovery; and they trans
mitted instant instructions to the admiral to repair to Barcelona,
as soon as he should haveimade the preliminary arrangements
for ﬁll?" further prosecution of his enterprise.

2. The great navigator had succeeded, as is vell known, after
a voyage the natural difficulties of which had been much auge
mented by the distrust and mutinous spirit of his followers, in
descrying land -on Friday, the 12th of October, 1492. After
some months spent in exploring the delightful regions, now for
the ﬁrst time thrown, open to the eyes of a European, he em-
barked in the month of J anuary, #93, for Spain. One of his
vessels had previously foundered, and another had deserted him;
so that he was left alone to retrace his course across the At
lantic. '

3. After a most tempestuous voyage, he Was compelled to
take shelter in the Ta.gus, sorely against his inclination. He
experienced,-, however, the most honorable reception from the
Portuguese. ‘monarch, John, the Second, who did ample justice
to the great qualities of Columbus, although he had failed to
proﬁt by them. After a brief delay, the admiral resumed his
voyage, and crossing the bar of Saltes, entered the harbor of
Palos about noon, on the 15th of March, 1493 ; being exactly
seven months and eleven. days since his departure from that
port. _

4. Great Was the agitation in the little community of Palos,
as they beheld the well—known vessel of the admiral re-entering
their harbor. Their desponding imaginations had long since
consigned him to a watery grave ; for, in addition to the preter-
natural horrors which hung over the voyage, they had experi-
enced the most stormy and disastrous winter within the recol-
lection of the oldest mariners. Most of them had relatives or
friencls on board. They thronged immediately to the shore, to
assure themselves with their own eyes of the truth of their re-

turn .

.5. VVhen they beheld their faces orce more, and saw them

accompanied by the numerous evidences which they brought
back of the success of the expedition, they burst forth in ac-
clamations of joy and gratulation. They awaited the landing
of Columbus, when the whole population of the place accom-
paniedhim and his crew to the principal church, where solemn
thanksgivings were offered up for their return; while every bell
in the village sent forth a joyous peal in honor of the glorious
event. ,

6. The admiral was too desirous of presenting himself be-
fore the sovereigns, to protract his stay long at Palos.“ He
took with him, on his journey, specimens of the multifarious
products of the newly discovered regions. He was accom-
panied by several of the native islanders, arrayed in their sim-
ple barbaric costume, and decorated, as he passed through the
principal cities, with collars, bracelets, and other ornaments of
gold, rudely fashioned; he exhibited, also, considerable quanti-
ties of the same metal in dust, or in crude masses, numerous
vegetable exotics, possessed of aromatic or medicinal virtue,
and several kinds of quadrupeds unknown in Europe, and
birds whose varieties of gaudy plumage gave a brilliant effect
to the pageant.

7. The admiral’s progress through the country was every
where impeded by the multitudes thronging forth to gaze at
the extraordinary spectacle, -and the more extraordinary man
who, in the emphatic language of that time, which has now lost
its force from its familiarity, ﬁrst revealed the existence of a
“NEW WORLD.” As he passed through the busy, populous city
of Seville, every window, balcony, and house-top, which could
afford a glimpse of him, is described to have been crowded
with spectators. if

i 8. It was the middle of April before Columbus reached Bar-
celona. The nobility and cavaliers in attendance on the court,
together with the authorities of the‘city, came to the gates to
receive him, and escorted him to the royal presence. Ferdinand
and Isabella were seated, with their son, Prince John, under a
superb canopy of state, awaiting his arrival. On his approach,

they rose from their seats, and extending their hands to him to
salute, caused him to be, seated before them. These were un
prececlented marks of condescension to a person of Columbus
rank, in the haughty and ceremonious court of Castile.

9. It Was, indeed, the proudest moment in the life of Colum~
bus, He had fully established the truth of his long-contestet‘
theory, in the face of argument, sophistry, sneer, skepticism, and
contempt." He had achieved this, not by chance, but by calcu-
lation, supported through the most adverse circumstances by
consummate conduct. The honors paid him, which had hitherto
been‘ reserved only for rank, or fortune, or military success,
purchased by the blood and tea.rs of thousands, were, in l11S
case, a homage to intellectual power, successfully exerted in
behalf of the noblest interests of humanity. ,

10. After a brief interval, the sovereigns requested from
Columbus a recital of his adventures. His manner was sedate
and digniﬁed, but warmed by the glow of natural enthusiasm.
He enumerated the several islands which he had visited, expa-
tiated on the temperate character of the climate, and the capa
city of the soil for every variety of agricultural production, ap-
pealing to the samples imported by him as evidence of ‘their
natural fruitfulness. ,

11. He dwelt more at large on the precious metals to be
found in these islands, which he inferred, less from the speci-
mens actually obtained, than from the uniform testimony of the
natives to their abundance in the unexplored regions of the in-
terior. Lastly, he pointed out the wide scope afforded to
Christian zeal, in, the "illumination of  race of men whose
minds, far from being wedded to any system of idolatry, were
prepared by their extreme simplicity for the reception of pure
an-d uncorrupted doctrine. .

12. The last consideration touched Isabella’s heart most sen-
sibly ; and the whole audience, kindled with Various emotions
by the speaker’s eloquence, ﬁlled up the perspective with the
gorgeous coloring of their own fancies, as ambition, or avarice,

THE SCALE OF BEING.
ADDISON.

1. Though there is a great deal’ of pleasure in contemplat-
ing the material world, by which I mean that system of bodies
into which nature has so curiously wrought the mass of dead
matter, with ‘the several relations which those bodies bear to
one another, there is still, methinks, something more wonder-
ful and surprising in contemplations on the world of life, by
which I mean all those animals with which every part of the
universe is furnished. The material world is only the shell of
the universe; the world of life are its inhabitants. E

2. If we consider those parts of the material world which
lie the nearest to us, and are, therefore, subject to our observa-
tions and inquiries, it is amazing to consider the inﬁnity of
animals with which it is stocked. Every part of matter is
peopled, every green leaf swarms with inhabitants. There is
scarce a single humor in the body of man, or of any other an-
imal, in which our glasses do not discover myriads of living
creatures. .
. 3. The surface of animals is, also, covered with other ani-
mals, which are in the same manner the basis of other animals

i that live Jpon ‘it: nay, we ﬁnd in the most solid bodies, as in

m‘arble_itself, innumerable cells and cavities that are crowded
with such imperceptible inhabitants, as are too little for the
nakedeye to discover. On the other hand, if we look into the
more bulky parts of nature, we see the seas, lakes, and rivers

teeming with numberless kinds of living creatures: we find
every mountain and marsh, wilderness and wood, plentifully
stocked with birds and beasts, and every part of matter afford-
ing proper necessaries and conveniences for the livelihood of
the multitudes which -inhabit it.

4. The author of tlie “ Plurality of Wo1*lds” draws a very good
argument from this consideration, for the peopling of every
planet: as, indeed, it seems very probable, from the analogy
of reason, that, if no part of matter, which We a1'e acquainted
with, lies waste and useless, those great bodies, which are at
such a distance from us, should not be desert and unpeopled,
but rather that they should be furnished with beings adapted
to their respective situations. V ‘

5. Existence is a blessing to those beings only which are
endowed with perception, and is in a manner thrown away
upon dead matter, any further than as it is subservient to be-
ings which are conscious of their existence. Accordingly, we
ﬁnd, from the bodies which lie under our observation, that mat-
ter is only made as the basis and support of animals, and that
there is no more of the one than what is necessary for'the ex-
istence of the other.

6. Inﬁnite goodness is of so communicative a nature, that
at seems to delight in the conferring of existence upon every
degree of ‘perceptive being. As this is a speculation which I
have often pursued‘ with great pleasure to myself, I shall en-
large further upon it, by considering that part of the scale of
beings which comes within our knowledge.

7. There are some living creatures which are raised but just
above dead matter. To mention only that species of shell—ﬁsh
which are formed in the fashion of a cone, that grow to the
surface of several rocks, and immediately die upon their being
severed from the place where they grow. There are many
other creatures but one remove from these, which have no
other sense, besides that of feeling and taste. Others have
still an additional one of hearing; others of smell, and others
of sight.

8. It is wonderful to observe, by what a gradual p“og”ress
the world of life advances through a prodigious variety of
species, before a creature is formed that is complete in all its
senses; and even among these there is such a different de-
gree of perfection in the sense which one animal enjoys lieyond
What appears in another, that, though the sense in different
animals be distinguished by the same common denomination,
it seems almost of a different nature. ,

9. If, after this, We look into the several inward Ptrfcctions

of cunning and sagacity, or what We generally call instinct,‘

vve ﬁnd them rising after the same manner imperceptibly one

a above another, and receiving additional improvements, accord- _

ing to the species in which they are implanted. This progress
in nature is so very gradual, that the most perfect of an infe-
rior species comes very near to the most imperfect of that
which is immediately above it. -

10. The exuberant and overﬂowing goodness of the Supreme
Being Whose mercy extends to all his Works, is plainly seen,
as I have before hinted, from his having made so very little
matter, at least, what falls Within our knowledge, that does not
swarm with life ; nor is his goodness less seen in the diversity
than in the multitude of living creatures. Had he only made
one species of animals, none of the rest would have enjoyed
the happiness of existence: he has, therefore, specified in his
creation every degree of life, every capacity of being.

11. The whole chasm of nature, from a plant to a man, is
ﬁlled up with diverse kinds of creatures, rising one over an-
other, by such a gentle and easy ascent, that the little transi-
tions and deviations from one species to another are almost
insensible. This intermediate space is so well husbanded and
managed, that there is scarce a degree of perception which
does not appear in some one part of the world of life. Is the
goodness, or the wisdom of the Divine Being, more manifested in
this his proceeding ? p .

12. There is a consequence, besides those "I have a.lready
mentioned, which seems very naturally deducible from the fore-

going considerations. If the -scale of being rises by such a
regular progress so high as man, we "may, by a parity of rea-
son, suppose that it still proceeds gradually through those be-
ings which are of a superior nature to him; since there is an
inﬁnitely greater space and room for different degrees of per-
fection between the Supreme Being and man, than between
man and the most despicable insect.

13. In this system of being there is no creature so wonder-'
ful in its nature, and which so much deserves our particular
attention,_as MAN, Who ﬁlls up the middle space between the
animal and intellectuahnature, the visible and invisible world,
and is that link in the chain of beings,which has been often
termed the connection of both worlds. So that he who in one
respect is associated with angels and archangels, and may look
upon a being of inﬁnite perfection as his Father, and the highest
order of spirits as his brethren, may, in another respect, "say to
corruption : “Thou art my father; and to the worm, thou art
my mother and my sister.” I

APPEAL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
JOHN JAY.

1. Under the auspices and direction of Divine Providence,

your forefathers removed to the wilds and .wilderness of Amer- _

ica. By their industry, they made it a fruitful, and by their vir-
tue, a happy country. And we should still have enjoyed the
blessings of peace and plenty, if we had not forgotten the
source from which these blessings ﬂowed, and permitted our
country to be contaminated by the many shameful vices which
have prevailed among us.

2. It is a well-known truth that no virtuous people were
ever oppressed; and it is, also, true, that a scourge was never
wanting to those of an opposite character. Even the Jews,

those favorites of Heaven, met with the frowns, whenever they
forgot the smiles, of their benevolent Creator. By tyrants of
Egypt, of Babylon, of Syria, and of Rome, they were severely
chastised; and those tyrants themselves, when they had exe-
cuted the vengeance of Almighty God, their own crimes burst-
ing on their own heads, received the rewards justly due to their
violation of the sacred rights of mankind.

3. You were born equally free with the Jews, and have as
good a right to be exempted from the arbitrary domination
of Britain, as they had from the invasions of Egypt, Babylon,

Syria, or Rome. But they, for their wickedness, were per-

mitted to be scourged by the latter ; and we, forour wicked-
ness, are soourged by tyrants as cruel and implacable as those.
Our case, however, is peculiarly distinguished from theirs.
Their enemies were strangers, unenlightened, and bound to
them by no ties of gratitude or consanguinity. Our enemies,
on the contrary, call themselves Christians. They are of a na-
tion and people bound to us by the strongest ties. B

’ 4. You may be told that yourforts have been taken; your
country ravaged; and that your armies have retreated; and
that, therefore, God is not with you. It is true that some
forts have been taken, that our country hath been ravaged,
and that our Maker is displeased with us. But it is, also, true,
that the King of Heaven is not, like the king of Britain, im-
placable.. If we turn from our sins, He will turn from his an-
ger. Then will our arms be crowned with success, and the
pride and power of our enemies, like the arrogance and pride
of N ebuchadnezzar, will vanish away. .

5.. Let a general reformation of manners take place,-—let
nniversal charity, public spirit, and private virtue be inculcated,
encouraged, a.nd practiced. Unite in preparing for a vigorous
defense of your country, ‘as if all depended on your own exer-
tions. And, when you have done all things, then rely upon the
good. providence of Almighty God for success, in full conﬁdence
that without his blessing, all our efforts will inevitably fail.

rod of iron : freedom is now in your power : value the heavenly
gift: remember that, if you dare to neglect or despise it,you

by Hannibal, that imperial city was besieged by this brave
and experienced general, at the head of a numerous and vic-
torious army. But, so far Were her glorious citizens from be-
ing dismayed by the loss of so many battles, and of all their
country,—so conﬁdent-were they in their own virtue‘ and the
protection of Heaven, that the very land on which the Cartha-
ginians were encamped, was sold at public auction for more
than the usual price.

7. These heroic citizens disdained to receive his protection,
or to regard his proclamations. They invoked the protection

‘of the Supreme Being; they bravely defended their city with

undaunted courage; they repelled the enemy and recovered
their country. Blush, then, ye degenerate spirits who give all
over for lost, because your enemies have marched through
three or four counties in this and a neighboring State,——ye
who basely ﬂy to have the yoke of slavery ﬁxed on your necks,
and to swear that you and your children shall be slaves for-
ever. - A

8. Rouse, brave citizens! Do your duty like men ; and be
persuaded that ‘Divine Providence will not permit this western
world to be involved in the horrors of slavery. Consider that
from the earliest ages of the World, religion, liberty, and reason
have been bending their course toward the setting sun. The
holy Gospels are yet to be preached in these western regions ;
and We have the highest reasons to believe that the Almigdty
Will not suffer slavery and the Gospel to go hand in hand. It
can not,——it will not be. i

neither the injuries they have received, the prize they are con-
tending for, the future blessings or curses of their cl1ildren,—-—
the applause or reproach of all mankind,—-—the approbation or

consequent upon their conduct, in this and a future state, can
move them,-—then let them be assured that they deserve to
be slaves, and are entitled to nothing but anguish and tribu-
lation.

10. Let them banish from their remembrance the reputation,
the freedom, and the happiness they have inherited from their
forefathers. Let them forget every duty, human and divine;
remember not that they have children ; and beware how they
call to mind the justice of the Supreme Being; let them go

It was a starry night in June; the air was soft and still,
When the “ minute-men” from Cambridge came, and gathered on the hill
Beneath us lay the sleeping town, around us frowned the ﬂeet,
But the pulse of freemen, not of slaves, within our bosoms beat;
And every heart rose high with hope, as fearlessly We said,-

But stack our guns, then fall to work, with mattock and with spade,

So still were we, the stars beneath, that scarce a whisper fell;

We heard the red-coat’s musket click, and heard him cry,——“Al1 ’s well

In many a wavy shadow showed their sullen guns asleep.

No striplings we, but bear the arms that held the French in check,

The drum that beat at Louisburg, and thundered in Quebec!

INDUSTRY AND GENIUS.
HENRY WARD BEECHER.
1. Industry is asubstitute for genius. Where one or more
faculties exist in the highest state of development and activity,
--as the faculty ‘of music in Mozart,—invention in Fulton,-—

rideality in Milton_,—-we call their possessor a genius. But a

geni_us is usually understood to be a creature of such rare facil-
ity of mind, that he can do any thing without labor. Accord~
ing to the popular notion, he learns without study, and knows
Without learning. He is eloquent without preparation, exact
without calculation, and profound without reﬂection.

2. VVhile ordinary men toil for knowledge by reading, by
comparison, and by minute research, a genius is supposed to
receive it as the mind receives dreams. His mind is like a vast
cathedral, through whose colored windows the sunlight streams,
painting the aisles with the varied colors of brilliant pictures.
Such minds may exist. So far as my observations have ascer-
tained the species, they abound in academies, colleges, and Thes-
pian societies; in_village debating clubs; in coteries of young
artists, and among young professional aspirants. They are to
be known by a reserved air, excessive sensitiveness, and utter
indolence; by very long hair, and veryopen shirt collars; by
the reading of much wretched poetry, and the writing of much

yet more wretched; by being very conceited, very affected,

very disagreeable, and very useless,—-beings whom no man
wants for friend, pupil, or companion.

IM MORTALITY.
GEORGE D.'PRENTICE.

It can not be, that earth is man’s only abiding place. It
can not be that our life is a bubble, cast up by the ocean of
eternity, to ﬂoat another moment upon. its surface, and then sink
into nothingness and darkness forever. Else why is it that the
high and glorious aspirations which leap like ‘angels from the
temple of our hearts, are forever wandering abroad, unsatisﬁed?
‘Why is it that the rainbow and the cloud come over us with a
beauty that is not of earth, and then pass off and leave us to
muse on their faded loveliness? Why is it that the stars, which

hold their festival around the midnight throne, are set above _

the grasp of our limited faculties, and forever mocking us with
their unapproachable glory? And, ﬁnally, why is it that bright
forms of human beauty are presented to the view, and then
taken from us, leaving the thousand streams of the affections
to ﬂow back in an Alpine torrent upon our hearts? We are
born for a higher destiny than that of earth. There is a realm
where the rainbow never fades; Where the stars will be spread
out before us like the islands that slumber on the ‘ocean; and
where the beautiful beings, that here pass before us like visions.
Will stay in our presence forever.

grateful, and other heavens as gay? Why’ does the soul of
man ever cling to that earth where it first knew pleasure and
pain, and, under the rough discipline of the passions, was
roused to the dignity of moral life? Is it only that our coun-
try contains our kindred and our friends? And is it nothing
but a name for our social affections? It can not be this; the
most friendless of human beings has a country which he admires
and extols, and which he would,'in the same circumstances,
prefer to all others under heaven. Tempt him with the fairest
face of nature, place him by living waters under shadowy trees
of Lebanon, open to his view all the gorgeous allurements of
the climates of the sun, he will love the rocks and deserts of
his childhood better than all these, and thou canst not bribe his
soul to forget the land of his nativity; he will sit down and
weep by the waters of Babylon, when he remembers thee, oh

WORKS OF IMAGINATION NOT LIKELY TO DECLINE.
T. NOON TALFOURD.

1. There is a deep-rooted opinion which has been eloquently
propounded by some of the ﬁrst critics of our age, that works
of -imagination must necessarily decline as civilization advances.
It will readily be conceded, that no individua.l minds can be
expected to arise, in the most reﬁned periods, which will sur-
pass those which have been developed in rude and barbarous
ages. But there does not appear any solid reason for believing
that the mighty works of old time occupy the whole region of
poetry, or necessarily chill the fancy of these later times by
their vast and unbroken shadows.

2. Genius does not depend on times or on seasons, it waits
not on external circumstances, it can neither be subdued by the
violence of the most savage means, nor polishe.:l away or dissi-

pated among the reﬁnements of the most glittering scenes of

artiﬁcial life. It is “itself alone.” To the heart of a young
poet,’ the world is ever beginning anew. He is in the genera-
tion by which he is surrounded, but he is not of it; he can
live in the light of the holiest times, or range amid gorgeous
marvels of eldest superstition, or sit “lone upon the shores of
old romance,” or pierce the vail of rnortality, and “breathe in
worlds to which theheaven of heavens is but a vail.”

8. The very deﬁciency of the romantic, in the actual paths
of existence, will cause him to dwell in thought more apart
from them, and toseek the wildest recesses in those regio':.s
which imagination opens to his inward gaze. To the eye of
young joy, the earth is as fresh as at the ﬁrst,—-—~the dew—drop
is lit up as it was in Eden,——and “ the ‘splendor in the grass,
the glory in the ﬂower,” yet glitters as in the spring time of
the world. ,

4. The subjects in which genius rejoices, are not the vain
and the transitory, but the true and the eternal, which are the

HIGH sonoor READER. 298

A

same through all changes of society and shifting varieties of
fashion. The heavens yet “tell the glory of God ;” the hills,
the Vales, and the ocean, do not alter, nor does the heart of
man wax ‘old. The wonders of these are as exhaustless as they
are lasting. VVhile these remain, the circumstances of busy life,
——the exact mechanism of the social state,—will affect the true
poet but little. '

5. The seeds of genius which contain within themselves the
germs of expanded beauties and divinest sublimities, can not
perish. VVheresoever they are scattered, they must take root,
striking far below the surface, overcropped and exhausted by
the multitude of transitory productions, into a deep richness of
soil, and, rising up above the weeds and tangled underwood
which would crush them, lift their innumerable boughs into
the free and rejoicing heavens.

, 6. The advancement of natural science and of moral truth
do not tend really to lessen the resources of the bard. The
more we know, the more we feel there is yet to be known. The
mysteries of nature and of humanity are not lessened, but in-
creased, by the discoveries of philosophic skill. The luster
which breaks on the vast clouds, which encircle us in our
earthly condition, does not merely set in clear vision that which
before was hidden in sacred gloom; but, at the same time,
half exhibits masses of magniﬁcent shadow, unknown before,
and casts an uncertain light. on vast regions in which the im-
agination may devoutly expatiate.

7. A plastic superstition may ﬁll a limited circle with beau»
tiful images, but it chills and conﬁnes the fancy, almost as
strictly as it limits the reasoning faculties. The mythology of
Greece, for example, while it peopled earth with a thousand
glorious shapes, shut out the free grace of nature from poetic
vision, and excluded from the ken the high neatings of the
soul. All the loveliness of creation, and all the qualities, feel-
ings, and passions, were invested with personal attributes.

8. The evening’s sigh was the breath of Zephyr,--thestreams
were celebrated, not in their rural clcarness, but as .visionary

A

nymphS,——and ocean, that old agitator of sublimest thoughts,
gave place, in the imagination, to a trident—bearing god. The
tragic muse almost “ forgot herself to stone,” in her lone con-
templations of destiny. N 0 wild excursiveness of fancy marked
their lighter poems——no majestical struggle of high passions
and high actions ﬁlled the scene——-no genial wisdom threw a
penetrating, yet lovely, light on the silent recesses of the bo-
som. '

9, The diffusion of a purer faith restored to poetry its glo v-
ing aﬁ"ections, its far-searching intelligence, and its exeursive
power. And not only this, but it left it free to use those ex-
quisite ﬁgures, and to avail itself of all the chaste and delicate
imagery which the exploded superstition first called into being.
In the stately regions of imagination, the wonders of Greek fa-
ble yet.have place, though they no longer hide from our view
the secrets of our nature, or the long vistas which extend to
the dim verge of the moral horizon.

10. VVell, indeed, does a great living poet assert their po
etic existence, under the form of defending the science of the
stars :

“ For Fable is Love’s world, his home, his birth-place;
Delightedly dwells he ’rnong fays, a11d talismans,
And spirits; and delightedly believes
Divinities, being himself divine.

The intelligible forms of ancient poets,

The fair humanities of old religion,

The power, the beauty, and the majesty,

That had their haunts in dale or piny mountain,

' Or forest, by slow stream or pebbly spring, ‘
Or chasms and watery depths! all these have vanished '
They live no longer in the faith of reason!

But still the heart doth need a language, still
Doth the old instinct bring back the old names;
Andto yon starry world they now are gone,.
Spirits or gods, that used to share this earth
With man as with their friend; and to the lover
Yonder they move, from yonder visible sky

Shoot inﬂuence down; and, even at this day,
. ’Tis Jupiter who brings vvhate’er is great,

11... The poet is the inheritor of the imaginative treasures of
all creeds which reason has now exploded. Thedim gigantic
shadows of the north,——the gentle superstitions of the Greeks,
-——the Wild and wondrous prodigies of the Arabian enchant-
ment,—-the dark rites of magic, more heart-stirring than all,— -
have their places in the vast region of his soul. when we
climb above the ﬂoating mists which have so long overspread
humanity, to breathe a purer air, and gaze on the. unclouded
heavens, we do not lose our feeling of veneration for majestic
errors, nor our sense of their glories. Instead of wandering in
the region of cloud, We overlook it all, and behold its gorgeous
varieties of arch, minaret, dome, or spire, Without partaking in
its delusions. ‘

UNIVERSAL INTELLIGENCE.

1. In the great cycle of human affairs there are many stages,
each essential to the consummation of the designs of Providence,
and each separated by broad distinctions from the rest. They
whose province it is to censure, and they whose desire it is to im-
prove their age, will never ﬁnd their sacred ﬁres extinct from
the mere Want of fuel. History and theory are always at hand
with humiliating contrasts to the times we live in.

2. That men have been better or might be better than they
are, has been true since the first fathers of our race returned to
their native dust, and will still be true as long as our planet
shall be inhabited by their descendants. But below the agitated

3. Laws as anomalous in appearance, as uniform in reality, as

neither pious nor rational to suppose that this consummation
can be attained by any sequence of identical causes constantly

4. The best generations, like the best men, are those which

"splendid biographies constitutes the history of past centuries.

7. But "is it better that the thirst of a whole nation should
be thus slaked, or that the immortals should be quaﬁng their

There is no immediate and practicable reconcilement of these
advantages. Genius, and wit, and science, and whatever else,
raises man above his fellows, must bend to the universal moa-
tives of human conduct. When honor, wealth, public grati-
tude, and the sense of good desert, reward those who teach ele-
mentary truth to the people at large, the wisest and the best
will devote to that office powers, which, in a _diﬁ‘erent age,
would have been consecrated to more splendid, though not, per«
haps, to more worthy undertakings. L

8. In the state of letters, there is no maintaining a polity
in which the three elements of power are blended together in
harmonious counterpoise. There a monarch infallibly becomes
a despot, and a democracy subjugates to itself whatever else is
eminent, or illustrious. Divines, poets, and philosophers, ad-
dressing millions of readers and myriads of critics, are imme-
diately rewarded by an applause, or punished by a neglect, to
which 't is not given to mortal man to be superior or indil’
ferent. _

9. Inform the national mind, and improve the general taste
up to a certain point, and to that point you inevitably depress
the efforts of those who are born to instruct the rest. Had
Spenser ﬂourished in the nineteenth century, would he have as
pired to produce the Faéry Queen? Had Walte1'Scott lived
in the sixteenth, would he have condescended to write the Lady
of the Lake? Our great men are less great; because our arch»
nary men are less abject. ‘

the safe ordering of his steps, no mere human agency can be

the Volumes of the historian, like lamps, to guide our feet;
there stand the heroic patterns of courage, magnanimity, and
self-denying virtue ;——-there are embodied the gentler attributes,
which soften and purify, while they charm the heart ;~——there
lie the charts of those who have explored the deeps and shallows
of the soul ;-——there the dear—bought testimony which reveals to
us the ends of the earth, and shows that the girdle of the Wa-
ters is nothing but their Mal:er’s will ;—-there stands the Poet’s
harp of mighty compass, and many strings;——there hang the
deep-toned instruments through which patriot eloquence has
poured its inspiring echoes over oppressed nations ;——there, in
the sanctity of their own self-emitted light, repose the Heavenly
Oracles. E» This glorious fane, vast, and‘ full of Wonders, has been

v;i.thout tastes or intellectual light to guide it to any avenue of
escape, it gropes round its conﬁnes of clay, with the sensations
ofa caged wild beast. It riseth up, it moveth to and fro,’ it

evening!” in-the evening it cries,-——-“VVould God it were morn-

den for action, it grows desperate and its vision becomes perverted.

discipline and enlarged teaching might have early opened the
interesting spectacle of man’s past and prospective destiny. In-
stead of 1anguishing,——his mind might have throbbed and

triumphs, of men and nations,-—-breathed upon by the life-
giving lips of the patriot, he might have discovered that he had,
not only a country to love, but a head and a heart to serve
her,—-—going out with Science, in her researches through the
universe, he might have found, amid the secrets of Nature, ever-
growing food for reﬂecticin and delight, ——ascending where the
Muses sit, he might have gazed on transporting scenes, and

_ transﬁgured beings, and snatched, through heaven’s half-

unfolded portals, glimpses unutterable of things beyond.

Zeno’s were vain, vain Epicurus’ schemes,
Their systems false, delusive were their dreams;
Unskilled by twofold nature to divide,

One nursed my pleasure, and one nursed my pride :

Those jarring truths which human art beguile,
Thy sacred page thus bids me reconcile.” ’

Offspring of God, no less thy pedigree,
Wliat thou once wert, art now, and still may be,
Thy God alone can tell, alone decree;

-Faultless thou dropp’dst from his unerring skill,

With the bare power to sin, since free of will :
Yet charge not with thy guilt his bounteous love,
For who has power to walk has power to rove:
Who acts by force impelled, can naught deserve ,
.And wisdom short of inﬁnite may swerve.

I 1. Borne on thy new-imped wings, thou took’st thy ﬂight,

Left thy Creator, and the realms of light;

Disdained His gentle precept to fulﬁll

And thought to grow a god by doing ill :

Though by foul guilt thy heavenly form defaced,

In nature changed, from happy mansions chased,

Thou still retain’st some sparks of heavenly ﬁre,

Too faint to mount, yet restless to aspire;

Angel enough to seek thy bliss again,

And brute enough to make thy search in vain.

12. The creatures now withdraw their kindly use,
Some ﬂy thee, some torment, and some seduce ;
Repast ill suited to such different guests,
For what thy sense desires, thy soul distastes;
Thy lust, thy curiosity, thy pride,
Curbed, or deferred, or balked, or gratiﬁed,
Rage on, and make thee equally unblessed,
In what thou want’st, and ‘what thou hast possessed.

13 In vain thou hop’st for bliss on this poor clod,
Return, and seek thy Father, and thy God:
Yet think not to regain thy native sky,

Borne on the wings of vain philosophy;
Mysterious passage I hid from human eyes ;
Soaring you ’ll sink, and sinking you will rise :
Let humble thoughts thy wary footsteps guide,
Regain by meekness what you lost by pride.

to glisten, as if weeping the dews of evening. I knew not the
name of one single star. But what of that ? It is not neces-
sary to be an astronomer, to contemplate with sublime emo-
tions the glories of the sky at night, and the countless wonders
of the universe.

‘ “These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights,
That give a name to every ﬁxed star,
Have no more proﬁt of their shining nights,
Than those that walk and wot not what they are.”

2. Men may be too wise to wonder at any thing; as they
may he too ignorant to see any thing without wondering.
There is reason, also, to believe, that astronomers may be some-
times so taken up with measuring the distances and magnitude
of the stars, as to lose, in the intense minuteness of calculation,
that noble expansion of feeling and intellect combined, which
lifts from nature up to its great ﬁrst Cause.

3. As respects myself, I know no more of the planets than
the man in the moon. I only contemplate them as unap-
nroachable, unextinguishable ﬁres, glittering afar off, in those
mZ111'8 ﬁelds whose beauty and splendor have pointed them out
as the abode of the Divinity ; as such, they form bright links
in the chain of thought that leads directly to a contemplation
of the Maker of heaven and earth. ’

4. Nature is, indeed, the only temple worthy of the Deity.
There is a mute eloquence in her smile; a majestic severity
in her frown; a divine charm in her harmony; a speechless
energy in her silence ; a voice in her thunders, that no reﬂect-
ing being can resist. It is in such scenes and seasons, that
the heart is deepest smitten with the power and goodness of
Providence, and that the soul demonstrates its capacity for
maintaining its existence independent of matter, by abstracting
itself from the body, and expatiating alone in the boundless re»
gions of the past and the future.

5. As I continued strolling forward, there gradually came a
perfect calm,-———and even the aspen-tree whispered no more. But

it was not the deatlilike calm of a winter’s night, when the
northwest wind grows quiet, and the frosts begin in silence to
forge fetters for the running brooks, and the gentle turrent of
life, that flows through the veins of the forest. The voice of
man and beast was, indeed, unheard ; but the river murn1ured,
and the insects chirped in the mild summer evening.

6. There is something sepulchral in the repose of a winter
night; but, in the genial seasons of the year, though the nigh
is the emblem of repose, it is the repose of the couch, not of
the tomb,——nature still breathes in the buzz of insects, the
whisperings of the forests, and the murmurs of the running
brooks. VVe know she will awake in the morning, with her
smiles, her bloom, her zephyrs, and warbling birds. “ In such
a night as this,” if a man loves any human being in this
wide world, he will find it out, for there will his thoughts first
center. i

7. If he has in store any sweet, or bitter, or bitter-sweet
recollections, which are lost in the bustle of the world, they

will come without being called. If, in his boyish days, he‘
wrestled, and wrangled, and rambled with, yet loved, some.

chubby boy, he will remember the days of his childhood, its
companions, cares and pleasures. If, in his days of romance,
he used to wa.lk of evenings, with some blue-eyed, musing,
melancholy maid, whom the ever-rolling wave of life dashed
away from him forever,-—he will recall her voice, her eye, and
her form. A _

8. If any heavy and severe disaster has fallen on his riper
manhood, and turned the future into a gloomy and unpromisu
ing wilderness,—he‘will feel it bitterly at such a time. Or, if
it chance that he is grown an old man, and lived to see all
that owned his blood, or shared his affections, struck down to
the earth like dead leaves in autumn,———in such a night, he
will call their dear shades around, and wish himself a shadow.

THE LOVE OF NATURE.
, DR. BEATTIE.

1. Itis strange to observe the callousness of some men before
Whom all the glories of heaven and earth pass in daily succes-
sion, without touching their hearts, elevating their fancy, or
leaving any durable remembrance. Even of those who pretend
to sensibility, how many are there to whom the luster of the
rising or setting sun, the sparkling concave of the midnight sky,
the mountain forest, tossing and roaring to the storm, or War-
bling with all the melodies of a summer evening; the sweet in-
terchange of hill and dale, shade and sunshine, grove, lawn, and
Water, which an extensive landscape offers to the view; the
scenery of the ocean, so lovely, so majestic, and so tremendous,
and the many pleasing varieties of the animal and vegetable
kingdom, could never afford so much real satisfaction as the
steams and noise of a ball-room, the insipid ﬁddling and squeak-
ing of an opera, or the vexations and Wranglings of a card-
table !

2. But some minds there are of a different make, Who, even
in the early part of life, receive from the contemplation of na-
ture a species of delight which they would hardly exchange for
any other; and who, as avarice and ambition are not the in-
ﬁrmities of that period, would, with equalsincerity and rapture,
exclaim,-—

“I care not, Fortune, What you me deny;
You can not rob me of free nature’s grace,
You can not shut the Windows of the sky,’
Through Which Aurora shows her brightening face ;

You can not bar my constant feet to trace
« The Woods and lawns by living stream at eve.”

3. Such minds have alvvays in them the seeds of true tasts ,
and frequently of imitative genius. At least, though their en-
thusiastio or visionary turn of mind, as the man of the World

HIGH scnoor. READER. 809

would call. it, should not always incline them to practice poetry or
painting, we need" not scruple to afﬁrm that, without some portion
of this enthusiasm, no person ever became a true poet or painter.
For he who would imitate the works of nature, must ﬁrst ac-
curately observe them, and accurate observation is to be ex-
pected from those only who take great pleasure in it.

4. To a mind thus disposed, no part of creation is indifferent.

In the crowded city and howling wilderness, in the cultivated_

province and solitary isle, in the ﬂowery lawn and craggy mount-
ain, in the murmur of the rivulet and in the uproar of the
ocean, in the radiance of summer and gloom of winter, in the
thunder of heaven and in the whisper of the breeze, he still ﬁnds
something to rouse or to soothe his imagination, to draw forth
his affections, or to employ his understanding. And from every
mental energy that is not attended with pain, -and even from
some of those that are, as moderate terror and pity, a sound
mind derives satisfaction: exercise being equally necessary to
the body and the soul, and to both equally productive of health
and pleasure.

5. This happy sensibility to the beauties of nature should be
cherished in young persons. It engages them to contemplate
the Creator in his wonderful works; it puriﬁes and harmonizes
the soul, and prepares it for moral and intellectual discipline ;
it supplies a never-failing source of amusement; it contributes
even to bodily health; and, as a strict analogy subsists between

material and moral beauty, it leads the heart by« an easy tran-

sition from the one to the other, and thus. recommends virtue
for its transcendent loveliness, and makes vice appear the object
of contempt and abomination.

6. But not to insist longer on those ardent emotions that are
peculiar to the enthusiastic disciple of nature, may it not be af-
ﬁrmed of all men without exception, or at least of all the en-
lightened part of mankind, that they are gratiﬁed by the con-
templation of things natural as opposed to unnatural ? Monstrous
sights please but for a moment, if they please at all; for they
derive their charm from the beholder’s amazement, which is

quickly over. I have read, indeed, of a man of rank in Sicily
who chooses to adorn his villa with pictures and statues of most
unn_atural deformity ; but it is a singular instance; and one
would not be much more surprised to hear of a person living
without food, or growing {at by the use of poison. To say of
any thing that it is contra.ry to nature, denotes censure and dis-
gust on the part of the speaker; as the epithet natural intimates

an agreeable quality, and seems for the most part to imply that

a thing is as it ought to be, suitable to our own taste, and con-
genial with our own constitution. V ‘

7. Think with what sentiments we should peruse a poem in
which nature was totally misrepresented, and principles of
thought and of operation supposed to take’ place repugnant to
every thing we had seen or heard of; in which, for exainple,
avarice and coldness were ascribed to youth, and prodigalitv
and passionate attachment to the old ; in which men were made
to act at random, sometimes according to character, a.nd some-
times contrary to it; in which cruelty and envy were product-
ive of love, and beneﬁcence and kind affection of hatred; in
which beauty was invariably the object of dislike, and ugliness
of desire ; in which society was rendered happy by atheism and
the promiscuous perpetrati on of crimes, and ustice and fortitude
were held in universal contempt.

8. Or think how we should relish a painting where no regard
was had to the proportions, colors, or any of the physical laws
of nature ; where the ears and eyes of animals were placed in
their should rs; where the sky was green and the grass crimson;
where trees -grew with their branches in the earth, and their
roots in the air; where men were seen ﬁghting after their heads
were cut off, ships sailing on the land, lions entangled in cob-=
webs, sheep preying on d.ead carcasses, ﬁshes sporting in the
woods, and elephants walking on the sea. Could such ﬁgures
and combinations give pleasure, or merit the appellation of sub-
lime or beautiful ? Should we hesitate to pronounce their author
mad? And are the absurdities of madmen proper subjects
either of amusement or of imitation to reasonable beings?

VALEDICTORY ADDRESS TO THE SENATE.

r HENRY CLAY.

1. From 1806, the period of my entrance upon this noble
theater, with short intervals, to the present time, I have been
engaged in the public c_ouncils, at home or abroad. Of the
services rendered during that long and arduous period of my
life it does not become me to speak; history, if she deign to
notice me, and posterity, if the recollection of my humble ac-
tions shall be transmitted to posterity, are the best, the truest,
and the most impartial judges. When death has closed the
scene, their sentence will be pronounced, and to that I commit
myself.

2. My public conduct is a fair subject for the criticism, and
judgment of my fellow-men ‘; but the motives by which I have
been prompted are known only to the great Searcher of the hu-
man heart éind to myself; and I trust I may be pardoned for
repeating a declaration made some thirteen years ago, that,
whatever errors, and doubtless there have been many, may be
discovered in a review of my public service, I can with un-
shaken conﬁdence appeal to that Divine Arbiter for the truth
of the declaration, that I have been influenced by no impure
purpose, no personal motive; have sought no personal aggran-
dizement; but that, in all my public acts, I have had a single
eye directed, and a warm and devoted heart dedicated to what,
in my best judgment, I believed the true interests, the honor,
the union, and the happiness of my country required.

8. During that long period, however, I have not escaped the
fate of other public men, nor failed to incur censure and de—

traction of the bitterest, most unrelenting, and most malig-

nant character; and, though not always insensible to the pain
it was meant to inflict, I have borne it in general with com-
posure, and without disturbance, waiting as I have done, in

perfect and undoubting conﬁdence, for the ultimate triumph of

Justice and of truth, and in the entire persuasion that time
would settle all things as they should be, and that whatever
wrong or injustice I might experience at the hands of man, He
to whom all hearts are ope11 and fully known, would, by the
inscrutable dispensations of His providence, rectify all error,
redress all wrong, and cause ample justice to be done.

4. But I have not, meanwhile, been unsustained. Every-
where throughout the extent of this great continent, I have
had cordial, warm-hearted, faithful, and devoted friends, who
have known me, loved me, and appreciated my motives. To
them, if language were capable of fully expressing my acknowl-
edgments, I would now offer all the return I have the power
to make for their genuine, disinterested, and persevering ﬁdel-
ity and devoted attachment, the feelings and sentiments of a
heart overﬂowing with never-ceasing gratitude. If, however, I
fail in suitable language to express my gratitude to them for all
the kindnessthey have shown me, what ‘shall I say, what can I
say at all commensurate with those feelings “of gratitude with
which I have been inspired by the State whose humble repre-

ssntative and servant I. have been in this chamber?

5. I emigrated from Virginia to the State of Kentucky, now,
nearlyforty-ﬁve years ago ; I went as an orphan boy who had
not yet attained the age of majority; Who had never recog-
nized a father’s smile, nor felt his warm caresses ; poor, penni-
less, without the favor of the great, with an imperfect andineg
lected education, hardly suflicient for the ordinary business and
common pursuits of life; but scarce had I set my foot upon
her generous soil, when I was embraced with parental fond-
ness, caressed as though I had been a favorite child, and patron-
ized with liberal _and unbounded muniﬁcence. .

6. From that period the highest honors of the State have
been freely bestowed upon me; and when, in the darkest hour
of caluniny and detraction, I seemed to be assailed’ by all the
re-st of the world, she interposed her broad and impenetrable
shield, repelled the poisoned shafts that were aimed for my de-
struction, and vindicated my good name from every malignant

and unfounded aspersion. I return with indescribable pleasure
to linger a while longer, and mingle with the warm-hearted and
whole-souled people of that State; and when the last scene
shall forever close upon me, I hope that my earthly remains
will be laid under her green. sod with those of her gallant and
patriotic sons.

7. In the course of a long and arduous public service, espe-
cially during the last eleven years in which I have held a seat
in the Senate, from the same -ardor and enthusiasm of character,
I have no doubt, in the heat of debate, and in an honest en
deavor to maintain my opinions against adverse opinions alike
honestly entertained, as to the best course to be adopted for the
public welfare, I may have often inadvertently and unintention-
ally, in moments of excited debate, made use of language that
has been offensive, and susceptible of injurious interpretation,
toward my brother Senators. If there be any here who retain,
wounded feelings of injury or dissatisfaction, produced on such
occasions, I beg to assure them that I now offer the most am-
ple apology for any departure on my part from the established
rules of parliamentary decorum ‘and courtesy. On the other

'hand,I assure Senators, one and all, without exception and

without reserve, that I retire from this chamber without carry-
ing with me a single feeling of resentment or dissatisfaction to
the Senate or any of its members.

8. I go from this place under the hope that we shall mutu-
ally consign to perpetual oblivion whatever personal collisions
may at any time unfortunately have occurred between us ; and
that our recollections shall dwell in future only on those con-
ﬁicts of mind with mind, these intellectual struggles, those
noble exhibitions of the powers of logic, argument,‘ and elo-
quence, honorable to the Senate and to the nation, in which
each has sought and contended for what he deemed the best
_mode of accomplishing one common object, the interest and
the best happiness of our beloved country. To these thrilling
and delightful scenes, it will be my pleasure and my pride to
look back, on my retirement, with unineasured satisfaction.

suﬁ’er me to express my heartfelt wishes that all the great and
patriotic objects of the wise framers of our Constitution may
be fulﬁlled; that the high destiny designed for it may be fully
answered; and that its deliberations, now and hereafter, may
eventuate in securing the prosperity of our beloved country, in
maintaining its rights and honor abroad, and upholding its in~
terests at home. I retire, I know, at a period of inﬁnite dis-
tress and embarrassment. I wish I could take my leave of you
under more favorable auspices; but, without meaning at this
time to say whether on any, or on whom reproaches for the
sad condition of the.country should fall, I appeal to the Senate
and to the world to bear testimony to my earnest and continued
exertions to avert it, and to the truth that no blame can justly
attach to me. . l

10. May the most precious blessings of Heaven rest upon the

whole Senate and each member of it, and may the labors of -

every one redound to the beneﬁt of the nation and the advance-
ment of his own fame and renown. And, when you shall
retire to the bosom of your constituents, may you receive that
most cheering and gratifying. of all human rewards,-their
cordial greeting of “well done, good and faithful servants.”
And now, Mr. President and Senators, I bid you all a long, a

PARRHASIUS AND THE CAPTIVE.

_ p N. P. WILLIS.
There stood an unsold captive in the mart, '

A gray—haired, and majestical old man,
Chained to a pillar. It was almost night;
And the last seller from his place had gone,
And not a sound was heard but of a dog
Craunching beneath the stall a refuse bone,
Or the dull echo from the pavement ru.ng
As the faint captive changed his weary feet.

’T was evening; and the half-descended sun
Tipped with a golden ﬁre the many domes
Of Athens, and a yellow atmosphere

Lay rich and dusky in the shaded street,
Through which the captive gazed.

3. The golden light into the painter’s room

Streamed richly, and the hidden colors stole
From the dark pictures radiantly forth,

And in the soft and dewy atmosphere,

Like forms and landscapes, magical they lay.
Parrhasius stood, gazing, forgetfully,

Upon his canvas. There Prometheus* lay
Chained to the cold rocks of Mount Caucasus,
The vulture at his Vitals, and the links

-Of the lame Lemnianf festering in his ﬂesh;

THE GENIUS OF WASHINGTON.
E. P. WIIIPPLE.
E. This illustrious man, at once the World’s admiration and
enigma, we are taught by a ﬁne instinct to venerate, and by a
wrong opinion to misjudge. The might of his=’~’i"cl1a1'acter has
taken strong hold upon the feelings of great masses of men;
but, in translating this universal sentiment into an intelligent

form, the intellectual element of’ his wonderful nature is as

much depressed as the moral element. is exalted, and conse-
quently We are apt to misunderstand both. Mediocrity has a
badtrick of idealizing itself in eulogizing him, and drags him
down to its own low level while assuming to lift him to the
skies. ’

2. How many times have We been told that he was not a
man of genius, but a person of “ excellent common sense,” of
“ admirable judgment,” of “rare virtues ;"” and by a constant
repetition of this odious ca.nt, We have nearly succeeded in di-
vorcing comprehension from his sense, insight from his judg
ment, force from his virtues, and life from the man. Accord
ingly, in the panegyric of cold spirits, ‘Nashington disappears
in a cloud of’ co1nmon—places, in the rhodomontade of boiling
patriots he expires in the agonies of rant.

3. Now the sooner this bundle of mediocre talents: and moral

qualities, which its contrivers have the audacity to call George
Wasliington, is hissed out of existence, the better it will be for
the cause of talent, and the cause of morals ; contempt of that
is the beginning of wisdom. He had no genius, it seems. ’ 0
no! genius, we must suppose, is the peculiar and shining at-
tribute of some orator, whose tongue can spout patriotic
speeches, or some versifier, whose muse can “Hail Columbia,”
but not of the man who supported States on his arm, and car~
ricd America in his brain. A

4. The madcap, Charles Townsendf‘ the motion of whose
pyrotechnic mind was like the Whizz of a hundred rockets, is a
man of genius; but George Washirigton, raised up above the
level of even eminent statesmen, and with a nature moving
with the still and orderly celerity of a planet round its sun,-—~
he dwindles, in comparison, into a kind of angelic diince?
Wliat is genius? Is it worth any thing? Is splendid folly
the measure of its inspiration? Is wisdom its base and sum—
mit,——that which it recedes from, or tends toward? And by
what deﬁnition do you award the name to the creator of an
epic, and deny it to the creator of a country ? On what prin-
ciple is it to be lavished on himwho sculptures in perishing

niarble, the image of possible excellence, and withheld from

him who built up Within himself a transcendent character, in-

destructible as the obligations of Duty, and beautiful as hel-

rewards ?

5. Indeed, if, by the genius of action, you mean will enlight-
e ed by intelligence, ‘and intelligence energized by will,-—if
ft ~"ce and insight be its characteristics, and inﬂuence its test,——
at .-1, especially, if great effects suppose a cause proportionably
great, that is, a vital, causative Inind,——-then is ‘Washington
most assuredly a man of genius, and one whom no other
American has equaled in the power of Working morally and
mentally on other minds.

of the American Revolution, and a powerful and persevering opponent
of American claims in the British Parliament.

6. His geirius, it is true, was of a peculiar kind; the genius .

of character, of thought and the objects of thought, solidiﬁed
and concentrated into active faculty. He belongs to that rare
class of men,-rare as Homers and Miltons, rare as Plates
and N ewtons,——who have impressed their characters upon na-
tions without pampering national vices. Such men have na-
tures broad enough to include all the facts of a people’s prac-
tical life, and deep enough to discern the spiritual laws which
underlie, animate, and govern those facts.

7. Washington, in short, had that greatness of character
which is the highest expression and last result of greatness of
mind; for there is no method of building upcharacter except
through mind. Indeed, character like his is not built up, stone
upon stone, precept upon precept, but grows up, through an
actual contact of thought with things,—-the assimilative mind
transmuting the impalpable, but potent spirit of public senti-
ment, and the life of visible facts, and the power of spiritual
laws, into ind. vidual life and power, so that their mighty ener-
gies put on personality, as it were, and act through one cen-
tralizing human will.  

8. This process may not, if you please, make the great phi-
losopher, or the great poet, but it does "make the great man,——
the man in whom thought and judgment seem identical with
volition,——the man whose vital expression is not in words, but
:leeds,—the man whose sublime ideas issue necessarily in sub-
lime acts, not in sublime art. It was because Wasl1ingto11’s
character was thus composed of the inmost substance and
power of facts and principles, that men instinctively’ felt the
perfect reality of his comprehensive manhood. This reality
enforced universal respect, ‘married strength to repose, and
threw into his face that commanding majesty, which made
men of the speculative audacity of Jefferson, and the lucid ge-
nius of Hamilton, recognize, with unwonted meekness, his awful
superiority. s

WASHINGTON AND N.A_1>oL non.
I  J. T. HEADLEY.

1. No one, in tracing the history of our struggle, can deny
that Providence watched over our interests, and gave us the
only man who could have conducted the car of the Revolution
to the goal it ﬁnally reached. Our revolution brought to a
speedy crisis the one that must sooner or later have convulsed
France. One was as much needed as the other, and has been
productive of equal good. But, in tracing the progress of each,
how striking is the contrast between the instruments employed,——
Napoleon rnd VVashington. Heaven and earth are not wider
apart than were their mora. characters, yet both were sent of
Heaven to perform a great work. , V

2. God acts on more enlarged plans than the bigoted and ig-
norant have any conception of, and adapts his instruments to
the work he wishes to accomplish. To effect the regeneration
of a comparatively religious, virtuous, and intelligent people, no
better man could have been selected than VVashington. To
rend asunder the feudal system of Europe, which stretched like
an iron frame-work over the people, and had rusted so long in
its place, that no slow corrosion or steadily wasting powercould
affect its ﬁrmness, there could have been found no better than
Bonaparte.

3. Their missions were as different as their characters. Had
Bonaparte been put in the place of Washington, he would have
overthrown" the Congress, as he did the Directory; and taking
supreme power into his hands, developed the resources, and
kindled the enthusiasm of this country with such astonishing
rapidity, that the war would scarcely have begun ere it was
ended. But a vast and powerful monarchy, instead of a repub~
(ic, would have occupied this continent Had Washington been

‘put in the place of Bonaparte, his transcendent virtues and un-

swerving integrity would not have prevailed against the tyranny

of faction, and a prison would have received him, as it did La
faye't‘t‘e.

4. Both were children of a RGVOIJIE-iOI1,‘bOth rose to the chief
command of the army, and eventually to the head of the nation.
One led his country step by step to freedom and prosperity; the
other arrested at once, and with a strong hand, the earthquake
that was rocking France asunder, and sent it rolling under the
thrones of Europe. The oﬁice of one was to defend and build
up Liberty, that of the other to break down the prison walls in
which it lay a captive, and rend asunder its century-bound
fe-tters. '

5. To suppose that France could have been managed as
America was, by any human hand, shows an ignorance as blind
as it is culpable. That, and every other country of Europe, will
have to pass through successive stages before they can reach
the point at which our Revolution commenced. Here Liberty
needed Virtue and patriotism, as Well as strength,——on the Contia
nent it needed simple power, concentrated and terrible power.
Europe at this day trembles over.that volcano Napoleon kin-
dled, and the next eruption will ﬁnish What he begun. Thus
does Heaven, selecting its own instruments, break up the sys-
tems of oppression men deemed eternal, and out of the power
and ambition, as well as out of the virtues of men, Work the
welfare of our race.

your powers, you must be pretty well acquainted with the
Greek and Latin authors. It is very evident your education
has not been neglected. I am satisﬁed with your hand-writing,
and still more with your understanding. I thank my nephew,
Don Fernando, for having given me such an able young man,
whom I consider a rich acquisition. You transcribe so Well
you must certainly understand grammar. Tell me, ingenuously,
my friend, did you ﬁnd nothing that shocked you in Writing
over the homily I sent you on trial? some neglect, perhaps, in

observations, and, if I Were, I am persuaded the Works of your
Grace would escape my censure. V

- Arch.-——Young man, you are disposed to ﬂatter ; but tell me,
which parts of it did you think the most strikingly beautifiil?

Gil B.———If, where all was excellent, any parts were particu-
larly so, I should say they were the personiﬁcation of Hope,
and the description of a good man’s death.

A7~ck.———I see you have a delicate knowledge of the truly
beautiful. This is what I call having ‘taste and sentiment.
Gil Blas, henceforth give thyself no uneasiness about thy for-
tune; I will take care of that. I love thee, and as a proof of
my affection, I will make thee my conﬁdant: yes, my child,
thou shalt be the repository of my most secret thoughts. Listen

homilies; but I confess my weakness. The honor of being
thought a perfect orator has charmed my imagination; my
performances are thought equally nervous and delicate; but
I would of all things avoid the fault of good authors who
write too long. Wherefore, my dear Gil Blas, one thing that I
exact of thy zeal, is, whenever thou shalt perceive my pen
smack of old age, and my genius ﬂag, don’t fail to advertise
me of it; for I don’t trust to my own judgment, which may be
seduced by self-love. That observation must proceed from a

the same. I look upon you as another Cardinal Ximenes
Whose superior genius, instead of being weakened, seemed to

ﬁrmities of the body often affect the understanding. Irepeat

Gil B.—No, sir, by no means; such works as yours are not
to be criticized; every body is charmed with them. Neverthe-
less, since you have laid your injunctions upon me to be free

1. Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray

Had in her sober livery all things‘ clad;

Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,

They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,
Were slunk, all but the Wakeful nightingale ;
She all night long her amorous descant sung;
Silence was pleased ; now glowed the ﬁrmament
With living sapphires"; Hesperus that led

The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,
Rising in clouded majesty, at length,

Apparent queen, unvailed her peerless light,
And o’er thedark her silver mantle threw.

2. - VVhen Adam thus to Eve: “Fair Consort,th’ hour '
Of night, and all things now retired to rest,
Mind us of like repose, since God hath set
Labor and rest, as day and night, to men
Successive ; and the timely dew of sleep,

Now falling with soft slumberous weight, inclines
Our eyelids ; other creatures all day long

Rove idle, unemployed, and less need rest;

Man hath his daily work of body or mind
Appointed, which declares his dignity,

And the regard of Heaven on all his ways;
Wl'lllG other animals unactive range,

And of their doings God takes no account.

With first approach of light, we must be risen,
And at our pleasant labor, to reform

More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth ;
Those blossoms, also, and those dropping gums
That lie bestrown, unsightly and unsmooth,

Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease ;
Meanwhile, as Nature wills, night bids us rest.”
To whom thus Eve, with perfect beauty adorned:
“My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst,
Unargued, I obey; so God ordains;

God is thy law, thou mine; to know no more

Is woman’s happiest knowledge and her praise.

THE KNIGHT, THE HERMIT, AND THE MAN.
' T. s. ARTHUR.
THE KNIGHT.

 Sir Guy de Montfort was as brave a knight as ever laid
lance in rest, or swung his glittering battle—aX_. He possessed
many noble and generous qualities, but they were obscured,
alasl by the strange thirst for human blood, that marked the
 in which he lived,-—-an age, when “Love your friends, and
Izate your enemies,” had taken the place of—-——“ But I say unto
you, love your enemies; bless them that curse you, do good to
them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use
you and persecute you.” A

2 Ten knights as brave as Sir Guy, and possessing as many
noble and generous qualities, had fallen beneath his superior
strength and skill in arms; and for this, the bright eyes of
beauty looked admiringly upon him,-—-fair lips smiled when he
appeared,-———an(.l minstrels sang of his prowess in ladies’ bower
and festive hall.‘

3. At a great tournament given in honor of -the marriage of
the kin g’s daughter, Sir Guy sent forth his challenge to single and

deadl combat‘ but for two sla ‘s _no one acce )t-ed this challenore ’

althoughiit was three times proclaimed by the herald. On the
third day, a Voung and strange knight rode,’ with vizor down,

into the lists, and accepted the challenge. His slender form, his

carriage, and all that appertained to him, showed him to be
no match for Guy de Montfort,———and so it proved. They met,
and Sir Guy’s lance, at the "ﬁrst tilt, penetrated the corselet of
the brave young knight and entered his heart. As he rolled
upon the ground, his casque ﬂew off, and a shower of ‘sunny
eurls fell over his fair young face and neck.

4. Soon the strange news went thrilling from heart to heart,
that the youthful knight who had kissed the dust beneath the
sharp steel of De Montfort, was a maiden! and none other than
the beautiful, high—spirited Agnes St. Bertrand, ‘whose father
Sir Guy had killed, but a few months before, in a combat to
which he had challenged him.

By order of the king the tournament was suspended, and ram-
pant knights and ladies gay went back to their homes in soberer
mood than when they came forth. ~

5. Alone in his castle, with the grim faces of his ancestors
looking down upon him from the wall, Sir Guy paced‘ to and fro
with hurried steps. The Angel of Mercy ‘was nearer to him
than she had been for years‘, and her whispers were distinctly
heard. Glory and fame were forgotten by the knight,——for self
was forgotten. The question--a strange question for him——
“What good ?” arose in his mind. He had killed St. Ber-
trand,——but why ? To add another leaf to his laurels as a brave
knight. But, was this leaf worth its cost,-—the broken heart of
the fairest and loveliest maiden in the land? nay, more,—-the
life-drops from that broken heart?

6. For the ﬁrst time the ﬂush of triumph was chilled by a re-

membrance of what the ‘triumphhad cost him. Then came a,

shudder, as he thought of the lovely widow who drooped in Arte
Custle,——of the wild pang that snapped the heart—strings of De
Cressy’s bride, when she saw the b-attle—aX go crashing into her
husband’s brain,—-—of the beautiful betrothed of Sir Gilbert de
Marion, now a shrieking maniac,—~of Agnes St. Bertrand I A

'7. As these sad images came up before the knight, his pace
grew more rapid, and his brows upon which large beads of
sweat were standing, were clasped between his hands with a
gesture of agony. ,

“ And "what for all this ?” he murmured. “What for all this?
Am I braver or better for such bloody work ?”

Through the long, night he paced the hall of his castle; but
with day dawn he rode forth alone. The sun arose and set:
the seasons came and went; years passed; but the knight re-
turned not. 7 l ’ T

; ‘THE HERMIT.

8. Far from the busy scenes of life dwelt a pious recluse, who,
in prayer, fasting, and various forms of penance, sought to ﬁnd
repose for his troubled conscience. His food was pulse, and his
drink the pure water that went sparkling in the sunlight past
his hermit-cell in the wilderness. Now and then a traveler who
had lost his way, or an eager hunter in search of game, met
this lonely man in his deep seclusion. To such he spoke elo-
quently of the vanities of life, and of the wisdom of those who,
renouncing these vanities, devote themselves to God ; and they
left him, believing the hermit tobe a wise and happy man.

9. But they erred. Neither prayer nor penance ﬁlled the
aching void that was in his bosom. If he were happy, it was
a happiness for which none . need have felt an envious wish; if
he were wise, his wisdom partook more of the selﬁshness of this
world than of’ the holy benevolence of the next.

10. The days came and went; the seasons changed; years

passed; and still the hermit’s prayers went up at morning, and

the setting sun looked upon his kneeling form. His body was
bent, though not with age ; his long hair whitened, but not with
the snows of many winters. Yet all availed not. The solitary
one found not in prayer and penance that peace which passeth
all understanding.

11. One night he dreamed in his cell that the Angel of
Mercy came to him, and said :— _ I p

“ It is in vain,--all in vain ! Art thou not a man, to whom

power has been given to do good to thy fellow-mar ? Is the
bird on the tree, the beast in his lair, the worm that crawls upon
the earth thy fellow? Not by prayer, not by meditation, not
by penance, is man puriﬁed; not for these are his iniquities
washed out. ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’ These
are the divine words thou hast not yet learned. Thou callest
thyself God’s servant; but where is «thy work? I see it not.
VVhere are the hungry thou hast fed ?—the naked thou hast
clothed ?——the sick and the prisoner who have been visited by
thee. They are not here in the wilderness I”

12. The a.ngel departed, and the hermit awoke. It was mid-
night. From the bending heavens beamed down myriads of
beautiful stars. The dark and solemn woods were still as death,
and there was no sound on the air save the clear music of the
singing rill as it Went on, happily, with its work, even in the
darkness. “ V

13. “ VVhere is my work ?” murmured the hermit, as he stood
with his hot brow uncovered in the cool air. “The stars are
moving in their courses; the trees are spreading forth their
branches and rising to heaven; and the stream ﬂows on to the
ocean‘; but I, superior to all these,———I, gifted with a will, an
understanding and active energies,———am doing no work 1 ‘Well

done, good and faithful servant.’ Those blessed Words can not .

be said of me.”

.14.‘ Morning came, and the hermit saw the bee at its labor,
the bird building its nest, and the worm spinning its silken
thread.

“And is there no work for me, the noblest of all created
things ?” said he.

The hermit knelt in prayer, but found no utterance. ‘Wliere
was his work? He had none to bring but evil work. He had

. harmed his fellow men,-——-but where was the good he had done?

Prayers and penitential deeds wiped away no teal from the eye
of sorro‘w,———fed not the hungry,———clothed not the naked.

15. “De Montfort! it is in vain! there must be charity as
well as piety I”

Thus murmured the hermit, as he arose from his prostrate
attitude. ,

‘When night came, the hermit’s cell, far away in the deep un-
trodden forest, was tenantless. '

THE MAN.

16. A fearful plague raged in a great city. In the narrow
streets where the poor were crowded together, the hot breath
of the pestilence withered up hundreds in a day. Those not
stricken down, ﬂed, and left the suffering and the dying to their
fate. Terror extinguished all human sympathies. I

17. In the midst of ‘these dreadful scenes, a man clad in

plain garments;-—a stranger,——approached the plague-stricken
city. The ﬂying inhabitants warned him of the peril he was
about encountering, but he heeded them not. He entered
within the walls, and took his way with a ﬁrm step to the most
infected regions.

18. In the ﬁrst house that he entered, he found a young
maiden alone, and almost in the agonies of death ; and her feeble
cry was for something to slake her burning thirst. He placed
to her lips a cool draught of which she drank eagerly ; then he
sat down to watch by her side. In a little _while the hot fever

began to abate, and the sufferer slept. Then he lifted her in

his arms, and bore her beyond the city walls, where the air was
purer, and where were those appointed to receive and minister

_to the sick who were brough. forth.

19. Again he went into the deadly atmosphere, and among
the sick and the dying; and soon he returned once more, with a

sleeping infant that he had removed from the enfolding arms of I

its dead mother. There was a calm and holy smile upon the
stranger’s lips as he looked into the sweet face of the innocent
child ere he resigned it to others ; and those who saw that smile,
said in their hearts,———“ Verily, he hath his reward.”

20. For weeks the plague hovered, with its black wings, over
that devoted city; and, during the whole time, this stranger, to
all the inhabitants, passed from house to house, supporting a

dying heal here, giving drink to such as were almost mad with
thirst thei e, and bearing forth in his arms those for whom there
was any hope of life. But, when “the pestilence that walketh
in darkness and wasteth at noon day,” had left the city, he was
nowhere to be found.

21. For years the castle of De Montfort was without a lord.
Its knightly owner had departed, though to what far country
no one knew. At last he returned,-—not on mailed charger,
with corselet, casque, and spear,—-—a boastful knight, with hands
crimsoned by_ his brother’s blood, —not as a pious devotee from
his cloister; but, as a man, from the city where he had done

good deeds amid the dying and the dead. He came to take’

possession of his stately castle and his broad lands once more,——

not as a knight, but as a man,—not to glory once more in his

proud elevation, but to use the gifts with which God had en-
dcwed him, in making wiser, better and happier, his fellow men.

22. He had work to do, and he was faithful in its perform-
ance. He was no longer a knight-errant, seeking for adventure
wherever brute courage promised to give him renown; he was
no longer an idle hermit, shrinking from his work in the great
harvest—ﬁelds of life; but he was a man, doing valiantly, among

his fellow-men, truly noble deeds,——not deeds of blood, but

deeds of moral daring, in an age when the real uses of life were
despised by the titled few.

There was the bold Knight, the pious Hermit, and the Man;
but the MAN was best and greatest of all. '

doomed to perpetual slavery, in consequence of yielding up to
tyrants their natural-born liberties, I read with a sort of phi-
losophical horror; so that the ﬁrst systematical and bloody at-
tempt, at Lexington, to enslave America, thoroughly electriﬁed
my mind, and fully determined me to take part with my coun-
try. And, while I was wishing for an opportunity to signalize
myself in its behalf, directions were privately sent to me from
the then colony (now State) of Connecticut, to raise the ,Green-
Mountain Boys, and, if possible, with them to surprise and take
the fortress of Ticonderoga.

2. This enterprise I cheerfully undertook; and, after ﬁrst
guarding all the several passes that led thither, to cutoff all
intelligence between the garrison and the country, made a
forced march from Bennington, and arrived at the lake oppo-
site to Ticonderoga, on the evening of the_ ninth day of May,
17 75, with two hundred and thirty valiant Green-Mountain
Boys; and it was with the utmost diﬂiculty that I procured
boats to cross the lake. However, I landed eighty-three men
near the garrison, and sent the boats back for the rear—guard,
commanded by Colonel Seth Warner; but the day began to
dawn, and I found myself under the necessity to attack the
fort,.before the rear could cross the lake ; and, -as it was viewed
hazardous, I harangued the oﬁicers and soldiers in the man-
ner following :—- - '

3. “Friends and fellow soldiers: You have, for a number

_ of years past, been a scourge and terror to arbitrary power.

Your valor has been famed abroad, and acknowledged, as ap-
pears by the advice and orders to me, from the General As-
sembly of Connecticut, to surprise and take the garrison now
before us. I now propose to advance before you, and, in person,
conduct you through the wicket-gate; for we must his morn-
ing either quit our pretensions to valor, or possess ourselves of
this fortress in a few minutes; and, inasmuch as it is a des-
perate attempt, which ‘none but the bravest of men dare under-
take, 'I do not urge it on any contrary to his will. You that
will undertake voluntarily, poise your ﬁrelocks.”

4. The men being, at this time, drawn up in three ranks,
each poised his ﬁrelock. I ordered them to face to the right,
and at the head of the center-ﬁle, marched them immediately
to the wicket=gate aforesaid, where I found a sentry posted,
who instantly snapped his fusee at me; I ran immediately
toward him, and he retreated through the covered way into the
parade within the garrison, gave a halloo, and ran under a
bomb~proof. My party, who followed me into the fort, I formed
on the parade in such a manner as to face the two  "barracks
which faced each other.‘

5. The garrison being asleep, except the sentries, we gave
three huzzas, which greatly surprised them. One of the sen-
tries made a pass at one of my oﬁicers with a charged bayo-
net, and slightly wounded him. My ﬁrst "thought was to kill
him with my sword; but, in an instant, I altered the design
and fury of the blow to a slight cut on the side of the head,
upon which he dropped his gun, and asked quarter, which I
readily granted him, and demanded of him the place where the
commanding ofﬁcer slept. '

6. He showed me a pair of stairs in the front of a barrack,
on the west part of the garrison, which led up to a second
story in said barrack, to which I immediately repaired, and
ordered the commander, Captain De la Place, to come forth in-
stantly, or I would sacriﬁce the whole garrison ; at which the
captain came immediately to the door, with his breeches in
his hand, when I ordered him to deliver me the fort instantly;
he asked me by what authority I demanded it; I answered
him : “ In the name of the Great Jehovah, and the Continental
C’ongo'e.s*s.”

7. The authority of the Congress being very little known at
that time, he began to speak again; but I interrupted him,
and, with my drawn sword over his head, again demanded an
immediate surrender of the garrison; with which he then com-
plied, and ordered his men to be forthwith paraded without
arms, as he had given up the garrison. I

and in consequence thereof, sundry of the barrack doors were

which consisted of the said commander, a Lieutenant F elthani,
a conductor of artillery, a gunner, two sergeants, and forty»
four rank and ﬁle; about one hundred pieces of cannon, one

was carried into execution in the gray of the morning of the

tenth of May, 1775. The sun seemed to rise that morning,

with a superior luster; and Ticonderoga and its dependencies
smiled to its conquerors who tossed about the ﬂowing bowl,
and wished success to Congress, anl the liberty and freedom

or deserve it less. The ﬁrst'step he took after his capture, was to
write a letter to General Washington, conceived in terms of dig-

of it was to vindicate himself from the imputation of having as-

asserting that he had been involuntarily an impostor; that, con-
trary to his intention, which was to meet a person for intelligence
on neutral ground, he had been betrayed within our posts, and
forced into the vile condition of an enemy in disguise; solicit»
ing only that to whatever rigor policy might devote him, a
decency of treatment might be observed due to a person who,

ings. On his part, while he carefully concealed every thing
that 11 light implicate others, he frankly confessed all the facts
relating to himself, and upon his confession, without the trouble

of examining a witness, the board made their report.

3. The members were not more impressed with the candor
and ﬁrmness, mixed with a becoming sensibility, which he dis-
played, than he was penetrated with their liberality and polite=
ness. He acknowledged the generosity of the behavior to-
Ward him in every respect,_ but particularly in this, in the
strongest terms of manly gratitude. In a conversation with a
gentleman who visited him after his trial, he said, he ﬂajtered
himself he had never been illiberal; but, if there’ were any re-
mains of prejudice in his mind, his present experience must
obliterate them.

4. In one of the visits I made to him, (and I saw him sev-
eral times during his conﬁnement), he begged me to be the
bearer of a request to the General, for permission to send an
open letter to Sir Henry Clinton. “I foresee my fate,” said he,
“and though I pretend not to play the hero, or to be indiffer-
ent about life, yet I am reconciled to whatever may happen,
conscious that misfortune, not guilt, has brought it upon me.
There is only one thing that disturbs my tranquillity. Sir
Henry Clinton has been too good to me ; he has been lavish of
his kindness; I am bound to him by too many obligations, _and
love him too well to bear the thought that he should reproach
himself, or others should reproach him, on the supposition of
my having conceived myself obliged by his instructions, to run
the risk I did. I would not, for the world, leave a sting in his
mind that should embitter his future days.”

in spite of his efforts to suppress them, and with diﬁiculty col~
lecting himself enough afterward to add,——-“I wish to be per
mitted to assure him, I did ‘not act under this impression, but
submitted to a necessity imposed upon me, as contrary to my
own inclinations, as to his orders.” His request was readily
complied with, and he} wrote the letter annexed with which I

6. VVhen his sentence was ani-ounced. to him, he remarked,
that since he was to die, there was still a choice in the mode,
which would make a material difference to his feelings; and he

’ would be happy, if possible, to be indulged with a professional

death. He made a second application by letter, in concise, but
persuasive terms. It was thought that this indulgence, being
incompatible with the customs of war, could not be granted;
and it was, therefore, determined, in both cases, to evade an
answer, to spare the sensations which a certain knowledge of
the intended mode would inﬂict.

'7. In going to the place of execution, be bowed familiarly as
he went along, to all those with whom he had been acquainted
in his conﬁnement. A smile of complacency expressed the
serene fortitude of his mind. Arrived at the fatal spot, he
asked with some emotion,—“ Must I then die in this manner ?”
He was told it had been unavoidable. “I am reconciled -to my
fate,” said he, “but not to the mode.” Soon, however, recol-
lecting himself, he added,——“ It will be but a momentary pang,”
and springing upon the cart, performed the last oflices to him-
self with a composure that excited the admiration and melted
the hearts of the beholders. Upon being told the ﬁnal mo-
ment was at hand, an.d asked if he had any thing to say, he

well improved by education and travel, he united a peculiar
elegance of mind and manners, and the advantage of a pleasing
person. It is said he possessed a pretty taste for the ﬁne arts,
and had‘ himself attained some proﬁciency in poetry, music, and
painting. His knowledge appeared Without ostentation, and

9. His sentiments were elevated, and inspired esteem ; they
had a softness that conciliated affection. His elocution was
handsome; his address easy, polite, and insinuating. By his
‘merit, he had acquired the unlimited conﬁdence of his general,
and was making a rapid progress in military rank and reputa-
tion. But, in the hight of his career, ﬂushed with new hopes
from the execution of a project the most beneﬁcial to his party
that could be devised, he was at once precipitated from the
summit of prosperity, and saw all the expectations of his ambi-
tion blasted, and himself ruined.

10. The character I have given of him, is drawn partly from
what I saw of him myself, and partly from information. I am
aware, that a man of real merit is never seen in so favorable
:1 light as through the medium of adversity. The clouds that
surround him, are shades that set off his good qualities. Mis-
fortune cuts down the little vanities that in prosperous times
serve-as so many spots in his virtues, and gives a tone of hu-
mility that makes his worth more amiable. His spectators
who enjoy a happier lot, are less prone to detract from it
through envy; and are more disposed by compassion to give
him the credit he deserves, and, perl1aps,even to magnify it.

11. I speak not of André’s conduct in this affair as a philoso-
pher, but as a man of the -world. The authorized maxims and
practices of war are the satires of human nature. They coun-
tenance almost every species of seduction, as well as violence;
and the general who can make most traitors in the army of
his adversary, is frequently most applauded. On this scale we
acquit Andre, while we would not but condemn him, if we were
to examine his conduct by the sober rules of philosophy and
moral rectitude. It is, however, a blemish on his fame, that he
once intended to prostitute a ﬂag: about this a man of nice
honor ought to have had a» scruple; but the temptation was
great. Let his misfortunes cas-t a vail over his error.

1. T110 MAS WOLSEY, usually called Cardinal Wolsey, was an eminent
Minister of State under Henry VIII., of England. He was born of
humble parentage, at Ipswich, in 1471. Having incurred the displeas-
ure of the king, he fell into disgrace, and was twice arrested on a
charge of Ligh treason. He died in 1530.

2. THOMAS CROMWELL, Earl of Essex, was the son of a blacksmith, at
Putney, in Surrey. He was born in 1490. Becoming the conﬁdential
servant of Cardinal Wolsey, he rose to considerable power; and, when
Wolsey was impeached, Cromwell defended him with great spirit, in
the House of Commons, against the articles of impeachment. He was,
after the Cardinal’s death, taken into the king’s service, and ultimately
became principal -Secretary of State. But he, too, at length, fell under
the displeasure of Henry, and was beheaded, in 1540, on a charge of
treason.

The following is a scene from Scott’s “Lady of the Lake.” Fitz-James,
the.»hero of the piece, is no less a personage than James V., of Scotland,
Whose love of romantic adventure oftenled him “to traverse the vicinage
of his several palaces, in various disguises.” He is here presented, by
the fancy of the poet, in a “hunting suit of Lincoln-green,” and, in com
pany with Murdoch, a faithless guide, passing through the Tr0sach’s
glen, “a rough and bristled territory,” in the vicinity of Loch Katrine.
Roderick is a daring and desperate chieftain, Who, in this singularly in-
teresting story, is made to hold undisputed sway over the hardy High-
landers of that part of the country. Ellen is the Lady of the Lake, the
heroine of the poem. Who Blanche of Devan Was, sufficiently appears
in what follows.

BLANCHE OF DEVAN.

1. All in the Trosach’s glen Was still,
N oontide was sleeping on the hill ;
Sudden hisguide vvhooped loud and high ;——-
“ Murdoch ! was that a signal cry ?”-—
He stammered forth,—-“ I shout to scare
Yon raven from nis dainty fare.”
“ Murdock, move ﬁrst,-—but silently;
Whistle or Whoop, and thou shalt die 1”
‘ Jealous and sullen on they fared,
Each silent, each upon his guard.

2 NOW Wound the path its dizzy ledge
Around a precipice’s edge.
When, lo 1 a wasted female form,
Blighted by Wrath of sun and storm,
In tattered weeds and wild array,
Stood on a cliff beside the way, 9
And glancing round her restless eye,
Upon the Wood, the rock, the sky,
Seemed naught to mark, yet all to spy

Her brow was wreathed with gaudy broom;
With gesture wild she waved a plume

Of feathers which the eagles ﬂing

To cragland cliff, from dusky wing;

Such spoils her desperate step had sought,
Where scarce was footing for the goat.

The tartan plaid she ﬁrst descried,

And shrieked till all the rocks replied ;

And loud she laughed when near they drew,
For then the Lowland garb she knew;

And then her hands she wildly wrung,

And then she wept and then she sung,——}- _‘
She sung I—-the voice, in better time,
Perchance to harp or lute might chi-me;

And now, though strained and roughened, still
Rung wildly sweet to dale and hill.

SONG.

. They bid me sleep, they bid me pray,

They say my brain is warped and wrung;
I can not sleep on Highland brae,*
I can not pray in Highland tongue.
But were I now where Allanf glides,
Or heard my native DeVan’s tides,
So sweetly would I rest and pray .
That Heaven would close my wint’ry day!

. ’T was thus my hair they bade me braid,

They made me to the church repair;
It was my bridal morn, they said,
And my true love would meet me there.

* Brae is a steep or precipice; a declivity.

ft The Allan and Devan are two beautiful streams, the latter celebrated
In the poetry of Burns, which descend from the hills of Perthshire into
the great carse, or plain of Stirling. ’

She hovers o’er the hollow way,

And ﬂutters wide her mantle gray,

As the lone heron spreads his wing,

“ ’Tis Blanche of Devan,” Murdoch said,
“A crazed_and captive Lowland maid,
Ta’en on the morn she Was‘a bride,
When Roderick forayed Devan-side.

And afelt our Chief’s uneonquered blade.

NE(}]JIGENCE OF DRESS IN MEN OF LETTERS.
JOSEPH ‘DENNIE.

1. Among the minor virtues, cleanliness ought to be con§
spicuously ranked; and, in the ‘common topics of praise, we
generally’ arrange some commendation of neatness. It involves
much. It supposes a love of order, an attention to the laws of
custom, and a decent pride. Lord Bacon says that a good per-
son is a perpetual letter of recommendation. This idea may be
extended. Of a well-dressed man it may be affirmed, that he
has a sure passport through the realms of civility.

2. In first interviews we can judge of no one except from ap-
pearances. He, therefore, whose exterior is agreeable, begins
well. in any society. Men and women are disposed to augur
favorably, rather than otherwise, of him who manifests, by the
purity and propriety of his garb, a disposition to comply and
to please. As, in rhetoric, a judicious exordium is of admirable
use to render an audience‘ docile, attentive, and benevolent, so,
at your introduction into good company, clean andmodish ap-
parel is, though an humble, at least, a serviceable herald of
our exertions.

3. As these are very obvious «truths, and as literary men are
generally vain, and sometimes proud, it is singular that one of

, the easiest modes of gratifying self-complacency should, by

them, be, for the most part, neglected; and that this sort of
‘carelessness is so adhesive to one tribe of writers, that the words
poet and sloven are regarded as synonymous in the world’s
vocabulary. -
4. This negligence in men of letters sometimes arises from
their inordinate application to books and papers, and may be
palliated by a good-natured man, as the natural product of a
mind too intensely engaged in sublime speculations to attend to
the blackness of a shoe or the whiteness of a ruﬁie. Mr. Locke
and Sir Isaac Newton might be forgiven by their candid co-

temporaries, though the ﬁrst had composed his essay with “un-

360 SANDERS’ NEW SERIES.

washen hands,” and the second had investigated the laws of
nature when he was clad in a soiled nightgown.

5. But slovenliness is often affected by authors, or rather
pretenders to authorship, and must then be considered as
highly culpable;--as an outrage of decorum, as a deﬁance to
the world, and as a pitiful scheme to attract notice by means
which are equally in the power of the drayman and chimney-
sweeper. I know a poet of this description, who anticipates
renown no less from a dirty shirt than from an elegant couplet,
and imagines that, when his appearance is the most sordid, the
world must conclude, of course, that his mind is splendid and fair.

6. In his opinion, “ marvelous foul linen” is a token of wit, and
inky ﬁngers indicate humor; he avers that a slouched hat is
demonstrative of a well-stored brain, and that genius always
trudges about in unbuckled shoes. He looks for invention in
rumpled ruffles, and ﬁnds high-sounding poetry among the
folds of a loose stocking. But this smirched son of Apollo
may be assured, there is no necessary connection between dirt
and ability. It is not necessary to consummate such a marriage
to produce the fairest offspring of the mind. One may write
brilliantly, and, strange as it may seem, be dressed well. If
negligence be the criterion of genius, a critic will, in future, in-
spect a poet’s wardrobe rather than his works.

_ 7. Slovenliness, so far from being commendable in an author,
is more inexcusable in men of letters than in many others, the
nature -of whose employment compels them to be conversant

with objects sordid and impure. A smith from his forge, or a
husbandman from his ﬁelds, is obliged sometimes to appear
stained with the smut of the one or the dust of the other. A
writer, on the contrary, sitting in an easy-chair at a polished
desk, and leaning on white paper, or examining the pages of a
book, is, by no means, obliged to be soiled by his labors. I see
no reason why an author should not be agentleman, or at least,
as clean and neat as a Quaker.

8. Far from thinking that ﬁlthy dress marks a liberal mind,
I should suspect the good sense and talents of him who aﬁ'ec-ted

HIGH scHooL READER. - 361

A
Y

to wear a tattered coat as the badge of his profession. Should
I see a reputed genius totally regardless of his person, I should
immediately doubt the delicacy of his taste, and the accuracy
of his judgment. ’ I should conclude there was some obli-
quity in his mind, a dull sense of decorum, and at disregard of
order. I should fancy that he consorted with low society ; and,
instead of claiming the privilege of genius, to knock and be
admitted at palaces, that he chose to sneak in at the back door
of hovels, and wallow brutishly in the sty of the vulgar.

9. It is recorded of Somerville and Shenstone that they were
negligent, and of Smith that he was a sloven. But disregard
of ~ dress is by no means a constant trait in the literary charac-
ter. Edmund Waller, Prior, Swift, and Bolingbroke, were re-
markably neat in their persons, and curious in the choice of
apparel; and; of David. Mallett, Dr. Johnson observes “that

his appearance was agreeable, and he suffered it to want no

recommendation that dress could give.”

10. The Orientals are careful of their persons, with much
care. Their frequent ablutions and change of garments are
noticed in every page of their history. The wise men of the
East supposed there was some analogy between the purity of
the body and the mind ; nor is this a vain imagination. I can

not conclude this subject better than by an extract from the
__ works of Count Rumford who, in few and strong words, has

fortiﬁed my doctrine :—

11. “ With what care and attention do the feathered race
wash themselves and put their plumage in order; and how per-
fectly neat, clean, and elegant do they ever appear. Among the
beasts of the ﬁeld, we ﬁnd that those which are the most cleanly,
are generally the most gay and cheerful, or are distinguished by

a certain air of tranquillity and contentment; and singing-

birds are always remarkable for the neatness of their plumage.
So great is the effect of cleanliness upon man that it extends
even to his moral character. Virtue never dwelt long with
ﬁlth ;_ nor do I believe there ever was a person scrupulously at-
tentive to cleanliness who was a consummate villain.”

requires an impartial verdict of a jury, and furnishes the judge

with his sentence. It sets the husband as lord of the house-‘

hold, and the wife as mistress of the table; tells him how to
rule, and her how to manage. It entails honor to parents, and
enjoins obedience on children. -

2. It gives directions for weddings and for burials ; regulates
feasts and fasts, mournings and rejoicings; and orders labor
for the day and rest for the night. It promises food and rai-
ment, and limits the use of both. It points out a faithful and
an eternal Guardian to the departing husband and father ; tells
him with whom to leave his fatherless children, and in whom
his widow is to trust. It teaches a man how to set his house
in order, and how to make his will. It defends the rights of
all ; and reveals vengeance to every defrauder, over—reacher, or
oppressor. It is the ﬁrst book, the best book, and the oldest

corrects the vain philosopher, and confutes the wise astrono-

multitude. He never preached to empty synagogues ; and,
when heoccupied the market or the mountain side, they were
not hundreds that listened to his voice, but thousands. It is
recorded of him,‘that “ his fame went throughout all Syria ;”
and that-“ there followed him great multitudes of people from
Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from J udea, and from be-
yond Jordan.” it p

2. On that memorable day, When he went from the Mount
of Olives to Judea, “ a great multitude spread their garments in
the Way, and others cut down branches from the trees,” and all
cried “Hosanna to the Son of David!” After he uttered the
parable of the vineyard, the rulers “sought to lay hold of him,
but feared the people.” When he “returned in the power of
the Spirit into Galilee, there went out at fame of him through-
out all the region round about,” and he “ was gloriﬁed of all,

and great multitudes came together to hear him.”

3. So much was he, for the time, the idol of the people, that
the chief priests and Pharisees were alarmed at. his popularity,
and said among themselves: “ If We let him then alone, all men
will believe on him; behold, the world is gone after him 1” He
was the man of the people, and advocated the cause of the peo-
ple. VVe are told that “the common people heard him gladly.”
He was “no respecter of persons.” He was the preacher to man,
as man. He never passed the door of poverty, and was not
ashamed to be called “ the friend of publicans and sinners.”

4. His Gospel was and-is the great and only bond of brother-
hood; nor was there then, nor is there now, any other universal
brotherhood, than that which ‘consists in love and loyalty
to him. He was the only safe reformer‘ the world has seen,
because he. so Well understood the checks and balances by
which the masses are governed. His preaching, like his char-
aeter, bold and uncompromising as it was, was, also, in the high-
est degree conservative. He taught new truths, and he was the
great Vindicator of those that were old. All these things made
him a most impressive, powerful, and attractive preacher.

the people. They respected him for his acquaintance with the
truth, and honored his discretion and fearlessness in proclaiming
it. This is human nature ; men love to be thus instructed ;
they come to the house of God for that purpose. A vapid and
vapory preacher may entertain them for the hour; a smooth
and ﬂattering preacher may amuse them ; a mere denunciatory

preacher may produce a transient excitement; but such is the '

power of conscience, and such the power of God and the
wants of men that, though their hearts naturally hate Gr0d’s
truth, they will crowd the sanctuaries where it is instructively,
and fearlessly, and discreetly urged, while ignorance, and error,
and a coward preacher, put forth their voice to the listless and
the few.

CULTIVATION or TASTE.
REV. WM. HAGUE.

1. “Nothing is beautiful but What is true,” say the Rhetori-
cians: This is a universal maxim. Conformity to truth is
beauty, real and permanent. Study nature. Seek truth. The
laws of nature are distinguished by simplicity, and simplicity
has an abiding charm, whether it appear in literature or art, in
character or manners. Thence affectation always displeases,
when it is discovered. Though alfectation be the fashion, yet
it appears contemptible as soon as it loses the delusive charm
of novelty or a name. In France, fashion once declared for an
affected negligence of dress.

2. Thence we hear Montaigne saying,—“I have never yet been
apt to imitate the negligent garb, observable among the young
men of our time, to wear my cloak on one shoulder, my bon-
net on one side, and one stocking in somewhat more disorder
than the other, meant to express a manly disdain of such exotic
ornaments, and a contempt of art.” There is no beauty in the
cultivated negligence even of triﬂes. It is only that which. is
occasional, appropriate, and which indicates a mind engaged
and absorbed in something Worthy of it, which truly pleases.

3. Scott saw it in his Lady of the Lake, when he said :

“With head upraised, and look intent,
And eye and ear attentive bent,
And locks ﬂung back, and lips apart,
Like monument of Grecian art,
In listening mood she seemed tostand,
The guardian N aiad of the strand.”

No kindred grace adorns her of whom it may be said:

“ Coquet and coy, at once her air,
Both studied, though both seem neglected;
Careless she is with artful care,
Affecting to seem unaffected.”

Truth to nature, then, is beauty, and to studyithe laws of
nature is to chasten’ and develop the taste for beauty. I

4. Another means of cultivating good taste, is to study the
expression of character or design in which the beauty of ob-
jects consists. In the material world, every thing beautiful is a
manifestation of certain qualities which are by nature agreeable
to the mind; and to ascertain what these are, to point them
out distinctly, to classify them, is a pleasing mode of reﬁning
and quickening the taste for beauty. “The longer I live,” said
one, “the more familiar I become with the world around me.
Oh! that I could feel the keen zest of _' which I was susceptible
when a boy, and all was new and fair l” “The longer I live,”
says another, “the more charmed I become with the beauties

_of a picture or a landscape.” *

5. The ﬁrst of these had a natural taste for beauty which he
had never developed by studying the expression of character,
which constitutes the loveliness of‘ creation. The other, regard-
ing the outward universe as a splendid system of signs, directed
his attention to the things signiﬁed ; loved to contemplate the
moral qualites which were beaming forth from all the ‘surround-
ing objects, and thus saw open before him a boundless ﬁeld,
ever glowing with new colors and fresh attractions.

REMARK:---To read the fo1*egoi1ig example in one dull, mo-
notonous tone of voice, Without regard to the sentiment ex-

‘pressed, would render the passage extremely insipid and life-

less. But by a proper modulation of the voice, it infuses into
the mind of the reader or hearer the most animating and ex-
citing emotions.

A correct modulation of the voice is one of the most im-
portant requisites in the speaker. For if the voice is kept for
a considerable length of time on one continuous key or pitch,
he will not only fail to present that variety and force which
the subject contains, but he will weary both himself and his
hearers.

The voice is modulated in three different Ways. First, it is
varied in PITCH; that is, from high to low tones, and the re-
Verse. Secondly, it is varied in QUANTITY, or in loudness or
volume of sound. Thirolly, it is varied in QUALITY, or in the
lcind of sound expressed.

PITCH OF VOICE.
PITCH OF VOICE has reference to its degree of ele-
Vation.

Every person,lin reading or speaking, assumes a certain
pitch, which may be either high or low, according to circum-
stances, and which has a governing inﬂuence on the variations
of the voice, above and below it. This degree of elevation is
usually called the KEY NOTE.

As an exercise in varying the voice in pitch, the practice
of uttering a sentence on the several degrees of elevation,’ as
represented in the following scale, will be found beneﬁcial.

« First, utter the. musical syllables, then the Vowel sound, and

lastly, the proposed sentence,-—ascending and descending.

meant by pitch of voice? What practice is recommended for varying
the pitch of Voice?

READING. _
in GIBBON.

1. Reading is the nourishment of the mind ; for by reading
We know our Creator, his Works, ourselves chieﬂy, and our fel-
1oW—creatures. But this nourishment is easily converted into
poison. Salmasius‘ had read as much as Grotius,” perhaps more;
but their different modes of reading made the one an enlight-
ened philosopher, and the other, to speak plainly, a pedant,
puﬁed up with a useless erudition. _‘ , .

2. Let us read with method, and propose to ourselves an end

HIGH SCHOOL READER. 377

A

to which all our studies may point. Through neglect of this
rule, gross ignorance often disgraces great readers; who, by
skipping hastily and irregularly from one subject to another,
render themselves incapable of combining their ideas. So many
detatched parcels of knowledge can not form a whole. This
inconstancy weakens the energies of the mind, creates in it a

. dislike to application, and even robs it of the advantages of nat-

ural good sense.

3. Yet let us avoid the contrary extreme, and respect method,
without rendering ourselves its slaves. While we propose an
end in our reading, let not this end be too remote ; and when
once we have attained it, let our attention be directed .-to a dif-
ferent subject. Inconstancy weakens the understanding; a long
and exclusive application to a single object hardens and con-
tracts it. Our ideas no longer change easily into a different
channel, and the course of reading to which we have too long
accustomed ourselves, is the only one that we can pursue with
pleasure. ‘

4. We ought, besides, to be careful not to make the order of
our thoughts subservient to that of our subjects ; this would be
to sacriﬁce the principal to the accessory. The use of our
reading is to aid us in thinking. The perusal of a particular
work gives birth, perhaps, to ideas unconnected with the subjebt
of which it treats. I wish to pursue these ideas '; they with-
draw me from my proposed plan of reading, and throw me into
a new track, and from thence, perhaps, into a second and a
third. At length, I begin to perceive whither my researches
tend. Their result, perhaps, may be proﬁtable; it is Worth
while to try; whereas, had I followed the high road, I should
not have been able, at the end of my long journey, to retrace
the progress of my thoughts.

, 5. This plan of reading is not applicable to our early studies,
since the severest method is scarcely sufficient to make us con-
ceive objects altogether new. Neither can it be adopted by
those who _read in order to write, and who ought to dwell on
their subject till they have sounded its depths. These reflec-

378 SANDERS’ NEW snnrns.

tions, however, I do not absolutely warrant. On the supposi-
tion that they are just, they may be so, perhaps, for myself
only. The constitution of minds differs like that of bodies;
the same regimen will not suit all. Each individual ought to
study his own. ,

6. To read with attention, exactly to deﬁne the expressions
of our author, never to admit a conclusion without compre-
hending its reason, often to pause, reﬂect, and interrogate our-
selves, these are so many advices which it is easy to give, but
difficult to follow. The same may be said of that almost evan-
gelical maxim of forgetting friends, country, religion, of giving
merit its due. praise, and embracing truth wherever it is to be
found. ,

7. But what ought we to read? Each individual must an-
swer this question for himself, agreeably to the object of his
studies. The only general precept that I would venture to
give, is that of Pliny,--—“ to read much, rather than many
things ;” to make a careful selection of the best works, and to
render them familiar to us by attentive and repeated perusals.
Without expatiating on the authors so generally known and
approved, I would simply observe, that in matters of reasoning,
the best are those who have augmented the number of useful
truths; who have discovered truths, of whatever nature they
may be; in one word, those bold spirits who, quitting the
beaten track, prefer being in the wrong alone, to being in the
right with the multitude. Such authors increase the number
of _our ideas, and even their mistakes are useful to their suce
cessors. With all the respect due to Mr. Locke, I would not,
however, neglect the works of those academicians who de-
stroy errors without hoping to substitute truth in their stead.

8. In Works of fancy, invention ought to bear away the
palm; chieﬂy that invention which creates a new kind of writ-

ing; and next, that which displays the charms of novelty in its

1. His simple truths did Andrew glean

Beside the babbling rills;
A careful student he had been
Among the woods and hills.
One winter’s night, when through. the trees
The windwas roaring, on his knees
His youngest born did Andrew hold ;
And while the rest, a ruddy quire,
Were seated round their blazing ﬁre,
This Tale the Shepherd told :

As ever tempest beat I

Out of its head an Oak had grown,
A Broom out of its feet.

The time was March, a cheerful noon,——

The thaw—wind, with the breath of June,
Breathed gently from the warm south‘-west;

When, in a voice sedate with age,

This Oak, a giant and a sage, .
His neighbor thus addressed :

Who, now to ﬁfteen years or more arrived,
Woiild neither dig nor thrash, nor hold the plow,
But simply, by the poor old woman lived.

. Joan thought it time this lazy, lounging lad,

Should learn some trade, since country work he hated :
“Jerry,” said she, “to London you must go,
And learn to work; for this you were created.

. “ While tarrying here, .you eat up all my kale,*

Scarce leave a turnip—top,—-my hens you kill, »
And nothing earn. My wheel alone goes round;

For hight you shortly will be called a man;
Not so with me,——l am hastening down the hill,
And soon must mix with dust, where I began!”

. Jerry with tears received the good advice;

So, up to London town next week they went.
“Now choose,” said Joan, “the trade you fancy best,
For to some trade youmust and shall be sent.”

. So round he strolled through many a street and alley,

Saw blacksmiths here, like Vulcan, wielding sledges;
There tailors sitting cross—legged on a board, '
Next barbers whetting up their razors’ edges. ’

. Now saw a cobbler cobbling in a stall,

Then weaver busy with his warp and woof ;
Now mason raising hig/h some lordling’s wall,
Or carpenter engaged upon a roof.

. ‘ These pleased him not. All this was hard-earned cash.

Or only good as managed by his mother.

“All thisis worse than thrashing——learn a trade.

Great George the Third, in all his pomp and glare; _

That has a trade would suit me to a hair.

And dainty dishes go a begging here:
Seine seem towork, yet all their work is play,
I will be bound at least for seven long year.”

13. So back he came where honest Joan was waiting;
“ W/Vell, Jerry, tell me, what ’s the trade you pitch on ?”
“Mother,” said he, “thereis bfii one I like,  
Or which a man is likely to get rich on.”

during the celebrated ten-years’ siege of the city by the Greeks.

2. HECTOR was the eldest and bravest of the sons of Priam. For a.
leng time he was the chief bulwark of his native city. He fell ultimately
by the hands of Achilles, the most formidable of all the Grecian chief-
tains, and was dragged away, with insolent triumph, to the camp of the
enemy. The body was ﬁnally ransomed by his aged father.

after his father’s death, and toward the close of the seige. When, finally,
the Greeks got within the walls of the city, Pyrrhus broke down the
gates of Pr'iarn’s palace, slew Polites, one of his sons, in the very sight
of his parents, and slaughtered the unhappy monarch himself before the

An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew,

Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train

Their images they hug, and to their altars fly.

Behold I Polites, one of Priam’s sons,

Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs;
Through swords and foes, amazed and hurt, he flia,
Through empty courts, and open galleries.

Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,

And often reaches, and his thrusts renews.

5. The youth transﬁxed, with lamentable cries,
Expires lefore his wretched parents’ eyes;
Whom gasping at his feet, when Priam saw,
The fear of death gave place to _nature’s law;
And, shaking more with anger than with age,-—
“The gods,” said he, “ requite thy brutal rage!
As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,

If there be ‘gods in heaven, and gods be just-—
Who tak’st in wrongs an insolent delight ;
With a son’s death t’ infect a father’s sight.
Not he whom thou and lying fame conspire
To call thee his,——-'-not he, thy vaunted sire,
Thus used my wretched age: the gods he feared.
The laws of nature and of nations heard. _
He cheered my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,
The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;
Pitied the woes a parent underwent,

And sent me back in safety from his tent.”

. Which, ﬂuttering, seemed to loiter as it ﬂew:
Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,
And faintly tinkled on'the brazen shield.

And to my father my foul deeds relate.
Now die I” VVith that he dragged the trembling sire,
Sliddering through clottered blood and holy mire,

Hauled from beneath the violated shade,)
And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid. ~

His right hand held his bloody falchion bare;

His left he twisted in his hoary hair:

Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:

The lukewarm blood came rushing through the wound,
And sanguine streams distained the sacred ground.

With Troy in ashes, and his ruined state,-—
He who the scepter._.of all Asia swayed,
Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obeyed,
On the bleak shore now lies the abandoned king,
A headless carcass, and a nameless thing.

THE BEAUTIFUL.
JOHN G. WHITTIET;-1..

1. V\¢'hat . is beauty, after all? Ask the lover who kneels in
homage to one who has no attractions for others. The cold
on—looker wonders that he can_ call that unclassic combination
of features and that awkward form beautiful. Yet so it is.
He sees, like Desdemona, her “ visage in her mind,” or her
aﬁcections. A light from within shines through the external
uncomeliness,—softens, irradiates, and gloriﬁes it. That which
to others seems common~place and lmworthy of note, is to him,
in the words of Spenser 2

“A sweet, attractive kind of grace;
A full assurance given by looks;
Continual comfort in a face ;
The lineaments of gospel books.”

2. “‘ Handsome is that handsome does,——-hold up your heads,
girls I” was the language of Primrose in the play, when ad-
dressing her daughters. The Worthy matron was right.
Would that all my female readers who are sorrowing foolishly

because they are not in all respects like Dubufe’s Eve, or tha.t
statue of the Venus, “ which enchants the world,” could be per-
suaded to listen to her. . - r

3. What is good—looking, as Horace Smith remarks, but
looking good? Be good, be womanly, be gentle,—generous
in your sympathies, heedful of the well-being of all around
you ; and, my word for it, you will not lack kind words of ad-
miration. Loving and pleasing associations will gather about
you. Never mind the ugly reﬂection which your glass may
give you. That mirror has no heart. But quite another pic-
ture is yours on the retina of human sympathy. There the
beauty of ' holiness, of purity, of that inward grace “ which
passeth show,” rests over it, softening and mellowing its fea
tures just aslthe full, calm moonlight melts those of a rough
landscape into harmonious loveliness. '

4. “Hold up your heads, girls!” I repeat after Primrose.
V-Vhy should you not? Every mother’s daughter of you can
be beautiful. You can envelop yourselves in an atmosphere
of moral and intellectual beauty, through which your other-
wise plain faces will look forth like those of angels. Beauti-
ful to Ledyard, stiffening in the cold of a northern winter,
seemed’ the diminutive, smoke-stained women of Lapland, who
wrapped him in their furs and ministered to his necessities
with kindness and gentle words of compassion. Lovely to the
homesick heart of Park seemed the dark maids of Sego, as
they sung their low and simple song of welcome beside his

bed, and sought to comfort the white stranger wl1o had “no

m_other to bring him milk, and no wife to grind him corn.”

5. (),.talk as we may of beauty as a thing to be chiseled
from marble or wrought out on canvas; speculate as we may
upon its colors and outlines; what is it but an intellectual
abstraction, after all ?‘ The heart feels a beauty of another
kind ; looking through the outward environment, it discovers a
deeper and more real loveliness. This was well understood by
the old painters. In their pictures of Mary, the virgin—n1other,

mother’s miraculous allotment with the irrepressible love, the
unutterable tenderness, of young maternity,-—Heaven’s crown-
i_ng miracle with Nature’s holiest and sweetest instinct.

6. And their pale Magda-lens, holy with the look of sins for-
given,—how the divine beauty of . their penitence sinks into
the heart! Do we not feel that the only real deformity is sin,

nd that goodness evermore hallows and sanctiﬁes its dwell-
ing-place? When the soul is at rest, when the passions and
desires are all attuned to the divine harmony,—— '

“Spirits moving musically
To a 1ute’s Well-ordered 1aW,”*

do We not read the placid signiﬁcance thereof in the human
countenance ?

7. “ I have seen,” said Charles Lamb, “faces upon which
the dove of peace sat brooding.” In that simple and beautiful
record of a holy life, the Journal of John I/Voolman, there is a
passage of which I have been more than once reminded in
my intercourse with my felloW—beings: “ Some glances of real
beauty may be seen in their faces who dwell in true meekness.
There is a harmony in the sound of that voice to which divine
love gives utterance.” ' '

' 8. Quite the ugliest face I ever saw, was that of a woman
Whom the world calls beautiful. 1 Through its “silver Vail,”
the evil and ungentle passions looked outihideous and hateful.
On the other hand, there are faces which the multitude at the
ﬁrst glance pronounce homely, unattractive, and such as “ Na-
ture fashions by the gross,’.’ which I always recognize with a
warm heart-thrill ; not for the World would I have one feature
changed; they please me as they are; they are halloWed_ by
kind memories ; they are beautiful through their associations '
nor are they any the less welcome that with my admiration of
them “the stranger interrneddleth not.”

SLO-TH AND ACTIVITY.
POLLOK.
'1. Two principles from the beginning strove

In human nature, still dividing man,--

Sloth and activity; the lust of praise,

And indolence that rather wished to sleep;

And not unfrequently in the same mind

They dubious contest held; one gaining now,
And now the other crowned, and both again
Keeping the ﬁeld, with equal combat fought.
Much different was their voice. Ambition called
To action, Sloth invited to repose.

2. Ambition early rose, and, being up,

Toiled ardently, and late retired to rest;

Sloth lay till mid-day, turning on his couch,
,Like ponderous door upon its weary hinge,
And, having rolled him out with much ado,
And many a dismal sigh, and vain attempt,
He sauntered out, accoutered carelessly,-—
With half-oped, misty, unobservant eye,
Somniferous, that weighed the object down
On which its burden fell,———an hour or_two,
Then with a groan retired to rest ‘again.

The one, whatever deed ‘had been achieved,
Thought it too little, and too small the praise ;
The other tried to think,—-for thinking so
Answered his purpose-best,-——that what of great
Mankind could do had been already done ;
‘And, therefore, laid him calmly down to sleep.

Of fame destructive always too, if less

It opened the niggard’s purse, clothed nakedness,
Gave beggars food, and threw the‘ Pharisee
Upon his knees, and kept him long in act

Of prayer; it spread the lace upon the fop,

His language trimmed, and planned his curious gait,
It stuck the feather on the gay coquette,

And on her ﬁnger laid the heavy load

Of jewelry ; it did,—what did it not?

Destructive both We said, activity

And sloth : behold the last exempliﬁed,

In literary man. Not all at once,

He yielded to the soothing voice of sleep ;
But, having seen a bough of laurel wave,
He effort made to climb; andfriends, and even
Himself, talked of his greatness, as at hand,
And, prophesying, drew his future life.

Vain prophecy! his fancy, taught by sloth,
Saw, in the very threshold of pursuit,

A thousand ‘obstacles; he halted ﬁrst,

And, while he halted, saw his burning hopes
Grow dim and dimmer still; ambition’s self,
The advocate of loudest tongue, decayed.

Like plant uprooted oft, and set again,

More sickly grew, and daily wavered more;

THE HILL OF SCIENCE.
AIKIN.

1. In that season of the year, when the serenity of the sky,
the various fruits which cover the ground, the discolored foli-
age of the trees, and all the sweet, but fading graces of inspiring
autumn, open the mind to benevolence, and dispose it for con-
templation, I was wandering in a beautiful and romantic coun-
try, till curiosity began to give way to weariness; and I sat
down on the fragment of a rock overgrown with moss, where
the rustling of the falling leaves, the dashing of waters, and
the hum of the distant city, soothed my mind into a most per-
feet tranquillity; and sleep insensibly stole upon me, as I was
indulging the [agreeable reveries which the objects around me
naturally inspired." '

2. I immediately found myself in a vast extended plain, in
the middle of which arose a mountain higher than I had before
any conception of. It was covered with a multitude of people,
chieﬂy youth ; ‘many’ of whom pressed forward with the liveli-r
est expression of ardor in their countenance, though the way
was in many places steep and difficult. I observed that those
who had but ‘just begun to climb the hill, thought themselves
not far: from the top; but as they proceeded, the hills were con-

tinually rising to their view; and the summit of the highest

they could before discern, seemed but the foot of another, till

the mountain, at length, appeared to lose itself in the clouds.
3. As I was gazing on these things with astonishment, a

friendly instructor suddenly a.ppeared: “The mountain before

thee,” said he, “is the Hill of Science. On the top is the temple
of Truth whose head is above the clouds, and a Vail of pure light
covers her face. Observe the progress of her votaries; be silent

«and attentive.” After I had noticed, a variety of objects, I

turned my eye toward the multitudes who were climbing the
steep ascent; and observed among them a youth of a lively
look, a piercing eye, and something ﬁery and irregular in all
his motions. His name was Genius. He darted like an eagle
up the mountain, and left his companions gazing after him with
envy and admiration; but his progress was unequal, and inter-
rupted by a thousand caprices. I

I _ 4. When Pleasure warbled in the valley, he mingled in her
train. When Pride beckoned toward the precipice, he ventured
to the tottering edge. He delighted in devious and untried
paths, and made so many excursions from the road, that his
feebler companions often outstripped him. I observed that the
Muses beheld him with partiality; but Truth often frowned,
and turned aside her face. VVhile Genius was thus wasting his
strength in eccentric ﬂights, I saw a. person of a very different
appearance, named Application. He crept along with a slow
and unremitting pace, his eyes ﬁxed on the top of the mount
ain, patiently removing every stone that obstructed his way,
till he saw most of those below him, who had at ﬁrst derided
his slow and toilsome progress. I i .

5. Indeed, there were few who ascended the hill with
equal and uninterrupted steadiness; for, besides the difficul-
ties of the way, they were continually solicited to turn aside by
a numerous crowd of appetites, passions, and pleasures, whose
importunity, when once complied with, they became less ahd
less able to resist; and, though they often returned to the path,

the asperities of the road were more severely felt; the hill ap-‘

peared more steep and rugged; the fruits, which were whole-

some and refreshing, seemed harsh and ill—tasted; their sight
grew dim, and their feet tripped at every little obstruction.

6. I saw with some surprise that the Muses whose business
was to cheer and encourage those who were toiling up the
ascent, would often sing in the bowers of Pleasure, and accom-
pany those who were enticed away at the call of the Passions.
They accompanied them, however, but a little way; and always
forsook them when they lost sight of the hill. The tyrants
then doubled their chains upon the unhappy captives, and led
them aWay,‘without resistance, to the cells of Ignorance, or the
mansions of Misery. ~

7. Among the innumerable seducers who were endeavoring
to draw away thevotaries of Truth from the path of Science,
there was one, so little formidable in her appearance, and so
gentle and languid in her attempts, that I should scarcely have
taken notice of her, but for the numbers she had imper-
ceptibly loaded with her chains. Indolence, (for so she was
called,) far from proceeding to open hostilities, did not attempt
to turn their feet out of the path, but contented herself with
retarding their progress ; and the purpose she could not force
them to abandon, she persuaded them to delay.

8. Her touch had a power like that of the torpedo, which
withered the strength of those who came within its inﬂuence.
Her unhappy captives still turned their faces toward the tem-
ple, and always hoped to arrive there ; but the ground seemed
to slide from beneath their feet, and they found themselves at
the bottom before they suspected they had changed their place.
The placid serenity which at ﬁrst appeared in their countenance,
changed by degrees into a melancholy languor,which was tinged
with deeper and deeper gloom as they glided, down the stream
of Insigniﬁcance; a dark and sluggish water, which is curled
by no breeze, and enlivened by no murmur, till it falls into a
dead sea, where startled passengers are awakened by the shock,
and the next moment buried in the gulf of Oblivion.

9. Of all the unhappy deserters from the paths of Science,

HIGH SCHOOL READER. 395

m

none seemed less able to return than the followers of Indolence.
[he captives of Appetite and Passion would often seize the mo-
ment, when their tyrants were languid or asleep, to escape from
their enchantment; but the dominion of Indolence was con-

i stant and unremitted, and seldom resisted, until resistance was

toward the top of the mountain, where the air was always pure

seemed to shed aglory round her votaries. , _

uncommon ardor, I saw, standing beside me, a form of diviner fea-
tures, and a more benign radiance. -“ Happier,” said she, “are
they whom Virtue conducts to the mansions of Content!”
“ What 1” said I, “ does Virtue then reside in the vale ?” “I am
found,” said she, “in the Vale, and I illuminate the mountain.
I cheer the cottager at his toil, and inspire the sage at his medi-
tation: I mingle in the crowd of cities, and bless the hermit in
his cell. I have a temple in every heart that owns my inﬂu-
ence, and to him that wishes fordme, I am already present.
Science may raise thee to eminence; but I alone can guide thee

' to felicity!” While Virtue was thus speaking, I stretched out

my arms toward her with a vehemence which broke my slum-
ber. The chill dews were falling around me, and the shades of
evening stretched over the landscape. I hastened homeward,
and resigned the night to silence -and meditation.

QUANTITY.

QUANTITY has reference to fullness and clumtion of
sound. '

Quantity is two-’f'old ;——consisting in FULLNESS or VOLUME
of sound, as soft or loud ;_and in TIME, as slow or quick.
The former has reference to sTREss; the latter, to MOVEMENT.

_The degrees of variation in quantity, are numerous, vary-
ing from a slight, soft whisper, to a vehement shout. But
for all practical purposes, they may be considered as three,
the same as in pitch ;-—-—the soft, the middle, and the loud.

For exercise in quantity, let the pupil read any sentence;
as, '

“Beauty is a fading ﬂower,”

first in a slight, soft tone, and then repeat it, gradually in-
creasing in quantity to the full extent of the Voice. Also, let
him read it ﬁrst very slowly, and then repeat it gradually
increasing the movement. In doing this, he should be careful
not to vary the pitch. .

In like manner, let him repeat any vowel sound, or all of
them, and also inversely. Thus :

world. This circumstance was not without the most decisive
and important effects. The people had their own way, because
theycould not be controll.ed by their old masters at the dis-
tance of three thousand miles. Nobility never emigrated.
There was nothing to tempt it to quit its ancient home. It was
a plant of such a peculiar structure, that it would not bear trans-
lation to another soil. Here it would have withered and died,
amid the rugged forests and stern climate of America. A no-
bleman is the creation of a local conventionalism. He ﬂour-
ishes only in an artiﬁcial atmosphere. He must be seen by gas-

light. He is at home only in courts and palaces.

2. The pomp of courts, and the splendor of palaces, are the
contrivances not more of human pride than of far-sighted policy.
They are intended to impose on the imagination of the multi-
tude; to lead them to associate with the condition of their su-
periors, the ideas of’ providential and unattainable superiority,
to which it is their destiny and their duty to submit. Take
them away from the stage on which they choose to exhibit
themselves; strip them of their dramatic costume; take away
the overhanging chandelier and the glare of the foot—lights, and

‘let them mingle in the common crowd, and they become as

other men, and the crowd begin to wonder how they could ever

have looked up to them with so much reverence.

was no reason, therefore, why such a man should wish to leave
his country. VVhat could he ﬁnd here congenial to his taste,

any thing to leave behind. Much less was it to be expected,
tha; those would come here, who had drawn the highest prizes
in life at home. They could not seek a new organization of the
social condition, in which they had nothing to gain and every
thing to lose. ‘Here and there might be an adventurer of con-
dition‘, who came to this country to improve his broken fortunes;
but then it was, as in all new countries, with a hope “ of return«
ing to enjoy his gains in a country and a state of society, ‘Where
reﬁned enjoyment was -possible.

5. And, after all, beyond a limited circle, America Was, at that
time, very little known, and very little regarded by the people of
England. And it is very much so to the present hour. The
best informed people, strange as it may seem, know little more
of the geography of this country than they do of the interior of
Africa ; and thousands and thousands who move in respectable
society, are ignorant whether we are white or copper—colored,
speak the English language or Choctaw.

6. America, then, grew up in neglect and by stealth. Unat-
tractive to the higher classes, she drew to herself the people.
Here came the people, the hard-handed and stout-hearted, and
carved out a New World for themselves. They adapted their
institutions to their wants, and before the Old Wo1'ld was aware,
there had sprung up on this broad continent a gigantic Repub-
lic, ready to take her position among the nations of the earth.

1. Every other quality besides is subordinate and inferior
to wisdom, in the same sense as the mason who lays the bricks
and stones in a building, is inferior to the architect who drew
the plan and superintends the work. The former executes
only what the latter contrives and directs. Now, ‘it is the
prerogative of wisdom to preside over every inferior principle,
to regulate the exercise of every power, and limit the indulgence
of every appetite, as shall best conduce to one grand end. It
being the province of wisdom to preside, it sits as umpire on
every difﬁculty, and so gives the ﬁnal direction and control to
all the powers of our nature. Hence it is entitled to be con-
sidered as the top and summit of perfection. It belongs to
Wisdom to determine when to act, and when to cease,-—when to
reveal, and when to conceal a ~matter,—-—when to speak, and
when to keep silence,—when to give, and when to receive ; in
short, to regulate the measure of all things, as well as to de-
termine the end, and provide the means of obtaining the end,
pursued in every deliberate course of action.

2. Every particular faculty or skill, besides, needs to derive
direction from this; they are all quite incapable of directing
themse ves. The art of navigation, for instance, will teach us
to steer a ship across the ocean,'but it will never teach us on
what occasions it is proper to take a voyage. The art of war
will instruct us how to marshal an army, or to ﬁght a battle
to the greatest advantage, but you must learn from a higher

school when it is ﬁtting, just, and proper to wage war, or to
make peace. The art of the husbandman is to sow and bring
to maturity the preci.ous fruits of the earth ; it belongs to an-
other skill to regulate their consumption by a regard to our
health, fortune, and other circumstances. In short, there is no
faculty we can exert, no species of skill we can apply, but re-
quires a superintending hand,———but looks up, as it Were, ‘.0
some higher principle, as a maid to her mistress for direction,

and this universal superintendent is wisdom.

When in sublimest noon he sits;

Tell every light-winged mote that strays
Within his ample round of rays;

Tell all the leaves and all the buds,
That crown the gardens and the woods;
Tell all the spires of grass the meads
Produce, when spring propitious leads
The new-born year; tell all the drops
The night upon their bended tops
Sheds in soft silence, to display

Their beauties with the rising day; I
Tell all the sand the ocean laves,

Tell all its changes, all its Waves,

Or tell, with more laborious pains,

The drops its mighty mass contains. '

REMARK.'—-Qiuantlty is often mistaken for Pitch. But it
should be borne ‘in mind that quantity has reference to load-
ness or volume of sound, and pitch to thepelevation or depress-
ion of a tone. The difference may be distinguished by the
slight and heavy strokes on a bell :—-both of which produce
sounds alike in pitch ; but they differ in quantity or loudness,
in proportion as the strokes are light or heavy. -

from a whisper to a complete vocality, and are used to
express fear, caution, secrecy, solemnity, and all tender

which man must not look at it with the natural eye, but with
the immortal soul, and listen to its roaring, not with the. ears,
but with the heart: when we thus see it with the soul, and
hear it with the heart, then we understand it, that it is a mirror
in which the Creator glasses His own majesty, that it is the
revelation of that great mystery, that, in the boundless eternity
of time and space, is still going_ on ; that it is a great monitor
to the moral world, advising man that there is no difficulty over
which an iron will* can not prevail. V

.Niagara Falls to me._ Every element of physical nature, and

every element of spiritual life, has its destiny, and destiny must
be accomplished. The mighty waters of the always increasing
Erie Lake must have, and must make an outlet. Those waters
must ﬂow, and mankind must be free. Both are a destiny. A.
whim of nature barred the way to these waters by a mighty
range of rocks,—-—a.s crime and ambition barred the way to man-
kind’s liberty by a rocky range or” despotism; but the falling
waters broke the barrier of rocks; progressing liberty will break
the barrier of despotism. It is destiny.

rocks; and below the boiling foam of overcome toils, crowned
with the rainbow of Victory, and then, after Victory, ﬂowing on
in calm peace,——-when I saw the struggle, the victory, the rain-
bow, and the peace, a mysterious voice in the recess of my
heart told me, there is the mirror of my country’s cause. And

the rainbow over the foaming deep spoke to me as the rainbow‘

on the sky once spoke to Noah, and an inexpressible joy thrilled

silence, that eloquence of a deep, feeling heart.

STATE SOVEREIGNTY.
tionu 0. CALHOUN.

1. Is this a federal union? a union of Stated; as distinct from
that of individuals? Is the sovereignty in the several States, or
in the American people in the aggregate? The very language
which we arecompelled to use when speaking of our political
institutions, affords proof conclusive as to its real character.
The terms union, federal, united, all imply a combination "of
sovereignties, a confederation of States. They are never applied
to an association of individuals. Who everheard of the United
State of New York, of Massachusetts, or of Virginia? VVho
ever heard the term federal or union applied to the aggregation

of individuals into one community? Nor is the other point‘

less clear,———that the sovereignty is in the several',States, and, that
our system is a union of twenty-four sovereign powers, under a
constitutional compact, and not of a divided sovereignty between
the States.severally and the United States.

2. In spite of all that has been said, I maintain that sover-
eignty is in its nature indivisible. It is the supreme power in a
State, and we might just as well speak of half a square, or half
of a triangle, as of half a sovereignty. It is a gross error to
confound tl1e'e:ve7'cz'se of sovereign powers with s0ve4re2'.gmfy itself,
or the delegation of such powers with the sm'7~e~ncZe7° of them.
Asovereign may delegate his powers to be exercised by as many
agents as he may think proper, under such conditions, and with
such limitations, as he may impose ;‘ but to surrender any por-
tion of his sovereignty to another, is to annihilate the whole.

soning, which he says he can not comprehend. If by meta-
physics he means that scholastic reﬁnement which makes dis-
tinctions without difference, no one can hold it in more utter
contempt than I do; but if, on the contrary, he means the power
of analysis and combination,——that power which reduces the
most complex idea into its elements, which traces causes to
their ﬁrst principles, and, by the power of generalization and
combination, unites the whole in one harmonious system,——then,
so far from deserving contempt, it is the highest attribute of the
human mind. It is the power which raises man above the
brute,——which distinguishes his faculties from mere sagacity
which he holds in common with ‘inferior animals. *

4. It is this power which has raised the astronomer fromi

being a mere gazer at the stars to the high intellectual eminence
of a Newton or a Laplace, and astronomy itself, from a mere ob-
servation of. insulated facts, into’ that noble science which dis-
plays to our admiration thesystem of the universe. And shall
this high power of the mind, which has effected such wonders
when directed to the laws which control the material world, be
forever prohibited, under a senseless cry of metaphysics, from
being applied to the high purpose of political science and legis-
lation?

5. I hold them to be subject to laws’ as ﬁxed as matter itself,
and to be as ﬁt a subject for the application of the highest in-
tellectual power. Denunciation may, indeed, fall upon the
philosopliical inquirer into these ﬁrst principles, as it did upon
(;‘<a.lileo and Bacon when they first unfolded the great discover-
ies which have immortalized their names; but the time will
come when truth will prevail in spite of prejudice and denunci-
ation, and when politics and legislation will he considered as
much a science. as astronomy and chemistry.

PRESERVATION on THE UNION.
' A DANIEL WEBSTER.
1. Mr. PREsIDENT,——I have thus stated the reasons of my dis-

sent to the doctrines which have been advanced and maintained.

I am conscious of having detained you and the Senate much too
long. I was drawn into the debate with no previous delibera-
tion, such as is suited 'to the discussion of so grave and import-
ant a subject. But it is a subject of which my heart is full,
and I have not been willing. to suppress the utterance of its
spontaneous sentiments. I can not, even now, persuade myself

-to relinquish it, without expressing once more my deep con-

viction, that, ‘since it respects nothing less than the Union of
the States, it is of most vital and essential importance to the
public happiness. A

2. I profess, Sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept steadily in
View the prosperity and honor of the whole country, and the
preservation of our Federal Union. It is to that Union we owe
our safety at home, and our consideration and dignity abroad.
It is to that Union that we are indebted chieﬂy for whatever
makes us most proud of our country. That Union we reached
only by the discipline of our virtues in the severe school of ad-
versity. It had its origin in the necessities of disordered ﬁnance,
prostrate commerce, and ruined credit.

3. Under its benign inﬂuences, these great interests immedi-

U ately awoke, as from the dead, and sprang forth with newness

of life. Every year of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs
of its utility and its blessings; and, although our territory has
stretched out wider a.nd wider, and our population spread far-
ther and farther, they have not outrun its protection or its bene-
ﬁts. It has been to us all a copious fountain of national, social,
and personal happiness.

4. I have not allowed myself, Sir, to look beyond the Union,
to see what might lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have

bonds that unite us shall be broken asunder. I have not accus-
tomed myself to hang over the precipice of disunion, to see
whether, with my short sight, I can fathom the depth of the
abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe counselor in the
affairs of this government, whose thoughts should be mainly
bent on considering, not how the Union may be best preserved,
but how tolerable might be the condition of the people when it
should be broken up and destroyed. While the Union lasts,
We have high, exciting, gratifying prospects spread out before

us, for us and our children. Beyond that I seek not to pene- ,

trate the Vail. God grant that in my day, at least, that curtain
may not rise! God grant that on my vision never may be
opened What lies behind!

5. When my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time
the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken
and dishonored fragments of atonce glorious Union ; on States
dissevered, discordant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil
feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their
last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous en-
sign of the Republic, now known and honored throughout the

"earth, still full high advanced, its arms and trophies streaming

in their originial luster, not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a
single star obscured, bearing for its motto, no such miserable
inte1'r'ogatory as—-“ VVhat is all this Worth?” nor those. other
Words of delusion and folly,—“ Liberty ﬁrst and Union after-
ward ;” butevery where, spread all over in characters of living
light, blazing on all its ample folds, as they ﬂoat over the sea
and over the land, and in every wind under the whole heavens

DEATH OF DANIEL WEBSTER.
_ , non. —-— BUTLER.
1. MR. PRESIDENT :—This is an occasion full of interesting,

but melancholy associations, and one that especially appeals to

my feelings and sense of justice,——-I might almost say historical
justice,—-—as a Representative of South Carolina. W110 that
were present, can ever forget the mournful and imposing occa-
sion when Daniel Webster, whose eloquence and ability had
given distinction to the greatest deliberative assembly and the
most august tribunal of justice in this great Confederacy, and
when Henry Clay,-—a name that is associated with all that is
daring in a.ction and splendid in eloquence,—rose as witnesses
before the tribunal of history, and gave their testimony as to
the character and services of their illustrious compeer, John
Caldwell Calhoun, and embalmed in historical immortclity their
rival, associate and comrade?

2. I would that I could borrow from the spirit of my great
countryman something of its justice and magnanimity, that I
might make some requital for the distinguished tributes paid to
his memory by his illustrious compeers. Such an occasion as
the one I have referred to, is without parallel in the history of
this Senate, and, Sir, I fear that there is no future for such
another one. Calhoun, Clay, and ‘Webster,—-like Pitt, Fox,
and Burke,———have made a picture in our history that will be
looked upon as its culminating splendor. They were luminaries
that, in many points of view, differed from one another, but they
Were all stars of the ﬁrst magnitude. '

3. Distance can not destroy nor time diminish the simple
splendor of their light for the guidance and instruction of an ad-
miring posterity. Rivals they were in a great and eventful theater
of political life, but death has given them a common fame. Their
contest in life was for the awards of public opinion, the great
lower of modern times, by which nations are to be inﬂuenced.

Q U A L I T Y .

QUALITY has reference to the kind of sound uttered.
Two sounds may be alike in quantity and pitch, yet differ

_in quality. The sounds produced on the clarinet and ﬂute,

may agree in pitch and quantity, ‘yet be very unlike in qual-
ity. The same is often true in regard to the tones of the
Voice of two individuals. This difference is occasioned
mainly by the different positions of the Vocal organs.

The qualities of Voice mostly used in reading or speaking,
and which should receive the highest degree of culture, are
the Pure Tone, the Orotund, the Aspimleol, and the Gnttaoral.

RULES FOR QUALITY.

1. THE PURE TONE is a clear, smooth, sonorous ﬂow
of sound, usually accompanied with the middle pitch of
Voice, and is adapted to express emotions of joy, cheer-
fulness, love, and tmnguillizfy. T

“With more than mortal powers endowed,
How high they soared above the crowd I
Theirs was no common party race,

J ostling by dark intrigue for place;
Like fabled gods, their mighty war
Shook realms and nations in its jar.”

4. Before I became a member of the Senate of wlncil I
found Mr. Webster a distinguished ornament, I had formed a
very high estimate of his abilities, and from various sources of
high authority. His mind, remarkable for its large capacity,
was enriched with rare endowments, with the knowledge of a
statesman, the learning ofa jurist, and the attainments of a
scholar. In this chamber, with unsurpassed ability, Mr. Web-
ster has discussed the greatest subjectsthat have, or can inﬂu-
ence the destinies of this great Confederacy. ‘Nell may I apply
to him the striking remark which he bestowed on Mr. Calhoun,—-

“ We saw before us a Senator of Rome, when Rome survived.” .

5. I have always regarded Mr. Webster as a noble model of
a Parliamentary debater. His genial temper, the courtesy and
dignity of his deportment, his profound knowledge of his sub
ject, and his thorough preparation, gave him a great command,
not only over his immediate audience, but gave his masterly
speeches an impressive influence over public opinion. In the
Supreme Court Mr. Webster was engaged in the greatest cases
that were ever decided by that tribunal, and it is not too much
to ‘say, that his arguments formed the basis of some of the
ablest judgments of that Court. His exuberant, but rectiﬁed
imagination,“ and brilliant literary attainments", imparted to his

’ eloquence beauty, simplicity, and majesty, and the ﬁnish of

taste and elaboration. He seemed to prefer the more delibera-
tive style 01 speaking; but when roused, and assailed, became a
formidable adversary in the war of debate, discharging fromhis
full quiver the arrows of sarcasm and invective with telling
effect. , '

6. Mr. Webster was born in a forest, and in his childhood
and youth lived amid the scenes of rural life; and it was no

doubt under their inspiring inﬂuences that he imbibed that love
of nature, which has given such a charm and touching pathos
to some of his meditated productions. It always struck me
that he had something of Burns’ nature, but controlled by the
discipline of a higher degree of education.

7.. Lifted above the ordinary level of mankind by his genius
and intelligence, Mr. Webster looked upon a more extensive ho-
rizon than could be seen by those below him. He had too much
information from his various intercourse with great men, and his
acquaintance with the opinions of all ages through the medium
of books, to allow the spirit of bigotry to have a place in his
mind. I have many reasons to conclude that he was not only
tolerant of the opinions of others, but was even generous in his
judgments toward them. I will conclude by saying, that New
England, especially, and the Confederacy at large, have cause to
be proud of the fame of such a man.

INSENSIBILITY TO REAL DANGER NOT COURAGE.
, HAWKESWORTH.

1. Against insensibility to real danger we should not be less
watchful than against unreasonable fear. Fear, when it is
justly proportioned to its object, and not too strong to be gov-
erned by reason, is not only blameless, but honorable; it is es
sential to the perfection of human nature, and the mind
would be as defective without it as the body without a limb
Man is a being exposed to perpetual evil; every moment lia-
ble to destruction by innumerable accidents, which yet, if he
foresees, he can not frequently prevent : fear, therefore, Was im-
planted in his breast for his preservation; to warn him when
danger approaches, and to prevent his being precipitated upon
it either by vvantonness or inattention. - But those evils which,
without fear, we should not have foreseen, when fear becomes

excessive we are unable to shun ; for cowardice and presump-=
tion are equally fatal, and are frequently found in the same
mind.

2. —A peasant in the north of England had two sons, Thomas
and John. Thomas was taken to sea when he was very young,

I by the master of a small vessel, who lived at Hull ; and John

continued to work with his father till he was near thirty.
Thomas, who was now become master of a smack - himself,

i took his brother on board for London, and promised to pro-
‘ cure him some employment among the shipping on the water-

side. After they had been some hours under sail, the wind
became contrary, and blew very fresh ; the waves began imme-
diately to swell, and dashing with violence against the prow,
whitened into foam. n

3. The vessel which now plied to windward, lay so much to
one side, that the edge was frequently under water; and John,
who expected it to overset every moment, was seized with ter-
ror which he could not conceal. He earnestly requested of
Thomas that the sails might be taken in; and lamented the
folly that had exposedihim to the violence of a tempest, from
which he could not, without a miracle, escape. Thomas, with
a sovereign contempt of his pusillanimity, derided his distress;
and John, on the contray, admired the bravery of Thomas and
his crew from whose countenances and behavior he at length
derived some hope ; he believed he had deserved "the reproach
which he suffered, and despised himself for the fear which he
could not shake off. . e

4. In the mean time the gale increased, and in less than an
hour it blew a storm." John who watched every countenance
with the utmost attention and solicitude, thought that his fears
were now justiﬁed byithe looks of the sailors ; he, therefore, re-
newed his complaint, and perceiving his brother still uncon-
cerned, again entreated him to take every possible precaution,
and not increase their danger by presumption. In answer to
these remonstrances he received such consolation as one lord
of the creation frequently administers to another in the depth

of distress———“ Pshaw, you simpleton,” says Thomas, “ lon’t be
dead -hearted; the more sail we carry, the sooner we shall be
out of the weather.” X.

' 5. John’s fear had, indeed, been alarmed before he was in
danger; but Thomas was insensible of the danger when it ar-
rived he, therefore, continued his course, exulting in the supe-

iriority of his courage, and. anticipating the triumph of his

vanity when he should come on shore. But the sails being
still spread, a sudden gust bore away the mast, which, in its
fall, so much injured the helm that it became impossible to
steer, and, in a very short time afterward, the vessel struck.

6. The ﬁrst moment in which Thomas became sensible of dan-
ger, he was seen to be totally destitute of courage. When the
vessel struck, John who had been ordered under hatches, came
up, and found the hero whom he had so lately regarded with
humility and admiration, sitting on the quarter-deck, wringing
his hands, and uttering incoherent and clamorous exclamations.

7. ohn now appeared more calm than before, and asked if
any thing could yet be done to save their lives. Thomas rc-
plied in a frantic tone, that they might possibly ﬂoat to land
on some parts of the wreck; and catching up an ax, instead
of attempting to disengage the mast, he began to stave the
boat. John whose reason was still predominant, though he
had been afraid too soon, saw that Thomas, in his frenzy, was
about to cut off their last hope; he, therefore, caught hold of
his arm, took away the ax by force, assisted the sailors in get-
ting the boat into the water, persuaded his brother to quit the
vessel, and in about four hours they got safe on shore.

T8. If the vessel had weathered the storm, Thomas would
have been deemed a hero, and John a coward: but I hope
that none whom I have led into this train of thought, will,
for the future, regard insensibility to danger as an indication
of courage; or impute cowardice to those whose fear is not
inadequate to its object, or too violent to answer its purpose.

THE THREE WARNINGS.
‘ Mns.Tim.ALr.

1. The tree of deepest root is found

Least willing still to quit the ground;
’T was therefore said by ancient sages,
, That love of life increased with years
So much, that in our latter stages,
When pains grow sharp, and sickness rages,
The greatest love of life appears.
This great affection to believe,
Which all confess, but few perceive,
If old assertions can’t prevail,
Be pleased to hear a modern tale.

When sports Went round, and all Were gay,
On neighbor Dodson’s wedding-day, i
Death called aside the jocund groom
"With him into another room,

And looking grave,——“ You must,” says he,
“Quit your sweet bride, and come with me.”
“VVith you ! and quit my Susan’s side?
With you ?” the hapless husband cried;
“Young as I am, ’tis monstrous hardi
Besides, in truth, Pm not prepared:

My thoughts on other matters go ;

This is my wedding-day, you know.”

. VVhat more he urged I have not heard;

His reasons could not well be stronger;
So Death the poor delinquent spared,

And left to live a little longer.
Yet calling up a serious look,
His hour-glass trembled while he spoke,--—
“Neighbor,” he said, “farewell I no more
Shall Death disturb your mirthful hour;

And, farther, to avoid all blame

Of cruelty upon my name,

To give you time for preparation,

And ﬁt you for your future station,
Three several warnings you shall have,
Before you ’re summoned to the grave;
Willing for once I ’ll quit my prey,

, And grant a kind reprieve;

In hopes you ’ll have no more to say;
But, when I call again this way,

Well pleased the world will leave.”

To these conditions both consented,
And parted perfectly contented.

. VVhat next the hero of our tale befell,

How long he lived, how wise, how Well,
The Willing muse shall tell :
He chaffered, then he bought and sold,
Nor once perceived his growing old,
Nor thought of Death as_near :
His friends not false, his wife no shrew,
Many his gains, his children few,
He passed his hours in peace.
But, while he viewed his wealth increase,

‘ While thus alonglife’s dusty road,

The beaten track content he trod,
Old Time, whose haste no mortal spares,
Uncalled, unheeded, unawares,

Brought on his eightieth year.

. And now, one night, in musing mood,

As all alone he sate,
The unwelcome messenger of Fate-
Once more before him stood.

And you are now fourscore.”

“To spare the aged would be kind;

However, see your search be legal,
>And your authority+is ’t regal?

Else you are come on a fool’s errand,

"With but a_ Secretary’s warrant.*

Beside, you promised me Three Warnings,
VVhich I have looked for nights and mornings ;
But for that loss of time and ease,

I can recover damages.”

I seldom am a welcome guest;

But don’t be captious, friend, at least, I

I little thought you ’d still be able

To stump about your farm and stable:
Your years have run to a great length

I wish you joy, though, of your strength!”

I have been lame these four years past.”
“And no great wonder,” Death replies’;
“However, you still keep your eyes ;
And sure to see one’s loves and friends,
For legs and arms would make amends.”
“Perhaps,” says Dodson, “so it might,
But latterly I’ ve lost my sight.”
“This is a shocking tale, ’tis true ;.
But still there ’s comfort left for you :

cal fact ; and the human mind is more busy than ever in ex-
tending this prerogative.

2. Let us look in upon man while engaged in the very act
of adding to his natural strength these gigantic faculties. See
him yonder, bending over his stone mortar, and pounding,_ and
thumping, and sweating, to pulverize his ﬂinty grain into a
more esculent form. He stops and looks a moment into the
precipitous torrent thundering down its rocky channel. There I
A thought has struck him. He begins to whistle ; he whittles
some, for he learned to whittle soon after he learned to breathe.
He gears together, some horizontally, and others perpendicu-
larly, a score, of little wooden wheels. He sets them a going,
and claps his hands in triumph to See what they would do, if
a thousand times larger. ,

3. Look at him again. How proudly he stands, with folded
arms, looking at the huge things that are working for him!
He has made that wild, raging torrent as tame as his horse.

. He has taught it to walk backward and forward, he has given

it hands, and put the crank of his big wheel into them, and
made it turn his ponderous grindstone. What a taskmaster!
Look at him again I He is standing on the ocean beach, watch-
ing the crested billows as they move in martial squadrons over
the_ deep. He has conceived, or heard, that richer productions,
more delicious fruits and ﬂowers, may be found on yonder in-
visible shore. In an instant his mind sympathizes with the
yearnings of his physical nature.

4. See! there is a new thought in his eye. He remembers
how he ﬁrst saddled the horse; he now bits and ‘saddles the
mountain wave. Not satisﬁed with taming this proud ele-
ment, he breaks another into his service. Remembering his
mill-dam, he constructs a ﬂoating dam of canvas in the air,
to harness the winds to his ocean-wagon. Thus, with his
water-horse and air—horse harnessed in tandem, he drives across

the wilderness of waters with a team that would make old
Neptune hide his diminished head for envy, and sink his clumsy
chariot beneath the Waves. _

5. See now I he wants something else ; his appetite for
something better than he has, grows upon what he feeds on.
The fact is, he has plodded about in his one-horse wagon till
he is disgusted with his poor capacity of locomotion. The
wings of “Mercury, modern eagles and paper kites, are all too
impracticable for models. He settles down upon the persuasion
that he can make a great IRON HORSE, with bones of steel and
muscles of brass, that will run against time with Mercury, or
any other winged messenger of J ove,——the daring man!

6. He brings out his huge leviathan hexaped upon the track. .

How the giant creature struts forth from his stable, panting to
be gone! His great heart is a furnace of glowing coals; his
lymphatic blood is boiling in his veins; the strength of a
thousand horses is nerving his iron sinews. But his master
reins him in with one ﬁnger, till the whole of some Western
village, men, women, children, and half their horned cattle,
sheep, poultry, wheat, cheese and potatoes, have been stowed

away in that long train of wagonshe. has harnessed to his

foaming. stearn—horse. _

7. And now he shouts, interrogatively, ALL RIGHT? and, ap-
plying a burning goad to the huge creature, away. it thunders
over the iron road, breathing forth ﬁre and smoke in its indig-
nant haste to outstrip the wind. More terrible than the war-
horse in Scripture, clothed with louder thunder, and emitting a
cloud of ﬂame and burning coals from his iron nostrils, he
dashes on through dark mountain passes, over jutting precipices
and deep ravines. His tread shakes the earth like a traveling
Niagara, and the sound of his chariot-wheels warns the people
of distant towns that he is coming.

8. These are a few of the faculties which the human mind
has invented to increase our physical capacity, and improve
our physical condition. And they are the personal property
of every individual, and ever ready and able to put him into

.can procure. The steam-engine, the packet—ship, are my own

personal faculties, as much, yea more than they would be, if
they were an inseparable part of my being. They are far more
avai_able to me than if my feet were welded to each of them.
9. Therefore, all these artiﬁcial faculties,——every invention
and implement to give it a new capacity to labor,——every inch
of progress in the arts and sciences,-——every degree of intellect-
ual development that has been made since the birth of human-
ity,——have all been the result of that impulse of perpetual ac-
tivity which the yearning necessities of man’s physical nature
have communicated to his mind. To ameliorate our physical con-
dition, has been the inspiring object of every intellectual attain-
ment. It has led to the discovery of every principle of natural
philosophy and science; it has inspired every conception of taste,
prompted every act of patriotism and Christian philanthropy.
10. It was not to indulge a few mere intellectual abstrac-
tions, that the ancient shepherds and sailors clambered up into

for guide—boards to guide them bynight over the vast plains

ias and Praxiteles* were only bent on a mere diversion of the

EXERCISE CXXXV.

CONTRAST BETWEEN THE MIND AND MATERIAL FORMS.
CHANNING.

1. When we look at the organized productions of nature,
we see that they require only a limited time, and most of them
a very short time, to reach their perfection, and accomplish
their end. Take for example, that noble production, a tree.

Having reached a certain hight, and borne leaves,- ﬂowers, and

fruit, it has nothing more to do. Its powers are fully developed ;
it has no hidden capacities of which its buds and fruit are only
the beginnings and pledges. Its design is fulﬁlled ; the princi-
ple of life within it can effect no more. Not so the mind. VVe

- can never say of this, as of the full-grown tree in autumn,——it

has answered its end ; it has done its work ; its capacity is ex-
hausted. On the contrary, the nature, powers, desires, and
purposes of the mind are all undeﬁned. We never feel, when
a great intellect has risen to an original thought, or a vast dis-
covery, that it has now accomplished its whole purpose, reached
its bound, and can yield no other or higher fruits. On the con-
trary, our conviction of its resources is enlarged; we discern
more of its affinity to the inexhaustible intelligence of its Author.
In every step of its progress we see a new impulse gained, and
the pledge of nobler acquirements.

2. So, when a pure and resolute mind has made some great
sacriﬁce‘ to truth and duty, has manifested its attachment to
God and man in singular trials, we do not feel as if the whole
energy of virtuous principle were now put forth, as if the meas-
ure of excellence were ﬁlled, as if the maturest fruits were now

borne, and henceforth the soul could only repeat itself. VVe
feel, on the contrary, that virtue by illustrious efforts, replenishes,
instead of wasting its life; that the mind, by perseverance in
well doing, instead of sinking into a mechanical tameness, is
able to conceive of higher duties, is armed for a nobler daring,
and grows more eﬁicient in charity.

3. The mind, by going forward, does not reach insurmount-
able prison walls, but learns more and more the boundlessness
of its powers, and of the range for which it was created. Let
me place this topic in another light, which may show, even
more strongly, the contrast of the mind with the noblest pro-
ductions of matter. My meaning may best be conveyed by re-
verting to the tree. We consider the tree as having answered
its highest purpose when it yields a particular fruit. ' We judge
of its perfection by a ﬁxed, positive, deﬁnite product. The
mind, however, in proportion to its improvement, becomes con-
scious that its perfection consists not in ﬁxed, prescribed effects,
exact and deﬁned attainments, but in an original, creative, uncon-
ﬁnable energy, which yields new products, which carries into it
new ﬁelds of thought, and new efforts for religion and humanity.

4. This truth, indeed, is so obvious, that even the least im-
proved may discern it.‘ You all feel, that the ‘most perfect
mind is not that which works in a prescribed way, which thinks
and acts according to prescribed rules, but that which hasa
spring. of action in itself, which combines anew the knowledge
received from other minds, which explores its hidden and mul-
tiplied relations, and gives it forth in fresh and higher forms.
The perfection of the tree, then, lies in a precise or deﬁnite pro-
duct. That of the mind lies in an indeﬁnite and boundless en-
ergy. The ﬁrst implies limits. To set limits to the mind would
destroy that original power in which its perfection consists.
Here, then, we observe a distinction between material forms and
the mind; and from the destruction of the ﬁrst, which, as we
see, attain perfection and fulﬁll their purpose in a limited dura-
tion, we can 11ot argue to the destruction of the last, which
mainly possesses the capacity of a progress without end.

HIGH _SCH_OOL READER. 433

5. We have pointed out one contrast between the mind and
material forms. The latter, we have seen, by their nature have
bounds. The tree, in a short time, and by rising and spreading
a short distance, accomplishes its end. I now add that the
system of nature to which the tree belongs, requires that it
should stop where it does. ‘VVere it to gro_w forever, it would
be an inﬁnite mischief. A single plant, endued with the prin-
ciple of unlimited expansion, would in the progress of centuries
overshadow nations, and exclude every other growth,———would
exhaust the earth’s whole fertility. Material forms, then, must
have narrow bounds, and their usefulness requires that their
life and growth should often be arrested, even before reaching
the limits prescribed by nature.

6. But the indeﬁnite expansion of the mind, instead of war-
ring with and counteracting the system of creation, harmonizes
with and perfects it. One tree, should it grow forever, would
exclude other forms of vegetable life. One mind, in proportion
to its expansion, awakens, and in a sense creates other minds.
It multiplies, instead of exhausting, the nutriment which other
understandings need. A mind,the more it has of intellectual
and moral life, the more it spreads life and power around it.
It is an ever-enlarging. source of thought and love. Let me
here add that the mind, by unlimited growth, not only yields a.
greater amount of good to other beings, but produces continually
new forms of good._ This is an important distinction.

71¢ Were the tree to spread indeﬁnitely, it would abound
more in fruit, but in fruit of the same kind; and, by excluding
every other ‘growth, it would destroy the variety of products,
which now contribute to health and enjoyment. But the mind,
in its progress, is perpetually yielding new fruits, new forms of
thought, and virtue, and sanctity. It always contains within
itself the germs of higher inﬂuences than it has ever put forth,
the buds of fruits which it has never borne. Thus the very
reason which requires the limitation of material forms;-I mean
the good of the whole system,-——seems to require the unlimited
growth of mind-. ' V

CONFESSIONS OF A RETIRED TRADESM AN.
SAMUEL JOHNSON.
1. I have been for many years a trader in London. My be«
ginning was narrow, and my stock small; I was, therefore, a
long time brow—beaten and despised by those who, having more
money, thought they had more merit than myself. I did not,
however, suffer my resentment to instigate me to any mean arts
of supplantation, nor  eagerness for riches to betray me into
any indirect methods of gain; I pursued my business with in-

cessant assiduity, supported by the hope of being one day richer

than those who contemned me; and had, upon every annual re-
view of my books, the satisfaction of ﬁnding my fortune in-
creased beyond my expectation.

2. In a few years my industry and probity were fully recom-
pensed, my wealth was really great, and my reputation for
Wealth still" greater. I had large warehouses crowded with
goods, and considerable sums in the public funds; I was ca-
ressed upon the Exchange by the most eminent merchants; be-
came the oracle of the common council ; was solicited to engage
in all commercial undertakings; was ﬂattered with the hopes
of becoming in a short time one of the directors of a wealthy
company ; and, ‘to complete my mercantile honors, enjoyed the
expensive happiness of ﬁning for sheriff. 4*

3. Riches, you know, easily produce riches: when I had ar-
rived at this degree of wealth, I had no longer any obstruction
or opposition to fear: new acquisitions were hourly brought
within my reach, and I continued for some years longer to heap
thousands upon thousands.

4. At last I resolved to complete the circle of a citizen’s prcs~
perity by the purchase of an estate in the country, and to close
my, life in retirement. From the hour that this design entered
my imagination, I found the fatigues of my employment every
day more oppressive, and persuaded myself that I was no longer

equal to perpetual attention, and that my health would soon be
destroyed by the torment and distraction of extensive business.
I could image‘ to myself no happiness but in Vacant jollity,
and uninterrupted leisure; nor entertain my friends with any
other topic than the vexation and uncertainty of trade, and the
happiness of rural privacy. _

5. But notwithstanding these declarations, I could not, at
once, reconcile myself to the thoughts of ceasing to get money;
and, though I was every day inquiring for a purchase, I found
some reason for rejecting all that were oﬁfered me ; and, indeed,
had accumulated so many beauties and conveniences in my
idea of the spot, where I was ﬁnally to be happy, that, perhaps,
the world might have been traveled over, without discovery
of a place which would not have been defective.in some par-
ticular.

6. Thus I went on, still talking of retirement, and still refus-
ing to retire; my friends began to laugh at my delays, and I
grew ashamed to triﬂe longer with my own inclinations; an
estate was, at length, purchased, I transferred my stock to a pru-
dent young man who had married my daughter, went down
into the country, and commenced lord of a spacious manor.

7. Here, for some time, I found happiness equal to my expect-
ation. I reformed the old house according to the advice of the
best architects, I threw down the walls of the garden, and in-
closed it with palisades, planted long avenues of trees, ﬁlled a
green-house with exotic plants, dug a new canal, and threw the
earth into the old moat. The fame of these expensive improve-
ments brought in all the country to see the show. I entertained
my visitors with great liberality, led them round my gardens,
showed them my apartments, laid before them, plans for new
decorations, and was gratiﬁed by the wonder of some, and the
envy of others.

8. Iwas envied; but how little can one man judge of the
condition of another? The time was now coming in which af-
fluence and splendor could no longer make me pleased with
myself. I had built till the imagination of the architect was

exhausted ; I had added one convenience tn another, till I knew
not what more to wish or to design; I had laid out my gardens,
planted my park, and completed my water-works; and what
now remained to be done ? what, but to look up to turrets of
which, when they were once raised, I had no further use, to
range over apartments where time was tarnishing the furniture,
to stand by the cascade of which I now scarcely perceived the
sound, and to watch the growth of woods that must give their
shade to a distant generation.

9. In this gloomy inactivity, is every day begun and ended.
The happiness that I have been so long procuring, is now at an

end, because it has been procured; I wander from room to room -

till I am weary of ’ myself ; I ride out to a neighboring hill in
the center of iny estate, from whence all my lands lie in pros-
pect round me ; I see nothing that I have not seen before, and
return home disappointed, though I knew that I had nothing to
expect. 4 i

10. In my happy days of business, I had been accustomed to
rise early in the morning; and remember the time when I
grieved that the night came sosoon upon me, and obliged me
for a few hours to shut out affluence and prosperity. I now

seldom see the rising su_n, but to “tell him,” with the fallen 1

angel, “how I hate his beams.” I awake from sleep as to ian~
guor or imprisonment, and have no employment for the first
hour but to consider by what art I shall rid myself of the sec-
ond. I protract the breakfast as long as I can, because when it
is ended I have no call for my attention, till I can, with snrne
degree of decency, grow impatient for my dinner. If I could
dine all my life, I should be happy: I eat not because I an:
hungry, but because I am idle : but, alas! the time quickly
comes when I can eat no longer; and so ill does my constitu-
tion second my inclination, that I can not bear strong liquors 1
seven hours must then be endured before I sh all sup, but sup-
per comes at last, the more welcome as it is in a short time suc-
aeeded by sleep. I

from the duties and pleasures of a mercantile life. I shall be
told by those who read my narrative, that there are many
means of innocent amusement, and many schemes of useful em-
ployment, which I do not appear ever to have known ; and that
nature and art have provided pleasures by which, without the
drudgery of settled business, the active may be engaged, the
solitary soothed, and the social entertained.

12. These arts I have tried. When ﬁrst I took possession of
my estate, in conformity to the taste of my neighbors, I bought
guns and nets, ﬁlled my kennel with dogs, and my stable with
horses; but a little experience showed me, that these instru-
ments of rural felicity would afford me few gratiﬁcations. I
never shot but to miss the mark, and, to confess the truth, was
afraid of the ﬁre of my own gun. I could discover no music
in the cry of the dogs, nor could divest myself of pity for the
animal whose peaceful and inoffensive life was sacriﬁced to our
sport. I was not, indeed, always at leisure to reﬁect upon her
danger; for my horse which had been bred to the chase, did
not always regard my choice either of speed or way, but leaped
hedges and ditchesat his own discretion, and hurried me along
with the dogs, to the great diversion of my brother sportsmen.
His eagerness of pursuit once incited him to swim a river; and
I had leisure to resolve in the water, that I would never hazard
my life again for the destruction of a hare.

13. I then ordered books to be procured; and, by the direc~

tion of the vicar, had in a few weeks a closet elegantly fur-'

nished. You will, perhaps, be surprised when  shall tell you,
that when once I had ranged them according to their sizes, and
piled them up in regular gradations, I had received all the
pleasure which they could give me. I am not able to excite in
myself any curiosity after events which have been long passed
and in which I can, therefore, have no interest : I am utterly
unconcerned to know whether Tully or Demosthenes excelled
in oratory, whether Hannibal lost Italy by his own negligence,
or the corruption of his countrymen. /I. have no skill in con-
troversial learning, nor can conceive why so many volumes

should have been Written upon questions which I have lived so
long and so happily without understanding. I once resolved to
go through the volumes relating to the office of justice of the
peace, but found them so crabbed and intricate, that in less
than a month I desisted in despair, and resolved to supply my
deﬁciencies by paying a competent salary to a skillful clerk.

14. I am naturally inclined to hospitality, and, for some time,
kept up a constant intercourse of visits with the neighboring
gentlemen ; but, though they are easily brought about me by
better wine than they ca.n ﬁnd at any other house, I am not
much relieved by their conversation ; they have no skill in com-
merce or the stocks, and I have no knowledge of the history of
families or the factions of the country; so that when the ﬁrst
civilities are over, they usually talk to one another, and I am
left alone in the midst of the company. Such is the life to
which I am condemned by a foolish endeavor to be happy by
imitation; such is the happiness to which I pleased myself
with approaching, and which I considered as the chief end of
my cares and my labors. I toiled year after year with cheer-
fulness, in expectation of the happy hour in which I might be
idle; the privilege of idleness is attained, but has notbrought
with it the blessing of tranquillity.

’Gainst Richard, on his mission to free the Holy Land.
So, in the gloomy prison, the fettered captive lay,
And there in weak complainings he wore the time away.

3. “For me to be thus treated,-0 bitter, burning shame !
Of what avail my kingdom, my princely state, and ‘name?

And, like a slave, they ’ve bound me with heavy iron chains;
I Would, e’en in ‘my prison, be treated like a king,-—
Unbind my chains, ye tyrants,—aWay my fetters ﬂing I”

5. They brought these Words to Richard ; the monarch laughed
outright,—— .
“ Now make ye chains of silver,—of silver pure and bright,
And bear them to his prison; for, by the cross I swear,
His royal limbs no other than royal chains shall Wear.

6. “ The blood of kings and monarchs more pleasantly may ﬂow «

’Neath chains of burnished silver ; then to your captive go,
And tell him that King Richard, as mindful of his state,
Would treat him as becometh a prince so wise and great.”

7. They Went into his prison, unloosed his iron bands,
And clasped the silver fetters upon his royal hands;
‘Well pleased, the captive saw them,—the captive vain and
weak,—
No rage burned in his boso1;n,——no shame upon his cheek.

took ample vengeance. The Greek prince, being thrown into prison, and

loaded with irons, complained. of the little regard with which he Was

and this emperor, pleased with the distinction, expressed a sense of the
generosity of his conqueror.

In who obtain defense, or who defend,

In him who is, or him who ﬁnds a friend :
Heaven breathes through every member of the Whole
One common blessing, as one common soul.

But fortune’s gifts, if each alike possessed,

And each were equal, must not all contest?

If then to all men happiness was meant,

God in externals could not place content.

6. Fortune her gifts may variously dispose,

And these be happy called, unhappy those;

But Heaven’s just balance equal will appear,
While those are placed in hope, and these in fear :
Not present good or ill, the joy or curse,

But future views of better or of worse.

O sons of earth I attempt ye still to rise,

By mountains piled on mountains, to the skies 3
Heaven still with laughter the vain toil surveys,
And buries madmen in the heaps they raise.

Or God and nature meant to mere mankind,

THE LIVE-OAK.
HENRY R. JACKSON.
1. With his gnarled old arms, and his iron form,
Majestic in the wood,
From age to age, in the sun and storm,
The live-oak long hath stood ;-
With his stately air, that grave old tree,
He stands like a hooded monk,
With the gray moss waving solemnly
From his shaggy limbs and trunk.

2 And the generations come and go,
And still he stands upright,
And he sternly looks on the wood below,
As conscious of his might.
But a mourner sad is the hoary tree,
A mourner sad and lone,
And is clothed in funeral drapery‘
For the long since dead and gone.

THE DIGNITY or USEFULNESS.
ROBERT CHAMBERS.

1. “Human enjoyments are only to be secured by human la-
bor.” Few, perhaps, are aware how truly this is the case. The
rough ‘materials given by the Creator, including the surface of
the earth, are in comparison a triﬂe. It is by the power and
disposition of man to labor that the great end has mainly been
secured. All except a very small portion of the value of a
piece of ground arises from the improvements and adaptations
which human labor ha.s Wrought in it. Even the agencies of
heat, moisture, and other natural conditions, by which the pro-
duction of food is so much affected, work undera direction
and modiﬁcation from human ingenuity, skill, and industry.

2. The exertion of man’s hand and brain————hoW, then, can
it be degrading? The very means appointed by the Author of
nature for the support of his subject n1illions———how can there
be any thing despicable about it ? All right and manlyifeeling
revolts from such an idea. The human mind is so consti-
tuted, that all the great institutions of nature, when explained
and ascertained, appear to it just and noble. Such is the light
in which ,a correctly—informed and correctlyjudging mind
must unquestionably regard this as Well as other institutioa s.
Only through a blind ignorance or a vicious prejudice, can it
ever be for a moment held as in any respect mean.

3. This view is fortiﬁed by the actual state of feeling which
accompanies the performance of useful labor in all Well—consti-
tuted minds. It is no matter What the labor may be,—whether
the exercise of high intellectual faculties in the professions, or
the exertion of mere bodily strength toward some compara-
tively humble purpose,~——one well—recognized feeling of a most
agreeable kind attends it. It would be difficult thoroughly
to analyze this feeling. It is one of serene self—satisfaction; it
includes a consciousness of rectitude ; it compreh ends the hope

of beneﬁcial results, and, perhaps, in particular, the beneﬁt of
some much dearer than one’s self. The approbation of fellow-
creatures is contemplated as a right secured.

4. But there is something more in it than all this. There

, is in it a sense of cZi_gnity,—a kind of pride, but one free from

the usual earthly dross,——which We feel elevating us even in
the midst of the meanest drudgeries. Is it too much to sup-
pose that this is a sense standing by itself in our nature, ‘mys-
teriously in harmony with that very institution, which declares
labor to be the only source of the means of enj oyment,—-—prompted
by the Author of that institution,—and contemplated in the
designs of Providence as necessary to stimulate and sustain us
in the duties which We must perform, if We would live.

5. Different kinds of business have different degrees of im-
portance attached to them, generally in proportion to the na-
ture of the faculties Which they respectively call into operation.
This is quite natural, and, therefore, right. We unavoidably
look with greater respect on an exercise of the highest in.tel-
lectual powers, than on the exertion of the hands in some la-
bor calling for little skill. But the respectability of which va-
rious degrees are attached to different labors, is altogether in-
dependent of that general respectability, or rather dignity
which belongs to all labor.

_ ’6. All industry is respectable. It is only after allowing

_ this, that we begin to assign various degrees of another and far

less_ important respectability to different occupations. We
must be careful, then, not to lose sight of the dignity which
belongs to every honest man who gains his bread by his own
labors, however humble, in comparing him with some other
laborer who has a little more than he of the secondary dignity
arising from greaterimportance of function.

V 7. On this point some correction is, perhaps, needed in all
departments of society. The member of the upper classes is
apt to think only of the inferior degree of importance which
an inferior function gives to the mere operative, forgetting the
glory which shines on the head of the humblest being who,

HIGH SCHOOL READER, 447

through conscientious discharge of duties, makes himself inde-
pendent; and the operative himself too rarely, perhaps, thinks
on this, When he compares his own degree of the other kind
of dignity with what is enjoyed by others. VVere the whole
case rightly understood and regarded on all hands, we should
probably see the humbler classes the better for it. VVith less
to complain of, and elevated in their own esteem, their feelings
and their virtues would rise in the scale, and some existing
evils might be diminished. '

8. When we consider the matter in this light,'it must ap-
pear a much less hardship than it is generally thought, to be
obliged to descend to some labor inferior to that for which we
were originally designed. The kind of function we are to ex-
ercise in life depends on. native and acquired gifts, and favoring
circumstances. It would be bad political economy to willfully
devote a man to a function beneath the standard of his_ intel-
lect and education; but it may often happen to be unavoida-
‘ole that such a misapplication should be made. Wlien this
is the case, a consideration of the dignity which attaches to
all usefulness may help to reconcile him to the necessity.

9. On the one hand, he may see a presumed degradation,
according to the more superﬁcial ideas of the world; but on
the other, there is the “glorious privilege of being independ-
ent,” with all the delightful sensations which attend the con-
scientious performance of every kind of useful labor. Can the
one be for a moment seriously compared to the other ?——idle-
ness and real ignominy, against industry and genuine dig-

nity? Unquestionably, it is the duty of every man, to him-

self and society, to go down in its scale until he ﬁnds a means
of useful employment. Let his independence be the ﬁrst con-
sideration. That will give the ﬁrst and truest dignity. In the
other kind, he will be sure to advance, if he possess the appro-
priate merits. But, though he never should afterwards take a
single step upward, has he not attained the principal object?
10. There are two classes of persons for whom it might be
well, in an especial degree, to vindicate the dignity of useful-

ness. It often ‘happens that a man attains distinction from
the exertion of his intellect, and acquires respect as one who
confers blessings on his fellow—creatures, while, from these ex-
ertions not being proﬁtable in money, he is obliged all the
time to continue his originally humble efforts as a tradesman,
in order to gain the means of subsistence. Thus, for example,
Williain Godwin, while engaged in writing many remarkable
works, was obliged for bread to keep a bookseller’s shop.
Franklin continued to be a printer for his own personal sup-
port, while rendering such service to the commonwealth as
gained him the credit of a public benefactor. Milton, while
penning some of the tracts which were acknowledged to have
great effect in public affairs, was contented to live mainly by
teaching a few young men in his own house. At this mo-
ment there is a poet of great merit at Agen, in the south of
France,——the Burns, indeed, of his province; but M. Jasmin,
while multitudes delight in his writings and sound his praises,
is happy to exercise in a little shop his original profession of
a hair-dresser, and there receives daily, with modest dignity, the
visits of persons of rank who come to pay their respects to him.

11. It may appear hard that a man of superior intellect
should be condemned to humble drudgeries for the sake of sub-
sistence: there may appear a strange inconsistency between
the man as a poet, a moralist, or a leading political charac-
ter, and the man as one of the common herd of the children
of toil. But, on the other hand, it must appear as a great
matter that such a man, while using certain gifts for the pleas-
ure, instruction, and service of mankind, and receiving their
gratitude and applause in return, can, also, by the exertion of
certain (it may be) inferior gifts, secure his own independence.
Of this Paul was well aware, and there are few facts more in-
teresting or affecting in the whole range of sacred or profane
biography than that of this illustrious apostle working with
his hands at a trade, that he might be a burden to no one, at
the very time when he was engaged in the most important

-moral mission that ever human being entered upon.

12. How could such a man,———-how could any apostle, phi-
losopher, or poet, of any age or country,——be degraded by do-
ing that which was the readiest means of sparing the extra
labors of others? On the contrary, there is an additional dig-
nity in the good sense and manly feeling which dictate such a
course. He has the dignity of submitting to what rigid vir-
tue makes a necessity; he has the dignity of being useful in
the most unequivocal manner; and, in thus securing the sup»
ply of his own Wants, he presents the best assurance that could
be desired of the disinterestedness of his offers of public
service.

13. The other class for whom my remarks might have a
special use, are those Whom fortune has placed above the ne-
cessity of exertion on their own account. This is the very
class among whom individuals are most likely to be found, who
think useful employment of any kind beneath their dignity.
Those who form this notion, unquestionably commit a great
mistake. It is quite contrary to the practice of many persons
of exalted rank and great afﬂuence, whom the World esteems
as among the very iﬁrst of their class. These persons, from
the share they take in public business of all kinds, from legis-
lation down to the repair of roads, prove that it is possible to
be useful without in the least detracting from their dignity.
And how could it be otherwise? Surely it would be strange
indeed, if the doing of acts beneﬁcial to mankind were to prove
unavoidably the means of losing their respect. But nature has
ordered the matter quite otherwise, and, without seeing her
hand in the matter, we are compelled by her to reverence that
which tends to our good. ~

14. An idle and vacant life, even with all the aid that
amusements can give, is not calculated to be a happy one, and
this simply because Providence has constituted us With a View
to activity, as what was to be the means of accommodating the
raw materials of the physical World to our needs. Idleness,
therefore, unavoidably injures and disorganizes, while activity
alone will preserve health or secure the prolongation of life.

nals, but they are solitudes. The pilgrim from other lands
may go up to visit them, but it is for what they have been,
and not for what they are. It is not to survey a prosperous
country and a happy people; but to meditate upon the insta-
bility of human power, where the foundations of power were
the deepest and the broadest.

mael, sitting upon the ruins of Baalbec, himself a ruin, not
less marked and melancholy than they. Think you that vis-

race for cénturies? Think you that such dreams, waking

acteristic attributes. It is this that draws the footsteps of the
wild Indian to his wide and boundless desert—paths, and makes
him prefer them to the gay saloons and soft carpets of sumptu-
ous palaces. It is this that .makes it so difficult to bring him
within the pale of artiﬁcial civilization.

2. Our roving tribes are perishing,——a sad and solitary sacri--
ﬁce upon the altar of their Wild freedom. They come among
us, and look with childish wonder upon the perfection of our
arts, and the splendor of our habitations; they submit with
ennui and weariness, for a few days, to our burdensome forms
and restraints ; and then turn their faces to their forest homes,
and resolve to push those homes onward till they sink in the
Paciﬁc waves, rather than not be free.

3. It is thus that every people is attached to its country, just
in proportion as it is free. No matter if that country be in the
rocky fastnesses of Switzerland, amid the snows of Tartary, or
on the most barren and lonely island shore; no matter if that
country be so poor as to force away its children to other and
richer lands for employment and sustenance; yet when the
songs of those free homes chance to fall upon the exile’s ear, no
soft and ravishing airs, that _wait upon the timid feastings of
Asiatic opulence, ever thrilled the heart with such mingled rap-
ture and agony as those simple tones. Sad mementoes might
they be of poverty and want and ‘toil; yet it was enough that
they were mementoes of happy freedom. And more than once
has it been necessary to forbid by military orders, in the armies
of the Swiss mercenaries, the singing of their native songs.

4. And such an attachment, do I believe, is found in our own
people to their native country. It is the country of the free ;
and that single consideration compensates for the want of many
advantages which other countries possess over us. And glad
am I that itopens wide its hospitable gates,'to many a noble
but persecuted citizen, from the dungeons of Austria and Italy,
and the imprisoning castles and citadels of Poland. Here may
they ﬁnd rest, as they surely ﬁnd sympathy though it is sad-

is set by the common weal ;——-subject to no law but that which
conscience binds upon me; and I will bless my country, and
love its most rugged rocks, and its most barren soil.

6. I have seen my countrymen, and have been with them a

softens into life, and painting sheds an almost living presence
of beauty around it,———why, from the mountain’s awful brow, and
the lovely valleys and lakes touched with the sunset hues of old
romance,——why, from those venerable and touching ruins to

And the light in her eye, and the light on the wheels,
That marched so calmly round above her,
Was a little dimrned,--—as when evening steals
Upon noon’s hot face :——yet one could n’t but love her,
For she looked like a mother whose ﬁrst babe lay,
Rocked on her breast, as she swung. all day ;
And she seemed in the same silver tone to say,-—
“ Passing away I passing away I”

Stooping and staffed was her withered frame,
Yetjust as busily swung she on ;

The garland beneath her had fallen to dust;

The wheels above her were eaten with rust;

The hands that over the dial swept, .
Grew crooked and tarnished, but on they kept,
And still there came that silver tone,

From the shriveled lips of the toothless crone,—-

Let me never forget to my dying day
The tone or the burden of her lay,——-

learn of Eternity; look down to it on the withering ﬂower, and
you learn of Time, yet with an analogy inﬁnitely inadequate.

2. Speak to the earth, and it will teach thee of Man. It will
teachthee that his visible existence,‘ in its longest and its widest
measures, is but ﬂeeting. It bears but few evidences of its
proudest races ; all that remain of them, are, here and there, a
few lettered pages, and a few moldered stones. The rest it has
swallowed up, and of them it has preserved neither note nor
name. Embosomed in immensity it rolls around the sun, and
now the clash of Alexander’s battles areino more to it than the
rattle that diverts a child, and the majesty of Caesar’s fortunes
as insigniﬁcant in its throng of interests as the story of a beg-
gar’s wants. It will teach thee that now, too, as ever, it con-
tinues to absorb the visible, that the pyramids shall crumble,
that cities shall turn to line dust, that men in time to come will
look in vain for Paris or London, that wolves shall howl where
monarchs feast, and that towered palaces shall arise where the
wild ﬂocks pasture. . _

8. Speak to the earth, and it will teach thee that these, too,
will depart and be replaced; and that, when eras shall have
passed away, and be to other eras as if they never were, the
whole is not yet as a moment, even in the limited reckonings
of Time. Speak to the earth, and it will teach thee, that the
men who are now living around thee, who now constitute the
lousy population of the globe,-—the wise, the great, the good,

Znourly falling into the abyss of atoms,——as well as the ignorant,

abases thy pride; it does not awaken thy faith, it forbids pre-
sumption, it does not instruct for preparation. Speak to the
earth, and it will not teach thee of the great plan which includes
all things, and which has a place and a worth for the infant’s
rattle as well as Alexander’s wars, a place for the beggar’s story
as well as for Caesar’s fortunes.

5. It will not teach thee of the supreme Wisdom by which
that plan is conceived, directed, and accomplished. It will not
teach thee of thine own relations to that plan, and how thou
mayst best fulﬁll them. For this, consult a Teacher that has a
voice, for earth to such desire -is dumb; consult Christ, and he
will teach thee truly; consult a Teacher that has a spirit, for
earth to such yearnings is lifeless; consult conscience, and fol»
low the promptings of its higher inspirations ; consult thy
mind in its full tranquillity, and respect the counsel which it
gives; consult experience when it is most likely to be impartial,
and take heed to its honest warnings and rebukes. A

6. Two kinds of agency enter into the discipline of life.
There are ﬁrst the elements that constitute the matter of life
itself. These elements are such as make the inward and out-
ward history of the individual being. Among these, for in-

stance, are our parentage, our early circumstances, our means
of instruction or our unavoidable ignorance, our advantages for

virtue or our exposure to vice, our examples for good or evil, our
peculiar tendencies and temperaments. Most of these begin
before we have ourselves any part of a voluntary nature in -them,
before we have any dominion over them. They, _in general, con-
tinue long to operate, before we undertake in any way to shape
or to guide them. In a multitude of cases, they meet with no
guidance or control whatever, either from without or from within.

7. In such cases, the result is speedily wrought out, and I
need not say that the result is, uniformly, one of suffering or of
sin. The matter which makes the history of life, continues
always, however, to be, also, an inﬂuence of life. The course of
our studies, the activity of our business, the nature of our opin»
ions, the nature of our friendships, the force of our affections,

4-GO SANDERS’NEW snnrns.

A
V

our health and sickness, our success or failure, our poverty or
wealth, or ideas of poverty and wealth,——all; in fact, that makes
the sum of our being, physical, social, moral, and spiritual.

8. The second kind of agency is that which we exercise of
ourselves, and upon ourselves. A man is thus both the object
and the agent of his own discipline. This kind of discipline
can not be too early begun, it can not be too late continued.
It may be too long deferred; but, however advanced the hour,
none at any time in the day of life should despair to commence
it. It is by this agency of ourselves, that we turn all things to
account, that we make them our true property. It is by this
agency that we draw all inﬂuences into the sphere of our in-
ward life, and cause them to become, in part, the substance of
that life. In proportion to the depth, the power and the compass
07 this agency, are the depth, power, and the compass of our life.

9. VVithout this agency, much passes around and near us,
that might be used to enlarge and to glorify our being,-—goes
wholly to waste, and to us is forever lost. Many a.n inﬂuence
that We allow to die, we might convert into living energy; and
many a good that is present, and at no cost but the taking of

it, we lose, because we never perceive it. And this is not all

the loss. But that which belongs essentially to ourselves, which
forms the very vitality of our souls, fails of its growth, its
strength, and its complete capacity.

10. Memories pass away in dreams, that might have been
turned to ﬁne principles, and resolves perish into vacancy, that,
it’ executed, might have been noble works. Designs are left to
sink into nothingness, that, if brought out to the light of reality,
might avert occurrences that will be pangs to the hour of death,
or be beneﬁts to many, and blessings to ourselves. , Intellectual
and spiritual advancement is thus prevented, the mind given
o’.'e1 to barrenness, and the character not enriched, seems even
worse and poorer than it is, either in motive or in fact.

11. But what, we may ask, is this discipline to act on? To
this we may oppose another question,———VVhat is any education
to act on, but on the human being, on the soul and its mani-

festations, on thought, on feeling, on habit, on conduct? It re-
quires some discipline to think, in the true sense, at all. VVe
might suppose that nothing was so easy as to tltink. VVl1at is
it? It requires not to move hand or foot, but to sit still an.d
ponder. It appears as if it needed but to let the brain work,
and let memory observe and register the result.

12. Certainly, ever and ever without ceasing, perceptions are
passing through the brain, and consciousness is without inter-
ruption, taking impregsions from the senses,—but to a.rrange
and concentrate these so as to extract an import from them for
judgment and the reason, this is the hardest task that man can
undertake, and it is the one of all others that he would avoid.
He Would, in_ general, dig or break stonesrather than do it.

13. Thought merely in itself being an exercise, that we most
sedulously shun, that we would by any means escape or evade,
it must be no common eﬁfort to think constantly, to think
Wisely, to think vigilantly, to think on matters which hold out
no immediate proﬁt or reward, things not palpable, and things
not seen. If thought on our most ordinary affairs is painful,
and what, if we could, we would not undergo, it is not to be
expected, that We should enter willingly on thought which con-
cerns mainly the order of our spiritual and moral being. A

14. It is not then in the least startling, that our lives should
be full of mistakes, of errors, of prejudices, of unexamined gener-
alities, which we count for knowledge, and of ignorance, which
time only serves to render darker and more obstinate. For a
man to tlzink boldly around himself and within, is no small
courage, and it is only an occasionally brave and strong soul
that attempts it. It is a hard and self—denying toil. To test
>ur opinions by their external evidence or their intrinsic value;
to separate them from inﬂuences that, independently of their
value or their evidence, bind us strongly to them ; to review our
beliefs and motives; to estimate, without sophistry or illusion,
the consequences of our doings; to go through all this fully
and fairly, would seem little short of a mental martyrdom. And
yet the habit of a true moral wisdom is to be thus obtained.

On the young grass. My heart was touched with joy,
At so much beauty, ﬂushing every hour

And this soft wind, the herald of the green,

Luxuriant summer. Thou art yming, like them,

And well mayst thou rejoice. But While the ﬂight

Of seasons ﬁlls and knits thy spreading frame,

It withers mine, and thins my hair, and dims

These eyes whose fading light shall soon be quenched
In utter darkness. Hearest thou that bird ?”

abroad. Napoleon had. been the ﬁrst man of the World, if his
ends had been purely public. As he is, he inspires conﬁdence
and vigor by the extraordinary unity of his action.

2. He is ﬁrm, sure, self-denying, self»-postponing, sacriﬁcing
every thing to his aim,—money, troops, generals, and his own
safety, also ; not misled, like common adventurers, by the splen-
dor of nis own means. “Incidents ought not to govern policy,”
he said, “ but policy incidents.” “ To be hurried away by every
event, is to have no political system at all.” His victories
were only so many doors, and he never, for a moment, lost sight
of his way onward, in the dazzle and uproar of the present cir-
cumstance. He knew what to do, and he ﬂew to his mark.

3. He would shorten a straight line to come at his object.
Horrible anecdotes may, no doubt, be collected from his history,
of the price at which he bought his ‘successes; but he must not,
therefore, be set down as cruel, but only as one who knew no
impediment to his will ; not blood—thirsty, not cruel,—-—but woe
to what thing or person stood in his way; not blood—thirsty,
but not sparing of blo0d,———and pitiless. He saw only the ob-
ject: the obstacle must give Way. “Sire, General Clarke can
not combine with General J unot, for the dreadful ﬁre of the
Austrian battery.”—-—“ Let him carry the battery.”-—“ Sire, every
regiment that approaches the heavy artillery, is sacriﬁced.
Sire, what orders ?”-—“ Forward.’ FORVVARD !”

4. In the plenitude of his resources every obstacle seemed to
Vanish. “There shall be no Alps,” he said ; and he built. his
perfect roads, climbing by graded‘ galleries their steepest prec-
ipices, until Italy was as open to Paris as any town in ]3‘ranoe.
Having decided what was to be done, he did that with might
and main. He put out all his strength. He risked every
thing, and spared nothing,——--neither ammunition, nor money,
nor troops, nor generals, nor himself. If ﬁghting be the best
mode of adjusting national differences, (as large majorities of
men seem to agree,) certainly Bonaparte was right in making
it thorough. A

army ought always to be ready by day and by night, and at
all hours, to make all the resistance it is capable of making.”
He never economized his ammunition, but on a hostile position
rained a torrent of iron,——-shells, balls, grape—shot,—-—-to annihi-
late all defense. He went to the edge of his possibility, so
heartily bent was he on his object. It is plain that in Italy
he did what he could, and all that he could ; he came several
times within an inch of ruin, and his own person was all but
lost. He was ﬂung into the marsh at Arcola. The Austrians
were between him and his troops, in the mélée,* and ,_he was
brought off with desperate efforts. At Lonato, and at other
places, he was on the point of being taken prisoner.

6. He fought sixty battles. He had never enough. Each
victory was as a new weapon. “My power would fall, were I
not to support it by new achievements. Conquest has made
me What I am, and conquest must maintain me.” He felt, with
every wise . man, that as much life is needed for conservation
as for creation. We are always in peril, always in a bad
plight, just on the edge "of destruction, andonly to be saved by
invention and courage. This vigor was guarded and tempered
by the "coldest prudence and punctuality. A thunderbolt in

' the attack, he was found invulnerable in his intrenchments.

His very attack was never the inspiration of courage, but the
result of calculation. His idea of the best defense consisted in
being still the attacking party. “My ambition,” he says, “ was
great, but was of a cold nature.”

7. Every thing depended on the nicety of his combinations ;"

the stars were not more punctual than his arithmetic. . His
personal attention descended to the smallest particulars. “At
Montebello‘ I ordered Kellermann to attack with eight hundred
horse, and with these he separated the six thousand Hungarian
grenadiers before the very eyes of the Austrian cavalry. This
cavalry was half a league off, and required ‘gt quarter of an
hour to arrive on the ﬁeld of action, and I have observed it is
always those quarters of an hour that decide the fate of a battle.”

8. Beft re he fought a battle, Bonaparte thought little about
what he should do in case of success, but a great deal about
what he should do in case of a reverse of fortune. The same
prudence and good sense marked all his behavior. His in»
structions to his secretary at the Tuileries* are worth remem-
bering :——-“ During the night, enter my chamber as seldom as
possible. Do not awake me when you have any good news to
communicate; with that there is no hurry. But when you
bring bad news, rouse me instantly, for then there is not a mo-
ment to be lost.” His achievement of business was immense,
and enlarges the known powers »of men. There have been

many working kings, from Ulysses to William of Orange, but '

none who accomplished a tithe of this man’s performance.

9. To these gifts of nature Napoleon added the advantage
of having been born to a private and humble fortune. In his
later days he had the weakness of wishing to add to his crowns
and badges the prescription of aristocracy; but he knew his
debt to his austere education, and made no secret of his con-
tempt for the born kings, and for “the hereditary donkeys,”
as he coarsely styled the Bourbons. He said, that in their ex-
ile “they had learned nothing, and forgot nothing.” Bona-

I parte had passed through all the degrees of military service;

but, also, was citizen before ‘he was Emperor, and so had the
key to citizenship. His remarks and estimates discovered
the information and justness of measurement of the middle

' class.

10. Those who had to deal with him found that he was not
to be imposed upon, but could cipher as well as another man.
When the expenses” of the Empress, of his household, of his

. palaces, had accumulated great debts, Napoleon examined the

bills of the creditors himself, detected overcharges, errors, and
reduced the claims by considerable sums. His grand weapon,
namely, the millions whom he directed, he owed to the repre-
sentative character which clothed him. . He interests us as he
stands for France and for Europe; and he exists as Captain

and King only as far as the Revolution, or the interest of the
industrious masses, found an organ and a leader in him.

11. In the-social interests he knew the meaning and value
of labor, and threw himself naturally on that side. The prin-
cipal works that have survived him are his magniﬁcent roads.
He ﬁlled the troops with his spirit, and a sort of freedom and
companionship grew up between him and them, which the
forms of his court never permitted between the ofﬁcers and
himself. They performed under his eye that which no others
coulddo. The best document of his relation to his troops is
the order of the day on the morning of the battle of Auster-
litz, in which Napoleon promises the troops that he will keep
his person out of reach of ﬁre. This “declaration which is the
reverse of that ordinarily made by generals and sovereigns on
the eve of a battle, suﬁiciently explains the devotion of the
army to their leader.

12. But, though there is in particulars, this identity between
Napoleon and the mass of the people, his real strength lay in
their conviction that he was their representative, in his genius
and aims, not only when he courted, but when he controlled,

' and even when he decimated them by his conscriptions. The

people felt that no longer the throne was occupied, and the land
sucked of all its nourishme_nt, by a small classof legitimates
secluded from all community with the children of the soil, and
holding the ideas and superstitions of a long—forgotten state of
society: instead of that vampire, a man of themselves held in
the Tuileries, knowledge and ideas like their own, opening of
course, to them and their children, all places of power -and
trust; the day of sleepy, selﬁsh policy, ever narrowing the
means and opportunities of young men, was ended, and a day
of expansion and demand was come. A market for all the
powers and productions of men was opened; brilliant prizes
glittered in the eyes of youth and talent. '

CREATION, THE PRODUCT OF DIVINE GOODNESS.
BLAIR.

]. Creation is a display of Supreme goodness, no less than
of wisdom and power. It is the communication of numberless
beneﬁts, together with existence, to all who live. ustly is the
earth said to be “ full of the goodness of the Lord.” Through
out the whole system of things, we behold a manifest tendency
to promote the beneﬁt either of the rational, or the animal
creation. In some parts of nature, this tendency may be less
obvious than in others. . _

2. Objects which to us,seem useless or hurtful, may some-
times occur; and strange it were, if in so vast and complicated
a system, diﬁiculties of this kind should not occasionallypresent
themselves to beings whose views are so narrow and limited as
ours. It is well known that in proportion as the knowledge
of nature has increased among men, these diﬂiculties have di-
minished. -. Satisfactory accounts have been given of many per-
plexing appearances. Useful and proper purposes have been
found to be promoted by objects which were, at ﬁrst, thought
unproﬁtable or noxious.

3. Malignant must be the mind of that person ; with a dis-
torted eye he must have contemplated creation, who can sus-
pect that it is not the production of Inﬁnite Benignity and Good-
ness. How many clear marks of benevolent intention appear,
everywhere around us 1 What a profusion of beauty and orna-
ment is poured forth on the face of nature ! What a magniﬁ-
cent spectacle presented to the View of man! What supply
contrived for his wants! What a variety of objects set before
him, to gratify his senses, to employ his understanding, to en-
tertain his imagination, to cheer and gladden his heart! Indeed,
the very existence of the universe is a standing memorial of the
goodness of the Creator. For nothing except goodness could
originally prompt creation.

4. The Supreme Being, self—ex1stent and all-suﬁicient, had no
wants which he could seek to supply. No new accession of
felicity or glory was to result to him from creatures which he

made. It _‘was goodness communicating and pouring itself ‘

forth, goodness delighting to impart happiness in all its forms,
which in the beginning created the heaven and the earth.
Hence, those innumerable orders of living creatures with which
the earth is peopled; from the lowest class of sensitive being,
to the highest rank. of reason and intelligence. Wherever there
is life, there is some degree of happiness ; there are enjoyments
suited to" the diﬁ"erent powers of feeling; and earth, and air,
and water, are, with magniﬁcent liberality, made to teem with
life.

5. Let those striking displays of Creating Goodness call forth,
on our part, responsive love, gratitude and veneration. To this
great Father of all existence and life, to him who hath‘ raised
us up to behold the light of day, and to enjoy all the comforts
which his world presents, let our hearts send forth a perpetual
hymn of praise. Evening and morning let us celebrate him
who maketh the morning and the evening to rejoice over our
heads; who “ openeth his hand, and satisﬁeth the desire of
every living thing.”

6. Let us rejoice that we are brought into a World which is
the production of Inﬁnite Goodness, and over which a Supreme
Intelligence presides. Convinced that he hateth not the works
which he hath made, nor hath brought. creatures into existence,
merely to suffer unnecessary pain, let us, even in the midst of
sorrow, receive, with calm submission, whatever he is pleased
to send: thankful for what he bestows, and satisﬁed, that, with»
out good reason, he takes nothing away.

7. It is not in the tremendous appearances of power, merely,
that ‘a good and well-instructed man beholds the Creator of the
world. In the constant and regular woiking of his hands, in
the silent operations of his wisdom and goodness, ever. going on
throughout nature, he delights to contemplate and adore him.
This is one of the chief fruits to be derived from that more per-

butes, as not wise and great only, but as gracious, and merciful,
let it lead us to View every object of calm and undisturbed na-
ture, with a perpetual reference to its Author. We shall then
behold all the scenes which the heavens and the earth present,
with more reﬁned feelings, and sublimer emotions, than they
who regard them solely as objects of curiosity, or amusement.
Nature will appear animated, and enlivened, by the presence of
its Author.

9. “Then the sun rises or sets in the heavens, when "spring
paints the earth, when summer shines in its glory, when autumn
pours forth its fruits, or winter returns to its awful forms, We
shall view the Creator manifesting himself in his works. We
shall meet his presence in the ﬁelds. We shall feel his inﬂu-
ence in the cheering beam. We shall hear his voice in the
wind. We shall behold ourselves everywhere surrounded with
the glory of that universal Spirit who ﬁlls, pervades, and up-
holds all. We shall live in the world as in a great and august
temple; where the presence of the Divinity, who inhabits it,
inspires devotion.

LABOR AND REST.
SAMUEL JOHNSON.
1. To oppose the devastations of Famine who scattered the
ground everywhere with carcasses, Labor came down upon
earth. Labor was the son of Necessity, the nursling of Hope,
and the pupil of Art; he had. the strength of Lis mother, the
spirit of his nurse, and the dexterity of his governess. His
face was wrinkled with the wind, and swarthy with the sun :

he had the implements of husbandry in one ‘hand, with which
. 21

he turned up the earth ; in the other he had the tools of archi-
tecture, and raised walls and towers at his pleasure. _

2. He called out with a rough voice,—-“ Mortals I see here the
power to whom you are consigned, and from whom you are
to hope for all your pleasures, and for all your safety. You
have long languished under the dominion of Rest, an impotent
and deceitful goddess, who can neither protect nor relieve you,
but resigns you to the ﬁrst attacks of either Famine or Dis-
ease, and suffers her shades to be invaded by every enemy, and
destroyed by every accident.

3. “ Awake, therefore,_ to the call of Labor. I will teach you

to remedy the sterility of the earth, and the severity of the
sky‘; I will compel summer to ﬁnd provisions for the winter ;
I will force the waters to give you their ﬁsh, the air its fowls,
and the forest its beasts; I will teach you to pierce the bow--
els of the earth, and bring out from the caverns of the mount-
ains metals which shall give strength to your hands, and se-
curity to your bodies, by which you may be covered from the
assaults of the ﬁercest beasts, and with which you shall fell
the oak, and divide rocks, and subject all nature to your use
and pleasure.”
L 4. Encouraged by this magniﬁcent invitation, the inhabitants
of the globe considered Labor as their only friend, and hasted
to his command. He led them out to the ﬁelds and mountains,
and showed them how to open mines, to level hills, to drain
marshes, and change the course of rivers. The face of things
was immediately transformed ; the land was covered with towns
and villages, encompassed with ﬁelds of corn, and plantations
of fI‘11lt-tI'8€S: and nothing was seen but heaps of grain, and
baskets of fruit, full tables, and crowded storehouses.

5. Thus Labor and his followers added, every hour, new ac-
quisitions to their conquests, and saw Famine gradually dis-
possessed of his dominions ;_ till, at last, amid their jollity and
triumphs, they were depressed and amazed by the approach of
Lassitude who was known by her sunk eyes and dejected
countenance. She came forward" trembling and groaning; at

every groan, the hearts of all those that beheld her, lost their
courage, their nerves slackened, their hands shook, and the in-
struments of labor fell from their grasp.

6. Shocked with this horrid phantom, they reﬂected with
regret on their easy compliance with the solicitations of Labor,
and began to wish again for the golden ‘hours which they re-
membered. to have passed under the reign of Rest,whom they
resolved again to visit, and to whom they intended to dedicate

the remaining part of their lives. Rest had not left the world; -

they quickly found her, and, to atone for their- former desertion,
invited her tothe enjoyment of those acquisitions which Labor
had procured them.

7 . Rest, therefore, took leave of the groves and valleys which
she had hitherto inhabited, and entered into palaces, reposed
herself in alcoves, and slumbered away the winter upon beds
of down, and the summer in artiﬁcial grottoes, with cascades
playing before her. There was, indeed, always something
wanting to complete her felicity, and she could never lull her
returning fugitives to that serenity which they knew before
their engagements with Labor ; nor was her_ dominion entirely
without control, for she was obliged to share it with Luxury,
though she always looked upon her as a false friend, by whom
her inﬂuence.was in reality destroyed, while it seemed to be
promoted. , _ , .

8. The two soft asscciates, however,’ reigned for some time
without visible disagreement, till, at last, Luxury betrayed her
charge, andlet in Disease to seize upon her worshipers. Rest
then ﬂew away,and left the place to the usurpers, who em‘
ployed all their arts to fortify themselves in their possession,
and to strengthen the interest of each other.

A 9. Rest had not always the same enemy; in some places
she escaped the incursions of Disease; but had her residence
invaded by a more slow and subtle intruder, for very frequently,

when every thing was composed and quiet, when there was nei»

ther pain within, nor danger without, when every ﬂower was in
bloom, and every gale freighted with perfumes, Satiety would

itself on every side; the groves immediately lost their verdure,
and their inhabitants desisted from their melody, the breeze
sunk in sighs, and the ﬂowers contracted their leaves, and shut
up their odors. Nothing was seen on every side but multitudes
wandering about, they knew not whither, in quest they knew
not of what; no voice was heard but of complaints that-men-
tioned no pain, and murmurs that could tell of no misfortune.

11. Rest had now lost her authority. Her followers again

began to treat her with contempt ; some of them united them-
selves more closely to Luxury who promised by her arts tc
drive Satiety away; and others that were more wise, or had
more fortitude, went back again to Labor, by whom they were,
indeed, protected from Satiety, but delivered up in time to Las-
situde, and forced by her to the bowers of Rest.

12. Thus Rest and Labor equally perceived their reign. of
short duration and uncertain tenure, and their empire liable to
inroads from those who were alike enemies to both. They
each found their subjects unfaithful, and ready to desert them
upon every opportunity. Labor saw the riches which he had
given,always carried away as an offering to Rest, and Rest found
her Votaries, in every exigence, ﬂying from her to beg help of
Labor. They, therefore, at last, ‘determined upon an interview

in which they agreed to divide the world between them, and

govern it alternately, allotting the dominion of the day to one,
and that of the night to the other, and promised to guard the
frontiers -of each other, so that, whenever hostilities were at»

tempted, Satiety should be intercepted by Labor, and Lassitude

expelled by Best.

cent temples, _that he might behold and admire those splendid
works of art with which, (notwithstanding that Marcellus had
made it his glory to carry not a few of them away with him for
the decoration of the Imperial City,) Syracuse still abounded, a.nd
which soon after tempted the cupidity, and fell a prey to the
rapacity of the infamous Verres.

3. Or, haply, they may have thought that he would be curi-
ous to see and examine the ear of Dionysius, as it was called,—--
a huge cavern, cut out of the solid rock in the shape of a human
ear, two hundred and ﬁfty feet long, and eighty feet high, in
which that execrable tyrant conﬁned all persons who came
within the range of his suspicion;-——and which was so ingen-

_iously contrived and constructed, that Dionysius, by applying

his own ear to a small hole, where the sounds were collected as

upon .a tympanum, could catch every syllable that was uttered a

in the cavern below, and could deal out his proscription and his
vengeance, accordingly, upon all who might dare to dispute his
authority, or to complain of his cruelty. _

4. Or they may have imagined, perhaps, that he would be
impatient to visit at once the sacred fountain of Arethusa,” and
the seat of those Sicilian Muses3 whom Virgil so soon after in-
voked in commencing that most inspired of all uninspired com-
positions, which Pope has so nobly paraphrased in his glowing
and glorious Eclogue,——the Messiah. To their great astonish-
ment, however, Cicero’s first request was, that they would take
him to see the tomb of Archimedes.‘ To his own still greater
astonishment, as we may well believe, they told him in reply,
that they knew nothing about the tomb of Archimedes, and had
no idea where it was to be found, and they even positively de-
nied that any such tomb was ‘still remaining among them.

5. But Cicero understood perfectly well what he was talking
about. He remembered the exact description of the toinb. He
remembered the very verses which had been inscribed on it.

He remembered the sphere and the cylinder which Archimedes
had himself requested to have wrought upon it, as the chosen
emblems of his eventful life. And the great orator forthwith re-
solved to make search for it himself.

6. Accordingly, he rambled out into the place of their ancient
sepulchers, and, after a careful investigation, he came, at last, to
a. spot overgrown with shrubs and bushes, where presently he
descried the top of a small column just rising above the branches.
Upon this little column the sphere and the cylinder were at
length found carved, the inscription was painfully deciphered,
and the tomb of Archimedes stood revealed to the reverent
homage of the illustrious Roman quaestor. _

7 . This was in the year 76 before the birth of our Savior.
Archimedes died about the year 212 before Christ.‘ One hun-
dred and thirty—six years’ only had thus elapsed, since the death
of this celebrated person,before his tombstone was buried up
beneath briers and brambles‘, and before the place and even

' the existence of it were forgotten by the magistrates of the very

cityof which he was so long the proudest ornamentin peace,
and the most effective defender in War.

8., What a lesson to human pride, what a commentary on
human gratitude, was here! It is an incident almost precisely
like that which the admirable and venerable Dr. Watts imagineel
or imitated, as the topic of one of his most striking and familiar
Lyrics :—- -

Theron, among his travels, found

A broken statue on the ground;

And searching onward as he went,

He traced a ruined monument.

Mold, moss, and shades had overgrown
The sculpture of the crumbling stone,
Yet ere he passed, with much ado,

He guessed, and spelled out, Sci-pi-0.
“Enough,” he cried; “ I ’ll drudge no more

I ’ll take a turn among the tombs,
And see whereto all glory comes.”

9. I do not learn, however, that Cicero was C1J.}t:(~" of his
eager Vanity and his insatiate love of fame by this “ turn” among
the Syracusan tombs. He was then only just at the threshold
of his proudcareer, and he Went back to pursue it to its bloody
end, with unabated zeal, and with an ambition only extinguish-
able with his life. '

10. And. after all, how richly. how surpassingly, was this
local ingratitude and neglect made up to the memory of Archim-
edes himself, by the opportunity which it afforded to the great-
est orator of the greatest empire of antiquity, to signalize his
appreciation and his admiration of that Wonderful genius, by
going out personally into the ancient ,_<{rave-yards of Syracuse,
and with the robes of olﬁce in their newest gloss around him,
to search for his tomb and to do honor to his ashes I The great-
est orator of Imperial Rome anticipating the part of Old Mor-

SPEECHES OF DANIEL WEBSTER.
_ E. P. WHIPPLE.

1. The speeches of Daniel Webster have a value and interest
apart from the time and occasion of their delivery; for they are
store-houses of thought and knowledge. The speaker descends
to no rhetorical tricks and shifts, he indulges in no parade of
ornament. A self—sustained intellectual might is impressed on
every page. He rarely confounds. the processes of reason and
imagination, even in those popular discourses intended to ope-
rate onlarge assemblies. He betrays no appetite for applause,
no desire to win attention byithe brisk life and momentary
sparkle of ﬂashing declamation.

2. Earnestness, solidity of judgment, elevation of sentiment,
broad and generous views of national policy, and a massive
strength of expression, characterize all his works. We feel, in
reading them, that he is a man of principles, not a man of
expedientsg that he never adopts opinions without subjecting
them to stern tests ; and that he recedes from them only at the
bidding of reason and experience. ‘He never seems to be play-
ing a part, but always acting a life. .

3. The ponderous strength of his powers strikes us not
more forcibly than the broad individuality of the man-. Were
we unacquainted with the history of his life, we could almost

infer it from his works. Every thing in his productions indi-
cates the character of a person who has struggled ﬁercely
against obstacles, who has developed his faculties by strenuous
labor, who has been a keen and active observer of man and
nature, and who has been disciplined in the affairs of the
world. There is a manly simplicity and clearness in his mind,
and a rugged energy in his feelings, which preserve him from
all the aﬁectations of literature and society.

4. He is great by original constitution. What nature orig’-
nally gave to him, nature has to some extent developed, strength-
ened, and stamped with her own signature. We never con-
sider  as a mere debater, a mere scholar, or a mere states-
man; but as a strong, sturdy, earnest man. The school and
the college could not fashion him into any foreign shape, be-
cause they worked on materials too hard to yield easily to con-
ventional molds.

5. The impression of power we obtain from Webster’s pro-
ductions,——a power not merely of the brain, but of the heart
and physical temperament, a power resulting from the mental
and bodily constitution of the whole man,—is the source of
his hold upon our respect and admiration. We feel that, un-
der any circumstances, in any condition of social life, and at
almost any period of time, his great capacity would have been
felt and acknowledged.

6. He does not appear, like many eminent men, to be more
peculiarly calculated for his own ‘age than for any other,——to
possess faculties and dispositions which might have rusted in
obscurity, had circumstances been less propitious. We are
sure that, as an old baron of the feudal time, as an early set-
tler of New England,‘ as a pioneer in the Western forests, he
would have been a Warwick, a Standish, or a Boon. His
childhood was passed in a small country village, where the
means of education were scanty, and at a period when the
country was rent with civil dissensions.

3. But fame can not be voted down, having its immediate
foundation in the essential. It is the eternal shadow of excel~
lence, from which it can never be separated, nor is it ever made
visible but in the light of an intellect kindred with that of its
author. It is that light by which the shadow is projected, that
is seen of the multitude, to be wondered at and reverenced,
even while so little comprehended as to be often confounded
with the substance,———the substance being admitted from the
shadow, as a matter of faith. It is the economy of Providence
to provide such lights: like rising and setting stars, they fol-
low each other through successive ages; and thus the menu-
mental form of Genius stands forever relieved against its own
irnperishable glory.

4. All excellence of every kind is but variety of truth. If we
wish, then, for something beyond the true, we wish for that
which is false. According to this test, how little truth is there
in art l 4 Little indeed I but how much is that little to him who
feels it! Fame does not depend on the will of any man, but
reputation may be given or taken away ; for Fame is the sym-
pathy of kindred intellects, and sympathy is not a subject of
willing ; while Reputation, having its source in the popular
voice, is a sentence which may either be uttered or suppressed
at pleasure. Reputation, being essentially contemporaneous, is
always at the mercy of the Envious and the’ Ignorant. But
Fame, whose very birth is posthumous, and which is only
known to exist by the echo of its footsteps th7~o*u,__.r/h congenial
me’-ncls, can neither be increased nor diminished by any degree
of willfulness.

5. What light is in the natural world, such is fame in the
intellectual ; both requiring an ar,tmo8_7ohe7°e in order to become
perceptible. -Hence the fame of Michael Angelo is, to some
minds, a_ nonentity ; even as the sun itself would be invisible in
mono. Fame has no necessary conjunction with praise : "t

i may exist without the breath of a word : it is a recognition .; '

excellence, which must be felt, but need not be spoken. Even
the envious must feel it, feel it, and hate it in silence.

instruction ; but Webster won his education by battling against
difficulties. “A dwarf behind a steam-engine can remove
mountains; but no dwarf can how them down with a pick-ax,
and he must be a Titan that hurls them abroad with his arms.”
Every step in that long journey, by which the son of the New
Hampshire farmer has obtained the highest rank in social and
political life, has been one of strenuous effort. The space is
crowded with incidents, and tells of obstacles sturdily met and
fairly overthrown. His life and his writings seem to bear tes-
timony, that he can perform whatever he strenuously attempts.

8. His words never seem disproportioned to his strength.
Indeed, he rather gives the impression that he has powers and
impulses in reserve, to be employed when the occasion for
their exercise may arise. In many of his speeches, not espec-
ially pervaded by passion, we perceive strength, indeed, but
strength “ half—leaning on his own right arm.” He has never
yet been placed in circumstances where the full might of his
nature, in all its depth of understanding, ﬁery vehemence of
sensibility, and adamantine strength of will, have been brought
to bear on any one object, and strained to their utmost.

' 9. We have referred to Webster’s productions as being em-
inently national. Every one familiar with them will bear out
the statement. In fact, the most hurried glance at his life
would prove, that, surrounded as he has been from his youth
by American inﬂuences, it could hardly be otherwise. His
earliest recollections must extend nearly to the feelings and in-
cidents of the Revolution. His whole life since that period
has been passed in the country of his birth, and his fame and
honors are all closely connected with American feelings and
institutions. _

10. His works all refer to -the history, the policy, the laws,
the government, the social life, and the destiny, of his own
land. They bear little resemblance, in their tone and spirit,
to productions of the same class on the other side of the At-
lantic. . They have come from the heart and understanding of
one into whose very nature the life of his country has passed.

Without taking into view the inﬂuences» to which his youth
and early manhood were subjected, so well calculated to inspire
a love for the very soil of his nativity, and to mold his mind
into accordance with what is best and noblest in the spirit of
our institutions, his position has been such as to lead him to
survey objects from an American point of view.

11. His patriotism has become part of his being. Deny
him that, and you deny the authorship of his works. It has
prompted the most majestic ﬂights of his eloquence. It has
given intensity to his purposes, and lent the richest glow to his
genius. It has made his eloquence a language of the heart,
felt and understood over every portion of the land it consecrates.
On Plymouth Rock, on Bunker’s Hill, at Mount Vernon, by
the tombs of Hamilton, and Adams, and Jefferson, and Jay, we
are reminded of Daniel Webster.

12. He has done what no national poet hasyet succeeded
in doing,—-associated his own great genius with all in our
country’s history and scenery which makes us rejoice that
we are Americans. Over all those events in our history which
are heroical, he has cast the hues of strong feeling and vivid
imagination. He can not stand on one spot of ground, hal-
lowed by liberty or religion, without being kindled by the ge-
nius of the place; he can not mention a name, consecrated by
self-devotion and patriotism, without doing it eloquent hom-’

age. Seeing clearly, and feeling deeply, he makes us see and

feel with him.

13. That scene of the landing of the Pilgrims, in which his
imagination conjures up the forms and emotions of our New
England ancestry, will ever live in the national memory. We
see, with him, the “little bark, with the interesting group on
its deck, make its slow progress to the shore.” We feel, with
him, “the cold which benumbed,” and listen, with him, “to the
winds which pierced them.” Carver, and Bradford, and "Stan-
dish, and Brewster, and Allerton, look out upon us from -the
pictured page, in all the dignity with which virtue and freedom
invest their martyrs; and We see, too, “chilled and shivering

childhood, houseless but for a mother’s arms, couchless but
for a moth 3r’s breast,” till our own blood almost freezes.

14. The readiness with which the orator compels our sym-
pathies to follow his own is again illustrated in the orations
at Bunker Hill, and in the discourse in honor of Adams and
Jeﬁerson. In reading them, we feel a new pride" in our

‘ country, and in the great men and great principles, it has

cherished. The mind feels an unwonted elevation, and the
heart is stirred with emotions of more than common depth, by
their majestyand power.

15. Some passages are so graphic and true that they seem
gifted with a voice, and to speak to us from the page they il-
lumine. The intensity of feeling with which they are pervaded
rises at times from conﬁdent hope to prophecy, and lifts the
soul as with wings. In that splendid close to a remarkable
passage in the oration on Adams and J efferson, what American
does not feel assured, with the orator, that their fame will be
immortal ? .

16. “Although no sculptured marble should rise to their
memory, nor engraved stone bear record to their deeds, yet
will their remembrance be as lasting as the land they honored.
Marble columns may, indeed, molder into dust, time may erase
all impress from the crumbling stone, but their fame remains ;
for with AMERICAN LIBERTY it rose, and with AMERICAN LIB-

ERTY ONLY can it perish. It was the last swelling peal of I

yonder choir, ‘ THEIR’ BODIES ARE BURIED IN PEACE, BUT THEIR
NAME LIVETH EVERMCRE.’ I catch the solemn song, I echo that
lofty strain of funeral triumph, ‘THEIR NAME LIVETH EVER-
MCRE.’ ” C

17. Throughout the speeches of Mr. Webster we perceive
this national spirit. He has meditatiedi so deeply on the his—
tory, the formation, and the tendencies of our institutions; he
is so well acquainted with the conduct and opinions of every
statesman who has affected the policy of the government; and
has become so thoroughly imbued with the national character,
that his sympathies naturally ﬂow in national channels, and

His motto is,——“ Our country, our whole country, and nothing

THE EARTH ADAPTED TO THE NATURE OF MAN.
OLIVER GOLDSMITH.

1. The universe may be considered as the palace in which
the Deity resides; and the earth as one of its apartments. In
this, all the meaner races of animated nature mechanically obey
him; and stand ready to execute his commands without hesi-
tation. Man alone is found refractory; he .is the only being
endued with a power of contradicting these mandates.

2. The Deity was pleased to exert superior power of creating
him a superior being; a being endued with a choice of good

and evil; and capable, in some measure, of co-operating with

his own’ intentions. Man, therefore, may be considered as a
limited creature, endued with powers imitative of those residing

in the Deity. He is thrown into a world that stands in need.

of his help; and he has been granted a power of producing har-
mony from partial confusion.

3. If,’ therefore, we consider the earth as allotted for our
habitation, we shall ﬁnd, that much has been given us to enjoy,
and much to amend ; that we have ample reasons for our grati-
tude, and many for our industry. In those great outlines of
nature, to whi_ch art can not reach, and where our greatest ef-
forts must have been ineffectual, God himself has ﬁnished
every thing with amazing grandeur and beauty.

4. Our beneﬁcent Father has considered these parts of nature

as peculiarly his own; as parts which no creature could have
skill or strength to amend; and he has, therefore, made them
incapable of alteration, or of more perfect regularity. The
heavens and the ﬁrmament show the wisdom and the glory of
the Wo1'kman. Astronomers who are best skilled in the sym-
metry of systems, can ﬁnd nothing they can alter for the better.
God made these perfect, because no _subordinate being could
correct their defects. -

5. When, therefore, we survey nature on this side, nothing
can be more splendid, more correct, or amazing. We there
behold a Deity residing in the midst of a universe, inﬁnitely ex-
tended every way, animating all, and cheering the vacuity with
his presence. We behold an immense and shapeless mass of
matter, formed into worlds by his power, and dispersed at in-
tervals, to which even the imagination -can not travel. In this
great theater of his glory, a thousand suns, like our own, ani-
mate their respective systems, appearing and vanishing at Divine
command.

6. We behold our own bright luminary, ﬁxed in the center
of its system, wheeling its planets in times proportioned to their
distances, and at once dispensing light, heat, and action. The
earth, also, is seen with its twofold motion ; producing by the
one, the change of seasons; and, by the other, the grateful
vicissitudes of day and night. With what silent magniﬁcence
is all this performed! with what seeming ease! The works of
art are exerted with interrupted force, and their noisy progress
discovers the obstructions they receive; but the earth, with a
silent, steady rotation, successively presents every part of its
bosom to the sun; at once imbibing nourishment and light
from that parent of vegetation and fertility. '

7. But not only provisions of light and heat are thus sup-
plied; the Whole surface of the earth is covered with a trans-
parent atmosphere that turns with its motion, and guards it
from external injury. The rays of the sun are thus broken into
a genial warmth; and, while the surface is assisted, a gentle
heat is prwduced in the bowels of the earth, which contributes

to cover it with verdure. VVaters, also, are supplied, in health-
ful abundance, to support life, and assist vegetation. Mountains
rise, to diversify the prospect, and give a current to the stream.
Seas extend from one continent to the other, replenished with

' animals that may be turned to human support ; and, also, serv-

ing to enrich the earth with a suﬂiciency of vapor. Breezes
ﬂy along the sprface of the ﬁelds, to promote health and vegeta-
tion. The coolness of the evening invites to rest; and the
freshness of the morning renews for labor. ’ ~

8. Such are the delights of the habitation that has been as
signed to man : without any one of these, he must have been
wretched; and none of these could his own industry have sup-
plied. But while, on the one hand, many of his wants are thus
kindly furnished, there are, on the other, numberless inconven-

iences to excite his industry. This habitation, tl:».ougl1 provided ’

with all the conveniences of air, pasturage, and water, is but a
desert place, without human cultivation. The lowest animal
finds more conveniences in the wilds of nature, than he who
boasts himself their lord.

9. The whirlwind, the inundation, and all the asperities of
the air, are peculiarly terrible to man who knows their conse-
quences, and, at a distance, dreads their approach. The earth
itself, where human art has not pervaded, puts on a frightful,
gloomy appearance. The forests are dark and tangled; the
meadows are overgrown with rank weeds; and the brooks stray
without a determined channel. Nature that has been kind to
every lower order of beings, seems to have been neglectful with
regard to him: to the savage, uncontriving man, the earth is
an abode of desolation, where his shelter is insufﬁcient, and his
food precarious. ,

10. A world thus furnished with advantages on one side, and
inconveniences on the other, is the proper abode of reason, and

. the ﬁttest to exercise the industry of a free and thinking crea-

ture. These evils which art can remedy, and prescience guard

, against, are a proper call for the exertion of his faculties; and

they tend still more to assimilate him to his Creator. God

THE MERCY OF AFFLICTION.
JOSEPH WARTON.

1. Bozaldab, Calif of Egypt, had dwelt securely for many
years in the silken pavilions of pleasure, and had every morn-
ing annointed his head with the oil of gladness, when his only
son, Aboram, for Whom he had crowded his trea.suries with
gold, extended his dominions with conquests, and secured them
with impregnable fortresses, was suddenly wounded, as he was
hunting,xvitl1 an arrow from an unknown hand, and expired
in the ﬁeld. ,

2. Bozaldab, in the distraction of grief and despair, refused to
return to his palace, and retired to the gloomiest grotto in the
neighboring mountain: he there rolled himself on the dust,
tore away the hairs of his hoary beard, and dashed the cup of
consolation that Patience offered him to the ground. He suf-
fered not his minstrels to approach his presence, but listened
to the screams of the melancholy birds of midnight, that ﬂit
through the solitary vaults and echoing chambers of the pyra-
mids. “ Can that God be benevolent,” he cried, “ who thus
iWO11I1dS the soul, as from an ambush, with unexpected sor-
rows, and crushes his creatures in a moment with irremedia-
ble calamity? Ye lying Imans, prate to us no mcre of the
justice and the kindness of an all-directing and all-loving
Providence! He whom ye pretendlreigns in ‘ Heaven, is so
far from protecting the miserable sons of men, that he perpet-

Hope ;, and, like a malignant giant, to beat down the strongest
towers of Happiness with the iron mace of his anger. If this
Being possessed the goodness and the power with which ﬂat-
tering priests have invested‘ him, he would doubtless be in-
clined, and enabled to banish those evils which render the
world a dungeon of distress, a vale of vanity and woe. I will
continue in‘ it no longer I”

3. At that momenthe furiously raised his hand which Despair
had armed with a dagger, to strike deep into his bosom ; when
suddenly thick ﬂashes of lightning shot through the cavern,
and a being of more than human beauty and magnitude, ar-
rayed in azure robes, crowned with amaranth, and waving a
branch’ of palm in his right hand, arrested the arm of the
trembling and astonished Calif, and said with a majestic
smile,—-“ Follow me to the top of this mountain.” A

“Look from hence,” said the awful conductor ; “ lam Caloc,
the angel of Peace ; look from hence intothe valley.”

4. Bozaldab opened his eyes and beheld a barren, sultry, and
solitary island, in the midst of which sat a pale, meager and
ghastly ﬁgure: it was a merchant just perishing with famine,
and lamenting that he could ﬁnd neither wild berries nor a
single spring in this forlorn, uninhabited desert; and begging

the protection of Heaven against the tigers that would now

A certainly destroy him, since he had consumed the last fuel he

had collected to make nightly ﬁres to affright them. He then
cast a casket of jewels on the sand, as jzriﬂes of no use; and
crept, feeble and trembling, to an eminence, where he was ac-
customed to sit every evening to watch the setting sun, and to
give a signal to any ship that might haply approach the
island. ’ ' A

5. “Inhabitant of Heaven,” cried Bozaldab, “ suffer not this
wretch to perish by the fury of wild beasts.” “Peace,” said
the angel, “and observe.”
i He looked again, and behold a vessel arrived at the desolate
isle. Whatlwords can paint the rapture of the starving mer-
chant, when the captain offered to transport him to his native

country, if he would reward him with half the jewels of his
casket. No sooner had this pitiless commander received the
stipulated sum, than he held a consultation with his crew, and
they agreed to seize the remaining jewels, and leave the un-
happy exile in the same helpless and lamentable condition in
whichithey discovered him. He wept and trembled, intreated
and implored in -vain. ’

6. “Will Heaven permit such injustice to be practiced?” ex-
claimed Bozaldab. “Look again,” said the angel, “and be-
hold the very ship in which, short-sighted as thou art, thou
wishedst the merchant might embark, dashed in pieces on a
rock: dost thou not hear the cries of the sinking sailors?
Presume not to direct the Governor of the universe in his dis-
posal of events. The man whom thou hast pitied shall be ta-
ken from this dreary solitude, but not by the method thou
wouldst prescribe. His vice was avarice, by which he became
not only abominable, but wretched; he fancied some mighty
charm in wealth, which, like the wandiof Abdiel, would grat-
ify every wish and obviate every fear. This Wealth he has now
been taught notonly to despise, but abhor; he cast his jewels
upon the sand, and confessed them to be useless; he offered
part of them to the mariners, and perceived them to be per-
nicious; he has now learned that they are rendered useful or
vain, good or evil, only by the situation and temper of the pos-

sessor. Happy is he whom distress has taught wisdom I But

turn thine eyes to another and more interesting scene.”

7. The Calif instantly beheld a magniﬁcent palace, adorned
with the statues of his ancestors wrought in jasper; the ivory
doors of which, turning on hinges of the gold of Golconda,
discovered a throne of diamonds, surrounded, with the Rajchs
of fifty nations, and with embassadors in various habits, and of
different complexions; on which sat Aboram, the‘ much la-
mented son of Bozaldab, and by his side a princess fairer than
an Houri.

me hold him to my heart 1” “Thou canst not grasp an unsub-

stantial vision,” replied the angel: “I am now showing tl.ee'

what would have been the destiny of thy son, had he continued

‘longer on the earth.” -“ And why,” returned Bozaldab, “ was

he not permitted to continue ? Why was I not sulfered to be
a witness of so much felicity and power ?” “ Consider the
sequel,” replied he that dwells in the ﬁfth heaven. Bozaldab
looked earnestly, and saw the countenance of his son, on which
he had been used to behold the ‘placid smile of simplicity, and
the vivid blushes of health, notvdistorted with rage, and now
ﬁxed in the insensibility of drunkenness. It was again ani-
mated with disdain, it became pale with apprehension, and ap-
peared to be withered by intemperance ; his hands were stained
with blood, and he trembled by turns with fury and terror: the
palace so lately shining with oriental pomp, changed suddenly
into the cell of a dungeon, where his son lay stretched out on
the cold pavement, gagged and bound, with his eyes put out.
Soon after he perceived the favorite Sultana who before was
seated by his side, enter with a bowl of poison which she com-
pelled Aboram to drink, and afterward -married the successor
to his throne. _ V

6. I can not believe thatany man who deserved fame, ever
labored for it; that is, directly. For, as fame is but the con-
tingent of excellence, it would be like an attempt to project a
shadow before its substance was obtained. Many, however,
have so fancied: “I write and paint for fame,” has often been
repeated :  should have been, “I write, I paint for reputation.”
All anxiety, therefore, about fame, should be placed to the ac-
count of reputation. A.man may be pretty sure that he has
not attained excellence, when it is not all in all to him. Nay, I
may add, that if he looks beyond it, he has not reached it.

7. An original mind is rarely understood until it has been
reflected from some half-dozen congenial with it : so averse are
men to admitting the true in an unusual form ; while any nov-
elty, however fantastic, however false, is greedily swallowed.
Nor is this to be wondered at; for all truth demands a response,
and few people care to think, yet they must have something to
supply the place of thought. Every mind would appear orig-
inal, if every man had the power of projecting his own into the
mind of others.

8. All effort at originality must end either in the quaint or
the monstrous. F or no man knows himself as an original: he
can only believe it on the report of others to whom he is made
known as he is by the projecting power before spoken of. "There
is an essential meanness in the wish to get the better of any one.
The only competition worthy of a wise man, is with himself.
Reverence is an ennobling sentiment: it is felt to be degrading
only by the vulgar mind, which would ‘escape the sense of its
own littleness, by elevating itself into the antagonist to what is
above it.

9. He that has no pleasure in looking up, is not ﬁt to look
down :of such”minds are the mannerists in art; and, in the
worli, the tyrants of all sorts. The phrenologists are right
in putting the organ of self—_love in the back part of the head.

quence is that every object he approaches becomes obscure by
hisown shadow. A witch’s skiff can not more easily sail in

thou commandest tobe cut’ to receive the annual fnundations
of the Nile, contain the waters of the ocean? Remember that

perfect happiness can not be conferred on a creature, for perfect

happiness is an attribute as incommunicable as perfect power
and eternity.” V

The Angel, while he Was speaking thus, stretched out his
pinions to fly back to the Empyreum; and the ﬂutter of his
wings was like the rushing of a cataract.

EVIDENCE OF DESIGN IN THE CREATION.
TILLOTSON.

How often might a man, after he had jumbled a set of letters
in a bag, ﬂing them out upon the ground, before they would fall
into an exact poem, yea, or so much as make a good discourse in
prose ? And may not a little book be as easily made by chance,
as this great volume of the World? How long might a man be
in sprinklingcolors upon a canvas with a careless hand, before
they would happen to make the exact picture of a man 3 And
is a man easier made by chance than his picture? How {brig
might twenty thousand blind men, which should be sent out
from the several remote parts of England, Wander up and down
before they Would allameet upon Salisbury Plains, and fall into
rank andﬁle in the exact order of an army? And yet this is
much more easy to be imagined, than how the innumerable
blind parts of matter should rendezvous themselves into a

CONCORD AND DISCORD.
I ISAAC BARROW.

1. How good and pleasant a thing it is, as David saith, for
brethren,»-and so we are all, at least by nature,—+to live. to-
gether in unity! How delicious that conversation is which is
accompanied with mutual conﬁdence, freedom, courtesy, and
complaisance; how calm the mind, how composed the affections,
how serene the countenance, how melodious the voice, how
sweet the sleep, how contentful the whole life is, of him that
neither deviseth mischief against others, nor suspects any to be
contrived against himself I And, contrariwise, how ungrateful
and loathsome a thing it is, to abide in a state _of enmity,
wrath, dissension : having the thoughts distracted with solicit-
ous care, anxious suspicion, envious regret,-—the heart boiling
with choler, the face ever clouded with discontent, the tongue
jarring and out of tune, the ears ﬁlled with discordant noises

.of contradiction, clamor and reproach,——the whole frame of

body and soul distempered and disturbed with the worst of
passions ! ' '

2. How much more comfortable it is to walk in smooth and
even paths, than to wander in rugged ways, overgrown with
briers, obstructed with rubs, and beset with snares; to sail
steadily, in a quiet, than to be tossed on a tempestuous sea; to
behold the lovely face of heaven, smiling with a cheerful serenity,
than see it frowning with clouds or raging with storms I ‘How
much a peaceful state resembles heaven, into which neither
complaint, pain nor clamor, do ever enter, but blessed souls
converse together in perfect love, and in perpetual concord
How like a paradise the world would be, ﬂourishing in joy and
rest, if meniwould cheerfully conspire in afliection, and helpfully
contribute to each other’s content; and how like a savage wil-

derness now it is, when, like wild beasts, they vex and « persev

cute, worry and devour each other.’

The goal achieved ; the warrior, when his sword
Flashes red triumph in the noon-day sun; 4
The poet, when his lyre hangs on the palm ;
The statesman, when the crowd proclaim his voice, ,_

They count not life ’s first steps, and never think
Upon the many miserable hours,

When hope deferred was sickness to the heart.
They reckon not the battle and the march,

The long privations of a Wasted youth ;

They never see the banner till unfurled.

Wliat are to them the solitary nights

Passed, pale and anxious, by the sickly lamp,
Till the young poet wins the world at last

To listen to the music long his own?

The crowd attend the sta.tesman’s ﬁery mind

Its struggle, or its long expectancy.

THE GENTLEMAN.
GEORGE W DOANE.

1. When you havefound a man, you have not far to go to
ﬁnd a gentleman. You can not make a gold ring out of brass.
You can not change a Cape May crystal to a diamond. You
can not make a gentleman till you have ﬁrst a man. To be a.
gentleman, it will not be sufficient to have had a grandfather.
To beia gentleman, does not depend upon the tailor, or the
toilet. Blood will degenerate. Good‘ clothes are not good
habits.

2. A gentleman is just a gentle-man; no more, no less; a
diamond polished, that Was ﬁrst a diamond in the rough. A
gentleman is gentle. A gentleman is modest. A gentleman is
courteous. A gentleman is generous. A gentleman is slow to
take offense, as being one that never gives it. A gentleman is
slow to surmise evil, as being one that never thinks it. A gen-
tleman goes armed only in consciousness of right. A gentle-
man subjects his appetites. A gentleman reﬁnes his taste. A
gentleman subdues his feelings. A gentleman deems every
other betterthan himself. '

THE CHANGE.
L.E.'LANDON.

1. And this is what is left of youth ! ' .
There were two boys who were bred up together, .
Shared the same bed, and fed at the same board;
Each tried the other’s sports, from their ﬁrst chase,

‘ Young hunters of the butterﬂy, and bee,

To when they followed the ﬂeet hare, and tried

The swiftness of the bird. They lay beside

The silver trout-stream, watching as the sun

Played on the bubbles; shared eachin the store

Of either’s garden ; and together read

Of him the master of the desert isle,

V Till a low hut, a gun, and a canoe,

Bounded their wishes. Or, if ever came

A thought of future days, ’t was but to say

That they would share each other’s lot, and do
‘Wonders, no doubt. But this was vain : they parted
VVith promise of long remembrance, Words

Whose kindness was the heart’s, and those warm tears,
Hidden like shame by the young eyes which shed them,
But which are thought upon, in after years,

As what we would give worlds to shed once more,

At least, what each remembered of themselves: I

the teeth of the wind, than the human eye can lie against -fact °
but the truth will often quiver through lips with a lie upon
them.

10. It is a. hard matter for a man to lie all over, Nature hav«
ing _provided king’s evidence in almost every member. The
hand will sometimes act as a Vane, to show which Way the Wind
blows, when every feature is set the other way: the knees
smite together, and sound the alarm of fear under a ﬁerce
countenance : the legs shake with anger, when all above is
calm. Make no man your idol ! For the best man must have
faults, and his faults will usually become yours, in addition to
your own. This is as true in art, as in morals.

11. There is one thing which no man, however generously
iisposed, can give, but which every one, however poor, is bound
to pay. This is Praise. He can not give it, because it is not
his own; since what is dependent for its very existence on
something in another, can never become to him a possession ;
nor can he justly withhold it, when the presence of merit
claims it as a consequence. As praise, then, can not be made a
gift, so, neither, when not his due, can any man receive it; he
may tlzinlc he does, but he receives only words ; for desert
being the essential condition of praise, there can be no realitv
in the one without the other.

THE IMMORTALITYOF LITERARY FAME.

1. Let‘ us conclude with the dignity and excellency of know}: .

edge and learning in that whereunto ,man’s nature’do,th most as-
pire, which is immortality or continuance; forte‘ this tendeth
generation, and raising of houses and families ; to this tendeth
buildings, foundations, and monuments; to this tendeth the de-

sire of memory, fame and celebration, and, in effect, the strength

of all other humane desires: we see then how far the menu-
ments of wit and learning are more durable than the monuments
of power or of the hands. For, have not the verses of Homer
continued twenty-ﬁve hundred years and more, without the ‘loss
of a syllable or letter, during which time i_nﬁnite_palac_es, tem

EXERCISE CLXI.

THE BEAUTIFUL AND THE USEFUL.
WIELAND.

1. Socrates exhorts the painter and the sculptor to unite the
beautiful and the agreeable with the useful; as he encourages
the pantomimic dancer to ennoble the pleasure that his art may
be capable of giving, and to delight the heart at the same time
with the senses. According to the same principle, he must
desire every laborer who occupies himself about something
necessary, to unite the useful, as much as possible, with the
beautiful. But to allow no value for beauty, except Where it is
useful, is a confusion of ideas. _

2. Beauty and grace are undoubtedly united by nature it-
self with the useful ;~ but they are not, therefore, desirable, be-
cause they are useful ; but because, from the nature of man, he
enjoys a pure pleasure in their contemplation,———a pleasure pre-
cisely similar to that which the contemplation of virtue gives ;
a necessity as imperative for man-,as a reasonable being, as
food, clothing, and a habitationare for him, as an animal.

3. I say for him, as an animal, ‘because he has much in
common with all - or most other animals. But neither these
animal wants, nor the capability and desire to satisfy. them,
make him a man. While he procures his food, builds him-

self a nest, takes to himself a mate, leads his young, ﬁghts’

with any other who would deprive ‘ him of his food or take
possession of his nest; in all this he acts, so far as it is merely
corporal, as an animal.

4. Merely through the skill and manner in which, asa man,
he performs all these animal-like acts, does he distinguish and
elevate himself above all other animals, and evince his human
nature. For this animal that calls itself man, and this only,
has an inborn feeling for beauty and order, has aheart dis-
posed to social communication, to compassion and sympathy,

and to an inﬁnite variety of pleasing and beautiful feelings;

has a strong tendency to imitate and create, _and labors inces-
santly to improve whatever it has invented or formed.

5. All these peculiarities together separate him essentially
from the other animals, render him their lord and master, place
earth and‘ocean in his power, and lead him step by step so
high through the nearly illimitable elevation of his capacity
for art, that he is, at length, in a condition to remodel nature
itself, a.nd, from the materials it affords him, to create a new,
and, for his "peculiar purpose, a more perfectly adjusted world.

6. The first thing in which man displays this superiority, is
in the reﬁning and elevating all the wants, instincts, and func-
tionslwhich he has in common with the animal. The time
which-this may require does not signify. It is suflicient that
he, at length, succeeds; that he no longer depends on mere
chance for his maintenance; and the increased security of
more abundant and better food leaves him leisure to think of
improving the remaining requirements of his life. He invents
one art after another; each one increases the security or the
pleasure of his existence; and he thus ascends unceasingly
from the absolutely necessary to the convenient, from the con-
venient to the beautiful.

7. The natural society in which he is born, united to the ne-
cessity of guarding against the ill consequences of a wide dis-
persion of the human race,-produces, at length, civil establish-
ments and social modes of life. But even then, he has scarcely
provided for what is absolutely necessary for the means of in-
ward and outward security, than we see him occupied in a
thousand ways in adorning his new condition. Little villages
are imperceptibly transformed into great cities, the abodes of

the arts and.of commerce, and the points of union between the
various nations of the earth.

8. Man extends himself on all sides, and, in every sense,
navigation and trade increase his ‘social relations and occupa--
tions,'and they multiply the wants and goods of life. Riches
and pleasure reﬁne every art of which necessity and want were
the parents. Leisure, love of fame, and public encouragement,
promote the growth of the sciences; which, by the light they
shed upon every object of human life, become again rich
sources of new advantages’ and enjoyments.

9. But in the same degree that man adorns and improves
his external condition, are his‘ perceptions developed, also, for
moral beauty. He renounces the rough and inhuman customs
of the savage, learns to abhor all Violent conduct toward his
fellows, and accustoms himself to the rules of justice and
equity. The various relations of the social state form and ﬁx
the notions of respectability and civility; and the desire of
making himself agreeable to others, of obtaining their esteem,
teaches him to suppress his passions, to conceal his faults, to
assume his best appearance, and always to act in the most
becoming manner. In aiword, his manner improves with his
condition.

.10. Through all these steps he elevates himself, at length, to
the highest degree of perfection of which the mind is capable
in the present life, to an enlarged idea of thewhole of which
he is a part, to the ideal of the beautiful and the good, to
wisdom and virtue, and to the adoration of the inscrutable
First Cause, the universal Father of all, to recognize and per-
form whose laws is, at the same time, his greatest privilege,
his ﬁrst duty, and his purest pleasure.

11. All this we may at once call the advancement of human

. nature. And now may every one answer for himself the ques-

tion,—Would man have made that advance, if the inborn feeling
for the beautiful and the becoming had remained in him in-
active? Take it away, and all the effects of his formative
power,‘all the memorials of his greatness, all the riches of nav

ture and art, in the possession of which he has placed himself,
vanish ; he sinks back into the merely animal ran]; of the stu-

pid and insensible natives of Australia, and with him nature, -

also, sinks into barbarism and chaotic deformity.
12. VVhat are all the steps by which man advances himself
by degrees toward perfection but reﬁnements ?——reﬁnements in

_ his wants, modes of living, his clothing, dwelling, furniture ?——--

reﬁnements of his mind and his heart, of his sentiments and

~ his passions, of hislanguage, morals, customs, and pleasures?

What an advance from _the ﬁrst but to a palace of Palladio I*—-—
from the canoe of a Caribbean to a ship of the line I——from the
three rude idols, as the Boeotians, in the olden time, represented
their protecting goddesses, to the Graces of Praxiteles !‘[——from
a village of the Hottentots or wild Indians to a city like Lon-
don l—from the ornaments of a female of New Zealand to a
splendid dress of a Sultana !—'——from the language of a . native
of Tahiti to that of a Homer, a Virgil,and pa Milton 1 ‘

13. Through what innume:rabl.e degrees of reﬁnement must
man and his works have proceeded, before they had placed this
almost immeasurable distance behind them I The love of em-
bellishment and reﬁnement, and the dissatisfaction with a‘ lower
degree as soon as a higher has been recognized, are_ the only
true and most simple motives by which man has advanced to
what we see him. Every people who have become civilized
are a proof of this-principle ; and, if any such are to be found,
who, without peculiar physical or moral hindrances, continue
in the same state of unimprovability, or betray a complete want
of impulse to improvement, we must needs consider them rather

as a sort of human animals than as actually men of our race

and species.

  EXEEc1sE CLXII.

THE WORTH or LIBERTY.
HENRY GILES.
1. What is liberty worth ? Liberty is worth whatever the

‘best civilization is worth. The best civilization, even if iwe

conﬁne our idea of it to physical advantages, is not that in
which these advantages are greatest in speciﬁc accumulations,
but that in which they are greatest in general distribution;
not that in which they are monopolized by the few, but that in
which they are shared by the many; not that in which zone
man has luxuries and ninety-nine men are wretched, but that
'n which the hundred have adequate support, that in which, if
some have more than moderation, few have less.

2. But how is such adistribution-to be secured? Not by
formal methods. The end will be most surely obtained by in-
terfering as little as can be with the laws of nature; giving
the individual conﬁdence that he shall have what he can pro-
duce, thus inspiring him, at the same time, with a feeling of
self-interest, as well as self-restraint; giving him the experience
that the community returns to him good immeasurably beyond
the value of any thing which it takes from him; thus asso-
ciating, in his conviction, the identity of personal security with
social order. . V - 

3. But it is not physical advantages, merely, that liberty,
wide, generous liberty, most creates, and most distributes ; but
whatever belongs to the higher nature’ of man, and the truest
greatness of a state; whatever gives dignity to the one, what-
ever is fairest and noblest, whatever is most vital and most ex-
alting in the other. I

4. That is not the best civilization, therefore, which regains
men as masses, but that which regards them as individuals.
It is not that which can use them in multitudes to accomplish
huge works, at which futurity may wonder, but in which these
multitudes have no interest themselves; it is not that which

522 sannnnsinnw snnrns.

A
V

can use them as armies, without personal choice or civic need,
to be sacriﬁced by thousands in gigantic and grim. idolatry to
the bloody vanity of empire and of conquest.

5. This is all consistent enough with despotism; it is not
at all consistent with freedom. There is nothing which is of

imposing magnitude, nothing of mere physical aggrandize~
.ment, which despotism may not achieve, nay, most rapidly

achieve. But this is not a genuine civilization. Despotism
may build up. mighty cities, but it does not build up a noble
people ; despotism may erect lofty pillars and pyramids, but it
does not erect a lofty manhood; it may cut roads across
moiintains, and carry water over valleys, but it does not make
highways upon which knowledge may run to and fro, nor send
streams of comfort and virtue to men’s hearts and homes.

6. Liberty, especially liberty with the Gospel, does the latter
first; and, in good time, itidoes the former also. I repeat it,
the best civilization is that which respects the individual ; that
which shelters his home; that which gives him asphere for
his industry, and secures to him the fruits of it; that which
protects him from bodily want and mental degradation; that

which provides for him the means of intellectual and spiritual

improvement, of intellectual and spiritual enjoyment.

7. For what does it beneﬁt me, that wealth and splendor
are around me while my days succeed each other in toil with-
out reward, and in wretchedness without hope ? What is the
beneﬁt to me, that men breathe the same air as I do, whose
names are emblazoned by renown, while I am denied even a
chance of the most ordinary human privileges?

8. VVhat is the beneﬁt to me, that the nation in which I
have little but existence, is stupendous in its power, terrible in
its grandeur, august in the midst of the world, glorious in the
triumphs of arms, enriched by the spoils of empires, proud in

the lore of ages, in the discoveries of science, in the a/lorn-_

ments of art,———if I am lost in the blaze of this light, if I am
crushed under the weight of this glory, if I am reduced merely
to a thing of muscle and appetite, if, from the gross and dreary

blackness of poverty and ignorance I never can e1iie1'gr3, to
know the dignity of thought, to feel the joy of beauty ?

9. Nor are the ﬁnest meanings in the life of man only thus
hidden from me, but the ﬁnest meanings, likewise, in the works
of God. For me the ﬂower springs in vain ; in va.in the streams
sing along in music ; in vain the garden of the forest blooms ;
to me the mountain is merely a heap of earth, the cloud
senseless vapor, the torrent an empty noise, the ocean a bound
less obstruction, the heavens a collection of glimmering sparks;
blind in my intellect, vacant in my imagination, insensate in
my feelings, my eyes have no true sight, my ears have no true
hearing, my heart has no inspired emotions, the vastness or the
fairness of the universe is not mine ; and, in the midst of it all,
I crawl imprisoned in slime and_ gloom.

10. Ask for the achievements of liberty,——some will lead you
to legislatures, and point you to its assembled representatives.
Some will take you to its battle-grounds, tell you the story of
its struggles, and show you with pride the sublimity of its
monuments. Some will go with you to the arsenal and the
fortress, direct your attention to the ship of war, silent in the
harbor, but in which thunder sleeps, which a touch can awake
at the stealthiest approach of danger. l

11. Some, not thus warlike, will rather refer you to the dark
forests of merchant vessels that lie before you, which are
winged messengers for the exchange of riches with every cli-
mate of earth. Some, actuated by vanity, will conduct you
through the finer parts of cities, where you are lost in the maj-
esty of private palaces, or dazzled amid the splendor of fashion-
able stores. Some, devoted to money, will explain to you the
beauty of the new Exchange; enlarge on the architecture of
the leading banks; from solidity of structure pass on to solid»-
ity of capital ; become eloquent on the price of stocks, and
warm to rapture in the ecstasy of cent. per cent.

12. Not, however, to the turmoil of cities, but to the quiet
of the country will I take my way to seek for the noblest
doings of liberty. From an elevated spot I will gaze around

524 SANDERS’ ‘NEW snnrns;
on the serene landscape, watch the cattle that cover the hills,
follow the husbandman a.s he guides the plow, and turns up the
soil he owns. I will descend into the mechanic’s shop, and
converse with the occupant, intelligent, industrious, and inde-
pendent. I will go“ here and there, into cleanly dwellings, each
giving signs of peace and comfort, none of squalor or starva

.tion. ' ' I
_13. I will linger through the village; I will stop on the‘ plot
before the common school, and refresh the spirit of fatigued
maturity by watching for awhile the gambols of rosy ancl
, laughing childhood; I will venture, as I pass, to enter the
academy, andthere survey the studious diligence of brave boys
and blushing girls. If there be a town meeting, I will pause
for a time, and listen to homely, but unshackled legislation,
which provides support for the poor, instruction for the young,
and supply for such other matters as concern the general. wel-

fare of the community. . ‘ 3

14. The church, new or old, as I go by it, carries me back to
other days; it transports me, also, to the future and the skies ; I
feel the presence of God in its silence, and around it an atmos~
phere of holiness and of the Sabbath. In the greenwood shade
beyond, I ﬁnd the colleges of an enlightened university, where
youth that thirst for knowledge may have it abundantly and
generously. Yes, industry, plenty, education, learning, religion,—-

these are to me the holiest triumphs of liberty; and for these -

I most hail it, and most for these I love it.

15. Civilization such as this is the civilization of peace. It
is sown in peace, it grows in peace, and in peace alone it can
fully ripen. War in its best, in its most defensible existence,
interrupts such civilization, and obstructs it; war, in its noblest
form, is not in the region of the higher sentiments, or of true
reason, but simply in the region. of the instinct". The bravest
warriors will admit this ; they know that, if men were guided
"by pure sentiment and true reason,'the occupation of the war-
rior would be gone ; and the most experienced of soldiers will
be readiest to make the confession.

HIGH SCHOOL READER. , 525

16. Yet, until men advance so far as to feel pure sentiment
and true reason as motives, and to subject and subordinate in-
stinct to their supremacy, we must still be just to the noblel‘
instincts in man, even thoughthey be but instincts. A despot
may use the instinct of ﬁght, which man has in common with
all other animals, for his tyrannic will. His instinct may act
in obedience to the most servile cowardice, to the most brutal-

ized habit. Ignorance, poverty, despair, are the best of recruit-'

ing sergeants. .

17. But, then, there are cases, when this instinct, of itself,
bounds to the battle, and when it is not only free, but joyous
in a generous ﬁght. Like the eagle sleeping with its young,
it slumbers in a deep repose; but, when the robbing hand
comes near, it awakes in its ﬁercest strength. The hen is val-
iant for her brood, and for hers, too, the dove is warlike. The
patriotic instinct thus repels the invader, and battles for its
homes; an.d, until the Gospel raises us into its own purity of
sentiment and truthof reason, I see not how we can be void of
this instinct or be false to it, without being ignoble. '

And ‘I saw him take his ﬂight,
Other regions to delight.

I began to moralize——

In fancy, thus the bird I trace,

An emblem of the rhyming race;
Ere With heaVen’s'immortal ﬁre

Ere in high, majestic song, ‘
Thundering roars the verse along;

Soft they tune each varied string;

Then the kindling spark is blown.

And sparkle in its brightness. Earth is vailed,

Of the wide ocean resting after storms;

Or tones that wind around the vaulted roof,
And pointed arches, and retiring aisles

Of some old, lonely minster,‘ where the hand‘,
Skillful, and moved with passionate love of ‘art,
Plays o’er the higher keys, and bears aloft

The peal of bursting thunder, and then calls,
By mellow touches, from the softer tubes,
Voices of melting tenderness, that blend

With pure and gentle musings, till the soul,
Commingling with the melody, is borne,

Rapt, and dissolved in ecstasy,’ to heaven.

of human life, and are destined to produce impurtant effects
both upon. our happiness and character. They are, in the first
place, in the language of the Psalmist, “the wells of the desert ;”
the kind resting-places in which toil may relax, in which the
Weary spirit may recover its tone, and where the desponding
mind may resume its strength and its hopes.

2. It is not, therefore, the use of the innocent amusements of
life, which is dangerous, but the abuse of them; it is not wlier;
they are occasionally, but when they are constantly pursued:
when the love of amusement degenerates "into a passion, and

when, from being an occasional indulgence, it becomes an ha-=

bitual desire. Vlfhat the consequences of this inordinate love
of amusement are, I shall now endeavor very brieﬂy to show

3. It tends to degrade all" the powers of the understanding.
It is the eternal law of nature, that truth and wisdom are the
offspring of labor, of vigor, and perseverance in every worthy
object of pursuit. The eminent stations of fame, accordingly,
and the distinguished honors of knowledge, have, in every age,
been the reward only of such early attainments, of that che1'-
ished-elevation of mind, which pursues only magniﬁcent ends,
and of that heroic fortitude Which, whether in action or in
speculation, pursues them by the means of undeviating exertion.

4. For the production of such a character, no discipline can
be so unﬁt as that of the “habitual love of amusement. It kin-
dles not the eye of ambition, it bids the heart‘ beat with no
throb of generous admiration, it lets the soul be calm, While all
the rest of our fellows are passing usin the road of virtue or of
science. Satisﬁed with humble and momentary enjoyment, it
aspires to no honor, no praise, no pre—eminence, and, contented
with the idle gratiﬁcation of the present hour, forgets alike
What man has done, and what man was born to do.

.5. If such be the character of the youthful mind, if it be with

such aims and such ambition that its natural elevatit n can be

satisﬁed, am I to ask you what must be the appearances of

the understanding of manhood? Alas? a‘ greater instructor,
the mighty instructor, Experience, may show you in every rank
of life what these "effects are. It will show you men born with
every‘ capacity, and whose first years glowed with every honor-
able ambition, whom no vice even now degrades, and to Whom
no actual guilt is affixed, who yet live, in the eye of the world,
only as the objects of pity or of scorn—who, in the idle career
of habitual amusement, have dissipated all their powers, and
lost all their ambition——-and who exist now for no purpose but
to be the sad memorials of ignoble taste and degraded under-
standing. r

6. The inordinate love of pleasure is, in the ‘second place,
equally hostile to the moral character. If the feeble and pass-
ive disposition of mind, which it produces, be unfavorable to the
exertions of the understanding, it is, in the same measure, as un-
favorable to the best employments of the heart. The great
duties of life, the duties for which every man and woman is born,
demand, in all situations, the mind of labor and perseverance.
From the first hour of existence to the last-—fre-m the cradle of
the infant, beside which the mother watches with unslumbering
eye, to the grave of the aged, where the son pours his last tears

upon the bier of his fathcr——in‘ all that intermediate time, every

day calls for exertion and activity, and ‘the moral. honors of
our being can only be won by the gteadfast magnanimity of
pious duty. - i

'7. Alas! experience has here also decided; it tells you that
the mind which exists only for pleasure can not exist for duty;
it tells you that the feeble and selﬁsh spirit of amusement grad-
ually corrodes all the benevolent emotions of the heart, and

Withers the most sacred ties of domestic affection; and it points '

its awful ﬁnger to the examples of ‘those, alas! of both sexes,
whom the unrestrained love of idle pleasure first led to error and
folly, and Whom, with sure, but fatal progress, it has since’con-
ducted to be the objects of secret shame and public infamy.

8. In the last place, this unmanly disposition is equally fatal.

who use the pleasures of life only as a temporary relaxation, as
a resting-place to animate them on the great journey on which
hey are traveling, the hours of amusement bring real pleasure;
to them the well of joy is ever full, while to those who linger
by its side, its Waters are soon dried and exhausted.

9. I speak not now of those bitter Waters which must mingle
themselves with the well of unhallowed pleasure, of the secret
rsproaches of accusing conscience, of the sad sense of shame
and dishonor, and of that degraded spirit which must bend it-
self beneath the scorn of the World; I speak only of the simple
and natural effect of unwise indulgence, that it renders the
mind callous to enjoyment, a.nd that, even though the “ fount-
ain Were full of water,” the feverish lip is inca.pable of satiating
its thirst. Alas! here, too, We may see the examples of human
folly. ‘We may see around us everywhere the fatal effects of
unrestrained pleasure ;' the young sickening in the midst of
every pure and genuine enjoyment; the mature hastening, with
hopeless step, to ﬁll up the hours of a vitiated being; and, what
is still more wretched, the hoary head Wandering in the Way of
folly, and, with an unhallowed dotage, returning again to the
triﬂes and the amusements of childhood.

10. Such, then, my young friends, are the natural and ex
perienced consequences of the inordinate love even of iI1IlOC6Il‘b
amusement, and such the intellectual and moral degradation to
which the paths of pleasure conduct. Let me entreat you to
pause ereyou beginyour course, ere those habits are acquired
which may never again be subdued, and ere ye permit the
charms of pleasure to wind around your soul their fascinating
powers.

11. Think, With the elevation and generosity of your age,
whether this is‘ the course that leads to honor or to fame;
whether it was in this discipline that they were exercised, Who,
in every age, have blessed or have enlightened the World, whose
shades are present to your midnight thoughts, and whose names
you can not pronounce without the tear of gratitude or adm‘’‘‘
txon.

LABOR AND GENIUS.
_ REV. SYDNEY SMITH.

1. The prevailing idea with young people has been, the in-
compatibility of labor and genius; and, therefore, from the
fear of being thought dull, they have thought it necessary to
remain ignorant. I have seen, at school and at college, a great
many young-men completely destroyed by having been so un-
fortunate as to produce an excellent copy of verses. Their
genius being now established, all that remained for them to do,
was to act up to the dignity of the character; and as this dig-
nity consisted in reading nothing new, in forgetting what they
had already read, and in pretending to be acquainted with all
subjects by a sort of oﬁ"-hand exertion of talents, they soon col-
lapsed into the most frivolous and insigniﬁcant of men.

2. It would be an extremely profitable thing to draw up a
Short and well—authenticated account of the habits of study of
the most celebrated writers with whose style of literary industry
we happen to be most acquainted. It would go very far to de-
stroy the. absurd and pernicious association of genius and idle-
ness, by showing that the greatest poets, orators, statesmen, and
historians——men of the most brilliant and imposing talents--
have actually labored as hard as the makers of dictionaries and
the arrangers of indexes; and that the most obvious reason
why they have been superior to other men, is, that they have
taken more pains than other men.

3. Gibbon was in his Study every morning, winter and sum-
mer, at six o’clock; Mr. Burke was the most laborious and in-

defatigable of human beings; Leibnitz was never out of his

library; Pascal killed himself by study; Cicero narrowly
escaped death by the same cause; Milton was at his books

i with as much regularity as a merchant or an attorney ; he had

mastered all the knowledge of his time; so had Homer.
Raphael lived but thirty-seven years; and in that short space

carried the art so far beyond what it h.ad . before reached. that
he appears to stand alone as a model to his successors.

4. There are instances to’ the contrary; but, generally speak-
ing, the life of all truly great men has been a life of intense and
incessant laber. They have commonly passed the ﬁrst half of
life in the gross darkness of indigent humility ———overlooked,
mistaken, contemned, by weaker men——-thinking while others
slept, reading while others rioted, feeling something within
them, that told them they should not always be kept down
among the dregs of the world. And then, when their time was
come, and some little accident has given them their ﬁrst occa-
sion, they have burst out into the light and glory of public, life,

rich with the spoils of time, and mighty in all the labors and ~

struggles of the mind.

5. Then do the multitude cry out “ a miracle of genius I”
Yes, he is a miracle of genius, becausemhe is a miracle of labor;
because, instead of trusting to the resources of his own single
mind, he has ransacked a thousand minds; because he makes
use of the accumulated wisdom of ages, and ‘takes, as his point
of departure, the very last line and boundary to which science
has advanced; because it has ever been the object of his life
to assist every intellectual gift of nature, however muniﬁcent,
and however splendid, with every resource that art could sug-
gest, and every attention diligence could bestow. T

6. But, while I am descanting upon the conduct of the under-
standing, and the best modes of acquiring knowledge, some

, men may be disposed to ask: “Wl1y conduct my understanding

with such endless care; and what is the use of so much knowl-
edge ?” What is the use of so much knowledge? Wliat is
the use of so much life? What are We to do with the seventy
years of existence allotted to us? and how are we to live them
out to the last? I solemnly declare that, but for the love of
knowledge, I should consider the life of the meanest hedger

T and ditcher as preferable to that of the greatest and richest man

in existence ; for the ﬁre of our minds is like the ﬁrewhieh the
Persians burn on the mountains; it ﬂames night‘ and day, and

is immortal, and not to be quenched I Upon some-thing it
must act and feed——upon the pure spirit of‘ knowledge, or upon
the foul dregs of polluting passions. i

7. Therefore, when I say, in conducting your understanding,
love knowledge with a great love, with a vehement love, with a
love coéval with life, what do I say but love innocence; love
virtue; love purity of conduct; love that which, if you are
rich and great, will sanctify the blind fortune which has made
you so, and make men call it justice; love that wh~ich,_,if you
are poor, will render your poverty respectable, and make the

proudest feel it unjust to langh at the meanness of your for- .

tunes; love that which will comfort yon, adorn you, and never
quit -yo_u———which will open to you the kingdom of thought,
and all the boundless regions of conception, as an asylum
against the cruelty, the injustice, and the pain, that may be
your lot in the outer world——that which will make your motives
habitually great and honorable, and light up in an instant "a
thousand noble disdains at the very thought of meanness and
of fraud? . .

8. Therefore, if any young man have embarked his life in
pursuit of knowledge, let him go on without doubting or fearing
the event; let him not be intimidated by the cheerless begin-
nings of knowledge, by the darkness from which she springs,
by the difficulties which hover around her, by the wretched
habitations in which she dwells, by the want and sorrow which
sometimes journey in her train; but let him ever follow her
as the Angel that guards him, and as the Genius of‘ his life.
She will bring him out at last into the light of day, and exhibit
him to the world comprehensive in acquirements, fertile in
resources, rich in imagination, strong in reasoning‘, prudent and
powerful above his ‘fellows in all the relations, and in all the
offices of life.

NEGLECT OF HEALTH.
SAMUEL JOHNSON.
1. Among the innumerable follies, by which we lay up in our
youth repentance and remorse for the succeeding part of our
lives, there is scarce any against which warnings are of less
eﬂicacy than the neglect of health. When the springs of mo-
tion are yet elastic, when the heart bounds with vigor, and the
eye sparkles with spirit, it is with diﬁiculty that we are taught

to conceive the imbecility that every hour is bringing upon us,-

or to imagine that the nerves which are new braced with so
much strength, and the limbs which play with so much activ-
ity, will lose all their power under the gripe of time, relax with
numbness, and totter With debility.

2. To the arguments which have been used against com-
plaints -under the miseries of life, the ;philosophers have, I

* think, forgotten to add the incredulity of those to whom we re-

count our sufferings. But, if the purpose of lamentati on be to
excite pity, it is surely superﬂuous for age and wealmess to tell
their plaintive stories; for pity presupposes sympathy, and a
little attention will show them, that those who do not feel pair,
seldom think that it is felt; and a short recollection will inform
almost every man that he is only repaid the insult which he
has given, since he may remember how often he has mocked
inﬁrmitv,'laughed at its cautions, and censured its impatience.

PREFACE.

Tm: books composing the series of which the present volume is
the closing number, have always found singular favor in the schools,
because of their peculiar adaptation to the purposes of teaching.
This feature is more or less obvious on every page, though often
discernible in particulars which experienced eyes alone could be ex-
pected to see and appreciate. '

They are no fortuitous collections of reading matter, designed to
attract attention by the mere force of novelty. Novelty? they have,
indeed, as much,——perhaps, more than will be found in any other
Works of similar design. But novelty is not their only, nor even
their chief commendation. They are prepared with careful and
minute reference to many educational wants and uses.

Addressing themselves, in the outset, to early childhood, they
naturally deal in easy Words and easy sentences, simple subjects and
pictorial illustrations: the lessons being everywhere accompanied
With appropriate exercises in spelling, pronunciation and definition,
together With numerous collateral hints, cautious and instructions,
all contributing to the one result, that of securing a steady, sys-
tematic progress.

Advancing still, by easy gradations, and aiming at complete de-
velopment, they gradually Widen the circle of precept and prac-
tice, till it comes, at last, to embrace almost all possible styles and
subjects, as also all rules and principles, involved in a full and thor-
ough course of Elocutionary training. Hence it results, that each
previous book, in the series, is a sort of pioneer to that which comes
next in order, though each performs its appropriate part, and is
complete in itself T

If, however, thevvhole purpose of these books were answered in
producing good readers, or, rather, in. supplying the means of pro-
ducing good readers, though they Would undoubtedly, in that case,
be entitled to the praise of distinguished usefulness, still would they
be far from reaching the measure of excellence contemplated in their
preparation. They do, indeed, aim at making accomplished read»

ers. But with this, their ‘leading design, they couple other objects

of the highest moment. They show the respect which is due to
youth, by not only training the voice and giving graceful utterance
to the tongue, but by carefully excluding from that Which must
often be read, as an exercise in school, whatever might justly be
thought offensive to good taste, good manners, or good morals.
Thus they stand, from first to last, in pointed contrast with that
mixed, and, therefore, often mischievous, kind of reading, Which,

3. The valatudinarian race have made the care of health
ridiculous by suﬁ”ering it to prevail over all other considerations,

_as the miser has brought frugality into contempt, by permitting

the love of money not to share, but to engross, his mind : they
both err alike, by confounding the means with the end; they
grasp at health only to be well, as at money only to be rich;
and f’=.3rget that every terrestrial advantage is chieﬂy valuable as
it furnishes abilities for the exercise of virtue.

4. Health is indeed so necessary to all the duties, as well as
pleasures, of life, that the crime of squandering it is equal to
the folly ;' and he that for a short gratiﬁcation brings weakness
and diseases upon himself, and for the pleasure of a few years
passed inthe tumults of diversion and clamors of merriment,
condemns the maturer and more experienced part of his life to
the chamber and the couch, may be justly reproached, not only
as a spendthrift of his own happiness, but as a robber of the
public,~———as a wretch that has voluntarily disqualiﬁed himself for
the business of his station, and refused that part which Provi-
dence assigns him in the general task of human nature.

5. There are, perhaps, very few conditions more to be pitied
than that of an active and elevated mind laboring under the
weight of a distempered body. The time of such a man is
always spent in forming schemes, which a change of wind hin-
ders him from executing; his powers fume away in projects
and in hope, and the day of action never arrives. He lies clown
delighted with the thoughts of to—morrow, pleases his ambition
with the fame he shall acquire, or his benevolence with the
good he shall confer. But in the night the skies are overcast,
the temper of the air is changed, he wakes in languor, impa-
tience, and distraction, and has no longer any wish but for ease,
nor any attention but to misery. A

6. It may besaid that disease generally begins that equality
which death completes; the distinctions which set one man so
much above another, are very little perceived in the gloom of a
sick chamber, where it will be vain to expect entertainment

glory" is obliterated, the wit is clouded, the reasoner perplexed,
and the hero subdued; where the highest and brightest of
mortal beings ﬁnds nothing left him but the consciousness of
innocence. ”

7. There is among the fragments of the Greek poets a short
hymn to Health, in which her power of exalting the happiness
of life, of hightening the gifts of fortune, and adding enjoy-
ment to possession, is inculcated with so much force and beauty
that no one, who has ever languished under the discomforts and
inﬁrmities of a lingering disease, can read it without feeling the
images dance in his heart, and adding, from his own experi-
ence, new vigor to the wish, and from his own imagination new
colors to the picture. The particular occasion of this little
composition is not known, but it is probable that the author
had been sick, and in the ﬁrst raptures of returning vigor ad-
dressed Health in the following manner :

8. “Health, most venerable of the powers of heaven! with
thee may the remaining part of my life be passed, nor do thou
refuse to bless me with thy residence. For whatever there is
of beauty or of pleasure in wealth, in descendants, or in sove-
reign command, the highest summit of human enjoyment, or
in those objects of human desire which we endeavor to chase
into the toils of love; whatever delight, or whatever solace is
granted by the celestials, to soften our fatigues, in thy presence,
thou parent of happiness, all those joys spread out, and ﬂour
ish; in thy presence blooms the spring of pleasure, and with
out thee no man is happy.”

9. Such is the power of health, that without its co-operation
every other comfort is torpid and lifeless, as the powers of
vegetation without the sun. And yet this bliss is commonly
thrown’ away in thoughtless negligence, or in foolish experiments
on our own strength; we let it perish without remembering
its value, or waste it to show how much we have to spare; it is
sometimes given up to the management of levity and chance,
and sometimes sold for the applause of jollity and debauchery.

10. Health is equally neglected, and with equal impropriety,

by the votaries of business and the followers of pleasure. Some
men ruin the fabric of their bodies by incessant revels, and
others by intemperate studies; some batter it by excess, and
others sap it by inactivity. To the noisy rout of bacchanalian
rioters, it will be to little purpose that advice is offered, though
it requires no great ability to prove, that he loses pleasure, who
loses health; their clamors are too loud for the whispers of
caution, and they run the course of life with too much precipit-
ance to stop at the call of wisdom.

11. Nor, perhaps, will they that are busied in adding thou»

sands to thousands, pay much regard to himthat shall direct ;

them to hasten more slowly to their wishes. Yet, since lovers
of money are generally cool, deliberate, and thoughtful, they
might surely consider, that the greater good ought not to be
sacrificed tothe less. Health is certainly more valuable than
money, because it is by health that money is procured; but
thousands and millions are of small avail to alleviate the
protracted tortures of the gout, to repair the broken organs of
sense, or resuscitate the powers of digestion. Poverty is, in-
deed, an evil from which we naturally ﬂy; but let us not run
from one enemy to another, nor take shelter in the arms of
sickness.

nd, rather than he will lose the news, he rides back with him
to appose* him of tidings ; and then to the next man he meets,
he supplies the wants of his hasty intelligence, and makes up a
perfect tale; wherewith he so haunteth the patient auditor, that,
after many excuses, he is fain to endure rather the censures of
his manners in running away, than the tediousness of an imper-
tinent discourse.

2. His speech is oft broken off with a succession of long par-
entheses, which he ever vows to ﬁll up ere the conclusion; and,
perhaps, would effect it, if the other’s car were as unweariable as
his tongue. If he see_ but two men talk, and read a letter in
the street, he runs to them, and asks if he may not be partner
of that secret relation ; and, if they deny it, he offers to tell, since
he may not hear, wonders; and then falls upon the report of
the Scottish mine, or of the great ﬁsh taking up at Lynn, or of
the freezing of the Thames ; and, after many thanks and dismis-
sions, is hardly entreated silence.

3. He undertakes as much as he performs little. This man
will -thrust himself forward to be the guide of the way he knows
not; and calls at his neighbor’s window, and asks why his ser-
vants are not at work. The market hath no commodity which
he prizeth not, and which the next table shall not hear recited.
His tongue, like the tails of Samson’s foxes, carries ﬁrebrands,
and is enough to set the whole ﬁeld of the world on a ﬂame.
Himself begins table-talk of his neighbor at another’s board, to
whom he hears the first news, and adjures him to conceal the
reporter; whose choleric answer he returns to his ﬁrst host, en-
larged with a second edition : so, as it uses to be done in the

‘tight of unwilling mastitfs, he claps each on the side apart, and

provokes them to an eager conﬂict.

4. There can no ‘act pass without his comment; which is
ever far-fetched, rash, suspicious, dilatory. His ears are long,
and his eyes quick, but most of all to imperfections; which, as
he easily sees, so he increases with intermecldling. He harbors
another man’s servant ; and, amid his entertainment, asks what

enemies; neither is it possible that any should not hate him,
but who know him not. So, then, he labors without thanks,

“This poem,” says Cleveland, “appeared anonymously in ‘Davison’s

I have therefore given it a place here with his poems, although there is
no certainty» about it. Sir Egerton Brydges, always good authority in
every question of English Literature, places it at the end of his edition
of Raleigl1’s poems, and says: ‘I know no author so capable of writing
it as Raleigh; but, whoever was the author, it is a poem of uncommon
beauty and merit, and glowing with all that moral, pathos, which is one
of the first charms in the compositions of genius.’ It is here printed
aslin Sir E. Brydges’s edition.” _

outside of the school-room, is perpetually pressingitself upon youth-
ful attention.

The present volume is in perfect harmony with all the rest of the
series. It is called the HIGH ScHcoL READER, not merely because it
is specially adapted to the Wants of the higher classes in academi-
cal institutions, but because, moreover, it aims to furnish such lofty
models of style, of sentiment, of tone, and tendency, as can not fail
to exercise an ennobling, elevating influence over the impressible
nature of youth.

It explains and illustrates, With ample sufﬁciency of detail, all
those features of a ﬁnished delivery, at all attainable through the
agency of formal rules and deﬁnitions: not, however, assuming the
place of the living teacher, and affecting to accomplish his office
Without requiring his presence, but merely co—operating With him
in the discharge of a most important part of his duty.

It presents a vast variety of exercises in reading, selected, adapted

and arranged With the greatest care: exhibiting specimens of almost .

every sort of composition, reckoned superior in its Way; and afford--
ing the finest opportunities for observing these rare felicities of style
and diction, those enchanting beauties and sublimities of thought,
Which invariably distinguish the Works of genius in every Walk of
literature.

It remembers that the young reader is often in danger of losing
the finest impressions, through some ignorance of particular persons,
places or things, mentioned, or alluded to, in the piece he is reading.
For this reason, explanatory notes, illustrating various matters in
the text, are frequently inserted throughout the entire volume; and
yet not with such frequency as to engender the odium that always
attaches to cumbersome commentary.

It considers, like every other member of the series, the natural
vivacity of youth, its quick perception of right and Wrong in the or-
dinary transactions of life, and its insuperable aversion to all somber
moralizing. It, therefore, abounds in Whatever is stirring and
sprightly,—-in narrative, in dialogue, in aliegory; Where scenes, and
circumstances, and characters, full of interest on other accounts, are
made to present, in many Ways, the contrast between vice and vir-
tue, and often incidentally to reveal the moral quality of an action
With such force and clearness as can seldom, if ever, come Within
the reach of any direct and formal teaching Whatever.

Such’ is abrief outline of the course of instruction and practice,
contained in Sanders’ Series of Reading Books, in general, and of
this one, in particular. It seemed ﬁt in this, the last of the series, to
give some such general view, that the author, in closing his labors in
this direction, might leave a parting _indication of the plan and pur-
pose of those Works, in the preparation and improvement of which
he has expended so much time, and Which, Whatever be their merits
or demerits, are, at this moment more or less used in almost every
regior or district in the World, Where there are English schools, or
an E2 _,g2.‘sl1 community.

MA.N’S WANTS NECESSARY TO HIS IMPROVEMENT AND

HAPPINESS.
‘DANIEL WEBSTER.

1. ’Man’s grand distinction is his intellect, his mental capac-
ity. It is this which renders ‘him highly and peculiarly re-

sponsible to his Creator. It is this, on account of which the

rule over other animals is established in his hands; and it is
this, mainly, which enables him to exercise dominion over the
powers of nature, and to subdue them to himself.

2. But it is, also, true that his own animal organization gives
him superiority, and is among the most wonderful of the works
of God on earth. It contributes to cause, as well as prove, his
elevated rank in creation. His “port is erect, his face toward

' heaven, and he is furnished with limbs which are not absclutel y

necessary to his support or locomotion, and which are at once
powerful, ﬂexible, capable of innumerable modes and varieties
of action, and terminated by an instrument of wonderful, heav-
enly workmanship——the human hand. _ p

of acting with great effect upon external objects, in pursuance
of the suggestions of his understanding, and of applying the re-
sults of his reasoning power to his own purposes. Without this
peculiar formation, he would not be man, with whatever sagacity
he might be endowed.

4. N o bounteous grant of intellect, were it the pleasure of
Heaven to make such grant, could raise any of the brute crea~
tion to an equality with the human race. Were it bestowed on
the leviathan, he must remain, nevertheless, in the elemem
where he alone could maintain his physical existence. He
would still be but the inelegant, misshapen inhabitant of the
ocean, “ wallowing unwieldy, enormous in his gait.”

5. Were, the elephant made to possess it, it would but teach
him the deformity of his own structure; the unloveliness of his
frame, though “the hugest of things ;” his disability to act on
external matter, and the degrading nature of his own physical
wants, which lead him to the deserts, and give him for his favorite

W home the torrid plains of the tropics. It was placing the King

of Babylon sufficiently out of the rank of human beings, though
he carried all his reasoning faculties with him, when he was
sent away to eat grass, like the ox.

6. And this may properly suggest to our consideration, what
isundeniably true, that there islhardly a greater blessing con-
ferred on man than his natural wants. If he had wanted no
more than the beasts, who can say how much more than they
he would have attained? Does he associate? Does he culti-
vate ? Does he build? Does he navigate? The original im-
pulse to all these lies in his wants. It proceeds from the neces-
sities of his condition, and from the efforts of unsatisﬁed desire.

7. Every want, not of a low kind, physical as well as moral,
which the human breast feels, and which brutes do not feel, and
can not feel, raises man by so much in the scale of existence,
and is a clear proof, and a direct instance, of the favor of’ God
toward His so much favored human offspring. If man had been
so made as to have desired nothing, he would have wanted
almost every thing Worth possessing.

VISION OF SUDDEN DEATH.*
THOMAS DE QUINCEY.
1. Before us lay an avenue, straight as an arrow, six hundred
yards, perhaps, in length; and the umbrageous trees, which
rose in a regular line from either side, meeting high over-
head, gave to it the character of a cathedral aisle. These’
trees lent a deeper solemnity to the early light; but there was
Still light enough to perceive, at the further end of this gothic
aisle, a light, reedy gig, in which were seated a young man,
and, by his side, a young lady. The little carriage is creeping
on at one mile an hour; and the parties within it are naturally
bending down their heads. Between them and eternity, to all
human calculation, there is but a minute and a half. I
shouted--and the young man heard me not. A second time
I shouted—-and now he heard me, for now he raised his head.
2. Here, then, all had been done that, by me, could be done ;
more on my part was not possible. Mine had been the ﬁrst
step: the second was for the young man: the third was for
God. Sudden had been the call upon him, and sudden was
his answer to the call. He saw, he heard, he comprehended,
the ruin that was coming down: already its gloomy shadow
darkened above him; and already he was measuring his strength
to deal with it. VVhat a sublime thing does courage seem,
when some fearful crisis on the great deeps of life carries a man,
as if running before a hurricane, up to the giddy crest of some
mountainous wave, from which, accordingly, as he choses his
course, he descries two courses, and a voice says to him audibly,
“ This way lies hope; take the other way, and mourn forever!”
3. Yet, even then, amidst the raving of the seas and the frenzy
of the danger, the man is able to confront his situation——-is able

to retire for a moment into solitude with God, and to seek all his
counsel from Him. For seven seconds, it might be, of his sev-
enty, the stranger settled his countenance steadfastly upon us, as
if to search and value every element in the conflict before him.
For ﬁve seconds more he sate immovably, like one that mused
on some great purpose. For ﬁve he sate with eyes upraised,
like one that prayed in sorrow, under some extremity of doubt,
for‘ wisdom to guide him toward the better choice.

4. Then suddenly he rose; stood upright; and, by a sudden
strain upon the reins, raising his horse’s forefeet from the ground,
he slewed him round on the pivot of his hind legs, so as to plant
the little equipage in a position nearly at right angles to ours.
Thus far his condition was not improved ; except as a ﬁrst step
had been taken toward the possibility of a second. If no more
were done, nothing was done ; for the little carriage still occu-
pied the very center of our path, though in an altered direc-
tion. Yet even now it may not be too late: ﬁfteen of the
twenty seconds may still be -unexhausted; and one almighty
bound forward may avail to clear the ground._

5. Hurry, then, hurry! for the ﬂying moments——they hurry!
Oh hurry, hurry, my brave young man! for the cruel hoofs
of our horses—-—they also hurry! Fast are the ﬂying moments,
faster are the hoofs of our horses. Fear not for him, if human
energy can suffice; faithful was he that drove, to his terriﬁc
duty; faithful was the horse to his command. One blow, one
impulse given with voice and hand by the stranger, one rush
from the horse, one bound as if in the act of rising to a fence,
landed the docile creature’s forefeet upon the crown or, arching
center of the road. The larger half of the little equipage had
then cleared our overtowering shadow : i that was evident even
to my own agitated sight.

6. But it mattered little that one wreck should ﬂoat off
in safety, if upon the wreck that perished were embarked the
human freightage. The rear part of the carriage—-—was that
certainly beyond the line of absolute ruin? VVhat power could

question and the answer, and divide the one from the other?
Light does not tread upon the steps of light more indivisibly,
than did our all-conquering arrival upon the escaping efforts of
the gig.
‘ 7. That must the young man have felt too plainly. His back
was now turned to us; not by sight could he any longer com-
municate with the peril; but by the dreadful rattle of our
harness, too truly had his ear been instructed——that all was
ﬁnished as regarded any further eﬂbrt of his. Already in
resignation he had rested from his struggle; and, perhaps, in
his heart he was whispering—-“ Father, which art above, do
thou ﬁnish in heaven what I on earth have attempted.” We
ran past them faster than ever mill-race in our inexorable
ﬂight. _

8. Oh, raving of hurricanes that must have sounded in their

young ears at the moment of our transit! With the swingle- -

bar we had struck the off-wheel of the little gig, which stood
rather obliquely and not quite so far advanced as to be accur-
ately parallel with the near wheel. The blow, from the fury of
our passage, resounded terriﬁcally. From my elevated station
I looked down, and looked back ‘upon the scene, which in a
moment told its tale, and wrote all its records on my heart for-
ever. The horse was planted immovably with his forefeet upon
the paved crest of the central road. He, of the whole party,
was alone untouched by the passion of death. I V

9. The little caney carriage—partly, perhaps, from the dread
Iul torsion of the wheels in its recent movement, partly from
the thundering blow we had given to it—-—as if it sympathized
with human horror, was all alive withtremblings and shiverings.
The young man sat like a rock. He stirred not at all. But
his was the ‘steadiness of agitation frozen into rest by horror.
As yet he dared not to look round; for he knew that, if any
thing remained to do, by him it could no longer be done.

threw up her arms wildly to heaven, clutched at some visionary
object in the air, fainting, praying, raving, despairing! Figure
to yourself the hlements of the case; suffer me to recall before
your minds the circumstances of the unparalleled situation.
From the silence and deep peace of this saintly summer night

light, dreamlight—-—suddenly as from the Woods and ﬁelds--
suddenly as from the chambers of the air opening in revelation
———suddenly as from the ground yawning at her feet, leaped
upon her, with the ﬂashing of cataracts, Death the crowned
phantom, with all the equipage of his terrors, and the tiger
roar of his voice.

11. The moments Were numbered. In the twinlzling of an
eye our ﬂying horses had carried us to the termination of the
umbrageous aisle ; at right angles we wheeled into our former
direction; the turn of the road carried the scene out of my
eyes in an instant, and swept it into my dreams forever.

tunateness, or happiness; and I can see no advantage in the
improper use of Words, when proper terms are to be found,
but, on the contrary, much mischief. For, by familiarizing the
mind to equivocal expressions, that is, such as may be taken in
two or more different meanings, we introduce confusion of
thought, and furnish the sophist with his best and handiest
tools. For the juggle of sophistry consists, for the greater part,
in using a word in one sense in the premise, and in another
sense in the conclusion. _

2. We should accustom ourselves to think and reason in

precise and steadfast terms, even when custom, or the deﬁ-
ciency, or the corruption of the language, will not ‘permit the
same strictness in speaking. The mathematician ﬁnds this so
necessary to the truths which he is seeking, that his science
begins with, and is founded on, the deﬁnition of his terms. The
botanist, the chemist, the anatomist, &c., feel and submit to
this necessity at all costs, even -at the risk of exposing their
several pursuits to the ridicule of the many, by technical terms,
hard to be remembered, and alike quarrelsome to the ear and
the tongue.

3. In the business of moral and religious reﬂection, in the
acquisition of clear and distinct conceptions of our duties, and
of the relations in which we stand to God, our neighbor, and
ourselves, no such difficulties occur. At the utmost, we have
only to rescue words, already existing and familiar, from the
false or vague meanings imposed on them by carelessness, or
by the clipping and debasing misusage of the market. And
surely happiness, duty, faith, truth, and ﬁnal blessedness, are
matters of deeper and dearer interest for all men than circles
to the geometrician, or the characters of plants to the botanist,
or the aﬁinities and the combiningprinciple of the elements of
bodies to the chemist, or even than the mechanism, (fearful and

«Wonderful thoughit be I) of the perishable Tabernacle of the

Soul can be to the anatomist. .

A 4. Among the aids to reﬂection, place the following maxim
prominent: Let distinctness in expression advance side by side
with distinction in thought. For one useless subtlety in our
elder ‘ divines and moralists, I will produce ten sophisms of
equivocation in the vvritings of our modern preceptors; and
for one error resulting in excessin distinguishing the indiffer-
ent, I would show ten mischievous delusions from the habit of
confounding the diverse.

1. There is, even on this side the. grave, a haven where the
storms of life break not, or are felt but in gentle undulations
of the unrippled and mirroring waters,—-=-an oasis, not in the
desert, but beyond it,--—a rest, profound and blissful as that of
the soldier returned forever from the dangers, the hardships,
and turmoil of war, to the bosom of that dear domestic circle,
whose blessings he never prized at half their worth till he lost
them.

The tired traveler has abandoned the dusty, crowded, and ostling
highway of life, for one of its shadiest and least noted by-lanes.
The din of traﬁic and of worldly strife has no longer magic for
his ear,——the myriad footfall on the city’s stony walks is but
noise or nothing to him now. He has run his race of toil, or
trade, or ambition. His day’s work is accomplished, and he
has come home to enjoy, tranquil and unharrassed, the splen-
dor of the sunset, the milder glories of late evening.

3. Ask not Whether he has or has not been successful, accord«
ing to the vulgar standard of success. What matters it now
whether the multitude has dragged his chariot, rending the air
with idolizing acclamations, or howled like Wolves on his track,

as he ﬂed by night from the fury of those he had wasted his vigor ‘

to serve? ‘VVhat avails it that broad lands have rewarded his
toil, or that all has, at the last moment, been stricken from his
grasp ‘.3’ Ask not whether he brings into retirement the Wealth
of the Indies or the poverty of a bankrupt,——whether his couch
be of down or rushes,——his dwelling a hut or a mansion.

4. He has lived to little purpose, indeed, if he has not long since
realized that wealth a.nd renown are not the true ends of exe1'-
tion, nor their absence the conclusive proof of ill-fortune. Who-
ever seeks to know, if his career has been prosperous and
brightening from its outset to its close,———if the evening of his
days shall be genial and blissful,-—-should ask not for broad
acres, or towering ediﬁces, or laden coffers. Perverted old
age may grasp these with the unyielding clutch of insanity ‘; but
they add to his cares and anxieties, not to his enjoyments. Ask
rather,———“ Has he mastered and harmonized his erring passions?
Has he lived a true life ?”

5. A true life! Of how many lives does each hour knell
the conclusion, and how few of them are true ones! The poor
child of shame, and sin, and crime, who terminates her earthly
being in the clouded morning of her scarce budded, yet
blighted existence,——the desperate felon, whose blood is shed by
the community, as the dread penalty of its violated law,-—the
miserable debauchee, who totters down to his loathsome grave
in the springtime of his years, but the fullness of his fertering
iniquities,—-these, the world valiantly affirms, have not lived
true lives.

6. Fearless and righteous. world 1' how profound, how dis-

pleasure,———the man of ignoble and sinister ambition,-——the
Woman of ' frivolity, extravagance, and fashion,———the idler, the
gambler, the voluptuary,——on all these and their myriad com-
peers, While borne on the crest of the advancing billow, how
gentle is the reproof, how charitable the judgment of the
World!

7. How many are clearly, vividly impressed with the great

truth, that each, in his own sphere, should live for mankind,

as Christ did, for the redemption, instruction, and exaltation of
the race, and that the power to do this, in his proper sphere,
abides equally with the humblest as the highest?

8. A true life must be simple in all its elements. Animated
by one grand and ennobling impulse, all lesser aspirations ﬁnd
their proper places in harmonious subservience. Simplicity in

taste, in appetite, in habits of life, with a corresponding indifFer- «

ence to worldly honors and aggrandizement, is the natural re-
sult of the predominance of a divine and unselﬁsh idea. Under
the guidance of such a sentiment, virtue is not an effort, but a
law of nature, like gravitation. It is vice alone that seems un-
accountable,-~monstrous,——Well-nigh miraculous. Purity is felt
to be as necessary to the mind as health to the body, and its
absence alike the inevitable source of pain.

9. A true life must be calm. A life imperfectly directed is
made wretched through distraction. We give up our youth to
excitement, and wonder that a decrepit old age steals upon us
so soon. VVe Wear out our energies in strife for gold or fame",
and then Wonder alike at the cost and the Worthlessness of the
meed. “Is not the life more than meat?” Ay, truly! but
how few have practically, consistently, so regarded it! And
little as it is regarded by the imperfectly virtuous, how much
less by the vicious and the Worldling ?

10. What a chaos of struggling emotions is exhibited by
the lives of the multitude! How like the’; Wars of the

infuriated animalculae in a magniﬁed drop of Water, is the

strife constantly waged in each little mind? How Sloth is
iostled by Gluttony, and Pride wrestled with .by_ Avarice,

and Ostentation bearded by Meanness! The soul which is
not large enough for the indwelling of one virtue, affords
lodgment, and scope, and arena for a hundred vices. But
their Warfare can not be indulged with impunity. Agita-
tion and wretchedness are the inevitable consequences, in the
midst of which the ﬂame of life burns ﬂaringly and swiftly to
its close.

11. A true life must be genial and joyous. The man who is
not happy in the path hehas chosen, may be very sure hehas
chosen amiss, or is self—deceived. But not merely happier,———
he should be kinder, gentler, and more ela.stic in spirits, as Well
as ﬁrmer and truer. “I love God and little children,” says a
German poet. The good are ever attracted and made happier,
by the presence of the innocent and lovely; and he who ﬁnds
his religion averse to, or a restraint upon, the truly innocent
pleasures and gayeties of life, so that the latter do not interfere
With, and jar upon, its sublimer objects, may well doubt Whether
he has indeed “learned of Jesus.”

ASPIRATION AND ACHIEVEMENT.
ROBERT CHAMBERS.

1. -To a limited apprehension, it Would seem as if the greater
part of the existence here allotted us, Were little more than an
apprenticeship to the business of living; and that, if ever ‘We
come to understand our authentic position and relations in the
world, and how our time and talents might have been wisely
and most effectually employed,’ it is at a stage of life, when the
journey is drayving to a close, and hardly an opportunity is
left us to turn What we have been learning to account.

2. Are We to suppose, then, that the life of man is essentially
a failure? We1'e We created but to be baffled in our efforts to
accomplish What all our instincts and intuitions urge us so im-

. HIGH scHooL READER. 89

peratively to attempt? Plainly enough, men every where fall
short of W hat they hope for, a.nd what they aim after: it is the
universal lamentation that the promise of existence is _never re-
alized; but are we, therefore, to conclude that life is ‘utterly a
delusion, and that it is impossible to achieve the objects which,
as active and discerning beings, we seem destined to pursue?
(<) Is it rationally conceivable that we are doomed by an in-
exorable necessity to spend our strength in vain, and, in aiming
to reach the hights of our desires, must forever advance only
to be prostrated by the force of hostile circumstances?

3. Life can never have been enforced upon us on such unfair

conditions. That which we have been sent into the world to do,
we are assuredly competent to perform. The ideal of our existence
undoubtedly admits of being wrought into a practical result, of
taking shape and embodiment as a satisfactory realization.
What the Divine Power has proposed as the end of human life,
that, in the nature of things, must be actually attainable; for it
is held as a fundamental principle, that God has ordained the
well-being of humanity; and, if this be a right conclusion, it
must, also, be admittedithat men are endowed with such capaci-
ties as are needed for the fulﬁllment of the divine intention.

4. VVithout this adaptationof the constitution of human na-
ture to the order and arrangements of the material creation, and
to such moral conditions as men are appointed to be conformable,
there ‘would be no happiness or well-being possible tr mankind:
men would be as unrelated aliens in the universe, cursed with

faculties which they could not exercise, and exposed to an un-,

equal conﬂict with external powers, which must end only in
their own confusion and defeat. Thus their destiny would be
one of unmitigable misery : not the welfare, but the everlasting
perplexity and despair of the human race, would seem to be dew
creed; and over the portals of existence might be written, as
above the gates of Dante’s hell—-
'Abandon hope, all ye that enter here.

5. It is our faith, at least, that God has built the world and

created man for an end worthy of Himself, and that in His wis-

9O SANDERS NEW snnrns.

A
V

dom He has not failed to provide the means by which the end
may be accomplished. Undoubtedly, the powers of humanity
are equal to all the tasks and duties required of it, and to the
ultimate attainment of the grandest destination. In himself are
centered all the attributes and faculties which, being appropri-
ately developed, are essentially to a man’s practical well-being.

6. No portion of his constitution has been assigned to him
without its corresponding use and adaptation. His wildest de-
sires only indicate the range of his capacities. He has no
thought or hope which_ points not to a possible accomplishment.
He is born for the exercise of power, for conquest and dominion
over the forces of external nature, for the command and gov-
ernment of his own riotous propensities, and for the general dis-
cernment and adoption of truth, order, and perfection.

7. Small as he may look against the mass and incommensur-
able variety of the universe, he is invested with a potency of in-
tellect and will, which, considered in its results, may be justly
pronounced august, and even splendid. Look how, through
successive generations, he has changed the face of the visible
creation! How diﬁerent the aspect of the world since the days,
when the race began ﬁrst to explore and work in it! The ag-
gregate of achievement here is literally incalculablel It was
not all barren, that toil and enterprise of the foregone years and
ages which we brieﬂy denominate the past.

' 8. Through difficulty and danger man has wrought, and suf-
fered, and left imperishable works behind him. The visible re-
alized world of towered cities, of nations, monarchies, republics,
and other manifold institutions, are all the product of his ex-
pansive brain and active hands, and, defective as they look in
some respects, are grand enough to do him honor. Let us not
disparage this wondrous being, in whose image we are formed,
and whose glorious breath we breathe ; nor deny to our buried
ancestry the homage which beﬁts that worth and excellency
whose memorial-stones are standing where last they worked and
fell. For the habitable globe is, in some sort, the shrine and
temple of the departed ages, and therein is gathered all the suf-

fering and laborious dust that was spent in building it to the
hight and circumference of its visible magniﬁcence!

9. Man, we repeat, is great, and equal to the destiny before A
him. Doubtless, in past times, he has consummated many er-.

rors, and, in every successive day of his prolonged existence, he
is still liable to mistake and failure; but, -taking the measure of
his blunders over a reasonable range of time, it will be seen that
he steadily advances. The errors of ﬁve ‘hundred years ago
were something very different from the ordinary short-comings
of to-day. A constant progress is visible in the ideas, the in-

stitutions, and. moral tendencies which successively take posses-“

sion of the world; and, through the prevailing inﬂuence of the
ascendent principles, our humanity goes forward toward the
perfecting of its nature. ' ‘

10. VVhatsoever seeming retrogressions there may be, in the
ﬁnal comparison of the ages, there is an undeniable advancement.
And this is the consequence of an increasing and clearer knowl-
edge of the ordained conditions of human life, and of a more
strict obedience to the laws by which our existence is overruled.
A perfect conformity to those conditions would result in the
actual realization of human welfare. Man would be no longer

frustrated .in his strivings after happiness, but, in mind, body, .

and estate, he would reach the full completion of his powers,
and derive from their employment a whole and perfect satis~
faction.

EXERCISE XIX.

ASPIRATION AND ACHIEVEMENT. (CONTINUED.)

1. All shortcoming and imperfection in the ways of human
life, are the consequence of an insuﬂicient adaptation of our na-
ture to the appointed conditions of well-being. As an acute
thinker has observed : “ Every suffering incident to the human
body, from a headache up to a fatal illness—from a burn or a.

92 SANDERS’ NEW snnrns

L
v

sprain toaccidental loss of life, is traceable to the having placed
that body in a situation for which its powers did not ﬁt it. Nor
is the expression conﬁned in its application to physical evil : it
comprehends moral evil also.

2. Is the l:ind—hearted man distressed by the sight of misery?
Is the bachelor unhappy, because his means will not permit him
to marry ? Does the mother mourn over her lost child ? Does
the emigrant lament leaving his fatherland? Are some made
uncomfortable by having to pass their lives in distasteful occu-
pation, and others from having no occupation at all ? The ex-
planation is still the same. No matter what the special nature
of the evil, it is invariably reférrible to the one generic cause——
want of congruity between the faculties and their sphere of
action.” To diminish the evil or discomfort of their situation,
whatsoever the situation may chance to be, men must approach
closer to the ideal law of their constitution———-must seek, in short,
to ada.pt their aims and purposes to the unchangeable conditions
on which human welfare, and the success of its Varied interests,
are, in the nature of things, dependent.

3. From the platform of this idea, we are readily enabled to
apprehend the uses of aspiring inclinations. ‘Their very pres-
ence in the mind would seem to indicate a natural and effective
function; and this, on consideration, will be found to be the
fact. The office of aspiration, as we take it, is to stimulate ex-
ertion, to induce the man to unfold the powers that are latent
in his nature, and thus to bring him eventually to a state of
mind and character, whereby the ends of his creation may be
answered. Whoever earnestly desires to accomplish any thing
of eminent note or service in the world, may he usually con-
sidered as thereby giving token of a probable capacity in that
direction. >

4. The capabilities of man foreshadow that which he should
do: every tendency within him has reference to the ends of his
existence, and may be developed to the extent of its limitations,
in working out the purposes of a rational activity. The nature
of this activity is indicated by the leading aptitudes of the in-

HIGH scnoor. READER. 93

A
i

dividual, which ought to determine the specialties of his edu-
cation, and direct him toward pursuits in which he can most
effectually manifest his powers. By endeavoring to realize his
aspirations, he will best fulﬁll the objects of his being.

5. To every man it may oe said: Follow thy genius, that
glowing, lode-star of thy destiny, and it will shine on thee as
thou journeyest with a never-fading radiance, and guide thee
through all untoward and perplexing paths, to the vocation and

the duty which beﬁts thee 1 Our life is so marred and fruitless,

because we miss the work that is most appropriate to our‘facul-
ties, or perversely labor in the pursuit of objects that are not
accordant with the authentic ends of our existence. ‘

6. Could every man “apply himself to employmentswhich are
most suited to his capabilities, and, in his appointed calling,
work only with a View to serviceable, sincere, and ennobling re-
sults, the measure of his achievement might still, perchance, fall
short of his original aspirations; but, being commensurate with
his powers, and conformable to the eternal laws, it could not
fail to yield him that assurance of security and contentment
which by necessity proceeds from all faithfulness of action. As
the very extravagance of our desires is designed to serve a pur-
pose in our constitutional economy, it will be found eventually
that the aspiration is no further in excess than is requisite for
securing a suﬂioiency of achievement————that the one transcends
the other just as the highest wave of the tide dashes further
upon the shore than the rest of the Waters will afterwards ad-
Vance.

7. That discrepancy between the desire and the accomplish-
ment, which was noticed at the beginning, in so far as it im-
plies actual failure of performance, is the plain and natural con-
sequence of the non-observance of the conditions of success.
Aspiration may be misdirected; as when a man, under the inﬂu-
ence of vanity or ambition, aims to achieve something beyond
the compass of his faculties; or when actuated by impure and
contracted motives, he seeks a.fter a selﬁsh or debasing gratiﬁca-
tion. If, after years of painful and unrewarded effort, he should

ﬁnd all his plans of aggranchzement or pleasure unsuccessful or
unsuﬂicing, it becomes him to understand that he has been
working in wrong directions, for objects and purposes that have
no reference to his individual well—being, and which are, there-
fore, incapable of yielding him any abiding satisfactions.

8. It is not for him to complain of the emptiness of life, or
of the delusiveness of human expectation ; for his perverted ex-
istence has had no substantial hold on Nature ; and her recom-
penses are stringently reserved for such only as live in con-
formity with her laws. Had he lived for Nature’s ends, and
thus partaken of her beneﬁts, he would not have profaned her
majesty by questioning the perfection of her ordainments. The
wisdom and celestial beauty that are in her, would have won his
love and admiration, and thrilled his soul with a sacred and im-
passioned thankfulness. Worliing in accordance with her ten-
dencies, he might have realized whatever hope or yearning was
grounded in his character, and made his life the manifestation
of his noblest aims and strivings. I

9. When a man is true and faithful, his “ ambition is exactly
proportioned to his powers.” He will aspire only after that
which is possible to his genius, and be content with the result
which he can wring from his best exertions. Nothing more
can be required of him; and by nothing less can he be justiﬁed
at the tribunal of the universe. Yet let us not account too
much of the offenses of error and shortcoming, which needs
must happen while we remain in this p’ obationary state; for
these are often but as the casual falls and stumblings of a run-
ner well intent upon the race; and the goal of well-doing may
be reached, and the prize achieved, notwithstanding the acci-
d€11.tSiOf the course. -

10. When the inner purpose of a life is true, it will not be
materially impaired by occasional defect of details. From‘ the
divine act‘ of repentance‘ a profounder faith may spring, and,
through renewed effort and persistency, the lost ground may be
recovered. A man VVlil not advance himself by indulging in
uuavailing retrospections, nor anywise better his estate by de-

ploring his instability. The authentic objects of his life are to
be gained only by present action, by doing here and now that
which has hitherto been left undone, and thus progressively
atoning for the deﬁciencies of the past. Neglected opportuni-
tiesmay never again return, but always the possibilities of to-
day are such, that at least something may be done. By steadily
pursuing the ideal, when the soul is once open to discern it, a
man undoubtedly ascends nearer to that perfection for which
nis awakened nature longs, and, in the round of his develop-
ment, fulﬁlls his appointed destination.

EXERCISE XX.

H U M A N L I F E .
HENRY W. LONGFELLOW.

1. Life is one, and universal ; its forms manyand individual.
Throughout this beautiful and wonderful creation, there is never-
ceasing motion, without rest by night or day, ever weaving to
and fro. Swifter than a weaver’s shuttle it ﬂies from birth to
death, from death to birth ; from the beginning seeks the end,
and ﬁnds it not; for the seeming end is only a dim beginning
of a new out-going and endeavor after the end. As the ice
upon the mountain, when the warm breath of the summer’s sun
breathes upon it, melts, and divides into drops, each of which

reﬂects ‘an image of the sun; so life, in the smile of God’s '

love, divides itself into separate forms, each bearing in it and
reﬂecting an image of God’s love.
2. Of all these forms the highest and most perfect in its god-

likeness is the human soul. The vast cathedral of nature is ﬁill

of holy scriptures, and shapes of deep, mysterious meaning;
but all is solitary and silent there; no bending knee, no up»-
lifted eye, no lip adoring, praying. Into this vast cathedral
comes the human soul, seeking its Creator; and the universal
silence is changed to sound, and the sound is harmonious, and
has a meaning, and is comprehended and felt.
