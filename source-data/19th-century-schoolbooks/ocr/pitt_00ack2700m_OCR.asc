UNI2' D S'A'E.S' SPELLING-BOOK.
Havinrg attentively perused the United Stater' Slpelling Book,'
published-by Mr. Cramer of Pittsburgh; I am decidedly of opinion
that it is better calculated for the improvement of the juvenile
learner, than any yet published. The manlifest advantages of this
work over others of a similar natUre, are too nmmerous to be here
noticed. The key to pronunciation, consisting of a few characters
well adapted to the capacities of youth, are obviously an improve.
ment on the arbitrary use of the figures by Mr. Webster; wllicli
by several years' experience I Iave found to be not easily understood by the younger class of learners. The regular and judicious gradation of' spelling tables, properly-divided and accented,
interspersed` with a great variety of useful and entertaining lessons in reading, tend greatly to facilitate instruction, and reflect
peculiar meiit on the laudable exertions of the compilers'. The!able of' words whlich are alike in sound, but diffirent in spelling
and signification,' appears har'dly susceptible of improvement;
also the additional tables of words nearly alike in:-sounld-and
words which are somewhat similar in sound, but-vulgarly sound.
ed alike, cannot but meet'the entire aplprobation of every skilful
instructor
On the whole, I do not hesitate to say, that this work is in fact,
what it professes to be, the production of` experienced teachers;'
and needs only to.be known, to gain general use in American
sc'hools)                            O. C. B. STEWARr.

GRAMM AR is commonly divided into four parts--oorthography, ety mology, syntax and -prosody.
Orthography treats of the letters, their powers and coma
binations in syllables; or, it'teaches the true manner of
writing words, called spelling.  
Etymology treats of the derivation:of words from their
radicals or primitives, and of their various inflections and
modifications to express person, number, cas%, sex, time
and mode.-       -
Syntax explains the true mode of constructinpg sentences;
Prosod y treats of the quantity or accenta of Sylabies and
the laws of versification.
Explanation qf vowels and consonants, syllables and worlds.
Lettersg Syllables, &amp;c.:
A:letter is the least part of a word.
The letters of the English alphabet, are twenty-six.
Letters are divided into vowels and consonants.
Tlhe Vowebs are a e i -o u, and sometimes w and y.#
T'he Consonants b cd f g h j kl mn  p q r s t vw x y z.
A vowel can be sounded by itself.;A oonsonant cannot be sounded distinctly by itself..
A diphthong-is two vowels forming but one svl}able.
-A.triphthong i's three vowels forming but one syllable
as, eau in beau.
A proper diphthong has both the vowels sounded: as,
oi, in voice, OU9 n1 ounce.  
An improper diphthong has but one of the vowels sound
ed: as, ea, in' eagle, oa, in boata   -  
A syllable is so much of a word as can be pronounced
at once o  s as a, an, ant, bit ter, but ter fly.
Words are sounds, used as signs of our thoughts.  
A word of one syllable, is cailed a    monosyllable; a word
of two syllables, a dissyllable; a word of three syllables,
a trisyllable; and a word of four or-more syllables a polysyllab e.
" W and Y are consonlants, when they begin: a -o',d or syllab!e
it other situations, they are vowels.152    TIrE UNITED) STATES' SPELLING BOOK.
Words of two or more syllables have an accent on one
of the syllables.
Accent sigtlifies that stress of'th-e voice, which is laid
on one syllable, to distinguish it from the rest. Thus, in
apple,- the accent is on. the first syllable i and in arise, it is
(on the second syllable. The mark placed above the syliao
ble,: and which denotes the accent,is also called the aceent.
Nouns, Pronouns, &amp;c.
A noun or substantive, is. the name of any. thing: as,
sun, moon, stars.
Eve:ry word that makes sense of itself, is a noun: as,
John, Charles, Pittsburgh; or that takes, a, an, or the before it: as, a tree, an apple, the sun.
A pronoun is the word-used instead of a-noun, to avoid
repeating the noun: as, I, he, she, they; "6Charles is a
good boy, he obeys his parents, and he speasks the truth;:'
instead of saying, "- Charles is a good boy; Charles obeys'his parents, and Charles speaks the truth."'
An adjective is a word thIat signifies the quality of a sub.
stantive. as good, bad, tall, short;a good girl, a tall tree.
An adjective may be generally known, by its imaking
sense with the word t/hing, or any particular nown added to
it-; as, a good thing, a bad thing, a sweet apple.
A verb is a word that signifies being, doing, or su,ffer,
ing: as, I aim, sh1e writes hle -is beaten.
Any word is a verb,. when we can add a pronoun to it.
Thus, eat, read, -play, are verbs; because we can.say,.
eat, she reads, he play s. A verb is also known by its mako'
Ing sense with the word to, put before it;. as, to eat) to
read, to play...  
The singular number signifies one object; as, a tree,
the house,
The plural number signifies more than one object: a
trees, hqmuses-.  
Genders.: -
Gender is the distinction of sex. - There are three genders, the/ Maesuline, the Ferm-inine',and the Neute.
The masculine gender denotes animals of the male kinfld.
as, a man,.a horse, a bull    -  THE JUNTErD- VTATES' SPELiia  BOOS..153
The -femenine gender signifies animals of the female
kind: as a woman, a duck, a hen.
The neuter gender donotes objects which are neither
males nor femates; as a field, a-house, a garden.
Some substanrtives naturally neuter, are, by a figure of
speech, converted into the masculine or feminine gender;
as, when we say of the sun, he is setting, and of a ship, she
sails well, -C-c.

There are six things which the Lord doth hate; yea,
seven that he cannot ab-ide.  -
A proud look, alying tongue, and hands. that shed
innocent blood.
An heart that deviseth wicked things, and feet that
are swift in running to do- mischief.
A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that sowetlh
discord among breihren.

Good children, who behave p,rttily, and whose faces
and hands are clean, are always the first-objects that attract the eye ofa stranger on entering ahouse.  A gen.
tieman asked little -Miary on-e day Whether she could
read, yes sir, she replied, and immediately ran and got
her book and read the following story:.The little Gir4 the Sparro., the Bee andthe dne.
Wao'LL come and.play with me here under the tree,
My sisters have left me alone:
My sweet little sparrow come hither to me,
And play with me while they are gone.
0o ni little lady,-I I'can't come, indeed,
Ive nodtime to idle away,
I've!got all my d'ear little children to feed,
And my nest tonew cover with hay.
Myr sweet pretty Bee, do not buzz in that fl'w'r,
But,come here and play with me, do;
~The.;parrow won't come and stay with me an hour,
But-say, pretty B.e.-.will not you?  
no, little lady, for do not you see,
Those must work who would prosper and thrive,
If I play they would call me a sad idle Bee,
-.And perhaps turn me out of the hive.
Stop! stop. little Ant, do not run off so fast,
Wait with me a little and play;
I hope I shall find a companion at last,
You are not so busy as they,
O no little lady, I can't stay with you,
-we re not made to play but to labour;
always have something or other to do,
If not for myself for a neighbour.
What then have they all some employment but me,
W-ho lie here lounging here like a dunc?
O then like the Ant, and Sparrow, and Bee,

his parents to the feast, after the custbom of the Jews.,
And when the days of.the -feast were over, the peopie
went home; but the child Jesus was still in the city, andJoseph and Mary knew it not.
And when they had gone a day's journey, they found
he was not with them; then they sought. him amongst
their kinsfolk.  -  
f Anrd when the.y foLund him not, they turned back
again to the city to seek him.

And after three days, they found him in -the temple,
sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them
and asking them questions.
And all that heard him were amazed at his undCerm
standing and answers,.
And when they saw him, his mother said unto him,
Son, why hast thou dealt thus with us? Behold thy fa.
ther and I have sought thee nwith sorrow.
And-he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me?
knew yelnot that I m-ast be about my Father's business?

wished her son might learn, and she sent him to school.
As he took pains he learned to read very well.
Whenl he was about twelve y earsof age, his mother
-had-  a:paralytick stro'ke, and lost the-use of her limbs;
so she was obl;ged to lie in bed all day long, and, she
could not spin, or- work any more.
As she had not been able to save any money, she couldnot hire any body to clean her house, and to work for
her; ant she was very much distressed.- A poor woman: who wasi her neighbour used sometimes to call in
to assist her, and to do little jobs for her: but her son
wtvas her great comfort. He said within himself;'"I

LESSON LXIX.
TIE RCH MAff d AiVD LAZARUS.
There was a certaini rich man, who was clothed witlh
pur?le' and fine linen, and fared.umptuously every day.
Alil- there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who
was laid at his gate full of sores, andi desired to be fed
with the crumbs -which fell from the rich man's table::
moreover the dogs came and licked his sores..TIIIE'UNITED STA-TS' SPLLINg BOOK'    65
Andi it came to pass that the beggar died and was
carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom. The rich
man also died and was buried.':
-LESSON LXX           -  
And in hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments,
and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
And he cried, and said, Father. Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of
his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flameo
And Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy
life time recei vedst thy good things,'and likewise Lazarus evil things;!ut now he is comforted and thou art
tormented.
LESSON LXXI.;
And besides all this, between us and you: there is a
great gulf fixed; so that they- which would pass from
hence to you cannot; neither can they pass: to us that
would come from thence.Then he said, I pray thee therefore, Father, that thou. wouldst se-nd him to my father's house: for I have five
brethren: that he may testify unto then, lest they also
come into this place of torment.
Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses andthe:
prophets; let them hear them.
LESSONLXXII. -
And he said, Nay, Father Abraham; but if one went  
unto them from the dead, th-ey would repent.
- And he said unto him, If they hear not Mos,es and
the prophets, neither would they be persuaded though
one rose from the dead.
By this parable of the rich man and Lazarus, which
wa put forth by our dear Lord himself, we may see,
what is to be the portion of the proud, who  t in afflu
ence, glutting themse:ve.s with: the Lord's gifts;.but forD

X  Having reflected much on this subject, we determined'  On the publication of one, which sh0ould embrace such;
matter and on a plan, as from experience, we judged to
be best calculate d for the instruction of youth. We have
at length completed our object, and with de erence present it to the Publick, but without any pretensions to
originality. Many, and of superior mlerit, have gone before us on this subject, and not to have profited by the;r
labours would havb been treating them with neglect.
In spelling, pronunciation, and in the division of- syli.
lables, we have been guided principally by WTalker's Cri-tical and Pronouncing Dictionary which is generally;
acknowledged to be the best in the English languag~e.
The plan of the geographical tables) we thi,ikf wil;t
found beneficial, as tending to expan d the miInd of youth,
and excite a taste for reading on subjects of geographyo
Of grammar, we have said but little since: we-culd
not give a complete system, i- thiout destroying the uti
ty of the book for at least nine-tenths. of its-readers.
The nAmerican chronology will be found useful asd  a
-record of national history, citing events too. important
for our children to lose the sight of.
The materials and- execution of the work have beencarefully attended to. Upon the whole, we have assidu,
ously aimed at the production of a useful-school boo;
how far we may have succeeded, must bel eft to the de-,
cision of an enlightened people, at whose tribunal, we,
with due deference, submit ourselves and the fite pf our

Of the.81phabetical Pronunciation of the Letter.T.
Mr. Walker observes, " We are to inquire what is the true
name of the firt letter -of the English alphabet-whether we are
to say y./e, B, C;.h, B, C; or.xw, B, C.  -
And first, it will be necessary to consider the nature of a vowel  
I: which grammarians are generally agreed in defiining to he a sim",.:;ple articulate souild, formed by the impulse ofthe voice by the:.opening only of the mouth in a particular manner." Now as
every vowel by itself is sounded long, as nothing but its junction
w ith a consonant can make it otherwise, it is natural, when pro.
nouncing this vowel alone, to give it the long open sound; but as
this long open sound is threefold, as heardinface,father, and -wa.
ter, a question arises which of these long soundts shall we adopt
as a comdmon name to the whole species of this letter? The En.
gi ish make choice of the a in face, the Irish of that infather, arind
the S-cotch of that in -water. Each party produces words where
the letter a is sounded in the manner-they contend for; but wlien
wIe demand why one should have the preference,-the controversy
is commonly at an end; any farther reasons are either too remote
or too insignificant to be produced; and indeed,'if a diversity of
names to vowiels did-not confound us in our spelling, or declaring
-:0t. each 0oher the componant letters of a word, it would be entirely needless to. enter into so trifling a question as the mere name
-f-a-lettein.- but-when we find ourselves unable to convey signs to
each other on account of this diversity of names, and that words-.:themselves are endangered by an improper utterance of tthe coinponent parts, it seems highly incumbent on us, to attempt a uni.
fiormity in this point, which, insignificant as it may seem, is un.
doubtedly the foundation of a just and regular pronunciation.
The first rule for naming a  letteiJ, when plronounced alone, seems
to be-this; Whatever sound we give to a letter when terminating
a syllable, the same soun d ought to be- given to it when pronounced alone;. because, in both ca-ses, they have their primary, simple
sound, uninfluenced by a succeeding -vowel or consonant; and
therefbre, when we pron'ounce a letter alone it ought to have such
a sound as does.not suppose the existence,of any other letter. But
wherever a terminates a syllable with the accent upon it, (the only
state in which it can be said to be pure,) it has always the English
sou)nd of'tlat letter. The only exceptions to this rule are, the
wbrdsfa-ther, mas-ter, and -za-ter; and thlat these are merely ex.
ceptions, appears from the uniformity with which -the a is proinounced otherwise in parent, papal,.taper, fatul, &amp;c. The other
vowels have their names exactly similar to: the sound they have in
a similar situation,' as thie e like that in me gri-m, the i like the i in
ti. te, tte  as thie o in no-b/e, and the i like the u in t-lor. Thus,
as: itappears fiom the general analogy qf pronunciation, that the
sound of thle a which the English adopt, is the only one that.does
Xiot necessarily suppose the' existence of any other solund, it inevit-:ably follows that thIeir's only is the proper aprpe'lation ofthatletter"TH-E U lNITED STA'rS' SPSA LLtENG.' OOl
