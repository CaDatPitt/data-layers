THIE SE,V:EAN STICIKS.
A MAN had seiven sons, who were al]vays
(llarreling. They left their studies and work,
to quarrel among themselves.
Some bad -men were looliing forward to the
death of their father, to cheat them  out of
their property, by making them quarrel
about- it.
The good old man, one day, called his
sons around him.
He laid before them seven sticks, which
were bound together. He said, "I will pay
a hundred dollars to the one who can break
this bundle".
Each one strained   every nerve to breakSELECTIONS.
the bundle.   After a long, but vain trial, they
all said that it could not be done.
"And   yet", said    the  father, "nothing    is
easier ".  He   then   untied   the  bundle, and
broke the sticks, one by one, with perfect
ease.
"Ah!" said the sons; "it is easy enough
to  do it so; any body could       do it in that
way ".
Their father replied, "As it is with these
sticks, so it is with you, my sons. So long
as you hold fast together, you will prosper,
and none can injure you.
"But if the bond      of unlion be broken, it
will happen to you as to these sticks, which
lie here broken on the ground."
Home, city, country, all are prosperous found,
When by the powerful link of union bound.
REVIEw.-What were these seven sons always doing?
What were some bad men intending to do at the death of
their father? What did their father lay before them, and
offer them? Could they break the bundle? How did he.break the sticks? What did they say? What did their
father reply? Repeat the lines at the close of the lesson.

SPEAK gently; it is better far
To rule by love than fear:
Speak gently; let no harsh words mar
The good we might do here.
Speak gently to the little child;
Its love be sure to gain;
Teach it in accents soft and mild;
It may not long remain.
Speak gently to the aged one;
Grieve not the care-worn heart;
The sands of life are nearly run;
Let such in peace depart.
Speak gently, kindly, to the poor;
Let no iharsh word be heard;
They have enough thev must endure,

Speak gently to the erring; know
They may have toiled in vain;
Perhaps unkindness made them so;

Exercise XII.
TIIHE CONTENTED M1iANiT.
A POOR laborer, named Robert, was golng
home, after a hard day's work, with a basket
in his hand.
"Whlat a fine supper I shall have!" said
he to hIimself.  "This piece of meat well
stewed, and my onions sliced, and the broth
thickened with my meal, and seasoned with
the salt and pepper, will make a dish good
enough for a king.  Then, I have a piece of
barley bread at home, to finish off with.
How I long to be at it!"
At this imoment, he heard a noise at the
road-side. Looking up, he saw a squirrel run
up a tree, and creep into a hole among the
branches.
"Ha!" thought he; "what a nice present
a nest of young squirrels would be for my
sick neighbor. I'11 try if I can get it." So
he put down his basket, and began to climb
the tree.
He had got partly up, when, looking at his
basket, he saw a dog with his nose in it, trying to get at his piece of meat.
Robert slipped dowvn as quickly as he could;
but the dog was toc quick for him, and ran
off with the meat in his nmouth. "Well," said
ne, "I must be contented with plain soup,
which is not bad after all".
101INSTITUTE READER.
He walked on, and came to a little publiclhouse, by the road-side, where a friend of his
was sittingo on a bench. Robert put down his
basket, and took a seat by his friend.
A tame raven, which was kept at the house,
caine slyly behind him, and hopping on the
basket, stole away the little bag in which his
meal was tied up, and went off with it to his
hole.
Robert did not miss the meal until he had
gone some distance. He went back to search
for the bag, but could hear nothing of it.
"Well," said he, "my soup will be thinner
for wvant of the meal. But I will boil a slice
of bread with it, and that will do some good,
at least."
He went on again, and came to a little
brook, over which a narrow plank was laid.
A young woman coming up to pass over at
the same time, Robert gallantly offered her
his hand.
As soon as she reached the middle of the
plank, she cried out that she was falling.
Robert, in trying to support her with his other
arm, let his basket drop into the stream.
As soon as she was safely over, he jumped
into the brook, and got his basket. But when
he came ashore, he found that the salt was all
melted, and the pepper washed away.  Nothing was now left but the onions.
"Well," said Robert, "then I must sup tonight on roasted onions and barley bread.
102*SELECTIONS.
Last night, I had nothing but bread. It will
make no difference with me to-morrow, what I
have had to-day."  So saying, he trudged on,
singing as before.
REvIEw.-Will you relate this story? How did Robert
console himself at last? What are marks of punctuationl
used for?
Exercise XIII.
NEILL'S NOTION.
Three-year-old Nell by the window-pane stood,
A good little girl, and as pretty as good,
Watching the snow come downFalling so lightly,
So swiftly and brightly,
It whitened all the town.
"See, mamma!" she cried in a joyous strain,
"O, mamma, look out! and see the popped rain!
The air is as full as it can be;
And it never stops,
But it jumps and hops,
Like the corn that you pop for me."
Winter passed on; and the Spring was here--
Spring, with its flowers, its brightness and cheer,
And the birds were wild with song,
Ah, sweet was the note,
From each tiny throat!
Nell listened the whole day long.
103INSTITUTE READER.
"Tell me, dear mamma, what do they eat,
These dear little birds, that they sing so
sweet? "
Nell asked in her wonder and glee.
"O, mamma, I think
They have sky to drink,
And flowers for their breakfast and tea."
Exercise XIV.
I IDUSr/TRY A TR,nAS-URE.
A WEALTHY old farmer, seeing that he
must soon die, called together his sons to his
bedside.
"My dear children," said he, " I leave it
you, as my last request, not to part with the
farm, which has been so long in our family.
"To make known to you a secret, which I
had from my father, there is a treasure hid
somewhere in the ground, though I could never
find the exact spot.
"However, as soon as the harvest is got in,
spare no pains in the search. I am sure thb.t
you will not- lose your labor."
The wise old man was no sooner laid in
his grave, and the harvest gathered in, than
his sons began to look for the treasure.
With great care, they turned up, again and
again, nearly every foot of ground on the
farm; but, though they did not find what they
104SELECTIONS.
were looking for, their farm   yielded a much
larger crop than ever.
At the end of the year, when the sons were
counting their great profits, one of them, wiser
than the others, said, "I do believe that this
was the treasure my father meant.
" I am sure, at least, that we have found
out this, that industry is itself a treasure."
REvIEw.-What did the old man say to his sons?
What did they do? What was the consequence? To
what conclusion did they come?

DO T11?Y LITTLE--DO IT WT.T-T.
Do thy little-do it well;
Do what right and reason tell;
Do what wrong and sorrow claimConquer sin and cover shaime.
Do thy little, though it be
Dreariness and drudgery;
They whom Christ apostles made,
"Gathered fragments" when He bade.
Do thy little: never mind
Though thy brethren be unkind;
Though the men who ought to smile
Mock and taunt thee for a while.
Do thy little: never fear
While the Savior standeth near;
Let the world its javelins throw;
On thy way undaunted go.
Do thy little: God hath made
Million leaves for forest shade;
Smallest stars their glory bringGod employeth eNvery thing.
Do thy little; and whllen thou
Feelest on thy pallid brow,
Ere has fled the vital breath,
Cold and damp, the sweat of death--

Then the little thou hast done,
Little battles thou hast won,
Little masteries achieved,
Little wants with care relieved,
Little words in love expressed,
Little wrongs at once confessed,
Little favors kindly done,
Little toils thou didst not shun,
Little graces meekly worn,
Little slights with patience borne--
These shall crown thy pillowed head,
Holy light upon thee shed;
These are treasures that shall rise,
Far beyond the smiling skies.ADVANCED CLASSES.1NTRODUCTION.
FOR ADVANCED CLASSES, AND FOR SELFTRAINING IN READING.
Elocution, or the art of reading and speaking, may
be divided into Vocal Culture and Expression.
An exhaustive analysis of the subject is not attempted
in the following pages. Nor does the student need this;
he only needs a few practical directions to aid him in
getting the mastery over his voice, and in acquiring a distinct conception of the various styles of composition. By
the aid of appropriate examples under each division, and
abundant miscellaneous reading exercises, at the close of
the book, it is hoped the directions will be found sufficient for this purpose.
To the class, no book can supply the place of the living
teacher. To the student, nothing can make up for a want
of judgment and taste: without these, he can not hope to
become an elegant reader; with them, by attention to vocal
culture, he will experience but little difficulty.  Strength
and smoothness of tone are too frequently regarded as the
gift of nature. True, nature may favor many in this respect; but any one whose organs of speech are not defective may, by proper exercise and attention, acquire a deep,
full, clear, resonant voice.
Breathing.-Much of the success in reading depends
upon breathing. No one can read well who can not breathe
well. The first exercise, therefore, in a course of vocal
training, should be one in breathing.
(111)INST'ITUTE READER
Stand or sit erect (standing is preferable), place the
hands upon the waist, the fingers forward, and the shoulders thrown well back. Breathe naturally but deeply; increase in rapidity until you can instantly inflate and as
suddenly exhaust the lungs. In breathing, let there be a
free action of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, and
let the chest rise and fall freely, but do not allow even the
slightest noise to be made. A good practice is to inhale
deeply and give out the breath slowly in one of the prolonged vowel sounds.
Emphasis and Inflection.-Emphasis is calling atten.
tion to a particular word of a sentence, by some modulation
of the utterance; inflection, the agreeable and forcible enunciation of each word. These need but little, if any, special
notice. A correct idea of the writer's meaning will suggest
the proper emphasis and inflection; a well-trained voice will
enable the reader to give them accurately.
Suggestion.-To make the use of this part serviceable,
the student should first go through with a thorough course in
articulation and breathing; then take up Vocal Culture,
beginning with Quality, and drill on each division and
subdivision, reviewing, from time to time, as he advances,
until complete control over the voice is secured.  He
should next proceed to expression, and obtain an idea of
the various kinds of style.

118INSTITUTE READER.
I. --Pure Tone.
Pure Tone is free from any harsh, guttural, aspirated,
nasal, or oral tone, and is made with a less expenditure of
breath, and with less fatigue, than any other.
The essentials to purity of tone are, deep breathing, control of the muscles of the throat regulating the vocal organs,
and a free opening of the mouth.
The best exercise for cultivating purity of tone is one on
the vocal sounds (Part II, page 74). Take one of these
sounds, utter it with a moderate degree of loudness, watch
closely each successive effort, and endeavor to make it free
from any impurity.
A great cause of impurity of tone is the expulsion of too
much breath. To test its purity, in this respect, hold the
back of the hand within an inch or two of the mouth while
uttering the sound, and if a current of air from the mouth
is perceptible by the hand, the tone is not pure.
II.--Orotund Quality.
Orotund is a mode of intonation directly from the larynx,
which gives fullness, clearness, and strength.  It is the
highest perfection of voice, and is used in solemn, pathetic,
energetic, and vehement forms of expression. The Orotund
usually admits of three degrees, designated, according to the
intensity of the emotion: Effusive, or the language of solemnity and pathos; Expulsive, or the language of earnest
declamation; Explosive, or the language of intense passion.

contend with each other, held, without doubt, a high rank
in the human race.
Too long have political cabinets taken formal note of the
death of those who were great only in their funeral panegyrics.
Too long has the etiquette of courts prescribed hypocritical
mourning. Nations should wear mourning only for their
benefactors. The representatives of nations should recommend to their homage none but the heroes of humanity.
M)iraabeau.
2.-TELL ON HIS NATIVE HILLS.
Oh, with what pride I used
To walk these hills, and look up to my God,
And bless him that the land was free.'T was free--
From end to end, from cliff to lake,'t was free!
Free as our torrents are that leap our rocks
And plow our valleys, without asking leave!
Or as our peaks that wear their caps of snow
In very presence of the regal sun!
How happy was it then! I loved
Its very storms. Yes, I have sat
In my boat at night, when, midway o'er the lake,
The stars went out, and down the mountain gorge
The wind came roaring. I have sat and eyed
The thunder breaking from his cloud, and smiled
To see him shake his lightning o'er my head,
And think I had no master save his own!
On yonder jutting cliff-o'ertaken there
By the mountain blast--I've laid me flat along,
And while gust followed gust more furiously,
As if to sweep me o'er the horrid brink,
And 1 have thought of other lands, whose storms
Are summer-flaws to those of mine, and just
Have wished me there-the thought that mine was free
Has checked that wish, and I have raised my head
And cried, in thralldom to that furious wind,
Blow on!--this is the land of liberty!--Knowles.

3.-AGAINST THE WAR.
I can not, my lords, I will not, join in congratulation on
misfortune and disgrace. This, my lords, is a perilous and
tremendous moment. It is not a time for adulation; the
smoothness of flattery can not save us in this rugged and
awful crisis. It is now necessary to instruct the throne in
the language of truth. We must, if possible, dispel the delusion and darkness which envelop it, and display, in its full
danger and genuine colors, the ruin which is brought to our
doors; Can ministers still presume to expect support in their
infatuation? Can parliament be so dead to its dignity and
duty as to give their support to measures thus obtruded and
forced upon them?-measures, my lords, which have reduced this late flourishing empire to scorn and contempt!
"But yesterday, and Britain might have stood against
the world; now none so poor to do her reverence." The
people whom we at first despised as rebels, but whom we now
acknowledge as enemies, are abetted against us, supplied with
every military store--have their interest consulted and their
embassadors entertained by our inveterate enemy; and ministers do not and dare not interpose with dignity or effect.
The desperate state of our army abroad is in part known.
No man more highly esteems and honors the British troops
than I do; I know their virtues and their valor; I know they
can achieve any thing but impossibilities; and I know that
the conquest of British America is an impossibility. You can
not, my lords, you can not conquer America What is your
present situation there? We do not know the worst; but we
know that in three campaigns we have done nothing and
suffered much.- Chatham.

4.-ODE TO THE GREEKS.
Strike for the sires who left you free!
Strike for their sakes who bore you!
Strike for your homes and liberty,
And the heaven you worship o'er you!

5.-THE SEMINOLE'S DEFIANCE.
I've scared you in the city; I've scalped you on the plain;
Go, count your chosen where they fell beneath my leaden
rain!
I scorn your proffered treaty; the pale-face I defy;
Revenge is stamped upon my spear, and blood my battle-cry!
G. I[. Pa/ten.
6.--LAILA'S ANGER.
Begone, thou insolent!
Why dost thou stand and gaze upon me thus?
Aye! watch the features well that threaten thee
WVith fraud and danger! In the wilderness
They shall avenge me-in the hour of want
Rise on thy view, and make thee feel
How innocent I am:
And this remembered cowardice and insult
With a more painful shame will burn thy cheek
Than now heats mine with anger:--Southey.
7.-Thy threats, thy mercies I defy!
And give thee in thy teet/ the lie.-Scott.
8.--Up, comrades, up/--in Rokeby's halls,
Ne'er be it said our courage falls.-Scott.
III. -Aspirated Quality.
Aspirated Quality is not purity of tone, but consists in an
excessive expulsion of breath in uttering sounds, making the
sol:nds partly vocal and partly aspirate. It is used in intense fear.
EXAMPLES.
1.-While thronged the citizens, with terror dumb,
Or whispering with white lips--" The foe! they
come! they come!"- Byron.
118VOCAL CULTURE.
2.-Ah! mercy on my soul!.What's that?     My old
friend's ghost! See how long and pale his face has grown
since his death! Pray, do not come near me! Ah! ah!
mercy on us!--no nearer, pray.
3.- How ill this taper burns!
Ha! who comes here?
Cold drops of sweat hang on my trembling flesh,
Mly blood grows chilly, and I freeze with horror!
4. - Have mercy, heaven! Ha! soft,'T is but a dream.
But then so terrible, it shakes my soul.
IV.-- Guttural Quality.
Guttural Quality also is opposed to purity of tone, and
consists of a mode of utterance which seems to come through
an obstructed throat.. It is the language of hatred, contempt, and loathing.
EXAMPLES.
1.-QUEEN CONSTANCE.
Thou slave! thou wretch! thou coward!'rThou little valiant, great in villainy!
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou fortune's chalnpion, thou dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety! Thou art perjured, too,
And sooth'st up greatness! What a fool art thou,
A ramping fool, to brag, and stamp, and sweat,
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side!
Been sworn my soldier! bidding me depend
Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength?
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
Thou wear a lion's hide? Doff it for shame,
And hang a calf-skin on those recreant limbs.
Shzakespeare.
119INSTITUTE READER.
2.-O, that the slave had forty thousand lives,
One is too poor, too weak, for my revenge.
3.-0O, for a tongue to curse the slave,
Whose treason, like a poison blight,
Comes o'er the counsels of the brave,
And blasts them in their hour of might!
4.-I loathe you with my bosom! I scorn you with
mine eye!
I'll taunt you with my latest breath, and fight you
till I die!
I ne'er will ask for quarter, and I ne'er will.be your
slave:
But I'll swim the sea of slaughter till I sink beneath
the wave!
V.N--asal Quality.
In tllis Quality, the voice sounds as if it came through
the nose. It is caused by an imperfect opening of the
mouth and nasal passages. It is never employed in correct
delivery, and may be avoided if the mouth and throat are
kept well open, by relaxing the muscles of the throat and
lower jaw.
VI.-Oral Quality.
This is made almost exclusively in the mouth. It is exemplified in the disgusting affectation sometimes found in
society. A degree is employed in expressing playftlness
of humor.
EXAMPLE.
Oh! then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
Slhe comes,
In shape no bigger than an agate stone
On the forefinger of an aldermlan,
Drawn by a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses, as they lie asleep;
Her wagon-spokes made of long spinner's legs;
120VOCAL CULTURE.
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
The traces of the smallest spider's web;
The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams:
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film;
Her wagoner, a small gray-coated gnat:
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut,
Made by the joiner squirrel, or old grub,
Time out of mind the fairy's coachmakers.
Shakespeare.
SECTION      II.  FORCE.
Force, in vocal culture, has reference both to the loudness of sound and the intensity of utterance. The degrees
of it are-Subdued, Moderate, Energetic, and Impassioned.
L-Subdued Force.
Subdued force is employed in the expression of pathos
and solemnity, and is usually accompanied by Effusive Orotund Quality.
EXAMPLES.
1.-THE BURIAL OF ARNOLD.
Effusive Orotund Quality
Ye've gathered to your place of prayer,
With slow and measured tread;
Your ranks are full, your mates all there,
But the soul of one has fled.
Tread lightly, comrades, ye have laid
His dark locks on his brow,
Like life, save deeper light and shade,
We'll not disturb them now.
Tread lightly! for't is beautiful,
That blue-veined eyelid's sleep,
Hiding the eye death left so dull;
Its slumber we will keep!- Wizlls.
I. R. 11.
121INSTITUTE READER.
2.-THE MAJESTY OF GOD.
Effusive Orotund Quality.
Bless the Lord, O my soul! O Lord, my Lord, Thou
art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty;
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who
stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; who layeth the
beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the
clouds his chariot; who walketh upon the wings of the
wind; who laid the foundations of the earth that it should
nct be removed forever.-Psalms.
3.-REVERENCE.
Effusive Orotund Quality.
It thunders! Sons of dust, in reverence bow!
Ancient of Days! Thou speakest from above:
Almighty! trembling like a timid child,
I hear thy awful voice. Alarmed-afraidI see the flashes of thy lightning wild,
And in the very grave would hide my head.
II.- Moderate Force.
Moderate force is used in unimpassioned narrative, descriptive, and didactic composition.
EXAMPLES.
1.-REFLECTIONS IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY.
Pure Tone.
When I look upon the tombs of the great, every emotion
of envy dies in me; when I read the epitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes out; when I meet with
the grief of parents upon a tombstone, my heart melts with
compassion; when I see the tomb of the parents themselves, I consider the vanity of grieving for those whom we
must quickly follow. When I see kings lying by those who
deposed them, when I consider rival wits placed side by side,
or the holh men that divided the world with their contests
122VOCAL CULTURE.
and disputes, I reflect, with sorrow and astonishment, on the
little competitions, factions, and debates of mankind. When
I read the several dates of the tombs of some that died yesterday, and some six hundred years ago, I consider that
great day when we shall all of us be cotemporaries, and
make our appearance together.-Addison.
2.-KNOWLEDGE AND WISDOM.
Pure Tone.
Knowledge and Wisdom, far from being one,
Have ofttimes no connection. Knowledge dwells
In heads replete with thoughts of other men;
Wisdom, in minds attentive to their own.
Knowledge, a rude, unprofitable mass,
The mere materials with which wisdom builds,
Till smoothed, and squared, and fitted to its placeDoes but encumber whom it seems to enrich.
Knowledge is proud that he has learned so much:
Wisdom is humble that he knows no more.--Cowter.
3.-FULTON'S FIRST STEAMBOAT.
Pure Tone.
As I had occasion to pass daily to and from the buildingyard, while my boat was in progress, I have often loitered
unknown near the idle groups of strangers gathering in little
circles, and iheard various inquiries as to the object of this
new vehicle) The language was uniformly that of scorn, or
sneer, or ridicule. The loud laugh often rose at my expense;
the dry jest; the wise calculation of losses and expenditures;
the dull, but endless, repetion of "the Fulton folly". Never
did a single encouraging remark, a bright hope, or a warm
wish cross my path. Silence itself was but politeness veiling
its doubts, or hiding its reproaches.
III.-- Energetic Force.
Energetic Force is employed in the liveliest styles of narrative, descriptive, and didactic composition, and in earnest
declamation.
123INSTITUTE READER.
EXAMPLES.
1.-SWISS LIBERTY.
Expulsive Orotund Quality
You may, if it be God's will, gain our barren and rugged
mountains. But, like our ancestors of old, we will seek
refuge in wilder and more distant solitudes; and when we
have resisted to the last, we will starve in the icy wastes of
the glaciers. Aye, men, women, and children, we will be
frozen into annihilation together, ere one free Switzer will
acknowledge a foreign master.
2.-WAR SONG OF THE GREEKS.
Expulsive Orotund Quality.
We've sworn, by our country's assaulters,
By the virgins they've dragged from our altars,
By our massacred patriots, our children in chains,
By our heroes of old, and their blood in our veins,
That, living, we will be victorious,
Or that, dying, our deaths shall be glorious.
Camvpbell.
Expulsive Orotund Quality.
3.--When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
Dash him in pieces!--Shakespeare.
Expulsive Orotund Quality.
4.--Who dares to fly from yonder sword, he cries,
Who dares to tremble, by this weapon, dies.
IV.-Impassioned Force.
Impassioned Force admits of two divisions-free impassioned and suppressed impassioned. It is employed in the
expression of the intenser passions and emotions.
124VOCAL CULTURE.
EXAMPLES.
1.-SATAN TO DEATH.
Explosive Orotund Quality.
Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,
That darest, though grim and terrible, advance
Thy miscreated front athwart my way
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass,
That be assured, without leave asked of thee:
Retire, or taste thy folly; and learn by proof,
Hell-born! not to contend with spirits of heaven!
Milton.
Explosive Orotund Quality.
2.--Unmanner'd dog! Stand thou when I command!
Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,
Or, by Saint Paul! I'11 strike thee to the earth,
And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
Explosive Orotund Quality.
3.-Were I an American, as I am an Englishman, while
a foreign troop was landed in my country, I never would lay
down my arms. Never,- never, never.--C/zatham.
4.-DEFIANCE.
Explosive Orotund Quality.
Smile on, my lords!
I scorn to count what feelings, withered hopes,
Strong provocations, bitter, burning wrongs,
I have within my heart's hot cells shut up,
To leave you in your lazy dignities.-Croly.
SECTION     III. -STRESS.
l he nmanner in which Force is applied, in reading and
speaking, is termed Stress. There are usually reckoned five
divisions: Radical, Median, Vanishing, Compound, and Intermittent.

VANISHING,......  
COMPOUND.  
INTERMITTENT,.......
I.-Radical Stress.
In radical Stress; the force of the utterance falls on the
first part of the sound, and vanishes more or less rapidly.
The long vowels afford fine exercises in this.
EXAMPLES.
1.-THE VALUE OF LITERATURE.
Moderate Force--Expulsive Orotund Quality.
Had I not, by deeply pondering the precepts of philosophy, and the lessons of the historian and the poet, imbued
my mind with an early and intimate conviction that nothing
in life is worthy of strenuous pursuit but honor and renown,
and that, for the attainment of these, the extremes of bodily
torture, and all the terrors of exile and of death, ought to be
regarded as trifles, never should I have engaged in such a
series of deadly conflicts for your safety, nor have exposed
myself to these daily machinations of the most profligate of
mankind.
But the literature, the wisdom, the consentaneous voice of
antiquity, all teem with glorious examples-examples which
would have been forever buried in oblivion, but for the
redeeming light of letters. How many instances of neroic
daring and devotedness are pictured on the Greek and
126
INSTITUTE B~ EADER.VOCAL CULTURE.
Roinan page, not for our study only, but for our imitation!
With these illustrious models incessantly before my eyes, I
have labored to form my mind and character by intense
meditation on their excellence.--Cz'cero.
2.-THE SCHOOLMASTER IS ABROAD.
Moderate Force--Expulsive Orotund Quality.
There have been periods when the country heard with dismay that "the soldier was abroad". That is not the case
now. Let the soldier be abroad; in the present age he can
do nothing. There is another person abroad--a less important person in the eyes of some, an insignificant personwhose labors have tended to produce this state of things.
The schoolmaster is abroad! And I trust more to him, armed
with his primer, than I do to the soldier in full military array,
for upholding and extending the liberties of the country.
The adversaries of improvement are wont to make themselves
merry with what is termed the "march of intellect"; and
here, as far as the phrase goes, they are in the right. The
conqueror moves in a march. He stalks onward, with the
"pride, pomp, and circumstance" of war-banners flying,
shouts rending the air, guns thundering, and martial music
pealing, to drown the shrieks of the wounded and the lamen
tations for the slain.
Not thus the schoolmaster, in his peaceful vocation. He
quietly advances in his humble path, laboring steadily till he
has opened to the light all the recesses of ignorance, and torn
up by the roots the weeds of vice. His is a progress not to
be compared with any thing like a march; but it leads to a
far more brilliant triumph, and to laurels more imperishable,
than the destroyer of his species, the scourge of the world,
ever won. Such men-men deserving the glorious title of
Teachers of Mankind-I have found, laboring conscientiously, though, perhaps, obscurely, in their blessed vocation,
wherever I have gone. Their calling is high and holy; their
renown will fill the earth in after ages, in proportion as it
sounds not far off in their own times.--Brougham.
127INSTITUTE READER.
I,--Median Stress.
In Median Stress, the force is applied so as to swell out
the middle of the sound. The long vowels afford exercis-s
in this as well as in Radical stress.
EXAMPLES.
1.-THE PAST.
Subdued Force--Effusive Orotund Quality.
Thou unrelenting Past!
Strong are the barriers round thy dark domain;
And fetters, sure and fast,
Hold all that enter thy unbreathing reign.
Far in thy realm withdrawn
Old empires sit in sullenness and gloom;
And glorious ages gone
Lie deep within the shadow of tlhy womb.
Childhood, with all its mirth,
Youth, Manhood, Age, that draws us to the ground,
And last, Man's Life on earth,
Glide to thy dim dominions, and are bound.
Bryant.
2.-DAVID'S LAMENT.
Subdued Force--Effusive Orotund Quality.
How are the mighty fallen!  Saul and Jonathan were
lovely and pleasant in their lives; and in their death they
were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were
stronger than lions.-Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,
who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights; who put on
ornaments of gold upon your apparel! How are the mighty
fallen in the midst of the battle! 0 Jonathan! thou wast
slain in thy high places!- How are the mighty fallen, and
-the weapons of war perished!--Bible.
1'28VOCAL CULTURE.
Subdued Force--Effusive Orotund Quality.
3.- The curfew tolls the knell of parting day;
The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea;
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
Gray.
III.-Vanishing Stress.
Vanishing Stress is that in which the force of utterance is
withheld until the vanish or close of the sound is reached,
ending suddenly, with percussive force.
EXAMPLES.
1.-MARMION TO DOUGLAS.
Impassioned Force--Explosive Orotund Quality.
Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire,
And shook his very frame for ire,
And-" This to me!" he said;
"And't were not for thy hoary beard,
Such hand as Marmion's had not spared
To cleave the Douglas' head!
And first I tell thee, haughty peer,
He who does England's message here,
Although the meanest in her state,
May well, proud Angus, be thy mate!
And, Douglas, more I tell thee here,
E'en in thy pitch of pride,
Here in thy hold, thy vassals near,
(Nay, never look upon your lord,
And lay your hand upon your sword),
I tell thee, thou'rt defied."-Scott.
Impassioned Force--Explosive Orotund Quality.
2.--Fret till your proud heart breaks;
Go, show your slaves how choloric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. - Si/akespeare.INSTITUTE READER.
3. CATALINE'S DEFIANCE.
Impassioned Force - Explosive Orotund Quality.
6'Tried and convicted traitor!"  Who says this?
Who'11 prove it, at his peril, on my head?
Look to your hearths, my lords!
For there, henceforth, shall sit, for household gods,
Shapes hot from Tartarus!-all shames and crimes!
Wan treachery, with his thirsty dagger drawn;
Suspicion, poisoning his brother's cup;
Naked rebellion, with the torch and ax,
Making his wild sport of your blazing thrones;
Till anarchy comes down on you like night,
And massacre seals Rome's eternal grave!--CroZy.
IV.-Compound Stress.
Compound Stress is that in which the voice touches
forcibly on the initial and final parts of the sound, but
passes lightly over the middle portion of it.
EXAMPLES.
Impassioned Force-Aspirated Guttural Quality.
1.-    Gone to be married! Gone to swear a peace!
False blood to false blood jQined! Gone to be friends!
Shall Lewis have Blanche, and Blanche these provinces?
It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard--
Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:
It can not be;-thou dost but say't is so.--Shakespeare.
2.--QUARREL BETWEEN BRUTUS AND CASSIUS.
Impassioned Force--Aspirated Guttural Quality.
Brmz. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemned to have an itching palm
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.
130VFOAL CULTURE.
Cas.             I an itching palm?
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
Bru. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
Cas. Chastisement?
V.--Intermittent Stress.
Intermittent Stress consists of a tremulous iteration of
sound, or a number of short impulses resembling a wave.
EXAMPLES.
1.-CHARITY.
Subdued Force-Pure Tone.
Pit), the sorrows of a poor old man,
Whose trembling limbs have borne him to your door;
Whose days are dwindled to the shortest span;
Oh! give relief; and Heaven will bless your store.
2.-WAITING.
Subdued Force--Pure Tone.
Only waiting till the shadows
Are a little longer grown;
Only waiting till the glimmer
Of the day's last beam is flown.
Then from out the gathered darkness,:Holy, deathless stars shall rise,
By whose light my soul shall gladly
Tread its pathway to the skies.
Subdued Force -Pure Tone.
3.-Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his fame, fresh and gory;
We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,
But left him alone with his glory.
131INSTITUTE READER.
Subdued Force-Pure Tone.
4.--My mother, when I learned that thou wast dead,
Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?
Hovered thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son,
Wretch even then, life's journey just begun?
SECTION IV.- PITCH.
Pitch is the point on the musical scale where the element
or word is sounded. It must not be mistaken for compass,
nor confounded with loudness or Quantity. While Quantity is frequently associated with Pitch, it is by no means
essential to it.
The ability to manage the voice, with reference to Pitch,
depends upon the control of the larynx and lower jaw. If
the muscles be relaxed and the throat enlarged, the Pitch
will be low; and each degree of contraction will be marked
by a higher degree of Pitch.
The best means of cultivating this, is to speak to persons
at different distances-far or near, according as a high or
low degree is desired. Exercise in sudden transitions in
Pitch will also be found invaluable to a complete mastery
of the subject.
The distinctions of Pitch are-Low, Very Low, Middle,
High, Very High.
I.- Low Pitch,
EXAMPLES.
1.-NIGHT.
Median Stress - Subdued Force - Pure Tone.
How beautiful is night!
A dewy freshness fills the silent air;
No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain
Breaks the serene of Heaven;
132VOCAL CULTURE.
In full-orbed glory, yonder moon divine
Rolls through the dark-blue depths.
Beneath lber steady ray
The desert-circle spreads
Like the round ocean girded with the sky.
How beautiful is night!-Southey.
2.-AGE.
Median Stress - Moderate Force - Pure Tone.
Now comes the autumn of life--the season of "the sere
and yellow leaf ". The suppleness and mobility of the limbs
diminish; the senses are less acute; and the impressions of
external objects are less remarked. The fibers of the body
grow more rigid; the emotions of the mind are more calm
and uniform; the eye loses its lustrous keenness of expression. The mind no longer roams abroad with its original
excursiveness: the power of imagination is, in great degree,
lost. Experience has robbed external objects of their illusiveness: the thoughts come home: it is the age of reflection. It is the period in which we receive the just tribute
of veneration and confidence from our fellow-men, if we
have so lived as to deserve it, and are entitled to the respect
and confidence of the younger part of mankind in exact
proportion to the manner in which our own youth has been
spent and our maturity improved.- Godmnan.
3.-THE GROVES.
Median Stress-Subdued-Pure Tone.
Father, Thy hand
Hath reared these venerable columns. Thou
Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down
Upon the naked earth, and forthwith rose
All these fair ranks of trees. They in Thy sun
Budded, and shook their green leaves in Thy breeze,
And shot toward heaven. The century-living crow,
Whose birth was in their tops, grew old and died
Among their branches; till, at last, they stood,
133INSTITUTE READER.
As now they stand, massy, and tall, and darkFit shrine for humble worshiper to hold
Communion with his Maker!-Bryant.
II.-Very Low Pitch.
EXAMPLES.

2.-A TASTE FOR READING.
Radical Stress-- Moderate Force-Pure Tone.
Were I to pray for a taste which should stand me in stead
under every variety of circumstance, and be a source of
happiness and cheerfulness to me during life, and a shield
against its ills, however things might go amiss and the
world frown upon me, it would be a taste for reading.
Give a man this taste and the means of gratifying it, and
you can hardly fail of making him a happy man; unless,
indeed, you put into his hands a most perverse selection of
books. You place him in contact with the best society in
every period of history-with the wisest, the wittiest, the
tenderest, the bravest, and the purest characters who have
adorned humanity. You make him a denizen of all nations,
a cotemporary of all ages. The world has been created fox
him.-Sir John Herschel.
3.-HOWARD.
Radical Stress--lModerate Force--Pure Tone.
Howard visited all Europe; not to survey the sumptuousness of palaces, or the stateliness of temples; not to make
accurate measurements of the remains of ancient grandeur:
but to dive into the depths of dungeons; to plunge into the
infection of hospitals; to survey the mansions of sorrow and
pain; to remember the forgotten, and to visit the forsaken.
His plan was original, and it was as full of genius as it was
of humanity. It was a voyage of discovery, a circumnavigation df charity. The benefit of his labor is felt more or
less in every country; and, at his final reward, he will receive, not by retail, but in gross, the reward of those who
visit the prisoner.-Burke.

Spake full well, in language quaint and olden,
One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine,
When he called the flowers, so blue and golden,
Stars, that in earth's firmament do shine.
Stars they are, wherein we read our history,
As astrologers and seers of eld;
Yet not wrapped about with awful mystery,
Like the burning stars which they beheld.
Wondrous truths, and mallifold as wondrous,
God hath written in those stars above;
But not less in the bright flow'rets under us,
Stands the revelation of His love.
And with childlike, credulous affection,
We behold their tender buds expand;
Emblems of our own great resurrection,
Emblems of the bright and better land.

O! if the Muse must flatter lawless sway,
And follow still where Fortune leads the way,
Or if no basis bear my rising name
But the fallen ruins of another's fame,
Then teach me, Heaven! to scorn the guilty bays,
Drive from my breast that wretched lust of praise;
Unblemished let me live, or die unknown;
O, grant an honest fame, or grant me none! -Pope.

SECTION V.-QUANTITY.
By Quantity, in reading or speaking, is meant the length
of time occupied in uttering a syllable or word. Though it
is made chiefly on the long vowels, yet many of the conso140VOCAL CULTURE.
nant sounds afford instances of long quantity in the beautiful vanish they allow. Thus, in pronouncing the word
kome, the quantity may be increased by dwelling upon the
sound of the final element on.
The greatest danger attending long quantity, is the liability to monotony. This arises from keeping the voice on
the samle key throughout the utterance of the prolonged
sound. A thorough command and observance of the Median Stress, or swell of the voice, will avoid the danger.
Quantity may be classified in three divisions: Long,
Medium, and Short.
I.-Long Quantity.

single hlour than the sun in his whole day's circuit. The
poet's visions of evening are all compact of tender and
soothing images. It brings the wanderer to his home, the
child to his mother's arms, the ox to its stall, and the weary
laborer to his rest. But to the gentle-hearted youth who is
thrown upon the rocks of a pitiless city, and stands "homeless amid a thousand homes," the approach of evening
brings with it an aching sense of loneliness and desolation,
which comes down upon the spirit like darkness upon the
earth. In this mood, his best impulses become a snare to
him, and he is led astray because he is social, affectionate,
sympathetic, and warm-hearted.
If there be a young man thus circumstanced within the
sound of my voice, let me say to him that books are the
friends of the friendless, and that a library is the home of
the homeless. A taste for reading will always carry you to
converse with men who will instruct you by their wisdom
and charm you by their wit; who will soothe you when
fretted, refresh you when weary, counsel you when perplexed, and sympathize with you at all times. Evil spirits,
in the middle ages, were exorcised and driven away by bell,

Movement is closely connected with Quantity. It is a
more comprehensive term, however, including Quantity,
and, in addition, stops or pauses. Usually, Quantity and

short quantity, brisk or rapid movement.

EXPRESSION.
THE ability to use the voice at pleasure, in all the varie
ties of Quality, Force, Stress, Pitch, Quantity, and NMovement having been obtained, the next subject that should
engage the attention of the student of elocution, is Expressionz. While this implies a knowledge of Vocal Culture, it
comprehends much more. It is the life, the soul of read.
ing or speaking.
Although no invariable rules can be given for the cultivation of this faculty, a few suggestions may be of great advantage to the student:
(I) Study the author you read, and endeavor to make his
spirit, as revealed in the composition, your own; and then,
by appropriate Quality, Force, Stress, Pitch, Quantity, and
Movement, give expression to it.
(2j Suit the tones of the voice to the style of the composition. Do not read simple narrative as you would an
impassioned oration. If you are not able to distinguish the
difference in composition and feeling between the unadorned
narrative and the ornate sublime, or invective dramatic, it
will be impossible for you to read these styles withl good
effect. The ability to read impressively, implies a knowledge of the fundamental principles of rhetoric, so far, at
least, as they apply to style.
(3) Attend to the expression of the thought, not.to the
sound of the words. If your mind is fixed on the modulation rather than on the meaning, you will impress your
hearers with the idea that you are acting for their anmusement, and not reading for their instruction. The shortest
road to the expression is through the meaning. There is a
Droper time for attending to the delivery, the tones of
voice, modulation, emphasis, etc.; but it is before the
reader confronts his audience.
760EXPRESASO_N.
(4) Never impress your hearers with the thought of the
fine drill you have passed through. To avoid this, you
must not practice less, but more: make your preparation a
second nature.
(5) Be natural; but do not confound the natural with
the familiar; they are widely different in character and
effect. Every one loves to be naturally, but few familiarly,
spoken to; and he offends his audience who attempts to
be familiar with them.
STYLE.
Since expression depends upon the kind of composition,
and varies with it, in order to understand the subject thoroughly, it will be necessary to obtain a clear conception of
the various kinds of style, and the peculiarities of each,
which can only be done by a careful study of the standard
authors.
Style may be classified under six heads: Narrative, Descriptive, Didactic, Senatorial, Dramatic, and Scriptural.
The following will be sufficient for illustration:
I.--Narrative Style.
EXAMPLES.
1.-HUMANITY OF SIR ROBERT BRUCE.
Moderate Force--Middle Pitch--Medium Quantity
One morning, the English and their Irish auxiliaries
were pressing hard upon Sir Robert Bruce, who had given
his army orders to continue a hasty retreat; for to have
risked a battle with a much more numerous army, and in
the midst of a country which favored his enemies, would
have been extremely imprudent. On a sudden, just as
Sir Robert was dbout to mount his hlorse, he heard a
woman shrieking in despair.  "What is the matter?" said
the king; and he was informed by his attendants that a
151S2l STITUTE READER.
poor woman, a laundress or washerwoman, mother cf an
infant who had just been born, was about to be left behind
the army as being too weak to travel.
The mother was shrieking for fear of falling into the
hands of the Irish, who were accounted very cruel; and
there were no carriages or means of sending the woman
and her infant on in safety. They must needs be abandoned if the army retreated. Sir Robert was silent for a
moment when he heard this story, being divided between
the feelings of humanity, occasioned by the poor woman's
distress, and the danger to which a halt would expose his
army. At last he looked round on his officers, with eyes
which kindled like fire:
"Ah, gentlemen", he said, "let it never be said that a
man who was born of a woman, and nursed by a woman's
tenderness, should leave a mother and her infant to the
mercy of barbarians. In the name of God, let the odds
and the risk be what they will, I will fight Edmund Butler
rather than leave these poor creatures behind me. Let the
army, therefore, draw up in line of battle instead of retreating."
The story had a singular conclusion; for the English
general, seeing that Sir Robert Bruce halted and offered
him battle, and knowing that the Scottish king was one of
the best generals then living, conceived that lie must have
received some large supply of forces, and was afraid to
attack him. And thus Bruce had an opporttinity to send
off the poor woman and her child, and then to retreat at
his leisure, without suffering any inconvenience from the
halt.-Scott.
2.-THE DEATH OF A FATHER.
Moderate Force-Radical Stress--Medium Quantity.
The first sense of sorrow I ever knew was upon the death
of my father, at which time I was not quite five years of
age; but was rather amazed at what all the house meant,
than possessed with a real understanding why nobody was
willing to play wvith me. I remember I went into the room
where his body lay, and my mother sat weeping alone by it.
152EXPRESSION.
I had my battledore in my hand, and fell a beating the
coffin, and calling papa; for, I know not how, I had some
slight idea that he was locked up there.
My mother caught me in her arms, and, transported beyond all patience of the silent grief she was before in, she
almost smothered me in her embraces, and told me, in a
flood of tears, "Papa could not hear me, and would play
with me no more; for they were going to put him under
ground, whence he could never come to us again." She
was a very beautiful woman, of a noble spirit, and there was
a dignity in her grief amidst all the wildness of her transport, which, methought, struck me with an instinct of sorrow, that, before I was sensible of what it was to grieve,
seized my very soul, and has made pity the weakness of my
heart ever since.
The mind in infancy is, methinks, like the body in embryo, and receives impressions so forcibly that they are as
hard to be removed by reason as any mark, with which a
child is born, is to be taken away by any future application.
Hence it is that good-nature in me is no merit; but, having
been so frequently overwhelmed with her tears before I knew
the cause of my affliction, or could draw defenses from my
own judgment, I imbibed commiseration, remorse, and an
unmanly gentleness of mind, which has since ensnared me
into ten thousand calamities, from whence I can reap no
advantage, except it be that, in such a humor as I am now
in, I can the better indulge myself in the softness of humanity, and enjoy that sweet anxiety which arises from the
memory of past afflictions.--Steele.

look farther; I went up the sliore and down the shore; but
it was all one; I could see no other impression but that
one. I went to it again to see if there were any more, and
to observe if it might not be my fancy; but there was no
room for that, for there was exactly the very print of a
foot-toes, heel, and every part of a foot.
How it came thither, I knew not, nor could in the least

man perfectly-confused, and out of myself, I came home to
my fortification, not feeling, as we say, the ground I went
on, but terrified to the last degree, looking behind me at
every two or three steps, mistaking every bush and tree, and
fancying every stump at a distance to be a man. Nor is it
possible to describe how many various shapes an affrighted
imagination represented things to me in-how many wild
ideas were formed every moment in my fancy, and what
strange, unaccountable whimsies came into my thoughts by
the way.
When I came to my castle (for so, I think, I called it
ever after this) I fled into it like one pursued. Whether I
went over by the ladder, at first contrived, or went in at
the hole in the rock, which I called a door, I can not remember; for never frightened hare fled to cover, or fox to
earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat.

T'lo us, who dwell on its surface, the earth is by far the

it is also clothed with verdure, distinguished by trees,

it entirely disappears. That which we call alternately the
morning and the evening star-as, in one part of her orbit,
she rides foremost in the procession of night, in the other,
ushers in and anticipates the dawn-is a planetary world,
which, and the four others that so wonderfully vary their
mystic dance, are in themselves dark bodies, and shine only
by reflection-have fields, and seas, and skies of their own,
are fturnished with all accommodations for animal subsistence, and are supposed to be the abodes of intellectual life;
all which, together with our earthly habitation, are dependent on that grand dispenser of Divine munificence, the sun:
receive their light from the distribution of his rays, and
derive their comfort from his benign agency.
This sun, however, with all its attendant planets, is but a
very little part of the grand machine of the universe; every
star, though in appearance no bigger than the diamond that
glitters upon a lady's ring, is really a vast globe, like the
sun in size and in glory; no less spacious, no less luminous
than the radiant source of day: so that every star is not
barely a world, but the center of a magnificent systemhas a retinue of worlds, irradiated by its beams, and revolving round its attractive influence, all which are lost to
our sight in unmeasurable wilds of ether.
It is observed by a very judicious writer, that if the sun
himself, which enlightens this part of the creation, were
extinguished, and all the host of planetary worlds which
move about him were annihilated, they would not be missed
by an eye that can take in the whole compass of nature, any
more than a grain of sand upon the sea-shore. The bulk
of which they consist, and the space which they occupy, are
so exceedingly little, in comparison with the whole, that
tlheir loss would scarce leave a blank in the immensity of
God's works.--Hervey'.

and serenity of the weather in that genial season and favored
climate, contriouted to give splendor to this memorable ceremony. As he drew near the place, many of the more
youthful courtiers and hidalgos of gallant bearing, together
with a vast concourse of the populace, came forth to greet
and welcome him.
First, were paraded the Indians, painted according to
their savage fashion, and decorated with tropical feathers
and with their national ornaments of gold; after these were
borne various kinds of live parrots, together with stuffed
birds, and animals of unknown species, and rare plants, supposed to be of precious qualities; while great care was taken
to make a conspicuous display of Indian coronets, bracelets,
and other decorations of gold, which might give an idea of
the wealth of the newly-discovered region. After these,
followed Columbus, on horseback, surrounded by a brilliant
cavalcade of Spanish chivalry.
The streets were almost impassable from the countless
multitude; the windows and balconies were lined with the
fair; the very roofs were covered with spectators. It seemed
as if the public eye could not be sated with gazing on these
trophies of an unknown world, or on the remarkable man
by whom it had been discovered. There was a sublimity in
the event, that mingled a solemn feeling with the public
joy. It was looked upon as a vast and signal dispensation
of Providence, in reward for the piety of the monarchs;
and the majestic and venerable appearance of the discoverer,
so different from the youth and buoyancy which are so
generally expected from roaming enterprise, seemed in harmony with the grandeur and dignity of his achievement.

with them great treasures from the nlines, earned at the cost
of exile from the loved ones, to whom they were bearing
back the coveted gold, which was to transmute poverty into
luxury, and pain into delight.
The awful horror of the closing act of this tragedy is mitigated by the blessed deliverance of all the women and,
children, and some of the brave men, from the doomed
ship. Wlhen night descended upon the sea, and veiled the
great death-scene with her black shroud, the helpless ship
suddenly hid her desolation from mortal eyes beneath the
wild waves; but among the four hundred victims whom she
despairingly surrendered to the arms of her conquerer, there
was not one woman, not one child. The shriek of agony
that broke from the lips of the sinking multitude had no
piercing note in its sepulchral diapason. It was the deep
death-cry of men-of brave-hearted men alone.
But I forbear. The sorrow of that scene is too awful for
words. When the agony ceased upon the sea, it was only
to break forth afresh upon the land. Who shall measure it?
Who shall trace its tear-stained path over this continent?
Who shall count the broken hearts and ruined hopes of this
dread ravage?  None but God. None but He who let the
tempest loose that made the ship its prey; none but He who
alone can bind up the bleeding hearts, and inspire with
brighter hopes those whose hopes on earth this woe has
blighted; none but He of whom not one of us all dares to ask
the question, "What doest Thou?" none but He to whom
every stricken victim of the calamity we deplore, may say
with reverent lips, "Even so, Father; for thus it seemeth
good in thy sight."--Richards.

There is not, in my opinion, a more pleasing and triumphant consideration in religion, than this of the perpetual

the soul as going on from strength to strength; to consider
that she is to shine forever with new accessions of glory, and
brighten to all eternity; that she will be still adding virtue

4.-TALENT AND TACT.
Radical Stress -Medium Quantity - Moderate Movement.
Talent is something, but tact is every thing. Talent is
serious, sober, grave, and respectable; tact is all that, and
more, too. It is not a sixth sense; but it is the life of all
the five. It is the open eye, the quick ear, the judging
taste, the keen smell, and the lively touch; it is the interpreter of all riddles, the surmounter of all difficulties, the
remover of all obstacles.  It is useful in all places, and at
all times: it is useful in solitude, for it shows a man his way
into the world; it is useful in society, for it shows him his
way through the world.
Talent is power; tact is skill.  Talent is weight; tact is
nlomentum.   Talent knows what to do; tact knows how to
do it.  Talent makes a man respectable; tact will make him
respected.  Talent is wealth; tact is ready money.  For all
the practical purposes of life, tact carries it against talent ten
to one. Take them to the theater, and put them against
each other on the stage, and talent shall produce you a
tragedy that will scarce live long enough to be condemned;
while tact keeps the house in a roar, night after night, witl
its successful farces. There is no want of dramatic talent;
there is no want of dramatic tact;'but they are seldom
together.  So we have successful pieces which are not respectable; and respectable pieces which are not successful.

MOST of the failures in teaching may be traced to the

inquiring teacher upon this important subject, the following /directions are given, and he is assured that they are
not based upon mere theory, but are the result of not a
little experience.
The objects to be kept constantly in view, in giving instruction in reading as far as through the Second Reader,
are, (i) Readiness in calling words; (2) A distinct Articulation; (3) Correct Expression of the sense by proper
Emphasis and Inflection; (4) Pure Tone, or an agreeable
voice. It is not to be inferred, however, that nothing else
may be attended to; but if eminent success is desired, all
other matters must be made subordinate to these.
A subject generalized may be interesting, but, in particulars only does it become practical, and therefore valuable;

Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
Some poisoned by their wives, some sleeping killed;

Keeps death his court, and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state, and grinning at his pomp;
Allowing him a breath, a little scene
To monarchize, be feared, and killed with looks;

Conscript Fathers,
I do not rise to waste the night in words;
Let that plebeian talk;'t is not my trade;
But here I stand for right-let him show proofsFor Roman right; though none, it seems, dare stand
To take their share with me. Aye, cluster there!
Cling to your masters, judges, Romans, slaves!
HIis charge is false: I dare him to his proofs.
X0ou hlave my answer. Let my actions speak!
But this I will avow, that I have scorned,
And still do scorn, to hide my sense of wrong!
17'0EXPRESSION.
Who brands me on the forehead, breaks my sword,
Or lays the bloody scourge upon my back,
Wrongs me not half so much as he who shuts
The gates of honor on me-turning out
The Roman from his birthright; and for what?
To fling your offices to every slave!
Vipers that creep where man disdains to climb,
And having wound their loathsome track to the top
Of this huge, moldering monument of Rome,
Hang hissing at the nobler man below!
Come, consecrated Lictors, from your thrones,
Fling down your scepters; take the rod and ax,
And make the murder as you make the law.-CroZy.
VI.-Scriptural Style.     I'
The style of composition in which the Bible has come
down to us, being the old English, into which it was
originally translated, is somewhat peculiar; for this reason,
together with the sacredness belonging to the Scriptures,
and the fact of their being so universally read by all classes,
some prominence should be given to it.
While there are no rules which have any exclusive application to the reading of the Sacred Writings, there are,
however, two prevalent methods of reading them, both of
which should be carefully avoided.  One may be termed
the sanctiononious, and the other, the careless method. Let
the reader remember their high authority, and that what
he reads has a personal application to himself, and to each
of his hearers, and then observe the same rules he would
were he reading from a profane writer.

Orotund Quality - Moderate Force - Slow Movement.
The heavens declare the glory of God;
And the firmament sheweth his handiwork.
Day unto day uttereth speech,
And night unto night sheweth knowledge.
There is no speech nor language
Where their voice is not heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth,
And their words to the end of the world.
In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
And rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
His going forth is from the end of the heaven,
And his circuit unto the ends of it:
And there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
172EXPRESSION.
Tlhe law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul:
The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple,
The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.
The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the
eyes;
The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever:
The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.
More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much
fine gold;
Sweeter also than honey and the honey-comb.
Moreover by them is thy servant warned:
And in keeping of them there is great reward.
Who can understand his errors?
Cleanse thou me from secret faults,
Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins;
Let them not have dominion over me.
Then shall I be upright.
And I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my
heart,
Be acceptable in thy sight,
O Lord, my strength, and my Redeemer!-Psadms, xix.

Pure Tone - Moderate Movement.
Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels,
and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
tinkling cymbal. And though I have the gift of prophecy,
and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and
though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains,
and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow
all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body
to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
173INSTITUTE READER.
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not,
charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily
provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but
rejoiceth in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all
things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies,
they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease;
whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we
know in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that
which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
done away.
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as
a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I
put away childish things. For now we see through a glass,
darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then
shall I know even as also I am known. And now abideth
faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these
is charity.--. Corinthians, xtii.

I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the
presence of mine enemies; thou anointest my head with

shall follow me all the days of my life; and I will dwvell in

which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms,
do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in
the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory
of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what
thy right hand doeth: that thine alms may be in secret: and
thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee
openly.
And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues
and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of
men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But
thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in
secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward
thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as
the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for
their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them:
for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before
ye ask him.
After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which
art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this
day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the
power, and the glory, forever. Amen.--M/fat/hew, zi.

their attention and confidence. This you can do by relating some incident or story, or by engaging in some exercise
in which all can join; such as rapping on the desk to time,
keeping step while marching around the room, a simple
gymnastic movement, or any other exercise that will cause
them to forget themselves.
Their attention being gained-perhaps you can gain it
by the drawing itself-draw on the blackboard the picture
of an ox. Here it may be remarked, by way of parenthesis,
that, if you can not draw, do not cease trying, until you are
able to sketch at least the semblance of a picture. Pictures
and stories are the rivals of each other in the interest of
children; and the successful teacher will not fail to employ
them as a means of awakening thought,and conveying ideas
to their minds.
First Lesson.- Having the picture on the blackboard,
you ask: "W hat is this that I have drawn?-All who
can answer may raise the right hand. John may answer."
"An ox", is the reply of the child, with inflection and emphasis as appropriate as the most cultivated elocutionist
could make them.
You next ask: "How many of you have ever seen an
ox?  Has your father an ox?  What is his color?  Size?
Age? What can an. ox do? What is he good for?"
After extending the lesson in the direction here indicated,
to the extent you may judge proper, you can add a new
feature by asking: "Whose ox is this? What is his color?
How large is he?  How old?  Can this ox eat?  Can we
eat him?" The class discover by this time that something
is wrong with the answers, and some one possibly is able to
see the distinction between an ox and the pictzzre of an ox;
if not, you may either tell them the distinction, or dismiss
them to find it out for themselves.
At this or the next lesson, you may ask: "Of what use
are pictures?"  "To look at", says one, perhaps all. If
no one shoulld give the proper answer, you will ask: " Qf
what do you hz'zl/k when you see this picture?"  "Of an

Pure Tone--Radical Stress-Moderate Movement.
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be
not conformed to the world: but be ye transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that
good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God. For I say,
through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among
you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to
think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to
every man the measure of faith.
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office; so we, being many, are one
body in Christ, and every one members one of another.

simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth
mercy, with cheerfulness.
Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is
evil; cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned

MISCELLANEOUS READINGS.
I.--CULTIVATION   OF THE VOICE.
If we except the lower kinds of hnandicraft, nine-tenths
of all that' is done in the world is done by means of the
voice--by talking. It is by talking, we buy and sell; by
talking, the lawyer, thle doctor, the minister, the teacher
Derform the chief of their functions; by talking, the intercourse and machinery of life are chiefly kept in motion.
As it was by a word that creation was accomplished- as
the worlds came into being and were molded into shape,
not by the hand, but by the omnific voice of God, saying,
"Let there be light, and there was light "--so, in this
lower sphere of human action, the tongue is mightier thali
the hand.
The molding, propelling forces of society, come from the
use of words. By words, more than by all other means,
we persuade, convince, alarm, arouse, or soothe, or do
whatever else leads men to action and to achievement;
and while written words are full of power, yet even these
are feeble as compared with spoken words, the living utterances of the human voice. Not only so, but the manner
of speaking, the tone and quality of the voice, influence us
quite as much as the words spoken.
Yet how strangely we neglect this wonderful instrument.
The mechanic sees to it that his tools are as keen and strong
as it is in the power of art and labor to make them. The
sportsman spares no expense or care to have the articles
that minister to his pleasure in the highest possible state
of finish and perfection. How lavish we are in the purchase of instruments of music, and in keeping them properly tuned and cared for. Yet this most wonderful organ,

is worth more to us than all the instruments of music, all
178SELECTIONS.
the inventions of pleasure, all the tools of trade, that
human skill has devised, is left, for the most part, in utter
neglect, without intelligent guidance, its wonderful powers
almost totally uncultivated and undeveloped.
We all feel the sway that a well cultivated and modulated
voice has upon us-its power to give us pleasure and win
our assent; and yet the great majority of us neglect to cultivate in ourselves that which may give us such a power over
others. We are not oblivious to other advantages. We
strive to make ourselves acceptable, and to increase our
influence, by attention to dress, by the adornment of our
p)ersons, and by the cultivation of our minds, by stores of
knowledge, and by accomplishments of various kinds, while
the voice, which, more than any thing else is the direct
instrument of the soul, is treated with neglect.
We mumble and mutter what should come out clearly
and distinctly; we speak with a nasal drawl, or in a sharp
key, that sets all the finer chords of sympathy ajar; we use
just so much of the vocal power that is given us as is needed
to express, in the faintest way, our most imperative wants,
and indolently leave all the rest of its untold and exquisite
resources to go to waste.
Mrs. Siddons once made a shop-keeper turn pale with
afright, and unconsciously drop his goods upon the counter,
simply by the tone in which, by way of experiment, she
asked him the price of a pair of gloves. Undoubtedly,
Mrs. Siddons had natural gifts of voice, which do not
belong to every one. But a great part of the wonderful
fascination which she and the other members of that remarkable family exerted, was due to cultivation.
If those who undertake to influence others through the
medium of speech, would give this matter more attention,
they would find it very greatly to their own advantage, and
would contribute to the pleasure and profit of their hearers.
It is not enough that the advocate possesses great legal

gives them utterance. A competent teacher of elocution
is quite as important a part of the machinery of a law
school or a theological seminary as a professor of equity
in one, or of Hebrew in the other.   Yet in these institutions, which train more men for public speaking than
all the other professions togother, this matter is usually
entirely ignored.
II.-MODULATION.
LLOYD.
TIs not enough the voice be sound an.d clear,'Tis modulation that must charm the ear.
That voice all modes of passion can express,
Which marks the proper word with proper stress:
But none emphatic can the speaker call,
Who lays an equal emphasis on all.
Some, o'er the tongue the labored measures roll,
Slow and deliberate as the parting toll;
Point every stop, mark every pause so strong,
Their words like stage processions stalk along.
All affectation but creates disgust;
And e'en in speaking we may seem too just.
In vain for them the pleasing measure flows,
Whose recitation runs it all to prose;
Repeating what the poet sets not down,
The verb disjointing from its favorite noun,
While pause, and break, and repetition join
To make a discord in each tuneful line.
Some placid natures fill the allotted scene
With lifeless drawls, insipid and serene;
While others thunder every couplet o'er,
And alnost crack your ears with rant and roar
More nature oft, and finer strokes are shown
In the low whisper than tempestuous tone,,
180SELECTIONS.
And Hamlet's hollow voice and fixed amaze,
More powerful terror to the mind conveys
Than he who, swollen with impetuous rage,
Bullies the bulky phantom off the stage.
He who in earnest studies o'er his part,
WVill find true nature cling about his heart.
The modes of grief are not included all
In the white handkerchief and mournful draw!;
A single look more marks the internal woe
Than all the windings of the lengthened Oh I
Up to the face the quick sensation flies,
And darts its meaning from the speaking eyes.
Love, transport, madness, anger, scorn, despair,
And all the passions, all the soul is there.
III.-HAMLET'S ADVICE TO THE PLAYERS.
SPEAK the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,
trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it, as many
of your players, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines.
Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus; but
use all gently: for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I
may say) whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness.
O, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious, periwigpated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags-to
split the ears of the groundlings-who, for the most part,
ate capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-shows, and
nloise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing
Termagant; it out-herods Herod; pray you, avoid it.
Be not too tame either, but let your own discretion be
your tutor; suit the action to the word; the word to the
action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature; for any thing so overdone is from
the purpose of playing, whose end, both at first and now.

show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the
very age and body of the time, his forni and pressure.
Now, this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make the
unskillful laugh, can not but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of which one must, in your allowance, o'erweigh a
whole theater of others.
0, there be players, that I have seen play-and heard
others praise, and that highly-not to speak it profanely,
that neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of
Christian, pagan, or Turk, have so strutted and bellowed,
that I have thought some of Nature's journeymen had made
men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity so
abominably.
IV.-THE LITTLE WOMAN.
CHARLES DICKENS.
CHARLES DICKENS was borni at Portsmouth, England, February,
1812. He was, for some tiine, in the oifice of an attoriey; but soon
found a more congellial field as a reporter foI the newspapers of
London.
The first of his literary labors which gave hinm a reputation as
an author, was "Sketches by Boz ", a series of descriptions of
London character, which were first published in the "Morning
Chronicle". In 1836, these sketches were published in book form,
and followed by "Pickwick Papers ", "Oliver Twist"', "Nicholas
Nickleby", and other volumes. Died in June, 1870.
As an author, he excelled in his accurate delineations of human
character. He was a prolific writer. and also acquired'an enivinble
reputation as a public reader of his own works.
THERE was a little woman on board, with a little child;
and both little woman and little child were cheerful, goodlooking, bright-eyed, and fair to see.  The little woman
had been passing a long time with her sick mother in New
York.   The child was born in her mother's house, and she
had not seen her husband, to whom she was now returning,
for twelve months; having left him a month or two after
their marriage. Well, to be sure, there never was a little
woman so full of hope, and tenderness, and love, and anxiety as this little woman was; and all day long she wondered
whether "he" would be at the wharf; and whether "he"
182SELECTIONS.1
had got her letter, and whether, if she sent the child ashore
by somebody else, "he" would know it, meeting it in the
street, which, seeing that he had never set eyes upon it in
his life, was not very likely in the abstract, but was probable encugh to the young mother.
She was such an artless little creature, and was in such a
sunny, beaming, hopeful state, and let out all the matter
clinging closely about her heart so freely, that all the other
lady passengers entered into the spirit of it as much as she;
and the captain, who heard all about it from his wife, was
wonderous sly, I promise you, inquiring, every time we met
at table, as if in forgetfulness, whether she expected any
body to meet her at St. Louis, and cutting many other dry
jokes of that nature.
There was one little, weazen dried-apple-faced old woman, who took occasion to doubt the constancy of husbands
in such circumstances of bereavement; and there was another lady, with a lap-dog, old enough to moralize on the
lightness of human affections, and yet not so old that she
could help nursing the child now and then, or laughing with
the rest when the little woman called it by its father's name,
and asked it all manner of fantastic questions concerning
him, in the joy of her heart.
It was something of a blow to the little woman, that,,vhen we were within twenty miles of our destination, it
became clearly necessary to put this child to bed. But she
got over it with the same good humor, tied a handkerchief
around her head, and came out into the little gallery with
the rest. Then such an oracle as she became in reference
to the localities! and such facetiousness as was displayed
by the married ladies, and such sympathy as was shown by
the single ones, and such peals of laughter as the little
woman herself, who would just as soon have cried, greeted
every jest with!
At last, there were the lights of St. Louis, and here was
the wharf, and those were the steps; and the little woman,
covering her face with her hands, and laughing, or seeming
to laugh, more than ever, ran into her own cabin, and shut
herself up. I have no doubt but, in the charnming incon183INSTITUTE READER.
sistency of such excitement, she stopped her ears, lest she
should hear "him" asking for her; but I did not see her
do it.  Then a great crowd of people rushed on1 board,
though the boat was not yet made fast, but was wandering
about among the other boats to find a landing-place; and
every body looked for the husband, and nobody saw him,
wvhen, in the midst of us all, Heaven knows how she ever
got there, there was the little woman, clinging with both
arms tight around the neck of a fine, good-looking, sturdy
young fellow; and clapping her little hands for joy as she
dragged him through the small door of her small cabin, to
look at the child as he lay asleep.
V.-THE VICTORY OF THE FROSTS.
AVANELLE L. HOLMES.
ONE sweet September morn--so sweet a morn
As one might well believe was born in heaven,
I looked out from my window height, and saw
The silent, white encampment of the frosts,
Specking the green hill-side with many tents.
"There's war in that," I said; "such bold array
Means death to all fair, fragile, helpless things."
And so I shut my window with a sigh,
And thought of the dead summer's holy realm
That she had left as autumn's legacy;
And wondered if, amid his groaning vats,
Gorged with the vineyard's and the orchard's wealth,
He would be mindful of the sweet, frail things
That had been left his charge by the dead Queen.
I looked again, when in the clear, blue sky,
The brave, strong sun rode in high state at noon,
And lo! of all that vast array, no tent
Lingered to mark the first alarm of war.
I said, "The frost king feared to meet the sun,
And sb, at his approach, has fled away."
184SELECTIONS.
Next morn I looked again, and lo! again
The white tents glistened thickly, as before,
But when the sun approached, they all were gone.
So was it many morns; but, ah! one day
I looked out, and my heart sighed heavily,
For over all the landscape crimson stains
Told of the conflict and the victory:
And then I knew that in the silent night
The stealthy, cruel frosts had done their work.
Oh! it was pitiful and sad, to see
The green crown of the ancient, kingly oak
All dabbled with the crimson stains of war,
While all around his feet lay, dead and pale,
The sweet things that he might not e'en protect,
Since he could not protect himself: I heard
Him sigh and whisper, oh! so mournfully,
To the fair maple growing at his side,
Dabbled, like him, with blood, save that her stains
Were brighter, because womanly hearts do give
Their richest life-tide, if it be required.
And she, the maple, lifted up her hands,
And touched his forehead with a soft caress
That seemed at once to soothe and strengthen him,
And so his sigh grew gentle and more low.
So I went out, and kissed the crimson stains
Upon the meek, fair maple, and I pressed
Her bleeding hands against my weary brow,
And said, "Baptize me with thy ebbing life,
That when the frosts of time slay all my bloom
I may be beautiful, as thou art now."
Then she spread otut her hands above my head,
And murmured softly, like a mother praying,
And sprinkled crimson on my bended head,
And tore a fragment from her blood-died robe,
And gave it me, a dear remembrancer
Of how a queen can, uncomplaining, die.

may all try to make a picture on your slates like this one.
But there is another and shorter way of representing it.
Would you like to know that also?"  All hands are up in
an instant.  " I will show you?"
You now print on the blackboard OX, and say: "When
I see this, I think of an ox." Having now secured a lodgment in the mind of the child, by imparting to it an idea,
you continue by asking; "In how many ways can we represent an ox?   But does this "-pointing to the word
printed on the blackboard--" look like an ox?"  "No; it
is only the name of an ox."
"Suppose I were out in the yard, without a blackboard
or any thing else on which to make a picture or print a
name, how could I make you understand me, if I wanted to
talk to you about an ox?" This may puzzle them, and you
answer: "By my voice: listen."  Speak the word several
times distinctly, and spell it by letters and by sounds; then
have the class spell it after you, all together; then each one
alone, to make certain that they understand, and can give
the sounds correctly.
Studying the Lesson.-Having given them something
to do, and shown them how to do it, say to the class: "You
may take your seats, and draw the picture of an ox on your
slates; also print the word ox as many times as you have
fingers on your right hand, and tell me all you can about
him at the next recitation." Tlhis will not only be a valuable exercise, but will furnish them employment to occupy
their time while the other classes are reciting. By the time
the class is again called, the pupils will not only have the
word ox printed on their slates, but the word and the letters
o and x so indelibly printed on their minds that they can
call them at sight. In this way the entire alphabet may be
taught, and learned without even the appearance of labor;
for children love to use the pencil in making pictures or
printing letters.

VI.-THE HARBOR OF SAN FRANCISCO.
NOT evea the magnificent harbor of Constantino,ple, in
which security, depth, and expanse are combined, can rival
the peerless, land-locked Bay of San Francisco.  How shall
we describe it? You are sailing along the high coast of
California, when suddenly a gap is seen, as if the rocks ha-d
been rent asunder: you leave the open ocean, and enter the
strait. The mountains tower so high on either hand, that it
seems but a stone's throw from your vessel to the shore,
though, in reality, it is a mile. Slowly advancing, an hour's
sail brings you to where the strait grows still narrower; and
lo! before you, rising from the very middle of the waters, a
steep rock towers aloft like a giant warder of the strait.
Were that rock but fortified, not all the fleets in the world
could force the passage. You gaze back on the grim rock
as you emerge from its shadows, and so land-locked does
the scene appear, that you could fancy the mountains had
fallen in since you passed, and blocked up forever your
path to the ocean. You turn to look ahead; and lo! a
scene as wonderful again lies before you. You are in an
inland seal--you are in Francisco Bay. To your right
lies the Golden City; at a distance in front rise the steep
shores, and all around you an expanse of water-a lake for
calmness, a sea for extent-in which the fleets of the world
might ride at anchor.
San Francisco will be the entrepof of nations, the emporium of the East and West. High prices and the absorption
of the people in gold-seeking, will long cause it to import
every thing, and the deficiency of wood and the want of
coal will impede any thing like manufactures; even her
ships will, for a long time, be built in the harbors of the
Atlantic. But her merchants will be the brokers, her halls
the exchange, of the Pacific. Turn to the map, and you
will see the rare advantages of her position. The whole
Pacific, with its countless isles, lies open to her enterprise;
thb Australian continent and the realms of Hindostan will
reciprocate her commerce; and the Golden Gate fronts the!86SELECTIOLNS..
harbor of Canton and the mouth of the Yang-tse-kiang, the
great artery of Chinese traffic.
Instead of the tedious route by the Cape of Good Hope,
steam-vessels from  California will carry the produce of
China, India, and the Isles, to the Isthmus of Darien, and
shorten by half the voyage to Europe and Eastern America.
The very winds and currents combine to favor the new
region; and a vessel from Cape Horn, by keeping well out
to sea, will arrive sooner at San Francisco than at the intermediate ports on the South American coasts.
VII.-THE WHISTLE.
"You have heard," said a youth to his sweetheart, who stood
While he sat on a corn-sheaf at day-light's decline;
"You have heard of the Danish boy's whistle of wood:
I wish that that Danish boy's whistle was mine!"
"And what would you do with it? Tell me," she said,
While an arch smile played over her beautiful face.
"I would blow it," he answered, "and then my fair maid
Would fly to my side, and would there take her place."
"Is that all you wish it for? That may be yours
Without any magic," the fair maiden cried.;
"A favor so light one's good nature secures,"
And she playfully seated herself by his side.
"I would blow it again," said the youth, "and the charm
Would work so that not even modesty's check
Would be able to keep from my neck her fair arm."
She smiled and placed her fair arm round his neck.
"Yet once more would I blow, and the magic divine
Would bring me a third time an exquisite bliss,
You would lay your fair cheek to this brown one of mine,
And your lips stealing past it would give me a kiss."

The maiden iaughed out in her innocent glee"What a fool of yourself with the whistle you'd make;
For only consider how silly't would be
To sit there and whistle for what you might take."
VIII.-EDMUND BURKE.
HE habitually recurred to principles; he was a scientific
statesman. While other statesmen saw nothing but the
object of the hour, he loved to let his imagination play on
the future glories of America. His visions have all been,
even in the period of less than a century, almost literally
fulfilled. He delighted in contemplating those brave descendants of Englishmen who had sought in the American
wilderness a place of refuge, where they might worship God
in the way that their hearts and minds most approved. He
exulted in their flourishing condition, in the increase of
their wealth, their commerce, and their numbers. He pictured them reaping their golden harvests, and penetrating,
amid icebergs, into Hudson's Bay and Davis' Straits.
He was a writer of the first class, and excelled in almost
every kind of composition. In his mind, political principles
were not objects of barren speculation. Wisdom in him was
always practical. Whatever his understanding adopted as
truth, made its way to his heart, and sank deep into it; and
his ardent and generous feelings seized with promptitude
every occasion of applying it to mankind. "His knowledge
of history," says Grattan, "amounted to a power of foretelling; and when he perceived the wild work that was
doing in France, that great political physician, intelligent
of symptoms, distinguished betwcen the access of fever and
the force of health; and what other men conceived to be
the vigor of her constitution, he knew to be no more than
the paroxysm of her madness; and theil, prophet-like, he
pronounced the destinies of France, and in his prophetic
fury admonished nations."

IX.-THE RAVEN.
EDGAR A. POE.
EDGAR A. POE, an American writer, was born in Baltimore,
January, 1811; and died at the age of thirty-eight.
He was left destitute, at the death of his parents, in 1815; and
was adopted and educated by Mr. John Allen, of Richmond,
Virginia. His whole life was marked by wild and dissolute habits. His poems exhibit a high order of talent, but are wanting in
moral power.
ONCE upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and
weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten
lore -
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a
tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamberdoor.''T is some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamberdoorOnly this, and nothing more."
Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon
the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to
borrow
From  my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost
Lenore--
For the rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name
Lenore--
Nameless here for evermore.
And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple
curtain,
Thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors, never felt
before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood
repeating,
189)190              INSTITUTE READER.
"'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamberdoor
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber-door;
Only this, and nothing more."
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
" Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came
rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamberdoor,
That I scarce was sure I heard you "-here I opened wide
the door:
Darkness there, and nothing more.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream
before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no
token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered
word   " Lenore! "
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word--
"Lenore!'"
Merely this, and nothing more.
Back into my chamber turning, all my soul within me
burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than
before.
" Surely," said I, " surely that is something at my windowvlattice;
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery exploreLet my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore;'T is the wind, and nothing more."SELECTIONS.                     191
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt
and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of
yore:
Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped
or stayed he;
But with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamberdoorPerched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber-doorPerched and sat, and nothing more.
Then this ebony bird, beguiling my sad fancy into
smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it
wore,
C"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said,
"art sure no craven,
Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the
nightly shore.
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian
shore!"
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."
Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so
plainly,
Though its answer little meaning-little relevancy bore;
For we can not help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamberdoor--
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber.
doorWith such name as "Nevermore."
But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke
only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did
outpour;
Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he
fluttered,192              INSTITUTE READER.
Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have
flown before,
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown
before. "
Then the bird said, "Nevermore."
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters is its only stock and
store,
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster, till his song one burden
bore,
Till the dirges of his Hope the melancholy burden bore
Of'Never-nevermore.'  
But the raven, still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and
bust, and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of
yoreWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous
bird of yore
Meant in croaking, "Nevermore."
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease
reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated
o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light glcating o'er,
Sile shall press, ah, nevermore!

Quaff, 0, quaff, this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost

Quoth the raven, "Nevermore!"
"Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil! prophet still, if bird

Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here

Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted,
On this home, by horror haunted-tell me truly, I implore,
Is there-is there balm in Gilead? tell me-rtell me,

Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."

And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber-door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is

And the lamp-light o'er him streaming, throws his shadow

IT was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By thle name of Annabel Lee.
And th.s maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea;
But we loved with a love that was more than love,
I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraplhs of heaven
Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that, long ago,

A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her high-born kinsman came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulcher
In this kingdom by the sea.
Our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we,
Of many far wiser than we;
And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of this beautiful Annabel Lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:
And so all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my darling, my life, and my bride,
In the sepulcher there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea.
XI.-R-AIN ON THE ROOF.
COATES KINNEY.
WHEN the humid shadows hover over all the starry spheres,
And the melancholy darkness gently weeps in rainy tears,
What a joy to press the pillow of a cottage-chamber bed,
And listen to the patter of the soft rain over head.
Every tinkle on the shingles has an echo in the heart,
And a thousand dreamy fancies into busy being start;
And a thousand recollections weave their bright hues into
woof,
As I listen to the patter of the rain upon the roof.

lesson I.-Let us again return to the book-Exercise A. The adjectives, verbs, pronouns, etc., will be found
more difficult to teach, since the interest of children can
not be secured by pictures of them. You can gain their
attention to these words in some such method as the following: Point to the picture still remaining on the blackboard,
and ask: "'What is this?"  "It is an ox", is the answer.
Repeat several times, distinctly, but not in a drawling
manner, "It is an ox", and ask: "Would you like to see
all these words printed?"  Print them on the blackboard,
and spell, as before, by letters and by sounds. After this
exercise-the reading, the spelling by letters and by sounds
-print separately the words: IT, OX, IS, AN; and practice on them until the children can distinguiish and call
them readily. Add others; as, MY, ON, GO, etc., and
then arrange them as in the lesson.
The blackboard is preferable, for some reasons, to charts
and dissected cards, which are now in use in many schools.
Children regard those things with greater interest in which
they feel a degree of ownership; and they are more intimately connected withl what they have, at least, caused to
be made, and have seen executed, than in what is hung up
before them, from day to day, already printed. Then, too,
there is a freshness about printing on the blackboard, which
cards and charts do not possess.
If you can secure the charts and cards, however, use
them; but not to the exclusion of the blackboard.
Length of Lesson.-Let them be short at first. A
single sentence of not more than six words will be long
enough until your pupils are fully initiated into their new
field. As they advance, the lessons may be lengthened; but
you will be more likely to err in making them too long than
too short.
Remember that your pupils know nothing about sztudying.
and that it will, therefore, be necessary for you to go over
the lesson with them before they are called on to recite it.
Remember, also, that one sentence correctly read will tend
more to make good readers than many read indifferently.

And another cumes to thrill me with her eyes' delicious blue.
And forget I, gazing on her, that her heart was all untrue;
I remember but to love her with a rapture kin to pain,

In the spirit's pure, deep fountains, whence the holy passions well,

I781, a Mr. Venable, an army commissary, had taken two
of Hook's steers, for the use of the troops;. The act had

trespass against Mr. Venable in the district court of New
London. Mr. Henry appeared for the defendant, and is
said to have disported himself in this cause to the infinite
enjoyment of his hearers, the unfortul,ate Hook always
excepted.
After Mr. Henry became animated in the cause, he appeared to have complete control over the passions of his
audience. At one time, he excited their indignation against
Hook; vengeance was visible in every countenance: again,
when he chose to relax, and ridicule hi:n, the whole audience was in a roar of laughter. He painted the distresses
of the American army, exposed, almost inaked, to the rigors
of a winter's sky, and marking the frozen ground over which
they trod with the blood of their unshod feet.
" Where was the man," he said, "who had an American
heart in his bosom, who would not have thrown open his
fields, his barns, his cellars, the doors of his house, the portals of his breast to have receivred, wiUh open arms, the
meanest soldier in that little band of famished patriots?
Where is the man?   There he stands! but whether the
heart of an American beats in his bosom, you, gentlemen
are to judge."
He then carried the jury, by the powers of his imagination to the plains around York, the surrender of which had
followed shortly after the act complained of. He depicted
the surrender in the most glowing and noble colors of his
eloquence: the audience saw before their eyes the humiliation and dejection of the British as they marched out of
their trenches; they saw the triumph which lighted up every
patriot face, and heard the shouts of victory, and the cry
of' "W aslhington and LTiberty," as it rang and echoed
through the American ranks, and was reverberated from the
hills and shores of the neighboring river:-" But, hark!
what notes of discord are these which disturb the general
joy, and silence the acclamation of victory.? They are the
notes nf John Hook, hoarsely bawling through the American camp:'Beef! beef! beef!' "

XIII.-MY OLD HOME.
How vividly the picture rises before my mind as I write:
the quaint old house, with its many projections and odd
nooks-its inconvenient stairs and queer little lean-to, the
scene of so many boyish experiments in carpentering, painting, and the like!
And then its grand old attic, which, to our childish fancy,
seemed an inexhaustible store-house of treasure, that we
dragged forth from gloomy corners in shuddering haste,
almost feeling a ghostly hand upon our shoulders, or seeing
the gleam of a pair of ghostly eyes!
What a bright, cheerful, happy home it was! How the
sun streamed into the "keeping-room," where the dear
mother sat, the children played, and the lazy cat stretched
first one furry side and then the other to the fire!
What glorious times we had on rainy Saturdays, sonstructing dioramnas and cutting endless menageries out of
paper, which we painted after life, and exhibited for a
penny a head! How our quiet mother, sitting sewing, her
gray hair smoothed from off her placid brow, under a muslin
cap, would praise our skill and stroke the tangled locks
from our eager faces, while the toddling little sister would
seize the opportunity to clutch some much-coveted, gaylypainted animal, and crush it in her tiny hands!
But who could be angry with the happy baby, cooing and
talking to herself over the mangled fragments? Now that
the little restless feet have long been laid to rest, the dainty
fingers meekly clasped above the pure heart, we thank thee,
Heaven, that no reproachful word or angry deed comes back
to us, to turn our quiet sorrow into stinging remorse!
How swiftly the afternoon flew by, as we sat by the
cheerful fire, drawing and painting Scriptural pieces, which
our parents wisely judged better for both body and soul
than another two-hours' sermon! Those Scriptural pictures-I have them yet, neatly laid away in a portfolio of

After an early tea, our father gathered us all about him,
and, opening the old family Bible, embellished with woodcuts that were miracles of art to our youthful eyes, read to
us one of the beautiful Bible stories, and explained and
gently moralized, until, our attention beginning to flag, he
struck up, in his rich voice, some well-known hymn, in
which we all joined, its echoes mingling in our dreams as
our happy heads sank to rest upon our pillows.
My memory tempted me once to stray through its
familiar rooms; but alas! all the charm had departed, and,
sad at heart, I turned away, for I knew I had lost forever
my old home.

GONE in her childish purity
Out from the golden day;
Fading away in the light so sweet,
Where the silver stars and the sunbeams meet,
Paving the path for her waxen feet
Over the silent way.
Over the bosom tenderly
The pearl-white hands are pressed;
The lashes lie on the cheeks so thin,
Where the softest blush of the rose hath been,
Shutting the blue of her eyes within
The pure lids closed in rest.
Over the sweet brow lovingly,
Twineth her sunny hair;
She was so frail that Love sent dowil,
From his heavenly gems, that soft, bright crown,
To shade her brow with its waves so brown,
Light as the dimpling air.

Held by love's shining ray,

Doth brighten the harp in the unknown land?

XV.-THE DUMB -WAITER.
F. S. COZZENS.
WE have put a dumb-waiter in our house. A dumb-waiter
is a good thing to have in the country, on account of its
convenience. If you have company, every thing can be
sent up from the kitchen without any trouble; and if the
baby gets to be unbearable, on account of his teeth, you
can dismiss the complainant by stuffing him in one of the
shelves, and letting him down upon the help.
To provide for contingencies, we had all our floors deafened. In consequence, you can not hear any thing that is
going on in the story below; and, when you are in an upper
room of the house, there might be a political ratification
meeting in the cellar, and you would not know it.'I'herefore, if any one should break into the basement, it would
not disturb us; but to please Mrs. Sparrowgrass, I put stoutSELECTI O0S..ron bars into all the lower windows. Besides, Mrs. Sparrowgrass had bought a rattle when she was in Philadelphia;
such a rattle as watchmen carry there. This is to alarm our
neighbor, who, upon the signal, is to come to the rescue
with his revolver. He is a rash man, prone to pull trigger
first, and make inquiries afterward.
One evening, Mrs. S. had retired, and I was busy writing,
when it struck me a glass of ice-water would be palatable.
So I took the candle and a pitcher, and went down to the
pump. Our pump is in the kitchen. A country pump in
the kitchen is more convenient; but a well with buckets is
certainly most picturesque.  Unfortunately our well water
has not been sweet since it was cleaned out.
First I had to open a bolted door that lets you into the
basement-hall, and then I went to the kitchen-door, which
proved to be locked. Then I remembered that our girl
always carried the key to bed with her, and slept with it
under her pillow. Then I retraced my steps, bolted the
basement-door, and went up into the dining-room. As is
always the case, I found, when I could not get any water, I
was thirstier than I supposed I was.
Then I thuught I would wake our girl up. Then I concluded not to do it. Then I thought of the well; but I
gave that up on account of its flavor. Then I opened the
closet-doors; there was no water there: and then I thoaught
of the dumb-waiter! The novelty of the idea made me
smile. I took out two of the movable shelves, stood the
pitcher on the bottom of the dumb-waiter, got in myself
with the lamp; let myself down, until I supposed I was
within a foot of the floor below, afid then let go!
We came down so suddenly, that I was shot out of the
apparatus as if it had been a catapult; it broke the pitcher,
extinguished the light, and landed me in the middle Df the
kitchen at midnight, with no fire, and the air not muc)
above the zero point. The truth is, I had miscalculated
the descent-instead of falling one foot, I had fallen five.
My first impulse was to ascend by the way I came down,
but I found that impracticable. Then I tried the kitchendoor; it was locked.  I tried to force it open; it ras

made of two-inch stuff, and held its own. Then I hoisted
the window, and there were the rigid iron bars. If I ever
felt angry at any body, it was at myself, for putting up
those bars to please Mrs. Sparrowgrass.  I put them up, not
to keep people in, but to keep people out.
I laid my cheek against the ice-cold barrier, and looked
out at the sky: not a star was visible; it was as black as ink
overhead. Then I thought of Baron Trenck and the prisoner of Chillon. Then I made a noise. I shouted until I
was hoarse, and ruined our preserving-kettle with the poker.
That brought our dogs out in full bark, and between us we
made night hideous.
Then I thought I heard a voice, and listened; it was

he would not listen to reason. In the excitement, I had
forgotten his name, and that made matters worse. It was
not until he had roused up every body around, broken in
the basement-door with an ax, gotten into the kitchen with
his savage dogs and shooting-iron, and seized me by the
collar, that he recognized me-and then he wanted me to
explain it!

XVI.-EMPLOYMENT OF INDIANS IN              THE
AMERICAN WAR.
CHATHAM.
TVILrLIAM PITT, EARL OF CHATHAM, was born in England, 1708;.nd fell dead while addressing the House of Lords, April 7, 1778.
As the art of reporting with rapidity and accuracy was unLknown at that time, but few of his speeches have come down
to us.
During the Revolutionary war, he was a warm friend of America, and an earnest advocate of her rights against British oppression. The following speech, on the employment of Indian allies,
will serve as an illustration of his eloquence as an orator and his
clharacter as a man.
MY LORDS: Who is the man that, in addition to the disgraces and mischiefs of the war, has dared to authorize and
associate to our arms the tomahawk and scalping-knife of
the savage? -to call into civilized alliance the wild and
inhuman inhabitants of the woods?-to delegate to the
merciless Indian the defense of disputed rights, and to
wage the horrors of his barbarous war against our brethren? My lords, these enormities cry aloud for redress and
punishment.  But, my lords, this barbarous measure has
been defended, not only on the principles of policy and
necessity, but also on those of morality.  "For it is perfectly allowable," says Lord Suffolk, "to use all the means
which God and nature have put into our hands."
I am astonished, I am shocked to hear such principles
confessed: to hear them avowed in this house, or in this
country!
My lords, I did not intend to erncroach so much on your
attention; but I can not repress my indignation;-I feel

myself impelled to speak. My lords, we are called upon
as members of this house, as men, as Christians, to protest
against such horrible barbarity! "That God and nature
have put into our hands! " What ideas of God and nature
that noble lord may entertain I know not; but I know that
such detestable principles are equally abhorrent to religion
and humanity. What! to attribute the sacred sanction of
God and nature to the massacres of the Indian's scalpingknife! to the cannibal savage, torturing, murdering, devouring, drinking the blood of his mangled victims! Such
notions shock every precept of morality, every feeling of
humanity, every sentiment of hlonor! These abominable
principles, and this more abominable avowal of them, demand the most decisive indignation!
I call upon that right reverend and most learned bench
to vindicate the religion of their God, to support the justice of their country. I call upon the bishops to interpose
the unsullied sanctity of their lawn-upon the judges, to
interpose the purity of their ermine, to save us from this
pollution. I call upon the honor of your lordships, to
reverence the dignity of your ancestors, and to maintain
your own.
I call upon the spirit and humanity of my country, to
vindicate the national character. I call upon your lordships, and upon every order of men in the state, to stamp
upon this infamous procedure the indelible stigma of public
abhorrence.
XVII.-EARLY RISING.
JOHN G. SAXE.
JOHr i G. SAXE, an American poet, was born in Vermont, June,
1816. As a writer, he is noted for his puns and witticisms; but his
poems abound in truth and practical instruction.
"GOD bless the man who first invented sleep!"
So Sancho Panza said, and so say I;
And bless him also that he did n't keep
His great discovery to himself; or try
204SELECTIONS.
To make it-as the lucky fellow mightA close monopoly by "patent right!"
Yes--bless the man who first invented sleep
(I really can't avoid the iteration);
But blast the man, with curses loud and deep,
Whate'er the rascal's name, or age, or station,
Who first invented, and went round advising,
That artificial cut-off--Early Rising!
"Rise with the lark, and with the lark to bed,"
Observes sonie solemn, sentimental owl.
Maxims, like these are very cheaply said:
But ere you make yourself a fool or fowl,
Pray just inquire about the rise-and fall,
And whether larks have any bed at all!
The "time for honest folks to be in bed,"
Is in the morning, if I reason right;
And he who can not keep his precious head
Upon his pillow till't is fairly light,
And so enjoy his forty morning winks,
Is up to knavery, or else--he drinks!
Thomson, who sung about the "Seasons," said
It was a glorious thing to rise in season;
But then he said it-lying-in his bed

He wrote so charmingly. The simple fact is,
His preaching was n't sanctioned by his practice.'T is. doubtless, well to be sometimes awake:

For the soft visions of the gentle night;lYTROD UCTION.
Position.-Many errors in reading, as in,peaking, arise
from an improper position. A person can not read or speak
well, unless he stands well. A careless attitude begets imperfect articulation and a lifeless expression. You can not,
therefore, be too particular on this point. Do not suppose
th!at you can secure the end by once telling your pupils how
to stand, and how to hold the book; it will require unwearied l)atience and persevering effort.
Never allow your pupils to read while sitting. The act
of rising to the feet and standing, individualizes the pupil,
and adds that increased vigor of action so necessary to good
reading. TIhe clatss may or may not stand during the reci
tation, but the ireader should alc,ays stand. If the class
stand, then the reader should advance a step to the front,
that he may feel, as before, his individuality.
Manner of Standing.-A graceful and, at the same
time, firm position, is with the heels together, or nearly so;
the toes turned out; the body erect; weight resting equally
on both feet: or, with the weight of th.e body thrown on
one foot, and the heel of the other brought to the hollow
of the one bearing the weight.  Standing Xwith the feet parallel, or thrust apart in a straddling position, is ungraceful
and tiresome, and should be especially guarded against.
The school-room affords excellent opportunities for the formation of good habits in this respect.
While correcting the improper habit of stooping and:oose
standing, do not allow your pupils to run to the other extreme of throwing back the head and shoulders in a strained
manner. The body should be held erect, without being
awkwardly stiff; and the pupil should be checked in his
readling, the moment he falls into an improper position.
Holding the Book.-The book, if not too large and
heavy, should be held in the left hand, and well up, but not,o high as to conceal the chin of the reader.  Never allow
the book to be held close to the face; such a practice is not
only ungraceful, but prevents a free utterance, and, moreover, is injurious to the sight. Besides, if the book be held

XXI.- SPARTACUS.
KELLOGG.
IT had been a day of triumph in Capua. Lenttllus, returning with victorious eagles, had amused the populace
with the sports of the amphitheater. The shouts of revelry
had died away; the roar of the lion had ceased; the last
loiterer had retired from the banquet, and the lights in the
palace of the victor were extinguished.
In the deep recess of the amphitheater, a band of gladiators were assembled. Their muscles were still knotted
witll the agony of conflict. The foam was upon their lips,
and tl-he scowl of battle yet lingered upon their brows; when
Spartacus rising in their midst, thus addressed them:
Ye call me chief, and ye do well to call him chief, who,
for twelve long years, has met, upon the arena, every shape
of man or beast the broad empire of Rome could furnish;
and who never yet lowered his arms. And if there is one
among you who can say that ever, in public fight or private

brawl, my actions did belie my tongue, let him step forth,
and say it! If there be three in all your company dare face
me on the bloody sand, let them come on!
Yet I was not always thus-a hired butcher, a savage
chief of still more savage men. My father was a Thracian,
who feared great Jupiter, and brought to the rural deities
his offerings of fruits and flowers.  My ancestors came from
Greece, and settled among the vine-clad rocks and citron
groves of Syrasella. My early life ran quiet as the brook by
which I played. When, at noon, I gathered my sheep beneath the shade, to play upon the shepherd's flute, I had a
friend, the son of our neighbor, to share the pleasure. We
led our flocks to the samlie pasture, and partook together our
rustic meal.
One evening, after the sheep were folded, and Nwe were all
seated beneath the myrtle that shaded our cottage, my
granilsire was speaking of Marathon and Leuctra, and how,
in ancient times, a little band of Spartans, in a defile of
the mountains, withstood a whole army. I did not thenINSTITUTE READER.
know what war meant; but my cheek did burn; I knew
not why; and I clasped the knees of the venerable man, till
my mother, parting the hair from off my forehead, kissed
my throbbing temples, and bade me go to rest, and think
no more of those old tales and savage wars.
That very night, the Romans landed on our shores; and
the clash of steel was heard within our quiet vale. I saw
the breast that had nourished me trampled by the iron
heel of the war-horse-the bleeding body of my fathei
flung amid the blazing rafters of his dwelling.
To-day, I killed a man in the arena; and when I broke
his helmet-clasps, behold! l/e was nzy friend!  He knew
me-smiled faintly-gasped -and died. It was the same
sweet smile that I had marked upon his face when, in
adventurous boyhood, we scaled some lofty cliff, to pluck
the first ripe grapes, and bear them home in childish triumph.  I told the praetor he was my friend, noble and
brave, and begged his body, that I might burn it tipon
the funeral pile, and mourn over him.   Ay! on my
knees, among the dust and blood of the arena, with tears,
I begged that boon. But he drew back as if I were pollution, and sternly said, "Let the carrion rot!  There are
no noble men but Romans!"
0 Rome! Rome! I thank thee! Thou hast been a tender nurse to me. Ay! thou hast given to that poor, gentle,
timid shepherd lad, who never knew a harsher sound than
flute notes, muscles of iron and a heart of flint. Thou hast
taught him to drive the sword through bones, and rugged
brass, and plated mail; thou hast taught him to gaze into
the glaring eyeballs of the fierce Numidian lion, even as a
smooth-cheeked boy upon a laughing girl. And' he shall
pay thee back till the yellow Tiber is red as frothing wine,
and in its deepest oozing, thy life-blood lies curdled.
Ye stand here now like giants, as ye are: the strength
of brass is in your toughened fibers. But to-morrow some
Roman Adonis, breathing sweet perfume from his curly
locks, shall pat your red brawn, and bet his sesterces upon
your blood. Hark! Hear ye yon lion roaring in his den?'T is three days since- he tasted flesh; but to-morrow he

If ye are beasts, then stand here, like fat oxen, waiting
for the butcher's knife. If ye are men-follow me! Strike
down yon guard, gain the mountain passes, and there do
bloody work, as did your sires at old Thermopyle! Is
Sparta. dead? Is the old Grecian spirit frozen in your
veins, that you do crouch and cower like a belabored
hound beneath his master's lash?  0, comrades! warriors!
Thracians!--if we must fight, let us fight for ourselves!
If we must slaughter, let us slaughter our oppressors!  If
we must die, let it be under the clear sky, by the bright
waters, in noble, honorable battle!
FROM   THE DESERTED        VILLAGE.
OLIVER GOLDSMITH.
OLIVER GOLDSMITH was born at Pallas, Ireland, November, 1728.
At college, he was not noted for his close application to books; but
was given to rambling and dissipation. After leaving college, he
traveled on foot through Flanders, France, and Switzerland, with
no means of procuring a subsistence save his skill in disputation
and in playing the flute.
On returning to England, in 1756, he began his literary career as
a newspaper writer, in London; and died at the age of forty-six.
His writings, both in prose and poetry, are characterized by a
clear. pure, and classic style. The most noted of his writings are,
"The Traveler", "The Deserted Village", "The Vicar of Wakefield", and "Animated Nature."
XXII.-THE VILLAGE PREACHER.
NEAR yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,
And still where many a garden flower grows wild,
There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,
The village preacher's modest mansion rose.
A man he was to all the country dear,
And passing rich with forty pounds a year.
Remote from towns he ran his godly race,
Nor e'er had changed, nor wished to change his place;
Unskillful he to fawn, or seek for power,
By doctrines fashioned to the varying hour;
Far other aims his heart had learned to prize,
More bent to raise the wretched than to rise.

His house was known to all the vagrant train;
He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain;
IThe long-remembered beggar was his guest,
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;
The ruined spendthrift, now no longer proud,
Claimed kindred there, and had his claims allowed;
The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,
Sat by his fire, and talked the night away,
Wept o'er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,
Shouldered his crutch, and showed how fields were won,
Pleased with his guests the good man learned to glow,
And quite forgot their vices in their woe.
Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
His pity gave, ere charity began.
Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
And e'en his failings leaned to virtue's side;
But in his duty prompt at every call,
He watched and wept, he prayed and felt for all;
And, as a bird each fond endearment tries
To tempt its new-fledged offspring to the skies,
He tried each art, reproved each dull delay,
Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.
Beside the bed where parting life was laid,
And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismayed,
The reverend champion stood. At his control
Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,
And his last faltering accents whispered praise.
At church, with meek and unaffected grace,
His looks adorned the venerable place;
Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,
And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray,
The service passed, around the pious man,
With steady zeal, each honest rustic ran;
E'en children followed, with endearing wile,
And plucked his gown, to share the good man's smile.

Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread,
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.

BESIDE yon straggling fence that. skirts the way,
With blossomed furze unprofitably gay,
There, in his noisy mansion skilled to rule,
The village master taught his little school:
A man severe he was, and stern to view:
I knew him well, and every truant knew;
Well had the boding tremblers learned to trace
The day's disasters in his morning face:
Full well they laughed, with counterfeited glee
At all his jokes, for many a joke had he;
Full well the busy whisper, circling round,
Conveyed the dismal tidings when he frowned
Yet he was kind, or, if severe in aught,
The love he bore to learning was his fault;
The village all declared how much he knew,'Twas certain he could write, and cipher, too;
Lands he could measure, terms and tides presal e,
And e'en the story ran that he could gauge.
In arguing, too, the parson owned his skill,
For e'en though vanquished, he could argue still;
While words of learned length and thundering sound
Amazed the gazing rustics ranged around;
And still they gazed, and still the wonder grew
That one small head could carry all he knew.
But past is all his fame. The very spot
Where many a time he triumphed is forgot.

Distance.--'lhe distance between the teacher and class
should be great enough to secure fullness of expression, but
not so great as to cause the pupil to strain his voice in
making himself heard. Insist upon a proper degree of loudness, but be careful not to mistake it for distinct/ness. If
articulation be imperfect and the general expression lifeless, additional quantity of sound will only increase the
difficulty. Pure tone is penetrating, and will find its way
to a much greater distance than the impure, though the
latter be assisted by great quantity.
Sounds.-The phonetic analysis of words, or spelling by
sounds, can not be commenced too early nor practiced too
carefully. You may begin with detached letters, or with the
analysis of words. Let attention first be given to the vocal
sounds, or tonic elements, as these are more easily uttered,
and form the frame-work of the language. After the voc6als,
take up the subvocals, then the aspirates. It would, of
course, be unwise to attempt a full analysis, giving technical
terms to children; but they should be taught to distinguish
and give the principal sounds.
A chart and key to the sounds of the letters may be found
in Part II, beginning on page 74. In teaching them, do
not take up too many at a time. One or two will be as
many as children will remember at one lesson, and will be
enough for all the practic( you desire.
The following will be found a good method for teaching
the sounds: Print the word nanme, for example, on the
blackboard, and after repeating it several times, call on the
class to give it in concert.  Then drop the other elements,
and repeat the sound of a alone. Let the class practice, as

Where village statesnmen talked with looks profound,

The white-washed wall, the nicely-sanded floor,
The varnished clock that clicked behind the door;

The pictures, placed for ornament and use,
The twelve good rules, the royal game of goose;
The hearth, except when winter chilled the day,
With aspen boughs, and flowers, and fennel gay;
While broken tea-cups, wisely kept for show,
Ranged o'er the chimney, glistened in a row.
XXV.-THE SPIDER.
OLIVER GOLDSMITH.
ANIMALS, in general, are sagacious in proportion as they
cultivate society. The elephant and the beaver show the
greatest signs of this, when united; but when man intrudes
into their communities, they lose all their spirit of industry,
and testify but a very'small share of that sagacity for which,
in a social state, they are so remarkable.
Among insects, the labors of the bee and the ant have
employed the attention and admiration of the naturalist;
but their whole sagacity is lost upon separation, and a single
bee or ant seems destitute of every degree of industry-is
the most stupid insect imaginable, languishes for a time in
solitude, and soon dies.
Of all the solitary insects I have ever remarked, the spider
is the most sagacious, and its actions, to me, who have
216SELECTIONS.
attentively considered them, seem almost to exceed belief.
The insect is formed by nature for a state of war, not only
upon other insects, but upon its own kind.  For this state,
nature seems perfectly well to have formed it. Its head and
breast are covered with a strong natural coat of mail, which
is impenetrable to the attempts of every other insect;
and its abdomen is enveloped in a soft, pliant skin, which
eludes the sting even of a wasp.  Its legs are terminated by
strong claws, not unlike those of a lobster; and their vast
length, like spears, serves to keep every assailant at a
distance.
Not worse furnished for observation than for attack or
defense, it has several eyes, large, transparent, and covered
with a horny substance, which, however, does not impede
its vision. Besides this, it is furnished with a forceps above
the mouth, which serves to kill or secure the prey already
caught in its claws or its net.
Such are the implements of war with which the body is
immediately furnished; but its net to entangle the enemy
seems what it chiefly trusts to, and what it takes most pains
to render as complete as.possible.  Nature has furnished the
body of this little creature with a glutinous liquid, which it
spins into thread coarser or finer, as it chooses to contract
or dilate the opening through which it comes. In order to
fix its threads when it begins to weave, it emits a small drop
of its liquid against the wall, which, hardening by degrees,
serves to hold the thread very firmly.  Then receding from
the first point, the thread lengthens, and when the spider
has come to the place where the other end of the thread
should be fixed, gathering up, with its claws, the thread
which would otherwise be too slack, it is stretched tightly,
and fixed in the same manner to the wall as before.
In this manner, it spins and fixes several threads parallel
to each other, which, so to speak, serve as the warp to the
intended web. To form the woof, it spins, in the same
manner, its thread, transversely, fixing one end to the first
thread that was spun (and which is always the strongest of
the whole web) and the other to the wall. All these threads,
being newly spun, are glutinous, and therefore stick to each

other whbrever they happen to touch; and in those parts of
the web most exposed to be torn, our natural artist strengthens them by Coubling the thread, sometimes six-fold.
Thus far, naturalists have gone into the description of this
animal: what follows is the result of my own observation
upon that species of the insect called the house-spider.  I
perceived, about four years ago, a large spider in one corner of my room, making its web, and though the maid frequently leveled her fatal broom against the labors of the
little animal, I had the good fortune then to prevent its
destruction, and, I may say, it more than paid me by the
entertainment it afforded.
In three days, the web was, with incredible diligence,
completed; nor could I avoid thinking that the insect
seemed to exult in its new abode. It frequently traversed
it round, and examined the strength of every part of it.
The first enemy, however, it had to encounter, was another
and a much larger spider, which, having no web of its own,
and having probably exhausted all its stock in former labors
of this kind, came to invade the property of its neighbor.
Soon, then, a terrible encounter ensued, in which the invader seemed to have the victory; and the laborious spider
was obliged to take refuge in its hole. Upon this, I perceived the victor using every art to draw the enemy from
his stronghold. He seemed to go off, but quickly returned,
and when he found all arts in vain, began to demolish the
new web without mercy. This brought on a new battle,
and, contrary to my expectations, the laborious spider became conqueror, and fairly killed his antagonist.
Now, then, in peaceful possession of what was justly its
own, it waited three days with the utmost impatience, repairing the breaches of its web, and taking no sustenance
that I could perceive. At last, however, a large blue-fly fell
into the snare, and struggled hard to get loose. The spider
gave it leave to entangle itself as much as possible; but it
seemed to be too strong for the cobweb. I must own, I
was greatly surprised when I saw the spider immediately
sally out, and, in less time than a minute, weave a new net
around its captive, by wlhich the motion of its w-ings was'18SELECTIONS.
stopped; and when it was fairly hampered in this manner,
it was seized and dragged into the hole.
In this manner it lived, in a precarious state, and nature
seemed to have fitted it for such a life; for upon a single fly it
subsisted for more than a week. I once put a wasp into the
nest; but when the spider came out in order to seize it, as
usual, upon perceiving what kind of an enemy it had to deal
with, it instantly broke all the bands that held it fast, and contributed all that lay in its power to disengage so formidable
an antagonist. When the wasp was at liberty, I expected the
spider would set about repairing the breaches that were made
in its net; but those, it seems, were irreparable, wherefore the cobweb was now entirely forsaken, and a new one
begun, which was completed in the usual time.
I had now a mind to see how many cobwebs a single
spider could furnish; wherefore I destoyed this, and the
insect set about another. When I destroyed the other also,
its whole stock seemed entirely exhausted, and it could spin
no more. The arts it made use of to support itself, now
deprived of its principal means of subsistence, were indeed
surprising. I have seen it roll up its legs like a ball, and
lie motionless for hours together; but cautiously watching
all the time. When a fly happened to approach sufficiently near, it would dart out all at once, and often seize
its prey.
Of this life, however, it soon began to grow weary, and
resolved to invade the possession of some other spider, since
it could not make a web of its own. It made an attack upon
a neighboring fortification with great vigor, and at first was
as vigorously repulsed. Not daunted, however, with one
defeat, it continued to lay siege to another's web for three
days, and, at length, having killed the defendant, actually
took possession.
When smaller flies happen to fall into the snare, the
spider does not sally out at once, but very patiently waits
until it is sure of them; for upon his immediately approaching, the terror of his appearance might give the captive
strength sufficient to get loose. Its manner is to wait patiently, till, by ineffectual and impotent struggles, the cap219INSTITUTE READER.
tive has wasted all its strength, and then it becomes a certain and easy conquest.
The insect I am now describing lived three years. Every
year it changed its skin, and got a new set of legs. I have
sometimes plucked off a leg, which grew again in two or
three days. At first, it dreaded my approach to its web;
but at last it became so familiar as to take a fly out of nmy
hand; and upon my touching any part of the web, would
immediately leave its hole, prepared either for defense
or attack.
XXVI.-THE SNOW.
OH, the snow, the beautiful snow,
Filling the sky and earth below;
Over the house-tops, over the street,
Over the heads of the people you meet;
Dancing,
Flirting,
Skimming along;
Beautiful snow! it can not do wrong,
Flying to kiss a fair lady's cheek,
Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak,
Beautiful snow from the heaven above,
Pure as an angel, gentle as love!
Oh, the snow, the beautiful snow,
How the flakes gather and laugh as they go
Whirling about in the maddening fun,
It plays in its glee with every one.
Chasing,
Laughing,
Hurrying by;
It lights on the face, and it sparkles the eye.
And the dogs, with a bark and a bound,
Snap at the crystals that eddy around:
The town is alive, and its heart in a glow,
To welcome the coming of beautiful snow.
220ASELECTIONS.
How wildly the crowd goes swaying along,
Hailing each other with humor and song!
How the gay sledges, like meteors, pass by,
Bright for the moment, then lost to the eyeRinging,
Swinging,
Dashing they go,
Over the crust of the beautiful snow;
Snow so pure when it falls from the sky,
To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by,
To be trampled and tracked by the thousands of feet,
Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street.
Once I was pure as the snow-but I fell!
Fell, like the snow-flakes, from heaven to hell;
Fell, to be trampled as filth in the street;
Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on and beat,
Pleading,
Cursing,
Dreading to die,
Selling my soul to whoever would buy,
Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread,
Hating the living, and fearing the dead;
Merciful God! have I fallen so low?
And yet I was once like the beautiful snow!
Once I was fair as the beautiful snow,
With an eye like a crystal, a heart like its glow;
Once I was loved for my innocent grace,
Flattered and sought for the charms of my face!
Father,
Mother,
Sisters, all,
God and myself, I've lost by my fall;
The veriest wretch that goes shivering by,
Will make a wide swoop lest I wander too nigh;
For all that is on, or above me, I know,
There is nothing that's pure as the beautiful snow.
221INSTITUTE READER.
How strange it should be that this beautiful snow
Should fall on a sinner with no where to go!
How strange it should be, when the night comes again,
If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain,
Fainting,
Freezing,
Dying alone,
Too wicked for prayer, too weak for a moan
To be heard in the streets of the crazy town,
Gone mad in the joy of the snow coming down;
To be, and so die, in my terrible woe,
With a bed and a shroud of the beautiful snow.
XXVII.-MOSES' SONG OF DELIVERANCE.
EXODUS, XV.
TEiE history of MosEs, the author of the Pentateuch--the great
leader, the legislator, and the prophet--is as wonderful as it is
beautiful.
His remarkable deliverance from the edict of Pharaoh; his education in the royal family; his preparation for the great work of
(lelivering the Hebrews from their bondage; their forty years' wanderings in the wilderness of Arabia; his mysterious death and
burial, all prove that "Truth is stranger than fiction."
THEN sang Moses and the children of Israel this song
unto the Lord, and spake, saying, I will sing unto.the Lord,
for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider
hath he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength and
song, and he is become my salvation; he is my God, and I
will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will
exalt him.
The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name. Pharaoh's chariots and. his hosts hath he cast into the sea: his
chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.   The
depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
stone. Thy right hand, 0 Lord, is become glorious in
power: thy right hand, 0 Lord, hath dashed in pieces the
enemy. And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast
overthrown them that rose up against thee; thou sentest
forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.
222SELECTIONS.
And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
Logether, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths
were congealed in the heart of the sea. The enemy said,
I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my
lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my
hand shall destroy them. Thou didst blow with thy wind,
the sea covered them; they sank as lead in the mighty
waters.
Who is like unto thee, 0 Lord, among the gods? who is
like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders? Thou stretchedest out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people
which thou hast redeemed; thou hast guided them in thy
strength unto thy holy habitation.
The people shall hear and be afraid: sorrow shall take
hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. Then the dukes of
Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling
shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan
shall melt away. Fear and dread shall fall upon them: by
the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone;
till thy people pass over, 0 Lord, till the people pass over,
which thou hast purchased. Thou shalt bring them in, and
plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the
place, 0 Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in;
in the sanctuary, 0 Lord, which thy han.ds have established,
The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. For the horse
of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen
into the sea, and the Lord brought again the waters of the
sea upon them; but the children'of Israel went on dry land
in the midst of the sea.
XXVIII.-PAUL'S DEFENSE BEFORE AGRIPPA.
ACTS, XXVI.
THEN Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak
or thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, ar,3wered for himself: I think myself happy, King A
223INSTITUTE BEA DER.
because I shall answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: especially
because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I beseech thee
to hear me patiently.
My manner of life from my youth, which was at first
among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify,
that after the most straightest sect of our religion, I lived
a Pharisee. And now I stand and am judged for the hope
of the promise made of God unto our fathers: unto which
promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and
night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa,
I am accused of the Jews.
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you,
that God should raise the dead? I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name
of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem:
and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were
put to death, I gave my voice against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to
blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.
Whereupon as I went to Damascus, with authority and
commission from the chief priests, at mid-day, 0 king, I
saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of
the sun, shining round about me, and them which journeyed
with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard
a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue,
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for tlhee to)
kick against the pricks. And I said, Who art thou, I.ord?
And he said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest. But rise,
and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for
this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of
these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the
which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the
people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
224SELECTIONS,
and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may
receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them
which are sanctified by faith that is in me.
Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto
the heavenly vision: but shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts' of Judea,
and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn
to God, and do works meet for repentance. For these
causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to
kill me. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and
Moses did say should come: that Christ should suffer, and
that he should be the first that should rise from the dead,
and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles.
And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
voice, Paul thou art beside thyself; much learning doth
make thee mad.
But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak
forth the words of truth and soberness. For the king knoweth these things, before whom also I speak free]y. For I am
persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him;
for this thing was not done in a corner. King Agrippa,
believest thou the prophets?  I know that thou believest. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest
me to be a Christian. And Paul said, I would to God,
that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day,
were both almost and altogether such as I aln, except
these bonds.
And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the
governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them: and
when they had gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death,
or of bonds. Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man
might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto
Casar.

ceding, and the words and letters left on the blackboard, if
you desire.
See that the teeth are well separated in pronouncing the
vocals, in order that the sound may have a free passage out
of the mouth. And be assured that in this, as in every dei)artment of reading, you can not expect your pupils to do
bettei than their model. The best way of teaching reading,
particularly to young persons, is by example. Look well to
your example, and be certain that it is such as you would
have them imitate.
Interest.-Nothing is more fruitful of indistinct articulation and improper inflection and emphasis than lifelessness
in recitation. RajbzZ reading does not necessarily involve
indistinct articulation, but lifeless reading does.  Never
allow a recitation to lose its interest.  You will find the
surest way of interesting others is to become ~interested
yourself.
A good method for interesting small children is the following: Suppose the sentence to be the first in Exercise I:
It is ani ox.  Call on a pupil to substitute a different word
for ox, and read: It is a cowze;  t is a horse,' t is a sheep,.
It is a man, etc.  You can also make other changes, as: 1t
is nmy ox-our ox- my hat--his halt-my tojp-her bonielhis dog, etc.
To enlist the attention and afford variety, pupils may
sometimes be permitted to read by pauses.  Let one commence the lesson, and cease at the first pause with proper
inflection; the next take it up, in correct time and tone,
and read to a second pause; and so on, until the paragraph
or lesson is completed.  Reading by words, in the same
manner, may also be found advantageous at times.
Rate.-Perhaps no department of reading is more imperfectly understood than this, and yet none is more simple.
The cause of this imperfect understanding is, that rate is
confounded with quantity.  Quantity affects the rate, but
rate does not depend so much upon quantity as it depends
apon the length of the pauses. If rate depended upon the

XXI.--DIRECTIONS RELATING TO OUR IDEAS.
ISAAC WATTS.
ISAAC WATTS was born at Southampton, in England, 1674. It is
said that he began the study of the Latin language at the age of
four years. He was, for many years, the pastor of an Independent Church in his native place. He died November 25, 1748.
I.
FURNISH yourself with a rich variety of ideas; acquaint
yourself with things ancient and modern; things natural,
civil, and religious; things domestic and national; things
of your native land and of foreign countries; things present,
past, and future; and, above all, be well acquainted with
God and yourself; learn animal nature, and the workings
of your own spirit.
The way of attaining such an extensive treasure of ideas,
is with diligence to apply yourself to read the best books;
converse with the most knowing and the wisest of men, and
endeavor to improve by every person in whose company you
are; suffer no hour to pass away in lazy idleness, in impertinent chattering, or useless trifles; visit other cities and
countries when you have seen your own, under the care of
one who can teach you to profit by traveling, and to make
wise observations; indulge a just curiosity in seeing the wonders of art and nature; search into things yourself, as well
as learn them from others; be acquainted with men as well
as books; learn all things, as much as you can, at first hand,
and let as many of your ideas as possible be the representations of things, and not merely the representations of other
men's ideas: thus your soul, like some noble building, shall
be richly furnished with original paintings, and not mere
copies.
II.
Recollect every day the things you have seen, or heard,
or read, which may have made any addition to your understanding. Read the writings of God and men with diligence
and perpetual reviews: be not fond of hastening to a new
book, or a new chapter, till you have well fixed and establisI,ed in your own mind what was useful in the last; make
226SELECTIONS.
use of your memory in this manner, and you will sensibly
experience a gradual improvement of it, while you take
care not to load it to excess.
III.
Talk over the things which you have seen, heard, or
learnt, with some proper acquaintance. This will make a
fresh impression upon your memory; and if you have no
fellow student at hand, none of equal rank with yourself,
tell it over to any of your acquaintances, where you can do
it with propriety and decency; and whether they learn any
thing by it or not, your own repetition of it will be an improvement to yourself; and this practice will also furnish
you with a variety of words and copious language to express
your thoughts upon all occasions.
IV.
Commit to writing some of the most considerable improvements which you daily make; at least, such hints as
may recall them again to your mind when, perhaps, they are
vanished and lost. At the end of every week, or month,
or year, you may review your remarks for these two reasons:
First, to judge of your own improvement, when you shall
find that many of your younger collections are either weak
and trifling, or, if they are just and proper, yet they are
grown now so familiar to you that you will thereby see your
own advancement in knowledge. And in the next place,
what remarks you find there worthy of your riper observation, you may note them with a marginal star, instead of
transcribing them, as being worthy of your second year's
review, when the others are neglected.
XXX.-RULES FOR IMPROVEMENT BY CONVERSATION.
ISAAC WATTS.
I.
IF we would improve our minds by conversation, it is a
great happiness to be acquainted with persons wiser than
ourselves. It is a piece of useful advice, therefore, to get
227INSTITUTE READER.
the favor of their conversation frequently, as far as circuilstances will allow: and if they happen to be a little reserved, use all obliging methods to draw out of them what
may increase your own knowledge.
If you happen to be in company with a merchant or a
sailor, a farmer or a mechanic, a milkmaid or a spinster,
lead them into a discourse of the matters of their own peculiar province or profession; for every one knows, or ought
to know, his own business best. In this sense, a common
mechanic is wiser than a philosopher. By this means, you
may gain some improvement in knowledge from every one
you meet.
II.
Believe that it is possible to learn something from persons
much below yourself. We are all short-sighted creatures;
our views are also narrow and limited; we often see but one
side of a matter, and do not extend our sight far and wide
enough to reach every thing that has a connection with the
thing we talk of; we see but in part, and know but in part,
therefore it is no wonder we form not right conclusions,
because we do not survey the whole of any subject or
argument.
III.
When you retire from company, then converse with yourself in solitude, and inquire what you have learned for the
improvement of your understanding, or for the rectifying
your inclinations, for the increase of your virtues, or the
meliorating your conduct and behavior in any future parts
of life.
If you have seen some of your company candid, modest,
humble in manner, wise and sagacious, just and pious in
their sentiments, polite and graceful as well as clear and
strong in their expression, and universally accel)table and
lovely in their behavior, endeavor to impress the idea of all
these upon your memory, and treasure them up for your
imitation.

XXXIII.-BILL BUNKER'S LAW-SUIT.
D. P. THOM 60ON.
LOCKE rode on, and soon reached a rough-built but sub
stantial looking farm-house, with sundry out-buildings, on
one of which he read the name of the singular occupant.
In the last-named building, he at once perceived that there
was a gathering of quite a number of individuals, the nature
of which was explained to him by the hint he had received
from his informant on the road.
Tying his horse, he joined several who were going in,
and soon found himself in the midst of the company
assembled in the low, unfinished room which constituted
the interior, as parties, witnesses, and spectators of a justice's court, the ceremonies of which were about to be
commenced.
There were no counters, counting-room, or desk; and a
few broad shelves, clumsily put up on one side, afforded
the only indication observable in the interior arrangement
of the room, of the use to which it was devoted. On these
shelves were scattered, at intervals, small bunches of hoes,
axes, bed-cords, and such articles as are generally purchased
by those who purchase little; while casks of nails, grindstones, quintals of dried salt fish, and the like, arranged
round the room on the floor, made up the rest of the
2~2SELECTIONS.
owner's merchandise, an annual supply of which, it appeared, he obtained in the cities every winter in exchange for the products of his farm; ever carefil, like a
good political economist, that the balance of trade should
not be against him.
The only table and chair in the room were now occupied
by the justice; the heads of casks, grindstones, or bunches
of rakes, answered for seats for the rest of the company.
On the left of the justice, sat the defendant, whose composed look, and occasional knowing smile, seemed to indicate his confidence in the strength of his defense, as well
as a consciousness of possessing some secret advantage over
his opponent. On the other hand, sat Bunker, the plaintiff
in the suit.
Ascertaining, from  the remarks of the bystanders, his
identity with the man he had become so curious to see,
Locke fell to noting his appearance closely, and the result
was, upon the whole, a highly favorable prepossession.
He was a remarkably stout, hardy-looking man; and,
although his features were extremely rough and swarthy,
they yet combined to give him an open, honest, and very
intelligent countenance.  Behind him, as backers, were
standing in a group three or four of his sons, of ages varying from fifteen to twenty, and of bodily proportions promising any thing but disparagement to the Herculean  stock
from which they originated.
Trhe parties were now called and sworn; when Bunker
(there being no attorneys employed to make two-hour
speeches on preliminary questions) proceeded at once to
the merits of his case. He produced and spread open his
account-book, and then went on to show his manner of
charging, which was wholly by hieroglyphics, generally designating the debtor by picturing him out, at the top of the
page, with some peculiarity of his person or calling. In the
present case, the debtor, who was a cooper, was designated
by the rude picture of a man in the act of hooping a barrel; and the article charged,, there being but one item in
the account, was placed immediately beneath, and represented by a shaded, circular figure, which the plaintiff said
I. R. 20.
233INS1'ITUTE READER.
was intended for a cheese that had been sold to the defendant some years before.
"Now, Mr. Justice," said Bunker, after explaining, in a
direct, off-hand manner, his peculiar method of bookkeeping: "the article here charged, the man had-I will,
and do swear to it; for here it is in black and white.
And I having demanded my pay, and he having not only
refused it, but denied ever buying the article in question, I
have brought this suit to recover my just dues. And now I,
wish to see if he will get up here in court, and deny the
charge under oath. If he will, let him; but may the Lord
have mercy on his soul! "
"Well, sir," replied the defendant, promptly rising:
"you shall not be kept from having your wish a minute;
for I here, under oath, do swear that I never bought or
had a cheese of you in my life."
"Under the oath of God, you declare it, do you?"
sharply asked Bunker.
"I do, sir," firmly answered the other.
"Well, well!" exclaimed the former, with looks of utter
astonishment; "I would not have believed that there was
a man in all this country who would dare to do that!"
After the parties had been indulged in the usual amount
of sparring for such occasions, the justice interposed, and
suggested that,.as the oaths of the parties were at complete
issue, the evidence of the book itself, which he seemed to
think was entitled to credit, would turn the scale in favor
of the plaintiff, unless the defendant could produce some
rebutting testimony.
Upon this hint, the latter called up two of his neighbors,
who testified, in his behalf, that he himself always made a
sufficient supply of cheese for his family; and they were
further knowing that, on the year of the alleged purchase,
instead of buying, he actually sold a considerable quantity
of the article.
This evidence seemed to settle the question in the mind
of the justice; and he now soon announced that he felt
bound to give judgment to the defendant for his costs.
"Judged and sworn out of the whole of it, as I am a
234sinner!" cried the disconcerted Bunker, after sitting a moment, working his rough features in indignant surprise;
"yes, fairly sworn out of it, and saddled with a bill of
costs, to boot! But I can pay it; so reckon it up, Mr.
Justlce, and we will have it all squared on the spot. And,
on the whole, I am not so sure but a dollar or two is well
spient, at any time, in finding out a fellow to be a scoundrel
who has been passing himself off among people for an
honest man," he added, pulling out his purse, and angrily
dashing the required amount down upon the table.
"Now, Bill Bunker," said the defendant, after very

the following sentence at a slow rate, it would be necessary

If the sentence be read and articulated as it should be, the

rhetoric requires-a slight one after the subject and one
before the object of the verb-time sufficient will have
have elapsed to entitle it to be called slow reading.
Inflection.--It would be folly to attempt to give specific directions for the inflection of each word of a sentence.
This general rule, however, may safely be adopted: Let the
inflection of principal words be well marked, so that it will
be readily known whether the rising or falling inflection is
intended. If you have difficulty in getting your pupils to
inflect their words properly, the plan recommended for
securing interest-that of substituting different words-will
be found to be an excellent auxiliary. Another plan, perhaps the best one, is the following: After the sentence has
been read so frequently as to be remembered, have the pupil
repeat it without looking on the book, and the voice will
naturally take the proper inflection. Ask the pupil to say it
to you just as he would talk it, or direct him to say it to
the class.
Let declarative sentences be read with the downward
inflection, and be particularly careful of the last word of
each sentence. The child will very probably make the fill
stop by running the last three or four words lower and lower,
the last one being scarcely audible. Instead of this, the
force should be kept up to the close, and the last word
uttered with greater force than the ones immediately preceding.
All direct interrogative sentences should be read with the
ulpward inflection. In exclamatory sentences, let nature be
strictly followed, with this comprehensive rule: Give full
sway to your surprise, and assist the voice by dropping the
chin and opening the eyes a little.

XXXIV.-PURE WATER.
PAUL DENTON.
PAUL DENTON, a missionary in the early days of Texas, when
the State was a Mexican province, collected a crowd at a barbecue
where he promised there should be plenty to drink of the best of
liquors. He did this that he might draw a crowd to preach to
them. After the barbecue was over, one of the boldest asked.
"Where is your liquor? "
The following was Denton's beautiful answer:
THERE-there is the liquor which God, the Eternal,
brews for his children.
Not in the simmering still, over smoking fires, choked
with poisonous gases, and surrounded with stench of sickening odors and rank corruption, doth your Father in
heaven prepare that precious essence of life-pure cold
water.  But in the green shade and grassy dell, where the
red deer wanders and the child loves to play, there God
brews it; and down, low down, in the deepest valleys,
where the fountains murmur and the rills sing; and high up
on tile moultain-tops, where the naked granite glitters like
gold in the sun; where hurricanes howl mtusic; where big
waves roar the chorus, sweeping the march of God-there
he brews it, that beverage of life, health-giving water.
And every-where it is a thing of beauty; glealling in a
dew-drop; singing in the summer rain; shining in the icegem, till the trees seem turning to living jewels, spreading
a golden vail over the setting sun, or white gauze round the
midnight moon; sporting in the glacier; dancing in the

bubbles on its brink; its foam brings not madness and

starving orphans weep not burning tears in its clear depths;
no drunkard's shrieking from the grave curses it in words
of despair! Speak out, my friends, would you exchange it

THE cannon were belching their last
O'er the fields where the routed were lying,
And shouting pursuers strode fast
Through the heaps of the dead and the dying.
IMars' rage was beginning to wane,
The fierce cared no longer to strike,
And the good stooped to soften the pain
Of victor and vanquished alike.
A yellow-haired Austrian lad
Lay at length on a shot-furrowed bank;
He was comely and daintily clad
In the glittering dress of his rank.
Not so white, though, his coat as his cheek;
Not so red the sash crossing his chest
As the horrible crimson streak
Of the blood that had welled from his breast.
His foes approached where he laid,
To bear him in reach of their skill,
But he murmured, "Give others your aid;
By our fatherland! let me lie still."

He had folded the silk he loved well,

To wave it in triumph he fell,

As they gazed on the shot-riven rag;

With a prayer for a spirit so brave;

XXXVIII.-HAMLET'S       GRIEF ON      THE   MARRIAGE
OF HIS MOTHER.
SHAKESPEARE.
WILLIAM  SHAKESPEARE, the world's great dramatic poet, was
born at Stratford-on-Avon, April 23, 1564. Of his early life and education but little is known.
The limited circumstances of nis father prevented a liberal education at school; but his numerous allusions to the history and mythology of the ancients prove that he was not unacquainted with
books. Dryden graphically describes his genius in the following
lines:
" He was the man who, of all modern, perhaps ancient, poets, had
the largest and most comprehensive soul. All the images of nature
were still present to him, atnd lie drew tliem, not laboriously, but
luckily: when he describes aniy tlillg, you more than see it--you
feel it, too. Those who accuse llim to have wanted learning, give him
the greater commendation: he was naturally learned; he needed not
the spectacles of books to read Inature; lie looked inwards, and found
her there. I can not say he is every-where alike; were he so, I
should do him injury to compare him with the greatest of mankind.He is many times fiat and insipid; his comic wit degenerating into
elenches, his serious, swelling into bombast.
"But he is always great when some great occasion is presented to
him; no manl can say he ever had a fit subject for his w't, and did
not raise himself as high above the rest of poets'As the cypresses are wont to do among the slender shrubs.'
"The consideration of this, made Mr. Hales, of Eton, say,'that
there was no subject of which any poet ever wrote, but he would
produce it much better done in Shakespeare.' "
He retired from the drama in the fullness of his fame; and died
in 1616, at the age of fifty-two.
O, THAT this too, too solid flesh would melt,
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew!
Or that the Everlasting had not fixed
His canon'gainst self-slaughter.  O God! O God!
How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable
Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! 0 fie!'t is an unweeded garden
That grows to seed; things rank, and gross in nature
Possess it merely.  That it should come to this!
But two months dead! -nay, not so much, not two:

Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly.  Heaven and earth!
Must I remember? Why, she would hang on him,
As if increase of appetite had grown
By what it fed on: and yet within a month,Let me not think on't;-Frailty, thy name is woman!
A little month; or ere those shoes were old
With which she followed my poor father's body,
Like Niobe, all tears:- why, she--even sheO heaven! a beast that wants discourse of reason
Would have mourned longer-married with my uncle,
My father's brother: but no more like my father
Than I to Hercules.  Within a month
Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
She married.

Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights:
Yond' Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
He thinks too much;--such men are dangerous.
Would he were fatter! But I fear him not;
Yet if my name were liable to fear,
I do not know the man I should avoid
So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
He is a great observer, and he looks
Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
Seldom he smiles; and smiles in such a sort
As if he mocked himself-and scorned his spirit,
That could be moved to smile at any thing.
Such men as he be never at heart's ease
While they behold a greater than themselves;
And therefore are they very dangerous.

Vain pomp, and glory of this world, I hate ye!

There is, betwixt that smile he would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
More pangs and fears than wars or women have;
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again.

Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.

XLI.-OTHELLO'S APOLOGY.
SHAKESPEARE.
MOST potent, grave, and reverend seigniors,
My very noble and approved good masters,
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter
It is most true; true I have married her;
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent, no more.
Rude am I in my speech,
And little blessed with the set phrase of peace,
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field;
And little of this great world can I speak
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
And, therefore, little shall I grace my cause
In speaking of myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
I will a round, unvarnished tale deliver
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charnls,
What conjuration, and what mighty magic
(For such proceedings I am charged withal)
I won his daughter with.
Her father loved me; oft invited me;
Still questioned me the story of my life,
From year to year; the battles, sieges, fortunes
That I have passed.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days
To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
244SELECTIONS.
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents by flood and field;
Of hair-breadth'scapes in the imminent deadly breach;
Of being taken by the insolent foe,
And sold to slavery; of my redemption thence;
And with it all my travel's history.
This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house affairs would draw her thence;
Which ever, as she could with haste dispatch,
She'd come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not attentively.
I did consent:
And often did beguile her of her tears,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth suffered. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
She said, In faith,'t was strange,'t was passing strange
"'rwas pitiful,'t was wondrous pitiful;
She wished she had not heard it; yet she wished
That heaven had made her such a man.
She thanked me;
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her. Upon this hint, I spake.
She loved me for the dangers I had passed;
And I loved her that she did pity them.
This is the only witchcraft I have used.
240INTR OD UCTION.
the practice begets confusion. There is no necessity for
this, however, and it will not prevail if the class is under
proper discipline. A class of twenty can be taught to read
in as exact time as they can be taught to sing. The other
objection, and the more weighty one, is, that it begets
carelessness. The constant vigilance of the teacher will be
required to prevent this.
Always read the sentence for the class, or as much of it,
at least, as they can read, observing all the pauses and inflections you make; then, at a given signal, let them begin
and read as far as you have read. Never allow a class to
read in concert till they all know what words are to be
emphasized, and what inflection is to be given to each word.
Advantages of Concert Reading.-By it, you can,
in a given time, accomplish more, in the aggregate, than by
individual drill. It has also the advantage of assuring the
timid children, and bringing them out unconsciously. A
timid child may be encouraged to read in a fuller tone in a
class than when alone, frightened by the sound of his own
voice; and if you have pupils who read too fast, who disregard all pauses, or pass too rapidly over them, they can be
effectually restrained by exercises of this kind. But concert
reading must not be substituted for individual drill. Each
pupil has his peculiarities, which it is the work of the
teacher to direct and cultivate, rather than to destroy.
Pictures.-Many teachers suppose that pictures are inserted in reading books only for the private entertainment
of the child; and therefore omit their notice altogether in
the study and recitation of the lesson. They may be made
useful in both ways. They are valuable in awakening interest,
and might have been spoken of in that connection.
In assigning a lesson, say to the class: "Now, I want
you to look at this bpicture very carefully, so as to be able
to tell me all about it at the next recitation; and when you
have found out all you can about it yourself by looking
at it, you may read what the author says of it; and the
next time I hear your lesson, I will have you tell Ine what

All scattered in the bottom of the sea.
Some lay in dead men's skulls: and in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As't were in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.

That now give evidence against my soul

But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath on me alone:
Oh spare my guiltless wife, and my poor children!

XXIV.-SHAKESPEARE'S POWER OF EXPRESSION.
Q(UARTERLY REVIEW.
To say that he was the greatest man that ever lived, is to
provoke a useless controversy, and comparisons that lead
to nlothing, between Shakespeare and Caesar, Shakespeare
alld Charlemagne, Shakespeare and Cromwell; to say that
he was the greatest intellect that ever lived, is to bring the
shades of Aristotle, and Plato, and Bacon, and Newton,
and all your other systematic thinkers, grumbling about
us, with demands for a definition of intellect, which we
are by no means in a position to give; nay, finally, to say
that he is the greatest poet that the world has produced
(a thing which we would certainly say, were we provoked
to it) would be unnecessarily to hurt the feelings of Homer,
247INSTITUTE READER.
and Sophocles, and Dante, and Milton. What we will say,
then, and what we will challenge the world to gainsay, is
that he was the greatest expresser that ever lived. This
is glory enough, and it leaves the other questions open.
Other men may have led, on the whole, greater and
more impressive lives than he; other men, acting on their
fellows through the same medium of speech that he used,
may have expended a greater power of thought, awl,
achieved a greater intellectual effect, in one consistent
direction; other men, too (though this is very questionable), may have contrived to issue the matter which they
did address to the world in more compact and perfect
artistic shapes. But no man that ever lived said such
splendid extempore things on all subjects universally; no
man that ever lived had the faculty of pouring out on all
occasions, such a flood of the richest and deepest language.
He may have had rivals in the art of imagining situations: he had no rival in the power of sending a gush
of the appropriate intellectual effusion over the image and
body of a situation once conceived.
From the jewelled ring on an alderman's finger, to the
most mountainous thought or deed of man or demon,
nothing suggested itself that his speech could not envelop
and enfold with ease. That excessive fluency which astonished Ben Jonson when he listencd to Shakespeare in person, astonishes the world yet  Abundance, ease, redundance, a plenitude of word, 3ound, and imagery, which,
were the intellect at work only a little less magnificent,
would sometimes end in sheer braggardism and bombast,
arc the characteristics of Shakespeare's style.  Nothing is
sup)pressed, nothing omitted, nothing canceled.  On and
on the poet flows, words, thoughts, and fancies crowding
on him as fast as he can write, all related to the matter
on hand, and all poured forth together, to rise and fall on
the waves of an established cadence.
There is, perhaps, not a thought, or feeling, or situation
really common and generic to human life, on wllic:h he
has not exercised his prerogative; and wherever he has
once been, woe to the man that comes after him! He

has overgrown the whole system and face of things, like
an universal ivy, which has left no wall uncovered, no
pinnacle unclimbed, no chink unpenetrated.   Since he
lived, the concrete world has worn a richer surface.  He
found it great and beautiful, with stripes here and there
of the rough old coat seen through the leafy labors of his
predecessors; he left it clothed throughout with the wealth
and autumnal luxuriance of his own unparalled language.
XLV.-LITTLE JIM.
THE cottage was a thatched one, the outside old and mean,
But all within that little cot was wondrous neat and clean;
The night was dark and stormy, the wind was howling wild,
As a patient mother sat beside the death-bed of her child:
A little worn-out creature, his once bright eyes grown dim:
It was a collier's wife and child, they called him little Jim.
And oh! to see the briny tears fast hurrying down her cheek,
As she offered up the prayer, in thought, she was afraid to
speak,
Lest she might waken one she loved far better than her life;
For she had all a mother's heart, had that poor collier's wife.
With hands uplifted, see, she kneels beside the sufferer's bed,
And prays that He would spare her boy, and take herself
instead.
She gets her answer from the child: soft fall the words
from him,
" MIother, the angels do so smile, and beckon little Jim;
I have no pain, dear mother, now, but, 0! I am so dry,
Just moisten poor Jim's lips again, and, mother, do n't
you cry."
With gentle trembling haste, she held the liquid to his lip;
He smiled to thank her, as he took each little, tiny sip.
"Tell father, when he- comes from work, I said good-night
to him,
And, mother, now I'll go to sleep."  Alas! poor little Jim!

She knew that he was dying; that the child she loved

He felt that all was over, he knew his child was dead,
He took the candle in his hand, and walked toward the bed;
His quivering lips gave token of the grief he'd fain conceal,
And see, his wife has joined him-the stricken couple kneel;
With hearts bowed down by sadness, they humbly ask
of Him

Poor little untaught feet!
Into what dreary mazes will they wander,
What dangers will they meet?
Will they go stumbling blindly in the darkness
Of sorrow's tearful shades?
Or find the upland slopes of peace and beauty,
Whose sunlight never fades?
Will they go toiling up ambition's summit,
The common world above?
Or, in some nameless vale securely sheltered,
Walk side by side with love?
Some feet there be which walk life's track unwounded,
Which find but pleasant ways;
Some hearts there be to which this life is only
A round of happy days.
But they are few. Far more there are who wander
Without a hope or friend--
Who find their journey full of pain and losses.
And long to reach the end.
How shall it be with her, the tender stranger,
Fair-faced and gentle-eyed,
Before whose unstained feet the world's rude highway
Stretches so strange and wide?
Ah! who may read the future? For our darling
We crave all blessings sweetAnd pray that He who feeds the crying ravens,
Will guide the baby feet.

XLVII.--NIGHT.
O, THE night, the nignt, the beautiful night,
With its crown of stars and its robes of light,
Falling, floating around,
A witching wonder of beauty it weaves,
Drooping so bright through the quivering leaves,
Which softly shade the ground.
0, the night, the night, the beautiful night,
Crowning with a blaze of glory each height,
Then brightly shimmering down,
Like silvery streams in the trembling shade
Of the lonely glen and darksome glade,
Over the earth so brown.
0, the night, the night, the beautiful night,
Flooding the world with a glory so bright,
Blazing and flashing down,
Tipping each wave with a silvery beam,
Till the billows all set with diamonds seem,
As in wild glee they bound.
O, the night, the night, the beautiful night,
When, wandering in mystic flight,
The spirit wings its way
Sad as the cry of the night-bird alone,
When above the shriek of the storm-god's moan,
Is heard the plaintive lay.
0, the night, the night, the beautiful night,
It fills the soul with the wildest delight,
While o'er the heart-strings sweep
Memories, as the murmurings low
Of the breeze when playing to and fro,
Over the restless deep.

XLVIII.-LINES ON A SKELETON.
SCME years ago, the "London Morning Chronicle" published the
following poenl, which excited much attention. Every effort was
vainly made to discover the author. All that ever transpired was,
that the poem, in a fair, clerkly hand, was found near a skeleton
of remarkable beauty of form and color in the Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons, and that the curator of the Museum had sent
them to Mr. Terry, editor of the " Chronicle."
BEHOLD this ruin!'t was a skull,
Once of ethereal spirit full;
This narrow cell was life's retreat;
This space was thought's mysterious seat;
What beauteous visions filled this Spot!
What dreams of pleasure-long forgot!
Nor Hope, nor Love, nor Joy, nor Fear,
Have left one trace of record here.
Beneath this moldering canopy
Once shone the bright and busy eye;
But start not at the dismal void:
If social love that eye employed,
If with no lawless fire it gleamed,
But through the dew of kindness beamed,
That eye shall be forever bright,
When stars and suns are sunk in night.
Within this hollow cavern hung
The ready, swift, and tuneful tongue;
If falsehood's honey it disdained,
And, where it could not praise, was chainled,
If cold in virtue's cause it spoke,
Yet gentle concord never brokeThis silent tongue shall plead for thee
When time unveils eternity.
Say-did these fingers delve the mine?
Or, with its envied rubies shine?
To hew the rock, or wear the gem,
Can little now avail to them!

Or comfort to the mourner brought,
These hands a richer meed shall claim

If from the bowers of ease they fled
To seek affliction's humble shed,
If grandeur's guilty pride they spurned,
And home to virtue's lot returnedThese feet with angel's wings shall vie,
And tread the palace of the sky.
XLIX.--SORROW      FOR   THE DEAD.
WASHINGTON IRVING.
WASHINGTON IRVING was born in the city of New York, April 3,
1783. By the death of his father, his education was left to the super.
intendence of his elder brothers. He began his literary career by
writing a series of letters for the " Morning Chronicle," of which one
of his brothers was editor. "The History of New York, by Diedrich
Knickerbocker," a humorous account of the settlement of New York,
did much for his reputation as a writer. In 1819 and 1820, "The
Sketch-Book," was published in New York and London, and met
with wonderful success.
Among his other writings are "Bracebridge Hall," "History of
the Life and Voyages of Columbus," "The Alhambra," and " Life of
Washington." He wrote most of the foregoing works while in Europe, where he received one of the gold medals provided by George
the Fourth for eminence in historical composition.
His style is characterized by ease, purity, and grace, and for distinct and delicate painting.
SORROW for the dead is the only sorrow from which we
refuse to be divorced. Every other wound we seek to heal;
every other affliction to forget; but this wound we consider
it a duty to' keep open: this affliction we cherish, and brood
over in solitude.
Where is the mother that would willingly forget the infant
that perished like a blossom from her arms, though every
recollection is a pang? Where is the child that would willingly forget the most tender of parents, though to remember be but to lament? Who, even in the hour of agoily,
would forget the friend over whom he mourns? who, even
when the tomb is closing upon the remains of her most
loved, and he feels his heart, as it were, crushed in the
closing of its portal, would accept consolation that is
bought by forgetfulness?  No; the love which survives
the tomb is one of the noblest attributes of the soul. If
it has its woes, it has likewise its delights; and when the
overwhelming burst of grief is calmed into the gentle tear
of recollection--when the sudden anguish and the convulsive agony over the present ruins of all that we most loved
are softened away into pensive meditation on all that it
was in the days of its loveliness, who would root out such
a sorrow from the heart?
Though it may sometimes throw a passing cloud even
over the bright hour of gayety, or spread a deeper sadness
over the hour of gloom, yet who would exchange it even
for the song of pleasure, or the burst of revelry? No;
there is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song: there is
a recollection of the dead to which we turn even from the
charms of the living. Oh, the grave! the grave! It buries
every error, covers every defect, extinguishes every resentment. From its peaceful bosom spring none but fond regrets and tender recollections.
L. - CHRISTMAS.
WASHINGTON IRVING.
TItERE is something in the very season of the year that
gives a charm to the festivity of Christmas.
At other times we derive a great portion of our pleasures
from the mere beauties of nature. Our feelings sally forth
and dissipate themselves over the sunny landscape, and
"we live abroad and every-where." The song of the bird,
the murmer of the stream, the breathing fragrance of spring,
the soft voluptuousness of summer, the golden pomp of

you have discovered, and also what the author says." If
you are successful in this-and you can not fail to be, if
you have a faculty for teaching children-you will awaken
-a spirit of observation and of inquiry in the minds of your
pupils which, if followed up, will lead to happy results. The
great difficulty of getting pupils to read naturally, will also
be diminished by this prefatory description of the picture.
Naturalness.-Naturalness in reading would be a very
easy thing to be accomplished, if children were never improperly taught, and if they could pass from the playground
to the school-room without any unnatural restraint being
thrown around them.
To prevent fize formlzatiolz of an unnatural manner, never
allow pupils to read what they do not understand. Get
them to feel that what they read is similar to what they
talk-that reading is only somebody else talking through
them.
To break z~ an unnatural manner, when formed, study
carefully the preceding directions and suggestions, and
apply them intelligently in your teaching. Extra care and
attention is all that will be found essential to accomplish
the desired result.
Printing and Writing.-In the directions given for
studying Exercise I, reference was made to printing as a
valuable exercise. Nor can there be found a better time to
have your pupils begin writing script than in the primary
grade. They will learn to write almost as readily as they
will learn to print;.and the change from the one to the
other, in the preparation of different lessons, will afford
them pleasant variety.
It would be well to have a specified time each day for a
writing exercise, when you can teach them how to hold the
pencil and how to form the letters.'One or two letters
will be enough at a lesson. Primary pupils need not have
copy-books and pens; let them write on their slates; and
for this purpose, they should be provided with lQng,pencils,
which they may be taught to hold as they would hold

cence, all fill us with mute but exquisite delight, and we
revel in the luxury of mere sensation.
But in the depth of winter, when nature lies despoiled of
every charm, and wrapped in her shroud of sheeted snow,
we turn for our gratifications to moral sources. The dreariness and desolation of the landscape, the short, gloomy
days and darksome nights, while they circumscribe our
wanderings, shut in our feelings also from rambling abroad,
and make us more keenly disposed for the pleasure of the
social circle.  Our thoughts are more concentrated; our
friendly sympathies more aroused. We feel more sensibly
the charm of each other's society, and are brought more
closely together by dependence on each other for enjoyment. Heart calleth unto heart, and we draw our pleasures
from the deep wells of loving-kindness which lie in the
quiet recesses of our bosoms; and which, when resorted to,
furnish forth the pure element of domestic felicity.
The pitchy gloom without makes the heart dilate on entering the room filled with the glow and warnith of the evening fire. The ruddy blaze diffuses an artificial summer and
sunshine through the room, and lights up each countenance
in a kindlier welcome. Where does the honest face of hospitality expand into a broader and more cordial smilewhere is the shy glance of love more sweetly eloquent than
by the winter fire-side? And as the hollow blast of wintry
wind rushes through the hall, claps the distant door, whistles
about the casement, and rumbles down the chimney, what
can be more grateful than that feeling of sober and sheltered security with which we look around upon the comfortable chamber and the scene of domestic hilarity?
LI.-BROKEN HEARTS.
WASHINGTON IRVING.
MAN is the creature of interest and ambition. His nature
leads him forth into the struggle and bustle of the world.
Love is but the embellishment of his early life, or a song
piped in the intervals of the acts. He seeks for fame, for
256SELECTIONS.
fortune, for space in the world's thought, and dominion
over his fellow-men. But a woman's whole life is a history
of the affections.  The heart is her world: it is there hei
ambition strives for empire; it is there her avarice seeks for
hidden treasures.  She sends forth her sympathies on adventure: she embarks her whole soul in the traffic of affection:
and if shipwrecked, her case is hopeless, for it is a bankruptcy of the heart.
To a man, the disappointment of love may occasion some
bitter pangs; it wounds some feelings of tenderness-it
blasts some prospects of felicity: but he is an active being;
he may dissipate his thoughts in the whirl of varied occupation, or may plunge into the tide of pleasure: or, if the
scene of disappointment be too full of painful associations,
he can shift his abode at will, and taking, as it were, the
wings of the morning, can "fly to the uttermost part of the
earth, and be at rest."
But woman's is comparatively a fixed, a secluded, and a
meditative life.  She is more the companion of her own
thoughts and feelings; and if they are turned to ministers
of sorrow, where shall she look for consolation?  Her lot
is to be wooed and won; and if unhappy in her love, her
heart is like some fortress that has been captured, and
sacked, and abandoned, and left desolate.
How many bright eyes grow dim--how many soft cheeks
grow pale-how many lovely forms fade away into the
tomb, and none can tell the cause that blighted their loveliness! As the dove will clasp its wings to its side, and
cover and conceal the arrow that is preying on its vitals, so
it is the nature of woman to hide from the world the pangs
of wounded affection.
The love of a delicate female is always shy and silent.
Even when fortunate, she scarcely breathes it to herself;
but when otherwise, she buries it in the recesses of her
bosom, and there lets it cower and brood among the ruins
of her peace.  With her the desire of the heart has failed.
The great charm  of existence is at an end.  She neglects
all the cheerful exercises which gladden the spirits, quicken
the pulses, and send the tide of life in healthful currents

through the veins. Her rest is broken; the sweet refreshment of sleep is poisoned by melancholy dreams; "dry
sorrow drinks her blood," until her enfeebled frame sinks
under the slightest external injury.
Look for her, after a little while, and you will find
friendship weeping over her untimely grave, and wondering that one who but lately glowed with all the radiance
of health and beauty should so speedily be brought down
to "darkness and the worm." You will be told of some
wintry chill, some casual indisposition that laid her low;
but no one knows of the mental malady that previously
sapped her strength, and made her so easy a prey to the
spoiler.
She is like some tender tree, the pride and beauty of the
grove; graceful in its form, bright in its foliage, but with
the worm preying at its heart. We find it suddenly withering when it should be most fresh and luxuriant. We see
it drooping its branches to the earth, and shedding leaf by
leaf, until, wasted and perished away, it falls even in the
stillness of the forest; and as we muse over the beautiful
ruin, we strive in vain to recollect the blast or thunderbolt
that could have smitten it with decay.
LII.-RURAL LIFE IN ENGLAND.
WASHINGTON IRVING.
IN rural life, there is nothing mean and debasing. It
leads a man forth among scenes of natural grandeur and
beauty; it leaves him to the workings of his mind, operated
upon by the purest and most elevating of external influences. Such a man may be simple and rough, but he can
not be vulgar. The man of refinement, therefore, finds
nothing revolting in an intercourse with the lower orders
in rural life, as he does when he casually mingles with the,ower orders of cities. He lays aside his distance and reserve, and is glad to waive the distinctions of rank, and to
enter into the honest, heartfelt enjoyments of common life.

LIII.-ROSCOE.
WASHINGTON IRVING.
As I was visiting the Athenaeum, of Liverpool, my attention was attracted to a person just entering the room. He
was advanced in life, tall, and of a form that might once
have been commanding; but it was a little bowed by time,
perhaps by care. He had a noble Roman style of countenance; a head that would have pleased a painter; and, though
some slight furrows on his brow showed that wasting thought
had been busy there, yet his eye still beamed with the fire
of a poetic soul. There was something in the whole appearance that indicated a being of a different order from
the bustling race around him.
I inquired his name, and found that it was Roscoe. I

mingling among the busy sons of traffic, at first shocked my
poetic ideas; but it is from the very circumstances and situation in which he has been placed, that Mr. Roscoe derives his highest claims to admiration.  It is interesting to
notice how some minds seem almost to create themselves,
springing up under every disadvantage, and working their
solitary but irresistible way through a thousand obstacles.
Nature seems to delight in disappointing the assiduities of
art, with which it would rear legitimate dullness to maturity,
and to glory in the vigor and luxuriance of her chance productions. She scatters the seeds of genius to the winds,
and, though some may perish by the stony places of'the
world, and some be choked by the thorns and brambles
of early adversity, yet others will now and then strike root
even in the clefts of the rock, struggle bravely up into sunshine, and spread over their sterile birthplace all the beatiuties of vegetation.
Such has been the case with Mr. Roscoe. Born in a,place apparently uncongenial to the growth of literary talent; in the very market-place of trade; without fortune,
family connections, or patronage; self-prompted, self-sustained, and almost self-taught, he has conquered every
obstacle, achieved his way to eminence, and become one
of the ornaments to the nation.
LIV.-COUNTRY THRIFT.
WASHINGTON IRVING.
OLD BALTUS VAN TASSEL was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer.  He seldom, it is
true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those, every thing was
snug, happy, and well-conditioned.  He was satisfied with
his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon
the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he
lived.
His stronghold was situated on the bank of the Hudson,
in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the

Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm-tree
spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little
well, formed of a barrel, and then stole sparkling away,
through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that bubbled
along among alders and dwarf-willows.
Hard by the farm-house was a vast barn, that might have
served for a church, every window and crevice of which
seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm. The
flail was busily resounding within it from morning till night;
swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves;
and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if
watching the weather, some with their heads under their
wings, or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and
cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the
sunshine on the roof. Sleek, unwieldly porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, whence
sallied forth, now and then, troops of pigs, as if to snuff
the air.I NSI'ITUTE READER.
A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an
adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments
of turkeys were gobbling through the farm-yard, and
guinea-fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives,
with their peevish discontented cry. Before the barn-door
strutted the gallant cock, that fine pattern of a husband, a
warrior, and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings,
and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart-sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously
calling on his ever-hungry family of wives and children to
enjoy the rich morsel he had discovered.
The hungry mind might picture to itself every roastingpig running about with an apple in its mouth; the pigeons
snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked in with
a coverlet of crust; the geese swimming in their own gravy;
and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes, like snug married
couples, with a decent competency of sauce. In the porkers might be carved out the future sleek side of bacon and
juicy relishing ham; each turkey daintily trussed up, with
its gizzard under its wings, and, peradventure, a necklace
of savory sausages; and even the bright chanticleer himself sprawling on his back, in a side dish, with uplifted
claws, as if craving that quarter which his chivalrous spirit
disdained to ask while living.
The house was one of those spacious farm-houses, with
high-ridged, but lowly-sloping roofs, built in the style
handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of
being closed up in bad weather; under this were hung
flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for
fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built along
the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at
one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses
to which this important porch might be devoted. From
this piazza the hall is entered, which forms the center of
the mansion and the place of usual residence. Here, rows
of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzle the
eye. In one corner stands a huge bag of wool ready to be
spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the

mantle-piece; strings of various colored birds' eggs are suspended above it; a great ostrich egg is hung from the center
of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open,
displays immense treasures of old silver and well-mended
china.
LV.-THE RIGHT OF CIVILIZED NATIONS OVER
SAVAGE S.
WASHINGTON IRVING.
IT is notorious, that savages knew nothing of agriculture,
when first discovered by Europeans, but lived a most vagabond, disorderly, unrighteous life; rambling from place to
place, and prodigally rioting upon the spontaneous luxuries
of nature, without tasking her generosity to yield them anly
thing more; whereas it has been most unquestionably shown
that Heaven intended the earth should be plowed, and
sown, and manured, and laid out into cities, and towns,
and farms, and country seats, and pleasure grounds, and
public gardens, all which the Indians knew nothing about;
therefore, they did not improve the talents Providence had
bestowed on them-therefore, they were careless stewardstherefore, they had no right to the soil-therefore, they
deserved to be exterminated.
It is true, the savages might plead that they drew all the
benefits from the land which their simple wants requiredthey found plenty of game to hunt, which, together with
the roots and uncultivated fruits of the earth, furnished a
sufficient variety for their frugal repasts; and that, as Heaven
merely designed the earth to form the abode, and satisfy
the wants of man, so.long as those purposes were answered,
the will of Heaven was accomplished. But this only proves
263INSTITUTE READER.
how undeserving they were of the blessings around themthey were so much the more savages for not having more
wants; for knowledge is in some degree an increase of
desires, and it is this superiority both in the number and
magnitude of his desires, that distinguishes the man from the
beast. Therefore, the Indians, in not having more wants,
were very unreasonable animals; and it was but just that
they should make way for the Europeans, who had a thousand wants to their one, and, therefore, would turn the
earth to more account, and, by cultivating it, more truly
fulfill the will of Heaven.
But a more irresistible right, and one which will be the
most readily admitted by my reader, provided he be blessed
with bowels of charity and philanthropy, is the right acquired by civilization. All the world knows the lamentable
state in which these poor savages were found, not only deficient in the comforts of life, but what is still worse, most piteously and unfortunately blind to the miseries of their situation.
But no sooner did the benevolent inhabitants of Europe
behold their sad condition, than they immediately went to
work to ameliorate and improve it.
They introduced among them rum, gin, brandy, and the
other comforts of life--and it is astonishing to read how
soon the poor savages learned to estimate those blessings;
they likewise made known to them a thousand remedies, by
which the most inveterate diseases are alleviated and healed;
and that they might comprehend the benefits and enjoy the
comforts of these medicines, they previously introduced
among them the diseases which they were calculated to
cure. By these and a variety of other methods was the
condition of the poor savages wonderfully improved; they
acquired a thousand wants of which they had before been
ignorant; and as he has most sources of happiness who has
most wants to be gratified, they were doubtlessly rendered
a much happier race of beings.
Thus were the European worthies who first discovered
America clearly entitled to the soil; and not only entitled
to the soil, but also to the eternal thanks of these infidel
savages, for having come so far, endured so many perils by.264SELECT'IOVS.
sea and land, and taken such unwearied pains, for no other
purpose but to improve their forlorn, uncivilized, and
heathenish condition; for having made them acquainted
with the comforts of life; for having introduced among
them the light of religion, and finally-for having hurried
them out of the world, to enjoy its reward!

these means, had arrived at such a command of their energies, such an enviable state of perfectibi.ity, as to control
the elements, and navigate the boundless regions of space.
Let us suppose a roving crew of these soaring philosophers,
in the course of an aerial voyage of discovery among the

Let us suppose that the aerial visitants I have mentioned,
possessed of vastly superior knowledge in the art of extermination-riding on hippogriffs-defended with impenetrable
armor-armed with concentrated sunbeams, and provided
with vast engines to hurl enormous moon-stones; in short,

power, as the Europeans were to the Indians, when the),
first discovered them.

inhabited by us poor savages and wild beasts, shall take

In both printing and writing, insist upon neatness of execution. Examine the slate of each one, at the recitation, to
see how well the work has been done; commend the careful; rebuke the careless; encourage the diffident; and give
to each such directions as he needs.
Spelling.-This subject has already been alluded to;
but it is a matter of too much importance to be passed
without a more exteided notice.
In the books, you use, you will find words arranged for
spelling exercises. Do not confine yourself to these alone;
the entire reading. lesson should be regarded as a spelling lesson; and the pupils should be made to understand
that they may be called upon to spell every word in it.
Review the preceding lessons, also, as often as you have
time.
Require the pupil to pronounce the word after you, before he begins to spell; and in words of more than one
syllable, insist upon the pronunciation of each syllable as
the word is spelled. The words and syllables should be
pronounced distinctly, that articulation as well as orthography may be improved.
Conducting a Recitation.-The necessity of life and
animation has already been spoken of, also of exactness and
thoroughness. There is one other thing which ought to be
mentioned-Attention. To so great a degree does carelessness prevail, that pupils have frequently to be told which
verse to read. The teacher may not always be to blame for
this; but too often it is the result of mismanagement in
conducting the recitation. If the pupils are not all paying
close attention while one is reading, something is wrong,
and ought to be corrected.

way is to have no fixed order, but to call on the class promiscuously. Thus you may compel the attention. of each

Trhen, making such obeisance as the etiquette of the court
requires, they shall address the puissant man in the moon,
in, as near as I can conjecture, the following manner:
" Most serene and mighty Potentate, whose dominions
extend as far as eye can reach, who rideth on the Great
Bear, useth the sun as a looking-glass, and maintaineth unrivaled cQntrol over tides, madmen, and sea-crabs!
"We, thy liege subjects, have returned from a voyage of
discovery, in the course of which we have landed and taken
possession of that obscure, little, dirty planet which thou
beholdest rolling at a distance. The five uncouth monsters,
which we have brought into this august presence, were once
very important chiefs among their fellow savages, who are a
race of beings totally destitute of the common attributes of
humanity; and differing in every thing from the inhabitants
of the moon, inasmuch as they carry their heads upon their
shoulders, instead of under their arms--have two eyes instead of one-are utterly destitute of tails, and of a variety
of unseemly complexions, particularly of horrible whiteness,
instead of pea-green.
"We have, moreover, found these miserable savages sunk

philosophers of the moon. In a word, they have scarcely
a gleam of true philosophy among them, but are, in fact,
utter heretics, ignoramuses, and barbarians.'Taking compassion, therefore, on the sad condition of these sublunary
wretches, we have endeavored, while we remained on their

endeavored to instill into them the precepts of lunar phi-.losophy. We have insisted upon their renouncing the contemptible shackles of religion and common sense, and
adoring the profound, omnipotent, and all-perfect energy,
and the ecstatic, immutable, immovable perfectioni.  But
such was the unparalleled obstinacy of these wretched savages, that they persisted in cleaving to their wives, and
adhering to their religion, and absolutely set at naught the
sublime doctrines of the moon-nay, among other abominable heresies, they even went so far as blasphemously to
declare, that this ineffable planet was made of nothing more
nor less than green cheese!"
At these words, the great man in the moon, being a profound philosopher, shall fall into a terrible passion, and
shall forthwith issue the following edict, specifying, "That,
whereas, a certain crew of Lunatics have lately discovered,
and taken possession of a newly-discovered planet called the
earth--and that whereas, it is inhabited by none but a race
of two-legged animals that carry their heads on their shoulders, instead of under their arms; can not talk the Lunatic
language; have two eyes, instead of one; are destitute of
tails, and of a horrible whiteness, instead of pea-green--
therefore, and for a variety of other excellent reasons, they
are considered incapable of possessing any property in the
planet they infest, and the right and title to it are confirmed
to its original discoverers. And, furthermore, the colonists,
who are now about to depart to the aforesaid planet, are
authorized and commanded to use every means to convert
these infidel savages from the darkness of Christianity, and
make them thorough and absolute lunatics."

LIX.-THE    SONG OF THE SHIRT.
THOMAS HOOD.
THOMAS HOOD, an English humorist and poet, was born at London,
1798, and died, 1845.
Like many great authors, he began his life as a newspaper writer.
Though many of his poems are among the finest specimens of pathos
to be found in the language, he is best known as a humorist and w: t.
It will add to the interest of the following beautiful poems, "Tlhe
Song of the Shirt," and " The Bridge of Sighs," to know that they were
composed in his anxiety to provide for his wife and children, while the
author was confined to a sick-bed, from which he never rose.
WITH fingers weary and worn,
With eyelids heavy and red,
A woman sat in unwomanly rags,
Plying her needle and thread--

LXII.-THE TEACHER, THE IOPE OF AMERICA.
LOOK abroad over this country; mark her extent, her
wealth, her fertility, her boundless resources, the great energies which every day she develops, and which she seems already bending for that fatal race-tempting, yet always fatal
to republics-the race for physical greatness and aggrandizement. Behold, too, that continuous and mighty tide
of population, native and foreign, which is forever rushing
through this great valley toward the setting sun; sweeping
away the wilderness before it like the grass before the
mower; waking up industry and civilization in its progress;
studding the solitary rivers of the West *with marts and
cities; dotting its boundless prairies with human habitations; penetrating every green nook and vale; climbing
every fertile ridge; and still gathering and pouring onward,
to form new states in those vast and yet unpeopled solitudes,
where the Oregon rolls his majestic flood and "hears no
sound save his own dashing."
Mark all this, and then say: By what bonds will you hold
together so mighty a people, and so immense an empire?
What safeguard will you give us against the dangers which
must inevitably grow out of so vast and complicate an organization? In the swelling tide of prosperity, what a field will
open for political corruption! What a world of evil passions
to control, and jarring interests to reconcile! What temptations will there be to luxury and extravagance! What
motives to private and official cupidity! What prizes will

hang glitterinlg at a thousand goals, to dazzle and tempt
ambition!
Do we expect to find our security against these dangers in
railroads and canals, or in our ships of war? Alas! when
shall we learn wisdom from the lesson of history? Our
most dangerous enemies will grow up from our own
bosom.
We may erect bulwarks against foreign invasion; but
what power shall we find in walls and armies to protect the
people against themselves? There is but one sort of "internal improvement "- more thoroughly internal than that
which is cried up by politicians--that is able to save this
country. I mean the improvement of the minds and soels
of the people. If this improvement shall be neglected, and
fail to keep pace with the increase of our population and
our physical advancement, one of two alternatives is certain;
either the nation must dissolve in anarchy under the rulers
of its own choice, or, if held together at all, it must be by
a government so strong and rigorous as to be utterly inconsistent with constitutional liberty.
Let the one hundred millions which, at no very distant
day, will swarm our cities, and fill up our great interior,
remain sunk in ignorance, and nothing short of an iron
despotism will suffice to govern the nation, to reconcile its
vast and conflicting interests, control its elements of agitation, and hold back its fiery and headlong energies from
dismemberment and ruin.
How, then, is this improvement to be effected? Who are
the agents of it? Who are they who shall stand as priests at
the altar of freedom, and feed its sacred fires, by dispensing
that knowledge and cultivation on which hangs our political
salvation? I repeal; the)' are our teachers, the masters of our
schools, the instructors in our academies and colleges, and in
all those institutions of whatever name, which have for their
object the intellectual and moral culture of our youth, and
the diffuson of knowledge among our people. Theirs is the
moral dignity of stamping the great features of our national
character; and, in the moral worth and intelligence which
they give it, to erect a bulwark which shall prove impregnable

to develop a taste for literary labor. Before the age of twenty-one he

Once, I used to say you were the best creature living; now,

if once in your life a button's off your shirt--what do you
say "'ah" at?  I say once, Mr. Caudle; or twice or three

world are better looked after than yours. I only wish I'd
kept the shirts you had when you were first married! I
should like to know where were your buttons thern?
Yes, it is worth talking of! But that's how you always
try to put me down. You fly into a rage, and then, if I
only try to speak, you won't hear me. That's how you men
always will have all the talk to yourselves; a poor woman
isn't allowed to get a word in. A nice notion you have of
a wife, to suppose she's nothing to think of but her husband's buttons. A pretty notion, indeed, you have of marriage. Ha! if poor women only knew what they had to go
through! What with buttons, and one thing and another!
they'd never tie themselves up to the best man in the
world, I'm sure. What would they do, Mr. Caudle?--Why,'do much better without you, I'm certain.
And it's my belief, after all, that the button wasn't off
the shirt; it's my belief that you pulled it off, that you
might have something to talk about. 0, you're aggravating enough, when you like, for any thing! All I know is,
it's very odd that it should be off the shirt; for I'm sure
no woman's a greater slave to her husband's buttons than I
am. I only say it's very odd.
However, there's one comfort; it can't last long. I'm
worn to death with your temper, and sha' n't trouble you a

would laugh! I've no doubt of it! That's your love;

Skims round the purple peaks remote.
Round purple peaks it sails and seeks

Where high rocks throw, through deeps below,
A duplicated golden glow.
Far, vague, and dim the mountains swim;
While on Vesuvius' misty brim,
With outstretched hands, the gray smoke sta.nis,
O'erlooking the volcanic lands.
Here Ischia smiles o'er liquid miles,
And yonder, bluest of the isles,
Calm Capri waits, her sapphire gates
Beguiling to her bright estates.

Float swift or slow from cliff to cliff;
With dreamful eyes my spirit lies

Where summer sings and never dies--
O'erveiled with vines, she grows and shines

Laugh on the rock like waterfalls.

Unto the smooth, bright sand beguiled,
With glowing lips sings as she skips,
Or gazes at the far-off ships.
Yon deep bark goes where traffic blows,
From lands of sun to lands of snows;
This happier one its course has run,
From lands of snow to lands of sun.
Oh! happy ship, to rise and dip,
With the blue crystal at your lip!
Oh! happy crew, my heart's with you,
And sails, and sails, and sings anew!
No more, no more the worldly shore
Upbraids me witih its loud uproar!

LXV.-OMNIPRESENCE AND OMNISCIENCE OF TBIE
DEIT Y.
ADDISON.
JOSEPH ADDISON, one of the brightest namnes in English literature,
was born in Wiltshire, May, 1672.
Though a poet of reputation, he excels as a prose writer, in which
he has long been regarded as a model. In 1709, " The Tattler," a1l English periodical, was started by Steele, with whom Addison was associated. But it is chiefly on " The Spectator," a periodical establislhed in
1711, by Addisoln, that his reputation as a writer depends. The plan is
founded on the fiction of a club that assembled every Tuesday anld
Thursday to carry on the publication. Thiough malny of the first writers of that day were contributors to it, its essays most valuable for
humor, invention, and precept are the product of Addison's pen. It
soon became the most popular periodical England had produced.
The death-bed of Addison was a triumph of religion and truth, the
exemplification of the great principles of his life. H aving an amiable,
but dissipated son-in-law, Lord Warwick, whoin he desired to reclaim,
he sent for him. WVhen lie came he had just strength to say, " See in
what peace a Christian can die," and expired. He died, June, 1719.
I WAS yesterday, about sunset, walking in the open fields,
until the night insensibly fell upon me. I at first amused
myself with all the richness and variety of colors which appeared in the western parts of heaven; in proportion as they
faded away and went out, several stars and planets appeared
one after another, until the whole firmament was in a glow.
The blueness of the ether was exceedingly heightened and
enlivened by the season of the year, and by the rays of all
those luminaries that passed through it. The galaxy appeared in its most beautiful white. To complete the scene,
the full moon rose at length in that clouded majesty which
Milton takes notice of, and opened to the eye a new picture
of nature, which was more finely shaded and disposed
among softer lights,than that which the sun had before discovered to us.
As I was surveying the moon walking in her brightness,
and taking her progress among the constellations, a thought
arose in me which I helieve very often perplexes and disturbs men of serious and contemplative natures.  David himself fell into it in that reflection, "WVhen I consider the
heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars
which thou hast ordained; what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou regardest him?"
284SELECTIONS.
In the same manner, when I consider that infinite host
)f stars, or, to speak more philosophically, of suns, which
were then shining upon me, with those innumerable sets of
planets or worlds which were moving round their respective
suns; when I still enlarged the idea, and supposed another
heaven of suns and worlds rising still above this which we
discovered, and these still enlightened by a superior firmament of luminaries, which are planted at so great a distance
that they may appear to the inhabitants of the former as the
stars do to us; in short, while I pursued this thought, I
could not but reflect on that little, insignificant figure which
I myself bore amidst the immensity of God's works.
If we consider God in his omnipresence, his being passes
through, actuates, and supports the whole frame of nature.
His creation, and every part of it, is full of him. There is
nothing he has made that is either so distant, so little, or so
inconsiderable, which he does not essentially inhabit. His
substance is within the substance of every being, whether
material or immaterial, and as intimately present to it as
that being is to itself. It would be an imperfection in him
were he able to remove out of one place into another, or to

considered the creation as the temple of God, which he has

of tile Godhead. Brutes and men have their sensoriola, or
little sensoriums, by which they apprehend the presence and
perceive the actions of a few objects that lie contiguous to
them. Their knowledge and observation turn within a very
narrow circle. But as God Almiglity can not but perceive
and know every thing in which he resides, infinite space
gives room to infinite knowledge, and is, as it were, an
organ to omniscience.
Were the soul separate from the body, and with one
glance of thought should start beyond the bounds of the
creation; should it for millions of years continue its progress through infinite space with the same activity, it would
still find itself within the embrace of its Creator, and encompassed round with the immensity of the Godhead. Whilst
we are in the body, he is not less present witli us because
he-is concealed from us.  "0O that I knew where I might
find him!" says Job. "Behold I go forward, but he is not
there; and backward, but I can not perceive him; on the
left hand, where he does work, but I can not behold him;
he hideth himself on the right hand that I can not see
him."  In short, reason as well as revelation assures us that
he can not be absent from us, notwithstanding he is undis
covered by us.
In this consideration of God Almighty's omnipresence
and omniscience, every uncomfortable thought vanishes.
He can not but regard every thing that has being, especially
such of his creatures who fear they are not regarded by
him. He is privy to all their thoughts, and to that anxiety
of heart in particular, which is apt to trouble them on this
occasion; for, as it is impossible he should overlook any of
his creatures, so we may be confident that he regards witli
an eye of mercy those who endeavor to recommend them~selves to his notice, and, in an unfeigned humility of heart,
think themselves unworthy that he should be mindful of
them.

I HAVE, upon miy chamber-walls, drawn at full length, the
figures of all sorts of men, from eight feet to tnree feet two
inches. Within this height, I take it that all the fighting
men of Great Britain are comprehended. But, as I push, I
make allowances for my being of a lank and spare body,
and have chalked out in every figure my own dimensions;
for I scorn to rob any man of his life by taking advantage
of his breadth: therefore, I press purely in a line down from
his nose, and take no more of him to assault than he has of
me; for, to speak impartially, if a lean fellow wound a fat
one in any part of the right or left, whether it be in carte
or in tierce, beyond the dimensions of the said lean fellow's
own breadth, I take it to be murder, and such a murder as
is below a gentleman to commit.
As I am spare, I am also very tall, and behave myself
with relation to that advantage with the same punctilio; and
I am ready to stoop or stand, according to the stature of my

LXVIII.-THE MAKING OF MAN.
SWINBURNE.
BEFORE the beginning of years
There came to the making of man
Time, with a gift of tears;
Grief, with a glass that ran;
Pleasure, with pain for leaven;
Summer, with flowers that fell;
Remembrance, fallen from heaven,
And madness, risen from hell;
Strength, without hands to smite;
Love, that endures for a breath;
Night, the shadow of light,
And life, the shadow of death.
And the high gods took in hand
Fire, and the falling of tears,
And a measure of sliding sand
From under the feet of the years;
And froth and drift of the sea;
And dust of the laboring earth;
And bodies of things to be
In the houses of death and of birth;
And wrought with weeping and laughter,
And fashioned with loathing and love,
With life before and after,
And death beneath and above,
For a day and a night and a morrow,
That his strength might endure for a span,
With travail and heavy sorrow,
The holy spirit of man.
From the winds of the north and the south
They gathered as unto strife;
They breathed upon his. mouth,
They filled his body with life;
Eyesight and speech they wu-ought
For the veils of the soul therein,

With his lips he travaileth;
In his heart is a blind desire,
In his eyes foreknowledge of death;

Between a sleep and a sleep.

JOB, XXXVIII.
" THE book of Job teaches sublime lessons on the moral government
of God, his greatness, his sovereignty over all things, and his incomprehensible wisdom; and gives us an illustrious pattern of solid and
fixed piety, and entire resignation to the divine will. And whether
the importance and dignity of the subjects, the profound sentiments,
the beauty of the language, or the picture of virtuous manners it sets
forth be our study, we shall find it worthy-of our greatest veneration
and investigation."
THEN the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind,
and said,

By words without knowledge?
Gird up now thy loins like a man;
For I will demiand of thee, and answer thou me.

On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
To satisfy the desolate and waste ground;

NATIHANIEL PARKER WILLIS, an American writer, was born in
Portland, Maine, 1807. He graduated with honor at Yale in 1827, and
while at college achieved some distinction as a poet.
After graduating, he traveled several years in Europe, writing for
both English and.American periodicals.
The following extract from a poem founded on G6nesis xxi will
afford an illustration of his delineations of Scripture scenes, in which
he especially excelled.
THE morning broke. Light stole upon the clouds
With a strange beauty. Earth received again
Its garments of a thousand dyes; and leaves,
And delicate blossoms, and the painted flowers,
And every thing that bendeth to the dew,
And stirreth with the daylight, lifted up
Its beauty to the breath of that sweet morn
All things are dark to sorrow; and the light
And loveliness, and fragrant air were sad
To the dejected Hagar. The moist earth
Was pouring odors from its spicy pores,

And the young birds were singing as if life
Were a new thing to them; but music came
Upon her ear like discord, and she felt
That pang of the unreasonable heart.
That, bleeding amid things it loved so well,
Would have some sign of sadness as they pass.
She stood at Abraham's tent. Her lips were pressed
Till the blood started; and the wandering veins
Of her transparent forehead were swelled out,
As if her pride would burst them. Her dark eye
Was clear and tearless, and the light of heaven,
Which made its language legible, shot back,
From her long lashes, as it had been flame.
Her noble boy stood by her, with his hand
Clasped in her own, and his round, delicate feet,
Scarce trained to balance on the tented floor,
Sandaled for journeying. He had looked up
Into his mother's face, until lie caught
The spirit there, and his young heart was swelling
Beneath his dimpled bosom, and his form
Straightened up proudly in his tiny wrath,
As if his light proportions would have swelled,
Had they but matched his spirit, to the man.
Why bends the patriarch as he cometh now
IJpon his staff so wearily? His beard
Is low upon his breast, and his high brow,
So written with the converse of his God,
Beareth the swollen vein of agony.
His lip is quivering, and his wonted step
Of vigor is not there; and, though the morn
Is passing fair and beautiful, he breathes
Its freshness as it were a pestilence.
He gave to her the water and the bread,
But spoke no word, and trusted not himself
To look upon her face, but laid his hand,
In silent blessing, on the fair-haired boy,
And left her to her lot, of loneliness.

LXXI.--DROWNED.
THERE is a smooth sand-beach in front of our house, a
small dock, and a boat-house. The railroad track is laid
between the bank an(d the beach, so that you can look out
of the car-windows and see the river, and the Palisades, the
sloops, the beach, and the boat-house.
One summer afternoon, as the train flew by the cottage
(for the station is beyond it a short walk), I observed quite
a concourse of people on one side of the track, on the dock,
and down by the water's edge. So, when the cars stopped,
I hurried back over the iron track I had just passed, and on
my way met a man who told me a little boy was (frowned in
the water in front of my house.
What a desperate race I ran that day with the image of
each of my children successively drowned, passing through
my mind with the rapidity of lightning flashes! When I got
in the crowd of people, I saw a poor woman lying lifeless in
the arms of two other women; some were bathing her forehead, some were chafing her hands; and just then I heard
some one say, "It is his mother, poor thing." How cruel it
was in me to whisper, "Thank God!" but could I help it?
To rush up the bank, to get the boat-house key, to throw
open the outside doors, and swing out the davits, was but
an instant's work; and then down went the boat from tle
blocks, and a volunteer crew had pushed her off in a moment.
Then they slowly rowed her down the river, close in shore,
for the tide was falling, and every now and then the iron
boat-hook sank under the water on its errand of mercy.
Meanwhile we lashed hooks to other poles; and along tlle
beach, and on the dock, a number of men were busy with
tlhem searching for the body. At last there was a subdued
shout-it came from the river, a little south of the boathouse-and the men dropped the poles on the dock, and on
the beach, and ran down that way, and we saw a little, white
object glisten in the arms of the boatmen, and tlien it was
laid tenderly, face downward, on the grass that grew on the
parapet of the railway.

Poor little fellow! He hadl been bathing on the lbeach,
and had ventured out beyond his depth in the river. It was
too late to recall that little spirit; the slender breath had
bubbled up through the water half an hour before. The women wrapped up the tiny, white death in a warm shawl, and
one stout fellow took it in his arms, and carried it' softly
along the iron road, followed by the concourse of people.
When I came up on the bank again, I thanked God, for the
group of small, sad faces I found there, partly for their safety,
partly for their sympathy. And we observed, that afternoon,
how quiet and orderly the young ones were, although the sun
went down in splendid clouds, and the river was flushed with
crimson, and the birds sang as they were wont to sing, and the
dogs sported across the grass, and all nature seemed to be unconsciously gay over the melancholy casualty; yet our little
ones were true to themselves and to humanity. They had

LXXIV.- OUR COUNTRY'S GREATEST GLORY.
WHIPPLE.
THE true glory of a nation is in an intelligent, honest,
industrious, Christian people. The civilization of a nation
depends on their individual character; a constitution which
is not the outgrowth of this is not worth the parchment on
which it is written. You look in vain in the past for a single
instance where the people have preserved their liberties after
their individual character was lost. The ruler represents the
people, and laws and institutions are the simple outgrowth
of domestic character. It is not in the magnificence of the
home of the ruler, not in the beautiful creations of art lavished on public edifices, not in costly cabinets of pictures or
public libraries, not ir proud monuments of achievements in
battle, not in the number or wealth of its cities, that we find
pledges of national glory.
The ruler may gather around his palace the treasures of
the world amid a brutalized people; the senate chamber
may retain its faultless proportions long after the voice of
patriotism is hushed within its walls; the marble may coinmemorate a glory which has forever daparted. Art and letters may bring no lesson to a people whose heart is dead;
the only glory of a nation is in the living temple of a loyal,
industrious, and upright people. The busy click of nlachinery, the merry ring of the anvil, the lowing of peaceful
herds, and the song of the harvest home, are sweeter music
than paeans of departed glory or songs of triumpli in war.
The vine-clad cottage of the hillside, the cabin of the

woodsman, and the rural home of the farmer ale the true
citadels of any country.
There is a dignity in honest toil which belongs not to the
display of wealth or the luxury of fashion. The man who
drives the plow, or swings his ax in the forest, or with cuinning fingers plies the tools of his craft, is as truly the servant
of his country, as the statesman in the senate or the soldier
in battle. The safety of a nation depends not on the wisdom of its statesmen or the bravery of its generals; the
tongue of eloquence never saved a nation tottering to its
fall; the sword of a warrior never stayed its destruction.
There is a surer defense in every Christian home. 1 say
Christian home, for I know of no glory to manhood which
comes not from the cross. I know of no rights wrung from
tyranny, no truth rescued from darkness and bigotry, which
has not waited on a Christian civilization.
Would you see the image of true glory, I would show you
villages where the crown and glory of the people were in purity of character, where the children were gathered in Christian schools, where the voice of prayer goes heavenward,
where the people have that most precious gift-faith in God.
With this as the basis, leavened as it will be with brotherly love, there will be no danger in grappling with any evils
which exist in our midst; we shall feel that we may work and
bide our time, and die knowing that God will bring the
victory.

That't is so frequent, this is stranger still.
Of man's miraculous mistakes, this bears
The palin, "that all men are about to live,"
Forever on the brink of being born;
All pay themselves the compliment to think
They one day shall not drivel, and their pride
On this reversion takes up ready praise;
At least their own: their future selves applaud;
How excellent that life they ne'er will lead!
Time lodged in their own hands is Folly's vails;
That lodged in Fate's, to wisdom they consign;
The thing they can't but purpose, they postpone.'T is not in folly not to scorn a fool,
And scarce in human wisdom to do more.
All promise is poor dilatory man,
And that through every stage. When young, indeed,
In full content we sometimes nobly rest,
Unanxious for ourselves; and only wish,
As duteous sons, our fathers were more wise.
At thirty man suspects himself a fool;
Knows it at forty, and reforms his plan;
At fifty chides his infamous delay,
Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve;
In all the magnanimity of thought,
Resolves, and re-resolves; then dies the same.
And why? Because he thinks himself immortal.
All men think all men mortal but themselves;
Themselves, when some alarming shock of fate
Strikes through their wounded hearts the sudden dread;
But their hearts wounded, like the wounded air,
Soon close; where, past the shaft, no trace is found,
As from the wing, no scar the sky retains,
The parted wave no furrow from the keel,
So dies in human hearts the thought of death;
E'en with the tender tear which nature sheds
O'er those we love, we d(rop it in their grave.

A moment, and then dying in a hush
Of silence, such as brooded o'er the earth
When earth was chaos.
The great mastodon,
The dreaded monster of the elder world,
Passed o'er this mighty cavern, and his tread
Bent the old forest oaks like fragile reeds,
And made earth tremble. Armies in their pride,
Perchance, have met above it in the shock
Of war, with shout, and groan, and clarion)last,
And the hoarse echoes of the thunder gun..
The storm, the whirlwind, and the hurricane
Have roared above it, and the bursting cloud
Sent down its red and crashing thunder-bolt.
Earthquakes have trampled o'er it in their wrath,
Rocking earth's surface as the storm-wind rocks
The old Atlantic; yet no sound of these
E'er came down to the everlasting depths
Of these dark solitudes.
How oft we gaze
With awe or admiration on the new
And unfamiliar, but pass coldly by
The lovelier and the mightier! Wonderful
Is this lone world of darkness and of gloom,
But far more wonderful yon outer world,
Lit by the glorious sun. These arches swell
Sublime in lone and dim magnificence.
But how sublimer God's blue canopy
Beleaguered with his burning cherubim,
Keeping their watch eternal!
Beautiful:
Are all the thousand snow-white gems that lie
In these mysterious chambers, gleaming out
Amid the melancholy gloom; and wild
These rocky hills, and cliffs, and gulfs; but far
More beautiful and wild the things that greet4INKSTITUTE READER.

All turning up their gentle eyes to heaven;
The birds, with bright wings glancing in the sun,
Filling the air with rainbow miniatures;
The green old forests, surging in the gale;
The everlasting mountains, on whose peaks
The setting sun burns like an altar flame;
And ocean, like a pure heart, rendering back

Heaving and tossing, like the stormy breast
Of a chained giant in-his agony.
LXXVIII.-T HANATOPSIS.
W. C. BRYANT.
WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT, an1 Arnericanl poet, was born ill Cunmmington, Massachusetts, November, 1794. While young, he gave indications of poetical genius, which was judiciously cultivated by his
father. After graduating at William's College, he practiced law for ten
years, but abandoned it for the more congenial field of letters. Many
of his poems were first published in the " Evening Post," of New York.
His poetry is American, abounding in life-like descriptionls of her forests, prairies, lakes, rivers, and mountains.
The following beautiful poem was written when he was only eighteen years old.
To him, who, in the love of nature, holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours,
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile,
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
Into his darker musings with a mild
And healing sympathy that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware.

When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall.
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;
Go forth under the open sky and list
To Nature's teachings, while, from all around,
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air,
Comes a still voice:
"Yet a few days, and thee,
The all-beholding sun shall see no more,
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean shall exist
Thy image. Earth, that noiurished thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again;
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go,
To mix forever with the elements,
To be a brother to the insensible rock,
And to the sluggish clod which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.
"Yet not, to thy eternal resting-place,
Shall thou retire, alone-nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world, with kings,
The powerful of the earth, the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulcher.

Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun; the vales,
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods; rivers that move
In majesty, and the complaining brooks
That make the meadow green; and, poured round all,

Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste,
Are but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
Through the still lapse of ages.
"All that tread
The globe, are but a handful, to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings
Of morning, and the Barcan desert pierce,
Or, lose thyself in the continuous woods,
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
Save his own dashings--yet the dead are there;
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep: the dead reign there alone.
"So shalt thou rest; and what, if thou shalt fall,
Unnoticed by the living, and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe

LXXIX.-GOD'S FIRST TEMPLES.
W. C. BRYANT.
THE groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned
To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave,
And spread the roof above them,-ere he framed
The lofty vault, to gather and roll back
The sound of anthems,-in the darkling wood,
Amid the cool and silence, he knelt down
And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks
And supplication.
For his simple heart
Might not resist the sacred influences,
That, from the stilly twilight of the place,
And from the gray old trunks, that, high in heaven,
Mingled their mossy boughs, and from the sound
Of the invisible breath, that swayed at once
All their green tops, stole over him, and bowed
His spirit with the thought of boundless power
And inaccessible majesty.
Ah! why
Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect
God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore
Only among the crowd, and under roofs
That our frail hands have raised? Let me, at least,
Here, in the shadow of this aged wood,
Offer one hymn; thrice happy, if it firnd
Acceptance in his ear.

LXXX.-THE BATTLE OF FORT CHRISTINA,
WASHINGTON IKVING.
EXPECTATION now stood on stilts. The world forgot to
turn round, or rather stood still, that it might witness the
affray; like an alderman watching the combat of two chivalrous flies upon his jerkin.
The eyes of all mankind, as usual in such cases, were
turned upon Fort Christina. The sun, like a little man in
a crowd at a puppet-show, scampered about the heavens,
popping his head here and there, and endeavoring to get a
peep between the unmannerly clouds that obtruded themselves in his way. The historians filled their inkhorns; the
poets went without their dinners, either that they might buy
paper and goose-quills, or because they could not get any
thing to eat; Antiquity scowled sulkily out of its grave, to
see itself outdone; while even Posterity stood mute, gazing
in gaping ecstasy of retrospection on the eventful field.
The immortal deities, who whilom had seen service at the
"affair" of Troy, now mounted their feather-bed clouds,
and sailed over the plain, or mingled among the combatants
in different disguises, all itching to have a finger in the pie.
Jupiter sent off his thunderbolt to a noted coppersmith, to
have it furbished up for the direful occasion. Venus vowed
by her chastity to patronize the Swedes, and paraded the
battlements of Fort Cllristina, accompanied by Diana, as a
sergeant's widow. The' noted bully, Mars, stuck two horsepistols into his belt, shouldered a rusty firelock, and gallantly swaggered at their elbow, as a drunken corporal, while
Apollo trudged in their rear, as a bandy-legged fifer, playing most villainously out of tune.
On the other side, the ox-eyed Juno, who had gained X
pair of black eyes over night, in one of her curtain-lectures
with old Jupiter, displayed her haughty beauties on a baggage-wagon; Minerva, as a brawny gin-suttler, tucked up
her skirts, brandished her fists, and swore most heroically,
by way of keeping up the spirits of the soldiers; while Vul308can halted as a club-footed blacksmith lately promoted to
be captain of militia. All was silent awe, or bustling preparation; War reared his horrid front, gnashed loud his iron
fangs, and shook his direful crest of bristling bayonets.
And now the mighty chieftains marshaled out their hosts.
Here stood stout Risingh, firm as a thousand rocks--incrusted with stockades, and intrenched to the chin in mud
batteries. His valiant soldiery lined the breastwork in grim
array, each having his mustachios fiercely greased, and his
hair pomatumed back, and queued so stiffly, that he grinned
above the ramparts like a grisly death's head.
There came on the intrepid Peter Stuyvesant; his brows
knit, his teeth set, his fists clenched, almost breathing forth
volumes of smoke, so fierce was the fire that raged within
his bosom. Then came waddling on the sturdy chivalry
of the Hudson, all fortified with a mighty dinner, and, to
use the words of the great poet, "Brimful of wrath and
cabbage."
And now commenced the horrid din, the desperate struggle, the maddening ferocity, the frantic desperation, the
confusion, and self-abandonment of war. Dutchman and
Swede commingled, tugged, panted, blowed. The heavens
were darkened with a tempest of missives. Bang! went the
guns-whack! went the broadswords-thump! went the
cudgels - crash! went the musket-stocks-- blows - kicks--
cuffs-scratches-black eyes, and bloody noses swelling the
horrors of the scene! Thick-thwack, cut-and-hack, helterskelter, higgledy-piggledy, hurly-burly, head over heels,
rough and tumble! "Dunder and blixen! " swore the Dutchmen; "Splitter and splutter!" cried the Swedes. "Storm
the works!" shouted Hardkoppig Peter. "Fire the mine!"
roared stout Risingh. Tante-ra-ra-ra! twanged the trumpet
of Antony VTan Corlear, until all voice and sound became
unintelligible; grunts of pain, yells of fury, and shouts of
triumph mingling in one hideous clamor. Thle earth shook
as if struck with a paralytic stroke, trees shrunk aghast and
withered at the sight, rocks burrowed in the ground like
rabbits, and even Christina Creek turned from its course,
and ran up hill in breathless terror!

Fort Christina, which, like another Troy, had stood a
siege of full ten hours, was carried by assault, without the
loss of a single man on either side. Victory, in the likeness
of a gigantic ox-fly, sat perched upon the cocked hat of the
gallant Stuyvesant, and it was declared by all the writers
whom he hired to write the history of his expedition, that
on this memorable day he gained a sufficient quantity of
glory to immortalize a dozen of the greatest heroes in
Christendom.
LXXXI.-THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HISTORIAN.
WASHINGTON IRVING.
THE more I reflect the more I am astonished at the important character of the historian.1 He is the sovereign
censor to decide upon the renown or infamy of his fellowmen. He is the patron of kings and conquerors, on whom
it depends whether they shall live in after ages, or be forgotten as were their ancestors before them.p The tyrant may
oppress while the object of his tyranny exists;,but the historian possesses superior might, for his power extends even
beyond the grave.; The shades of departed and long-forgotten heroes anxiously bend down from above while he writes,
watching each movement of his pen, whether it shall pass by
their names with neglect, or inscribe them on the deathless
pages of renown. Even the drop of ink which hangs trembling on his pen, which he may either dash upon the floor,
or waste in idle scrawlings-that very drop, which to him
is not worth the twentieth part of a farthing, may be of incalculable value to some departed worthy; may elevate half
a score, in one moment, to immortality, who would have
given worlds, had they possessed them, to insure the glorious meed.
Let not my readers imagine, however, that I am indulging
in vainglorious boastings, or am anxious to blazon forth the
importance of my tribe. On the contrary, I shrink when I
reflect on the awful responsibility we historians assume. I
shudder to think what direful commotions and calamities we
310occasion in the world.) I swear to thee, honest reader, as I
am a man, I weep at the very idea!  Why, let rne ask, are
so many illustrious men daily tearing themselves away from
the embraces of their families, slighting the smiles of beauty,
despising the allurements of fortune, and exposing them-;elves to the miseries of war?  Why are kings desolating
empires, and depopulating whole countries? In short, wlhat
induces all great men, of all ages and countries, to commit
so many victories and misdeeds, and inflict so many miseries
upon mankind and upon themselves, but the mere hope that
some historian will kindly take them into notice, and admit
them to a corner of his volume?  For, in short, the mighty
object of all their toils, their hardships, and privations, is
nothing but i~nmor/al famze; and what is immortal fame?
why, half a page of dirty paper! Alas! alas! how humiliating the idea that the renown of so great a man as Peter
Stuyvesant should depend upon the pen of so little a man as
Die(drich Knickerbocker.
LXXXII.-MARK THE HOURS THAT SHINE.
IN fair Italia's lovely land,
Deep in a garden bower,
A dial marks with shadowy hand
Each sun-illumined hour;
And on its fair, unsullied face

"I mark the hours that shine.'

LXXXVII.-RESOLUTIONS.
HENRY WARD BEECHER.
HENRY WARD BEECHER was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, June
24, 1813. He graduated at Amherst College in 1834, and afterward studied
theology at Lane Seminary, Cincinnati, which was at that time under
the direction of his father, Dr. Lyman Beecher. During his early life, he
is represented as a dull schlolar " having much talent lying around loose
in him." He began his ilinisterial labors at Lawrenceburg, Ind(iaina,
from which place he was called to Indianapolis, thence to Brooklyn,
New York, in 1847.
RESOLUTIONS should not, either, be hastily cast aside because they have been broken. If a man should start to carry
water to wounded soldiers from a spring afar off, and if, owing to the inequalities of the road, he should spill the water
on one side and on the other till one-half of it was gone,
317INSTITUTE READER.
what would you think of him if he should say, "I have
spilt, and spilt, till it is half gone, and I won't have any of
it," and throw it down in a moment of vexation?) It would
be very natural in a passionate man; but how foolish and
how inhuman it would be! When he was just within hearing of the feeble voices of men who cried for water, would
it be any reason why he should throw away what he hadl,
because it was less than he meant to bring?2If he had not
enough to give them each a swallow, he should have saved
what h'e had, that he might have at least put one drop on
the fevered lip of each.J There are many persons who form
resolutions and break them; and renew them and break
them again, and again renew them and break them; and at
last say, in vexation, "' I will have no more of them; it is
of no use for me to resolve."  But a resolution that is compIrehensive will be broken. No man ever made a compre.
hensive resolution, and carried it straight through life without nick, or flaw, or crack.
A resolution does not imply perfection. No man can be
perfect in a moment. If a man has been addicted to lying,
and he resolves that he will lie no more, the resolution
should stand; but it is sure that in thought or word he will
break it, for a man accustomed to lying can not in a moment rid himself of the habit.
A man resolves that he will refrain from the use of intoxicating drink, and holds out for a month, and then fails, and
says, "I have broken my pledge, and it is all over with me."
It is not all over with you. You have stumbled, but you are
not destroyed. When a man, on a journey, falls by the way,
he gets-up, and resting a little, starts again; and if he falls
again; he is sorry that he has fallen, but that is not a reason
why he should give up.
Many persons carry themselves far across the stream of difficulty, and then, on meeting some impediment and check,.
swim back again; whereas, the same effort, the same thought
and feeling, would carry them to the other side. What if a
man, having proposed to lead a higher life, finds that he has
come far below it?  Certainly he lias done more than if he
had formed no purpose at all. What if a man says, "I am
318SELECTIONVS.  
determined to avoid bad associates," and does for a time,
and then consorts with them again?-it is reason for sorrow, but it should be no reason why he should throw away
his resolution. Having tried once, we need to try again.
Resolutions are much like leaky boats, that, when they have
been bailed out, leak again. i Resolutions are much like imperfect arnms in the hands of a hunter. If, when he fires at the
game before him, he miss it, he keeps firing till he has hit.
Make resolutions, if you break them. Make them, only
make them wisely, with a strong will, and with practical wisdom. Try them on every day. Do not forget them; if you
do, renew them. And even if, when renewed and tried,
they are much abused and much neglected, cling to them.
It is better to have an imperfectly-kept resoluti9n than to
drift toward destruction without let or hinderance.j Hold fast
to ideals of good and to purposes of amendment. It is better to have a good purpose, even though you may not fulfill
it to your satisfaction. Do not be discouraged because the
way seems long, and perfection seems to delay in coming.
LXXXVIII.-GOOD NATURE.
HENRY WARD BEECHER.
GOOD nature-what a blessing! Without it a man is like
a wagon without springs, he has the full benefit of every stone
and way-rut. Good nature is the prime minister of a good
conscience. It tells of the genial spirit within, and good
nature never fails of a wholesome effect without.
Good nature is not only the government of one's own
sl!irit, but it goes far in its effects upon those of others. It
manifests itself on every street; it humanizes man; it softens
the friction of a business world. Good nature is the harmonious act of conscience.  Good nature in practical affairs is
better than any other; better than what men call justice;
better than dignity; better than standing on one's rights,
which is so often the narrowest and worst place to stand on
one can find.
A man who knows how to hold on to his temper. is the
319INSTITUTE READER.
rian who is respected by the community. And one who has
a good nature, successfully travels about as does he who goes
upon the principle-little of baggage, but plenty of money!
A man who is armed with hopefulness, cheerfulness, and a
genial spirit, is one who is going to be of practical and beneficent usefulness to his fellow-man. \TJa.ere are no things by
which the troubles and difficulties of this life can be resisted
l)etter than with wit and humor. And let the happy person
who possesses these-if he be brought into the folds of the
Churcl--not allow conversion to deprive him of them.
God has constituted these in man, and especially when they
are so salient in meeting good-naturedly the trials of this
world, they should be used. Happiness, at last, is dependent upon a soul that has holy communion with its Creator--
"for in Him we have life eternal."  Men also fail in happiness because they refuse to read the great lessons found in
tlhe great book of nature. Happiness is to be sought in
the possession of true manhood rather than in its internal
conditions.
LXXXIX.-THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.

From the silence of sorrowful hours
The desolate mourners go,
Lovingly laden with flowers,
Alike for the friend and the foe;
Under the sod and the -dew,
Waiting the judgment day:
Under the roses, the Blue;
Under the lilies, the Gray.
So with an equal splendor
The morning sun-rays fall,
With a touch, impartially tender,
On the blossoms blooming for all;
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment day:
Broidering with gold, the Blue;
Mellowed with gold, the Gray.
So when the summer calleth,
On forest and field of grain
With an equal murmur falleth
The cooling drip of rain;
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment day;
WTet with the rain, the Blue;
Wet with the rain, the Gray.
Sadly, but not with upbraiding,
The generous deed was done;
In the storm of the years that are fading,
No braver battle was won;
Under the sord and the dew,
Waiting the judgment day:
Under the blossoms, the Blue;
Under the garlands, the Gray.

XC.-MERCY TO ANIMALS.
COWPER.
WILIAM COWPER, " the most popular poet of his generation, and
the best of English letter writers," as the poet Southey terms him, was
born in Bedfordshire, November, 1731. After leaving school, he studied
law, but devoted much more of his time to poetry and general literature. He was afflicted with attacks of mental derangment, wlich
showed itself in paroxysms of extreme religious despondency, and
tended much to shorten his life. He died in April, 1800.
I WOULD not reckon on my list of friends,
(Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,
Yet wanting sensibility,) the man
Who needlessly sets his foot upon a worm.
An inadvertent step may crush the snail
That crawls at evening in the public path;
But he that has humanity, forewarned,
Will tread aside, and let the reptile live.
The creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight,
And charged perhaps with venom, that intrudes,
A visitor unwelcome, into scenes
Sacred to neatness and repose, the alcove,
The chamber, or refectory, may die;
A necessary act incurs no blame.
Not so when, held within their proper bounds,
And guiltless of offense, they range the air,
Or take their pastime in the spacious field.
There they are privileged; and he that hunts
Or harms them there is guilty of a wrong,
Disturbs the economy of Nature's realm,
Who, when she formed, designed them an abode.
The sum is this: If man's convenience, health,
Or safety interfere, his rights and claims
Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs.
Else they are all--the meanest things that areAs free. to live, and to enjoy that life,
As God was free to form them at the first,

Who in his sovereign wisdom, made them all.

XCI.-PLEASURES OF A WINTER EVENING.
COWPER.
Now stir the fire, and close the shutters fast,
Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round,
And, while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn
lThrows up a steamy column, and the cups,
That cheer but not inebriate, wait on each,
So let us welcome peaceful evening in.
Not such'his evening, who with shining face
Sweats in the crowded theater, and, squeezed
And bored with elbow points through both his sides,
Outscolds the ranting actor on the stage;
Nor his, who patient stands till his feet throb,
And his head thumps, to feed upon the breath
Of patriots, bursting with heroic rage,
Or placemen, all tranquillity and smiles.
This folio of four pages, happy work!'
Which not even critics criticise; that holds
Inquisitive attention, while I read,
Fast bound in chains of silence, which the fair,
Though eloquent themselves, refuse to break;
What is it but a map of busy life,
Its fluctuations, and its vast concerns?
Here runs the mountainous and craggy ridge
That tempts Ambition.
On the summit see
The seals of office glitter in his eyes;
He climbs, he pants, he grasps them! At his heels,
Close at his heels, a demagogue ascends,
And with a dexterous jerk soon twists him down,
And wins them, but to lose them in his turn.

XCII.-LETTER WRITING.
COWPER.
To THE REV. WILLIAM UNWIN:
You like to hear from me; this is a very good reason why
I should write.  But I have nothing to say; this seems
equally a good reason why I should not write. Yet, if you
had alighted from your horse at our door this morning, and
at the present writing, being five o'clock in the afternoon,
had found occasion to say to me: "Mr. Cowper, you have
not spoken since I came in; have you resolved never to
speak again?" it would be but a poor reply, if, in answer to
the summons, I should plead inability as my best and only
excuse. And this, by the way, suggests to me a seasonable
piece of instruction, and reminds me of what I am very apt
to forget, when I have any epistolary business on hand, that
a letter may be written upon any thing or nothing, just as
any thing or nothing happens to occur. A man that has a
journey before him, twenty miles in length, which he is to
perform on foot, will not hesitate and doubt whether he
shall set out or not, because he does not readily conceive
how he shall ever reach the end of it; for he knows, that
by the simple operation of moving one foot forward first,
and then the other, he shall be sure to accomplish it. So
it is in the present case, and so it is in every similar case.
A letter is written as a conversation is maintained, or a
journey performed; not by preconcerted, or premeditated
means, a new contrivance, or an invention never heard of
before, but merely by maintaining progress, and resolving
as a postilion does, having once set out, never to stop till
we reach the appointed end. If a man may talk without
thinking, why may he not write upon the same terms?  A
grave gentleman of the last century, a tie-wig, square-toe,
Steinkirk figure, would say, "My good sir, a man has no
right to do either."  But it is to be hoped the present century has nothing to do with the moldy opinions of the
last; and so, good Sir Launcelot, or Sir Paul, or whatever
be your name, step into your picture-frame again, and look
3a24SELECTIONS.
as if you thought for another century, and leave us moderns, in the meantime, to think when we can, and to write
whether we can or not, else we might as well be dead, as
you are.
When we look back upon our forefathers, we seem to look
hack upon the people of another nation, almost upon creatures of another species. Their vast rambling mansions,
spacious halls, and painted casements, the Gothic porch
smothered with honeysuckles, their little gardens and high
walls, their box-edging, halls of holly, and yew-tree statues,
are become so entirely unfashionable now, that we can
hardly believe it possible, that a people who resemble us so
little in our tastes, should resemble us in any thing else.
But in every thing else, I suppose, they were our counterparts exactly; and time, that has sewed up the slashed
sleeve, and reduced the large trunk-hose to a neat pair of
silk stockings, has left human nature just where it found it.
The inside of the man, has, at least, undergone no change.
His passions, appetites, and aims, are just what they ever
were. They wear, perhaps, a handsomer disguise than they
did in days of yore; for philosophy and literature will have
their effect upon the exterior; but in every other respect a
modern is only an ancient in a different dress.

the greatest happiness I can ever know or hope for in this

His infinite wisdom, to whose infinite mercy I owe it all,
can solve these questions, and none beside him. If I am
convinced that no affliction can befall me without the permission of God, I am convinced, likewise, that he sees and

knows that I aml afflicted.  Believinlg this, I must in the
same degree believe that, if I pray to him for deliverance,
he hears me; I must needs know likewise with equal assurance that, if he hears, he will also deliver me, if that will,
upon the whole, be most conducive to my happiness;.and
if he does not deliver.me, I may be well assured that he has
none but the most benevolent intention in declining it.
He made us, not because we could add to his happiness,
which was always perfect, but that we might be happy our,
selves; and will he not, in all his dispensations toward us,
even in the minutest, consult that end for which he made us?
To suppose the contrary, is (which we are not always aware
of) affronting every one of his attributes; and at the same
time the certain consequence of disbelieving his care for us
is, that we renounce utterly our dependence upon him.  In
this view, it will appear plainly that the line of duty is not
stretched too tight, when we are told that we ought to accept every thing at his hands as a blessing, and to be thankful even while we smart under the rod of iron with which he
sometimes rules us. Without this persuasion, every blessing,
however we may think ourselves happy in it, loses its greatest recommendation, and every affliction. is intolerable.
Death itself must be welcome to him who has this faith, and
he who has it not, must aim at it, if he is not a madman.

Toll for the queenly boat,
Wrecked on yon rocky shore;
Seaweed is in her palace-hallsShe rides the surge no more!
Toll for the master bold,
The high-souled and the brave,
Who ruled her like a thing of life
Amid the crested wave!
Toll for the hardy crew,
Sons of the storm and blast,
Who long the tyrant ocean dared,
But vanquished them at last!
Toll for the man of God,
Whose hallowed voice of prayer.
Rose calm above the stifled groan
Of that intense despair!
How precious were those tones,
On that sad verge of life,
Amid the fierce and freezing storm,
And the mountain-billows' strife!
Toll for the lover, lost,
To the summoned bridal-train!
Bright grows a picture on his breast,
Beneath the unfathomed main.
One from her casement gazeth
Long o'er the misty sea;
He cometh not, pale maiden--
His heart is cold to thee!
Toll for the absent sire,
Who to his home drew near,
To bless a glad, expecting groutpFond wife and children dear!
They heap the blazing hearth,
The festal board is spread--
But a fearful guest is at the gate;
Room for the sheeted dead!

Where breathed their soul of song.
Toll for the hearts that bleed'Neath misery's furrowing trace;
Toll for the hapless orphan left
The last of all his race!
Yea, with thy heaviest knell,
From surge to rocky shore,
Toll for the living--not the dead,
Whose mortal woes are o'er.
Toll, toll, toll!
O'er breeze and billow free;
And with thy startling lore instruct

May swift destruction sweep,

Lone teacher of the deep!
XOV.-THE     "ONE-HOSS-SHAY."
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.
OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES was born at Cambridge, Massachusetts,
August 29, 1809. After graduating at Harvard Uhiversity, he studie(d
law, but afterward relinquished it for the study of medicine. To per.
fect himself in this he visited Europe in 1832, and on lhis return, in 1838,
was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in Dartmouth
College. In 1847, he succeeded Dr. Warren as Professor of Anatomy in
the medical department of Harvard University. Since the " Atlantic
Monthly " was started, in 1857, he has been a leading contributor, bothl
in prose and verse.
A LOGICAL STORY.
Have you heard of the wonderful one-hoss-shay,
That was built in such a logical way
828SELECTIONS.
It ran a hundred years to a day,
And then of a sudden, it-ah, but stay,
I'11 tell you what happened, without delay--
Scaring the parson into fits,
Frightening people out of their witsHave you heard of that, I say?
Seventeen hundred and fifty-five,
Georgius Secundus was then alive--
Snuffy old drone from the German hive!
That was the year when Lisbon town
Saw the earth open and gulp her down,
And Braddock's army was done so brown,
Left without a scalp to its crown.
It was on the terrible earthquake day
That the deacon finished the one-hoss-shay.
Now, in building of chaises, I tell you what,
There is always, somewhere, a weakest spot--
In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,
In panel, or cross-bar, or floor, or sill,
in screw, bolt, thorough-brace --lurking still,.
Find it somewhere you must and will--
Above or below, or within or withoutAnd that's the reason, beyond a doubt,
A chaise breaks down, but does n't wear out.
But the deacon swore (as deacons do,
With an " I dew vum," or an "I tell yeou,")
He would build one shay to beat the taown,'N' the keounty,'n' all the kentry raoun;
It should be so built that'it could n' break daoun
"Fur," said the deacon, "'t is% mighty plain
That the weakes' ulace mus' stan' the strain;'N' the way to fix it, uz I maintain,
Is only jest
To make that place uz strong uz the rest,"
So the deacon inquired of the village folk
Where'he could find the strongest oak,

That could n't be split, nor bent, nor brokeThat was for spokes, and floor, and sills;
He sent for lance-wood, to make the thills;
The cross-bars were ash, from the straightest trees;
The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,
But lasts like iron for things like these;
The hubs from logs from the "Settler's Ellum"--
Last of its timber--they could n't sell'emNever an ax had seen their chips,
And the wedges flew from betweeen their lips,
Their burnt ends frizzled like celery tips;
Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,
Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin, too,
Steel of the finest, bright and blue;
Thorough-brace bison-skin, thick and wide;
Boot, top, dasher, from tough,. old hide,
Found in the pit when the tanner died.
That was the way "he put her through."
"There!" said the deacon, "naow she'11 dew."
Do! I tell you, I rather guess
She was a wonder, and nothing less!
Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,
Deacons and deaconesses dropped away;
Children and grandchildren-where are they?
But there stood the stout, old one-hoss-shay,
As fresh as on Lisbon earthquake day!
Eighteen hundred came, and found
The deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.
Eighteen hundred, increased by ten"Hahnsum kerridge" they called it then.
Eighteen hundred and twenty came;
Running as usual-much the same.
Thirty and forty at last arrive;
And then came fifty and fifty-five.
First of November --the earthquake day.
There are traces of age in the one-hoss-shay,
A general flavor of mild decayBut nothing local, as one may say.
a30SELECTIONS.
There could n't be-for the deacon's art
Had made it so like in every part,
That there was n't a chance for one to start,
For the wheels were just as strong as the thills,
And the floor was just as strong as the sills,
And the panels just as strong as the floor,
And the'whipple-tree neither less nor more,
And the back cross-bars as strong as the fore,
And spring, and axle, and hub encore.
And yet, as a wzehoe, it is past all doubt
In another hour it will be worn out/!
First of November, fifty-five!
This morning the parson takes a drive,
Now small boys, get out of the way!
Here comes the wonderful one-hoss-shay,
Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay.
"Huddup!" said the parson. Off went they.
The parson was working his Sunday text--
Had got to fifthy, and stopped perplexed
At what the-- Moses--was coming next:
All at once the horse stood still,
Close by the meet'n'-house on the hill.
-First a shiver, and then a thrill,
Then something decidedly like a spillAnd the parson was sitting on a rock,
And half past nine by the meet'n'-house clockJust the hour of the earthquake shock!
-What do'you think the parson found,
When he got up and stared around?
The poor old chaise in a heap or mound,
As if it had been to the mill and ground!
You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,
How it went to pieces all at onceAll at once, and nothing firstJust as bubbles do when they burst.
End of the wonderful one-hoss-shay.
Logic is logic--that's all I say.

When you were Bill and I was Joe.
Your name may flaunt a titled trail,
Proud as a cockerel's rainbow tail;
And mine as brief appendix wear
As Tam O'Shanter's luckless mare;
To-day, old friend, remember still
That I am Joe and you are Bill.

You've taught your name to half the globe;
You've sung mankind a deathless strain;

"See those old buffers, bent and gray,

A giddy whirlwind's fickle gust,'l'hat lifts a pinch of mortal dust;
A few swift years, and who can show
Which dust was Bill and which was Joe?'The weary idol takes his stand,
Holds out his bruised and aching hand,
While gaping thousands come and goHow vain it seems, this empty show!
Till all at once his pulses thrill;'T is poor old Joe's "'God bless you, Bill!"
And shall we breathe in happier spheres
The names that pleased our mortal ears,
In some sweet lull of harp and song
For earth-born spirits none too long,
Just whispering of the world below
Where this was Bill and that was Joe?
No matter; while our home is here
No sounding name is half so dear;
When fades at length our lingering day,
Who cares what pompous tombstones say;
Read on the hearts that love us still,
hiec jacet Joe. Hic jacet Bill.
XCVII.-THE RIGHT USE OF KNOWLEDGE
DR. JOHNSON.
SAMUEL JOHNSON was born at Litchfield, 1709.
He early gave proof of a vigorous understanding and fondness for
knowledge; but poverty compelled hiiii to leave Oxford after being
there three years.
333INSTITUTE READER.
His " Life of Richard Savage," " Vanity of Human Wishes," " The
Rambler," " The Idler," " Rasselas," " Lives of the Poets," attest his
style a:s an author; but his " Dictionary " was the great work of his
life, which, considering the little aid he could receive from previous
lexicographers, was a gigantic undertaking, successfully accomplished.
His great characteristic as a writer was uncommon vigor and logical
precision of intellect. His reasoning was sound, dexterous, and acute;
his thoughts striking and original; and his imagination vivid. He
died, in great peace, in 1784.
IT is too common for those who have been bred to scholastic professions, and passed much of their time in academies where nothing but learning confers honors, to disregard
every other qualification, and to imagine that they shall find
mankind ready to pay homage to their knowledge, and to
crowd about them for instruction. They, therefore, step out
from their cells into the open world, with all the confidence
of authority and dignity of importance; they look round
about them, at once with ignorance and scorn, on a race of
beings to whom they are equally unknown and equally contemptible, but whose manners they must imitate, and with
whose opinions they must comply, if they desire to pass their
time happily among them.
To lessen that disdain with which scholars are inclined to
look upon the common business of the world, and the tinwillingness with which they condescend to learn what is not
to be found in any system of philosophy, it may be necessary
to consider that though admiration is excited by abstruse re
searches and remote discoveries, yet pleasure is not given,
nor affection conciliated, but by softer accomplishments and
qualities more easily communicable to those about us. He
who can only converse upon questions about which only a
small part of mankind has knowledge sufficient to make them
curious, nmust lose his days in unsocial silence, and live in
the crowd of life without a companion.  He that can only
be useful on great occasions, may die without exerting his
abilities, and stand. a helpless spectator of a thousand vexations which fret away happiness, and which nothing is
required to remove but a little dexterity of conduct and
readiness of expedients.
No degree of knowledge attainable by man is able to set
him above the want of hourly assistance; or to extinguish
334SELECTIO-NS.
the desire of fond endearments and tender officiousness,
and, therefore, no one should think it unnecessary to learn
those arts by which friendship may be gained. Kindness is
preserved by a constant reciprocation of benefits, or interchange of pleasures; but such benefits only can be bestowed
as others are capable to receive, and such pleasures only ilmlparted as others are qualified to enjoy.
By this descent from the pinnacles of art, no honor "will
be lost; for the condescensions of learning are always overpaid by gratitude. An elevated genius, employed in little
things, appears, to use the simile of Longinus, like the sun
in his evening declination; he remits his splendor, but retains his magnitude, and pleases more though he dazzles less.
XCVIII.-SOLITUDE NOT DESIRABLE.
DR. JOHNSON.
THOUGH learning may be conferred by solitude, its application must be attained by general converse. He has learned
to no purpose that is not able to teach; and he will always
teach unsuccessfully, who can not recommend his sentiments
by his diction or address.
Even the acquisition of knowledge is often much facilitated by the advantages of society; he that never compares
his notions with those of others, readily acquiesces in his
first thoughts, and very seldom  discovers the objections
which may be raised against his opinions; he, therefore,
often thinks himself in possession of truth, when he is only
fondling an error long since exploded. He that has neither
companions nor rivals in his studies, will always applaud.
his own progress, and think highly of his performances, because he knows not that others have equaled or excelled
him. And I am afraid it may be added, that the student
who withdraws himself from the world, has that ardor extinguished which praise or emulation had enkindled, and takes
the advantage of secrecy to sleep rather than to labor.
There is a set of recluses, whose intention entitles them to
respect, and whose motives deserve a serious consideration.

These retire from the world, not merely to bask in ease or
gratify curiosity; but that, being disengaged from common
cares, they may employ more time in the duties of religion;
that they may regulate'their actions with stricter vigilance,
and purify their thoughts by more frequent meditation.
To men thus elevated above the mists of mortality, I an
far from presuming myself qualified to give directions. On
him that appears "to pass through things temporal," with
no other care than "not to lose finally the things eternal,"
I look with such veneration as inclines me to approve his
conduct in the whole, without a minute examination of its
parts; yet I could never forbear to wish, that while vice is
every day multiplying seducements, and stalking forth with
more hardened effrontery, virtue would not withdraw the
influence of her presence, or forbear to assert her natural
dignity by open and undaunted perseverance in the right.
Piety practiced in solitude, like the flower that blooms in
the desert, may give its fragrance to the winds of heaven,
and delight those disembodied spirits that survey the works
of God and the actions of men; but it bestows no assistance
upon earthly beings, and however free from taints of impurity, yet wants the sacred splendor of beneficence.
XCIX.-SHAEKESPEARE.
DR. JOHNSON.
SHAKESPEARE is, above all writers-at least above all modern writers-the poet of nature; the poet that holds up to
his readers a faithful mirror of manners and of life. His
characters are not modified by the customs of particular
places, unpracticed by the rest of the world; by the peculiarities of studies or professions, which can operate but upon
small numbers; or by the accidents of transient fashions or
temporary opinions; they are the genuine progeny of common humanity, such as the world will always supply, and
observation will always find. His persons act and speak by
the influence of those general passions and principles by
which all minds are agitated, and the whole system of life
336SELECTIOIaS.
is continued in motion. In the writings of other poets a
character is too often an individual; in those of Shakespeare
it is commonly a species.
It is from this wide extension of design that so much instruction is derived. It is this which fills the plays of Shakespeare with practical axioms and domestic wisdom. It is
said of Euripides, that every verse was precept; and it may
be said of Shakespeare, that from his works may be collected
a system of civil and economical prudence. Yet his real
power is not shown in the splendor of particular passages,
but by the progress of his fable and the tenor of his dialogue; and he that tries to recommend him by select quotations, will succeed like the pedant in Hierocles, who, when
he offered his house for sale, carried a brick in his pocket as
a specimen.
It will not easily be imagined how much Shakespeare excels
in accommodating his sentiments to real life, but by comparing him with other authors. It was observed of the
ancient schools of declamation, that the more diligently
they were frequented, the more was the student disqualified
for the world, because he found nothing there which he
should ever meet in any other place.
The same remark may be applied to every stage but that
of Shakespeare. The theater, when it is under any other
direction, is peopled by such characters as were never seen,
conversing in a language which was never heard, upon topics
which will never arise in the commerce of mankind. But
the dialogue of this author is often so evidently determined
by the incident which produces it, and is pursued with so
much ease and simplicity, that it seems scarcely to claim the
inerit of fiction, but to have been gleaned by diligent selection out of common conversation and common occurrences.
Upon every other stage the universal agent is love, by
whose power all good and evil is distributed, and every
action quickened or retarded.

in rapture, and part in agony; to fill their mouths with hyperbolical joy and outrageous sorrow; to distress them as
nothing human ever was distressed; to deliver them as no
human evei was delivered, is the business of a modern
dramatist. For this, probability is violated, life is misrepresented, and language is depraved. But love is only one of
many passions; and as it -has no great influence upon the
sum of life, it has little operation in the dramas of the poet,
who caught his ideas from the living world, and exhibited
only what he saw before him. He knew that any other
passion, as it was regular or exorbitant, was a cause of happiness or calamity.
This, therefore, is the praise of Shakespeare that his drama
is the mirror of life; that he who has mazed his imagination, in following the phantoms which other writers raise up
before him, may here be cured of his delirious ecstasies by
reading human sentiments in human language, by scenes
from which a hermit may estimate the transactions of the
world, and a confessor predict the progress of the passions.
C.-THE ISLE OF LONG AGO.
B. F. TAYLOR.
O! A WONDERFUL stream is the river Time,
As it runs through the realm of tears,
With a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme,
And a boundless sweep and a surge sublime,
As it blends with the Ocean of Years.
There's a magical isle in the river of Time,
Where- the softest of airs are playing;
There's a cloudless sky and a tropical clime,
And a song as sweet as a vesper chime,
And the Junes with the roses are staying.
And the name of that Isle is the Long Ago,
And we bury our treasures there;
338SELECTIONS.
There are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow;
There are heaps of dust-but we loved them sol
There are trinkets and tresses of hair.
There are fragments of song that nobody sings,
And a part of an infant's prayer;
There's a lute unswept, and a harp without strings;
There are broken vows and pieces of rings,
And the garments that she used to wear.
There are hands that are waved, when the fairy shore
By the mirage is lifted in air;
And we sometimes hear, through the turbulent roar,
Sweet voices we heard in the days gone before,
When the wind down the river is fair.
O, remembered for aye, be the blessed Isle,
All the day of our life till nightWhen the evening comes with its beautiful smile,
And our eyes are closing to slumber awhile,
May that "Greenwood" of Soul be in sight.

I LOVE it! I love it! and who shall dare
To chide me for loving that old arm chair?
I've treasured it long as a sainted prize,
I've bedewed it with tears and embalmed it with sighs;'T is bound by a thousand bands to my heart,
Not a tie will break, not a link will start;
Would you know the spell? a mother sat there!
And a sacred thing is that old arm chair.
In childhood's hour I lingered near
That hallowed seat with a listening ear,
And gentle words that mother would give,
To fit me to die and teach me to live;

She told me shame would never betide,
With truth for my creed, and God for my guide;
She taught me to lisp my earliest prayer,
As I knelt beside that old arm chair.
I sat and watched her many a day
When her eye grew dim, and her locks were gray,
And I almost worshiped her when she smiled
And turned from her Bible to bless her child;
Years rolled on, but the last one sped,
My idol was shattered, my earth-star fled!
I felt how much the heart can bear,
When I saw her die in that old arm chair.'T is past!'t is past! but I gaze on it now
With quivering lip and throbbing brow;'T was there she nursed me,'t was there she died,
And memory still flows with lava tide.
Say it is folly, and deem me weak,
As the scalding drops start down my cheek;
But I love it! I love it! and can not tear
My soul from a mother's old arm chair!
CII.-BINGEN.
CAROLINE NORTON.
A SOLDIER of the Legion lay dying in Algiers;
There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of
woman's tears;
But a comrade stood beside him, while the life-blood ebbed
away,
And bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say,
The dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade's hand,
And said: " I never more shall see my own, my native land;
Take a message, and a token, to some distant friends of mineFor I was born at Bingen-at Bingen on the Rhine.
"Tell my brothers and companions, when they meet and
crowd around,

But some were young, and suddenly beheld life's morn declineAnd oine had come from Bingen-fair Bingen on the Rhine!

For I was still a truant bird, that thought his home a cage;
For my father was a soldier, and even when a child

And when he died and left us to divide his scanty hoard,

To listen to him kindly, without regret or shame;
And to hang the old sword in its place (my father's sword

His trembling voice grew faint and hoarse, his gasp was childlike, weak;
His eye put on a dying look, he sighed, and ceased to speak.
His comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled;
The soldier of the Legion in a foreign land lay dead.
The pale moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down
On the red sands of the battle-field, with bloody corses
strewn.
Yes, calmly on that bloody field her pale light seemed to
shine
As it shone on distant Bingen, fair Bingen on the Rhine.
342TEACHTEVRS' INSTIT LTTES.TEAC H K1RS' INSTIT UT'ES.
CHAPTER I.
HOW ORGANIZED.
Definition.-A Teachers' Institute is an association of
the teachers of any specified locality for professional improvement, and for the acquisition and dissemination of
knowledge on educational subjects. Institutes may be divided into three classes: County, Township, and City or
Town. In the following treatise, the County Institute alone
is considered.
By whom    organized.-When it has been decided to
organize an Institute, it should be ascertained whether there
are any legal enactments relating thereto. When there are
such, the form therein prescribed should be followed. The
County Superintendent, State School Commissioner, or State
Superintendent, if applied to either in person or by letter,
will furnish the information desired.
When there is no law upon the subject, the County Superintendent, the Board of School Examiners, a teacher, a
number of teachers, or any friend of education, may issue,
through the county press, a call for a meeting of the teachers, and submit the matter to them for their consideration
and action; or one or more individuals may, at their own
risk of defraying the expenses, assume the responsibility of

calling and of conducting an Institute. It is preferable,
however, to secure the co-operation of a number of teachers. This may be done at the meeting just alluded to, or
by three or four teachers in different parts of the county,
waiting personally upon their acquaintances and others with
a paper stating the object of the Institute, and securing their
pledge to attend and assist in defraying the expenses. By
this means, an attendance can be secured, and success in
a good cause will repay those making the sacrifice of time
and labor.
How advertised.-Any editor will publish, in the local
columns of his paper, a call for an Institute. It will be well
to secure one or more short editorials relating to the subject;
and circulars or handbills, also, may be employed to advantage in getting the enterprise before teachers and the public.
When the preparatory arrangements have all been completed, printed programmes, announcing time and place of
meeting, order of exercises, names of instructors and lecturers, cost of boarding, and other items of interest, signed by
the officers or the committee of arrangements, should be
sent to the teachers of the county so far as their addresses
can be obtained.
When held.-The best time for holding an Institute is
when the largest number of teachers can attend, and just
before they enter upon the labors of another year. As most
schools close by the last of June, and do not reopen until
the first of September, some time during the months of July
and August is, therefore, the most appropriate.  Should any
have engagements for teaching during its session, local
directors will excuse such for the time, if the matter be
properly represented to them. In many places such teachers are not only excused, but their salaries are continued.
School managers will lose nothing by adopting this liberal
course. The winter or spring vacation, in many places, may
be a suitable time; but the convenience of teachers, and
the ability to secure competent instructors, should, in all
cases, be consulted.
346T'EACHERS' liVSTITUI'ES.
/ Where heid.-This is an important matter, and Institutes sometimes fail because it is not sufficiently considered.
The first session should be held in that place where it will
be most cordially received by the community, and which is
most accessible to teachers. The county seat, because of its
central location, and of its affording accommodations in the
way of boarding for teachers, and recitation and lecture
rooms for the Institute, will, perhaps, in most counties, be
found to be the most appropriate place. There are objections, however, to county towns. When they exceed in population four or five thousand, the people are so completely
occupied with other matters as to be unwilling to give attention to an enterprise of this kind. In such cases, the selection of a smaller town is desirable.
After the Institute has been thoroughly organized, and
has acquired strength and influence as an organization, an
occasional session may be held in localities where there is
indifference to the cause of education, for the purpose of
awakening among the people- an interest on the subject;
but it would be suicidal to take the first session to such a
place.
Invitations from various towns may be received and considered before selecting the place.
Entertainment of Teachers.-A committee resident
in the place of holding the Institute should be appointed to
attend to this matter. If the session is not longer than one
week, the ladies, at least, may be entertained free of charge;
or if not, then at reduced rates, and the gentlemen at nominal prices. This committee should canvass the town and
vicinity, and secure a list of the names of the families that
will receive teachers, also, how many and at what prices,
that they may be able, when the teachers assemble on the
morning and in the room   advertised, to assign them  to
places without confusion or delay.
How   long held.-This must be determined by the
wants of the county, the funds at the disposal of the manigers, and the interest manifested by the teachers. If it be
347INSTITUTE READER.
necessary to furnish regular instruction in the text-books,
then the Institute assumes an academical character, and the
session may be continued, with profit, from four to six
weeks. During the term, lessons should be assigned, studied,
and recited as in any other school, with additional instruction in methods of teaching. But the legitimate work of
the Institute proper is to give shape and direction to the
knowledge already acquired; to impart instruction in new
and improved methods of teaching and government; to
quicken thought; to awaken professional spirit; and to cultivate a unity of interest among teachers. To these ends, a
session of one or two weeks, conducted by experienced instructors, will accomplish more than one inefficiently conducted for a much longer time.
Who should attend.-All active teachers will avail
themselves of this means of advancing their profession and
the cause of education; young teachers should not allow the
opportunity afforded them of securing the great advantage
to be derived from  the experience of old and successful
teachers to pass unimproved; those who contemplate teaching in the future should secure to themselves the information
thus offered on school management and discipline. These
persons should make it their special business to attend; and
school officers, parents, and all friends of education should
lend the enterprise the encoiuragement of their presence.
Expenses, how defrayed.-In some States, approyri
ations are made by law for paying the expenses of instruction
in Institutes. The County Auditor will furnish a copy of the
school law containing the statutes upon the subject, and the
steps necessary to be taken in order to secure the funds. If
there be no appropriation, or if it be inadequate, it will be
necessary for those calling the Institute to assume the
responsibility of meeting the expenses. There are various
ways by which the managers may insure themselves against
loss. They may secure, beforehand, the names of a sufficient
number of teachers, with pledges to attend and assist, or
they mlay announce the tuition fee with the call for the In348TEACHERS' INSTITUTES.
stitute, and rely on the attendance being sufficiently large
to defray the expenses.
After an organization is effected, a membership fee, to be
paid annually and in advance, if thought best, may be fixed,
or it may be resolved to meet all outlays by an equal taxaation of the members. In some places, they may be met in
part by the proceeds from concerts, lectures, readings, etc.,
or by donations from citizens.
Instructors.-There should be at least one practical
teacher who has had experience in conducting Institutes.
To secure the services of such a person, it may be required
to pay what, at first thought, may seem to be a high price.
But such an expenditure, if judiciously made, will result in
profit; for teachers will be more completely satisfied, and
will be better prepared for their labors in the school-room,
than if an incompetent instructor be employed.
It is not meant that one person should do all the teaching;
but that he should give direction to the whole, and have special
charge of the department of Theory and Practice of Teaching. The exercises in reading, arithmetic, geography, writing, and spelling may be conducted by teachers of the
county who have been successful in teaching particular
branches, and who have standing in the profession. These
should be remunerated, but, because they are residents of
the county, and have their interests identified therewith, a
less compensation would be just.
The practice of employing persons to lecture upon subjects
that do not come directly within the range of the profession,
exhausts the funds without furnishing practical information.
If, however, such lectures can be made to pay their own expenses, they will add to the interest of the session, ond will
give the Institute character among the citizens.  Let tnem
form  evening' entertainments, as much for the benefit of
citizens as of teachers, but never let them take the place of
regular Institute training.  In every county, there is local
talent which may be employed in this direction. There are
ministers, lawyers, doctors, and other persons of culture who
will cheerfully contribute lectures upon moral education,

school law, physiology, and literature, if they are solicited
to do so some time before the meeting of the Institute.
The first day.-The success of an Institute depends, to
a great degree, upon the impression made at the commencement. A plan, therefore, should be fully matured, that
nothing may be left to the emergency of the hour. The
managers should meet the teachers with a friendly greeting,
and see that strangers are introduced to each other.  To
assist in this, a committee, consisting of a few teachers, well
acquainted in the county, may be appointed.
If thought desirable, a short session may be held during
the forenoon to inaugurate the regular order of exercises, or
an address of welcome may be made, closing with an announcement of the programme for the afternoon.
Temporary organization.-If the enterprise is a private one, the projector, of course, is manager; but if it be
an association of teachers, it will be necessary to effect a
temporary organization the first day, by electing the proper
officers and committees.
Permanent organization.-Some time during the first
session, perhaps on the last day, a permanent organization
should be made. A day or two previous to its close a committee may be appointed to prepare and report a constitution. The constitution should be as brief as possible.  Half
a dozen short articles will contain all that is necessary to be
specified.  It should provide for the election of a president,
a secretary, a treasurer, and an executive committee of three
members, the president and secretary being made, ex officio,
members of the committee. To this committee, should be
intrusted the entire management of the Institute.  If there
are no funds provided for by statute, or if they are inadequate, an article establishing a tuition or membership fee
may be introduced. The constitution being adopted. the
election of officers will complete the organization

HOW CONDUCTED.
SECTION I.-ORDER OF EXERCISES.
THE organization being completed, the subject next in
order of time, but first in importance, is the method of conducting the Institute. That the greatest possible good may
be accomplished, a well matured, systematically arranged
programme of exercises should be marked out and adhered
to as closely as possible. To assist the committee in making
out the order of daily exercises, the following for the first
day is given. In Section II will be found a division of the
branches of study taught, from which topics may be selected
for each day's exercise. Following Section II, a list of
questions in the theory and practice of teaching is given,
from which selections may be made for this department.

SECTION II.- SUGGESTIONS.
The Plan.-The Order of Exercises just laid down, and
the instructions which follow, are based on the model of a
well regulated and well taught school. As the best way of
presenting a method of teaching is by illustration, it is contemplated that each branch shall first be illustrated by a
recitation, and then discussed. But little time is needed for
the presentation of well matured methods, and none others
should be presented.
Classes.-An instructor may lecture to an Institute
numbering a hundred or more, but the effort to conduct a
recitation with a class of that number will prove unsatisfactory.  Where a division into classes is thought best, the following plan is recommended: On the first day of the session
the secretary should organize the teachers into classes, each
class not to exceed twenty in number, and assign those
coming in afterward to one of the classes already formed.
Every recitation should be conducted in the presence of all
the teachers, and those not reciting should constitute a committee of observation.  When the recitation is concluded
they should offer such criticisms, or make such inquiries as
may be proper and beneficial. That all may have the benefit
of an exercise in each branch of study, the classes should
alternate-the class in Orthography one day being thle
Reading class of the next, etc.
352TEA CIHERS' I7NSTITlUTES.
Branches of Study Taught.-In most of the states,
Orthography, Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, English Grammar, Geography, and the Theory and Practice of Teachinig
are called " legal branches," because the law requires that
teachers shall be familiar with them before receiving certificates of qualification to teach. While in most countics,
therefore, the principal part of the instruction should be
(levoted to these subjects, others may be brought in incidentally, and much useful knowledge may be imparted.
Orthography.-The aim of the instruction in this should
be, (i.) To secure the clear and forcible enunciation of letters and words; (2.) Phonetic spelling and analysis of words;
(3.) Methods of teaching the alphabet; (4.) Oral spelling;
(5.) Written spelling; (6.) Methods of conducting spelling
mlatches; (7.) Spelling and defining; (8.) Spelling from reading lessons and from dictionaries; (9.) Spelling geographical
and proper names; (io.) Spelling names of things belonging
to the different trades and occupations; (II.) Names of
natural objects, etc.; all of which should be illustrated.
Reading.--A very common error on this subject is that
of substituting elocutionary display for practical instruction.
WVhat teachers need is not a lecture on the sub&gt;,ct of elocution, but illustrations of how to teach reading by correcting
individual habits of incorrect pronunciation, ilflection, emphasis, etc.
The course of instruction should embrace, (i.) Exercises
in reading from Primer, First, Second, Third, Fourth, and
Fifth Readers; (2.) Reading with special attention to Articulation, Emphasis, and Inflection; (3.) Reading with special
attention to Quality, Force, Stress, Pitch, Quantity, and
Movement; (4.) Reading in Narrative and Descriptive styles;
(5.) Reading in Didactic and Senatorial styles; (6.) Reading
in Dramatic style; (7.) Declamations.  Practice as well as
instruction slLould be given in vocal culture, for no one can
teach reading properly, who can not himself read well. The
various methods for securing attention, awakening and maintaining interest, should also be illustraLed and discussed.
I. R. 30.
3  INTS'T1T'UTE READER.
Writing.-Upon this subject, (I.) The position of tHe
body, and the manner of holding the pen while writing;
(2.) Principles, and length of letters; (3.) Angles, curves,
and shapes; (4.) Analysis of small letters; (5.) Analysis of
capital letters; (6.) Composition, and other written exercises
as a means of teaching writing, should demand attention.
If the furniture of the room will admit of it, practical
exercises should be given; but if it will not, then the blackboard should be freely used in illustration.
In methods of teaching, the following subjects should be
considered: At what age should pupils begin to write?
Should the first lessons be with slate and pencil, or with pen
and paper? Should all the pupils in the room be required
to write at the same time?  To what extent should copies
be used? Should pupils be required to furnish books with
copies? How can the teacher best conduct the exercise?
Arithmetic.-Since teachers are usually more deficient
in arithmetical principles and methods of teaching than in
the solution of problems, most of the time allotted to this,subject should be devoted to these points, the solution of
problems being used, mainly, for illustrating the operations
and methods. The close connection between mental and
written arithmetic should not be lost sight of, but they
should be taught simultaneously, many of the problems in
written arithmetic being solved mentally.
The following topics will be found appropriate for consideration: (I.) The Fundamental Rules; (2.) Notation and
Numeration; (3.) Greatest Common Divisor and Least
Common Multiple; (4.) Common Fractions; (5.) Decimal
Fractions; (6.) Ratio and Proportion; (7.) Percentage and
Interest; (8.) Discount and Banking; (9.) Square and Cube
Roots.
Under the head of Theory and Practice as applied to arithmetic, the relative time it should occupy in the schools, is
an inquiry Iproper to be made; and the following question
might be discussed with advantage to many schools: How
can an adequate knowledge of Arithmetic be attained in less
time than is now devoted to the subject?
354TEA CHERS' INSTITUTES.
English Grammar.-Instruction in this branch should
commence with methods of teaching children the correct
use of language, by forming sentences, correcting errors in
grammar, etc. The analysis as well as the synthesis of sentences should be attended to. Special attention should be
given to the lmanzier of analysis and parsing, that the common fault of analyzing and parsing by rote may be avoided.
The tones of the voice, and the emphasis and inflection of
the words, should always indicate that the pupil understands
what he is saying. He should frequently be arrested in
the ordinary routine by calling his attention to the reaso;z.
Throughout the course, daily exercises should be given in
analysis and parsing.
The following division of the subject is given suggesting
a course of instruction in this branch: (i.) False Syntax and
Synthesis; (2.) The Parts of Speech; (3.) The Elements of
a Sentence--Principal and Subordinate; Siml)le, Complex,
and Compound; Adjective, Objective, and Adverbial; (4.)
The complex Sentence, Subordinate Clauses; (5.) The Compound Sentence, Co-ordinate Clauses.
Punctuation and the correct use of capitals in writing
should not be neglected. The aim in all grammatical instruction should be to make prac/ical grammarians. To this
end, composition exercises wvill be found an invaluable
assistant.
Geography.-For the time devoted to it, the results
secured in Geography are, perhaps, more unsatisfactory than
in any other branch.  Methods of teaching it should, therefore, be made very prominent, and the lessons in it should
be given, as far as practicable, as models in teaching. The
way of presenting facts to be remembered, should be explained, and the law of association, in its application to
this subject, should be fully developed and illustrated. The
outline of the continents will give the direction of the
mountains, and the mountain chains and systems, in turn,
will furnish the key to the river systems.
Correct ideas of the location of places, and their direction
and distance from each other; correct impressions of the

relative importance of countries; how to teach definitionis that
pupils may have distinct ideas of things; map drawing as a
means of fixing the location of places in the mind; the influence which the physical features of the different countries have
exerted on men should be taught in connection with Descriptive Geography; the sources of information which teachers
should have for teaching Geography successfully lshould all
receive attention.
The following, among other topics, will be found appropriate for exercise in this branch: (i.) Continents-their
location, size, shape, and natural features; (2.) Mountain
systems and ranges; (3.) River systems; (4.) Lakes, seas,
bays, and gulfs; (5.) The great commercial cities of the
world-their latitude, longitude, and description; (6.) The
great manufacturing cities of the world-their location, etc.;
(7.) The oceanic and wind currents; (8.) the causes which
affect climate.
Theory and Practice of Teaching.-The treatment
of each branch of study should be essentially the theory and
practice of teaching it. There are some subjects demanding
attention, however, that do not belong to any branch of
study; (for a list of which see Section III.) The consideration of these should be practical.  Generalities may do well
enough for the experienced teacher, for he is supposed to be
able to work out a method of his own, but they can be of
but little service to the young teachers; this class need specific directions.
Discussions.-Should these form a part of the exercise
in theory and practice of teaching, they should not be conducted for the purpose of gainizg the question, but for the
simple purpose of eliciting the truth. The executive committee should appoint one or two persons, the day previous,
to open the discussion and give an outline of the subject
clearly and concisely stated; then let those follow who may
have something valuable to offer in the way of experienc2
or otherwise.  Those who are diffident or unaccustomed

356TEACHERS' INSTITUTES.
Lectures.-Many of these will be given by the principal
instructor.  Others may be presented by teachers appointed
by the executive committee some time before the meeting
of the Institute. These lectures should be practical, and
should contain, if possible, something new, stated in clear
and concise language. When practicable, the points treated
of should be placed upon the blackboard in the form of an
abstract, that the teachers may copy them into their note
books for future reference and consideration.
Criticisms.-At the commencement of each day of the
session the president should appoint one or more teachers
to act as critics.
It frequently happens that criticisms are confined to mere
verbal errors or slight mistakes in syntax. These should
receive attention, but to throw the whole force of the criticisms upon them not only indicates a narrow view of the
office of the critic, but is likely to produce any thing but a
pleasant feeling in the Institute. The range of criticism
should take in the thought as well as the expression of the
speaker, and if the critic be qualified he will add materially
to the interest of the daily exercises. At the close of the day'
he may put upon the blackboard a synopsis of the exercises
which should be copied by the teachers into their note books.
Query Box.-This is a box similar to those used in balloting, placed upon the secretary's table, in which teachers
deposit such questions as they may wish to ask in this way,
legibly written on slips of paper. It may be opened at the
close of each day by the secretary, who will read the
questions, and assign them  to proper persons to be answered. The answer may be given at the time, or reserved
until the following day. These questions may take a wide
range, but it is perhaps best to confine them to practical
subjects.
The secretary should suppress any that may be asked in a
spirit of captiousness, or may be otherwise improper.
Assistant Instructors.-These have been referred to
in Chapter I. Two or three will, perhaps, be a sufficient'

number. They should have charge of the classes, and
conduct the exercises under the direction of the principal
instructor. They should keep a register of the attendance
and punctuality, and a record of each recitation, illustrating
methods of marking, etc., which can be made serviceable to
boards of examiners in determining the qualification of applicants for certificates.
Text-Books.-It will, perhaps, be impossible to secure
uniform text-books in a County Institute; but each teacher
should take with him such books as he may have been using
in the school-room. These will be useful for reference and
for preparing the daily exercises; and those who do not teach
all the year, will find this an excellent opportunity for reviewing, preparatory to beginning the next term. Besides, a comparison of authorities will be of advantage, and a knowledge
of various authors may lead to an improvement in the books
used in the different localities.
Note Books.--Every teacher should provide himself
with a small blank book, in which to make notes on the
topics discussed and the class exercises.
The advantages of this practice can not be overestimated.
Many valuable suggestions are made which seem plain and
=easy to be remembered at the time, but which are soon
crowded out of the mind by something else, and forgotten.
If a note be made of them, they can be recalled as they are
needed' in the school-room.
-n addition to the notes of each exercise, the synopsis of
the'- day's work as put upon the blackboard by the critic
should be copied.
Evening Exercises.-During the session, two or three
evenings of each week may be devoted to lectures, conference meetings, etc. The exercises need not be so exclusively professional as those of the day, and a general invitation to aftend them should be extended to the citizens.
The discussion of the educational movements of the age,
lectures upon scho9l law, moral education, and various other
topics, are not only proper but highly profitable. Very
358TEACHERS' INSTITUTES.
pleasant entertainments, consisting of essays, declamations,
and select readings, interspersed with appropriate music,
may be given by the teachers themselves.
Social Reunions.-Sociability is a quality which should
be cultivated during the entire session. An Institiute from
which teachers go away without knowing one another better
than when they first met, has failed in a very important
particular. An evening of the session may be devoted to a
social reunion. On such an occasion it is customary to have
refreshments of some kind, toasts, responses, etc.; but the
main object should be social enjoyment.
The President.-The duties of this officer are so important that a notice of them is deemed in place. Upon
him, in connection with the executive committee, depends
almost entirely the success of the Institute. It is sometimes
the practice to elect an honorary president. This should
never be done. He should be selected for his capacity and
fitness for the office alone, and should be present at every
exercise of the Institute.
It is not necessary, though desirable, that he should be
an active teacher. He should possess tact in management,
that he may bring out the talent of all the teachers at the
proper time; especially will he have need of this faculty in
conducting that part of the exercise in theory and practice
of teaching committed to the teachers. He should be afiable and courteous, but inflexible in his adherence to the timle
allotted to each exercise, in no instance allowing one subject
to trespass upon the time of another, but announllcing each
at the minute appointed.

TO THE TEACHER OF THIRD, FOURTH, AND
FIFTH READERS.
THE reason for this division into parfs is not so much orn
account of the difference in the application of the Rules and
Directions to the various grades, as on account of the difference in the mattcr appropriate for reading exercises.
Many of the Rules laid down in Part I will be found to
be specially applicable to Third, Fourth, and Fifth Readers,
and should be carefully studied by the teacher of those
books.
The Teacher's Preparation.- However long you
may have taught reading, or however well you read, you will
find it greatly to your advantage-absolutely necessary to a
high degree of success in teaching-to study each lesson
before hearing it recited. By this course you will qualify
yourself the better to direct the proper emphasis, inflection,
and general expression; to detect any double or delicate
shade of meaning; and, what is of vital importance, you will
thereby increase your own interest in the lesson. No lesson
should be thought so simple and easy as not to need this
attention. Even the Primer and First Reader will be far
better taught from such previous study.
Study the Book you Teach.-Many teachers fail because they are not in sympathy with the book they use. Do
not follow any book slavishly; but if you neglect to study
the plan of your author until you catch his spirit and make
it your own, you had better change your text. If you
(63)INSTITUTE READER
possess no confidence yourself, you can inspire none in
your pupils.  The book may contain errors; if so, point
them out cautiously, but make no attack upon your author,
lest your pupils take the liberty of attacking your positions
and declarations.
Articulation.-This will require careful, constant, un
wearied attention.  In any good Third, Fourth, or Fifth
Reader will be found special exercises on this subject, which
ought, on no account, to be neglected. Remember they are
intended for dr'll exercises, and, therefore, be not satisfied
with pronouncing them once or twice, as though they were
merely to be read over, but take them up, one by one, and
repeat a dozen times, or until all in the class,an give them
correctly.  Attend to it, that the pupils pronounce with
carefuilness anzd energy.  A good test of a faithful observance of this direction, is the physical exhaustion produced;
if they do not become so weary with an eight minutes' drill
of this kind as to make it difficult to proceed further, without a change to reading or to entire rest, you may know
you are not drilling as you should.
Do not suppose, however, that you are to attend to articulation only while using the exercises specially selected for
this purpose. You can make drills in articulation, of sentences in the reading lessons, in the following manner: Select
a sentence, and direct it to be read with unusual distinctness,
so as to bring out clearly and fully every element, disregarding for the time the proper inflection and emphasis.
Concert practice may be made an efficient auxiliary in
these drills.  Designate some one of the class to pronounce
tL&gt; first word of the exercise, or to read the first sentence.
If he fails to satisfy you, pronounce it yourself, and then require the class to pronounce or read it in concert after the
model given; and, if necessary, repeat several times. Let
another pupil pronounce the next word of the exercise or
read the next sentence, the class repeating as before.
In this, as in all concert practice, the class should stand.
You will find it of advantage, also, to particularize. For
example, let the drill to-day be on the final elements, and,
64INTR OD UCTION.
while the general pronunciation is not neglected, let particular attention be paid to these; to-morrow, the initial elements may be made the subject of the lesson; at another
time, the vowel sounds. In this way, thoroughness will be
acquired, and monotony avoided. A fine exercise on the
vowel sounds is this: Choose a sentence, and pronounce
only the vowels of the syllables, but with precisely the
same emphasis, inflection, and force they would have received  had the consonants not been   dropped.   Little
difficulty will be experienced in awakening and sustaining an interest, for the exercise is amusing, and furnishes great variety, by affording the opportunity of
making selections from every style of expression and com-,position.
Finally, do not run to the extreme of imouthing. The
appearance of great effort to bring out elements with undue
force and prominence, is pedantic and thus offensive to
good taste. This is an extreme which many run into
almost unconsciously, and is, if possible, more objectionable than that of carelessness.
Thoroughness.- It is better to read one lesson well
than to pass indifferently over a dozen. The same is true
of sentences.  "Mitch, not many", should be the motto
observed. Keep your class drilling on a few well-selected
sentences, though you advance slowly through the book.
To this end, it will be well to devote the first five or ten
minutes of each recitation to. drill work, before beginning
the regular lesson.
One difficulty you will have to contend with is thie
prevalent, though mistaken notion, that the progress of
the pupil is in proportion to the number of pages and
books passed over. Reading in the Fifth Reader is considered evidence of greater ability to read than reading
in the Fourth or Third; and going through the Sixth is
synonymous with graduating in the art. To this opinion
you may have to yield to a degree; but you need not, and
you should not, compromise your own judgment, by conforming your method of teaching thereto. Keep the motto
I. R..--6.PREFACE.
TEACHERS' INSTITUTES are now held periodically in nearly every
county of the states in which Free Schools have been established;
and Normal Schools are annually increasing in number and influence. The Author's experience in such schools satisfies hlim that,
while there are many excellent works on Elocution, and numerous
valuable series of Readers, no single book has yet been presented to
the public which contains all the variety of exercises in the different
grades and styles that is necessary in presenting to teachers the subject,l How to teach Reading.
It is customary, in most Institutes, to use books fitted only for the
higher grades of our Common Schools, to illustrate the subject of
Primary, as well as advanced instruction in Reading. This is manifestly wrong-as much so as to use the Calculus to illustrate methods
of instruction in Primary Arithmetic.
In Normal Schools, it is more customary to use a series of Readers.
This is better, but more expensive, as only a small portion of each
book is needed for illustrative purposes.
It is mainly to meet this evident want of a reading book for training schools, that the present work has been prepared. The other
purposes'of the book are indicated by the following synopsis:
Part I. contains practical directioins to primlary teachers, followed
by exercises fromt the Priimler and First and Second Readers.
Part II. continues the directions, and contains a Manual of Articulation for drill purposes, and a series of reading lessons from the
Third, Fourth, and Fifth Readers.
(iii)INSTITUTE READER.
above given constantly in mind, and advance only rapi(lly
enough to prevent your pupils f'rom becoming discouraged.
From what has been said, it must not be inferred, however, that chere is no advantage in reading many pages.
On the contrary, it gives a readiness in calling words which
is essential to good reading, and which can be acquired in
no other way. The practice is objectionable only so far as
it leads to the substitution of quantity for quality. Encourage your pupils to read many lessons and many books outside of the recitation and the school-room.
What End is to be accomplished in Reading?
It is in place here to call particular attention to this question. We have just intimated that some regard the qua;ti'ty
read as constituting the basis of success. Others suppose
that it consists in elocution, or the ability to express audibly
to others, and in a clear and forcible manner, the words
and thoughts contained in the book. Now, it is not our
intention to lessen the importance of these things, but to
call attention to another very desirable end to be accomplished.
Pupils should be taught to remnemzber what they read, and
to express it in a connected and intelligible manner. The
relative importance of this acquisition and that of the ability
to read for the benefit of others, may be seen by comparing
what we read for our own information with what we read
for the entertainment of others. Is it not safe to say that
for every page we read aloud, we read a hundred silently?
Both attainments may be acquired, and both should demand
the attention of the teacher. Other things being equal, that,
pupil will read best who has studied his lesson so as to give
the substance of it in consecutive order, without the use of
the book.
How can this department be cultivated? In Readers,
the questions appended to each lesson are intended to assist
in this. In studying, pupils should be taught to remember
that they will be expected to answer all the questions as
well as to read the lesson. This plan, by question and answer, is a good one; but the knowledge thus obtained is
66INTtROD UCTIO-N.
likely to be fragmentary. Unity of thought and connectedness of ideas are absolutely essential to render knowledge of
practical utility..To assist in reaching this result, the following plan is suggested: Require your pupils to relate the
substance of the lesson in consecutive order. Sometimes
have a single pupil go over the whole of it, and when he
has done, call upon the class for criticisms or omissions of
important parts; at other times, call upon a pupil to begin
at the first, and when he has gone far enough, stop him,
and let another take up the subject at that point and continue it; so with the third and fourth, until all have been
called upon. If the pupils are young and timid, assist them
by an occasional question or suggestion.
Inquire for the Meaning.-Teach your pupils to inquire for the sense of the passage, and then to give it by
appropriate emphasis and inflection. The teacher ought
to be able to furnish a model of correct reading, and, while
insisting upon its being observed, should still judiciously
encourage originality in his pupils. When once a spirit of
inquiry is aroused, it begets interest, awakens thought, and
makes bold, manly readers, instead of slavish imitators.
Originality may be encouraged by the suggestions of the
teacher. For example: take the sentence, " This is a beautiful day". Read it: "This is a beautiful day". Ask if it
can be read so as to express a different meaning. One
responds, "This is a beautzjful day"; another, "This is a
beautiful day". It may be read as an exclamatory sentence,
as an interrogative one, in a tone of great amazement, in a
laughing manner; and so on, in different styles, arresting
tile attention of the class, and convincing them that reading
does not consist alone in calling words. Having once
awakened inquiry and interest, in this way, you can easily
transfer it to the sentences of the reading lesson.
How to Study a Reading Lesson.-- Teach a pupil
how to study, and you have put him at once upon the highroad to success; and yet few teachers ever give instruction
in this mo6t useful and essential part of an education.
07INSTITUTE READER.
In making their preparation, direct the pupils to first read
tlue lesson over, in order to get the story and its connections; then to return, and re-read the first paragraph more
carefully, and, if necessary, to repeat again sentence by
sentence, emphasizing the different words, until a reading is
decided upon, which seenis to express the fullest Imeaning.'I'his preparation should be made at home, where thev can
read aloud, thereby having the ear to assist the judgment in
determining the correct reading.  Never test the preparation by the number of times the pupil has read the lesson,
unless you know how t/orou,ghzly he has read it.
Marks and Pauses.-Pupils, from the beginning, ought
to be taught to recognize and name the more common
marks; and by the time they have completed the Fourth
Reader, they should possess a tolerably correct idea of
punctuaton and its use in reading. The distinction between grammatical and rhetorical pauses should next demand attention, for it is the key to the subject. The
former, indicated by various points, are essentially the
writer's, and are employed by him to convey his meaning.
It is by the latter, which usually are not indicated by marks
at all, that the meaning is expressed in reading. The old
method, therefore, of teaching to stop long enough at a
comma to count onze, at a semicolon long enough to count
two, etc., is not only an erroneous, but a forced method.
Pupils who have a clear conception of the distinction mentioned, and a correct idea of the. author's meaning, will
experience little difficulty in deciding where and how long
to pause.
Criticisms.-Objection is sometimes made to the practice of class criticism, that it encourages a spirit of faultfinding, on the part of putpils, toward one another. In
cases where such a spirit prevails, the teacher is often to
blame for it; for, by a few well-timed remarks, he may
check even a tendency in this direction, and awaken a
aesire for mnutual instruction.
When a pupil has finished a sentence or paragraph, call
68INTROD UCTION.
on members of the class individually for criticisms on the
emphasis, inflection, articulation, pronunciation, position
in standing, manner of holding the book, or any other real
fau/t; but allow no trifling. If any faults remain uncorrected, notice them yourself, and then direct the pupil to
re-read, making the corrections suggested.
An error many teachers fall into, is that of reqluiring
criticisms only on the miscalling of words. It is generally
a very marked defect to miscall, omit, or insert a word;
but errors of this kind frequently do not mar the beauty nor
injure the sense of the passage so much as a wrong inflection, a lifeless delivery, or even a repetition.
With the younger pupils, attending to too many things at
a time may distract the attention and confuse the mind.
You will, therefore, find it of advantage to devote one week
to criticisms on emphasis, another to criticisms on delivery,
and so on, until you have considered all departments.
Modulation.--This consists in that pleasing variety
which is at once both agreeable and forcible; but it is so
involved with other matters that it is difficult to treat of it
as a distinct department of reading. If the voice be well
developed and trained, and the inflection and emphasis be
properly attended to, modulation will need but little special
attention.
A close examination of most pieces of composition will
disclose the fact that there are many words and phrases
which are merely explanatory of the main ideas. Such
words and phrases, though they be not set off by the usual
parenthesis marks, are, nevertheless, parenthetical, and
should be read at a more rapid rate, and in a little lower tone
of voi;:e, than the other parts. Finding out the parenthetical portions should occupy a large share of the pupil's attention iwhile studying his lesson; and an observance of them
in reading will add materially to the beauty of the modulation, beside giving additional force to the meaning.
Manner of Reading Poetry.-The melody of verse
requires two kinds of pauses, peculiar to itself, in addition0INSTITUTE READER.
to the grammatical pauses: a slight one at the end of the
line, and the cxsural, at or neir the middle. W*\hen the
grammatical and caesural pauses coincide, but little difficulty
is experienced in reading verse.
Blank verse ought also to be read so as to make every
line distinct to the ear, else it differs in no way from prose,
and the poet has composed in numbers to no purpose.
When there is no pause in the meaning, at the end of
the line, it ought not to be marked by such a tone or inflection as is needed at the close of a sentence; but, without
fall or elevation, it should be denoted only by so slight a
suspension of sound as will distinguish one from  another
without injuring the meaning. A like suspension of the
sound should mark the cxesural pause.
To read poetry properly, one must have a correct idea
of the author's meaning, a lively appreciation of the sentiment, and an ear for melody; but, above all, he must avoid
the sing-song tone so commonly used.
Select Readings.-These consist of short selections
for reading, made by the pupils themselves from the Readers or from other sources, and are useful in awakening
enthusiasm, without which but little can be accomplished
in teaching.
The regular time allotted to reading may frequently be
set apart for this purpose, or an occasional half-day can not
be employed to greater adv?:ltage by the school.
If there should be a hes tancy about volunteering on the
part of those who most n,i d the drill, it would be well for
you to make appointment,. It will, perhaps, be necessary
also for you to make sele tions for the younger pupils and
for the backward ones: for it frequently occurs that childreIl
loss much time by indecision; and even when they have
made selections, they may have so little confidence in their
own judgmnent as to cause them to fail in the reading, T-he
aim of the teacher should be, not to relieve the pupil from
the exercise of judgment, but rather to encourage him in
it by judicious assistance.'10INTROD UCTION.
DECLAMATION.
Declamation beside being in every way, a valuable auxiliary to reading, serves the double purpose, also, of relieving the monotony of the regular school exercises, and imparting to the pupils confidence and self-possession.  Many
a man who now possesses the power of thirnking oan his feel
before an audience, owes it to the self-possession acquired
by declaiming in the school-room. Perhaps an injudicious
use of declamation has been injurious to some schools; but:he abuse, and not the use, is on that account to be condemned.
No doubt, a difficulty which teachers experience, is an
almost universal prejudice, on the part of pupils, against
declaiming. How to remove this prejudice, and get pupils
interested in the exercise, is the important matter. This
may be done by having a true conception of the end to be
accomplished, and by beginning right. Let the first exercises of this character be in the reading-class. Commence
with a single sentence or paragraph; let the class repeat it
in concert, in the most natural manner possible, making the
appropriate gestures, if any; afterward require the pupils to
repeat it separately. When you have succeeded, by this
means, in removing the novelty, and consequently the emharrasment, usually attached to declaiming, you can set
apart an occasional half-day, as was suggested with reference to select readings, and conduct the exercises according
to the customary method.
Selection.-Success in declamation depends, in a very
great degree, upon a proper selection; and boys and girls
of immature judgment, if left to themselves, are almost sure
to select pieces beyond their comprehension.  Place before
a boy a dramatic and a simple narrative piece of composition, from which to make a choice, and, in a majority of
cases, he will take the former. This does not appear so
strange, however, when we remember that he has, perhaps,
heard the same recited by a professional reader, or some
71INSTITUI'E READER.
one else, and has conceived the idea of imitating it. Generally the descriptive and narrative styles will be most
appropriate; for in these, the expression is simpler and
more easily comprehended, and without the comprehension,
no one can'succeed in rendering the sense by appropriate
emphasis, inflection, and delivery.
Delivery.-Be not ambitious to have your pupils shozo
off, but rather desire for them the accomplishments of naturalness and gracefulness.  Do not mistake sound for sense,
cant and rage for the earnestness of nature; for those who
do "are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb-show and
noise".  Many who might acquit themselves creditably in
plain recitation, spoil the effect by trying to be eloqueznt. In
declamation as in reading,
"He who in earnest studies o'er his part,
Will find true nature cling about his heart."
The delivery should be deliberate. With the eyes of tlhe
entire school upon him, the declaimer is apt to become
excited by the novelty of the situation, and is inclined
almost irresistibly to get through, and return to hIis seat
as soon as possible. To prevent the indistinct utterance
and imperfect observance of pauses into which he is so
likely to fall, aid him, by some means, to forget himself,
and -to become interested in what he has to say.  Criticise
the tone, and endeavor to have it not only pure, but
adapted to the style of composition also.
Gesture.-Do not attempt too much in gesture, but
what you do teach, teach thoroughly.  The great object to
be aimed at is gracefulness. All the movements of the beginner will be stiff and awkward, from the bow at the beginning to the bow at the close: practice only can overcome
these defects.  You will have but little success with individuals for a while; and as self-possession is the key to a
graceful and easy manner, you can not more easily cultivate
this quality than by class drills in movements.
The teacher standing in front of the class, all speak the
72INTROD UCTTON.
words, around, beneath, on hizh; and on pronouncing each
word, make the appropriate gesture. Also use the hand and
arm, without pronouncing words: the teacher counts, and
the class execute the movements together.  First, move the
hand, the wrist bending; next, the forearm, bending it at the
elbow; then move the whole arm at the shoulder. The art
of graceful gesticulation lies in keeping the muscles moderately relaxed.  When the gesture is completed, do not
allow the hand to faS to the side, as though it were lifeless;
neither bring it down stiffly; but let it return to its place in
a graceful manner.
The manner of bringing up the hand is significant.
Generally the hand should be raised above the place where
it is intended to stop, and brought down to it with more or
less energy, according to the sentiment. It should reach
the emphatic rest precisely on the emphatic word.
As a rule, oratorical gestures should be executed in easy,
graceful curves; invective, in straight lines and angles.
The movements of the feet, as well as those of the
hands, must be looked after. While too much stepping in
declamation is objectionable, as giving the appearance of
rant, too little, on the other- hand, conveys the impression
of stiffness.
The following will afford sufficient variety for drill purposes: Standing with the heels together, the toes turned
outward, step obliquely to the front, with the right foot in
the direction the toe points, and bring the left foot to the
right, the two occupying the same relative position as before the movement. In returning, each foot passes through
the same movement as in advancing, only the order is
reversed. Go through the same movements, beginning with
the left foot.

VOCALS.
VOCALS consist of pure tone.  In enunciating tllem, care
should be taken to have a free, expansive opening of the
mouth; and strict attention should be given to the position
of the teeth, tongue, and palate.
A good method for obtaining the position of the organs,
in uttering these sounds, is to pronounce the words of the
Chart in a full affirmative tone. To assist in secturing this
tone, prefix the words, "I said"'' to the words of the Chart.
After the sound of the element has been secured in connection with the consonants, (lrop the consonants both before

SUB VOCALS.
Subvocals consist of tone and breath united.  Care will
be necessary for their forcible enunciation.
To secure their sounds, and the position of the organs 111
uttering them, take words in which they occur as final elements, and pronounce the nord forcibly, dwelling on the
element. When the proper sound of the element has thus
been secured in connection with the sound of the other
letters, drop the latter, and repeat the sound of the element
alone. Practice on it in concert.

A BOY was once taking care of some sheepl,

there was any danger.
One day, in order to have some ftn, he
cried out, with all his might, "The wolf is

The men came running with clubs and
axes, to destroy the wolf. As they saw nothing, they went home again, and left John

THE BIRTI-IDAX' PRIFSEiNTO
LATE in the morning' of her cousin Ellen's
birthday,  Susan   finished  her  work-basket
The carriage was at the door.     Her father's
voice was heard calling her.

So she was obliged to go down, with her
basket but half wrapped   up in a piece of
paper.
As the carriage went on, Susan l)ulled the
paper by each of the four corners, first one
side, cand t.hen the other, to hide the basket.
Flatl/er. It will never do, my dear.  I am
afraid you wvill never mlnake a sheet of paper

A FABLE.
A FABLE is a story in which animnals or
other objects are supposed to talk, although
they never do so.
The moral of a fable. is the instruction to
be drawn from    it.  Hcre is the fable of the
cats and the monkey:
7188              ~INSTITUTE READER.
Two hungry cats, having stolen sonle cheese,
could not agree how to divide it. So they
called in a monkey, to decide thle case.
"Let me see", says the monkey, with an
arch look; "this slice weighs more than th(e
other". With that, he bit off a large piece,
in order, as he said, to make them balance.
The other scale was now too heavy.   This
gave the upright judge a fine pretense to
take a second mouthful.
"Hold! hold!" cried the two cats; "give
each of us his share of the rest, and we will
be content''.
"If you are content", say-s the monkey,
"justice is not.  The law, Imy friends, must
have its course"
So he nibbledl first one Ipiece, and then
the other. The lioor cats, seeing their cheese
in a fair way to be all eaten, most humbly
begged the judge to give himself no fuirther
trouble.SELECTIONS.
"Not so fast, I beseech you, my friends ",
says the judge; "we owve justice to ourselves
as well as to you.    What is left, is due to
me in riglht of my office".
So saying, he crammed tile whole into his
mouth, and very gravely dismissed the court.
MORAL.
This fable teaches us that it is better to
bear slight wrong, rather than to resort to
law for trifles.

To decide the nmatter, they agreed to try
their power on a tra, eler.  That party which
should first strip him  of his cloak was to
win the day.
The Wind began.    He blew a cutting blast,
which tore up the mountain     oaks by their
roots, and made the whole forest look like
a wvreck.
But the traveler, though at first he could
scarcely  keep his cloak   on his back, ran
under a hill for shelter, alld   buckled  his
mantle about himl more closely than evrer.
T'he Wind, having    thus trlied his utmost
powver in vain, the Sun began.
Bursting.through a thick cloud, he darted
his sultry beams so forcibly upon the traveler's ]lhead, that the poor fellow w\as almost
mlelted.
"This", said he, "is past all bearing.   It
is so hot that one might as well be in an
oven ".
So he quickly threw     off his cloak, and
went under the     shade   of a tree   to  cool
hilnself.
