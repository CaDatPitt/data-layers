APPENDIX

TO

ELEMENTS OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR.

To the Teacher. — Our object has been, in this little treatise, ta
render the pupil familiar with some of the most obvious facts and
princzples of language, while we have purposely avoided any refer-
ence to distinctions of etymology, syntax, &c. So much of the

_ Appendix may be explained and made familiar to the pupil as each
individual teacher may think proper.

GRAMMAR is usually considered under four general divisions.

Ortlzcgraphy treats of the powers of letters, singly and combined
in syllables and words;

Etymology treats of words divided into classes, and of the changes
made in their forms.

Syntax treats of words in sentences, and of their connection.

Prosody treats of utterance, and of the arrangement of syllables
in verse.

The powers of letters, singly and combined, are taught in spelling
books, &c.

The utterance of words is practically considered in elementary and

scientiﬁc Works on elocution.

Neither orthography ‘nor prosody is considered in this small trea-
tise, which aims solely to make the pupil comprehend the construc-
tion of language, that he may read and write understandingly.

they are used; that

Words used as names are nouns.

Words used to describe nouns are adjectives.

Words used to tell how, when, or where an
action is performed, are adverbs. I

Words used before nounsand pronouns to
connect them with some other word are prepo-
sitions.

Words used to connect sentences, and prevent"

the repetition of What is the same in each, are
conjunctions.

Words used to imply emotion or feeling; with-

out asserting it, are interjections.

V suggests to the mindithe object of which we are speaking, another describe:-

the object, another asserts something of the object, and another qualiﬁes tha
assertion in respect to time, place, and manner.

This exercise in itself is admirably calculated to impart quickness, accuracy,
and intensity, of thought and expression. Professor Gibbs says, “ There can he
no exercise in the whole business of instruction more’useful to the mind, than
the analysis of sentences in the concentrated light of grammar and logic. It
brings one into the sanctuary of human thought. All else is but standing in
the outer court.”-

The sentences which we have instanced are, it is true, very simple, and the
sense very obvious. It is sufficient to say that they are intended for children,
whose thoughts are simple, and whose minds are untrained to any severe
exercise of the powers of discrimination, classification, or abstraction. They
are intended also for illustration, and are therefore better, even for adults, than
sentences, where no new classes or relations are used, but only where these
relations are less obvious. That, certainly, is the best illustration of a princi~
ple, which contains it in its simplest and most transparent form--a fact, it
would seem, not always recognized by teachers. (

To the Teacher. — Our object hitherto has been chieﬂy to render
the pupil familiar with the various classes of words, and the proper-
teles of each, -1101: by deﬁnitions couched in terms which he can-
not understand, but by a natural and easy analysis of simple forms
of expression with which every child is supposed to be familiar.
The relations of words to each other have been considered only so far
as their classiﬁcation depends on these relations. Thus the nature
of the adjective and adverb can be shown only by the relations which
they sustain to the noun, verb, &c. We now propose to illustrate
the various relations in which words may be used, as also the rela-
tion of clauses in compound sentences, -- deducing therefrom the
most obvious principles of syntax.

Thechild who says that “ William is gooder than John,” has learned the _

reg-ular formation of the comparative degree, and is ignorant only of the excep-
tion. When he says, “ mans ” for “ men,” and “ runned ” for “ ran,” he
shows that he recognizes the regular formation of the plural of nouns, as well
as that of the past tense of verbs. He has already begun to make a grammar
of the language, and merely wants encouragement and guidance to accom-
plish his task. '

bedone in a text book, trusting to the judgment of the teacher to carry out
