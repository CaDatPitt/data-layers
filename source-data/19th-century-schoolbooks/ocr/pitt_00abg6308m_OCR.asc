,1. A number which is not applied to any object is called
an Abstract Number.   A
Thus,’ 9, 4%,  are abstract numbers.
2. A number whi.ch ‘iiidepviiceapplied to some speciﬁed object
is called a Concrete Number.
' Thus,9 trees, 43],» pies, -3 of an apple are concrete numbers.

* Write 1 for a denominator, thus JT“-.

DENOMINATE NUMBERS. 109

  3. A concrete number which represents moneg, weight
or measure is called a Deiioaninctte Number. T
Thus,9 pounds, 4% pints, $% are denominatenumbers.

4. In denominate numbers the ‘diﬂ°erent orders of

money, Weight or measure are called Denozninations.

Thus,dolla.rs, dimes, cents, andmillss are denominations .

_ of money.   L I
 Abstract and concrete numbers, and denominate
numbers of butone clenomination are called Simple
Numbers.   l T g  r s
T Thus, 9, 4% melons, 33% are simple numbers.

5.6, A denominate number When composed of two or
more related denominations is called a‘._Co1npo*und
Number. I « -  

Thus, 4 gallons 2 quarts is a compound number.

'7. The denominations in acompound number Which
express the greater amount are called Higlier‘ De-
nominations. s a l  

«Thus,a gallon is a /ziglzer denomination than a ‘quart.

8; The denominations in a compound number which
express the less amount are called Lower Denomi-
nations. « e s

Thus,a quart is a lower denomination than a gallon.

1. Dollars and cents written as one number are sepa-
rated by a dot  ; thus, $4.25 means 4 dollars 25 cents.
2. When more than 9 cents and less than 100 cents are
written alone they may be expressed by placing the dot

.’ How many cents in 20 m.? 40 m. ? 60 m.? 80 m.? 2

between the sign $3 and the number: thus, $.25 means 25 4

cents.  
3. When less than 10 cents are written alone there must
be a naught placed between the numberand the dot,
because cents occupy two . places ; thus, $.O5_II1eans 5 cents.
4.. Mills are written after cents; thus, $4.255 means 4
dollars 25 cents 5 mills. 5 mills are 45’ ; $4.255 -: $54.25;.

5. When dollars and mills are given, cents’ places must i
be ﬁlled with nauglzts; thus, $4.005 means 4 dollars 5

All the remaining written etcercises in the fundamental rules, which
extend to page 92, are so fully explained and illustrated as to require

' no further attention here. All that is necessary to make your pupils
‘apt and accurate in all these fundamental operations is thorough and

constant drill. ,

These operations are the basis of all arithmetical calculations, and
the.» after success of your pupils ‘Will depend largely upon the
thoroughness with which you have taught these elementary prin- _'
ciples. _ »

FI’act'i01vs —(Page 92.) You will ﬁnd all the operations of
-fractions, ‘Which are presented, so fully explained in the body of the
book as to render it unnecessary to make any further explanatory
remarks in these pages. Forms of solution are given and explained
for. both oral‘ and Written exercises, and an examination of thesewill,
it is thought, give you all the information you may need.

Denominate Nwmbers,—(Page 108.) Your attention is
called to the explanation of reduction descending and ascending,
given on page 118. 1 This explanation is very full and complete, and

willserve as a form .for the solution of all succeeding problems in
‘ Reduction. It has not been thought necessary to "repeat this expla-
‘ nation under each table, as the form in ‘each case is precisely the same..

a diﬁerence in the multiplier or divisor under each table ,' but the form '

of solution in other respects is.the same. A thorough lmowledge of the

tables of Denominate numbers is of absolute importance. You are
therefore most earnestly recommended to take special pains in teach-

ing them. The pictures accompanying the tables Will be found of

-invaluable service in aiding your pupils to comprehend the character -

and value of the weights and measures mentioned in the various tables.
Many of these weights and measures you can, by a little trouble,
and perhaps expense, secure; and you will feel fully recompensed for
both by the interest which youwill thus awaken in your pupils. _’

time, reach the end ; when you will have the satisfaction of having
accomplished a journey not to be retrodden. ’ '

THE aim of this little book is to give children commencing the Study of
Arithmetic a clear conception of the E’lementary-0ombinations of Numbers. A

Whilst‘ it is not designed for children unable to read, it is nevertheless sulﬁ-
ciently elementary to be studied and -understood by pupils completing the First
or commencing the Second Reader. ,

This work, which constitutes the first of a Series of two books, is 'from’begin-
ning toend, steadily and easily progressive, thus leading the pupil by gradual
and successive steps from the known to the unknown, from the simple to the
more complete, until he has acquired a knowledge of all that the book contains.

The First Lesson on Page?) is -accompanied by.an illustration which aims to A

aid the pupil in acquiring Well-deﬁned conceptions of the numbers from One
to Ten. - ‘ .

On the page immediately following is presented a Table which, is intended to
exhibit the method of representing or expressing numbers from one to one hun-
dred by words, ﬁgures, or letters.

This Table is followed by Exercises in Reading and Writing numbers to one
hundred. ‘ - . . - V '

The subject of Oounting as presented on Pages 9. and 10 is thought to be a
valuable feature of this work, and complete as we" as Qft_repeated drills in these
exercises are most earnestly recommended.

The illustration introducing the Lesson on Counting will naturally suggest A
the.importance_as well as the necessity of using tangible objects in connection

with each exercise. .

The method of presenting and illustrating the diﬁ'erent Signs used in the
Fundamental Rules, will, it is believed, not only merit and receive the favor of
teachers, but will materially aid the pupil in acquiring a knowledge of the object
and use of these symbols. - . ‘

A tlllmbel‘ Of the - exilmples. in the Lesson immediately following ‘the illustra-.

tions in the Fundamental Rules, has direct reference.to the objects presented

- in the illustrations, so that these pictures are not merely “ things of beauty” to

adorn the pages, but efficient aids to the pupil in his endeavors to obtain correct
elementary ideas ofithe Science of Arithmetic.  v

The -examples in Addition intended for oral exercises present all the com-

binations found in the Addition Table, Whilst the written exercises present the
same numbers used in reverse order,——thus producing the same combinations.

The object of this arrangement is to establish deﬁnitely and clearly in the mind

of the child the fact that the sum of two or more numbers is the same in what-
ever order they may'be"'united. Thus, the sum of 2 and 1; is the same as the
sumqfbanaz.  t -

It is conﬁdently believed that the numerous exercises, both oral and written,
which are given in the Fundamental Rules, and the eﬂ‘ective drill which these

_ exercises afford, will not only make the pupil familiar with the Tables, but will

ﬁx them and their various combinations indelibly upon his mind.

Special attention is directed to the manner of _presenting the subject of
Notation and Numeration. _The plan _is altogether new and will it is thought
commend itself to progressive Teachers.

Following Notation and Numeratipn there is given a more thorough and
complete but steadily progressive presentation of the principles underlying the
Fundamental Rules. The exercises are altogether written, and the methods are
explained and simpliﬁed in such a way as to make them perfectly clear and
intelligible to the pupil.

Considerable space is occupied in the exempliﬁcation and presentation of
Fractions, but not more it is believed than the importance of the subject de-
mands. All the dilferent processes are given, but in a manner so perspicuous as
to" bring them entirely within the range of the pupil’s comprehension. Factor-
ing, Least Common Multiple and Greatest Common Divisor as such, are not
consideredin connection with the treatment of fractions,~as these subjects are

thought to be beyond the ability of the pupils for whom this book is designed.

Notation and Reduction of Fractions, however, as -well as all the operations

I t which have thus far characterized Whole Numbers, are presented in simpliﬁed
_form and thus brought within the scope of the pupil’-s intellectual powers. The

eicplanations and illustrations presented in connection with the treatment of
Fractions, together with the assistance of a judicious teacher, cannot fail to make
the mastery of the subject comparatively easy. _

Much care has been exercised in the arrangement of the Tables of Denomi-

‘ hate‘ Numbers,,an'd it is believed that the completeness which characterizes
these Tables, aswell as the illustrations exemplifying them, will command. the‘? '

 

favorable judgment of every thoughtful and intelligent Teacher.

‘A , It affords the Author great pleasure to acknowledge his indebtedness to H. I. A

GOURLEY and J. M. LOGAN, Principals in the Pittsburgh Schools, for eﬁective

aid and valuable suggestions in the plan and preparation of this work,-their-.

experience, ability, andzeal, together with the liberality of the Publishers, have
contributed largely to the successful completion of the work.

DIVISION. 67

EQUAL PARTS or NUMBERS. ‘

LESSON II.

In the preceding ‘exercises in Division the pupil has
been taught how to ﬁnd the number of t7}mes one number

is contained in another of the same kind. None but like

nmnbers have been presented in any of the examples

thus far.
It frequently happens, however, that we are required to

ﬁnd One of the Equal Parts of a number. ' To do this we

use the same operation, but our manner of reasoning is
somewhat different. I l

The difference in these two branches of Division will
be readily understood from the solution of the following
examples, in one of   which the numbers are alike and in
the other unit/ee. 4 I

1. At 2 cents each, how many peaches can be bough
for 4 cents ? c —

Solution. —2 cents are contained in 4 cents 2
times. Therefore, 2 peaches can be bought for 4 cts.

2. Two peaches cost 4 cents. What does 1 peach" cost?

So1ution.——Stnce 2 peaches cost 4 cents, I peach
costs one-‘half of 4 cents, or 2 cents. Therefore,
1 peach costs 2 cents. ‘ ‘ \

T0 ﬁnd One-half of a number divide by 2.
   

8 —i— 2 : 4, 4 or One-halfof 8 is 4.
If 2 pies cost 10 cents, what does 1 pie cost?
What is one-half of 4? of 16? of‘ 18? of 14?,
If 2 cakes cost 6 cents, what does 1 cake cost?
What is one-half of 2'? of 8? of 20?’ of 12?"
