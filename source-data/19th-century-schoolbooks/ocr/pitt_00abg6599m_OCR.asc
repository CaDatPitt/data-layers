LESSON V.
1. A and B have 25 oranges; how many has each, if
B has 5 more than A?
SOLUTION.-By a condition of the problem, A's number + 5
apples equals B's number, which, added to A's, is twice A's
ilumber + 5, which equals 25 oranges. If twice A's + 5 = 25,
twice A's = 25 - 5, or 20; if twice A's = 20, once A's equals
i of 20, which is 10; and since B had 5 more than A, 10 + 5,

THE problems -should be read by the teacher and
assigned promisetously, pupils being prohibited to use
the book during recitation. The pupil selected should
arise, repeat the problem, and:give the solution. At the
close of the solution, those who:have observed mistakes
may indicate it by raising the hand, and then some one
appointed by the teacher should arise,and give the criticism. It will be found that the habit of criticism, when
properly indulged, is most beneficial; awakening a laudable spirit of emulation, cultivating exactness of thought
and expression, antind infusing;spirit and interest into the
recitation. The attitude, articulation, pronunciation, and
graim'atical construction, tre all appropriate subjects of
criticism.
The teacher -'shbiild call the:,attention of pupils, particularly' to the derivation of methods in Fractions, by
Induction from the results of the solutions, and after
becoming familiar with the analysis, they should use the
method, to avoid the continual labour of analysing. If
the questions given for this purpose are not sufficient, let
others, similar, be asked by the teacher.MENTAL ARITHMETIC.

INTEREST.
Interest is money charged for the use of money or property.
It is estimated at a certain rate per cent., per annum.
The Principal is the sum on which interest is computed.
The Amount is the sum of the principal and interest.
The Rate per cent. is the interest of 100 for one year.
In computing interest we shall consider 30 days to the month,
and 12 months to the year.
1. Reduce 2 years and 6 months to tihe fraction of a
year.
SOLUTION.-In 1 yr. there are 12 monlths, hence 1 month is
11 of a year, and 6 months are 6 times 1, which are 6i, or X
of a year, which, added to 2 years, equals 2, or _ years.

THE science of Arithmetic,-as taught in our schools
until, quite recently, has been far from beneficial in-its
influence upon the minds of learners. Consisting mainly
-of dictated methods of deriring results, without presenting the reasons for the various operations, it failed to
afford that high.degree of mental discipline, which, when
properly taught, it is so well calculated to impart. But
a great change has been wrought in this respect-a new
era has dawned upon the world of science-the royal road
to -Mathematics has been so graded and strewn with the
flowers of reason and philosophy, that it is now- full of
interest and profit to the youthful learner;-and one of
the most influential agents in this work has been the
system of Mental Arithmetic. -
The present is a proud period in the history of popular
education. At no previous time has there been so deep
and universal an interest manifested in the advancement
of the cause; and this, combined with the elevation of
the standard of qualification among our teachers, has
created a demand for a more philosophic, systematic,

LESSON V.
1. A man receives $3 a day for his labour, and forfeits
$1 each day he is idle, and at the expiration of 30 days
receives $50; how many days was he idle?
SOLUTION.-Had he laboured 30 days, he would have received
30 times $3, or $90; he therefore lost $90 - $50, which is $40,
by his idleness. Every day he was idle he lost $3, his wages,
plus $1, his forfeit, which: are $4. If in one day he lose $4, to
lose $1 it will require i of a day, and to lose $40, 40 times 4,
which are 10 days, the number of days he was idle.

long as the head and tail both; required the length of
the fish.
SOLUTION.-Since the tail is as long as the head, 4- 1 of the
body, _1 of the length of the body, + 10 inches, equals the length
of the tail, which, added-to the length of the head, equals 1 of
the length of the body, + 20 inches, which, by the condition of
the problem, equals 2 of the length of the body. If'of the
length of the body equals 1 of the length of the body, -20,
_or 1 of the length of the body, must equal 20 inches, &amp;c.

LESSON VI.
1. Henry is 35 years old, and Mary is 5; in how many
years will Henry be only 6 times as old as Mary?
SOLUTION.-At the required time, 6 times Mary's age will
equal Henry's age; then 6 times' Mary's age, which is Henry's
age, minus Mary's age, equals 5 times Mary's age, which equals
the difference between their ages, which is 35 - 5, or 30 years.
If 5 times Mary's equals 30 years, once her age equals 1 of 30
years, which is 6 years. Hence when Mary is 6 years old Henry
will be 6 times as old as she, but Mary is now 5, therefore in
6- 5, or 1 year, Henry will be 6 times as old as AMary.

Arithmetic, than has hitherto been presented;-and, at
the solicitation of his friends, the author of the present
work has attempted to meet that demand; how successfully, must be determined by those whose province it is to
decide.
In the prosecution of this object he has availed himself
of the experience of several years of actual instruction in
the science, and of the careful examination of what has
been previously written, for the purpose of ascertaining
wherein improvements might be made.   He does not
assume, that every problem, or class of problems or the
principle of every solution, is original with himself; as
every intelligent teacher knows that certain problems and
solutions have stood the test of years, and no book would
be fapltless without them. The object, has been not to be,merely originalj but to prepare a suitable and: valuable
text book; he feels confident, however.that it will be
found to: contain sufficient distinct and original features
to recommend it to the favourable consideration of the
friends of education....., The work, like others of the same class, is not designed
for, the child's first book in the science of'numbers, and,
therefore, the more elementary operations have not been
uselessly enlarged upon; yet the arrangement is so systematic, and the transition from the easy to the complex so
gradual,'that even very young pupils can pursue it with
ease and advantage.:A sstem of Mental Arithmetio should be based upon

LESSON VII.
1. A's age equals 3 times B's, but in 10 years A's age
will be only twice B's; how old is each?
SOLUTION.-By the first condition of the problem, 3 times B's
age equals A's age, and, in 10 years, 3 times B's age, now, + 10
years, will equal A's, and once B's, now, + 10 years, will equal
B's; but A's age at that time is twice B's; hence 2 times (B's,
now, + 10) which is twice B's + 20-= 3 times B's'+ 10, therefore 3 B's, now, -2 B's, now, which is B's, at present time,
equals 20 - 10, or 10 years, and A's is 3 times 10, or 30 years.

LESSON VIII.
1. What is the time of day, providing a of the time
past midnight equals the time to noon?.SOLUTION.-BY the condition of the problem, I of the time
past midnight equals the time to noon, which, added to ~ of the
time past midnight, equals 3 of the time past midnight, which
equals the time from midnight to noon, or 12 hours. If 3 of the
time past midnight equals 12 hours,,=  of 12 hours, which
is 4, and 2 = 2 times 4, or 8 hours, the time past midnight.
Hence, it is 8 o'clock in the morning.

13. Required the hour of day, providing a of the time
to midnight equals 2 of the time to noon.
14. What time, after 12 o'clock, are the hour and
minute hands of a watch exactly together?
REDRARK.-It will be seen that the minute hand gains on the
hour hand 11 spaces in going 12; hence, to gain 1 space, the
distance they are apart at I o'clock, it must go the 1-of 12
spaces, which is 1 2 spaces, equal to 5-5- minutes.
15. What time, after 2 o'clock, are the hour and
minute hands of a clock together?
16. A man being asked the hour of the day, replied,

134MENTAL ARITHMETIC.:-gold:he has $4 of silver; how much gold must be added
that there may be $9 of gold for $3 of silver?
REMARlK.-Since the gold is to the silver as 6 to 4, and there
are $20 in all, we find there are $12 of gold and $8 of silver.
After the addition, since 3 times the silver equals the gold, 3
times $8, or $24, is the gold, and $24-$12, or $12, equals
the amount added.
20. A man has 40 pieces of money, consisting of copper

LESSON IX.1. How far may a person ride in a coach, which goes
at the rate of 10 miles an hour, so that he may be gone
but 8 hours, providing he walks home at the rate of 6
miles an hour?
SOLvUTIN.--If he walks 6 miles in 1 hour, to walk 1 mile it
will require 1 of an hour, and to walk 10 miles, the distance he
rides in an hour, it will require 10 times g = I, or 5, of an
hour, hence 5 of the time he rides equals the time he walks,
which added to 3, the time he rides, equals 8 of the time he
rides, which is 8 hours, &amp;c.

mixture may be worth 9 shillings a pound?
SOLUTION.-If I take 1 lb. at 6s., and sell it for 9s., I will gain
9--6, or 3s., and to gain ls..I must take  - of a pound;. if I
take 1 lb. at lls., and sell it for 9s., I lose 11 -9, or 2s., and
to lose ls. what I gained on the first, I.must take 4 of a pound;
hence I must take 4 of a pound at 6s. as often as 4 a pound at

LESSON XI,
1. A lady bought two watches and a chain. The chain
and gold watch cost 4 times as much as the silver watch,
and the chain and silver watch cost twice as much as the
gold watch.  What is the value of each, if the silver
watch -is worth $30?
SOLUTION.-By the first condition of the problem 4 times $30,
or $120, equals the cost of the gold watch and chain, which
added to $30, the cost of the silver watch, is $150, the cost of
the two watches and chain. By the second condition, twice the
cost of the gold watch equals the cost of the silver watch and
chain, which, added to the cost of the gold watch, equals 3 times
the cost of the gold watch, which equals the cost of all, or $150.

LESSON XII.
1. Two men, A and B, in partnership gain $300. A
owns X of the stock, lacking. $40 and gains $180; required the whole stock, and share of each.
SOLUTION.-If A had owned X of the stock, his gain would
have been 2 of $300, or $200; but he gained only $180, therefore the $40 must gain the difference between $200 and $180,
which is $20. If $40 gain $20, to gain $1 it will require
4 of $40, which is $2, and to gain $30Q it will require 800
times $2, which are $600.

REMAREK.-By the method of interest we find that X of A's
share is equal to the equal amount, and A of B's share equals
the same. If 1: of A's share = the eqTzal amount, 4 of his sharo
4                             4
is I of the equal ameort, and 4, or A's share, =  of the same
amount. In the same way we show that B's share = 4 of the
equal amount: hence, the two parts- are to each other.as 4 of
the equal amount to 4 of the same amount, or as - to 5; hence,
the fortune should be divided into two parts, to each other as
4 to 4, &amp;c.

149derived -from  these processes by Induction.  At the
close of Fractions, some of these methods are stated in
the form of Propositions, and their truth substantiated
by demonstration, in a manner different from any which
the author has met with, and which he has employed in
teaching, with entire satisfaction. In nearly every section
of the book will be found matter not previously introduced
into works of this kind, and much that has never before
been published. Questions upon definitions and principles
are given in various parts of- the work, without answers to
them, the object being to awaken original thought with
the pupil, which is deemed far- more valuable than the
most accurate definition.
But it is impossible, as well as unnecessary, -to call the
attention to all the different peculiarities of the work,
since intelligent teachers, upon examination, will see and
judgeX for themselves. The whole, with its merits and
demerits, is respectfully submitted to the public, with
the. sincere wish that it may prove a valuable auxiliary
in the promotion of that noble science, which promises
so much for the advancement of the great cause of popular education.

SECTION III.
LESSON I.
The number of parts into which anything is divided, instead
of being expressed by a word, may be represented by a figure
beneath a line, thus:*   represents halves,    4 represents fourths,
3 represents thirds,. represents fifths.
The number of fractional parts taken may be represented by
a figure above the line, thus:--
2 represents 2 fourths,   4 represents 5 sevenths,
3 represents 3 fifths,    7 represents 7 eighths,
represents 4 sixths,       represents 4ninths.
These expressions are called fractions. A fraction is an expression denoting one or more of the equal parts into which a
unit may be divided. The word fraction is also used, meaning
a part or collection of equal parts of a unit, or the relation of a
part or parts to the unit.
The number below the line is the denominator, which shows
the number of equal parts into which the unit is divided.MENTAL ARITHMETIC.                49
The number above the line is the numerator, which shows the
number of equal parts taken.
A proper fraction is one whose numerator is less than the denominator; as, 4.
An improper fraction is one whose numerator is equal to or
greater than the denominator; as, 4. 7
A mixed number consists of a whole number and a fraction;
as, 24, 3  D
The reciprocal of a number is a unit divided by that number;
thus the reciprocal of 4 is 1; of 7 is 1.

We have derived the principles of the following propositions
by induction from analytical processes; we will now proceed to
establish their truth by rigid demonstration.
PROP. 1.--Mllidtiplying the numerator of a fraction by any number nzultiplies the value of the fraction by that number.
PROP. 2.-Dividing the numerator of a fraction by any nsumber
divides the value of the fraction by that number.
PRop. 3.-A- ultiplying the denominator of a fraction by any
nzmmber divides the valsee of the fraction by that nusLmber.
PROP. 4.-Dividing the denominator of a fraction by any number
mvultliJlies the valtue of the fraction by that num;ber.
76MENTAL ARITIIMETIC.
PROP. 5.--iulti7lying both numerator and denominator of a
fraction by any number does not change the value of the fraction.
PROP. 6.-Dividing both numerator and denominator of a fraction by any number does not change the value of the fraction.
The first and second Propositions need no demonstration, since
it is as evident that 2 tinmes 4 fifths (4 are 8 fifths (8j, or
of 4 fifths (4) is 2 fifths (i_), as that 2 times 4 apples are 8
apples, or _ of 4 apples is 2 apples.
In the demonstration of the third and fourth, we will let the
letter n represent any number whatev.er.
DEMONSTRATION OF TIHE THIRD.--Since the denominator denotes the number of equal parts into which the unit is divided,
if we multiply it by any number (n), the unit will be divided into
n times as many equal parts, hence each part will be n times as
small, or  as large, as before, and, the same number of parts
being taken, the value of the fraction is! as great. Therefore, &amp;e.
DEMONSTRATION OF TfHE FOURTHi.-Since the denominator denotes the number of equal parts into which the unit is divided,
if we divide it by any number (n), the unit will be divided into
-only s as many parts, hence each part will be n times as great
as before, and the same number of parts being taken, the value
of the fraction will be multiplied by n. Therefore, &amp;c.
DEMONSTRATION OF THE FIFTH.--Since multiplying the nuimerator multiplies the value, and- multiplying the denominator
divides the value of the fraction, multiplying both numerator
and denominator by the same number, multiplies and divides
the value by'the same number, and hence does not change its
value. Therefore, &amp;c.
The sixth proposition is demonstrated the same as the fifth.
REMIARK.-If any pupils are unable to generalize sufficiently
to understand the demonstration of the third and fourth propositions, special numbers may be employed in place of n, but'the demonstration will then lose its general character.
