Is it to cultivate the intellect? This is not
enough. It must also strengthen the moral prin-
ciples, and regulate the affections. It must ﬁt
for the peculiar duties that devolve upon us. It
must keep in just balance, and bring forth to
healthful action, all the powers that the Creator
has given us.

A good education, is that which prepares us for
our future sphere of action. A warrior or a
statesman, require a different kind of training
from a mother, or the instructress of a school.
A lady who has many accomplishments, yet is
deﬁcient in the science of housekeeping, has not
been well educated.

A good education makes us contented with our
lot. This,was what an ancient philosopher said,
made him happy in an obscure abode, and when
he was alone, talked with him. A restless, and
complaining temper, proves a bad education.

Agood education is a fortune in itself. I do
not mean that it will always secure wealth. But
it brings something better than the gold that
perishes. For this may be suddenly lost. Fire
may consume it. [Water may overwhelm it.
The tempest may destroy it. The thief may
take it away.

But that knowledge which enriches the mind,
which moderates its desires, which teaches to
make a right use of time, and to promote the
happiness of others, is superior to the elements.

100 THE emL’s READING‘-BOOK.

During my visit to this happy family, when I
looked round upon the healthful faces of its
growing members, their ‘patient diligence, their
moderated desires, their cheerful “subordination
to their parents, and saw those parents, not
wasting their strength in the idle ceremonies of
fashionable life, but true hearted and hospitable,
independent and pious—-I said, this is the true
order of nobility for a republic, andif the virtue
that upholds it should ﬂy from the pomp of cities,
she will be found sheltered insafety and honour,
amid the farm-houses of our land.

LETTER TO THE FEMALES OF GREECE.

WHEN Greece was passing through the revo-
lution, by which it gained freedom from the
Turkish yoke, great pity was felt in the United
States, for the sufferings of its inhabitants.
Especially was the sympathy of our females
excited, for the miseries that the war brought
-upon their own sex.

They were represented in continual terror of
their Turkish oppressors, often forced from their
own homes, scantily clothed, and wretchedly
feeding, with their children, upon the snails and
meagre herbage of the barren mountains, whither
they were driven.

The letters of Dr. Howe, now the Principal
of the Institution for the Blind, in Boston, power-
fully described their sorrows and their patience.
His residence in Greece had rendered him
familiar with the evils which he related, and his
appeal to the bounty of his native land was not
in vain. T

Vessels were freighted with provisions and
clothing, and trusty agents sent out to distribute

them. Not only in the larger cities, but in the T

102 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

villages of our country, the spirit of benevolence
was awake and active. 1 The cry of Greece seem-
ed to enter into every ear.

Donations were given. Contributions were
gathered. Ladies formed societies, and consult-
ed how the money thus collected, might be best
disposed of, for the beneﬁt of Greece. Even the
poor, believed that they had a garment to spare,
and brought it with tears, for the poorer women
of Greece.

Cloth was purchased, and garments cut out,
for those of every age, from the infant, to the
hoary-headed. The little girls from the schools,
forgot to play on their holidays, and sat down to
work for the children of Greece.

Ladies of the greatest Wealth, plied their nee-
dles industriously, that the unfortunate Greeks
might be clothed. Their servants also came,
offering a part of their wages. They sat down
by their side, Working for the same charity.

It was like one great sisterhood, in which nar-
row distinctions were forgotten. Such was the
spirit of harmony breathed into every heart, it
would seem that we were debtors to the Greeks,
and not they to us. It was the happiness of
benevolence. There is no other like it.

The little ones partook of it, and their smile
was brighter, while they learned the luxury of
doing good. Their voices were tender and
sweet, as they said to each other, “ Greece

THE G-mL’s READING-BOOK. 103

hungered, and we gave her food ; she was naked,
and we clothed her.”

In one of the cities of New England, when the
boxes of apparel, and the barrels of provisions,
were ready to be sent, it was suggested that a
letter should accompany them. One was accord-
ingly written, and translated into modern Greek.

It was received and read by those desolate
women, with the weeping of joy. And it affords
a lesson to those who have nothing else to give,
that the kind words of affectionate sympathy are
balm to the afllicted heart. Here is a copy of
the letter to the females of Greece.

“ Hartford, Conn., ]VIa9*ch 12th, 1828.

SISTERS AND FRIENDS,

From our years of childhood, the land
of your birth has been the theme of our admira-
tion. With our brothers and husbands, we early
learned to love the country of Homer and of
Solon, of Aristides and Herodotus, of Socrates
and of Plato.

That enthusiasm which the glory of ancient
Greece enkindled in our bosoms, has kept alive
a fervent friendship for her children. We have
seen with deep sympathy the horrors of Turkish
domination, and the struggle so long and nobly
sustained, for existence and for liberty.

The communications of Dr. Howe, since his
return from your afflicted clime, have made us

104 THE e1aL’s READING-BOOK.’

more intimately acquainted with your personal
sufferings. His vivid descriptions have present-
ed you to us, seeking refuge in caves, and dens
of the earth, listening in terror for the footsteps
of the destroyer, or mourning over your dearest
ones slain in battle.

Sisters and friends, our hearts bleed for you.
Deprived of parents and protectors by the for-
tune of war, and continually in fear of evils worse
than death, our prayers are with you, in all your
wanderings, your wants, and your woes.

In this vessel, (which may God send in safety
to your shores,) you will receive a portion of that
bounty with which he hath blessed us. The poor
among us have contributed, according to their
abilities. Our children have added their gifts
and their industry, that your children might have
bread to eat, and raiment to put on.

Could you but have seen the faces of our little
ones brighten, and their eyes sparkle with joy,
as they gave up their holiday sports, that they
might work with their needles for Greece,--could
you have beheld those females who earn a sub-
sistence by labour, gladly casting a mite into
your treasury, or taking hours from their repose,
that you might have an additional garment,-—
could you have witnessed the active benevolence
inspiring every class of our community,—-it would
cheer for a moment the darkness and misery of
your lot.

THE Gnuﬁs READING-BOOK. 105

Inhabitants, as we are, of a part of one of the
smallest of the United States, our donations must
of necessity be more limited, than those from the
larger and more wealthy cities. But such as we
have, we give in the name of the dear Saviour,
with our blessings and our prayers.

We know the value of sympathy, how it girds
the heart to hear, how it plucks the sting from
sorrow. Therefore we have written these few
lines to assure you, that in the remote parts of
our country, as well as in her high places, you
are remembered with pity and with love. ‘

Sisters and friends,-—we extend across the
ocean, our hands to you, in the fellowship of
Christ. We pray that His cross, and the banner
of your land, may together rise above the cres~=
cent and the minaret,———that your sons may hail
the freedom of ancient Greece restored, and
build again the waste places, which the oppressor
hath trodden down,——and that you, admitted once
more to the felicities of home, may gather from
past perils and adversities, a brighter wreath for
the kingdom of heaven.”

HOPE AND MEMORY.

A BABE lay in its cradle. A being with bright
hair, and a clear eye, came and kissed it. Her
name was Hope. Its nurse denied it a cake, for
which it cried ; but Hope told it of one in store
for it to-morrow‘. Its little sister gave it a ﬂower,
at which it clapped its hands joyfully, and Hope
promised it fairer ones, which it should gather
for itself.

The babe grew to a boy. He was musing at
the summer twilight. Another being, with a
sweet, serious face, came and sat by him. Her
name was Memory. And she said, “Look he-
hind thee, and tell me what thou seest.”

The boy answered, “I see a short path, bor-
dered with ﬂowers. Butterﬂies ‘spread out gay
wings there, and birds sing among the shrubs.
It seems to be the path where my feet have
walked, for at the beginning of it is my own
cradle.”

,“ What art thou holding in thy hand?” asked
Memory. And he answered, “ a book which my
mother gave me.” “ Come hither,” said Memo-

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. I07

ry, with a gentle voice, “and I will teach thee
how to get honey out of it, that shall be sweet,
when thy hair is gray.”

The boy became a youth. Once, as he lay in
his bed, Hope and Memory came to the pillow.
Hope sang a merry song, like the lark when she
rises from the nest to the skies. Afterwards, she
said, “ Follow me, and thou shalt have music in
thy heart, as sweet as the lay I sung thee.”

But Memory said, “He shall be mine also.
Hope, why need we contend? For as long as
he keepeth Virtue in his heart, We will be to him
as sisters, all his life long.” So, he embraced
Hope and Memory, and was beloved of them
both. d

When he awoke, they blessed him, and he
gave a hand to each. He became a man, and
Hope girded him every morning for his labour,
and every night he supped at the table of Memo-
ry, with Knowledge for their guest.

At length, age found the man, and turned his
temples white. To his dim eye, it seemed that
the world was an altered place. But it was he
himself who had changed, and the warm blood
hadgrown cold in his veins.

Memory looked on him with grave and tender
eyes, like a loving and long-tried friend. She
sat down by hiselbow-chair, and he said to her,
“ Thou hast not kept faithfully some jewels that
I entrusted to thee. I fear that’ they are lost.”

108 THE G1nL’s READING-BOOK.

She answered mournfully and meekly, “It
may be so. The lock of my casket is worn.
Sometimes I am weary, and fall asleep. Then
Time purloins my key. But the gems that thou
gavest me when life was new, see! I have lost
none of them. They are as brilliant as when
they first came into my hands.”

“emery looked pitifully on him, as she ceased
to speak, wishing to be forgiven. But Hope
began to unfold a radiant wing which she had
long worn concealed beneath her robe, and daily
tried its strength in a heavenward ﬂight.

The old man lay down to die. And as the soul
went forth from the body, the angels took it.

Memory ascended by its side, and went through _

the open gate of heaven. But Hope paused at
the threshold. There she expired, like a rose
faintly giving forth‘ its last odours.

A glorious form bent over her. Her name
was Immortal Happiness. Hope commended to
her the soul, which she had followed through the
world. “Religion,” she said, “planted in it
such seeds as bear the fruit of ‘heaven. It is
thine forever.”

Her dying words were like the music of some
breaking harp, mournful but sweet. And I heard
the voices of angels saying, “Hope that is born
of the earth must die, but Memory is eternal,
as the books from which men are judged.”

‘THE SLEEPLESS LABOURERS.

THOSE who conduct important trades, or
laborious manufactories, prefer such assistants
as possess bodily vigour, and can endure fatigue.
Some occupations, it is necessary to continue
during  part of the night. Yet even the strong-
est labourers cannot long bear this system, unless
they take additional sleep during the day. Did
you ever hear of labourers who never slept?
And yet there are two such. They labour for
you.

Say you, that you have never seen such labour-
ers? Yet they propel the most curious machinery
for your benefit. Listen! can you not hear them
at their work? Their Workshop is within you.
Look, and see what there is about you, that does
not need repose. The hands are obliged to rest
from their toil. The limbs stretch themselves
out, and relax their wearied muscles. The
strained eye closes upon its tasks. The ear
shuts up its labyrinth.

The thinking brain retires within its curtained
cells. The tongue ceases to do the bidding of
the soul. The head seeks its pillow, and the

Fire, air, earth, and water, have no power over
it. It can rule them as servants. It fears
neither rust nor robber. It walks with us into
the vale of years, and does not leave us till We
die.

VVhat a great evil is ignorance! We can see
this by the state of those countries where it pre-
vails. The history of past times will show us
how miserable were their inhabitants,-—-how un-
ﬁt to judge for themselVes,———how stubborn in
wickedness,--how low in their pleasures,-—how
ready to be the prey of the designing.

Look at the man who can neither read nor
write. How confused are his ideas! How nar-
row his conceptions! How ﬁxed his prejudices !
How dependent is he on others to convey his
sentiments, and to interpret their own! How
liable to mistakes ! How incapable of forming
just and liberal opinions I

Ignorance has been truly called the mother
of error. _When Galileo ﬁrst taught the true
motion of the earth round the sun, he was treated
as a criminal, and thrown into a dungeon.
VVhen Columbus revealed his plan of searching
for another continent, he was threatened with
imprisonment.

American Indians, and sent a letter to his distant

strong man lies as powerless as the nursing-babe.
But these two sleepless labourers remit not their
toil. They complain of no weariness. They
accept of no relaxation. They stand upon the
wall of life, sentinels who never put off their
armour, watchmen who are never relieved.

Other labourers require supervision. The
merchant holds his clerk accountable, and the
master his servant. The head manufacturer
has an eye to his machinery, the farmer goes to
the ﬁeld with his men, the teacher is watchful
that his rules may be brought to bear upon his
scholars. The hand depends for its dictates
upon the ruling mind; the foot, like an errand-
boy, waits its orders where to go; the eye and
the ear gather into its garners.

These sleepless labourers trouble the mind for
no directions. They require not to be told what
their work is, or to be questioned whether they
have done it. It is the custom to reward with
increased. wages, those servants who perform
severe labour, and to give high salaries to such
agents as ﬁll diﬂicult and responsible stations.
What payment is accorded to these labourers,
who wake and work while we sleep, without
whose aid we are not able to draw a single
breath ?

I grieve to say, that the fashion of our sex has
dealt hardly by them. She seems not to have
appreciated their services. She impedes them

THE GmL’s READING-BOOK. 111

in their mysterious toil. She binds them with
tight ligatures, so that they do their work in
pain. Sometimes they even faint and sicken at
hercruelty. You will, ere this, have discovered
that the indefatigable servants of whom we have
spoken, are the Heart and Lungs.

I think I hear you say, with an honest warmth,
that these sleepless labourers shall be better
treated; that the lungs, which blow the bellows
of life, and the heart, which feeds it with fuel, till
the ice of death comes, shall not be painfully com-‘
pressed by the busk, or fettered by the corset.
It is undoubtedly possible to hold yourselves
erect, without bringing hurtful engines to bear
upon the seat of vitality. Would it not be a
noble resolution to undertake to do so?

We shudder, when we think how frequently
the slightest injury to the lungs proves fatal;
how soon death enters, when their most delicate
air-valves are broken. We think with wonder
of the force with which the heart operates, send-
ing continually the whole mass of blood to the
smallest veins, and the most remote arteries,
working at the rate of one hundred thousand
strokes every twenty-four hours, and continuing
this sleepless labour, sometimes for eighty or
ninety years, without wearing out. Shall we
dare to embarrass these agents of Almighty
power?

112 THE e1RL’s READING‘-BOOK.

  The slightest ligatures are capable of troubling
these faithful labourers. How dangerous then

must be the tight-lacing which is sometimes so

rashly hazarded. ‘ Not the lungs and heart alone

are thus injured. The stomach is oppressed in

its important task of digestion, the brain clouded
by obstructed circulation, and irregular trans-
missionof blood, and the spine perverted from
its great purpose of giving stability to the frame.
We counted the Turks as barbarians, when
they broke down the sculptured columns of the‘
Greeks,and destroyed those works of art, which
for ages had been admired. What shall they
be called, who deface the architecture of their

We will not do this, though it be the fashion.
These sleepless labourers shall not be incomme-

by our rashness, to burst its ﬂood-gates, or to be
imprisoned in its citadel, or to stir up the brain
to mutiny and madness.

We will not, though others do it, obstruct the
free action of the lungs, or press upon the heart,
in its mysterious laboratory. We dare not in-
terrupt the intricate and exquisite machinery of
God. We are afraid to do so, lest He who is the
former of our bodies, the father of our spirits,
should make his abused goodness the instrument
of our punishment, and bid the ill-treated organs
take vengeance on us, and the Sleepless Labour-
ers become our foes, and shorten the life they
were at ﬁrst appointed to guard.

SUNDAY-SALT.

THE uses of salt are various. You all know
that itimproves the taste of food, that it helps to
preserve meat from putref-action, and is favoura-
ble to health. It is also used in the fusion of

‘metals, in the manufacture of glass, and some-

times to quicken the fertility of cold and barren
soils.

It is agreeable to domestic animals. It is
especially salutary to those that feed on grass.
The careful farmer gives it statedly to his ﬂocks
and herds. It is pleasing to see the sheep and
the cows, the oxen and horses, pach eagerly
receiving their portion of what seems the dessert
to their simple meal.

Wild animals discover where the earth is
impregnated with salt. There they gather in

throngs, to taste the luxury. In our Western-

States, there are multitudes of suhh spots, which
are called licks. Thither also the hunters repair,
and lie in Wait for their prey.

In eastern countries, lions imitate this cunning
of the hunters. Fountains are there scarce, and
they make their dens in marshy places, to seize

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 115

the animals who resort thither to drink. This
was so often the case in Palestine, that some of
the Hebrew poets called the lion, the “ wild beast
of the reeds.” There, like the hunter at the
salt—licks, he lay crouched in his lair, and when
the “ hart came panting for the water-brooks,”
or other feeble animals hasted to quench their
thirst, he was ready to devour them.

Salt, which is so necessary to man, the Crea-
tor has distributed with a liberal hand. It min-
gles with seas and oceans——it rises in the form
of rock.s—-it is found in mines—it covers, for
miles, the surface of some regions—-it breaks
forthin briny fountains from the bosom of the
earth.

Rock salt is sometimes of a pure white, and
sometimes variously coloured. In Africa, are
many mountains of entire salt. In the kingdom
of Tunis, is one composed of red and violet
colour. Great masses of solid salt, cover the
summit of mountains which bound the desert on
the west of Cairo.  

There is a village in Spain, situated at the
base of a rock of salt, ﬁve hundred feet in
heighth,’and a league in circumference. Most
of this is white, though some is of a ﬁne blue.
At Halle, in the Tyrol, are ranges of salt-rocks,
worked by means of galleries cut into them.

.Historians have said that dwellings were an-
ciently built of rock-salt, in Lybia. They are

116 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

still found in Arabia, and other parts of the
globe. In the vast salt-mines of Poland, houses
and chapels exist, and when illuminated by
torches have a magniﬁcent appearance. You
remember the palace of ice built by an Empress
of Russia, which was so brilliant when the lamps
were lighted in the evening.

The salt-mines, near Cracow in Poland, have
been wrought for six hundred years, and still
produce six thousand tons annually. The exca-
vations extend for miles, and near two thousand
labourers are employed there. Different parts
of the Carpathian mountains, and of Siberia, are
also rich in veins of salt.

The mines of Salzburg, in Austria, are more
than a thousand feet in depth. Their subterra-
nean expanse is dazzling with crystals of the
most brilliant hues, and, now and then, the waters
of a lake, where boats conveying visitants glide,
sparkle in the torch-light, as if overhung by a
fret-work of diamonds.

Salt is scattered in masses, over America and
Asia,. as well as over Africa and Europe. In-
numerable fountains of brine spring up through-
out the globe, whence salt is manufactured
for the inhabitants, and for commerce. Many
parts of the United States are rich in these.
You have doubtless heard of the very pro-
ductive ones at Salina, in the State of New-

York.

THE e.IRL’s READING-BOOK. 117

Salt is a source of revenue in various regions.
The Emperor of Austria is said to derive
£100,000 annually, from his mines of salt.
There are various ways of preparing it, from
sea-water, from salt-lakes, and springs. It is
sometimes boiled, and sometimes made in the
open air, by solar evaporation.

Bay-salt is what is made by the heat of the
sun. It is of two kinds; the first drawn from
sea-water, the second from springs or lakes.
Marine-salt is extracted from the water of the
sea by boiling. Fishery—sa1t is made by slow
evaporation, and is known by its large and
coarse crystals.

The white salt of Normandy, has been quite
a source of gain to France. It is prepared by
suffering the rising tide to ﬂow into reservoirs,
where, after partial evaporation, it ﬁlters through
straw into vessels placed for it. It is then boiled,
with continual stirring, and puriﬁed by draining
through large osier baskets.

But, my dear young friends, I think I hear
you say, “ Was not the title of this essay Sunday-
salt? We have been told of rock-salt, and bay-
salt, and marine-salt, and ﬁshery-salt, and the
white-salt of Normandy, but not a word about
what we expected to hear described. Now what
can Sunday-salt mean ?” I am just going to
tell you.

I was once attending the lectures of a pro-
fessor, who, among other means of acquiring
information, had travelled in Europe. He said,
that when he was in Scotland, he observed what
might often be seen in his own country, that the
salt obtained by the action of ﬁre, ‘instead of the
heat of the sun, was sometimes injured by haste
in the process.

By a too rapid evaporation, many foreign and
earthy substances are apt “to be left behind. In
Scotland, the manufacturers of salt continue
their labours until twelve on Saturday night.
They then kindle a large ﬁre under it, and
retire to their homes.

* The crystallization going on more slowly than
usual, during the Sabbath, those impurities which
cause bitterness, are separated and exhaled.
The material thus elaborated, is of superior ex-
cellence. It commands a higher price in the
market, and is sold by the name of Sunday-salt.

After I had heard the learned prof'essor’s
description of Sunday-salt, it occurred to me
that We might make it ourselves, though in a
different way. The cares and pursuits of the
week, sometimes, like ﬁerce ﬁres, overheat the
soul, and render it turbid. Might wenot so
avoid them, one day in seven, and so cultivate
different trains of thought, as‘ to have Sunday-
salt of our own ?

THE GIRL’s READING-BOOK. [119

If we take the time which God reserves to
himself for our own employments—-if, like the
unbelieving Israelites, we go forth to gather our
daily food on the Sabbath,——what we consider
gain will prove a mixture of trouble. It will be
like what our blessed Saviour calls, “salt that
hath lost its savour. Wherewith shall it be
salted?”

The Almighty hath said, “remember the
Sabbath-day to keep it holy.” We cannot dis-
obey him, and be happy. We cannot sweep
manna from the earth on this consecrated sea-
son, and prosper. But we may make Sunday-
salt, in the laboratory of a meek and prayerful
spirit.

May we not carry with us throughout the
week, this Sunday-salt, to purify our lives and
conversation ? It may sometimes be in danger
of dissolving in the humid atmosphere of the
planet that we inhabit. But may we not pre-
serve it in the casket of a watchful soul? Let
us try.

Can we sell our Sunday-salt? Yes; at the
gate of heaven. The saints who have entered
there, “ through much tribulation,” will tell you
that it was the purifying principle in the rough
sea of life. Angels know its value. It will
bring the gold of eternity.

the man who wrote it was a magician, and must
be punished:

If defects in intellectual education lead to such
evils,-——-defects in the education of the heart are
still more deplorable. Look at the child whose
moral principles have been neglected. Has he a
regard for truth E’ Does he shrink at dishonesty P
Is his conscience quick to warn him of a wrong
motive? Does he obey his parents? Does he
love his teachers? Is he anxious to understand
andskeep the law of God?

A good education is another name for happi—
ness. We all desire to be happy, and should be
willing to take pains to learn how. He who
wishes to acquire a trade or a profession,--to
build a house, or to cultivate a farm, or to guide
a vessel over the sea, must expect to work as an
apprentice, or to study as a scholar.

Shall we not devote time and toil to learn how
to be happy? It is a science which the youngest
child may begin, and the wisest man is never
weary of. If we attain the knowledge of many
languages, and the fame of great learning, yet
fail in that which makes the heart happy and the
life good,-—-our knowledge is but “ sounding
brass, and a tinkling cymbal.”

The objects to be kept in view by all who seek
a good education, are to discharge every duty,-——
to make others happy, and to love good things.
May they not be compared to three steps leading

PERSEVERANCE.

Two little girls, whose names were Emma
and Ann, lived near each other, and attended the
same school. They were frequently together,
and their parents encouraged the intimacy- In
winter, they might often be seen leading each
other through the snow, and in summer cultiva-
ting the little spot of ground that was allowed
them. As the gardens of their fathers were
divided only by a slight fence, they could easily
converse, or exchange the flowers that they
reared.

Their parents wished to give them a good
education, and sent them to the best schools that
the place afforded. Both were anxious to excel
in their studies, but Emma acquired knowledge
with far greater ease than her companion. She
quickly comprehended a new subject, and readily
committed long lessons to memory. Conﬁdence
in her own powers, gave her promptness of man-
ner, and she was invariably distinguished at all
public examinations.

Ann learned slowly, and was difﬁdent. She
was sometimes silent, through fear of being

wrong, and made her friends ashamed of her
appearance of ignorance. She would plod for
hours over her appointed tasks, and often return
home, her eyes swollen with weeping, at having
missed in the recitations. Her mother once said
to her, “I am distressed at seeing you so un-
happy. You have not the capacity of Emma,
and must be willing to see her take a higher rank
than yourself.

“But I will give you a recipe, which, if it can-
not procure for you brilliant talents, will aid you
to make the best use of such as are entrusted to
you. When you attempt any thing difficult, say,
‘ I will persevere,’ and ask assistance of your
Father in heaven. Thank him for the gifts of
reason and understanding, and entreat him for a
heart to love your friend as sincerely when she
excels you, as at any other time : for you cannot
expect to make progress in a good cause, if
your spirits are agitated, or envious at another’s
success.”  

The little girl kissed her mother, and promised
to obey her directions. That night, after she
was in bed, she reﬂected so much upon them,
that although she had as usual said her prayers,
she arose, and again kneeling, implored strength
to persevere. Now, when her tasks were difficult,
she no longer wept, but by patient study and
laborious repetition, endeavoured to conquer

them. It was not long, before her improvement

122 THE e1nL‘s READING-BOOK.

was obvious, both to her instructor and asso-
ciates.

Strict mental discipline gave her an interesting
deportment, while the consciousness that she
possessed no genius of which to boast, guarded
her humility. At length, a difficult Latin lesson
was assigned to her class. It contained many
words to be sought out in the dictionary, and
much idiom and transposition. The recitation
was to be immediately on entering the school in
the morning, and those who sustained it without
mistake, were to be rewarded by commencing
the study of Virgil. The others were to review
an elementary book.

Ann’s heart died within her, as she heard
Emma exelaim, “Pray, appoint us a longer
lesson. This will be no trial at all. It will not

occupy me half an hour.” But Emma had begun S

to feel the pride of talents. She had been prais-
ed by her friends, more than was prudent. She
had begun to remit her efforts, and to fancy that
her reputation as a scholar was established.
The evening in which the lesson was to be
learned, her mother had company. She found
it pleasant to sit with them, as they applauded
her remarks, and said she had a great deal of
wit. Her mother thought she detected some
pertness in her conversation, and advised her to
go to her book. But she excused herselftill the
morning. When morning came, having retired

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 123

later than usual, she did not feel like rising early,
and then in a great hurry, and half dressed,
hastened to her lesson.

Now, though Emma was blessed with a very
quick perception, she had but little patience.
When any thing really difficult occurred in her
lessons, she was very'apt to throw them by, or
to prevail on her father to assist her. But he
was now absent. With dismay, she now heard
the clock strike for school, while she was yet
unprepared. Hasting along, with her hat and
shawl halfon, dropping ﬁrst one glove, then the
other, and studying all the way down the street,
she frequently stumbled, and once fell entirely
down.

She took her seat in the class, with a beating
heart, but determined to put the best face on the
matter. One or two hesitations, she managed
to pass off’ with her usual address, but just as her
spirits were beginning to rise with the hope of
victory, she made several absolute and prominent
mistakes. The truth was, that notwithstanding
her ﬁne talents, she was not a thorough scholar.
She valued herself upon her rapid translations,
but in grammatical accuracy, was inferior to
many whose want of genius she ridiculed.

Covering her face with her hands, she burst
into tears. All hope of being raised to a higher
class, was for that time swept away. But what
irritated her feelings, even more than her own

124 THE e1ru.’s READING-BOOK.

defeat, was to hear Ann giving her answers with
entire correctness and precision, and ﬁnally to
see her included in the honorary band. Com-
plaining ofa headache, she hastened home, and
when Ann, in her kindness and simplicity of
heart, called to ask after her health, she could
scarcely bring her mind to speak to her, so bitter
was her disappointment.

Now, when Ann, the preceding evening, had
gone from school with her dreaded lesson, she at
first felt disposed to Weep. But recollecting her
promise to her mother, she said, “ 1 will perse-
vere.” She scarcely staid for supper, so much
did she fear that the allotted time would be
insuﬂicient for her slow mind. Her mother,
perceiving how intensely she laboured, said, “ I
should wish to assist you, dear Ann, were I ac-
quainted with the language in which you study.
Yet this would only be doing you an injury.
Strength of mind comes from vanquishing ob-
stacles, and knowledge painfully gained, is not
easily lost.”  

The little girl, looking meekly up, answered,
“I think God will help me to persevere.” She
wished to sit up Very late, but her mother for-
bade it, on account of her eyes. So, she laid her
books under her pillow, and with the day-light
resumed her studies. Many difﬁculties occurred
in the lesson, but she reﬂected as she went to
school, that she had done all in her power to

THE GIRL’s READING-BOOK. 125

overcome them,and that this would comfort her,
if she lost the desired honour.

When she found herself among the fortunate
hand, she felt surprised, as well as delighted, and
thanked in her heart Him who had helped her
to persevere. But Emma’s pride was so much
hurt, that it affected her friendship, and some-
times when she saw Ann coming to meet her,
would turn away, and whisper to some of her
companions, that “the dull expression of that
girl’s face, made her shockingly nervous.”

The appointed time now approached for a
recitation of poetry and dialogue, to which their
teacher had given them permission to invite their
parents and a few friends. Here Emma con-
soled herself with the hope ofa complete triumph
over Ann. Pursuits that required little labour,
she was very willing to undertake. For this
exhibition, she anxiously prepared, and her ﬁne
elocution, and conﬁdent manners attracted ad-
miring attention, while her difﬁdent friend was
wholly undistinguished.

Ann joined with so much good~humour and
sincerity in the praises of her friend, that Emma
forgot her coldness, and harmony was again
restored. During the whole of her continuance
at school, she continued to excel in those accom-
plishments which tend to display, and to avoid
the studies which required application. The
advances which she made, though sometimes

126 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

great, were irregular, and the promise which
she had prematurely given, was but imperfectly
fulﬁlled. i

Ann, who early acquired the name of a dull
scholar, carefully treasured her laborious gains,
and through perseverance, surpassed all expect-
ation. A premium was offered for the greatest
proﬁciency in arithmetic and geometry. “I am
sure of it,” thought Emma, “for I have been so
long in algebra, that such simple studies are but
A B C, to me.” So, by a few occasional efforts,
she would distance all competitors, and then
suffer her mind to be amused with trifles, or to
relapse into indolence.

But the prize was to be obtained by the strictly-
computed improvement of several months, and
not by a few desultory performances. So, she
was appointed to see it won by the indefatigable
Ann, with the high approbation of her instructor.

She consoled herself under the disappointment, ‘

by saying, that “the premium was no criterion
of talent, but merely given to encourage the
plodders of the school, among whom she had not
the least ambition to appear.”

Ann, by following the judicious directions of
her mother, at length attained a highly respect-
able rank.in all her studies.’ When she left
school, she carried with her the same perse-
verancc which had been there so serviceable.
She had been taught that education was valuable,

not merely for the knowledge it imparts, but for
the habits of mind it creates, and the principles
of action it confirms, and she endeavoured to
prove in domestic life, that hers had not been in
vain.

It was her pleasure to sit with her work—basket
or book, by the side of her widowed mother,
cheering her solitary hours. But Emma soon
became so absorbed in gay and fashionable
amusements, that useful employment was irk-l
some. She said, “she thanked her stars, she
was blessed with suﬂicient sense not to be a
mope, while she was younou”

When she married, it was her ambition to
make a showy appearance. Rational economy,
she had neither patience to study, nor self'—control
to practise. It involved such petty details, that
it seemed to her beneath the notice of a liberal
and reﬁned intellect. The regulation of her
children’s temper and character was sadly neg-
lected, from that disposition to avoid trouble
which she had long indulged.

When faults were disclosed that required im-
mediate attention, she was too prone to put them
aside, as she did her difﬁcult lessons at school.
She complained of them as too troublesome for
her to contend with, or comforted herself with
the indolent hope, that “all would come right at
last.” But it was not long ere she was con-
strained to say, that “if she was to bring up

128 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

another family, her first course would be to teach
them that order, industry, and perseverance,
which she had herself never learned.”

In a few years after their marriage, the affairs
of her husband became seriously embarrassed.
Then she was greatly astonished and distressed.
She was too helpless to do any thing for his
relief. \Vith the science that prevents the
wasteful expenditure of servants, provides for
the comfort, but not profusion of a table, or
prolongs the existence of a wardrobe, she was
wholly unacquainted.

Of those habits oflpersevering industry, which
she had ridiculed in her friend Ann, she now felt
the need. How often did she lament her early
neglect of that application and self-control, which
in woman’s sphere of duty, are more valuable
than those talents which dazzle, and demand
admiration as their daily food.

But Ann found the discipline to which she had
been subjected in childhood, an excellent prepar-
ation for domestic duty. When she en.countered
difficulties, she was not dismayed. She knew in
whom she had trusted, and that he would aid her

to persevere. The fortune of her husband was

notlarge. But by a consistent economy, she was
able to secure every comfort, and to remember
the poor.

It was now a matter.of less consequence, than
when at school, which of the two ladies could

boast of the quickest perception, or the most
brilliant intellect. But it was clear to every ob-
server, whose house was the seat of the greatest
order, comfort, and happiness. Ann still felt a
sincere interest in the welfare of her early friend,
Emma, and visited her as often as was in her
power, seeking to extend encouragement, or to
impart sympathy.

Ann’s widowed mother had become inﬁrm,
and given up her own house, to reside with her.
This excellent daughter had no higher pleasure
than to study her wishes, and try to repay a
small part of the debt of gratitude, incurred in
infancy and childhood. Often would she say,
with an aﬁectionate smile, “ ifthere is any good
thing in me, I owe it to your counsel, and to His
grace who enabled me to persevere.”

And when the old lady, with her silver locks
shading her venerable temples, bending from
her easy-chair, would tell her listening grand-
children, by what means their dear mother he-
came all that was excellent, the little creatures,
gathering closer to her side, would say, with
affecting earnestness, “We, too, will learn to
persevere.”

to a beautiful house where you wish to go?
Each one that you ascend, brings you nearer to
the threshold.

The temple of happiness in this world, is the
temple of goodness. And the temple of happi-
ness in the world to come, is heaven. There, all
the good of every nation meet, and dwell togeth-
er forever. These temples communicate with
each other, and a right education is the way of
entrance to both.

The different parts of a good education, may
be called the alphabet of happiness. And from
this alphabet is formed a language for angels.
That is but a lame education, which stops short
of a higher world.

I seem to hear some little voice asking, “ when
will a good education be ﬁnished ?——-Will it be
finished when we have done going to school, or
are grown up women P” I tell you it will never
be ﬁnished, until you die. He alone, who bids
the pulse stop, and the cold heart lie still in the
bosom, is able to say “ it is ﬁnis/zed.”

This whole life is but one great school. From
the cradle to the grave, we are all scholars.
The voices of those we love, and the wisdom of
past ages, and our own experience, are our
teachers. Aﬂlictions give us discipline. The
spirits of departed saints whisper to us,-—“ Come

FEMALE ENERGY.

IT is a pity that females should ever be
brought up in a helpless manner. It is a still
greater pity, when they think it not respectable
to be industrious: for then principles, as well as
habits, have become perverted. They ought to
feel that their endowments qualify them for ac-
tivity, and their duty demands it.

Our sex should begin, while young, to take an
interest in the concerns of the family, and daily
to do something for its comfort. They should
come promptly and cheerfully, to the aid of the
mother in her cares. They should inform them-
selves of the amount of the yearly expenses of
the household, and keep an accurate account of
their Own.

Why should young girls be willing to be
drones in the domestic hive P In several families
of the highest respectability, the daughters supply
by their own industry, the resources of their
charity. This they do, not from necessity, but
because it is pleasant to them, that their gifts to
the poor should be the fruit of their own earnings.

No female should consider herself educated,
until she is mistress of some employment or ac-

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 131

complishment, by which she might gain a liveli-
hood, should she be reduced to the necessity of
supporting herself. The ancient Jews had a
proverb, that whoever brought a child up with
out a trade, bound it apprentice to vice.

Who can tell how soon they may be compelled
to do something for their own maintenance?
How many families, by unexpected reverses,
are reduced from affluence to poverty. How
pitiful and contemptible, on such occasions, to
see females helpless, desponding, and embar-
rassing those whom it is their duty to cheer and
aid.  

“I have lost my whole fortune,” said a mer-
chant, as he returned one evening to his home.
“We can no longer ride in our carriage; we
must leave this large house. The children can
no longer go to expensive schools.’ What we
are to do for a living, I know not. Yesterday, I
was a rich man. To-day, there is nothing left
that 1 can call my own.”

“ Dear husband,” said the wife, “ we are still
rich in each other, and our children. Money
may pass away, but God has given us a better
treasure in these active hands, and loving hearts.”
“ Dear father,” said the little children, “ do not
look so sober. We will help you to get a living.”

“What can you do, poor things?” said he.
“ You shall see, you shall see,” answered several
cheerful voices. “ It is a pity, if we have been

to school for nothing. How can the father of
eight healthy children be poor ? We shall work
and make you rich again.”

“ I shall help,” said the youngest girl, hardly
four years old. “ I will not have any new frock
bought, and I shall sell my great wax doll.”
The heart of the husband and father, which had
sunk in his bosom like a stone, was lifted up.
The sweet enthusiasm of the scene cheered
him, and his nightly prayer was like a song of
praise. ii

He left his stately house. The servants were
dismissed. Pictures, and plate, and rich carpets
and furniture, were sold, and she who had been
so long the mistress of the mansion, shed no
tear. “ Pay every debt,” said she, “ let no one
suffer through us, and we may yet be happy.”

He took a neat cottage, and a small piece of
ground, a few miles from the city. With the
aid of his sons, he cultivated Vegetables for the
market. He viewed with delight and astonish-
ment, the economy of his wife, nurtured as she
had been in Vvealtli, and the efficiency which his
daughters sodn acquired under her training.

The eldest ones assisted her in the work of
the household, and instructed the younger chil-
dren. Besides, they executed various works,
which they had learned as accomplishments, but
which they found could now be disposed of to
advantage. They embroidered with taste, some

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 133

of the ornamental parts of female apparel, which
were readily sold to merchants in the city.

They cultivated ﬂowers, and sent bouquets to
market, in the cart that conveyed their vegeta-
bles. They platted straw, they painted maps,
they executed plain needle-work. Every one
was at their post, busy and cheerful. The cot-
tage was like a bee-hive.

“ I never enjoyed such health before,” said the
father. “And I was never as happy before,”
said the mother. “We never knew how many
things we could do, when we lived in the great
house,” said the children, “and we love each
othera great deal better here.   You call us your
little bees, and say we make such honey as the
heart feeds on.”

Economy, as well as industry, was strictly ob-
served. Nothing was wasted. Nothing unne-'
cessary was purchased. After a while, the eldest
daughter became assistant teacher in a distin-
guished female seminary, and the second took
her place, as instructress to the family.

The little dwelling which had always been
kept neat, they were soon able to beautify. Its
construction was improved, and vines and ﬂower-
ing-trees were planted around it. The merchant
was happier under its Woodbine-covered porch in
a summer’s evening, than he had been in his
showy drawing-room.

“ We are now thriving and prosperous,” said
he, “shall we return to the city P” “Ah! no,
no!” was the unanimous reply. “Let us re-

«main,” said the wife, “Where We have found

health and contentment.” “Father,” said the
youngest, “all we children, hope you are not
going to be rich again.

“ For then,” she added, “ we ‘little ones were
shut up in the nursery, and did not see m_uch of
you, or mother. Now, we all live together; and
sister’, who loves us, teaches us, and we learn to
be industrious and useful. We were none of us
as happy when we were rich, and did not work.
So, father, please not to be a rich man any
more.” .

The females of other countries, sometimes
make far greater exertions than they are accus-
tomed to do in our own. It would seem that
they were more athletic, and able to endure
fatigue. This may probably arise from their
being inured to more severe exercise, especially
those of the poorer classes.

Joanna Martin, the wife of a day-labourer in
England, was left a widow with six small chil-
dren, and not a shilling for their support. The
parish oﬂicers, perceiving it to be a case of great
distress, offered to take charge of them. But
the good mother resolved to depend only upon
the divine blessing, and her own industry.

THE GIRL’s READING-BOOK. 135

The life on which she entered, was one of ex-
treme hardship. She rose at two in the morning,
and after doing what she could to make her little
ones comfortable, walked eight, and sometimes
ten miles, to the market-town, with a basket of
pottery-ware on her head, which she sold, and
returned with the proﬁts before noon.

By this hard labour, and the greatest economy,
she not only gained food and clothing for her
children, but in the course of a year, saved the
sum of about seven dollars. Then, ﬁnding her-
self under the necessity of quitting the cottage
where she had lived, she formed the resolution of
building one for herself.

Every little interval of time, which she could
spare from her stated toils, she devoted to work-
ing upon the tenement which was to shelter her
little ones, and “with the assistance of a good
God,” said she, “I was able at last to ﬁnish my
cottage.” It was small, but comfortable, and
might remind those who saw it, of what Cowper
calls, “ the peasant’s nest.”

After several years, Joanna, by persevering in
her industry and prudence, acquired enough to
purchase a cart, and a small pony.” “Now,”
said she with delight, “ I can carry pottery-Ware
to the different towns round about, and drive a
pretty brisk trade, for I begin to feel that I can-
not walk thirty miles a day, quite so well as when
I was younger.”

136 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

She lived to advanced age, respected for her
honesty, patient diligence, and maternal virtues.
It was pleasant to observe the self-approbation
and simplicity with which she would say, when
quite old, “ to be sure I am not very rich, but
what I have is all of’ my own getting. I never
begged a half-penny of any soul. I brought up
my six children without help from the overseers
of the parish, and can still maintain myself, with-
out troubling them for assistance.”

Many instances of the most laudable efforts to
obtain a support, might be mentioned among the
females of our own country. The disposition to
be active in various departments of usefulness,
ought to be encouraged in the young, by those

who have charge of their education. The office

ofa teacher, is one of the most respectable and
delightful to which they can aspire.

To instruct others is beneﬁcial to the mind.
It deepens the knowledge which it already pos-
sesses, and quickens it to acquire more. It is
beneﬁcial to the moral habits. It teaches self-
control. It moves to set a good example. It
improves the affections. For we love those,
whom we make wiser and better, and their
gratitude is a sweet reward.

The work of education, opens a broad ﬁeld for

female labourers. There they may both reap
and confer beneﬁts. If they do not wish to enter
upon it as the business of life, it will be found a

good preparation for the duties of any sphere to
which they may in future be called.

Let the young females of the present genera-
tion, distinguish themselves by energy in some
useful employment. Indolence and effeminacy
are peculiarly unfit for the daughters of arepub-
lic. Let them not shrink at reverses of fortune,
but View them as inciternents to greater activity,
and higher virtue. M

It was a wise man who said, “Virtue, like a
precious odour, is most fragrant when crushed:
for prosperity doth best discover vice, but adver-
sity doth best discover virtue.” VVhen those we
love are in trouble, let us feel that we have a
two-fold office, to cheer, and to help them.

When man was first placed upon the earth,
woman was pronounced by the Almighty maker,
a “ help-meet for him.” If at any period of her
life, whether as daughter or sister, as wife or
mother, she draws back from being a helper,
and through indolence becomes a burden,-—she
forgets her duty to him, and violates the com-
mand of her Creator.

THE WIFE OF THE INTEMPERATE.

JANE HARWOOD, with her husband and chil-
dren, made one among the many familicsxwho
remove to the unplanted, western wild. The
change from the manner of life in which she had
been brought up in her native New England, was
great. Butshe never complained, and busied
herself with those duties which beﬁt the wife of
a lowly emigrant.

One of her principal cares was an invalid boy.
The charge of his health, and of his mind, occu-
pied her most anxious thoughts. She supplicated
that the pencil which was to write upon his soul,
and which seemed to be placed in her hand,
might be guided from above. She spoke to him
in the tenderest manner of his Father in heaven,
and of his will respecting little children.

She pointed out Almighty goodness in the daily
gifts that sustain life; in the glorious sun re-
joicing in the east; in the gently-falling rain;
the frail plants‘, and the dews that nourish them.
She reasoned with him of the changes of nature,
till he loved even the storm and the lofty thunder,
because they came from God.

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 139

She repeated to him passages of Scripture,
with which her memory was stored, and sang
hymns, until she perceived that if he was in pain
he complained not, if he might but hear her
voice. She made him acquainted with the life
of the compassionate Redeemer, how he took
young children in his arms, though the disciples
forbade them. And a voice from within, urged
her never to desist from cherishing that tender
and deep—rooted piety, because, like the ﬂower
of grass, he must soon pass away.

Jane Harwood had a different, and a still
deeper trial, in the intemperance of her husband.
In his ﬁts of intoxication, there was no form of
persecution which distressed her so much, as
unkindness to the feeble and suffering boy. On
such occasions, it was in vain that she attempted
to protect him. She might neither shelter him
in her bosom, nor control the frantic violence of
the father.

The timid boy, in terror of his natural protect-
or, withered like a crushed ﬂower. It was of no
avail that neighbours remonstrated with the un-
feeling parent, or that hoary-headed men warned
him solemnly of his sins. Intemperance had de-
stroyed his respect for man, and his fear of God.

The wasted and wild-eyed invalid, shrank
from the glance and footstep of his father, as
from the approach of a foe. Harshness, and the
agitation of fear, deepened a disease that might

else have yielded. Returning Spring, brought no
gladness to the declining child. Consumption
laid its hand upon his Vitals, and his nights were
restless and full of pain.

“Mother, I wish I could once more smell the I

violets that grew upon the green bank, by our old,
dear home.” “It is too early for violets, my
child; but the grass is growing bright and beau-
tiful around us, and the birds sing sweetly, as if
their little hearts were full of praise.” The
mother knew that his hectic fever had been
recently increasing, and saw that there was a
strange brightness in his eye.

Seating herself on his low bed, she bowed her
face to his, to soothe and compose him. “Mother,
do you think my father will come 3” Dreading
the alarm which, in his paroxysms of coughing,
he evinced at his father’s approach, she answer-
ed, “I think not, love; you had better try to
sleep.”

“Mother, I wish he would come. I am not
afraid now. Perhaps he would let me lay my
cheek to his, once more, as he used to do, when
I was a babe in my grandmother’s arms. I
should be glad to say a kind good bye to him,
before I go to my Saviour.”

Gazing earnestly in his face, she saw the work
of the destroyer. “ My son ! my dear son ! say,
Lord Jesus receive my spirit.” “ Mother,” he
replied, with a smile upon his ghastly features,

THE GmL’s READING-BOOK. 141

“ he is ready for me. I am willing to go to him.
Hold the baby to me, that I may kiss her once
more. That is all. Now sing to me; and oh!
wrap me closer in your arms, for I shiver with
cold.”

He clung, with the death-grasp, to that bosom
which had long been his sole earthly refuge.
“ Sing louder, a little louder, dearest mother, I
cannot hear you.” Tremulous tones, like those
ofa broken harp, rose above her grief, to comfort
the dying child. One sigh oficy breath was upon
her check, as she joined it to his, one shudder,
and all was over.

She stretched the body on the bed, and kneel-
ing beside it, hid her face in that grief which
none but mothers feel. It was a deep and sacred
solitude——alone with the dead. Only the soft
breathings of the sleeping babe were heard.
Then the silence was broken by a piercing voice
of supplication for strength to endure. The
petition, which began in weakness, closed in
faith. It became a prayer of thanksgiving to
him who had released the dove-like spirit from
its _prison house of pain, to share the bliss of
angels.

She arose from her knees, and bent calmly
over the dead. The placid features were the
same smile as when he had spoken of Jesus.
She smoothed the shining locks around the pure
forehead, and gazed long on what was to her so

13

beautiful. Amid. her tears was an expression,
chastened and sublime, as of one who gives a
cherub back to God.

The father entered carelessly. She pointed
to the pale, immoveable brow. “See, he no
longer suffers.” He drew near, and looked with
surprise on the dead. A few natural tears forced
their way, and fell upon the face of the ﬁrst-born,
who was once his pride. He even spoke tenderly
to the emaciated mother, and she, who a few
moments before, felt raised above the sway of
grief, wept like an infant, as those few affection-
ate tones touched the sealed fountains of other
years.

James Harwood returned from the funeral
of the child, in much mental distress. His sins
were brought to remembrance, and reflection
was misery. Sleep was disturbed by visions of
his neglected boy. In broken dreams, he fancied
that he heard him coughing from his low bed, as
he was wont to do. VVith a strange disposition
of kindness he felt constrained to go to him, but
his limbs refused their oﬂice. Then a little, thin,
dead, hand, would be thrust from the dark grave,
and beckon him to follow to the unseen world.

While conscience thus haunted him with ter-
rors, many prayers arose from pitying and pious
hearts, that he might now be led to repentance.
There was, indeed, a change in his habits; and
she, who was above all others interested. in his

THE G1RL’s READING-BOOK. 143

reformation, spared no effort to win him back to
the path of virtue, and to sooth his accusing spirit
into peace with itself, and obedience to its God.

Yet was she doomed to witness the full force of
the conflict of grief and remorse against intem-
perance, only to see them suddenly overthrown.
The reviving goodness, with whose promise she
had so solaced herself, as even to give thanks
that her beloved son had not died in vain, was
transient as the morning-dew. Habits of indus-
try, which seemed to have been springing up,
proved themselves to be without root.

The dead, and his cruelty to the dead, were
alike forgotten. Disaffection to that tender and
trusting wife, who “against hope, had believed
in hope,” resumed its habitual sway. The
friends who had alternately reproved and en-
couraged him, felt that their efforts were of no
avail. Intemperance, like the “ strong man
armed,” took ﬁnal possession of a soul, that
lifted no prayer for aid to the Holy Spirit, and
ceased to stir itself up to struggle with the de-
stroyer.

To lay waste the comfort of his wife, seemed
now the principal object of this miserable man.
Day after day, did she witness for herself and for
her household, the fearful changes of his cause-
less anger and brutal tyranny. She felt the utter

necessity of deriving consolation, and the power

of endurance, wholly fromabove.

I44 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

She was faithful in the discharge ofthe diﬂicult
duties that devolved upon her, and especially
careful not to irritate him by reproaches or a
gloomy countenance. Yet she could not some-
times prevent from rising mournfully to her view,
her sweet native village,—-—the peaceful home
and fond friends of her childhood so far away,--—
and the constant, endearing attentions, which
won her early love, for one whose ill-treatment
now strewed her path with thorns.

In this new and solitary settlement, she had no
relative to protect her from his insolence; she
felt that she was entirely in his power,——that it
was a power without generosity,-——and that there
is no tyranny so entire and terrible, as that of an
alienated and intemperate husband.

Still, looking to her Father in Heaven, she
found her courage revive, and deepen into a
childlike conﬁdence. After putting her children
to bed, as she sat alone, evening after evening,—-
while the joys of early days, and the sorrows of
maturity, passed in review before her, she ques-
tioned her heart what had been its gain from
Heaven’s discipline, and whether she was to
sustain that greatest of all losses, the loss of the
spiritual beneﬁt intended by aﬂliction. i

The absences of her husband grew more fre-
quent and protracted. Once, during the third
night of his departure, she knew not where, she
lay sleepless, listening for his footsteps. Some-

times she fancied sheheard his shouts of wild
laughter, but it was only the shriek of the tem-
pest. Then, she thought the sounds of his
frenzied anger rang in her cars. It was the
roar of the hoarse wind through the forest.

All night long, she listened to these tumults,
and hushed and sang to her aﬂirighted babe.
Early in the morning, her eye was attracted by a
group coming up slowly from the river which ran
near her dwelling. A terrible foreboding came
upon her. She thought they bore a corpse. It
was, indeed, the corpse of her husband. He had
been drowned, as it was supposed, during the
darkness of the preceding night, while attempt-
ing to cross a bridge of logs, which had been
broken by the swollen Waters.

Utter prostration of spirit came over the deso-
late mourner. Her energies were broken, and
her heart withered. V She had sustained the hard-
ships of emigration and the privations of poverty,
the burdens of unceasing toil and unrequited
care, without murmuring. She had laid her
ﬁrst~born in the grave, with resignation, for faith
had heard her Redeemer saying, “Suffer the
little one to come unto me.”

She had seen him, in whom her heart’s young
affections were garnered up, become a prey to
vice the most disgusting and destructive. Yet
she had borne up under all. One hope had

lingered with her, as an “anchor of the soul,”
13*

146 THE GIRL ’s READING-BOOK.

the hope thatihe might yet repent and be re-
claimed. But now he had died in his sin. The
deadly leprosy which had stolen over his heart,
could no more be “purged with sacriﬁce,or
offering, forever.”

She knew not that a single prayer for mercy
had preceded the soul on its passage to the
judge’s bar. There were bitter dregs in this
cup of wo, which she had never before tasted.
With heaviness of an unspoken and peculiar
nature, was the victim of intemperance borne
from the house that he had troubled,and buried

by the side of his son, to whose tendertyears he

had ‘been an unnatural enemy. And among
those who surrounded his open grave, there was
sorrow, bearing the features of that fearful “ sor-
row which is without hope.”

“I HAVE SEEN AN END OF ALL PER-
FEc'rIoN.”—Psalms.

I HAVE seen a man in the glory of his days,,in

the pride of his strength. He was built like the
strong oak, that strikes its root. deep in the
earth—like the tall cedar, that lifts its head
above the trees of the forest.
7 He feared no danger,—-—he felt no sickness,-vhe
wondered why any should groan or sigh atpain.
His mind was vigorous like his body. He was
perplexed at no intricacy, he was daunted at no
obstacle. Into hidden things he searched, and
what was crooked he made plain.

He Went forth boldly upon the face of the
mighty deep. He surveyed the nations of the
earth. He measured the distances of the stars,
and called them by their names. He gloried in
the extent of his knowledge, in the vigour of his
understanding, and strove to search even into
what the Almighty had concealed.

And when I looked upon him, I said with the
poet, “ what a piece of work is man! how noble
in reason! how inﬁnite in‘ faculties ! I in form and
moving, how express and admirable! in action,

148 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

how like an angel! in apprehension, how like a
god!”

I returned——but his look was no more lofty, nor
his step proud. His broken frame Was like some
ruined tower. His hairs were white and scatter-
ed, and his eye gazed vacantly upon the passers
by. The vigour of his intellect was wasted, and
of all that he had gained by study, nothing re-
mained.

He feared when there was no danger, and
when there was no sorrow, he wept. His de-
caying memory had become treacherous. It
showed him only broken images of the glory that
was departed.

His house was to him like a strange land, and
his friends were counted as enemies. He thought
himselfstrong and healthful, while his feet totter-
ed on the verge of the grave.

He said of his son, “he is my brother ;” of his
daughter, “ Iknow her not.” He even inquired
what was his own name. And as I gazed mourn-
fully upon him, one who supported his feeble
frame and ministered to his many wants, said to
me, “ Let thine heart receive instruction, for
thou hast seen an end of all perfection.”

I have seen a beautiful female, treading the
first stages of youth, and entering joyfully into
the pleasures of life. The glance of her eye was
variable and sweet, and on her cheek trembled
something like the first blush of morning; her

THE GmL’s READING-BOOK. 149

lips moved, and there was melody; and when

she ﬂoated in the dance, her light form, like the

aspen, seemed to move with every breeze.

I returned———she was not in the dance. I sought
her among her gay companions, but I found her
not. Her eye sparkled not there, the music of
her voice was silent. She rejoiced on earth no
more.

I saw a train, sable, and slow-paced. Sadly
they bore toward an open grave, what once was
animated and beautiful. As they drew near, they
paused, and a voice broke the solemn silence.

“Man, that is born of a woman, is of few
days, and full of trouble. He cometh forth like
a ﬂower, and is cut down; he ﬂeeth also as a
shadow, and never continueth in one stay.”

Then they let down into the deep, dark pit,
that maiden whose lips, but a few days since,
were like the half blown rosebud. I shuddered
at the sound of clods falling upon the hollow
coffin.

Then I heard a voice saying, “ earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.” They covered her
with the damp soil, and the uprooted turf of the
valley, and turned again to their own homes.

But one mourner lingered to cast himself upon
the tomb. And as he wept, he said, “there is
no beauty, nor grace, nor loveliness, but what
vanisheth like the morning dew. I have seen an
end of all perfection.”

MEMORY.

“I FORGOT to get my lesson this morning,”
said a pupil to her teacher. “ Did you forget to
come to breakfast?” “ No, Ma’am, I did not.”
“ Then your body has a better appetite for food,
than your mind for knowledge.

“ If you were sick you would not wish for
breakfast. You would avoid the sight of food.
Perhaps your parents would send for a physician.
He would give you medicine. He would seek to
remove the causes that had destroyed your appe-

tite.  What medicine will you take to restore  

the health of your mind ?

“Did you not take some pains lto:.prepare
yourself for breakfast? .You arose, and washed,
and dressed,and said your prayers, and were
ready to take your seat at the table. Did you
bestow equal care on theglessons of the day?
For it seems you can remember to take pains
when you choose.”

“ I cannot remember the sermon,” said a boy
to his father, “ and my Sunday-school lesson is
toolong.” “ How came you to remember the
story that was told you the other evening, and

150 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

I saw a fair white dwelling, behind shady
trees. Flowers were cultivated around it. The
clustering vine Wreathed above its door, and the
Woodbine looked in at its windows. A mother
was there fondling her young babe. Another,
who had just learned to lisp its ﬁrst wishes, sat
on the father’s knee. He looked on them all,
with a loving smile, and a heart full of happiness.

I returned——the ﬂowers had perished, the vine
was dead at the root. Weeds towered where the
woodbinegblossomed, and tangled grass sprung
up by the threshold where many feet used to
tread. There was no sound of sporting children,
or of the mother singing to her babe.

I turned my steps to the church-yard. Three
new mounds were added there. That mother
slept between her sons. A lonely man was how-
ing down there, whose face I did not see. But
I knew his voice, when he said in his low prayer
of sorrow, “Thou hast made desolate all my com-
pany.” The tall grass rustled and sighed in the
cold east wind. Methought it said, “ See, an
end of all perfection.”

I saw an infant with a ruddy brow, and a form
like polished ivory. Its motions were graceful,
and its merry laughter made other hearts glad.
Sometimes it wept, and again it rejoiced, when
none knew why. But whether its cheek dim pled
with smiles, or its blue eye shone more brilliant
through tears, it was beautiful.

THE GIRL ’s READING-BOOK. 151

It was beautiful, because it was innocent.
And care-worn and sinful men, admired, when
they beheld it. It was like the first blossom
which some cherished plant has put forth, whose
cup sparkles with a dew-drop, and whose head
reclines upon the parent-stem.

Again I looked. It had become a child. The
lamp of reason had beamed into its mind. It
was simple, and single—hearted, and a follower of
the truth. It loved. every little bird that sang in
the trees, and every fresh ‘blossom. Its heart
danced with joy, as it looked around on this good
and pleasant world.

It stood like a lamb before its teachers, it
bowed its ear to instruction, it walked in the way
of knowledge. It was not proud or stubborn or
envious ; and it had never heard of the vices and
vanities of the world. And when I looked upon
it, I remembered our Saviour’s Words, “Except
ye become as little children, ye cannot enter into
the kingdom of heaven.”

I saw a man whom the world calls honourable.
Many waited for his smile. They pointed to the
ﬁelds that were his, and talked of the silver and
gold which he had gathered. They praised the
stateliness of his domes, and extolled the honour
of his family. ‘

But the secret language of his heart was, “by
my wisdom have I gotten all this.” So he re-
turned no thanks to God, neither did he fear or

152 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

serve him. As I passed along, I heard the com-
plaints of the labourers who had reaped his ﬁelds,
and the cries of the poor, whose covering he had
taken away.

The sound of feasting and revelry was in his
mansion, and the unfed beggar came tottering
from his door. But he considered not that the
cries of the oppressed were continually entering
into the ears of the Most High.

And when I knew that this man was the docile
child whom I had loved, the beautiful infant on
whom I had gazed with delight, I said in my
bitterness, “ I have seen an end of all perfection.”
So I laid my mouth in the dust.

MRS. ELIZABETH ROWE.

Mas. ELIZABETH Rowe was born at Ilches-
ter, in England, September 11th, 1674. Her
parents were distinguished for integrity, benevo~
lence, and piety. In early childhood, she dis-
played a desire to proﬁt by their precepts, and
follow their example.

She had an only sister, whom she tenderly
loved. They, always wished to be together.
Side by side, they studied, worked, warbled the
same hymn, and had no idea ofa separate enjoy-

ment. But the eldest, was smitten in her youth

and loveliness, and the lonely survivor walked
on, with the burden ofa deep sorrow.

This affliction seemed to deepen the religious
impressions, which from early life she had cher-
ished. It brought the thoughts of the eternal
world more near, and humbled her in the most
solemn acts of devotion. In the pursuit of know-
ledge, she was also persevering and successful.

With the French and Italian languages, she
became familiar. Painting, music, and poetry
she had practised from a child. Her love of
the latter predominated, and she found it both

14

154 THE G1RL’s READING-BOOK.

a solace in grief, and a heightener of every
pleasure. At the age of twenty-two, a volume
of her poems was published, which attracted
attention and praise.

But her uncommon accomplishments, and the
admiration they received, created no vanity.
She was remarked for her unaffected manners,
sweetness of disposition, and active benevolence.
She even made herself acquainted with the study
of medicine, that she might relieve the indigent
sick, who were unable to pay a physician; and
they viewed her as a guardian angel.

She married Mr. Thomas Rowe, a man of dis»
tinguished talents and attainments, who warmly
reciprocated the attachment of her reﬁned and
affectionate spirit. But only ﬁve years of conju-
gal happiness was allotted them; and after his
lamented death, she retired ‘to a solitary estate
in Frome, where she sought to comfort her
widowhood by intellectual pursuits, and wor,l<s of
charuy.

She meditated so much on the happiness of
departed friends, and made herself so familiar in
thought with the world of spirits, that she was
induced to compose a volume of “ Letters from
the Dead to the Living.” These were followed
by “Letters, Moral and Entertaining,” where
she endeavours by ﬁctitious examples, to expose
the deformity of vice, and allure to the practice

of virtue.

THE e1nL’s READING-BOOKS‘. 155

She wrote other books, among which were the
“ History of Joseph,” and “ Devout Exercises of
the Heart.” So great was her fondness for study’
and writing, that though her society was courted
by families of rank and opulence, she quitted her
beloved retirement with reluctance, and returned
to it with increased delight.

Still, she had the kindest social feelings, and
her manners were a model of unaffected polite-
ness. She excelled in conversation, as well as
with her pen. The most elegant language
flowed from her lips, she spoke gracefully, and
her tone of voice was singularly sweet and har-
monious. r

Though she was agreeable, and even beautiful
in her person, she did not sacriﬁce her time to
the decorations of dress. She was always neat
in her apparel, but did not allow the toilet to in-
terfere with nobler pursuits. For empty cere-
mony and ostentatious fashion, she had neither
time nor taste.

She discountenanced every kind of luxury.
She preferred to have her table simply spread,
and devote to the poor the money which would
have loaded it with dainties. S She felt that the
pampering of the appetite, was unworthy of
beings ﬁtted for higher pleasures, and formed
for immortality.

She was affable and courteous to persons in
humble stations. Her domestics she treated

156 THE G1RL’s READING-BOOK.

with the utmost kindness. She saw that they
had every needful attention in sickness, and often
sat by their bedside, reading them books of use-
ful instruction and pious counsel.

Her heart was eminently formed for frien-d-
ship. She rendered every service in her power
to those whom she loved. By a warm and
generous sympathy, she made their sorrows her
own. She was candid and tender, in pointing
out their faults, and above all, strove to win their
hearts to the love of that true piety, which had
rendered her life so happy.

Her charities were extensive. The greatest
part of her income was devoted to them. She
took pleasure in denying herself superﬂuities,
that she might have more to bestow on those
who were destitute of comforts. She Worked
with her own hands to relieve their necessities.
Tears ﬂowed down her checks at a tale of dis-
tress, and not content with sending bounty, she
visited in person, the hovels of poverty and
contagion.

She gave books to the ignorant. She educa-
ted poor children, supplied them with clothing,
and instructed them herself, in the principles of
the Christian religion. Such was her reputation
for benevolence, that the indigent from neigh-
bouring villages resorted to her, and shared in
her alms and her sympathies.

THE e1RL’s READING-BOOK. I57

One of her great excellencies, was a most
sweetvand amiable disposition. She was un-
ruﬂled by the common crossing incidents oflife,
those petty obstructions, which throw the temper
off its guard, more than real afflictions. Neither
inﬁrmities, or advancing age, disturbed this se-
renity.

Servants, who had lived with her for nearly
twenty years, never saw her out of temper. In-
deed, it has been said, that she was not known
throughout her whole life, to utter an unkind
or an ill-natured expression. To scandal and
calumny she had a most rooted aversion, and de-
fended the reputation of others, as far as was in
her power.

Her talent for conversation, she made use of
as a means, not merely of imparting pleasure,
but of doing good. When she wished to excite
a person to the practice of any particular virtue,
she sometimes delicately praised those who had
been eminent for it, hoping they might thus,
by the beauty of example, be quickened to im-
itation.

All her deportmcnt was marked by true hu-
mility. And though her excellence could not
shield her from enmity, and from the slanders of
that envy which follows eminent goodness, and
“ like the shadow proves the substance true,” she
avoided resentment, and considered herself thus

called upon to exercise the christian virtue of
forgiveness. '

She was strict in the observances of religion.
She adopted the rule of the I’salmist, “ evening
and morning and noon, will I pray ;” and retired
three times a day for stated private devotion.
In the duties of the Sabbath she was exemplary,
caused the Scriptures to be daily read in her
family, and attended the sacrament of the Lord’s
supper, with great vencration and love.

A life so blameless, a trust so ﬁrm in God, a
mind so conversant with a future and better
world, seemed to have divested death of terror.
He came as a messenger to conduct her ito that
state of purity and bliss, for which she had been
so long preparing.

A short time before the event, though in per-
fect health, she mentioned to a religious friend a‘
conviction that she should soon depart, wrote
several solemn and affectionate letters, not to
be communicated till after her decease, and a
paper, giving directions for a plain and private
funeral, and a grave without monument or in«
scription.

On the day of her death, she was in perfect
health, spent the evening cheerfully with a friend,
and retired at the usual hour to her chamber.
There, she was soon after found by her servant,
prostrate on the ﬂoor, and at the last gasp.

She died on Sunday, February 28th, 1737.
A religious book was found open by her, and a
paper on which she had written a few devout
thoughts. It was her stated hour for prayer.

munion with its God, passed to “his presence,
where is fulness of joy ; to his right hand, where

MRS. JERUSHA LATHROP.

MRS. JERUSHA LATHROP was born at Hart-
ford, Conn., May 10th, 1717. She was the
daughter of Governor Talcott, and enjoyed the
beneﬁt of the example of pious parents. She
early displayed an amiable disposition, a mind of
quick and strong powers, and an affectionate heart.

In those days, the advantages of school—educa-
tion could not be obtained, as they now are, by
all. The colony had been settled but little more
than eighty years. The hardships of those, who
had found it a wilderness, were freshly remem-
bered. Simplicity of living, and industrious
habits, still prevailed among the most wealthy
families.

The subject of this sketch used often to re-
mark, that she was never in a school—house in
her life. Still she received a good education.
The family of her parents was a school for her,
and their precept and example were her teachers.
There she learned what ﬁtted her for this life
and the next. .

Obedience and diligence, were the ﬁrst letters
in her alphabet. Lessons of piety began at her
cradle, and domestic industry with her early

THE cmL’s READING-BOOK. 161

childhood. She soon acquired the use of the
needle, and knitting-needles in all their varieties.
The foundation of good housekeeping, in which
she excelled throughout her life, was laid by her
mother, who permitted her to be an assistant in
her own employments, while she was yet a child.

Her intellectual culture was not neglected.
She had a great fondness for reading and writing.
Her acquaintance with the Standard authors of
the English language was thorough, and in poet-
ry she took high and deep delight. There was
then but few books. Yet from this scarcity she
derived the beneﬁt of reading with such careful
attention, as to impress their contents deeply on
her memory, and carry what she learned in youth,
to the close of a long life.  

She possessed herself of the accomplishments
which entered into the education of the daughters
ofthe wealthy. They were required by her sta-
tion. Instrumental music was not then number-
ed among them. But she became an adept in
vocal music, and had the gift of a voice of great

compass and melody.

Embroidery was much prized, and she ex-
celled in it. Chairs, curtains, toilets, and other
useful and ornamental articles, attested her skill
and persevering industry. To her many other
attainments, she added gentle, graceful, and dig-
niﬁed manners, thatraccomplishment which is
admired by all, and which never goes out of

162 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

fashion. She was taught the precept, that the
richest dress might become antiquated, and the
most beautiful face grow old, but good manners
were a garb ﬁtting for every occasion, and a lan-
guage understood in all lands.

At the age ofeighteen, she was married to Dr.
Daniel Lathrop, of Norwich, Conn. He was a
man of excellent talents and principles, and to

the best education which -this country afforded,

had added the advantage of several years resi-
dence in Europe. His mind was enlarged by
literary and scientiﬁc research, and it was his
pleasure to employ his fortune in encouraging
industrious enterprise, and drawing merit from
obscurity.

The young wife entered upon her new duties
with affectionate energy, and trust in Divine aid.
She made home a delightful spot to her husband,
and reciprocated his affection and conﬁdence.
She cheered by respect and attention the last
days of his aged father. She looked well to the
ways of her household, guided her servants with
discretion, and convinced them that she felt a
sincere interest in their welfare and improvement.

Moving in an elevated sphere, considered the
ornament and pride of the society in which she
mingled, and surrounded by all the elements of
conjugal felicity, the piety which early struck
deep root in her soul, gave her wisdom beyond
her years, and preserved her from the pride of

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 163

prosperity. In the important responsibilities of
a mother, she was faithful and exemplary.

She was blessed with three sons, beautiful in
person, and in mind. The eldest displayed great
maturity of intellect and character. He delight-
ed to sit as a solitary student, and store his
memory with sacred and sublime passages from
the best authors. The religious instructions of
his mother were his delight, and often, at his
hour of retiring, he would task with an interest-
ing. solemnity, “ Do you think I have done any
thing to—day to offend my Father in Heaven?”

The second had a form of grace, and a com-
plexion of feminine delicacy. The tones of his
voice promised to attain the melting richness of
his mother’s, as a bud opens into the perfect
ﬂower. The youngest, when he completed his
third year, was the picture of health, vigour, and
joy. Golden curls clustered around his broad,
lofty forehead, and his beautiful features were
radiant with the glow of intelligence, or the glad-
ness of mirth.

The eldest, the little student, as he was called,
had attained the age of seven years. Suddenly
he was smitten, while at his books, with a fatal
disease. One night he suffered; the next, he
was not among the living. Ere he was laid in
the tomb, the second drooped. Tears quivered
in his soft blue eyes, like dew in the bell of the
hyacinth. Yet, if he might lay his head upon

164 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

his mother’s bosom, he would endure without
repining.

The dying boy pressed his mother to sing the
hymn that he loved. She controlled her grief,
to cheer him once more with its trembling har-
mony. It was then that he breathed away his
soul, whispering of the angels and their celestial
melodies. The youngest was next taken. So
strongly did he struggle with the destroyer, and
so fearful were his agonies and convulsions, that
those who best loved him, coultl not but give
thanks when the beautiful clay was at peace.

These three lovely children were laid in one
grave, ‘in one week. The bereaved parents ever

‘continued childless. The mother was in her

twenty-sixth year, when this affliction came upon
her. She looked to him who had ordained it.
She strove to remember that her dear ones were
his. She exerted herself to sustain and cheer
her sorrowing husband, and laid open the burden
of her griefs only to the Father of her spirit.

She seriously examined her heart, to know
what evil or error it cherished, to render such
severe discipline necessary. This solemn inquiry
is revealed in a poem, which she composed during
the earlier stages of her mourning, from which
we extract the following lines, as a specimen of
the earnestness with which she desired to be
made better by the sorrow that had pierced her
heart

THE GInL’s READING-BOOK. 16-5

“‘ Oh, teach me why thou dost contend, and say
Thy comforts blasted, hasten to decay; V
Teach me the paths whereinl go astray ;
Reveal the secret errors of my way ;

Reform, correct,‘ subdue the offending mind,
Too often stubborn, impotent, or blind.”

A visible blessing descended upon her prayers
that this bereavement might be sanctiﬁed to her
improvement in piety. Her wounded sensibili-
ties subsided into that resignation which brings
peace, and into an untiring benevolence. Her
sympathies were quickened fdr all who mourned,
and she relieved the children of sorrow and pov-
erty with the benignity of an angel.

It was late in life, when the aﬂiiction of widow~
hood came upon her. She was appointed to
watch over her husband, during the painsof a
protracted sickness, and to mark with still keener
anguish the mental decay of him, who had been
her dearest friend and counsellor. “ 1 have seen
an end of all perfection,” said she, when his
strongeand brilliant mind yielded to the pressure
of sickness, and when he was laid in the grave
she put her whole trust in the widow’s God.

From that hour, she derived her chief solace
from doing good. She seemed to love the poor,
as if they were unfortunate members of her own
family. They came to her and received food and
clothing, kind words and religious counsel. Her
care for those in distress, knew no pause while
life lasted. Indeed, it extended beyond it, as

she left in her will a considerable sum, for the
payment of the taxes of the poor.

A few miles from the city where she resided,
was the remnant of a once powerful tribe of In-
dians. They had been invariably friendly to our
ancestors. They had supplied them with corn,
during the famine that sometimes oppressed the
infant colony, and had shed their blood in the
defence of their white friends. Now they had
become poor and despised. Their royal family
was extinct, and they were as strangers in the
land oftheir fathers. .

For them her sympathies were enlisted. She
proportioned her bounties to their needs. Her
friendly words, and courteous deportment, were
a cordial to their withered hearts. Particularly
at the stated festivals of Christmas, and Thanks-
giving, they were remembered. And when they
thronged to receive the bounty which she had
provided for them, she was often seen to regard
their meek and abject countenances with a tear-
ful, tender glance, remembering that they were
once the lords of the soil.

The poor red people of the forest, and the
sable African, she regarded with pitying kind-
ness. She strove to elevate their condition, and
to cheer them with hope, and to impress on them
the importance of right conduct, assuring them
that their souls were precious in the eye ofa
Redeemer. She informed herself of the state

TI-IE G1RL’s READING-BOOK. 167

of the sick poor, and sent them portions accord-
ing to their necessities. Her benefactions often
came so secretly, that the relieved party knew
not from whence they ﬂowed ; for she desired not
the praise of man.

There was nothing in which she more delight-
ed than to do good to children. She assisted in
the education of those, whose parents were in
restricted circumstances, and distributed useful
books to such as were unable to purchase them.
She formed an acquaintance with the teachers
of schools, and rewarded such of their pupils as
distinguished themselves by good scholarship,
and correct deportment.

She loved to surround herself on Saturday
afternoons, with the children of the ‘neighbour-
hood. She interested them with delineations of
birds, plants, and animals, which, with her scis-
sors or pencil, she rapidly and skilfully executed.
She charmed them with the melody and high
sentiment of her ancient songs, or touched their
hearts with the devout hymns with which her
memory was stored. She drew them around her
table, and dismissed them at sunset, with some
simple present, made happier and better by the
sacred instructions which she mingled with her
deeds of kindness.

She ever maintained the excellent custom of
bringing up some poor or orphan child as a do-
mestic. Many of these repaid her in their future

lives, by their respectability and piety, and felt
that it was a privilege to ‘have grown up under
the shadow of her wisdom. In the arrangement
of her household, she united prudence with a
liberal hospitality. She economized in her per~
sonal expenditure, that she might have the more
to give to those who needed.

She prized the intercourse of friendship. She
received friends at her house in a simple, unos-
tentatious manner, and delighted them with her
intelligent and instructive conversation. Espe-
cially she showed attention and respect to the
ministers of religion, and required all under her
roof to treat them with reverence. Fondness
for reading, ﬁlled the little vacancies of life, and
the strong and kind interest she took in those
around, particularly in all the young, served to
keep her mind unimpaired, and her feelings
vivid.

When more than fourscore years of age, her
light step, and animated aspect, surprised he-
holders. A ﬁne forehead, scarcely furrowed, a
clear, expressive eye, a tall and graceful person,
whose symmetry age had respected, and the
most affable and digniﬁed manners, rendered
her an object of interest to all who approached
her. To the last, her voice retained that musi-
cal and exquisite tone, which seemed an echo of
the soul’s harmony.

THE G1RL’s READING-BOOK. 169

Thus she lived, venerated, and imparting hap-
piness. The virtues which made her beloved,
continued to ﬂourish, and put forth new, fresh
blossoms, until her life’s end. They could not
wither, even amid the frosts of age, for their
root was an ever—living piety. There is no doubt
that her afflictions contributed to her excellence.
For when they fell upon her, with what seemed
a crushing weight, she cast away the selﬁshness
of grief, and took hold of the anchor of faith, and
the crown of charity.

The close of her life was like the fading ofa
serene Sabbath into the holy quiet of its evening.
As she entered her eighty-ninth year, a gentle
sickness was the herald of the last messenger.
On the morning of September 14th, 1805, her
spirit departed. So peaceful was the transition,
that the precise moment when sheceased to‘
breathe, could not be told by those who watched
over her pillow with ardent and grateful love.
“ But I heard a voice from heaven, saying,
Write, blessed are the dead that die in the
Lord.”

sions, then what we remember best, will shew
the capacity and temper of our mind.

We see one possessing an accurate knowledge
of historical facts, with their dates and eras, and
we say he has a taste for history. 4 Another re-
members narrative or poetry, and we say he has
a taste for works of imagination. Another re-
members fashions, amusements, pieces of scan-
dal. Do they not each know, that to an attentive
observer, they are holding up a mirror of their
mind ?

But if it is true, that we can remember what
we please, and when we please, can we also re-
member as much as we please? Not without
labour. The quavztity of what we remember,
depends as much on industry, as the quality does
on the taste and turn of mind.

Do you ﬁnd it difficult to remember what you
study? Quicken the motive. Ifa horse is dull,

the rider touches him with the spur. Believe

that your memory may be equally under your
own control. But you must take pains to acquire
that control.

Think of the loss that you sustain in devoting
time to the acquisition of knowledge, yet suffer-
ing that knowledge to escape. Suppose a farmer,
after labouring through the season, should neglect
to mow his grass, or to reap his wheat after it
had ripened, or to gather his corn i.nto the

MRS. HANNAH MORE‘.

M,R$e HANNAH MORE was born in the year
1745, at Stapleton, in the county of Gloucester,
England. She Was the youngest but one, of ﬁve
sisters. Her father received a learned education,
andvvas‘ initendeyd for the ministry. But a re-
verse of fortune Changed his destination, and he
became the teacher of a school, which, with close
ecﬁmﬂmy, aﬂbrded him a support.

Mrs, More’s, motheyr was the daughter of a
farmer. She had received only a plain educa-
tion; but her strong rnind_,good sense, and sound
judgment, and the activeipart she took in the
f'or»n1at:io.n_ of her children’s, early habits, con-
tributed essentially to their future success and
distinctiont.

The subject of this memoir, when very young,
exhibited great quickness of perception, and
thirst forknowledge. Bylistening to the lessons
given to her elder sisters, she made considerable
progress in reading, at three years old, and
learned to repeat the Catechism in such a man-—
ner as to call forth the wondering admiration of
the minister of the parish.

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 171

At eight, she was continually asking her father
about ancient history and the classics. As his
library was not furnished with the authors which
he had himself studied, he used to gratify her by
opening the stores of his own retentive memory.
Seated on his knee, the little girl listened with
eager attention to the revolutions of Greece and
Rome, and to the most striking events that diver-
sify the page of history.

He recited to her the speeches of heroes, ﬁrst
in their original languages, to gratify her ear with
the sound. Then he translated them into Eng-
lish. The parallel characters and precepts of
Plutarch, were a favourite part of these ﬁreside
discourses. Perhaps thus was unconsciously
laid, the foundation for that high morality which
pervaded her future writings.

He began also to instruct her in Latin and
mathematics. So astonishing was her progress,
that he began to be alarmed lest her mind should
be turned entirely from the duties of her ‘sex.
He ceased his instruction in these sciences. But
she pursued by herself the Latin classics, and so
thoroughly were the rudiments, imparted by her
father, engraved upon her docile mind, that she
used lever to say, that conversation with an en-
lightened parent, or» preceptor, was one of the
best modes of education.

At a still earlier age, whenever she could pos-
sess herself of a scrap of paper, it was her delight

1'72 THE emL’s READING-’-BOOK.

to cover it entirely with some little essay‘ or‘
poem. One of her highest anticipations was,
that she might one day be rich enough to have a
whole quire of paper. So striking were some of
the thoughts and expressions that she communi-
cated nightly to the sister with whom she slept,
that she would sometimes rise, and endeavour to
procure a light, and the cover of some old letter,
on which to write Hannah’s effusions, lest they
should escape from memory.

The eldest of her sisters was sent to school at
Bristol, that she might qualify herself‘ for a teach-
er. At the close of every week she returned
home, and diligently taught her sisters what she
had herself gained. This was the foundation of
the education of the distinguished Hannah More;
the knowledge gathered. from the lips of parents
and sisters, during the usual occupations of the
family.

She thus acquired the French language, and
by improving every opportunity of conversing in
it, when she met with natives of that country, of
cultivated minds, became distinguished for its
free and elegant use. In every study which she
attempted, her diligence and perseverance knew
no interruption. She felt the full importance of
acquiring knowledge, and m-ade vigorous efforts
to that end. Her love of goodness, was equal to
her love of knowledge, and God crowned both»
with success.

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 17 3

When she was twelve years old, her three
elder sisters commenced a boarding-school at
Bristol, and took her under their care. The
eldest was then but twenty years of age, yet,
with such ability and discretion was the establish-
ment conducted, that it immediately gained and
preserved a very high reputation.

The young teachers laboured to instil into the
minds of their pupils, the same exalted sense of
morality, and deep religious principle, which had
formed the basis of their own domestic education.
They never ceased to acknowledge the value of
the instruction of their pious parents, and the
pains they had taken to impress on their hearts
the sanctity of the Sabbath, and ofthe ordinances
of religion.

Their talented sister was careful to obey all
their rules. She testiﬁed her gratitude for the
heightened advantages of education, which she
enjoyed through their exertions. It was to aid
them in furnishing their scholars with some in-
teresting and moral composition to commit to
memory, and recite, that she wrote the pastoral
drama of the “ Search after Happiness.”

Thus it seems that her sweet, sisterly feeling
prompted her, when scarcely seventeen years old,
to take the first step in that career of authorship,
where, for the long period of seventy years, she
was to walk, improving and enlightening the
world. Before she arrived at the age of thirty,

174 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

she became generally known as a writer of great
ability, and the praises of her learning and
genius, reached her from the lips of the most
illustrious in the realm.

True piety preserved her from the vanity
which must else have destroyed her. She min-
gled in the circles of rank and fashion, only to
return with a wider experience, and a Warmer
zeal, to the labours of love that she had marked
out for herself’. She tasted of the World, that
she might overcome it. She was raised above
its temptations, by the grace of Him whom she
had sought in her youth, whose eye is ever upon
“ them that fear him, that hope in his mercy.”

We have not room, here to mention the various
character of her numerous and excellent works.
But her intellectual labours did not turn her
attention from the duties of religion and charity.
After the retirement of her sisters from the
school for young ladies, which they many years
conducted, she co-operated with them in estab-
lishing and teaching Sunday—schools in various
parishes.

She persevered in all that she attempted, not-
withstanding feeble health, and many attacks of
dangerous disease. Misconstruction and calumny
were sometimes her portion. But sherose above
them, and kept on her way rejoicing. The friend-
ship of the good and virtuous was her shield, in
all the attacks of enmity.

THE GIRL’s READING‘-BOOK. 175

In 1802 she erected a beautiful thatched cot-

tage, in an elevated and picturesque situation, to

which she gave the name of Barley-VVood.
There she retired with her sisters, and the
grounds were arranged and ornamented by their
united taste. She was herself exceedingly fond
of cultivating the beauties of nature ; and a cabi-
net table, from whence issued many a sheet for
the ediﬁcation ofmankind, was inlaid with small
diamond shaped pieces of wood, from trees which
her own hand had planted.

In this hallowed retreat, her three elder sisters
paid the debt of nature, according to the order
of their birth. Each had attained the age of
seventy-ﬁve years. In the autumn of 1819, the
youngest was taken, and the solitary survivor
bore these bereavements with that faith which
looks beyond the world, for a re-union with the
beloved. The affectionof this family of sisters,
had been ardent and without a cloud. The sup-
ports of piety were necessary to console the one
who was left, to ﬁnish her journey alone.

In 1828 she removed to Clifton. Though
more than fourscore years old, she still continued

to meet the claims of her correspondents, though

she desisted from the composition of large ‘vol-
umes. She excelled in the epistolary style, and
in speaking of it, says, “What I wish for in a
letter, is the picture of my friend’s mind, and the
common sense of his life. I want to know what.

176 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

he is saying anddoing; to have him showme the
inside of his heart without disguise. I have this
feeling when I write letters. If I seek wisdom
and lofty sentiment, I can ﬁnd them in books.”

The last letter which she wrote was in her
eighty-eighth year. To the close of her long life
her eye was not dim. She could easily read the
smallest print without spectacles. Her hearing
was but slightly impaired, and her features were
neither wrinkled nor uncomely. No impatient
expression was heard to escape her lips, even in
moments of the deepest suffering, and her beneﬁ-
cence and charitable feelings increased to the
last.

As she approached the verge of life, her vigour
of mind yielded to declining health; but the fer-
vour of her religious trust gained new strength.
Almost every thought was prayer. In the energy
of her expiring petitions, her friends, and those
who ministered around her bed, were earnestly
commended to the care of the Almighty.

She was continually blessing those around her,

as death approached. “ May we meet in an eter-
nal, a glorious world.” A friend mentioned her
good deeds,—-her labours of benevolence. “ Talk
not so vainly,” she replied. “I utterly cast them
from me. I fall low at the foot of the cross.”
So full of humility was one, who had been the
instrument of so great good in her day and
generation.

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 177

The night before her death, there was an un-
usual brightness in her countenance. Striving
to rise a little from her pillow, she stretched out
her arms, and uttered the name of her favourite
sister, the last who had died, and exclaimed, in a
clear voice, “ja_y.”’ as if she indeed welcomed
her. Then her pulse grew fainter, and she lay
for hours, as if in the gentle breathing of infant
sleep, broken occasionally by a sigh or groan. It
was early in the afternoon of September 7th,
1833, that she ceased to breathe.

In reading the works of this illustrious lady,
we are surprised both at their variety of subject,
and compass of thought. VVith equal ease, she
marked out the map of virtue for a princess, or
held the lamp of truth to the miserable colliers,
amid the darkness ofthe miiies. She could touch
the tenderest chords of the heart in her poem on
“ Sensibility,” or set forth the rudiments of a
peasant’s faith, in the ballad of “ Dan and Jane.”

She could descend to the simplest alphabet of
morality, in her tales of “The Postilion,” the
“ Poacher,” and the “ Orange-girl;” or soar to
the highest regions of sublimity, to portray the
lineaments of St. Paul, that “very chiefest of
the apostles.” * A mind, ﬁtted like hers to range
through the regions of fancy, and catch the rich-
ness of classic imagery, must be eminent in self-
control, thus to humble itself to the petty and

painful details of human wretchedness and vice.

Though the writings of Mrs. Hannah More

display such diversity, both in plan and style,

they always clearly keep in View the improve-
ment and beneﬁt of mankind. She never makes
Vice beautiful, that it may captivate the unguard-
°ed heart; or forms associations of thought, which
make work for repentance.

Some of her best works, have been devoted to
the good of her own sex. They have discoura-
ged triﬂing pursuits and frivolous pleasures, and
warned them of the power which they might
exercise, to elevate and purify society, without
departing from the sphere which Heaven had
enjoined.

The effect, as well as the tendency of her wri-
tings, has been salutary. It has been acknow-
ledged by politicians, that her native country has
proﬁted by their spirit of patriotism, and mascu-
line force of argument, which fearlessly admon-
ishing the highest ranks of their obligations, and
inciting indigence to its duty, laboured to rectify
public opinion, to remove prejudices against just
government, and to show, that the safety of a na-
tion is in the early and pious nurture of all its
children.

The diffusion of her works has kept pace with
their value. It may truly be said of them, that
“their speech has gone forth to the end of the
world.” Besides their wide circulation, wherever
her native tongue is spoken, some of them have

THE amt/s READING-BOOK. 179

been translated into the languages of France, of
Germany, of Greece, and of Ceylon.

In our country, they have been warmly wel-
comed, and highly appreciated. Companions of
the Bible, they have travelled with the family of
the emigrant to our remotest frontiers. Where
the axe of the woodman awakens echoes which
had slept from creation, the solitary matron is
cheered in her toils by “ Practical Piety ;” reads.
aloud by her evening ﬁreside, the “ Shepherd of
Salisbury Plain ;” or marks her little ones weep-
ing tender tears, at the story of the prophet in
his bulrush-cradle, upon the devouring Nile.

From youth, till the decline of a long life, it
was her business and her prayer, to sow the
seeds of virtue and of piety. Different nations
and tongues bring their tribute of gratitude, and
honour her memory. A blessing, most desirable
in this life, most powerful over the destinies of
the next, was granted her: the inﬂuence of mind
over mind. This, entering both the palace and
the cottage, made their inmates wiser and better.
It will continue to exist, when the distinctions of
rank are forgotten, and their proudest monuments
have mouldered into dust.

MRS. MARTHA LAURENS ._RAMSAY.

MARTHA LAURENS RAMSAY was born at
Charleston, (South Carolina,)November 3, 1759.
Her father, Colonel Henry Laurens, was con-
spicuous as .a man of talents, and a statesman.
Their ancestors were French protestants, or
Huguenots, who took refuge in this country,
“for righteousness sake,” during the persecu-
tions in the reign of Louis Fourteenth.

iHer love of knowledge was very early develo-
ped. At the age of three years, she could read
any English book without difficulty. She soon
added geography and arithmetic, a grammatical
knowledge of the French language, composition,
and mathematics.

She was assiduous in. abridging and tran-
scribing the authors that she read, and by her
diligence in impressing the substance of their
remarks, and sometimes their.words, laid, the
foundation for that wonderful memory by which
she was distinguished through life. Feminine
accomplishments, and the ornamental parts of
education, she was successful in acquiring. In-
deed, whatever study was recommended to her,

THE GmL’s READING-BOOK. 181

she pursued with such docility and ﬁxed atten-
tion, as enabled her to excel.

At the age of eleven, her excellent mother
died, and she, with her only sister, was placed
under the care ofa tender and pious aunt. Her
father went to Europe, to superintend the educa-
tion of his sons, and for the long period of eleven
years, she had no intercourse with him, except by
the pen. ,

This separation from a beloved father, with
the afflicting loss of her mother, had the effect to
draw her nearer to her heavenly parent. Her
religious impressions became distinctly visible,
and her conduct was evidently guided by hopes
that are not of this world.

Among her devotional papers, one was found,
after her decease, written when she was four-
teen years old, where, in a strain of fervent and
eloquent piety, which would do honour to the
most experienced Christian, she dedicates her-
self to the service of the Almighty. It was the
language of a heart, surrounded by the gayeties
of youth, and the allurements of wealth, devoting
itself to him, who has promised, that those “who
seek early, shall ﬁnd.”

She accompanied her uncle and aunt to Eng-
land, and there, at the age of sixteen, made a
public profession of her Christian faith. In this
act, she always rejoiced, as giving strength to
the conﬁdence which, from still earlier years,

16*

182 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

she had placed in her heavenly protector. She
now sought the society of the wise and pious, and
in a letter to a friend, says, “my highest ambi-
tion is, to have my will, in all things, subject to
the Divine will.”

The war between England and her native
country soon commenced, and her father was
called home, and appointed to an important sta-
tion in that arduous struggle. It was one of her
most painful trials, to hear him censured as an
ambitious, unprincipled man, and a fomenter of
discord between Great Britain and the colonies.
But armed with the meekness which cometh
from above, she replied not to these revilings, but
poured out her sorrows in secret prayer.

While her father ﬁlled the oﬂice of President
of Congress, foreseeing that peril must long
overshadow the land, he wrote his daughter to
prepare for a reverse, and even, if it were neces-

sary, to obtain a subsistence by her own labour. ,

“ If instead of affluence,” said he, “to which you
have still a just claim, servitude should be your
portion, meet it with an honest and pious heart,
like one who has been neither affectedly, nor
fashionably religious.”

In 1778, she passed with her uncle, aunt, and
sister, to France. Their native country was now
the seat of war. To obtain remittances, became
more and more difficult. But the evils of poverty
in a foreign land, to those who had been always

THE Gu1L’s READING-BOOK. 183

accustomed to the indulgences of wealth, were
borne without repining, and mutual aﬁ"ection
sweetened their frugal repast.

The health of her uncle became so feeble,
that he resigned all hope of recovery. Her
father, sent to England on business for his
country, was thrown a prisoner into the Tower,
on a charge of high treason, and in danger of
his life. Charleston was in the hands of the
enemy ; Carolina overrun by their armies; and,
as the climax of her sorrows, news came, that
her beloved brother, John Laurens, had fallen in
battle.

Now, the value of that religion, which she had
chosen in childhood, was fully revealed. She
was enabled to endure, without murmuring, and
even cheerfully. In her journal, she writes,
“My soul, be of good courage. Wait on the
Lord. He shall strengthen thee. Thou shalt
not have one more trial more than is necessary.
The cross shall never be heavier than thou canst
bear.”

Ere long, hope began to dawn upon the desti-
nies of her native land. Her father was released
from prison, and entrusted with public negotia-
tions to the court of France. She was summoned
to join him in Paris, and who can tell the rapture
with which, for the ﬁrst time for almost twelve
years, she received his paternal embrace.

184 THE e1RL’s READING-BOOK.

The change was great, from the privations of
poverty, the toil of the nurse’s chamber, and the
solitude of a remote country village, to the head
ofthe table of a minister-plenipotentiary, in the
gayest metropolis of the gayest clime of Europe.
This, to many young ladies, would have been
dangerous. But the religion which had support-
ed her in adversity, was her protection in pros-
perity.

Amid the ﬂatteries that surrounded her, the
Bible was her daily study. In her journal, she
thus Writes, when about to join a splendid and
fashionable party. “Enable me so to demean
myself, that all may take knowledge of me, that
I have been with Jesus. Let the law of kind-
ness dwell upon my tongue, and teach me to
discountcnance sin, in the spirit of humility.”

Her father having been long prevented by the
obstructions of war, from making her his usual
remittances, now gave her at one time, the sum
of ﬁve hundred guineas. Long compelled to ob-
serve the most rigid economy in her wardrobe,
did she not now indulge in the purchase of those
expensive articles, which she saw continually
worn by people with whom she associated?

She applied only a small part to her own use,
and that for articles of obvious necessity. With
the remainder, she bought one hundred French
testaments, and distributed to the poor, estab-V

lished a school in the village where she had re-
sided, engaged a master, and constituted a fund
for the permanent support of the institution.

The uncle, who had so kindly been her pro-
tector, during her separation from the paternal
roof, died in France, of the disease which had
for years marked his life with suffering. Being
childless, it was his intention to leave the princi-
pal part of his fortune to the favourite niece,
Whose cheerful services in his sick chamber,
during their restricted circumstances, had been
so constant and invaluable.

She was apprized of this design, and with her
usual disinterestedness, expressed an urgent de-
sire, that her sister and brothers might share in
his bounty. The will was altered to gratify her
Wishes, but the uncle also indulgedphimself, by
leaving her a bequest of ﬁve hundred pounds
sterling, expressly stating it to be “ an acknow-
ledgment for her many services to him, and to
his family, and for her good and gentle conduct
at "all times.”

Her gratitude, on her return to her native
country, was unbounded, to ﬁnd it, after her ten
years exile, in peace, freedom, and maintaining
a rank among the nations ofthe earth. Not long
after, she became the wife of Dr. David Ramsay,
a man highly respected for his eminence in science
and literature, and capable of appreciating the
worth of the companion whom he had chosen.

186 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

Her conduct in the station of a wife, the mis-
tress of a household, and the mother of children,
shone forth as an example to all. She lightened
the burden of her husband’s cares, and assisted
him, as far as possible, in his literary and pro-
fessional labours. In times of general sickness,
she sought out, in various books, cases of pecu-
liar importance, and related to him, or present-
ed, in one view, the opinions ofstandard, medical
authors.

In the ﬁrst sixteen years after her marriage,
she became the mother of eleven children. In
their care and education she was indefatigable.
In every season of sickness and pain, she was
their most watchful, tender nurse. She sought
to procure for each a good constitution, and a
well-regulated mind.

She taught them industry, and as they gained
vigour, inured them to fatigue and occasional
hardship. She required them to restrain their
tempers; to subject their desires to the control
of reason and religion; to practise self-denial;
to bear disappointment; to resist the importa-

nity of present pleasure or pain, for the sake of

what wisdom and experience pronounced neces-
sary to be done, or to be suffered.

Their duty to God, she impressed on them
while their minds were tender. That they might
read the Bible with pleasure, she connected with
it, when they were quite young, a set of prints;

THE GmL’s READING-BOOK. I87

and, as they advanced in understanding, added
such works as unite uninspired to sacred history,
and the Old to the New Testament.

Thus, to the minds of her children, the Bible,
though written at widely remote periods, was
presented as an uniform, harmonious system of
divine truth. The voice of a revered mother
was continually heard, enjoining upon them to
read daily a portion from its blessed pages, with
prayer, and to view it as the rule of their duty,
the source of their eternal hope.

She constantly assisted their progress in useful
knowledge, and took the whole superintendence
oftheir education. For the use of her first chil-
dren she compiled a grammar of the English

which were then the only ones she could obtain,
subject to the comprehension of unfolding in-
tellects.

She prepared questions for them in ancient
and modern history, which they were expected to
answer from their general knowledge, and in
their own language. From her accurate ac-
quaintance with French, she excelled in it as a
teacher; and for their sakes she studied the
Greek and Latin classics, so as to become a
proﬁtable instructor in those languages.

With the same ardour to advance the education
of her children, she studied botany, and refresh-
ed her knowledge of natural and civil history,

biography, astronomy, chronology, philosophy,
and an extensive course of voyages and travels.
She gave her instructions with regularity, and
thus conducted her daughters at home through
the studies and accomplishments taught at board-
ing—scl1ools, and her sons through a course of
training, which ﬁtted them to enter college.

She endeavoured to render the Sabbath, 3.
season both proﬁtable, and pleasant, to all the
young around her. A part of the intervals of
divine worship was spent in reading religious
books with her children and servants, and in ex-
amining them respecting the sermons, of which
she frequently wrote an abridgment from memo-
ry. She also read the New Testament in Greek
with her sons, and in French with her daughters.

She was exceedingly strict in her improvement
of time. By rising early, she secured the best
part of the day for devotion, for the necessary
duties of a housekeeper, and for the instruction
of her children. A portion of each day was
devoted to a course of reading, and also to the
practice of needlework, in which useful art she
rendered her daughters expert, and insisted even
amidst the heat of a Carolina summer, on their
systematic industry.

The amount of her writing was wonderful.
Besides her diary, she had an extensive corres-
pondence. She excelled in the epistolary style.
Some of her letters to her eldest son, while absent

at college, are appended to her memoir. She
copied for her husband the whole of his “ History
ofthe American Revolution,” “Life of Wash-
ington,” “ Review ofthe Progress of Medicine in
the Eighteenth Century,” and all the earlier part
of his “ Universal History.”

She wrote rapidly, aniid also a very legible and
beautiful hand. It was a rule with -her, that
whatever was done, should be done well. She
had been in the habit of transcribing original
papers for her father, as well as her husband,
and he pronounced her the best clerk he had
ever employed, though, in his extensive public
business, he had many of superior excellence.

Her memory was remarkably retentive, and she
strengthened it by continual exercise. Though
she read many books, their substance remained
with her. Of some, she was able to repeat nearly
the whole. Her acquaintance with the Scrip-
tures was so intimate, that she could readily
quote, or turn‘ to any passage bearing upon the
subject of conversation.

For her astonishing amount of industrious per-
formance, and her uniform excellence in every
relative duty, she derived strength from her spirit
of piety. She lived a life of prayer. In every
important transaction, in the midst of her daily
cares, she poured her anxieties into the ear of
her heavenly Father, solicited his direction, and
brought the tribute of her grateful praise.

proclaim its inﬁrmities. Do not say I have for-
gotten, and feel no shame. You do not like to
have your faults published. At least you are not
bound to proclaim them yourself.

Let us rather believe. that you have a good
memory, or at least that you will take pains to
ma-ke it so. If you desired a boy to be active
and healthy, would you conﬁne him to the house

not say to him, “go, and climb the rocks, and
work in the open air.” So, give your memory
daily exercise, and do not shrink from that which
is severe.

When you read or hear what you wish to re-
member, think of nothing else. Fix your atten-
tion, till you have done studying or listening.
Think it over, and repeat it to yourself, till it is
well committed. If it is alesson, be prepared to
recite it without mistake. If it is a lecture, or a
sermon, or any thing addressed to the ear, speak
of it to others, till it is rendered familiar to
yourself. ’

In her last sickness, she earnestly admonished
all around her to seek God by prayer, and to
make him their conﬁdence; She asked her hus-
band and children, about four o’clock in the after-

noon of June 10th, 1811, if they were willing to

give her up. Perceiving that they hesitated, she
assured them that the reluctance which she had
felt to part with them, was now removed by the
mercy of God, and expired.

MRS. MARY ANN HOOKER.

MRS. MARY ANN HOOKER, whose original
name was Brown, was the daughter of pious,
and highly respectable parents, and born at
Guilford, Connecticut, February 12th, 1796.

She possessed a quick perception, and knew the

alphabet before the age of two years, and read

well, atthree. .

She early manifested a great love of books.
They were her -chosen companions. To read,
and to think, were her great pleasures, while

other children were engaged in noisy sports.

But if she loved to meditate by herself, she was

not selﬁsh, and she regarded her companions

with tender interest. .

She was a warm admirer of the works of
nature. The simplest wild—ﬂower was dear to
her. The plants, as they sprang up in her little
garden,-——the grassy path, where she took her

rural walk,-——-the green’, shady trees,---and the

Chrystal, tuneful brooks, were her friends.

Her moral sensibilities were equally strong.
To do right, to avoid wounding the feelings of
othe-rs,,and, always to speak truth‘, were her rules

192 THE e1RL’s READING-BOOK.

of action. Her conscience was tender, and if
she had committed any fault, she acknowledged
it with frankness.

Her warm affections and integrity of purpose,
were associated with a mind of a high order,
anxious to acquire knowledge. She received the
advantages of an excellent education, and appli-
ed herself to her various studies, with assiduity
and success.

She was afavourite with her teachers. They
were gratiﬁed by her proﬁciency, and pleased
with her amiable disposition. She had many
written testimonials of her good scholarship, and
exemplary deportment from them, which she
affectionately prized, and preserved among her
most valuable papers.

After her removal to Hartford, Connecticut,
and the completion of her own term of school-
study, she engaged in the instruction of young
ladies. She realized the importance of this sta-
tion, and while she conferred beneﬁts on her
pupils, reaped the reward prepared for every
faithful teacher,—-increase in knowledge, and
habits of self—control.

She was a favourite in the reﬁned society,
where she moved, and particularly excelled in
the graces of conversation. Yet no one could be
more free from vanity. “In all lowliness of
mind, she esteemed others better than herself ;”
for she had taken the Inspired Volume, as the

THE c;mL’s READING-BOOK. I93

rule of her conduct, and had early professed her-
selfa follower of Christ.

In friendship, she was ﬁrm, affectionate, and
conﬁding. Though she regarded all with whom
she associated, with Christian kindness, she re-
served intimacy for a few kindred spirits. To
them her sympathy was overﬂowing, both in sor-
row, and in joy, and she forgot herself, when they
might be served, praised, or comforted.

In 1822, she married the Rev. Horace Hooker,
and removed to a retired parish, in her native
State. The responsibilities of a pastor’s wife,
she deeply realized, and endeavoured faithfully
to discharge. While exciting the females of her
husband’s ﬂock, to works of benevolence and
piety, she strove also to advance their intellectual
improvement.

She established among them, stated meetings,
for the reading of historical and religious works,
and especially for the interchange of written
thought. In the latter department, she emphati-
cally led the way, and bore the burden; and
some of the most pleasing effusions of her pen,
were thus called forth, in the form of essays, on
various important subjects.

A solicitation that her husband would superin-
tend a religious periodical publication, induced
their return to Hartford, and her more decided
entrance on literary occupation. Their congen-

iality of intellectual taste, and pursuit, was a
17*

194 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

source of great happiness, and added a new, and
rare element to their mutual affection.

His kind encouragement gradually overcame
her self-distrust, so that she at length consented
to devote her pen to the religious instruction of
children. Her ﬁrst work, was entitled “Bible
Sketches,” and is written with simplicity and
beauty.

She wrote also the lives of David and Daniel,
of Elijah and Elisha. For this series of Scrip-
ture Biographies, she read extensively such books
ot'History and Travels, as bore upon her subjects,
or illustrated the geography, natural history, and
customs of the countries where her scenes were
laid.

She did not present to the public, that which
cost her no labour, and felt that without patient
study, and earnest prayer, she had no right to
expect success. Her books, became favourites
not only with the young, to whom they were
addressed, but to parents, who peruse them with
their children.

As a convincing proof of the high estimation,
in which these admirable works are held, it is
proper to mention, that the “Bible Sketches,”
soon after their publication, were translated into
German, for the beneﬁt of that portion of our
population, who speak and read that language.’

The “ Life of Daniel,” which was the fruit of

much study and research, was translated into

THE GmL’s READING-BOOK. 195

Bengalee, at Calcutta, and published there: and
the “ Life of Elijah,” one of the most beautifully
written, of her sacred biographies, is in. the pro-
cess of translation into the same dialect.

Both the “Life of Daniel” and the Life of
Elijah,” were translated into the language of
the Hindoos, by two English missionaries at
Benares; and it is pleasant to think that the
swarthy tribes of the Ganges, and other benight-
ed people of Asia, may gather sacred instruction
from the pages over which she laboured.

Her last work, was entitled the “ Seasons,”
and its object is to bring the unfolding mind, into
such familiarity with the objects of nature, with
birds, plants, animals, trees, rocks and waters, as
to lead it to recognize and love, the Creator of so
much beauty, and the Author of every blessing.

These literary occupations beguiled the hours
of ill health, and seclusion, to which she was
frequently subject, and the consciousness that
they had been in many cases, the means of good
to others, imparted cheerfulness and gratitude.
Her pen was such a source of happiness, that
bodily inﬁrmity was often forgotten or unfelt.

In her journeys, she was a close observer, both
ofthe face of nature, and the works of art. To
the sublime and beautiful, her heart was ever
open. The awful majesty of Niagara,the lonely
grandeur of the VVhite Mountains, or the freckle
9f the simplest ﬂower that trembled at their base,

touched the exquisite sensibility of her heart, and
told it of the Mighty Maker.

But her health, which had from childhood been
feeble, began visibly to decline. Symptoms of
pulmonary consumption were plainly revealed.
Her physicians prescribed that she should take
shelter from the winter, beneath a milder sky,
and her husband and sister, bore her, in the au-
tumn of 1837, to the sunny c-lime of Georgia.

She returned, the following Spring, no more
to go forth amid the soft, grassy paths she had
loved, or to mark the fresh swelling buds on her
favouritetrees, but to die. The frame, wasted
to a skeleton, and the hollow, racking cough,
told that she had come back, to die.

But there was peace in her heart. The Sa-
viour, whom she had trusted from her youth up,
remembered her, in her time of need. The
Bible which she had loved, and obeyed, was her
stay, as she passed through the dark. valley.
Like a child, yielding to its parents, she laid
herself in the Everlasting arms.

VVhen sometimes from extreme weakness, her
mind wandered, sweet words were upon her lips,
and bright images gleamed around her. She
smiled on those who stood by her bed, and forget-
ting that she herself suffered, begged them to
take refreshment and repose.

She murmured in a low tone, of jessamine—
bowers, and orange-groves, and hovering forms,

brighter and more lovely than she had ever seen
before. The beautiful things of Nature, which
from earliest memory she had loved, tarried with
her, till the angels came.

It was on the morning of May 3d, 1838, that
Death came upon her like a friend, soothing her
into gentle slumber. Without gasp or struggle,
she slept in Jesus, “ patience having had its per-
fect work.”

Let the young, in forming their own charac-
ters, be assiduous to secure the same sources of
happiness, which cheered this lovely and exem-
plary woman, and enabled her during long debil-
ity, and decline, to comfort others with her own
radiant countenance, and to close her life like a
music-strain.

One of these sources of happiness was her
sweet fellowship with the works of nature. She
held pleasant communion with ﬂowing streams,
and tuneful birds, the simple plants, and the
solemn stars. This love of the beauties, and
wonders of creation, increased with years, and
made. even the gift of wild ﬂowers, in her chamber
of sickness, a fresh and deep delight.

Her intellectual tastes, were also sources of
happiness. Books, reflection, and the habit of
expressing her thoughts on paper, made her
childhood wise, and her whole life a scene of im-
provement. Her mind, expatiating on useful,
and sacred themes, imparted to the young, its

own rich stores of knowledge, and found a bless-
ing in the gift.

Her amiable, and disinterested character, her
rectitude of heart, her transparency of purpose,
leaving her nothing to conceal, her ﬁdelity in
friendship, her warm sympathy for others woe,
the enduring piety, on which all these virtues and
graces rested, constituted an example which none
could View without love, and which all might de-
sire to imitate.

Green trees shall wave above thee,
That dread no wintry snow,

Meek ﬂowers that learn’d to love thee,
Around thy grave shall blow,

And faithful hearts, and tender,
Full oft shall linger nigh,

Their tribute-tear to render,
And learn of thee, to die.

At the close of the year, or on your birth-day,
read attentively in your note—book, what you have
treasured through that year. Summon memory
to draw the hints out at large, and embody them
in language. Make a new note-book for the
coming year, and write it neatly and legibly, that
you may read it easily if you live to be old, and
your eyes are dim.

You need not conﬁne this habit ofwriting brief
notes, or texts for memory, to the time that you
attend school. It would be well to continue it
through life. For as long as we live, we have
the privilege of being learners, and this life is a
school in which we ﬁt for a higher state of being.

The hints which you will thus accumulate, will
furnish good subjects of conversation with your
family when you have one, and aid you in teach-
ing your children. They will be as the book of
recipes to a housekeeper, to which she refers for
the comfort of'- those she loves. They will sup-
ply memory with texts from which she may
preach many a profitable sermon when her pul-
pit is the arm-chair by the ﬁre-side, and her au-
dience a group of listening grandchildren.

When you ﬁnd in yourlessons, or in books that
you read, trains of thought that are difﬁcult to
remember, class them with some recollections
that are similar, or even in contrast. Associate
them with some numerical statement. Cluster
them like grapes, when you give them into the

MY friend, I gave a glad assent
To your request at noon,

But now I ﬁnd I cannot leave
My little ones so soon.

I early came, and as my feet
First entered at the door,
“ Remember,” to myself I said,
“ You must dismiss at four.”

But slates, and books, and maps appear,
And many a dear one cries,

“ Oh, tell us Where that river runs,
And ‘where those mountains rise;

And where that blind old monarch reign’d,
And who was king before,

And stay a little after ﬁve,
And tell us something more.”

And then ‘my silent”“ darling comes,
And who unmoved can view,

The glance of that imploring eye,
“ Oh, teach me something too.”

Ye; who would think amid the toil,
(Tho’ scarce a toil it be,)

That through the door, the muses coy,
Should deign a glance at me.

Their look is somewhat cold and stem,
As if they meant to say,

“ We did not know you kept a school,
We must have lost our Way.”

Their visit was but short, indeed,
As these light numbers show;

But,.oh ! they bade me write with speed,
“ My friend, I cannot go.”

THE LADY BUG AND THE ANT.

THE lady-bug sat in the rose’s heart,

And smil’d with pride and scorn,
As she saw a plain-drest ant go by,
With a heavy grain of corn;

So she drew the curtains of damask round,
And adjustediher silken vest,

Making her glass of a drop of dew,
That lay in the rose’s breast.

Then she laugh’d so loud, that the ant looked up,
And seeing her haughty face,

Took no more notice, but travell’d on
At the same industrious pace.

But a sudden blast of autumn came,
And rudely swept the ground,

And down the rose with the lady-bug fell,
And scatter’d its leaves around.

Then the houseless lady was much amaz’d,
And knew not Where to go,

For hoarse N ovember’s early blast,
Had brought both rain and snow.

204 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

Her wings were chill, and her feet were cold,
And she wish’d for the ant’s warm cell,

And What she did when the Winter came,
I’m sure I cannot tell.

But the careful ant was in her nest,
' With her little ones by her side,
She taught them all like herself to toil,
Nor mind the sneer of pride.

And I thought, as I sat at the close of day,
Eating my bread and milk,

It was Wiser to Work and improve my time,
Than be idle and dress in silk.

THE ARK AND DOVE.

“ TELL me a storjr, please,” my little girl

Lisp’d from her cradle. So I bent me down,

And told her how it rain’d, and rain’d, and rain’d,
Till all the ﬂowers were cover’d, and the trees
Hid their tall heads, and where the houses stood,
And people dwelt, a fearful deluge roll’d ;
Because the world was wicked, and refus’d

To heed the words of God.

But one good man,

Who long had warn’d the wicked to repent,

Obey, and live, taught by the voice of heaven,
Had built an ark; and thither, with his wife

And children, turn’d for safety. ‘Two and two,
Of birds and beasts, and creeping things, he took,
With food for all; and when the tempest roar’d,
And the great fountains of the sky pour’d out

A ceaseless ﬂood, till all beside were drown’d,
They in their quiet vessel dwelt secure.

And so theinighty waters bare them up,
And o’er the bosom of the deep they sail’d
For many days. But then a gentle dove
’Scap’d from the easement of the ark, and spread
Her lonely pinion o’er the boundless Wave.
All, all was desolation.’ Chirping nest,

Nor face ofman, nor living thing she saw,

For all the people of the earth were droWn’d,
Because of disobedience.

Nought she spied,

Save wide deep waters, and dark, frowning skies,
Nor found her weary foot a place of rest.

So, with a leaf of olive in her mouth,

Sole fruit of her drear voyage, which, perchance,
Upon some Wrecking billovv ﬂoated by,

VVith drooping wing the peaceful ark she sought.
The righteous man that wandering dove receiv"d,
And to her mate restor’d, Who, with sad moan,
Had Wondered at her absence.

Then I look’d

Upon the child, to see if her young thought
Wearied with following mine. But her blue eye
Was a glad listener, and the eager breath

Of pleas’d attention curl’d her parted lip.

And so I told her how the waters dried,

And the green branches wav’d, and the sweet buds
Came up in loveliness, and that meek dove
Went forth to build her nest, and thousand birds
Awoke their songs of praise, while the tir’d ark
Upon the breezy breast of Ararat

Repos’d, and Noah, with glad spirit, rear’d

An altar to his God.

When to her rest, ere evening’s earliest star,

hand of memory. Like pearls on a string, they
will be less liable to be lost, than when scattered
abroad.

I once heard a little girl say, “I have just
learned that Jupiter has four moons. Now I will
remember it, by joining it with other things that
have in them the number four. There are four
seasons, four middle states, four asteroids, or

little planets, and the other thing of four, shall

be the moon of Jupiter.” The child had discov-
ered the principle of numerical association, which
is a great help to memory.

“Romulus slew his brother Remus,” said a
little boy, “and Cain slew his brother Abel.
The ﬁrst-born of Eden, and the ﬁrst king of
Rome, were fratricides. One will make me re-
member the other.” Here was resemblance or
similitude in fact, assisting the memory. Con-
trasted images may also be so associated, as to
adhere strongly to recollection.

Count no toil too great, that will give vigour
to memory. She is to walk with you as a com-
panion through life. It is important that she be
healthful and ﬁt for her work. She is the keep-
er of knowledge, The wealth of the mind is in
her casket. She has power over the fountains
of pleasure, and of pain.

But she has still an higher ofﬁce. Her smile
can give conﬁdence to goodness, and enter as

sunshine into the soul. Yet dread her frown, if

GIVER of light !—Who point’st the glorious sun
His destin’d way, and callest every star

Forth by its name, and causest day and night
To know their order, and to speak thy praise,
All powerful One, to whom Creation sings

Its early rnatin, may my humble prayer

Blend with that chorus, while the rising dawn
Dispels the shadows and the damps of night.

Go forth my soul, on high devotion’s wing,
And bear glad praises to thy Maker’s ear,

Ere day awakes, or the rejoicing sun

Looks from his chamber on the blushing morn.

Oh Thou, whose throne is in the circling heavens,
‘Where the veil’d seraphs stand, thou wilt not scorn
The incense of the heart, though feebly pour’d,

Or sometimes mix’d with tears, for thou dost know
My frame, and thou rememberest I am dust.

But yet thine hand did mould this mass of clay,
And thy breath quicken it, nor should I blush
To lift my face to thee, to speak thy name,
And call thee Father, had not sin so stain’d,
Marr’d, and defac’d thy work.

Yet hear my prayers,
And as a parent guides and guards a child
Oft Wandering, yet belov’d, so guide thou me
This day.

From snares of youth, from hidden ills,

Fruitless resolves, and fancies roving Wild,

From vanity and pride, and dark deceit,

Or whatsoever else might wake the sting

Of conscience, wound another’s peace, or break
Thy holy law, save me this day, 0 God.

And let a Warning voice say to my soul,

The pure and Watchful eye of the high Judge
Is on thy Ways, and still a viewless pen
Moves, never weary, to record thy deeds,
Thy words, thy secret motives, on a page
Not perishable, which the ﬂame that burns
The scorch’d and shrivel’d skies, shall so reveal,
That every eye may read.

' Father, thou know’st

All my temptations, my adversities,

My Weaknesses and errors ; suit thy gifts
Unto my needs, and not to my deserts
Imperfect.

Yet so guide me here on earth,

That when I leave it, I may see thy face,
Where evil cannot come. So shall my prayer
Rise ceaseless to thee, and my soul shall rest
Upon thine arm of love, through every scene

And let my grateful strain, Giver of Good,

Rise with acceptance fromithis house of clay,
This brittle tenement, Soon crush’d and broke;
Yea, bid me on the cold, dark ﬂood of death,

Be joyful in thee,—--bid me wake the harp

Of seraph rapture, hymning to the praise

Of Him who was, and is, and is to come,

When time shall be no more, and death shall die.

BIRTH-DAY REQUESTS.

OH Thou, Whose tireless,~ever-Watchful care,
Presents another year, and wakes the prayer,
Guide thou my steps,—-direct my doubtful course,
Crush vain resolves, and error’s dangerous force,
Impart the meek desire, the hope sublime,

And thoughts that soar above the scenes of time.

Grant thou, the zeal that seeks another’s good,
And sets the seal to duty understood,

The humble mind, the sympathy sincere,

For joy, the smile—for misery, the tear,

Balm for the Wounded—for the drooping, aid,

A tranquil trust, when ills of life invade,

The conscience clear, that soothes to sweet repose,
And the warm thrill that pure devotion knows.

Let ardent love to those who kindly strew
My path with ﬂowers, be every morning new,
And lead me onward thro’ each fair degree,
Of gratitude to them and trust in Thee.

What shall I ask, or what refrain to say’!
Where shall I point, or how conclude my lay 2
So much my weakness needs-—so of’: thy voice,
Assures that weakness, and conﬁrms my choice.

Oh, grant me active days of peace and truth,
Strength to my heart, and Wisdom to my youth,
A sphere of usefulness——a soul to ﬁll

That sphere with duty, and perform thy will.

But when, at last, the heavy shades shall fall
Of that dark night which comes but once to all,
Whether in youth, maturity, or age,

Let thy kind voice my rising pains assuage,
My hopes sustain, my gathering fears remove,
And ﬁll my spirit with thy pardoning love.

Then strong in faith, I’d dare the threatening tide,
Which this dark world from that of bliss divides,
Raise the dim eye to drink the smile of heaven,
Nerve the faint heart that feels its sins forgiven,
Meet with calm brow the billovvs’ deafening roar,
And land victorious on the eternal shore.

Whose root is in the lowly mind,
Wliose blossom in the sky.

Nor think how future years,

Cold treachery’s serpent-n1oan—
Ills that the tender heart must bear
Unanswering and alone.

CHILD AT THE MOTIIER’S GRAVE.

MY Inother’s grave ! ’Tis there beneath the trees,
I love to go alone, and sit, and think,

Upon that grassy mound. My cradle hours

Come back again so sweetly, when I Woke

And lifted up my head, to kiss the cheek

That bowed to meet me.

And I seem to feel

Once more the hand that smooth’d my clustering curls,
And led me to the garden, pointing out

Each fragrant ﬂower and bud, or drawing back

My foot, lest I should careless crush the Worm

That craWl’d beside one.

And that gentle tone,
Teaching to pat the house-dog, and be kind
To the poor cat, and spare the little ﬂies
Upon the Window, and divide my bread
With those that hunger’d, and bow meekly down
To the gray-headed man, and look with love
On all Whom God had made.

And then her hymn

And folded closely to her bosom, sat

But when I go
To my lone bed, and ﬁnd no mother there,
And weeping kneel to say the prayer she taught,
Or when I read the Bible that she lov’d,
Or to her vacant seat at church draw near,
And think of her, a voice is in my heart,
Bidding me early seek my God, and love
My blessed Saviour.-—

Sure that voice is her’s,--

I know it is, because these were the words

She us’d to speak so tenderly, with tears,

At the still twilight-hour, or when we walk’d
Forth in the Spring amid rejoicing birds,

Or whispering talk’d beside the winter ﬁre.

ORDER.

“ MOTHER, will you please to tell me if you
have seen my thimble ?”-—“ Martha, I thought
you had a place for your thimble.”—-“ So I have,
dear mother, but it does not happen to be in the
place.”

To have a place for things, and not keep them
in it, is like having wise laws, and paying no re-
gard to them. A nation will not be the better for
its laws, unless it enforces them ; nor a child for
being told its duty, unless it tries to obey.

Martha’s fault was a want of order. Her
working-materials were scattered about the
house. She was obliged to spend much time in
searching for them. When the school-bell rang,
some of her books could not be found. Perhaps,
her bonnet, or shawl, or gloves, were mislaid.

She felt ashamed to be so often inquiring for
what she ought to have kept in their own place.
So, she sometimes went without necessary arti-

cles, and was unprepared at school, or looked

slovenly in the street.

She was a little girl of a good disposition.
But this fault occasioned her to be much blamed.
And instead of being cheerful with a conscious-

SCHOLAR’S TRIBUTE TO AN INSTRUCTOR.

As when an eye, accustomed to survey

The changeful aspect of an April day,

Turns hack regretful to the purple dawn,

Or morning’s rose-tint on the dewy lawn ;

So I, from life’s delusions, vain and wild,

Retrace the scenes that charm’d’ me when a child.

Yet most I love those softly blending shades,
Where youth just glimmers, and where childhood
fades,

And ’mid that cherish’d imagery I see,

Revered instructor, many a trace of thee,

Thy footsteps on the grass, all fresh with dew,

Thy gentle hands where early snow-drops grew.

Too oft had critic rigour harshly doom’d

My buds of promise, withering ere they bloom’d,
Or cold neglect appa1l’d with freezing eye

A lonely mind, that shrank, it knew not why ;
But thou didst stoop to shield that timid mind,
Wise as a teacher, as a parent kind,

With studious care, its wayward course to lead,
And nurse the music of the whispering reed.

A plant of feeble stem, thou would’st not mock,
Rude as the ﬂowers that clothe the Alpine rock,
Nor blight its tendrils with a causeless pang,
Nor scorn it, though from lowly bed it sprang;
But Watch’d its rooting with a ﬂorist’s care,
Rais’d its wan blossoms to a genial air,

And o’er its narrow leaves, and bending head,
Pure dews of knowledge and of virtue shed.

Even now of stature frail, and low degree,

More weak and worthless than it ought to be,
It turns to him its shrinking buds that blest,
And pours fresh fragrance from a grateful breast.

Yet more than what I speak, to thee I owe,

And richer gifts than strains so weak can show ;
Thy Warning voice allur’d my listening youth

To seek the paths of piety and truth,

And heaven’s ﬁrst hopes, as vernal sunbeams roll,
Dawn’d from thy prayers upon my waiting soul.

Oh, ever free from pain, and doubt, and strife,
Flow on the current of thy tranquil life,

Pure as the streams that o’er white pebbles glide,
Andmix reproachlelss with a mightier tide,

Bright as the star, whose trembling lamp on high
Precedes the mom, and gilds the evening sky,
Till time’s brief tide the eternal sea shall stay,
And earth’s dim lights at glory’s sun decay.

WHEN morning from the (lamps of night

Beams o’er the eye in rosy light

And calls thee forth with smile benign ;

Ah think ! whose heart responds to thine,

And still with sympathy divine,
Remember me.

When gentle twilight pure and calm,
Comes leaning on Reﬂection’s arm ;
When o’er the throng of cares and Woes,
Her veil of’ sober tint she throws,‘

Wooing the spirit to repose,

Remember me.

When the ﬁrst star, with cresset bright,

Gleams, lonely o’er the arch of night,

When through the ﬂeecy clouds that dance,

The moon sends forth her timid glance,

Then gazing on that pure expanse,
Remember me.

When mournful sighs the hollow Wind,

And pensive thought enwraps the mind,-

If e’er thy heart in sorrow’s tone,

To musing melancholy prone, '

Should sigh, because it feels alone,
Remember me.

While friendship’s heart the wish can frame,

This breathless, mouldering form is laid,
If near that bed thy step shouldrove,
With one short prayer, by feeling wove,
One glance of faith, one tear of love,

RECOLLECOTIONS OF AN .AGED PASTOR.

I no remember him. His saintly voice,
So duly lifted in the house of God,  
Comes with the far-off Wing of infant years,
Like solemn music.-
l Often have we hush’d

The shrillest echo of our holiday,
Turning our mirth to reverence as he past,
And eager to record one favouring smile,
Or word paternal.

At the bed of death
I do remember him; when one who bore
For me a tender love, did feel that pang

’Which makes the features rigid, and the eye

Like a ﬁx’d glassy orb. Herhead was white
With many Winters; but her furroW’d brow
To me was beautiful; for she had cheer’d

My lonely childhood, with a changeless stream
Of pure benevolence.

Girding her from the armoury of God,
To foil the terrors of that shadowy vale y
Through which she walk’d, doth linger round me still;
And by that gush of bitter tears, when grief

Gilding youth scenes, and promising to bring
The curtain’d morrow fairer than to-day,
Did kindle Wilder gayety than ﬁts

Over some shrouded sleeper, made a pause
In ‘folly’s song, or Warn’d her roving eye,
That all man’s glory was the ﬂower of grass,
Beneath the mower’s scythe.

His fourscore years
Sat lightly on him ; for his heart yyas glad,
Even to the latest pulse, with that fond love,
Home-nurtur’d, and reciprocal, which girds
And garners up in sorrow or in joy.

I was not with the weepers, when the hearse
Stood all expectant at his pleasant door,
And other voices from his pulpit said,

That he was not; but yet the requiem-sigh
Of that sad organ, in its sable robe,

Made melancholy music for my dreams.

——And so farewell, thou who didst shed the dew

Baptismal on mine infancy, and lead

Lift thou here thy fragrant head,
Bloom in this uncultur’d bed.

Whei'e the bones of men are laid ;
Short like yours, their transient date,
Keen has been the scythe of fate.

They came, upon the green earth's breast,
Sent forth their roots to reach the stream,
Their blossoms toward the rising beam,
They drank the morning’s balmy breath,
And sank at eve, in withering death.

Rest here, meek plants, for few intrude
To trouble this deep solitude ;

But should the giddy footstep tread
Upon the ashes of the dead,

Still let the hand of rashness spare
These tokens of aﬁ"ection’s care,

Nor pluck the tender leaves that wave,
In sweetness o’er this saluted grave.

White were the locks that thinly shed
Their snows around her honour’d head,
And furrows not to be eﬂ'ac’d,

Had age amid her features trac’d,
Before my earliest strength I tried

In infant gambols by her side ;

But yet no grace or beauty rare,

Were ever to my eye so fair.

Seven times the sun, with swift career,
Has mark’d the circle of the year,

Since ﬁrst she press’d her lowly bier;

And seven times, sorrowing, have I come
Alone and wandering through the gloom,
To pour my lays upon her tomb:

And I have mourn’d, to see‘ her bed

With brambles and with thorns o’erspread.

Ah, surely, round her place of rest

I should not let the coarse weed twine,
Who so the couch of pain hath blest,
The path of penury freely drest,

And scatter’d such perfumes on mine:
It is not meet, that she should be I
Forgotten or unblest by me.

ness of right conduct, she was often disgraced
and unhappy.

VVhen she grew up, she carried these careless
habits into her housekeeping. Though she had
a kind heart, there were disorder and discomfort
in her family. Nothing was in its right place.
Her work was done by the hardest, for want of
the proper materials.

She was always in a hurry. This is an evil
which comes upon those, who have not the spirit
of order. Her countenance which used to be

‘pleasant, soon wore a troubled and bewildered

expression. Wrinkles came over her forehead,
before it was time to be old.

Though she was naturally amiable, this sad
fault spoiled her temper. Her children imitated
her, and kept none of their things in the right
place. One would be heard complaining that a
hat or cloak could not be found, and another he-
wailing a lost doll, or broken play-things.

The mother fretted loudly at her little ones,
for faults that grew out of her own want of order.
She had a cousin, whose name was Mary.
They lived near each other, and were of the
same age. When they were young, they often
played together, and sat on the same bench at

List at the hour of prayer, can ye not hear my lay ?
Untaught, unchecked it came,
A.s light from chaos bea1n’d,
Praising His everlasting name,
Whose blood from Calvary stream’d,
And still it swells that highest strain, the song of the

Brother !—-my only one,
Belov’d from childhood’s hours,
With whom, beneath the vernal sun,
I wandered when our task was done,
And gathered early ﬂowers;
I cannot come to thee,
Though ’twas so sweet to rest,
Upon thy gently-guiding arm--«thy sympathizing
breast:
’Tis better here to be.

No disappointments shroud
The angel-bowers of joy,
Our knowledge hath no cloud,

Our pleasures no alloy.

The fearfulrword---to part,
Is never breathed above;

Heaven hath no broken heart-—
Call me not hence, my love.

Oh mother! He is here

To Whom my soul so grew,
That when Death’s fatal spear
Stretch’d him upon his bier

I fain must follow too.

His smile my infant grief restrain"d—-—
His image in my childish dream
And o’er my young affections reign’d
With gratitude unuttered, and supreme.
But yet till these refulgent skies burst forth in radiant
glow,
I knew not half the unmeasured debt a daughter’s
heart doth owe.

Ask ye, if still his heart retains its ardent glow’!
Ask ye, if ﬁlial love
Unbodied spirits prove '!
’Tis but a little space, and thou shalt rise to know.

I bend to soothe thy woes,
How near—-thou canst not see;
I Watch thy lone repose,
Alice doth comfort thee ;
To Welcome thee, I wait-—-blest mother! come to me.

and scissors to the work-basket. Her knitting
was neatly rolled, and replaced in its bag.

Her garments were folded, and laid in the
drawers and trunks where they belonged. Her
bonnet was hung in the spot allotted to it, as soon
as she entered the house, and her school-books
laid on that part of the shelf, which she Was per-
mitted to call her own.

At school, her pens and ink were in good order,
and she never blotted her paper, or her desk.
She had no need to borrow, and if it had been
dark, she could have laid her hand upon all her
things,—-for she remembered their places, and
knew that they were there.

She had fewer things than her cousin Martha,
because her parents were not so rich. But she
had morethat were ready for use. Her clothes
lasted longer, and looked more neatly. For she
had been taught to mend them, the moment that
they needed it, and to fold each garment when
she took it off at night.

When she had a house of her own, every arti-
cle in it had a place, and all who used it, were
required to put it there. One of her ﬁrst rules to
her children when very young-—was, “a place
for every thing; and every thing in its place.”
And she obliged them to obey this rule. So her
family were in order, and their daily labour went
on like clock-work.

Her countenance was pleasant and peaceful,

LOUISA.

SHE was my idol. Night and day, to scan
The ﬁne expansion of her form, and mark
The unfolding mind, like vernal rose-bud, start
To sudden beauty, was my chief delight.

To ﬁnd her fairy footsteps following mine,
Her hand upon my garments, or her lip

Long seal’d to mine, and in the Watch of night
The quiet breath of innocence to feel

Soft on my cheek, was such afull content

Of happiness, as none but mothers know.

Her voice was like some tiny harp, that yields
To the slight-ﬁnger’d breeze, and as it held
Gay converse with her doll, or gently s0oth’d
The moaning kitten, or with patient care
Conn’d o’er the alphabet———but most of all,
Its tender cadence in her evening prayer,
Thrill’d on the ear like some ethereal tone
Heardin sweet dreams.

But now alone I sit,
Musing of her, and dew with mournful tears
Her little robes, that once with curious pride
I wrought, as though there Were‘ a need to deck
A form that God had made so beautiful.-

Sometimes I start, fancying her empty crib,
Gives forth a restless sound, and softly say,

“ Hush, hush, Louisa, dearest !”—then I Weep,
As if it were a sin to speak to one

Whose home is with the angels.

Gone to God! ,

And yet I Wish I had not seen the pang

That wrung her features, nor the ghastly White
Settling around her lips. I would that Heaven
Had taken its own, like some transplanted ﬂower
Blooming in all its freshness.

Gone to God !
Be still, my heart ! what could a mother’s prayer
In all the wildest ecstasy of hope, I
Ask for its darling, like the bliss of heaven?

CHILD IN SEARCH OF HER FATHER.

They say I was but four years old,
When Father went away,

Yet I have never seen his face,
Since that sad, parting day.

He went, where brighter ﬂowrets grow,
Beneath Virginian skies,

Dear Teacher, show me on your map
Where that far country lies.

I begg’d him, ‘ Father do not go!
For since my mother died

I love no one as well as you :‘
And clinging to his side,

The tears came gushing down my cheeks
Until my eyes were dim;

Some, were in sorrow for the dead,
And some in love for him.

He knelt, and pray"d of God above,
‘ My little daughter spare,

And till We both shall meet again,
Oh keep her in thy care.’

He does not come !—-—I watch for him,
At evening twilight grey,

Till every shadow Wears his shape,
Along the grassy way.

I muse, and listen all alone,
When stormy Winds are high,

And think I hear his tender tone,
And call, but no reply;

And so I’ve done these four long years,
Within a lonely home,

Yet every dream of hope is vain--
Why don’t my father come 2--

Father,-—-dear father, are you sick
Upon a stranger shore 1-

Grandmother says it must be so,—-
O write to us once more,

And let your little daughter come,
To smooth your restless bed,

And hold the cordial to your lips,
And press your aching head.

Alas !———I fear me he is dead.-—
Who will my trouble share’!
Or tell me where his form is laid,

And let me travel there’!

“The only daughter of an Indian woman, in Wisconsin territo-

of her own race, and a few of the whites, were at the grave; but
none wept, save the poor mother.”

A cry, of woman’s wo,——

All ﬁtfully and low.

It is a mother’s Wailing !-
Hath earth another tone,

Like that with which a mother mourns,
Her lost, her only one C’-

Pale faces gather round her,—-
They'mark the storm swell high,
That rends and Wrecks the tossing soul,
But their cold, blue eyes were dry.
Pale faces gazed upon her,
As the wild winds caught her moan,-—
But she was an Indian mother,—-
So, she wept those tears alone.

Though every dreary dawn reveal’d
Some ravage Death had made :

Till the ﬂeshless sinews started,
And hope no opiate gave,

And hoarse and hollow grew her voice,
An echo from the grave.

She was a gentle creature,
Of raven eye and tress,

And dovelike were the tones that breatl1’d
Her bosom’s tenderness ;-

Save when some quick emotion
The warm blood strongly sent

To revel in her olive cheek,
So richly eloquent.

I said Consumption smote her,
And the healer’s art was vain ;
But she was an Indian maiden,
So none deplor’d her pain ;--
None, save that widow’d mother,
VVho now, by her open tomb,
Is writhing like the smitten wretch
Whom judgment marks for doom.

Alas ! that lowly cabin,
That couch beside the wall,

That seat beneath the mantling vine,
They’re lone and empty all:

What hand shall pluck the tall, green corn,
That ripeneth on the plain,

Since she, for whom the board was spread,
Must ne’er return again?

Rest, rest, thou Indian maiden !-—
Nor let thy murmuring shade

Grieve that those pale-bro'w’d ones with scorn
Thy burial-rite survey’d ;—

There’s many a king, Whose funeral
A black-rob’d realm shall see,

~For whom no tear of grief is shed,

Like that which falls for thee.

Yes, rest thee, forest-maiden!
Beneath thy native tree ;

The proud may boast their little day,
Then sink to dust like thee ;

But there’s many a one whose funeral
VVith nodding plumes may be,

Whom Nature nor Affection mourn,
As now they mourn for thee.

SEE how the year in changeful garb appears,——-

First, in its cloudy mantle, moist with showers,
Most like a timid child, ’mid smiles and tears ;

Next, as a blooming maiden crowned with ﬂowers;
Then like a matron lulling infant hours

To gentle sleep, with soft, melodious chime;
Then Weak and hoary, with enfeebled powers,

And bent beneath the wintry hand of‘ time ;
And last, with magic strange, renews her early prime.

But still, where’er the varying seasons tread,
\Vhether with song of vernal birds they rove,
Or freshly deck the hillock’s grassy head,
Or in the reaper’s dance rejoicing move,
Or strew with falling leaves the solemn grove;
Still to the thoughtful eye their change is fair,
And still they claim the grateful lay of love
From the meek soul, that feels its maker’s care,
Beholds him in his works, and joys to praise him
there.

Thou art in every place, Being Supreme !—-
Best seen and worshipp’d in thy court above ;

Yet here, on earth, thy countenance doth beam
With rays of terror, majesty, and love,

And joys unspeakable thy smile doth move ;

Escape thy hand, or from thy presence rove,

Or hide in secret cells, close wrapp’d in night,—-
For unto thee, thedarkness shineth as the light.

Thou dvvellest where the curtain’d whirlwinds hide,

Where the arm’d thunder walks its awful round,
Thou on the tempest of the night dost ride,

Flames mark thy path, and clouds thy car surround,
And winds are rais’d, and mighty billows sound,

While from thine eye the winged lightnings part;
Thou in the highest arch of heaven art found,

In the dark regions of the earth thou art,
And in the humble cell of the repentant‘ heart.

If e’er the storms of life, with fearful rage,
Upon my lone, unshelter’d head should blow,
Or trembling down the slippery steep of age,
My Weak and unsupported footsteps go,
My locks all white with Weariness and W0,

Still let my bosom at thy presence glow,
Still let my trusting prayer to thee ascend,
And ever to my Wants thy kind compassions lend.

like one who does right. And though she was
not as handsome as Martha, it was more agree-
able to look at her, because she was never in a
hurry.

Her quietness of mind seemed to proceed from
a sense of justice, or of doing her duty even to
inanimate things: for we owe a duty to every
article in our possession, and to every utensil
with which ‘We work; the duty of keeping them
in order, and a good condition.

Sometimes, when I have called on these cous-
ins, and found one fretting and bustling about,
and the other placid and happy in her industry,
it has reminded me of a picture, that I once saw
when I was a child.

It was called the picture of the sisters ofBeth-
any. You will remember that their names were
the same as those ofthe two cousins, Martha and
Mary. One, with a complaining, care-worn face,
seemed indeed “ cumbered with much serving ;”

the other wore that sweet, peaceful smile, which

said plainer than words, that she had chosen the
“ good part.”

And in visiting many families, both in the city
and country, I have observed that order and in-
dustry, were the two hands, by which a house-
keeper takes hold of her work, and makes the
members of her household comfortable.

THE VILLAGE.

THE farmer, ﬁll’d with honest pleasure, sees

His orchards blushing in the fervid breeze,

His hleating ﬂocks, the shearer’s care that need,
His Waving woods, the wintry hearth to feed,
His patient steers, that break the yielding soil,
His hardy sons, who share their father’s toil,
The ripening ﬁelds, for joyous harvest drest,
And the White spire that points a World of rest.

His thrifty mate, solicitous to bear

An equal burden in the yoke of care,

With vigorous arm, the ﬂying shuttle heaves,

Or from the press the golden cheese receives;

Her pastime, when the daily task is o’er,

With apron clean, to seek her neighbour"s door;
Partake the friendly feast, with social glow,
Exchange the news, or make the stocking grow,--~
Then hale and cheerful, to her home repair,
When Sol’s slant ray renews her evening care,

Press the. full udder for her children’s meal,

Rock the tir’d babe, and wake the tuneful wheel.

See,--toward yon dome Where village science dwells,

When the church-clock its warning summons swells,‘

What tiny feet the Well-known path explore,
And gaily gather from each rustic door.

Of prudent counsel and persuasive tongue;

Their well—braced nerves by early labour strong;
Inventive minds, a nation’s wealth that Wrought,

And white-haired sages, sold to studious thought;

In ancient days, you pure, cerulean wave;

Son of that Spirit, whom in storms he traced,
Through darkness followed, and in death embraced,
He sleeps an outlaw ’mid his forfeit land,

And grasps the arrow in his mouldered hand.

Here, too, our patriot sires with honour rest,

In Freedom’s cause who bared the valiant breast :-—-
Sprung from their half-drawn furrow, as the cry

Of threatened liberty Went thrilling by,

Looked to their God, and reared, in bulwark round,
Breasts free from guile, and hands With toil embrown’d.
And bade a monarch’s thousand banners yield--—
Firm at the plough, and glorious in the ﬁeld ;

Lo ! here they rest, who every danger braved,
Unmarked, untrophied, ’mid the soil they saved.

Round scenes like these, doth Warm remembrance

Where emigration rolls its ceaseless tide,

On western wilds, which thronging hordes explore,

Or ruder Erie’s serpent-haunted shore,

Or far Huron, by unshorn forests croWn’d,

Or red Missouri’s unfrequented bound.

The exile there, When midnight shades invade,
Couch’d in his hut, or camping on the glade,
Starts from his dream, to catch, in echoes clear,
The boatman’s song that charmed his boyish ear;
While the sad mother ’mid her children’s mirth,

Paints with fond tears, a parent’s distant hearth,

Of thee, blest village, and thy velvet Vales ;

The simple school, and Sabbath’s tuneful bell ;
And smiles to see the infant soul expand,

THE EMIGRAN'l"S DAUGHTER.

“ THE way is long,”——the father said,
While through the western wild he sped,
With eager searching eye:
“ Cheer ye, my babes,”—the mother cried,
And drew them closer to her side,
As f1'own’d the evening sky.

Just then, within the thicket rude,

A log rear’d cabin’s roof they view’d,
And its low shelter blest ;

On the rough ﬂoor their simple bed,

In haste and weariness, they spread,
And laid them down to rest.

On leathern hinge the doors were hung,
Undeck’d with glass the casement swung,
The smoke-wreath stain’d the wall;

Yet here they found their only home,
Who once had ru1’d the spacious dome,
And pac’d the pictur’d hall.

But hearts with pure affections warm,
Unmurmuring at the adverse storm,
Did in that cell abide;
And there the wife her husband cheer’d,
And there her little ones she rear’d,
And there in hope she died.

The lonely man still plough’d the soil,

Tho’ she, who long had sooth’d his toil,
No more partook his care,

But in her place a daughter rose,

As from some brokenrstem there grows
A blossom, fresh and fair.

"With tireless hand the board she spread,
The Holy Book at evening read,
And When, with serious air,
He saw her bend so sweetly mild
And lull to sleep the moaning child,
He blest her in his prayer.

But stern disease his footstep staid,
And down the Woodman’s axe he laid——
The fever-ﬂame was high;
No more the forest fear’d his stroke,
He fell, as falls the smitten oak,
The emigrant must die.

His youngest girl, his ondest pride,
His baby when the mother died,
How desolate she stands;

i While gazing on his death-struck eye

His kneeling sons with anguish cry,
And clasp his clenching hands.

Who hastes his throbbing head to hold’!
Who bows to chafe his temples cold’!
In beauty’s opening prime;
That blessed daughter, meek of heart,
Who, for his sake, a matron’s part
Had borne before her time.

Just in the bud of blushing womanhood

Reached the paternal threshold. Wrathful night
Muﬁled the timid stars, and rain-drops hung

Dry’d those damp tresses, and with warm caress
Sustain’d the weary spirit. No, ‘that hand

Toil’d for the fruits of knowledge, treasuring still

And the pure music of his welcome home,

Rich payment of her labours.

But there came
A summons of surprise, and on the wings
Of ﬁlial love she hasted.
—--’Twas too late :

The lamp of life still burn’d, yet ’twas too late.
The mind had passed away, and who could call
Its Wingifrom out the sky '9

,For the embrace
Of strong idolatry, was but the glare
Of a ﬁX’d, vacant eye. Disease had dealt

A fell assassin’s blow. Oh God! the blight

That fell on those fresh hopes, when all in vain
The passive hand was grasp’d, and the wide halls
Re-echoed “father! fatlzer!”

Through the shades

Of that long silent night, she sleepless bent,
Bathing with tireless hand, the unmoved brow,
And the death-pillow smoothing. When fair morn
Came with its rose-tint up, she shrieking clasp’d
Her hands in joy, for its reviving ray

Flush’d that worn brow, as if with one brief trace
Of waken’d intellect. ’Twas seeming all:

And Hope’s fond vision faded, as the day

Rode on in glory.

And found that pale and beautiful watcher there

Still unreposing. Restless on his couch

Toss’d the sick man. Cold Lethargy had steep’d
Its last dead poppy in his 11eart’s red stream,

And agony was stirring Nature up

To struggle with her foe.

“ Father in Heaven !

Oh, let him sleep E”--sigh’d an imploring voice ;
And then she ran to hush the measur’d tick

Of the dull night-clock, and to scare the owl

That clinging to the easement, hoarsely pour’d

A boding note. But soon from that lone couch,
Thick-coming groans announce the foe that strikes
But once.

They bare the fainting girl away;

And paler than that ashen corse, her face,

Half by a ﬂood of ebon tresses hid,

Droop’d o’er her nurse’s shoulder. It was sad

To see a young heart breaking, while the old

Sank down to rest.

There was another change,
The mournful bell toll’d out the funeral hour,
And groups came gathering to the gate Where stood
The sable hearse. Friends throng’d With heavy heart,
And curious villagers, intent to scan
The lordly mansion, and cold Worldly men,
Even o’er the coﬁin, and the Warning shroud
Revolving selﬁsh schemes.

But one was there,  
To whom all earth could render nothing back,
Like that pale piece of clay. Calmly she stood,

THE CHILDREN’S FIRST WALK TOGETHER.

THEY passed together, out of their father’s
gate, a little girl and boy. Their quick. steps

were short and unequal, as if they had trodden

only on the nursery-carpet, or the smooth gravel
walk of the garden.

They took their way along the village street.
It was bordered with fresh grass. They were
pleased that it swelled into little mounds and
again descended,--—and they thought every hil-
lock was a mountain.

They admired the daisies, and king—cups,-—-
and when a robin ﬂew by, they said,———“Bird,
are these your ﬂowers!--may we pick some of
them P” Then they discovered a small brook,
that went gurgling along, and stood wondering
upon its pleasant banks.

The sister’s arm was over the neck of her
brother. She was the eldest one. And tender-
ly she watched over .him. If the swift wheel
rushed by, or the wide-horn’d ox seemed to press
too near, or the dog with open mouth paused as
if regarding him, the same motherly care sat
upon her sweet brow, as will hereafter take root

270 THE omL’s READING-BOOK.

As marble statue. Not one trickling tear,

Or quivering of the eye-lid, told she liv’d,

Or tasted sorrow. The old house-dog came,
Pressing his rough head to her snowy palm,
All unreprov’d.

He for his master mourn’d.
And could she spurn that faithful friend, who oft
His shaggy length thro’ many a ﬁreside hour
Stretch’d at her father’s feet? who round his bed
Of sickness watch’d with Wakeful, Wondering eye
Of changeless sympathy? No, round his neck
Her infant arms had olasp’d, and still he rais’d
His noble front beside her, proud to guard
The last, Iov’d relic of his master’s house.

The deadly calmness of that mourner’s brow,

Was a deep riddle to the lawless thought

Of whispering gossips. Of her sire they spake,

Who suﬂ'er’d not the Winds of heaven to touch

The tresses of his darling, and who dream’d

In the warm passion of his heart’s sole love

She was a mate for angels. Bold they gaz’d

Upon her tearless cheek, and murmuring said,

“ How strange that he should be so lightly mourn’d.”

Oh Woman I oft misconstrued I the pure pearls

Lie all too deep in thy heart’s secret well,

For the unpausing and impatient hand

To win them forth. In that meek maiden’s breast
Sorrow and loneliness sank darkly down,

Though the blanch’d lip breath’d out no boisterous

plaint
Of common grief.

Still at her side, the image of her sire,

Met her’s, and knew her not.

So close with strong embrace compeI1’d,

That strikes thy clasping nerves from me?

The same encircling vestment Wore,

To Him I look, to Him I bend,

To Him thy shuddering frame commend.

If I have ever caused thee pain,

The throbbing breast, the burning brain,
With cares and vigils turn’d thee pale,
And scorn’d thee when thy strength did fail,
Forgive! Forgive! thy task doth cease",

Or triﬂing stay mine upward course,

Or lure from Heaven my wavering trust,
Or how my drooping Wing to dust,-—

The vase of earth, the trembling clod,
Constrain’d to hold the breath of God.

Thy feet upon my errands run ;—

Go to thy rest. A quiet bed

Meek mother Earth, with ﬂowers shall spread,
Where I no more thy sleep can break
With fever’d dream, nor rudely wake
Thy wearied eye.

Oh quit thy hold,

For thou art faint, and chill, and cold,
And long thy grasp and groan of pain,
Have bound me pitying in thy chain,
Tho’ angels urge me hence to soar,
VVhere I shall share thine ills no more.

Yet we shall meet. To soothe thy pain,
Remember, we shall meet again;

Quell with this hope the victor’s sting,
And keep it as a signet-ring,

When the dire worm shall pierce thy breast,
And nought but ashes mark thy rest,

When stars shall fall, and skies grow dark,
And proud suns quench their glow-worm spark,
Keep thou that hope, to light thy gloom,
Till the last trumpet rends the tomb.

thoughts and principles will become incorporated, with the

thoughts and feelings of the age. It is a work for the millions. ,

Every young lady should read it, and every school that does not
procure it, suffers daily in interest and in usefulness.’-’

From the “ New York Evangelz'st.”i

The“ Girl's Reading Book,” is decidedly a good book, and we
take pleasure in recommending it for extensive use. Its senti-
ments are evangelical, its themes are calculated to interest and
purify the mind, and its style is chaste andattractive. A number

of poetic effusions accompany it, some selected from the former‘

works of the author, and some original and new. The friends of
American literature, morals and religion, are under deep obliga-
tions to Mrs. Sigourney, for the character with which she has in-
vested her writings. We would feel an unwanted assurance, in
commending this book, even if we had not- examined it, such is’
our estimate of the salutary tendency of her publications. We
hope this volume will be extensively circulated, not only for the
good it may do, but that the author may be encouraged in future
labours.” 3'

Efrem the “ New York Commercial Advertiser.”

“ Here is exactly such a book as was needed for such a purpose,

what is wanted, and how to address herself to those, for whom the
work is intended. It contains thirty reading lessons in prose, and
the same number in poetry; some of which are as bright ﬂowers,
as the authoress has ever yet culled from the muses’ bower.
Like Dr. Watts, Mrs. Sigourney has great powers of adaptation,
composing a lofty lyric, or a chapter of mental philosophy, in one
hour, and a cradle hymn in the next. The essays in this work,
we conceive to be most happily adapted to the objects in view.
Some of them, are lessons of moral instruction ;—some of them,
inculcating household duties ;—-some of them, the improvement of
personal habits, as well as of the mind:-—some of them afford
pleasing illustrations ofsocial, parental, and family duties, and all
are pointed by a moral, and adorned by simplicity of language,
and purity of style. and sentiment. Duties to the poor ‘and sick,
and of obedience, are inculcated,——the advantages of perseverance
illustrated ;—-and whata beautiful family scene is opened to the
reader, in commendation of female energy’! Excellent lessons,
are also drawn from the gardens and the ﬁelds ; and the whole is

enriched by several attractive articles of female biography. We p

are glad to ﬁnd, that amid her multifarious contributions for the
periodical press, Mrs. Sigourney has not forgotten the more cer-
tain path to permanent usefulness and enduring fame.”

From the“ Newark Daily Advertiser.”
Mrs. Sigourney’s Girl's Reading Book, passed through a sec-

ond edition, in three weeks from its ﬁrst publication. No woman

amongst us is better qualiﬁed to make reading books for the young
of her sex than Mrs. Sigourney; and we could wish that the suc-
cess of this, her last essay in this department, might lead to the
special dedication of herself to the work. There is something
eminently healthy in all her emotions: her heart is in the right
place, and throbs to true impulses. There is apt to be a tone of
exaggeration in the writings of her sex--an unnatural, romantic,
and melancholy vein, a disposition to dwell too much upon the
shadows in the picture of life, and a passionate longing for scenes
more beautiful, hearts more true, and souls more congenialthan
the world affords.

But we recognize nothing extravagant, or affected in Mrs.
Sigourney. She looks upon men and things as they are-—with
the discerning eye of a practiced observer: and her writings are
at once natural and graceful—-instinct with a deep, hearty, and
genuine feeling. It is gratifying to meet with a. poet and awoman
whom fancy and sensibility have never beguiled; and who knows
precisely what are the substantial, serviceable traits of character,
and what are the showy ones—who is the slave of . no delusions,
and neither exaggerates the good not .the.evil of life.

there, when she rocks the cradle of her own
babe. '

The bold, beautiful boy was glad to be free.
He often "looked back, till he saw that neither
nurse or servant followed. Then he tossed his
white arms high over his head, and shouted out
his ﬁrst joy of liberty.

But there was an eye that followed them. It
never lost sight of them a moment, until they
seemed but as specks, far away, among the green
trees.

It was the eye of a mother, and in her heart
she said, “ can any evil come to those so fair and
innocent? Will not their very purity be their
protection? Surely, angels will ‘ hear them up
in their hands, lest they dash their foot against a
stone.’ ” d

Then she mused further, and continued speak-
ing, though none were near to answer. “Not
long, not long, can ye travel thus together,--so
lovely, so unharmed. There are snares and
thorns for every pilgrim, in the path of life.

“Neither may ye walk thus, side by side,---
loving as with one heart. Yemust be divided.
Who can tell your different paths P None, save
He to whom the mother ever lifteth her heart.

“ But at one point ye will arrive. At the
lonely tomb. There ‘Will ye lie down, and rise
up no more. Whether on the wide Waters, or
the far western prairies, where the bear, and the

hunter, and the fur-trader dwell ; or beneath
Indian skies, where the gold ripens; or amid the
rude northern seas, where the harpooner pierces
the whale ;—-to one place ye must come—to the
grave, your last bed.

“Little daughter, what shall be thy lot ? To
love, and to bear life’s burdens, with a troubled,
yet faithful spirit? Methinks I see thee nursing
thine own infant, as I have nursed thee, stooping
down to catch its fervent breath, as I have
watched sleepless by thy side, when sickness
came.

“Wilt thou sit at last, with thy thin, white
locks, teaching lessons of wisdom to thy children’s
children P Wilt thou mt thy dim eye to heaven,
and charge them to seek Him early, who giveth
strength when ﬂesh and heart fail, and when the
tottering feet enter the dark valley of the shadow
of death 5’

“ Or art thou to be cut down in thy blossom,
in the faint green of thine unfolding leaves?
Shall thy mother lay thee in thy last cold bed,
and come nightly to weep there ? Shall the
hands that cherished thee in the cradle, plant a
young white rose on thy turf pillow, an emblem
of thy simple innocence 3 Who can tell?”

The mother looked upward and said, “ Thou,
God, knowest.” And when she had prayed,
there came a trusting smile over her counten-

ance, which seemed to say that her dear ones,

were his, and that he’ loved them, and would do
no wrong to them, or to her.

Then she heard the sweet Voices of her chil-
dren returning, like the chirping of young birds,
who have newly ventured from their nest. And
she went forth to welcome them, and kissed their
bright,ruddy- cheeks, rejoicing in them, and in
Him who gave them.

THE BOY AND HIS GARDEN.

A CHILD held in his hand a slight, leaﬂess
shoot. It was like a supple, green Wand. Yet
it had been newly cut from the parent tree, and
life was secretly stirring in its little heart.

. He sought out a sheltered spot in the piece of
ground that he called his own. He planted it
there in the moist earth. He came often to visit
it, and when the rains of summer were withheld,
he watered it at the cool hour of sunset.

The sap, which is the , blood of plants, began
to circulate through its tender vessels. A tiny
root, like a thread, crept downwards. Soon,
around the head, there burst forth a garland of
pale, green leaves. a

Seasons passed overtit, and it became a small
tree. As fast as its branches came forth, they
drooped downwards to the earth. The cheering
sun smiled on them,——the happy birds sang to
them ; but they drooped still.

“ Tree, why art thou always sad and droop-
ing? Am I not kind unto thee? Do not the
showers visit thee, and sink deep. to refresh thy
root? T Hast thou a sorrow at thy heart?” But

32 THE G1RL’s READING-BOOK.

it answered not. And as it grew on, it drooped
lower and lower. For it was a weeping willow.

The boy cast a seed into his soft garden
mould. When the time of ﬂowers came, a
strong budding stalk stood there, with coarse,
serrated leaves. Soon there came forth a full,
red poppy, glorying in its gaudy dress.

At its feet grew a purple lviolet, whichno hand
had planted or cherished. Itrlived lovingly with
the wild mosses, and the frail ﬂowers of the
grass, not counting itself more excellent than
they.

“ Large poppy, why dost thou spread out thy
scarlet robe so widely, and drink up the sun-
beams from my lonely violet ?” But the ﬂaunt-
ing ﬂower replied not to him who planted it.

It unfolded its rich silk mantle still more
broadly, as though it would fain have stiﬂed its
humbler neighbour. Yet nothing hindered the
fragrance of themeek violet, nursing its infant
buds.

The little child was troubled, and at the hour
of sleep he told his mother of the tree that con-
tinually wept, and of the plant that overshadowed
its neighbour. She took him on her knee, and
spoke so tenderly in his ear, that he remembered
her words when he became a man.

“ There are some who, like thy willow, are
weepers all their lives long, though they dwell in
pleasant places, and the fair skies shine upon

THE GInL’s READING-BOOK. 33

them. And there are others, who, like the
poppy that thou didst reprove, are haughty in
heart, and despise the humble, whom God re-
gardeth.

“Be thou not like them, my gentle child.
But keep rather in thy heart. the sweet spirit of
the lowly violet, that thou mayest come at last to
that blessed place which pride cannot enter, and
where weeping is never known.”

THE SUMMER SUN.

THE eastern sky is rich with prevailing light.
What a beautiful saffron colour marks the hori-
zon. Now, it spreads more widelyparound. In
one spot there is peculiar brightness. A few
rays shoot up, as heralds of some distinguished
guest. Then the glorious sun appears, the eye
of the world. i

It is not to our earth alone, that he dispenses
light and heat. Other planets rejoice in his
brightness. Moving around these, are still smaller
bodies, like children with their parents. The
sun has a large and beautiful family. Is he not
like a patriarch with his eleven children, and his
eighteen grandchildren P

He sits on the chief seat among them, cheer-
ing them with his gifts. Do you know some
bountiful person making the hearts of others
glad? Have you a benevolent friend whose
warm smile makes you happy? They may be
compared to the sun “rejoicing in the east.”
Let them also remind you of Him who made the
sun, in “whom the outgoings of the morning
and of the evening rejoice .9”

Hark,the birds sing. Some soar high with
a graceful movement, into the clear, blue sky.
The ﬂowers, sparkling with dew, lift their
bright eyes to their Benefactor. A fresh and
grateful odour goes up from the green forests.
Every plant and leaf seems to partake of a new

There was a statue in ancient Egypt, called.

the statue of Memnon, which was said at sunrise
to utter an articulate sound. So ought the most
silent and cold heart, to speak forth praiseifor
the gift of every pleasant morning.

Turn to your Protector in heaven, who has
given you the repose of sleep. Kneel and thank
him for his care. Many through this day will
suffer pain and sickness. Ask him to keep you
in health and usefulness. Many will weep over
dying friends. Ask him to hold in life those
whom you love.  

Some, ere the setting ofthis sun, will fall into
temptation. Ask him to preserve you in the
path of duty and of peace. Some will be taken
out of the world. Should you be of that number,
ask him to make‘you ﬁt to enter heaven. He
alone is able to do these things for you. His
blessing is like ‘the sun, to the plants of virtue in
your soul. . ‘

up and meet him. Let your morning hours he

industriously spent. Dr. Franklin said, “ if you
lose an hour in the morning, you may run all day
and not overtake it.” How true it is! “Hours
have Wings,” said another wise man.

See, it is noon. The sun has reached the
meridian. The groups of children returning
from school feel the heat. The labouring ox is
permitted to rest awhile, as well as his master.
The horses in the stage-coach pant, and are glad
to draw near the tavern. The cows like to
stand in ‘the quiet stream. How refreshing are
the shady trees. What a comfort is the pure,
cool water. A

Now, the little Chinese child sleeps on the
breast of its mother. There are no men work-
ing in the rice plantations. The boats which are
used instead of houses, lie motionless on the
rivers, with their many twinkling lights. The
little nests utter no chirping sound. All is still.
For it is midnight in China, when it is noon-day
here.

The sun’s journey is half completed. Is your
own work for the day half finished, and Well
done? Look up to your Father in Heaven, for
continued aid. Good works must be “begun,
continued, and ended in him.” It is not enough
to ask his favour in the morning, and then forget
him through the day. “ Evening, and morning,
and at noon will I pray,” said David, the king
of Israel.

But the sun is at the west. He is about to
forsake us. What a glorious show of clouds,
purple and crimson and gold colour. They are
his parting tokens, to remember him by, till he
comes again. How they change, and mingle,
and kindle, and fade. Not the proudest monarch
goes to rest under such a brilliant canopy.

Twilight is a lovely season. It is a little
stopping place, between day and night. It is ‘<1
shady cell for thought to enter. It is the cleft
ofa rock, where we may hide from the company

of cares. A‘ Scotch writer says, it is the “ quiet,

time, when the shuttle stands still, before the
lamp is lighted.”

Now the last ray of light has faded. Sleep
begins to unfold her curtain. The birds go to
their chambers among the green boughs. They
close the wearied Wing, and their little ones
slumber beneath it. The domestic fowls pre-
pare for the coming night. The hen goes to its
perch in the barn, and the turkey mounts the
branches of the trees, rocking with every wind.

Soon it will be time for us to retire. The ac-
tive limb, and the thinking brain, need repose.
But we will not go to rest, till we have examined
our own conduct. We will talk with ourselves,
seriously and alone.

Where have we been this day? What have
we learned, that in the morning we knew not?

Who have shown us kindness? To whose com-

fort have we added? What have we spoken
that we ought not to have said? What have
we left undone, that we ought to have done?

We will not rest in our bed, till we have an-
swered these questions. We will not lie down,
like the burdened camel, with any Wrong thing
for which we have not asked forgiveness of God,
or with the memory of any mercye for which we
have neglected to thank him, lest our sleep
should not be sweet, nor our hearts healthful,
nor the next rising sun our friend.

THE EIDER-DUCK AND THE BIRD OF PARADISE.

THE Eider-Duck is a ﬁne bird. It is brown
or white, and sometimes of other colours. It
has a black crest on its head, like a little crown.
If it lives to be old, its bright plumage turns
gray.

It is found in countries near the poles. It does
not fear the cold, for it is covered with a soft,
warm down. He who gave fur to the bear, and
a coat of wool to the sheep, clothed this bird with
a downy robe, that it might resist the winter.

It is fond of its young, and takes kind careof
them. The mother-bird builds a good nest, and
lines it with the down from her own breast. She

plucks it off, and willingly bears the pain, that

her little ones may be warm and sheltered.
The eider-down is much valued. It is an ar-
ticle of commerce. It is used for the covering

A of beds, and to stuff cloaks and hoods, and to

trim other articles of clothincr.

People are so desirous to get it, that they
sometimes tear in pieces the nest which the poor
bird has lined for her young. This they call live
down, and prefer it to what they pluck from the

birds after their death. They also climb high
rocks,.to obtain their eggs for eating.

The eider-duck is found in great numbers,
amid the perpetual snow and ice of Greenland,
Iceland, and Norway. Sometimes they are seen
in the neighbourhood of our great lakes, and in
the northern parts of the United States.

A father was once walking with his little son.

He carried a gun upon his shoulder. Suddenly
he pointed it at something upon a rock above his
head. It was a «large bird who seemed hard at
work, spreading out her wings, and bowing down
her head, and leaping up.

“ Dear father; what is she doing ?” ‘f Tear-
ing the down from her breast, to make a soft
bed for her little ones.” “ Does it not give her
pain P’’ ‘‘ Yes, but she loves them better than
herself.”

The boy gazed earnestly at the eider-duck.
“ Father, how long is it since we moved into this
new, cold country?” “Two years, my son.”

“ I remember the ﬁrst winter that we came
here. My mother took us children to see the
only neighbour that wehad. It was a long way
to walk, and soon after we left, to return home,
it began to snow.

“The feet of the youngest girl tottered with
Weakness. So, my mother took her in her arms.
She toiled on with her through the storm, and
against the wind. She took the only shawl from

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 41

her shoulders and wrapped it around the child,
pressing her close to her bosom.

“Ah! how glad were we to see, at last, the
lonely light streaming from our own window. It
seemed like a star of heaven. When we got
home, the little one was warm, but our poor
mother was cold and faint and sick.

“ She had deprived herself of her own cover-
ing, that the child might he sheltered. And she
did notcomplain, because she loved the child.
Was not she a good mother?”

The father did not answer. And when the
son looked up, he saw that there was a tear in
his eye. “Is not the eider-duck a good mother?
See, she bares her own breast for her little ones.
Dear father, let her live.” So the father had
compassion on the mother—bird, and spared her
that she might take care of her young.

The Bird of Paradise differs from the cider-
duck,"by living only in warm climates. It is
never found many degrees from the equator.
Its plumage is exceedingly beautiful. The side
feathers of the wing ﬂoat out to a great length,
and are of various, brilliant colours.

They principally inhabit New Guinea, and the
Spice Islands. They pass and repass in ﬂocks
of thirty or forty, conducted by a leader. They
are very careful to consult the state of the wind",
andalway"s move against it, in order to preserve
their voluminous train of feathers in good order.

42 THE G1aL’s READING-BOOK.

Sometimes the wind suddenly changes. Then
their sweeping plumage becomes entangled, and
the pride of their glorious beauty is their over-
throw. They fall to the ground and are taken
by the natives, or into the water and are lost.

They are all distinguished by their splendid
attire. They differ from the eider—duck, as the
fashionable lady does from the domestic and de-
voted mother. It is only for ornament that they
are prized by the inhabitants of the east. The
nobles of Persia, Surat, and the East Indies, are
anxious to obtain them to Wear upon their
turbans.

There are twelve or ﬁfteen different species.
The most elegant of these, is called the Great
Bird of Paradise. It is of a cinnamon colour,
with a throat of golden yellow, and the body is
small. It measures two feet, from the bill, to the
extremity of its ﬂoating train.

The natives have a tradition that they dwelt
in the sky, and never touched the earth till their
last hour. Some travellers mention, that to
prevent the detection of this error, they are so
cruel as to cut ofl'their'f'eet ere they sell them.
It is this species of the bird of paradise which
has sometimes been called “ the footless fowl of
Indian fable.” 4

LESSONS IN THE FIELDS.

WHEN I was a child, I knew an old, gray
haired man. Years had brought him wisdom,
and he was kind as well as wise. So, I loved
him, and rejoiced when I saw him coming to-
wards me, leaning upon his staff.

Once, as he talked with me, he said, “ I know
a way to be happy. I learned it in the ﬁelds.”
Then I entreated him to teach it also to me.
But he answered, “Go forth into the ﬁelds,
among living things, and learn it there for thy-
self.”

I went forth, and looked attentively upon all
that moved around. But no voice spake, and no

eye regarded me. So, I returned to the aged

man, and when he asked what I saw in the ﬁelds,
I replied:

“ I saw the brook ﬂowing on among sweet
ﬂowers. It seemed to be singing a merry song.
I listened, but there were no words to the music.
The sparrow ﬂew by me with down in her beak,
wherewith to line her nest, and the red-breast

with a crumb she_ had gathered at the door, to
feed her chirping young.  

44 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

“ The ducklings swam beside their mother in
the clear stream. The hen drew her chickens
beneath her wings, and screamed at the soaring
hawk. The spider threw out threads like lines
of silver. She fastened them from spray to
spray, and ran lightly on the bridge made from
her own body. T

“ The snail put his horned head through the
door of his house of shell, and drew it suddenly
back. The ant carried in her pincers a grain of
corn, and the loaded bee hastened to her hive,
like a labourer to his cottage.

“ The dog came forth and guarded the young
lambs. They frisked fearlessly by the side of their
mothers, who with serious faces were cropping
the tender grass. All seemed full of happiness.

“I asked of them the way to happiness. ' But
they made no reply. Again and again I ex-

claimed, ‘ which of you will teach me the way

to be happy ?’ And only echo answered, repeat-
ing ‘/tappy, happy,’ but not telling‘ me how to
become so.”

“ Hast thou looked upon all these,” said the
aged man, “and yet received no instruction?
Did not the brook tell thee, it might not stay to
be idle, but must haste to meet the river, and
go with that to the ocean, to do the bidding of
ocean’s king?  

“ Did it not say to thee, that it found pleasure
by the way, in refreshing the trees that stretched

THE G1RL’s READING-BOOK. 45

their roots to meet it, and in giving drink to the
ﬂowers that bowed themselves down to its face,
with a kiss of gratitude ?

“ Thou didst see the birds building their nests
among the cool, green branches, or ﬂying with
food to nourish their unﬂedged young. And
couldst thou not perceive, that to make others
happy, is happiness 5’

“ The young duck gave diligence to learn of
its mother the true use of its oary feet, and how
to balance its body in the deep waters. The
chicken obeyed the warning to hide itself under
the sheltering wing, though it was ignorant of the
cruelty of the foe from which it ﬂed.

“ And did they not bid thee seek with the same
obedience the lessons of thy mother, who every
day teacheth thee, and every night lifteth up a
prayer that thy soul may escape the destroyer,
and live forever ?

“ The spider’s silken bower was swept away,
and she began another, without murmuring or
despondence. The snail willingly put forth all
her strength to bear her house upon her back ;
and the ant cheerfully toiled on with a load of
corn, to her winter store-house.

“Thou sawest that the bee wasted not the
smallest drop of sweetness that lingered in the
honey-cups, or among the bells of the ﬂowers.
And came there no voice to thee from all these

examples of patience, and prudence, and wisdom?
5

46 THE e1aL’s READIN(\i-BOOK.

“Thou didst admire the shepherd’s dog pro-—
tecting the helpless, and zealously doing the bid-
ding of his master. How couldst thou fail to
understand, that faithful continuance in duty is
happiness P ‘

“ From all these busy teachers came there no
precept unto thee ? When each gave thee les-
sons, wert thou deaf to their instruction? Did
not the ﬁelds lift up their hands, and tell thee
that industry was happiness, that idleness was an
offence both to Nature and to her God 3”

Then I bowed down my head upon my bosom,
and my cheek was crimson with shame. Be-
cause I had not understood the lessons of the
ﬁelds, and was ignorant of what even birds and
insects taught.

But the man with hoary hairs comforted me.
So, I thanked him for his tenderness and wis-
dom. And I took his precepts into my heart,
that I might weigh them, and, ﬁnd if they were
true. And though I was then young, and now
am old, I have never had reason to doubt that
these lessons of the ﬁelds were good, and that to
do the will of the Creator, is happiness.

EASY STUDIES.

I HEARD two girls, as they conversed. One
said, “I am sure I should not like to attend your
school. You have longer lessons than I choose
to learn. Besides, I think they give you too
hard studies. I always prefer easy studies, and
short lessons.”

Afterwards, as I reflected, I could not help
saying to myself,-—“ Now, I am afraid, that this
lover of short lessons, and easy studz'es,——if she
lives to grow up, and have the care of a family,
will choose only easy things, and become indolent,
and negligent in her duties.

“ I am afraid that when she is a woman, and
any difficult thing presses on her, as it surely
must, she will be discouraged, or perhaps una-
miable. For a love of ease leads to selﬁshness,
and selﬁshness to an unhappy disposition, and
wrong conduct.” i

I once heard an excellent old lady say to her
grand children, “ If you will do nothing but what
is easy, you will be neither a good mother, or a.
good housekeeper. Your children will be neg-
lected, and your house out of order. You will

complain of bad help, and no help, for the care
that is necessary to make domestics faithful at
their post, and contented to remain there, you
certainly will not be willing to take.

“ The little girl,” said she, “ who will not
learn to do this, or that, because it is hard, will
be apt to belong to that class, who do not like to
keep house, and must go to board, to live easy.
But in trying to escape what they call troubles,
they lose all those pleasures of home, which make
parents respectable, and children happy.”

The scholar, who loves only easy studies,
and short lessons, if she carries those habits of
mind into future life, will be in danger of be-
coming either a Vixen, or a drone. When cares
and crosses meet her, she will murmur under
their burden, or decline the labour that they
impose.

It is a loss to know how to do nothing but what
is easy. Strength of intellect is acquired by con-
quering hard studies, and strength of character
by overcoming obstacles. She who is not willing
to contend with diﬂiculties, is not ﬁtted for this
world. The Being who best knows for what end
we were placed here, has scattered in our path
something besides roses.

Especially is it a fault in our sex, to like only
easy things. Our business is to seek the happi-
ness of others, rather than our own. Selﬁshness,
in us, is sin ; for it Wars with the design of our

Creator. And none can oppose his will, and be
happy-

Avoid, therefore, the determination to choose
short lessons, and easy studies, lest the habits
thus cherished, should make you a self-indulgent
and helpless woman. Gird yourself up to the
race of life. Resolve that whatever your duty to
God and man requires, you will perform diligent-
ly and faithfully.

The females of ancient Rome had a power of
endurance, and a contempt of hardship, which
caused them to be respected, even in a rude age.
The daughters of our republic, ennobled as they
are by higher knowledge, and a purer faith,
ought surely not to be less energetic, or less dis-
interested. i

The increased advantages of education, now
enjoyed by the young, heighten the expectations
of their friends, and their responsibilities to God.

Their minds are no longer fettered, or held in,

darkness. Every talent finds ﬁtting employment
in the broad ﬁeld of christian duty and benevo-
lence.

Time was, when the temple of Science was
barred against the foot of woman. Heathen
tyranny held her in vassalage, and Mahometan

prejudice pronounced her without a soul. Now, .

from the sanctuary which knowledge and wisdom
have consecrated, and from whence she was so
long excluded, the interdict is taken away.

PREFACE.

To read Well is a high accomplishment. It is not
only graceful in a female, but its results rank among
the virtues. It enables her to impart both instruction
and pleasure. She may thus make the evening ﬁre-
side delightful, or the wintry storm pass unheard.
She may comfort the sick, and cheer the darkness of
the friend whose eye age has dimmed, and instil into
the unfolding mind lessons of Wisdom. But if she
reads ill, she does injustice to the author, to her hear-
ers, and to herself. a

Great attention should be devoted to the art of
reading, during the elementary part of education.
Wrong habits, then formed, are exceedingly diﬂicult
to correct. Rapid, confused elocution, false emphasis,
monotony at the close of sentences, or in the cadence
of poetry, if early indulged, ‘Will often be found adhe-
-sive through life.

Teachers can scarcely impress too deeply upon
their scholars, that the ﬁrst step towards good reading,
is to be understood. This probably requires more
time and care than to read gracefully. It is like _the
pedestal to the column, and must be safe and solid, or
the superstructure suffers. An audible tone, a clear
articulation, a correct pronunciation of every Word,
and a strict regard to established pauses, must be en-
forced, ere theipupil ascends to a higher gradation.

How will she receive the permission? How
will she prize the gift? Will she loiter at the
threshold of this magniﬁcent ‘temple? Will she
amuse herself in the outer courts, with those
brief and gaudy ﬂowers, which spring up where
is “ no deepness of earth?” Will she advance a
few steps, and boast of her own attainments, and
twine the garland of vanity around her brow,
and be satisﬁed with ignorance E’

Or will she press to the inmost shrine of the
temple of knowledge, among those patient and
zealous worshippers, whose “ candle goeth not
out by night?” Dear young friends, who are
favoured with the privileges of education, these
questions are for you.

On those of mature age, habit has fastened
her chains, and set a seal on character. With
you, it is the forming period, the time of hope.
Allurements to indolence, and vanity surround
you. Rise above them. Fix your standard
high. Take for your models the wisest and
best of your sex.

Be active, while the dews of the morning are
fresh around you. Soon, the sun will oppress
you with its noon-day heat. .It will ﬁnd you
toiling in steeper paths, and wearied beneath
heavier burdens. Then you will wish to be re-
freshed with the rich fruits of a reﬁned intellect.
May you not have to take up the lamentation,
“ mine own vineyard have I not kept.”

THE G1nL’s READING-BOOK. 51

The time must soon come, should your days
be prolonged, when you will be young no more.
Life will then be like a “ twice-told tale.” The
present will be disrobed of novelty, and the future
of its charm, and the mind will turn for solace to
the gatherings of the past. iFurnish now your
intellectual store-house for that day of need.

Be willing to labour for knowledge, to learn
long lessons, and to encounter diﬂicult studies.
Seek it with a tireless spirit, and so use it, that
all within the sphere of your inﬂuence may re-
joice in your mental and moral excellence, and
be quickened by your example to seek for “ glory,
honour, immortality, eternal life.”

OBEDIENCE.

NEXT to your duty to God, is your duty to
your parents. He has made them your guides,
because they are wiser than you, and love you
better than any other earthly friends. You can-

not always understand the reason of their com-T

mands. It is not necessary that you should. If
you live to be as old as they are, you will per»-
ceive that their restraints were for your good.
Think of the miseries of orphanage. The
greatest loss that can befal a child, is to be de-
prived of pious and affectionate parents. While
such blessings are continuedto you, never be so
ungrateful as to distress them by disobedience.
It is but a slight payment forall their watchings
over your infancy, their care for your comfort,
and patience with your errors, to do faithfully
and cheerfully the things that they desire.
When your parents are absent, observe their
commands with the same ﬁdelity as if they were
present. The child who obeys only when under
the eye of a superior, has not learned obedience.
He, who seeth at all times, and in every place, is
displeased with those who deceive their parents.

THE emL’s READING-BOOK. 53

He hath promised to reward those who “ honour
their father and their mother.”

The principle of obedience, is the principle of
order and happiness. If there were no subordi—
nation in families, what comfort would be found
there? If pupils refused to obey the directions
of their teachers, what beneﬁt could they receive
from their instructions? If in nations, the laws
were disregarded, what safety would there be for
the people 5’

Let the principle of obedience be rooted in
love. Take pleasure in obeying the commands
of your superiors. Even if you should have an
opposing wish, let there be no reluctance of
manner or countenance. I doubted the obedi-
ence of a child, whom" I once heard say to his
mother, “ I will go, when I have done one or
two little things.”

But when I heard afterward, the mother ask-
ing earnestly, “did you do as I bade you ?” I
knew that he was not an obedient child, though
Idid not hear his answer. For if obedience had
been habitual, his mother would not have felt it
necessary to inquire if he had regarded her com-
mands. She would not have feared that he had
neglected them, if his heart had been in his duty.

It is ill-treatment of our dearest friends, to
yield to their wishes with a frowning brow, or a
disagreeable deportment. Convince your parents
and instructors by your attention and alacrity,

54 THE; enufs READING-BOOK.

that you are thankful for the trouble they take, in
advising and directing you.

No greater evil could happen to the young,
than for older and wiser friends to withdraw their
control, and abandon them to their own inexpe-
rience. If your superiors gave you a piece of
gold, you would doubtless express your gratitude.
But when they impart to you of their wisdom,
they give you that which is of more value than
gold.  

When you are in school, feel it a privilege to
be there, and give your time and thought to the
employments which your teachers mark out for
you. Keep all their rules. Consider it dishon-
ourable to break them. Make the wishes of
your instructors your own, and then you will ac-
quire knowledge, with pleasure to yourself and to
them.

Treat old persons with respect. This is too
apt to be forgotten by the young, though the Bible
commands, “to rise up before the face of the old
man, and honour the hoary head.” We should
fear to be irreverent to those, whom the Almighty
has enjoined us to honour.

The natives of this country, were observed by
our ancestors to be exemplary in their treatment
of the aged. The young rose up and gave place
to them. They bowed down reverently before
them. They solicited their opinion, and listened
attentively till they had done speaking.

THE GmL’s READING-BOOK. 55

The young men of the forest stood silent in
their councils, when the gray-haired Chieftains
opened their lips. VVe should not be willing to
have the untutored Indian surpass us in aduty
so graceful.

You remember that when a hoary—headed man
once entered a thronged assembly in Athens, and
there was no seat, the young people were so rude
as to laugh at his embarrassment. But when he
was in a similar situation at Sparta, the young
arose and made room. “ The Athenians know
what is right,” said he, “ but the Spartans prac-
tise it.”

May it never be said of us, that we understand
our duties, but disregard the obligations they im-
pose. Whenever you meet an old person, re-
member the command of God, and treat him with
respect. Years have given him experience, and
experience is worthy of honour. VVithhold not
the reverence that is his due. “ The hoary head
is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of
righteousness.”

Shew respect to magistrates, and to all who
are in places of authority. There would be
fewer mutinies and revolutions, if children were
trained up in obedience. Distinguish yourselves
by submission and deference towards all whose
station or virtues claim them as their due. It
was said of Washington, by his mother, that
“his ﬁrst lesson was to obey.” Those best

56 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

know how to direct others, who have themselves

been taught subordination.

By faithfully discharging your ﬁrst and earliest
obligations, you will be prepared to act well your
part in future life. You will maintain good order
in your own families, and honour just govern-
ment in the land. And if you live to be old, and
have only a few gray hairs where your bright
locks now grow, you will deserve from the young
the same cheerful obedience and grateful respect
which you have yourself shown to your superiors.

THE GOOD DAUGHTER.

ELLEN’s mother died, when she Was scarcely
thirteen years old. Her only brother had died
the winter before. Her two sisters were marri-
ed, and had-removed to so great a distance, that
she seldom heard from them. She was quite
alone with her father.

When her mother ﬁrst died, she felt as if she
never could be happy again. But when she saw
her father looking so sad, she thought it was her
duty to try to comfort him ; and when he came
in, tired from his work, she would set a chair for
him, and get him whatever he wanted,‘ and speak
pleasantly to him, as her mother used to do.

She remembered how her mother made bread,
and was ambitious to make it in the same way.
She proportioned the articles just as she had seen
her do. When she kneaded the dough, she used
all the strength in her little arms. She took
great pains to have it light, and to bake it Well,
and when she placed on the table the ﬁrst loaf
that she had ever made, she could not help
weeping for joy, to hear her father say, “Child,
this tastes like your mother’s bread.”

She had often assisted in churning, but had
never taken the whole charge of making butter.
But she was anxious to try. She was careful to
keep her milk-pail, and pans, very clean and
sweet. In working over the new butter, she
patiently removed every drop of butter-milk, be-
cause she had heard her mother say that this was
necessary in order to have it good.

The neighbours were pleased with the industry
of the little girl, and encouraged her in her house-
keeping. She could not but miss her mother
sadly, and many times a day grieved for her loss.
But she went by herself to weep, for she said, “I
will not make my poor father more sad by my
sorrow. He has enough of his own to bear.”

When winter evenings came, she swept the
hearth neatly, and placed the light on the little
stand, and sat down by his side with her needle.
Her mother had thoroughly instructed her in
plain sewing, and while she mended or made
garments, her father read aloud to her. He
began to be comforted by the goodness of his
daughter, and she perceived that the tones of his
voice grew more cheerful in the evening prayer,
and when he bade her good-night.

Her father worked hard every day. She had

often heard her mother say that they were poor, H

and must economize. So as she grew older, she
studied how to save expense. She knew that
her mother made several very comfortable dishes

THE GIRL,S READING-BOOK. 

with but a little meat. So she learned to prepare
soup in the same way.

Also, by putting thin layers of meat, with a
little pepper and salt, and some broken pieces of
bread, in a small pot, with a plenty of vegetables
from their own garden, and covering them close
until all was thoroughly stewed, a very nourish-
ing dish was ready, When her father came home
to dinner.

They had near the door, a tree of nice, sweet
apples. Some of these she pared, and laid in a
deep pan, mingling them with a few sour apples
to produce a pleasant ﬂavour, and covered the
whole with a thick crust, which she broke after
it was baked, and plunged into the warm apple-
sauce. This made a kind of pie, of which her
father was fond.

He also liked puddings, and she learned to
make several cheap, and good ones. Among
them was one, she sometimes called the “ Satur-
day pudding,” because she baked it on Saturdays,
that they might have it for a Sunday dinner, cold
in the summer, and in the winter warmed on the
coals ; for they were not accustomed to cook on
that day, as they both felt it a privilege to go to
church. pp

She made this simple pudding, by picking over
and washing a gill of rice, to which she added a
spoonful or two of brown sugar, and after letting
it soak a while in three pints of milk, baked it.

6 PREFACE.

Would that I could arouse both teacher and scholar
to greater zeal and thoroughness in this branch of
education. I wish every young female in our land,
who enjoys the beneﬁt of scholastic training, might
persevere in the art of reading, until she is able to
convey» the delicate shades of thought, of the most
reﬁned Writer, clearly and agreeably to the mind of
another.

I have myself been a teacher. Some of the happi-
est years of my life were thus spent. Henceforth, all
teachers and all scholars are to me as friends. Espe-
cially am I interested in the young of my own sex.
For them this volume has been framed, on the princi-
ple of combining with the accomplishment of reading,
sentiments that are feminine in their character, and
knowledge that enters into the elements of woman’s
duty. May it be to them as the voice of a friend, and
continue to speak words of instruction and love, long
after the hand that prepared it shall moulder in the
grave. ' L. H. S.

She felt it a pleasure to learn every thing, how-
ever small, that would make her father comfort-
able ; and a duty to do it prudently.

Her mother had been accustomed to sell what
butter they could spare, to a lady in the neigh-
bourhood. Ellen continued to do so, and the
lady expressed herself much surprised that so
young a girl should make so ﬁne butter, and send
it in such neat order. If she ever felt fatigued
With her labours, she would recollect her mother’s
example, and always be pleasant and cheerful
when her father came home.

She had been early taught to knit and to spin,
and remembered to have heard her mother say,
that stockings made from wool which was carded
in the house, lasted much longer than that which
was prepared at the factories, because the ma-
chine cut the wool so ﬁne, as to impair ‘its
strength. She wished to avail herself of this
knowledge, but found she could not succeed in
preparing such smooth rolls as she had seen her
mother spin. ‘

So she took the wool to a neighbour, who was
experienced in such work, and offered if she
would teach her how to prepare it, to sew for her
until she was satisﬁed with the payment. . “ That
I Will, my good girl,” said she, “or anything
else you wish me to help you about, for we all
love you for taking such care of your father.
Your wrists are not strong enough yet to break

THE G1RL’s READING-‘BOOK. 61

and card this long wool, and I shall be glad to
have you make an apron for my baby.” i

After the rolls were made, she spun them into
very even yarn, and having heard her father say
that he thought stockings were warmer and set
closer for being seamed, she ﬁnished him two
pair of long ones for Winter, by knitting two
stitches plain, and seaming the third, and was
delighted to see how entirely they pleased him.

Having an active mind, she began to think of
some improvement in economy, and proposed
that he should purchase from a man for whom
he worked, a lamb or a sheep ; “ for it can get
its living with the cow,” said she, “and We can
use its wool for stockings, and then you will not
be obliged to buy.”

But, with all her prudence, she was not cove-
tous, and many a little pair of thick stockings did
she knit for poor children, and many a neatly

mended garment which she thought they could i

spare, did she carry to the sick; for economy
and generosity are often found together.

When Ellen grew to be a young woman, she
was a favourite with all. The old and thought-
ful respected her for her obedience and affection
to her only parent, who no longer felt lonely, so
comfortable and cheerful had she made his home.
She was also quite admired, for she had a good
person, a healthful complexion, and the open
smile of one who is in the habit of doing right,

and feels happy at heart, which is the truest
beauty.

When her young friends visited her, though
she was fond of society, she did not forget that
her ﬁrst duty was to her father. However agree-
able they were, as soon as the appointed time for
his family devotions came, she would say in the
gentlest manner, “ my father has been long used
to retire at nine.” And those who were the most
unwilling to leave her, could not but respect her
for attention to his wishes.

She was addressed by a deserving young man,
who had known her merits from childhood. To
his proposal she replied, “My father is growing
inﬁrm, and is able to work but little. I feel it
my duty to take care of him as long as he lives.
It might be a burden to others. It is a pleasure
to me.”

“Ellen, it will be no burden to me. Let me‘
help you in supporting him. Most gladly will I
work for all.” She saw that he was— sincere, and
they were married. Her husband had a small
house, and a piece of ground on which he labour-
ed. She kept every thing neat and in order,
and was always pleasant and cheerful. “I have
now two motives,” she said, “ to be as good as I
can,——a husband and a father.”

I Ellen’s little children loved their hoary grand-
father. She taught them by her own example
how to treat him with respect‘. The warmest

THE GmL’s READING-B0 01:. 63

corner was always for him. When they saw her
listening to all he said with reverence, they never
thought of interrupting him, or disregarding his
remarks. As he was deaf, she raised her voice
when she spoke to him, in a steady, affectionate
tone, and they learned to do the same.”

As they grew older, they read the Bible to him
daily, for his eyesight failed. His explanations
were a treasure to them. Especially was he
pleased when any of them learned to repeat by
heart, some of the Psalms of David. “ For
these,” he said, “have been my songs in the
house of my pilgrimage.”

Teachers, and others, who saw the children of
Ellen, observed that they had better manners
than others of the same age. They acquired
them, in a great measure, from their constant
propriety of deportment to their venerable grand-
father. To pay respect to age, is a beneﬁt both
to the inanners and character of children. It is
an advantage to them to live under the same roof
with a pious old person, provided they show them
that reverence which the Bible commands.

Ellen reaped a part of the reward of her ﬁlial
duty, in seeing her children made better, and her‘
father happy. In his last sickness all waited
upon him. When he was no longer able to raise
his head from the clean pillow where it was laid,
he thanked God who had put it into the heart of
his daughter to nourish him with a never-failing

64 THE G1nL’s READING-BOOK.

kindness, and he blessed her and her husband,
and their little ones.

Death came for him, and his eyes grew dim,
and they were no longer able to warm his feet
and hands. Ellen raised him up in his bed, and
sat behind him, and Wrapped her arms tenderly
around him, for she saw that he shivered. And
most touching was it to hear him say, as he lean-
ed his head upon her shoulder for the last time,
“The Lord bless thee and keep thee ; the Lord
make his face to shine upon thee ; the Lord lift
up the light of his countenance upon thee, and
give thee peace.”

THE SICK.

As sickness is at some time or other the lot
of all, it is well to learn, while young, how to
treat those who are sick, and how to conduct
when we are ourselves so. The care of the sick,
is peculiarly the business of our sex. Therefore,
even little girls should be trained to Wait upon
them, and to sympathize in their sufferings.

Sickness is an evil, not only because it brings
pain, but because it prevents us from being use-
ful. We should consider good health as a pre-
cious gift from our Heavenly Father, and avoid
any imprudence by which it is endangered. If
we are necessarily exposed to cold, we should
guard ourselves with thick clothing, especially
about the feet. Shun the folly of wearing thin
stockings in winter, or thin shoes when the
streets are wet.

Sickness, that comes through imprudence, is
attended with self-reproach. ,We have no right
to sport with our health.   This wonderful frame,
fashioned by an Almighty Hand, this temple of
the immortal spirit, was not intended for us to

66 THE G1RL’s READING-BOOK.

mar and deface, as fashion or folly dictate. We
should impart the earliest indications of ill-health
to those who have the care of us, as a slight
remedy taken in season, often prevents a formi-
dable complaint.

When you are seriously sick, give yourself up
entirely to those who have the care of you.
Take without objection whatever they bring you,
however unpleasant to the taste. Sickness is
not a time to gratify the palate, but to learn pa-
tience. Thank those who perform any service
for you, however small. Do not add to their
fatigue any more than you can help. If you see
them standing long by your bed, request them to
take a seat.

If you have watchers, urge them to take re-
freshment in the course ofthe night, and, if pos-
sible, to get some repose. These attentions are
pleasant to those who nurse you, and help to turn
your thoughts from self, for selﬁshness is too
prone to intrude into the chamber of sickness.
Consider your physician as your friend. Tell
him frankly all he asks, and submit to his reme-
dies without opposition.

Open your mind to cheering thoughts, and
keep your heart full of hope, for they promote
recovery. Spread your case before the Great
Physician, and ask his blessing on every remedy.
When you are well again, remember that you
are under a renewed weight of gratitude to Him,

THE G1RL’s READING-BOOK. 67

and to those who have “watched over you, and
shown you kindness ; and from your own suffer-
ings learn to pity others who suffer.

The ﬁrst thing to be considered in your treat-.-
ment of the sick, is to avoid whatever might dis-
turb them. This seems a slight attainment, and
yet is not always understood even by professed
nurses. A child should be taught to avoid loud
noises and laughter, heavy footsteps, and care-
less shuttingof doors, when any one is sick in
the house. And the more delicate attentions of
shadingthe light from the face, or the lamp from
the eye, and avoiding in the warming of drinks,
or the arrangement of the ﬁre, every sudden
and shrill sound, should be familiar to all in
attendance.

Move with the greatest quietness around the
chamber of the sick, and when you speak to
them, do so with a pleasant smile, and a soft,
low tone. When you carry any little delicacy to
an invalid, arrange it with perfect neatness, and
if you can, with taste. These little circumstan-
ces are observed by them, and have a cheering
effect. If you send them fruit, or sweetmeats,
dispose them so as to make an agreeable appear-
ance. If you lay a nosegay upon their pillow, let
it be fresh and beautiful; and so place every
ﬂower, that its form and colouring may be most
easily discerned.

68 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

Remember the sick poor. Learn to make
proper drinks or nourishing broths for them with
your own hands. Visit them, and ascertain if
their clothing and beds are comfortably provided,
and converse with your parents and older friends
respecting their Situation. Such habits are val-—
uable in the young, and should be cherished by
those who have the charge of their education, as
far as circumstances will admit.

I once knew a little girl, who, when her moth-
er had a headache, would glide around the house
like a shadow, with her ﬁnger on her lip, to re-
mind the other children to be silent. I have seen
her, when her aged grandmother could not sleep
for nervousness, pass within the curtains, and
press for a long time her temples with a soft,
gentle hand, and then breathe low in her ear the
simple tones of lulling music, till she was com-
posed to slumber. And I joyed to see in her
thus early, the elements of woman’s purer and
better nature.

. It is Well that kind sympathies should take
deep root in the heart of young females. For
our sex should ever bear about with them, a
nursing tenderness for all who suffer. In an-
cient times, ladies of high rank and wealth used
to go to hospitals and alms-houses to visit the
sick. Bending over their wretched beds, they
did not shrink to perform kind offices for the

THE GmL’s READING-BOOK. 69

most miserable. The “blessing of him who
was ready to perish, came upon them.” Let
none of us feel that We are too young to do
something for the comfort of the sick.

PROSE.

THE POOR.

THE sacred Scriptures say, “the poor we

have always with us.” It is the duty of the.

young, as well as of those who are grown up, to
study the best means of relieving them. The
kind feelings, the benevolent sympathies, that
are thus called forth, bless the giver as well as
the receiver. a

If you see a child in the winter, shivering and ‘

thinly clad, make some inquiry into his situation.
Perhaps you will ﬁnd that his parents are burden-
ed with too large a family to make all comforta-
ble, or that his mother is a widow, or that he is
an orphan. Then, if you can do any thing for
his relief, or excite others to do so, it will be the
means of increasing your own happiness.

It is a good plan to repair neatly your cast-off
garments, and now and then to knit a pair of

coarse stockings,’ and to lay aside a part of any i

money that may be given you, to be in readiness
for the claims of the poor. Never feel unwilling
to give whatever you can spare, but consider the
favour on your side, so great is the pleasure of
benevolence.

THE Gnu/s READING-BOOK. 71

The young should always solicit the advice of
their parents, or older friends, in their charities.
The judicious relief of the poor, requiresmore
knowledge of mankind, than those whose years
are few, can be expected to possess. Above all,
never boast of any thing you give. It is an
offence against the nature of true charity, which
“ vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up.”

Let me tell you of the girls of a school, who
piticd the poor, and formed themselves into a.
society for their relief. They had only Saturday

afternoon for recreation during the week, and r

they resolved to meet at that time, and devise
means how they might best be assisted. Their
parents gave permission, and their teacher allow-
ed them to meet in the°scho.ol-room.

Therel have often Seen them busy with their
needles, their bright eyes sparkling with happi-
ness, and their sweet voices consulting about
their plans " of charity, like a band, of sisters.
And I blessed them in my heart, and besought
that the spirit of grace and consolation might
ever dwell among them. For they were my
own scholars, and I loved them as children.

They were not soon weary in well-doing. Many
garments were repaired and made, many pair of
stockings knit, many books distributed among the
ignorant. They established a monthly contribu-
tion, an_d decided, that the money which they devo-
ted to it, should be the fruit of their own industry.

72 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

They employed themselves with their needles,
and received from the friends for whom they
worked, a regular price, which was sufficient for
their charities. That this new labour need not
interfere with their appointed lessons, or their
necessary recreations, they rose an hour earlier
in the morning, and thus secured time for all.

Their Society was regularly organized, and
among its oﬂicers were four almoners, Who, in
distributing their bounty, visited the houses of
the poor, and made report respecting them. An
interesting child, who was deaf and dumb, once
accompanied these almoners. In her strong lan-
guage of signs and gestures, she related what she
had seen in an abode of poverty.

“It was a small, low room,” said she. “ The
stairs were dark and broken. The snow through
which we had walked was deep, and my feet felt
very cold. But there was not ﬁre enough to
warm them. No. I could have held in one of
my hands those very few, faint coals. And there
was no wood.

“ The sick woman lay in a low bed. If she
sat up, she shivered, and she was covered with
scant and thin clothing. Her pale baby threw
up its arms and cried. But there was no physi~
cian there. Then the father came in, having in
hishand some pieces ofpine, which he had pick-
ed up. He laid them on the fire. But how
soon were they burned up and gone.

“ His wife spoke to him, and when he answer-
ed, she looked sorry. Because I was deaf and
dumb, I know not what they were saying. So, I
asked my friend. And she told me the poor
woman said to her husband, ‘have you bought a
piece of candle?’ When he answered ‘no, I
have no money,’ she said, with sadness, ‘must
We be in the dark, another long, cold night, with
our sick baby P’ ”

As the tender—hearted child went on to describe,
in her own peculiar dialect, the smiles that came
suddenly over the faces of the sorrowing poor, at
the unexpected bounty which she aided in bear-

ing, tears of exquisite feeling glistened in her
eyes; for her heart was awake to every gener-
ous sensibility, though her sealed lips were pre-
cluded from their utterance.

One of the best modes of assisting the poor,
is through their own industry. To give them
work, and pay them promptly and liberally, is far
better than to distribute alms, which may some-
times encourage idleness, or be perverted to vice.
It also saves that self-abasement which minds of
sensibility suffer, at receiving charity.

To remove ignorance, is an important branch
of benevolence. Study the art of explaining, in
simple and kind words, their duty to those who

fall into error for want of instruction. To dis-

tribute useful and pious books among those who

are able to read, is an excellent form of bounty.
They should be plainly written. A part of your
money for the poor, will be well devoted to their
purchase.

Read the books that you intend to distribute,
attentively, before you buy them. Be sure that
there is nothing in their contents, but what is in-
tended to beneﬁt the reader. Make a list of’
such books, with your opinion respecting them.
Mention why you think they will be useful, and
then you can give a reason for recommending
them to others, who may desire to instruct the
ignorant.

. The biographies ofthosie who have been dis-«
tinguished for usefulness or piety, are excellent
to awaken the spirit of imitation. If you are
not able to purchase many, get one, and let it be
easy of comprehension. If you are not able to
give it away, lend it, and when it is returned,
converse with the persons who have read it, and’
try to impress on their hearts the examples most
irvorthy of being imitated’.

Thus by the gift or the loan of books, you may
be scattering around you, the seeds of usefulness‘
and piety. You may do more lasting good, than
by the gift of clothing or money, which soon pass
away, and may be misused. When you relieve
the wants of the body, always remember the
soul. For how greatly will it add to your hap-

piness, when you grow up, to know that you have
enlightened the mind of but one child, and assist-
ed in making him wiser and better.

Do nothing charitable, from vanity, or a desire
of having your good deeds known and applauded.
Let your motives be, obedience to your Creator,
and love for those whom he has created. They
are all his family. He has breathed life into
their bosoms. He watches over them. He has
given them immortal souls.

Some have black or olive complexions, some
are red like the roving tribes of our forests, and
others white. But “ he hath made of one blood,
all who dwell upon the face of the whole earth.”
They inhabit different climes, but the same sun
gives them warmth, the same clouds send down
rain to refresh them.  

Some wrap themselves in furs, or dig subter-
ranean cells, to shelter themselves from the cold
of winter. Others, in slight garments of cotton
or silk, can scarcely endure the parching heat of
their long summers. Some feed upon the rich
fruits that a tropical sun ripens. Others hunt
the ﬂying animals through the forest for their
sustenance. H

press the liquor from the grape, some refresh
themselves at the fountains of pure water. Some

tossing, treacherous sea. Yet the same fatherly
hand provides for all. a

He who called all mankind forth from the dust
of the earth, views them as one large family,
seated at one common table, and soon to lie
down in one wide bed, the grave. We see, per-
haps, but one little corner of the table. We see
varieties of dress, complexion, and rank, and
suffer our feelings to be affected by these change-
ful circumstances.

We behold one exalted upon a high seat, and
we say, “he is more excellent than his neigh-
bour.” From those who hold the lowest places,
or “ gather up the crumbs under the table,” per-
haps, we turn away. Do we forget the great
Father of all, who appointed their stations P
who looketh only on the heart?

It must be pleasing to him who hath called
himself in his.Holy Scriptures a God of love, that
all his large family should regard each other as
brethren and sisters. Let us think of our fellow
creatures, as under the care of that Merciful
Parent from whom all our blessings proceed, and
let our good deeds to those who are less fortunate
than ourselves, have root in love.

EARLY RECOLLECTIONS.

THE years of my childhood past away in con-
tentment and peace. My lot was in humble and
simple industry. Yet my heart was full of glad-
ness, though I scarcely knew why. I loved to sit
under the shadow of the rugged rocks, and to
hear the murmured song of the falling brook.

I made to myself a companionship among the
things of nature, and was happy all the day.
But when evening darkened the landscape, I
sat down pensively. For I was alone, and
had neither brother or sister.

I was ever wishing for a brother who should
be older than myself, into whose hand I might
put my own, and say, “ Lead me forth to look at
the solemn stars, and tell me of their names.”
Sometimes, too, I wept in my bed, because there
was no‘ sister to lay her head upon the same
pillow.

At twilight, before the lamps were lighted,
there came up out of my bosom, what seemed to
be a friend. I did not then understand that its
name was Thought. But I talked with it, and

78 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

it comforted me. I waited for its coming, and
whatsoever it asked of me, I answered.

When it questioned me of my knowledge, I
said, “I know where the ﬁrst fresh violets of
spring grow, and where the lily of the Vale hides
in its broad green sheath, and where the vine
climbs to hang its purple clusters, and where the

forest nuts ripen, when Autumn comes with its

sparkling frost.

“ I have seen how the bee nourishes itself in
winter, with the essence of ﬂowers,“ which its
own industry embalmed; and I have learned to
draw forth the kindness of domestic animals, and
to tell the names of the birds which build dwell-
ings in my father’s trees.”

Then Thought inquired, “ what knowest thou
of those who reason, and to whom God has given
dominion over the beasts of the ﬁeld, and over
the fowls of the air 3”’ I confessed, that of my
own race I knew nothing, save of the parents
who nurtured me, and the few children with
whom I had played on the summer turf.

I was ashamed, for I felt that I was ignorant.
So I determined to turn away from the wild
herbs of the ﬁeld, and the old trees where I had
helped the gray squirrel to gather acorns, and to
look attentively upon'what passed among men.

I walked abroad when the morning dews were
lingering upon the grass, and the white lilies
drooping their beautiful heads to shed tears of

THE e1RL’s READING-BOOK. '79

joy, and the young rose blushing, as if it listened
to its own praise. Nature smiled upon those
sweet children, that were so soon to ‘fade.

But I turned toward those whose souls have
the gift of reason, and are not born to die. I
said, “if there is joy in the plant that ﬂourishes
for a day, and in the bird bearing to its nest but
a broken cherry, and in the lamb that has no
friend but its mother, how much "happier must
they be, whoare surrounded with good things, as
fwitha ﬂowing river, and -who know that, though
they seem to die, it is but to live forever.”

Iilooked upon a group ofchildren. They were
untaught and unfed, and clamoured loudly with
wayward tongues. I asked them why they walk-
ed not in the pleasant paths of knowledge. And
they mocked at me. I heard two who were
called friends, speak harsh words to each other,
and was affrighted at the blows they dealt.

I saw a man with a ﬁery and a bloated face.
He was built strongly, like the oak among trees.
Yet his steps were weak, and unsteady as those
of thetottering babe. He fell heavily, and lay
as one dead. I marvelled that no hand was
str‘etche’d out, to raise him up.

“I saw an open grave. A widow stood near it,
withher little ones. They looked downcast, and
‘sadat heart. Yet methought, it was famine and
misery, more than sorrow for the dead, which
had set on them such a yellow and shrivelled seal.

80 THE GmL’s READING-BOOK.

I said, “ what can have made the parents not
pity their children when they hungered, nor call
them home when they were in wickedness?
What made the friends forget their early love?

and the strong man fall down senseless? and

the young die before his time .9” I heard a Voice
say “ Intemperance ! And there is mourning in
the land, because of this.”

So I returned to my home, sorrowing. And
had God given me a brother or a sister, I would
have thrown my arms around their neck, and
entreated, “ touch not your lips to the poison cup,
and let us drink the pure water, which God hath
blessed, all the days of our lives.”

Again I went forth. I met a beautiful boy
weeping, and I asked him Why he wept. He
answered, “ because my father went to the wars
and is slain, he will return no more.” I saw a
mournful woman. The sun shone upon her
dwelling. The honey-suckle climbed to its wini-
dows, and sent in its sweet blossoms to do their
loving message. But she was a widow. Her
husband had fallen in battle. There was joy
for her no more. V

I saw a hoary man, sitting by the wayside.
Grief had made furrows upon his forehead, and
his garments were thin and tattered. Yet he
asked not for charity. And when I besought
him to tell me why his heart was heavy, he re-
plied faintly, “ I had a son, an only one. From

THE eInL’s READING-BOOK. 81

his cradle, I toiled, that he might have food and
elething, and be taught wisdom.

“He grew up to bless me. So all my labour
and weariness were forgotten. When he be-
came a man, I knew no want ; for he cherished
me, as I had cherished him. Yet. he left me to
be a soldier. He was slaughtered in the ﬁeld of
battle. Therefore, mine eye runneth down with
water, because the comforter that should relieve
my soul, returns no more.”

I said, “ shew me, I pray thee, a ﬁeld of battle,
that I may know what war means.” But he
answered, “ Thou art not able to bear the sight.”
“ Tell me, then,” I entreated, “ what thou hast
seen, when the battle was done.”

“ I came,” he said, “ at the close of day, when
the cannon ceased their thunder, and the victor
and vanquished had withdrawn. The rising
moon looked down on the pale faces of the dead.
Scattered over the broad plain were many who
still struggled with the pangs of death. »

“They stretched out the shattered limb, yet
there was no healing hand. They strove to raise
their heads, but sank deeper in the blood which
ﬂowed from their own bosoms. They begged
in God’s name, that we would put them out of
their misery, and their piercing shrieks entered
into my soul.

“ Here and there, horses mad with pain, rolled

andiplunged, mangling with their hoofs the

dying, or defacing the dead. And I remem-

bered the mourning for those who lay there-—-of
the parents who had reared them, or of the
young children who used to sit at home upon
their knee.”

But I said, “tell me no more of battle or of
war, for my heart is sick.” Then the silver
haired man raised his eyes upward, and I kneeled
down by his side.

And he prayed, “Lord, keep this child from
anger and hatred and ambition, which are the
seeds of war. Grant to all that own the name
of Jesus, hearts of peace, that they may shun
every deed of strife, and dwell at last in the
country of peace, even in heaven.”

Hastening home, I besought my mother,
“shelter me, as I have been sheltered, in soli-
tude, and in love. Bid me turn the wheel of
industry, or bring water from the fountain, or
tend the plants of the garden, or feed a young
bird and listen to its song, but let me go no more
forth among the vices and miseries of man.”

THE’ GOOD SISTER.

THE village bell tolled. Groups of people
were seen slowly assembling at the funeral call.
The hearse stood before the door of a small
house, with a vine—wreathed porch.

There the minister lifted up his solemn voice
in supplication, that the living might be supported
in their bitter parting with the dead. A feeble
wail from the chamber mingled with his prayer.
It was the moan of the young infant, from whom
its mother had been suddenly taken. ,

When the mournful family returned from the
grave, the oldest daughter folded the babe in her
arms, and pressed its little face long to hers.
Tears ﬂowed fast down her cheeks, as she said,
“ I will be a mother to you, my poor little one.”
And the upward glance of her eye told, that her
heart was asking of her Father in heaven, wis-
dom to supply to it the place of. that good parent
whom he had taken to himself.

“What will poor Mr. Allen do, now he has

  lost his wife?” said one of the neighbours. “He

is not able to hire a nurse, and to hear the poor
baby crying all the time the minister was at
prayer, was quite heart—rending.”

84 THE e1nL’s READING-BOOK.

“Do you not know,” said her friend, “that
Lucy, the eldest girl, has undertaken the care of
it? It is truly Wonderful to see one so young
preparing its food so well, and waking patiently
in the night to feed it, and so anxious to learn
how to nurse it when it is sick. We must go in
and encourage her.”

Lucy Allen was very careful to mingle the milk
for the babe in just proportion, and to give it at
regular intervals. She washed and dressed it
early in the morning, with the greatest tender-
ness, and lulled it to rest at the proper hours.

She sat by her sad father through the long
winter evenings. The babe lay sleeping in its
cradle by their side. If it awaked, she rocked
and lulled it with a tender Voice, and her father
blessed her.

It was a beautiful sight, to see that fair young
girl, week after week, nourishing the feeble
infant. Sometimes, when her gay companions
urged her to go with them and spend the evening,
she would say, “ the baby is not quite well, and
I am afraid to leave it so lontr.”

“ 0, you will make a mope of yourself for that
baby. I dare say it can do well enough, awhile
without you.” But Lucy would excuse herself
by saying, that her father looked lonely, and since
her dear mother’s death, she took more pleasure
in being at home with him, than in going out as
formerly.

THE G1RL’s READING-"BOOK. 85

The babe inclined to cry and be fretful. Lucy
said it was irritable, because it was unwell, and
as it grew stronger, it would grow more quiet.
And so it proved. She attended to its health,
and after a few months, its ﬁtsof crying abated.
It grew lively, and began to have a ruddy cheek.

She always spoke to it in a cheerful voice, and
looked at it with a smile, for she saw that this
seemed to make it happier: and said, “poor,
dear child, it has no mother to comfort it, and all
I can do is so much less than she would have
done, that I feel sorry for it.”

Lucy had not been accustomed to be disturbed
in her rest. VVhen she was kept waking a great
part of the night, as she sometimes was, while
the babe was getting teeth, she could not help
feeling tired and weak in the morning.

But she never complained. She remembered
how patiently her mother had nursed the others

in their sicknesses, and tried to imitate her. ,

And when the little one began to walk, and
when the ﬁrst word it lisped was her name, and
when it stretched forth its arms to her, as to a
mother, she felt more than repaid for all her toil.

But it was not the care of the infant alone,
that exercised Lucy’s affection and patience.
She had two other sisters and brothers, to whom
she tried to ﬁll a mother’s place. The sister
next to herself in age, was about thirteen, and
assisted much in the work of the family.

8:

86 THE cmL’s READING-BOOK.

She was not, however, always amiable, and
was sometimes jealous that Lucy intended to
rule her. But by mildness and kindness, Lucy
succeeded in convincing her that she had only her
good in view, and induced her to try to regulate
her temper and improve her character.

The two brothers were eleven and nine years
old. Lucy took great care that they should have
their lessons ready for school, and that they
should be there in season, and neatly dressed,
with clean hands and faces.

She charged them not to keep company with
bad boys, and gave them the same advice about
truth and honesty, and respect for age, and
reverence for the Sabbath, which her pious
mother had given to her.

One morning, the youngest boy came running
in—“ Sister Lucy, I have cut my ﬁnger dread-
fully. I did it in cutting a thick board with
father’s sharp knife.” She instantly produced
the basket, in which she kept lint, and soft pieces
of old linen, and salve, and cotton bats for burns,
and proceeded to do it up skilfully. But the
tears ﬂowed afresh. “ Does it pain you much,
little brother?” “ Yes. But the worst of it is,
father told me not to touch that knife, and I am
afraid to tell him.”

“You have done very wrong to disobey your
father. But you must own to him exactly how it
was. Faults are made worse by concealment.

THE GmL’s READING-BOOK. 87

I remember an old school-mistress, who used to
tell us, ‘speak truth, and let the sky fall.’ And
it was right advice, because God is a God of
truth, and requires truth of all who hope to live
in heaven at last.”

Her little brother promised her that he would
confess his fault. But she saw that he was very
much afraid, and remembered that her father
was sometimes inclined to be severe, and her
heart yearned towards the child.

So, she went out to meet him, when she saw
him coming home, and told him that her little
brother had done wrong, but had suffered in
consequence, and seemed penitent. The boy
confessed his fault, and the father forgave his
disobedience, for the sake of Lucy’s intercession.

The youngest girl was scarcely six. Between
herself and the babe there had been another,
who died, and she, in consequence of this, had
been much indulged.

Lucy felt the great importance that her moral
training should have vigilant attention. She
used towards her great gentleness and ﬁrmness,
and was always consistent, so that her word was
relied on, and respected. Soon the child became
obedient, and being very affectionate, grew
happy, and every day more attached to her
sister.

The principal fault of the little sister was
thoughtlessness. Lucy took great pains to teach

88 THE emL’s READING-BOOK.

her to attend, and to remember. She was very
apt to meet with accidents, to tear her clothes, or
to lose her little possessions.

Lucy never upbraided her, for she said this
was the way to maketchildren bad-tempered or
deceitful. But she steadily exerted herself to
make her think what she was about, and to put
things in the right place.

The second sister would often speak harshly
to the little one, when any accident befel her,
through what seemed to be her own careless-
ness. But Lucy begged her not to do so, and
said, “to scold at a child, makes them learn
to scold also, if tl1ey.dare; and if they dare
not, frightens them into falsehood.” So, the
child, when she tore her frock or her apron,
brought it trustingly to Lucy’s needle, and heed-
ed, out of gratitude, the advice that she gave
her. '

The father was greatly comforted by Lucy’s
goodness. When he told her so, she felt that
it was an over-payment for all her toil. Her
brothers and sisters, as they grew up, blessed
their good sister. d

When ever she was in doubtrespecting her
duty to them, she asked herself, what would
my dear mother have done? If the duty was
diﬂicult, she retired to her chamber, and prayed
to Him, from whom is all our suﬂiciency, and
He gave her the strength that she needed. A

All who knew Lucy Allen, admired her conduct.
The mothers wished for such a daughter, and
the young for such a friend. She was considered
more beautiful than those who ﬂaunted in ﬁne
dress, or sought for fashionable amusement; for
the warmest, purest aifections beamed in her
face, and they are the true beauty of the heart.

But happy as she was, in the love of all the
good, she felt the highest thrill of pleasure, when
the babe that she had reared to a healthful and
fair child, came to her with all its little joys and
sorrows, saying, that “ better than all the world
beside, it loved its dear sister-m0tlzer.”

EDUCATION.

WHAT is a good education ? We hear much
about it. Who will tell us what it is P Every
child in school expects to obtain it. But it is ne-
cessary that they should ﬁrst know what it means.

Is it to get lessonsiwell, and to excel in every
study? This is a part, but not all. Some make
great progress for a time, and then become in-
dolent. Others are distinguished while they go
to school,——-but when they leave it, cease to im-
prove.‘ ’

Is it a knowledge of books? Yes, and some-
thing more. It is possible to possess learning,
and be ignorant of necessary things. There was
a lady who read many books, yet did not know
if her dress was in a proper condition, and could
not always ﬁnd her way home, when she went

abroad.

THE TRUE FRIEND.

YOUNG persons are fond of agreeable society.
A lonely room, or a solitary evening, does not
suit their cheerful temperament. They are
willing to bear fatigue, the heat of the summer’s
sun, or the storm of winter, to meet a pleasant
companion.

They naturally wish to obtain. a friend, in
Whom they can conﬁde. They read much of the
pleasures of friendship, and are anxious to pos-
sess a treasure which the wise and good extol.

Shall I tell you of a pleasant companion, and
a true friend, who is always near, and whose
acquaintance may be readily secured? Should
you ever live far from neighbours, or be divided
from your parents and relatives, such an acqui-
Sitiml Wolild be highly valuable.

First, let me describe this friend to you. She
is exceedingly like yourself. Her eyes and the
tones of her voice are the same. When you are
good and happy, she smiles also. In your sor-
rows she sympathizes. She makes your joys
her own.

You perceive that she has the qualities of a
good friend. In one respect, she will be better

THE GIRL’s READING-BOOK. 91

to you than any other. The dearest friends die
and leave us. We mourn in desolation over
their graves. But the friend of whom I speak,
hasthe assurance of living as long as you do, and
at your own death-bed will be nearer to you than
the [nearest relation.

She might say to you in the beautiful language
of Ruth, “whither thou goest, I will go; where
thou lodgest, I will lodge; thy people shall be
my people, and thy God my God; where thou
diest, I will die, and there will I be buried; the
Lord do so to me, and more also, if aught but
death part thee and me.”

Will you be introduced to this friend? She
has some peculiarities, of which it is but right to
inform you. When you try daily to improve,
and are industrious, and affectionate, and pious,
she is in good health. But when you fail in your
duties, she is sick and sad, and no common
physician can understand her case, or give her
medicine.

If you persist invdoing wrong, she has a way
of hanging a heavy weight in your breast, which
those who have felt it, say is a severe.punish-
ment. She is said also to have some tendency
to jealousy, and not to like the presence of a third
person, at her particular interviews.

But though she wishes exclusive attention
during the period devoted to her, she isnot un-
reasonable in her claims upon your time. ' Half

an hour out of the twenty-four, will content her.
And she chooses this half hour should be the last

before retiring, when the business of the day is  

done.

She requires that you should be punctual to
meet her at the appointed time, and frank in
replying to all the questions she may see ﬁt to
propose. And now, will you cultivate an inter-
course with this personage E’ It will certainly do
you no harm. Can this be said ofall with whom
you associate?

Those who have made the greatest progress in
her intimacy, acknowledge that the beginning
was rather awkward’, for she is averse to ﬂattery,
and apt to blame what is wrong. But as they
persevere, it becomes delightful, and her smile
is a rich reward for every toil.

v If you wish to enlarge“ the circle of your ac-

quaintance by such a friend, tell her so. Promise
to conform to her modes of conversation. Sit
down alone, and wait for her, when the cares and
employrnents of the day, like shut roses, are
drinking the dews of slumber.

While you meditate, she is near. When you
hear a still voice, like a soft breath passing over
your cheek, be ready to**=~answer with truth, such
questions as the following: “ Did you rise early
this morning ? and were your first thoughts turn-
ed to Him who protected you through the night,
and is alone able to sustain you through the day 1’

THE GmL’s' READING-BOOK. 93

“Have you realized the value of time, and
laboured to improve it ? Have you been obedi-
ent to your parents and teachers, and respectful
to the aged?

“ Have you been affectionate to your brothers,
sisters, and companions, and tried to promote
the comfort of all with whom you dwell? Have
you instructed the ignorant ? or relieved the
poor? or shown kindness to the sick and sor-
rowful?

“Have you been patient when you were dis-
appointed, and restrained your temper when you
were provoked? Did you repress vanity, and in
‘ all lowliness pf mind, esteem others better than
yourself?’

“ Have you preserved a cheerful countenance
and manners, and tried to make all around you
happy? Shall your last act, before you retire to
rest, be, to thank the Almighty Father for all ‘his
mercies, and implore his aid to advance daily in
wisdom and piety?”

Happy are you, if you can answer these ques-
tions in the afﬁrmative. The True F1'z'eml' who
proposes them, is your own heart. Make it your
nightly monitor. It will strengthen you in the
race of virtue, and its payment is the approval
of conscience, that pure gold, which rust cannot
corrupt, nor robber take away,

THE HAPPY FAMILY.

I ONCE passed several months under the roof
of a farmer. It was to me one of the pleasant-
est and most proﬁtable visits I had ever made.
For I saw continually around me, that industry,
economy, and contentment, which make every
rational household happy.

The whole family rose before the sun. After
an early breakfast, every one proceeded to the
business of the day. The farmer and his sons
went with their workmen to the ﬁeld. The swift
strokes of the churn were heard, changing the
rich cream to the golden-coloured butter. I was
never Weary of watching the progress of the
cheese, from its ﬁrst consolidation, to its recep-
tion in the press, and its daily attentions in the
dairy.

Above stairs, the sound of the loom, and the
ﬂight of the shuttle, allured me. There, various
fabricks for the comfort of the family were
wrought out, from the carpet on which they
trod, to the snowy linen that covered their beds,
and the ﬁrm garments from the ﬂeece of their
sheep, in which they fearlessly braved the cold
of winter.

But my delight was especially in the spinning-
room. There the wheels turned swiftly with
merry music. The step of the spinner was light,
and her face cheerful, as she drew even threads
from the fair white roll, or the blue one that
was to furnish stockings for the father and
brothers.

Masses of yarn, assorted according to its vari-
ous texture and destination, hung upon the wall.
Each one was pleased to add to the store, her
new skeins. The ﬂying reel told audibly the
amount of every. spindle, and pronounced when
theuseful task of the day was done. This seem-
ed to me the kind of industry, which more than
any other promoted cheerfulness and health.

Theidaughters of the family had blooming and
happy countenances. They used their strength
freely in domestic toils, and when they went out
to any distance, rode well and fearlessly on horse-
back. They seemed never to have any nervous
complaints, or to need a physician. Exercise,

i and the healthful food on which they fed, and

their own happy spirits, were their medicines.

The mother superintended all that concerned
them, with a serious dignity. She taught them
every necessary employment, by ﬁrst taking part
in it herself, and then deputing it to them. She
induced them to consider the interests of their
father as their own, and instructed them by her
own example how to lessen his expenses.

She sent to market, in the best order, the
surplus of her dairy, and poultry-yard, and lo_om.
It was her ambition, that the ﬁner parts of the
wardrobe of herself and family, should be thus
procured. It pleased her better, than to make
demands upon the purse of her husband.

Her eldest daughters desired to have some
money of their own, to purchase such books as
they liked, and to assist the poor. She encour-
aged their design, and gave them a room in
which to rear the silk-worm. There they were
seen busily tending that curious insect, whose
changes from the little egg like a mustard-seed,
to the cell of silken tapestry where it gathers up
its feet to die, shew the wonderful hand of that
Being, who is “ excellent in working.”

Their small skeins of silk, tastefully arranged
for sale, imitated the colours of the rainbow, and

they were delighted to ﬁnd, how soon the wand

of industry could convert the ‘mulberry leaf to
silk, and the silk to gold. They also aided their
younger brothers in a pursuit which interested
them——the care of bees.

Rows of hives were ranged in a sunny and
genial spot. Beds of ﬂowers, and fragrant
herbs, were planted to accommodate the winged
chymists. The purest honey gave variety to
their table, and the superﬂux, with the wax that
was made from the comb, were among the most
saleable articles of their domestic manufacture.

The long winter evenings in the farmer’s
house were delightful. More healthy and happy
faces I have never seen. Yet there was perfect
order. For the parents, who commanded respect,
were always seated among the children. And in
the corner, in the warmest place, was the silver»
haired grandmother, with her clean cap, who
was counted as an oracle.

The father, or his sons, read aloud such Works
as mingle entertainment with instruction. The
females listened with interest, or made remarks
with animation, though their busy hands directed
the ﬂight of the needle, or made the stocking
grow. The quiet hum of the ﬂax-wheel, was
held no interruption to the scene, or to the voice
of the reader.

The neighbour coming in, was greeted with a
cordial Welcome, and a simple hospitality. Rows
of ruddy apples, roasted before the ﬁre, and vari-
ous nuts from their own forest-trees, were an
appropriate treat for the social winter—evening,
where heart opened to heart.

Sometimes, the smaller children , clustered
around the grandmother’s chair, begging her for
a story. She told them of the days when she
was young like them, and of the changes that
her life had known. Especially, she loved to tell
of the lessons of her parents, and of the obedience
with which she regarded them.

“ They taught me,” said she, “ to work, and
not to be ashamed of industry. I had a com-
panion, about my own age, who once spent a
few months at a city boarding—school. When
she came home, it was observed that she was
ashamed to be seen doing the same useful things,
by which the family were supported.

“ Her mother directed her to go and milk the
favourite cow, which she had so long been accus-
tomed to do before she went to school, that it
was called her own. While she was doing it,

‘ a neighbour came into the barn yard, and she

was so much afraid of being seen, that she hid
her head under the cow, till she was almost
smothered.

“Whenever my mother thought I was not
pleased with humble occupations, or plain cloth-
ing, she would say, ‘ child, don’t hide your head
under the cow.’ And this made me so much
ashamed, that I willingly did whatever she
thought bests And now, children, never be
ashamed of honest industry, for it is more fool-
ish than to hide your heads under a cow, in a
warm day.”

Thus, by simple stories wouldshe instruct
them in the various duties of life. Especially
would she warn them to fear God, and keep
his commandments. At the stated hour of re-
tiring, a sweet and solemn hymn, in which

every voice joined, gave praise to the Almighty
Preserver.

Then the great Bible, taken from the place
where it was carefully kept, was laid before the
father of the family. He reverently read a por-
tion from its sacred pages, and in prayer com-
mitted his beloved household to the care of Him
who never slumbers.

During my visit to this well regulated family,
I was often led to reﬂect on the peculiar advan-
tages of a f'armer’s lot. He is the possessor of
true independence. Sheltered from those risks
and reverses, which in crowded cities await those
who make haste to be rich, he feels that patient
industry will ensure a competent support for
himself and family.

His children are a part of his wealth. They
are a capital, whose value increases every year
that they remain with him. If he incurs mis-
fortune, they join and help him out, instead of
hanging round his neck like millstones, to sink
him into deeper waters.

The habits which prevail in his family, the
domestic industry, the love of home, the order
and simplicity cherished there from ancient
times, promote the true excellence of the female
character. Many of our most illustrious men
have been the sons of farmers, and traced the
elements of their distinction, to the hardihood
and discipline of agricultural nurture.
