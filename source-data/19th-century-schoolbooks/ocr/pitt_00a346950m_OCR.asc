of the Northern District of New York.

PREFACE.

IT is the peculiar fortune of the people of the United
States, to live under a government that secures to them,
in an extraordinary degree, the blessings of civil and re-
ligious liberty. It is believed that no other form of gov-

ernment is capable of conferring upon its citizens an equal‘

amount of happiness.

Under our constitution, sovereignty resides with the
people: in other words, they have the power of govern~
ing themselves. Consequently, it is of the ﬁrst impor-
tance, that the depositories of political power should know
how to apply this power intelligently and judiciously.
The power to make and to administe-r.the§laws, is delegat-
ed to.»!the representatives and agents of the people;. the
people should. therefore be competent to judge when, and

how far, this power is constitutionally and beneﬁcially ‘

exercised. .
Distinguished as the American people are for their

comparative general intelligence, alarge portion of them, .

it must he confessed, are greatly wanting in political
knowledge. And while so many books have been pre-
pared to facilitate the means of instruction, and so much
has been done in various ways to promote the interests of
education generally, it is remarkable that the science of
government has received so little attention. a r .

,tMu1titudes in this republic are annually arriving at the V
. period of life, when they are to exercise, forthe first time,

their privileges as citizens. In the state «of New York
alone, the number is about ﬁfteen thousand; and is [com-
posed, chieﬂy, of those whose education does not embrace

oven the ﬁrst principles of political science,,;_ It iB9n9§,,tp.-

be expected that political power, in such hands, can be
exercised with safety to the government, or with beneﬁt
to the community.

In the education of youth for the business of life, it
seems almost to be forgotten, that they are ever to assume
the duties of citizensmduties of paramount importance,
on the due performance of which, their individual happi-
ness. as Well as the happiness and prosperity of the na-
tion, mainly depends.

The following just and forcible observations, are from
pa late report of the superintendent of common schools of
the state of New York. They are entitled to the consid-
eration of every citizen of this republic:

“ On our common schools we must rely to prepare the
great body of the people for maintaining inviolate the
rights of freemen. If the political fabric cannot ﬁnd in
the public intelligence, a basis broad and ﬁrm enough to
uphold it, it cannot long resist the shocks to which, through
the collision of contending interests, it is continually ex-
posed. Forty—nine out of every ﬁfty of our citizens, re-
ceive their education in the common schools. As they
advance to manhood, they are, for the most part, devoted
to manual ernployments; Looking to their own industry,
as their only resource, and to its fruits as the boundaries
of their personal desires the object nearest their hearts is

to see their country prosperous, the laws administered

with order and regularity, and the political importance,
which the constitution has seicrired to them, maintained
undiminished. i The controversies to which conflicting

interests give birth, are to be put at rest by their decision. c

In the questions of policy which are presented to them,

constitutional principles are frequently, involved, andthe,
relation they bear, and may in all future time bear to the a

government, is directly or indirectly aﬁected. How in»

PREFACE. V

portant is itthat their decisions should be as enlightened
as they will be honest; that with every motive to be up-
right and conscientious in the exercise of their political
rights, they should combine also the capacity to maintain
them with independence and discretion! If they shall ev-
er cease to bring to the settlement of these great questions
a sound and enlightend discrimination, they cannot fail
to become the dupes ot artful leaders, and their country a
prey to internal discord. From the genius of our politi-
cal institutions, popular. education is our only security
against present and future dangers. Ignorance is said to
be the parent of vice. With us it would also be the pa-
rent of those fatal disorders in the body politic, which
have their cerain issue in anarchy.”

In presenting this Work to the public, the compiler in-
tends to supply, in some measure, a deﬁciency that has
too long existed in the course of education in this country.
Several excellent treatises on the principles of government,
and constitutional jurisprudence, have been published
within a few years. But it is believed th.at of those which
are intended as class books, none are Well adapted to the
condition of our common schools. y ‘

But it is not for common schools exclusively, that this
work is intended. It is believed that there are individu-
als in almost every family, who will ﬁnd in it much valu-
able information to which they have not before had ac-
cess. i

The author has endeavored, throughout the work, to
present each subject in a plain and familiar style; and it
is believed the languagewill be found sufficiently intel-
ligible to those who are of suitable age and capacity to
be beneﬁted by the study of this science. And he would
here take occasion to remind the reader or student of the
importance of referring to his dictionary for the deﬁnition

Y1 PREFACE.

of such words as may not be understood. Much of the
advantage of reading is often lost, especially to young
persons, by the neglect of this practice. I

The questions relating to the several sections, are
deemed useful in exercising the pupil. A few only are in-

serted, leaving it to the teacher to add such further inter-

rogatories as he shall ﬁnd necessary. Teachers will also
find occasion to tax their own resources, in enlarging upon
and illustrating the several subjects,which could not be ful-
ly treated, without swellingthe work to an improper size.

The chapter on the rights of landlord and tenant, not
being originally designed for insertion, does not occupy
its appropriate place in the work; but as it was deemed
too important to be omitted, it has been inserted in the Ap-
pendix.

Originality in a Work ofthis kind is hardly to be ex-
pected. Whatever of merit, therefore, may be awarded
to this unpretending volume, is chieﬂy due to other and

abler authors, Among the works to which the compiler

is indebted, he would particuarly mention, SulliVan’s
“Political Class Book,” Chiprnan’s “Principles of Gov»-
e.rnn1en’t,” Duer’s “Outlines of Constitutional Jurisprua
dence,” and the invaluable “Commentaries” of Story and
Kent. i

VVith the hope that this treatise, notwithstanding its
imperfections, will be found in some degree useful, it is
respectfully offered to the patronage of a liberal commu-
nity._

OF THE PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT.

CHAPTER‘ 1.

‘Of Ellen asﬁttecl for Sot:z'et_1/, and for Civil Govcrmnmt
and Laws.

1. IT has been maintained that the savage state is the
only natural state of man, and that he can, in no other

‘state, be perfectly happy. It is supposed that social im-

provement generates a wicked disposition in man, which
might, in an uncrvilrzed state, forever he dormant; and

that civil government has a tendency to encourage vice,‘

and becomes the cause of the miseries that exist in socie-
ty, instead of preventing them.

 Others maintain that the necessity of laws arises
from the wicked disposition of man; that they are neces-
sary only to restrain the evil and violent passions; and
to prevent the miseries which men are prone to inﬂict on
each other: consequently, were all men truly virtuous
and purely benevolent, laws for their government would
be wholly unnecessary.

designed for civil government, and that he is under a
necessity of nature to adopt it; but who hold, at the same
time, that, on entering into civil society, he necessarily
gives up a portion of his natural liberty, of his natural
rights, to secure the remainder. It seems to follow, as the
conclusion of this theory, that man is but partially ﬁtted
for civil society. This opinion, however, is supported by
many of the most distinguished political writers.

4. But a theory somewhat different from these, and, it
is believed, a more correct one, has been adopted by some
writers, who maintain, that man is ﬁtted for society by the
constitution and laws of his nature; and that, for the se~
cure enjoyment of both natural and civil rights, govern-
ment and laws are necessary to social beings, with what-
ever virtues they may be enclued.

5. But whatever difference of opinion may prevail in
regard to the correctness of these several theories, few, it
is presumed, will doubt, that man is ﬁtted by nature for
society and civil government: and that, in his present
state, civil government and laws are necessary for the
regulation of his conduct.

6. “W/Ian is so formed by nature,” says Vattel, “ that
he cannot suffer by himself, and he necessarily stands in
need of the assistance and support of creatures like him-
selﬁ to preserve and protect his own being, and to enjoy
the life of a rational animal. This is sufficiently proved
by experience. We have instances of men nourished
among the bears, who had neither a language nor the
use of reason, and, like the beasts, had only the sensual
powers.

7. “We see moreover that nature has refused men the
natural strength and arms with which she has furnished
other animals, giving them, instead of these advantages,
those of reason and speech, or at least of acquiring them
by a commerce with their fellow beings. Speech enables
them to converse with each other, and to extend and raise

on this subject? To what conclusion does this theory lead’! _4\

W~lliat other theory has been adopted, in relation to man’s canaﬁgty

fersociety and civil govcrnmt at, and the necessity of laWsTm6,“77_

to perfection their reason and knowledge; and, being thus
rendered intelligent, they ﬁnd a ‘thousand methods of pre~
serving themselves, and supplying their wants. Every
one also becomes sensible that he can neither live happily,
nor improve himself, without the assistance and conversa-
tion of others. Since, then, nature has thus formed
mankind, it is a manifest proof that she has designed they
should converse with one another, and grant to each other
their mutual assistance.”

8. That man is by nature designed for society, may be
inferred also from his appetite to associate with his fellow
man. The appetite or propensity for this association, and
the pleasure derived from it, are common to all mankind,
and evidently originate in their nature.

9. Man seems equally ﬁtted for civil, government. He
has been endowed With high moral and intellectual facul-
ties. He has the power to discern his own Wants and
the wants of ‘others.~ He hasa moral perception of what
is right and what is wrong, and a sense of ﬁis obligation
to do What is right, and to forbear to do what is wrong.
His reason enables him to understand the meaning of

laws, and it’) discover What laws arg necessary to regulate
human actions.

10. Patriotism, or love of country, prevails universally
among mankind; and this national attachment leads men
to seek and to promote the welfare of the community to
which they belong, and contributes much to the ﬁtting of
them for civil government.

ll. But with all his adaptation to society, and his ca-
pacities for civil government, man, being imperfect, will
be guilty of deviating from the rule of rectitude, and of
infringing the rights of others. Whether this transgres-
sion be the consequence of ignorance, weakness in judg-‘
ing, or inattention in examining; or whether it result

from a disposition habitually vicious; laws are necessary
to regulate the conduct of men toward each other, and to
secure to the members of a community the enjoyment of
their rights. Without laws, there would be no security
to person or property; the evil passions of men would
prompt them to commit all manner of wrongs against
each other, and render society, (if society can be said to
.GX1St without law,) a scene of violence and confusion.

CHAPTER II.

Of Rights and Liberty.—-—-Na,tm*al, Civil and Political
Rights and Liberty-—-Right of Opinion.

12. THE word right, when applied to action, signiﬁes
what is fit and proper to be done, as opposed to wrong.
But as a Substantive, in the sense in which it is here used,
it means the jllsttltlb or claim which a person has to any
thing; and it signiﬁes that the thing belongs to him who
is said to have the right. Thus it is declared in the
American Declaration of Independence :' »“ that all men
are endowed with certain. unalienable rights; that among
these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that
to secure these riglets, governments are instituted among
men, deriving their just powers from the consentof the
governed; and that, whenever any form of government
becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the
people to alter or abolish it.”

13. The object of civil institutions is, or ought to be,
the security of those personal rights, in the full and free
enjoyment of which true liberty consists. The rights of
mankind are denominated, ﬁrst, natural rights; secondly,
political rights; and thirdly, civil rights.

12. What is the deﬁnition of the word might, as applied to action?
What as asubstantive’! In what sense is it here used’! 13. ‘What
is the object of civil -institutions’! 14. What are natural 7‘?,g'/MS?

Chap. II. incurs AND LIBERTY. 21

14. Natural rights are said to consist in the rights of
personal liberty, of personal secu':ity,_and of private prop-
erty. These laws originate in the laws of am‘ nature ;
and they cannot be forfeited but by the commission of
some crime against the good and wholesome laws of the
community.

15. Political and civil rights are generally considered
and treated as belonging tothe same class of rights;
although each is clearly a. distinct class. Political rights
are the rights and powers granted to the people by the
constitution, or fundamental law of the state. The right
and power of making laws, the power of appointing,
electing and controlling the officers of a government, and
the right of altering and amending the constitutionitself,
are rights conferred by the constitution, and are therefore
properly denominated political rights.

16. ‘Civil rights are those that are guarantied to citi-
zens by civil institutions, and are contained in the class
of natural rights——-the right of personal liberty, of per-
sonal security, and of private property, together with the
numerous ‘rights derived from these. They are called
natural rights, as they have their foundation in the laws
of social nature; but they are denominated civil rights,
because, for their secure enjoyment, they depend on the
social or civil compact. By civil compact is understood
that agreement or contract, by the terms of which the
members of a community are governed. The right to
obtain legal redress for an injury done by another, or the
right secured to an individual by the laws of the commu-
nity to which he belongs, of enjoying the free use of hi!
property, are therefore termed civil rights. ,

17. Liberty, applied to man, consists in the free exer-
cise and enjoyment of his rights; and this liberty is either
natural, civil, or political, according as reference is had to
one or the other of these rights. Herein consists the
difference between liberty and right : the latter signifying

the just claim or title which a person has to any thing;
the former, the exercise and enjoyment of ‘his rights.

18. Natural liberty consists in a power and freedom of
acting as one thinks ﬁt, without any constraint or control,
unless by the laws of his social nature. In other Words,
moral or natural liberty is a permission which nature
gives to all mankind of disposing of their persons and
property, in such a manner as they shall judge most con-
sonant with their own happiness; on condition that they
act according to the laws of nature; that they do not in
any way abuse it to the prejudice of other men; and that
they observe towards others all the moral duties enjoined
by these laws.

19. It is not essential to the enjoyment of natural lib~
erty, that a man may do whatever his passions may urge
him to attempt. If, therefore, moral obligation be con-
sistent with moral or natural liberty, it would seem that
man does not necessarily give up, as some suppose that
he does, a portion of his natural liberty, when he enters
into civil society. The physical power to injure himself
or others, does not imply” that the laws of his nature give
him a right to do so. The law of nature is founded on
the principles of justice; which require every man to re-
gard the rights of others as well as his own.

20. Civil liberty consists in the secure exercise and
enjoyment of all civil rights. It is that liberty which a
man enjoys as a member of society, and is said to be no
other than natural liberty just sofar restrained as is ne-
cessary and expedient for the general advantage of the
public. It can be enjoyed only under an upright and
impartial administration of just, equal and expedient
laws.

ment of political rights, rights reserved to the people by
the constitution, the fundamental laws of a state, in such
manner, and under such regulations only, as are provided

md authorized by these laws. The important end of
aolitical liberty, and for which alone it is valuable, is to
tenure the permanentenjoyment of civil liberty. It is
he only security against political slavery.
2:2. Besides the rights above mentioned, is the right of
npinions The right of private opinion, or of private
adgment, is a right that cannot be interfered with Without
 violation of the law of nature. The exercise and en-
pyment of this right consist in the liberty of a man to
*tCt agreeably to his religious opinion; and in the liberty
of political opinion, the liberty of every person to express
and publish his opinions on all subjects relative to the
government. Among the “unalienable rights” with
which men are created, is reliigioust liberty. This liberty
has been denominated “the liberty of conscience,” and
“the rights of conscience.” It is deﬁned to be, “the
liberty which a man has of discussing and maintaining
his religious opinions, and of worshipping God in that
way and manner, which he believes in his conscience to
he most acceptable to his Maker, without being liable to
any degradation, penalties or disqualifications, civil or
political.” The liberty of speech and of the press, and
the liberty of conscience, are enjoyed in the United States
to their full extent. But this liberty does not imply that
a person may so act as to violate the rights of others, or
to disturb the good order of society.

CHAPTER III.

Of Laws.-—-‘T/re Law of Natm'e-—-—La/w of Revelation--
]lI1micipcLlLaw———La/w of Nations.

23. ‘LAW, in its most general and comprehensive sense,
signifies a rule of action; and is applied indiscriminately
to all kinds of action, whether animate or inanimate,
rational or irrational. Thus We say, the laws of motion,
of gravitation, of optics, of mechanics, as Well as the laws
of nature and of nations. And it is a rule prescribed by
some superior, and which the inferior is bound to obey.
In a more conﬁned sense, it denotes the rules of human
action or conduct: that is, the precepts by which man,
the noblest of all sublunary beings, a creature endowed
with both reason and free will, is commanded to make
use of these faculties in the general regulation of his
behavior.

24. Man, considered as a creature, must necessarily be
subject to the laws of his Creator; for he is entirely a
dependent being. A being independent of any other, has
no rule to observe but such as he prescribes to himself:
but a state of dependence obliges the inferior to take the
will of him on Whom he depends as the rule of his
conduct, in all those points in which his dependence con-
sists. t

25. As man is dependent on his Maker for ever
thing, he ‘should in all points conform to his Maker’ s will’.
This will of his Maker is called the law of mmwe. For
God, when he created man, and endued him With free
will, laid down certain immutable laws of human nature,
by which that free will was in some degree regulated and
restrained, and gave him also the faculty of reason to dis-
cover the meaning of these laws. These laws are found-
ed in those relations of justice that existed in the nature
of things.

23. What is law, in a general sense’! In a more conﬁned sense?

‘Chap. III. or THE NATURE or LAWS. 25

26. These are the eternal and unchangeable laws of
good and evil to which the Creator himself conforms;
and whichhe has enabled human reason to discover, so
far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions.
Among the principles of these laws are the following:
That we should live honestly, should hurt nobody, and
should render to every one his due. And in order to
prompt men to pursue the rule of right, the Creator has
been pleased to make their happiness depend on the
practice of this rule. This law of nature is superior to
all other laws. It is binding in all countries, and at all
times; and no human laws which are contrary to it, are
of anyvalidity.

27. If man’s reason were always, as before his trans-
gression, clear and perfect, and unclouded by prejudice,
he wouldneed no other guide: but his moral faculties
having been impaired, Divine Providence, in compassion

to the frailty, imperfection and blindness of human reason,

has been pleased to discover and enforce his laws by im~
mediate and direct revelation. The doctrines thus deliv-
ered are called the revealed or divine law, and are found
in the Holy Scriptures. These precepts agree with the
original law of nature. Both originate from the same
source, are of equal obligation, and tend alike to promote
the good of mankind.

28. Upon thesetwo foundations, the law of nature and
the law of revelation, all human laws depend: that is to
say, no human laws should he suffered to contradict these.
If any human law should enjoin us to do any thing that
is forbidden by the natural or divine law, We are bound
to transgress that human law. But in regard to matters
which are neither commanded nor forbidden‘ by those-
superior laws, a human legislature may make an action.

tion of a certain commodity from a foreign country, the
importation of such commodity would be an unlawful
act, although in; itself not unlawful, being neither com-
manded nor forbidden by a superior law.

29. Municipal or civil law, as deﬁned by Blackstone,
is a rule by which particular districts, communities or
nations are governed; a rule of civil conduct prescribed
by the supreme power of a state, commanding what is
right, and prohibiting What is wrong. Municipal, derived
from a Latin word, had reference to the particular customs
of one single mumlcipium or free town; yet it is with suf-
ﬁcient propriety applied to a state or nation which is gov-
erned by the same laws and customs.

30. But the deﬁnition of municipal law, as given by

the celebrated English commentator, is not strictly correct
when applied to municipal law in a free government,
where absolute and unlimited power is not committed to
any one of its organs. A discriminating American author
gives the following as a more accurate deﬁnition: “ Mu-
nicipal law is a rule of civil conduct prescribed by a
competent authority in the state, enjoining what ought to
be done, and prohibiting what ought not to be done.”

31. Chancellor Kent, in his commentaries on Ameri-
can law, observes: “The principle in the English gov-
ernment, that the parliament is omnipotent, does not
prevail in the United States; though, if there be no con-
stitutional objection to a statute, it is with us as absolute
and uncontrollable as laws ﬂowing from the sovereign
power under any other form of government. But in this,
and in all other countries, where there is a written»con-
stitution designating the powers and duties of the legisla-
tive, as well as of the other departments of the government,
an act of the legislature may be void as being against the
constitution.”

32 As it is impossible for the Whole race of mankind
to be united in one great society, they must necessarily
divide into many, and form separate states and nations,
entirely independent of ‘ each other, and yet liable to mu-
tual intercourse. Hence arises another kind of law-, called
the law of nations. This law is deﬁned to be “the sci-
ence of the law subsisting between nations and. states,
and of the obligations that ﬂow from it.” It is properly
divided into three kinds: First, the necessary or internal
law of nations; secondly, the conventional; and thirdly,
the customary law of nations. ~

33. The internal law of nations is the law of nature
applied to nations or states as moral persons. This law
is called necessary/, because nations are absolutely obliged
to observe it. It is called internal, as it is obligatory in
point of conscience. It is also termed the natwral law of
nations. The law of nature as applied to nations, as well
as when applied to individuals, aims at the general good
of mankind. ‘It requires them to do for others what their
necessities demand, and What they are capable of doing,
without neglecting the duties the owe to themselves. So
far as the law of nations is founded on the principles of
natural law, it is equally binding in every age, and upon
all mankind. T

34. There are, however, some cases in which the law
of nature is not applied to states as to individuals, as the
subjects are different from each other. Individual mem-
bers of a community are associated for their mutual beneﬁt,
under laws by which they agree to be governed. But as
‘nations are independent, each is the ‘sole judge of its
rights, of the violation of these rights by others, and of
the mode of redress. In case a dispute arises between
two nations, no other is permitted to impose constraint on
either party. Each has the liberty of judging what its
duty requires. a

35. Obligation is distinguished into internal and exter-
nal. It is internal, as it binds the conscience, and com-
prehends the rule of duty: it i-s external, as it is consid-
ered relatively to other men, and as some right flows
from it. External obligation is divided into perfect and
imperfect, as is also the right produced by such obliga-
tion. The perfect obligation is that which produces a
right to constrain him on whom the obligation rests, to
fulﬁl it; the imperfect gives only a right to demand. The
obligations and rights of nations are therefore imperfect:
each has the liberty of judging what its duty requires,
and of “doing as it chooses, without being obliged by
another to do otherwise. A

36. The law of nations is conventional, when it is es-
tablished by treaties, leagues or agreements. A treaty
is a bargain or agreement between two nations, by which
they mutually promise to be governed in their conduct
toward each other. This law is also called the arbitrary
law of nations. It is fully obligatory on the contracting
parties, so far as it does not violate the rights of others,
or the duties which each owes to itself;

37. The customary law of nations is founded on a tacit
consent of those nations that have observed it with respect
to each other, and is mutually binding on all who have
adopted it, until they expressly declare that they will not
adhere to it. No custom, hoWever,,though. it may have
been established by long and universal usage, is of any
force, if its observance requires the violation of a natural
law; and such custom should be abandoned.

CHAPTER IV.
Of the dzferent Forms of Government’.

38. GOVERNMENT, in apolitical serise, is that form of’
fundamental rules and principles by which a state or nu-~
tion is governed, or by which the members of a body
politic are to regulate their social actions. By governs
ment is also meant the administration of public affairs,
according to established constitutions, laws and usages.

39. The object of government is to secure to the mem~
bers of a community the enjoyment of their natural rights.
As every government is designed to- promote the happi-

ness and well being of its citizens, that government must

be the best which conduces mostto this end.. Govern-
ments, good or bad, have existed in all ages.

40. The most common forms of government are the
following:

(1.) A despotism; in which arbitrary power is exercised
by one man. Despot is a Word of Greek origin, signify»
ing master, or lord. At a later period, it became an
honorary title, given by the Greek emperors to their sons
and sons—in-law, when governors of provinces. At pres-
ent it means an absolute ruler, as the emperor of Russia.
In a narrower sense, it conveys the idea of t ranny.
Tyrant, also, is of Greek -origin, and has nearl t e same
meaning as despot, signifying king, or abso ute ruler.
These Words had not -originally the bad signiﬁcation
which is now attached to them. But as the possessor of
uncontrolled power usually abuses it, they came at length
to signify abuser of power.

41. Turkey and Russsia are despotic in a high degree.
In Turkey, the sultan has unlimited control over the
property and lives of his subjects, especially the highest
officers of state, whom he can remove or put to death at

his will. He makes laws without being himself subject
to them. He is‘ restrained only by the Koran and the

‘fear of rebellion. The Kocrcm is the bible of the Ma-

hometans, containing the pretended revelations of their
prophet. The people have no rights. Such is their ig-
norance, that they do not seem to know that they could
be in a better condition. _

42.  An dristocmcy; in which the supreme power
is exercised by privileged classes, or in which they are
allowed a disproportionate share. When tyranny is in
the hands of a-few, it is called an oligarch;/, which is by
some thought to be the worst of all governments.

43. (3.) A mono/relay; which is a form of government
in which the supreme power is lodged in the hands of a
:single person. Such a state is usually called a kingdom,
or an empire. This name is generally given to a large

state onl . But it is sometimes a lied to a state or kin -
57 PP 3

dom in which the supreme magistrate is limited by a
constitution or laws. Hence We speak of despotic
or absolute mondrc/ties, and of limited or mixed mon-
archies. Of the latter class are Great Britain and
France.

44. In Great Britain, the power is lodged in the hands
of a king, nobles, and a body representing in some de-
gree the rights and interests of the great body of the
people. The nobility are persons who enjoy a rank above
the common people. They claim the highest civil hon-
ors and privileges, often by no other right than the right
of birth; and, with the archbishops and bishops, they con-

‘stitute the house of lords. The house of commoozs, the

representative branch of the legislature, consists of the
representatives of cities, boroughs and counties, and are
chosen by men who possess the property or qualiﬁcations
required by law. These two branches of thelegislature
are called the parliamem.

45. In France, the executive power belongs to the
king.. He is commander of the sea and land forces; he
declares war, and makes all appointments. The legisla-
tive power rests in the king, the chamber of peers, and
the chamber of ‘deputies. The king proposes the laws.
The peers.are nominated b the king; and their dignity
was formerly either grante for life, or made hereditary,
at hispleasnre. But since the revolution of 1830, the
hereditary quality of the French peerage has been abol-
ished. The deputies are elected by the electoral col-
leges; the ministers of state may be members of either
chamber.

46. (4.) A republic, or co-mmonwealt/t, the last form of
government which shall be here noticed, is a state in
which the sovereign power is lodged in representatives
elected by the the people. Such IS the government of the
United States. The democracies of Greece. are often
called republics. A democracy/, however, is a government
in which the people meet in one assembly, and enact and
execute the laws. But this can be done only in a very
small community. Our government is therefore a repre-
sentative republic, because the people, instead of enacting
laws in person, elect a small number to represent them.
But as political power is retained in the hands of the
people, our government may with some propriety be called
a democracy.

47. From the description here given of a mixed mon-
archy and a representative republic, these two forms of
government may appear in a considerable degree similar.
But though the king may have no greater power in
making laws than the president of the United States, he
obtains his power by hereditary right, or right by birth,
independent of the suffraiges of the people, and often
contrary to their wishes. So also with regard to the
higher branch of the legislature: its members hold their
oﬂices, either ‘by right of birth, or by appointment of the

king. And although thelower branch is elective, such
have been the qualiﬁcations required of the electors, as to
throw the legislative power virtually into t_he hands of the
more favored classes. . c L

48. In France, in a population of 32,000,000, there
were, in1830, about 215,000 electors; no person being
allowed to vote unless he possessed property on which
he paid 200 francs of direct taxes; nor to be elected a.
representative, unless his property were subject to a tax
of 500 francs.

49. Similar restrictions formerly existed in Great Brit-
ain, where the elective franchise was limited to the free»
holders. The land being owned by a few, and cultivated
by tenants, the election depended on the richest families.
Besides the clergy, who, (in 1822,) possessed about six
thousand estates, and the corporations, whose possessions
might be reckoned at an equal number, there were in
England but about 20,000 landholders, among a popula-
tion of 13,000,000. The English law which gives to the
eldest son all the real estate, -is itself sufficient to keep
together large masses of landed property. In 1786, there
were 250,000 land proprietors.

50. But this unjust distinction between the rich and

poor, has been in a great degree abolished in England.

By an act of reform passed in 1832, the elective franchise
was much extended; so that it is at present enjoyed to
nearly the same extent as in the United States. Such
has been the ‘progress of republican principles among
the governments of Europe, as to cause, in many of them,
important changes in favor of the rights of the people.
51. Some writers do not allow more than three regular
forms of government: the first, when the sovereign power
is lodged in an aggregate assembly, consisting of all the
members of a community, which is called a democracy;

the second, when it is lodged in a council of select mems

ference between mixed governments and representative republics?

CHAPTER V.

Of Sooererigntg/-wand of Political and ,Civil Powerrwiw
at Government.

54- BY sovereignty is meant supremacy, or supreme,
unlimited power. When applied to a state or nation, it
means only independence. A sovereign state isa state or
nation that possesses the right to make its own laws, and
the right to make war and treaties with other nations.
But the word sovereignty is also applied to the internal
government of a state. The sovereign power of a state
is that which is superior to all other power within the
state. Thus, in a despotism, sovereignty is said to reside
in the king, or supreme ruler, who is called the s0've'rc'ign.,
In a deniocraccy, where the people govern themselves, the
people are called sovereign. c

55._ It was anciently believed,» almost universally, that
sovereignty was derived by kings immediately from God;
and that, when a throne became vacant, the right of sove~
reignty returned to the original source, to be againpcon-
ferred on the immediate successor. It was held that, by
What means soever the throne was obtained, these were
the occasions on which God bestowed the sovereignty on
the prince. The more orthodox opinion now‘ is, that the
right. is hereditary; and that, on the death of a prince,
the right of sovereignty passes to his lawful heir. But
this opinion of the “divine right of kings,” has given
wa‘y,i,n a great measure, to the more rational doctrine,
that the right of ‘sovereignty is derived from the civil
compact, the people being considered the legitimate source
of all power.

56. Strictly speaking, however, it is in a state of alien»
lute despotism only, where all the powers of government
are united in a single person or aristocratic body, that

unlimited sovereignty, or supreme power, is to be found.
Where any degree of libertypis enjoyed, the powers of
government are delegated to distinct organs; and the sev»
eral functionaries are in some way held accountable for
the due exercise of -their powers. ,

57. In the English government, the legislature or
parliament has been considered as possessing ‘supreme
power, because legislation is supposed to be the greatest
act of superiority that can be exercised by one being over
another. It is deemed requisite to the very‘ essence of
law, that it be made by a supreme power. But it will
appear on examination, that such power is not possessed
by parliament. The members of the house of commons
are elective, and are accountable to the people, .at whose
will they hold their offices. And the power of the other
house, as well as the power of the king, in most of his
prerogatives, is held in check by the popular branch of
the legislature. ‘ p

58. By the constitution of the United States, the difé
ferent powers are entrusted to different organs, and are
duly defined and limited. Every ‘branch of the govern

ment is accountable to some tribunal. The legislature‘

and the executive are accountable to the people at their
elections. Executive ofﬁcers and judges are liable to
impeachment and removal. Nor have the people, from
whom all power is derived, retained to themselves that
absolute and unlimited sovereignty, which, it is declared,
resides somewhere in every government, and is alike in
all countries. And yet, limited as the powers of this
government are, they have been found competent to the
great object of all civil institutions, the happiness of the
people.

.59. A proper distribution of power, and a due distinc-
tienbetween the civil andpolitical laws in a government,
are of the ﬁrst importance. From the distinction made

36 rnmcrrnns or eovanrutr;n'r.' , Part I.

in a preceding chapter, between political and civil rights,
and liberty, it will be readily understood, that by political
laws are meant the laws of the constitution, by which a
state or body politic is organized and governed; that is,
the laws which govern those who are vested with the
power to make laws and administer the government.
“The laws of the constitution, the political laws,” as a
writer observes, “are tothose entrusted with the powers
of goveminent, what the laws made by the.g'overnm.ent
are to a court of judicature.” A judge in the discharge
of his duties, is bound by the civil law: so are legisla~
tures and other bodies, who are entrusted with the powers
of government, bound by the political law or constitution,
as the supreme law. ‘ « l

'60. In absolute or despotic governments, there are no
political laws binding on those who exercise the powers
of government. The ruler arrogates to himself all pow»
ers, political and civil. The laws he makes do not relate
to his own conduct; and he alters or repeals them at his
will. 'I‘hejpri.ncipal rule by which a ruler, in such a
government, is regulated in the exercise of political power,
are some customs or usages, which the people regard as
more sacred than the authority of the prince, and which
he cannot violate without exciting the indignation of his
subjects. Yet, as he is subject to no positive laws or
regulations, the people enjoy no political rights.

61. In a democracy, each citizen has an equal voice in
passing all laws, whether of a civil or political nature, as
well as in appointing those who administer the laws. The
consequence is, that the laws are liable to frequent altera-
time, according to the ﬂuctuations of popular passions
and prejudice. As all laws are enacted by the same body,
there is no ‘distinction of constitutional and unconstitutional
law: the last law on every subject is always.constitutional,
and it must be, so considered by every one in the civil
administration. The people under this form of govern-

ment are liable to suffer great evils. The majority often
oppress the minority with unjust laws, especially When.
measures areadopted in the violence of party spirit.

62. In mixed governments, also, legislative bodies possess
the civil as well as political powers of legislation. They
have the same power to make or alter a law that relates
to the constitution," as they have to make or alter a law
that relates to the civil state. Their laws cannot therefore
be adjudged unconstitutional. -

63. In a representative form of government, the ‘polit-
ical rights of the people, and the civil powers of the
government, are exercised separately by those to whom
they are severally reserved or delegated. The govern-
ment of the United States furnishes an example of the
superiority of thisform over any other. It is believed
that no other people enjoy equal security of civil liberties.
Their political power and liberty are greater than under
a mixed government; and though they are less than in a
democracy, they arenot so liable to -be affected by sudden.
alterations of the fundamental laws of the government.
The constitution effectually guards itself against frequent
or needless changes through popular excitement, which
are incident to a democracy, as will appear by a reference‘
to that article of the constitution which provides for its
amendment.

64. With equal effect does the constitution prevent that
confusion of powers which exists in both a democracy
and a mixed monarchy. In the ancient republics of
Greece and Rome, every freeman was a member of the
legislature,and gave his vote in the assembly of the peo-
ple. ‘ This blending the political with the civil power,
proved the source of great evils in those democracies.
Against these evils, that form of» government which has
been adopted by the people of the United States, provides
an effectual safeguard. The power of adopting and

the officers of the government, is exercised by the people
in their political capacity; While the civil ctdmim'sit7'atz'on
of the government is entrusted to their re-presentatives, and
others appointed for that purpose. a

65. The inconveniences that must attend the exercise of‘

the power of legislation by a body composed of the Whole
people, may be easily conceived. An assemblage so nus
memos, and consisting of men governed by so great a
variety of passions and interests, would be incapable of
discussing affairs ; disorder and confusion would prevail;
and measures would be adopted without that calm and
dispassionate deliberation which the public good requires,
and which may be had in a representative assembly. To
this is to be attributed that fluctuation of measures, and
that instability of government, for. which those ancient.
republics Were distinguished.

66. To remedy these and other evils incident to a pure
democracy, it has been proposed to limit the right of suf~
frage. None, it is urged, should be allowed to participate
in the government, Who do not possess a certain amount
of property, or such other qualiﬁcations as might be re—
quired, or as are not possessed by the people generally.
But such a restriction of this right would destroy that
equality which is essential to a. republic, and change the
government into a species of aristocracy.

67'. Happily, for the cause of free principles, the ob~
jectionswhich have hitherto been urged against popular
governments, have been removed, in a great measure, by
that improvement upon a democracy which has been car-
ried into the government of these United States. This
improvement consists principally in the separation of the
political and civil powers of government; and in the

division of the civil power into legislative, executive, and

in conﬁning each within its own appropriate sphere of
action. Theibeneﬁts of this system have been satisfacto~
rily tested by the people of the United States. This "form
of government is justly regarded as a model for other
nations, and its adoption constitutes an era in the history

CHAPTER I.
Discovery of America and Settlement of the Colonies.

68. A BRIEF history of the colonies, of their settlemen,
and political institutions, is here deemed useful, ‘especial
ly to young persons. A recital of the sacriﬁces which
were made to secure theiindependance of these states, can-
not fail to inspire youth with ‘sentiments of genuine patri-
otism; while a knowledge of the government of the colo-
nies, and of the changes effected in them from time to
time, will enable them the better to understand the nature
and objects of the constitution. ‘

69. IN 1492, America was discovered by Christopher
Columbus; an expedition having been ﬁtted out for that
purpose by the Spanish government, at his earnest s‘oli'ci-
tations. His discovery, however, was conﬁned to the
West Indies. The English were the first people that
discovered the continent of America. This discovery
was made in the year 1497, by Giovanni Cabot and his
son Sebastian, who were commissioned by Henry VII.
to sail in quest of new countries.

70. Of the thirteen colonies whose delegates signed
the Declaration of Independence, all but Georgia were
settled in the seventeenth century. A colony is a settle-t
ment of persons gone from a country to inhabit some
distant place, but who remain subject to the parent coun~
try. ‘With few exceptions, the colonists Were English-
men. The settlements were chieﬂy made at a timeof
great political excitement in the parent country, caused
by encroachments of the crown upon the liberties of the
people. Multitudes annually ﬂed hither to ﬁnd a refuge
from oppression. The attempt on the part of the govern-
ment, to enforce conformity to the established church.
also brought many to this country, where they might
enjoy freedom of conscience in matters of religion.

71. In 1606, two companies of merchants and others
were incorporated under the names of the London com-
pany, and the Plymouth company, with the exclusive
right of settling and trading within their respective limits,
In 1607, the London company sent to\, Virginia a colony
of 100 men, Which, in consequence of war with the
natives, scarcity of food, and disease, was reduced in a
few months to 38. In October, 1609, the number had
been increased by new colonists to 500; but a famine
reduced them in about six months to 60. In 1613, the
land which had before been held in common, was dis-
tributed to each individual.

72. The supreme government of the colonies, on their
ﬁrst establishment, was vested in a council which resided
in England, and was nominated by the king; the subor-
dinate jurisdiction, in a council which, was to reside in
America, also to be named by the king, and to act in
conformity to his instructions. This charter being found
inconvenient, a new one was granted by James, enlarging
the colony, abolishing thecouncil in Virginia, and vesting‘
the government in one residing in London.

73. In 1619, a great change was eﬁ'ected in the gov-
ernment of the colony. A general assembly, the ﬁrst
that was held in Virginia, was called by the governor.
‘Eleven boroughs sent representatives to the convention.
The supreme authority was divided between the governor,
a council of state appointed by the company in England,
and a general assembly elected by the people with the
power to enact laws.

'74. In 1622, 347 men, Women and children, were
massacred by the Indians; an Indian war followed, which
reduced the number of settlements from eighty to eight.
it may here be remarked, that this disaster, and the many
that followed, together with the settled hostility of the
;Indians which afterwards subsisted, were doubtless owing
he the imprudence of the ﬁrst settlers, rather than to the
lbad dis osition of the natives. T

75. n 1624, the displeasure of James having been
excited by the change that had been made in the govern-
ment of the colony, the charter was declared forfeit, and
the company dissolved. A charter is a writing that
grants privileges or rights to the subjects of a govern~
merit.

76. The Plymouth. company, which had the exclusive
right to trade and settle in North Virginia, did nothing
effectual. towards colonizing their territory. But in 1620,
a number of Puritans embarked on akvoyage with a
design of settlement on the Hudson. But by accident, as
some suppose, they were landed on Cape Cod, within the
limits of the Plymouth company: or, as others think, by
the treachery of the Dutch, who themselves contemplated
settling on the Hudson, they were, against their inten-
tion, compelled to land on the shores of Cape Cod. Pu-

established church, because they wished for a purer form

of discipline and worship; as many of the ancient forms
and ceremonies pf the Romish church were still contin-
ued.

77. Not having contemplated any plantation at this
place, they had not obtained anycharter from the compa-
ny. Destitute of any right to the soil, and without any
powers of government, on the 11th of November, before
they landed, they drew up and signed a compact, in which,
after acknowledging themselves to be subjects of the
crown of England, they declared as follows: “Having
undertaken, for the glory of God, and the advancement
of the christian faith, and the honor of our king and
country, a voyage to plant the ﬁrst colony in the northern
parts of Virginia, We do, by these presents, solemnly and
mutually, in the presence of God and of one another,
covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body
politic, for our better ordering and preservation, and
furtherance of the ends aforesaid; and by virtue hereof
do enact, constitute and frame such just and equal laws,
ordinances, acts, constitutions, and offices, from time to
time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for
the general good of the colony; unto which We promise
all due submission and obedience.” This was the earliest
American constitution, and was signed by 41 persons. It
was in substance a pure democracy.

78. The company, including women and children,
amounted to 101. They proceeded to examine the coast,
and ﬁnally determined to settle in a place called New
Plymouth. Exhausted by the fatigues of the sea, and
suffering from a want of suitable provisions and shelter,
nearly one half of their number died within four months.
after their landing. > They continued for ten years to
hold their goods and property in common, when they
obtained from the company a grant of the land which
they had before held only by occupancy. At this time
their number did not exceed three hundred. For many

years they continued a mere voluntary association, gov
erned by laws and magistrates formed. and chosen by
themselves, until they were incorporated with Massachu
setts, in 1692. ’ ’ D

79. In 1628, the Massachusetts colony was settled by
a company incorporated by royal charter, the land having
been previously purchased from the Plymouth company.
In 1630, the governmentlof the colony was transferred to
Massachusetts, by  vote of the company. A few years
later, the free-men adopted the plan of acting by delegates
or representatives, and the charter of a trading company
was converted into the constitution of a commonwealth.

This unauthorized assumption of power, as well as their

religious principles, rendered the Puritans obnoxious to
the court party at home, and led the Plymouth company
to resign their charter to the king; and Massachusetts,
like Virginia, was taken into royal hands. But such was
the disturbed state of England, that these distant and in-
signiﬁcant colonies attracted little notice, and were left
to grow up in habits of self-government, their numbers at
the same time increasing by emigrations of such as were
unsuccessful in the civil strifes at home. The persecuted
Puritans ﬂed to New England; the Catholics to Mary-
land‘; and the defeated royalists to Virginia.

80. New York was settled by the Dutch in 1614, and
was held by them ﬁfty years. It was, however, claimed
by England, having been discovered by Henry Hudson,
in 1608, who entered the bay of New York, and sailed
up the river to latitude 43 -degrees north. He did not
attempt to land and form a settlement, contenting himself

agvith claiming the country for his sovereign, James 1., by

right of discovery. The English asserted that Hudson
was employed by their government, and that he sold the
country to the Dutch Without‘ authority. The Dutch
maintained that he was in the service of the Dutch East

was occupied by the English; and the territory now
comprising New York, New J ersey, Pennsylvania, Dela-
ware, and a part of Connecticut, was granted by Charles
II. to his brother, th.e Duke of York.

81. New Jersey was settled by the Dutch, in 1624,
and occu pied by the English in 1664. New Hampshire
was first settled in 1623, at Andover and Portsmouth..

elaware was settled by the Dutch in 1627, and occupied
by the English in 1654. Some Swedes settled here in
1638, but they were conquered by the Dutch, and most of
them left the country. Maine was settled in 1630, and
united with Massachusetts in 1677. Maryland was set-
tled in 1633, and was the ﬁrst colony that was governed
directly as a province of the British empire. Its founder
was Sir George Calvert, a Roman Catholic nobleman.
He obtained a grant of the lands from Charles I. New
Haven, settled in 1637, was united with Connecticut in
1682. Connecticut was settled from Massachusetts in
1632.

Forms of ' Government-——-Ccmses of the Revolution--~Colt'~
mencement of llostilities.

82. Or the forms of government which prevailed in
the colonies, there were three—---the charter, the royal, and
the proprietary governments. The charter governments
were those of New England. The people were‘entitle’d~
to the privileges of natural born subjects. ‘ They elected
their own governors and legislative assemblies, and e’stab-

ﬁshed courts of justice, and in some points even exceeded
thepowers conferred by the charters. The only limita-
tion to their legislative power was, that their laws should
not be contrary to those of England. The crown claimed
the right to revoke these charters; but the colonists main~
tained that they were solemn compacts and that they
could not be revoked without cause. The charters were
sometimes declared. forfeited, or forcibly taken away; and
the disputes to which this question gave rise, between the
mother country and the charter governments, were one of
the causes of the revolution.

, 83. The royal governments were those of Virginia,
New Yorl»:,-and, at a later period, the Carolinas, (1728,)
and the Jerseys, (1702) In these colonies, the governor
and council were appointed by -the crown, and the repre-
sentatives to the colonial assemblies were chosen by the
colonists. The governor obeyed the instructions of the
crown, and had a negative power on the proceedings of
the legislature, which was composed of thecouncil and
assemblies. The judges and most of the ofﬁcers were
also appointed by the king, although, in many cases, paid
by the colony. The arbitrary acts of the governors, and
the royal claim to an abs Jlute veto on the acts of the
assemblies, became sources of much discontent, as the
exercise of these powers was virtually taking from the
people the right to participate in the government.

84. The pvroprietazry governments were those of Mn-
ryland, Pennsylvania, and, at ﬁrst, those of the Carolinas
and. the Jerseys. These colonies were in the hands of

roprietors or individuals, to whom grants of land had
ﬁeenixiade by the crown, with authority to establish civil
governments and make laws, under certain restrictions,
in favor of the crown. The proprietors had power to
repeal or negativethe acts of the assemblies;.. and the
exercise of this power became a source of continual quar-
rels between the people and the proprietors. In 1719.

the people of Carolina took the government into their
own hands. The governor, council and assembly, were
all elected by the people. A declaration of independence
Was published, setting forth the-causes of their renuncia~
tion of the former government, and signed by all the
members of the new government. The oldest laws of
the Virginia assembly, (1624,) comprise a declaration
definingthe power of the governor and the assembly, and
asserting the privileges of the people in regard to. taxes

and personal services. 

85. At an early period in the existence of the New
England colonies, (1643,) a confederation was formed
between them for mutual offence and clefence, leaving to
each colony its own government, while the common afliairs
of the confederacy were managed by a congress, consisting
of two commissioners from each colony.

86. As early as the seventeenth century, the question
of taxation became a subject of common interest in the
colonies. The colonists disputed the right of I parliament
to tax the colonies. It was believed that the power of the
British government extended only to the regulation of
trade. Having surmounted the hardships and diﬂiculties
which attended their ﬁrst establishment, and having made
considerable advances in commerce and manufactures,
the freedom of commerce which they had so long enjoyed
began to be interrupted. Their trade was restricted by
the imposition of unjust taxes for the benefit of the mother
country.

87. By the act of 1651, none but British or colonial
vessels were allowed to participate in the export and
import trade. Another act, passed in 1660, enactedthat
certain articles should not be exported directly from the
colonies to any foreign country; thus compelling the
colonists to sell their produce in no other than British
markets. Itwas next provided, (in 1663,) that they
should buy such foreign articles as they ‘needed entirely

of the merchants and manufacturers of England. Duties
were even imposed on certain colonial products transport
ted from one colony to another.

88. All attempts to manufacture such articles as the
mother country could provide, were discouraged. In
1699, it was enacted, that no wool, yarn, or woollen mam
ufactures should be exported from the American colonies;
and, in 1750, every slitting or rolling mill, plati ig forge
to work with a tilt hammer, or other machinery, was
declared to be a common nuisance, which the governors
were directed to cause to be abated. It is true, however,
that many of these and similar acts of parliament, were
openly disobeyed or secretly evaded.

89. Such were some of the features of the policy of
the mother country, and the causes of irritation and dis-
content in the colonies. Many of the acts for regulating
the trade of the colonies, had been unwillingly submitted
to, as violations or their rights, or secretly evaded or
openly disregarded, for many years, when measures Were
at lengt.h taken by the ministry, not only to enforce such
acts, but to raise a revenue in America by internal taxa«
tion.

90. In 1765, the obnoxious stamp act was passed, by
which obligations in Writing in daily use were to be null
and void, unless they were executed on a paper or parch-
merit stamped with a speciﬁc duty. Newspapers, alma-
nacs and pamphlets, printed in America, were to be made
to contribute to the British treasury. About the same
time, a bill was brought in authorizing the quartering of
troops in the colonies.

91. As might have been expected, the colonists were
unwilling to submit to these acts and measures; and a

eneral congress, the first of the kind, was held at New
§’ork,_which adopted a declaration of rights and grieve

found! In this state of affairs, the act was repealed,
(March, 1766.) At the same time, by a declaratory act,
parliament asserted the right to bind the colonies in all
cases whatsoever. In 1767', a bill was passed imposing
a duty on glass, paper, paints and tea, imported into the
colonies; and troops were quartered in Boston to enforce
obedience.

93. But combinations having been formed by the
Americans against the importation of those articles, the
act was repealed, March, 1770, the duty on tea alone
being continued. Accordingly the colonists renounced
the use of that article, or obtained it from foreign coun-
tries; in consequence of which an act Was passed in 1773,
allowing a drawback on tea exported to America, for the
purpose of rendering it cheaper, and inducing the Amer-
icans to submit to the small duty imposed upon it. Large
gshiprnents-of tea were accordingly made; but in New
York and Philadelphia the vessels were not allowed to
land their cargoes; in Charleston it was stored, but not
permitted to be oﬂered for sale; and in Boston, after sev-
eral unsuccessful attempts to prevent its being landed, a
party of men, disguised as Indians, boarded the tea ships,
and threw the tea overboard. This occurred December
15, 1773.    

94. In the following spring, by an act of parliament,
called .the Boston port bill, passed March, 17, 1774, the
port of Boston was closed, and the landing and shipping‘
of goods were ordered to be discontinued. The custom
house and trade, and the session of the court, were remo-
ved to Salem, and the charter altered, taking the whole

appointment of the important officers in the crown. It
was also enacted, that a person indicted for a capital.
oﬁence, committed in aiding the magistrates, might be
sent to Great Britain for trial. _

95. In the same year, General Gage, the British com-
mander—in-chief, and governor of Massachusetts, arrived
in Boston to enforce the Bostonians into a compliance
with the oppressive acts of parliament. In this crisis,
the other colonies made common cause with Massachu-
setts. Deputies from most of the colonies met in congress
at Philadelphia, September 5, 1774. Congress published
a declaration of rights, protesting against the right of
Great Britain to tax the colonies, or to interfere in their
internal policy; with a statement of grievances, declaring
the late acts of parliament to he violations of the rights.
of the colonists.

96. They next proceeded to interrupt all commercial
intercourse With Great Britain, pledging themselves not
to import or use British goods, till the acts complained of
should be repealed. Addresses, petitions and remonstran—
ces were resorted to, but all to no effect. Instead of
changing its policy, ,,.the British government imposed
additional restrictions upon the trade of the colonies.
Preparations now began to be made for resistance. Gun-
powder was manufactured, the militia was trained, and
military stores were collected.

97. In April, 1775, a detachment of troops was sent to
destroy the military stores collected at Concord. At
Lexington, the militia were collected to oppose the incnr~
sion of the British forces. They were fired upon by the
British troops, and eight men were killed. After having
proceeded to Concord, and destroyed a few military
stores, the troops returned, and were pursued by the
Americans to Boston. Here was spilled the first “blood

in the war which severed the American colonies from
Great Britain.

98. In May, 1775, a second congress met from all the
states, and immediately determined to organize an army;
and Washington was appointed, June 15, commander-im
chief of the colonial forces. Congress authorized the
emission of two millions of dollars in bills of credit, for
the redemption of which the colonies were pledged; and
an appointment was made of the quota to be paid by each
colony of the bills emitted. A general post office was
established, and rules were framed for the government of
the army. Congress also published a solemn declaration
of the causes of taking up arms, an address to the king,
entreating a change of measures, and an address to the
people of Great Britain, requesting their aid, and admon—
ishing them of the threatening evils of a separation.

99. At the next meeting of the same congress, rules
were adopted for the regulation of the navy; a further
emission of bills was authorized; and a treasury depart-
ment was established. A general system of measures
for resistance was now adopted throughout the colonies.
General Washington had been at Cambridge at the head
of an army, whose term of service expired with the year,
1775, without ammunition, and but imperfectly supplied
with arms. ‘

100. B the beginning of March, 1776, 14,000 regular
troops ha been enlisted, and the British were obliged to
evacuate Boston, March 13. On the 10th of June, a
committee was appointed by congress to prepare a decla-
ration, “that these colonies are, and of right ought to be,
free and independent states.” On the 11th of June, a
committee was appointed to prepare the form of aconfed-
eration between the colonies. On the 2d day of July,
congress adopted the resolution of independence; and on
the 4th of July, they adopted the Declaration of Inde-
pendence.

101. THE American revolution may properlybe said
to have been complete on th.e adoption of the Declaration
of Independence; but it still remained to be defended by
arms. The military operations which closed the year,
were, the defeat of the Americans on Long Island, August
27; the captureiof New York by the British forces under
lord Howe, September 15’; the battle of White Plains,
October 28; and the battle of Trenton, December 26, in
which general VVashington gained a victory over the
British army, capturing a large body of Hessians who
were cantrrned at Trenton; and soon after, January 3,
1777, the battle of Trenton, in which he gained another
decisive victory over the British troops.

102. The campaign of 1777 was more favorable than
that of the preceding year. Philadelphia had been taken
by the British, September ‘27, and the Americans had
been defeated on the Brandywine, September 11; also at
(f-‘rerxnantown, October 4; but the northern army were to
a considerable degree successful. General Burgoyne,
who conimanded the British northern army, had taken
possession of Ticonderoga ;‘" but, While pushing his suc~
cesses southward, his progress was arrested at Saratoga,
by the militia which had assembled there from various
parts of New Englanh for that purpose. These, with
the regular troops, formed a respectable army, and were
commanded by general Gates. After two severe actions,
Burgoyne, ﬁnding himself enclosed with brave troops,
surrendered to the Americans his entire army of seven

thousand men, on the 17th of October. Thus was cut
off the communication which had been attempted to be
kept up between New York and Canada.

103. When the intelligence of this reached Europe,
the French government entered into treaties of amity and
commerce with the United States, thus recognizing their
existence as an independent nation. When the British
ministry were informed that this treaty was on foot, they
despatched commissioners to America to effect a recon-
ciliation. But their offers were not accepted.

104. In the‘ spring, a French ﬂeet arrived, having on
board about 5000 French troops, which had been sent to
assist America. In June, the British army left Philadel-

phia, with the intention of concentrating their forces at

New York; VVhile on their march, they were attacked
by general Vtfashington at Monmouth, on the 28th of
June, and repulsed with great loss.

105. Congress had hitherto consisted of delegates from
thirteen independent states, with little more authority than
that of advising the states to adopt certain measures.
Money could not be raised without the consent of the
states; which were held together by force of circum-
stances, congress having no povver to enforce obedience.
But during the heat of the revolutionary contest, men
were little disposed to discuss or scrutinize such. subjects;
and the people conﬁded in‘ the wisdom of congress, and
yielded to their authority.

106. But in order to give stability to the union, and to
deﬁne more precisely the nature of the federal compact,
and the powers of congress, the articles of confederation
were agreed on by congress, November 15, 1777, and
submitted to the state legislatures for ratiﬁcation. The
articles bear date July 6, 1778: they were ratiﬁed the
same year by all the states except Delaware and Mary-

October of this year? 103. What was done by the governments

land; by the former, in 1779, and by the latter, the ﬁrst
of March, 1781; being nearly five years after the ﬁrst
action on the subject by congress: By these articles, the
exclusive control of our foreign ‘relations, the right to
declare war and make peace, and the right to make requi-
sitions of men and money, were conﬁded to congress.

107. But the confederation was in many respects de-
tective. It did not possess the power to carry its own:
constitutional measures into eﬁect; for like all mere con-
federations, the decrees of the federal government operated
on the states in their independent capacity, and not upon
individual citizens. But perhaps the greatest defect was
the want of power to provide for defraying the expenses
of the government. Congress’ had power “to ascertain
the sums necessary to be raised for the service of the
United States ;” and to apportion the quota to each state:
but as the power was reserved to the states to lay the taxes,
and prescribe the time and manner of payment; it de-
pended upon the good will of each of the legislatures of
the thirteen independent states whether, any measure of
defence could be carried into operation. And, when dan-
ger from abroad was past, this confederacy was found to
be incompetentto govern the country.

108. In the same year Georgia was invaded, and Sa-
vannah, its capital was taken, by the British; and in the
year following, (1779,) the south became the principal
theatre of war. Depredations to " a great extent were
committed on the coasts,‘ and a partisan warfare was car-
ried on in the interior ; but with no decisive results. In
1780, May 12, Charleston was taken by the British; and
on the 19th of October, 1781, the contest was ended by
the surrender of Cornwallis, at Yorktown, to the com»
bined American and French forces under Washington
and Rochambeau.

109. In the following year, a treaty was concluded
between Holland and the United States; and after long
protracted negotiations, a treaty of peace was signed Sep-
tember $23, 1783, by which Great Britain acknowledged
the independence of the United States of America.

110. Honorably as the war resulted to the Americans,
it was attended with great sacriﬁces. VVithout arms or
pecuniary resources, congress was obliged to have re-
course to a paper medium. During the ﬁrst ﬁve years
of the war, three hundred millions of dollars, in bills of‘
credit, had been emitted; and no provisions.\vere made
for redeeming them, the states neglecting, or but partially
complying with, the requisitions of congress. In 1780,
these bills had depreciated to such a degree as to cease to
circulate; the treasury was empty, the army unpaid,
without clothing, and sometimes without food.

111.’ At this critical period, the French government
made a grant of six millions of livres by way of subsidy,
and a further sum by way of loan; and afterwards a loan
of ten millions of livres was obtained from Holland.
The whole amount of loans and grants made to the
United States by France and Holland, was forty three
millions of livres, or nearly ten millions of dollars. These
supplies, with a new organization of the ﬁnance depart-
ment, and the establishment of a national bank, at a later
period, contributed to relieve the pressure. When peace
took place, the public debt amounted to $42,000,000, on
which congr-ess was unable to pay even the interest. The
requisitions and regulations of that body were but little
regarded by the states, and the country was fast approach-
ing a state of anarchy. t

112. A change in the government now became neces-
sary as the only means likely to preserve the union; and,

PART THIRD.

OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

CHAPTER I.
Of the Nature and Objects of the Union.

113. As has been before observed, the confederation
which was adopted by congress, in 1777, was a league
or treaty of alliance between sovereign and independent
states. Although it was declared to be a ﬁrm league of
friendship, yet i_ts binding force depended onthe good
faith of each of the states, each party being the sole in-
terpreter of the meaning of tie contract, and the sole
judge of its obligations; so that, in case of a violation of
the contract by either of the parties, the ultimate remedy
would have been a resort to the law of force, which is
admitted by the law of nations to be the only ﬁnal arbiter
betvreen sovereign states. The people" were not citizens
of the United States, but of their respective states; and
they owed obedience to their respective state governments
only. L A’

114. Under the confederation, the union was merely a
federal, not a national, union; and the government was
familiarly denominated, the federal government. The

was the character of the government? What is the meaning of

58 GOVERNMENT or THE U“. srnres. Part III.

‘word fecleml is derived from the Latin word fcrdus, sig-
nifying a league or covenant. This government was
destitute of executive and judicial powers, which are no
less necessary in giving to a government a national char-
acter, than in forming an efficient government. It con-
sisted only of a legislative power, the power of enacting
laws: it wanted an executive power to execute the laws,
and a judicial power to judge of, to expound, and to apply
them.

115. Congress had no power of raising a revenue or
of collecting taxes. Congress had the power of making
treaties, but not the power of fulﬁlling them-——th_at rested
with the several states. Congress had the power of de-
claring war, but had not the means of maintaining a war.
It had the power merely to ascertain the sum required
for the public service, and to apportion it according to a
prescribed rule among the several states, with a request
that they should raise, and pay over to the general treas-
ury, the amount of their respective quotas ; but as an
independent sovereign, each might choose or refuse, and
sometimes did refuse, to comply with the requisition.
Congress was authorized to borrow money, and to emit
bills of credit, but had not the command of funds to pay
the one, or to redeem the other. Nothing but the pres-
sure of war, and the patriotic zeal of the citizens in a
common cause, in which so much was at stake, could
keep the country united. ~

116. When peace was restored, the imperfections of
this system of government were fully developed. It was
these imperfections, and the evils resulting from them,
that led to the formation and- adoption of a new and more
effective system of national government, the nature and
powers of which are brieﬂy expressed in the preamble:

“We, the people of these United States”--—words. con-

’ veying the idea of nationality—-——“ in order to form a more

perfect union/’-intimating the former to have been. but a

ferteml? 115. Of What necessary powers was congress destitute?
116. What are the nature and objects of the union, under the

partial and imperfect union--“ to establish justice, insure
domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence,
promote the general Welfare, and secure the blessings of
liberty to ourselves and our posterity”—--objects to which
the confederation had proved incompetent—--“ do ordain
and establish this constitution for the United States of
America.”

117. But, although there can be little difference of
opinion as to the objects of the constitution, the nature of
this instrument is very differently interpreted by diﬁerent
individuals. It has been heldto be, (1.) a contract between,
sovereign and independent states, to establish and maintain
a government for the common good of the states; (2.) a
contract between each state and all the other states, for the
same purpose; each state reserving to itself the right of
judging of the meaning of the contract, and whether it
has been kept or broken; (3.) a contract between each
citizen and all other citizens of the United States, to
establish and maintain a government for the good of the
whole, with limited and deﬁned powers; providing that all
powers not expressly given, nor necessarily ﬂowing from
those which are so given, are reserved to the states or to‘
the people; and that ‘the authority of interpreting the
meaning of the contract, or of expounding the powers of
the government, instead of belonging to the statesfresides
in the government itself.

118. VVithout presuming to decide which of these
opinions is correct, it may be proper to state, that, in this
latter sense, the constitution is understood by the supreme
court of the United States, which, in the last resort, is to
expound the constitution, and the laws made under its

authority. It is argued in favor of this opinion, that in,

adopting the constitution, the people of the several states,
by their representatives in the state conventions,‘ acted
separately for themselves, not in the character of that
sovereignty which they had entrusted to their respective
state governments. And as the constitution was ratiﬁed

by the people of each state, in concurrence with the peo-
ple of all the states, it thus become a mutual compact
between all, binding upon all, and upon their respective
state governments.

119. A similar view of this subject was taken by the
president of the United States, in his proclamationof
December, 1832, occasioned by the hostile attitude assum-
ed by the state of South Carolina against the general

government; that state having threatened to resist the

execution of a law of congress which she declared to be
unconstitutional, and claimed for herself, as an indepen-
dent state, the right to judge of the constitutionality of the
law, as well ‘as the right to secede from the union. These
rights, it was asserted, had been reserved to the states,
and had never been surrendered to the general govern-
ment. The opinions expressed in the proclamation
referred to, were, at that time, approved by a large ma-
jority of the people of the union. A few short extracts
from that document are here given:

“ The people of the United States formed the constitu-
tion, acting through the state legislatures in making the
compact, to meet and discuss its provisions, and acting in
separate conventions when they ratiﬁed those provisions;
but the terms’ used in its construction, show it to be a
government in which the -people of all the states collec-

tively are represented. We are one people in the choice V

of the president and vice president. Here the states have
no other agency than to direct the mode in which the
votes shall be given. The people, then,,and not the states,
are representedin the executive branch.

“ The constitution of the United States, then, forms a
government, not a league; and, whether it be formed by
compact between the states, or in any other manner, its
character is the same. It is a government in which all
the people are represented, which operates directly on the
people individually, not upon the states: they retained all

are given in support of this last opinion‘! 119. What further au—
rhority is here cited, in corroboration of this opinion? What are
some of the reasons given in favor of it? 120. What spirit must

the power they did not grant. But each state having
expressly parted with so many powers as to constitute,
jointly with the other states, a single nation, cannot from

that period possess any right to secede, because such

secession does not break a league, but destroys the unity
of a nation.” a ~

120. The most able men have difiered Widely on this
subject; and this diversity of opinion will probably con-
tinue to exist. These different views of the national
compact are therefore given to lead the mind to inquire
into the nature of the union, rather than to excite a spirit
of controversy, which should always be discouraged.
The people of the United States are indebted for the
blessings enjoyed under their admirable system of gov-

ernment, to that spirit of compromise and mutual conces- ’

sion, which prevailed so universally among the members
of the body that framed the constitution. It is indeed
remarkable, that an assembly of men from so wide a ter-
ritory, entertaining views, and representing interests, so
varied and opposite, should have agreed on a form of
government which should receive the assent of so large
a majority of the people. And it is more -remarkable
still, that any system, adopted under these circumstances,
should have been found, on an experiment of almost half
a century, so fully competent to'all the purposes for which
it was intended. May the same spirit of forbearance and
good will which governed those who framed and adopted

have prevailed among the framers of the constitution? Has the
constitution thus far answered its intended purpose’! 121. In what

CHAPTER II.
Of the Legislative Power.-«House of ’Representatéves..

121. ALL legislative powers granted in the constitution,
are vested in a congress of the United States, which
‘consists of a senate and house of representatives. The
propriety of dividing the legislature into two co-ordinate

branches, is obvious. It was intended, by this division,

to guard against the evil consequences of hasty action by
a single legislative body. The proceedings of some of
the state legislatures, consisting of a single house, as well
.as‘the proceedings of congress under the confederation,
had furnished examples of the ill effects of precipitate
legislation. A. hasty decision is not likely to be made,
when a measure is liable to be arrested in its progress,
and to be subjected to the critical revision of another
body, in which it must pass through the same forms of

‘deliberation before it become a law.‘

122. But there was another reason for this division of
the national legislature. In the new constitution were
combined the national and federative principles. It was
proper that, when a people are incorporated into one
nation, every district or’ territorial subdivision should
have a proportional share in the government; and it was

equally proper that each of the several members of the

eenfederacy should have, in some respect, an equal voice
in the public councils. 
123. The house of representatives is composed of

members chosen every second year, by the people of the‘

several states. By limiting the term of of-lice of a repre-
sentative to two years, it was intended to secure a faithful
and just representation of the interests of the people in
the national councils. For, should a representative prove

to be incompetent, or unfaithful to his trust, he may at
the end of two years he removed, and his place ﬁlled by
another. Besides, the hope of a reelection, should his
conduct meet the approbation of his constituents, and the
fear of being displaced, should he forfeit their conﬁdence,
have a tendency to ensure a faithful performance of . his
duties. But if the elections were still more frequent, and
the term of a representative were limited to a single year’,
his increased dependence on the popular favor, would

‘probably diminish his regard for the general good.

124. Any person qualiﬁed to vote for a representative
in the lowest or most numerous branch of the legislature
of the state in which he resides, is entitled. to vote for a.
representative in congress. But the qualiﬁcations of the
electors, being established by the constitutions of the aev-«
eral states, are not uniform. In some states, the posses-
sion of a certain amount and description of property, is
made a qualiﬁcation. Colored persons are not allowed
to vote in any state, excepting a few, in which the prop-
erty qualiﬁcation is required. In amajority of the states,
however, all free white citizens, of the age of twenty—one

years or upwards, having resided for a certain period of J

time in the state, and paid taxes thereto, are entitled to
vote for representatives in the most numerous branch of
the state legislature.

125. No person may be a representative unless he has
attained to the age of twenty ﬁve years, and been seven
years a citizen of the United States ;nor unless he be an
inhabitant of the state in which he is chosen. This pro:
vision, as to age a.nd term of citizenship, is intended to

‘prevent the election of men who have not had time to-
acquire that knowledge and experience, which are essen-

tial to constitute a useful and efﬁcient representative; and,
unless he be an inhabitant of the state in which he is
chosen, he cannot be presumed to understand theinterests
he is to represent.

126. Representatives and direct taxes are apportioned
among the several states, according to their respective
numbers, which are determined by adding to the whole
number of free persons, (including those bound to service
for a term of years, and excluding Indians not taxed,)
three ﬁfths of all other persons. By this modeof ap-
portionment, the free citizens of the slaveholding states
have a greater number of representatives than an equal
number of white persons in the other states. For instance,
suppose a state to contain 500,000 free persons, and 300,-
000 slaves: the addition of three ﬁfths, (180,000,)»of
the numberof slaves, to the number of free persons,
makes 680,000 ; according to which number representa-
tivesare apportioned. But as representation and taxation
go together, it was thought the free states had no just
cause to complain of unequal representation, as the slave
states would be liable to greater direct taxes, in proportion
to their free population, than the free states. Direct na~
tional taxes, however, have seldom been. laid, and proba~“
hly they will not again be resorted to.

127. The enumeration of the people is made every ten
years, in such manner as the state legislatures direct.
Representatives are at present apportioned according to
the census of 1830. Census, among the Romans, was
used to signify the valuation of a man’s estate, and the
registering of himself, his age, his family and his servants.
As used in the United States, it usually means only the
enumeration of the people. 0

128. The number of representatives may not exceed
one for every 30,000 inhabitants. A very numerous
legislative body cannot act with the same degree of con-
venience and despatch asa smaller assembly. Hence
the propriety of this constitutional provision. To prevent
the house of representatives from becoming too large‘,
eengress has found it necessary, from time to time, as the
population of the states increased, to lessenthe ratio} of

an act of congress, every territory belonging to the Um-
ted States, in which a government is established, has the
right of sending a delegate to congress.“ ‘ Such delegate
is entitled to a seat, with the right of debating, but not of
voting.

129;. The distribution and location of the irepresenot?;a~

légitslature. ’ Each state is divided into ‘ a onetnber’ of

CHAPTER III.
Of the Senate of the ‘Umlted States.

132. THE senate of the United States is composed of
two ,senators,frorn each state, chosen by the legislature
thereof. Our government, as has been remarked, partalces
of the vnotiponal and federative character, combining, the

rinciples, of p7‘op07't7Ionctl a1‘ld~6q’Z1/(Ll representation. , The
house of representatives is constituted uponthe former
principle, the .numbe1f of its members from each state
being, in proportion to its population ; Whileain the.sena_te
each state is pcgztnllg represented, Besides ‘the reasons
§tQted,l1; a preceding chapter, ‘for institutingea senate, it is
said‘ to be the result of a compromise between the large
and the small states; the latter consenting. to be _represen-
t,ediin,one branch of the legislature, in preoportion to the
Igntnber, of inhabitants in each, on condition  being
allowed an equal representation in the other branch,

J33. Theusnal mode of choosing senators is by joint
vane: that is, the members of ‘both branches of the state
legislature, meet together, and vote numerically. 

«ther mode is by a concurrent vote, each house voting

separately, and a concurrence in its choice being required

 of: the house chosen‘! Of what has it the sole power? What

by the other house.  the latter-~mod.e is not common.
In cases of disagreement between the ‘V two houses, the
election of senators by a concurrent vote is often attended
with great diﬂiculitjm, for solong aseach ‘house adheres
to. its decision, no election can be pieffected. ‘As the con-
stitution does not »prescribe the manner in which the ap-
pointment shall be made, there is much uncertainty as to
1ts true construction in this particular.  
134. Senators are elected for six years. Political fac-
tions and popular excitements will arise in every cotnmu~
nity; and their tendency is to produce ﬂuctuatiom and

‘instability in the public co'uncils.t Sudden changes in

public J feeling, are usually followed by c.orrespon_din.g
,changes in legislative bodies of short duration. As,muc.h
of the party feeling that prevails among the electors, is
often carried byithe representative into the legislative
hall; frequent alterations of the laws are to beie-x ected ;
and these changes are sometimes attended wit great
mischiefs to the community. It Was deemed» requ_isite,
therefore, that .a body resting on a more durable» basis,
should» be placed as a ,c.l1"ecl; upon the more popular
_branch_of the legislature. A longer term of «iofﬁce was
r.equi.r~e_d,« as the means most likely to give independence
and stability tothe senate. i

135.. The senate is divided into three » classes. so that
the term of one thirdof the members expires every.asec-
ond year. This division and classiﬁcation of the senate,
by which the seats of one third only of its members are
f-vacatedtevery year, are calculateid to secure stability to
the administration of the government‘, and to -retainoa

large_ «portion of experienced members, acquea.intedeg;vifh~

the next meeting of the legislature, which shall then ﬁll
such vacancies. ' s ‘

137.‘ The executive of a state may ﬁll a vacancy that
happens during the recess of the legislature of such state;
but he cannot make the appointment constitutionally until
the vacancy shall have actually occurred. So it was
decided by the senate, I in 1825. Mr. Lanman was a
senator of the United States from the state of Connecti~
cut. His term of -service expired on the third of March.
The governor of that state, having been previously noti-
fied by the president of the United States, that the senate
would be convened on the fourth of March, accordingly
made the appointment in February, the legislature not
being in session: Upon these facts, the question was
raised as to the constitutionality of the appointment, and
the senate decided, 23 to 18, that, as the appointment had
been made before the vacancy had occurred, Mr. Lanman
was not entitled to a seat.

A 138. No person may be a senator, unless he has attain-
ed to the age of thirty years, and been nine years a citizen
of the United States, nor unless he be an inhabitant of the
state for which he shall be chosen. The superior Weight
and delicacy of the trusts conﬁded to the senate, seemed
to require greater age, and longer citizenship, as qualiﬁ~
cations for a senator, than for a representative. Men
elected to so responsible an oﬂice, should be of sufﬁcient
age to have acquired a thorough knowledge of the affairs
of the nation; and a period of citizenship is required
«ssu«fﬁ"ci~ent' to form an attachment to the principles of our
gevermnent.

of the president of the senate, and of the speaker of
the house i of representatives,‘ to preside‘ over, and

be taken, are put to the house by the presiding oﬁicer;
and he also decides all questions of order that may arise
in the house over which he presides.

They are the following: 1st, a cizaplctivz, who performs
divine service. The principal business “of achaplain in
a legislative body in this country is, to offer prayers before
the business of the day is commenced. T e salary of a
chaplain to congress is $500 a year. ‘2d, the secretary of

of his knowledge and ability. They are required to give
bonds, in the penal sum of $20,000,sfor the faithful ap-
plication of all the funds of their respective housesthat
shall come into their hands ; which must be deposited in
one of the banks in the District of Columbia, and may
be paid out only by a draft on the bank in which the
money is deposited. It is also their duty to furnish their
respective houses with the necessary stationary; which
is done by advertising, after the adjournment of each
congress, in two newspapers printed A in the District of
Columbia, for proposals for supplying the succeeding
congress with stationary. The proposal of the lowest
bidder is accepted, who is required to give security for the
fulfilment of his contract. And the said secretary and
clerk are required to lay before the two houses, at the
commencement of each session, a detailed statement of
the items of the expenditure, and manner in which the

for trial’ by impeachment, was rendered necessary for the
punishment -of offences that’ could not be tried before

ted  pe1'sQns inpnblic oﬂices, and consist in misconduct
and ,rnal4adnrinistration. Should a imagistrate recpeive
money for giving ‘an’ erroneous decision, he‘would‘ be
liable to impeachment. So also the president, or other
public officer, would, for m”al-‘conduict,Ahe subject to im-

been made in one house which are not agreed to in the

«l265.yThe provision ‘givingto the president power to

wise ealledgthe 1.-eto power, was not adopted without much

discussion. It was opposed, on the ground that the action
“of congress upon any subject ought to be regarded as the
act of the people, and must‘ be presumed to be ther-.xpres~
sion of their Will; and that, with this power, a single
individual might defeat the’ represented will of amajority
of thepeople. On the other hand, it was believed to be
improbable that a president would ever so far forget his
responsibility to the people, as to abuse this power. This
power was meant to affor-d additional security against the
passage of improper laws through want of due reflection;
but it was thought necessary chieﬂy to defend the execu-
tive department against usurpation by the-legislative power.

. Election-’~Qt1;a’>l7;ﬁcaiions.,

167. THE executive power is vested in a president of the
United States of ‘America. The object of the executive
department  the execution of the laws; and to ensure
promptitude, decision and force, in the administ1'.ation of
this department, the executive authority is limited to a
single person. Experience had convinced the framers ef
the‘ constitution of the iriefﬁciency and ‘Weakness of a
compound executive. » The project of executive councils
had"- been tried, and abandoned, and single executives
were created.’ Unity increases not only the eﬂicacy, but
the responsibility of the executive power. ‘As every act
can be traced and brought home upon the pro9per« agent,
therewill be less temptation to depart from duty, and
greater solicitude for ‘reputation, than when “thereare
<partners—t‘oo share the public censure, or‘ to divide the pub-
iic approbation. i

168. rWhen: a law has been duly made and promuigav
ted, it is -the dutyof the executive ofﬁcerto ‘see that ithe
faithfully ‘executed. It is not for him to deliberate and
‘decide ‘upon the wisdom or expediency of ‘a law, after it
has passed through all the forms of deliberation prescri-
shed in the constitution. It shoultl then receive prompt
«obedience, until repealed by the legislature, or pronounced
by the i judicial department to be repugnant to the 'eonsti~
tution. ‘ i

president areelected, shall, in all cases, commence on the
fourth day of March,’ next succeeding the day on which
the votes of the electors shall have been given. This
"day Was probably ﬁxed upon for the commencement of
the presidential term, because the. term for which the
house of representatives and one third of the senate are
elected, expires on the third day of l\/larch, in.ever.y second
year; and the term of each new congress consequently
begins on thefour-th of March. . . 

~ 179._ The term for which the president is elected, is
deemed sufficiently long for the . purpose of making him
feel firm and independent in the discharge of his duties,
andtogive stability to his administration; and‘yet short
enough to place him under a due sense of depetiden-co’
upon the public approbation. i The president may be re-
elected after the expiration of the term for which he was
elected; but no one has yet consented to be a candidate

.A .171. For the election of president, each state is required
to appeinet.,_in such manner. as the legislature thereof di-
 a number of electors, equal to the whole number
of senators and representatives, to which the szateimay
 entitled in congress. The manner of appointing. elec-
tors isstet uniform throughout the states. ,In some of the
sta~tes,th.e electors are appointed by the,1eg.is,latn,re; Jn
others, they are chosen by districts. .. By this,mode, a

number of electors, equal to the number of members of’

the heuse of representatives, to which a state is entitled,
are chosen by the people in the same manner in which
Representatives are elected. These electors, so chosen,
then meet, and choose the remaining two electors, cor-
responding with the number of senators to ‘which the

,.stste. is entitled in congress. Another mode, and that

which prevails at present in a majority of the states, is

by general ticket. According tothis system, the names
of a number of candidates, equal to the whole number of
electors to be chosen, are placed on a single ballot ; and
such number of candidates are voted for throughout the
state.

172. No senator or representative, or person holding
any oflice of trust or proﬁt under the United States, may

be appointed an elector. This is to prevent the person,

in oﬂice from having an improper inﬂuence in procuring
his reelection, by his ordinary agency in the government.
Persons, thus holding offices under the government,
whose continuance in such offices depends on the will of
the executive, if chosen to beelectors, might be tempted

to vote for that candidate for president, Whose favor they

would be most likely to secure, without due regard to his
fitness for the dffice. .

173. The election of president by a small number of
electors, chosen in each state for that purpose, was inten-
ded to prevent the evils that were apprehended from an
election by the people at large. It was feared that an
election in which the people of the entire union should
participate, would produce a contest too violent and tau»
multuous for the public virtue and tranquillity. Another
object of the present mode was to preserve the state sove»
reignties, and to prevent the entire consolidation of the
government, in organizing the executive department.
There are, however, at the present day, many advocates
for referring the election of president directly to the
people.

174. Congress may determine the time of choosing

the electors, and the day on which they shall ‘give their
votes; which day shall be the same throughoutthe Uni-

ted States. This provision was meant to close.;as 

possible, the opportunity for bargain and intrigue in the

of president and vice president? 172. Who notbe

election. Congress has accordingly enacted, that the
electors shall be chosen Within thirty-four days preceding
the day on which they shall give their votes ;~ and that
the day on which their votes shall be given, shall be the
first Wednesday in December, in every fourth year after
the last election.

175. The electors in each state meet at the place ap-
pointed by the legislature thereof, which is usually at the
seat of the state government, and vote by ballot for pres-
ident and vice president, one of Whom, at least, shall not
be an inhabitant of the same state with the electors. They
name, in their ballots, the person voted. for as president,
and in distinct ballots, the person voted for as vice prcsi~
dent; and they make distinct lists of all persons thus
voted for, and the number of votes given for each. These
lists they sign and certify, and transmit, sealed, to the
seat of government of the United States, directed to the
president of the senate.

“ 176. By an act of congress, the electors in each state
are requiredtto make and sign three certiﬁcates of all the
votes by them given, an.d to seal up the same. One
of these certiﬁcates is directed to be sent by a person duly
appointed by them for that purpose, to the president of the
senate, at the seat of government, before the first day of
Januar next ensuing. Another of these certiﬁcates is
orders to be forwarded;‘ by the post oﬂice, also directed
to the president of the senate; and the other certificate is
to be delivered to the judge of the district in which the
electors are assembled. The day appointed for opening
the “certificates and counting the votes,‘ is the second
"Wednesday in February succeeding the election.

 177. tTh‘e president of the senate, on theleday appointed.

receivedby him; and the votes are then counted: "the

person having the greatest number of votes for president,
is president, if such number be a majority of the whole
number of electors appointed; but if no person has suela
majority, then, from the persons having the highest num:~
hers, not exceeding three, on the list of those” voted for
as president, the house of representatives shall immedi-
ately choose, by ballot, the president. ,

178. But when the choice of president devolves .on the
house of representatives, the votes are taken by states, the
representation from each state having one vote. A quorum
for this purpose shall consist of a member or members

from two thirds of the states; and a majority of all the I

states shall be necessary to a‘ choice. And if the house
of representatives shall not choose a president, before the
fourth day of March following, then the viceopresiclenet
-shall act as president, as in case of the death or other
constitutional disability of the president.

179. The person having the greatest number of votes
as vice president, is vice president, if such number he a
majority of the whole number of _electors appointed; and
if no person h.as a majority, then, from the two highest
numbers on the list, the senate chooses the vice president.
A quorum for this purpose shall consist of two thirds of
the whole number of senators; and a majority" of the
whole number is necessary to a choice. ,

180. No person, except a natural born citizen, or a
citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption
of the constitution, is eligible to the ofﬁce as president.
The qualiﬁcation of birth cuts off all inducements from
abroad to corruption and negotiation. As the president
islrequired to be a native citizen of the United States,
ambitious foreigners cannot intrigue for the ofﬂce, A  

181. Neither is any person eligible tothe oﬁice of

years, and been fourteen years a resident within the Uni-
“ted States. The age required, is sufficient for a person
to have formed his public and private character; and a
long domestic residence is intended to afford his fellow
citizens the opportunity to attain a correct knowledge of
his principles and capacity, and to enable him to acquire
habits of attachment and obedience to the laws, and of
devotion to the public welfare.

-'1 82. The same qualiﬁcations are necessary to render
a person eligible to the office of vice president, as are
required for the office of president.

183. In case of the removal of the president from office,
or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the
powers and duties of the said oﬂice, the same devolves
on the vice president, and congress may, by law, pro-
vide for the case of removal, death, resignation, or ina-
bility, both of the president and vice president, declaring
what officer shall then act as president; and such ofﬁcer
shall ‘act accordingly, until the disabilitybe removed, or
‘ex president be elected.

E84» Congress has provided by law, that, in case these
supposed vacancies shall happen, the president of the
henate pro temporreshall act as president; «and, in case
there. should he no president pro tempore, the speaker of
the house shall so act, until the vacancy be supplied.
And as it may becomeva question on whom the office
would.devolve after the expiration of the congress for
which the speaker was chosen, it is usual for the vice
presideintxto withdraw from the senate previously to the
‘tsdjoummentiof the session, to afford an opportunity to
the senate to choose a president. pro tempore, who would,
in that ease, act as president. _ ,

Offices should be vacant, the law makes it the duty of the
secretary of state to cause notice to be given, to the exec»
utive of every state, and published, ordering an election
for the   appointment of presidential electors, to eleet at
preseident.

186. The president, at stated times, receives for hie
services a compensation, which is neither to be increased
nor diminished during the period for which he has been
elected; and heshall not receive, within that period, any
other emolument from the United States, or any of the
states.  

187. As it is a fundamental principle of our govern-
ment, that the several departments should be kept separate

and distinct, the support of the president was secured by ’

a constitutional provision, in order to preserve the due
independence of the executive department; which could

not be expected, if the legislature could control, at its dis-

cretion, the salaries of the executive and judicial omcers.
The compensation provided by law’ for the president, is
$25,009, a year, with the use of l>ui‘ldings, furniture, azrtﬁ
other effects belonging to the United States; and thatiof
the vice president is $5,000 a year, payable at the trees»

188. Before a president enters on the execution of the
duties of his office, he is required to take the following
oath or afﬁrmation: i _ p

execute the office of president of the United .States; and
will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend

judges, jurors, witnesses, and other civil, as well as mili-
tary ofﬁcers, to bind themselves under the solernnity of
an oath, to discharge their trusts and duties faithfully.
An oath supposes a belief that there is a God, who will
hereafter reward the Worthy and punish the wicked.
There are persons who believe that all oaths are forbid-
den: they simply aﬂirm, or declare. But a false afﬁrma—
tion subjects the person so affirming, to all the pains and
penalties of perjury. l

CHAPTER VII.

Powers and Duties of the President.

190. THE president is, by the constitution, made
cornrnander-in~chief oi the army and navy of the United
States, and of the militia of the several states, when
called into actualservice of the United States. The corn«
mand and application of the public forces to execute the
laws, maintain peace, and resist foreign invasion, are
powers of an executive nature, and require the exercise
of qualities characteristic of this department: in every
well organized government, these powers have therefore
been appropriated to the executive.

191., The president may require the opinion, in Writing,
of the principal oﬂicers in each of the executive depart-
ments, upon any subject relating to the duties of their
ofﬁces. As the several departments are established to
aid in the administration of the laws, and as the duties of
the president make it necessary that he should be kept
acquainted, as fully as possible, with the business of every

on thebpduties of his office? 139. What is an oath? What is the

branch of the executive department; it is proper that the
principal officers in each should give to the chief execu-
tive officer, such information and assistance, as may be at
any time required of them.

19:2. The president has power toigrant reprieves and
pardons, for offences against the United States, except in
cases of impeachment. The necessity of a pardoning
power, arises from the imperfection of human justice.
Under the most correct administration of the laws, men
are‘ sometimes liable to suffer from revengeful accusers,
-the inaccuracy of testimony, or the fallibility of jurors.
But there are cases in which policy and humanity require
that punishment should be remitted, though the crime be
clearly ascertained. The power of pardon, vested in the
president,,is unlimited, except in cases of irnpeachmient.
He is prevented, in that case, from screening public offi-
cers, with whom he might have formed a corrupt coali-
tion, or who might be his particular favorites or depend-
ants. .

193. The president has power, by and with the advice
and consentof the senate, to make treaties, provided two
thirds of , the senators present concur. A treaty, is a
bargain or agreement between nations on any matter that
concerns them. It is in this manner that civilized nations
settle their disputes, and agree upon the terms of peace
at the close of a war. Commercial intercourse between
nations is sometimes "regulated by treaty.   The terms of
1a treaty are agreed on by the ministers of each party,
who put their agreement in writing; two copies of which
are made, signed and sealed; and pne of them is sent to
each of the respective sovereigns, by whom the contract
is either ratiﬁed orrejected. Both parties must ratify’,.o,i'
there is no treaty. , r , V

194. In a monarchical government, the power of rati-
fying and rejecting treaties is exercised by the king. In
the United States, the power of making treaties is conﬁded

‘How is this power limited? 193. What is a treaty? What matters
are regulated by treaty? How are treaties made? ‘ 194. In whom

88 oovmtnnsrwr or was :3. 8TAT‘Es. Part III,

‘to the president and senate. As treaties are the supreme
law of the land, this power is considered by some as
more properly belonging to the legislature in a free gov—
ernment. But as secrecy and despatch in negotiations
mafyibecorne necessary, in order to take advantage of a
sudden and favorable turn of public affairs, this power is
pro erly ‘conﬁded to the W executive. And yet, to place
Witliout ‘limitation, in the hands-of the president alone, so
important a power, was not deemed altogether safe. The
eienate was therefore properly associated with the pre”‘si~
dentin the exercise of this power. Its members are easily
assembled, and are generally governed by steady, system-
«tic views, and a due regard for national character, and
act with promptitude and ﬁrmness.

F95. The president nominates, and by and with the
advi~ce and consent of the senate, appoints ambassadors‘,
other public ministers, and consuls, judges of supreme
court, and all other oflicers of the United States, whose
appointments are not in the constitution provided for, and
which shall be established by law. But congress may,
 law, vest the appointrnent of such inrferior oﬂicers as
thinks proper, in the president alone, in the courts of
law, or in the heads of departments.

196. The appointment of subordinate oﬂicers of the
government, concerned in the administration of the laws,

ibélongs with great propriety to the president, who is in;

it tiie.as_ure responsible’ for the faithful execution of the
laws; The association of the senate with the president
in the exercise of this power, aﬂbrds a salutary, check
upon the misinformation or errors of the president, whilst
it does not rn-aterially lessen his responsibility, or his
liability to the public censure or approbation; as he still
retains the right of selection and nomination, and as the
senate seldom rejects a nomination, unless it be highly
exceptiotlable. ‘

Why are the advice and consent of the senate deemed essential?

197. The president-has power to ﬁll up all vacancies
that happen during the recess of the senate, by granting
commissions which shall expire at the end of its next
‘session. This power is essential to prevent the inconve-
nience, and that detriment to the public interest, which
might be occasioned by vacancies in ofﬁce. But“ the
same reasons for which the senate is made a part of the
appointing power, require that cogmnissions granted by
the president should not extend . beyond the close of the
next session of the senate. VVithout this restriction upon
the power to fill vacancies, the president might continue
men in office at his own pleasure, for an unlimited, period,
howsoever incompetent or unfaithful they might be.

198. Vacancies that happen, are those which occur
from death, r'esignation,‘pro1noti0n or removal; and the
power has been questioned of appointing ambassadors to
‘foreign nations, during the recess of the senate, where no
such. appointments had before been made ; as, in that case,
no vacancy would have lzctppcned. And if the senate be
in session when a new office is created by law, and a
niotninatiotn be not then made by the president, it is sup-
posed he cannot appoint to such oﬂice during the recess,
as the vacancy does not then happen.

199. s The power of the president to remove an executive
officer has also been questioned, as no such power is ex-
pressly authorized by the constitution; but as it does not
declare that any but judicial oflices may be held dinning

good behavior, it is presumed that others are held during

the pleasure of the appointing power.

200. "I‘he president is required, from time to time, to
give to congress information of the state of the union ‘;
and to recommend to its consideration such measures as
he shall judge necessary and expedient. He delivers to
congress annually, at the opening of every session, a
message, giving information relative to the state of the.
union, its internal affairs, and its relations with foreign

n-.j_.

powers. He also recor_n-mends to congress the adoption
-of such measures as the public good may be supposed to
require. Special messages are also communicated to
«congress, from. time to time, on subjects as they arise, or
in obedience to calls of - congress for information.

201. The president may, on extraordinary occasions,

convene both houses, or either of them; and, in case of

-disagreement between them, with respect to the time of
adjournment, he may adjourn them to such time as he
shall think proper. He is required to receive ambassa-
dors and other public ministers; to take care that the
laws be faithfully executed; and to commission allthe
officers of ,the United States.‘ The propriety of commit-
ting these simple duties to the president, is self-evident:
they are in their nature duties that pertain to the execu-
tive department of the government.

202. The trusts committed to the president are various
and important; and their proper or improper exercise
must have a sensible effect, either for good or for evil,
upon the general welfare. In View of the magnitude of
the executive trust, the constitution has made liberal pro-
vision to prevent its abuse: ﬁrst, in the mode of the
president’s appointment; which seems to afford a sulﬁ-
cient safeguard against the election of incompetent men,
as well as against the successful employment of undue
means to procure an election: secondly, by the limitation
«of oﬂice; he being made subject to removal at the end of
four years: thirdl ,by the precise and deﬁnite limitations

of his power: an lastly, by providing for his removal

from office, by impeachment, atiany time, for misdemean-
or or maladministration. ‘

a 203. But to all these safeguards and restrictions, should
be superadded unremitting vvatchfulness on the part of
the people. No barriers which the constitution interpo-
ses, nor all the restraints which have been, or that can be,

does the president’s message contain’! What is a special message?

204. To aid the president in the administration of the

governrnent and laws of the United States," the following  

dnpartments have been established, VIZ 2 ‘The departments

the attorney general, form the principal home ministers
of the executive, and constitute what is called the cabinet.
Tlie foreign ministers, and agents of a permanent char-
acter, are ambassadors, charges des affaires, and consuls:

, 205. Depcwtmetnt of State. This department existed
for many years before the adoption of the constitution.
It was called the “department of foreign affairs,” and
the chief officer was entitled “ the secretary of the depart-
ment of foreign aﬁairs.” By the act of 1789, it was
denominated “the department of state ;” and the principal
officer therein, “the secretary of state ;” who performs
such duties as are committed to him by the president, rel-
ative to foreign intercourse; and to public ministers and
consuls; or to negotiations with foreign powers, to
memorials and other applications from foreign ministers

206. The secretary of state keeps the seal of the
United States; he makes out records and seals all civil
commissions to officers appointed by the president, by and
with the advice and consent of the senate, or by the
president. He causes the laws, and all treaties ratiﬁed,
by the United States, after their passage, to be published
in the newspapers designated for that purpose, not excee~
ding three in each state and territory. He causes to be
pahiished, at the close of every session, eleven thousand

copies of the acts of congress, and to be distributed among‘

the officers of the general government, and among the se vi»
eral states; There are many duties of a similar nature
which devolve upon this oﬁcer. The patent office is
connected with this department. The secretary of state

employs. a chief clerk, and a number of subordinate"

clerks, whose compensation isﬁxecl by law. The salary
of the secretary of state is $6000 a year.

207. Department of the Treasury. This department
existed, under different forms, during the confederation,
and for many years after the adoption of the constitution.
It received its present organization, by the act of ~ March,
1817: The oﬁicers of this department are, a secretary,
who is the head of the department, two comptrollers, ﬁve
auditors, a treasurer, a register, a commissionerofs the
land office; each of whom is allowed one chief clerk,
and such additional clerks as the business of their respec-
tive offices renders necessary.

208. The secretary of the treasury prepares, and lays
before congress, at the commencement of every session, a
report of the ﬁnances, containing a statement of the pub-
lic revenue and expenditure during the past year,» the
value of the imports and exports for the same period, and

estimates of the revenue and expenditures for succeeding

years, and plans for improving the revenues. He also
makes, annually, a statement of appropriations of money,
and of sums remaining in the treasury: he superihtends
the collection of the revenue, and provides for building
and keeping in repair, the light houses, beacons, buoys,
and public piers in the several states; and performs such
other duties as appertain to his office.   His salary is
$6000 a year, .

209. The business of the comptrollers and auditors,
relates chieﬂy to examining and settling the public ac-
counts, and to the recovery of debts due to the United
States. The treasurer receives and keeps the money of
the United States, and pays out the same on warrants
drawn by the secretary of the treasury; antlwon the third
day of ‘every session, lays before congress copies of all
accountssettled with the comptroller, and a true account
of the state of the treasury. The register annually pre~t
pares statistical accounts of the commerce of the United
States with foreign countries, for the preceding year, to
be laid by the secretary of the treasury before congress
at every session. Such accounts state the goods imported
and exported, and the navigation employed in the foreign
trade. a The commissioner of the land office superintends
and performs such, acts as relate to lands patented or
granted by the United States. No person holding an
ofﬁcein this branch of the department, is allowed to have
axryinterest in the purchase of any public land; nor may
he take any fee or emolument for negotiating or trans-
acting the business of the office, other than his salary.

prescribe the manner of keeping, settling and collecting
the public accounts. In cases of insolvency, debts due
the United States on revenue bonds, must be ﬁrst satisﬁed.
The United States cannot be sued. A creditor who is
refused payment, must apply to congress. ,

211. Depcmfment of War. The »sec.retary of "war
performs such duties as relate to military commissions,
or to the landforces, and warlike stores of the United
States; or to such other matters respecting milita.ry or
Indian affairs, as shall be assigned to his department.
He is required to make an annual statement to congress
of the expenditure and application of moneys drawn from
the treasury for his department, and to make such sug-
gestions to congress relative to the condition of his de-
partment, as he shallothink proper. I-Iis salary is $6,000
a year.

t 212. In this department, is transacted the business re-
lating to military pensions. A pension is a yearly allow-
ance to a person by the government, in consideration of
past services. Laws have existed, from the ﬁrst .organi~
zation of - the government, granting pensions topersons
disabled in the War of the revolution, in such m‘anner as
to render them unable to procure a subsistence by manual
labor. After the close of the late war, persons were
added. to the pension list, who had beendisabled by
wounds while in the service during the late war. Pen-
sions were also allowed, by act of 1818, to all the solder:

l of the revolution, who had served nine months or longer

in such war, and who were» in necessitous circumstances.
By act of 7th June, 1832, the pension list was so extend-
edtas to :include all who had served in the army or navy,
during. the war a of the revolution, for six months at
.least.

his ofﬁce. His duty is to prosecute and conduct all suits
in the supreme court, in which the United States shall

passports, of masters of United States’ vessels arriving
at the port where they reside. Their business is to ren-
der any assistance which merchants or ship masters of
their own country may need; and they grant all certiﬁ-
cates required by commercial regulations, or by treaty.

Chap. IX. or THE JUDICIAL rowan. 97

CHAPTER IX. V
Of the Judicial Power.

219. THE judicial power is that branch of the govern-
ment, to which the administration of justice, and the

interpretation of the constitution and the laws, are en- ,

trusted; and no government can be complete,‘ Without

such‘* a distinct and independent department. Without

this power, a constitution could not be carried into effect‘;
and yet, to vest the power of interpreting and applying
the laws, together with the power of making and execti—
ting them, in a single man, or body of men, would c‘on~
stitute an absolute despotism, subject to no restraint but
that of brute force. ‘

220. The constitution declares, that “the judicial power
of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court,
and in such inferior courts, as congress may, from time
to time, ordain and establish. The judges both of the
supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during
good behavior; and shall, at stated times, receive for their
services a compensation, which shall not be diminished"
during their continuance in ofﬁce.” ‘  

2:21. In organizing the judicial department, it was
deemed of the first importance to render the judges inde-
pendent. To secure this object, provision has been made,
(1.) in the mode prescribed in the constitution‘ for their
appointment. To fulﬁl the duties of the judicial oﬂice,
men should be selected of the most inﬂexible justice, who
could not be swerved from a faithful ‘discharge of A their
duties, by considerations of fear or favor. But as the
qualities requisite for this office are not the most popular,
men possessing these qualities, would probably too often

fail to secure an election resting on universal suffrage.
Their appointment was therefore vested in the executive
and the senate. The independence of the judges is se-
cured, (2.) by the duration of theirtofﬁces; which is, in
effect, for life, unless sooner removed on impeachment for
official delinquency. This is esteemed one of the most
valuable of modern improvements inthe practice of gov-
ernment. And (3.) the permanent provision for their
support is calculated to secure an independent judiciary.
Without such a’ provision, the ﬁttest and most learned
men would not relinquish lucrative professional pursuits,
for astation in the government, for the labors of which a
liberal and permanent compensation was not provided.

i 222. To ensure a just performance of their duties, they
are made amenable for any corrupt violation of their trust;
and, on impeachment, they may be removed from oﬁice,
and disqualiﬁed from holding any oﬂice whatever, under
the government of the United, States.

223. The judicial power _ extends to all cases in law
and equity, arising under the constitution, the laws of the
United States, and treaties made under their authority;
to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers
and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime juris-
diction; to controversies to which the United States is a
party; ‘ to controversies between two or more states;
between a state and citizens of another state; between
citizens of diﬂ'erent states; between citizens of the same
state. claiming lands undertgrants of diﬂ"erent states; and
between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states,
citizens, or subjects.

224. The propriety and ﬁtness of these judicial powers,
seem to result, as a necessity, from the union of the states
injone national government; for without them, a govern-
ment could not long exist. They are made to extend “to
all cases arising under the constitution,” because the

meaning and operation of a compact ought always to be
ascertained by an authority derived from all the parties,
and not from an authority derived from any -‘one/of them.
The cases here enumerated, are evidently of national
concern; and the exercise of the judicial power by any
one of the parties, would produce confusion and mutual
dissatisfaction, and disturb the peace of the union.

225. The organization of the judiciary was provided
for by the» judiciary act of 24th September, , 1789. By
this act were constituted, the supreme court, and courts
of inferior grade, called circuit courts, and district courts.

%26. The supreme court consists of a chief justice, and
six associate justices, any four of Whom are a quorum.
This court holds annually, at the city of ashington,
one session, commencing on the second Monday of
January. The session usually continues about eight
weeks.

227. The constitution provides that, in all cases affect-t
ing ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and
those in whicha state shall be a party, the supreme court
shall have original jurisdiction. In all other cases
before mentioned, the supreme court shall have ‘appellate
jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such excep-
tions,and under such regulations, as the congress shall
make. '

228. By original jurisdiction in any case, it is meant,
that such case may originate, or commence,‘ and be tried
in this court. If a case has been ﬁrst triedin an inferbr

court, and a party he not satisﬁed with the decision of the

court,*such party may appeal to the supreme court for
trial. in such trial, this court is said to have appellate
jurisdiction. The grant of originial jurisdiction to this
court does not imply, however, that it has exclusive juris-‘
diction. It has original jurisdiction in no other cases;
than those mentioned in the constitution. Its principal

whereby a case. is transferred to‘ the supreme court; and
the decision of the state court maybe approved or rever-

-sed. This provision is arr essential one, that the consti-

tution and laws of the union may he ﬁnally judged of by
-one tribunal, and that there may not be discordant judg-

ments in like matters. By writ of error, nothing is

removed for re-examintion but the" law in the case; by
appeal, the whole cause is entirely removed, and all the
factsare submitted for a re-hearing. 4
239; The United States are dividedinto seven circuits,
in each of which, two courts are annually held. A
circuit court is composed of the judge of the supreme
court, residing within such circuit, and the judge of the
district wherein the court is held. The seven judges of
the supreme court” are so located as to bring one of them
in each of the several circuits. -
t 231-. This court tries causes between citizens of differ-
ent states, between aliens and citizens, and those wherein
the United States is a party. ‘ It also tries some cases in
appeal from the district courts. It sits in four different
capacities: (l.)‘ as a court of common law; (2.) as’a court
of equity, otherwisetermed a court of chancery, in which
thlre is no trial by jury; but the one party states his
complaint in a bill of equity, and the other defends in a
written answer. This is one of the few cases in the ad-
ministration of justice, wherein what a party says for

United States.   Every state in the union, constitutes at

‘two. In each of these there is a district judge. His

powers relate to cases arising under the laws made for
the collection of duties, to seizures of goods, to penalties
and forfeitures. under the laws of the United States, to
matters in which aliens andforeign consuls’ areparties;
and to crimes of inferior grade against the laws of the
United States, whether on. land or sea. Inevery district
there is a district 6Ltt07‘7tl3,7/2 who institutes and conducts

CHAPTER X.
Powers of Co2tgress.—-R~e've7me—--Taxes, Duties, rye.

235. BY ‘revenue is understood the annual income of a
nation, or those contributions to its treasury which are
levied ' to defray the expenses of government. The
money required for this purpose is usually raised by tax-
ation. The constitution therefore authorizes congress
“ to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises; to
pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and
general welfare.” It was necessary that congress should
possess this power, as no government canbe supported
without the means of procuring an adequate supply ‘of’
revenue. A‘  ' V ‘

236. Tastes are that portion of the property of its sub-*
jects, which a government exacts from ‘them to supply
the public necessities. These are called ‘direct taxes, and
are either taxes on lanclgior capitation" or pull mazes. The
treasury of the United States hasbeen several times sup-
plied by tax, on landed proper’: . But iityis many years
since direct taxes were ‘resortei to. ‘They. incomederived

237. Duties on imported goods, however, constitute the
chief portion of the revenue. rThey are called indirect
tastes, because they are not directly levied upon property,
but they merely affect the expense or. consumption of
goods. Duties, customs, excises and imposts, are words
of nearly the same meaning. ‘They are laid orrimports
and tonnage. .

238. Imports are aI't1Cl8S brought into a country from a
foreign place. A duty on imporrts is not rnerelyatax on
the act of importation, but animpost on thearticle impor~
ted. Duties are either speciﬁc or ad valorem. A specyic
duty is a tax of a certain, specified amount, laid upon an
article by weight or measure, or in the gross. Thus; at
duty of ten cents on a pound: of tea, or ﬁftycentsonra
yard of cloth, is called a speciﬁc duty. Admalbrem is
a. Latin phrase, signifying according to the value. V. Ad
valorem duties are therefore such as bear a certain pro-
portion to the value of the goods. A duty of fifty per
cent, that is, at the rate of ﬁftycents on every dollar, or
ﬁfty dollars on every hundred dollars, of the cost or estir
mated value of goods, is an ad valorem duty. Thus, if
a yard of cloth, valued at one dollar, were subject to a
duty of fifty per cent, such duty would be ﬁfty cents a
yard ; if the value of the cloth were two dollars, the duty
at the same rate would be one dollar a yard, the amount
of duty on the yard varying according to the value oi’ the
article.   i

239. Tamtageis the amount of goods that a ship will
carry; the contents ‘or burthen of a ship ; or the amount
of weight she may carry. The duty charged on ships
according to their thurthen, or the‘~n‘umber" of tone at
which they are rated, is called tonnage. duty. These
duties are usually -fixed by congress. T

240. By acts of 1790 and 1817, vessels of the ‘United
States, when entered in the5:United “States from a foreign
port or place, are made subject to a duty of six cents ,8.

ton; but if the officers, and two thirds at least of the crew
of a vessel, be not citizens of the United States, there shall
be paid on such vessel fifty cents a ton. On every such
vessel, entered in a district in one state, from a district in
another state, the duty is six cents; but unless three
fourths of the crew be American citizens, ﬁfty cents a ton
shall be paid. But the law imposes a higher duty on
foreign than on American vessels. The above acts pro-
vide that on vessels built within the United States, but
which belong Wholly or in part to subjects of foreign
powers, a duty of thirty cents a ton shall be paid; on
other vessels, ﬁfty cents a ton. On foreign vessels, entered
in the United States from a foreign port at which Ameri-
can vessels are not ordinarily, permitted to trade, there
shall be paida duty of two dollars a ton. Duties imposed
on the tonnage of vessels, must in all cases be paid to the
collector at the time of making entry, and before any
goods may be unladen.

241. A drawback is an allowance made to importing
merchants on the re—exportation of certain goods. This
allowance consists either of the whole or a part of the
duties which had been paid upon the importation. In
England, the practice prevails, to some extent, of allowing
the imerchant who imports a commodity which he may
Wish to export again, to deposit it in the public warehbu-
see, giving a bond for the payment of the duties should
he dispose of it for home consumption. This is called
b.ondi,7tg.t   In the United States, a drawback is allowed on
all such goods as shall be re-exported to a foreign place,
within twelve rnonthslafter the duties on the importation
shall have begenipaid, or security given for the payment
of the same: provided the exportation be made by the
sea, in vessels of not lessythan thirty tons burthen.

243. FOR the collection of customs, there is appointed in‘
every district of the United States, a caller-to7°,’whose duty
it is to receive, at the port within his district, all reports,
manifests and documents to he made or exhibited on the
entry of any vessel, to record all manifests, and to receive‘
the entries of all vessels, and the goods imported in them.
He is also required to estimate the duties, to receive all
moneys paid for duties, and to take bonds for securing the
payment thereof. He grants all permits for the nnlading‘
and delivery of goods; and, with the approbation of” the
principal officer of the treasury, he employs ‘proper per-
sons as vveighers, measurers, gaugers and inspectors at
the several ports Within his district, and provides store—'

houses, scales, weights and measures. .

244. There are appointed, at ports where it maybe
necessary, -also a rm/zral oﬂi'ce'r and szmyeg/or. Ittis the
dutyof a naval oliicer to receiaive copies of all manifests
and entries, and, with the collector, to estimate the duties

on goods, and to keep a. record thereof. He countersigns
all permits, certiﬁcates, clearances, debentures, and other
documents granted by the collector; examines the collece
tor’s abstracts of duties, and other accounts of receipts,
bonds and expenditures; and, if found correct, he certiﬁes
them. Thesurveyor superintends and directs the inspec-
tors, vveighers, measurers and gaugers within his port.
He visits and inspects the vessels that arrive, and makes a
return in writing, every morning to the collector of vessels
arrived the preceding day. He is in all cases subject to
the direction of the collector.

245. In each of theports at Boston, New York, Phil-
adelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, Savannah and New
Orleans, two appmisers are appointed, to inspect and ap—
praise such goods as thezcollector may direct, and whenever
that duty shall be required by any acts relative to imports
and tonnage. ’

246. The collector, naval oflicer, surveyor and apprais~
ers, are ap ointed by. the president and senate; all of

whombut t e last named are required to give bonds, with

sureties, for the faithful performance of their duties.

247. The compensation of appraisers is $1500 at year,
each; excepting those for the port of New York, who
receive $2000 each. The collectors, naval officers and
surveyors receive speciﬁc fees for the several acts and
duties they perform.- But whenever the emoluments of
a collector of the ports above named exceed four thousand
dollars a year, of a naval oﬂicer three thousand dollars,
and of a surveyor two thousand ﬁve hundred dollars,
‘besides the necessary expenses incident to their ofﬁces,
-the excess shall be paid into the treasury of the United
States. And whenever the emoluments of any other
collector exceed three thousand dollars, of any other naval
officer two thousand ﬁve, hundred dollars, or of any other
surveyor two thousand dollars a year, besides expenses,
the excess is paicleinto the treasury. .

248. The master or captain of every vessel belonging
‘to citizens of the Uiiited States, in which goods are im-
ported, shall have on board a manifest, which is a Writing
signed by himself, stating the name of the place where
the goods were taken on board, and of the place toiwhich
they are consigned; the name, description and tonnage
of the vessel, and the place to which she belongs; the
name of each owner and her master; with a partic.utlar
account of all the goods on board. ' It contains also the
names of the persons that send the goods, who are called
consignors, and the names of the persons to whom the
goods are sent, who are called consignees. After the
report of the master of the vessel to the collector is made,
the owner or consignee of the goods makes an entry of
the same, in writing, with the collector, specifying the
names of the vessel and master, the place whence the
goods were imported, the marks, numbers, denomination
and prime cost of the same; and swearing to the truth
of his statement, and its conformity to the manifest‘.
When the amount of > duties is ascertained, the consignees
pay the same, or give bonds with sureties forthe payment
of tbem,«at a certain time afterwards. Thecollector then
grants a, Written permit for the unloading and delivery of
the goods.

249. To secure the collection of duties, congress has
made provision, by the imposition of heavy ﬁnes and pen-
alties for the violation of the revenue laws, and by au-
thorizingofﬁcers of the customs to seize and search vessels
that may be suspected to contain goods subject to duty,
the payment of which is designed to be evaded. The
getting of goods on shore secretly, without paying the
luties, is called smuggling. In cases of smuggling, and
in some other cases of frauds on the customs, all the goods»
are forfeited, and become the property of the United
States.  .

250. Further provision has been made to collect the
duties, by authorizing the president tocause to be built
and equipped ‘so many revenue cutters, not exceeding"
‘twelve, as maybe necessary to protect the revenue. A
revenue~cutter is a small, fast sailing vessel used for ap~
prehending smugglers, and for boarding vessels supposed
tocontain contraband goods. The collectors of the res-
pective districts also may, with the approbation of the
secretary of the treasury, provide small open row and
sail boats to be used by surveyors and inspectors, to ena-
ble them to go on board of vessels, and otherwise to detect
frauds. 9 All penalties accruing by breaches of the reve-
nue laws, must be sued for in the name of the United
States of America, in courts of the United States having
jurisdiction in such cases. p

251. The Whole revenue of the United States in‘ 1833,
from all sources, as appears from the annual report ofthe
secretary of the treasury, was as follows : From customs,
$29,032,508 91; lands, $3,967,682 55; dividends on bank.
stock, $474,985.; ‘sales of bank stock, $135,300; inciden-

amount exceeds that of any former or subsequent year.

253. A power of taxation of some kind or other must
he possessed by every government, to enable it to provide
for paying the ordinary expenses of its administration;
and the power to borrow money is sometimes indispensa-

ble for national defence, and other purposes for which the

revenue of the country may prove to be inadequate.
254. The purpose for which congress has found it
especially necessary to exercise the power of borrowing
money, was the payment of the public debt. By the arti—.
cles of confederation, the government adopted the public
debt previously contracted to support the war; and the
sixth article of the present constitution, imposes on the
United States all debts contracted before its adoption.
255. The whole amount of public debt existing at the
time the constitution Was adopted, was nearly $80,000,000.
A tax upon individual property to liquidate so large a
debt, would have been at that time extremely burdensome
and oppressive to the citizens. Provision was therefore
made in the constitution, authorizing congress to borrow
money for this purpose, and to pledge the credit of the
United States for its payment. By this means, together
with such portion of the revenue arising from duties on
imports and tonnage, as was not required for the support
of the government, and the proceeds of sales of public
lands, congress has been enabled so to control the public
debt as to prevent, almost entirely, the necessity at ya
recourse to direct taxation. ._  r i
256. The manner iniwhich the government borrows
money, is as follows :A   i * .
When money is "Wanted to pay a debt, congress passes
an act, authorizingthe secretary of the treasury, oreother
person, to borrow the money, and to make the United
States debtor for the same. The act states the amount to
be borrowed, the time when it is to b.e»paid, and the rate
of interest. Persons‘ who wish to lend money, then sub-

scribe, inbooks opened for that purpose, the sums they
will respectively lend; and for the sums so subscribed
and lent, certificates are given by the agent of the gov-
ernment,‘ stating the amount for which the United States

are indebted. The debt so contracted, and for which the

certiﬁcates are thus given, are called stocks. To persons
‘having these certiﬁcates, the government pays, quarterly,
the interest that accrues on them at the rate expressed in
the -act. These certificates are often bought by persons
to sell again. When they aresold at a price equal to the
amount expressed in them, stocks are said to be at par.

If their market price be higher or lower than their nomi-
nal value, they are said to be above or below par.

’ 257. During the late war, provision was made for bor-
rowing money,‘ by an act which authorized the issuing of
notes by the treasury, bearing interest at six per cent.
These notes were receivable by the government in pay-
ment for taxes, duties, public lands, &c.

6258. By the purchase of Louisiana, in 1803, and the
expenses of the late war, the public. debt was increased to
more than $127,000,000. One‘ of the means adopted to
liquidate the public debt, was the creation, at an early
period, of a sinking fund. V Sinking" fund signiﬁes that
part of the national revenue which is set aside for the
-national debt Additional yearly appropriations were
made, from time to time, until, in consequence of the
augmentation of the public debt, by the Louisiana» stock,
it became necessary to increase them to $8,000,000.

259. By the act of 1817, so much of allformer acts as
related to appropriations for the purchase of the principal,
and payment of the interest of the funded debt, was re-
peeled; and a yearly appropriation of $10,000,000,ari-«

Of Commerce.

262. Commerce signiﬁes a mutual change of goods,
productions, or property of any kind, between nations or
individuals, either by barter, or by purchase and sale,
When we speak of the commerce of a nation, we have
reference to its trade with other nations. ’

263. Congress has power, by the constitution, " to'reg—
ulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the“sev-
states, and with the Indian tribes. The propriety of
vesting this power in congress is plain : its exercise by

the several states might have produced a different system .

in -‘each state, and caused mutual jealousies, rivalries and
restrictions, which could be prevented only by a common
superior power. The general power of congress to reg-
ulate oornmerce, is not restricted to the mere buying and-
selling, or exchanging of commodities; but it extends to
navigation by vessels exclusively employed in transport-
ing passengers, and to every species of cornmercial«i‘nter-
course with foreign nations, and among the several states,
and with the Indian tribes. ‘

laws. E»mba*rgo, in commerce, means ‘a stop put to trade;
or, aprothibition of state, commonly on foreign ships, in
time of war, to prevent their going out of port or coming
in. Before the war of 1812, a law of this kind was
pas’sed,*( December, 1807.) ‘ In a case tried in the district
court of Massachusetts, 1808,’ it was objected that the act
was unconstitutional; that congress had no right, under
the power to regulate commerce, thus to annihilate it, by
interdicting it entirely with foreign nations. The court
decided that the act was constitutional. The power of
congress relative to commercial intercourse, is ‘sovereign,-

in *'theconstitution.- hp

and to render our nation independent of foreign nations
for its ‘supplies, the policy was adopted of irnposing upon
forei n goods, such duties as would make their cost
equa to the cost of similar goods manufactured by our
own citizens; and thus providing ’ for the latter a market
at home. T
278. But this policy‘ has always received much oppo-
sition.— ‘A It is objected, first, that the constitution does not
authorize congress to lay duties except for purposes of
revenue. The right of congress thus to protect domestic
industry, is inferred from the power “to lay duties to
provide for the common defence and general welfare.”
The term “general welfare,” if itbe allowed its share in
the meaning of this clause of the constitution, must imply
the power to lay duties to encourage domestic manu-
factures; especially as the general welfare is usually
promoted by such encouragement. It is further argued
in favor of this poWe’r,"that«the framers of the constitu-
tion, in providing for the regulation of commerce among
foreign nations, cannot be presumed to have overlooked
the object of authorizing congress to countervail the re-
istrictions which foreign nations might impose upon your
trade. r Thecpractlice of the/government has, from ayory
early period, been in accordance with this opinion.
‘.279. A'secondlol)jectien to this policy is, that the duty
thus imposed» is an unjust ‘tax upon the! consumer, who

ought to be permitted to’ purchase where he can obtain his

supplies at the low”est~prices.’ To this it is replied, that
whenariy commodity is duly protected,“it will be produced
in greater quantities, and the facilities for manufacturing it
wi1lpbeincr*easedc~; so that the ‘ rice will ultimately. be re-
duced to that of a similar “attic eimanutfaetured elsewhere.

281. The power to regulate internal ‘commerce, or
commerce among the several states, was rendered ne-
cessary, in order to give effect to the power of regulating
foreign commerce. This power was intended to prevent
the levyinglof unjust taxes or contributions by a state, on
goods imported or exported through it by another state.
Other evils, which may be readily conceived, might re-«
suit from the exercise of this power by the several states
to regulate trade between each other.

282. Several cases have arisen involving the question‘,
howl-far this power may be exercised within a state. It
is not disputed that all commerce which is coimpletelyi
internal, and carried on between different ports of the

same state, and does not extend to other states, is beyond

the ‘control of congress; while it is equally evident, that
the power to regulate commerce may be exercised within
a state. Fqr there are waters communicatingwiththe
ocean, which penetrate the interior, passing through se~v«
eraltstatest; and there are waters in and upon the *boun~
daries of several of the states, which afford“ ‘ameains of
commercial intercourse between those states. f In these
case‘s,~”it is clear that the power of congress may reach
the interior of a state.

283. It has been decided by the supreme Icourt, that
the acts of the legislature of ~ New York,‘ granting
toindividucals the exclusive right to navigate the‘ 
tors of the state in vesselspropelled by steam, were
tmcnnstitntional and void, and repugnant tothe power of
cengressaaiito regulate commerce, ‘ so.far as they wanted‘

‘, 284. Thepoewer to regulate commerce extends to con-
fer.r.i.n_g privileges upon vessels of the United States, em
gaged in the coasting trade and ﬁshertites. Coasting trade
is the trade carried (in between onedistriet and another
in the United States, on the sea coast, or on navigable
rivers. For the more .convenient ;reg'aulation of this trade,
the sea. coast and navigable» rivers of the United States
are divided into three great districts; and all vessels of
twentytons and upwards, being ,em'ofl.le.d accotdiiig to
3ew,,a.nd havinga license, are entitledto the privileges:
of vessels employed, in the coasting trade or ﬁsheries,
‘Vesselss of a less burthen. having onlya license, are enti’-
tléied to the same privileges. No vessel enrolled or lieensetcli
for this trade, is, permitted to proceed on a foreign voyage,
without having «given on her engtolment» and license, and
been registered conformehly to the laws regulating ves--
sels employed in foreign trade. If a vessel perform a:
foteignivoyage without complying with this regulation,
such vessel, with all her fumiture, and googls irngotted
therein, becomes liable tazseizure and forfeiture.

283. Bit intercourse with the Indian tribes, is subject
to legislative regulation. The president, by and with the
advice and consent of the senate, is authorized to appoint
an agent to each of the several Indian nations, to perform
such duties as shall be enjoined on him; and for the
faithﬁil perfprmaiice of these duties, he shall give bond};
in the sum .of ten thousand dollars. The salaries of
these agents are, from $1200 to $1800 a year, each, ,  

287'. The president is required also to cause the houn-
dary line. between the Indian territory and the United
States to be ascertained and marked. To promote civili-r
zation among them, and to secure the continuation of their
fttiendship, the president may furnish them with domesitii-,:
animals and implements of hushandr_y,, and with goods
ormoney, as heshall judge to or: but the amount of.
such presents may not exceed) ﬁ een thousand dollars 3.?‘

which the United” States are bound to pay the tribe to
which suohlndian shall belong. ‘ ‘
289. If a citizen or residentof a state or territory
shall make asettlement on the. lands of any Indiairtribe;
or if he shall survey, or attempt to survey, such lands,
or designate boundaries, by marking trees, or otherwise,
the offender shall forfeit a sum not exceeding one thoue

thereof, suffer death. If any citizen of the United States
shall commit any trespass within Indian territory, he

inproportion to the magnitude of the toffences.

291. The agents and superintendents of Indian aﬂ'airs',
may, under the direction of the president, grant to citi«

to trade with ‘the Indian tribes, taking bonds,‘ with sure-’

CHAPTER XV.
Noturalizcttion of Aliens.

292. THE power of congress next enumerated, is the
power “to establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and
uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies, throughout
the United States.” But while the constitution provides
for naturalizing aliens, it does not deﬁne the character
either of citizens or of aliens. . In the absence of such
definition, reference must be had to the English common
law.‘ In the United States, an alien may be deﬁned to
be a person born out of the jurisdiction of the country,
and not having acquired the rights of naturalization. To
this rule there is, however, an exception. . In accordance
with the principle of the English law, the right of citi-
zenship is given by the act of 1802, to children» born out
of the jurisdiction of the: United States, of persons who
arecitizens of the United States: such, for instance, are
the childr of» public ministers born during the residence
of their parents in a foreign country.

293. By the, adoption of the. constitution, the citizens.

of each state were made citizens of the United States;
for all who were not motive. citizens, or: citizenschorn
within the United States, acquired the rights of na.-tztmt;

purchase it, itis forfeited to the state whenever it is as-
certained by proper examination to he the property of an
alien. But aliens sometimes do own real property, hold»
ing it in the name of a friend. They may own and
transmit personal or moveable property inthe same man-
ner as citizens; and they may bring suits for the recovery’
and protection of such property".

294. In pursuance of the power granted by the con-
stitution, congress has provided a mode of removing the
disabilities of aliens.’ By complying with the terms of

these provisions, every alien may obtain the privileges of ‘

natural born citizens. Naturalization, is the investing
of an alien with the rights and privileges of a native sub»
ject or citizen.   i_ . .

295. An alien, to become a citizen of the United States,
shall declare on oath, before a court of some one of the-
states, or a circuit court of the United States, or before a
clerk at either of said courts, two years before his admis-
sion, that it was, borne ﬁde, his intention to become a‘ citi-
2en,‘and to renounce’ forever all allegiance to any foreign.
prince, state or sovereignty. and particularly by name
that whereof he is a citizen or subject. He shallgat the
time of his application, declare on oath, before one of the
sai-dkcourts, that he will support the constitution of the
United States, i     V

aufflcierit that the declaration be made at the time of his

admission: provided that he then declare on oath, and

prove to the satisfaction of the court, that, for three years

next preceding, it has been his intention to become a cit~
izen, and that he shall, in all other respects, comply with
the laws in regard to naturalization. .

298. By the act of May 24, 1828, an alien who resided
in the United States before the 18th June, 1812, and con-
tin ties to reside here, need not previously make the decla--
ration of his intention to become a citizen : . provided he
shall prove to ‘the satisfaction ‘of the court, that he was
residing in the United States, before the 18th June, If8.lj2,
and that he has continued to reside here; and provided
also that his residence shall be proved by the oath or affi-
davit of citizens of the United States. If the alien shall
have arrived after the peace of 1815, his residence must
have been continued for ﬁve years next preceding his ad-

mission, without having been, at anytime during the ﬁve»

years, out of the territory of the United States.

299. Children of persons duly naturalized, being mi-
nors at that time, shall, if dwelling in the United S,tates,
be deemed citizens. And if any alie-nshall die after his
declaration, and befo.re his actual admission, his widow
and children shall be deemed citizens. S

required to become citizens; ., the reason of which is obvi-
ous. It is not to be presumed that strangers can Shave.

and love theprinciples on which it is founded. A And ‘yet,
important as this knowledge is, a large portion even of
ournative citizens, arelittle acquainted with the-free
institutions of their own country.‘

CHAPTER XVI.
Bankruptcy.

  301. Anorrrnn of the powers granted to congress, is
the power “ to establish uniform laws on the subject of
bankruptcies, throughout the United States.” The word
bankrupt is derived from bamcus, abench, and me/plus,
broken, in allusion to the benches formerly used by mon-
-ey’ lenders in Italy, which were broken or destroyed in
case of failure. This Word generally means an insolv-
ent person, but, more strictly, an insolvent merchant. A
distinction has been made by some between insolvent
laws-and bankrupt laws; the latter providing for dischar-
ging; the debtor from his contracts; the former merely
liberating his person.

302. This power is for several reasonsentrusted to con-
gress": (”1.) To preserve uniformity and equality of rights
and remedies among the citizens of all the states. Much
inconvenience had arisen from the dissimilar and con-
ﬂicting laws of different states, and from the refusal of
somefst"ates to act on the subject.  Because creditors
in one“ state are not bound by the bankrupt’ laws of ano-
ther :. so that a debtor, though released from his debts in
one state-,,is still liable to be “harassed by new suits when-
ever he removes without the state boundaries. (3.) This

power in the general government is essential, also, to

nations. . H V g ’ g
303. As theoconstitution prohibits the states from pas-
sing “laws impairing the obligation of contracts,” the
right of a state to pass insolvent or bankrupt laws, is
questioned by many, who maintain that such laws impair
-the obligation of contracts; and that, as the power -18 giv-
en to congress to establish a uniform system of bank1'upt~
try, the power to‘ make insolvent, laws is the_reby taken
away from the states. R i
304. By the decisions which have been made by the
supreme court of the United States, the following points
appear to have been settled: (1.) That a state has no au«
thority to pass an insolvent or bankrupt law to discharge
a debtor from the obligation of a contract made before
such law was passed. But if the law existed before a
contract was made, it did not, in the sense of the consti-
tution, impair the obligation of that contract,‘ because
parties are presumed to have reference’ to the existing
laws of the country when such contract is made.  That
until congress establish a uniform system of bankruptcy,
.a state may pass such insolvent laws as do not impair the
obligation of contracts.  That a discharge is valid only
between the citizens of the state by which such law was
passed; and that a debtor, if he should remove into ano-
ther state, and there take the beneﬁt of an insolvent law,
does not discharge himself from debts contracted before
h,is,removal., V p
, 305. In view of the judicial decisions on this subject,
Chancellor Kent observes: “ It remains yet to be settled,
whether it be lawful fora state to pass an insolvent law,
which shall be effectual to discharge the debtor from 3.,
debt contracted after the-passing of the act, and within
the state making the law. The general language of lithe
court would seem to reach even this case; but the iiicts

tocengress’! 303. ‘Do the states possess thepower,of passing insol-
vent or bankrupt laws’! On what ground is this power disputed?

306. Congress has heretofore, ’(April, 1800,) exercised
itspower to pass bankrupt laws; but this lawwas either
repealed, or permitted to expire by  own limitation, in
December, 1803. At present there‘ is no uniform law on
the subject. The general object «of -fa: bankrupt law is to
relieve unfortunate traders, and, ‘at ‘the same time, to se-
ﬁure the application of their eiTe’cts't«o the payment of their

307. CONGRESS has the sole power “to coin mon'ey,.
‘regulate the value ‘thereof, and of foreign coin.” To
produce uniformity of value in coin throughoutthe
"union, this power is exclusively given to congress, as its
exercise by the steites would cause much embarrassment,
pveication and ftjaud, in consequence of the varying stand«
ards that would he established by the different states. A

308. Mint signiﬁes a place where money is coined by‘
public authority. The word coin, (.,French,) means :1
fistampp; oi‘ money stamped with a Iegalimpression.
Coining, until the last two or three centiuries, was very
iinperfectly performed, by placinig the blank piece of
money between two dies, orsteel punches, containing the
design oflithe coin, and striking upon the upper one with
‘it hammer. The irnperfectionef this hammer-money
was caused by the uncertainty of placing the two dies

being able to strike a blow with such force as to make’

all parts of the impression equally perfect. The coining;
press, or mill, now used, was invented in France. The

bars" or ingots of gold or silver, after having been “cast,”
are taken oiit of the moulds, and their surfaces cleaned.‘
They are then ﬂattened by rollers, and reduced to the’
proper thickness to suit the species» of money to be
coined. The plates are next cut out into round pieces by‘

a circular dteel punch of the size of the coin,,which is‘

driven downward by a pow‘erful screw, and passesthrough
a‘ corresponding circular hole, carrying before it the piece"
of metal which is punched out. These pieces are brought
tn the standard weight, it necessary, by ﬁling or rasping:
the deﬁcient pieces, together with the corners and pieces‘
of the plates, are returned to the melter. The iiiscr1;ption'%
or impression on the edge is made by rolling the coin,
edgewise, between two plates of steel containing the en-
graved edging. The stamping is performed by pressing
the piece with a powerful ‘screw, between two steel dies,
on which the ﬁgure to be impressed is enegravedg

309. The ofﬁcers and persons who conduct the business
of the mint, are a director, a treasnrer,.an assayer, a.chief
-coiiier, an engraver, a melter and refiner. The director,
with the approbation of the president of the United States,
employsthe necessary clerks and workmen, and has the
chief management of the business of the mint.’ The
treasurer receives .the metals brought to be coined, and
gives receipts for the same. The asseyer receives ‘rum,

the treasurer a sufficient number of grains of every per.» i
eel, and a,ss.~:L;ys‘them. This is aprocess to ascertain the ‘

quantity of gold or silver in. the alloy. Alloy is a c0rii~
position formed by the combination of two or more met-‘t

als. To alloy means to mix a metal of less  one off

more value. The baser metals are used to alloy gold
and silver coins, to prevent their lossby. wear. The

treasurer delivers the assayed metals to the chief coiner,
fronrwhom he receives them when struck, and pays or
delivers them to the persons to whom they are to be de-'
livered. , He also keeps all moneys for the support ofthe
mint, and pays them out upon warrants signed by the
director. The cloief coiner causes to be coined all metals
received by him for that purpose. The engraver sinks
and prepares the dies with the proper devices and inscrip-
tions. The melter and /reﬁner takes charge of all copper,
or silver and gold bullion delivered out by the treasurer
after it has been assayed, and reduces them into bars or
‘ingots ﬁt for the rolling mills. Bullion is uncoined gold
or silver in plates, bars or masses.

310. The proportional value of gold to silver in all

eoins by lavvacurrent as money in the United States, fixed.

by act of congress of April, 1792, was as ﬁfteen to one

that is to say, ﬁfteen pounds of pure silver were equal in
value to one pound of pure gold. By the same act, the
standard for gold coin was eleven parts of pure gold to
one part of alloy, the alloy to be composed of silver and
copper, not exceeding one half silver. The standard for
silver coins was one thousandpfour hundred and eighty-
ﬁve partsof silver, to one hundred and seventy-ﬁve parts

of alloy, the alloy to be Wholly of copper.

311. By the acts of 1834, the proportional and standard

«values were changed. The value of gold coins of the
‘United States, at present, IS as slxteen to one of silver;

ghee comparative value having been increased about six
and »a half per cent, The eagle of the old coinage,
consequently passes for about $10,663 and a new

eagle contains only a quantity of gold that was formerly"

valued at $9,311. Foreign   gold coins are made lawful,

312. With the power of coining money, congress ne-
cessarily possesses power “, to provide for the punishment
of counterfeiting , the public securities and current coin
of the United States ;” for Without this power, the power
to coin money would be unavailing. ,

313. The counterfeiting — or debasing of current

coin, is deemed an aggravated offence, and is punished

with heavy penalties. If anofﬁcer or person employed

at the mint of the United States shall debase, or make

worse, any gold or silver coin, as to the proportion of fine
gold or ﬁne silver, or shall rngke the same of less weight
or value than it ought to be, with a fraudulent intent, or.
shall embezzle any of the metals left at the mint to be‘

coined, the offender shallbe guilty of felony, and impris-r
oned at hard labor, not less than one year, nor more than

ten years, and ﬁned not exceeding ten thousand dollars.
314. If _ a person shall falsely make, counterfeit, or
fraudulently pass, any coin in resemblance of the gold or
silver coin of the United States, he shall be liable to a
fine not exceeding ﬁve’ thousand dollars, and imprisonment
at hard. labor, not exceeding ten years, according to the
aggravation of the offence. For counterfeiting coppere
coin, he shall be liable to a ﬁne not exceeding one thou-

, sand dollars, and imprisonment not exceedingthree years.

gold or silver coin, in actual use as money, imprisonment
not exceeding two ‘years, and ﬁne not exceeding’ two

had, before the revolution, been decided to be a rcom=’mon
law right, and had been securedto them, for limited times,
by acts of parliament. This provision seems to be in
accordance with the dictates, as well of policy as of jas-
tice. For, without an appropriate reward, there would
be little to induce authors to’ prepare elaborate ~work‘s for
the public. VVhile, therefore, a profit is secured tosthe
inventor,‘ the public is no less beneﬁted by the disclosiure
of the secrets of the discovery. , i

319. By acts of congress, thetright of the monopoly is
limited toa period of fourteen years. The term of a copy
‘right,,whi-3h was formerly ﬁxed at this period, Was, in
1831., extended to twe-.nty—eight eight years. This provis-
ion is deemed a suﬂicient encouragtem‘e~n’t‘to‘genius. Some
of the states, prior to the adoption of the constitution, had,
by legislative acts, favored certain discoveries; but as the
effect of these laws was conﬁned to the limits of a single
state, and as the authors and inventors were subjected to
the varying laws of the different states, the privileges con-
ferred by the state laws were of little value.

320. To secure the exclusive right to print andlsell

any} book, map or c’/tart, the author or proprietor is.re:qutir-
ed to deposit a printed copy of the title thereof, in the
clerk’s office of thedistrict court Where the authored‘
proprietor resides. The clerk records the title in a book
iiept for that purpose, and gives to the author, under the
seal of the court, a copy of the record. For which rec-
ord, the clerk shall receive fifty cents, and the like sum
for every copy, under seal, given to the author or propri-
etor, or his assigns.

 The author or proprietor is required, within three
months after the publication of the book, map or chart, to
deliver a copy of the same to the clerk of the district court.

325. To secure anexclusive right to make, use and sell
any new and useful invention, the inventor must allege
that he has invented a new and useful ‘art, machine or
manufacture, not ‘known or used before the application,
and must present a petition to the secretary of state, for
an exclusive property in the same. The secretarytof

state then causes letters patent to be made out, inthe name"

of the United States, signed by the president, reciting the
allegations and suggestions of the petition, giving a short
description of the invention or discovery, and granting to
the petitioner, for a» term not exceeding fourteen years,
the sole right to make and vend. the said invention or dis-
covery. These letters patent are delivered to theattorne-‘y
generalof the United States to be examined; Who, within
fiﬂeen days, if he ﬁnds them conformable to the law,

certiﬁes to the same, at the foot thereof, and returns them

to the secretary of state. ‘he secretary of state presents

the letters patent thus signed, and causes the seal of the

United States to be affixed to them. They are ,thenre-
corded in a book for that purpose, in the office of the
secretary of state, and delivered to the patentee, or his
order.

be stated in the speciﬁcation.

the secretary of state, must pay into the treasury thirty
dollars. He must also swear or aﬂirm, thathe verily be-

As it is an offenc-e against thelaw‘ of nations, every nation
has a right to attack and exterminate pirates, Without any

331. By statutes, both in England and in the United
States, certain oH'enc-es are made piracy. By the laws inf
the United States, if a person commit, upon the high seas,
out of the jurisdiction of a state, murder or robbery, or
any -other offence which, if committed in the bodyof a
county, would, by the laws. of theUnited'States, be pun-
ishable with death. It is declared, fiirther, thatif a cap~
tain or mariner of any vessel shall felonionsly run away
with the vessel, or any goods or merchandize to the value
of fifty dollars, or shall ‘yield up a vessel voluntarilyto
pirates; or if a Seaman shall lay violent hands upon his
commander, to prevent him from defending the ship or
goods cornmitted to his trust, or shall make a revolt in
the ship; every such offender shall be adjudged apirate
and felon, and be punishable with death.

332. ‘The African slave trade, which was tolerated for
many years after the constitution was adopted, was,in
1820, declared piracy. If a citizen of the United States,
being of the crew of any vessel owned in whole, or in
part, by a citizen of the United States, shall he engaged
in the a foreign slave trade, he shall be adjudged a pirate,
and ‘suffer death. 5 .

333». The transportation of slaves from the United
States, by citizens of the United States, to any foreign
.country, was prohibited by acts of March 1794, and May
1800. But as the importation of slaves was authorized
by the constitution until 1808, no law prohibiting their
importation, could be passed by congress, to take effect
before that time. ,

event all concern in the trade, on the part of our citizens,
they were forbidden to carry slaves on freight, or from
one port to another of the same foreign empire, as well
as 1 from one foreign country to another. The act of
March, 18 19, “Went further, and authorized national armed
vessels to be sent to the West of Africa, to stop the slave
trade, so far as citizens or residents of the United States
were engaged in it; and their vessels and effects were
made liable to be seized and conﬁscated. The act of
May, 1820, Went still further, and declared, that if any
vessel, armed or navigated for or on behalf of a citizen
of the United States, should land on a foreign shore, and

seize a negro or mulatto, with intent to make him a slave,

or should decoy, or forcibly bring such negro on board
such vessel, he should be adjudged a pirate, and should
be punishable with death. ‘

385. If a person, upon the high seas, within the admi«
ralty jurisdiction of the United States, and out of the
jurisdiction of a particular state, shall rmirder, or other-
wise so injure any other person, that he shall afterwards

die upon the land, the offender shall suffer death. If a

person shall wilfully destroy, or aid in destroying, a ves-
sel of war of the United States on the high seas; or if,
being the owner of such vessel, he shall corruptly cast
away, or aid in destroying the same, with a design to
prejudice any person that has underwritten a policy of
insurance, he shall suﬂer death.

336., For maliciously attacking a vessel with intent to
plunder the same, the offender shall be punished by-aﬁna
not exceeding ﬁve thousand dollars, and imprisonment not
exceeding ten years. Numerous other crimes committed

‘within admiralty jurisdiction, are punishable by ﬁne and

merated in this chapter must be tried in courts of the
United States.

338. Oﬂences against the law of nations, are, besides
piracy, violations of safe conducts or passports, and in~
fringements of the rights of ambassadors and other for-
eign ministers. A safe conduizt contains a pledge of the
public faith, that it shall be duly respected; and the ob-
servanceeof this duty is essential to the character of the
government which grants it. An ambassador cannot be
made answerable in a court of justice. Any Writ or
process issued against an ambassador, is void. If he
commit an offence he must be sent home, to be punished
by the laws of his own country.

339. The statute law of the United States provides, in

ﬁirthering the general sanction of the public. law, that

persons who violate passports, shall be imprisoned, not
exceeding three years, and fined at the discretion of the
court. The like punishment is inflicted upon persons
who infringe the law of nations by offering violence to
public ministers, by being concerned in prosecutingor
arresting them". This is an offence highly injurious to a

free and liberal intercourse between different governments. .

and mischievous in its consequences ‘to a nation; as it
tends to provoke the sovereign whom the minister repre-

the calamity of war.

340. [Censuses has exclusive power “ to declare war,
grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make. rules con-
cerning captures on land and water.” That self~preser-v-

-ation, or the right of selﬂdefence, is the first law of nature,
'-is a principle that has received the common assent of

mankind. If this principle be a just one, it is the right
of every nation to adopt all necessary regulations to resist
the aggressions of other nations. Upon, this principle,
thepower has been given to congress to declare war. A

just defence, or maliing use of force against any power

that attacks a nation or its privileges, is defen.s'i'r:e War. To
attain justice by force, if it cannot be otherwise obtained,
or to pursue our right by force of arms, is oﬁmsiee war.

341. But there are cases which, according to the law

of nations, constitute justifiable causes of war, when nei-
ther goodpolicy, nor a regard for the national honor,

requires such a measure. War is at all times attended
withsgreat evils; and the dictates, both of Wisdom and
humanity, forbid a recourse to War, except" in extreme
cases. The true honor and dignity of a nation are not

most effectually sustained by immediate resort to arms

upon every occasion of real injury.

342. The ancient practice of formally communicating
to. the enemy a declaration of war, «before hostilities are
sommencetl, is not in use. Such declaration istnow made

only to the nation that proclaims it. The power to de~
elare war is, in some countries, exercised by the king. In
the United States, it is more properly, as well as more safe-
tily, entrusted to congress.

340. Where is the power to declare war, &c. vested? Upon what
principle is the right of resistance founded? What is‘ defensive

The general practice is, to distribute the proceeds of the
captured property, when duly passed upon, and condemn-«
ed as prize, among the captors, as a reward for b-ravery,
and a stimulus to exertion. But the courts have no powa
er of condemnation, until the .legislative will is expressly
declared. l e ‘

the power of declaring war, and of providing for the

eommon defence of the nation; and necessarily includes .

the power “ to make rules for the government of the land
and naval forces.”

347’. It is the general policy of nations, in times of
peace, to prepare for War- A constant preparation for
self-defence is deemedthe most certain means of prevent»

ing the attacks of an enemy. One of the means provided»

by congress for the defence and safety of the nation, is a
standing army. A standing mmgy is a large number of
armedlsoldiers, kept constantly in pay, and ready for ac-
tion, in peace as well as in war. The standingarmy of
the United States consists, at present, of about six thou-

sand men, who are distributed among the several forts

and arsenals:
348. But standing armies are by many looked upon
with great jealousy, as dangerous to liberty. History

furnishes many instances in which nations have suﬁered

great injury from standing armies, and have been even
destroyed by them. But the distance of this continent

from the powerful nations of Europe, prevents the neces- _
sity of keeping up a large and dangerous peace establish-

ment.

349. A navy, is generally supposed to be a safer, as
wellasa more effective means of national defence. A
seam}/h,mean—s the ships of war that belong to a nation.
VVit.h the exception of a few years, it has ever been the
policy of the government to support an efiicient navy. In
1801, congress ordered all the vessels, except thirteen, to
be sold: thosenot directed to be kept in service in time of

peace, were to be laid up. In 1805, so much of the act

of 1803, as required a certain number of frigates to be
kept inservice, was repealed; and the president was au-
thorized to keep in actual service in time of peace,‘as

many frigates and other vessels as might be necessary,
and the remainder were to be laid up. A'_speci.es of vesw
eels, called gun boats, had been introduced, of which
there were ordered to bebuilt and purchased, during the
period from the year 1803 to the year 1807, two hundred
and seventy. Since that period, the navy has received due

attention, and large appropriations have, from time to time,

been made for its increase.

350. The strength of the navy of the United States in
1834, was as follows: 7' ships of the line, of 74 guns‘; 7
frigates of the first class, of 44 guns; 3 frigates of the
second class, of 36 guns; 3 sloops of war, of 24 guns;
13 sloops of war, of 18 guns; and 67 schooners, of 18
guns; making, in all, 41 vessels. There were then build-

ing 5 ships of the line, of which one would carry 140,

guns, and 7 frigates.

been adopted that placedthe military force wholly under
the orders of the national rulers. To attain uniformity
in the orgaiiization and discipline of the militia, it was

necessary, that its regulation should be entrusted to the

general government. The reservation to the states of the‘
JOWGI‘ to appoint officers, and to train the militia, while it
left still in the hands of congress all necessary power on
this -‘subject’, was deemed an essential restriction, in order
to guard against the usurpation and abuse of this power
by the general government. T _ '
353. The president is commander-in—cliief of the mili-
tia when called into the actual service of the United States:

when not in actual service of the nation, the militia is
commanded by the governors of the states, and subordin-

ate oﬂicers. The president has, by law, the power to call

out the militia, whenever he shallljudge it to be necessary,

to repel invasions, or to suppress insurrections, within the
United States; and he is to be the sole Ju.dge of the exis-

tence of the emergency requiring the militia to he called T‘

into service.
' 354. To those who object to thus placing the militia at

the disposal of the president, it must he replied, that this

power is to be exercised upon sudden emergencies, and
when theaction of congress may notbe readily obtained.
Neitherist it a valid objection that the power may be

Of the Post Oﬁce.

360. Conansss has power “ to establish post offices
and post roads.” Thegeneral objectof this power is to
provide for facilitating the transmission of intelligence.
and forpromoting a free and easy intercourse among the
.diﬂ'erent parts of this union.

36!. A general post office wasestablished by the colo-
nial congress, as earlywas the year 1775. The laws by
which it has been -reguliatecl, have been changed, from
time to time, as improvements were suggested, and the
increase of its business demanded. The business of the
general post rofﬁce is under the supervision of a post
master general. This oﬂlcer has, for the last few years,
been considereda member of the president’s cabinet ; and
the general post ofﬁce is spoken of ‘as being ttn auxiliary
executive department. .

362. The post master general has the direction of the
affairs of the department; he has two assistants, and such
clerks as may be necessary to perform the business of his
oflice. H e establishes post oﬂices, and appoints post
masters, an d all other persons employed in any of the
department s of the general post oﬂice, and gives instruc-
tions relativ e to their duties. He provides for carrying
the mail on all post roads, as often as he may think prop 1
er; and he pays all the expenses of the department.

District of Colu.mbia-—-Loca,l Jurisdiction, Q-cc.

3'71. ‘CONGRESS has the power “to exercise exclusive
legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not
exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular
states, and the acceptance of congress, become the seat of
government of the United States,  to exercise like
authority over all places purchased, by the consent of the
legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for
the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock yards, and
other needful buildings.”

.372‘. The establishment of a permanent seat of gov-
ernment for the United States, after the treaty of peace
with Great ‘Britain, received the early attention of “con-
gress: In October, 1783, it was resolved, that buildings
for thense of. congress should be erected on the banks of
the Delaware.» A few days later,’it was resolved, that
buildgin-gs~ for a similar purpose should likewise be ‘erected
‘on the‘ Potomac,’ with a View of reconciling the conﬂict-
ing wishes of the northern and southern states,'by estab-
lishing two seats of government. In "December, 1784, it
was further resolved that a district should be‘ purchased
o‘n*“the*'banlcs of the Delaware, for a federal town, artdthat
contracts should he made for erecting a house for theluse
of congress and the executive oflicers, and suitable build-
ings for the residence of the president and the secretaries

‘of the several departments, But the appropriation of the

necessary fund for these purposes, requiring‘ the assent of
nine states, was prevented by the southern interest. In
1790, a compromise was made, by which the friends of

Philadelphia, in consideration of having the seatof gov--_

ernment at that city, during ten years, the time estimated
to be necessary for the erection of the public buildings,
agreed that the seat of government should be permanently
ﬁxed on the Potomac. A M   ‘ t
‘ 373. The territory iniwhich the seat of government is
located, is ten miles square. It was ceded to the general
government by the states of Maryland and Virginia, and
erected into a district,‘ under the exclusive jurisdiction of
co.ngre‘ss, by the name of the “District of Columbia.”
In the city of Washington, which is built near the centre
of the district, the necessary buildings are erected for the
accommodation of A the general government, where its seat
was established at the commencement of the present "cen-
tury. It was in view of the acquisition of this terrritory,
that provision was made in the constitution for its govern-
ment. .
374. It is obviously necessary and proper that congress
should possess supreme control at the seat of t.‘:enational
government; and that the members of the eneral gov-
ernment should not be dependent on a state liar‘ protection
in the exercise of their duties. ”
' ”375‘. As the inhabitants of this district have placed
themselves under the government of congress, they have
no voice in the election of representatives, nor of electors
of president and vice. president. Although laws are from
time. to time passed by congress for the governmentef
this district, these acts principally adopt the laws of Mai-

' 1‘37,l7. The power of congress to legislate exclusively
within any place ceded by a state, carries with it the right
to imakethat power eﬂectual. Congress may provide,by
laws, for the apprehension of a person who escapes from

such place, aftewcomitting a,felony_; for conveying him

to or fromany other place for trial or execution.‘ s Con-
gress may punish those for m1spri,sio_n of felony, who,.out

the United States exclusive legiislyation and jurisdiction

session thereof, for one of the purposes speciﬁed in the
foregping clausegf the constitution. Such jurisdiction
cannot be acquired tortiously, nor by occupancy with the
tacit consent of the state. i

378. When a place has been purchased by the United
S;t_ates, for the erection of a fort, with the consent of the
state, the jurisdiction of the state ceases therein, and the

llliscellaneous Powers ‘of O:mgress.~ t

379.. Conensss has power “ to declare the punishment
of treason.” This power is indispensableto the preser-
vation of the government; and though it might have been
inferred from the power of self-7-defence, which every
government is presumed_ to possess ;. yet it is with great
propriety inserted in the constitution.  

£380. The constitution, with equal propriety, contains a
deﬁnition of the crime, prescribesthe proof requisite ‘for
conviction, and re-strains congress in punishing it. t It
declares that treason against the United States shall con-

sist in levying war against «them, or in adhering to their

enemies, giving them aid and’ comfort. The term, “lev-
ying War,” is adopted from the English statute of 'treason”‘s,
 has that sense in the constitution which it was under-

stood to have in‘ the English statute, from which it was

borrowed. An‘ assemblage of men, for a treasonahle put»
pose, such as War against the goveyrnrnent, or a revolution
of any of its territories, and in a condition to make such
war, constitutes a levying of war. a

force; troops must be embodied, men must be openly
raised; but ‘neither arms, nor the actual application of the

«force to the object, are indispensably requisite. “To march
‘in arms with a force marshalled and arrayed, committing

acts of violence, in order to compel the resignation of as
public officer, thereby to render ineﬁective an act of con»-
gress, is high treason. When war is levied, all whe

rform a part, however remote from the scene of action,

is punishable withmleath. >

382. But a mere conspiracy to levy war is not treason.
Asecret, unarmed rneeting of consipiratorﬁit not in force,
nor in warlike form, though met for a treasonable purpose,

and enlisted, is not treason; but these offencescare high

misdemeanors. J ‘
3813. In prescribing the proof necess_ary- for convic-
tion of treason, the constitution requires the testimony of

two w,itn.esses to the same overt act, or the ‘confession of

the ofFen.dei' in open court.‘

3.84. No attainder of treason shall work corruption of
blood, or forfeiture, except during the life of the person
attainted, »Cormy9tz'.on of blood_, by the common law of
England, signiﬁes that a person attainted of felony, for-
feits his estate; and that he can neither inherit lands
from his ancestors, nor transmit them to his heirs. But

the, constitution of the United States very properlyyprry

hibits this illiberal and unjust practice; and in the eIxer~
eise of, this power, congress has declared, that “ no con-
viction or judgment shall work corruption of blood, or
,a.~n,y fo'rf.eitm'c of ,estatte ;” so that the forfeiture may be
omitted, even during the lﬁe of the oﬁender.

385. Full faith and credit shall be given, in each state,
to the public ‘acts, ijectords and judicial proceedings of ev-
ery other state. And congress may, by general laws,
prescribe the manner in which such acts, records and pro-
ceedings shall be proved, and}: the eﬂiact thereof. This
pmvision was designedto secure the rights of those who
are'liable to suffer losses and injustice from the removal
of persons and their property into another state; as it was
to be presumed that cases of this kind would frequently
occur near the borders of states. Congress has, in the
exercise of this power, prescribed the manner of authen-

886. New states may be ‘admitted hycongress into

the: union. As the United States, at the-time of the a.dop~‘

tion of‘the,c.on..stitution, possessed alarge natcionalterritory,
and as more might be acquired by cession or otherwise,
the power to form new states,‘ and to admit them into the
union, was necessary; and it could not with propriety
have been vested elsewhere than in the national govern-
ment. But no new state may be formed or erected ‘with-
in the jurisdiction of any other state; nor may any state
he formed by the junction. of two or more states, or parts
of states, Without the consent of the legislatures oftho
states concerned, as well as of congress.

387. Congress has power also to dispose of, and make
all needful rules respecting the territory or other property
of the United States. Thepower of congress to exercise
authority over the territory ceded to the United «States,
duringtthe existence of the confederation, had been.,dispu:—
ted; an express grant of this power was therefore inserted
in the constitution. As the general government possessed
the right to acquire territory, it should also have the~poW-
er to govern the same ; as the ‘territoryrso acquired does
not become entitled to the right of self-government, and
is not subject to the jurisdiction of any individual state.
But nothing in the constitution may be so construed asto
prejudice» any claims of the United States, or of any par-
ticular state. _

388. The United States are bound to guaranty to every
state in the union, a republicanfoirm of governntr‘ent;t and
to protect each of them against invasion]; and, on applica~
tion of the legislature, or of the executive, (when the
legislature cannot be convened.,) against domestic vio-
lence. W'ithout this guaranty, the states could not de-

state records. &c.'t What is theiobjectjot” this provision? 386. Why

:preservia’g their constitutions, when threatened by domes-
ticcommotions; nor could the general governmentcon-
sstitutionally, aﬂord assistance to the supporters of the state
-governments. And, without authority to protect the sev‘~
eral states against invasion, andto aid them in maintaining
their ‘republican forms of government, there would be no
=aecuri.ty~to the general ‘government itself. For, should
one state after another be permitted to relinquish its re-
publican form of government, the whole system might
ultimately be subverted. A state, however, may make
any alteration in its constitution, that shall not change its
republican form. t t
.« .389. Congress may propose amendments to the consti-
tution, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it
necessary; or, on application of the legislatures of two
«thirds of the several states, it shall call a convention for
proposing amendments. Amendments, thus proposed,
are valid, as a part of the constitution, when ratiﬁed by
the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or
”by‘conventions in three fourths of the states, as the one
or the other mode of ratiﬁcation may be proposed by con-
gress; t
390. It was presumed by the framers of the constitu-
:tion,‘that, notwithstanding the care with which it had
been prepared, experience would discover it to be imper-
fect; or that, how well soever it might, at that time, serve
all the purposes of government, time and change of cir-
cumstances would render some alterations necessary. It
was therefore requisite that some mode of arnending it
should be; provided. But lest, by suchiprovision, the
government should be rendered unstable, by too frequent
alterations, modes of amendment were adopted which are
calculated to guard against an   alteration that isnot re-
quired to remedy some palpabiia inconvenience.

392. Since the adoption of the constitution, amendments

or additions have been, at three diﬂ"erent times, proposed.

bycongress, and ratiﬁed by the people. The first ten
articles of the amendments were proposed at the first
session of the first c.ongress,- which was begun and held
at the city of New York, on the 4th of March, .1789, and
were adopted by the requisite number of states. The
eleventh article was proposed at the second session of the
third congress. And the twelfth article, which changes
the mode of electing the president and vice president, was
proposed at the ﬁrst session of the eighth congress. This
amendment having been adopted, the 3d clause of the 1st
section of the 2d article of the constitution was thereby
repealed. ,

393. Frequent attempts have been made during the last
few years, to propose amendments to the constitution;

the United States shall be first satisﬁed.

397. Under the general power to pass all laws n.eces~
sary to carry into‘ execution the powers vested in the gov—

corporations, and ;establish a bank. This power was

exercised by the first congress under the constitution, by p
the passing. of» the act incorporating a national bank, in-vi"
in 1791; and, subsequently, in 1816, by the incorporation i

of a new bank, after the «charter of the first was expired.

398. Theconstitutionality of this power has, however, *

been seriously» questioned ;» and its exercise has met with
much opposition in congress. Although the opinion of

tify its exercise in the creation of a bank; such a ‘corpora’
tionl must be deemed necessary to carry into eﬂ"e7ct some
power vested in the general government.

399. Under theipower to establishpostoﬂices: and post
roads, and the power to raise money to provide for the
generalweilfare, as well as the power to pass all laws

necessary and proper for carrying into execution the  

powers vestedin the general government, congress has,
at different times, set apart funds for internal immova-
ments in the states, by meansiof roads and canals. c

400. It has been the practice to allow tothe new states

a portion of the proceeds of the sales of public. lands, to c

berlaid out inthe construction of roads and canals within
those states, or leading to them. The Cumberland road
was constructed under the actof March, 1806, under a
covenant made with the state of Ohio, that a portion of
the proceeds of the sales of public lands lying within
that state, should be applied to the opening of the roads
leading to that state, with the consent of the states through
which the road might pass. After the expenditures upon
that road had exceeded the proceeds of the sales of the
public lands in Ohio, a bill passed by both houses of con-
gress, in 1817, appropriating funds for continuing, it, was
neg-atived by the president,‘ on the ground that the consti-
tution did not authorize the making of roadszand canals,
and improving water-courses, through the d.ifferent states;
norcould the states confer the power. In 1832, a bill
up ropriating «money for repairing this road, and estab-
lishing tollgates upon it, was objected to by the president.

admitted by president Jackson, in his message containing
his objections to a bill that had passed both housesyofcorr
gross, authorizing subscriptions to the stock of the Mays-
ville turnpike road. It seems fair, tlierefore, to conclude,
from the general practice of the government, that “ the

cerns which affect the states generally, but not tothose
which» are within a particular state, and which do not

liable to mis-construction. It has been c.onsidyered as

ration to that effect: and the amendment in question could
not, therefore, have been intended to abridge any power
granted by the constitution.

CHAPTER ,XXV.
Restrrictlionston the Powersof Can.gre”ss.

408. IT was provided,.hy«i the constitution, that congress
should not, prior to the year 1808, prohibit the migration
or importation of such persons as any of the states, exist-
ing when the constitution was adopted, might think prop~
er to admit. This clause has reference to the slave trade,
which prevailed extensively in the United States when the
constitution was framed. It would probably have been
impossible to procure its ratiﬁcation by the number of
states required for its establishment, without recognizing
the right of the states for a period to continue the import-
ation of slaves; However, by yielding the right to pro-,
hibit such importation for a specified period, it doubtless
mntemplated the prohibition after that period should liave
elapsed. Laws have accordingly been passed,from time
to time,‘for the suppression of the foreign slave trade.
[See pages 137 and 138.] l ,
~ 407. It is indeed to be regretted, that the great charter
of American liberty has ever sanctioned this horrid
traﬁic; and itis somewhat remarkable, that a provision
of this character should be adopted by a people that had
declared it be a.self~evident truth, “that all men are crea-
ted free and equal,” and “ endowedibyttheir Creator with
the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness ;” and who had solemnly declared any form of

government to be unjust, that did not “derive its powers  
from‘ the consent of the governed,”

_  Whatlrestriction, relative to the importation of slaves, was’ “
imposed on congress? 4.07. Is the slave trade consistent with

408. This acknoWl‘edgin‘ent of the right of man to ‘hold,
as “propertg/," hisfellowi man, is incompatible with a just
sense of freedom. But while we cannot justify this prin-
ciple, let us not condemn the Inotivesiofttliiose who allow-
ed this provision to be incorporated in the constitution;
as it is not to be doubted, that they aimed,’ in all their
deliberations and labors, at the greatest good of the Whole

nation. And it certain_ilyiaﬁ‘o1'dsi‘ cause for gzjratulation,

that measures were so promptly adopted to abolish the
foreign slave trade,’ at the earliest period permitted by the
CODSi1i11l‘.10Il. ’

439. The privilege of the Writ of habeas corpus may
not" be suspended, unless when, in case of rebellion or
invasion, the public safety may require it. Habeas corpus,
(Latin,) signiﬁes, have the body. If a person has been
illegally deprived of his liberty, he may petittiontea court
or judge, who issues a writ to the party complained of,
coinmanding him to have the body of the person confined
before the judge or court. If, upon inquiry, the impris-
onment is found to have been illegal, relief is granted.
The privilege of this writ, and the riglit of trial by jury;
are among the greatest? privileges enjoyed under a free
government, as they afford the most ‘effectual security to
the right of personal liberty.  

410. No bill of attainder or ex" post facto‘ law may be

less. -in-proportion to the censustor enumeration ta1$.e.n~~as
directed by the» constitution. Cctpitetion signiﬁes enu-e
meration of heads. A capitation tax, usually called a
polltax, is therefore a tax laid on each person. Pally-is.
said to be a Saxon word, meaning head; and, by a slight
change, it is used also to signify an election, because the
result depends on the number of persons that act in it. ~

412. No tax or duty may be laid on articles exported
from any state. No preference may be given, by any
regulation of commerce or revenue, to the ports of one
state over those of another; nor may vessels bound tour
from one state be obliged to enter; clear, or pay duties in
another; A. uniform rate of duties or taxes throughout
the states, was deemed requisite to ensure domestic peace
and harmony. The levying of higher duties in the ports of
one state than in those of another, would prove a‘ fruitful
source of jealousy and dissatisfaction among the several
members of the union. Hence th.e propriety of this con-
stitutional restriction.

413. No money may be drawn from the treasury, but
in consequence of appropriations made by law: and a
regular statement and account of the receipts and expen-
ditures of all public money, must be published fromtime,
toctime. As congress is immediately responsible to the
people, it is properly entrusted with the disposal of the
public treasure. This provision was supposed, therefore,
to be most likely to secure a faithful application of the
public. money. And to perfect thesystem of accountabil-
ity, the public accounts are required, from time to time, to
be submitted to the inspection of the people themselves.

prevent the introduction of customs that might, in time,
diminish that respect for republican simplicity, which
fqrined so conspicuous a trait in the American character.

thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the
press. Among the “ unalienable rights,” with which men
are created, is religious ‘‘liberty. This liberty has been
denominated “ the liberty of conscience,” and “the rights
of conscience.” It is deﬁned to he, “the liberty which a.
man has of discussing and maintaining his religious
opinions, and of worshipping God in that Way“ and man-
ner, which he believes in his conscience to be most ac-
ceptable to his Maker, Without being liable to any degra-
dation, penalties or disqualiﬁcations, civil or political.”
415. A large portion of thexearly population of this
country was composed of persons who had come hither,
to escape the restrictions and disqualiﬁcations imposed, by
the laws of the Apparent country, on dissenters from the
established church. To avoid the evils which were known
uniform-ly to flow from an alliance between the church and
the state, and to secure to all the full enjoyment of reli~
giotis freedom, all interference by the government in rnat~
tears of religion, abridging inwany degree the rights of
conscience, bygiving preference to] any religious sect, is
expressly prohibited‘ by the above provision.

other support from government than protection in its free
exercise. This it requires; andreligious liberty‘ cannot
be said to exist, where the laws merely tolerate religion,
but do not, by penal sanctions, protect men in the exercise
of its duties.-

418. Freedom of speech, and of the press, is equally
necessaryv to the existence of a free state. The most ocliét
nus restrictions, had been, in many countries, laid upon
the press. It was regulated by prohibitions and licen-
ses from the government. New publications were not
allowed to be issued, until they had been approved by
licensers. But as such. restrictions were deemed. incoms
patible with all just ideas of freedom, the liberty of the.
press and of speech was guarantied to every citizen; he
being amenable to the laws for the abuse of -this liberty.

- 419. Of the restrictions remaining unnoticed, is that
which preserves to citizens the right of trial by j7.1xr;;:.
This rigrlit is enjoyed in all criminal prosecutions, and in
suite at common law, where the value in controversy
shall exceed twenty dollars; and is secured by the 5th,
6th and ’Ir’th articles of amendment.

420. The institution of trial by jury, is derived from
the Eii.giish laws. Trial byjury was recognized in crim—
inai suits in England, as early as about the beginning of
the ttveiftlt century; but in civil suits it seems not to have
reached its present form, until near the middle of the
thirteenth century. The jury system, in its present im-
proved state, is justly considered the “ great palladium of
liberty.” It was one of the most distinguished privileges
enjoyed under the British constitution; for as everyone
was tried by his peers, the meanest subject was as safe as
the greatest. It was regarded by the colonists, as the
most valizable civil privilege which they, as British sub-
jects. possessed; and the infringement of this right con-‘i
stituted one of the grievances enumerated in the declara-ti
tion of independence, as justifyingthe revolution.

on trial for a crime, until a grand jury shall have declar~

this mode of triale in criminal cases. i . ,

422. In some of the states in the union, parties to civil
suits, in which the damage claimed is less than ‘twenty
dollars, are not allowed the privilege of juries. It has
been well reinarked, “-it is the most transcendent privi~
lege which any subject can enjoy, or wish for, that he
cannot be affactetl either in his property, his liberty, or
his person, but by the unanimous consent of twelve of his '

424. The restrictions which are here and /elsewhere
imposed upon the states, are indispensably necessagrym
secure to the country the ’blessings of union. We1'e ev»
ery state at libertysto, enter into treaties oralliances .with
foreign states, or with other members of the union, it is,
easy to foresee the evils and dangers that would result
from such an exercise of this power. And with the pow-
er to grant letters of marque and reprisal, a state might

“involve the whole union in war, -as this measure is usually

followed by open hostilities.

, 425. To avoid the inconveniences that would arise
from coins so ivariousin value as might be expected . if
each state were permitted to coin money, and to regulate
its value, this power was prohibited to the states, arid
granted exclusively -to congress.

426.. Bills of credit are declared to mean promissory
notes, or bills issued exclusively on the credit of the state,
and which the faith of the state only is pledged to pay.
The prohibition does not, therefore, apply to the notes of
a state bank, drawn on the credit of a particular fund set
apartfor the purpose. The losses sustained previously
to the adoption of the constitution, from the eff‘-ects of pa:
per money, rendered this restrictiori upon the powers of
the states necessary ; while the ﬂuctuations in the value
of paper money seemed to require that gold and silver
only should be made a tender in payment of debts.

427. Laws impairing the obligation of contracts are
inconsistent with the secuie enjoyment of the right of
property, and the fundamental principles ol the social
contract. The power to pass such laws is therefore prop~
erly prohibited to the states. A state legislature may
alter or modify public corporations, such as counties,
towns and cities, provided the property therein be secured
to those who originally possessed it; but such legislature

letters of marque and reprise]? 4:25. Wtiy are they prohibited

cannot repeal statutes creating» private corporations, or
dispose of the property of the corporators. A charter
{torn the Britisli crown to the trustees of Dartmouth
college vbeforethe ‘revolution, has been declared to be a
contract within the the meaning of the constitution. The
supreme court held that the college was a private corpo-
ration; and that the act of the legislature of New Hamp
shire, .mat’erially altering the charter without the consent
of the corporation, was a law impairing the obligation of
2 contract, and was unconstitutional and void.

428. No state may, without the consent of congress.
lay any impost duties on imports or exports, except what
may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection
laws; and the nett produce of all duties and imposts laid
by any state on imports or exports, must be for the use of
the treasury of the United States; and all such laws are
subject to the revision and control of congress.

429. No state may, without the consent of congress,
lay any duty of tonnage, keep troops or ships of war in
time of peace, enter into any agreement or compact with
another state, or with a foreign power, or engage in war,
unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as
will not admit of delay.

republics. All of them are conducted in co1'xfm*mity to
written constitutions, adoptecl. by the people, in ea¢h,st,ate».
excepting in Rliode Island, \Vl1€I'(:‘ﬁtl1f3 ancient colonial"
charter is yet in force. I3:t«:l1 one has a legislative, execw
tive and judicial brancli, and its own modes of exercising
power in these several. departnients. The distinctions
existing among the state governments are found in the
qualiﬁcations of the electors, and of tlie elected; in the

origin and duration of office; in the limitations 0<f.1tha:

powers which may be exercised ; and in peculiar ,oconstit-
tutional provisions; and, especially, in the "character of
legisletsion in each state. The principal coiistimtiotial
provisions in the government of each’ state, are here given
as concisely as _I‘.()SSll)lt?. \ i

towns, in proportion to the number of inhabitants. To
be eligible, they must have been citizens of the United
States, five years, and resident in the state, one year. The
senate is composed of twelve members, chosen in districts.
Their qualiﬁcations are the "same as representatives, and
must be twentygﬁve ‘years of age. ,'I‘he_legislature is
elected annually, and meets the first VVedn"esday in Jan-
nary.

The executive consists of a governor, chosen annually
by the people, and a council of seven, chosen in conven-
tion of the house and senate. The qualiﬁcations of the
governor are the same as those of senators, except that he
must be thirty years of age. He has the power of ap-
pointment and pardon, and a qualified negative on legis-

ative acts. To vzegctzive an act, means the refusal of an
executive to sign a bill to which his assent is ne.ces~
sary in order to its becoming a law. V/Vhen, under
any circumstances, the executive assent is required,
he is said to possess an ctbsolztte negative. But if a bill
that has been negatived, may notwithstanding become a
law, by being 1'e-passed by a constitutional majority ofthe
legislature, the negative is said to be qztctliﬂed. This
power to negative. bills, is usually called the "veto power.
The governor may be removed by impeachment. The
president of the senate acts as governor in case of va«
cane .

Tlie judiciary consists of a supreme court, and county
courts. The judges of the supreme court are appointed
by the governor and council. They hold their oﬁces
during vgoodbehavior... There are two modes of removal

lprdvided by the constitution. First, by the governor and

council, on address of the legislature, in which a rnajority
of bath branches concurin» the opinion that a judge ought
to be removed. The other mode is by impeachment by
the house of representatives, and trial before the senate,

Judicial Department.

469. No government can be said to be complete in
which provision is not made for the effectual administra-
tion of justice. ‘ The end of all judicial power is, first, to
oblige citizens to do what they should do hetween. them-
selves, and to make reparation for wrongs; and, secondly,
to punish them for crimes, and offences against the com-
munity. It must therefore be of the first importance, that
persons possessing the soundest judgment, and unyielding
integrity, be always selected to exercise this power. To

470; The several courts constituting the judiciary of
the state"of- New York, are the following: court of errors,
court of chancery, supreme court, circuitcourts, courts
of common pleas and general sessions, courts of special
sessionsancl justices’ courts.

471. The court of errors consists of the president of
the senate, the senators, the chancellor, and the justices of
the supreme court. As a court of errors, its business is
to decide cases brought by appeal from decrees in chan-
cery, and by writ of error from judgments ofthe supreme
‘court. Upon questions affecting t-he merits of the cause,
or any point decided in either of the latter courts, the
chancellor or the justices, from whose decision the appeal
is brought, have no voice in afﬁrming or reversing the
decree or judgment. It has full power to correct and re-
dress all errors that may happen in those courts. The
judgment of the court of errors is remitted to the lower
court from which the appeal was brought, where procee-
dings shall be had to carry the appeal into effect. This
court also tries impeachments.

472. The powers of the court of clmcccery are vested
in the chancellor. Every circuit judge is vice chancellor
"Within the limits of his circuit, and has all the original

owers vested in the chancellor, in matters that arise in
“llis own circuit, or’ wherein the defendants, or either of
them, reside within it, subject, however, to the appellate
jurisdiction of the chancellor. And all appeals from any
order or decree made by a vice chancellor to the court of
errors, must ﬁrst be reviewed by the chancellor, and by
him reversed or afﬁrmed, except in cases wherein the
latter is interested. T

473. The original -intention of instituting this court, was
to supply the defects of the common law; and its jurisdic-

land, the vendor may sue at common law, and obtain dam»

will not execute a deed of conveyance, the same may be
done by a master in clrancery, of whom one or more are
appointed in every county, and who perform many other
duties, by order of, and as assistants to, the chancellor:
stating accounts, estimating damages, adrninistering oaths,
taking aﬂidavits, selling land, &c.

474. This court also, by z'njzmcti0n, prohibits persons
from doing acts that are against equity. A judgrnent
debtor may be restrained from disposing of his property“;
banks may be restrained from doing further businessiri

tions; proceedings in law may be stayed; persons may
be restrained from committing wastes or injury on lands”;
and many other like restraints are imposed, and protections
afforded, by injunction. The chancellor has the power
also of dissolving marriage contracts, and of decreeing
divorces. l V

476. Solicitors in cltttncery are in the nature of attor-
neysm courts of common law; they manage the pleadings,
prepare questions for witnesses, and do every thing that

is done ma cause where theparty does not appear in‘

person. Masters and examiners in chancery are appoin-
ted for every county in the state, by the governor. and sen-
ate, for the term of three years ; clerks are ‘appointed, and
solicitors are licensed, by the court. if

477. The ‘principal business of the sttp9'eme com! is to
review the proceedings of the lower courts, in cases that
have been brought before it by appeal. It holds four
terms annually. Issues involving sums in controversy
exceeding ﬁfty dollars, are joined in the supreme court.

478. The state is divided into eight senate districts; in
‘each of these there is a judge, who holds annually at least
two céarcztit co/tarts, and courts of oyer and terminer and
jail delivery, in every county. He has power, ant-l it is
his duty, to try issues joined in the supreme court; to
record all non-suits and defaults before him; and to return
the proceedings into the supreme court. His duty as
judge at the court of oyer and terminer, is to try crimes
and misdemeanors, committed or tri-able in the county.
He has power to try all indictments found in the court of
general sessions. Crimes and misdemeanors of the high-
est grade, are tried in this court.

479. A court of common ‘pleas, consisting of a ﬁrst
judge and four associate judges, is held in every county,
and has power to try actions arising within the county,
and all transitory actions, although the same may not have
arisen within the county ; and to hear and determine ap-

peals from justices’ courts, It has also the power to try

issues joined in the supreme court, as the circuit court.
Any three judges of the county courts have power to hold
a court of common pleas, or of general sessions of the
peace.

480. When a sufficient number of judges sh:tl1notap-
pear at a court of general sessions, justices of the peace
shallhe associated with a judge or judges. Thiscourt
has power to try and punish all crimes and misdemeanors
not punishable with death, or imprisonment for life; and
to send all indictments for offenctes not triable therein, to
the next court of oyer and terminer and jail delivery for
trial. The duties of this court are numerous. i

481». The salaries and compensation ofjudicial officers
are as follows: The chancellor and the three justicesof
the supreme courrhave a salary of $2500 each; the cir-
cuit judges, $1600 each; senators as members of the court
of errors, when the legislature is not in session, have the
same compensation as is received by members of the
legislature. Judges of county courts receive two dollars
a, day, during their attendance at court.

482. A court of special sessions, consisting of three
justices of the peace, or two justicesand one judge of the
county court, may be held for the trial of certain offences
against the peace.

483. For the administration of justice in the several
cities in this state, or most of them, special provisions are
made by law; and their courts are in many respects dif-
ferently constituted from those in the several towns and
counties in the state.

484. Juries for the trial of issues of fact are thus ob-
tained: The supervisor, town clerk and assessors ofthe
several towns, make a list of persons toserve as jurors,
who shall be free from all legal exceptions, of approved
integrity, of sound judgment and well informed. The
names of these persons are transmitted to the county c.ler‘k;
from which he draws, fourteen days before the holdingef
every court, the names of thirty-six persons to serve as
jurors, and any additional number that shall have been
ordered. The slips of paper on which the names are

written. are put into a box, and shaken so as to mix them
as much as possible; and they are then drawn out by the
clerk, in presence 0! the sherjﬂ" and a judge of thecounty.
The list so drawn is then delivered to the sheriff, who
summons thepersons named :.herein to attend the sitting
of L the court. These are called pet-it jurors, twelve of
«whom sit on every trial, and all must agree in order to
conviction or judgment.

485. Gramd jurors are obtained in the same manner as
petit jurors, ‘except that the list is prepared by the super-
visors at their annual meeting. Not’ more than twenty-
three, nor less than sixteen persons, are sworn on any
grand jury. One of their number is appointed by the
court as foreman, who administers the oaths to witnesses
appearing to testify before the jury. Every grand jury
appoints one of their number to be clerk. The minutes
are preserved and delivered to the district attorney, when
so directed.

486. It is not the business of grand juries to try issues.
They attend during the sitting of the courts, to hear com-
plaints that may be brought before them for breaches of
the peace, or for crimes; and declare whether or not the
person ‘complained of shall be put upon his trial. If
twelve of the jurors are of opinion that he ought to be
tried, the district attorney draws up an indrlctment, stating
the crime charged upon him. The foreman signs in be
half of the jury, and it is carried by the jury to the court.
The accused is then called to be put upon trial. If he

has never been arrested, a warrant is issued to arrest him;

and if he be not ready for trial he is put into prison, unless
he give bail for his appearance for trial at the next court.

damages claimed do not exceed ﬁfty dollars; excepting
that, in actions commenced in by atttachmeht of property.
wherein the damages claimed do not exceed one hundred
dollars, they have jurisdiction; and they may also take
and enter judgment on confession of a defendant for the
sum of two hundred and fifty dollars. But they‘ have no

power to try assault and battery, false imprisonment, slana. ’

der or malicious provocation; nor any matters wherein
the sum total of the accounts of both parties is more than
four hundred dollars. Any justice being a tavern keeper,
shall have no power other than that of issuing executions
upon judgments rendered by him before he became so
disqualiﬁed. A

488. Actions must be brought before some justice of
the town wherein either a plaintiff or defendant resides,
or of the town next adjoining. But if a defendant has
absconded, the suit may be brought beforea justice of the
town wherein the defendant or his property may be. If
the plaintiff or defendant be a non-resident of the county,
the suit may be brought in the town wherein the plaintiff
or defendant may be. ,

489. Either party thinking himself aggrieved by a
judgment rendered before a justice, for damages not ex-
ceeding twenty-ﬁve dollars, may remove the same by a
writ of ce/rtiamri, to the court of common pleas. And if
the judgment exceed that amount, the party to the judg-
ment may appeal therefrom to the said court. In a case
brought by certiomri, the judges act without jury, and
give their judgment upon the aﬂidavit of the party remov
ring the suit, and the return of the justice, in which the
testimony and proceedings before the justice are set forth.
Issues of fact brought up, on appeal, are tried by a jury.
or referred in the same manner as an original suit. Juries
are allowed in all cases in justices’ courts, if desired by
either party. «

490. FOR the more convenient administration of justice,
it has been found necessary to divide states of" any con-
siderable extent, into districts, with administrations adap-
ted to the management of their local aﬂiiirs. The first
grand division in these United States, is into counties, or
s/Li-2'63: these are again subdivided into towns. These
districts correspond to similar institutions in England, the
country of our ancestors.

491. A county or town, as a body corporate, has certain
powers and rights. A corpomtion or body politic, means
a number of persons formed or vlncorpomtert into one body,
with the power of acting under one name. The word
corporation is derived from the Latin, corptts, meaning
body. Corporations have a perpetual succession. For,
when the persons constituting a corporation shall have
passed oil‘) and been succeeded by others, the corporation
will still exist. Every state, county or town, as well as
every bank or turnpike company, acting under a common
name, by virtue of a public law, is a corporation.

492. Each county in the state has-a capacity to sue and
be sued; to buy and hold lands ‘within its own limits; to
buy and hold such personal property as may be necessary
to the exercise of its corporate powers; and to make
such orders for the regulation and use of itstproperty
asthe interests of its inhabitants may require.

493. The principal county olﬁcers are, the board of
supervisors, a, county treasurer, «a clerk, a sheriff, four
coroners, a surrogate, and a district attorney. '

494. The board of supervisors consists of the supervr
sors of the several towns in the county, who meet annually”
on a, day designated by law, which is, in most of the
counties, in the month of October or November; and they
may also hold special meetings whenever it may be no-
cessary. Their duties and powers are, to make orders
respecting the corporate property of the county; to ex~
amine and settle the accounts against the county, and to
order the raising of money to defray its expenses; to
provide for repairing the court house and jail, and ﬁtting
them for the purposes for which they are required. They
choose one of their number, at every meeting, to preside
as chairman, and appoint some proper person to be their
clerk, whose duty it is to record the proceedings of the
board, and to preserve and ﬁle all accounts passed upon
by the board.

495. The sorority; treasmer is appointed by the board
of supervisors, and holds his office at their pleasure. He
gives a bond, with sureties, for the faithful execution of
his duties. It is his duty to receive all moneys belonging
to the county, and all moneys belonging to the state, that
are by law directed to be paid to him; and to pay and
apply such moneys in the manner required by law, and
to render a. true account thereof to the board of supervi-
sors and to the comptroller of the state when required.

496. The county; clerk is elected by the people at the
annual election, and holds his ofﬂce for three years. He
has the custody of all the books, records, deeds, parch-
ments, maps and papers, relating to the business of the
office. He records, in books prepared for that purpose,

all deeds, mortgages, or other conveyances, and all papers

and documents required by lativ to he recorded. He also
files all papers required to be ﬁled in his office.‘ He ap-
points a deputy clerk, who is authorized to perform the do»

November, for three years’. they may not be reelected
for the next three; years. A sheriﬁ‘ is required to give a
bond, with sureties, in the penal sum of twenty thousand
dollars, for the faithful performance of his duties; and this
bond is to be renewed every year. He appoints an under
sherifﬁ who performs the duties of sheriff when the ofﬁce
shall be vacant, and as many deputies as he may think
proper. It is the duty‘ of the sheriff‘ to attend the sitting
of all courts held in the county; to serve all processes
directed to him by any of the state or county courts; to
have the custody of the jails and prisons, and the prison
ers in the same. Executions issued out of any courts in
the state, against the property of any person, are directed
to the sheriff of the county in which the person resides.

498. When a person has been slain, or has suddenly
died, or has been dangerously wounded, notice is given to
the coroner, who goes to the place where such person
shall be, and summons a jury to make inquisition respec-
ting such death or wounding. VVitnesses are also called,
among whom there is a physician or surgeon. The jury,
uponinspecting the body of the person dead or wounded,
and hearing the testimony, deliver to the coroner their

‘inquisition, in writing, stating in what manner the person
came to his death, or was wounded. If a murder or as

sault has been committed, the coroner binds over the wit-
nesses to appear and testify before the grand jury at the
next criniinal court to be held in the county. An exami-
nation of this kind, into the cause of a person’s death, is
called a coroner-’.s inquest. ~ Coroners also perform the
duties of sheriff‘, when vacancies happen in the offices of
both slieriﬁ‘ and under sheriff. .

will was executed as the law requires, he approves of it.
If there be no will, or none that is legal, he appoints an
administrator to dispose of the property, and settle the

estate. The person exercising the duties of surrogate, is;

in some states called a judge of probate. Probate is a
Latin word,meani»1rg proof; and is used in law to signify
the proving of a will. Surrogates, in this state, are~ap-
pointed by the governor and senate.

501. Towrsrs are made to comprise such portions of
territory as will admit of a direct participation in their
government by all the people. The government of a
town is therefore purely democratic. Towns are incor~
porated by a general law of the state; and their organi-

.zation is uniform, and their powers and privileges are the

same, throughout each state.

interests of its inhabitants may require. The electors of
atown have power, at their annual townrmeeting, to direct
money to be raised for town purposes; to estatblishvthe
compensation of certain town officers; to make regulations
as to fences; to direct what sum shall be raised in the
town for the support of common schools; and to perform.
sundry other acts that relate to their internal affairs.

5.03., A meeting of the citizens qualiﬁed to vote, is held
in each town in the state, on some Tuesday between the
ﬁrst Tuesday in February and the first Tuesday in May,
in each year, for the election of town oﬂicers. The officers
to be elected are, a supervisor ;. a town clerk; assessors, not
lessthan three, nor more than five; a collector; two over-
seers of the poor; three cornnoisioners, and three inspec-
tors of common schools; constables, not more than five;
a sealer of weights and measures; as many overseers of
highways as there are road districts in the town; and so
‘many pound masters as the electors may determine. All
the town oilicers must be elected by ballot, except the
sealer, overseers of highways, and pound masters; who
may be elected, either by ballot, by ayes and noes, or by
the rising and dividing of the electors, as the meeting may
determine. All the oflicers voted for by ‘ballot, shall be
named in the same ballot.

504. The sztpervisor receives and pays over all moneys
raised in the town for defraying town charges, except
those raised for the support of highways and bridges, of
common schools, and ofthe. poor, where poor moneys are
raised. He prosecutes for penalties of fifty dollars or
under; keeps accountof moneys received and disbursed

506. It is the duty of every member of the community
to contribute to its support and prosperity. This duty
results from the relations of men in civil society. Where-
soever this duty exists, there exists also, of necessity, the
right to enforce it. Taxes, to be equitable, ought to be
laid, not upon persons, but upon the property possessed or

‘used by individuals. It is upon this principle that taxa~

tion is founded in this country.

507. All lands, and all personal estate, are liable to
taxation in this state. Lax/tds, rest! estate, and /real prop-—

the names of, all taxable inhabitants, and the value of all
the real and personal property of each, deducting from his
personal propertythe debts owing by him. After the assess-
ment roll shall be completed, notices shall be put up in three
or four places in the town, stating that the assessment roll
is completed, and left with one of their number, to be de-
signated in the notice, where the same may be examined
by any of the inhabitants during twenty days ; at the ex-
piration of which time, the assessors meet at the time
speciﬁed to review their assessments. Persons who con-
ceive themselves aggrieved by too high a valuation of

, their property, make afﬁdavit of its true value; and the

the assessors then reduce their assessments accordingly.
509. The assessment rolls of the several towns in the

countyare examined by the board of supervisors at their

annual meeting; whose duty it is to equalize the value-

tions of one town with those of another. The tax is then

the assessment roll is then delivered to each of the super-
visors, who delivers it to the town clerk of his town, to be
kept for the use of the town, and another copy is to be
delivered to the collector of the town by the ﬁiteenth day
of December; to which roll is annexed a warrant, under
the hands and seals of the board of supervisors, command-
ing him to collect from the several. persons named in the
roll, the amount of ‘ tax opposite their respective names.

a 510. The collector, upon receiving the tax list and war-
rant. collects the taxes. If any person shall refuse or
neglect to pay the tax imposed on him, the collector shall

-«levy the same by distress and sale of the property of the

person from whom the tax is due. The collector is requir-
ed to pay out of the moneys by him collected, to the com-
missioners of common schools, overseers of the poor,
(where there is no poor house in the county,) commission-
ers of higliways, and the supervisors, the sums required
in the warrant to be paid to them; and the remainder is
paid to the county treasurer; the collector first retaining
the compensation to which he is entitled.

511. It is the duty of the 0’L"(37‘St’67'S of the poor, on ap-
plication being made to them for the relief of poor or
indigent persons, to provide for their support in the town;
or, in a county in which there is a poor house, for their
removal to the poor house of the county, to be supported
at the expense of the county.

5.12. The commissioners of /tigltwag/s have the care and
superintendence of the highways and bridges in the town:
and it is their duty to alter and lay out roads, and build
bridges, and to cause them to be repaired. They divide
the town into so many road districts as are judged con-
venient, and require the overseers of highways to warn all
persons in their respective districts to work on the high-

age of twenty-one years, residing in the town where the
assessment is made, may be assessed to work on. the high»
ways.

513. The commissioners of common schools divide their
town into school districts, number them, and deliver the
numbers and description thereof to the town clerk to be
recorded. They also apportion the school moneys recei-~
ved by them, among the several districts. Commission-
ers are authorized to serve as inspectors of schools.

514. The inspectors of common schools examine all
persons oﬁiering themselves as teachers; and if they are
satisﬁed as to the qualiﬁcations of a candidate, in respect
to moral character, learning and ability, they deliver
to him a certiﬁcate signed by them, stating that they
believe him to be duly qualiﬁed. It is also made their
duty to visit all the schools in their town, at least once a
year, to examine into their state and condition, and to give
their advice as to the government of the schools, and the
course of studies ‘tobe pursued in them.

515. The duties of a oo72,.s‘fa«bZ(£ are very numerous. '

His principal duties are, to serve all processes issued by
justices of the peace, of ‘a. civil and criminal nature, to
collect debts on execution, to aid in keeping the peace, and
to apprehend and secure criminals. He is properly an
executive officer, as his business relates to the execution of
the laws.

516. Four justztes of the peace are chosen in each
town in the state, (except in cities,) whose duty it is to

administer justice in the town in which they are chosen.

As these are judicial oﬂicers, their powersand duties may
be considered as more properly falling under the head of
“Judiciary,” or “ Courts of Justice.”

517. In this state, the election of all public oﬂicers by
the people at large, is by plurality; that is, the person is
elected who has more votes than any other, although he

‘has not a majority of the whole. In some of the states,

a majority of all the votes given, is necessary to a choice:
this is called election by majority/. It is objected to the
mode of election by plurality, that a candidate may be
elected by a minority of the voters, as is often the case
when there are three or more candidates. But it is be-
lieved that this objection is more than counterbalanced by
the diﬂiculty of effecting an election, which is often expe-
rienced where the majority system prevails. When par
ties are numerous, and nearly equally balanced, it is impos-

‘ sible to elect the candidate of either, while each adheres
‘to its own: and the consequence is, that such districts

sometimes remain for a long time unrepresented in the
state and national councils.

by election by ytlurality? What is election by majority? What are

CHAPTER I.
Of the Rights of Pe?f3’e;ns.-«Absolute Persanctl Rights.

518. The rights of persons are usually evonsidered to
be of two sorts, absolute and relative. By ctbsolttte rights,
are meant those vvliiteh belong to men as individuals or?
singletpersons, orita-htose which would belong to theirhpexﬁ
sons in a state of nature; and which every man is entitled-
to enjoy, whether out of society or in it. These rights
are resolved into the right of personal securi;ty,“?t'l1e ri'gh;.t
of personal liberty, and the right to acquire?‘and enjoy
property. Rights called rclcttiee are those. which are in:
oiclent to men as members of society, and as sttandingtin
various relations to eaeliother. L

519. But although a clistinctionclearly existetbeitweeen
these two classes of rights, it would _;eeem»~4thet they?*eme

supposes some existing relation between persons. Both
classes are therefore in some respects relative, and neither
is in all respects absolute. Yet, as the one class, being
found_ed in the primary, universal and permanent relations
of social nature, cannot be alienated by voluntary trans-
fer; and as the other class arises from the civil and do
mestic relations, which a man has the liberty and capacity
of forming and changing, they have been generally,‘ and
with a considerable degree of propriety, distinguished as
absolute and relative.

520. To protect rnankind in the enjoyment of their
rights, is the object of law. The law existing in this
country, by which the rights of individuals are securetl,
is the common law of Englrwtd, which was brought hither
by our ancestors. This law has been adopted, and de-
clared in force, by the constitutions of some of the states,
and by statute in others; and where it has not been so
explicitly adopted, it is nevertheless to be considered the
law of the l.and, in all cases in which it has not been
altered by statute or t1sag'e. ,

521. The absolute rights of personal security and per-
sonal liberty, were privileges peculiarly dear to English
freernen.» The colonists claimed these privileges as not»
ural and unalienable riglrts, of which they, as British
subjects, could not be cleprived. These rights were fre-
quently   asserted and declared during their colonial
dependence; and provisions most efFectnal,ly securing
these rights, have been transcriheid from the fundamental
acts of the British parliament, into our national and state
constitutions. ,[See cons. U. S. art. 1, sec. 9, clauses 2, 3;
art. 3, sec. 2,  3; sec. 3; amendments, art. 4, 5, 6, 7,8}

Q22. The personal security of every citizen is further
protected by the law by whiclt a man, on showing rea-_
sonable cause, may require his adversary to be bound to
keep the peace. And if violence has been conimitted,
the offender may be prosecuted in behalf of the state_,‘a'nd

punished; and he is also bound to render to the ,party ag~
grieved compensation in damages.   ‘

523. The law affords additional protection to thisright
by perrn,itt.ing a man to exercise the natural right of self-
defence. Homicide is pronounced justifiable in cases in
which it is necessary in self-defence, against a person who
comes to commit a known felony with force against one’s
person, habitation or property, or against the person or
property of those who stand in near domestic relations.
But homicide is not strictly jiustifiablee- in defence of a
private trespass, nor upon the pretence of necessity, when
the party is not free from fault in bringing that necessity
upon himself. L

524. Personal security includes the preservation of’ a
man’s good name from injury by slander or detraction.
The slander of a person by words, is a civil ‘ injury for
which damages may be obtained. The injury consists in
falsely and maliciously charging another with the com-
mission of some public oﬂ"en.ce, or the breach of some
public trust, or with any matter in relation to his trade or
vocation, Which, if true, would render him unworth of

employment; or with any other thing by which special

injury is sustained.   g

525. A slander communicated by writing or printing,
is calculated to have a wider-circulation, to make a deeper
impression, and to‘ become, more injurious. Words,
therefore, may be libellous if printed, which would not be
actionable if spoken. A libel is deﬁned to be a malicious
publication, in printing or writing, signs or pictures,
tending either to blacken the memory of one dead, or the
reputation of one alive, and expose him to public hatred,
contempt tor ridicule. And the law considers it a_ public
aswell as’ private injury, and makes the offeander both
liable to a priratesuit for damages, and answerable to the
state by indictment.

r 4526." It is the established principle’ of the English law,
that thetruth of the matter charged as tlibellous, cannot
be »she‘wn by way‘ of justiﬁcation; because, vvhether true
or false, it is equally dang rous tothe public peace: and
it is presumed that the pu lication is made with a mali~
cious ‘intent. i The j_udicial decisions seem to have estab-
lished the = same doctrine in this country, except where it
has been controlled by constitutional and legislative pro-
visions. T i '

527. But to give a wider ‘latitude to the liberty of the
press, special provision has been made in several of the
states by statute, and in others by their constitutions, in
favor of giving the truth in evidence in public prosecu-
tions for libels. The constitution of ‘ New York declares,
that the truth may be given in evidence to the jury; and
that if it shall appearvto the jury that the matter charged
as libellous is true, and that it was published with good
motives, and for justifiable ends, theparty shall be acquit-
ted. Public opinion in this country, seems to be pretty
generally in favor of this principle.

528. The opinion seems to prevail, that, in private ac-

tions for damages, the truthrmay, in all cases, be pleaded

in justification; inasmuch as private action rests upon the
injury ‘sustained. There exists, however, a contrariety of
opinion on this point; and indeed, it is not easy to per-
ceive any good reason for this distinction between cases
of public and private prosecution. Justice would seem to
require, that in either case, the object of inquiry should
be the good or evil intentions of the publisher.

529. The right of personal liberty is guarded with
equal‘ effect, by the national constitution, to xvhichthe
laws and constitution of every state must necessarily con~
form. Every restraint upon a’ man’s liberty, the law
considers an imprisonment; and whenever a person is

530. The statute of New York requires that the appli-

c09';m1,s, he cannot be reimprisoned for the same cause
but it is not deemedthe same cause, if the discharge was
granted for the Want of sufﬁcient proof, or for a defect in
some of the proceedings in the case. The law makes the
reimprisonment of a party duly discharged, a misdeme;ané

534. 'I‘m3 relation of husband and wife, as it is the
retest. important of the dornestic relations, will be first con-
sidered. Marriage, to be valid in law, requires the con-
sent of parties capable of contracting. No persons are ca-

pable of binding themselves in marriage, until they have

arrived at the of consent, which, by the common law
ofgthe land, 13 ﬁxed at fourteen years 111 males, and twelve

inlfernales. Idiots and lunatics cannot legally contract

marriage. -

 ‘No person can re-marry while the former hus-
band— oriwife is living. Such second marriage is null and
void, except in the following cases: when the husband ‘or
vvifetrf the party who re-marries, remains Without the
Unitedpstates for ﬁve years together, or when one of l the
married parties shall have absented from the other for five

that the other, who had been absent, was living within
that time; or when the person remarrying Was, at the
time of such marriage, divorced by the sentenceof a com-
petent court; or if the former husband or wife of the
party re-marrying; had been sentenced to imprisonment
for life.

535., In any but the above excepted cases, a second
rnarriage is not only void, but in most, if not allof the
states, it is a statute offence, punishable by im.prisonme:at.
Bigarny, more properly termed polygamy, is iIl=SOi¥11‘B
countries made a capital crime. '

537. Though no penalty applies to the cases above ex-
cepted; yet, if the former husband or wife be living,
though the fact be unknown, and there be no divorce cz
vii-nculo duiy pronounced, or the first marriage has not
been duly annulled; the second marriage is void. A

tie of marriage.” A ﬁnal divorce. W'here there is no
statute regulation, the principle of the common law in all
civilized and Christian countries, is, that nothing but
death, or a decree of a competent court, can dissolve the
marriage tie.

538. Marriage between near relations is unnaturealland
unlawful, as leading to a confusion of rights and duties:
but it is not easy to ascertain the precise point at which

the laws of nature have ceased to discountenance the...

union. The statute of New York declares marriage
between the ascending and descending lines, and betvsteerr
brothers and sisters of the half as well as of the vrholta
blood, to be incestuous and void; and to be ind»icta—blje
offences, punishable by irnprisonment. in a «state prison for

or subsequently acknowledged; or it may be inferred from
continual cohabitation and reputation as husband and
Wife.-.. Regulations have beenrnade by law, in some of
the states, for the due solernnization and proof of marriage;
but Where such provisions have not been made, the con-
tract is, in this country, under the government of the
English common law. -

540. A lawful marriage can be dissolved only by the
death ef_one of the parties, or by divorce. ln some of
the states, no divorce is granted but by a special act of
the legislature; in others. intolerably ill usage, or wilful
desertien, or unheard of absence, will authorize a decree
for a divorce.

541. The husband and wife are in law regarded as one
person; and the husband, upon marriage, becomes seised
of the freehold of his wife, and takes the rents and proﬁts
during their joint lives." It will be an estate in him for
his own life, if he dies before his wife; and in that event,
she takes the estate again in her own right. And if the
Wife dies first, and there be no children, her heirs succeed
in?une»diately to the estate. If there has been a child born

iaﬂive, the husband takes the esta.te for life, and on his

death, it goes to the wife or her heirs. During the con-
tinuance -of the life estate of the husband, he sues in his
own name for an injury to the proﬁts of the land; but
for an injury to the inheritance, the Wile must join in the
‘suit. .

542. The husband acquires, by marriage, a right to all
the chattels reel of his wife, as leases for years; and he
may, Without her, sell, assign, or otherwise dispose of the
same as he pleases; and they may be sold on execution
for his debts. If he makes no disposition of the chattels
real in his lifetime, he cannot devise them by will ; and
the Wife, after his death, takes them inher own right. ‘If
he survives his wife, he acquiresan absolute right to such

543. All other personal property also, belonging tothe
wife at the time of her marriage, becomes the property of
the husband; and on his death it goes to his representa-
tives. And he has power to sue for debts due to her by
bond, note, or otherwise, which are termed chases in ectiotr;
and when recovered, and reduced to possession, the money
becomes his own.

544. The husband is answerable for her debts before
covertureg. but if they are not recovered during coverture,
he is discharged. Cozzertzz/re is the condition of a married
woman, who, by the laws of; the land, is in the power of
the husband. If the husband dies before the debtstare
collected, his representatives are not liable‘, but the wife
remains liable after her husband’s death. »

545. The husband is bound to provide for his W'ife,:.&~he
necessaries suitable to her situation, and his condition in
life; and he is obliged to pay any debts which she may
contract for such necessaries: but for any thing beyond.
necessaries, he is not chargeable. If the husband aban-
dons his wife, or they separate by consent, or if he sends
her away and refuses to provide for her Wants; or, if she
be so treated as to afford reasonable cause for her to leave
his house; he is liable to fulﬁl her contracts for necessa-
ries, even though  should have forbidden persons to
trust her. If they live together, and the wife goes beyond
what is prudent and reasonable, the tradesman trusts the
wife at his peril.

546. A husband, dying in the lifetime of his wife, may,
by will, cuther off from allhis estate but a right of dow-
er; that is, the right to have, for life, the use of one third
of all the real estate which he owned during m.arriage.
and whereof she has not barred herself by joining with
him in a deed. A wife cannot devise her land by will;
but she may dispose by will, or by act in her lifetime, of

trust for her. A will made by a female while single,
who afterwards marries, becomes void.

»54 7. Settlements made upon a wife, in pursuance of an
agreement in Writing, entered into before marriage, are
valid both against creditors and purchasers. A settlement
after marriage may be good, if made upona valuable
consideration. A voluntary settlement after marriage,
upon a wife or children, without a valid agreement pre-
vious to the marriage, is void against creditors. But if
the person be not indebted. at the time, the settlement, if
made without fraudulent intent, istgood against after cred-
itors. ‘  

548. The husband and wife cannot be witnesses for or
against each other; but where the Wife acts. as her hus~
band’s agent, her declarations may he admitted in evi-
dence to charge the husband.

549. A wife has no remedy for ill treatment from her
husband till his conduct becomes criminal. And if she
can make eath before a magistrate, that she‘ is in fear of
personal violence, he may be required to give bonds to
keep the peace. But as the husband is the guardian of
theiwife, andbound to protect and maintain her, the law
gives him a reasonable superiority and control over her
person; and, if her conduct he sueh as to require it, he

may even put gentle restraints upon her liberty. t

550.” THE duties of parents to their children, as being
their natural guardians, consist in maintaining and edu-
cating them during the season of youth and infancy; and
the parent is obliged, during‘ the minority of the child,
which, in law, means infancy, or, of an age under tw,;en*-
ty-one years, to provide for his support and education;
and he may be sued for necessaries furnished under just
and reasonable circumstances. The .-father is bound, to
support his minor children, if he be of ability, even though
they have property of their own; but this pyyoblirgation, in
such a case, does not extend to the mother. 

551. Tl1e.,legal obligation of a father to maintainsh‘is
child, ceases as soon as the child is of age, unless 
child becomes chargeable to the public as a pauper; hat‘
the husband is not liable for the maintenance of the«ic3li5i‘5ltd
of his wife by a former husband, nor for the‘ support ‘of
his Wife’s mother. But if he takes the wife’s child into
his own house, he is responsible for the maintenance and
education of the child so long as it lives with him.

552. A father is not bound by the contract of his son,
even for articles suitable and necessary, unless an actual
authority be proved, "or the circumstances be sufﬁcient to
imply one; or unless a clear omission of duty on the part
of the father renders assistanceito the child necessary.
The father has a right to the labor or services of his chil-
dfen, and he may sue any other person for the value of
their labor performed for such person; The father is also

children. But courts of justice may, when the morals,
or safety, or. interests of the children require it,yWithdraW
infants from the custody of their parents, and place
them elsewhere. » .

55.4. The duties of children to their parents, are obe-
dience and assistance. In the absence of any authority
in the common law toenforce these duties, the Revised
Statutes of 1 New York have provided, that a parent may,
by will, disinherit his ungrateful children; and compel
the children, if they be able, to support and relieve their
poor, lame, old or impotent parents, who cannot maintain
themselves.   V y

555. Infants, or minors, can do no act to the injury of
their property, which they may not avoid or rescind,
when they arrive at full age. Minors who contract debts,
wi~l,l__be. obliged to pay them, if they promise to do so, after
shall have become of age. Contracts for necessa-
ries are binding‘ upon an infant ;and he may be sued..and
tchargedtin execution on such contract, provided the arti-
cles were necessary under the circumstances in which he
was placed. But if he lives with his father or guardian.
whose care and protection are duly exercised, he cannot
bind himself even for necessaries.

he. will be liable. for its payment when he arrives at his
majority. If he receives rents, he cannot demand them
again when of age. . If he pays money on contract, and

sideration.

557. The relation of guardian and ward is nearly the
same as that of parent and child. A father may dispose
of the custodyand tuition of his child during his minori-
ty, or for aless time, to another person, who thereupon be-
comes the guardian, and the infant is called war/rd. By the
statute of New York, a minor having no guardian, may,
at the age of fourteen years, apply to a surrogate for the
appointment of such guardian as the minor may nominate.
If ‘ the minor be under the age of fourteen years,‘ a rela-
tive or otherperson, in-his behalf, may so apply for the
appointrnent of a guardian. A guardian in sacwge, that
is, a guardian who has the custody of a Ininor’s property
as well as of his person, is required to keep safely such

558. By the statute of New York, male infants, and
unmarried females under eighteen years of age, Witshithe
consent of proper persons, may bind themselves, in Wei-
ting, to serve as apprentices to some art or trade; if males,
until the  of tWenty~one years, and, if females, until
the age of eighteen years, or for any shorter time. Con-
sent shall be given by the fatlier; or, if dead, or not in a
legal capacity, by the mother; and, if she refuse, or be
not in a legal capacity, then, by a guardian duly appointed;
or, if there be no guardian or other person, by the over-
seers of ‘the poor, or two justices» of the peace» of the town,
or a judge of the county court.

559. County superintendents of the poor may bind out
any child under the ages above speciﬁed, who may be

’ sent to thecounty poor house, or who is become charge-

able to the county. In all indentures, by the oﬂicers of
any town or county, binding poor children as apprentices
orservants, a covenant must be inserted to teach them to

master and apprentice, is supposed to contain the sub-
stance‘ of the English statute law on the subject.

l 560. The relation between a master and a hired ser-
vant, rests altogether upon contract. The one is bound
to render the service, and the other to pay the stipulated
consideratiton. But if the servantahiredr for a deﬁniteterm,
leaves the service before the end of it, without reasonable
cause, he loses his rightto wages for the period he served.
And he may be dismissed for cause, before the expiration
of"the term. The master is bound by the acts of his
servant, either in respect to contracts or injuries, when
the act is done by the authority of the master. If the
servant does an injury fraudulently, while in the employ-
ment of his master, both have been held liable in dama-
ges; and if a servant employs another servant to do his
business, and, in doing it, the servant so employed is guilty
of an injury, the master is liable.

qualiﬁcation or condition, and gives a right of succession
to» all the heirs generally, provided that they shall; be of
the blood of the ﬁrs’.t purchaser, and of the person last
seised. .

CHAPTER V.
Of Personal Propert7y~—-C0ntmct of Sale.

572. Peasonu. property is divided into chattels real
and personal. Chattels real concern the realty, as a
lease for years of land; and the duration of the time is
immaterial. It is only personal estate, if it be for a thous-
and years. There are, also, many chattels Which, though
of a movable nature, yet, being attached to the freehold,
and contributing to its value and enjoyment, go with it;
as the shelves and ﬁxtures in a house, and the posts and
rails of an enclosure. But many things are now treated
as personal property which seem, in a degree, to be at-
tached to the freehold. s i

573. It has been established asa general rule, that things
which a tenant has ﬁxed to the freehold, for the purposes
of trade or manufactures, may be removed, when the re-
moval does not cause any material injury to the estate.
Thus fats, coppers, tubs and partitions, belonging to a
soap boiler, have been removed. Chimney pieces, and
even Wainscot, put up by a tenant; or a cider mill and
press erected by him, may be removed, if it can be done

without materialinjury to the freehold. On the other i

hand, iron stoves, ﬁxed to the brickwork ofthe chimneys
of a house, have been adjudged to 'pass'‘' with thephouse
as a part of thesfreehold. The right of removailtdepends
upon the mode of annexation of the article, and the effect
which its removal would have upon the premises.

574. A title to personal property may be acquired in
various ways. A person has a right to all that his prop-
erty produces. Such are the fruits of the earth, the in-
crease of animals, and the increase of stock invested in

trade or manufactures. Property is also acquired by

one’s own act and power; as his literary property, con-
sisting of maps, writings and books, mechanical inven-
tions, produced by his intellectual and manual labor.
Goods and chattels are obtained also by transfer by act
oflavv; as by judgment on a recovery by law in an ac~
tion of trespass or trover; and by gilt, which, in some
cases, gives a valid title.

575. To give validity to a gift, there must be a deliv-
ery, at least so far as the subject is capable of delivery:
if the thing cannot be delivered, there must be an act
equivalent to it. The donor must part with both the
possession and dominion of the property. If the thing
given be a chase in action, the law requires an assign-
ment ancl the transfer'must be actually executed. And
gifts of goods and chattels, as well as of lands, with intent
to delay and defraud creditors, are void, as against the
person to whom the fraud would be prejudicial. All
deeds of ift,land all transfers or assignments of goods
or things in action, made in trust for the use of the per-
son making the same, are void, as against creditors, ex.»
isting or subsequent.   ’

q 576. It is a principle in law,that no man can be de-
rived of his property without his conssent; and that the
onest purchaser is not safe under a defective title. ‘No

l man can transfer to others the right to property whicihr he

does not himself possess. The title to property acquired
by theft or violence, does not pass from the true owner;

much discussed. lt,.is;_said to be, the English law, and the
cctmmoin law of this c.ou;ntry, thatthe townertcan receive
hisland by ejectment, without paying for the improve-
ments made upon it. The improvements are considered
as annexed to the freehold; and every possessor makes
such improvementsiat his peril. y p
578. Conflicting opinions have been expressed on this
point, in the courts ol7England, and of this country; and
statute provisions exist insorne. of the st.at,es, allowing, in
certain cases, to the occupant, compensation for the im-
provements. But these are pronounced, by the author of
Commentaries on American Law, encroachments upon

the rights of property,‘ as known and recognized. by the

common law of the land. And he further observes:
“’I*’here are but veryfew cases in which a person may

not, with reasonable diligence and cautious inquiry, dis~

eoverltwshether a titlebe clear orpclouded; and."let the
buyer beware.’\i.s a maxim of the common law whichis
exceedingly conducive to thesecurity of right and title.”

579. But private iproperty must, in some cases, be
made" subservient to the public welfare. If a public high»
way be out of t repaiyr, a passenger may lawfully go
through an adjoining private enclosure. It is lawful also,
to demolish houses to prevent the spreading of pa conﬂa-
gra;tion.y Theylegislatuyredlxats the control of private prop-

580. A tcontr,otct“is an agreement between two or more
persons by which the parties agree to do, or not to do, a
particular thing. , Contractssare ezcecutary when the stip-
ulations remain to be executed ;' or when one party agrees
to sell and deliver at a“ future time,‘ for a stipulated price,
and the other agrees to accept and pay. Uontracts are
express or implied. They are express, when parties
contract in express ‘words, or by writing; and implied,
when an act has been done whichshows that thefparties
must have intended to contract: as when a person em-
ploys anotherto do some service, it is (presumed that the
party employing intended to pay for the labor performed.

581. To rendera contract binding, there must be a
legal consideration: something must ” have been paid, or
something given or done, as an inducement to the fulﬁl-
ment of the contract. A contract to be valid, requires,
(1.) thatthe thing sold has actually existence, and is ca-
pable of delivery; (‘2.)~that a price be fixed, or suscepti-
ble of being ascertained ‘without further negotiation be-
tween the parties; and, (3.).that_ there be a mutual con-
sent of the parties to the contract, which is bindingwhen
a proposition made by one party is accepted by the other’.

i 582. In the sale of a chattel as one’s own ‘property, if

it be at the time in the possession ofanother, and there be it

no covenant or Warranty of title, the party buys at his
peril. But if the seller has possession of the article, and
he sells it as his own property, he is understood to War-
rantthe title. A fair price. implies a wawovtty of Jtiitzlc.

knowingly. to conceal no fault in any articlehe sells,
And if there be an intentional concealment or suppression
by one party of a material fact, in a case wherein the oth-
er has not equal access to means of information, the con-

tract is void. But when both have equal means of in-

formation, and neither says nor does anything to impose
on the other, a disclosure of facts is n.ot necessary to
make the contract valid.

584. When the terms of sale are agreed on-, and the
bargain is struck, the contract is absolute without the
actual delivery; and the property, and the risk of acci-
dent to the goods, vest in the buyer. He is entitled to
the goods on payment or tender of the price, and not oth-
erwise, when nothing is said at the sale as to the time of
delivery or the time of payment; for, though the vendee
acquires the right of property/‘V by the contract of sale, he
does not acquire the right of possession, until he pays or
tenders the price. B_ut if the goods are sold upon credit,
and nothing is said as to the time of del.iverin.g the goods,
the vendée is immediately entitled to the possession. ~To
make a contract of sale valid, theremust be a delivery,
or tender of it, or payment, or tender of payment, an
earnest given, or a memorandum in writing signed by
the party to be charged; and if nothing of this kind takes
place, it is no contract, and the owner may dispose of his
goods as he pleases.

585. The statutes of New York contain express pro-
visions on the subject of contracts. No agreement that

is not to be performed withinone year from the time of

melting it; no special ‘promise toanswer for the debt, de-

fault or miscarriage of another person; nor, an agree- i

ment or promise nponconsideration of marriage, except

mutual promises to marry, shall be valid, unless such-

agreement, note or memorandum’ thereoﬁ expressing the

property sold! 584; " does the buyers right of property com-*l

charged. Contracts for the sale of goods for the price of
ﬁfty dollars or more, are void, unless they be in writing;
or unless the buyer receive a part of the goods or eviden-
ces, or pay, at the time, a part of the purchase money."

586. To prevent fraudulent transfers of property, it is
provided that every sale or assignment of goods, byway
of security, unless actual delivery be made, or possession
changed, shall be presumed to be fraudulent, and shallbe
void as against the creditors of the vendor or assignor, or
against subsequent purchasers in good faith ; unless the
persons claiming under the sale or assignment, make it
appear that the same was made in good faith. =And- no
assignrnerit of goods and chattels, as security for any debt,
is valid as against the creditors of the assignor, or pur-
chasers in good faith; unless such assignment be under
seal, and ﬁled in the office of the town clerk of the town
in which the assignor resides; or in the county clerk’s of-
ﬂce, if there be one in the town. And the assignment
must be renewed at the expiration of one year from the
date thereof, and from the date of each renewal.

CHAPTER VI.
Of Bailment-Principal and Agerotw-Partnership.

587. THE wordbailment is from (mail, which is derived
from the Greek, to deliver, and is so called, becauseihy
means of it, the party restrained is delivered into the
hands of those that bind themselves for his fort‘hcorning.~
Bailment. in law, is a delivery of goods in trust, upon
agreement thatrthe trust shall be executed, and the‘5go‘ods
restored by the bailee, when the purpose of the bailment
shall have been, answered. A

only for gross neglect, or for a violation of good faith;
Grossyneglectis a‘ want of that care‘ which every man of
eommon sense takes of his own property. If a person
undertakes, without recompense, to do some act for an-
other in respect to the thing hailed; for instance: if he an-
dertakes to carry an article from one place to another,
he is responsible only for gross neglect, or a breach of

589. Whether a mandatary renders himselt: liabletfor
the,non-performance of agratuit-ous undertaliing, is a
question on which writers on common law differ in some
degree. But perhaps the prevailing opinion among us is,
that a mandatary, or one who undertakes to do an act for
another without, reward,., is not answerable for omitting
to dothe act, but is responsible only when he attempts
toldo it, and does it amiss. In other words, he is re—
sponsible for misfeasance, but not for nonfeasanee, even.
though special damages be averred.

590. If aperson loan to another for use without reward,
any article, as a horse, carriage, or book, and the arti-
cle be lost or destroyed, without blame or neglect imput~
able to the borrower, the owner must abide the loss.
But the borrower must apply the thing to the use for
Whi,ch,it was borrowed; and he mustnot keeptit beyond
the time limited, [nor permit another person to use it.

591. If property be pledged as secttritey for as debt or
errgagement, the pawn_ee_ is bound to take ordinary care,
and is answerable only for ordyinary neglect; and if the
 should then happen to be lost, he may, notwith-
standing, .rescr,rt, to the pawnor for his debt. If he de-,

592. There is another species of bailment, the"hirin‘gi

article with due care a1tfdrmodera~ction, and not to apply’
it to any other use, or detain itvfo-r a longer period‘ tharté
that for which it was hired; If the article be injured or
destroyed without any fault on the part of t the hirer, the
loss falls on the owner, for the risk is with him.

593; In cases where work or care is bestowed on the
thingtdelivered, for a recompense, the workman for hire
must answer for ordinary neglect of the goods bailed, 
apply a degree of skill equal to the undertaking; for *év~¥
ery man is presumed to possess the skill requisite to the
due e.xercise’of the art or trade’ he assumes. If be per-
forms the vt'o*rk unsltilfully, he is responsible in darnages;
As,‘ if a tailor receives cloth to be ‘made into a coat, he is
bound to perform it in a workmanlihe manner. “

594. Forwarding merchants are responsible for want
of good faith, and of reasonable care and ordinary dili»
gence, and not to any greater extent, unless the business
and duty of carriers be attached to their other cha'ra,cter.

595. But with regard ‘to innlteepers, the rule is more
strict. In general, they are.» responsible for the acts of
their servants, and for thefts, and are bound to take all‘
possible care of the goods and baggage of their guests,’
on the ground of the proﬁt they receive for their enter-
tainment: i But the in~nkee.per’is not considered. responsie‘

the owner be guilty offraud or imposition, as by conceal-

by treating the parcel as ofno value, he cannot hold him
liable for the loss of his goods. Carriers by water are
liable to the same extent as land carriers. But the rule-

598. Agency is founded upon a contract, express or
implied, by which one party entrusts to the other the
managenient of some business; and by which the other
assumes to do the business, andto render an account of
it. i The actsofa general agent, or one employed by an-
other to do his business of a particular kind, will bind
his principal, so long as he keeps within the general
scope of his authority, though he may act contrary to his
private instructions. But an agent, constituted for a par-
ticular purpose, and under a limited power, cannot bind
his principal if he exceeds his power, The special au-
thority. must be strictly pursued; and whosoever deals-
with an agent constituted for a special purpose, deals at
hisperil, when the agent passes the limits of his power.

he made the contract, and that he acted onhis behalf; so
as to enable, the party with Whom‘ he deals, to have re-
course to the principal, in case the agent had authority
to bind him. And if the agent even buys in his own
name, but for the principal, and without disclosing his
name, the ‘principal is bound, as well as the agent, .pro-
vided the goods some to his use. An agent, ordinarily,
has no -right, without express authority, toem ploy a sub-
agent to do his business, without the knowledge or con:
sent of his principal. ’

601. An agent has a right to retain possession of pro-
perty. until his demand shall be satisfied. This right is
called a lien. A ,.grene«ml lien is the right to, retain pr0--
perty for a general balance of accounts; but a pwrticular‘
lien is a right to retain it only for a charge on account of
labor employed, or expenses bestowed, upon the identical
property detained. This is a privilege given by law to
persons en gagecl in occupations necessary for the accom-
modation ofthe public. Upon this ground common catf-
riers and innlteepers have a lien on property intrust_ed to
them. A tailor has a lien upon the cloth put in his hands
to be worked up into a garment. But he cannot hold
it for any debt previously contracted. a

tion of the proﬁts of a farm. or tavern ;or a clerk or agent
may receive a portion ofthe profits of sales as a compen-
%tion for labor, without becoming a partner.

603. Parties must be jointly concerned in‘ the future
sale of their goods, in order to constitute a partnership.
A joint purchase, with a View to separate and distinct
sales byeach person on his own account, is not suﬁcxient.
Several persons, not having contracted together as part
ners, may, by a common agent employed f’or"the purpose,

{purchase goods in the name of one of them only, and di-

ship commences at the time when the shares are brought

Bills of E2:cItange—-—Promissory~ Notes--Bamlcs—--Inso«
mnce Companies.

609. A bill of exchange is a ‘written order orrequest,
from one person to another, to pay to a third person a cer~
tain sum of money. If A, living in New York, wishes
to receive $1000, which await his orders in the hands of
B, in London, he apples to C, going trom New York to
London, to pay him $1000, and take his draft on B for
that~As.um, payable at sight. This is an accommodation
to all parties. A receives his debt by transferring it to
0, who carries his money across the Atlantic, in the
shape of a bill of exchange; without danger of robbery or
loss; and on his arrival at London, he presents the bill
to B, and is paid.   A, who draws the bill, is the drawer;

B, to whom it is addressed, is the dmwee; and, on accep-

ting it, he becomes the acceptor. C, to whom the bill is
madepayable, is called the payee. As the bill is payable
to C, or Iris order, he may, by endorsement, direct the bill
to be paid: to D. In ‘that case ‘C becomes the eml*oa'ser,
and D, to whom the bill isendorsed, is called the endoorsee,

or holder. r

610 A check is, inform and effect, abill of exchange.
It is not a direct promise on the part of the drawer, to
pay, but he is answerable if the drawee fails to pay. , A

check, payable to beewrer passes by delivery, and the bear-
ejr may sue on it as on an inland bill of exchange.¥

611. No precise time isﬁxed bylaw for presenting
bills to the drawee for acceptance. A. bill payableat
a given time after date, may be presented at any,titne«be—
fore the day of payment; but if presented and acceptance
be refused, it is dishonored, and notice must then be giv-«
en to the drawer. A bill payable sixty days after sight.
means sixty days after acceptance; and such a bill, as
well as abill payable on demand, must be presented in ‘a
reasonable time, or the holder must bearethe loss proceed»
ing from his neglect. e

612. The acceptor of abill is the priincipal debtor, and
the drawer is the surety ; and nothing will discharge the
acceptor but payment or a release. if the acceptor alters
the bill on accepting it, and the holder consents to the
alteration; it is agood bill as between the holder and ac-
ceptor, but it is Vacated as against the drawer and endors~
ers.

613. A promissory note is a wri'tten~.promise to pay or
deliver toianother a sum of money. If it be made paya-
ble to him or his order, or to bearer, it is called negotia-
ble; and it may be sold or transferred to any other per-
son, who has the same authority to sue for andcollect
the money, as the original prornisee. Wl1en‘a note is.
payable to becwer, it passes Without endorsement; but
when it is payable to a person or his “order, such person,
the promisee, must endorse it by writing his-name on the
back of it, before any other person can receive that mon-
ey. If the name of the payee or‘ endorsee be left blank,
any cbonarﬁde holder may insert his own name, as payee,
The wordsvalae received are usually inserted in a note,.
but the‘ note is good without them.

614. If a bill has been accepted, demand‘ of payment
must be made when the bill falls due; and it must be
made by the holder or his agent upon the acceptor,at- the

him personally, if no particular place be appointed. The
acceptor is allowed three daysefter the bill falls due, to
pay ;, which are called days of grace. Three days of
grace_ap,ply also to promissory notes. A bill or note pay-
oableon demand, or in which no time of paryrnenttis ex-
pressed, is not entitled to the days of grace. .

_ 615. Ifthe third dayof grace falls on Sunday, or some
other day of publicrest, the demand of paytm,ent«-must be
made on the day preceding. If the tdernancl he not made
on thelast day of grace, the d.ra.\.,ver ofa bill, and endor«
sex‘ of ‘a note, are discharged. As to the particular

time of the day at which the demand must be made, it is
said to be unseasonable to demand payment before the
eigpiration‘, of the ‘day; but this question is governed, in a

degree, by the custom of the place; and if, in a. commer-
cialecity, payments are to be madeat the banks, demand
mu1st~bem.ade within bank h.o,urs.s

616. The holder of a note can recover upon it, though
h,e,rec,eived it of a person that had stolen or robbed itfrom
the a true owner; provided he toekoit innocently, in the
course of trade, for a valua,bleconsideration, and with
due caution, ,There are said to be but two cases in
which a bill or note is void in the hands of an innocent
endorsee orholder: one is wherfthe note is given for
money lost-at gamingfpand the other when it is given for
ausurious debt. p Uswry is an agreement, upon the loan

of money, to receive the same again with a greater inter- p

est than that which is ﬁxed by law.

617. >The acceptance of a, bill may be in writing, or
by parol. Pmol means, assurance given-by word. If a
person, in? writing, authorizes another to draw a bill, and

be purchased in consideration of the promise. In New
York, however, it is specially provided, that no accept?
anceis binding, unless it be i 11') writing. , 

“618. If a note he made payable inany species of prep~
erty other than cash, it is not negotiable. If such note
be not paid according to the conditions therein expressed,
the maker becomes liable to pay the same in cash. But
in either case, if it passes to a third person, he can sue
it only in the name of the person to whom it was ‘ex-
ecuted,who is allowed to oﬂset any account or claim which
he may have against the promisee. And any note, if it
be taken after it is become due, the buyer takes at his
peril; and the prornisor may offset against it any payment
which he may have made to the original holder.

619. That the drawer and endorsers of a negotiated
note or bill may be held responsible, the holder must show
that a demand has been made, or that due diligence has
been used to get the money of the maker of the note, or
the drawee of a bill; and he must also give reasonable
notice of their default to the drawer‘ and endorsers. The
object of thisnotice is to afford an opportunity to the draw-
er and endorsers, to obtain secur'ity from those to whom
the must resort for indemnity. The notice must be giv-
en liy the ﬁrst convenient, practicable mail that goes on
the day next to the third day of grace; or, it must at least

be put into the post office for that purpose, if possible. ,
Where the parties live in the same town, personal notice

must be given, or a special messenger must be sent to
the dwelling house or place of business of the party to
be charged. ,

620. Agents are appointed in all commercial places,
called notmies public. VVhen a foreign bill is to be pre-
sented for acceptance or payment, the demand is usually
made by a notary; andin case of refusal, his certiﬁcate
of the presentment of the bill, and of the refusal, is le al
proof of the fact in any court. This certiﬁcate is call ? a

protest, which means, for proof A protest must be not-
ed on the day of the demand; but it may be drawn up in
form at a future period. A bill drawn in one state, upon
a person in another, seems to be regarded as a foreign
bill requiring a protest.

621. But notaries may also demand acceptance and
payment of inland bills of exchange,and promissory notes,
and protest the same for nonacceptance or non-payment.
No protest, however, is legal evidence in court, except
in the case ofa foreign bill of exchange. Yet it is expe»
client, in many cases, to employ notaries, when evidence

p is to be preserved, because they are easily to be found-

When Wanted as Witnesses. And in the state of New York,
the original protest of such notary, under seal, is evidence,
in case of his death, insanity, or absence, so that his
personal testimony cannot be obtained. Notaries in this
state are appointed by the governor and senate wherever
the shall think proper.

3,22. B6577,/LS. The ﬁrst institution of this kind was in
Italy, Where the Lombard Jews kept benches in the mar»
ket places, for the exchange of money and bills; and bam-
co being the Italiian name for bench, banks took their ti=-
tle from this wor .

623. The ﬁrst banks are supposed to have been only
banks of deposit, places where persons deposited or laid
up their money for safe keepingtto be ready when called
for. Another species of bank isa bank of deposit and
discount. By discounting is meant the advancing of
money on bills of exchange, or on promissory notes due
at a future time, taking out of the sum the interest there-
on to the time when the note will become. due.

624. But banks in this country, differ materially at
present from either of those above mentioned. They ree
eeive money in deposit, and they discount notes; but in-
stead df paying gold or silver coin for such notes, they pay
in their own notes, on which they are bound to pay the
specie whenever demanded. These bank bills or notes

circulate as‘ money: hence our banks are called, banks 
cteposit, discount and circulation. A bank derives its

owers and privileges from acts of incorporation by the
egislature. It is a corporation composed of a number"
of individuals, who petition to the legislature to be ins-
corporated. The act grants and deﬁnes the powers of
the corporation, and expresses the amount of capital
which is to constitute the ‘fund on which the bank is todo
business, This capital is divided into shares, (usually
of $100 eac.h,) and sold; by which means the capital fund
is raised. The owners of these shares are called stock'-
holders, who choose from among themselves a’ certain
number of directors, (ordinarily t-hirteen,) who, from their
own number, choose a president. The president and
directors choose a cashier and clerks.

625. Banks are allowed to issue bills to a greater
amount than their capital’ stock. In the state of New
York, banks may issue bills and discount notes to two
and a halftimes the amount of their capital; which ren-
ders banking a proﬁtable business, as the stockholders
draw interest on a sum much greater than they have in-
vested. Every six months the profits are divided among
the stockholders. The sums thus divided are called div-
idends. If a bank cannot redeem all the bills it has issu-
ed, it is said to have failed, or to be broken.

626. In the state of New York, a fund is provided to
indemnify the holders. of bank bills against losses by the
failure ofbanks. This fund is raised under an act pass-
ed in 1830, imposing a yearly tax of one half of one per
cent. on the capital stock of the several banks, until such
tax shall amount to three per cent; and whenever this
fund shall become exhausted, taxation shall be again re-
norted to to replenish it. In some states the property, per-
sonal and real, of the stockholders, is pledged for the re-
demption of the notes of the banks.

the purpose of insuring persons against losses by ﬁre, -or
at sea, and sometimes on the risk of the duration of per-
sons’ lives; and they sometimes have the same powers and
privileges as banks have, in regard to the issuing of bills.
If a person wishes to be insured against ﬁre, he applies to
an agent. of the company, who takes a survey of the build-
ing and property to be insured. The rate of insurance
is then agreed on, -which is a certain sum, say 50, 75 or
100 cents for every $100 insured. The money paid for
insurance. is called premium; and the writing’ given by
the agent, in behalf of the company, to the person insur-
ed, expressing the terms of insurance, is: called a policy.

628. Companies for the insurance of lives, are Jess
common, Their purpose is to provide a fund for credit-
ors, or family connexions, in case of death. The insur-
er, either for a sum in gross, or in yearly payments,
agrees to pay a certain sum, or an annuity, upon the death
of the person Whose life is insured. Such cont.racts are
well calculated to secure relief to the members of a fami-
ly whose only dependence rests upon the life of a single
person.

CHAPTER VIII.
Of Crimes and their Punishment.

629. CRIMES made. punishable with death by the laws
of the state of New York, are, treason against the peo-
ple of the state; murder; and arson in the ﬁrst degree.

‘ Treason is deﬁned to be levying war against the people
of the state ;' a combination to usurp, by force, the govern-

when perpetrated by anyyact imminently dangerous “ to
others, and evincing a depraved mind regardless of hu-

and  the wounding of a person in a duel, though it be
‘alone outof the state, ‘Who sh-alldie in the state; and every
second engaged in such duel shall be guilty of murder.

631. Arson in the ﬁrst degree, is wilfully setting fire
to, or burning, in the night time, a dwelling house in

which there is, atthe time, some human being; and,

every house, prison, jail or other building, that shall
have been usually occupied by personslodging therein at
night, is deemed a dwelling house of any person so‘lodg-

ing a human being, vvithouta design to effect death, by
the act of another engaged in perpetrating, or attempting
to perpetrate a crime or misdemeanor not amounting to
felony; or in assisting another in committing self-murder.
Manslaughter in the second degree, is the killing of a hu-
man being, without a design to effect death, but in a
cruel, unusual manner; or in unnecessarily killing an
other, while resisting anattempt by such other person: to
clean unlawful act, or after the attempt shall have failed.
Manslaughter in the third degree, is the killing of anoth-

APPENDIX.

DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776-.

THE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE THIRTEEN
,UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

WHEN, in the course of human events, _it becomes
necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands
which have connected them with another, and to assume,
among the powers of t.he earth, the separate and equal
station to which the laws of nature and of nature’s God
entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind
requires that they should declare the causes which impel
them to the separation. « _

We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator
with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure
these rights, governments are instituted among men, deri-
vingtheir just powers from the consent of the governed;
that whenever any form of government becomes destruc-
tive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or
to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its
foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers
in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect
their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will die-
tate, that governments long established should not be
ghanged for light and transient causes; and accordingly
all experience hath shown, that mankind are more dis-
posed to suffer while evils are sufferable, than to right
themselves by abolishing the forms to which the are ac-
customed. But when a long train. of abuses an usurpe-

252 DECLARATION

tions, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a de~
sign to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their
right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and
to provide new guards for their future security. Such
has been the patient sufferance of these colonies; and such
is now the necessity which constrains them to “alter their
former systems of government. The history of the pres-
ent king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries
and usurpatioins, all having in direct object the establish-
ment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove
this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.

He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome
and necessary for the publiegood. _

, He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of imme-
diate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their
operation, till his assent should be obtained; and when
so suspended, he has utterly‘ neglected to attend to them.
He has refused to‘ pass other laws for the accornmodation
of large districts of people, unless those people would re-
linquish the right of representation in the legislature--
a right inestimabsle to them, and formidable to tyrants
only ‘

He has called together legislative bodies at places unu-
sual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of
their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing
them into compliance with his measures.

"He hasdissolved representative hot;-sesrepeatedly, for
opposing, with manly ﬁrmness, his invasions on the rights
of the people.

He has refused, for along time after such dissolutions,

t tocause others to bevelected; whereby the legislative pow-

ers ‘incapable of annihilation, have returned to the peo-
pleat large, for their exercise, the state remaining, in the
mean time: ‘exposed to all thedangers of invasion from

iwithout, and convulsions within.   a

He has endeavored to prevent the population of these
states; for that purpose obstructing the laws for natural-

’ ization of foreigners; refusingto pass others to encouifpaige

their migration hither, and raising the condition iof“itxew
appropriations of lands.

or INDEPENDENCE. 253

He has obstructed the administration of justice, by re-
fusing his assent to laws for establishing judiciary pow-
ers. , .

He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for

the tenure of their ollices, and the amount and payment

of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hith-'

er swarms of ofﬁcers, to harass our people, and eat out
their substance. ,

He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing ar-
mies, without the consent of our legislatures. ,

He has affected to render the military independentof,
and superior to, the civil power. ,

He has combined with others to subject us to a juris-
diction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged
by our laws, giving his assent to their acts of pretended
legislation : 1 j

For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us A:

For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punish~
ment for any murders which they should commit on the
inhabitants of these states:

For cutting off‘ our trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing taxes on us without our consent:

For depriving us, in many cases, of the beneﬁts of trial
by jury: , t

For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretend-
ed offences: L

For abolishing the free system of English iaws in a.
neighboring province, establishing therein an arbitrary
government, and enlarging its boundaries, so as to rem-

der it at once an example and ﬁt instrument for int1'od»ue-

ing the same absolute rule into these colonies:

For taking away our charters, abolishing our rnost
valuable laws, and altering," fundamentally, the forms of
our governments: » , r e

For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring

themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all

 Wbatsoeyer.     .
, ihasabdicated government here, by declaring us out
of’i".his7‘ptotect1o,n, and waging war against us. i

25¢ rrzcttsnarroit

He has plundered our seas, ravaged‘ our coasts, burnt
ourtowns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign
mercenaries to complete the works of death, desolation
and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruel»
ty and perﬁdy, scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous
ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on
the high seas, to bear arms against their country, to be-
come the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to
fall themselves by their hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections among us, and
has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers
the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of War-
fare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes
and conditions.

In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned
for redress in the most humble terms: our repeated peti-
tions have been answered» only by repeated injury. A
prince, whose character is thus marked by every act
which may deﬁne a tyrant, is unﬁt to be the ruler of 1
free people.

Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British
brethren. We have warned them, from time to time, of
attempts by their legislatureito extend an unwarrantable
jurisdicttion over us. We have reminded them of the cir~
cumstances of our emigration and settlement here. ’ We
have appealedto their native justice and magnanimity, and
we haveconjured them by the ties of our common kindred
to disavow--these usurpations, which would inevitably in-
terrupt our connexions and correspondence. They, too,

have been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity.

We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which de
nounces our separation, and holdthem, as we hold’ the
rest ol mankind——-enemies in war, in peace friends.

We, therefore, the representatives of the United State:
of \A’;m'erica, in general congress assembled, appealing to
the Supreme Judge of the world, for the rectitude of our
intentions, ' do,’ in the name, and by the authority, of the
good people of thesecolonies, solemnly publish and declare,

or xxmzrtmmncn, 255

that these unit‘ed‘colonies are, and of right ought’ to be, free
and independent states; that they are absolved from all alle-
giance to the British crown, and that all political connex-
ion between them and the state of Great Britain is, and
ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as free and in-
dependent states, they have full power to levy war, con-
clude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and do
all other acts and things which independent states ma of
right do. And for the support of the declaration, with a
ﬁrm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we
mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes,
and our sacred honor. A

LANDLORD AND Tnsnnr. 293

RIGHTS on LANDLORD AND TENANT.

Every contract for leasing for a longer period than one
year, or for the sale of any lands, or any interest in lands,
is void,unless the contract, or some memorandum there-
of, expressing the consideration, be in writing, and be
subscribed by the party by whom the lease or sale is to be
made, or by an agent lawfully authorized.

Leases for a term exceeding three years, in order to be
valid, must be recorded in the same manner as conveyan-
ces of real estate, except in the counties of Albany, Ulster,
Sullivan, Herkimer, Dutchess, Columbia, Delaware and
Schenectady.

Every conveyance of any estate orinterest in lands, or
the rents and proﬁts of lands, andevery charge upon lands,
or upon the rents and proﬁts thereof, made or created,vvith
intent to defraud prior or subsequent purchasers for a val-
uable consideration, shall be void, as against such pur-
chasers. A

l{Vhenever there is a tenancy at Willor by sufferance
created, by the tenant’s holding over his term, or other-
wise, the same may be terminated by the landlord’s giving
one month’s notice in writing to the tenant, requiring him
to remove therefrom.

Such notice shall be served by delivering the same to
such tenant, or to some person of proper age residing on
the premises; or if the tenant cannot be found, and there
be no such person residing on the premises, such notice
may be served by afﬁxing the same on a conspicuous part
of the premises, where it maybe conveniently read.

a At the expiration of one month from the service of such
notice, the landlord may re-enter, -or maintain ejectment,
or proceed in the manner prescribed bylaw, without”any
further or other notice to quit; , A

If a tenant shall give notice of his intentien to quit the
premises, and shall not accordingly fdelivetrtuptthe posses-
sion thereof, at the time speciﬁed inlthenotice, such ten-
ant, his executors or administrators, shall thenceforwa-rd

‘Q94 LANDLORD AND TENANT.

pay to the landlord, his heirs or assigns, double rent,
which shall be continued to be paid during the time the
tenant shall continue in possession.

If a tenant for life or years shall wilfully hold over any
lands or tenements after the termination of such terms, and
after demand made, and one- month’s notice duly given,
he shall be liable to pay to the person kept out of posses-
sion, or his representatives, at the rate of double the year-
ly value of the lands or tenements so detained, for the time
he shall so hold over; and he shall also pay all special
damages to which the person kept out of possession shall
be subjected by reason of such holding over.

  When any certain services or certain rent reserved out
of any lands or tenements, shall not be paid when due, the
person entitled thereto, may distrain for the same. But
no distress may be made for any rent for which a judg-
ment has been recovered in a personal‘ action.

’ A landlord may secure rent due, when any goods or
chattels liable to distress tor rent are seized under execu-
tion, by giving notice, at any time before the sale of the
goods by virtue of the execution, either to the party in
whose favor the execution shall be issued, or to the om-
cer holding, the same, of the amount claimed by the land-
lord to be due, and the time during which it accrued; and
by accompanying such notice with his own affidavit, or
that of his agent, of the truth thereof.

Upon receiving the notice and afﬁdavit, the oﬁicer hol-
ding the execution, shall levy the amount of rent claimed
to be due, in addition to the sum directed to be raised on the
execution, and shall pay the same to the landlord; but the
amonntof rent to belevied shall not exceed one year’s
rent. If there be a deﬁciency of goods and chattels to sat-

isfy both the executionand rent, the amount levied shall
‘beiiﬁrst appged to the satisfaction of the rent; and the re-

; mai-nder s

ll be applied upon the execution. ,

i" p " Ifatenant against vvhomgan execution is issued, shall

deny that rent isdue to his landlord, as claimed, he may
revent the levying thereof; by virtue of such execution,

* ydeliaverzing to the officer holding it, a bond, with two

suﬂicient sureties, executed to the landlord, in a penalty

LANDLORD AND TENANT. 295 h

of double the amount of rent claimed, with a condition
that all rent due shall bepaid, not exceeding one year's
rent or the premises.

If a landlord, under the foregoing provisions, claims
more rent than What is due to him, and if the excess be
collected, the tenant may sue for and recover of the land-
lord, double the amount of such excess. And in all cases
in which rent is pretended to be due, when none is due,
the owner of goods distrained may recover against the
person so claiming, double their value.

An officer making a distress for rent, must. give notice
thereof, with the cause of the distress, the amount due, and
an inventory of the articles taken, by leaving the same
with. the tenant, or in case of his absence, at the chief
mansion house, or at some other notorious place on the
premises.

At the expiration of ﬁve days from the ‘day on which
the notice was served, if the amountof rent due, with
costs of distress, be not paid, and the goods distrained be
not replevied, the ofiicer shall summon two disinterested
householders, who, under oath administered by the otﬁcer,
shall appraise the goods and chattels distrained, and {state
the same in writing.

Upon the appraisement being made, the oﬂicer ‘shall
give five days’ notice of sale, by affixing such notice on a
conspicuous part of the premises, and in two publicplaces
in the town; and on the day, and at the place, appointed,
he shall sell the goods at public aution at the best price
that can be obtained; and apply the proceeds to the satis-
faction of the costs and rent, and pay the surplus, if any, to
the owner of the goods. a

If distress be made for rent justly due, any irregularity
or unlawful act afterwards done by the party distressing,
shall notrender the distress unlawful; but the party vag-
grieved may recover for the special damages iszustafiiield
by such irregularity or unlawful act, with costssofrsuit; V

Every person entitled to any rentsﬁdependrent uponthe
life of any other, may, ‘notwithstanding the death of such
other person, have the sameremedy by action or by adie-
tress, for the recovery of all arrears of such »rent,.tthax

296 LANIILCIRD. AND 'I'ENANT.

shall be behind and unpaid at the death of such other
person, as he might have had if such other person was in
full life. 4

If a tenant for life, who shall have rented any lands to
another, die on or after the day I when any rent became
due, &his‘executors or administrators may recover from the
undertenant the Whole rent due: if he die before the day
on which the rent is to become due, they may recover the
proportion of rent which accrued before his death.

When a tax on real estate shall have been collected of
an occupant ’or§'tenant, and the tax ought to have been
paid by the landlord or any other person, the occupant or
tenant may recover, by action, the amount of su.ch tax, or
retainthe same from any rent due or accruing from him
for the land so taxed. ‘

Whenever a half year’s rent or more shall be due, and
no sufficient distress can be found, the landlord may

bring, an action of ejectment for the recovery of the pre.mi~

ses: But the tenant may, at any time before judgment,
stay proceedings, by tender of all the rent, and all costs
and charges incurred by the lessor. ‘

At any time within six months after a landlord shall
have taken possession of the premises recovered in action
of ejectment, the premises shall be restored to the tenant
or lessee, on payment or tender to the landlord or lesser,
of all rent in arrear, and all costs and charges incurred by
the lessor.  

If a tenant in arrear for .rent shall desert the premises,
without leaving thereon any goods subject to distress, any
justice of the peace of the county may, at the request of
the landlord, view the premises, and on being satisfied
that the premises have been deserted, he shall aﬁix a no-
tice upon a conspicuous part of the premises, requiring
the tenant to appear and pay the rent due, at the time s pe-
Ciﬁi3dTiIl the notice, not less than ﬁve, nor more than twen-
ty days, after the date thereof.   t

At the time speciﬁed,‘the justice shall again -view the
prelmiaes; and if the tenant ‘appear and deny that rent is

  tie‘ to the landlord, all proceedings shall cease. If the

tenant,or some one for him, shall not appear, and pay the

LANDLORD AND ‘TENANT. 297

rent, and there shall not be sufﬁcient distress on the prem-
ises; then the justice may put the landlord into posses-
sion of the same. ‘ , .

The goods and chattels of a tenant may be distrained
after they shall have been removed from the premises,
whether the removal be made before or after the rent shall
become due. If the rent be due at the time of‘ the remo-
val, or shall become due within thirty days thereafter, the
goods may be seized within the said thirty days after such
removal. If no rent be due or become due within that
time, then the seizure may be madeat any time within
thirty days after the rent shall become due; provided
such seizure be made Within six months after the removal
of the goods: but no goods shall be liable to be seized
which shall have been previously sold, in good faith, and
for a valuble consideration, to a person not privy to such
fraudulent removal. i V

Anytenant or lessee who shall remove his goods from
any demised premises, either d before or after any rent
shall become due, for the purpose of avoiding the payment
of such rent; a and every person who shall knowingly as-
sist such tenant or lessee in such removal, or in conceal-

ing any goods so removed; shall forfeit to the landlord of

the demised premises, his heirs or assigns, double the val-
ue of the goods so removed or concealed. r

Personal property deposited with a tenant, with the con-
sent of the landlord, or hired by such tenant, or lent to him,
with the like consent, shall not be distrained for any rent
due to such landlord. And property belonging to any
other person than the tenant, which shall have accidental-
ly strayed on the demised premises, or which shall be de-
posited with a tavern keeper, or Withthe keeper of any ware
house, in the usual course of their business, or deposited
with a mechanic or other person, forth-e purpose of being
repaired or being manufactured, shall not be subject to
distress or sale for rent; but the officer making the dis-
tress, shall not be liable for seizing or selling property not
belonging to the tenant, unless previous notice shall have
been given him of the claim of a third person.

Distress for rent shall be made by the sheriff of the

298 LANDLORD AND TENANT.

county, or one of his deputies, orby a constable or mar-
shal of the city or town wherethe goods, are, who shall
conduct the proceedings throughout.

No distress shall be driven out of the town where it
shall be taken, except to a pound within the same county,
not above three miles distant from the place Where such
distress shall have been taken. All beasts, or goods or
chattels taken as a distress at one time, shall be kept, as
near as may be, in the same place.

An ofﬁcer may not make distress for rent, unless the

warrant of distress be accompanied by an aﬂidavit of the

landlord, or his agent, specifying the amount of rent due,
and the time for which it accrued.

-Within ten days after the sale of goods for rent, or after
they shall have been replevied, the oﬂicer is required to
ﬁle the original warrant of distress, with the original aﬂi-
davit of the landlord, in the oﬂice of the town clerk. In
the city and county of New York, in the city and county
of Albany, in the cities of Troy, Hudson and Schenec-
tady, such warrant and afﬁdavit shall _be ﬁled in the office
of the clerk of the county. Any officer violating this pro-
vision, shall forfeit ﬁfty dollars to the person whose prop-
erty shall have been distrained.

All distresses for rent shall be reasonable; and whoso-
ever shall take an unreasonable distress, shall be liable to
an action on the case, at the suit of the party aggrieved,
for the d arnaeges sustained thereby.

PRACTICAL onsnnvmrrons. 299

PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS.   C

It has been asserted by the advocates of‘ monarchy, that man
is not capable of self‘-government. Because all former experi-
ments at Free government have proved unsuccessful, it is predict-
ed that the free institutions of'this country will be of short dura-
tion. And, from the tallibility of man, and the presumed im-
perfection of all human governments, not a few ofthe friends
of liberty even, have indulged apprehensions of the inevitable
dissolution of our political system. ‘ i _

But it should be remembered, that our government differs es-
sentially, both in its origin and“ principles, from any that has
preceded it. Whereas others have been the result of more
chance, or of’ unavoidable necessity, ours is the contrivance of
an assembly of men, not surpassed, probably, in point of wis-
dom and exalted patriotism, by any political body ever assembled.
These men, aided by the light of their own experience, and the
history of other governments, deliberately planned a. system of
government, under which those comparatively feeble states have,
in less than halfa century, become a most powerful and increas-
ingly prosperous nation—-a system which conimandﬁs the ad-
miration ofthe friends of freedom throughout the world.

The principles upon which our governmentis f'ounded,are the
immutable principles of JUSTICE and TRUTH. It was the grand
sentiment of those who ﬁrst declared the colonies to be free and
independent states, that all justpower in any government is de-
rived from the governed: and this sentiment has been recogniz-
ed, in a remarkable degree, in the form of governmeont which
was subsequently adopted. The constitution distinctly ackowl-
edges the people to be the source of political power, and invests
them with the exclusive right of exercising it.

A distinguishing characteristic of our constitution is, theex-

treme care with which it guards the rights of the people against a

infringement by oﬂicial power. The ruler is the servant, “not
the master, of’ the people. He is made accountable tothem
for his acts, and holds this power at their will and pleasure. i

Another excellence of our system consists in the division and
distribution -of the civil power among the several branches of the
government, legislative, executive and judicial ;-and!‘ in ‘the ef-
fectual guards provided by the constitution, to’ protect teach
branch, in the exercise of its functions, against enc-rue-hrnent
by the others. *

 PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS.

Civil and religious liberty is gnarantied by our constitution,
in the fullest extent. » The right of personal liberty, the right
ofpersonalsecurity, and the right to acquire and enjoy property,
could not have been more effectually secured. The constitution
breathes throu hout the spirit of liberty. Civil and religious
freedom are eﬁectually secured, both by the national and state
constitutions.

Equality is a prominent feature of our government. Equal
rights and privileges, sofar at least as the constitution is capa-
ble of conferring them’, are enjoyed in this country. No distinc-
tions are created by birth or property. The rich and poor, as it
regards political power, are placed on the same level.

‘But the excellence of our system of government affords, of
itself, no effectual security for its permanence. No human in:
stitution, whatever may be its qualities, contains, within itself,
the principle of sclfi preservation. It would be unwise,therefore,
to trust to the intrinsic excellence of our institutions. It is the
duty of everycitizen to watch the approaches of danger, and to
apply the means necessary to the preservation of our liberties.

Among; the dangers to which our government is exposed, are
the indifference and apathy ofthe people. It is a common max-
im among the people of’ this country, that “ the price of liberty
is eternal vigilance ;” and the acknowledged truth of this maxim,
as well as the venerable source from which it originated, com.
mends it to universalobservance. Open assaults upon our free
institutions can never be successfiil ; V‘ and they are not to be ex-
pected. If our political fabric ever fails, it will not be by the
hands of the avowed enemies ofliberty ; but by the insidious at-
tacks of its pretended friends, whose real motives will be conceal-
ed under professions of‘ regard for the public good.

Power, wherever’. it is exercised, is ever liable to abuse. To
the people is reserved the right to apply the corrective. But it‘
there be no disposition to apply it, the remedy is of noavail.
Political power is given to the people to be used; and he who
neglects to do so, violates an important trust. Bad laws in a
free government cannot long exist, but by the consent of the
people themselves. Bad men are ever ready to exercise their
rights, while many of our best citizens slight their privileges.
But he who has a proper sense of his duty, will on every occa-
sion cast his power and inﬂuence into the scale of the govern-
ment; and that citizen who refuses, to perform his duty in this
respect, does, tacitly at least, consent to the disorders that
prevail in the body politic. .

breast; and there are not wanting those in our ‘country, who,
though among the loudest in their protestations of attachment to
republican principles,’would march over the liberties of the peo-
ple, tosecure the power and honors of royalty. V

Anothersource of danger is the spirit of party. The opinion is
often expressed, that parties hold a salutary check upon each
other, and that their existence gives security to our political in-
stitutions. But it must be evident to all who have observed
the effects of party spirit among us, that the evils ﬂowirlg from
it overbalauce all the good whichit can produce. Where free-
dom of opinion and of speech is tolerated, parties must necess-
rily exist to some extent; but their existence should be founded
upon d‘iii’r‘erence of’ opinion merely.

But party spirit, when unrestrained, becomes intcmperate
and revengeful; and it is then that its pernicious effects are
seen. Parties, while contending for power, forget right, and
lose sight of the public good. The rights of the minority are
disregarded. Men, for difference. of opinion, are made the
subjects of prescription and persecution. In this state ofthings
the strife is for men, without regard to principle; and candidates
for public favor. who can hold out the most powerful inducements
to their supporters, are most certain of success. And our period-
ical elections, instead of enabling the people to correct abuses,
will prove a fruitful source of difﬁcnlty and contention.

The following paragraphs, from the pen of‘ the revered VVash-
ington, are given in conﬁrmation ofthe above remarks:

“Party spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature,
having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It
exists under different shapes in all govern ments, more or less sti.
ﬂed, controlled, or repressed ; but in those of the popular form, it
is seen inits greatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.

“ The alternate domination of one faction ‘over another, sharp-
ened hy the spirit of‘ revenge natural to party dissension, which
in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid
enormities, is itself a frightful despotism‘. But this ‘leads at length
to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and
miseries which result, gradually incline the minds of men to seek
security and repose in the absolute power of an ’individ"ual ; and,

sooner or la‘ter,the chief of some prevailing faction, more ‘able  

or more fortunate than his competitors, turns thjisdisposition to
the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins ot",pubiic liberty.

age and restrain it.” e

382» PRACTICAL OBSERVATIONS.

Let it not be:-supposed that there exists no cause for present
apprehensions of danger to our free institutions. A spirit of in-
subordination to the constituted authorities and laws of the land,
already prevails to no inconsiderable extent. Of the effects of
this spirit, our country has witnessed some deplorable exhibi.
tions. The right of trial by jury has been infringed. Punish-
ment for alleged crimes has been inﬂicted, without having been
preceded by even the forinslof a legal trial. The right of‘ the peo.
pie to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, has
been violated. The right of persons freely to speak, write and
publish their sentiments on all subjects, has been assailed; not,
as yet, by the enac.ment of any law to restrain or abridge the
liberty of speech and ofthe press; but under such an implied
sanction of public sentiment, as to authorize the presumption,
thatsuch a law would meet the hearty approval of a large por-
tion of community. _

The indifference with which these infractions of the laws of
the land are regarded, evinces a disordered state of the public
mind, which is ominous to the liberties ofthis country. When
outrage and crime are permitted to go unpunished, there can be
no security to life or property. And whenever there shall cease
to be’ virtue in the people sufﬁcient to vindicate the laws, and
maintain their supremacy, liberty will not long survive.

The most effectual security against tlieﬁe and other dangers to
which the government is liable, is an en ghtened and virtuous
public sentiment. This is,'perliaps, the only enduriiigsupport to
a Free government. To enlighten the public mind has ever been
considered the surest means of‘ perpetuating the blessings of‘ civil

/and religious freedoin. Ignorance and liberty cannot long sub-
sist togeétlier; for when men do not understand the rights which
the government confers, they are incapable of maintaining these
rights,.or of detecting the artiﬁces of crafty and designing dema-
gogues, who seek to attain their sinister objects by misleading
an deceiving the ignorant. ,

which the people of these United States are to transmit the bles-
si_.ngs,of liberty to their descendants. It gives strength and sta-

nation, depends upon the preservation of these institutions. Un-
less this be done, it is not to be expected that the welfare of
their country will be to them an object of deep solicitude. Those
who have never learned to appreciate the privileges enjoyed un-
der a free government, cannot be presumed to feel it their duty
to submit to any great sacriﬁces to preserve them.

It is highly important that this principle be inculcated in early
ly life. The great mass of our young men have grown up and
come to years of maturity, without having had their attention cal.
led to this subject. They commence their political existence
without a proper sense of the value of the government in which'
they are to take a part, and without a sufﬁcient knowledge.
of its principles, to enable them to discharge intelligently the du-
ties offreemen. They ».-zcercise their political privileges, merely
because they are privileges—--often without any deﬁnite object
in view, unless it be to promote the schemes ofa certain p arty or
individual to whose fortunes they may have become attached.

, Patriotism, too, is a principle that should be seduously inculca-
ted, and universally cherished. Genuine patriotism is that ar.
dent love of country which will induce the citizen to make; all
needful sacriﬁces to promote its welfare. And what is better
calculated to inspire this sentiment, than a frequent recurrence to
the vicissitudes that marl; the history of'our country’! The hard.
ships and dangers that attended itssettlement; the political char-
acter of the colonies; the oppressions of‘ a tyrannical govern?
ment; the spirit and ﬁrmness with which these oppressious were
resisted, and which characterized those who achievedlour inde-
pendence; and the wisdom whicli planned that system of govern.
ment. under which it is our peculiar privilege to live; are subjects,
the contemplation of which will inspire the mind oftheyouth with
a disinterested zeal for his country, that will govern his coiiduct
in after life. Acting under-its sacred impulse, the welfare of his
country, and the perpetuity ofits institutions, will be the objects
ofhis highest ambition. And if the gift of oﬂice should,lper.
chance, he bestowed according to merit, and he should be promo-
ted to a seat in the public councils, he would legislate, not for
the benefit of any individual or party, but for the benefit ofltlie
community; r

Education must beunited with religious principle. It islvndt‘,
enough that the citizen understands his duties. ' Kn'owledge, uns
less it be properly‘ applied, answers no valuable purpose; ifiml-
properly used, it may be productive of great evil. Where the

and civil and religious liberty endangered, if not totally destroy-

On this subject, also, we may proﬁt by the admonitions of the
patriot whose name we have before mentioned:

“ OF all the dispositions and habits which lead to political pros-

perity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain ‘

would that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor
to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest
props of theduties of men and citizens. The more politician,
equally with the pious man, ouglit.' to respect and cherish them.

A volume could not trace all their Connexions with private and

public felicity. Let itsimply be asl;.ed, where is the security fin-
property, for reputation, for l‘ii"e, if the {wise of i'eligious obliga-
tion desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation
in courts of‘ justice? And let us with caution iiidiilge the sup.
position, that morality can be maintained without religion.-—-

“ It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary
spring ofpopular government. The rule, indeed, extends with
more or less force to every species of free government. \7Vho
that is a sincere friend to it, can look with indi1"f'erence upon at-

Let every citizen be governed by these sentiments. Let er -
ucation be properly encouraged, and its beneﬁts be extended to
all. Let our youth be instructed in their duties as members of
society, and as citizens of a free government; and let them be
taught to appreciate the blessings enjoyed under our invaluable
constitution. Let every citizen feel lhimselfindividually respon-
sible for his moral and political inﬂuence, and act with reference
to the general good; and our republican institutions are safe.
