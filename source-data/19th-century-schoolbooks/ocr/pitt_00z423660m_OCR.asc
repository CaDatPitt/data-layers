same is true of cheese, as compared with salmon, of lean
pork and venison, of maize and rice.
209. As a rule, animal food is digested sooner than
starchy food.   The more tender the fibre and the finer the
division, the quicker is the digestion. The admixture of
the different classes of foods, as of fat and lean meat with
starchy and accessory foods, aids digestion. Variety of
foods of the same class, as of beef, mutton, eggs, fislh,
beans, peas, cereal grains, rice, potato, etc., should be
sought after. As sameness cloys the palate, changes in
the mode of preparing and cooking should engage the
attention of the cook.
210. The raw egg is one of the most digestible of foods.
The whipped white is somewhat, and the hard-boiled white
is quite, indigestible. Lean and fat meats together are more
digestible than when taken separately. Cold, well-cooked
sausage is more easily digested than hot sausage. Stale
bread with butter can be tolerated when buttered hot toast
or buttered hot biscuits or bread would excite gastric torments.
(a) ORDER OF DIGESTIBILITY.-Cooked rice, cooked tripe, raw white of egg, cooked sago,
tapioca, and barley, boiled milk, raw eggs, roasted lamb, parsnips, and potatoes are the
most readily digested of foods, and in the order named. Prepared in the most favorable
manner, beef, mutton, oyster, veal, aind fowl, and white bread with butter are rather less
digestible. Fresh pork, salt pork, and salt beef require much more time and energy for
their digestion.
210a. ALCOHOLIC DRINKS, even in very dilute forms,
delay or comp)letely arrest the process of digestion.       Tobacco diminiiishes the natural appetite for food. Some cases
of dyspepsia are cured by stopping the use of tobacco.

WATER.
211. WATER is a necessity (184). As a food, an average
person uses from seventy-five to one huntdred ounces daily,
of which about two-thirds are taken in the form of drink
and one-third in the foods (179, a). For other purposes,
each person in civil life needs about twenty-five gallons.
212. SouRCEs.-The supplies of fresh water are derived
from the vapor of water existing in the atmosphere. Under
changes in temperature the vapor in the atmosphere is condensed, and reaches the ground as rain, snow, hail, etc. On
reaching the ground, a portion (rain) flows off to the brooks
and rivers; a portion sinks into the soil, to appear later in
springs, wells, etc.; a portion soon returns to the air as
vapor, and the rest is used in the growth and decay of
plants and animals. On steamers fresh water is condensed
from the heated vapor derived from salt water.
213. RAIN-WATER.-As the drops of water move towards the ground they wash materials from the air and absorb air. That which falls earliest is quite impure. The
entire rain-water of manufacturing and thickly-populated
districts is quite unfit for drinking or cooking. Country
rain-water, though not pure, is a healthy and pleasant domestic water. The freezing process purifies water, though

95LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
much of the mixed air is expelled.  Ice-water is therefore
"heavy."   Ice. water is not so good for the stomach's health
as spring- or rain-water. Clean snow-water is not objectionable.
214. SOIL-WATER.-The quality of the water taken
from the ground varies with the nature of the soil. The
rain-water in passing through the soil becomes highly
charged with carbonic acid.  Later this water dissolves
out and becomes laden with many compounds, like salt,
lime, etc. When the water is very highly charged with
gases and chemical compounds, it becomes a "mineral
water."
215. A SHALLOW WELL is one whose depth is rarely
more than twenty-five feet, and which has not been sunk
through deep layers of clay, hard-pan, or rock to a waterbearing stratum.  The water of such a well is rapidly derived from waters on the ground near the well.. 216. SHALLOW-WELL-WATERS usually conitain much
organic matter. In woo(ly districts the water has often a
yellowish tinge. In populated places, in old towns and
cities, and at homestead(s where the well is located near the
privy and the barn, the water is commonly polluted with
human and animnal excreta and sink-waste.    "Shallowwell-water oftell consists largely of the leakage and soakage of the receptacles for human excrement." Shallowwell-waters are dangerous (Fig. 20).
217. DRIVEN OR TUBE WELLs.-These are shallow
wells.  As they are commonly driven in alluvial soil,
214. What is added to rain-water in the soil? What is a mineral
water? 215. What is a shallow well? Speak of its water-supply.
216. What may enter a shallow well? Why is its water dangerous?
217. Speak of driven-well-water. Why;s it better than river-water?
What is done by black soil and plants?
96such waters are often laden with mineral matters, and
hence are not good waters.  The advantage of the driven
well is that pollution of the water is not so easy as in the
case of ponds, rivers, or shallow wells. As the black soil
and plant-action near the well purify the descending rainwater, tube-well-water is safer than shallow-well-water
subject to inflows of washings.
218. DEEP-WELL-WATER.-A deep well is oniie in
which the water-bearing stratum   lies beneath a thick,
water-tight layer.  Its supplies are drawn from waters
which have sunk slowly and have undergone a prolonged
filtration. Deep-well-waters are usually clear, cool, and
sparkling. At times they are "hard," owing to the lime
salts in solution. Waters from granite, trap, and slaterock regions are the best.
219. PRECAUTIONS.-All wells should be curbed. The
slope from the mouth of the well should be such that
surface-washiings cannot enter.  It is advisable to have
thie upper two-thirds of the well-lining laid in water-tight
cement, or the lining backed by a mass of well-tamped
puddled clay. Grass near the well makes an excellent
protective (Fig. 20).
220. RIVER- AND LAKE-WATERS.-These waters are
soft and well aerated. If the waters are derived from hillregions, away from habitations, then they are wholesome.
If the waters are taken out in the vicinity of cultivated
lands or large towns, then they are suspicious, if not dangerous. Such waters are improved by motion, by exposure

221. DANGERS IN WATERs.-Living organisms in waters
are the causes of much disease. These organisms are rarely
detected by the chemist. They are detected only by observing their growth and the effects produced by them on
living animals.   Koch found thirty-eight million living
organismns (microderms) in a cubic centimetre (0.061 cubic
inch) of impure water, and only four in the same quantity of distilled water.   Water having     more than   one
hundred and twenty to the cubic centimetre is unfit for
drinking-purposes.
222. SouRCE-IMPURITIES.-Upland granite soil-waters
are usually pure.   Waters fromn chalk and limestone districts are sparkling and clear, but "hard."    Waters from
a mixtllre of sand and clay (alluvial) usually are laden
with much mineral matter.       Surface- and shlallow-wellwaters are comrrmonly polluted by surface-washlings and
decaying animal and vegetable substances.     They also are
rich in certain dangerous compounds (ammonias, nitrites,
nitrates).  Marsh-waters and grave-yard-waters should be
avoi(led (130)..

98veyed in open ditches, open troughs, etc., it is liable to
be fouled with dust, dead leaves, exereta, etc. Waters of
streams and rivers, especially in manufacturing districts,
are fouled by excreta, oil, dyes, bark, shoddy, and other
wastes (220).  Waters conveyed in zinc-coated iron pipes
are known to become laden with the salts of zinc. Except
for distribution in the house, lead pipes ought not to be
used. The well-pump pipe should be of iron. Iron makes
the best cheap water-piping.
224. STORAGE-IMPURITIES. - House-cisterns, whether
above or in the ground, are very liable to fouling. Dust,
soil, leaves, excrements of vermin, or vermin find access.
If the waste-pipe runs direct into the sewer rather than
into an open spout, not unfrequently the cistern-water beconies fetid with sewer-gas.  The cistern supplying the
water-closet ought never to be the drinking-water cistern
also. A shallow well near the house and barn, near the cesspool or privy, near the sink-drain and the house wastedump, is always liable to pollution (Fig. 20).
225. A well drains an extent of soil about it shaped like
an inverted cone (Fig. 20, F, F.). The diameter of the
base of the cone will vary with the nature of the soil. In
loose soils it is said that a well sixty feet deep will drain
an area the cone of which has a base-diameter of two hlundred feet. The Newport experiments show that sand is
no barrier to the entrance of germs into wells fromn privies
and bad cesspools.   The amount of surface-impurities
reaching the water-bearing layer of a shallow well will
depend much upon the foulness of the black soil. If this is

(a) CEssrooLs.-When the) must be used, they should be placed at a considerable distance from the building. Both roof and bottom should be arched. The roof should have
a man-hole and a ventilating-pipe. The depth sihonll not exceed seven feet. The walls
should be of brick set in cement, surrounded by a clay puddle and( lined with a coating
of cement. To divide the solid from the liquid, a galvanized iron grating may divide it
into two parts. The ventilator must be provided with a charcoal-laden screen. In the
connecting-pipe there must be a water-trap and a foul-air up-shaft. The cesspool must
be regularly and frequently cleaned. A leaky, soni-ventilated cesspool is a nuisance of the m'ost
daszgerous stamp.
(b) PURIFICATION OF WATERS.-Quietness of water permits the subsidence of the coarse
impurities. Agitation of waters, with exposure in spray or sheets, clears them of organic
matters. The slow filtration of waters through deep layers of gravel and sharp sand
lessens the solids, dinminishes the hardness, and removes much of the color. When a
water slowly passes through a compressed mass of animal (bone) charcoal, it loses most
of the fine suspended matters, mineral and organic, and it appears clear and bright.
Vegetable (wood) charcoal is not so efficient as animal charcoal. The best filters (domestic) are made of animal charcoal, magnetic carbide of iron, or of spongy iron. (Parkes.)
(c) The action of all kindcls of filters is temporary. They soon lose their cleansingpowers. Small filters must be frequently washed, and occasionally cleaned with acids
or permanganate of potassa solution. In the case of animal charcoal and sand, fire is
the best cleaning agent.
226. DOMESTIC PURIFICATION OF WATERS.-A con226. What of water-supply? Of house-tanks? Of filtration? Of

to an intermnittent supply.  Water whichl is stored for
hours in hotse-tanks is quite liable to become fouled (224).
The kitchen-taps ought to be provided with filters, in order
to strain out the grosser impurities.  It is well to refilter
all drinking-water by passing it tllroughl a charcoal filter.
Sonme waters should always be boiled before use.
227. WHEN CHOLERA OR YELLOW OR TYPHOID FEVER
is prevalent, all drinking-waters, and especially those from
suspicious sources (Table, 220), oughlt to be well boiled and
then agitated in the open air.  The boiled water should be
cooled, not by putting ice into it, but hy packing ice about
the water-bottle or tank. Ice is often impure. The germs
of many diseases are not killed by freezing.  Filtration is
not adequate to remove disease-germs. A dash of brandy,
whiskey, or wine in the water, or in the stomach, will not
destroy germ-vitality.
228. ACTION OF IMPURE WATERS. The effects produced by the continiued use of impure waters for drinkingpurposes are rarely sudden and violent. In general the
health is gradually undermined. The system loses its tone,
and thius can offer little resistance to the action of diseaseagents (125).  The principal effects are localized in the alimentary canal.  The commnon signs are uneasiness, lessening of appetite, imperfect digestion, looseness of bowels (in
lead-poisoning, constipation), loss of mutscular power, and
even mental weakness. Dysentery and chronic diarrhoea
often have their efficient cause in impure water. Malarial

disease  may and often      does follow    the use of marsh-water
and shallow-well-water (130). Parasites may enter by the
drinlkinig-water.
229. FECAL DISEASES.--Cholera, yellow fever, and
typhloid fever are largely fecal diseases. The germns (125)
of these diseases leave the living human body in fteces or
the vomit.     If  these   ejecta  are  not burnt or thoroughly
disinfected   (267, b), the   germs    (contagia) will long      retain
their vitality.    If the   ejecta  are  cast into ordinary     privyboxes or water-closets, or are          thrown upon the ground, the
germs gain access to      the  shallow    wells, imperfect cisterns,
streams, and    other sources of the water-supply, or, drying,
pass illto the    air, enter the      air-passages of many, or reach
distant waters.     When     a polluted   water is taken      into the
systemn, especially an enfeebled system (228), the germs
gain  a  foothold, and, findinig      suitable   conditions, rapidly
reproduce, and in due time        develop a peculiar disease-condition (specific disease).
(a) TYPHOID FEVER is called by Prof. Huxley "the scourge and the disgrace of our
country" (England). In typhoid-fever patients the intestines for a fortnight, or thereabouts, discharge floods of liquid laden withl matters on which the specific poison of a communicable disease has set its most specific mark. These specific germs may be propagated among healthy persons: (1) by percolation through the soil, when the alvine
discharges are thrown upon the ground or into a cesspool or a common privy, into the
wells which supply drinking-water to the inllhabitants; (2) by issuing, lhrough defects in
the sewers, into the air of the rooms, or areas adjacent to the rooms (122); (3) by exhalation through the apertures of small, ill-trapped, non-ventilated water-closets or privies,
which are at once tihe receptacle of the dischiarges of the sick and the daily resort of the
lhealthy. (Aitkin.)
(b) YELLOW FEVER is a localized disease. The germ, agent, or poison which causes it
is transportable. The great localizing causes are tlhe accumulation of filth around habitations, defective ventilation, and overcrowding (163). "It is inow coming out more
and more clearly that yellow fever, like cholera, is a fecal disease." (Paokes.)
(c) CHOLERA is a portable disease. It is always present in India. Its germs can be
carried by persons andcl objects from place to place. The specific agents are conveyed by

the fecal discharges entering the drinking-water, or upon thle food, or in the clothing or
throuth the air. The vomit and the alvine discharges need the most active attention
(267, b).
230. PREVENTION OF FECAL        DISEASES.-Under the
conditions of modern commerce an(l travel it is imnpossible to prevent the carriage of the germns from  infected to
non-infected districts, and quarantine is largely useless.
Disease-germs thlrive in conditions of filth and moisture,
atmnospheric and ground.   Measures of cleanliness taken
beforehand are of far mnore imiportance than the removal
and disinfection of filthl after the germis have actually made
themselves known by wide-spreadling disease.
231. PRECAUTIONARY      MEASURES. -The sources of
water-supply must be examined by tile authorities.   The
intermittent service of water should be mnade constant.
Cisterns must be made clean and kept clean.   The wastepipes of water-cisterns should dischlarge into the air, not
direct into sewers. All accumulations of filth, excreta,
and honse-waste must be removed regularly and at frequent intervals.  The drains and waste-pipes must be
ventilated and disconnected from  the sewer-pipes, so that
sewer-gas cannot enter the house (122). The people must
be encouraged to live on wholesome, well-cooked foods, to
avoid unripe fruit and vegetables, and to keep themselves,
their clothing, and their surroundings clean. Action in
these directions will do mnore to save households from infection than all the quarantine measures ever devised.

IT is suggested that the brief anatomical and physiological text
be supplemented by mammalian dissections, and by demonstrations
upon the human body, directions for which may be found in the
author's "Comprehensive Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene;"
that the management of emergent cases be carried out in full in
the presence of the class; and that the attention of the pupils be
called to the sanitary or unsanitary features of the ward or town.
It would be well to conduct the class to houses in process of construction, to point out to its members the salient features from a
sanitary point of view, and, upon return to school, to require them
to prepare an outline sketch of the grounds and of the ground-plan
of the house. Request them to make suggestions for sanitary improvements. In the same manner call their attention to wearingapparel, house-furnishings, new inventions, etc.
It is also suggested that the review be conducted by the topical
method, and that the pupils be required to prepare upon the topics
to which attention is directed by the cross-references. At this
period, with the books open before them, it will be well to read the
fine-print paragraphs, and to explain at length the bearing of the
facts there given upon the subject under consideration.

due to the water-supply is not an unknown malady.         In
advanced cases it is known by the fetor of the mouth, blue
line on the gums, obstinate constipation, and even" wristdrop" (228). It usually results from using water which
has sluggishly passed through much-corroded lead pipes.
Shallow-well, condensed, and rain waters most readily dissolve lead.  Zinc, copper, arsenic, and mercury may enter
the system through certain of the "made" drinks, and thus
occasion disease-action (71).
PARASITES IN WATER.-The tape-worm (Bothriocephalus), derived from the ox, the
liver-worm (Distomna), the round-worm (Ascaris), the leech, and other worms (Filaria), may
gain lodgment through the drinking-water.

THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.
233. THE APPARATUS concer,led in digestion consists
of the mouth-parts, the alimentary canal, and the glands
connected with the same.  The mouth-parts, the canal, and
the gland-tubes are lined with mucous membrane (106).
234. THE MOUTH-PARTS include the upper and lower
jaws, the teeth inserted in the same, the salivary glands
(opening by ducts into the mouth), and the tongue (Fig. 18).
235. THE ALIMENTARY CANAL is a long passage of
variable size. It includes the pharynx, cesophagus, stomach,
and intestines. It extends from the base of the skull (Fig.
18) to the anus.  The bulk of the canal lies in the abdominal cavity (Fig. 12, space below the diaphragm).
236. THE GLANDS include the saliva-secreting glands
(parotid, Fig. 12), the gastric glands, lyinig in the lining
membrane of the stomnach, the intestinal glands, in the lining
membrane of the intestines, the pancreas (seated behind
and below the stomach), and the liver (Fig. 21, 16). The
secreting cells are bound together by connective tissue, which
is made up of delicate white fibres. Each gland makes a
peculiar fluid. All these fluids in their proper order are
essential to normal digestion.

237. FooDs, when introduced into the mnouth, are for
the most part not in condition to enter the blood. They
are not diffusible; that is, they cannot pass throuLgh moist
meinbranes. In the alimentary canal, under the influence
of the gland-secretions of moisture and of motion, the
foods become largely diffusible.
238. CHANGES EFFECTED.-In the mouth, the mixed
food, as of flesh, bread, vegetables, is broken into small
bits by the teeth, is moistened withi saliva, is mixed with
air and mucus, becomres alkaline in reaction, and a portion
of the nlon-diffusible starch is changed into the diffusible
sugar. The food is now forced by mnuscular conitractions
through the pharynx and oesophagus (Fig. 18) to the
stomach.
239. In the stomach (Fig. 21, 18), under gastric-juice
action the food-mass becomes acid, the change from starch
to sugar is lessened or stopped, the protectives of the starchgrains and oil-drops are loosened, the bundcles of fleshfibres and bits of vegetable fall asunder, and the nondiffusible proteids are changed into diffusil)le peptones.
From time to time portions of the pulpy mass are forced
into the small intestines.
240. In the small intestines (Fig. 21, 19, 22), under the
action of the pancreatic, hepatic (liver), and intestinal secretions, the food-mass becomes alkaline, the remaining
proteids become peptones, the starches become sugar, and
the non-diffusible fats are changed into finely-divided emulsions or into soaps, both of which are diffusible.

107LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
241. ABSORPTION.-Water passes readily from all parts
of the canal into the blood-vessels lyinlg in the canalwalls. Diffusible materials and salts may leave the canal
at most portions. The bulk of the food-materials leaves
the canal in the smnall intestines. The insoluble and nondiffusible matters accumulate in the lower bowels (colon
and rectum).
242. INDIGESTION (dyspepsia) is a state of the stomach
or of the intestinal canal, or of both, in which they cannot
perform their normal duties.  Its causes are usually either
in the quantity, the quality, or the improper preparation
of the foods taken.
243. QUANTITY OF FooD.-Each person require a definite amount. This amount varies with age, duties, habits,
amount of clothing, health of body, and vigor of mind.
The supply must equal the waste of the system. Frequent
weighing of the body is to be recommended. The minimum weight consistent with health is two pounds to each
inch of adult stature.  A generous diet conduces to health,
good work, and good mnorals.
244. THE SUPPLY in the case of growing persons must
exceed the waste. The body must be fed and filled. The
supply should be in the formn of plain foods, meats, fish,
eggs, milk, bread, rice, vegetables, and ripe fruits, plainly
served. Fashionable dishes and tid-bits are inadequate.
During childhood and youth a reserve of energy and force
must be stored.

markedly the average daily muscular work, as the stoppinig of a line of work, or upon leaving thle farm or shop
for school, practise self-denial. Eat less food at each meal.
Drink more water. Replace the hearty fatty foods with
vegetables and fruits. Continue the denial for a few days,
or until the system is accustomed to the new order of life.
Self-denial should be practised during the warm days of
spring and early summer. By so doing, indigestion and
" )iliousness" mrnay be averted.  Self-denial is the antidote
to many "sick-headaches."
246. PHYSICAL STATE OF FooD).-Fine division of
foods favors digestion. Smiall particles offer more surface
for the digestive juices to attack than do large particles.
Hence the cook should use the knife and heat so well that
the food shall be well divided, or can be easily divided by
the teeth.
247. EATING AND DRINKING.-Simplicity of food is a
conditionl of health. Chew the food well. Mix the foods
most completely with saliva and miouth-mucus. A warm
simple soup or cool water may be taken at the opening of
the repast. Little or no fluid should be taken during the
repast. It is not well to drink large amounts at the close
of the meal. It is better to wait one or two hours after
the repast before drinking freely.
248. BAD TEETH.-A person having bad teeth does not
and cannot divide and crutsh the food sufficiently. Hence
the food is not well mixed and mloistened with saliva. The
habit of mnaking the foods soft by the admixtutre of fluids
other than saliva, and then rapidly passing them to the
stomach, is unhygienic.

249. CARE OF TEETH.- Pay careful attention to the
teeth from childhood. Keep them clean. Rinse the mnouth
with tepid water after each meal.  Brush the teeth and
gums, inside and outside, at least twice daily.  A finle soap
is preferable for occasional use to comtmercial powd(lers and
washes. With a thread remove all food-particles that have
collected between the teeth.
250. Quill or wood picks are preferable to metallic picks.
"Tartar" shlould be early removed by the dentist.  All cavities ought to be cleansed and filled at the earliest possible
opportunity.  Gold-foil mnakes the best filling.  Artificial
teeth are better than very bad teeth or no teeth. All badlydecayed teeth, when they cannot be filled with a "soft filling," should be remnoved.
251. FREQUENCY OF EATING.-Experience shows that
in working America of to-(lay three meals a day is a good
divisioni.  Hard-working students and literary men should
never fast more than five hours.  According to E. Smith,
M.D., the best division of the food is about one part for
evening meal, one and a half parts for breakfast, and two
parts for dinner. (In summer, cold-meat dinners are preferable to hiot dinners with iced drinks.) School-children
oughlt to have more than three mrneals in twenty-four hours.
Infants may be fed at intervals of from two to four hours.
252. In general, it is best for the healthy adult to take
no food between the meals.  The interval from supper to
breakfast is too long for invalids.  They should take "a
little and often." The ordinary evening meal ought to

take place two or thlree hours before the retiring hours.
Au hour at each meal is time well spent. Take a short
rest before going to the table. Slow eating is favorable to
digestion.  Mirth at the table and a "romp" after eating
are excellent preventives of indigestion.
253. APPETITE is a safe guide, wlhen a person is in healtlh,
when the food is simple and natural in kind and in quality,
and when its preparation is plain (258). A natural diet,
like fruit, is self-limtniting. The more artificial the food,
the more it is suLgared, flavored, and spiced, the more a
person is tempted to take. Overeating leads to overfulness of the stomach and intestines, the digestive apparatus
is unequal to the abnormal work, and, later, indigestion and
its train of troubles follow.
254. QUALITY OF FooD.-Indigestion ranks third in
the list of diseases prevalent among Massachusetts farmners,
but it ranks first among the wives and daughlters. The
farmers, living largely in the open air, and mainily using
their muscles, can attack, if not easily digest, any kind of
food. The in-door members of the family, onI the sanme
diet, are unable to thrive. Hence the quality of the food
must vary with the occupation and body-condition as well
as with age (179).
255. IMPROVEMENTS.-In     general, more fresh   and
cannled flesh should be used. Salted flesh ought to be
used less frequently. The cooking of the materials in
hot fats should, as far as possible, be avoided. Good
yeast-bread ought to supplant cream-of-tartar and soda
compounds. Pies and other pastry may well be replaced

What may result? 254. Why is indigestion common? Hence?

by fruits and fruit-preparations. Badly-prepared, tasteless
food undoubtedly is one impelling cause of thle use of alcoholics in moderation.
256. WHITE BREAD AND TEA, the maini-stay of too
many working-womnen of America, is an inadequate diet.
To get enough energy from such food, they must eat about
four pounds of bread daily. As the butter used is increased,
so may the weight of bread be lessened. Proteids in a food
are necessary, but the great force-producers in the human
system are the fats (187).
257. GOOD WORK, mental or physical, cannot be done
on a poor food or on an improper food. As a rule, womenworkers, clerks, students, and persons at in-door emnployments need a finer quality and a greater variety of simnple
foods than out-door workers. The food for in-door workers
ought to be most carefillly prepared, and but little or not
at all spiced. The appetite should be spurred, not by
"tonics" and "bitters," but by enlivening out-of-door exercises (lawn-tennis, base-ball, rowing, running, etc.), by
breathing pure air (114), by keeping the skin healthy, by
suitable clothing (80) and baths (63), and by preventing
the constipated hlabit (273). These workers are most injured by excitants and sedatives (Chapter XIV.).
258. MANAGEMENT OF THE DIET.-In all cases of
commencing ilndigestion, articles known to be difficult of
digestion-pastry, cheese, peculiarly-acting fruits or vegetables, fresh white bread, and most " made dishes"-must be
avoided. Pork, veal, and salted mneats are to be used with
caution. Fresh beef and mutton, not too fat, carefully

fats? 257. What of a diet for in-door workers? How best improve

roasted or broiled, are the mnost suitable of meats. Light
soups,-soups, like beef tea, are more stimulating than nutritious,-broths, chicken, game, white-fish, salmon, yolk
of eggs, raw eggs, milk-puddings, milk, rice, barley, oatmeal, and stale bread (decorticated wheat) are to be commended.
259. INFLUENCES    PREDISPOSING   TO DYSPEPSIA.Sedentary habits, as exhibited in the lives of most students,
lawyers, seamstresses, etc.; undue exercise, mental or physical, just before or just after eating; the drinking of too
much fluid at meals; the drinking of large draughts of
iced water just before, during, or just after meals; habitual
constipation; the constant use of "pills;" the abuse of
opium, chloral, etc.; the injudicious use of tobacco, tea,
condiments, and alcoholics; tight lacing, excessive study,
emotional disturbances, and mental shocks.
260. ACUTE PoISONING.-Act at once. If acids have
been taken, give strong soapsuds, soap, whlitewash, or
chalk; if alkalies, dilute vinegar, raw eggs, sweet oil; if
metallic irritants (corrosive sublimnate, arsenic, verdigris,
etc.), give raw eggs freely (do not wait to separate the
yolks) or milk.  In all cases, at first, encourage vomiting:
administer large amnounts of tepid water, or tepid inustard-water.  Tickle thle fances. After vomiting, in case
of vegetable narcotics (monk's-hood, wolf's-b)ane, etc.), enforce rest on the back, and give alcoholics (99); in opium
cases, give strong coffee and enforce walking. Send for
an able physician to guide the case while the poison is
being cast out of the system (265).

ACHAPTER XII.
THE EXCRETA.
261. EXCRETION.-Every thought, every cell-action,
every kind of energy evolved by the living body, occasions
the formation of wastes.   These wastes are like the ashes
in the grate: they nmist be frequently removed, or the internal fires will not b)urn well. Excretion is the process of
separating from the blood the materials no longer needed
in the blood.
262. The PRINCIPAL WASTES of thle system are water,
carbonic actid, urea and other nitrogenous compounds, the
salts, and the fewces.  The undue retention of any of these
wastes in the systemn induces trouble.      The rapid and
efficient casting out of these wastes insures tle continuation
of normal body-action.
263. In genlleral terms, the water leaves the system by the
way of the skin, air-passages, and kidneys; the carbonic
acid, via the air-passages (111); the urea and other nitrogenous compounds, viac the kidneys; the salts, via the skin,
kidneys, and bowels; and the feces, via the rectum.
(a) SUMMARY.-Of the entire exereta, 32 per cent passes off by the air-passages, 17
per cent. by the skin, 46.5 per cent. by the kidneys, and 4.5 per cenlt. by the alimentary canal. In vegetarians the fmces are nearly or quite doubled.

in the dermis. These glands are found, with few exceptions, over all parts of the body. The amount of fluid
daily separated by them from the blood ranges from one
and one-half to four and two-fifths pounds (700 to 2000
grammes). Dryness of the air and warmth favor their
activity (56).
265. THE KIDNEYS (Fig.
22) are two in number. They
are placed in the back and
upper portion of the abdomnen
(Fig. 12).   They separate
from the blood thlle extra
water of the blood, the salts,
and the nitrogenous wastes.
The whole product is called
the urine.
266. THE URINE is separated, drop by drop, night
and (lay. It is formed most
rapidly after meals, especially
when much fluid has been
taken.  It is formed more
largely in winter, when the
sweat glands are less active

(57), than in the summrner. It
accumulates in the pelvis of the kidney (Fig. 22, 4), passes
along the ureter, and flows into the bladder. None of the
excretory organs perform a more important work than that
of the kidneys; and any marked interference with their
duty is sure to result in injury to the general health.
265. Speak of the kidneys. What is their function? 266. What
about the separation of the urine? What becomes of it?116
LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
267. THE LOWER BOWEL receives the undigested foods,
the non-digestible materials, and the intestinal gland excreta.
The materials thus accumulating lose much of their water
through intestinal absorption; and this process may be carried on so far as to produce disease. The unnatural retention of excrement leads to rectal and intestinal discomfort,
and later to indigestion (242) and constipation (273).
(a) THE EXCREMENT OF THE SICK should be received in a pan containing a few spoonfuls of a solution of chloride of zinc (five grains to the ounce), or of a saturated solution of permanganate of potassa. If these cannot be procured, then use dry earth in the
pan and dry earth over the feces. These agents and ferrous sulphate are excellent
deodorizers. The excrement should be removed at once to the water-closet, cesspool, or
manure-heap.
(b) THE EXCRETA OF TYPHOID FEVER, YELLOW FEVER, AND CHOLERA patients ought to
be received in a pan as before indicated. The feces ought to be burnt. Fire is the only
sure disinfectant and germ-destroyer. If they cannot be burnt, thenrl they must be thoroughly disinfected with crude carbolic acid or a strong solution of zinc chloride. They
may be rendered odorless by dry, black earth or powdered charcoal. They must not be
cast into the common privy, into leaky boxes or cesspools, or on to the ground (229, a).
They may be deeply buried in soil far removed from any source of water-supply.
(C) FOULED CLOTHING is best purified by baking. If this cainnot be done, it may be
boiled in a solution of white vitriol (one ounce to the gallon) or chloride of zinc (half an
ounce to the gallon). The baking and the boiling should be prolonged. Later, it may be
washed as usual.
(d) CREMATION.-The bodies of persons dying of fecal diseases (229) are pre-eminently
sources of danger to the living. The germs do not lose their vitality on the dleath of the
sutbject of their operations. They continue to increase, and, on the decay of the body,
contaminiate the surroundings of thd body. Later they are quite liable to reach some
source of water-supply or to enter the air and thus spread disease anewv. Fire is the
only sure agent against germs or contagia. Should not the bodies of persons dying of
fecal disease be cremated?
(e) A body weighing two hundred and twenty-seven pounds was placed in a cylindrical vessel seven feet long by five or six feet in diamreter. This was run into a Siemens
furnace, the interior of which was heated to 2000~ F. In fifty-five minutes it was
reduced to five pounds of ashes.
268. WASTES AND PoIsoNs.-The holding in the living
blood for long periods of wastes (which is one of the effects
of agents like morphia, alcohol, etc.) works mrnischief
267. What accumulates in the lower bowel? Hence? What follows retention? 268. What is the influence of poisons? of wastes?
How is abnormal heat reduced?THE EXCRETA.
(Chapter XIV.). The retention of wastes (262) induces a
febrile condition (55).  This condition is recognized by a
hot skin, flushed face, and an elevation of the body-temperature (100~ to 110 F.; 37~ to 43~ C.).     To mitigate these
discomforts, and to hiasten the casting out of the wastes or
agents, we endeavor to enicourage the action of the bowels
(injectionis and cathartics), the kidneys (copious drinks), and
the sweat glands (hot d(rinks, blankets, Simpson's bath).
269. SKIN-DISEASE.-More diseases of the skin arise
from  an improper diet (243) than from      any other single
cause.  Eczema and acne, two of the most cormmono      skinmaladies, are usually accompanied      by derangements of
the stomach and intestines. Liver- (272) and kidney- (270)
troubles are a fertile cause of skin-disease.  A mnajority of
skin-diseases (parasites excepted) are benefited by securing
proper and regular bowel-action, by encouraging the activity
of the kidneys, and by the good influences of cleanliness,
exercise, and proper clothing.
270. KIDNEY-DISEASE.-The main           causes leading to
kidney-troubles are diseases of the skin (like scarlatina),
want of cleanliness of the skin, alcoholic initemperance,
eating too large amolunts of foods rich in proteids, the use
of too little water, exposure to wet and cold, and the
damming back of the urine owing to disease or obstruction
in the urethira or bladder. Hence avoid or mitigate the
causes, and conform, as far as possible, to a common-sense
mode of living.
(a) RETENTION.-The forced retention of the urine in the bladder leads to severe pain
and over-distention. The latter may result in an inability to empty the bladder, in an
inflammation of the lining membrane (cystitis), or in overflow. Disease of the kidney
may occur subsequent to a cystitis (296).
269. What favors skin-diseases?  How may they be benefited?
270. Mention the main causes of kidney-troubles. Hence?
117LESSONS IN HYGIENE.

Administer two "Dover's powders," or two grains of opium. Usually relief will be
obtained. After half an hour in the bath, remove to.a warmi bed. Apply over the pnbis
cloths wrung out of hot wvater upon which has been sprinkled camphor. Send for a

perspiration will be established. Remove the bottles, wrap the patient in fresh, warmned
blankets, and allow the action to continue half an hour, then remove the damp blankets
and put the patient in a warm, dry bed.
271. RECTAL DISEASES are the producers of more misery
tllan almost ally other local affection.            In  the healthy they
are largely preventible.     Among the main        causes of rectal
and anal diseases (piles, spasm, fissure, etc.) are want of
cleanliness, the abuse of alcoholic drinks, high living,
sedentary habits, and habitual constipation.        Rectal disease
may   be  largely  averted   by practising   body-flexion    movemnents (27).     Persons having piles may often mitigate their
troubles by sedulously attending to the restoration of the
regular action of the lower bowel.
272. LIVERI-DISEASE.-Tlle main causes of liver-disease
may be classed       under two heads: (1) personal, as alcoholic
intemperance (especially spirit-drinking), indolent and luxuriouls habits, the wearing      of close-fitting  garments, and
tight lacing, and (2) climatic, as exposure             to excessive heat
and  malarial influences.      Liver-disease    may   be  mitigated
by  a simple   diet, by   the  taking   of judicious   exercise, by
keeping   the  skin warm, and      by securing   free  kidney and
rectal action.
273. Among the organs of excretion there is no doubt that the liver plays a very important part. It is true that its action is very complex, and that excretion is by no
means its sole duty. But the bile which it secretes is laden with waste products, and

any agent which interferes with its proper work is capable of inflicting serious injury
upon the healtlh. Among suci agents are ihe various alcoholic stimulants.
Alcoholics at first induce increased activity of the liver-cells: and an excessive growth
of the connective tissues leads to an enlargement of the organ. But after a time the
cell-activity diminishes, the connective tissue contracts, the liver becomes hard and nodular, and smaller than it was in health; klidney and other d'seases follow, dropsy appears,
and the presence of incurable liver-disease is at last easily recognized. Long-continused
over-indulgence in strong drink generally precedes the production of the type of liverdisease just described. "Fatty liver" may be caused by the free use of malt liqulors.
The excessive and prolonged use of alcoholic drinks may produce in the kidneys
clianges in some respects highlly analogous to those whichl occur in a contracted liver
(cirrhosis, or "gin-drinlcer's liver"). The excretion of alcohol by the kidney may cause
one form of "Brighlt's disease," which is ordinarily incurable, and which, if it be cured,
often leaves the lIidney with a diminished power of excretion.
The opium-habit exercises a very powerful and direct effect upon the excretions and
secretions. Even a very moderate dose of opiuni will at times almost completely "lock
up" and suspend the action of all the excretory organs. ITabitual isers of opium suffer
greatly in consequence from torpidity of these organs  These evil effects are, however,
far less deplorable than the slavery of this mnost pernicious habit. Opium-eating enslaves the will and breaks down the moral tone of its victim more comnpletely than the
use of any other drug conlmonly known.
274. SEWAGE is a comnpound of hluman exereta and
household waste. The history of many epidemics affords
examples of the poisonous influence of retained or stored
sewage. Late investigations show that the germs of certain
diseases (typhoid fever, typhuts, and diphtheria) multiply in
sewage-filth. Sewage ought to be rapidly removed from
the vicinity of hluman dwellings (121).
275. SEWAGE-REMOVAL.-The two methods most in
use are   "dry    removal" and       "water-carriage."         The   first
methlod can be used only in the country.             It is not adapted
for Occidental towns and cities. The second method, thlough
wasteful and, in certain respects, dangerous (sewer-gas, 123),
has been found best in modern timnes.
(aC) DaRY REMaovAa.-(1) The odorous "pail" or "cask" method, as practised in Japan,
China, and Soiith Germany; (2) the "privy" method, most oljectionable on account of
water-pollution (225) and air-contamination (119), as practised in the Northern United

States; (3) the "dry-earth" system; (4) the ventilated, water-tight masonry vault, in
which liberal amounlts of earth and charcoal are used; and (5) the cesspool or pit (225, a).
(b) WATER-CARRIAGE.--In this mnethod sufficient water is added (tfrom the roofs or
water-mains) to insure the continuous flowinlg off of the mixture through pipes and
sewvers. Usually the mnain sewers discharge into ponds, rivers, or thlle sea, and thus pollute the water and the air. "Sewage-farms" ought to be encourageld. The wastes of the
towns, when conveyed to the land and used for irrigation and fertilization, cause healthy
plant-growth, a purified condition of the outflowing water, and little or no air-pollution.
(c) "In Germany it is admitted, without question, that meeicipjtl hecaltlfetlsess depends
on three principles: (1) the total discharge of water-closets into sewers, (2) the distribution of an abundant supply of water in dwellings and frequenit flushing of drains, and
(3) the purification of sewage by soil and vegetation." (Durand-Claye.)
275a. Between the sewerage-works of a town and the
excretory organs of the body there is a decided analogy.
The veins and tlle lymph-vessels both performn the function
of  sewers.      The    excretory     organs     are   sewage-outlets.
Among these organs the kidneys and the liver fulfil very
important, perhaps       the most important, paits.         According
to Dr. B. W. Richardson, a very careful observer and coInscientious writer, the most prolific cause of organic disease
of the liver and kidieys is the free use of alcoholic stimulants.

AGESILAUS, King of Sparta, when asked what things boys should
learn, replied, "Those which they will practise when they become
men"
In a concise and orderly form are presented the essential facts
concerning bathing, clothing, air, water, food, cooking, home-construction, mental work, physical exercise, eye-work, contagious
disease, filth-disease, disinfection, tea, tobacco, chloral, alcoholics,
etc., as bearing upon the maintenance of health and the prevention
of disease. Especial attention is given to the disease-inducing
actions of tea, tobacco, chloral, and alcoholics. The simplest and best
methods of procedure in emergent cases are clearly explained.
The portion of the text devoted to anatomy and physiology is
brief, yet contains all the facts deemed essential for the comprehension of the practical portions of the book. In the foot-notes and
in the paragraphs under the "disease-inducing actions of alcoholics" will be found facts of deep import.
The author here desires to acknowledge his deep obligations to
his mother and to Miss M. Tyler, of Warren, Massachusetts, for
seeing the "Comprehensive Physiology" through the press, and to
Prof. W. P. Brooks, of Sapporo, for advice in preparing the manuscript of this book for the press.

a modifying, and even controlling, influence upon impulses
originating in, or coming from, other nerve-cell masses.
282. Certain groups of cells seated in the irregular outer
folds of the cerebrum  are concerned with thought, will,
emotion, memory, and speech; other groLups, with sight,
smell, hearing, etc.; and groups in the cerebellum with the
orderly arrangement of skeletal muscle actions (366).
283. Groups of nerve-cells in the medulla are concerned
with body-movements, blood-flow, heart-action, respiration,
etc.; groups in the spinal cord, with the carrying out of
acquired a(nd well-learned movements; and the groups in
the ganglia, seated in the abdomen, thorax, and skull, with
blood-flow and internal muscle action.  The nerves convey
information to the central nerve groups, and transmit
mandates to the executing organs anid tissues.
284. THE MIND.-The processes which constitute the
mind are carried on in the gray nerve cells of the cerebrum.   In order that the processes shall be normal, five
conditions are necessary: (1) the brain must be normal in
its structure; (2) it must receive a due amount of nlormal
blood; (3) its work must be adjusted to its capacity; (4)

285. HEREDITY.-Children, as a rule, resemble their
parents, one or both; somietimes not their parents, but their
grand- or great-grandparents (atavismn). Not only is there a
striking resemblance in form, features, and movements, but
also a resemblance in their brain-action, and in their ten282. Speak of the functions of cerebral groups; of cerebellar groulps.

dencies to certain lines of conduct or predisposition to bodyconditions favorable to certain diseases (cotnsumption, gout).
As a rule, the vicious tendencies in the parents become intensified ill some form or other in the offspring.
286. ALCOHOL.-When the blood is for a long tinme
laden with alcohol tlhere follows in the brain-substance a
fatty degenerative change of the gray cells, and a speedy
thickening of the delicate connective tissue holding the
cells in place.  This thickening ends in a contraction, accompanied by grave structural changes.  After a time the
brain-mass shrinks and becomes firmer than is normal, and
the fluids of the ventricles of the brain are increased in
volumie.  Mental and moral weakness, muscular tremors,
and irregular muscular movement follow. (See p. 142.)
287. TOBACCO, which is always a poison to the young,
modifies the activities of the nerve-system, hinders the
power of mental application, interferes with mental development, impairs the memory, and leads to an incomplete
and imperfect manhood. It especially and most injuriously
affects the nerves of special sense. Drawinlg-masters have
noticed that young smokers very generally fail in the
attempt to draw "a clean, straight line."
288. THE OPIUM HABIT, as we have elsewhere seen,
exercises a most baneful influence upon the mind, the will,
the memory, and the moral tone of its unhappy victims.
The practice of giving, opiates and "soothing syrups" to
infants cannot be too strongly condemned.

proper food (181), can do much to aid children weighted by
the faults of their ancestors. The managers of children
should be vigilant to thwart evil tendencies. In fact, we
must all be "on guard" at all times.  Endeavors to do
right will strengthen us for good; to do evil, for. bad.
(a) Modern literature, including books of science, as well
as those of fiction and p)oetry, dwells much upon infirmity
of the will and indecision of purpose as among the greatest evils of life. There is mutlch sad truth in this view.
Weakness of character (whether inherited, or acquired( as
a result of evil habits or faulty training) is a very serious
defect. But it is Vby no means always a hopeless defect.
Strength of will may be cutltivated and developed as well as
strength of muscle. But the educator can only direct and
supervise: the power which prompts to efforts for a higher
moral development,must reside within the pupil himself.
Education and experience may show us our defects, but
it requires a high and steadfast purpose to cure them.
290. BLooD-SUPPLY.-All parts of the brain anld the
nerve-mass are rich in blood-tubes.  Though the brain
weighs less than one-forty-fifth of the body, yet it is said
to receive upwards of one-fifth of the blood discharged by
each beat of the left heart. The nerve-cells are very sensitive to variations in amount or in quality of the bloodsupply.
291. IMPROPER BLOOD induces improper nutrition. Improper nerve-cell nutrition is manifested by irregular and
perverted tlhoughits (delirium) and ill-regulated muscular
movements (chorea).  The presence of tissue-wastes (262)
and poisons in the blood must rapidly affect brain-nutrition
and brain-action (inebriation, ureimia).
290. Speak of the brain blood-supply. Of the brain sensitiveness.
291. What is the influence of improper blood?
126BRAIN AND NERVES.
292. BRAIN-NUTRITION. - Mind cannot grow     except
by growth of brain; brain cannot grow except throuLgh
good food, good air, brisk physical exercise in the open
air, mental work, and mental rest in proper proportions.
Effective brain-work cannot be expected in an underfed
person: it cannot be expected in an overfed person, especially if the food is richl and stimulating (257).
293. POSTURE.-When the head is held erect, the bloodflow to and from tlhe brain is least impeded. The bending
of the head well forward, or the use of close neck-wear,
hinders the blood-flow and( leads to overfuilness of the brain
veins. The fulness causes lleaviness, dull pain, and inability to do efficient work. Hence use loose neck-wear, sit
erect, and hold the head up (105). It is often well for
students to study whlile standing before a box on the table.
294. MENTAL WORKc.-Regular brain-work is essential
to lealth. Graded mental exercises regularly taken advance
the health, the power, and the working capacity of the
brain. The outcomre of a sound and wvell-drilled brain is
an even-working, well-poised, enduring mind. Irregular
and spasmodic mental exercise does not and cannot build
up a sound, well-balanced mind.
295. MENTAL DRILL.-The drill of slchool-children
ought to be confined to a few subjects.  The drill should
be intensive. Short lessons, frequently repeated, should
be the rule. There should be frequent rests,-partial, by
change of work, and absolute, by out-of-door, active sports.
There shlould be no lounging or dawdling over books. The
faculty to observe and compare (object-lessons) should be

drilled as well as that of memory. Bodily training, as in
Russia, should go forward with mnental culture.
296. SCHOOL-WORK.-Children can attend to mental
problems for brief periods only,-from ten minutes in the
youngest to thirty minutes in the elder scholars. Sharp,
active brain-work for half an hour will do more than an
hour's effort of a fagged brain.  AIn out-of-door romp is an
excellent mental spur. In the lower grades of schoel there
should be a recess hourly; in the other grades, at least once
in two hours. Foul air, the forced work of a weary brain,
and bad light are bad enough, but constrained positions,
prolonged retention (270, ), and want of blood-stirring
exercises are worse.
297. STUDY.-After a night's good rest the best work is
done in the mrorning hours.  The best work cannot be done
imnmediately after eating, for the blood-flow tends to the
digestive organs, and the blood-current is laden with materials too crude for brain-cell food. It would be conducive
to better health if the scholars who dine at home could
have a two-hours' "nooning."
298. Children should not be permitted to study, or the
daughters to practise on the piano, on returning from school.
That timne should be devoted to a light lunch, to useful muscular work, or to active sports. Evening study is a tax
upon an already weary brain.   It should not commence
directly after supper, and it ought to cease at least half an
hour before the retiring-hour.

as a collegiate course, young women shloul(d employ more
months than younig men. Their organismns, under modern
life, cannot hold up under unremitting brain-toil. Headaches in a school-girl usually mean exhausted nerve-power.
The majority of American young women need a well-poised,
practical mind seated in a compact, roun(led, uniformlydeveloped body, much more than a cultured mind lodged
in an anaernic, stunted, neuralgic body.
300. NORMAL WORK.-A well-trained brain can do
immense amounts of work and hold its own. An illtrained or imperfectly organized brain has little reserve
power, and easily breaks down. Good brain-work is done
with quiet action, an equable temper, and a spirit of
buoyancy. It is done by a brain hlaving a reserve of
strength.
301. OVERWORK.-Headache, heaviness, confusion of
thought, and brain-weariness in a child point to the need
of rest. If the brain-weariness is detected early, brainmischief may be averted.  Brain-overwork in children
and youth often leads to permanent mental weakness.
Brain-exhaustion in adults and brain-overwork in children
are serious maladies. Both denmand rest-by change of
occupation.
302. WoRRY.-Excessive activity, with anxiety, characterizes worry. Worry is fatal to good work. Worry
largely arises through a feeling of incapacity to perform
the work at hand. In school-life, the "cramming" of
facts for the test-examinations, the rivalry for prizes, the

desire to do three years' work in two years, constitute
sources of worry.  In world-life, business and social rivalries and envyings induce worry.    It is worry, and not
mental work, that oftenest uses up the brain (305, a).
303. REST.-Dutrinig brain-activity the brain-cell waste
is in excess of the income. Furthermore, wastes accumulate about the cells and in the blood. During periods of
rest the wastes are removed and the losses are made good.
Young or ill-trained brains require longer rest than old or
well-trained brains. The rests for the former should be
of frequent occurrence.  Brain-rest is secured by change or
cessation of studies, change of occupation, muscle-work,
and sleep.
304. SLEEP.-During sleep the brain-tissues lay up new
stores of energy. The early hours of night afford the mnost
refreshing sleep. As a rule, all personrs should average
eight hours' sound sleep daily (163). In the winter more
hours' rest should be taken than in the summer. Those
engaged in mental work need more sleep than those wearied
by hard labor.  The young, the aged, and the invalid need
more sleep than any other classes. In winter, children may
well sleep from ten to twelve hours daily.
305. CAUSES OF INSANITY.-Dr. Allen places heredity
(285) among the first sources of insanity. After this lihe
ranks dissipation (drinking-habits, abuse of tobacco and
opiates, licentiousness, etc.), overwork (301), meagre fare,
lack of ventilation, and neglect of mnoral culture.  About

306. SUNsTROKE.-Continued         exposure   to the  direct
rays and the powerful heat of the sun gives rise to insolation.  Ill this there is sudden failure of the heart's action,
often ending in speedy death.     The affected person drops
as if struck   on the head.     It is different from   "heatstroke" (58).   Treatmernt.-Dash c6Ald water on the head;

of disorders of thle brain and nerves.     Sleeplessness, mania
(acute and chronic), apoplexy, dementia, and general paralysis are among the dleplorable results of the alcohol habit.
The substance of the nerve-centres undergoes various degenerative changes; and the membranes covering the brainl
lose some of their plhysical properties under long-continued
alcoholic  poisoning.    Not only    delirium   tremens and
mania a potu, but the terrible homicidal mania, are very
comlmon results of drunkeniness.    A  very large prol)ortion

CEREBRAL EXCITANTS AND CEREBRAL SEDATIVES.
307. A CEREBRAL EXCITANT is a drug or agent which
increases the rapidity of the blood-flow, causes the fuinctions of the brain to become slightly more active, induces
the ideas to flow more freely, and alleviates nervousness,
mental and muscular. These agents rarely suspend the
brain-functions. The activity induced by them is rarely
followed by depression. To this class belong coffee, hashish,
and tea.
308. COFFEE makes a pleasant excitant beverage. It
removes the sense of commrrencing fatigue, affords an invigorating nervous stimulation, increases the action of the
skin, and promotes wakeftllness (132).  It has been found
well adapted to soldiers and mnen working under a tropical
sun (Algeria, India).  In thle British Antarctic Expedition
hot coffee was found to be superior to hlot spirits.
309. Coffee is not necessary for the productioni of the
highest plhysical and mental activity.   It occasionally
induces irregular and painful heart-action.  It does not
occasion the nervous symptoms followinig the excessive use
of tea (312).  It shouild be used in moderation only, and
should always be excluded from the diet of children and
youth. It is said to be an anti-alcoholic.

132CEREBRAL EXCITANTS.
310. HASHISH in small doses by the stomach increases
the intellectual and motor activities. It makes the amiable
more joyful, and the vicious more evil.  In large doses it
induces trance and deep, painless sleep. It is an ingredient
in some of the nostrums vaunted as cures of consumption.
Its habitual use is injurious to the nervous system. In the
East it is employed to produce intoxication and hallucinations, and to lull acuLte pain.
311. TEA is largely used by the Japanese in the form of
a weak infusion, and by the Americanis and English as a
strong decoction.  It enables a person to live on a smaller
amount of food than is usually demand(led.  It increases
the capacity for work, puts away sleep, allows of deeper
draughts on the stored-up energies than ordinary nerveaction, and, taken moderately, allays mental iunrest, fatigue,
and hunger. Its hot infusion is potent againist heat (China)
or cold (Canad(la). It is not an essential. Children and
youth should not be allowed to use it.
312. Tea used in excess deranges the digestive organs
and excites a disturbance in the nervous system.     It
induces stomach-acidity, water-brash, eructations, and flatulence (259).  It causes irregular action of the heart, hleadache, dizziness, ringing ill the ears, and confusion of the
mind. The evil results are well seen in sewing-women
living on tea and bread (256), who become excessively
"nervous," irritable, neuLralgic, and dyspeptic.  Tea-drinking in excess is only less harmful than alcoholic drunkenness (Attfield).

effects of which are expended chiefly on the nervous system.
At first it stimulates the functions of the brain. This stage
is of variable duration. The state of excitement is fobllowed by profound sleep, by a sleep from which the personi
is with difficulty aroused (coma), by insensibility, and perhaps by death.
314. This class of agents, when used for considerable
periods, causes abnormal tissue-nutrition.     Tile abnormal
tissue-nutrition induces changes in the structure of the
soft parts and perverted actions of the same.     To this class
belonig alcoholics, bromides, chloral, chloroform, ether, opium,
and tobacco. None of these agents sllould be used except
unider the orders of a medical person, and not beyond the
prescribed time.
315. ALCOHOL (ethyl alcohol, C2160) is made by fermentation from materials containing carbo-hydrates (174),
like  grape-juice, apple-juice, cane-juice, and    the sugars
derived  from   the starches of grains and       roots.   Pure
spirits, wines, ales, and beers owNe their exhilarating, intoxicating, sedative, and paralyzing effects to the alcohols
they contain.   The amount of this agenit ranges from     1.28
per cent. (small beer) to 56 per cent. (natural whiskey).
Amylie alcohol (fusel oil) is an impurity found in many
alcoholic beverages.
(a) ADlYLTC ALCo0HOL (C2H10) is highly poisonous. The results of a number of analyses have shown that certain natural wines (Alsace, Bordeaux) contain a notab)le proportion of filsel oil. It is also an ingredient in ravw whislcey, in gin, an(ld in certain brandies.
Fusel oil causes in animals tremors and muscular twitching "identical with the tremors
observed in the human subject during the alcoholic disease liknown as dlelirium tremens."'
(Richardseo.)

enter thie system  by way of the mouth.       They are mostly
absorbed   through   the  walls of the   blood-vessels of the
stomaell. They circulate in tile blood, and soon reach all
the soft tissues   of the  body   (84).   Small amiounts are
destroyed in the system, yielding heat and energy. The
non-destroyed portion exerts an inijurious and even poisonous effect on the tissues of all the soft parts (muscle, connective tissute, nlerve-cell, gland-cell).    The non-oxidized
portions are cast out of the system, for the most part, by
the way of the kidneys (265).
(a) The idea that alcohol is present in the breathl after wine or spirits have been
drunk, depends on the odor imparted by the presence of various ethers, ftusel oil, etc.,
and not upon alcohol (327, e). A quantity of pure, dilutted alcohol equal in volume to
half a bottle of champagne may be drunkli without tainting the breath ill the least;
and alcohol may be subcutaneously injected with the same result, though odor is immediately detected if a little fusel oil is added to it first. (Binz.)
317. TISSUE-MODIFICATIONS.-          Ethyl   alcohlol  circulating  more or less constantly in thle blood        modifies the
nutrition of imnportant tissues (nerve, gland, and connective), and influences for the worse the functions of important parts (brain, liver, gastric glands, and heart).     At first
the bulk of the connective tissue (236) is increased; later
it is reduced below normal.     The finctions of gland-tissue
and nerve-cell-tissue (276) are at first exalted; but after a
time they are lessened or suppressed. The tendency of
alcohol is to cause profound fatty      changes or hardening
changes in all the soft tissues of the body. Alcohlol is a
"genius of degeneration" (101, 132, 324 to 328).

habitual use of alcoholics by a well-fed person is unnecessary, and, moreover, it is harmful. The experience
of the British army in the Ashantee campaign-one of
the most trying of modern times-showed "that abstinence did not render those who abstained more sickly as
a whole, or more liable to malarious fever, nor did it interfere with their powers of marching."  The records of
the Eighty-fourth Regiment inL India "show that on both
tropical service and on marches in India the teetotallers
were more healthy, more vigorous, and far better soldiers
than those who did not abstain."  (Parkes.)  Alcohol has
been found to be mnost hurtful in moist, hlot climates (272).
319. Most travellers and explorers condemn the use of
spirits, and even of wine or beer, as a preventive against
cold. The Russian ariny on a march in cold weather has
no spirit ration. A man who has lately indulged is not
allowed to marchl.  The lumbermen of Canada, "employed upon the hardest work, and exposed to a freezing
temperature, are allowed no spirits, but have an unlimited
quLantity of tea" (311).
320. It has not been shown that the deftness and endurance of the hand-worker have been improved by the
irregular or regular use of alcoholics. Experience proves
that men doing very hard work, as iron-puddlers, glassblowers, prize-fighters under training, do their work more
easily without alcohol. It has not been )roved that users
of alcohlolics are capable of doing more or better literary
work than abstainers. It is " a question whether the power
of clear, consecutive, and continuous reasoning is not

always lessened." It is certain that abstainers hold up
under acute disease, injuries, or surgical operations better
than habitual drinkers. All epidemics prove that alcoholics do( not prevent disease, but the reverse.    It is settled
that alcoholics are the most potent, direct causes, in our time,
of poverty, crime, and disease.
321. Alcoholic stimulants ought never to be used for the
relief of nerve-pain like neuralgia, for in      such   circumstances the " alcohol-hlabit" is very likely to be formed.
Under sixty years of age the daily use of alcoholics ought
to be discouraged.
(a) A measure of alcohol which produces in a person a sudden effect, flushes the face, or
exhilarates, is a toxic dose for that person. Sucl a dose is usually followed by a depression felt throughout the system. It is a quantity short of this which is allowable.
One-fourth to one-half a teaspoonful of alcohol in much liquid may be a comimencing
dose. Frequent small doses produce the best effects. Ethyl alcohol is preferable to
spirits, wines, or beers for miost medicinal purposes, because it is pure, and it can be
accurately and readily measured.
322. Alcoholics, like chloral and opium, are dangerous
agents.-They act badly upon the young and upon the immature of eitiler sex. Their evil effects are more marked
on females than on males.      The attraction of these agents
for themselves is cumulative.     Their habitual use compels
use. Their activities so modify the organism and so weaken
the will-power as to establish a controlling craving for
them. This craving is difficult to combat, to turn aside,
or to suppress.    The human systerm      never fully recovers
when it has been once saturated with alcohol, opium, or to)acco. As it is uncertain whether a person who uses any
one or more of them    at all will not end by using them      in
injurious amounts, it is safest to abstain from     their use.

it be shunned? 322. Mention dangerous agents. What of their influence? Speak of the cumulative power; of the craving; of the

323. MALT LIQUORS. -The nutrient value of the malt,
bitters, acids, etc., of beer, ale, or porter, is very small.
The confirmed beer-drinker is as much ant alcoholist as the
wine- or spirit-drinker: the difference is only in degree.
Large numbers of persons in the United States are deeply
injured by mialt liquors without being drunkards.    The
moderate use of alcohol is a prominent factor in the causation of acute diseases, like coughs, colds, slight fevers,
rheumatisnm, etc.
324. Btichner's experiments show that diluted beer or
wine hinders digestion, and that the undiluted stays it for
hours. The steady use of malt liquors induces fatty diseasechanges in the soft tissues and the accumulation of masses
of unsound fat.  The liver, the heart, and, later, the kidneys, especially suffer. The brain is so modified that the
mind becomes sluggish, heavy, morose, and stolid.    The
habitual beer-drinker, thlough rotund, florid, and apparently vigorous, is in reality incapable of resisting disease.
Trivial injuries and maladies affect him seriously and very
often cause an early death.  "Beer is peculiarly deceptive
at first,-but is thoroughly destructive at the last."
325. WINE AND      SPIRITS.-The action of the ethyl
alcohol of wines differs from  that of spirits only in degree. The acids, sugars, ethers, coloring-ingredients, etc.,
exert slight special influences on the system.  They have
little nutrient power.  The use of wines produtces no
good effect on the healthy body. The habitual use of
spirits, and especially slightly-diluted spirits, leads to fatty
changes or hardening changes in all the soft parts. These

changes are more or less destructive            to  the  efficiency, endurance, and longevity of the human body.
(a) "Among the persons selected with care for physical soundness and sobriety, and
who are, as a rule, respectable and useful members of society, the death-rate is more
profoundly affected by the use of intoxicating drinks than from any other one cause,
apart fronm heredity." (J. L. Greene, Prest. Cons. Ml~utual Life fes. Co., 1883.)
(b) In Great Britain 25 per cent. of all insanlity is laid to alcoholic intemperance; in
the United States, 10 per cent.; and in France, about 15 per cent. The consumiption of
spirits in France, owing to the iutroduction of absinthe and cheap brandies, increased
from 32 gallons per hundred persons in the decade 1841-50) to 52 gallons in the decade
1861-70, and the percentages of insane from drink during the same periods were 7.83 and
14.78 respectively.
(C) THIE MORTALITY in London "amonig any considerable group of intemperate persons
will differ from that generally prevailing among adults in the following important particulars,-namely, a fourfold increase in the deaths from diseases of the liver and chylopoietic viscera; a twofold increase in the deathls froin disease of the kidney; an increase
of half as much again of those from heart-disease; a marked increase of those fiom
pimeumonia and pleurisy; a considerable increase and an earlier occurrence of those from
disease of the central nervous system; a marked decrease of those from bronchlitis,
asthma, emphysema, and congestion of the lungs; a (lecr(ase nearly as great of those fromll
phthisis, and a later occurrence, or at least termination, of the diselose; a very large decrease in those from old age, withl an increase of those referred to atrophy, debility, etc.,
anid the addition of a considerable group referred in general terms to alcoholism, or
chronic alcoholism, or resulting from accidents." (Report of Comminttee of Harveian Society,
1883.)
326. THE HEREDITY OF ALCOHOLISM is an established
fact.   The   continual use      of alcoholics produces        a  firmlyseated disease known as chronic alcoholism, which is characterized by a decided lowering of the mental and moral tone,
and by a noted falling off in the physical appearance, efficiency, and    endurance.       It entails upon      an   innocent posterity a tendency to insanity, idiocy, instability of mind,
weakness of mind, and a craving for alcoholics (287). The
evils of heredity are said to be more positive in beerdrinkers than      in  wine- or spirit drinkers.          According     to
Bruehl-Kramer, the influence of the alcoholic father is
worse than that of the intemperate mother.
326. What is certain? What is chronic alcoholism? What is its
entail? What has been noticed?140                      LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
(a) Of 300 idiots in Massachusetts, Dr. Howe referred 145 directly to intemperance.
A like proportion of insanity finds a similar reference. (Bascom.) Experience shows
that it is the habit of moderate drilnking in health, coupled with an inherited nervous
weakness, that leads to alcoholism in the educated; and among the hand-toilers, heredity,
poor food, ill-prepared, tasteless food, overcrowding, mental depression, and misery.
327. (a) ALCOHOLIC DISEASE-INDUCING ACTIONS.-It is difficult in the human organism
to assign to a particular agent its specific influence in producing a given disease-condition. In many cases of well-seated disease, alcohol is one of the many factors (heredity,
improper food, overcrowding, impure water, deficient clothinlg, dampness, exposure,
overexertion, etc.) leading to deteriorationl, degeneration, and disease. In some disorders it is the prime factor, but in others it plays all injurious though subordinate
part.
(b) Local Effect.-Alcoholics induce a warming, puckering effect on the membrane of
the mouth, fauces, oesophagus, and stomach. The induced warnith is soon felt over the
entire system. They cause an increased flow of blood to the walls of the stomach, and
excite the gastric glands to increased action. An excessive amlount, undiluted, stops
gland-action.
(c) Absorption.-Alcoholics entering the system by the way of the mouth mostly leave
the canal from the stomach, very little reaching the intestines. The blood returning to
the heart from the stomach passes by way of the portal veimi into the liver, in the
tubes of which gland it circulates. Hence the stomach and the liver bear the brunt of
the early influences of alcohol.
Lallemand, Perrin, and Duroy (1860), as the results of experiments, reported that alcohol undergoes no change in the body, that it cannot be digested and incorporated into
tissuie or any bodily substance. Binz, Henbach, and Schmidt (1870) concluded that by
far the larger part of any inlgested alcohol (30 to 50 c.c.-i1 to 2 ounces) is disposed of
within the organism  in the presence of tissue-change.  Anstie and Dupr6 (1872)
affirmed as the result of experiment that a certain amiount of alcohol disappeared in
the passage through the system. Jaillet (1882) demonstrated that in the presence of
hfemoglobin and oxygeni, alcohol (CoH60) is transformed into aldehyde (CH140), alnd
then into acetic acid (('aH402). Acetates are converted in the system into carbonates,
and eliminated as sucl, or into carbon dioxide (C02) and water (H20).
(d) Disposal.-" At present (1883) the weight of authority and the deductions of experiment are in favor of that view which maintains that within certain limits (one ounce
to one and a half ounce of absolute alcohol to a healthly man [in divided doses, well
diluted with water, in twenty-four hours]) alcohol is oxidized and destroyed in the
organism, and yields up force whicb is applied as nervous, muscular, and gland force."
(Bartholow.1) D)ujardin-Beaumetz (Paris, Acad. of Med., 1884) expressed an opinion
that the disposal of alcohol in the body differs with the amount takien. "When taken
in very small doses, it is transformed into acetic acid, and combines with the basic
substances in the blood; in larger doses the acetic acid is formed in the lungs by oxidation; in still larger doses it takes oxygen from blood-corpuscles as well as the lungs."
(e) Elimination.-Alcohol is eliminated slowly from the system   After the ingestion
of an excess (five ounces of whiskey) it has been detected in the urine as early as
ten minutes. Traces appear in the urine sixteen to twenty-four hours after its ingestion. With Geissler's vaporimeter as little as 0.05 per cent. of alcohol may he detected.
Prof. Binz (1870), using the vaporimeter, was able to recover in the urine less than six
per centt. of the alcohol ingested by the six patients experimented upon. In some determinations he failed to detect any. After the giving of upwards of one ounce of

absolute alcohol diluted with syrup, he affirms that in the lung-exhalations immediately
after, or at any period within six hours, not a trace of alcohb,, could be foutld. Reasoning from analogy, he regards it as impossible that the skin should eliminate any.
(f) Gastr-ic Action.-The habitual use of alcoholics in excess of the physiological dose
(321) produces structural alterations and functional derangements. Alcoholics induce
changes in the mucous surface of a corrugating and hardening nature. The gastric
glands, at first slightly enlarged and rendered more active, later become smaller and less
active. The connective tissue in the walls between the glands, at first enlarged (cauLsi,lg
pressure on the glands), later becomes markedly contracted. Hence, after a time, the
ability to secrete juices and to digest proteids is diininished or nearly suppressed. The
walls become thickened and coated with a thick slime, establishing chro,nic gastric catarrh.
(g) Gastric Cata1rrh is characterized by acidity, heart-burn, water-brash, morning
retching, and even vomiting. Starches and sugars introduced into a catarrhal stomach
soon undergo acid fermentationi. Ordinary foods remain long periods undigested, and(
they are so affected that the intestinal fluid action (240) is very much slowed.
(h) Hepatic Action.-Alcoholics induce increased activity of the liver-cells, and anl excessive growth of the connective tissue (236). The liver becomes larger. When the
maximum enlargement has been reached, the opposite ten(ldency comes into play, the
cell-activity dimiinishes, the connective tissue contracts, the liver becomes smaller thaln
normal, hard and nodular (' hob-nailed liver"), the rectal, intestinal, arild gastric circulations are impeded, rectal and renal troubles arise, dropsy appears, and "liver-disease" is
easily recognizable. Long indulgence in spirits is necessary to produce marked chanlges.
Excessive beer-drinking induces fatty degeneration of the liver.
(i) Hemic Actiona.-From disease of the stomach and liver follows disease of the blood.
Alcoholics interfere with the changes occurring in the blood necessary to the "ripening"
of the crude materials received from foods. They diminish the mobility of the corpuscles, remove oxygen from the hcemoglobin (327, d), and hinder the elimination of carbonic
acid arid nitrogenous wastes. The blood thus becomes laden with crude tissue-foods,
with tissue-wastes, and tissue-poisons. Itence malnutrition of the cells of the soft parts
of the system, as well as finctional bad action, must resuLlt.
(j) Cardiac Actiosi.-Alcoholics cause increased heart-actioni (500 to 800 extra beats
per hour) and increased unnecessary work. The periods of rest are shortened. In small
doses alcoholics are excitants; in large doses, heart-sedatives. The heart-muscle, especially in beer-drinkers, after a time gives evidence of enlargement followed by fatty
degeneration.
(k) Capillary Action.-Alcoholics derange (paralyze) the nerve-centres (282) controlling
the blood-supply to each part. As a result, the blood-flow becomes abnormally large,
then abnormally sniall, and unhealthy growth or nutrition follows. One of the early
effects of each dose, up to a certain point, is to perniit an abnormal amount of blood to
enter the skin and nerve-centre areas, causing a sense of warmth and exhilaration.
Heat-loss occurs rapidly (56), and chilling ensues. Soonl the exhilaration is followed by
depression, mental and physical.
(1) General Action.-Alcoholics retard the destruction of nitrogen and carbon compounds in the tissues. The consumers of alcoholics often increase in weight, but the fat
laid on is not firm, solid, and enduring. The temperature is subject to slight variations
only in habitual users. Often the alcoholic influence is such that in chronic alcoholism
the system is unable to utilize common foods, but can utilize large amounits of alcohol
daily and can derive force and energy from the same. Anstie instances a tailor who
lived for years on a bottle of gin and a small piece of white bread per day.
(ni) Pulmonory ancd Cutaneous Actioca.-Alcoholics lessen the carbonic acid elimination
by the way of the air-passages. They are not known to increase the oxygen-receiving142                     LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
function.  They cause structural changes leading to chronic bronchitis.  They are
capable of evoking miorbid clstaneeos phenlomena, and they bear an important part in the
maintenance and aggravation of pre-existing skin-disease, to which they sometimes impart a very serious character.
(n) Renal Action.-As in the liver (h), so in the kidneys, alcoholics early induce an increased activity and an inferred increase of bulk. The excretionl of alcohol by the way
of the kidneys induces one form of Bright's disease, similar to the form following scarlet
fever. After several years' excessive use of alcohlolics the kidney becomes contracted,
hard, and nodular (cirrhosis). Then the secretion of urine is markledly decreased, and
may be suppressed. Then the skin becomes dry and harsh, the face sallow and pinched,
and the entire system debilitated.
(o) Cerebral Action.-A blood habitutally laden with alcohol surging through the capillaries of the brain and nerve-centres induces a fatty change in the gray cells (276) and
an early thickening and a later contraction of the delicate connective tissue (236) holdiug the cells in place. Alcohol has a special affinity for nerve-cell tissues. Structural
changes are gradually proltduced. After a time the cerebrum shrinks and becomes firmer
than normal (sclerosis), and thle fluids occupying the ventricles of the brain increase in
orclder to lieep the brain-case filled. These changes are evidenced by the mental weakness, the moral weakness, the muscular tremors, and the irregular muscular movements
of the chronic inebriate (326).
(p) Toxic Action.-The action of alcoholics upon the brain varies with the quality, the
quantity, and the length of the influence. An exhlilarating dose causes certain trains
of ideas to flow easily, the senses to become nmore acute, and the muscular movements
more active and vigorous. Anr addlitional amount causes the cerebral excitemeilt to becomie disorderly, the ideas to be evolved in an irregular and rambling order, and the
muscular action to become disorderly and uncontrollable. Later, deep, heavy sleep
follows (intoxication).
(q) Lethsal Action.-Two tablespoonfuils of whiskey have been known to cause the death
of a child. In 1881 a niaii drank, on a wager, at one sitting, three pints of whiskey.
There was almost no stage of excitement, for hlie soon dropped insensible. The succes-.
sion of symptoms was as follows: a most frequent and feeble pulse, noisy breathing, cold
skin, loss of seilsation, collapse, and death; that is, the toxic dose overpowered the mental
and mnovement centres (282), slowedl those essential to life, and finally arrested the actions
of the centres presidimlg over respiration and circulatiomi (283).
328. ANESTHESIA              is  partial     death.      It   should      be
avoided, even       at the    expense- of much         pain, as in       teethextraction.      The   agents used overpower the conscious and
motor centres and obtund the circulatory and respiratory
centres    (283).     Chloroform       may     catse    death     by   sudden
arrest of thle heart's action without preceding warning
signs.     Ether causes death          through     the   respiratory     tract.
It gives signs of danger well known to the skilled admin328. Why should anesthesia be avoided?  What is the action of

istrator. Ether (ethyl oxide) is the safest ancesthetic. In
Lyman's statistics (1881) there are recorded three hundred
and sixty-eight cases of chloroform-death, and twentyseven of ether-death. No person, unless ordered by a competent physician, should whiff chloroform to annul pain.
329. BROMIDES are not free from danger. Their use
in excessive doses may induce headache, confusion of the
mind, and a sort of intoxication. Their habitual use often
induces pallor, anaemia, loss of muscular power, and constant drowsiness.  They have been known to cause weakness of mind and mental derangement.
330. CHLORAL is an agent of unceertain action. It is a
cumulative poison; i.e., after the taking of several doses with
little effect, sudden toxic symptomns appear.  It is a drug
which must be emiployed in increasing doses by its habitual
users in order to get the desired excitant or hypnotic effect.
The "chloral habit," like the "opium  habit," is fraught
with trouble and danger.
331. Chloral lessens the appetite and interferes with
digestion.  It induces weakness and irregularity of the
heart's action.  It reduces the vigor of the muscles. It
causes the mind to become dull and dreamy, the willpower to be lessened, the judgnlent to be impaired, and
the mental faculties to be blunted. Muscular fatigue is
a safer sleep-inducer than chloral.
332. OPIUM and its alkaloid, morphia, are dangerous yet
useful drugs.  Death has occurred to a nursing infant whose
mother had taken a medicinal dose of opium.   One drop

of laudanum has proved fatal to a child under six months.
"Soothing syrups," designed for infants, usually containl
opium in uncertified amnounts. They are dangerous compounds.   They cultivate au "opitnum  habit."  It is not improbable that the infantile "opium    habit" contributes to
the adult "alcohol habit" (326, a).
333. The habitual use of opium    preparations induces a
marked   change in the system.     It engenders an uncontrollable craving for the drug (322).    It diminishes the
appetite, enfeebles the muscles, and lessens the fat. The
skin becomes sallow, parchment-like, and shrivelled. In
adults, the will-power, the memory, and the moral tone
deteriorate.  The users become inattentive to their proper
duties.  Their whole endeavors are shaped       towards the
indulgence of the "opium habit." Opium preparations
should never be used beyond the period prescribed by a
prudent physician.
(a) The hypodermic method of talking morphia is the most dangerous,-immediately,
from an overdose; remiotely, from the establishment of the "morphine habit." The
smoking method is the least injurious. The modern tobacco and opium cigarettes are a
seductive and dangerous compound.
334. TOBACCO contains several active alkaloids, among
them nicotine, and several acids. They very rapidly enter
the blood through the mucous surfaces (106) by the smoke,
the siuft, or the swallowed saliva. The alkaloids modify
the energy of the nerxvous system, interfere with tissuechange, and impair nutrition.   They are mainly eliminated
by the kidneys.

and retard the symmetrical development of the body. It
induces, in many cases, an irritable and irregular action of
the heart, which is manifested by palpitations, fleeting pains
in the vicinity of the heart, faintness, and dizziness.  It
frequently causes a loss of control over the muscles, especially of the forearm and arm. Drawing-masters have
noticed that young smokers fail to draw "a clean, straight
line."
336. Mental Influence. It is an obstacle to mental application and mental growth. It impairs the memory.
Under the orders of Napoleon III., the records of the students of the government schools were kept in two classes,
those of the smnokers and those of the non-smokers. After
a time it was found that the smokers were markedly inferior,
physically, mentally, and morally, to the abstainers. As a
result of these investigations, an order was issued prohibitinlg the use of tobacco by the government students.
337. The reports of its influence on the digestive function are conflicting. A few cases have been reported of
injury to the retina and the nerves of vision.  Certain
organs are at first over-stimulated, but eventually become
much weakened. This stimrulation enconrages pernicious
acts (305, a). The children of excessive tobacco-users are
quite frequently found to be weak, nervous, and prone to
the alcoholic habit (326, a).
338. Chewing and Snqffing.- The presence of the tobacco
and the movements of the lower jaw excite the salivary and
mucous glands to great activity. This increased secretion
is swallowed or expelled. The presence of the tainted se336. How does tobacco influence the mind? What was noticed in

cretions injures the membranes, blunts the sense of taste,
debilitates the gums, injures the enamel of the teeth, discolors the teeth, and probably interferes with the change
of starches to sugar (238). The powdered snuff fouls the
nostrils, blunts thle sense of smell, irritates the nasal passages, and causes a persistent catarrhal condition.
339. Tobacco-smoke, laden with carbonic acid, organic
acids, and alkaloids and unburnt carbon, and having a high
temnperature, causes the throat to become dry and red, and
the tonsils to enlarge. The persistent inhalation of smoke
induces the "smoker's sore throat." Tobacco-smoke aggravates a nasal and throat (Fig. 18) catarrll, markedly injures the quality of the voice (142, a), and often induces
redness and painful sensations upon the eye-surfaces.      By
extension up the Eustachian tube the smoker's throat-catarrh
often causes deafness (348).
340. Smoking.-The cigarette affords the most, and the
long-stemmned, porous-bowled pipe the least, objectionable
method of smoking. With the cigarette more of the hot
smoke enters the air-passages, more of the acids and alkaloids
reach the mucous surfaces, and more of the injurious materials enters the blood than with the cigar or the pipe. The
influence of the cigarette-smoke is felt throughout the system.   If the influence is not kept up by repeated smoking,
"ennui, malaise, indolence, and muscular inertness follow."
(a) Cigarette-tobacco is moister than cigar- or pipe-tobacco. In most cases less of its
alcaloids have been lost by evaporation. Furthermore, mnany cheap cigarettes are made
of refuse tobacco and cigar-stumps. As a rule, cigar-stumps contain the bulk of the
alkaloids and acids of the burnt portion, and hence the stumps are excessively charged
with the toxic agents. The pernicious effects of cigarettes are not due to the paper used,
but to the agents present in the tobacco.
339. What exist in tobacco-smoke? What is induced? What
may happen? 340. Speak of smoking. Of cigarette-smoke and of
its influence.

341. Tobacco is the bane of the youth of the world. No
boy of ten to fourteen can begin the practice of smoking or
chewing without becoming as a man mentally and physically less efficient than he would otherwise have become.
(a) Uvon the adult tobacco is not void of injurious effects. Many soldiers in the late
war suffered fromn a nervous weakness,-" tobacco heart." It has a bad effect on the
minority of healthy adults who use it in moderation. Its worst effects usually subside
when the habit is given up. It is probable that it has enabled somnle men to endure
himnger, privations, cold, and hardships better than they could have done without it. It
has not been shown that it enhances the physical or mental powers of those not habituated to its use. " Moderate smiokers can do more work than excessive smnokers." (B. W.
Richardson.) Robust adults working out of doors are less impressed by its bad effects
than persons of sedentary habits.
(b) Precautions.-It is best not to smoke. If habit compels a person to smoke, then use
a long-stemmed pipe having a soft porous bowl; procure a new pipe at frequent intervals; avoid a well-colored pipe; smoke out of doors or in a well-ventilated room; and
wash the mouth thoroughly after each indulgence. If cigars must be used, then employ
a long holder made of porous materials.

THE SENSE-ORGANS.
342. ToucH.-The tip of the tongue, the lips, and the
tips of the fingers are the main sensitive parts.  To preserve delicacy of touch, the fingers should be exposed to
wear the least possible.  They should never be put in hot
water. For cleansing use warm, soft water, fine soap
(62, a), ammonia-water, anld a brush. Nails are best
cleansed with an ivory toothpick, and trimmed with a
file.
343. THE TONGUE (Fig. 24, C, 6) contains the nerveendings concerned with taste. A temperature of 72~ F.
(22~ C.) is most favorable to taste.  Taste is not well (developed in too hot or too cold dishes. It is injured and
perverted by the use of tobacco, condiments, and stimulants, and by too numerous food-admixtures. It is a protective. It often gives early warning of deleterious foods
(200).
344. THE UPPER NASAL PASSAGES (Fig. 24, A) contain the nerve-endings concerned with smell. The sense
of smell is a protective. It is the most available test for
air-impurity (116). Its acuteness may be cultivated (teatasters), or mnay be blunted (saloon-loafers). The sharpness of the sense is blunted by the use of snuff, smelling342. Mention the more sensitive parts. Speak of care of the

injured by breathing an air lad(en with smoke, sewage-gas,
gases from decaying goods and foul clothes, and by the
gases arising from diseased lungs, larynx, pharynx, and
mouth (116).
345. When air, clothing, or the body is offensive to this
sense-organ, then ventilate (153) and use cleansing agents,
-hot water, soap, disinfectants, and heat (267, C). Do
not mask the filth-odors with strong perfumes, as is the
custom in Arabia and the far East-and in the United
States.

deeply seated within the hardest portion of the temporal
bone (Fig. 1). Waves of sound reach the internal ear
(Fig. 26, 7) most readily by way of the meatus (external
canal (Fig. 26, l).  The range of distinct hearing of the
ordinary humnan voice is limrnited to a distance of twentythree to twenty-seven feet (seven to nine metres) from  the
speaker.
347. HEARING is impaired by colds and inflamnmations
following the same. After washing the hair, dry it rapidly.  During the cold season do not cut the hair too
close.  Avoid exposing the neck or the side of the head
to draughts of cool or cold air. Do not use metallic earscoops or knives, because of the danger of injutry to the
membrana (Fig. 26,' 2).
348. COLDS AND CATARRHAL DISEASES of the throat
(Fig. 18, 1) often extend fromi the pharynx to the middle
ear (Fig. 26, 3. 6) by the way of the Eustachian tube (Fig.
26, 14). The immoderate use of tobacco excites throattroubles, which in turn extend to the middle ear, givilng
rise to more or less deafness.  Avoid the use of tobacco.
Cure conmmencing catarrhs as soon as possible.
349. EAR-WAx.--Keep the external canal clean. In
health the wax of the meatus (Fig. 26,') dries, scales, aind
falls out.  If the wax becomes hardened, do not scoop it
out. At night rutn in a few drops of glycerin an(l water,

sudden compression of air in thle meatus may rupture the
membrana (Fig. 26, 2).    The wearing of cotton in the canal
is improper.    The cotton interferes withi hearing, and it
lowers the natural power of resistance against cold. In
all ear-troubles consult a good surgeon. Avoid all advertised nostrums.
351. FOREIGN BODIES IN THE CANAL OR MEATUS.Remove vegetable bodies as soon as possible. Run a stream
of water in at one side of the object; or fill the ear with
warmi oil, especially in case of insect intruders.       Thus the
bodies are floated out. If these agents fail, make a loop
of clean, twisted wire, introduce it into the canal along one
side of the passage, turn the handle half round, noose the
body, and jerk it out.
(a) DEFECTIVE HEARING is growing more prevalent in the United States. It produces
in children an appearance of stupidity. They carlnot hear sounds distinctly, and, as a
result, callnot imitate sounds accurately. Defects in the teeth of the young are a great
cause of deafniess. (Sextons.) It has heen estimated that not more than 5 per cent. of the
people of the United States have perfect ears. (Bell.) From 20 to 25 per cent. of schoolchildren hear imperfectly. (Gelld.) Deaf-mutes should not intermarry (287). The hearing of school-children and railroad-men ought to be tested at regular intervals.
352. IN THE RETINA of the eyeball are located the
nerve-endings   concerned with    sight.   The   rays of light
fromn an object enter the dark chamber through the cornea
(Fig. 27, h, h), are benlt out of their course by the lens (Fig.

354. NEAR-SIGHT.--A near-sighted person cannot see
the fixed stars distinctly. He can see near objects very
distinctly. In most cases the axis of the eyeball is too
long (antero-posterior). The coats (Fig. 27) of a "long354. Speak of near-sight; of its main cause. What may occur?THE SENSE-ORGANS.
eye" hlave been weak. The great cause of the lengthening
of the ball is a too early and too prolonged eye-strain upon
small objects by young and feeble children. If the lengthening is not arrested, the near-sight will tend to increase.
355. MANAGEMENT.-Every near-sighted child, youth,
or adult should be provided with glasses which will make
seeing easy and clear within six to ten feet. For near work,
the glasses should enable the person to see distinctly ten to
twelve inches from   the eyes.  The glasses are used to enable
the myope to keep the work away from the eyes, not to see
more distinctly. Each eye should be fitted. Use only the
best glasses. Spectacles are better for the eyes than eyeglasses. Myopes should not bend over their work or hlold
their heads near hot lights.
(a) MYOPIA.-The report of Dr. Risley (1881) shows that in Philadelphia, in the primary schools, there is 4.27 per cent. of myopia, that the percentage steadily increases as
the pupils pass to higher gradcles in the public schools, and that in the highlest grade tllhere
is 19.33 per cent. of myopia. Drs. Loring and Agnew found that in New York City there
was 3.5 per cent. in the youngest classes and 26.78 per cent. in the highest. Dr. Derby
(1883) reports, as the results of the examination of four consecutive classes at Amherst
(Mlassachusetts) College, that 34 per cent. out of 254 were myopic at entrance and 47 per
cent. at graduation. In 32 cases the myopia remained stationary, and in 58 cases it
increased.
356. FLAT-EYES.-In        the "fiat-eye"    the axis of the
eyeball (antero-posterior) is too    short.   Its  apparatus    is
unable to make a clear, sharp picture on the retina. The
owner of such eyes lives in a visual mist or fog and strain,
and rolls the eye inward in his efforts to see. This gives
rise to an "internal squint." Such eyes soon become tired.
They are weak and imperfect eyes. They readily become
diseased eyes, and frequently myopic.       They are common
among    weak   school-children.    Glasses sometimes afford

153LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
benefit, at other times fail.  A skilled oculist can alone
select proper glasses for such eyes. Out-of-door pursuits,
with suitable glasses, afford the best aid.
357. WEAK EYES (asthenopic) may be correct in structure, but their muscles are weak and their nerves of sight
soon weary. If well used, they are capable of considerable
service. They require frequent and long rests. Children
after whooping-cough, scarlet fever, diphtheria, etc., suffer
from weakness of the eye-muscles.  Weak spectacles are
then to be recommended.    Paper with high gloss is unfavorable for them. They are most benefited through an
improvement in the body-health.
358. PREVENTION OF EYE-DISEASE.-Secure a pure
and a clear air. Tobacco-smoke, fire- or lamp-smokle, dusts,
and emanations from steaming dirty clothing are injurious
to young eyes. The eyes, the spectacles, the window-panes,
and the lamp-chimneys should be kept clean. The washing of the eyes with clear, soft water is beneficial. Hot
water should be used only under a surgeon's direction.
Avoid eye-washes containing lead. A dilute solution of
borax (ten grains to the ounce of water) is a safe household
wash.
359. The CAUSES of infantile sore eyes andcl blindness are
carelessness and ignorance, rather than injuries or disease.
Feeble children should not be urged to study over fine
letters or pictures (354).  Weak children should not be
sent to school until they have been brought into a state
of fair health by out-of-door pursuits. The probability of
harm  resulting from  school life dinminishes with every

added year. Weak children ought never to read or study
by lamp-light.
360. PRECAUTIONS.-The eyes of all children, but especially of school-children, should be examined at regular
intervals. Having never enjoyed better vision, children
are not conscious of their optical defects. All defects of
vision should be promptly corrected.  The "long-eyed"
and the "flat-eyed" should constantly wear their appropriate glasses. Children should use well-printed, broadmargined, large-typed books. The small-typed, narrowmargined, abominably-printed editions of standard authors
are dangerous aids to knowledge. Tinted paper and letters
are preferable to white paper and black letters.
361. LIGHT.-Solar light is healthy (152). It is a necessity to the eye. Solar light is the best light. Too much,
too dazzling, or too little light is hurtful.  Solar light
entering through low windows and then being reflected up
fromn polished floors is injurious. The eyebrows and lashes
can protect the eye from too strong light from above, but
not from below. Unsteady light, as in a jolting car, light
with shadows, and light directly entering the eyes are dangerous lights.
362. Large windows, and large, clear, uniform panes of
glass, are desirable in all work- or study-rooms (150).
Evening twilight affords a dangerous light. The darkness
steadily increases, and the eyes are being mrnore and more
strained in order to utilize the little light. Let the solar
light come upon the work from above, behind, and the left
side. All work demanding close eye-attention should be

done under solar light. Reading demands greater eyeeffort than copying, and copying than common letterwriting.
363. ARTIFICIAL IIGHTS should be white, uniform, and
steady.   The argand-burner student-lamp and the argandburner table gas-lamp afford good artificial light. A white
porcelain shade with a green outer surface is to be commended.    As a rule, the light ought to      be placed   to the
left front of the worker, the flame being slightly above the
level of the eyes. The central chandelier of the diningor sitting-room is too distant a light to study by. If the
eyes become dry, place a moist sponge near the lamp. Rest
the eyes at frequent intervals. As far as possible, avoid
evening study (297).
(a) The electcic light is inferior to solar light. All artificial lights except the electric light
contaminate the air. At the "twelve-candle standard," coal-gas vitiates 34S, paraffine oil
484, composite candclles about 650, and tallow candles 933 cubic feet of air per hour, blt
the electric light none. The amount of heat produced in the same time by the same
lights is represented by the numbers 279, 362, 383, 505, and 14. The eyesight of the men
in the British General Post-Office has been greatly improved since the electric lights
were introduced. (CS-omptoe.)
364. COLOR-BLINDNESS is an inability of certain persons
to distinguish certain Colors.    The mnost common       form  is
the inability to distinguish reds and greens from          each other.
Commonly the color-blind are able to distinguish them in
ordinary weather by the intensity of the lights; butt in hazy
or foggy weather this test often fails them. No color-blind
person  should   be permitted to act as a locomtotive-driver,
trainman, signal-man, or deck-officer (a).

the nerve-centres. It acts (partly through the nerves) upon
the sense-organs, always impairing the selnses of taste
and smell, and many smokers find their sight and hearing
seriously affected by it. The testimony of oculists and
aurists upon this point is, we believe, uniform and most
positive.

157CHAPTER XVI.
THE MUSCLES.
366. THE SKELETAL MUSCLES (19) are under the control of the will (282). When they shorten their fibres, the
parts to whichi they are attached are moved.  In miost
movements several muscles act together.   The proper
movements of a part, as of the hand, depend more upon
the proper order and proper amount of the shortening than
upon the force of the contractions (18). Thie skilled artisan
uses his muscle-power to good advantage; the new apprentice cannot.
367. ENERGY OF MUSCLE.-TlThe source of muscular
energy is the chemical changes occurring in the chemical
substances in the muscle. A part of the immediate musclefood is stored up in the muscle. This food is mainly
carbo-hydrate (174).
368. ACTION OF MusCLE.-During muscle-work there
is an increased consumption of oxygen by the muscle,
and consequently an increased production of lactic acid
(C3H603) and carbonic acid (H2C03). The excretion of
nitrogen wastes (265) is but slightly increased. During
the contractions heat and muscular force are manifested.
369. SYSTEMATIC EXERCISE.-The termn "exercise" is
usually restricted to the actions of the skeletal muscles

(Fig. 28). It should include the indirect training of the
eye, ear, conscious centres, motor centres (283), and the
internal organs, induced through regulated mnovements.
The object of systematic exercise is to (levelop and maintain a sound, well-drilled, well-balanced organism.
370. INFLUENCE OF MUSCLE-EXERCISEs.-The lungaction is hurried.  The blood-flow through the lung is
augmented.   The qiuantity of air inspired and of carbonic
acid expired is increased. The capacity of the air-tubes is
enlarged.
371. The action of the heart increases rapidly in force
and frequency. The flow of the blood through all parts is
fuller anld freer. The blood-flow in the working mnuscle
becomes larger than in the resting mnuscle. The heartmuscle imrproves in strength and in capacity for work.
372. The skin becomes reddened, from the filness of
the vessels.  The sweat glands (54) work more efficiently.
The increased evaporation fromn skin- and air-passages
controls the rising temperatutre (55). The blood-flow in
the kidneys is augmented.  The waste salines and nitrogen
wastes (265) of the systemin are more rapidly and better
removed.
373. The appetite is much improved.  The demand for
mueats and fats, rather than for starches and sugars, is noticed (179).  Under exercise the digestion improves and
the utilization of the food(s in the alimentary canal beconmes more perfect.
374. The action of the brain is indirectly affected.

Hlow is the skin affected? the kidneys? What results? 373. What
effect on appetite? on digestion?  374. What influence on brain?

160THE MUSCLESo
Under exercise the brain receives better blood. The reception of better blood renders nerve-cell action better and
quicker. The improved brain-nutrition gives the mind
an increased ability to overcome mental obstacles.
375. The skeletal muscles become heavier. Up to a certain point, peculiar to each person, their strength increases
with the work demanded of thiem. The capacity for endurance is increased. The muscles acquire ability to contract with greater rapidity and precision. Und(ler continued
exercise the smooth muscle-fibres of the blood-tubes and
alimentary canal appear to gain power.
376. A SOUND BODY, rather than a strong body, is
needed. All cannot be sound, or sounid and strong, but
all may be improved. Judicious exercise tends to establish an accord between heart, lung, muscle, stomach, ki(dney, and skin. This accord best permits the owner of the
organism to perform the duties of life efficiently, regularly,
and without miarked physical discomfort.
377. THE VALUE of a systematic muscle and nervoussystem drill is well shown in emergencies, as fire, runaways, shipwreck, etc. The trained person is conscious of
power. His trained muscles, trained nerves, an(l quicklyapprehending brain enable him to act promptly, judiciously, and efficiently.
378. CONDITIONS FOR EXERCISE.-It is preferable that
exercise should be taken in the early morning hours, and
out of doors or in an open shed. Flannel is the best material for an exercise suit. The suit should be of strong
material, loose-fitting, yet not baggy. No part of the suit

should in the least impede the movemeniits of the neck,
chest, or abdomen.
379. The shoes (33) should afford plenty of room all
around the foot. The sole should be thinnest and narrowest at the "waist," where elasticity is wanted; broad
and thick at the "tread," where protection is most required; long, so as not to limit the foot-extension, for the
foot is slightly lengthened with every step, and especially
in running or juniping; and broad, in order not to crowd
the toes. The heels must be low and broad.
380. The heart demands graduated exercise.  It should
be methodically worked into vigorous action,-slow walk,
quick walk, trot, run, quick walk, slow walk, or other
graduated exercise.  The heart's action must be closely
watched. Frequency of beats (110-140), inequality of
beats, painful or irregular action, point to the need of
rest. Later, a more moderate or(ler of exercises must be
followed.
381. Lung-action.-Under improper exercises the heart
beats so rapidly that the lungs are unable to take the inrushing blood-stream sufficiently fast. Breathlessness and
a sensation of oppression in the chest follow.  By methodical, graduated exercise alone can the lungs be drilled
into accord with the heart-action. As soon as the respirations become labored, rest must be taken, or mischief will
result. "A boat-race has become a matter of wind rather
than muscle." i(Maclaren.)

the intervals between exertions or immediately after exercise it should be well covered.     The slightest sensation of
chilliness of the surface must be prevented.           The  skin
must be kept clean. After exercise, a sponging with tepid
water, a vigorous rul)bing, the putting on of warm, woollen garments, and an adequate rest should follow.
383. ALCOHOLIC DRINKS ought always to be avoided
by persons who wishl strong and vigorous muscles.            The
muscles generally, and especially the heart-substance (which
is mnuscular), are liable to degenerative changes under the
influence of alcoholic stimulants.        Tobacco interferes with
muscular development chiefly through the nervous system.
Precision and elasticity of movement are wanting to the
youthfuil tobacco-smoker.      Body and     mnind  alike  suffer.
No growing boy can safely use tobacco in any form.
384. Rest is essential at frequent intervals.      It enables
the blood to remove the wastes from nerve and muscle, and
it permits these parts to lay up new stores of oxygen (368).
The rest must be taken in a pure atmosphere (114). It
must be of such a length as will enable the muscles to
regain their tone and later to work with ease and vigor.
Untrained muscles demand more frequent and longer rests
than trained ones.
(a) TRAINING is accomplished by a course of graduated exercises, by restricting the
carbo-hydrates and increasing the fats and proteids of the diet, by the judicious use of
water, and by abstaining from dissipation and the use of excitants and sedatives. No
one should enter upon a course of training until he has been examined and passed by a
competent gymnast-physician. The great dangers in athletics lie in over-training, or
in shirking training yet attempting to do the expected work. When these extremes
are avoided, the human system is benefited. As a whole, training and athletic competitions probably ward off more diseases than they produce.
(b) METHODICAL EXERCISES.-Calisthenics and dancing cultivate grace and ease of motion.

CHAPTER I.
HEALTH AND DISEASE.
1. HYGIENE is the science of health. It aims to make
growth-physical, mental, and moral-more perfect. It
also aims to prolong the period of active life; to make life
vigorous and efficient; and to defer the hour of death.
In order to study this science intelligently, we must have
some knowledge of Anatomiy (which is the science of the
structure of the body), and of Physiology, which treats of
the proper work or duty of the various parts or organs of
the body, and especially of the organs in a state of health.
More or less study of these two sciences, Anatomy and
Physiology, is, as we have said, necessary to even the most
elementary course in Hygiene. A more extended survey
requires an examination of the facts of Pathology, the
science of disease. This important science treats not only
of the changes in structure wrought by disease, but also of
perverted functions, or abnormalities in the work of the
various organs. In this book notice is taken of pathological
facts having special importance in the study of Hygiene.
2. HEALTH is an absence of dis-ease. That individual
is healthy in whom the more important functions of life

11LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
Gymnastics develop strength, power, and endurance. Athletic sports increase courage,
perseverance, and the power to adapt one's self to emergencies. Military drill induces
an erect, precise carriage, and cultivates patient endurance and unquestioning obedience.
385. THE KINDS OF EXERCISE should be selected in
accordance with the physical wvants of the individual. The
young farmer should bend his knees and hips more, and
his back less; the lady, the student, and the clerk need to
call all their muscles into action; the shoemaker, the muscles of the thlorax, abdomen, etc. The object to be kept
in view  in arranging exercises is to employ those movements which will drill the non-developed parts into an
accord( with the parts more efficient in their action (26).
386. ALL EXERCISES should interest the mind as well
as strengthen the muscles. Daily work in the garden,
provided the person does all kinds of work, is a good form
of exercise. No kind of exercise is so well calculated to
develop all parts of the body in the female and to promote
good health as house-work.
387. Walking, in order to be of benefit, muest be active
enough to excite perspiration in cool weather.  Running is
a most excellent exercise.    In quick walking, running,
and rowing with the slide-seat, most of the work is done
by the muscles of the limbs: hence these exercises should
be supplemented by Indian club, dunmb-bell, rope and
ladder exercises, and active vocalization (142).
388. Sports are to be highly commended.         Base-ball,
foot-ball, cricket, swimming, skating, gunning, and the
riding of a restive horse are most excellent. Lawn-tennis
385. What formns of exercise ought to be taken?  Examples?

is one of the best of modern games, especially for girls.
It calls the eye and the mental and motor nerve cells into
interested action, and make demands on most of the muscles of the body.
389. THE AMOUNT OF EXERCISE should be adjusted
to the age and the power of the person. All mlovements
must be kept within his strength and capacity. Exercise
beyond the point of fatigue is injurious.  Prolonged,
severe efforts ought not to be required until the system is
drilled and hardened by work, exercise, and maturity.
390. During childhood boys and girls should take part
in the same sports (31) and be trained ill similar duties, as
garden-work and house-work. DuLring the period froin
fourteen to twenty years of age such an amount of out-ofdoor exercise, in addition to daily duties, should be taken
by all as will induce sound, healthy sleep fromn 9 P.M. until
5.30 or 6.30 A.M.
391. All adults, especially business men and women not
engaged in house-work, will be benefited by a daily walk,
and most should have in addition abdominal, thoracic, arm,
and vocal drills. As a rule, a five-mile walk, in addition
to daily duties, will be about sufficient for a business-man
or clerk. Continued physical training, as exemplified in
the lives of Bryant (1794-1878) and Ericsson (1803-18-),
alone secures prolonged happiness, efficient, enduring mental
labor, and length of life.

THE FRAMEWORK.
7. ORGANS AND TISSUES.-AS seen by the physiologist,
man is a complex living machine. The continued existence of this machine is dependent upon the performance
of various functions. These functions, or duties, are assigned to certain organs or parts, as circulation to thle heart
and blood-tubes (83).
8. The organs are made up of suitable materials, mostly
soft, called tissues, as fat, muscle, and epithelium.  Tissues
are made up of combinations of simple substances called
elements, such as carbon, iron, sulphur.
9. CHEMICAL ELEMENTS.-The normal body includes
only fourteen elements in its composition.  Carbon, by
weight, forms the main element.
10. The elements are: oxygen, O; hydrogen, H; nitrogen, N; carbon, C; sulphur, S; phosphorus, P; fluorine,
F1; chlorine, C1; sodium, Na (natrium); potassium, K
(kalium); calcium, Ca; magnesium, Mg; silicon, Si; and
iron, Fe (ferrum).
11. THE FRAMEWORKIC of the human body consists of
the bones, which, taken together, constitute the skeleton
(Fig. 1). The bones whlen in the body are moist and(
pinkish-white in color. Dry bone consists of about one7. What is man? Upon what does the continuance of life depend?

third animal matter (comnpounds of C, with H, O, N, S, and
P) and two-thirds of mineral matter (compounds mainly
containing Ca, Na, K, C1, Fl, P, and S).
12. THE SKELETON gives general form to the body
(Fig. 1). It protects and supports the soft parts of the
interior. It gives effect and precision to the actions of the
muscles (Fig. 28).  Its separate pieces, two hundred in
number, are held together by strong, non-elastic, flexible
bands, called ligaments (Fig. 4).

Ligaments of the patella.
* *, The synovial miembrane.
6, Bursa.
13. A JOINT is a junction of two
or more bonies (Fig. 2). Joints allow
motion of one bonle upon another,
thus permitting movements of the
animiial frame.
14. CARTILAGE.-The ends of the
bones of a movable joint (knee, elbow,
ankle, etc.) are covered by a thin layer
of bluish-white elastic cartilage (Fig.
3). This substance closely adheres to
the ends of the bones. Its joint-surface is very smooth, and in the normal
state is bathed with synovia.  The
cartilage-layer affords elasticity and
facilitates motion.
15. THE SYNOVIA is a whitish, viscid, glairy fluid, similar in appearance to the white of an egg. It is secreted
by a memtbrane lining the inner surface of the ligaments
(Fig. 2, **). It serves the same purpose as do the oils or
grease when they are used on the bearings of machinery.

16. LIGAMENTS are the proper ties of the bones (12).
They bind the bones very firmly, yet permit, in certain
directions according to the joint, very free movements
(Fig. 3, 2, 3; Fig. 4, 5, 6).

17. THE FLESH includes the soft, red parts of the body.
The parts of the mass, called muscles, are for the most part
attached  to  the  skeleton  at definite  points.    There   are
upwards of three hundred and seventy muscles.
18. THE MUSCLES constitutte the lean       meat.   Muscle is
largely made    up  of fibres.   In  the  living  animal these
fibres are endowed with contractility. Contractility is the
power of self-shortening.
16. What do ligaments permit?   17. Speak of flesh; of muscles.
18. What is muscle? Contractility?
b                      2*LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
19. The fibres of SKELETAL MUSCLES (367) have minute
cross-markings (stria). Skeletal muscles are attached directly to the bones, or indirectly by means of tendons (Fig.
4, 1.3).  The TENDONS are firm   white bands or cords
Jwhich merge at one end in the muscle and are attached to
the bone at the other end.
20. HYGIENE OF BONES.-Thle health of bones is promoted by regular exercise of the skeletal muscles (375).
The kind and amount of exercise should be adapted to the
age, health, and development of the bones.   The soft,
flexible, cartilage-like bones of the child and the brittle
bones of the aged are not adapted for severe exertions or
for long-continued labor.
21. The lower extremzities of the very young are not
adapted to sustaining much weight.  "Bandy" or "bowlegs" are, in a measure, due to learning to walk too early.
Children's chairs should be of such height tlhat the feet of
the child can rest on a firm support. A clhild should not

can be made to assume imnproper shapes (32). At birth
most of the bones of the infant are not united, and the
heads of the long bones are easily separated from the central portions. Hence too much care cannot be taken to
prevent deformities.

should be exercises calling the muscles of both sides of the
body into action, such as rowing, tree-climbing, wrestling,
etc.
25. A person can stand longer, walk farther and more
easily, and perform more labor if he habitually preserves
an erect attitude.  If an erect position is maintained, when
possible, during childhood and youth, the cartilages of the
spine will preserve their normal shape, and the bones of
the spine, pelvis, and limbs will become firm and solid,
retaining their normal outlines. By steady and careful
attention, cornmbined with proper muscular exercises, a
stooping habit can be corrected.
26. LEFT-HANDEDNESS.-In the daily duties of life
children should be encouraged to use both hands and
both limbs. If such a habit becomes fixed, the right and
left halves of the body will be equally strong and efficient.
Both sides of the body being equally developed, corsets or
stays will not be needed to prevent lateral curvature or to
enable the person to sit or stand erect. The carrying of
burdens or weights upon the head tends to produce an
easy, erect carriage.
27. EXERCISE.-At rising, before dressing (and after undressing, before retiring), it would be well for all, students
especially, to practise a few movements.  Take several
deep and prolonged respirations. Place the hands, palms
together, in front of the chest, oln a level with the fourth
rib, then sweep them around to the rear in that plane.
Repeat this movement a number of times. Then stand
erect, heels together, the feet forming an angle of 90~, raise

DEFORMITIES, DISEASES, AND INJURIES OF THE
FRAMEWORK.
28. THE ALL-WISE made each bone and cartilage and
joint for certain specific functions.  He gave to each part
its proper size and shape, assigned to each system of parts
definite relative proportions, and so adapted the means to
the ends in view that each part could do its designed duty
easily, readily, and efficiently.
29. A DEFORMITY is a notable departure from the normal formn of a part, as of a bone, or of a joint. There are
three kinds of deformities,-natural, acquired, and artificial.
A natural deformity is one present at birth, like club-foot.
The others appear after birth, like bow-legs and deformed
spine.
30. ACQUIRED DEFORMITIES commonly result from injuries, from joint-disease, from  non-use of a part, from
improper food, or from nerve-disease. The want of bonemaking materials in the foods is a fertile cause of deformities among the poor, and especially those who live in dark,
damp houses (145).  In the well-fed classes deformities are
more common among girls than among boys.
31. PREVENTION OF D EFORMITIES.-Among children

lated houses, the ability to recover from slight injuries is
vastly less than that of robust children (39). The feeble
mnust be brought into the sunshine and urged or forced
to use their muscles. By causing a part to do its duties
daily, many diseased couditions leading to deformity can be
amended(. Proper braces and supports enable the patient
to be in the sunshine anId to take exercise. An anxious
mother consulted the celebrated surgeon Cline as to what
she should do to prevent her daughter from being deformed.  He answered, "Let her have no stays, and let
her rLun about like the boys."

this class are unnecessary. They are injurious not onily
to the deformied part buit also to the entire frame.   They
hinder a part in the performance of its proper functions.
They often render a part worse tihan useless.   Among the
commoni deformities are corns, bunions, ingrowing nails,
abnormal feet, moulded heads, constricted waists, etc.
33. CUSTOM ordains that there shlall be forehead-flattening in the children of New Hebrides, and that the feet of
all Chinese girls of rank shall be mnade into shapeless and
almost useless stumps. In America,fashion decrees that a
boot of a certain form shall be worn, and men and women,
old and young, crowd their feet into the new mould. Later,
a "new style" appears, and the majority hasten to comnpel
their distorted feet to adapt themselves to a new and rigid
model. In other words, the foot is made to conform to the
shoe, not the shoe to the foot. Fashion and false pride
force the American mother to provide her daughters with
stays or corsets.  Stays or corsets persistently used do not
advance the health and strength of the wearer (26).     Corsets ofteni are the cause of deformity and disease (Fig. 1).
The perfect female foot "should have great breadth and fulness of instep, a wellmarked great toe, a long second toe, a small little toe." Wonian needs a strong and firm
footing particularly because of her function of motherhood. Many ailments peculiar
to women, causing invalidism, misery, and unhappiness, would vanish or be lessened if
proper shoes were worn.
34. WEAK SPINEs.-Girls suffering from "weak spine"
-boys rarely are so affected-may be known by their thin,
pale faces, bowed backs, rounded shoulders, and nonelastic gait. At first it would he well for such sufferers to
wear a pasteboard support which has been moulded to the

back. They should do active housework, cease studying
or practising on the piano at lhome, and perhaps leave
school for a time, shlould employ cold sponging and rubbing, practise exercises on the hlorizontal bar and( the suspended swing-rings, and, later, swimming, followed by
walking and horseback exercise.
35. SOFT BONES.-Infants and young children who live
in dark, damp), and almost sunless rooms, and who are fed
on poor milk (whether mother's or cow's milk), arrow-root,
and white-flour compounds (204 a), developl soft bones.
These bones are often enlarged at the ends. Suchl bones
are easily bent out of shape, even by the action of tlheir own
feeble mnuscles. Children with such bones are said to have
"the rickets." The softening is due to the lack of sufficient
mineral elements in the food.
36. Management.-All infants should have an abundance of healthly mnilk. All children should have enough
of normal milk, milk and cream, milk with lime-water, and
well-cooked oatmneal or wheat flour (decorticated wheat).
All children ought, if possible, to be exposed several hours
daily to the sun. They should sleep in dry, well-aired
rooms. Children with rickets should wear well-adjusted
splints, in order to prevent deformities.
37. SPRAINS of joints are accompanied by greater or less
strains of the ligamrents (Fig. 4, 5, 6), an(l frequently by
tearing of the ligamnents, with injuries to the tendons and
muscles. A sudden and severe striking together of the
bones often induces a bruise. Joint-disease (39) frequently
starts from a slight cartilage-bruise.

What of a bruise?
26DISEASES OF THE FRAMEWORK.
38. Manargement.-In simple sprains, rest on a hair pillow from two to six days will restore a healthy joint in a
robust person.     In case of inflammation, "lock the joint"
by using a well-padded, oil-silk-covered splint or a plaster-of-Paris dressing, and     apply ice constantly.       Splints
compel muscle-rest and joint-rest. Ice checks the setting
of an increased current of blood to the injutred p)art, and
acts against inflammation. Use the ice in an ice-bag or
wrapped in flannel or in a piece of rubber blanket. If ice
cannot be used, irrigate with cold water or with hot water.
Later, employ    hand-rubbing.     Continue   the  splints for
wveeks.
IRRIGATION.-Wrap the parts and the splint in a loose cotton bandage. Place a tub
of cold water on the table. Run fromn the tub to different portions of the part a dozen
or more strands of cotton candle-wicking or yarn. By the action of these strands a constant stream of water will course over the part. Keep up the irrigation without intermission for twenty-four to seventy-two hours. In cold weather, water as hot as can be
borne may be used instead of iced water.
39. JOINT-DISEASE.-Most joint-disease starts in neglected  slight injuries of a     normal joint.      Joint-disease
occurs most frequently in feeble children.        When a robust
child slightly injures a joint, under brief rest the joint fully
recovers.    When a feeble child injures a joint, a brief rest
is not usually   enough.    All injuries to the nmain joints
(hip, knee, ankle, elbow, and shoulder), especially in the
feeble, should be looked upon as serious.
40. If rest is not taken after a sprain (38) or a contusion, the "blood-blister" caused        by the   injury   is not
allowed to heal. By the continued use of the joint the
"blood-blister" is irritated, and an ulcer or sore is formed

within the joint. A little later the smooth cartilage (Fig.
3, ) becomes rough, and erodes, the bones are involved,
the synovial memnbrane (Fig. 2, **) becomes diseased,
anld disorganization of the joint fibllows.  The course of
such a case is painful and tedious. If a disorganized joint
heals, a "stiff joint" may be expected.' 41. Management.-In joint-troubles "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."  In early cases, rest
-prolonged rest and rest aided by splints-is the rule of
action. The splint ought to be so adapted that out-of-door
exercise or movements can be taken.   More persons are
crippledl from ill-cared-for sprains than from fractured bones.
42. DISLOCATION.-A joint is dislocated when the articular surface (the surface in contact) of one bone is displaced from another bone (13).  In dislocations the ligaments are more or less torn, and the ad(joining muscles and
soft parts are usually injured.  The habit of "snapping
the joints" should not be encouraged, as it leads to the
production of lax ligaments.
43. MJlanagement.-A dislocated bonle should be put in
place as soon as possible after the injury. In most cases
it is best to administer ether before attempting the reduction. After the replacing of the part, splints mutst be used,
and sometimes cold applications over the joint. Splints
must be worn for a number of weeks, in order that the ligaments and torn parts may heal; otherwise joint-disease may
follow.

be recognized by inability to use the part, by grating, by
much motion, by deformity, and by complaints of pain. If
the arm be injured, make a sling from a cloth or handkerchief. Support the arm from the elbow to the wrist, tying
the ends of the cloth behind the neck. If the leg or thigh
be hurt, and if the patient is to be moved only a short
distanice, bind the hurt limb carefully to the sound limb
with handkerchiefs. If the sufferer is to be removed far,
carefully remove or cut away the boots and leg garments.
Gently but firmly pull on the parts below the fracture until
the limb reaches its full length- Hold it quietly.
45. The pulling on the parts draws the bone-fragments
from the torn flesh, prevents the sharp, painful muscletwitchings, and affords the sufferer some ease. Let another
person secure somte thin strips of shingle, or laths, or straight
sticks, or tin, or even common straw, cut to the length of
the limb. Place some cloth or grass in the form of even
pads above and below the seat of illjury, then arotlund the
whole adjust the splints which have been made, and secure
them in place by cords or straps above and below the seat
of the break. The limb can now be rested on a rude pillow. An exeellent method of removing the patient is to
carry him on a door or shutter suspended by ropes froin a
stiff pole borne by two men.
46. Preparation of the Bed.-For the treatment of fractures of the lower extremities a hard, smooth surface is
needed. The even mattress should rest on slats rather
than on ropes or wire netting. Place a thick quilt over
the mattress, then a rubber sheet and a cotton sheet. The

coverinigs ought to be light, yet warm. They must nlot
press upon the foot.
47. Care.-When the broken parts have been adjusted
as nearly as possible in position, the surgeon's work is not
done. For several weeks the keeping of the parts in preper
position demands daily professional care.  The surgeoni
should be retained until the parts are again consolidated in
the position found most practicable.  A broken bone can
rarely be made as good in form, shape, position, and usefulness as it was before the injury. The bad results in the
treatment of many fractures are more dependent on the
wilfulness, irritability, and meddling of the patient or his
friends, than on the want of skill on the part of the surgeon.
47a. GOUT AND RHEUMATISM are diseases of the general system whichl manifest themselves chiefly in the joints.
Gout is often produced, or at any rate much aggravated,
by the free use of alcoholic stimulants, such as wine and
malt liquors.  It is a common belief that rich men who
lead idle lives and fare luxuriously are especially liable to
gout; but it is certain that the laboring men of London
(who often drink excessive quantities of porter and ale)
very frequently suffer with this disease, and often die from
its effects. The habitual use of alcoholic stimulants is
known to aggravate the sufferings of rheumatic patients,
and to diminish the chances of recovery. (Richardson.)

48. THE    SKIN   is  the  flexible, elasticcovering   of the
body. It consists of an external portionl, made up of two
principal layers (horny, Fig. 11, a, and soft, or mucous,
Fig. 11, d), with two much thinner layers between,-the
lucid and the granular,-the whole constituting the epidermis; and    of an  internal portion, called    the dermis or
corium    (Fig. 11, e to 1).
48. Describe the skin.
81LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
49. THE EPIDERMIS is made up of layer upon layer of
cells closely pressed together.  It is the protective covering
of the dermis. Its outer surface is constantly being rubbed
off. In a blister the horny layer (Fig. 11, a) is elevated
by a gathering of fluid in the soft layer (Fig. 11, d). In
the soft layer is located the skin pigm-ent.  The nail is a
modified part of the epidermis.
50. THE DERMIS is the true skin. By it is formed the
epidermis. It is abundantly supplied with blood-vessels
and nerves. In it are found lymphattics, smnooth muscles,
hair roots (i), oil glands or sebaceous glands (g), sweat
glands (k), and fat cells, besides thle Pacinian and tactile
corpLuscles (f and j), which are the termini of sensory nervefilaments. (Fig. 11.)
51. THE LYqPHATICS are a part of a system of very
minute tubes. They abound in the skin, and are found in
most parts of the body. They extend primarily to little
roundish bodies called   "glands."   The whole system
centres in two ducts which empty their fluid contents into
the blood-tubes at the base of the neck.
52. THE HAIRS have their seat in pits in the skin (Fig.
11, i), and grow from a nipple-like projection.  By tile
contraction of smooth muscles in the skin the lhairs are
elevated.  Thle function of hairs is protection.  It is
estimated that there are about one hundred and twenty
thousand on a normal scalp.

glands. - The oil lubricates the hair, keeps the skin supple,
and protects the epidermis.
54. A SWEAT GLAND (Fig. 11, k) consists of a convoluted tube seated deep in the dermnis. The outer part is
spiral, to prevent blocking up of the tube. The sweat, or
perspiration, during its change to vapor on the surface of
the skin cools the body. The sweat glands remove water
and wastes fromn the blood (263).
55. REGULATIONS OF TEMPERATURE.-The heat of the
body is mostly produced by chemical changes taking place
in the muscles and the internal organs. The body is kept
at a normnal temperature (98.6~ F.; 370 C.) in all climates
by the varying evaporations from the skin and the airpassages (106).
56. In the summer the skin is turgid with blood, the
sweat glands work actively, and large amounts of water
appear on the surface of the skin. Heat is abstracted from
the warm body, the water is changed to vapor, the blood
in the skin-vessels is cooled, and later the whole body is
cooled.
57. In the winter more blood is retained in the heat-pro(lucing parts, less blood is sent to the skin, less perspiration
app)ears, less evaporation occurs, and thlus the heat-loss is
diminished. The flow of the blood largely to the internal
organs, or largely to the skin, is regulated by a medulla
centre (283) in accordance with the needs of the system.

ried an active fever-condition (103~ to 110~ F.). It occurs
by night as well as by day. Treatment.-Apply cold water
and ice to the head. Give ice by the mouth and rectum;
or cold baths. Alcoholics are hurtful. Prevention.-Wear
loose-fitting garments. Take plenty of drink, cold water,
warm  coffee, warm  tea, but no alcoholics.  Secure free
ventilation. Lessen the daily exertions. Be moderate in
your movements.
59. ABSORPTION.-The skin, under suitable circumstances, will absorb water.  It is doubtful whether the
sound skin can absorb substances ill solution in water.
Under friction, mercury, lead, and arsenic mlay enter the
systemin. When the surface of' the skin or the mucous membrane is punctured or abraded, poisons (like lead, arsenic; the
poison of farcy, pustule, vaccinia, etc.) can readily reach the
lymphatics, work on to the blood, and later affect the whole
system. Certain animal poisons (contagia, 126) lying for
a few minutes or hours in contact with a healthy, sound
mucous membrane have been known to enter the system.
60. Precaution.-Before handling poisons, decaying
meat, bones having shreds of decaying flesh, dead bodies,
etc., examine the hands and forearms carefully. AppIly
plaster or collodion to denuded spots. Then smear the
hands and forearms with oil or fat. If you are cut by a
poisoned knife, allow the part to bleed freely.  If the
mouth is sound, suck the wound. Later, wash out the
mouth.
61. CLEANLINESS.-The skin should be kept clean.
To remove dirt from the skin nothing is superior to warm

mucous surfaces. 60. How prevent absorption? What of poisonwounds? 61. How may cleanliness be secured? Effect of skincleaning? What of nurses?
34water, good soap, and friction. For the body-health cold
bathing and brisk friction hold the first rank. The effect
of skin-cleaning is to improve the nutrition of the skin, to
render its color and texture better, to increase the action
of the sweat and( oil glands, to prevent disease of the skin,
and to advance the general health.      A clean skin relieves
the air-passages and tile kidneys (265) of extra work. The
attendants of the sick should always wash their hands
before handling food or eating.
62. SOAP.-Good soap only should be used.            Inferior
soaps injure the color and texture of the skin. Only such
amount should be used as has been found necessary to keep
the skin clean. An excess of soap dissolves and removes
thle oily secretion too rapidly, and, as a result, the epidermis is not properly protected, and its surface becomes red,
rough, and chapped.
Castile soCap is a typical good soap. It is neutral, lut strong enough for general
bathing and washing purposes. Soft soaps contain an excess of alkali. They may be
useful for removing scales, crusts, and foreign matte s from the skin, but after their use
an oily application should be made. Medicated soaps (tar, sulphur, etc.) are often serviceable in the milder formns of skiin-disease.
63. BATHING iS indispensable to sound health as well
as to cleanliness.  "Daily l)athing, from childbirth to old
age, should be the rule." (Bowditch.) Bathing imparts
tone and vigor to the internal organs.       Cold baths and
cold washes are the gymnastics of the skin (52), and of
intestinal and blood-vessel muscles.      In the robust, cold
bathiing is followed by a "reaction."
64. By reaction the skin becomes glowing, the internal
organs are relieved, respiration is made fuller and easier,

tern is improved, the appetite is sharpened, the mind
works with greater strengthl and clearness, and the whole
system  gains in power.     Regularity in bathing is necessary
to produce permanent good effects.
65. MODE     OF  BATHING.-The        simplest   modes   of
bathing are by means of the sponge and the shallow bath.
Under either of these modes the body should be quickly
washed, dried, and well rubbed.     The cold bath should be
taken only in the early part of' the day. As a rule, it
should alwvays be followed-by mnuscular exercise.      The cold
bath, in general, ought not to exceed five minutes in length.
TEMIPERATURE.-Vapor and hot water baths, above 97~ F. (36~ C.), are stimulant.
The warm bath, 97~ to 85~ F. (36~ to 29.5~ C.), is soothing. The.infant's bath should commence at 99~ F. and be gradually reduced. Tbe tepid bath, 75~ to 85~ F. (24~ to 29.5~ C.),
is useful for cleanliness and to keep the sweat pores (Fig. 11, k) open. The temperate
bath, 65~ to 75~ F. (18~ to 24~ C.), is well adapted to the healthy. The cold bath, 32~ to
65~ F. (0~ to 18~ C.), is a stimulant, a tonic, and later a sedative. It is adapted only to
the robust who have excellent lungs.
66. Precautions.-The     face and   head   should  be wet
in cold water before the bath.     Cool baths must not be
taken when the body is chilly, perspiring, or greatly
fatigued.  Common baths ought to be taken briskly (64).
Excepting the warm evening bath, exercise should always
follow  bathing.   When     "reaction"  does not promptly
follow a cold bathl or a sea-bath, the bath is injurious.
67. SEA-BATHING increases tissue-changes, and also increases the amount of the excreta.    It improves the appetite and aids digestion; it quickens the circulation and

fants, elderly persons, or those suffering from well-seated
disease of the kid(neys, liver, heart, or lungs.
68. PREVENTION OF DROWNING.-The buoyant power
of water is great. Onle or both hands placed on a block,
or stool, or chair will suffice to keep the mouth and nose
out of water. This, in many cases, is all that is absolutely
necessary. If you are in danger of drowninig, do not attempt to raise your body out of water. Keep your nose
and mouthl out of water, and endeavor, by movements of
the legs, to work your way shorewar(ld.
69. MANAGEMENT OF A DROWNING CASE.-Treat the
patient on the spot. Raise the person by the limbs, in
order to allow the water to run out. Remove all closefitting garments froni the neck and chlest. Wipe the froth
from mnoutlh and nostrils. Keep the people fromi crowding
around.  If natural respiration has ceased, emtploy the
"Silvester method" at once.
70. SILVESTER METHOD.-(1) Lay the body on the
back. Slightly elevate the feet and limbs. Put a block
under the shoulders. Puill the head well back. Draw
anld hold the tongue well out. Place yourself at the head.
Seize the arms above thle elbow. Draw themn upwards until
they meet above the head, then move them back to the
side and press with both lhands on the lower part of the
breast-bone. Repeat this movement deliberately fourteen
times per minute. Persevere for half an hour.
(2) Dash cold water or water of 120~ F. temperature on
the naked chest. As soon as the natural mnovements of
the breathing recommence, cease the Silvester movements.
(3) Maintain the temperature of the body by friction,
hiot bottles, and warm blankets. Keep the head in a current of fresh air.

(4) As soon as the patient call swallow, give warm
mrilk, tea, or coffee containing a little amimonia (spirits of
hlartshorn).  Put the patient in a warm bedcl.  Pack hotwater bottles about him.   Encourage sleep.   Keep the
windows open.
71. COSMETICS often contain lead, bismuth, mercury, and
other dangerous and injurious ingredients.  They clog the
sweat-gland pores, and injure the texture, softness, and
health of the skin.  Superfluous facial hairs are best removed by passing an electric current through each hairroot.  Hair- and whisker-dyes not only disfigure a person,
but very often cause systemic poisoning (lead paralysis).
72. BuRNS.--When the burni is small, apply cold water
continuously until the smarting ceases.  If the burn is
severe, prick the blisters. Do not pull off the epidermis.
Apply wet clothes. Keep them wet with'a strong solution
of cooking soda. If soda is not at hand, use strong soapsuds.  Do not remove the first dressing until smarting has
ceased.  If the burn is severe, let the dressings remain
until pus-formation loosens thiem. In very bad, extensive
burns, put the patient in a warm bath. Give hot milk
and a little ammonia.  Later, zinc ointment or carbolized
sweet oil or cotton-seed oil makes a good dressing.
73. CLOTHING.- The object of clothIling is to protect
against cold and against heat.  In cold climates clothing
is an equivalent of a certain amount of fatty food, and
is essential.  In hot climates the head must be protected
against direct sun-heat, and the abdomen, at night, by the
cotton "kummerbund" or the flannel waist-belt (104).

hairs? Of hair-dyes? 72. Treatment of a small burn? of a moderate burn? of the dressings? of a large burn? 73. What is the object
of clothing? In cold climates? In hot climiates?
3874. Clothing does not warm the body (55). It retards
the outward passage of the body-lheat.  Flannel or merino
absorbs the excessive perspiration.  Clothing also protects
against external agents, like furnace-heat, blowing sand,
hail, and winds.
(a) "Protection against cold.-For equal thicknesses,
wool is much superior to either cotton or linen, and should
l)e worn for all underclothing. In case of' extreme cold,
besides wool, leather or water-proof clothing is useful.
Cotton and linen are nearly equal."
(b) "Protection against heat.-Texture has nothing to do
with protecting fromtn the direct solar rays: this depends
entirely on color.  White is the best color, then gray,
yellow, pink, blue, and black.  In the shlade the effect of
color is not marked. The thickness and the conducting
power of the material are the conditions which influence
lieat."
(c) "Protection against cold winds.-For equal thickiiess, leather and india-rubber take the first rank; wool,
the second; cotton antd linen, third, and about equal."
(d) "Absorption of perspiration.-Wool hlas more than
double the absorbing power of cottonI and linen." (Parkes.)
75. The clothing should be loose-fitting.-In warm weather,
thlin, loose, and porous garments favor the outward passage of heat and the removal of the skin's moisture. In
cold weather, dry, well-meshed materials, like woollens,
merinos, and filrs, made into loose garments, keep several
layers of poorly-coinducting air between the warm body
and the cold air.  Tight-fitting garments do not permit
of the non-conducting air-layers; besides, they interfere,
by pressure, with free blood-circulation (105). When going
oult, put on your overcoat in the warm room five minutes
before you are ready to leave the room.

THE SKIN.LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
76. Water-proof clothing, and water-proof boots or shoes,
should be worn only to keep out external wet, and only
during the time of exposure. As they retain the bodymoisture, they are highly injurious if worn continuously
for a length of time. When water-proof clothing mrust
be so worn, however, wool next to the skin mitigates the
evil effects.
77. Night-clothing should be thicker than that worn
during the day. Tlle night is colder than the day. The
loss of heat from the body is greater during the night than
during the day. A woo] or hair mattress, light, fleecy wool
blankets, and clean sheets (in the winter warmed with the
old-fashioned "warmning-pan") mnake a healthy, sleep-inducing bed(l. All bedding should be exposed to currents
of air and to direct sunlight several hours daily. The
Italian method of not "making up the bed" until late in
the day is wortl-hy of imitation.
78. The clothing must be clean.-All clothling should be
frequently chlanged, often exposed to sunlight, daily shaken,
and well washed at frequenet intervals. Under-garments
should be changed twice daily; i.e., there slhould be a day
set an(l a night set. The attendants of the sick should
wear light-colored, washable garments.
79. Damp clothing is dangeroutts.-All articles from the
laundry shoutld be aired and sunned or warmed before
being put on.   In the unaired, unwarmed "spare bed"

on dry garments. Cold, damp feet are the starting-points
of many an illness-.
80. In the northern and central zones of the United
States, merino, the admixture of cotton varying with the
locality and the season, is the safest material for undergarments at all times.  A change from thick to thinner
garments shoutl(l be made in the morning, when the system is
buoyant.  The system of "hardening" children by giving
them  insufficient clothing is non-hygienic and inhutman.
Persons who suffer fromrn headache, neuralgia, dyspepsia,
etc., need more clothing than healthy persons under the
samne conditions. Persons in active employments need less
clothing than those engaged in sedentary pursuits.
81. SHoEs.-Well-tanned, good skins make the best and
warmest of foot-protectives.  In cold weather shoes should
be of an "easy fit."  The "easy fit" permits a layer of
warm  air to surround the foot, the dry leather permnits a
limited amount of the persp)iration to escape, an(l the good
leather well protects the foot.
81a. Skin-diseases may result from lack of cleanliness,
but are oftener traceable to an improper diet, or to the effects
of kidney- or liver-disease, or to some taint of the blood.
Alcoholic drinks cause the skin of the face to become red
and congested.  This effect is produced through the relaxation and enlargement of the blood-vessels of the skin.
In many cases the alcohol habit greatly aggravates skin( isease.

THE HEART AND BLOOD-TUBES.
82. THE THORAX is a cage-work of bones filled in with
muscles and soft parts (Fig. 1).  It is limited below by
the diaphragm (Fig. 12), and by thle soft parts of the neck
above. Its shape is conical, and its capacity is variable. It
contains and protects the heart and lungs (Fig. 21), the
great blood-tubes (Fig. 12), the oesophagus, and the thoracic
duct (Fig. 21, 13, 24)
83. THE HEART is the great central engine-pump.    It
is a hollow, muscular organ. The contractions of the heart
are due to nerve-centre action ill the heart itself.  It is
provided( with valves to guide the blood-current. It forces
the blood to the lungs and to all parts of the body. Blood
from the lungs and all parts of the body comes back to it.
84. BLOOD-TUBEs.-The blood forced from the heart is
conducted to all parts of the body by tubes called arteries.
These tubes terminate in a net-work of minute tubes, the
capillaries, in every tissue of the body. The blood issuing
from the capillaries returns to the heart in tubes called
veins. The arteries have circular muscular fibres, the contraction of which lessens their diameters.  The calibre of
the arteries is controlled by a nerve-mechanism (283).
85. THE BLOOD in the living body is a fluid varying in
color from  brownish-red to a bright red. It consists of a

pale, yellowish fluid, the plasma, in which float a large number of disks, called corpuscles. The blood( contains in suitable form for tissue-use all the chemical elemnents found in
the body (10).
86. THE FUNCTION of the red corpuscles is to convey
oxygen to all parts of the body. The plasma of the blood
contains the tissue-food and the tissue-wastes.
87. CAPILLARY INTERCHANGES.-The blood-stream inl
the capillaries (84) is regular, equable, and slow. It is
during this portion of its rounds that the blood gives to
each tissue such needed substances as it is able to withdraw
and receives from each tissue that which the tissue gives
up.  Blood coming from the capillary areas is darker in
color and richer in wastes, but poorer in oxygen, than
arterial blood.
88. BLEEDING, or HEMORRHAGE.-There is no soft part
of the body which, when cut, will not afford blood.  If
the issuing blood is bright red in color and comrnes forth in
jets, it is arterial; if in a darker, constant flow, venous; and
if it oozes out in many points, capillary (84). As a rule,
arterial blood escapes from the heart-side of a wound,
venous blood from the sid(le farthest from the heart, and
capillary blood from both sides. Crushed and torn bloodtubes rarely leak much blood.
89. MANAGEMENT OF BLEEDING.-When a part is cut
and small jets as well as a steady flow of blood appear,
raise the part, if possib)le, and apply a dry cloth with firm
pressure.  In a few mninutes remove the cloth, wash the

down in a cool, quiet room. Place bottles holding hot
water around his limbs. Give him water when he desires.
A little hot water and ammbnia often does good. If a
surgeon cannot be had, slightly pull out the gaping artery
or vein with a fish-hook fastened to a pen-holder, or with
a pair of small toothled forceps. Pass around the tube between the hook and the flesh a silk or linen thread, and tie
it with a "reef-knot."  Do not cut off the threads, but
allow the ends, knlotted together, to hang out of the wound.
Treat each of the arteries in the same manner. Slacken
the tourniquet.  If jetting points appear, secure them.
Finally, loosen the tourniquet, but leave it on thle limb
so as to be ready should the main ligature not hold.

FIG. 16. MANNER OF APPLYING ADHESIVE STRIPS TO WOUNDS.
93. DRESSING OF THE WOUIND.-After the bleeding
has ceased, wash the wound with a stream of tepid water
squeezed from a sponge or forced from a syringe-nozzle.
Then carefully draw the several parts together. If the cut
is smiall, retain the parts with strips of adhesive plaster not
more than three-eighths of an inch wide (Fig. 16). Apply
over this two or four folds of soft cloth. Secure all in place
by a stitched or well-pinned cloth. In severe wounds it may
be necessary to insert several stitches and to prop up the

flaps with pads of cottoni or of cloth. In ragged wounds the
stitches can rarely be expected to hold or to do much good.
94. In dressing severe wounds, the position of the wolund
must be considered. If the wound be on the front of the
arm, flex the forearm; if on the back, extend the forearmn
(Fig. 17); if on the front of the leg, extend the leg and

bend up the ankle; if on the back part, reverse the position, etc. Splints may be used to keep the parts at rest,
prevent joint-motion, and control muscular action (38).
95. RE-DRESSING OF WOUNDS.-Meddle with a wound
as little as possible.   When the dressing becomes foul and
a bloody discharge quite evident, soften and remove the
cloths with  a streamn of warm    water.   In  removing the
plasters, both ends should be raised, and, one at a tinle,
stripped towards the wound. If plasters are to be retained, remove and replace alternate strips. Do not use
"healing" salves or ointments.       Nature does the healing.
Ointments and oils serve to keep the dressing from sticking

to tender surfaces. If the wound is fetid, alcohol 1 to 15
of water may be used as a dressing-wash.
96. INTERNAL BLEEDING.-In many cases of bleeding
of internal organs, the hot-water douche (115~ to 160~ F.)
is most efficacious; when from the lungs, quietness of the
patient must be maintained. Cause the patient to chew
ice. In bleeding from the nostrils, sit up. Do not bend
forward. Elevate the arms above the head. Breatihe
through the mouth. Apply ice to the sides of the nose,
to the middle of the forehead, and to the nape of the neck.
In bleeding following teeth-extraction, fill the hole in the
jaw with plaster-of-Paris paste. In stomach-bleeding accompanied by vomiting, rest on the back and swallow bits
of ice. In bleeding from the bowels, suck ice, and apply
ice wrapped in flannel to the abdomen.
97. PUNCTURED WOUNDS, as from the teeth of animals,
old nails, thorns, etc., are often dangerous, for they cannot
be cleansed to the bottom.  Wash the parts about the
wound. Apply a bread or linseed-meal poultice. Change
this every four or six hours. The poultice favors pusformation, prevents surface-healing, and cleanses the
wound.
98. MAD-DoG WoUNDs.-Cauterize at once with lunar
caustic (nitrate of silver), or pour into the wound strong
acid or alkali. Do not dose the person who is bitten.

99. POISON-SERPENT WOUNDS.-Tie at once a cord or
band very tightly around the part between the wound and
the heart. Cutt near the wountd, to favor bleeding. If your
mnouth is sound (59), suck the wound; if not, apply a live
coal to the bite. Subcutaneous injectionis of ammonia are
recomnmended.   Give ordinary alcohol in tablespoonful
doses, or its equivalent, in a litdtle hot water.  Add to
each dose one grain of quinia and five to ten drops of
water of amrmonia. Repeat every ten minutes. Continue
as long as heart-sustaining effbects are produced.  With a
bettering of the condition, gradually increase the intervals
of administration. From a pint to a quart of alcohol may
be needed (322).
100. HEART-STRAIN.- A frequent cause of hearttroubles is unduly violent efforts.  Soldiers in forced
mnarches, oarsmen in hotly-contested races, and gymnasts
in vaulting-matlches too often exceed their powers. They
falter, hesitate, and give up to the sudden heart-weakness
and prostration.  If they survive, they very often drag
along for years a less efficient life than before their exertion, and finally succumb to somne chest-disease.
101. ATHEROAIA.-From strain of the heart, from gout
and rheumatism, from the abuse of alcohol, and on the
approachl of old age, the coats of the large arteries undergo
a change. In some cases the arterial tube-walls become
fatty in their nature, and( hence are easily ruptured. In
other cases lime-salts are deposited in the elastic tissues,
and the tubes become hard, rigid, and brittle. The latter,
under a very sudden severe exertion, may crack open.

50THE HEART AND BLOOD-TUBES.
Rupture of an artery in the head induces apoplexy; rupture
of the aorta, sudden death. Hence elderly persons and persons long diseased should make no sudden severe exertions.
102. FAINTING.-In order to work properly, the heart
must be supplied with enough good blood. Fainting is
due (1) to failure of the heart's action, (2) to lackl of blood
in the brain-centres and (3) to failure of lung-action. A
common cause is the constant sending of an impure blood
to the heart-wvalls. Managernent.-Put the person in a
horizontal positionI. Loosen the clothing about the thorax
and neck. Cut the stay-strings. Keep personsfrom crowding around the patient. Dash cold water on the face.
Apply amnmonia to the nostrils. Rub the limbs, and rub
over the heart-region.  Mustard paste over the heart is
often beneficial. Elevate the limbs. In very bad cases,
raise the patient by the limbs until he rests on the head.
On revival, give aromatic spirits of ammonia, or coffee.
Keep the patient quiet for some hlours in a warmed bed.
103. CLOTHING.-A normal and equable temnperature
of the body must be maintained (55). When the skin or
the air-passage surfaces (106) are chilled, the calibre of the
blood-tubes in these parts becomnes reduced, less blood flows
to these parts, and more than a normal amount of blood is
forced upon the internal organs. The latter become overfull (conigestion). If the over-fulness is in the intestinal
region, a shlarp diarrhoea may follow; if in the lungs, oppressiou of the chest-organs, followed by a profuse nasal
and air-passage discharge.

ings and nights a broad flannel waist-belt should always
be worn. Native East-Indians and Anglo-Ind(lians never
neglect to wear the waist-belt at night during the cholera
season (73).
105. The clothing should be loosely adjusted.  Compression, or pressure of any kind upon the soft parts, impedes free blood- miovements. Upon infants and children
all bands should be elastic, and never of a close fit (23).
Heart-disease is very much more frequent among soldiers
than among policemnen. The reason assigned for this is
that the soldier's mnovements-chest and abdominal-are
much hampered by the close-fitting uniform.,(f 105a. ALCOHOLIC DRINKS, when first taken, quicken
the heart-beats and strengthen the blood-current, but this
stimulation is followed by an inevitable and most unpleasant depression. Habitual drinkers almost invariably
(according to Dr. B. W. Richardson) suffer from degeneration of the heart-tissues and of the coats of the blood-vessels.
The blood itself is greatly injured by the use of alcohol;
and there are many diseases which may take their origin
from the blood-changes induced by its use. The principal
cause of fatty degeneration of the heart is the excessive use
of alcoholic beverages. (Richardson.) The free use of
tobacco affects the heart-beat in a marked degree. Tobaccousers frequently suffer from irregular and enfeebled action
of the heart. The disease is at first functional only; but
there is reason to believe that it may impede the bloodcurrent in such a way as to distort and deforrnm the valves
of the heart, and thus cause incurable organic disease.

passing the vertical epiglottis (Fig. 18, e), it enters the
cartilaginous passage, the larynx (Fig. 18, 1), and the manyringed tube, the trachea (Fig. 19, 4). It next reaches the
many-branching   tubes, the  btonchiae (Fig. 19, 5,6,78),
which finally terminate in a multitude of little, thin-walled
air-sacs (Fig. 19, 9 9).  The entire systenm  of passages,

tubes, and sacs is lined with
a membrane called mucous
membrane. The surface of
this mnlembrane is bathled with
moisture called mucus. The
mucus is secreted by the cells
of the membrane or glands
in the membrane.
107. THE LUNGS are two
in numnber. They occupy the
right and left divisions of the
thorax (Fig. 21, 3 4). They
consist of a pinkish-colored,
spongy mass, made up of airtubes, air-sacs, blood-vessels,

and nerves bound together by webs of connective tissue.
108. INSPIRATION.-By the elevation of the front ends
of the ribs and the sternum and the flattening of the arched
diaphragm  (Fig. 21, 15) the capacity of the thorax is
increased. By this enlargement the pressure of the air
within the lung air-passage is lessened. The outer air now
rushes into the mouith or nostrils and enters the air-passages. Thus new air is introduced into the small tubes.
109. EXPIRATION.-By the muscular act of inispiration
107. Describe the lungs. 108. How is the capacity of the thorax

What occurs?THE AIR-PASSAGES.
the elastic tissues of thie lungs and chest-walls have been
put on the stretch.  When the muscles cease their contraction in ordinary breathing, the elastic fibres react and diminish the capacity of the lung-tubes. Thus about thirty
cubic inches (500 c.c.) of air are forced out.
110O.1BREATHING is an involuntary act. The regularity
of its movements is controlled by a "centre" in the medulla
oblongata (283). Thie new air introduced contains more
oxygen and less carbonic acid than the air in the small
passages. By natural gas-mixing, the new air gives some
of its oxygen to the old, and receives from it somle of its
carbonic acid.  This recently-mixed air is expelled by expiration. Thus oxygen, a food, is introduced, and carbonic
acid, a waste product, is removed.
111. THE EXPIRED AIR is warmner, contains more moisture and more carbonic acid (about 4 per cent.), and has less
oxygen than the inspired air. The expired air also contains several impurities, most of which have a bad odor,
and many of which undergo quick decay.
112. CONDITIONS  FOR HEALTH.-For proper action
each organ and tissue of the body must be supplied with
normal blood (85). In order that the moving blood may
continue normal, it must be supplied withl oxygen gas. In
order to supply the needed oxygen, the lungs must be in
good workinlg condition, must not be impeded in their
action, and must be supplied with normal air. Furthermnore, certain waste materials in the blood must reach the
air-cell capillaries in order to be cast out of the system
(111). When these wastes are cast out of the blood, they

55LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
must be rapidly removed from the air-passages, and later
from the vicinity of the nostrils.
113. IMPEDIMENTS TO NORMAL BREATHING.-By the
presence in thie blood and tissues of certain agents, like
morphia, aconite, alcohlol, the normal gas-interchange is
hindered and the respiration diminished. The respiratory
movements are hampered by improperly:fitting garments,
by tight waistcoats and close-fitting shirts, by corsets and
stays, by chest and abdominal bands and straps, by an
over-distended abdomen following gluttony, and by variouts disease-processes involving the thoracic, abdominal, or
cerebral organs.
114. NORMAL AIR is a mixture of about twenty-one
volumes of oxygen and seventy-nIine of nitrogen gas,
together with small amounts of carbonic acid, vapor of
water, and traces of living or dead organic matters. Normal air is clear, has no odor, and contains an agreeable
amount of moisture (60 to 70 per cent. of saturation). It
induces no sensation of "closeness," and readily supports
combustion. "Air at 32~ F. contains about 10 per cent.
more of oxygeni than air at 80~." (Mayer.)
115. AIR-IMPURITIES.-A large number of substances
are continuously entering the air about us. Among them
may be mentioned once-breathed air of man or animals,
the carbon cornpounds from fires and lamps, the various
matters coming from decaying flesh and vegetables, and
dust of all kinds. The most dangerous of the impurities
are the first and third kinds.
116. DETECTION OF IMPURITIES.-Most organic matters,

whietlher resulting from       respiration, (lecay, or disease, have
peculiar, and often penetrating, odors. The trainled nose
can readily detect them        when it is first brought in contact
with them, but later loses its power of recognizing them.
Various other impurities are detected by sight, or by
microscopical and chemical means.
117. ACTION OF IMPURITIES.-IImpurity of breathingair is the most fertile cauLse of death among those conmmonly in action. Tile effects of breathing an impure air
do not usually appear suddenly. The continued use of a
bad air underminies the health, increases the number of
sick days per year, and renders diseases of parts other
than the respiratory more severe. The death-rate of infants
and children is largely increased by air-impurity (120).
(a) In 1880 there were 35,292 deaths in a population of 1,783,085 in Massachusetts. According to English Aid Society tables, there are two constantly sick for every death,-i.e.,
there are seven hundred and thirty days' complete disability for every death occulrring.
The English lables do not take into account the trivial illnesses-colds, headachles, slight
rheumatism, slight injuries, etc.-which suspend the power to labor for less periods than
a week.
(b) In Massachusetts, in 1880, consenptione easily led the list in order of fatality, and
1leqg fever followed second. From the fifteenthl to the twentieth year, consumption
caused nearly one-half of all the deaths; from txo enty to thirty, more than one-half; and
in the next four decades, although first in order, it was not so prominent. "But not
only phthisis (consumption) may reasonal)ly be considered to have one of its niodes of
origin in the breathing an atmosphere contaminated by respiration, but other lung-diseases, bronchitis and pneumonia (lung-feve ), appear also to be more common under such
circumstances." (Pc-kes )
118. INJURIOUS SOLIDS IN THE AIR.-Dusts are present
in the air, but in a variable amount.         In workshops and
mines they are often very abundant, in ordinary roomts to
a moderate    amount, and    at certain seasons of the     year in
the outer air (sand, clay dutsts, pollen     of plants).    When
such  materials enter the air-passages, they induce dryness
117. What is induced by impure air?    What results?   118. Mention injurious solids.   What is induced?      What may occur?
57LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
and irritation. If they gain lodgmient there, the irritation
may lead to an increased secretion of mucus, to coughing,
and to a catarrhal condition. If the particles remain long
in contact, especially if they have sharp corners, like iron,
steel, coal, pottery and other dusts, the mucous discharge
becomes fetid, evidences of lung-cavities appear, bleeding
may occur, and consumption renders labor impossible.
119. INHABITED RooM AIR IMPURITIES in the main
consist of the carbonic acid from the air-passages and skiin,
the carbon compounds from    the lamps and imperfect
heating apparatuses, the vapor of water, the foul-smelling
compoun(ls fromn the body and its passages (115), and
sometimes tainted air from kitchen, cellar, and water-closet.
120. INFLUENCE OF INHABITED       ROOM   AIR.-The
common effects of breathing a vitiated room air are a sense
of heaviness, headache, weariness, inertness, and, in some
cases, nausea. When the air is moderately impure, when the
inmates of the room occupy chairs or benches for hours at
a time (sewing-rooms, work-rooms, school-rooms, railwaycars), when the ventilation is so defective that portions of
the air are breathed over and over again, when this is continued day after (lay, such inmates tend to become pale,
to lose partly their appetite, and later to experience a failing in muscular strength and in mental acuteness (117).
If such inmates lodge in ordinary tenement- or boarding-house sleeping-rooms, the bad influence is intensified.
But few work-rooms and factories are properly heated,
and the majority have no means of ventilation except the
window. The open window in a workshop is a source of

59
danger.     Of the     special diseases following such coInditions
of existence, the lung-diseases are most commlon (consumnption  and foul-air pneumonia).
(a) SPECIFIC INFLUENCE OF IMIPURIIIES.-A large amount of carbonic acid in the air
causes the lamps to burn dimn and the people in the room to become drowsy and dull.
The carbonic oxide and other carbon compounds irritate the air-passages and work mischief in the blood  The catboniiic oxiclde replaces the oxygen in tile blood-corpuscles,
is very slowly eliminated, and is a very fatal poison. The vcapor of cwater tends to saturate the air and tilus to hinder the action of the skin (65). Ihe organic gaseous emanatiois ar-e the nmost dangerous of the imlpurities. At, ne time they convey disease (cholera,
typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtlheria, etc.), at anothier timne give lorth odors having
a depressing effect on the system, and at all tinmes woilrk nischief.
(b) Carbonic acid is comnmonly measured in examiined airs, not because of the badcl action
of the carbonic acid itself, but on account of its ease of determiniation, and the fact that
the increase of carbonic acid in an air is a very gtod index of the increase of the other
more dangerous inmpurities. The Parlies standard is, that air contaiicing more thanl six
parts of carbonic acid per ten thlousand is unfit to breathe, and that withl a ratio of eight,
nine, or ten parts per ten thousand the air smells stuffy anld close, and beyond this becomes foul and offensive.
(c) The experimnents of PVrof. Reinsen shlow that carbonic oxide will pass through heated
plates of wrought iron as well as of cast iron. The presence of carbonic oxide in furnace-air is one of the drawbacks to that method of heatin-g.
121. SEWER-GAS OR CEssPOoL-GAS.-When human
exereta, the   waste   water    from   the   kitchen   and   the  bath
and wash-room, anld other household wastes are allowed to
accumulate     in pipes, or closed      tubl)s, or open   tanks, they
undergo decay.       During    the warm    (lays of spring and the
hot days    of suniniier the    decay is    hastened.     The   decayprocess causes the formation       of large    amounts    of "sewergas."    These gases-for       "sewer-gas" is made ul) of many
kinds of gases-are very light, and are characterized by
their bad odors.
122. MOVEMENTS OF SEWER-GAS.--TIf the pipes, tanks,
or cesspools are open, the gases rise into and pollute the adjacent air, and may thus enter the open windows of a room.
If the cesspool and pipes are tight but become blocked               or
121. From what does sewer-gas form? What of the gas? 122. How
may sewer-gas gain entrance? What facilitates the entrance?LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
closed, the gas forces itself along, rises in the pipes, and
enters the house.  The higher up and( the warmer the
room, the more rapidly does the gas enter it. In general,
the gas enters by the sink, the bath-waste, the soil, and(
the fixed basin pipes. As yet, human intelligence has not
succeeded in controlling the miovemenits of sewer-gas.
123. EFFECT OF SEWER-GAS.-Thle influence is mnost
marked on children, especially when the gas enters the
sleeping-room. The children become pale and are laiiguid
in their mnovemenets. They lose their appetite.  They
suffer quite frequently from diarrhcea.  The young, middle-aged, and elderly suffer from headachle, mialaise, feverishlness, and even diarrhoeas.  They become pale and
waxy-looking. Their nostrils and lips appear bloodless.
In some cases they are troubled( by fevers lasting three to
five d(lays, by loss of appetite, and by nausea.
124. It is quite certain that many cases of diarrhoea,
diphtheria, and typhoid fever are directly due to sewer-gas.
Sewver-gas always aggravates the severity of all diseases.
As a rutle, "modern imnprovements" are a constant source
of peril to health. The waste-basins of the sleeping-rooms
or adjacent closets ought not to connect with the sewerpipes (150, b). The "soil-pipe" should always extend and
open above the roof. The best-trapped sewers cannot be
relied( upon.
125. A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE is a disease which can be
transmitted from one animal to another, as fronm men to men
(smallpox), or from dog or horse to man (rabies, pustule).
The agent by which it is so conveyed is called contagium.

126. In some cases the agett enters by an abrasion in the
skiln or mucous membrane (poison wound), in others by
direct contact, especially throughl the mucous membrane
(specific eye-disease); in others it enters the atmosphere and
is inhaled, or swallowed, or absorbed (phthisis, scarlet fever,
diphtheria, malaria), in others it is carried in clothing, bed(ling, etc. (smallpox), and in others it enters in drinkingwater (cholera, typhoid fever), and in food (trichinge).
127. PREVENTION OF ATMOSPHERIC CONTAGIUM INFLUENCE.-Be clean,-clean in your person, in your clothinlg, in your roomt, in your house and about your house.
Keep) the windows shut, and you keep in the gertms; open
them, and they pass out with the changing air.  A clean,
dry air is unfavorable for the activity of contagia and their
increase. Hence the importance of free ventilation. All
fever and contagions cases should be treated in large, airy
rooms having an open fire, or in tents.
128. MANAGEMENT DURING EPIDEMICS. Measures of
cleanlinless taken beforehand are of far more importance
for the protection of.a district thlan the removal and disinfection of garbage after a disease has actually made its
appearance.  " No excesses of any sort, and especially no
excess of prudence," is a good rutle of action during an
epi(lemic. - Keep cool. Wear a " waist-belt" (73). Do
not radically change your (liet, for your stomach will
probably rebel.  Keep yourself, your house, and your sutrroundings clean. Use boiled water for drinking-purposes.
An odlor of carbolic acid or of sulphlur fumes is of little
use.  Filth and   house-refuse must be removed daily.
Ventilate the house-drains and waste-pipes.

61LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
129. AIR-PURIFIERS. -Dried earth, quicklime, and
powdered wood charcoal (the latter is most efficient) may
be used in the sick-room to absorb foul gases. Gases and
vapors, like  chlorine, nitrous acid, sulphur fulmes, and
carbolic acid vapor, are more active than the solid purifiers.  Neither class can fill the place of the freest ventilation: they only supplement it by removing the stronger
odors, and to a limited extent, in occupied rooms, prevent
the growth of low organisms.
PURJFYING AGENTS.-Where the room is vacated and all openings closed, and where
vapors are set free in large amounts and thus penetrate to every nook and corner, they
do great good. Thus, cloerine, from chloride of limie moistened, or from a heated mixture
containing conmmon salt (4 parts), water (2), binoxide of manganese (2), and sulphuric acid
(2); or sulphur jftnes, by burning sulphur in many basins; or carbolic acid, by being
set free from cloths soaked with dilute solutions.
130. MARSH     MIAsM.-The agent is an emanation from
soils more or less rich in organic mnatter.    It arises more
pommonly from     soils not devoted to the growth of useful
vegetation. It appears only where vegetable decay is going
on at a certain temperature (rarely below 60~ F.) and with
a certain degree of moisture. At present the agent is held
to be an organism   (bacilltts).  It enters the system chiefly
through the air-passage membranes. It may enter in the
drinking-water (228) or by the skin.      It gives rise to a
train of diseases known as malarica (fever, neuralgia, spleenenlargemient, diarrhoea).
131. PREVENTION OF MALARIA.-The great reduction,
almost extinction, of malaria in England, and its decrease
in America, have been brought about by thorough underdraining, cultivation of the soil, and a wise attention     to

tree-planting and tree-preservation.  "Were it possible to
cover an ague-bearing tract with thick, grassy sod, health
would follow." (Crudelli.) The Eucalyptus-tree has done
excellent work in rendering certain Italian regions habitable. It would be well to introduce it in the southern parts
of the United States, and the willow in the bad districts
of the Northern States.  Both trees grow rapidly, both
withdraw immense amounts of water from the soil, and
both are useful in the arts.
132. In very malarious districts the houses should( be
built on arches or piles. Only the upper floors ought to
be occupied at night. Exposure in the early morning air
and in the night should be avoided.  You must breathe
night air: there is no other.  Hence have your rooms
well ventilated, especially at night.  Flannel should be
worn next to the skin. Hot coffee and a good breakfast
help to ward off the agent. Spirits are useless. Quinia,
in regular doses, is often the one means of keeping the
agent at bay.
133. CONSUMPTION (pulmonary phthisis) is a disease in
which a portion of the lung becomes solidified, and later
destroyed, cavities being formed in it. At the same time
there is a wasting of the blood and of the tissues of the
body. There are reasons for believing that one form of
consumption is contagious (126). A youth having a consumptive ancestry (287) has a predisposition to the disease.
A youth of a healthy family may develop from a cold or
a series of colds a destructive lung-disease.  The latter
youth, however, is not so liable, under common events,
to glide into conlsumption as the former.

134. CAUSATION OF    CONSUMPTION.-The germs of
tuberculous consumIUption may be transferred to a healtlhy
from a d(liseased person. The common factor in the causation of (lestructive lung-disease in all climtates-for consumption is comimon in the West an(l East Indies as well as
in New England-has been found to be the breathing of air
made impure by respiration. In Massachusetts dampness
of the soil hlas been fbund( to be an additional strong factor
(145, a). Whiere the air-space of the sleeping- and workinigrooms has been enlarged, and where the miethiods for tlhe
removal of the bad air hlave been improved, all other
conditions remainiing the same, there has been a marked
decrease in the death-rate from phthisis in all parts of the
world.
135. PREVENTION OF CONSUMPTION.-TO prevent the
onset of a destructive lung-disease, all persons should take
ordinary precautions.  Avoid a house located on a damp
soil (145, a) or in an ill-drained district; (lo not allow the
health so to fall off that common foods, containing average
amounts of fats, cannlot be taken; do not breatlle an air
laden with dusts (118), or a once-breathe(d air (120); avoid
sleeping in all ill-ventilated, suLnless, small roomr (150); if
possible, do not neglect slight complaints, as a cold, a chill,
or a diarrhoea.  Practise deep breathing (141).  The
climate best for consumptives is that one in whichl they
can pass the most hours in the sunshine in the open air.
"Very few vocalists die of consumption."  (Bach.)

tuous air-passages (Fig. 18) are lined with a membrane
the blood-vessels of which are laden with warm blood, and
the surface of which is bathed with moisture. Hence the
cool entering air, upon reaching the smaller tubes, is moist
an(i warm. Indians are remiarkably free from affections
of the nose, throat and ears. The immunity is largely due
to their habitual practice of nose-breathing.  (Wagner.)
Mouth-breathing is noisy; gives rise to bad odors, and is
unhealthy.  Mouthl-breathing, in cold weather, introduces
cold air too quickly to the fine air-tubes, and often induces
catarrhs, and even lung-fever (pneumonia).
136a. ALCOHOL IN CONSuMPTION.-Thlere is a belief
very commIon in this country that "good whiskey" is a
preventive and cure for pulmonary consumption.   This
opinion is almost entirely rejected by the best physicians,
and with excellent reason. In most cases alcohol has
proved itself much more powerful to do harm to consumlptives than to effect any benefit. On the other hand, it is
well known that hard drinkers are very liable to be attacked by pulmoniary consumption of a peculiarly swift and
deadly form. Indeed, there is hardly any chronic disease
that is not aggravated by the habitual use of alcoholics.
136b. TOBACCO-SMOKE, when ilnhaled into the lungs,
exercises upan many persons a peculiarly d(lepressing and
injurious effect. Apart from  its own special poisonous
principles, it is laden with carbonic oxide (carbon monoxide) and other highly injurious products of combustion
(such as the so-called pyroligneous acid).  Many old
smokers avoid, as far as they can, the inhalation of tobaccosmoke into the lungs.

65CHAPTER VII.
THE LARYNX.
137. THE LARYNX (Fig. 18, 1) acts a double part. It
forms a portion of the air-passages, and serves as the organ
of voice.
138. VOICE.-During ordinary breathing the vocal cords
(Fig. 18, 1) are widely separated, and the air passes in
and out freely.  When a vocal sound is to be produced,
the cords are tightened by muscle-action, and the right and
left cords approach, leaving a fine slit-like interval. A
forceful expulsion of air from the lower air-passages causes
the edges of the cords or bands to vibrate, and the air in
the larynx, pharynx (Fig. 18, p), and nasal passages (Fig.
18, n) to be agitated, and sound results.
139. VOICE-FAILURE.-The wrong production of the
voice and the abuse of the vocal apparatus are the chief
causes of most of the cases of voice-failure, and even of
throat-disease. In voice-culture the chief faults are (1)
attempting to use the voice with an insufficient amount of
air, or with imperfect control over the respiration, and
(2) an undue forcing of the registers.(a)  (Browne.)
(a) A register is "a series of tones produced by the same mechanism." The human
voice is said to have five registers. Each register is produced by a distinct muscular
mechanism.

cords du'ring breathing? During the making of vocal sounds?
How is a vocal sound produced? 139. Mention causes of voice-failure. What faults in voice-culture?
66THE LARYNX.
140. AIR-CAPACITY.-Tlie air which always remains
in the normal lung air-passages (adult) is estimated at one
hundred cubic inches (1640 c.c.).  The "tidal air" which
passes in and out during ordinary breathing is about thirty
cubic inches (500 c.c.). By a forced inspiration about ninetyeight cubic iinches (1600 c.c.) can be added to the "tidal
air."  The amount of "ti(ldal air" can be nteluch augmented
by the habit of deep breathinig.  A large amount of air in
the air-passages, and a control over that air, are essential
to good vocalization (singing, recitation, reading).
141. THORACIC EXERCISE.-GO out of doors, into the
fields or the park.  If the thoracic and abdominal garments are "snug-fitting," loosen them.  Slowly draw air
in through the nasal passages.  Fill the chest quite full.
Do not strain. Allow the air to pass out slowly and deliberately.  Execute twenty or thirty of these mnovements.
Repeat the series, if possible, several times daily. By suich
exercises thle blood will be better oxygenated, the waste will
be more completely expelled, the digestion will be inproved, the general well-being will be advanced, the aircapacity will be increased, and the power over the respiratory muscles will be augmented.
142. VOCAL ExERCISE.-During exercise an easy, erect
posture should be maintained.  The chest, abdominal, and
neck apparel must be loose-fitting.  Tight lacing leads
to improper breathing, and tends to give a tremolo and a
bad quality to the voice. The exercises mnust not be carried to the point of exciting soreness or fatigue. They

should be graduated and progressive. The course should
not be   hurried.(a)    Until   the  larynx    and  the  lungs are
drilled  into  accord, the   exercises ought to     be  brief; and
the  pallses  of such   a  length   as  fully   to rest all parts.
During the transition period, from the thirteenth to the
sixteenth year, the vocal organs should not be unduly
exercised. In some children all vocal drill and practice
nmust be suspended during that time.
(a) Suggestioins in the form of Punch's "Don't."  "Don't choose a poor teacher for beginners; don't indulge in superficial breathing; don't use too much breath in singing;
don't fail to pronounce the consonants distincetly; don't clear the throat; don't malke
your exercises in any other than the middle register; doh't fail to avoid very hot or very
cold or hotly-spiced dishes, strong drink, and heavy tobacco."CHAPTER VIII.
THE HOME.
143. FROM a hygienic point of view the home is a
most important consideration. The mother, the youngest
children, and the elderly spend most of their hours beneath
its roof:  The young, the workers, and        the middle-aged
spend from one-third to one-half of their hours in its sittingor sleeping-rooms.    In order that health may be established
and continued, it is necessary that the home be a welllocated, well-arrantged, and well-cared-for structure.
(a) The more common dliseases amosg farmers are: (1) air-passage maladies in various
forms; (2) rheumatism; (3) dyspepsia; (4) fevers, especially of a typhoid type (229, a).
The farmer's homne is too often located in a low, damp, and unhealthy spot. In such
cases the cellars are damp and the drainage poor. In order to save step,, the hlouse-well
is quite near the barn, perhaps the barn-yard, the sink-drain, antd the water-closet,as well
as the kitchen. Farm-houses are no oftener badly located than houses in villages, towns,
and cities, but in the latter there is little or no choice. Farm-houses may be and ought
to be better located than city residences.
144. THE SITE.-Gravel hillocks are the healthiest of
all positions.    Pure sands and       most gravels are healthy,
provided they do not lie below      the level of the adjacent
country.   Clay, marl, and allutvial soils (fine clay and sand)
tmust be considered  as suspicious.    Well-cultivated   lands
are often healthy.    Deep garden-mould and       "made land"
(especially when city wastes have been used) are held to be
dangerous.    A   "made soil" improves after a       few  years'
exposure, unless further polluted.         Positions near the top

69LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
of a slope, on the sunny side, secure air-movements and are
easy to draini, and are therefore desirable.
145. PREPARATION OF SITE.-Dampness is often as
much of an enemy as filth (274). Trees should be removed prudently. A belt of trees is an excellent windguard   and  malaria-obstructor.      Brush-wood     must always
be cleared   away.    The    trees should    be  so removed     that
grass  can  grow    luxuriantly    about the    house.    Herbage
conduces   to  health.    It removes water from       the  surfacesoil, cools the     air, prevents     dust-gusts, utilizes the organic
waste, and offers an agreeable hue to the eye. In all cases
it is best that the    site be   pipe-drained.     The   entire  lot
should   be drained, and     the  main   drain   should   be  lower
than  the bottom   of the cellar.    If old   drains or cesspools
exist, they should be cleaned and filled with concrete or
gravel.
(a) Dr. H. I. Bowditch hlas formulated a law concerning conesumption in Massachusetts,
which law "has for its central idea that dampness of the soil of any township or locality is
intimately connected with the prevalence of consumption in tliat township or locality."
(b) "But in addition to phthisis, there are other diseases the prevalence of which is
largely affected by dampniess of soil. Thus, rheutmatism, heart-disease, catarrhal conplaibts,
and agee are especially comlmon in damp districts; and no greater proof canll be given of
the sanitary advantages arising fromi drainage on an extensive scale than the total disappearance of the last-namined disease in various parts of the country (Englandl) where it
wvas at one time so conimon. Moreover, it is evident that in towns situated. on damp,
pervious soils there is the constant danger of filth-accumulations finding their way by
soakage into surface wells (225), or, as has previously been shown, the soil may eventually
become excrement-sodden, so that the air as well as the well-water becomes polluted."
(Wilson.)
146. GROUND-AIR.--A1ll soils contain a varying amount
of moisture and damp air laden with the products of decayprocesses. When the site is not well drained, and when
the cellar is not paved and cemented and the walls grouted,
145. What is the influence of damp? Trees? Brush-wood? Herbage?  Drainage?   146. What exists in soils?  How may ground-air

70THE HOME.
ground-air is quite liable to enter the cellar and ascend to
the rooms above.   This movement is most rapid and dangerous during the cold months, when the rooms are heated.
Thus it is that illuminating gas and sewer-gas fromn the
street mains, and gases from rotting " made soils" (144)
and excreta in the soils, enter the home and cause ill health
and disease. The ground near the home, therefore, should
not be polluted by excreta.
(a) "It appears probable that a dry gravel and possibly a very dry coarse sand interpose
no barrier to thlle free entrance into houses built upon them of those organisms which
swarm in the ground-air around leaching cesspools, leaky drains, etc., or in the filthy,
made ground of cities." (B. M. S. J.)
147. THE FOUNDATION.-The stone, hard-burned brick,
cement, and sand should be selected with care.      In most
situations health will be advanced by having the cellarbottom cemented and the walls grouted.     All pipes should
be in sight, never in the cellar walls.  In damp districts,
in order to prevent d(lamp reaching the walls, a "dampproof course" of slate or enamelled( brick is advisable above
the level of the ground.    Ample windows for cross-ventilation of the cellar demand attention.    On damp soils,
where the cellar does not extend und(er the whole house,
the flooring ought to be raised two feet or more from the
ground.   This under space demands window cross-ventilation.
148. BUILDING-MATERIALS.-It is well for the materials
to be porous and permeable.    Such materials allow of aircirculation through the walls, and the removal of moisture
from the rooms and the walls, and thus conduce to health.
The moisture and bad air reaching the outer surfaces are
147. Speak of the cellar-bottom. Pipes. Cellar-windows. Cellarless parts. 148. What may be said of porous building-materials?

71LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
rapidly removed by wind and sunlight. The want of such
air-currents is noticeable in new-plastered rooms, in the
lower rooms of houses on damp soils, and in basement
rooms. As wet clothes remove the body-hleat rapidly (79),
so damp walls cause room-air to be chilly. Air-currents
in the materials are the remedy for the moisture of dwelling-houses.
149. THE WALLS.-Dryness of walls is best secured by
making themn hollowv.  Walls that afford proper space for
air between the lathl and sheathing, and that lhave the best
of sand and mortar finish, are most desirable. Brick walls
should always be hollow, also divisional walls. For the
preservation of joists and flooring, "air-bricks" may be
inserted at proper places. With double walls it is not
advisable to apply water-proof composition to the outer
wall surface. Tightness of the roof is a primne necessity
for the preservation of the house and for health.
150. LIGHT AND Am.-The windows shiould reach
almost to the ceiling. Thley should be so arranged as to
be easily lowered. A  single window may light a room,
but such a room must have an open transom over the hall
door, or the door be left ajar, to insure good air throughout
the room. Every room should be so placed that (lirect
sunligllt shall enter for a few hlours daily. Houses where
the long axis runs east and west cannot well fulfil this
requisite. The dark inner rooms of thie houses occupied
by artisans, clerks, and laborers are fertile sources of ill
health, misery, and crime. Beware of a house having a
"muisty-smelling" hall. All large hlouses should have a

central   hall-ventilating     shaft, or    a  roof-opening.       The
water-closet should always be located outside of the inhabited house.(b)
(a) According to Cohn, the school-room windows collectively should equal at least
one-fifth of the floor-space: some Amiericais authorities allow only one-sixth.  MIost
school-rooms in thlle United States have the following faults: (1) the cubic space allowed
to each scholar is too small (minimum space should be two hundred and fifty cubic feet
to each scholar); (2) the means of ventilatiou are, as a rule, wholly inadequate, eveni if
the cubic space allowed were sufficient (minimumi of fresh air should be fifteen hundred
cubic feet per hour per pupil); and (3) the deskls are not placed to admit the best action
of the eyes (363).
(b) THE WATER-CLOSET.-In town houses the water-closet should be in an "annex" or
tower, separated from the house by a latticed and roofed passage, permitting free cross
air-currents, and by double doors. Thlle "soil-pipe" must extend above the roof, and
should have a flaring top. Each water-closet should hlave a separate roof-reachling ventilator-shaft as well as a Nwindow. Could a lamp burn in the shaft all the timie, or the
waste steam-pipe run in the same, it would be well. It would be advisable to have all
slop-dumps, bath-rooms, and wash-rooms in the "annex."  In cosntry houses, where the
town method cannot be followved, the wvater-closet should be well removed from the
houses and the well, should have a water-tight vault and roof-reaching ventilators, one
from the vault and one from the water-closet. The water-closet should be connected
with the houses by a dry walk, shleltered from wind and rain, yet ventilated. For the
aged ansd the feeble, an "earth-closet" may be arranged in the house. The earth used
must be dry, the amount used ample, and the pan ought to be emptied daily.
151. AIR-SPACE.-TO            secure and continue the best
health attainable, there should be one thousand cubic feet
of space allowed per head in buildings p)ermanently occupied as dwelling-houses. When warmed fresh air can be
freely admitted, four      hundred     cubic  feet will suffice    (9.4
kilolitres). In sick-rooms there should be twelve hundred
to two thousand cubic feet of space per head. The air of
such a room must be frequently renewed. The entering
air for a room     occupied mnany hours in succession should not
be less thall twenty-five      hundred     cubic feet (70 kilolitres)
per hour per head(l. The less the cubic space, the more
rapid   must    be  the   air-currents.      Draughts     will   occur.

Hence the advantage of large rooms.     Sufficient air should
enter and leave a room, so that an outsider entering the room
will experience no sense of "closeness" nor detect bad odors.
(t) An ordinary passenger-car (railway) has seats for about seventy persons. It has
an air-space of about two thousand five hundred( cubic feet; i.e., nearly enough forfour
persons. Accordinlg to Prof. Huxley's estimates, a car full of clean passelgers would
give off six )oueds of solid, liquid, and gaseous impurities each hour. The ventilators
of no ordinary car remove so much. Is it then a wonder that headaches, nausea, colds,
and fevers so often succeed journeys?
152. SUNLIGHT AND VENTILATION.-Ventilation is the
removal, by currents of normal air (114), of the impure
air of rooms.   The most thloroughly calked room       is not
proof against air-mnovemnents when there is a slight difference of temperature.     There can be no efficient natural
ventilation in the absence of direct sunlight.    The heat of
the sun's rays causes the air in the nooks and crannies to
"move on."     Sunlight brings to notice collections of dirt
and filth in the corners and under furniture.       It favors
the oxidation and destruction of dead organic mtatters.    It
works against the growth of moulds and low organisms.
Tent-life, insuring abundance of normal air and sunlight,
is excellent for summers.
153. ARTIFICIAI, VENTILATION.-In suimmer, the doors
and windows being opened, natural air-chianges will suffice.  In the cold months, in most houses, ventilation and
warming must work together. When the air of a room is
warmned by artificial heat, or by the presence of persons, it
expands, rises, and, if any opening exists, flows to another
room, or outside, while a cooler current sets in from    elsewhere.    Small houses can     be quite well ventilated by
taking advantage of the movemnents induced by heating.,
152. Define ventilation. Speak of sunlight. Of tent-life. 153.
What of summer and winter ventilation? What is the effect of
warmth? Instance healthy airs.
74THE HOME,
In cold climates the entrance of warm normal air is
healthier than the entrance of cold air. A normal cold
air is less injurious than an imipure dry warm air (134).
154. INLETS.-Irregular, rapid, and excessive currents
of air are injurious. Holes can be made anywhere, but
they do not always ventilate a space, for too often the entire
air-currents pass through the space and leave the sidemasses of foul air unchanged.   The inlet-tubes must be
short, smooth, and easy of access for cleaning-purposes.
When possible, each room ought to have its own inlets. If
the incoming air is not warmed, inlets should discharge
about four feet from the floor.
155. The AIR-SHAFT for the furnace or steam-heater
should start four feet above the ground on the clear side
of the house. Its entrance should have a netting of wire,
and sometimes also a flannel filter. During the winter, air
must not come from cellars. The regulatinig valve shiould
be at the entrance. Keep the inlets clean. In the sumDier,
if the cellar is clean, cold air may be taken from it.
156. OUTLETS.- In ordinary houses the outlets must be
near the ceiling. In most house-rooms, the lowering of
the windows will suffice. It is better, hlowever, to provide
amp]e outlets near the ceiling. These outlets should have
no valves. A grating over the chandelier should always
be present.
157. HEAVY DUSTS, as in factories, may be sucked out
near the floor. Where live steam is used, or where special
warmned shafts are constructed, the foul air can be drawn

out anywhere. The inlets and outlets must be numerous,
but not large (inlets not more than forty-eight square
inches, outlets one hundred and forty-four square inches).
A large mnetal hood, leading by pipe into the chimney or
directly out through the roof, ought to be suspended over
every kitchen stove.
158. ORDINARY METHODS.-Rootms warmed by stoves
may be fairly ventilated by puttiing a board about four
inches wide, extending fromn side to side, under the lower
sash of each windlow, and havintg one sash lowered at the
top; or by having a fine-meshed wire netting to follow down
the upper sash when it is lowered; or by having a board
attached to the lowered upper sash arranged to direct the
incoming currents against the ceiling; or by using double
windows, having the outer lower and the inner upper constantly open. Unless special inlets are provided, the new
-though probt)ably not normal-air will come in from the
other rooms and the cellar through cracks and crevices.
159. OPEN FIRE.-This is a healthy method of warming a small room in a moderately cold climate. The heat
is pure heat, not the drying, parching, i'mpure air warmth
of the stove, furnace, or steam-pipe. Only twelve per cent.
of the heat evolved is utilized. It is a grand ventilator, but
it is costly, and it gives rise to cold currents along the floor.
Yet it is cheerful and most healthy. Persons who have
an open fire, as a rule, suffer less from coughs, colds, headaches, neuralgias, and petty ills than do those who keep
their rooms close, stuffy, and hot with stove- and furnaceheat. When an open fire is used, special inlets (154) are
essential. Inlets properly placed mitigate floor-draughts.

Give the advantages of an open fire. The disadvantages. Hence?
76THE HOME.                                77
160. THE STOVE is an economical but unhealthy heating
agent.    There    should   be   no  back-damper, because it prevents the rapid escape of the products of the burning.              The
water-urn should be so near the source of heat that large
amounts of water-vapor may be given forth to mitigate the
parching heat.
(a) STOVES.-The close stove, for wood or coal, lheats the air of the room. It takes oxygen from the roomi-air to continue its burning. It directly brings no fresh air into the
room. It talkes little fobul air out of the room. It does not ventilate. It gives forth a dry,
parching, and, too often, excessive heat. It flurnishes to the room upwards of threefourths of the heat evolved.
(b) FURNACE AND STEAM.-In a cold climnate, hieating and venltilatiotn should be combined. That system is best wchich introlduces as abuoadacec of warmted normal air into thle -00rooms
and removes the ih:pure air. Air that has been heated to 300~ or 400~ F. is unlfit to be
breathed. Such an air is introduced by the majority of furnaces (12(0, c). Even when
common furnace-air is diluted and cooled before it enters the room, it is parching
and unhealthy. The heating of the air of a room by hot-water or steam pipes, as fresh
wal:med air is not introduced, is also objectionable. Either miethod of heating may well
be stupplemented by the fire on the hearth. Where health is regarded rather than expense, indirect steam-heating is best. Allow the outer air for each rooil to enter directly
a clean, confined space containing a coil of heated steam-pipes, and then to move on to
the room. Thus a stream of warmned pure air will enter the room. The wvaste steam
will hleat the ventilating shafts, and will insure removal of the foul air.
161. ROOM-TEMPERATURE.-Every house ought to have
a good thermometer. The right temperature of rooms in
winter is important.         The temperature should be taken
about four feet from the floor on the side of the room
opposite to the stove. At this place the temperature may
be kept at 60~ F. in rooms for the healthy.
Young children and the elderly require from 65~ to 70~; young infants, 70~ to 80~; the
sicl, from 600 to 65~; in fever cases, 40~ to 50~ is often the best. It would be advisable
for the children's room to have a false floor, about one foot above the ordinary floor, in
order that the " creepers" shall not feel the full force of the cold floor-draughts.
162. PLIANTS IN RooMs.-Plants at all hours give forth

small amounts of carbonic acid. Under the influence of sunlight they absorb large amnounts of carbonic acid and give
forth oxygen. At night the carbonic acid absorption and
oxygen eliminiation quite cease. During cloud(ly weather
the oxygen production is diminishe(d. Plants in the livingrooms are air-purifiers during the hours of sunlight. They
do little or no harm in the sleeping-room during the nighthours if the room is well ventilated.
163. SLEEPING-RooMS.-These roomis, in which onethird of life is passed, should be located so as to receive
thie direct sunlight several hours daily (150). Each person ought to have eight hundred cubic feet (18.7 kilolitres)
of space at least: more space would be better. If there is
no fireplace in the room in whilch a fire is kept for a few
hours daily or a lighted taper burning all night, then the
upper sash must be kept lowered night and day, severe
weather alone excepted. These precautions are most important, for during the waking hours our senses can warn us
of air-impurities, but during sleep smell and taste do not
afford us early and efficient warning. It is during the
sleeping hours that sewer-gas and illuminating gas do their
evil work.
164. GAS-PIPES ought never to be within the walls or
under the floors of sleeping-rooms. If gas is to be used
in such rooms, then all pipes and fixtures must be in the
room, so that leaks may be readily located. Fixed washbasins are a source of danger (122).

sooner or later acquire the same disease (134); also that
when two persons in ordinary health share the same bed,
the influence is not for the best health of the-parties~ The
old and the young certainly oughlt not to occupy the same
bed.
166. CELLARS.-" Mould and decaying vegetables in a
cellar weave shrouds for the upper chambers."  A damp
cellar is a very undesirable feature of a home.  Cellars
ought to have many windows, in order to admit the sunlight and to further cross-ventilation (147). In constructing a house, let the chimneys start from the cellar-bottom.
Have a flue within or alongside the chimney fronm the
cellar to the roof. The heat of the smoke-flue will draw
the bad air from the cellar. A cellar shlould be inspected
and cleaned the first Saturday of every month. Roomair ought not to be drawnl from the cellar (158).
167. HEALTHY HOMEs.-The objects to be secured in a
healthy home are perfect purity and cleanliness of the air
(114), freedom  fromn excessive moisture (145, a), ample
direct sunlight in every room (152), an abundance of pure
water (220, a), a ready removal of solid, liquid (275), and
gaseous waste substances (153), and the minimum of stairclimbing. - After these have been attained, minor comforts,
convenience, and adornments may be considered.

FOODS.
168. THE HUMAN BODY is a mechanism capable of
storing up energy and force, and of giving forth energy
and force, as the system demands. The storage of energy,
as well as the giving forth of stored-up energy, occasions
wear of the mechanism.     The building up of every
thought, of every activity, of every motion of the body
occasions tissue-changes. All tissue-changes cause the formation of wastes.
169. In order that normal body-action may continue,
the used-up materials must be replaced and the wear of
the machine must be made good. In order that the
human machine may do more work, when young it mnust
grow, and its stores must be increased. The wastes are
made good, the wear is provided for, the working of the
mechanism is aided and its growth made possible, by the
taking into the system of materials known asfoods.
170: A FooD is a substance which, when utilized or
destroyed in the system, gives forth hleat or force. Foods
furnish the materials which build up, repair, and sustain
the system.
171. MILK contains all the chemical elements found in
the human body (10): (1) the proteid substances, like the
casein and albumen of cheese; (2) the fats and oils, as in

do foods furnish? 171. Of what does milk consist?
80cream; (3) the carbo-hydrate class, as in milk-sugar; and
(4) the water and salt class, as in the whey.
172. I. THE PROTEIDS, or nitrogenous food-stuffs (C,
H, O, N, S, with P and Ca), are mostly derived from the
flesh of animals, birds, and fishes; from  eggs and milkcheese; from peas, beans, and vetches; and from wheat,
barley, oats, and maize (corn) flours or preparations.
173. II. THE FATS AND OILS, or hydro-carbons (C, H,
O), are found in the diet-lists of most peoples.  The fats
are principally obtained from the blubber of sea-animals,
the bodies of animals and birds, the yellow of the egg, the
flesh and livers of fish, and cow's milk. The oils are
largely derived from the palm, the olive, the cotton-seed,
the rape-seed, and the cocoa-nut.   Maize is rich in fats.
The other grains, oats excep)ted, are quite deficienit in fats.
174. III. THE CARBO-HYDRATE CLASS (C, H, O) is a
most important part of a normal diet.  This class embraces
the starches of the grains, roots, and tubers, the sugars of
the cane, beet, sorghum, fruits, honey, and milk, the vegetable-acid salts of fruits and vegetables, the cellulose of
plants and grains, and the vegetable extractives.
175. The substances of the carbo-h(ydrate class are mostly
derived from the vegetable world.   They containi the same
chemical elements as certain of the oils, yet in the repairing
and building up of the body they act quite differently from
oils. In feeding, starches can be chaniged for fats, and fats
for starches, only to a very limited extent.

Na, Ca, Mg, C, P, S, C1, Fl, Fe, Si) is as essential for
health as the proteid class. Upon this class depends the
integrity of the framework. If a normal diet is taken,
all of these elements will be present in sufficient quantities, with the exception, perhaps, of common salt (NaCl).
177. V. THE ACCESSORY CLASS includes the various
condiments, relishes, acids, spices, tea, coffee, cocoa, and
alcoholics. Of their action in aiding the body-work and
activities but little is known. Sonme of this class ought
never to be used (Chapter XIV.), the others only in
moderation.
178. DIET FOR HEALTH.-A certain amount of each
of the first four classes must be present in a perfect diet.
The best proportion for the common wants of the adult
human system is about twenty-two of proteids, sixty-nine
of the carbo-hydrate class, and nine of fats. In such a diet
there will be sufficient salts (176). Health is not long kept
when the carbo-hydrate class contains none of the vegetable
acids found in fruits, potatoes, fresh vegetables, and in limeor lemon-juice. Their absence induces the condition known
as scurvy.
179. AMOUNT OF FooD.-The amount of food required
by a healthy adult is large (182, a). He demands, under
average work, about five and a half pounds of water and
one pound and a third of dry food-substances every twentyfour hours. This food must contain at least two hundred
and fifty grains of nitrogen in its digestible proteids. Fats
are most essential in the diets of hard workers. They hold
up a healthy person under continued exertion better than

less than in-door working males, and from one-fourth to
one-third less than out-door male laborers.
(a) Under ordinary circumstances, a daily ration should contain about the following
proportions and quantities (Table L). This might be fuirnished by a mixed diet of the
following foods (Table II.). In the latter table t an excess of about an ounce is included,
because small quantities of cellulose existing in the foods have no feeding-value (174).

180. INFANTS' FOOD.-The food          of infants should be
water and milk.     Up to the age of nine or ten months,
human milk is preferable. When artificial feeding must
be resorted to, then allow the infant to takle its fill of clean
warm water. When it has satisfied its thirst, after an interval, allow   it to suck all the warmed, undiluted cow's
milk  (slightly salted) it wants.    The tube should     be so
knotted or contracted that the flow shall be quite slow.
The addition of cream softens and divides the curds.
Lime-water is often useful. Some infants, however, may
require diluted milk. Starchy and flesh foods ought nIot
to be given during the first seven months.
181. CHrLDREN'S FOOD.-From          the twelfth to the eighteenth month, milk should form      the main food.     With it
may be combined baked fruits, potatoes, oatmeal, and wheat
preparations (204, a) in gradually increasing amounts.           Up
to the ninth year, the diet should be mainly milk, wellcooked oat, maize, barley, and decorticated wheat foods,

rice, most fruits and vegetables, fish, and occasionally
roasted meats. Pastry, cakes, hot bread, tea, and coffee
ought not to be given.
182. At the tenth year a child may partake of the usual
food of the family, tea, coffee, and sharp condiments and
spices excepte(l. At this time it will require half as much
in quantity as an adult womnan, and at the fourteenth year
quite as much.
(a) AN AMERICAN SOLDIER has a daily allowance of 22 ounces of bread, 12 ounces of
pork or bacon or 20 ounces of salt or fresh beef, 15 ounces of potatoes (three times a
weekl), 1.6 ounces of rice, with 1.6 ounces of coffee, 2.04 ounces of sugar, 0.64 gill of beans,
0.32 gill of vinegar, and 0.16 gill of salt. The total quantity provided for a soldier of
the United States Army is larger than that consumed by the general working-man.
183. WATER      constitutes  sixty-eight per    cent. of   the
entire body. As a beverage it is one of the most important parts of the   human    food.   A   good  water has these
characters:   clearness, freedom    from   odor or taste, good
aeration, coolness, and a certain degree of softness.            Vegetables cook best in a soft water.
184. FRESH, COOL       WATER     (40~   to 50~ F.;     10~  to
15.5~ C.) is a tonic to the stomach.      Each   adult requires
a little upwards of two     quarts of water, taken     as water,
or in  tea, coffee, etc., every      twenty-four hours (179, a).
This amount suffices to carry on the body-functions in a
normal manner. Constipation, which is so common among
females and     sedentary    men, is largely due to a want of
sufficient liquid in the intestinal canal.
(a) It is to the taking of unaccustomed large amounts of water daily, rather than to
the minerals contained in the same, that the good effects of "a course at the springs"
are due. It is the "flushing" and cleansing action of the water that has made the
"hot-water craze" so successful.

water? Mention characteristics. 184. How  much water? Cause
of constipation?
84185. MILK is the best of foods for the young, the convalescent, and the aged (180). The proportion of the proteids and fats is relatively large, its digestion is easy and
rapid, and its feeding-power is great, because there is little
waste.
186. Cow's MILK is best when taken in the fresh state.
Milk should not be taken by the glassful at a gulp. It
ought to be taken by swallows, with short intervals coming
between, otherwise large indigestible curds may form. A
tumbler of fresh milk, as hot as it can be sipped, is an excellent morning "pick-me-up." The heating of milk to
100~ F. (37.6~ C.) often enables a person to take it with
regularity and to digest it with ease. The tendency to
curdle may be corrected by using lime-water; the constipating effect, by the taking of more water.
187. CREAM.-Milk is often too poor, but never too
rich. Cream removed by "skimming" is preferable to the
"centrifugal process cream."  By adding cream to the
milk the amount of fat is increased and the curd is softene(l. "Fat, butter, and oily matters in general require
no digestion; the emulsion into which they are mechanically converted passes (almost directly) iilto the general circulation of the blood."  (Chmurch.) Thus it is that cream
and genuine milk butter are such excellent articles for
hard work in cold climates, and for the sustaining of the
sick. The melting of butter and fats renders the emulsion process more difficult.

healthy cows which are fed on normal food (not city or
brewery slops), furnished( with pure water, and kept in
clean, ventilated stables.  The milk from young cows is to
be preferred. Clean glass jars, closed and sealed at the farm,
offer the safest method of transportation. A suspicious
milk should be well boiled before being used.         Tinned
milk is inferior to fresh milk, and is too rich in sugar.
Milk from tuberculous cows is dangerous. The direct transmission of tuberculosis
from the cow to man thlrough mtilk is, however, difficult of proof. Cans washed with
fecal-polluted well-water have been known to contaminate the contained millk with
typhoid-fever germs.
189. COOKING.-By the aid of heat the chemical aind
physical conditions of foods are changed.       The protei(ds
are slightly swollen, and are made jelly-like, or coagulated.
(Boiling an egg coagulates the white.) The fat-cells are
ruptured and the fat-globules rendered more fluid.       Tlhe
cells containing starch are split open, and the starch-grains
become more or less pulpy. The cellulose and lignin of
vegetable tissues are softened and brokeni up.      Peculiar
flavors and odors are developed in cooking.     By cooking,
most foods are softened and become more finely divided.
190. METHODS OF COOKING.-Animal flesh, oysters excepted, and starchy and cellulose substances, ripe fruits
excepted, should   be cooked    before  being   eaten.   The
simpler methods of cooking make the most wholesome
foods.   Cooking demands knowledge, skill, preparation,
and waiting.   Good cooking is the basis of a happy home.
191. ROASTING AND BROILING are the best miethiods of
cooking meats.    The heat, at first, should be intense, it)
order to form a protective film whichl shall retaini the juices.

in cooking? 191. Method of roasting? Effects produced?
86Later, the heat should be moderate, butt long-continued.
The roasting of fruits and potatoes renders themi more
palatable, digestible, and inutritious.  The baking of flour
renders it sweeter, breaks the starch-grains, anld makes the
starch more digestible.
192. BOILING.-II the case of vegetables, boiling effects
the solution of the sugar, the rupture of the starch-cells, a
partial solution of the starch-grains, the coagulation of the
proteids, and a softening of the cellulose. In the case of
meats, the proteids are coagulated, the muscle-bundles are
broken, and the juices extracted.  In either case the water
becomes laden with valuable salts and extractives.  These
fluids should be utilized.
In boiling meats, first plunge the flesh into boiling-hot
water.  Retain it there a few minutes.  A protective film
is formed.  This film helps to retain the nutritive juices.
Now cook it in water of a temperature of 160~ F. (71~ C.)
for a very long time.
193. BRAIZING.-Whlen small bits of meats are to be
cooked, this is a good method.    Stew or semi-stew the
meat, then brown it under high heat in the oven.    This
method renders the viand tender and develops an appetizing flavor.
194. FRYING.-The cooking of substances in melted oils
and fats is a most objectionable method. The heated fats
more or less permeate the food-mass.  These fats are with
difficulty formed into emulsions.   They also hinder the
access of the digestive fluids to the food-materials.

filrnish materials for the need(s of a robust man durilng
twenty-four hours.  Raw eggs are easily digested. The
fats of the yellow are very easily appropriated by the system.  Eggs should not be boiled or fried. They may be
well cooked by placing them in hot water in which they
shall remain from seven to twelve minutes.
196. MEATS contain a large amnount of proteids united
with much fat. Good meats are easily and rapidly cooked.
They are more easily digested than vegetable food(s, are
largely absorbed, and furnlish but little waste (208, "). As
they are lacking in starches, it is well to combine them
with bread, rice, or potatoes.
197. SELECTION OF MEATS.-The muscles ought to
b)e firnm, elastic, but not tough. Thlere should be a nearly
uniform hue in the cross-section. Lividity indicates danger.
Mucus-like fluid or pus between the muscle-bundles is a
very suspicious sign. The fat should be fine, have a whitishyellow hue, have no bleeding points, and no jelly-like consistency. Good meat has a marbled appearance, owing to
the running of little lines of fat among the muscles. Good
meat is uniform in its feel; putrefying meat has soft spots
here and there. The odor of the meat and the odor of the
knife should be noticed.
198. SALT MEATS, SO far as nutriment is concerned, are
about as good as fresh meats from which a good soup has
been extracted. In most cases the salted mneats are hard
and indigestible.  The nutritive and stimulating portions
are left in the brine.

88excited before death has frequently proved unwholesome.
Flesh may be made poisonous through the foods taken by
the sound animal (weeds). Oysters, mussels, and crabs,
also sea-perch and conger-eel, when eaten, sometimes cause
severe disturbance of the human system.
200. The flesh of pigs which had been fed on garbage
has been known to excite stomach and intestinal troubles.
The decomposing flesh of animnals is sometimes eaten without mishap (piquant game), and at other times even
thorough   cooking   has not prevented      vomiting, diarrhoea,
and prostration.        Decaying sausages are known to develop
a very active poison. All flesh having an objectionable
odor ought to be avoided.
201. PARASITES.-Fresh pig's flesh may contain the
Trichina, or    the  "cyst-worm"     of   a  tape-worm     (Taenia
solium).    Fresh ox's flesh may contain the "cyst-worm" of
another   tape-worm     (Tenia   medio. canellata), and    shleep's
liver  may   contain   the   "fluke-worm"      (Distoma).     Our
safety against all these intruders is to cook flesh thoroughly. Thorough roasting is safest. No raw or underdone flesh is a safe food.
(a) On September 15, 1883, a trichinous pig was killed at Emersleben, Saxony. The
flesh was disposed of on that and the following day. Accordiing to Saxon custom, nearly
all the flesh was eaten in a raw state, or in a green smoked state, as minced meat. The
earliest illness occurred on September 18; by the 28th the disease wvas quite prevalent.
Up to November i1, out of a population of about 1000 persons, there had occurred 361
cases, of which 57 had proved fatal.
(b) Fourment's experiments show that the most efficient salting does not destroy the
Trichinme. Ordinary snioking does not touch the Trichime (Kitchenmeister). A temperature of 144~ to 155~ F. kills the free Trichinae (Fiedler). The most thorosigh cooking of
a leg of pork by boiling (165~ in the interior) does not destroy the life of the enlcapsuled
Trichine (Vacicher). A temperature of 212~ F. does not ruin the eggs of many parasites.
(c) During the wveek ending March 22, 1884, thirty-three thousandl four hsindred and
five pounds of diseased meat and "bob" veal were seized by the inspectors of the Health
Department in New York City.

202. FISH.-The water-world affords excellent foods.
Fish, as food, is not equal to     flesh.  It is insufficient to
maintain   full health  and   vigor.   When    salmon, herring,
shad, or white-fish   are  "cheap,"    they  are  the mnost economical of animal foods in proportion       to their nutriment.
Fish average about the same percentages of proteids as the
meats, but, in general, have less of fats.
(a) The cod, haddock, and bass, as well as oysters, scallops, and clams, have little fat.
Eels, shad, mackerel, herring, salmon, and turbot are very fat. Fish should be combined
with beans, rice, bread, and potatoes in order to make a fair diet.

203. WHEAT contains much nutriment in small bulk.
It is quite rich in soluble proteids.    Its starches are abundant and are easy to digest.    The salts are largely   made up
of phosphates.        The "fine flouLr" made fromi wheat is lacking in flesh-formers, fat-formers, and bone-formers. "Decorticated wheat flour" makes sweeter, more nutritious, and

because he eats "butter with             bread.")       The external surface of bread       should     be well baked, uot           burnt.      Bread
ought to be from        one-fifth to one-third        crust.     The crumb
should be permeated with regular cavities. No part should
be sodden.       Even when held in the mouth its taste should
not be acid.       New bread is less digestible than stale bread,
because the crumb is soft, elastic, and sticky, and the digestive juices are slow        in permeating       the mass.
(a) The experiment of Rubner showvs that a white wheat-bread contains more assimilable nutriment than does one made from whole wheat-flour. This, however, does not
mniake it a desirable food for exclusive use. Children fed on white bread are very liable to
suffer from rickets (35), consumption, and badcl teeth. Dr. Kirk, of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Deaf and Dumb, reports that there was an entire change in the condition
of the children's teeth when they had been there a year. The teeth became harder and
more firmly placed in the sockets. Many cases of self-arrest of caries occulred. These
favorable changes were due to the food, which consisted of a liberal supply of milk,
preparations of maize, oats, and wheat from which the layer just under the siliceous coating had not been removed by milling, and a small amount of meat and sugar.
(b) The materials of wheat bran are but slightly assimilated by man. The "glutencells" of the fourth bran-layer appear to be little utilized in digestion. "The major portion
of the gluten of wheat exists in the central four-fifths of the grain." (Roessel.) To persons
of constipated habit whole-wheat foods are desirable. To non-constipated persons living
on a generoues mixed diet, the retention of the bran in the flour leads to a quickened peristaltic action, to the formation of gases, to incomplete digestion and absorption not only
of the proteids of the branny foods, but those of the other foods taken, and therefore
is not advisable. Persons of a vigorous habit living largely on bread ought to use wholegrain flours if they cannot procure flours from which the two or three outer protective
layers only have been removed. Finely-milled flours shoutld be used.
(c) Maize contains a large amount of fats as well as of starch. It requires a longer
and a more careful cooking than wheat or oats. It is an excellent food-stuff for robust
persons living in a cold climate and engaged in hard out-of-door labor.
(d) The oat has not only a large amount of proteids, but it is rich in fats. It is more,
easily cooked than wheat. When well cooked, its preparations make excellent foods for
sustained mental and physical labor. Oatmeal made into a thin gruel is a sulstaining
and cooling drink for men exposed to great heat, as stokers, puddlers, etc.
(e) Bai-ley contains a larger amount of digestible proteids than wheat. It is very rich
in phosphates and iron. The athletes of ancient Greece were trained on a barley diet.
(f) Rice contains the most easily digested and most perfectly assimilated of the starchgrains. It is very poor in proteids, fats, and salts. Rice is four times as nultritious as
potato (Ifiisig), and is also more uniform in quality. Rice and millet form the chief food
of more than half of the people of the world.
(g) Potato (Irish) has a very low feeding rank. Its starch is very digestible. It is very
poor in proteids and deficient in fats. Upwards of 75 per cent. of the best potato is
water. When consumed in excessive quantity (the regular allowance of an Irishman
at home is ten and one-half pounds daily (Smith),) potatoes fail to nourish the frame, they
make the blood watery, they render the muscles weak, and they form imperfect bones.LESSONS IN HYGIENE.
To save the most of their little nutriment, potatoes ought to be cooked in the skins. The
sweet potato has a higher nutritive value than the common potato.
(h) Beans and Peas are distinguished from other seeds by containing a very large
anmount of proteids (legumin). They are rich in starches, sulphur, and phosphorus.
In order to be cooked they demand very long boiling and baking. The skins should be
rejected, on account of their irritant qualities. As these seeds are deficient in fats and
contain much nitrogen, digestion is facilitated by combining pork and othler fats with
them (209). Even whenwell cooked, these seeds dellland strongdigestive powers in order
to utilize their stores of energy.. In rice and millet countries the people are indebted
to beans, peas, vetches, etc., for their highest nourishment.
205. SUCCULENT VEGETABLES (cabbage, lettuce, parsnip, turnip, etc.) are chiefly eatell for the juices and starches
which they contain, and are prized for certain flavors peculiar to each. Their feeding-power is small. All vegetables
slould be sound     and well preserved or fresh.        Most vegetables should be used only in the cooked state. The pottage-water of all vegetables, the potato excepted, should be
saved and used. When eaten raw, or dressed as salad,
vegetables ought to be used in moderation. No part of a
diet-list is more importanit than this portion. Salads afford
a ready means for many intestinal parasites to gain access to
the system.
206. FRUITS are mnost valuable for their acid salts (174),
their flavors, and their sugars.            Most fruits are agreeable,
refreshing, and cleansing rather than sustaining. The date
and fig, however, are staples in certain countries. Ripe
fruits, in their season, are beneficial and      healthy.    As unripe fruits contain      starches which have not been converted
into sugars, they    ought not to be      used, or, if used, they
should be well cooked before using.
(a) Vegetable Diet.-At the existing (1884) International Health Exhibition, London,
the "Vegetarian Society" are fiurnishing a sixpenny (twelve cents) dinner to four or five
hundred people daily. From a carefully-kept account of the substances used for the bill
of fare the followving "food equivalents" have been calculated (Table L). Physiologists
lay down the standard diet for ordinary labor pretty much as follows (Table II.):
205. For what are vegetables esteemed?      Mention   precautions;
dangers. 206. Speak of fruits; ripe; unripe.

Fats............44" Fats............ 1.6 se
Carbo-hydrates......... 3.17" Carbo-hydrates........18.7"
Salts...........09" Salts........... 1.0"
It appears, therefore, that it would require about six of the sixpenny dinners to support a man during a day's hard labor. (Med. Times cond Gaz., May 24, 1884.)
207. TINNED FOODs.-In well-canned foods the metallic
impurity, if any, will be a bit of tin solder, or some salt
of tin.  The formner is harmless; the latter, in poisonous
amounts, would give the contents such a metallic taste that
any sane person would avoid them.    Cans or tills sealed
with a tin and zinc compound are very dangerous.
Reject all tins that do not show a line of rosin around
the edge of the cap such as is seen near the seams.  Reject
every tin with two or more soldered holes in the caps.  A
"swell" or decomposing can may be detected by pressing
on the bottom.  A sound can affords a solid feel, a "swell"
tin gives forth a rattle-sound. Wlhen the till is opened, turn
out the entire contents.  Smell and taste.  Avoid tinned
foods which have a mnetallic taste or an odor of decay. Observing these precautions, tinned foods of reliable companies may be used fearlessly.
208. DIGESTIBILITY.-It is advantageous to thle animal
economy for vegetable stuffs to pass into and through the
system. Food-animals save humnan digestive labor an(l advance nutrition. A pound( of bread contains more feedingmatter (by analysis) than a poulld of beef-steak; but in an
ordinary man the bread does not do so mnuch feeding or
develop so much force, because the cooked meat is more
largely utilized and demands less energy to digest. The
