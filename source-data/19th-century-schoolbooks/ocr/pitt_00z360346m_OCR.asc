PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON LANGUAGE.
two classes, coherent speech would be possible; and the other classes
might be developed as circumstances should render them necessary to
give precision, accuracy, and facility to expression.
So far the object of language, in giving the meaDs of converse with
persons present, would be accomplished.  The want, however, cf the
powes to comnmunlicate with those not present, without making a third
person the confidant of the speaker, must eventually suggest the idea of
representing these sounds by signs addressed to the eye. Hence written
language, which, though primarily intended merely for this purpose, is
now, by the imperfection of alphabets, and the attempt to preserve the
etymology in words derived from other languages, so complicated as partially to obscure the original design.
It is, however, of the English language only that we propose to treat;
but, since all language marks the development of the human mind, and
as the human mind is essentially the same in all nations and ages, the
general principles of all1 languages are alike. For instance, though we
have greatly enriched the English language by borrowing from the Latin
and others, it is said that in no instance have we adopted a grammatical
power, but only words -which either have been, or are now in process
of becom.ing, Anglicized. It is to the Anglo Saxon that we are indebted
for the grammatical principles of the present English; the only influence
of other languages in that department being this-that certain giammatical forms which existed in the parent tongue were dropped, because
these new contributions from other languages would not readily and
gracefully submit to them. Thus, instead of six declensions of nouns, a
in the Anglo Saxon, and several regular modes of forming the plural, our
present English has retained but one declension, only one inflection for
case, and but one regular mode of forming the plural. It shouldcl be
observed, however, that these are retained from the Anglo Saxon, - the
original basis of the language, -and not adopted from those language.
which have supplied us with so many new words.?1COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
142. This, that, these, those, former and latter, specify particular
objects, and are hence called demonslrative.
143. Some, other, another, one, any, all, such, both, none, few,
many much, several, &amp;c., do not specify particular objects, and are
honce called indefinite.
REMARK 1. Another is used only in the singular; and is tnus
declined, namely:
Nominative, another. Possessive, another's. Objective, another.
2. One and other are used as nouns in both numbers.
Nominative, one,     other,    Plural.  ones,     others,
Possessive, one's,   other's,     "     ones',    others',
Objective,  one.    other.        "     ones.     others.
EXAMPLES. The little ones' home. The nest was full of little ones.
I hear some one's footstep. A tear for others' woes. The great ones
of the land.
144. Each, every, either, and neither, indicate separately the
objects included in a -whole, and are hence called distributive.
REM.ARK. Every is never used as a noun.
145. Ours, yours, hers, theirs, mine, and thine, denote possession,
and partake of the nature of adjectives; hence called possessive.
REMARK 1. They are derived from the possessive case of the pelsonal pronouns, our, your, her, their, my, and thy.
2. Our, your, her, their, my, and thy, denote possession because
they are in the possessive case. Ours, yours, hers, theirs, mine, and
thline, denote possession by virtue of the meaning of the words.

These books are ours, and each of them        will please
the little ones at home.
This compound sentence contains two independent clauLses cnneeted by "and."
"Books," the subject of the first clause, is directly modified by
"these;" "ours" in the predicate denoting possession or ownership, not assumed, but asserted of "books."
"Each," representing book, and substituted for "' each book," is
the subject of the second clause, and is indirectly modified by the
phrase" of them"; the predicate, " will please," is directly modified by " ones," as the object of its action; "ones" is directly modified by the definite article'" the" and the descriptive adjective "little," and indirectly by the phrase " at home."
" These" is a demonstrative adjective pronoun, specifying and
pointing out some particular books, obviously present to the speaker
and those with him; plural form, used in the relation of an adjective, and limiting" books."
" Books" is a common noun, neuter, plural, third, nominative,
the subject of the verb " are "; and, if a personal pronoun were
substituted for it, it would be represented by " they," the nominative form.
"Are," the predicate, is a form of the irregular, intransitive
verb "be," Indicative inood, Present tense, and plural form, to agree
with its subject-nominative " books" in number.
"Ours" is a possessive adjective pronoun, in the predicate, directly limiting " are," and referring to the subject.
" Each" is a distributive pronoun, used in the relation of a noun,
singular,nominative, and subject of the verb "will please."
"Them" is a personal pronoun) substituted for the word "books,"
and representing it in nutimber and person; it has the special form
appropriated to the third, plural, and objective.
"Will please," used to assert, is a regular, transitive verb;
please, pleased, pleased; and has "' ones'" for its direct object. Simple Active form; Indicative mood, Future tense; it simply declares a
future action. Not varied by the person and numubeor of its sul

10'2103
COMMON SCHOOL GRAMMAR.'REMATAK 1. As the anteceldent stands in one of the connected
cl.uses, and its substitute in the other, the relative can be used only
in compound sentences.
2. Thus the relative performes the office of a noun for which it is
substituted; and of a conjunction, in joining clauses.    The whole
reli/tivs lause directly modifies the antecedent or word for which the
relative is sul)stituted, just as an adjective modifies a noun; and is,
t lleiefor ~, called an ad(jective clause.
147. The simnple relatives are who, which, and that; and aro
ilthus declined, being the saLie in botlh numnbers:
Nominative, who,      which,      that,
Possessive,  whose,    whose,
Objective,   whom.     which.      that.
NOTE.  VIrhose as possessive of which; as, This is the question, whose solution I require - the solution of which I require.
REM1lKz 1. Who is used to represent persons; which, other ob.
jects; as, I knew the man wvho w-as rescued. IHere is the sled which
George wanted.
2. That is used, in place of who or wthich, to represent either persons or things; as, I knew the man that was rescued.    Hlere is the
sled that George wanted.
3. After the word samie, or after an adjective in the superlative
degree, tlhat is preferable to wtho or which; also, after the interrogatie "  ho," and after an antecedent consisting of both persons and
things; as, This is the same person that we saw yesterday.     Cicero
was the most finished orator that Rome produced.    Whlo is the person that saw it?  Here are the boy and sled that we saw yesterday.

We," the su)ject of' the main or leading clause, is not modified''folund,'' the predicate, is limited by a word shlowing when " we
found," and by anotbher word showing what we found. As the adjective clause modifies "  (boy," "soon found a boy who was eager to
go" is the modified predicate of the senitence.
Who," substituted for "boy," and representing it in person
and number, is the sublject of the adjective clau.se; and "was," the
grammatical predicate, asserts the quality of. eagerness, which is limited by the phrase "to go," restricting the boy's eagerness to this
one action;' eager" is an adjective in the predicate limiting
"was," and referring to its sublject.
"Who" is a relative pronoun, relating to "boy" for its antecedent, and agreeing with it in number and person; consequently third
person, singular; and it has the foJrm appropriated to the nominative, being the subject of" was," and thus used in the relation of a
noun; it also cornnects the two clauses, performing the office of a
conjunction.

148. What, whatever, whatsoever, whoever, whosoever, whoseso
ever, whomsoever, whichever, and whichsoever, contain both the
antecedent and relative, and constitute a part of each of the two
clauses they connect.
REMARK 1. "What       that or those which; as, "I saw what
he had "; that is, "I saw that uhich he had."  "Whoever "= he
who; as, "Whoever will may come "; that is, "He may come who
will."
2. Pronouns thlus compounded are called Compound Relative Pronouns. What and its compounds, also whichever and whichsoever, are
sometimes used as adjective pronouns.
MODEL.
I saw in a store what will answer your purpose.
The sentence consists of two clauses, connected by the prononi
"what," which serves to make a part of each, being equivalent to
that which; as, I saw that which will answer. Thus it limits the
predicate of the first clause, being the direct olject of its action, and
is at the same time the subject of the second clause.
" I " is the subject unmodified; and "saw," the predicate, is indirectly limited by the phrase "in a store," modifying it as an adverb
of place; it is also directly modified by " what," as its object
Thus, "saw in a store what will answer your purpose" is thv
modified predicate of the sentence.
"Will answer," the predicate of the dependent clause, is directly
modified by " purpose," limiting its action to a definite object; ana
"purpose" is limnited by" your," telling whose "purpose."  Thus,' will answer your purpose" is the modified predicate of the clauLse.
The adjective clause, " which will answer your purpose," directly
modifies "that," the antecedent - as is apparent when "what" is
resolved into two parts to show its relative situation in each clause.
"What" is a pronoun, includinyg the antecedent anld the relative,
used commonly where the antecedent is indefinite or general; it s in
the objective case, as the direct object of the transitive verb'" saw";

Ja8t.
REMARK 1. Adverbs are generally substituttes for longer modifying

&amp;c. As soon as, as well as, &amp;c., are connecting phrases, generally
denoting comparison.
3. When the adjective ends in " ly," another " ly" cannot wel
be added; thus a phrase becomes necessary; as, in a lively manner
instead of livelily.
4. Logically, adverbs may be divided into the following classes
Many subdivisions might be made, but such distinctions would be of
little use etymologically, and may be disregarded in parsing:
5. Time. Now, then, when, soon, lately, hereafter, always, never,
often, seldom, before, already, &amp;c.
6. Place. Here, there, where, elsewhere, up, down, away, forward, below, within, whence, thither, &amp;c.
7. Manner. Well, diligently, thoroughly, wisely, thus, so, easily,
truly, first, secondly, thirdly, next, &amp;c.

18. Namely, or to wit, usually represented by viz., embraces what
follows in the sentence.
NOTE. These last four are generally used independen?tly, and are not parsed
as modlifyinig particular words.
19 Some adverbs are formed by the union of two or more words:
as, indeed  zn and deed; wherewith     where and with; herein
=here and in; whereby = where and by; sometimes=some and
times; wherein = where and in; nevertheless = never and the and
less; whereunto =where and unto.
151. Adverbs used      in asking questions are called
interrogative   adverbs;    as, Why?      when?     whither?
whence? how? where? wherefore?
REMARK. There is often used without reference to its meaning;
as, There is little hope of escape.  There, was a frost this morning.
In such cases it is a mere expletive, and may be called an introductory adverb, used for euphony, that the verb may precede its subject
smoothly.  It regards the sound and not the sense of the sentence.
152. Some adverbs may be compared; as, Soon,
sooner, soonest; often, oftener, oftenest; least wisely,
less wisely, wisely, more wisely, most wisely.
153. A few are compared irregularly; as, Well, better,best; illor badly,worse, worst; much,more, most;
far, farther or further, farthest or furthest.

young."    Ilere " wAheni" =   at the tine in which. it denotes identity of timne betwveen      the assertions in the
two clfauses.
REMIARK 1. " AVWhen father retLurnied, lic gave me a book."  tlere'when" denotes identity of time between thc two actions. Therefore, " lwhenI " not only connects the two clauses, but also shows the
rclation of timie.
2. The whole adverbial clause, " when father returned," modifies
the predicate of the independenit clause, as an adclverb of time. So,
too, in the first example, the adverbial clause is an adverb of time,
modifying the predicate of thle independent clause.
3. Thus, " where "--the place in which; that is, the relation it
shows between two clauses connected by it is identity of place.
"IIow " = the mnanner in which; before = at a time precediny that in
wfiich; thlat is, it marks priority of time. "After" denotes subsequeni

PREPOSITIONS.
155. PREPOSITIONS are used        to  connect words, and
show the relation between them; as, Charles went
from   New York      to Baltimore.      Wealthy men should
give libe-   iy =  Men of wealth should give with liber
ality.
112COAMMON-SCHOOL G(RAMMAR.1
NOTE'. A noun or pronoun indirectly modifies another word, by means of
the connecting preposition expressed or implied, and the case-relation of the
modifying word is thus shown to be objective.
REMARK. The preposition is used chiefly before nouns and their
substitutes, connecting them with the words to which they stand in
the relation of modifiers, as adjectives or adverbs; as, Men of wea!th
should give with liberality.  Here the phrases, "of wealth "  
wealthy, and "with liberality "= liberally  this performing the
office of an adverb, -that, of an adjective.
NOTE. Generally, when phrases beginning with prepositions limit verbs,
they are adverbial; when they limit nouns, they are adjective phrases.

on, over, past, regarding, respecting, round, save, since, through,
throughout, till, to, touching, toward, towards, inder, underneath,
until, unto, up, upon, with, within, without.
REMARK 1. The above words are generally used as prepositions,
and take after them the objective case of a noun or pronoun, used as
a modifving term; but, when they are used without the modifying
term of relation, they are commonly parsed as adverbs.
2. But, meaning except, is a preposition; meaning only, it is an
adverb; otherwise used, it is a conjunction.
3. Save and except may be parsed as verbs, but are generally regarded as prepositions.
4. Concerning, excepting, regarding, and touching, have ceased to
be considered as participles, being classed as prepositions merely.
5. The adverb out, and the preposition of, used together, form
what may be called a compound preposition. So, also, the participle
according and to; over against, from above, fiom beneath, from beyond, from between, from off, from within, from without, &amp;c., may
be classed thuLs. But all may be sepalated in construction, by sup

tion under a condition expressed in a subjoined clause; the other denying the condition supposed in the former incialeer for the sake of
arg mient.
The dependent clause, " we fail," is connected with the indepen.
dent clause, "it can be no worse for us," by "if," which always
connects the subordinate clause in which it stands with some ot.her.
The other independent proposition," we shall not fail," is connected with the first member of the sentence by" but," expreo?ing
conrast or opposition.
"We," representing the speaker and those with him, is the ~ubl
ject, unmodified, of the subjunctive clause, and "fail" is the unmodified predicate.
"It," representing the supposition contained in the subjoined
clause, is the subject of the leading clause; "can be," the predicate,
is limited by "worse," an adjective in the predicate, whereby its
quality is asserted of the subject; aind" worse" is directly modified
oy the adverb " no," and indirectly by the phrase " for us."
"We" is the subject of the last independent clause, and "shall
fail" is the predicate, modified by "not," giving it a negative
meaning.
"If" is a conjunction, used only to connect a subjunctive clause to
some other; thus, "fail," the predicate of this clause, is said to be
in the Subjunctive mood.
"Can be" is here used, by means of the auxiliary " can," to
declare possibility or power of its subject.
"Shlall fail" is a simple declaration in the futture, negatived by
the adverb "not."
"But" is a conjunction, used only with clauses, and here connecting the two independent or co6rdinate clauses.

INTRODUCTION TO SYNTAX.
As there is a syntax of words, troating of their offices and rela
i.)ns, as arranged in sentences, so there is a syntax of clauses and
phrases
A perfect system of analysis imust recognize verbal, phrasal and
tausal syntax.
Now, these several kinds of syntax are not alwatys distinct; nor
is an analysis founded on either of them alone, complete.  What id
commonly called parsing, that is, verbal analysis, is often defective,
or impossible, if not combined with phrasal and clausal analysis.
Look, for example, at the following sentence: " A gentle dalesman lies almost at the root of that tall pine." Technical parsing
takes no notice of the fact that " at the root" is an adverb, modify
ing " lies," or that " of that tall pine" is an adjective, modifying
"root."
In this respect it is defective, and, in consequence of this defect,
it fails, also, in its own sphere, and is obliged to violate its own
rules by parsing " almost" as mlodifying a preposition. "Almost"
cannot be parsed consistently with the definitions and rules of grammar, without recognizing the adverbial power of the phrase " at the
root.'
The question, therefore, of the relative irmportance of parsing and
analysis, which some have raised, cannot be entertained; since each
is necessary to the other, and both to the comnpleteness of the analysis. Besides, some of the rules of syntax - to be applied in parsing -presuppose analysis; and others can be vindicated only by
recognizing the principles of phrasal and clausal analysis.
In resolving a sentence into its elements, the order, so far as possible, should be from the general to the particular; that is, from
clausal thr,ugh phrasal, to verbal.
120t RMMON-SCCHOOL GRAMMAR.

The subject of a finite       verb  is in tbhe nolninativo
case; as, The boy studies.       He will learn.
NOTE. A verb is finite when it is limited by number and person.
MODEL.
The boy studies, and he will learn.
This sentence is compound, consisting of two propositions. Each
assertion may stanitd alone, and make complete sense by itself. Otherwise connected, the latter clause might be a consequent of the former;
as, The boy studies; therefore he will learn.  Or, The boy will learn,
because he studies.
The conjunbtion "and," connecting the two clauses as independent
propositions, merely expresses addition.
"Boy," the grammatical subject of the first clause, is limited by
the definite article "the,"' denoting some particular boy before the
eye or the mind, and thus made sufficiently obvious to the hearer or
reader. Hence " the boy" is the modified subject.
"StuLdies" is the predicate of the first clause, and "will learn'
of the second. As neither predicate is modified, the assertion in
each clause is unlimited and general.  " He," thle subject of the
wcond clause, represents" boy," and is not modified.
"Boy" is a noun, because it is the name of an object; a common
noun, because it is the name of any one of a class; of the masculine
gender, because it denotes a male being; of the singular number, be,
cause it denotes only one; of the third person, because it represents
the object named as spoken of; in the nominative case, because it is
the subject of the finite verb " studies," here used to assert some
thing of the person denoted by the word " boy."
"4 He" is a pronoun, because it is substituted for a noun; per
sonal, because its form shows of what person it is; it has th.

elore are two propositions, each assuvting a distinct fact, and yet
so connected by the clausal conjunction " that," showing tlie relation of etIuse and effect between them, as to niake the former assertion a consequent on'the fiact stated in the latter; that is, a result
of1 tlhe cause specified in that proposition.
Of these clauses " I " and "teacher" are the subjects; "am"
and "is respected" the predicates.  "Glad" an adjective in the
predicate refers to the subject "1 "; and thus the quality of gladness is not assumed of the subject, but is asserted of it.
" The" is a definite article, limiting, " teachler " to some particulai
one before the mind or eye; and "the teacher" is the modified
subject.
"Is respected," the predicate, is limited by the phrase "by hit
pupils"; and " is respected by his pupils" is the modified predicate.
" Pupils" is limited by the pronoun" his," representing "teacher."
The predicate "is respected" would be heire used in a general and
indefinite manner, unless restricted by the phrase " by his pupils.'
This phrase modifies the general meaning, and limits to a definite
class the respect shown to the teacher.
" Am" is a verb, because it is used to assert.  Principal parts,
Present "be" or " am," Past " was," Perfect Participle " been ",
irregular, because its past tense and perfect participle are not formed
by the addition of d or ed to the present or simple form; intransitive, because it does not take a word after it in the objective case, as
the direct object of the verb; Indicative mood, because it simply declares; Present tense, because it represents the being as incomplete and asserted in present time; this verb alone has a special
form1 appropri'ated to the singular number and first person, and it

HIere" Ifarmer "is thle subject; and " lost," the predicate, is directly
modified by the objective plhrases " his best horse" and' thLree cows.'

phrase " three cows " to the phrase" his best horse," as they have
a common dependence, being direct objects of the transitive verb
lost."
This may be ftrther seen by suLpplying the ellipsis and making
two clauses; as, "The flirmer lost his best horse, and the fiarmer lost
three cows."  Thus the two connected phrases have a commnon dependence or relation.
l'Best" is an adjective; positiveyood, comparative better, superlative
best; irregularly compared, is in the superlative degree, because it
expresses the highest degree of goodness compared with his other
horses, and modifies " horse," restricting in quality, and excluding
all his other horses.
Three" is an adjective; numneral, because it denotes number; cardinal, denotes hlow imany; and limits thle no)un " cows" in number,
but in no other respect. Numerals cannot be eompared

PARTS OF SPEECH.
Although there are miany thlousand words in the Englislh anguage, they are usually distributed into a few classes, called parts of
speech.
14. The subject of a sentence is the NAME of that of which something is said or asserted.
15. The iname of a person or thing is called a NOUN;
as, Boys play.
REMARK. The word "thing" is here used to include not only any object
that canl be perceived by the senses; but whatever may be made an object of
thought.
EXERCISES.
Girls study.    Ice melts.   Water freezes.     William   reads.
Hope cheers.    Virtue will be rewarded.    Soldiers m-arch.  Dogs
bark. Grass grows. Ships sail.
What is the subject of the first sentence? Of what is it the name? What
part of speech is it? Why?
DIRECTION. Alsk similar questions on each of the above exercises. The teache7
can extend this exercise, and all that follow, indefinitely, by aid of the blackboard,
slate, or reading-book, till pupils can readily recoynize the noun.
Supply a nounfor each of the following predicates.
fly.    -  drink.     -run.       -   studies.  --    live.
walk.         grow.         eat.   -     swim.      -   ride.
16. The predicate of a sentence is the word which is used to say
or assert something of the subject.
17. A   word which      can  be used to     assert is called a
VERB; as, Boys play.
What is the subject of a sentence? What is a noun? What is the predicate of a sen

tI ired  is limited by "carriage," as the d(lirect ol}cct of its
action, and' Ihired a carriage" is therefore the miodified predic:a te.
"Rode " is indirectly modified by the phrase " for an hour," limiting the action as to time; and "rode for an hour" is the modified
predicate.
"The " is a definite article, and limits the noun "man" to some
particular mar,, before spoken of or pointed out.
" A" is an ndefinite article, and limits the noun" carriage" indefinitely, without specifying any particular carriage.
"An" is an indefinite article, and limits the noun " hour" to one,
but indefinitely to any one. "An" is used instead of a, because it
comIes before a vowel sound; as h is silent.

Adverbs directly modify verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; as, A very good man will not always act very
prudently.

MODEL.
The boy recites exceedingly twell, because he has
acquired very studious habits.
These two clauses are planed in the relation to each other of cause
anid effect; the last clause assigning a reason for the fact,.serted in
thle first.
They are connected by the causal conjunction because; this conjirnction generally follows the effect and precedes the cause, and connects clauses only,
" Boy" is the subject of one clause, and "he," of the other.' Recites" is the grammatical predicate of one, and" has acquired,"
of the other.
"Recites exceedingly well" is the modified predicate of the first,
and "has acquired very studious habits" is the modified predicate
of the last.
" The" limits " boy" to a definite individual, and " the boy" is
the modified subject.  "Very studious habits" is a phrase, directly
modifying "acquired."
"' Exceedingly" is an adverb, and modifies the adverb "well,"
iiereasing its force, showing how "well."  Thus, if the question be
asked, how well did the boy recite? the answer would be "exceedingly well."
Well is an adverb, irregularly compared; well, better, best; inthe
positive form, but increased in degree by the adverb "exceedingly,"
which modifies it.
"Well" modifies the verb "recites," showing the manner an
which " the boy recites."
"Very" is an adverb, and modifies the adjective "stadious,'
increasing it in degree.

RULE VI.
Prepositions require the objective ease after them;
as, John gave the book to me.
NOTE 1. The modifying term of a relation shown by a preposition is in
the ojbjective case; as, George went to Jerusalem. It was sent to him by me.
2. A noun or pronoun connected with another word by a preposition indi
rectly modifies it, constituting withi the preposition a phrase.
ASODEL.
John sent the book by me, and I shall deliver it for
him  soon.
"John" and "I " are the subjects;' sent" and "shall deliver,'
the predicates.
"Sent" is modified directly by the abject "book," and indirectly
by the phrase " by me"; so that "sent the book by me " is the
modified predicate of the first clause.
"Shall deliver" is directly limited by "it" as the object of its
action; also by "soon," showing the nearness of the time of the
uture action predicated of the subject "I."  It is indirectly limited
by the phrase "for him."
"Me" is a personal pronoun, having a peculiar form to express
the person it represents. First person, as it stands for the speaker.
It is never varied in fo in on account of gender, as the first person is
Dresumed to be present, and the sex known. Singular, denoting but

It has the special form for the objective case, and indirectly modifies
" sent," with which it is connected by the preposition " by," showing the relation between "me," the modifying term, and the word
" sent.''
"Him" is a pronoun, and represents "John "; personal, because
it has an appropriate form to represent the person of the noun for
which it stands; it has the form of the third person, singular
number, and mtasculine gender, because "John," its antecedent,
is masculine, singular, third; the special form for the objective
case, and is connected with " shall deliver," which it indirectly
modifies, by the preposition "for," requiring the case-relation to be
objective.

" Father" aind" vwe" are the subjects unmodified; "called" and' obeyed," the grammatical predicates.
Called" is directly limited by "us" as the object of its action,
restricting the "call" to the persons represented by the pronoun
"us"; and "called us" is the modified predicate.
"Obeyed" is directly limited by" him" as the object of its action, thus restricting our obedience to one person, represented by
"him "; and "obeyed him" is the modified predicate.
"Us" is a personal pronoun, representing as a company the
speaker and those wvith him at the time of the call, and thierefore of
the first person; not varied to represent sex,- the persons, denoted by
the word for wlhich it is substituted, may be males or females witlhout afibeting its formn; plural, more than one. It has the special

the action of the transitive verb " called."
"Him" is a personal pronoun, substituted for the noun " ather,"
and representing it in number, person, and gender, being in form,
third, singular, masculine. It has the special form appropriated to

MODEL.
The lb.y's book was found, but its leaves had been
sadly torn.
This sentence contains two propositions, connected by the conjunction " but," expressing contrast between the present condition
of the book aind its fbrmuer appcarance.
"Book" is the gaimmatical subject of the first clause, and
" leaves" of the other.
" Book" is directly limited by "boy's," denoting the owner, and
"boy's" by" the," denoting a "definite" boy; and "the boy's
book" is the modified subject.
" Leaves" is directly limited by " its," denoting the possessor;
as, the " book's leaves "; therefore "its leaves" is the modified
subject.
"I Was found" is the predicate of the first clause, and is not
modified.
"Had been torn," the predicate of the second clause, is directly
modified by " sadly," describing the maanner of the action; thus,
"had been sadly torn" is the modified predicate.
" Boy's" is a noun, because it is a name; common, because it ap
plies to any one of a class; masculine gender, denoting a male being;
singular, denoting only one; third person, spoken of; in thle form
appropriated to the possessive case, denoting ownership, and directly
limiting the noun "book," the name of the object possessed.
"Its" is a personal pronoun, and has the form appropriated to
the third person, singular, masculine, to agree in these respects

Washington is called thefather of his country.
This is a simple sentence. " Washington" is the subject; " is

country," the modified predicate.
" Father" is limited by "the," and indirectly by the phrase " of
his country "; and " country " is directly limited by " his."
" Is called" is a passive verb, and "Washington," its subject,
is in the re -ninative case; therefore, " father," denoting the same
personr. as "$Vashington," is in the nominative case after the verb.
" Father "' is a common noun, applied to any one of a class; mas,

RULE XII.
A noun, joined with a participle, an(d nlot connected
in construction with the rest of the sentence, is used
independently in the nominative case; as, Shamne being
lost, all virtue is lost.
MIODEL.
No precious fate with mine involved, my heart is
fearless, firm my step.
This is a comnpound sentence, consisting of two distinct independent clauses, and one not in the form of an assertion, but rather
of an assuniption, consisting of a noun and a participle, each of which
is modified, and which might be the subject and predicate of a dependent clause if expanded.
"Heart" is the subject, and "my heart " the modified subject, of
the first independent clause; "is," the predicate, is modified by
"fearless," an adjective in the predicate; thus the quality of
fearlessness is asserted as belonging to the subject; and "is fearless" is the modified predicate.
Of the other independent clause, " step" is the subject, and " my
step " the modified subject; "is," implied, is the predicate, and "'  
firm" the modified predicate, asserling firmness of its subject.
The undeveloped clause, containing an assumed f:act, equivalent uo
when no precious fate is involved with mine," or "if no precious
fate," &amp;c., when expanded into a full clause, would be dependent as
connected with the others, having "fate" for its subject, and "is
involved" for its predicate.
This differs from a clause, only in not containing a grammatical
predicate; it is in meaning equivalent to a dependent clause, though
not in grammatical structure.
"Fate" is a noun, name of an object; common, applying to Dany
one of the class; third person, spoken of; neuter gender, name of
neither a male nor a female being; singular number, denoting only
one object; nominative case, and used independently with tle ir1aper.

MIODEL.
Alas! the remedy came too late.
The full clause hlas for its subject " remnedy "; its grammatical
predicate is " came," and its modified p)redicate, " came too late."
The word " alas," whlich is equivalent to a clause, is here used to
express regret'; " alas" "  I am sorry that, or I regret that. 1tere it

connection, lhowever, is only in meaning, not in construction.

Having a desire to learn, John endeavored to study.
" John," the subject of this simple sentence, is directly modified by
the participial phrase "having a desire to learn"; and "endeavored,"
the predicate, indirectly by the infinitive phrase "to study."
The phrase "to learn" limits "desire."
" Desire" directly limits "having," which, in the relation of an adjective, refers to "John "; so that "John having a desire to learn"
is the modified subject; and "endeavored to study," the rmodified
predicate.
"Learn" is a verb as it can be used to assert. Present learn,
past learned, perfect participle learned. It can be transitive or intransitive; here used without a definite object, and in sense intransitive.
It has no subject-nominative, and is preceded by "to," in the infinitive mood, present, and modifies "desire,"
"Study" is a verb, for it can be used to assert; regular -study,
studied, studied; intransitive, though it is sometimes transitive; in
the infinitive mood, present, and limits "endeavored," denoting the
purpose of his endeavors or efforts.

IMODEL,'The temperate man's pleasures are durable, for they are
regular; and all his life is calm  and serene, becavse it is
iilnocent.
This sentence is divided into two members by the semicolon, and
they are connected by the conjunction "and."
Each member contains two clauses, connected by the causal conjunctions "for" and "because."
The first clause in each member is independent, and contains the
proposition for which a reason is given in the second clause.
"Pleasures" and "life" are the grammatical, and " the temperate
man's pleasures" and "all his life" are the modified subjects of the
two independent clauses; "are durable" and "is calm and serene"
are the modified predicates of the same.
In the two dependent clautses, "they," representing "pleasures,"
and "it," representing " life," are the subjects unmodified; "are"
and "is" are the grammatical predicates; and "are regular" and "is
innocent," the modified predicates.
Foa is a conjunetion, and connects the clause that assigns a reason,
with the independent clause that contains the assertion.
AND is a conjunction, and unites the twro independent clauses.
"Calm" andl "serene," adjectives having a common dependence,
are connected by "and."
By supplying the ellipsis in this case, as in most cases, the conjunetion " and" may be made to connect clauses; as, "Alf his life is calm,
and all his life is serene." It is better to parse without supplying the
ellipsis.
BECAUSE is a conjunction, connecting the clause that contains the
cause, with the independent clause that asserts the effect.

The teacher who is qualified for his office, is a blessing

This is a compound sentence, consisting of two clauses; one independent, the other relative.
"Teacher," the subject of the independent clause, is limnited by the
article " the," and by the relative clause, which is here restrictive, and
used as an adjective to modify "teacher."
"Is a blessing to the community" is the modified predicate of the
independent clause, and "blessing," the noun in the predicate, is modified by the phrase "to the community."
"W;ho" is the grammatical subject of the adjec ive clauLse; "is

the modified predicate.
WHo is a relative pronoun, relating to "teacher" for its antecedent;
it must be of the same person anld number as the nloun which it represents; therefore it is third, singular. It is nominative in formn, because it is the subject of the verb " is qualified."  It connects the

ILLUSTRATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS
IN ARRANGEMENT AND CONSTRUCTION.
RULE I.
The subject of a finite verb is in the nominative case;
as, The boy studies.     He will learil.
NOTE 1. Like the Latin construction of an accusative before the infinitive
mood, an objective case is often used in English before the infinitive, in
sucn a relation, that it might be the subject of a clause, if the infinitive were
changed into another mood, so as to become a predicate of the same clause;
as, I kInow him to be a good man = I know that he is a good man.
2. The objective case of a noun or pronoun thuLs placed before the infinitive
of an intransitive or passive verb, requires the noun or pronoun after it, having
the same meaning, to be in the same case; as, I know him to be a good man.
REMARK 1. The subject may be a noun, pronoun, phrase, or clause.
Phrases: To see, or to see the sun, or for me to see the sun, is
pleasant.
Clauses: That you understand me, or that you understand what I
have said, is evident.
2. The subject of a verb in the imperative mood, being of the second person, and thus sufficiently obvious, is generally omitted; as,

MIODEL.
Give thly youthl to study, sin,ce to discipline the mind
increases its vigor.
This comnpound sentence has two clauses, conniected by the conjunction "since."  The first clause may be considered a comnuand, exhortation, or direction; and the reason or motive is assigned in the last.
"Give," the predicate of the first, is in the imperative mood; its subject, thou, being of the second person, is understood. " Give" is directly
modified by  "youth," and indirectly by the phrase "to study."
"Youth" is modified by "thy," representing the person addressed.
Thus, "Give thy youth to study" is the modified predicate.
"Increases," the predicate of the last clause, is modified by "vigor,"
its direct object, in the objective. "Vigor" is modified by " its," representing "mind." Thus, "increases its vigor" is the modified predicate.
Now, if the question be asked, "What increases its vigor? " the answer will be, " To disciplinie the mind."'I'herefore the phlrase "to discipline the mind" is the subject of the clause.
The phrase is composed of "to discipline," a verb in the infinitive
mood, and its direct object, "mind," which is limited by the definite
article "the."
"To discipline" is a verb, because it can be used to assert; re~2ular, b1)ecause its past tense and perfect participle are formed( by adding
d to the simple form; transitive, because it takes an object, "mind,"
to receive its action; simple activeform, therefore the noun representing the object of its action is in the objective case; infinitive mnood,
because it is used without a subject-nomninative, and is preceded
by "to."
It constitutes with its object, "the mind," a phrase, and is here used
in the relation of a noun. Thus the phrase, " to discipline the mind,"
is the subject of the verb "increases."
A phrase used as a noun is always third, sinfgular, and represented
by the pronouin " it."
"Thy" is a personal pronoun, representing the person to'wihom the
sentence is addressed; second, singular, possessive case, and limits
" youth."COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
"Its" is a persoilal pronoun, substituted for " mind "; third, singular, neuter, possessive (wl'y?), and linits " vigor."
"Youth," " mind," and " vigor" are nouns, each third, singular, neuter, objective (why?), and are the objects of the transitive verbs "give,"
discipline," and "increases," respectively.
Study" is a noun, third, singular, neuter (why?), objective case
after the preposition "to," thus indirectly limiting "give."
" The" is a definite article, and limits " mind."  " To" is a preposition, showing a relation between "give" and " study," and thus coInniecting, ill such modifying relation, "study" with  give."
" Give" is a verb; irregular, transitive, imperative, second persoln,
singular (why?); it has for its subject " thou" implied.
"Increases" is a verb; regular, transitive, indicative, present (why?);
it has the special form of the third, singular, as it is varied in this tense
on account of person and numnber; and has for its subject the substantive phrase.

ARRANGEMENT.
1. The subject naturally precedes the verb; as, John runs. But it is
placed after the simple verb, or some part of a compound verb, in interrogative sentences; as, Lives there the man? &amp;c. Has he left the city?
Except wvhen one of the principal parts is an interrogative pronoun; as,
Who saw him do it?
2. Also in subjunctive clauses, if the conjunction implying a condition is not expressed; as, Were there no other ground, this alone would
be sufficient.  Should I conclude to go, I will call for you. If there
were. If I should.
3. After the introductory adverb there, whether used as an expletive
nr not; as, There was scarcely a dry eye in the Senate. He iooked
behind him, - there was the historic man; he looked before him,there was the living man, &amp;c.
4. After a few other adverbs when they begin a clause; as, Then
rose the shout. Well may posterity be grateful to his memory.
5. Often too by the poets and other animated writers; as, Back
comes the chief in triumph. From the ground below comes up the
laugh of children.
NOTE. The poet uses this arrangement chiefly for rhythm; the speaker for

RULE II.
A  verb  agrees   witlt its sulbject nominative in number and person; as, I am, he was loved.  
REMARK 1. When two or more singular nominatives, denloting different objects, ill forming a compound subject, are so connected, that
the assertion is made of them jointly, the verb is generally plural, and
also the pronouns that represent them; as, Village, hamlet, and metropolis alike resound with acclamations.
ExcrurTION. Sometimes, when the verb precedes, it is singular, being understood before each other one of the series; as, There was silence, gladness, and
sorrow, and but little sleep in Moss Side, between the rising and setting of
the stars, &amp;c.
2. If the nominatives denote the same object, the verb is generally
singular; so, too, the pronoun that represents them; as, A great man
and an eminent statesman has departed, and his loss will be widely felt.
3. When the singular nouns, connected by "and" have each, every,
or no limiting them, the verb is singular, and the pronoun representing
them is singular; as, Each man and boy was earnest for his share.
4. When the addition is made by "with" instead of" and," the verb
is siingular; as, The ship, with her crew, was destroyed. If "and" be
put in the place of "with," the verb must be made plural; as, The ship
and her crew were destroyed.
155156                COMAIMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
5. When two or more singular nominatives, forming a compounldt
subject, are considered separately, so that the assertion is made of any
one of them, but only of one, the verb is generally singular, and the
pronoun must be singular; as, The Egyptian mummies, which Cambyses or Time hath spared, avarice now consumeth.
6. But when either of the nominatives is plural, the verb is generally placed nearest to it, and is plural; as, Neither the man nor his
neighbors were present.
7. If the nominatives constituting a compound subject are of different l)persons, the verb agrees with the one immediately preceding it,
which should be the first in preference to the second or third, and the
second in preference to the third; as, You or I am mistaken. John
or thou art in fault.
NOTE. Where euphony requires it, a verb may be expressed for each nominative, when the compound subject consists of di2ierent persons, or even of different
numbers; or the construction may be otherwise varied; as, You ctare mistaken
or I am. John is in fault or thou art.
8. When the subject is a collective noun, the verb agreeinlg with it
and the pronoun representing it are singular or plural, as the noun
conveys unity or plurality of idea; as, But where, thought I, are the
crew?   Th7ey have gone down amidst the roar of the tempest. The
crew wvas lost with the ship.
9. The verb is frequently omitted.
1st. In answer to a question; as, Who brought this book?  John.
That is, John brought it.
2d. After than or as; as, We have had as many opportunities as
they, (have had.)  John is wiser than I, (am,) but I am more industrious than he, (is.)
MODEL.
Neither you nor I am        in the wrong; if James, William, and Heniry do assert tllat we are.
The first clause is independent, and contains a negative proposition.
The second clause is subordinate to the first, depending on it, and;onnected with it by the conjunction "if," so that the subjunctiveCOMMON-SCHOOL GRAMIAR.
clause expresses a suplposition or condition, in despite of which the denial is made in the leading ciause.
Ihe objective clause " we are," meaning "we are in fault," is connected with the subjui.ctive clause by the conjunction "that," and, mLn
the relation of a direct object, limits the transitive verb " do assert."
"      m" is mnodified by the phrase "in the wrong."  "You nor I" is
the compound sub)ject of the first clause, but the two parts are so connected that they are considered separately, so that the denial is made
of each by itself, anid not of the two jointly; while the correllative
"neither" is used merely to strengthenl the negation.'Am in the
wroniig" is the modified predicate.
" James, William, and Henry," connected by "and," implied in one
case and expressed in the other, jointly considered, form the compound
subject of the subjoined clause.
"1)o assert," the predicate, is directly limited by the object of its action, the objective clause, "that we are."  "We " is the subject, and
" are" thie predicate of the substantive clause.
"Am" is an irregular, intransitive verb, indicative, present (why?),
first person singular, having the peculiar form  appropriated to thfat
person and number to agree in those respects with " I," that part of
the compound subject placed nearest to it; as the first person is preferred to the second, where both are used, and the first should be nearest to the verb.
The verb is singuttlar, because it does not agree with the two parts
of the compounld subject taken together jointly, but separately, each
by itself.
" Do assert" is a regular, transitive verb, emphatic form, indicative,
present, third person (why?), plural number, because the parts of its
compound subject, though each is singular, are connected by "and"
expressed or implied, and therefore are used jointly, requiring the plural form of the verb.
EXERCISES.
DInECTION. In all the exercises, always give a written or oral analysis of eeach selntence,
clausal, phrasal, and verbal, before parsing the words separately. Parse the noninatives,
telling the compound subjects, in the following sentences, and whether they have a sing ular
or plural verb and pronoun, and why

No state chlicantery, no narrow system of vicious politics, no idle

RULE III.
Adjectives directly limit nouns and their substitutes;
as, Good men, Seven men, They are happy.
NOTE. Adjective pronouns and participles also limit nouns and their substi,
tutes, when not themselves used as nouns.
I158COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
159
REMARK 1. Adjectives and adjective pronouns implying unity belong to singular nouns; and, implying plurality, to plural nouns; as,
one man, two men, many men, all men; this man, these men; any man,
any men.
NOTE 1. " Pure air is the life of a school room." Here the quality of purity
is taken or assumed as belonging to air. But in the sentence, " The air is
pure,"purity is asser-ted as belonging to the air. In each case the adjective'pure" refers to "air;" but in the latter case it is an adjective in the predicate, and its quality is asserted of the subject rather than assumed.
2. As participles, adjectives, verbs in the infinitive mood, phrases, clauses,
and compound sentences, may be used as nouns, all such may have adjectives
referring to them as in the following; viz., to see is pleasant; to see the sun is
pleasant; for one to see the sun is pleasant; that one should see the sunes is pleasant; that one should see the sun when he irst rtses is pleasant; seeing is pleasant; seeing the sun is pleasant; seeing the suns rise is pleasant; the benevolent
are happy; doing well is better than wishing to do well; runninzg is delightful;
sunningfast is tiresome.
3. In the sentence, "to be good is essential to happiness," the adjective
essential" belongs to the phrase "to be good," here used as the subject of the
sentence; and the adjective "good," a part of the phrase, limits the verb "to
be." The phrase expresses an abstract quality indefinitely, and is equivalent
to, Goodness is essential to happiness.
4. So too in the sentences, "His being cals was essential -to the success of
the surgical operation," and "His having beens calm was worthy of praise," each
of the two subject.phrases has an adjective in the predicate referring to it. The
adjectives calm limit in the one "being; " and in the other "having been;"
constituting respectively in each a part of the phrase. This is better than awkwardly supplying an ellipsis, where the adjective is used-indefinitely, without
reference to any noun.
2. An adjective used without a noun abstractly, with the infinitive
or p)articiple of "be," "become," or a similar verb, may be parsed as
limiting it.
3. Nouns used to express the quality of other nouns, especially the
substance of which any thing is made, become adcljectives, though sometimes by an additional syllable; as, an iron chain, a gold chain, a golden link, a wooden box, an oak chair, an oaken chest.
4. All, denoting quantity, is used with a singular noun; denoting
number, with a plural one; as, all hope has fled, all men should worship God.16  INTRODUCTION TO CO31MO/NSCH. 0I, GRAMMAR.
3. In the third example, wlhat word tells how " boys recite"? WhA part of
speech is it? Why? What part of speech does it modify? What part of
speech is "studious "? What noun does it describe? What word increases
the force of " studious"? What is it called?  Why? What part of speech
does it modify?
4. In thefourth example, what word tells how " men should give"? What
part of speech is it? Why? What part of speech does it modify? What
word is used to increase the force of the word "liberally"?  What part of
speech is it? Why? What part of speech does it modify?
JIIRECTION. Ask similar questions respecting the rest of the above exercises, and
fill the Jfolowing blanks with adverbs, modifying the verbs in respect to time, plae,
manner, or' circumstance; and the adjectives and adverbs in degree.
John came          this morning.    The horses ran.    The
men    -   act ---.     Charles studied -    - faithfully.   Father
will      return.   The boy was          eager to learn.  Theindustrious pupils progress         rapidly.         studious boys
learn   -.
DIRECTION. Continute similar exercises on the slate and otherwise, till the 74se
of the adverb is familiar.
22. A noun may be used as a modifier by prefixing a connecting
word; as, Men of wealth.
23. The    word    connecting      a  modifying     noun    with
the word modified is called a PREPOSITION; as, Men of
wealth.
EXERCISES.
Mlen of wisdom are respected. The lecture on music will be
repeated.   A  man of wealth should be liberal.       John went to
Boston. The boy was eager for praise. James lives in Cincin.
nati. William has returned from Philadelphia.
In the first exercise, is it asserted that " men are respected," without refor.
ence to the kind of men?  What word is used to modify or limit men? What
part of speech is it? What word connects the limiting noun with the word
limited? What part of speech is it? Why?
What is the word called that connects a modifying noun with a modified word?COMMON-SCH0OOL GRAMMAR.5. "Ml]any," followed by a or an, is used with a singular noun; as,
Many a onle, Many a man, Full many a gem of purest ray serene, Many
an hour.
6. This relates to the last mentioned of two objects, that to the first
mentioned; this to the nearest object, that to the one farthest off.
Their plurals, these and those, are also used in the same way; as,
Nor be thy generous indignation checked;
Nor checked the tender tear to Misery given;
From Guilt's contagious lpower shall t,zhat protect,
This soften and refine the soul for heaven.
7. In comparing two objects, the comparative degree is generally
preferied, though good usage sanctions the superlative; as, John is
wiser than I, He is larger than you, He is taller than either of us, He
is the stronger of the two, or He is the strongest of the two.
8. In other comparisons, the superlative is generally used; as, Wil
liam is the best boy in the school, He was the manliest of you all, The
greatest of these three is charity.
NOTE. Care must be taken that the latter term of comparison, in the use of
the comparative degree, should never include the former; nor exclude it, in the
use of the sutperlative; as, Gold is more precious than any metal, shoutld be,
Gold is more precious than any other metal; Gold is the most precious of all
other metals, shouztld be, Gold is the most precious of all metals.
9. When from a verb compounded with a preposition, as "look for,"
an adjective is formed by prefixing the syllable un to the perfect participle, as "unlooked for," or " unlooked-for," it may be parsed as a
compound adcljective, whether written with a hyphen or not; as, An
event so unlookedfor discouraged him.
10. Adjectives are sometimes used as adverbs, especially by the
poets; as, Bold can he speak, and fairly ride. Fierce he broke forth.
Of near two hundred and fifty authors, &amp;c. Here, bold - boldly,
fierce - fiercely, and near - nearly.
11. Double comparatives and superlativds should be avoided. They
are sometimrLes found in the old writers; as, This was the most unkindest cut of all.
ARRANGEMENT.
REMARK 1. The adjective is generally placed before the noun that
it qualifies or limits; as, Good men.
It0)COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
NOTE. The adjective should be placed so near the noun it limits, as to prevent all ambiguity.
2. An adjective, indirectly modified by other words, may follow its
noun; as, A man diligent in business.
3. Also when the quality is asserted, as in the predicate; as, Honey
is sweet.
4. When the quality proceeds from the action of the verb; as, Idleness makes a mian poor.
5. When the adjective belongs to a pronoun, it generally comes
after it; as, We found him studious and attentive.
MODEL.
Pure air and free exercise are indispensable; ailnd
wherever either of them       is withheld, tlhe consequence
will be fatal.
This compound sentence consists of two independent clauses connected by "and;" and one dependent, connected with them by the
connective adverb " wherever."
The first clause has a compound subject consisting of two nouns in
the singular, connected by "and."  They are used jointly, and require
a plural predicate.
"Are" is the predicate, and "indispensable" is an adjective in the
predicate.
"Conlsequence" is the subject of the second inldependent clause;
"will be" is the predicate, modified by the adverbial clause as an adverb of place; and "fatal" is an adjective in the predicate.
The adverbial clause is connected with the seconld independent clause
by the connective adverb "wherever."
The distributive pronoun "either," used in the relation of a nouin,
is the subject, and is limited by the phrase " of them;" "is withheld" is the predicate.
"Pure" is an adjective limiting " air;" and " free" is an adjective
limiting " exercise."
"Indispensable" is an adjective in the predicate, compared by mscir
and most; here, in the simple form, expressing a quality asserted of
both "air" and "exercise," the joint subject of the clallse.
14*
161CO1I6IOON-SC0OOL GRA/IMAR.
"Fatal," the adjective in the predicate of the additional independent
clause, expresses a quality as asserted of the subject "consequence."
EXERCISES.
DIRECTION. Analyze the following sentences, and parse each word in its several forms,
properties, and relations, giving reasons therefor.
Pure air is essential to health. We are like them, simple,
hardy, bold. On old Bunker's lonely height the grass grows
green. The bugle's wild and warlike blast shall muster them no
more. Other countries may possess a richer soil and a gentler
sky. Other nations have gathered more laurels and twined more
garlands. No wind that blew was bitterer than he. It is a truth
fitted to awaken our most fervent gratitude. Of the more subtile
movements, we take no available cognizance. His cheek looks
pale. You will make him mad. We live in a most extraordinary age. A fairer and better land yet shall be ours. How
beautiful is all this visible world! Many a sigh called forth by
thee has swelled my aching breast. The influence of true religion is mild, and soft, and noiseless, and constant as the descent
of the evening dew on the tender herbage, nourishing and refreshing all the amiable and social virtues; but enthusiasm is violent,
sudden, rattling as a summer shower, rooting up the fairest flowers, and washing away the richest mould in the pleasant garden
of society.
Some place the bliss in action, some in ease;
Those call it pleasure, and contentment these.
The smooth stream in smoother numbers flows. He was the
proudest in his strength, the manliest of you all.
RULE IV.
PART 1. The article a or an limits nouns in the singular number only; as, a man, an hour.
2. The article the limits nouns in either number; as,
the man, the men.
162COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMJWIAR
163
REMARK 1. Before an abstract or a proper noun, and where the
meaning of a noun is in itself'definite, and in its use unhrestricted, the
article is generally omitted; as, before gold, beauty, Thomas, Cmesar,
virtue, vice, goodness, anger, love, paintinlg, sculpture, chemiistry, metaphysics, &amp;c.
NOTE. When restricted, the article is used; as, The gratitude of the man
w-las apparent.
2. Care must be taken, in the use or omission of the article, to
avoid ambiguity; as, a red and a white flag -two flags, each of only
one color. But a red and white flag- only one flag, and that of two
colors.
3. Sometimes the noun may be put in the plural, and then the
article need not be repeated; as, The Old and the New'TestainentThe Old and New Testaments. The first and the second day - The
first anld second days. Sometimes, however, for emphasis chiefly, the
article is repeated; as, Cicero, the orator and the patriot.
4. The use or omission of a before few and little materially affects
the sense; as when we say, "Few men observed it," we mean to say
it was almost entirely overlooked. But when we say --" Afew men observed it," we assert positively that there were some who noticed it,
though not many. "He had a little money" --he had some money.
But "He had little money," gives a negative meaning to the assertion.
5. So, too, after a comparison; as, "John is a better farmer than a
preacher" -than a preacher is. Here the comparison is between John
and some preacher, as to their skill in farming. But " John is a better
farmer than preacher" declares John's superior ability in the former
capacity. Here the comparison is between two employments for the
same man.
6. When an adjective is used as a noun, the is generally used with
it; as, T7he benevolent will be happy.
7. When a participle takes an article before it, it becomes a noun;
as, Love is the fulflling of the law.
8. The force of the comparative or superlative degree is sometimes
ia;aee-sed by prefixing "the"; as,'The lonqer you delay, the more you
will (kead it.  The sooner you do it, the better.
9). In the phrases, a great many men, a hundred men, a thousand
men, a million men, the words "many," " hundred," "thousand," alndC05M10MN-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
"million," may be regarded as collective nouns, in the singular, and
as having the article a (meaning one) belonging to them.
10. An is sometimes a conjunction, meaning ij; and is chiefly so
used by the old writers; as, Nay, an thou'lt mouth, I'll rant as well
as thou.
ARRANGEMENT.
REMARK 1. The article is generally placed immediately before the
noun it limits; as, The horse, a boy, an hour.
2. When an adjective and an article limit the same noun, the article
generally precedes the adjective; as, A good man, the tall boy, an
o.Qld horse.
3. In expressions like the following, the adjective precedes; as,
Many an hlour, all the boys, both the girls, such a tree, so largd a book,
what an error, too long a time, as fine a plant, how bright a day, full
many a gem, &amp;c.
MIODEL.
Beauty   is all all-pervadinig  presenlce;   anId  11O man
receives the true cultulre of a man, in whom       sensibility
to the beautiful is nlot cherished.
The sentence contains two independent propositions, which constitute
its two members, connected by "and."
The last member contains an independent clause, limited by a relative clause used to restrict the subject "man; " and therefore, in the
relation of an adjective limiting " man."
The relative "whom" connects these two clauses, relating to the
subject "man," and representing it.
"Beauty," "man," and "sensibility" are the grammatical subjects
of the three clauses respectively; and "is," "receives," and "is cherished," the grammatical predicates.
PRE:JENCE is a noun in the predicate, denoting the same thing as the
subject, aiwl directly limited by the comnpound participial adjective
"all-pervading" and the article "an."  So that the phrase "an allpervading presenlce"' is what is asserted of "beauty."
Man" is limited by the adjective " no " and by the adjective
clause restricting it.
" Culture" limits the transitive verb "receives" as its direct object,
4COMMON-SCIIOOL GRAMi1IA.LR.5
ancd is i.directly limnited by the phrase " of a man," and directly by
the  and 11 " true."
MIan" is limlited by the article " a."  Thus both subject and predicate are miodified.
In the relative clause, "senisibility" is indirectly limited by the
phrase " to the beautiful," and " beautiful" is limited by " the."
Thus "the beautiful" is used in preference to the abstract noun
beauty.
The phrase "of a man" limits "culture," and the phrase "in
whom" limits "is cherished."
The negative adverb "not" limits "is cherished."  Thus both subject and predicate of the adjective clause are modified.  
An is an indefinite article, used instead of a before the word "all"
because it begins with a vowel sound; and it limits the word " presence."
RTHE is a definite article, and limits "culture."
A is an indefinite article, limiting "man" in number, but leaving
it indefinite "what man;" extending to any man.
THE is a definite article, limiting definitely the noun " sensibility."
TIIE is a definite article, prefixed to the adjective "beautiful," which
is used here without a noun, to express abstract quality, and consequently parsed as a noun.

COITMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAIA.
RULE V.
Adverbls directly modify verbs, adjectives, and adverbs;
as, A very good iuaii will not always act very prudently.
REMARK 1. Adverbs also modify substitutes for adjectives and adverbs; as, He rowed the boat across the river. Here the adverbial
phlrase "across the river" modifies the verb "rowed," and is equivalent
to "there"; but in the senltences, He rowed the boat nearly across tlhe
river, almost across the river, or not quite across the river, the adverbs
nearly, almost, and the phrase not quite modify the phrase " across
the river," rather thaln the preposition across; as, He sailed precisely
at the hour. The arrow hit just above the mark. Even to old age.
2. Adverbial phrases are parsed like adverbs; they are abbreviated
expressions, sanctioned by usage; as, in vain, in particular, in general,
in fine, at once, from hence, by far, in short, some time ago, long time
ago, several years before, &amp;c.
3. Where is improperly used for in which, when place is not referred
to; as, A resolution was offered, where the transaction was condemned
in the strongest terms.  Where should be in which.
4. No, used as an adverb of degree, is joined to comparatives; as,
no nearer, no more, no higher, &amp;c. Before a noun it is an adjective.
5. After verbs of motion, hither for here, thither for there, and
whither for where, were formerly used; but have given place to here,
there, and where.
6. The preposition from is unnecessary before hence, thence, and
whence; as, From whence come wars and fightings among you?:Whence come wars and fightings among you?
7. Some adverbs are used independently, not modifying a particular
word, but a sentence; as, yes, yea, no, nay, ay, aye, amen, namely, to
wit, truly, verily, likewise, &amp;c.; as, Will John come? Yes.
8. There, as an introductory adverb, is often expletive, used merely for
euphony; as, There is no office higher than that of a teacher of youth.
9. Adverbs are sometimes used as nouns; as, For fear the very
stones prate of my whereabout. Till then farewell.
When I was young? Ah, woful when!
Ah for the change'twixt now and then!COMM,ION-SCHOOL GRAMIMAR.
10. All, meaning wholly, is an adverb; as, A11 bloodless lay the untrodden snow.
11. Two negatives in the same clause constitute an affirmative; as,
Nor did he not know the way -_ He did know the wvay. So, too, He
was not tunprepared _- He was prepared.
12. When an adverb connects clauses, the adverbial clause modifies
some word in the clause with which it is connected, showing the relation of time, place, manner, &amp;c., between the clauses; as, I will hold
the horse while you are getting into the carriage. Here the connective
adverb wthile connects the two clauses, anld marks identity of time.
ARR\ANGEMENT.
ItEMARK 1. Adverbs should be placed, generally, before adjectives,
after verbs, and between the auxiliary and the verb; as, John is very
studious; he recites correctly, anld his conduct is highly approved.
EXCEPTIONS. Ever, never, somietimes, often, always, and only, are commonly placed before the verb.
NOTE.'I'he foregoing rule is general, but much disregarded. It is only
necessary so to place the adverb, that its reference should never be doubtful.
2. An adverb should never come between "to," the sign of the infinitive, and its verb; as, He tried thoroughly to learn his lessons, or,
He tried to learn thoroughly, not, He tried to thoroughly learn.
3. Enouth is generally placed after the modified word; as, He did
it well enough. The horse is strong enough.
4. Interrogative adverbs begin a clause; as, Why did you do it?
DIRECTION. Construct sentences using adverbs in each.
MODEL.
When she came back to her seat again, the cricket and
the kettle were still keeping up the strain; and really
they went very well together.
This sentence consists of two independent clauses, and an adverbial
clause. The adverbial clause is connected with the first iiidependent
clause by the connective "when," expressing the relation of time between the two actions to be the same; so that the adverbial clause,
167('0t IlON-SCHOOL g 1t AMAIlR.
" When she caine back to her seat again," modifies "were keeping,"
the grammatical predicate of the clause with which it is connected.
"She" is the grammatical subject of the adverbial clause; " cricket
and kettle," of the first independent clause; and "they," of the additional clause.
"Came," the predicate of the adverbial clause, is modified indirectly
by the phrase "to her seat," directly by "back," and "again"; and
seat" is limited by " her." Thus all of the clause except "she," is
the modified predicate.
"Cricket" and " kettle," the compound subject, are each limited by
the artiele "the."
"Were keeping," the predicate of the first independent clause, is directly modified by the noun "strain," being the object of the action of
that transitive verb; by" still," "up," and by the adverbial clause.
WENT is the predicate of the last clause, and is directly limited by
"together," and the phrase " very well"; and "well" is modified by
the adverb "very," increasing the force of it. Thus the modified
predicate is all the clause except "they."
WHiiEN is a connective adverb, used to connect the clauses, showing
the relltion of time to be simultaneous between the two actions.
BAcK is anI adverb. showiiing the direction after a verb of motion; not
compared, and modifies "came."
AGAIN is an adverb, not compared, showing that the action was
repeated; it modifies "came."
STrILL is an adverb, denloting that the action was continued till her
retu-rn, and modifies "were keeping."
Up is an adverb, modifying the verb "were keeping."
REALLY is an adverb, affirming the action of the verb, and modifies
"went."
VERY is an adverb, increasing the force of the adverb "well," which
it modifies.
WELL is an adverb, showing the manner of the action. Positiva
well, comparative better, superlative best. In the positive form, and
constituting with "very," the adverbial phrase, "very well," which
modifies "went."
TOGETHER is an adverb, showing the manner of the action, and

RULE VI.
Prepositions require the objective case after them; as,
John gave the book to me.
NOTE. A noun or pronoutn indirectly modifying a word, and connected with
it by a preposition, is in the objective case.
REMARK 1. The antecedent term of a relation is sometimes implied;
as, All shall know him,from the least to the greatest. That is, all included in the class extending from, &amp;c. 0 for a lodge in some vast
wilderness! 0-- I wish.  "For" connects "lodge" with "I wish,"
or the intensified expression " 0," which is here an interjection, or an
undeveloped clause.
2. Sometimnes the limiting word is omitted, especially when it is obvious from the context; this is often the case when it is a pronoun;
as, I saw the man I was woirking for - I saw the man,for u/.'hv I was
working. He came to the river aind sailed across (if). He strolled
arounld in search of a hotel - aCround the 1)(,ce. But in such cases,

27. A word used to connect simple sentences is
called a CONJUNCTION; as, Charles studies, and          Henry

an a d.v  ).
3. So, also, tile phrases is vain, in short, in general, inz particular,
in secret, atfirst, at last, &amp;c., are parsed as adverbs, though the ellipsis
may be supplied; as, In a vain manner.    In a short time.  In a secret
place. In a particular manner. At the first time, &amp;c.
4. Sometimes the connecting word is omitted. It occurs most frequently before nouns, signifying time, space, distance, direction, dimension, weight, or measure; as, He was away firom  home one year.    He
was idle several days last week.  He walked two miles that day.    The
wall is six feet high, three feet thick, and four miles long. The man
went that way.
NOTE 1. The ellipses may be supplied; as, Daring one year, during several
days in last week, on several days of last week, through the space of two miiles
on that day, high to the extent of six feet, thick through the sptce of tlhree feet,
and long through the distance of four miles, in that way. In parsinlg, say
"objective of time," &amp;c., instead of supplying the ellipsis.
2. Before "home" the preposition is sometimies omitted; as, he went honme,
or he went to his home: Go homne5. The preposition is also omitted after the words worth, like, u.ntlike, near, ancd nigh, and sometimes after worthy an(i unworthy; as,
The book is worthl a dollar.  A figure like your father.  I was nifgh or
near him.
NOTE. The ellipses may be supplied; as, The book is of the worth of a dollar, equal in worth to a dollar; not, The book is equal in price or valaue to a
dollar. This last is substitution, not supplying an ellipsis.
6. After like, near, and nigh, "to" or "unto" may generally be
supplied in parsing.  By some these words are parsed as prepositions.
7. After some verbs, limited both directly and indirectly, the preposition is omitted, when the term of indirect limitation preceldes the
direct; as, I gave him the book.   But if the direct object comes first,
then the preposition should be expressed; as, I gave the book to him.
NO'TE 1. The verbs after which the preposition is most freqtuenltly omnitted
are, ask, teach, buy or sell, bring or carry?, give or present, get, send,?r-iese,
sing, tell, show, provide, pay, toss, pass, throw, pour?, hand, write, &amp;e.

8. "A shout was heard from within the palace."  Here the phrase
"within the palace" is conniected with " leard" hy "from."  Or the
ellipsis miay be sutpplied, as, "from a place within the palace." The following prepositions are thus used together; as, From without, from
above, fironom beyond, fiom around, according to, round about, from
under, from within, over against, &amp;c.; as, It camefr-om beyond the sea
- It came firom a place beyond the sea; from under the bridge
firomn a place under the bridge.
9. TI'he limiting term  used as the objective after a preposition may
be an infinitive mood, a participial noun, a phrase, or a clause; as, He
was about to go to the rescue. In giving an account of the battle, he
made several errors. His stay will depend entirely on how he ts received in this country -  on his reception, or the manner of his reception.
10. The limiting noun is sometimes connected with two antecedent
terms, but by difi'erenlt prepositions. This has been condemned by
grammarians, but prevails, and is often necessary; as, The rulinlg of
grammar is against, and the practice of writers in favor of, this use of
the preposition.  In this example, by a different arrangement, this construction may be avoided; as, The ruling of grammar is against this
use of the preposition; but the practice of writers, in favor of it.
NOTE. For definiteness and precision, much use is made of this form in law
writings, &amp;c.
11. Thian is used as a preposition before whom and which     as,
Satan, than whom none higher sat.
12. After a verb of motion, into is used; as, He went into the
house, not in the house. After a verb of rest, in is generally used; as,
He remained in the house.
ARRANGEMENT.
Prepositions precede the limiting nouns, and should be placed near
them; as, John rode to Baltimore in a chaise with his uncle.
ExcEPTIONS. The relative "that" precedes the preposition; so also somctimes "wllhom" and "which", as, I saw the book that he sentfor. This is the
house which tihe lived in. Here is the man whom you wrote to.
In the two last examples, the preposition could be placed before the pronoun;
as, This is the house an wAtchh he lived. Here is the man to tshons you wrote.
The arrangement wiith the relative "that " cannot be altered.COMiON-SCIOOL GRAMMAR.
MODEL.
Jane was reading out of tlhe Bible, which had beeii
given her by thle teacller.
A compound sentence. "Jane," the subject of the independent
clause, is not modified; "was reading," the predicate, is limited by the
phrase "out of the Bible," restricting this reading to the " Bible"; and
" Bible" is limited by the clause "which had been given her by the
teacher," still further restricting her reading in this illstance to one particular Bible.
Thus all of the sentence, except the word "Jane," is the modified
predicate.
The acldjective clause, " which had been given her by the teacher,"
is connected with the main clause by " which," a relative pronoun.
"Which," representing "Bible," is the ullinmodified subject of the subordinate clause; "had been given," the predicate, is limited by the
phrases "(to) her," and "by the teacher."
As "teacher" is connected with "had been given" by the preposition "1 by," and "her " by the preposition "to" implied, these, like all
other modifications by means of prepositions, are called indirect.
The modified predicate of the relative clause, then, is "had been
given her by the teacher."
" Jane" is a proper noun, third, singular, feminine, nominative, subject of " was reading " (why?).
Was reading" is an irregular verb, progressive form, indicative,
past, has the forlm of the third, singular, to agree with its subject ill
these respects (why?).
"Out of" is a compounld preposition, connecting "Bible" with
" was reading," in the relation of a modifying word.
" The" is a definite article, limiting " Bible" to a particular one,
described in the adjective clause.
6'Bible" is a nouni, third, singular, neuter, objective (why?), after
the preposition " out of," and indirectly modifies "was reading."
Which" is a relative pronoun, representing "Bible," aind therefore
third, singular, neuter, agreeing in these respects with its antecedent
nomninative case, subject of "had been given," and connects the two
clauses.
"Had been given "is an irregular, transitive verb, passive form,
indicative, past perfect (why?); not varied in this tense for person or

" Her" is a personal pronoun, substituted for the word " Jane," arid
representing it in gender, nlumber, and personl; therefore, third, singular, feminine; objective case, after the preposition "to " implied, which
connects it with "had been given," in the relation of an indirect inodification.
"By" is a preposition connecting "teacher" with "had been given"
in the relation of a modifying word.
"The" is a definlite article, limiting "teacher" to some particular
one, previously alluded to or known.
" Teacher" is a noun, third, singular, applicable to either sex, therefore masculine or feminine, and objective case after the preposition
" by," expressing the relation of "teacher" to "had been given," the
verb it indirectly modifies.

RlULE VII.
The direct object of a transitive verb is ill the objective
case; as, I found them. We saw himt.            Mlen worshlip God.
NOTE. This does not apply to the passive form.
REMARIK 1. Participles of transitive verbs, except in the passive
voice, also take the objective case after them; as, We found him driving the oxen.  Having written a letter and sealed it, he went to the post
office.  We should worship God, loving himn anld serving him with the
whole heart.
2. The object of a transitive verb may be a word, a phrase, a clause,
or a senltence; as, He knows how to commanzd.     Some said, by their
silence, " Better stay at home."  I heard that h7e was coming to school
again.
3. An intransitive verb may take an objective case when the object
and verb are kindred in mneanling; as, Run the race set before you.
Let me die the death of the righteous.  He dreamed another dream.
NOTE. Other intransitive verbs sometimes take the objective case after them,
as in the following idioms: The very streams ran blood. He wal,ed the horse.
He trotted thehorse. He galloped his horse. He danced the c/if/d. They talked
the hours away. They laughed hint to scornl. John cotld not loo/k him in the
face. He rans a coaclh to the steamboat.
4. In English, as in Latin, verbs that signify to cname or call, to
choose or elect, to alppoint or constitute, to esteem or reckon, to think or
consider, deen, make, create, &amp;c., take after them two objectives, when
both denote the same person or thing; as, They chose him governor.
NOTE 1. The verb " to be" is frequently ig?plied between the two objectives;
when it is expressed, one word may be considered the objective before the infinitive, and the other, a noun in the predicate, objective after "to be"; as,
They chose hinm to be governsor.
2. WVhen stch verbs are used in the passive form, both objectives are put in
the nomittative case, one before, ard the other after the verb, while the formlller
subject indirectly imodifies the verb; as, HIe was chosen governtor by tfhea.
5. Verbs that signify to ask, teach, -buy or sell, bring or carry, give
or present, get, send, offer, lend, refuse, sing, tell, show,provide,promise,C5OMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
pay, toss, pass, throw, pour, write, &amp;c., take two objects after them,
one direct, the other indirect; as, John gave mze this book.  But when
the direct object comcs between the verb and the indirect object, the
implied preposition must be expressed; as, John gave this book to
me. The direct object may be a clause; as, I promised him that I
would do it.
NOTEr 1. This is like the Latin construction, dative of the person anld accusative of the thing. When the ellipsis is supplied, and the implied preposition is
expressed, the order of arrangement must be changed; as, "John gave this
b)olk to me," is better than " John gave to mne this book"; better still, "Joht
gave me this book."
2. WVhen such words become passive, the direct object is made the subject of
the verb, and ca preposition is sometimes expressed before the indirect object;
also before the jbrmer sob/ect; as, This book was given to mne by John, or This
book was givein ine by John.
6. Some verbs may be used either as transitive or intransitive, according to their meaning; as, I returned to the city this morning. I
returnedl your book this morning.
7. When the object of a verb is general or indefinite, it is often
omitted; as, William studies.  Charles reads.  Anna recites.
ARRAINGEMENT.
The object is generally placed after the verb; but in interrogative
sentences, in verse, when emphatic, or when pronouns are used, it
often precedes; as, Whom   did you call?   The bells he jingled, and
the whistle blew.   Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind.
Himn whom thou lovest we shall see no more.
The location should be such as to prevent ambiguity.
MIODEL.
Consider eachl day of your life a leaf ix        your history;
making    thlereon  1lo record which you will ever wish to

"Which" connects the two clauses, and relates to "record" for its
antecedent.  The relative clause is restrictive, used in the relation of
an adjective limiting " record."1 7
COMMON-SCIHOOL GPAAl2fI-A_
The subject of the independent clause, representing a person or pcer'sons as ])oke to, anlld thl'etbefir pr)Iesumled to he present, is implied as
usual when the piediCL t. is in Ih i impirative mood.
"You," tha: iy,iiied subject, is miodified by the participle " making"
in the relation of an adjective; and " miaking," retaining its power as
the participle of a transitive verbl), is directly limited by the noun
"record," in the objective; "mnaking" is also modified by the adverb
thereon," used for " on it."
As the adjective clause modifies "record," the modified subject of
the leading clause is, "You, making thereon no record which you will
ever wish to erase."
Consider" is limited by "day" and "leaf," as the dir.c; objects
of its actionl, both representing the same thing.
" Day " is limited by " each" and the phrase " of your life "; "leaf"
is limited by "a" aind the phrase " in your history." Thus, " Consider
each day of your life a leaf in your history" is the modified predicate.
"You" is the subject of the adjective clause, and is not modified.
"Will wish," the predicate, is modified by the adverb "ever" acnd
by the infinitive phrase "to erase."
"Erase" is limited by the pronoun "which," being the direct object
of its action.
"Consider "-verb, regular, transitive, active form, imperative
mood, singular or plural, second person (why?), has " you" imtnlied
for its subject.
"Each" - adjective pronoun, distributive, applying to any day of
your life, therefore singular; limits "day."
"Day "    noun, third, singular, neuter (why?), direct object of the
transitive verb " consider," therefore in the objective.
" Of "  a preposition connecting "life" with "day." The phrase
"of your life" is equivalent to an adjective limiting " day."
"Your' - a personal pronoun, representing the person or persons addressed, therefore second person singular or pl7ral; used in
the relation of possessor or owner, therefore possessive case; limits
"life."
"4 Life "-noun, third, sinigular, neuter (why?), objective case after
-the preposition "of" in the relation of a modifying term to the
word "day."
"A" is an indefinite article, limiiting "leaf" to one, but indefinitely
to any leaf.COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
" Leaf"- noun, third, singular, neuter (why?); objective after
the transitive verb " consider," which is one of the verbs that take
two words in the objective, when both represent the same object.
"In"    preposition, connecting "history" with "leaf," which is
indirectly limited by "history"; the phrase "in your history" being
equivalent to an adjective limiting "leaf."
"Your"     possessive case, limits "history."  (See "your" before
" life.")
"History" -noun, third, singular, neuter (why?); objective after
the preposition "in," being the modifying term of the prepositional
relation.
"Making" -imperfect participle, from  the transitive verb make,
made, making, mnade; used in the relation of an adjective, and modifies
you" implied, the subject of " consider."
"Thereon" -adverb of place, meaning "on the leaf," modifies
"making."
No " - acldjective, limits "record."
"Record"--noun, third, singular, neuter (why?); objective, and
limits " making," which is derived firom a transitive verb.
"rWhich " - relative l)pronoun, substituted for'" record," and represeinting its antecedent in number and person; therefore third, singular;
objective, the direct object of the transitive verb "erase."
You "- personal pronoun, second personl, singular or plural, rep-.
resenting the person or persons addressed; nominative, and subject of
the verb "will wish."
"Will wish" -regular verb, active form, indicative, future, (why?),

RULE VIII.
A nioun, varied to denote the owner or possessor, directly limitinig anotlher, is in tlhe possessive case; as,.1oh','s book, ozatr sled, virtue has its reward.
REMARK 1. Possession, ownership, or source is generally expressed
by the limiting noun or pronoun, and it is often equivalent to an indirect limitation by means of a preposition; as, The king's palace= The
palace of the king. But where possession or owniership is not implied,
the possessive cannot be substituted for the indirect limitation, or if
substituted, not without change of meaning; as, An acre of ground,
love of money, a rod of iron, cannot be changed into the possessive
form. "Our Father's lonve" means the love He bears to his children;
but "The love of our Fathier" may mean "The love He bears to us,"
or "The love we bear to Him."17i)
COA1iON-SICHOOL GRAMIM{AR.
NOTE. Whe'e thlese folrmns are convertible, it gives variety of expression and
arrangement; as, " Johnl's wife's father's house; better, "The house belonging
to the father of John's wife."
2. The noun limited     by the possessive    is often understood,
where it may be so readily iniferred from the context that its omission
will not cause obscurity; as " He bought the book at Crosby's," the
word store being obviously implied.
3. It is generally omitted, too, where its expression would be a mere
repetition, unnecessary, and often harsh; as, This book is Johnl's (book).
I saw Henry's boat, but not John's (boat).   It is a painting of Raphael's - one of Raphael's paintings.  Here the noun limited is understood, and wlhen expressed is the objective after "of."
4. It is omitted also after ours, yours, theirs, hers, generally after
tmime and thine, and sometimes after his; as, The sled is mt,ine, the ball
is yours, the cap is his.
NOTE. It will be observed, however, that, in such cases, the noun, if expressed, would not only be a useless repetition, but would generally requtire a
chlange in the form of the pronoun; as no one of them, except his, mine, and
thine, can be followed by the noun it is intended to limit.
5.  WVhen joint ownership is expressed by two or more nouns, that
only immediately preceding the limited word takes the possessive termination; as, William, Henry, and John's boat. But when the nlouns
denote separate owners of different things, each has the possessive
termination; as, William's, Henry's, and John's boats.
6. When the name of a person consists of several words, or a title
is prefixed to the name, the possessive termination is affixed only to
the last word of the name; that is, they are considered together as
a name, and parsed as one word; as, George Washington's election.
General Washizgton's house.     General William  -tenry cHarrisorn's
administration.  The Queen of England's signature.   Here the phrase
"Queen of England's" is dealt with as a single wvord, limiting "signrature."  It has the possessive sign annexed to "England," although
it is really the Queen's "signature."
7. Words in apposition, when not separated by a comma, have tlhe
possessive termination annexed to the last; as, David the psalmist's'ritings.  For David my servant's sake.    For my servant David's
sake. Paul the apostle's advice. The apostle Paul's advice. The[8  INTRODUCTION TO COIMMON-SCHOOL GRAMIMAI.

MODEL.
Williaml and Henry's kite was boughlt at Brown's; but
its strilg was once Edward's.
The two clauses are independent, and connected by " but," denoting
contrast.
"Kite," the subject of the first clause, is modified by two nouns
having the possessive sign annexed only to the last, denoting joint
ownership; and "William and Henry's kite" is the modified subject.
"Was bought," the predicate, is indirectly limited by the phrase
"at Brown's (store)," and "store," implied, is limited by Brown's, denotinIg the owner or storekeeper; thus, "was bought at Brown's" is
the modclified predicate.
"String," the subject of the second clause, is limnited by "its," substituted for "kite," and denoting the "kite's string "; thus, "it's
string" is the modified subject.
"Was," the predicate, is limnited by the adverb "once" and the
predicate-nomlinative " string," understood, which is limited by Edward's, denoting the former owner of the string.
There is an ellipsis of the words "store" and " string," because they
are stfficiently obvious firom the context, and euphony requires their
omission.
"WILLIAM and HE,NRY'S" are proper nouns; each third, masculine,
oinguiar, possessive, though the sign of the possessive is annexed only
to the last, it beinig a joint ownership.
BRow-'s is a proper noun, name of anl individual, third, masculine, singular, possessive, denoting a possessor or owner; and limits' store," implied.

NOTE. This rule refers to construction, and not arrangement; as, Art thou
he? Dust thou art, to dust returnest. Is he a good man?
REMARK 1. A noun in the predicate miay differ in number and person from  the subject; as, My chief haunt is the banks of a small
stream.  It was he. It was they.   Thou art he.
2. The verbs that most firequently take a noun in the predticatfe,
meaning the same thinlg as the subject, and agreeing with it in case,
are,
1st. TI'he verbs be, become, appear, seem, look; those denloting life or
deatl', position or motion, &amp;c.; as, By his uncle's death, he became
-(,arl of Rothsay.  She seemed a child of unusual promise. lie died a
a,Zyr to ithine cause. He lived a hzermit for many years. liCe came a
coquueror. Ile stood a 7hero in the strife.
2d. The passive of the verb-s name, call, choose, elect, appoint,, i;,,a,ke,
const,titte, create, esteem, consider, judge, stppose, reckon, &amp;c.; as, He
was naimedl John. He was called, chosen, elected, appointed, v.a,dc,
co0stittuted, created major.  After somne of these, as also after aofpear,
a(Id seem, there is generally an ellipsis of the infinitive "to be "; as, He
was esteemed, considered, judged, supposed, reckoned (to be) a good. Sometimes as precedes the noun in the predicate, and the ellipsis
mn-.- be supplied; as, He wvas considered as umpire in the matter
He acted as umpire in the matter.
4. Either term  or both terms may be nouns, pronouns, ph)hrases,
cl-auses, or sentences; as, To doutbt is to rebel.  To conce:al art s the
perfection of art.  The first and great object of education is to (lisci-,l-ie tlhe mind.  To overcome evil withl good, is noble.  "Be-ar and

MODEL.
I Icknow hiim    to be an hoilest man.
"I" is the grammnaticenl sublject of the clause, and is not modified.
"9Know'" th'e gram.matical predicate, is directly modified by "him,"
182COMAION-SCHOOL GRAMlMAlAlt
and "him" by the rest of tho sentence; so that "know him to be an
honest man " is the modified predicate.
"I," a personal pronoun re)presenting the speaker, has the form appropriated to the first person, singular, nominative, and is the subjectnominative of the verb "know."
"Know" is an irregular verb, know, knew, known; transitive, having for its object "him" and the rest of the sentence; as, "I know
what "?  Answer -" him to be an honest man."  That is, "I know that
he is an h7onest mana." Indicative, present; is not varied to agree wNith
its subject in number and person.
" 1im" is a personal pronoun, third, singular, masculine, objective,
in form; limits the transitive verb " know."
"To be" is an irregular, intransitive verb; infinitive, present
(why?); limits "him," which is objective case before it as its stdlject.
An" is an indefinite article, limiting " man "; used instead ^f a before a vowel sounld.
"Honest" is an adjective, limiting the noun "man."
"Maln" is a noun in the lpredicate, meaninig the same person as
Ihin," and in the same case.  It is therefore predicate-objective after
"to be," as " hiim " is slbjecct-objective before it.
5When the abbreviated expression assiuming the fact, is expanlded into
a full clause asserting it, "man" becomes predicate-noominative after
"is," because " he " is subject-nominative before it.

A  noun, used to explain another, denoting the same
object, is in apposition with it ill the same case; as,
Webster, tlie great statesman, is dead.       James, cO1me to
me, your teachler.
NOTE. APPOSITION means added to, and the annexed word generally explains, identifies, or describes the other term as to character, official riaik, employmen t, &amp;e.
REMARK 1. The added term is generally an abbreviated ad(jective
clause, assumged, instead of being asserted by writing it with a relative
and verb; as, Webster, who sas the great statesman, is dead __c Webster, the great statesman, is dead.  In the first, statesmanship is
asserted; in the secolnd, it is assumed.
2. Whenl words are in apposition, either of the terms may be a
nounl, a pronoun, a phrase, a clause, or a sentence.
1st. A pronoun; as, We, his fellow citizens, have elected him. I
Darius, king of Persia, have decreed it. He addressed the letter to
me, his earliest friend. I brought it, a present from my brother.
2d. A phrase; as, He did it for this purpose, to bring the esensy to
termns. The promise, to be quiet, was soon forgotten.
3d. A clause; as, He overlooked the cause of his discomfiture, thl.t
his outposts were not sufficiently guarded.
4th. A sentence; as, "Do unto others as you would that theyl shosld
do unto you": a command that is too seldom obeyed. "Know them
thyself': a species of knowledge too little regarded.
3. A word in the plural, used in summing up for perspiculty or
emphasis, may be in apposition with the several parts collectively; as,
Anger, hatred, revenge, -feelings never indulged with impunity,
hurried him on to his fate. Anger, hatred, revenge, all contributed to
his downfall.
4. Words used distributively may be in apposition with a word[
denoting the whole; as, The great mass will soon be scatterecd,:oeie
to their merchandise, others to their worskshops; a few, it nmay be, t)COIMI ON-SCHOOL GR ALd5i A PI.

qu'et rAir _e'nLi,.l-the rest to their several pleasures. Two representattyves were present, one from the nobles, the other from the cornmons. The human species is composed of two distinct races, - the
men vwho borrow, and the men who lend.
NOTE. The added term, whether distributive or modified by a distributive, is
in apposition with a plural noun; as, The men departed, each to his own horne.
They worked well, each in his own way. Flee ye, every man, to his own city.
5. When reciprocal pronouns are in apposition with a word, the firlst
one only is so used; the other has a different regimen, obvious fromn
the construction; as, Boys should help one another in doing right -
one should help another. They got in each other's way - each in the
other's way. The men struck each other - each struck the other. We
love onle another - onle loves another.
6. When nouns in apposition are in the possessive case, the sign
of the possessive is added to the last only; as, His brother John's
book. I bought the book at my friend Crosby's store. The parcel
was left at his cousin Willian's house.
7. Sometimes, when a pronloun is in thle possessive case, a n1oun in
apposition with it may be without the possessive sign; as, A view of
the Falls of Niagara is h7is best work, as an artist.  Such was his
lamented end, the scholar, the poet, the philanthropist.
8. When a noun is repeated for emphasis, the repeated word may
be parsed in apposition with the former; as, The people, the people, if
we are true to them, will carry us, and will carry themselves, gloriously
through this struggle. I saw his corse, his mangled corse; and then I
cried for vengeance.
9. When the common and proper names of an object are used
together, they are generally in apposition; as, Lake George, King
John, the steamer Wabash, the river Jordan.  Sometimes the preposition of is used; as, the bay of Biscay, the city of London, the town
of Cohasset, the state of New York.
NOTE. Proper names, consisting of more than one word, are parsed conjointly as a whole; as, Daniel Webster, william Henry Harrison. In parsing,
it is as needless to separate the words composing a name, as it would be to
separate the syllables composing each word.
10. Verbs of naming, &amp;c., are generally followed by two words in
16*COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
the objective; and, as they denote the same object, the latter is often
parsed in appositioni with the first; as, They called his name John.
They nanled the child John.
11. Sometimes, when words are in apposition, the added term is
l)receded by as, especially when such term denotes occupation, employment, &amp;c.; as, Washington was unsurpassed as a patriot  in the
character of a patriot.

Solomnon, the builder of the temple of Jerusalem, - thle
soni of David thle psalmnist, was the richlest monlarch that
reigned over the Jewishl people.
One independent clause and one dependent clause, connected by the
relative pronoun " that," used here after a superlative, "richest," in
preference to "w ho."
"Solomon," the subject of the first clause, is directly limited by
"builder," and by "son," nouns used to explain it, all tlhr-ee denoting
the same person.
"Builder" is limited by the phrase "of the temple," "temple" by
the phrase "of Jerusalem," - and "son" by the phrase "of David."
"David" is limited by "psalmist," used to explain, denoting the
same person as "David."
"Was," the predicate, is limited by "monarch," a noun in the predicate, denoting the same person as the subject; anid "monarch" is
limited by "richest," an adjective in the superlative degree.
"That," a relative pronoun representing " monarchl," is the subject
of the adjective clause; "reigned," the predicate of it, is indirectly
modified by the phrase "over the Jewish people," and "people" is
limited by the adjective "Jewish." Thus "reigned over the Jewish
people" is the modified predicate.
BUILDER and SON, common nouns, each applying to any one of its
class; third person, spoken of; masculine, male beings; singular,
each denoting only one; nominative case, because " Solomon," which
each is used to explain, is nomiinative; meaning the same person as

iNOTE. A pronoun of the first person is sometimles used independently in the
objective; as, Ah me -!le miserable!
IiEMARK 1. A noun may be used independently:1st. By direct address; as, Thou, William, still art young. Soldiers,

3d. By redundancy or pleonasm; as, Assyria, Greece, Rome, CaG'thage - what are they? Are they here - the dead of other days?
Now Harry, 7he had long suspected this trespass of old Goody Blake.
2. A noun in the nominative by direct address is of the second
person, and, though grammatically independent as to case-relation in
the construction of the sentence, it may be modified in other respects
as, O days of ancient grandeur, are ye gone?
3. A noun in the nominative by exclamation is generally of the third
person, and, though modified, is illdependent in construction; as, That
then - 0, disgrace upon manhood!- even then, you should falter.
4. A noun is in the nominative independent by redundanzcy or pleonasm when rep6ated, or when introduced abruptly, while a pronoun
representing it, is the subject of the verb; as, The pilgrim fatherswhere are they? The people, the people, if we are true to them, will
carry us, and will carry themselves, gloriously through this contest.
MODEL.
Soldiers, a powerful army has invaded thle country.
"Army," the subject of this sentence, is limited by "powerful" and
"a"; and "a powerful army " is the modified subject.
"Has invaded" is directly modified by "country," specifying the
object invaded; and "country" is limited, by the definite article "the,"
to a particular country.
This sentence, complete in itself, asserts a fact.
"Soldiers" represents the persons to whom the thought contained
in the sentence is addressed; it has no case-relation to any word ill
the sentence, and is therefore used independently of it in construction; hence it is in the nominative case.
The indefinite article "a" limits "army"; and the definite article
" the" limits "country."
"Powerful" is an adjective, simple form, compared by more and
most, and describes "army."
"Army" is a collective noun, singular, thlird person, neuter, nominative, and subject of the verb "has invaded."
"Has invaded" is a verb, regular in the formnation of its principal

31. The ARTICLE enters into the construction as a limiting adjective. Only a or an, and the, are called ARTICLES; as, a horse, uo
egg, the boy.
32. ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS perfbrm the grammatical function of'
an adjective, and, with one or two exceptions, may be used, by
Q11ipsis, in the relation of nouns, as most adjectives may; as, Some
boys will learn, and somre will not.

and spoke of meeting you.
34. The INTERJECTION is tl ablr pt exclamnation, used to express passion or emnotion. In the early development of language it expressed,
perhaps, what now requires a sub)ject and predicate. It embodied
the thought, and was an undeveloped sentence. It is a condensed
substitute for a sentence, and generally a commentary on the succeeding sentence; as Alas! the Iiremed(ly caie too latte.  Grammatically it is not considered as connected with other words. Still it
has a, logical dependence, thougll no recognized grammatical relation.

Thle abbreviated or contracted clause, "Peace of mind being secured" - if, when, as, because, since, &amp;c., " peace of mind is secured."
The clause, " We may smile at misfortunes," is complete in itself, iin
construction and sense. Therefore the words of the abbreviated clause
are used independently.
When the contracted clause is fully expressed, " peace" is the sub
ject, and "is secured" is the predicate.
We" is the subject of the complete clause; "may smile," the
pred(licalte. is limited by the phrase " at misfortunes"; making " may
smile at misfortunes " the modified predicate.
PExACE is a commnon noun, third, neuter, singular, nominative; used
independenitly with the participle "being secured"; it is not connected with the rest of the sentence.
"Being secured" is a p)articiple, imperfect, passive, from the verb

RULE XIV.
Participles are used in the relations of adjectives and
noulns; anid, wlhen derived from     transitive verbs, take a
direct object; as, By doingi nothing, we learn to do ill.
Their bones lie mouldering' in the dust.(OMHIION-SCHIOOL GRAMMAIR.
tEMARKI 1. When the participle is limited by an article or an adjective, it cannot take an object, and is followed by a preposition, genierally " of"; as, Love is the fitJilling of the law.
2. A participle, in the relation of a noun, may be a subject-nominative, a predicate-nominative, the object of a transitive verb, or of a
relation by means of a preposition, and yet take a direct object; as,
Striking a man is doing injury to him. In praising a man, avoid injtt'intg him.
3. When a participle has no obvious dependence on other wvords in
the sentence, being an abbreviated or contracted expression, it is used
independently. If the ellipsis be supplied to find the word it limits,
the clause is often awkward; as, Genrerally speaking, he attended to
his duty.  Supplying the ellipsis,' I, generally speakinig -speaking in
giieercd terms, say that Ihe, &amp;c.
4. A participle used in the relation of an adjective may limit a noun
or its substitute, and yet take a direct object; as, I stood still, watching their motions.
5. "Unknowing,"    i unknown," &amp;c., were formerly participles; but
since the verbs from which they were derived have become obsolete,
they are considered as adjectives.
NOTE. In the expression, "unlooked-for circumstances," the compound
word "'unlooked-for" may be parsed as an adjective.
MODEL
Th-e gentleman, seeing me, spoke of hlavinlg settled his
affairs.
Gentleman," the subject, is limited( by the article " the," and the
participle " seeing " used in the relation of an adjective.
The participle " seeing" is directly limited by the personal pronoun
"me," which relpresents the personl speaking, therefore of the first person; objective case after the transitive participle. Thus, "the gentleman, seeing me," is the modified subject.
"Spoke," the predicate, is indirectly limited by the objective phrase,
"of having settled his affairs."
17
193194               COMiiON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
"Having settled" takes for its direct object the noun " affairs" in
the objective, and " affairs " is limnited by " his."  Thus, " spoke of
having settled his affairs" is the modified predicate, composed of a
verb and a limiting phrase.
SEEING is an imperfect participle, active; firom the irregular, transitive verb "see"; here used in the relation of an adjective, and limiting "gentleman."
HAYING SETTLED is a compound perfect participle, active; from tlhe
regular transitive verb "settle "; used here in the relation of a noun,
in the objective after the preposition "of."  Both "seeing" and "having settled" retain the power of a verb in taking the objective case
after them.

RULE XV.
A verb' witlhout a subject-nominative, preceded by "to,"
I,S in tlhe inlfinlitive mood.COM.I ON-C CIiOOLO  G G;'XIAiMR.
195
NOTE. A verb thus unlliited by nulmber or person may be used in most of
the Iusual relations of the nouuI except the possessive; or miodify a verb, noun,
adjective, or adverb, to dentote a purpose, object, or result; as, T/o excet is his
desire. He desires to excel. A desire to excel. Anxious to excel. He was
well enougyh to excel.
1REMARIK 1. After the active form of the verbs bid, dare, hear,feel,
nzake, see, let, need, with their participles, and a few others of similar
import, the infinlitive sign "to" is commonly omitted; as, He bade,
mnade, saw, or let mne do it.  Seeing the sun rise is pleasant.  Bidding
him- go with speed.
NOTE 1. Some of the verbs of similar import are behold, observe, perceive,
have, know, he.p, &amp;c. Euphony alone must determine the use or omission
of " to."
2. "To" is sometimes expressed after the above verbs, especially in poetry;
as, And dar'st thou then to beard the lion in his den?
2. The infinitive mood may modify or depend on a
Verb; as, lie tried to run.  He was told to try to run.
Partic?ple; as, Trying to run, he fell.
Nount; as, He had a desire to run.
Pronocte; as, They desired him to run.
Acjective; as, He was ready to run.
Adverb; as, He was strong enoutgh to run.
Conjunction; as, He was so foolish as to run.
Pre?position; as, For no purpose except to run.
3. The infinitive modifies a noun or pronoun in the objective case,
in the relation of its subject, when together they might form the subject and predicate of a clause: as, He commanded the book to be
brought to him --  He commanded that the book s7tould be brought to
h in?. I think him to be just -I think that he is just, or, I thinlk he is
just.
NOTE, 1. It is evident that he did not comnmand the book; so that the object
of " conmnanded" must be the phrase " the book to be brought to him."  In
par.iev.~ "book" may be called the objective before the infinitive "to be
bronlht"; beingi used in the relation of a subject before the infinitive.
2. Thbat "book" is in the oljective case may be seen by putting a pronoun
in a simil:r relation; or it may be seen in an example where the pronoun is
used; as, I think hian to be honest.
3. As such formus of expression may be represented by the conjunction196
"th.'t  with the indicative or potential imoodl, it malty be swell to coilsider such
iuiiitive phrases as abbreviated clauses, conitaininig assumed instead of asserted
propositions.
4. The objective case, in the relation of a subject of the infinitive, is generally
put after verbs and participles denoting the exercise of the intellectualfcaculties
or the external senses, or thle commtuzication of thought to others; as, after saying, thinkcing, knowing, commanding, perceiving, and the like.
4. The infinitive often expresses an action or state abstractly as well
as indefinitely; as, To live is to act -  Lije is action.  To be good is
to be wise = Goodness is wisdom.
5. From such examples it is clear that the infinitive, used abstractly,
may be either a
SUBJECT-NOMINATIVE; as, To obey is proper = Obeying is proper  
Obedience is proper;- or a
PREDICATE-NOMINATIVE; as, To obey is to enjoy - To obey is enjoying    To obey is enjoyment;
Or BOTH; as, To obey is to enjoy -Obeying is enjoying         Obedience is enjoyment.
NOTE. The infinitive modifies a verb without reference to the kind of action
expressed by it, as transitive or intransitive; as, Boys love to play. Boys cease
to play. Boys seem to play. Boys are to play here in future.
6. The infinitive, either with or without an objective subject, may be
the subject of a verb; as, For us to obey is proper    Tleat wee shlould
obey is proper - To obey is proper for us - Obedience is proper for us.
NOTE. When an infinitive with its subject is used as subject of the verb,
the preposition "for" often precedes the objective subject. In such cases, by
transposition of the objective subject, the infinritive is often seen to be used
abstractly; as, For her to die was gain =- To dlie was gain for her= Death was
gain for her. For him to study is desirable =-- To study is desirable for hins  
Study is desirable for him.
7. When the infinitive is used as a subject, and has no antecedent
term of relation, it is generally used abstractly. By supplying an ellipsis, the modified term  may restrict what before was indefinite or general; as, Goodness is happiness - To be good is to be happy - For
any one to be good is to be happy    - For me, you, him, her, us, them,
or anybody to be good is to be happy.
8. The infinitive often follows than after a comparison, as after so
1,.I k         k
I,   I,  j ",X 1 1, A M;'V1 AR.
C0"!-'!'e"'_-.') I 0 r' t("'COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
or such, and too before an acjective or adverb, the limited wvord being
omitted; as, He went so far as to dispute any one.  He went to secli
lengths as to alienate his friends.  He knew better than to submit it to
the lpeo)ple. He was too young to begin the study.
No1TE 1. The infinitive may limit the phrase "too young," which it follows,
or the infinitive subject-objective may be supplied; as, He was too youngjbfor
/him to 1 begin the study.
2. "To go is better than to stay " (is); here, by supplying the ellipsis, it is
appareit that the infinitive is used in the relation of a noun, the sublject of
is" inmplied.
9. The infitiitive is sometimes used independently, without the limited term; as, To cofy"ess the truth, I was in fault       I (anxious,
twilin,my, wishing, determined, in order), to confess the truth, say that I
was in ifult.  But supplying such ellipses is sometimes very awkward.
Norm. When the infinitive is thus used, it is an abbreviated expression for a
clause, and it may be changed into a predicate, in the potential mood, after
"thatt"; as, That I may confess the truth, (I say,) I was in fault.
10. In expressing a purpose, object, &amp;c., formerly the prepositionr
"for," or the phrase "in order," was used; now neither is used; as,
They came i, order to learn -  They came for to learn -    They came
to learn - They camine that they might learn.
11. The infinitive "to be" is sometimes properly omitted; as, I
consider it (to be) good. I think him (to be) an honest man _- I think
(aliat) he is an honest man.
NOTE. Here "him" is the subject-objective before the infinitive implied, and
"mn " the predicate-objective after it.
12. The infinitive frequently follows the connectives how, when,
where, &amp;c.; as, I know how to do it.    He was told when to go, and
where to go.
NOTuE. As is the case after than, as, &amp;c., this is caused by ellipsis.
13. The verb is sometimes improperly omitted after "to"; as, " He
studied, or at least triedl to."  Study should be expressed after "to"
as, " or at least tried to study."
14. No word should intervene between the parts of the infinitive
mood; as the verb should lnot be separated from its infinitive sign,
17
1:97198               COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMIIMAR.
when expressed; as, " ie dltermined to faithfully studcly his lesson,"
should be, "He determined to study his lesson faithfully."
15. When the pronoun "it," as the subject of a sentence, is followed
by an infinitive phrase or a clause, in the way of explanation, such
phrase or clause is used in the relation of a noun, in apposition with
"it"; as, It is presumption in man to arraign the doings of his Maker.
It is impossible that man should go through the world without exercising influence.
MODEL.
I know him to be a good boy, and you may let him          go
home.
Two independent clauses connected by "and."
"I" is the subject of the first clause, unmodified.
"Know" is the grammatical predicate, and "know him to be a
good boy" the modified predicate.
The objective phrase "him to be a good boy"- that he is a good
boy.
In parsing the phrase, we regard "him" as in the objective, being
the direct object of "know." It may, also, be considered as the subject-objective before the infinitive "to be,"  "boy" being objective
after it as a noun in the predicate.
"You" is the sutbject of the second clause; and "may let," the
predicate, is limited by its direct object "him"; and "him," by the
verb "go" in the infinitive mood.
To" is omittecl before "go," because it follows "let," and "go"
is limited by " home."  "Holme" sometimes follows a verb of motion,
without the preposition.
"To be" is an irregular, intransitive verb, infinitive, present, and
has "him" for its subject in the objective case.
"Go " is an irregular, intransitive verb; go, went, gone; it is in the
infinitive mood, and limits "him."

2. Conjunctions connect phrases in the same construction; as,
He was constantly employed in hunting up cases of suffering, in
relieving present want, and in providing against future distress.  To
ferret out s{tfering, to relieve want, and to provide against distress
were to him imperative duties.
3. Conjunctions connect clauses, sometimes expressing their relation; as, John came because he was sent for., Here the relation is
that of cause and effect.
4. Conjulnctions connlect nouns and pronouns in the same case; as,
You will see him and me. I met Jolhn and William.
5. Conjunctions commonly connect verbs in the same mode and

6. Conrjunctions sometimes connect verbs in different modes and
tenses; as, Words are like arrows, and should not be shot at random.
7. Conjunctions connect words of the same or a similar class in
the same relation; as, The great and good man labored steadily and
fai thflly. A boy, diligent and trying to improve, will succeed.
N\OTL. An apparent exception sometimes occurs; as, The boy was not here,
but at school. Bat connects with the adverb here, the phrase at school, which
is equivalent to the adverb there, as, The boy was not here, but there. Or the
ellipsis may be supplied; as, The boy wvas not here, but he was at school.
8. That is sometimes used before a subjective clause or an objective,
when it merely expresses the fact asserted in the clause; and in suchCO01MION-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
cases it may often be omitted for euphony; as, I knew that he would
do it, or I knew he would do it.
9. Prepositions connect words in different relations; i. e., the consequent term of relation always limits the antecedent; as, He is a man
of wealth.
But conjunctions, when they connect words, unite similar elements
having a common dependence; as, A great and good man.
10. Those connectives which unite dependent clauses to the clauses
on which they depend, never connect words.
MODEL.
A temperate man's life passes on calnly and sereinely,
because it is innocent.
"A temperate man's life" is the modified subject, and " passes on
calmly and serenely" is the modified predicate of the first clause.
Here "life," the subject, is limited by " man's," and "man's" by
"temperate," restricting the word "life " not only to "man's life,"' but
to the "life " of a "temperate man."
"Passes," the predicate, is modified by the adverbs "on," "calmly,
and serenlely)" showing the manner of the action.
"It is the subject, and "is" the predicate of the secocnd clause;
"innocent," modifying the verb, is an adjective in the predicate, and
is here asserted of the subject.
The two clauses are connected by "because," the latter showing the
reason.
AND is a conjunction, connecting the adverb "serenely" with
"calmly."  By supplying the ellipsis, " and " would here connect

NOTE. The preposition shows grammatical, lnot logical, relation between
the connected terms.
REIARIC 1. Prepositions connect words of the same or different
classes in differenlt relations; as,
l st. A nounI limited by a noun; as, A man of wealth - A wealthy
iman =- A man who is wealthy. The phrase "of wealth" is equivalent
to an adjectlile, and so is the relative clause "who is wealthy."

4th. An adverb limited by a noun; as, John studies diligently
enov,y!h for sutcces'.
5th. A participle limited by a noun; as, I saw John running for

6th. In supplying an ellipsis of the limited word or antecedent termn
of a relation in poetry, the context is often merely suggestive, instead
of being definitive; as in the fellowing from Byron:
But with the breath that fills
Thleir mountain--pipe, so fil-l the mountaineers
With the fierce native daring which instils
The stirring memory of a thousand years;
And Evan's, Donaldl's fame rings in each clansman's ears!
Here supply "But as their ears fill with the breath," (air,) &amp;c. See
last line.
7th. The great dclistinction between the preposition and the conjunction
is, that the preposition connects wordls of the same or dfferent classes
A203C0MCOMON-SCHOOL GRADMMAR.
in ditrenet relations; wAhile the conjunction connects words of the
same class in the s,:ine relation. BesidJes, COnjunCtions connect sinilclar
phrases, also clauses and sentences, aind this is their peculiar function.
Thus prepositions connect sword.s, and show the relation between them;
conjunctions connect clauses, and show relation between them.
NOTE. Prepositions are sometimes used idiomatically, without any obvious
antecedent term of relation till transposed; as, For him to deny it is folly. By
transpositionl, It is follyfor him to deny it.
MODEL.
Subservient to all these sciences is history, which is a
record of facts in eveiy department of knlowledge.
The two clauses of this compound sentence are connected by the
relative pronoun "which," representing "history." The relative clautse
is not here restrictive, but rather explanatory, of "history," the antecedent of "which."
"History" is the subject of the leading clause, and "subservient,"
an adcljective in the predicate, is miodified by the phrase "to all these
sciences."
"AVhich" is the sublject of the adjective clause; "is" is the predicate, and "record" is a noun in the predicate, meaning the same thing
as "which," referring to "history."
"Record" is limited by the phrase " of facts"; "facts" by the
phrase "in every department"; and "department" by the phrase "of
knowledge."
In the arrangement of the independent clause, the verb "is" precedes its subject, for the purpose of placing "history," the antecedent,
as near the relative "which" as possible; -an important principle in
construction.
"Subservient" is an adjective in the predicate, compared by meore
and nzmost, expressing a quality asserted of "history," and limiting the
predicate "is."
"To" is a preposition, showing that a modifying relation exists
between "sciences" and "subservient," and connecting "sciences"
w,,;th the word it modifies.
"All" is an adjective pronoun, plural, and modifies "sciences."
"These" is a demonstrative adjective pronoun, plural number, and
204COIMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.                 -     20
modifies "sciences," pointing out particular sciences previously meationed.
"Sciences" is a noun; third, plural, neuter (why?); objective after
the preposition " to."
"Is," an irregular, intransitive verb, indicative, present, has the
particular form of the third, singular, as it is varied to agree with its
subject-nominative "history."
"History" is a common noun, third, singular, nominative, subject
of "is" (why?).
" Which" is a relttive pronoun, substituted for "history," and representing it in l)person and number; therefore third, singular; nominative case, and sul)ject of the verb "is."
"Is," parsed as the preceding "is," agrees with its subject-nominative
"which."
"A" is anl indefinite article, limiting "record."
" Record" is a common noun, third, singular, neuter (why?); predicate-nominative after the verb "is," meaning the same thing as
"which," the subject-nominative before it.
"Of" is a pi-reposition, conlnecting " facts," the limiting term, with
record," the word limited.
" Facts" is a niounI, third, plural, neuter, objective after the preposition " of" (why?).
"In" is a preposition, connecting "department" with "facts" in
the relation of a limiting word.
"Every" is an adjective pronoun; distributive, because it refers to
objects taken separately; it limits "department."
"Department" is a noun, common, third, singular, neuter (why?)
objective case, the consequent term of the relation, after the preposition "in."
"Of " is a preposition, connecting "knowledge" with "department,"
the noun that it limits.
"Knowledge" is a noun, third, singular, neuter, objective after the
preposition "of" (why?).

the pauses of the gale, thle mariner hears the voices of his children at their sports in his distawit home.  God has drawn the
lines of beauty and grandeur, with a pencil that never errs, on
the firamework of the hills and valleys, on cliff and streamn, on
sky and earth. In youthl the habits of industry are mrnost easily
acquired.  Graceful in youth are the tears of sympathy, and the
heart that melts at the tale of woe. The path of piety and vilrtue,
pursued with a firm and constant spirit, will assuredly lead to
happiness. Philip found difficulty in managing the Athenians,
from the nature of their dispositions; but the eloquence of Demosthenes was the greatest obstacle to his designs. All finery is
a sign of littleness. Manhood is disgraced by the consequences
of neglected youtlh. Instead of our being critics on others, let
us employ our criticism on ourselves.
RULE XVIII.
Pronouns must be of tlhe same person, number, and
gender as thle nouns whichl they represelnt; as, Henry
recited  to his teaclier.   Anna recited to her teachler.
Henry and Anna recited to their teacher.     Thou, William,
still art yotung.  You and I will go and see the boy, for
we know him.
REMARK 1. Two or more singular nounis, so connected as to be used
jointly, are represented by a plural pronoun; as, Virtue and vice have
their reward.
2. If the singular nouns so connected denote the same object, the
pronoun must be singular; as, This great statesman and patriot has
passed to his final rest.
3. When the singular nouns are so connected that each is taken
separately, or one to the exclusion of others, the pronoun is sinqgular
as, John or William will bring his book. Neither John nor WAilliam
will bring his book. John, not William, will bring his book.
4. W1hen one of the nouns is plural, the pronoun must be plural;
as, neither John nor his playmates could recite their lessons.
5. When either of the words is of the first person, the pronoun rep206COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
resenting it must be of the first person; but when the first person is
not used, and one of the words is of the second person, the pronoun
must be of the second person; as, You and I have recited our lessons.
You and John have recited your lessons.
6. When the singular nouns are preceded by a distributive, each, every,
either, neither, or no, the pronounl must be singtular; as, Each man
and each boy did his duty.
NOTE 1. In general, whenever two or more words are so connected, as subjects, that they require a plural verb, they should be represented by a plural
pronoun; if a singular verb, by a singular pronoun.
2. The same rule is to be observed with a collective noun, according as it
imlplies unity or plurality.
7. Relative pronouns, though not varied in form to represent their
antecedents, yet require verbs and pronouns agreeing with them to be
so varied as to correspond and agree with these antecedents; as, You
and I, who were present with otur sleds, began to coast.
8. A noun used figuratively requires the pronoun to agree with it
in gender, in the figurative sense; as, Next Anger rushed, his eyes on
fire, &amp;c.
9. Though the relative follows the person and number of its antecedent, yet it is independent of it in construction.
10. "It " is often used indefinitely, to initroduce a sentence or clause
havinig no antecedent expressed; sometimes it represents the topic of
discourse, and is really red(lundant, having in appl)osition wvith it a clause
or infinitive phrase, as the real subject of the verb; as, It is pleasant to
see the sun - To see the sun is pleasant. Here "to see the sun"11 is
really the subject, though "it" stands in that relation, having the infinitive phrase in apposition with it. It was evident that he understood
the subject-- That he understood the subject, was evident. Here,
again, the clause may be parsed as in apposition with the introductory
pronoun "it."  By omission of "it," and transposition, the clause becomes the grammatical subject of the verb "was."
MODEL.
Mary must call on the boy who was injured, as she
knows him.
This sentence consists of three clauses; the two first connected by
the relative "who."  The relative clause is here restrictive, and is usedCOMMION-SCHOOL GPIAMM I_Ro
in the relation of an adjective, limiting the noun "boy," which the relative "who" represents.
"As" connects the causal clause with the independent.
"Mary" is the subject; "must call," the predicate, is indirectly
limited by "boy," connected with "call" by the preposition "on."
Thus, "must call on the boy" is the modified predicate.
"Who" is the subject of the relative clause, and "was injured" is
the predicate.
" She" is the sutbject of the causal clause, "knows" is the predicate,
and " knows hihn" is the modified predicate.
Wiio is a relative pronoun, and represents" boy," its antecedent, in
person and numnber; therefore third, singular; nominative case, subject
of " was injured."
SHE is a personal pronoun representing "Mary," and of the same
person, gender, and number; therefore third, singular, feminine;
nominative case, subject of the verb "knows."
HIM is a personal pronoun, and represents "boy," its antecedent, in
person, number, and gender; therefore third, singular, masculine; objective case, and limits the transitive verb "knows."

208COMMON-SCHOOL GRPAMMAR.
RULE XIX.
A relative pronounll connects the adjective clause of
which it is a part, withl anothler clause which it modifies;
as, 1 hlave seen the man who bought our horse.
REMVNARK 1. The relative clause may be restrictive; as, Every teacher
must love a boy who is attentive and docile.
Or it may be explanatory; as, Behold the emblem of thy state in
flowers, which bloom and die.
Or it may express an additional circumstance respecting the antecedent; as, They made the long journey in covered carts, which served
also for lodgings by night.
NOTE 1. Instead of shich, we may substitute, in the last example, "and
they," or " ai.d the carts" served, &amp;c.
2. Ill each of these instanlces, the relative clause is an adjective.
2. What, and the compound relative pronouns, generally represent
two cases, as they contain in themselves both antecedent and relative,
being equivalent to two words, and thus forming a part of two clauses;
as, I know what he senlt - I know that (the thing, or things), which he
sent.
3. These pronouns are chiefly used when the antecedent is general
or indefinite, and they thus perform the office of two nouns: I saw
that which he brought.
4. When an antecedent is expressed, these pronouns perform the
office of an adjective pronoun in the antecedent clause, and of a noun
in the adjective clause: He sent whatever books he had.
MODEL.
Whoever wishles to excel must study diligently.
The two clauses of this sentence are connected by the compound
relative pronoun "whoever," equivalent to "he who" in this case, as
is indicated by the singular form of the verb "wishes"; as, "He must
study diligently who wishes to excel."
The relative clause "who wishes to excel" is used in the relation of
an adjective, limiting the pronoun "he," and restricting it to a particular class of persons.

MODEL.
I know not where you will find authority to ask wlhy
John wenit away whenl he was most needed.
This sentence contains four clauses - one independent, and three
dependent.
"I" is the subject of the leading clause; "know," its predicate, is
modified by the adverb "not," and has for its object the objective
clause "where you will find authority to ask."
The transitive verb "ask" takes for its object the objective clause
"why John wvnt awvay."
"Went," the predicate, is limited by the adverbial clause " when he
was most needed."
"I" is a personal pronoun, first, singular, nominative, the subject
of "know."
"Know" is an irregular, tranisitive verb; indicative, present, not
varied to agree in number and person with its subject.
"Not" is an adverb, modifying "know," and thus making the whole
proposition negative.
"Where" is a connective adverb, connecting the objective clause
with "know," which it limits.
"You" is a personal pronoun, second person, singular or plural,
nominative, subject of "will find."
"Will find" is a verb; irregular, transitive; simple active; indicative,
future; not varied in this tense by person and number.
"Authority" is a common noun, third, singular, neuter, objective,
and limits the transitive verb "will find," as its direct object.
"To ask" is a regular, transitive verb, having for its direct object the
objective clause "why John, &amp;c."; infinitive, present, and depends on
"authority," the noun that it limits.
"Why" is a connective adverb, connectinlg the clause in which it
stands with that which it limits.
"John" is a proper noun; third, singular, masculine, nominative
(why?); subject of "went."
"Went" is an irregular, intransitive verb; indicative, past; not
varied in this tense on account of the person and number of its
subject.
"Away" is an adverb, modifying "went."COMMONsSCHOOL GRAiVIMAR.

CLASSIFICATION OF WORD)S.
I_n the preceding pages, the various relations of' words, phrases,
and clauses have been treated of, and exemplified by models.
We have seen that one word may be substituted for another,
and miay thus represent it; and that the same word may be used
in the relations of different classes; as, a pronoun for a noun, a
participle for a noun or an adjective, anrd yet perfbrm the office
of a verb in taking a direct object.  All this requires no change
of mneaning in the words thus used.
It now remains to remark, that, as words are classed chiefly by
their grammatical office, the same word may be found ill several
classes; as, The calm shade shall bring a kindred calmnz.  Calm
yourself.  That man sings. The same mrnan that sings, plays on
the organ.  I told him that he must go.   William  not only
insulted, he even struck thle boy. Even WVilliam, whlo usually recites well, failed in his lesson.
FIGURES OF SYNTAX.
Three deviations from regular construction or arrangement
are of frequent occurrence in discourse.
ErLIPsIs is the omission of some part of a sentence, necessary
to complete the grammatical construction; as, I bought the book
at Crosby's (store).  He is older than John (is).
Most compound sentences afford examples of the use of ellipsis
for precision and euphony; it frees language from  useless and
u1npleasant repetition.
Ellipsis shouLld not be used( whlere it will cause obscurity or
weaken the force of expression.
PLEONASM, meaning a redundancy of words, is often found in
animatedcl discourse, to introduce a subject, to call attention to
a coming remark, or to increase emphatic force  as, The Pilg(rim
Fathers -where are they? The people, the people, sir, if weCOttO.-SCrfIOOL G,ISiGAMMAR.

It is also used sometimes to render the style more familiar.

This trespass of old Goody Blake,
HYPERBATON is an inversion of the natural arrangement of
words in a sentence; as, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!
It is most frequent in poetry; as,
Bright in her father's hall
Shields gleamed upon the wall;
Loud sang the minstrels all.
RHETORICAL FIGURES OF MOST COMMON OCCURRENCE    IN  DISCOURSE.
An authorized departure fromI the use of words is called a trope.
A simple trope is founded on a simnilarity of properties.
Simple tropes are divided into the synecdoche aniid mnetonymy.
SYNECDOCIHE is the use of a part for the whole, or the whole for a
part; as sail for ships.
METONYMY is a change of name. It gives one object the name of
another from some Peal or fancied relation: An address to the crownthe king.  Gray hairs for old age.
PERSONIFICATION is imputing life or intellect to inanimate objects
Next Anger rushed, his eyes on fire, &amp;c. We say of the sun, he shines
of the mooIn, she shines.
SIAIILE or comparison is founded on the resemblance of things compared; introduced by like, so, as: Life is like a sea; as fathomless, as
wide, as terrible.
METAPIOR recognizes the same resemblance, without the introductory
words:

PUNCTUATION.
Punctuation is the art of dividing discourse by certain
marks, to show, primarily, the grammatical construction; and,
secondarily, to indicate pauses, or modulations of the voice in
reading.
The principal punctuation miarks are the following, viz.:
Comma....., Period.............
Semicolon.....;         Interrogation mark...?
Colon........            Exclamation mnark...!
SEPARATION OF CLAUSES.
RULE 1. A complete declarative or imperative sentence, whether
simple or compound, takes a period after it.
Ex. M\an is mrortal. William, come here.
2. An interrogative sentence takes a mark of interrogation after it.
Ex. Who discovered America?
3. An exclamatory sentence takes a mark of exclamation after it.
Ex. What sighs have been wafted after that ship!
SEPARATION OF CLAUSES.
4. The independent clauses of a compound sentence are separated
by the semicolon.
Ex. Wake from     your false security; your cruel dangers,
your more crulel apprehensions, are soon to be renewed; the
wounds, yet unhealed, are to be torn open again.
2 16COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMIMAR.
REMARK. If the clauses are short and not subdivided, a comma is
often used.
Ex. William went to Boston, and John remained at home.
5. Clauses, having a common dependence, are separated from each
other by the semicolon.
6. Dependent clauses are separated from the clauses on which they
depend, by the comma.
Ex. I knew, that he told the truth.  When the farmer caile
down to breakfast, he declared, that his watch had gained half
an hour, in the night.
EXCEPTION. An adjective clause, when used restrictively, is not separated
from the clause on which it depends.
Ex. Never be ungrateful to one who loads you with benefits.
7. A dependent clause, incorporated in the clause on which it depends, commlonly takes a comlma before as well as after it.
Ex. The people, if we are true to them, will carry us gloriously through this struggle.
8. Correlative clauses are separated by the comma.
Ex. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.
ExcEPTION. If the correlative clauses are connected by "than " or "as,9
the comma is omitted.
Ex. He asked more than it was worth. Such men as they
are never prosper.
9. The omission of the predicate in one or more of the clauses of a
compound sentence is marked by a comma.
Ex. Reading makes a full man; writing, a correct man; and
sp(uiking, a ready man.
SEPARATION OF PHRASES.
10. Phrases, having a common dependence, and not subdivided, are
separated by a comma.
Ex. He is a man of learning, of profound thought, and of
character.

COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
REMARK. If either of the phrases is subdivided by a comma, they
are separated by a semicolon.
Ex. Let him draw, rather, a decorous, smooth-faced, bloodless demon; a picture in repose, rather than in action.
11. Phrases, used in apposition with words, are separated from the
rest of the sentence by commas.
Ex. Washington, the first president of the United States, was
called the father of his country.
PHRASES.
12. Phrases used absolutely are separated from the rest of the sentence by the comma.
Ex. To confess the truth, I was in fault.
13. A phrase, consisting of an adjective or participle indirectly limited, is separated from the rest of the sentence by a comma.
14. Inverted and intermediate phrases require the use of the comma, when its omission would leave their dependence doubtful.
In every period of life, the acquisition of knowledge is one of
the most pleasing employments of the human mind.
The acquisition of knowledge, in every period of life, is one
of the most pleasing employments of the human mind.
SEPARATION OF WORDS.
15. Two words of the same class, in the same construction, are separated by a comma when the connecting word is omitted.
Ex. A bold, bad man.
16. Three or more words of the same class, in the same construction, require a comma betweeni each particular.
Ex. Our purpose is higher, purer, nobler. William, John,
and Thominas were present.
17. Words, used independently, oi modifying whole clauses, are
separated from the rest of the sentence by the comma.
Ex. Sir, there is no longer any room for hope.  First, I shallCOM1MION-SCHOOL GRAIMMAR.
speak of the importance of obedience. The boy recites very well,
indeed.
NOTE. This rule applies to such words as "yea," "nay," "further," "again,"
&amp;c., and to such inseparable adverbial phrases as "in vain," "in general," &amp;c.
OTHER MARKS USED IN WRITTEN LANGUAGE.
The Apostrophe (') is used as a sign of the possessive case;
as, Johln's horse.
Also to note the elision of letters or syllables from some part
of a word, chiefly in poetry; as,
1st. From the beginning of a word, when it is called aphaeresis; as,'neatli for beneath, and'gan for began.
2d. From the middle of a word, where it is called syncope
(syn'co-pe); as, ne'er for never, e'en for even.
3d. From   the end of a word, where it is called apocope
(apoc'o-pe); as, tho' for though.
If the word elided is joined to another, making but one syllable ouLt of two, it is called synteresis; as,'twere for it were,
th' old for the old.
Dimaresis ( ) separates, in spoken language, two vowels joined
in written; as, cooperate.
The Hyplhen (-) connects compound words, as after-growth;
denotes a long vowel, as name; and is used at the end of a line
when part of the word begins the next line; as, run-ning.
The Dash (-) marks a sudden turn in sentiment, an abrupt
breaking, off unfinished, a sign for a lengthened pause, and an
addition to a common pause.
A Parenthesis ( ) encloses a remark, useful to the sense, but
not necessary to the grammatical construction; as,Know then this truth, (enough for man to know,)
Virtue alone is happiness below.
Brackets [ ] enclose words used in explanation, or correction
of a mistake, but not entering into the construction; as, Punc219COMMON-SCHOOL, GIRAMMAR.

3. The chief care in the use of the pronoun should be, that the hearer or
eader may find no difficulty in determining the noun for which it stands;
and this cautionI is needful chiefly in the use of the relative pronouns and the

PROSODY.
Prosody treats of quantity, accent, and versification.
VERSIFICATION is the arrangement in verse of a number and
variety of syllables, according to the laws of rhythm.
A VERSE is composed of feet, arranged according to measure
or metre.
Rhyme is the correspondence of the final sound or sounds of
one verse with that or those of another.
A line of poetry is called a verse.
A hemistich is a broken line.
A stanza is a number of verses so arranged as to make one
correspondent whole. It commonly has four, six, eight, or nine
lines.
A foot is two or three syllables, forming the essential part of
verse, arranged by accent and the want of it, answering to long
and short quantity.
A pause or cesura is a suspension of voice at the end of a line,
to indicate its termination, or in some part of it for harmony.
Scanning is separating verse into poetic feet.
Of the eight kinds of poetic feet, four have two syllables, and
four three syllables; as,--.19*

The fact that there is a Boston in England, as well as in Massachlusetts, or that there are several individuals who have an equal
right to thie name of John, or John Smith, does not prevent us from
regarding these nouns as a distinct class, since they do not receive
these names as the result of a process of generalization, but arbitrarily. Whenever it is necessary to distinguish betw-een objects
bearing the same individual namnes, we do it by such limitations as
are founa necessary. Thus, if we would distinguish between the
two places above named, we should write Boston, Alass., and Boston,
Eng. So, also, where several have the name John; one may be
John Smith, and another John Brown; and, if there happen to
be more than one John Smith in a certain locality, they may easily
be distinguished as senior, junior, or first, second, third, &amp;c. In
this case, the addition may be regarded as a part of the name.
44. Considered with reference to        this distinction,
nouns are divided into commonn and _proper.
45. A common noun is a name wvhich may be applied
to any individual of a class of objects; as, Ainimal,
mnan, river, mountain.
46. A  proper noun is a name        appropriated to an
individual object;    as, Daniel Webster, New         York,
Massachusetts.
REMARK 1. It follows, from the definition of a proper noun, that
it must be in the singular number.
2. A noutn naturally proper sometimes takes a plural termination, and becomes a common noun.
47. A proper -noun should alwvays begin withl a cap.
ital letter; as, James, Albany.
48. Acldjectives, derived from proper nouns, and corn.m
mo   t nlouns formed from  those adjectives, should begin
with capitals; as, English, Englislhman.
How are nouns dividled? What is a common noun? Whlat is a proper noun? HIow
should a proper noun always begin? What adjectives and common nouns shlould begin

and an unaccented half-foot.

Heroic verse is ever of ten or eleven syllables, except in
Hemistichs; but it occasionally admits an Alexandrine line of
twelve, or even of thirteen syllables
In the following lines there is a mixture of Heroic and Alexandrine verse, with single and double rhlyme.  The first is Heroic,
of eleven syllables; its feet are Trochee, lambus, two Anapests,
and an unaccented half-foot.  The second is mixed verse; it has
one Iambus and three Anapests. The third is mixed verse, of
thirteen syllables; it is an Anapestic, with an unaccented halffoot. The fourth is mixed verse, and contains an Iambus and
three Anapests.

MIXED MINOR VERSE.
Minor verse is neither Heroic nor Alexandrine, having less
than ten syllables.
In the following verses, the first foot is a Trochee, the rest
Iambic.

Or by a different divisionl it has a Pyrrhic, a Spondee, and an

And the I night' ra' I ven sings'.
POETICAL PAUSES.
There are two pauses, the final, and cesural. The final pause,
at the close of the verse, marks the measure.
The casural pause divides the verse into portions, equal or unequal, which may be two or more.
The final pause preserves the structure and melody of the
verse without marring the sense. It distinguishes poetry firom
prose, especially in blank verse.
The cesural pause is commonly used after the fourth, fifth, or
sixth syllable in heroic verse.  Ill Alexandrine it is chiefly used
after the sixth. Verses of less than ten syllables have not necessarily any full cesural pause, but may have one after any syllable.
After the fourth; as,
The silver eel" in shining volumes rolled.
After the fifth; as,
Round broken columns" clasping ivy twined;
O'er heaps of ruin" stalked the stately hind.
After the sixth; as,
Thus we the winged hours"/ in harmless mirth
And joys unsullied pass", till humid night,A benevolent deed' is the essence of beauty.
The semi-caesura forms a semi-pause with the full cesura.
When a verse takes the semi-cesura at all, it takes two, marked
here by single accents; as,COMMIYON-SCHOOL GRAMMSAR.
Glows' while he reads", but trembles' as he writes.
Reason' the card", but passion' is the gale.
Who heaves' old ocean", and who wings' the storm.
Heroic and Alexandrine verse may have the two semi-cesuras,
without a fill cosura; as,
Anld place' on good security' his gold.
Your own' resistless eloquence' employ.
That Philosophy', drawing from heaven' her birth,
Is the science' of healing the woes' upon earth.
EXAMPLES OF CESURAL PAUSES.
See the bold youth"' strain up the threat'ning steep,
Rush thiough the thickets", down the valleys sweep!
Not half so swift" the trembling doves can fly
When the fierce eaglet" cleaves the liquid sky;
Not half so swiftly" the fierce eagle moves
When through the cloudst" he drives the trembling doves.
Warms' in the sun"; refreshes' in the breeze;
Glows' in the stars", and blossoms' in the trees;
Lives' through all life"; extends' through all extent;
Spreads' undivided"; operates' unspent.
The full cesura and semi-casura in minor verse; as,
In peace", Love tunes' the shepherd's reed;
In war", he mounts' the warrior's steed;
In halls", in gay attire' is seen;
In hamlets", dances on the green.
Softly sweet" in Lydian measures,
Soon' he soothed his soul' to pleasures.
Soft is the strain"f when Zephyr gently blows,
And the smooth verse" in smoother numbers flows.
Round' a holy calm' diffusing,
Love of peace", and lonely musing.APPENDIX.

ABSTRACT NOUNS.
There is a class of objects, which we do not conceive of as having
anI independent existence, but as qualities of the objects to which
they belonlg.
These are called abstract nouns, because they are formed by
taking - abstracting - some quality from an object, and regarding
that quality alone, without reference to the object in which it is
found.
Thus, we say of an apple, it is sour; a lemon is sour, &amp;c. Now,
when we wish to speak of this quality, indicated by the adjective
sour, without reference to the apple or lemon, we give it the name
of sourness or acidity.
49. An abstract noun is the name of a quality considered  apart from    the object in which it is founld; as,
Goodness, wisdom.
COLLECTIVE NOUNS.
There is a class of nouns which deserve consideration from the
fact that, though in the singular form, they may be used in either
number, yet not without reference to the sense. They are called
collective nouns, and are to be regarded as sinlgular or plural according as they are used collectively or individually.
Sometimes we may use them either as singular or plural, and
convey essentially the same idea; as, The crew was saved; or, The
crow were saved. These two sentences express the same proposition,
and are equally correct grammatically.
What Is an abstract noun?
24APPENDIX.
GRAMMIATICAL ERRORS,
TO BE CORRECTED.
An offence against grammatical purity consists either in the
violation of a rule of Syntax, the violation of a principle in
Etymology, or in not using a word according to its true
meaning.
A fault in regard to construction- that is, the violation of
a rule of Syntax- is called a solecism.
A fault in regard to form or inflection  that is, the violation of a principle in Etyminology - is called a barbarism.
A fault in regard to the settled meaning of words is called
an impropriety.
REx. In the following exercises, let the pupil first make the correction,
and then state in what the offence consists.
EXAMPLES.
Between you and I, there is much truth in the report.
Corrected: "Between you and me," &amp;c.
A violation of the 17th rule of Syntax, -hence a solecism.
William has broke the chair.
Corrected: "William has broken the chair."
A violation of the etymological principle, that the "Perfect tense
is formed by prefixing have or has to the perfect participle,"hence a barbarism.
I learned him how to do it.
Corrected: "I taught him how to do it."
A fault in regard to the meaning of the word, - hence an im.
propriety.

In the first, the crew is spoken of as a unit, constituting thle force
by which the ship was managed.   In the second, reference is had to
the individuals constituting that force.
They differ from a common noun in this; that while a common
nouLn is the namle of each individual comnposing that class, a collective noun is the name only of the collection, and not of the individuals composing it.
Thus thle termn mran includes all mankind, and may be applied to
each individual composing the class. The term  senate, on the contrary, cannot be applied to each memnber. A nmember of the senate
is a senator.
50. A   COLLECTIVE lnouii is a name, whichi, though
it is in the sinlgular form, denotes more than one; as
Senate, sehool, flock, assembly, company, jury.
REMARK. It should be observed, that these distinctions of common, proper,
abstract, and collective, are not all formed on the saue principle of division.
Thus, an abstract noun is generally reckonied as a common noun also; while
a collective noun may be common; as, Army,- or proper; as, Congress.
EXERCISES.

mountain sweetness, William, school, class.
GENDER.
Every noun is the name of a male being. a female, or of an object
which is of neither sex.
On this distinction is founded gender.
51, Gender is a distinction of nounLs with regard to
sex.
What is a collective noun? Wha. t is genlert?
3COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
52. A  noun whlich     is thle  name    of a male is of the
masculine    gender; as, Jazctn, boy, represented         by  tihe
personal pronouns, he, his, him, or himself; as, The
ambition of George led him       to persevering     efforts, and
he has now attained his object.
53. A   noun whichl is the     name of a femnlale is of the
feminiine gender; as, oWoman, girl, represented by the
personal pronlouns, she, her, or herself; as, Anna -was
pleased with her skates, and sh.e is now        on tlle ice.
54. A  noun which is the      name of an      object neither
male   nor  female   is  of the   neater gender;       as, Table,
book, represented        by  the   personal pronouns, it, its, or
itself; as, The boat with its new       oars is now    ready for
Charles to try it.
REMIARK. In the English language we have nothing, or very little, of
what may be called grammatical gender, depending on inflexions.  The arti
cle and adjective no longer agree wvithl the noun in gender; and, for granmmatical purposes it is necessary to mialie this distinction, only so far as is
requisite to represent niouns of the third person, singular, by their appropriate
personal pronouns; as, Masculine, he, his, himn, himself; -Feminine, she, her,
herself;- Neuter, it, its, itself
55. There are a few nouns which are still used, more or less generally, with a masculine or feminine termination to denote sex; as,
Actor -   actress; instructor -  instructress; administrator -   administratrix.
56. In souse cases the distinction of sex is made by the use of
different words.
Thus, son and daughter indicate the same relation, and carry
with them, also, the sex of the person named.
When is a noun of the masculine gender? What forms of the personal pronoun are
masculine? When is a noun of the feminine gender? What tforms of the personal pronoun are femininxe? When is a noun of the neuter gender? What forms of the personal
pronoun represenit an object of the neuter gender? 1eow far do we apply the distinction
of gender grammatically? Do nouns ever vary their termination to denote sex? Give
an instance. In what other way is difference of sex denoted? Give an example.
26COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
27
57  Other nouns are common to both sexes; as, Cousin, child
parent, bird.
REMARK 1. The gender of these is sometimes determined by the personal
pronoun by which they are represented; as, My cousin has sold his horse.
Your cousin has left her school. Or, by an adjective; as, A male child - a
female child.
2. If the noun is in the plural, it may include either or both sexes, without any danger to grammatical accuracy, since the plural form of the personal
pronoun is the same in each gender.
EXERCISES.
DIaECTION. Tell the gende, of the following nouns, and what personal pronouns
will represent each.
Boy, sister, brother, knife, mother, husband, parent, chairs
child, bird, son, babe, sled, friend, uncle, dog, hat, scholar, table,
neighbor, floor, student, larnp, goodness, cousin, iron, ball, nephew,
aunt, cart, witness, girl, guardian, niece, boot, servant.
3. A pronoun of the masculine gender is used to represent one of a company composed of both sexes; as, in a school of boys and girls, we say, "Let
each pupil study his lesson."
4. The pronoun "it" is used to represent a young child, or any animal
whose sex is unknown to us; as, I saw the child as it slept quietly in its cradle. The hare is hunted for its flesh.
5. The pronoun "it" is often used irrespective of gender, espesially when
introductory; as, It was he; it was she; it was you; it was John; it was
Jane; it was a horse; it was the house; it is a table; it is a woman.
6. An animal of superior strength or courage is often represented by a
pronoun of the masculine gender; but a delicate or timid animal; by one of
the feminine gender; as, The elephant raised his trunk.  Go to the ant, thou
sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise.
7. When an inanimate object is personified; that is, spoken of as possessing some attribute of a living being, it is represented by a pronoun of the mas.
ouline gender, if its peculiar characteristic is power, strength, or sublimity; but,
Give an example of nouns common to both sexes. How is the gender of these sometimes determined? Is it necessary to regard gender in the plural? What pronoun is
used when both sexes are employed? I-ow is the pronloun " it" used?  How is " it  
used when introductory? What distinction is foundel on the qualities of aninals? What
pronout is used in personification?28                  COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
ii it is beauty, weakness, or delicacy, by one of the feminine genrder, as appears
in the following examples; as, Anger, death, despair, fear, revenge, sun,
tiie, winter, war, &amp;c., nmasculine; and earth, cheerfulness, fortune, hope,
melancholy, moon, music, nature, peace, pity, ship, spring, wisdom, &amp;c.,femmine; as, The sun was shorn of his beams.  The moon sheds her mild radiance
down.   Grim.-visaged svar hath smoothed his wrinkled front.    Next anger
rushed, his eyes on fire. Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden
hair.  First fear, his hand, &amp;c.  When music, heavenly maid, was young.
Revenge impatient rose; he threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down.
Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue.

NUMBER.
A noun, in its simple form, is the name of a single object; but
most nouns, by a change of form, express more than one; as, Boy,
bIoys; child, children. This distinction gives rise to number, as a
property of nouns.
58. Number is that distinction of nouns by which
they express one object, or more than          one; as, Apple,
apples.
59. There are two numbers, singular and plural.

"s" is added when it readily coalesces with the preceding letters.
[f, however, the singular end in the sound of "s," or' a modification of" s," that is, z, sh, ch, j, or x, the plural forms an additional
syllable in " es," pronounced " ez "; as, Maze, mazes; sash, sashes;

NOTE. Though this is general usage, yet we sometimes find the Misses
Porter, or the Misses Porters. The first is equivalent to the "Misses" by the
name of "Porter"; and in the latter case "Porters" may be parsed in apposition with " Misses."  Even in the latter instances, it would be better to
consider the two words as one name or phrase. The "Messrs Hunter" is frequently used.
20. In speaking of copartnerships, and of two or tnore indiv. duals holding office under the same official name, the title is made
plural; as, Messrs. Bates and Co., Messrs. Crosby, Nichols and Co,

White and Griswold, Lords Napier and Nelson. Here the names
are in apposition with the title.  But the title and names together
constitute a phrase, and should be parsed as such.

and is used as synonymous with effort.    Billiards, the name of a
game, is singular.
23. Usage is inclined to consider those words phlural that have a

24. The words cannon, cattle, head, pulse, sail, shot, weight,also, bodies of soldiers, as, cavalry, foot, horse, infantry,- though
singular in form, are often used in the plural; as, Twenty head of
cattle, six cannon, thirty sail of vessels.

CASE.
Nouns may sustain various relations to the other words in a
sentence.
Thus, a nuivn may stand as the subject of a sentence; as, John
rutns.  Or it may be the name of an object which receives the
action expressed by the verb; as, I saw the man. There are, also.
several other relations in which it may beused.
Case of nouns is founded on this susceptibility of being used ill
different relations.

noun sustains to the words with which it is gramnmatically connected; and is sometimes shown by its form.
67. There are three cases, namely: Nomlinative, Pos.
sessive, and Objective.
68. A  noun   used as the subject of a sentence, or in
apposition with the subject, or in the predicate, meaning the same thing as the subject, is in the nominative
case; as, Solon, the latvgiver, was a wise man.

possessive case; as, This is William's hat. These are
boys' shoes.

it is thle subject of the sentence, that of which something is asserted, therefore nominative ease.
Asking the question, " Who found his books? " and substituting
a pronoun for "John," the answer will be, " He found his books
Since "he" is the form for the nominative case, therefore John must
be in the nominative, as it is in the same case-relation.
"Found," the predicate of the sentence, one of the essential parts,
is used to assert something of " John," therefore it is a verb.
"His" is a pronoun, substituted for " John "; personal, as it has
a specialform to indicate the person; it has also the special form appropriated to the masculine gender, singular number, and third person, to represent the noun "John" in those particulars. It has
the form of the possessive case; thus, " His books" -" John's
books."
"Books" is a common noun, a name applied to any of a class;
destitute of sex, therefore of neither sex, that is, neuter gender;
plural, denoting more than one; third person, name of an object
spoken of.
When further advanced, the pupil may learn the cause of its
being in the objective case. Th-e fact may be learned by asking the
question, "Found what? " and answering it by a personal pronoun. The form of the appropriate pronoun will show its case,
and consequently that of the noun. The answer will be, "Found
them."  As "them" is the form of the pronoun appropriated to
the plural number, third person, and objective case, therefore
"books" must be in the objective case, since it has the same caserelation, though the noun has no special word-form for the objective.

The subordinate or accessory pltrts are "John's," denoting wfihos6
"dog' did the deed, and " him,' denoting the object affected by the
action, or whom the" dog bit."
As the word "John's" limits "dog" to a particular dog, of
which John is the owner, "John's dog" is the limited or mnodified
subject; and, as " him" limits the action uerformed by the dog to
a particular object, "bit him" is the limited or modified predicate.
JOHN's is a noun, the name of an object.
Proper, applied to a particular individual.
Masculine Genler, the name of a male being.
Singular Number, denotes one object.
Third Person, an obhject spoken of.
Possessive Case, denotes the relation of owner, also having an
apostrophe and s, the possessive sign; and, if the appropriate pronoun be substituted for the word "John's," it
will be "his," which, in the tables, is found in thepossessive case.
DoG is a common noun, any one of a class.
Masculine, denotes a male, though, as a generic term, it often
represeits either sex.
Singular, expresses unity.
Third Person, spoken of.
Nominative Case, subject of which something is asserted;
also, if a personal pronoun be substituted in the place of
"dog," it must be "he," which is the special form for the

VERB.
78. A verb is a word which may be used to assert
or affirm; as, John runs. William is writing. Henry
was loved.
REmrARK. The verb really asserts only when it is used in the indicative or
potential mood, and the sentence is in the declarative form. A verb in the
imperative or infinitive mood, or in an interrogative sentence, does not assert, but is capable of doing it when put in the indicative or potential mood
and declarative form.
REGULAR AND IRREGULAR.
79. Verbs considered with reference to tlle forinationll of their past tense, and their perfect participle,
are REGULAR or IRREGULAR.
80. A regular verb forms its past tense, and perfect
participle, by adding "ed" to the simple form           of the
present, or "d" only, when the verb ends in " e"; as,
Act, acted, acted; love, loved, loved.
REMARK 1. Verbs which change "y" to " i," and those which
double the Pual consonant, and add " ed," are considered regular;
as, Study, studied, studied; prefer, preferred, preferred.

COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMA R.
2 Nearly all the irregular verbs are of Anglo-Saxon origin, and
they formed their past tense, and perfect participle, according to
regular processes in that language. The only process now in force
is t]te regular formation.
3. Every verb, introduced from another language and anglicized,
sine the English has been regarded as a distinct language, has
taken the regular formation. Many verbs, also, which were formerly irregular, are now regular; as, Reach, raught, now reached;
bedeck, bedight, now bedecked.  --
81. An irregular verb does not form its past tense
and perfect participle by the addition of "ed" to the
simple form of the, verb, or "d" when' the verb ends
iD. " e   as, Go, went, gone; hear, heard, heard; give,
gave, given.
TRANSITIVE AND INTRANSITIVE.
82. Verbs are also divided, according to their power
of taking a direct object, into Transitive and Intransitive.
83. A verb which admits a direct object is transi.
tive'; as, I saw the man.
84. A verb which does not admit a direct object is
intransitive; as, John went to Boston.
REMARK I The word " transitive" means passing over, and a
transitive verb is so called, because the action, expressed by the verb,
seems to pass over from the subject to an object; while, in the use
of an intransittve verb, the action or being is spoken of only in its
relation to the subject.

the manner in which they are usecd; as, I returned from      the cuntry yesterday.   To-morrow I will return your book.
3. Verbs commonrly transitive, when used to express an action in
rtlTation merely to the subject, are regarded as intransitive.
Thus, ";The boy studies well." Here, studies is intransitive,
because it is the subjective actiun only to which attention is
directed.
NOTE 1. A transitive verb requires the pronoun directly modifying it to be
in the objectiveform; as, I struck him. Therefore, we say that a. noun, taking
the place of "him" as the direct object of "struck," is in the same case-relation; we call it the objective case, although there is no change in termnination,
no special form to show it; as, I struck John. I struck the man. He eats
them. He eats apples.
2. An intransitive verb will not allow an objective form of a pronoun to be
bubstituted for a noun, after it, without the expression of the connecting
preposition, showing the mnodifying relation to be that of the indirect object
as, John has gone home.
3. The noun in English is varied in form only in the possessive case, -the
nominative and objective forms being the same. The pronoun has commonly
three forms. It is easy, therefore, to decide the case of nouns, by substituting pronouns for them.

MODEL.
Clhildren should obey their parents.
The two principal parts of this sentence are the word "children,"'
3f which the assertion is made, and the phrase "should obey
wltich contains the assertion.
The idea set forth by the two essential parts of the sentence is
yeneral. Now, by taking a direct object for the action of the verb,
the obedience is restricted to one class of persons, "parents" only.
By introducing the word " their," representing " children," the
class of persons to be obeyed is limited to the " children's parents."
"Parents" and "their" are the subordinate or modifying parts of
the sentence; " their" modifying "parents," and "parents" modifying "should obey."
Thus "children" is the grammatical subject unmodified; that is,
as far as the subject " children" is concerned, it is general, not
restricted to good, bad, wise, ignorant, great, small, black, wthite, or
any other kind or class of "children."
"Should obey" is the graimmatical predicate, modified by the
subordinate expression "their parents"; and "should obey their
parents" is the modified predicate.
CHILDREN is a common noun, a name applicable to any of the
class.
Either masculine orfeminine, as it is applicable to either sex,
and, as here, may embrace some of each.
Plural, more than one.
Thlird Person, spoken of.
Nominative Case, the subject of the assertion. The answer to
the question, "Who should obey?" is " children "; or,
by substituting a personal pronoun of the third, plural,
the appropriate form will be "they," which is the special
form for the nominative case.
SHOULD OBEY is here used to assert, and is, therefore, a verb. The
principal parts of the verb are obey, obeyed, obeyed; formed
by adding ed, and therefore regular.
rt requires a direct object to complete the sense; as, "Should
obey what or whom?" Answer, "Should obey parents"
therefore it's a transitive verb.

COMMAON-SCHOOL G RAMMAR.
THEIR is a personal. pronotun, plural, and third person, to represent the nroun " children" in those two respects.     The
plural form is the same irrespective of gender; and we may
disregard yender except in parsing the third person, singular, of the personal proniouns.  Possessive case, as shown
by its special form.
PARENTS is a common noun, either masculine or feminine, herea including some of each':;lural, third, more than one, and
spoken of; objective case, as the direct object limiting the
action expressed by the transitive verb "should obey."  If
we substitute for " parents" the appropriate pronoun, it
will be "them," the special form    for the objective case;
therefore, we know the case-relation to be objective, though
the noun has no special formn for it.

ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VERBS.
The pe;fect participle of a transitive verb, when compounded with
the verb "be," in any of its moods and tenses, forms what is called
a passive verb; the distinguishing characteristic of which is, that
the subject of the sentence whose predicate is passive is the object of
the action expressed by the verb; as, John was struck by William
The subject is not the agent or doer of the action, butt the receivei
or object of the action.
How is a passiv -erb formed? What is its distinguishing characteristic?COMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.
85. A passive verb is a compound verb, forn ed             by
prefixing a form of the verb) "be" to the perfect parti.
ciple of a transitive verb; as, The mani was loved.
REMARK. This affords a convenient forimi for a sentence, when we would
assert what is done, but are unable, or do not wvish to name the author of the
action  as, The mischief was done.
86. A   verb   is called active when       its grammatical
subject is the name of the agent or doer of the action
expressed     as, "John    loved his parenrts;" "William
was injuriing himself."
PROGRESSIVE FORM.
When tfe imperject participle of a verb is compotlnded with the
verb " be" in any of its moods and tenses, the comupound verb is
said to be in the progressive form.
The verb so formed is nearly equivaLlent to the simnple active formr
in the sanme mood and tense, but generally has nore distinct reference
to time  as, He singys, he is singing.  [Lere, the first sentence is used
to express his ability to sing, or a habit of singing; whlile the latter
is used more commonly to assert that he is now engaged in the act.
This distinction, however, does' lnot always hold good.
87. A verb formred by prefixing a form        of tie verb
"be" to the imperfect participle of a simple verb, is
said to be in the progressive form; as, John is running.
1. An intransitive verb, when colmpounded with a preposition,
may be used in the PASSIVE fo)rm; as, We were looked upon by them
as traitors, -that is, we were regarded by them as traitors. In the
active voice, it would be written, They looked upon us as traitors.
2: Sonme intransitive verbs are used eithler in the active or passive
formn, without a corresponding change in their subjects, as acting or
acted on; as, John has come, or John is comine.

progressive form? When may an intransitive verb be used in the passive form? Ex

In these several wvays, males;ecs or mo.ods, a verbl) may ke used to
assert an act or power, to express a condition or command, or to limi
an assertion.
NOTE. it will be perceived that "John wenrt," and "   John went," have
the same modal form, and that the conditio, does not depend on the form of the
verb; but is expressed solely by the conjunction "if," which is the only difference between the two expressions.. The Subjunctive, as a separate mood,
requiring a special form, is going out of use; it now retains no special
modal form, except in the verb "be."
88. Mood is the MANNER in which the actionl or being
is represented; as, John, go. John wenlt.
89. The INDICATIVE       mood    is that formn    of the   verb

92. Tlhe SUBJUNCTIVE mood is that form             of the verb,
whicll is used to express a colndition, or supposition;
as, Were the story true, his course mighit be justified.
REMARK 1. This mood has no special modalform except in the anomalous verb "be," used either as principal, or as auxiliary to make
the progrssive and passive forms. Two forms are given as peculiar
to this mood, be and were. But be is clearly an Indicative or Poten.
tial form  abbreviated by ellipsis; and the Past were is just like the
Indicative Pat, except in the first and third persons singular, and
in the Ancient form; as,
Indicative Past - I was, thou wast, he was.
Subjunctive Past I were, thou wert, he were.
So that the Subjunctive has really but one peculiar form in Common Style, and one in Ancient Style. Even these are seldom used
by writers of the present day.
2. A dependent, subordinate, or subjoined clause, connected with
some other part of the sentence by a clausal conjunction, if, thoug.4,
unless, lest, except, provided, or provided that, has usually been considered as having its predicate in the SuLbjunctive mood.  Thus, the
conjunction and predicate together have stood as the modalform of
the Subjunctive.   So, that any form of the Indicative or Potential, used as the predicate of a clause made dependent and connected
with another by one of the foregoing conjunctions, would be in the
Subjunctive mood,
NOTE. If a verb is to be parsed as in the Subjunctive, or dependent mood,
when it is predicate of a clause connected with another by either of the foregoing conjunctions, the paradigm of the Indicative and Potential may be
used, to save repetition. It is rather with reference to the writings of the
past than to present usage, that the Subjunctive retains a place in grammar

93. The INFINITIVE mood is that form of the verb
which is used to express being or action without
limitation of number and person; as, John intends
to go.
REMARK 1. The participle is a form of the verb, denoting the
state of being or action, as, continuing or unfinished, and as cornmvlete and finished, without reference to tense or time. Thus, the
imperfect (continuing or unfinished) participle may be used with
every form of the verb "be," present, past, andfuture, indifferently.
So, too, the perfect (finished) participle may be used with the same.
2. There are three participles, the Imperfect, Perfect, and Compound Perfect.
3. The IMPERFECT participle is formed by adding ing to the simple
form of a verb; as, Love, loving; run, running; die, dying.
4. The PERFECT participle of regular verbs has the same form
as the past tense. In irregular verbs the form may be found in the
tables; as, Loved. run, died.
5. The COMPOUND PERrFECT participle is formed by prefixing having
to the Perfect participle; as, Haviny loved, having run, having died.

returned. John may have studied his lesson, but it was recited
poorly. If he were all; -  remember haughty Henry.    William
may go, but John must stay at home.
TENSE.
The form of the verb usually indicates time. Thus, the sentence
"I walk" predicates the act of walking at the present time. "1
walklced" predicates the same act in past time.  "I shall walk"
predicates the same act infuture time.
The form of the verb may also denote either incomplete or finished
action. Thus, "I am walking" predicates an act as unfinished or
imperfect. "I have been walking" predicates the same act as completed or perfect. It. is on these two facts of grammar that tense is
founded.
REMARK 1. The PRESENT tense predicates unfinished action at the
present time. It might properly be called the imperfect present.
2. The PAST tense predicates unfinished action at a past time. It
might be called the imperfect past.
3. The FUTURE tense predicates unfinished action in future time.
It might be called the imperfect future.
4. The PERFECT tense predicates action finztshed at the present
time. It might be called the present perfect.
5. The PLUPERFECT tense predicates action finished at a certain
past time. It might be called the past perfect.
6. The FUTURE PERFECT predicates finished action at afuture time,
and is rightly named.
NOTE 1. This is, undoubtedly, the true theory of the tenses, as may be seen
by applying it to the Indicative mood, in simple sentences.
What indicates time? What else does the form of the verb denote? On what is tense
founded?  What does the present tense predicate? - the past? - the futule? - the
perfect? What does the pluperfect tense predicate, and what might it be called?

94. Tense marks distinctions of time, and completeness or incompleteness of action.
95. The PRESEiNT tense denotes present time and incomplete action; as, I see.   I am writing.    I am heard.
96. The PAST tense denotes past time and incomplete
action; as, You saw. He was writing.        The noise was
heard.
97. The FUTURE tense denotes future time, without
reference to the completeness of the action; as, They
will see.  You will be writing.        The skates shall be
mended.
98. The PERFECT tense denotes that the action is
finished at thle present time; as, John 7has written. He

by the pupil.
A subject of the singular number and third person, requires a
change in the form of the verb, when it is in the present or perfect

though used only in the second person, singular, is now exclusively
appropriated to the Ancient or Solemn Style.

the number and person of its subject only in the present and perfect tenses of the Indicative mood.

Present, he loveth or doth love. Perjfect, he uhath loved.
4. The auxiliaries do and did are used for emphasis, and in asking questions; in the latter case, they precede the subject; as, John did go. Did
John go? Also, do is used in the Imperative mood, in entreaty and supplica.

111. Conjugation of the regular, transitive verb~
LOVE, in its severalforms.
PRINCIPAL PARTS.
Present- love.    Past -  loved.  Perfect Participle -loved.
REMARK. Three forms are used actively; namely, the simple, emphatic,
and progressive; and one form passively, by the use of the perfect parti
ciplewith the auxiliary "be." The emphatic form is made by using the auxiliaries do and did with the simple form of the verb; consequently there are
only two tenses in this form, the Present and Past of the Indicative. The
Imperative mood uses do in emphatic entreaty or supplication.
The following is a synopsis or connected view of these four forms
of the verb love.

out; and the hopes of the red man will soon be extinguished.
This sentence is composed ^r three independent clauses, connected
by "and" implied between the first two, and expressed between
the last two. The subjects are "war-cry," " council-fire," and
"hopes; " the predicates, "has ceased," "is going," and "will
be extinguished."
"HAS CEASED" is a verb used here to assert of" war-cry" its cessation. Principal Parts, cease, ceased, ceased. Regular, forms its Past
tense and Perfect participle by adding d only, as the simple verb
ends in e silent. Intransitive, does not require an object to receive
its action. Active, as its subject is the agent or doer, not the receiver of the action. Indicative mood, simply expresses or declaresCOMMON-SCHOOL GRAAMMAR.
the action. Perfect tense, predicates action fitntshed at the present
time. As its subject, " war-cry," is third person, singulalr, the verb
becomes " has ceased," instead of'" have cetasd," being in one of
the only two tenses varied on account of the person and number of
the subject.
" Is GOING" is a verb, used here to assert something of its subject,
council-fire."  Principal Parts, go, went, going, gone. Irregular,
does not form its Past tense and Perfect participle by adding ed to
the simple form" go." ilntransitive, admitting, no direct object to
limit or modify its action. Progressive form, denotes definitely an
unfinished and continuing action. Indicative mood, simple declaration or assertion. Present tense, denotes present time and incomplete action. The Progressive form is made by prefixing some part
of the auxiliairy verb " be " before the imperfect participle of any
verb. As its subject is third person, singular, the verb takes the
form "is going," which is the one appropriated to that person and
number.
" WILL BE EXTINGUISHED" is a verb, here used to assert the
destruction of " hopes," its subject. Principal Parts, extinguish,
extinguished, extinguishing, extinguishled.  Regular, forms its Past
tense and participle by adding ed to the simple formn. Transitive,
requires an object to receive its action. Passiveform, as " hopes,"
the object of the action, and receiver of it, is here the subject-nominative of the verb.  Indicative mood, simple assertion.  Future
tense, denotes future time. Its subject " hopes " is third person,
plural; but a verb in this tense in common style is not varied on
account of the person and number of its subject.

In this compound sentence the dependent and subordinate clause
is connected with the independent claluse hy the conjunction "if"
implied; as, "' Were John successful "-if John were successful=
if John should be successful, &amp;c.
"It," suLbstituted for the clause containing the suLpposition, is
the subject, unmodified, of the independent clause, and " might
render " is the predicate, which is directly modified by " him," and
"himn" by " anxious," and " anxious" indirectly by the phrase
"to try again."  The modified predicate. then, is all of the clause
except the subject" it."
"John" is the subject of the subordinate or dependent clause,
and "were" is the predicate, which is modified by "successful; "
the quality denoted by " successful " is asserted of John in the
predicate, instead of being assumed. " John" is a proper ntun,
name of an individual; masculine gender, of a male being; sinygvtar, of one; third personl, spoken of; nominative case, because it is
the subject of the assertion, and if a personal pronoun be substituted
for "John" the appropriate form will be " he," which is the sp)e..
cial form for the nominative of that gender and number.
"Were,"' the predicate of the subjoined clause, is used to assert,

"Might render" is a verb, here used to assert. Principal parts,
Present render, Past rendered, Perfect Participle rendered. Regular,

89PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON LANGUAGE.
Nr    is so constituted that it is not good for him to be alone.
The wants of his physical, intellectual, and moral nature, show that
he was intended for society. Some method of communicating thoughts,
feelings, desires, purposes, &amp;c., would, consequently, be necessary; otherwiie, though surrounded by those of his own kind, he would lose much
of the benefit to be derived from social intercourse.
The first efforts to communicate we may suppose to have been by natural signs, consisting chiefly of gestures and changes in the expression
of thlo countenance. This means of communication would, however, be
very limited, and often cumbersome.
In order, then, to extend the power of communicating, as well as to
render it-easier, the sound of the human voice, with its wonderful powers
of modulation, would afford a convenient and flexible instrument. It
was, probably, in some such way as this that artificial language was
formed; affording, at the same time, the means and the sign of intellectual and moral development in the race.
Among the first efforts to communicate by the voice, simple sounds,
and combinations of sounds, would naturally be used as names of sensible objects; so that the utterance of these sounds would recall the image
or conception of an object when it was no longer present to the sense.
Hence the noun, one of the most important parts of speech.
At a very early stage in the development of language it would become
necessary to comrmunicate the actions or doings of men, animals, &amp;c.,
and to make some assertion respecting the objects which had been named.
This would give rise to another important class, called verbs. With theseCOMMON-SCHOOL GRAMMAR.

REMARK.   I-lere the article a or an restricts to one book or apple,
but is indefinite as to what book or apple. It is equivalent to the
word "any," restricted to the singular number.
137. The Definite article the limits nouns to particular objects; as, Give me the book or books.
REIMARK 1. Give me the book or books= Give me this or that
book, or these or those books. Here the article "the" is nearly
equivalent to the demonstrative adjective pronouns this or that, these
or those.
2. A is used before a word beginning with a consonant sound; as,
A man, a boy, a union, a young man, a eulogy, a wonder, a useful
person, many a onie, such a use, a yew tree, a ewer.
3. An is used before a word beginning with a vowel sound, or the
sound of h when the accent is on the second syllable; as, An ox, an
apple, an hour, an honorable man, an heroic exploit, an historical
fact.
4. A, though singular, is often used before an adjective of number; as, A few men, a great many men.
5. A noun used without an article is unrestricted, and is generally taken in ite widest sense. Thus, the word man, without an
article before it, stands for mankind or the human raee. Sometimes
tlhe use of the article gives a general signification; as, The horse is
a useful animal = horses are useful animals.

" Them" modifies " visit " as a direct object limiting its action.
"They" is the subject, unmodified, of the second clause. " Are
