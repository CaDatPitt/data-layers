7. Read in a pleasant tone.

-If you do this, peopleiwill listen with interest and pleasure as they do to
music, and the thoughts and feelings you utter, will sink deep into their
hearts. If you read in‘ a harsh, affected, whining, groaning, or squeaking
tone, people will not listen, or if they do, they will dislike your manner, and
what you read. *

8. Adapt your tone of Voice to what you read.

If the piece you are reading is gay and lively, let your voice be cheerful.

‘ Iﬁit is melancholy or sad, let your tone be plaintive or pathetic._ ‘

i 9. Let your countenance correspond with the
sentiment of what you read.

If the piece you are reading is serious or mournful, you should not have a
smile u on our countenance - and on the other hand, ou should not have a
p Y _ 2 . 2_ Y
long face, when reading that which is playful or gay.

10. Let the degree of rapidity with which you
read be adapted to the sense. 

A solemn piece, should be read slowly and deliberately; a lively one, should
be read more briskly. The manner, in this respect, should suit the ideas; but
never hurry on the ,one hand, or drawl on the other; but remember, that
young persons are always apt to read too fast. Be always one your guard
against this fault.

11. To read easily, stand erect and draw the
shoulders back. as

This will bring the breast forward, and give the lungs an opportunity‘ to

play freely. Do not hold your book between yourself and your hearers, for it

will "deaden your voice.

12. Before beginning, draw in a full breath.

This isan important rule. Young beginners are apt, from hurry and agi-
tation, to begin without attention to this rule, and consequently become

‘exhausted and out of breath before they. get half through. The chief diﬂi-
i culty in observing this rule arises from the embarrassment to which the young

beginner is liable, as I have stated above. /
13. Avail yourself of every pause in reading,
to replace the breath already expended.

‘In this way, you will be enabled, not only to read with effect, but without
fatigue. ' It is very common to see an inexperienced reader actually unable
to enunciate the latter part of a sentence, from mere want of breath in the
lungs sufficient to produce an intelligible utterance. In order to follow this
rule, learn to read slowly ; for reading fast will take away the voice as
eﬁfectually as running fast.

l4.iA good reader always acquires the habit

of looking alittle way in advance, as he reads. ,

LESSON XLV. Mercy.

1. THIS is benevolence, mildness, or tenderness of heart,

' and disposes a person to overlook injuries, or to treat an of?-

fender better than he deserves.
“ Mercy, is twice blessed ;—

It blesseth him that gives andvhim that takes.
’T is mightiest in the mighty ; it becomes

The throned monarch better than his crown.
His sceptre shows the source of temporal power,
The attribute of awe and majesty,

Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above the sceptred sway.

It is enthroned in the heart of kings.

It is an attribute of God himself! »

And earthly power doth then show likest God’s,
When mercy seasons justice.”

2. .But this beautiful virtue may be also exercised by us
all in the common intercourse of society, and be thus twice
blessed, blessing “ him that gives and him that takes.” Let
young persons, therefore, be taught to be kind and -gentle to
all around them. , Let every act of cruelty,,whether wanton
or malevolent, be rebuked ; let them be required to observe
this rule even toward the brute creation.

3. The Scripture says, that “ the merciful man regardeth

the life of his beast.” If, therefore, you would educate your- -

self thoroughly in this virtue, habitually exercise it even
towards insects, and birds., and quadrupeds, and everything

that can feel.

MERCY. I 99

4. It is lawful to make these creatures subservient to our
pleasure and our comfort, and to. this end we may take their
lives; but we may never wantonly subject them to pain, or
deprive them of existence. If we do this, we not only com-

mit sin, but cultivate the spirit of cruelty in our own hearts.

5. There is one trait of character in our American boys,
which I think deserves to be checked ; and, that is a dispo-
sition which leads to- an incessant war on familiar birds and
the lesser quadrupeds. As soon as a boy can hurl a stone, he
becomes a Nimrod, and goes forth as a mighty hunter
against the blue-birds, cat-birds, swallows, and robins, that
venture into our gardens, orchards, and ﬁelds.

6. Not even the little Wren, that comes with his fair
offer of a dozen beautiful songs a day, for the rent of
some nook or cranny about the house, is safe from the
whizzing missile. Not even the little sparrow, that would

.build beneath your window, is tolerated. Not even the lit-

tle ground squirrel, that enlivens the Woods, is permitted to

. eat his nut in safety.

'7. And when the boy becomes a youth, the same exter-
minating war is ‘carried on, though with a different weapon.
With the fowling-piece in his hand, he roams the orchard
and _the ﬁeld, slaughtering, without discrimination, jays,
woodpeckers, sparrows, blackbirds, bob-o-links, and the rest
of the feathered family,

8. Now, is not this all wrong’! Does not this partake of
cruelty’! And, besides, is it not obvious folly’! For my

own part, I love to see the birds enlivening’ the landscape. ,

The rigor of our climate drives them away for half the
year, but I mourn when they are gone, and rejoice at their
return. They are a great resource to those who will observe
them. _

9. Their songs, however varied, are always beautiful.
Their forms, habits, and capacities are themes of interesting
study. It is delightful to see them building their nests,
rearing their young, pursuing their food, and displaying
their various musical gifts. . ‘ ‘

10. Why, then, should we drive these. creatures away’!
Some of them, it is true, are thieves, and take more cherries
and corn than we are willing to spare them; and I approve
of necessary scarecrows and suitable pelting in these cases.
But why banish the whole feathered race, most of whom

100 THE THIRD READER.)

are not merely innocent, but absolutely useful ‘in diminish-
ing the number of noxious insects ’!

II. It is not so in other countries. In England, birds
generally are protected and cherished, I do not speak now
of pheasants, partridges, and other game, which are sheltered
in the parks, and preserved from all but his lordship’s shot;
but, throughout the whole country, the sparrows, bulﬁnches,
goldﬁnches, thrushes, blackbirds, and other little songsters,
are permitted to live almost without molestation. - They are
seen by hundreds in every hedge and field. ’

12. Many of them are almost domesticated around the
houses ; and even in the cities, such as Liverpool, Manches-
ter, Birmingham, Lndon, and others, amid the smoke of
coal, the din of factories, and the throng of people, you see
thousands of these little-birds. In the heart of an English
city I have sometimes waked up in the morning, and, from
the bursting melody of ﬁnches and sparrows around, have
imagined myself to be in the country.

13. Why is it that our custom in respect to birds is so
different in America’! Have we’ derived from our fathers’
a spirit of extermination’! Because the first settlers of this
country cut away the forests, slaughtered the Indians,
smote the bear and the bison, hunted down the panther
and the wolf; have we derived from them. a spirit of
extirpation, which, now that the monsters of the forest are
slain, is given up by men, but lives in our children, and
vents itself oncat-birds and sparrows’? .

15. I know not; but, be this as it may, I mourn over the
solitude which is gradually gathering over the landscapes of
our country, from the absence of the feathered songsters;
and I mourn over that spirit of wanton cruelty, which makes
man the enemy, instead of the friend, of harmless birds.

CHEERFULNESS. 101

LESSON XLVI. Cheerfulness.

1. OF allthe virtues, cheerfulness is the most proﬁtable.
It makes the person who exercises it happy, and renders
him acceptable to all he meets. While other virtues defer
the day of recompense, cheerfulness pays down. It is a
cosmetic,.which makes homeliness graceful and winning; it

_ promotes health, and gives clearness and vigor to the mind.

2. It is the bright weather of the heart,.in contrast to
the clouds and gloom of melancholy. It is particularly sus-
ceptible of cultivation by exercise and repetition. It is in-
fectious, and may be communicated to all around.

3. I-have seen a bright-faced childrin the midst of a fam-

. ily, over whom some shadow of dulness was creeping,

suddenly disperse the clouds, and bring a clear sunshine

_upon the whole. group. Such a child" in a family is worth his

weight in gold.

4. Dr. Paley remarks, that “ ours is a happy world, after all.
The air, the earth, the water, teem with delighted existence.
In a spring noon or a summer evenirig, on whichever side I
turn my eyes, myriads of happy beings crowd upon my
view. ‘ The insect youth are on the wing.’ Swarms of new-
born ﬂies are trying their pinions in the air.

5. “ Their sportive motions, their wanton mazes, their gra-
tuitous activity, their continual change of place without use
or purpose, testify their joy, and the exultation which they
feel in their lately-discovered faculties. /A bee amongst the
ﬂowers in spring is one of the most cheerful objects that
can be looked upon.

6. “Its life appears to be all enjoyment ; so busy, and so
pleased; yet it is only a specimen of insect life, with which,
by reason of the animal being half domesticated, we happen
to be better acquainted than we are with that of others.

7. “The wholewinged insect tribe, itis probable, are
equally intent upon their proper employments, and, under
every variety of constitution, gratiﬁed, by the oﬂices which
the Author of their nature has assigned to them._ ;

8. “ But the atmosphere is not the only scene of enjoyment
for the insect race. Plants are covered with aphides, greed-
ily sucking their juices, and constantly, as it should seem,
in the act of sucking. It cannot be doubted, but that this is

. gas

mg q   THE THIRD READER.

a state, of gratiﬁcation. What else should ﬁx them so close
to the operation, and so long’!

9. “ Other species are running about, with an alacrity in
their motions, which carries with it every mark of pleasure.
Large patches of ground are sometimes half covered with
these brisk and sprightly natures. If we look to what the
waters produce, shoals of the fry of ﬁsh frequent the mar-
gins of rivers, of lakes, and of the sea itself. -

1 10. “ These are so happy, that they know not what to do
with themselves. Their attitudes, their v_ivacity, their leaps
out of the water, their frolics in it, which I have noticed a

thousand times with equal attention and amusement, all con-

duce to show their excess of spirits, and are simply the ef-
fects of that excess.

11. “ Walking by the seaside, in a calm evening, upon a
sandy shore, and with an ebbing tide, I have frequently
remarked the appearance of a dark cloud, or rather very

" thick mist, hanging over the edge of the water, to the height,

perhaps, of half a yard,:and of the breadth of two or three
yards, stretching along the coast as far as the eye could
reach, and always retiring with the water. .

12. “ When this cloud came to be examined, it proved to
be’ nothing else than so much space, ﬁlled with young
shrimps, in the act of bounding into the air from the shallow
margin of the water, or from the wet sand. If any motion
of a mute animal could express delight, it was this. If they
had meant to make signs of their happiness, they could not
have done it more intelligibly. , ‘

13. “ Suppose then, what I have no doubt of, each individ-
ual of this number to be in a state of positive enjoyment;
what a sum, collectively, of gratiﬁcation and pleasure have
we ‘here before our view. .

14. “The young of all animals appear to me to receive
pleasure simply from the exercise of their limbs and, bodily
faculties, without reference to any end to be attained, or
any use to be answered by exertion. A child, without
knowing anything of the use of language, is in a. high de-
gree delighted with being able to speak. Its incessant rep-
etitjon of a few articulate sounds, or, perhaps, of the single
word which it has learned to pronounce, proves this point
clearly. , 1

‘ 15. “ N oris it less pleased with its ﬁrst successful endeav-

ors to walk, or rather to run, which precedes walking, al-
though entirely ignorant of the importance of the attainment
to its future life, and even without applying it to any present
purpose. A child is delighted with speaking, without having
anything to say ; and with walking, without knowing where
to O. .

$6. “ And, prior to both these, I am disposed to believe,
that the waking hours of infancy are agreeably taken up
with the exelrcise of vision, or perhaps, more properly ‘speak-
ing, with learning to see.

17. “ But it is not for youth alone, that the great Parent of
creation hath provided. Happiness is found with the purr-
ing cat no less than with the playful kitten; in the arm-
chair of dozing age as well as in either the sprightliness of

I the dance or the animation of the chase.”

18. No one canread this passage without perceiving its
truth, and deducing the inference, that life is bestowed as a
beneﬁt by the Creator, on the tenants of the earth, the air,
and the sea, on ﬁshes, insects, birds, and quadrupeds. And
is man the only exception to this beneﬁcence’? ‘

19. Is life a good to all beside, and a ‘ curse to man V’!
There seems to me to be impiety in the very thought. Let
us look, then, upon life as it really is,—a great and good
possession, -—- good, not only as the means of preparing us
for another and better world, but good‘ in itself; a path
leading to another country, but still a pleasant path.

20. Such are the true views to be taken of life, and we
ought to support, cultivate, and cherish a spirit of cheerful-
ness, by the habitual contemplation of our present existence
in this aspect. '

LESSON XLVII. The Grizzly Bear.

1. THE grizzly bear is the only formidable quadruped of
our continent. He is the favorite theme of the hunters of
the far West, who describe him as equal in size to a common
cow, and of prodigious strength. He makes battle if as-
sailed, and often, if pressed by hunger, is the assailant.

2. If wounded, he. becomes furious, and will pursue the
hunter. His speed exceeds that of a man, but is‘ inferior to
that of a horse. In attacking, he rears himself on his hind
legs, and springs the length of his body. Woe to horse or
rider that comes within the sweep of his terriﬁc claws,
which are sometimes nine inches in length, and tear every-
thing before them. if ' p

3. At the time of which we are treating, the grizzly bear
was_still frequent on the Missouri, and 'in_ the lower country;

‘ but, like some of the broken tribes of the prairies, he has

gradually’ fallen back before his enemies, and is now chieﬂy
to be found in the upland regions, or rugged fastnesses, like
those of the Black Hills and the Rocky Mountains.
4. Here he lurks in caverns, or holes which he has dig-
ed in the sides of hills, or under the roots and trunks
of _fallen trees. Like the common hear, he is fond of fruits,
and meats, and roots, the latter of which he will dig up
with his fore claws. He is carnivorous, also, and will even
attack and conquer the lordly buffalo, dragging his huge
carcass to the neighborhood of his den, that he may prey
upon it at his leisure.
5. The hunters, both white and red men, consider this
the most heroic game. They prefer to hunt him on horse-

back, and will venture so near as sometimes to singe his"

hair with the ﬂash of the riﬂe. The hunter of the grizzly
bear, however, must be an experienced hand, and know
where to aim at a vital part; for, of all quadrupeds, he is
the most diﬂicult to be killed. He will receive repeated
wounds without ﬂinching, and rarely is a shot mortal unless
through the head or heart. . ‘ '

6. That the dangers to be apprehended from the grizzly
bear are not imaginary, may be gathered from the following
account. Among the hired men of one'~'of the hunting
expeditions, was William Cannon, who had been a sol-

dier at one of the frontier posts, and entered into the em-
ploy of Mr. Hunt at Mackinaw. He was an inexperienced
hunter and a poor shot, for which he was much bantered by
his more adroit comrades. Piqued at their raillery, he had
been practising ever since he had joined the expedition, but
without success. .

7. In the course of the present afternoon, he went forth
by himself to take a lesson in shooting, and, to his great de-
light, had the good fortune to kill a buffalo. As he was a
considerable distance from the camp, he cut out the tongue
and some of the choice bits, made them‘into a parcel, and,
slinging them over his shoulders by a strap, passed round his
forehead, as the Voyageurs carry packages -of goods, set out
all glorious for the camp, anticipating a triumph. over his

brother, hunters. ,

8. In passing through a narrow ravine, he heard a noise be-
hind him ; and looking round beheld, to his dismay; a grizzly
bear in full pursuit, apparently attracted‘ by the scent of the
meat. Cannon had heard so much of the invulnerability of
this tremendous animal, that he never attempted to fire, but,
slipping the strap from his forehead, let go the buffalo meat,
and ran for his life. The bear did not stop to regale him-
self with the game, but kept on after the hunter.

_9._ He had nearly overtaken him, when Cannon reached a
tree, and, throwing down his riﬂe, scrambled up it. The
next instant, Bruin was at the foot of the tree; but, as this
species of bear does not climb, he contented himself with
turning the chase into a blockade. Night came on. In the
darkness Cannon could» not perceive whether or not the en-
emy maintained his station ; but his fears pictured him rig-
orously mounting guard. He passed the night, therefore, in
the tree, a prey to dismal fancies.

10. In the morning the hear was gone. Cannon warily
descended the tree, gathered up his gun, and made the best
of his way back to the camp, without venturing to look
after his buffalo meat.

11. While on this theme, we will add another anecdote of
an adventure with a grizzly bear, told of John Day, the
Kentucky hunter, but which happened at a different period
from the preceding events. ‘

12. Day was‘ hunting in company with a lively and

pleasant young fellow, who was 3.. great favorite with the

veteran, but whose vivacity he had continually to keep in
check. They were in search of deer, when suddenly a
huge grizzly bear emerged from a thicket about thirty yards
distant, rearing himself upon his hind legs with a terriﬁc
growl,‘ and displaying a hideous array of teeth and.claWs.

3. The riﬂe of the young man was levelled in an in-
stant, but John Day’s iron hand was as quickly upon his arm.
“ Be quiet, boy ! be quiet! "’ exclaimed the hunter, between
his clenched teeth, and without turning his eyes from the
bear. They remained motionless. The monster regarded
them for a time, then, lowering himself on his fore paws,
slowly withdrew. A

14. He had not gone many paces before he again turned,
reared himself on his hind legs, and repeated his menace.
Day’s hand was still on the arm of his young companion; he
again pressed it hard, and kept repeating, between his teeth,
“Quiet, boy! keep quiet! keep quiet!” though the latter
had not made a move since his ﬁrst prohibition. The bear
again lowered himself on all fours, retreated some twenty
yards further, and again turned, reared, showed his teeth,
and growled. .

15. This third menace was too much for the game spirit
of John Day. “ I can stand this no longer,” he-exclaimed,
and in an instant a ball from his riﬂe [whiz-zed into the foe.
The wound was not mortal; but luckily it dismayed, instead
of enraging, the animal, and he retreated into the thicket.

16. Day’s young companion reproached him for not prac-
tising the caution which he enjoined upon others. “ Why,
boy,” replied the veteran, “caution is caution; but one must
not put up with too much, even from a bear. Would you
have me suffer myself to be bullied all day by a Varmint ’! ”

RULES FOR READERS. L9

This is necessary, as he cannot otherwise always understand what he reads.
It is easy to accustom yourself to cast your eye half a line forward, so that,
if a hard word IS coming, it does not take you unawares.

15. Read deliberately.

Make up your mind to observe this important rule ; and let nothing dis-
concert or disturb you; If you ﬁnd you are becoming embarrassed, stop‘ at
once, and wait till you areentirely at ease and self-possessed; The want
of self-possession produces much mischief in reading.

16. Read carefully.

It is a good rule to endeavor to do everything you undertake, in the best
possible manner. Get the habit of doing everything well. Whether you
study or play, give your whole heart to it, while you are about it. There-
fore, when you read, read carefully.

17 . Read as if you’ were interested.

I have heard people read as if they were half asleep, and I have heard

' others gabble on like a ﬂock of geese, as if their words had no meaning.

This is all wrong. Listen to your school-mates, when they are animated
with play, and see how naturally and earnestly they speak. You should be as
naturaland earnest in reading. This earnestness of manner, provided it is
not carried too far, is a great charm in reading. ’

18. Pay attention to punctuation.

This you will naturally do if you understand and are interested in the les-
son. Pause at each comma long enough to count one; sometimes a much
longer pause is requisite ; but for this and other pauses, I can give no deﬂ-
nite rule, but must leave it to your judgment. Observe what pauses intelli-
gent .people make, when reading or speaking, and imitate them in this
respect.

19. Give each Word its proper accent.

Accent is a strong and ﬁrm enunciation of certain parts of words. Thus,
in father, the accent is on the ﬁrst syllable; in desire, it is on the second;
in understand, it is on the third. There are no errors in reading more oﬁ"en-
sive, than the misplacing of accent.

20. Lay your. emphasis upon the proper Words.

In every sentence, therelfre one or more words of leading importance.
These are called emphatic words, and should be uttered with more force than
the rest. In the adage, “ Look ere you leap,” it is proper to lay stress on
the words look and leap. A careful attention to this is indispensable to good
reading. ‘

21. Be careful to avoid wrong pronunciation.

This is a common fault, both in speaking and reading. Many persons say
winder for window, airth for earth, tobak/cer for tobacco, wot for what, ondo
for undo, foldid for folded, &c. These,and other similar faults in pronuncia-
tion, should he scrupulously avoided. I shall subjoin to the lessons a list
of some common errors in. pronunciation that occurin them. Remember that
faults of pronunciation, in reading or speaking, are very disagreeable and
offensive, and take care to avoid them.

22. Read poetry as it Were prose, Withia slight
notice of the measure.

pects in the distance. .

2. Wealth seeks to make him her votary, by disclosing
her magic power over‘ men and things. Ambition woos him
with dreams of glory. Indolence essays to soften and.‘ seduce
him to her inﬂuence. Love, Envy, Malice, Reveinge’, Jeal-
ousy, and other busy-’ spirits, assail him with their various
arts. -

SELF-GOVERNMENT. 109

3. And man is free to yield to these temptations, if he
will; or he has the power to resist them, if he will. God
has surrendered ,him to his own discretion, making him re«
sponsible, however, for the use and the abuse of the ‘liberty
bestowed upon him. i

4. If a person mounts a high-spirited horse, it is impor-
tant that he should be able to control him, otherwise he may
be dashed in pieces. If an engineer undertakes to conduct
a locomotive, it is necessary that he should be able to guide
or check the panting engine at his pleasure, else his own
life, and the lives’ of others, may be sacriﬁced. But it is
still more indispensable that an individual, who is intrusted
with the care of himself, should beable to govern himself.

5. This might seem a very easy task; but it is one of the

.most difficult that we are called upon to perform. History

shows us that some of the greatest menihave failed in it.

Alexander could conquer the legions of Persia, but he

could not conquer his passions. Cesar triumphed in a hun-—
dred battles, but he fell a victim to the desire of being a
king. ' 

6. Bonaparte vanquished nearly the whole of Europe, but

i he could not vanquish his own ambition. And in humble life,

nearer home, in our own every-day affairs, most of us are
oftendrawn aside from the path of duty and discretion,-be—
cause we cannot resist some temptation or overcome some
prejudice. '

'7. If we consider that self-government requires two things,
—ﬁrst, whenever We are tempted to deviate from the path of
rectitude or to act imprudently, or whenever we are tempted».
to neglect any duty, that we should possess and exercise the‘
power to check ourselves in the one case, and compel‘

ourselves to the required action in the other, we shall see?
that it is the great regulator of conduct, the very balance-at

wheel of life.

8. Without it, a person is almost sure to miss happiness,
however great may be his gifts, however high his fortune ;_
with it, the humblest individual may command, not merely’

the world’s wealth, but the world’s respect: and, what is-'

better, peace of mind and the consciousness of Heaven’s-
approbation.
9. If parents would not trust a child upon the ‘back of V a-

go forth into the world unskilled in self-government. If a
child is passionate, teach him, by gentle and patient means,
to curb his temper. If. he is niggardly, cultivate liberality in
him. If he is selﬁsh, promote generosity.

10. If he is sulky,. charm him out of it, by encouraging
frank good-humor. If he is indolent, accustom him to ex-
ertion, and train him so as to perform even onerous duties
with alacrity. If pride comes in to make his obedience re-
luctant, subdue him, either by counsel or discipline.

11. In short, give your children the habit of resisting
their besetting sins. Let them‘ feel that they can overcome
temptation. Let them acquire from experience that confi-
dence in themselves, which -gives security to the practised
horseman, even on the back of a high-strung steed, and
they will triumph over. the diﬁiculties and dangers which
beset them in the path of life. _ .

LESSON LI. Shaking’ Hands.

1. THERE are few things of more common occurrence

than shaking hands ; and yet I do not recollect that there has»
been much speculation or upon thesubject. I confess, when.I-

consider to what unimportant andfutile concerns the atten-
tion of Writers and readers has been directed, I am‘ surpris-
ed that no one has been found-to handle so important a mat-
ter as this, and attempt to give the public a rational view of
the doctrine and discipline of shaking hands.

2. It is a theme on which I ha,ve.myself, theorized a good ..

deal, and I beg leave to offer a few remarks on the origin
of the practice, and the various forms inwhich it is exer-

hcised.

SHAKING HANDS. .‘ 111

3. I have beeniunable to ﬁnd in the ancient Writers any
distinct mention of shaking hands. _They followed the
‘heartier practice of hugging or embracing, which has not
wholly disappeared among grown persons in Europe, and
children in o.ur own country, and has unquestionably the ad-
vantage on the score of cordiality. When the ancients

‘ trusted the business of salutation to the hands alone, they

joined, but did not shake them. ,

'4. I am inclined to think, that the practicegrew up in
the ages of chivalry, when the cumbrous iron mail, in which
the knights were cased, prevented their embracing; and
when, with ﬁngers clothed in steel, the simple touch or
joining of the hands would have been but cold welcome ;
so that a prolonged junction was a natural resort, to express

. cordiality; and, as it would have been awkward to keep the

hands unemployed in _this_position, a gentle agitation or
‘shaking might have beennaturally introduced.

5. How long the practice may have remained in this in-
cipient stage, it is impossible, in‘ the silence of history, to
say; nor is there anything in the Chronicles, in Philip de

Comi.nes, or the Byzantisne historians, which enables us to a

trace the progress of the art, into the forms in which it now
exists among us. , V is I
6.- Without,'therefore, availing myself of the privilege of
theorists to supply by conjecture the absence of history or
tradition, I shall pass immediately to the enumeration of
these forms. ' V
7.. ‘The pumplealndle shake is the ﬁrst which deserves no-

ltice. It is executed by taking your friend’s hand, and work-

ing it up and down, through an arc of ﬁfty degrees, for
about a minute and a half. To have its nature, force, and
character, this shake should be performed with a fair steady

— motion. ‘ r

8. ‘No attempts should be made to give it grace, and still
less, vivacity; as the few instances, in which the latter has
been tried, have uniformly resulted in: dislocating the shoul-
der of the person on Whom it has been attempted.

9. On the contrary, persons who are partial to the pump-
handle shake, should be at some pains to give an equable,
tranquil movement to the operation, "-which should on no ac-
count be continued after perspiration on the part of your
ﬁiend has commenced. I  ‘ *- 5 ,

-g__ ,.

112 THE THIRD READER.

10. The pendulum shake may be mentioned next, as be-
ing somewhat similar in character; but moving, as the
name indicates, in a horizontal, instead of a. perpendicular
direction. It is executed by sweeping your hand horizon-
tally towards your friend’s, and, after the junction is effected,
rowing with it from one side to the other, according to the
pleasure of the parties. A , ’ '

11. The only caution in its use, which needs particularly
to be given, is not to insist on performing it in a plane,
strictly parallel to the horizon, when you meet with a per-
son who has been educated to the pump-handle_ shake. It
is well known that people cling to the forms in which they

have been educated, even when the substance is sacriﬁced V

in adhering to them. .. ' , .
12. I had two acquaintances, both estimable men, one of

whom had been brought up in thepump-handle shake, and

another had brought home the pendulum from a foreign

‘ voyage. ‘They met, joined hands, and attempted to put

them in motion. They were neither of them feeble men.
One endeavoring to pump, and the other to paddle, their
faces reddened; the drops stood on their foreheads; and it
was, at last, a pleasing illustration of the doctrine of the
composition of forces, .to see, their hands slanting into an
exact diagonal, in which line they ever after shook. But it
was plain to see, there was no cordiality in it; and, as is
usually the case‘ with compromises, both parties were dis-
contented.

13. The tourniquet shake is the next in importance. It
derives its name from the instrument made use of by sur-
geons to stop the circulation of the blood, in a limb about to
be amputated. It is performed by clasping the hand of your
friend, as far as you can, in your own, and then contracting
the muscles of your thumb, ﬁngers, and palm, till you have
induced any degree of compression you may propose, in the
hand of your friend. _ ~

14. Particular care ought to be taken, if your own hand
is hard and as big as a frying-pan, and that of your friend
as small and soft as a young maiden’s, not to make use of
the tourniquet shake to the degree that will force the small
bones of the wrist“ out of place. It is also seldom safe to
apply it to gouty persons. .

15. A hearty young friend of mine, who had pursued the

SHAKING HANDS. 113

study‘of geology, and acquired an unusual hardness and
strength of hand and wrist by the use of the hammer, on
returning from a scientiﬁc excursion, gave his gouty uncle
the tourniquet shake with such severity asnearly reduced
the old gentleman’s ﬁngers to powder; for which my friend
hadthe pleasure of being disinherited, as soon as his uncle’s
ﬁnger got Well enough to hold a pen. .

16. The cordial grapple is a shake of some interest. It
is a hearty, boisterous agitation of your friend’s hand, ac-
companied with moderate pressure, and loud, cheerful ex-

clamations of welcome. It is an excellent travelling shake,_

and well adapted to make friends. It is indiscriminately
performed. '
17. The Peter Grievous touch is opposed to the cordial

grapple. It his a pensive, tranquil junction", followed  a

mild subsultory motion, a cast-down look, and an inarticu-
late inquiry after your friend’s health.
18. The prude major and prude minor are nearly monop-

, olized by the ladies. They cannot be accurately described,

but are constantly’ to be noticed in practic_e.~ They never

_ extend beyondthe ﬁngers, andthe prude major allows you

to touch even then only down to the second joint. The
prude minor gives you the whole of the fore ﬁnger.

19. Considerable skill may be shown in performing these,
with nice variations, such as extending the left hand instead
of the right, or stretching ‘a new glossy kid glove over the
ﬁnger you extend. , - ,

20. I might go through a list, of the gripe royal, the saw-
mill shake, and the shake’ with malice prepense; but these

are only factitious combinations of the three fundamental.

forms already described, under the pump-handle, the pendu-
lum, and the tourniquet; as the loving pat, the touch romantic,
and the sentimental clasp, may be reduced in their main
movements to various combinations and ‘modiﬁcations of the
cordial grapple, the. Peter Grievous touch, and the prude
major and minor. I ,

21. I should trouble the reader with‘ a few remarks, in
conclusion, on the mode of I shaking hands, as an indication
of characters ; but as I see a friend coming up the avenue,
‘who is addicted to the pump-handle, I dare not tire. In

LESSON, LII. April.

1. I HAVE found violets ; April hath come on,
And the cool winds feel softer, a.nd the rain
Falls in the beaded drops of summer time.
You may hear birds_at morning, and at eve
The tame dove lingers till the twilight falls,
Cooing upon the eaves, and drawing in
His beautiful bright neck ; and from the hills,
A murmur like the hoarseness of the sea
Tells the release of waters, and the earth
Sends up a pleasant smell, and the dry leaves
Are lifted by the grass, — and so I know
That nature, with her delicate ear, hath heard T
The droppingof the velvet foot of Spring.

2. Take of my violets! I found them where
The liquid south stole o’er them, on a bank
That leaned torunningwaters. There ’s to me
A daintiness about these early ﬂowers,

That touches mevlike poetry. They blow
With such a simple loveliness among
The common herbs of pasture, and breathe out
Their lives so unobtrusively, like hearts
 Whose beatings are too gentle for the world.

I love to go in the capricious days‘

, Of. April, and huntviolets, when _the rain
ls in the blue cups trembling, and they nod
So gracefully to the kisses of the wind.

LESSON LIII. ,The Moclcing Bird.

1. THAT sweetest of American songsters, the rival of the
nightingale of the Old World, the mocking bird, was in
full song, and wooing its mate; and sweeter melody than
that which ﬁlled the ear during the short southern twilight,
and beguiled the hours of darkness, w-as surely never heard
under the stars.

2. I have often listened to that song elsewhere, in the
deep woods of the North and West ;_ but whether it was the

‘season, or theunion of circumstances and thought, which

attuned my own temper and mind to the harmony, I think I
never heard that inexplicably varied song poured forth with
such effect, as amid the sweet-scented dews of Darien.

3. The air was ﬁlled with its vibrations hour after hour;
and every quality, power, clearness, and melody, seemed
united and perfected in the quiet efforts of that svveet-throat-
ed bird. Their numbers were greater “than I had ever wit-
nessed elsewhere. If you stole in the starlight up the river

‘bank, from your seat under the piazzas of the village, there

was no danger of your leaving the melody behind.

4. There was a secluded spot on the shore, full of palmetto
and other low bushes, into which you descended by a wind-
ing foot-path between rocky, sandstone banks. IA couple
of canoes were moored ‘within its shelter, and at the foot of

116 THE THIRD READER.

the sandstone rock, where an aged tree slanted across it, a
fresh spring welled out, and ran its short, bubbling course
to the river. -

5. Here it was delicious to linger in the darkness, and
listen to the melody in the branches above you. And again,

between this point and the village, lay an ancient Indian‘

mound, on the verge of a lawn-like piece of level sward,
extending from the steep, high bank of the Alatahama some

, distance toward the forest, with groups of live oak sprinkled

over it, and thickening towards the cottages and rude church
on its ‘conﬁnes.

6. ,Here, on both evenings of our stay, I marked one of
these syrens take its perch on a solitary bush-, which
broke the uniformity of the swell "of the, mound, and sit
hour after hour, alternately listening to and answering the

notes of its mate, concealed among the thick foliage and
hanging moss of a distant tree. * . 4

7. I listened to it till I thought I could almost interpret
its full, varied tale, -with its innumerable periods. If the in-
tensityof feeling be at all commensurate with the intensity
and power of expression, who shall fathom the depth of that
which God has implanted in the little ﬂuttering heart of
these songsters. . '

8. What.-can match the thrilling ecstasy of those clear
and redundant notes, or express the depth of pathos, of
which those slow, plaintive modulations convey an impres-
sion to the breast. There is nothing in nature that speaks
to me more plainly of the goodness‘ of God, than the over-
ﬂowing and joyous song of a bird. Is not this the voice of
praise, and is it not the song of unutterable gratitude’!

CONDUCT TO PARENTS. 117

LESSON LIV. Conduct to Parents.

1. NOTHING can justify the want of respect in. the; man-
ners of children to their parents, not even faults of charac-
ter in the individuals claiming such deference and regard.
There is nothing in the whole circle of domestic relations
so lovely, so pure, so honorable to both parties, as the re-
spectful, affectionate, and conﬁdential intercourse of some
children with their parents.

2. The sympathy you will so often need from affectionate
parents, you must abundantly repay, or you will become
selﬁsh and exacting. If you would be the friend and com-
panion of your father, as every child should endeavor to be,

. you must enter into his feelings and views, you must take an

interest in his concerns, talk of the subjects that he talks of,
read or listen to the news of the day‘, be somewhat acquaint-

ed with his politics, and learn of him the principles on.

which business is conducted, of which many young people
are too ignorant. ' W

3. With your mother, you are called upon to sympathize
most tenderly in all the daily cares and perplexities of life;
and when her self-sacriﬁcing spirit would fain save you from
partaking in her anxieties, let it not be so. Be ever on the
alert to sympathize where you cannot relieve.

4. Madame Celnart remarks upon this subject, that “ the
most sublime, the most touching marks of religion and of
nature unite in commanding us to love and honor those
from whom we have received life. - We ought always to ad-
dress them in a respectful and kind tone; to anticipate them
in everything; to ask their advice, to receive their reproofs
with submission, to show them a lively gratitude on every
occasion, and to consider them as always ‘our superiors, our
benefactors, and our guides. ‘ A r '

5. “ If we are separated from our parents, we should write
to them frequently; our style should be impressed with de-
voted affection, and we should repeat, particularly at the end
of our letters, the sentiments of respect and love with which
we are inspired.-” ‘

Spell and deﬁne :, parents, deference, intercourse, children, sympathize,
perplexities, alert, submission, respect, devoted.

10 THE THIRD READER.

It must be recollected that poetry, as well as prose, is ‘designed toyconvey
thoughts, and feelings, and ideas. It is, therefore, to be read with a princi-
pal regard to the sense. A But, as poetry is a measured composition, that
measure may be slightly noticed. If the poetry is in rhyme, it should be so
read, that the rhyme will be distinctly perceived by the bearer. In poetry,
a careful regard must be had to the punctuation, for the pauses are essential
to an understanding of the sense.

 Dialogue must be read as if it were spoken
by the several characters.

Dialogue is a conversation between two or more people. These naturally
speak in different tones of voice, and often with different degrees of earnest-
ness and rapidity. To read dialogue naturally, you must picture the scene
and the persons speaking, and, in some degree, imitate their supposed manner
of speaking; but do not carry this imitation too far, or it may appear
aﬁected.

24. A parenthesis is to be read in a somewhat
altered tone of voice. ‘

AA parenthesis consists of words thrown into a sentence for the purpose of
explanation or qualiﬁcation. In order to separate it from the rest of the sen-
tence, and show its purpose, you should generally read it with a slightly low-
ered tone. ‘ A

25. Passages which are marked as quotations
should be read as other passages, without any
changeof the voice or manner.

' Passages quoted, by which is meant the words of-= some other person than
the writer, are marked by inverted commas. According to this rule, you

should read the following passage as one sentence, without marking the quoted -

portion, by any change of voice or manner ; It has been said, that “ youth is
the spring season of life, when the seed is sown that ripens into the harvest of after
years,” andihis idea is no less true than beautiful. If the quoted passage is
the speech of another person, it is proper to read it as he would have spoken

'26. ‘Avoid stammering.

All hurry, confusion, and stammering in reading are very painful to listeners.
Calmness and self-‘possession are necessary to a good reader.

27. Avoid sing-song, especially in reading Verse.

Young readers are particularly exposed to this fault. A sing-song manner
is produced, mostly, by the two following errors : the ﬁrst is, reading the
last syllable of every verse in.a peculiar, drawling, monotonous tone; the
next is, accenting every alternate syllable of a verse. These two errors
produce intolerable reading.‘

28. Avoid repetition.

Some children read one word of a sentence two or three times over. You
will avoid this, if you do not begin till you are ready. Do not hurry your-
self, keep a full supply of breath, and always know what a word is, before
you attempt to read it. ,

LESSON LV. Intemperance.

1. IT was once no disgrace for a man to get drunk in a
convivial way ; but intemperance is now looked upon in its
proper light, as one of those vices marked by Heaven with
peculiar reprobation, from the frightful consequences at-
tached to its indulgence. Its immediate effect is to deprive
a’ man of reason and lay him upon the earth, a loathsome
image of man, while yet but a mass of breathing clay.

 next effect is to take away self-control and self-

 par.a1yze,.the_ undersgtanding, to undermine the

health, and stupefy the moral sense. It goes on to render
the individual a burden to himself and a by-word on the

' lips of his fellow-men.

3. If he is a parent, it makes him indifferent to the for-
tunes of his children ;, if a husband, he becomes insensible
to the claims and privileges of a wife ; if a son, he cares

‘not even though he bring down the gray hairs of a father-

with sorrow to the grave. - .

4. We sometimes see the unsheathed lightning of heaven
descend upon a human dwelling, and, in pursuit of the hid-
den iron, leap from point to point, shivering the “rafter and
splintering the beam, and thus‘ reaching the imbedded nail
and sunken spike. - . »

5. And so the wrath of Heaven seems to follow the vices
of the drunkard; ﬁrst visiting the iniquity upon the shattered
frame, then upon the ruined mind, and at last upon those
who are connected with him, wife, children, and friends!

6. A striking illustration of the inveteracy of this vice,
andthe supremacy it acquires overthe mind, is afforded in
the anecdote of an Indian who was met at the Rapidsof Ni-
agara by some travellers. He asked them for spirits, of
which their servant had a bottle. ,

7. It wasagreed, that he should have this if he would

MORNING HYMN. 119

swiminto the rapids and back again, a little above the falls.
Tothis he consented, and, taking the bottle with ‘him, ven-
tured in. He went to the required distance, and then at-
tempted to return. But the current-was too strong; for

several minutes he strove desperately for the shore, but i

without gaining a single inch. t

8. His strength gradually gave way, and he began to
yield to the overmastering tide. Finding that the strife was
vain and his fate inevitable, he yielded to the current, and,
rising above the wave, put the upturned bottle to his lips,
and in this attitude plunged over the roaring fall !

9. Alas ! how often has it happened that persons, without
the excuse of this untutored savage, have been tempted to
their graves by the love of liquor, and, while hovering on

.the very brink of eternity, have shown that they thought

more of the thirsty lip than the immortal soul! _

1. PRIDE is of two kinds: ﬁrst, inordinate self:-esteem=;‘:
an unreasonable conceit of _ one’s superiority in talents,
beauty, wealth, accomplishments, rank, or elevation; sec--
ond, a noble self-esteem, springing from a consciousness of

worth. a

2. The ﬁrst of these, is one of the great mischief-makers
in society, and always bespeaks a want of good sense in:
11 l

122 THE THIRD READER.

those who are marked with it. It is, in fact, a species of
insanity, for it converts into a curse those very advantages
upon which it is founded.

3. If a person is seen to be proud of any possession, he
becomes the object of envy, malice, and detraction. And
thus, what might be the instrument of attaching friends and
promoting the happiness of others, draws around the indi-
vidual a host of enemies, and turns human kindness into
effervescent bitterness and spleen.

4. But how shall we correct this evil passion, so rife and
ready in the human heart, where it has even the least en-
couragement’! The boy will plume himself upon his new
jacket; the girl will seek_to dazzle her companions with her
new bonnet. T ' '

5. The rich proprietor of the lordly mansion will look
haughtily down upon the shed of his humble neighbor.

- The luxurious occupant of the coach will peep supercil-

iously out of the window upon the man that toils through
the dust on foot.

6. These things will sometimes be, and how shall we pre-
vent or mitigate these evils’! There are two considerations,
which, if duly impressed upon the minds of parents, and
properly inculcated upon children, will go‘ far towards
accomplishing this object. , _

7. In the ﬁrst place, wealth, beauty, power, and station,
are not essential to happiness; nor do they, as the world
goes, ordinarily bring happiness. There is no reason,
therefore, why the possessor of them should be looked upon
with envy, or regarded as, of course, favored above others.

8. In the second place, these envied possessions are no
sufficient grounds for self-esteem. They are accidental
gifts,implying no merit on the part of him who holds them.
The true standard of character is that of moral worth.
One who is honest, just, and beneﬁcent, be he rich or be he
poor, is entitled to his own esteem and that of others.

9. Riches, beauty, and power, are compatible with vice
and meanness; they are no part of the man, and ought not
to bring upon him to -whom Providence has given them,
either honor or reproach. Let parents cultivate these
views of human character and human life upon themselves
and their children. i

10. ‘Let them manifest a solicitude, that their children

,WARNINGS. . 123

should be good, rather than great. Let them show, that they

place a higher value upon obedience, truth, and kindness,

than upon riches.

11. Let them beware how they excite the ambition of
children, to outshinetheir companions in dress, equipage,
or any other sign of good fortune. Let them beware how
they stimulate the love of display, or tolerate a haughty
self-esteem. ,

12. Let them duly consider that wealth, power, and sta-
tion are dangerous possessions; and that he on whom they
are bestowed, like one Walking on the edge of a dizzy
precipice, is eminently exposed to destruction; and that
happiness, peace, and security usually dwell with the hum-

bler occupant of the lowly hill-side or the sheltered valley.
' 13. Vanity, an empty pride, inspired by an overweening

conceit of one’s personal attainments or decorations, is apt
to beset young minds, and, with a little encouragement, will
soon spread itself over the whole character. »

14. But it is an offensive vice, and those who are infected
with it soon ﬁnd themselves subjected to ridicule and con-
tempt. Let those who have the charge of children be
careful, that they do not feed this greedy passion, by minis-
tering to its cravings in gaudy dress, or equipage, or display
of any kind.‘ ‘ ‘ .

15. Anger and revenge are such atrocious passions, that
the parent hardly needs to be warned against their indul-
gence on the part of children. Sulkiness is so ill-favored,
that a child under its inﬂuence will generally dismiss it if he
can see himself in a mirror.

16. Good-humor in the parents will always charm this
moody intruder out of the house. Obstinacy must be rea-
soned with; when the under-standing is convinced, and a
little time is given for pride to subside, punishment may fol-
low if it do not yield. Greediness, the spirit of appropria-
tion of everything to self, in the child, leads to avarice in
the man.

17. This may be easily overcome by persuading the child a

often to part with his possessions. The habit of giving
away is soon established. The spirit of liberality readily
commends itself to the heart, when illustrated by example and
enforced by precept. But this must be done in childhood.
18. If avarice gets hold of a man, it usually clings to

124 THE THIRD READER.

him for life. It is, in such acase, the last vice which sur-
renders to virtue; and, even when religion enters the heart,
it ﬁercely and obstinately disputes for the right of sover-
eignty there. - “

19. Ambition is of two kinds, the one laudable, the other
vicious. The ﬁrst springs from a love of excellence, and
leads to a noble and generous emulation; the latter denotes
an inordinate and selﬁsh desire of power or eminence, often
accompanied with illegal means to obtain the object.

20. Parents and teachers should be careful to discriminate
between these two kinds of ambition, and take heed that, in
giving scope to one, they do not tolerategthe other. There
is a difference in children, as I have had occasion to remark
before, as to the facility with which the principle of emula-
tion acts upon them.

21. But, soon or late, almost all of them are imbued with
a desire to rise in life, and therefore engage in the strife to
see which shall climb the highest. In this country, there
are so many tempting ﬁelds of enterprise thrown open to
ambition, that almost every person is roused to action, and
stimulated to the utmost pitch of his powers.

22. The humblest individual may rise to the highest
oﬂice, or attain the most unbounded wealth. Every one can
look around and see examples‘ which assure him of this
truth. - 2 '2

23. And, as if this were not a suﬂicient stimulus, we syste-
matically urge such views and desires, not upon the young
only, but upon the whole community, as lead to the im-
pression, that success in life consists only in riches or prefer-
ment, and that happiness is only to be found in. standing
upon the heads of others.

24. This is wrong ; and it deserves the serious considera-
tion of parents. Competence‘ and content are true wealth;
and those who exercise an inﬂuence over children sin against
their true interest, if they mark out for them a plan of life,
which goes beyond or falls short of these. '

LESSON LIX. Warnings continued.

1. HOWEVER the vice of deception may originate, it is
one of the most hurtful and dangerous to which children
are exposed. Like a thrifty weed, it grows rapidly from
small beginnings, and soon engrosses the whole soil, to the
exclusion of useful plants.

2. It deadens the mind to the beauty of truth, and, after
long indulgence, blinds the moral vision, so that it cannot

clearly discover the path of rectitude. It displaces frank-'

ness, and substitutes shyness; it roots out honesty, and
weaves over the whole character a revolting tissue of trick,
artiﬁce, and subterfuge.

3. Let parents, therefore, deal vigilantly with this vice,
and eradicate it in all its forms. If a root or ﬁbre is left in
the heart, it will soon or late shoot forth and ﬂourish.

4. Cunning is the legitimate offspring of falsehood, and
ever merits reprobation and contempt. I know of no per-
son more generally feared, shunned, and despised, than one
Who has acquired the reputation of being cunning.

5. He is generally compared to a snake in the grass,
which slides unseen around your path, and, without giving
you the opportunity of escape or defence, he is ready to make
you the victim of his selfishness and spleen. If you would
not leave the image of the serpent, stamped upon the char-
acter of your child, be careful to check in him every ten-
dency to cunning. ‘

6. Envy reﬂects more disgrace upon human nature than
any other passion. It seems so unnatural, and so exclu-
sively useless and hurtful, that we cannot but wonder how it
came into the world. Stripped of all disguise, it is hatred

11* '

125 THE THIRD READER.

of another, excited by the perception of his superiority in
some respect.

7'. Thus beauty, wealth, strength, talents, virtue, among
the best gifts of heaven, are sometimes permitted to provoke
this hateful passion. And let it be remembered, that envy
is not a sluggish or inactive principle; it is not content to
gaze only at the happiness of another; but it stimulates the
bosom in which it resides to exertion, for the purpose of de-
spoiling. the fortunate and the successful of their enjoyments.

8. Let it also be considered, that while this passion tends
to evil in respect to the object which excites it, it also stings
the heart in which it lives, without even affording the poor
atonement of transient gratiﬁication.

9. It might seem, that mankind would be careful to ex-
clude a drug of such unmixed‘ bitterness from the cup which
they put to their lips. But it is still largely mingled, either by
accident or volition, in the thoughts and feelings which make
up the every-day draught of society.

10. It is to envy, that we may trace the spicy scandal and
the detractive gossip, which circulate with such electric en-
ergy in our towns, cities, and villages. It is to envy, that we
may attribute that odious triumph, with which we sometimes
see people trample ‘on an individual, Whom misfortune has
hurled down from some elevated station.

11. It is to envy, that we may attribute much of that sour
discontent, with which the poor or the less wealthy look upon
the rich. It is to envy, we may impute the malice with
which the coarse and vulgar look uponthe reﬁned, and with
which the vicious regard the virtuous.

12. Let parents beware of this pestilent disturber of hu-
man peace-. If they are poor, let their children by no
means indulge envy towards the rich. No person should he
hated, either because he is rich or poor. Above all, let not
parents infuse a poison into the minds of their children,
which can bestow no pleasure, and ensures certain misery.

13.» Let them especially beware of those meddling people,
who, knowing the readiness with which envy springs up in
the minds of 1nen,seek to promote it, and thus agitate so-

ciety with strife and contention. In almost every village, ‘

‘town, and city, there are some persons of this sort.
14. Even at school, we often ﬁnd some beardless politi-
acian, attempting to excite the children’ of the poor against

WARNINGS CONTINUED. 127

those of the rich, by accusing the latter of pride, which
probably they do not feel; and we need not go far to ﬁnd
similar politicians in grown-up society.

15. Of all people in the world, these are most to be
shunned; for, while they are ever swayed by sinister and
selﬁsh designs, and while their exertions only tend to mis-
chief, the weakness of poor human nature is still apt to give
them inﬂuence.

16. It is the duty, it is the interest, of all to cultivate
peace, good-will, good neighborhood in society. Who then
would endeavor to give up society to the demon of envy?
Who would give encouragement to the ministers of this
mischievous spirit’! Who would aid in scattering discord
and strife among the members of the human family’!

17. Jealousy is a twin-sister of envy, and the two may
often be seen hand in hand, helping each other in the work

of mischief. Suspicion is of the same bad family, and, like

its kindred, perpetually seeks to extend its power over the
individual into whose breast it has gained admittance.

18. It drives away» the nobler virtues, and at length takes
possession of the whole tenement. When it has acquired
complete sway, it degrades the mind and debases the heart.
It suggests evil thoughts of others, because the placewhere
it dwells is evil. - ’

19. There is no surer sign, that the core of a man’s heart
is thus rendered unsound by the worm within, than to see
him constantly suspecting others of vice or meanness. It is
pitiable to see some persons, stung with this, malady, who
are constantly seeking to’ give a bad interpretation to the
conduct of others. i ' _

20. These usually assume an air of superior sagacity, and,
pretending to penetrate the hearts of men with a moral mi-
croscope of their own, trace the best and most benevolent
actions to a polluted fountain. 5

21. Such persons are self-deceivers, and, instead of being
wiser than others, they are usually mistaken, and are very
unsafe counsellors. Regulated by no sense of justice, and
guided by norfeeling of candor, -they judge ill of others only
from a_ consciousness- of the evil springing up within them-
selves.

'22. Instead of throwing light upon the breasts of others,
they only expose what is passing in their own bosom. It

LESSON 1. The Bible.

1. OF all books, the Bible is the most interesting and
useful to those who will read it attentively. It is the only
work, that reveals the true story of the creation, and of the
ﬁrst human family; and which clearly unfolds to man his
duty and his destiny.

' 2. Its title signiﬁes THE BooK, which implies,~that it is
above all other books. The following story shows a proper
sense of its value. _

3.  little boy, a Sunday-school scholar, was one day
sent by his mother to a” shop for some soap; the shop-
Woman, having weighed it, took a leaf from a Bible that

was placed on the counter for waste paper; at which the

boy was greatly astonished, and vehemently exclaimed,
“ Why, mistress, that is the Bible! ”

4. “ Well, what if it be?” replied the woman. “ It is
the Bible,” replied the boy, “ and what are you going to do
with it ’! ” “ To wrap up the soap,” was the answer.

5. “ But, mistress, you should not tear up thatbook, for A

it is the Bible!” cried the boy, with peculiar emphasis.
“ What does that signify?” said the woman sharply; “ I
bought it for waste paper, to use in the shop.” ’

6. The boy, with still increasing energy, exclaimed,
“-What, the Bible’! I wish it was mine: I would not tear’
it up like that.” “ Well,” said the woman, “ if you will

i pay me what I gave" for it, you shall have it.” “Thank

you,” replied the boy, “ I will go home and ask my mother‘
for some money.” i

'7. Away he went, and said, “Mother, mother, please
give me some money!” “-What for?” said his mother.
“ To buy a Bible,” he.replied; “ for the woman at the shop
was tearing up the ‘Bible, and I told her, she should not
do it; then she said shewould sell it to me: Oh mother,

do give me some money to buy it, that it may not be torn.

their warnings '2 '

Question on the Rules. How should you stand in order to read easily '2

LESSON LX. Charity.

1. IT is not necessary for me to enlarge upon the virtue .

of charity in its religious sense, as involving love to God,
the source of all good. But in its exercise to man, it cannot
be too earnestly inculcated, especially as a point of educa-
tion.

2. I do not speak of almsgiving, the commonest, cheap-
est, and easiest kind of charity; for the demands upon us
for this are few in our country, compared with what they are
in most others. ‘Perhaps the infrequency of occasion for the
exercise of this species of virtue may even lead us to forget
it, which would certainly be wrong; for there are instances
in which partlng‘ with our substance for the relief of the
needy is an indispensable duty. »

3. But Iwould ask parents to cultivate that charity of
speech, feeling, and opinion, which may lead to peace in
families, neighborhoods, villages, and towns. Let them
cherish all this in themselves; let them cultivate it in
their children. If we consider the savage spirit which

we often see in society, leading to duels, mobs, and riots ;.

and if we consider, that even the press often stimulates these

by bitterness -and virulence, rather than softens them by
justice, candor, and dignity ; «we shall see . how important is
the interposition of parents in this matter.

4. Let them begin with childhood. Let them arrest the
little arm, that is so prompt to hurl a resentful stone, or
thrust forth a defying fist. Let them check the little tongue,
that is so apt and ready at catching sharp and reproachful
epithets. Let them cultivate the habit of putting kind con-
structions upon actions, and seeking for favorable, rather
than unfavorable, points of character.

5. Let them check a satirical turn in children, and by no
means indulge in them a love of ridicule. A turn for the
ridiculous, the lowest and last species of wit, is a thing to
be shunned; for it often terminates in grossness and brutal-
ity. The following fable "may illustrate the degradation of

‘mind and taste to which it may lead.

THE BEE AND BEETLE. A Fable.

6. A Bee and Beetle chanced to meet,
, One sunny day, upon a rose; ’ ’ .
His neighbor thus the Bee did greet,
Although meanwhile, he held his nose :
“ I wonder much to meet you ‘here,
For surely you don’t feast on roses ! ”
7. The Beetle answered with a sneer,
“. I know the idle fool supposes
That in a rose there ’s nought but honey.
You think aﬂower, so fair to view,
With breath so sweet, and cheek so sunny,

Questions on the Lesson. What is the meaning of charity '2 Ans. It
means love in its widest sense ; it embraces God and all mankind. A truly
charitable person will ever seek to manifest gratitude to God by doing his
will, and he will always endeav_or to make those happy around him. What
of giving aims? Does charity require that you should always speak kindly

LESSON LXII. Absurdity of I-Iumam Wayfare.

S 1. THE ﬁrst conﬂict between man and man was the mere
exertion of physical force, unaided by auxiliary weapons;
his arm was his buckler, his ﬁst was his mace, and a broken
head the catastrophe of his encounters.

_ 2. The battle of unassisted strength was succeeded by
the more rugged one of stones and clubs, and ‘war assumed
a sanguinary aspect. As man advanced in reﬁnement, as
his faculties expanded, and his sensibi-lities became more
exquisite, he grew rapidly more ingenious and experienced
in the art of murdering his fe‘l.lo~w-“beings.

3. He invented a thousand devices to defend and to as-
sault ; the helmet, the cuirass, and the buckler, the sword,
the dart, and the javelin, prepared him to elude tthewound,
as well as to launch the blow.

4. Still urging on, in the brilliant and ‘philanthropic ca-
reer of invention, he enlarges and heightens his powers of
defence and injury ;——the Aries, the Scorpio, the Balista,
and the Catapulta, give a horror and sublimity towar, and
magnify its glory ?by increasing its ‘desolation.

.5. Still insatiable, though armed ‘with emiaclfmery that
seemed to reach the limits of destructive invention, and to
yield a power of injury commensurate even with the desires
of revenge, yet deeper researches must he make in the di-
abolical arcana. S y

6. With furious zeal, he dives into the “bowels of the
earth ; hetoils midst poisonous minerals and deadly salts; and
the sublime discovery of gunpowder blazes upon the world.

7. This, indeed, is grand!—this,,indeed, marks the

powers of mind, and bespeaks that divine ‘endowment "of A

reason, which distinguishes us from the animals, our inferi-
ors; for the unenlightened brutes content themselves with

LESSON LXIII, A Night in Florz'd'a:

/1. SUNSET was announced by a general uproar in the

yard among the dogs, negroes, and fowls of every descrip-
tion, as a sly opossum was detected in a covert approach he

was making from the bushes toward the most; and a gener-
al hunt, which terminated by his capture and death, was
the consequence. -

2.’ Then came the reign of the musquitoes, and the whip-
poor-will, and the wish-ton—wish,—the two latter repeating
unceasingly their plaintive and complaining cries; while the

former rose in the air like a cloud, ﬁlling the ears with their’

unwelcomepiping hum, the face and hands with blisters, and
the heart with spite and impatience.

3. The Florida musquito is the redoubted “ gallinipper ”
of the south ; and a dozen stings are sufficient to make you
sore for a week- The dragon-ﬂies, which are fortunately

both large, numerous, and voracious, are now seen ﬂitting“

among them, and destroying thousands; but what are a few
thousands, when the very motes of the atmosphere seem
turned into myriads. V

4. The brief southern twilight steals over the landscape,
the haze thickens over the swamp, the night-hawk is seen
winging his restless ﬂight to and fro, just glancing by, with‘
the two white spots under its wings, glaring in the dark.

5. The ﬁre-ﬂies begin their beautiful‘ illumination, and

the mocking-bird is silent; and,‘ thought here. are frequent‘,

bird-calls from the wood, there i is no vocalist of power
among them. A

6. Now and then a sound like a long-drawn sigh is heard
in the direction of the swamp, notifying the presence of the
alligator; but his proper time for singing is about dawn,
when you may hear him and his brethren roaring like a dis-
tant herd of bulls. '

7. And now night settles deeper and deeper on the earth.
The whip-poor-will and his -neighbor cease their complain-
ings, the night-hawk is no longer visible, the musquitoes be-
gin to settle to their hiding-places, and the dragon-ﬂy has
ﬁlled his stomach, folded his wings, and hangs sleeping
under the twig. » ‘

8. The singular glare seen on the eastern horizon, called
by the settlers “ weather light,” glows duskily through the
woods, portending, as our oracular host said, either “terrible

_weather or a continued dry season;” and this is the hour

of enjoyment to myriads, whose voices have been hushed
as long as the glare of the sun was seen, or the heat of the
day felt on the land and water.

9. And such uproarious singing, whistling, chirping,
whizzing, croaking, purring, and vibrating, arise on all

sides, as you can form no idea of. An innumerable throng,

of frogs, of all habits, dimensions, and voices, pitched on
every key, from the clear whistle of the beautiful pea-green,

Even the croak of the latter sounded musical); and there

11. But the frogs, great as their advantage might seem
to be, from the particular favorable arrangement of their am-
ple lungs, were outdone by insects of the gryllus and cica-
da tribes; many of which sent forth sounds of such a shrill,
harsh, and jarring character, as might rather be deemed to
be the production of iron machinery,‘ than thatof small and

LESSON LXIV. Perseverance.

1. PERSEVERANCE, the steady pursuit of a laudable and
lawful object, is almost a sure path to eminence. It is a
thing whichcseems to be inherent in some, but it may be

cultivated in all. Even those who seem to be either indo-

lent like the‘sloth, or changeful as the butterﬂy, by skilful
training may be endowed with the habit of perseverance.

2. The folilovvjng anecdotes may aid in illustrating the na-
ture and~value inf this virtue. Robert Bruce, the restcrer

of the Scottish monarchy, being out on an expedition to re-

connoitre the enemy, had occasion to sleep at night in a
barn. In thetmorning, still reclining his head on a pillow
of straw, he beheld a spider climbing up a beam of the roof.

3. The insect fell to the ground, but immediately made a
second essay to ascend. This attracted the notice of the
hero, who, with regret, saw the spider. [all a second time
from the same eminence; It made a third unsuccessful at-
tempt. Not without a mixture of concern and curiosity,
the monarch twelve times beheld the insect baffled in its
aim ; but the thirteenth essay was crowned with success.

4. It gained the summit of the barn, and the king, start-
ing from his couch, exclaimed, “ This despicable insect has
taught me perseverance! I will follow its example. Have
I not been twelve times defeated by the enemy’s superior
force’! On-one ﬁght more hangs the independence of my
country!” In a few days, his anticipations were fully re-
alized, by the glorious result, to Scotland, of the battle of
Bannockburn. , s

5. A few years since, while travelling in an adjacent
State, I came to a little valley, surrounded by rocky and

135 THE THIRD READEVR.

precipitous hills. In that valleywas a single house. It was
old, and, by its irregularity of form, seemed to have been
built at various periods. .

6. It was, however, in good condition, and bespoke thrift

and comfort. Not a shingle was missing from the roof, not

dangling clapboards disﬁgured its sides, no unhinged blinds
swung idly in the wind, no old hats were thrust through the
windows. All around was tidy and well-conditioned.

7. The wood-house was stored with tall ranges of hicko-
ry, the barns were ample, and stacks of hay wit.hout declared
that it was full within. The soil around, as I have said,
was rocky, but cultivation had rendered it fertile.

8. Thriving orchards, rich pastures, and proliﬁc meadows
occupied the bed of the valley and the rugged sides of the
hills. I was struck with the scene; and, when I reached a
village at the distance of two or three—miles, I made some
inquiries, where I learned the story of the proprietor. .He

' was originally a poor. boy, and wholly dependent upon his

own exertions.

9. He was brought up as a farmer, and began life as a
day-laborer. In childhood he had read, that “procrastina-
tion is the thief of time.” He did not at ﬁrst understand
its meaning, and pondered long upon this desperate thief,
who bore the formidable title of Procrastination.

10. It was at length explained to him; but the struggles
he had made to comprehend the adage, ﬁxed it_ deep in his
mind. He often thought of it, and, feeling'its force, it be-
came the ruling maxim of his life. ,

11. Following its dictates with inﬂexible perseverance, he
at length became proprietor of the little valley I have describ-
ed.. Year by year it improved under his care, and, at the
period of which I am speaking, he was supposed to be
worth at least twenty thousand dollars.

12. Such is the force of perseverance. It gives power
to weakness, and opens to poverty the world’s wealth. It
spreads fertility over the barren landscape, and bids the
choicest fruits and ﬂowers spring up and ﬂourish in the
desert abode of thorns and briers.

LESSON LXVI. Government.

1. WHATEVER may be thought of it, the government of a
country is amatterof thegreatest consequence. It is of con-
sequence not only in a general point of view, but to each
individual. There is not a living soul so isolated, that the
inﬂuence of government, good or bad, may not reach him ;
and, in point of fact, there are very few men, women, or

GOVERNMENT. 139

children, of any generation, who are not in a serious degree
affected by government. _

2. We here speak not only of the form of government,
but of the administration of it. The ﬁrst is indeed of im-
portance, but the latter is no less important; indeed, it has
even been asserted, that whatever government is best admin-
istered is best. For the administration of our government,

the people are responsible in a high degree;_ for they elect ‘

theindividuals who administer it, and-, as these are good or
bad, ﬁt or unﬁt, so is the administration of it. i

3. Now let it be considered, for a moment, what is meant
by government; and we shall then see how immediately each
individual is interested in it, and how deeply he may be
affected by it.

4. Government, then, embraces the making and enforcing

I all those laws, which are designed to protect life; all "those

laws which are designed to protect property; all those laws
which should insure to a man, the peaceable possession of
his home, his house, and his ﬁreside; which should enable
him to collect around him his family in security, and
feel persuaded, that the fruit of his labor, his skill, and his
care, is so guarantied to him, that he may appropriate it to
his and their comfort and happiness.

6.‘ Nor is this all the beneﬁt designed to be conferred on
us by government. It is this, which should provide a system
of general education ;- it is this, which should protect us in
the free exercise of our religious opinions; it is this, which
should enforce justice between man and man; it is this,
which should regulate commerce, and render it a source of

national and individual wealth ; it is this, which should pro-

tectthe arts and sciences, and give encouragement to man-
ufactures and. agriculture, thus increasing the comforts and
enjoyments of the community. a .

6. Such a thing is government; it is charged with all the
great interests of the community. It is designed for good;
but let us consider, that it is as pervading as the air We
breathe; that, if we bar our doors, it will still enter our
houses, and exert an influence upon all our interests.

7. But government is’ not a machine, that goes regularly
on, necessarily accomplishing its destined task. If it be
compared to a machine, it is one that needs skilful and dili-
gent care. It may be neglected, get . into disorder, and fail

" LESSON LXVII. Patrz'otz'sm..

l. PATRIOTISM, or love of country, is a sentiment which
pervades almost every human breast, and induces each indi-
vidual to prefer the land of his birth, not because it is bet-
ter than another country, but merely because it is his coun-
try. This sentiment may be illustrated by a variety of
anecdotes. -

2. Many of the Swiss, on account of the poverty of their
country, are induced to seek military service. in foreign
lands. Yet, in their voluntary exile, so strong is their affec-
tion for their native hills, that whole regiments have been
said to be on the point of desertion, in consequence of the
vivid recollections excited by one of their national songs.

3. “A French writer informs us, that a native of one of the
Asiatic isles, amid the splendors of Paris, beholding a ba-
nana tree in the Garden of Plants, bathed it with tears, and
seemed for a moment to be transported to his own land.
The Ethiopian imagines, that God made his sands and des-
erts, while angels only were employed in forming the rest
of the world. g‘ t

4. The Maltese, insulated on a rock, distinguish their
island by the appellation of “ the Flower of the World.”
The Japanese have such an affection for the place of their
nativity, that no advantages can induce them, particularly
the agricultural tribes, to quit the tombs of their fathers.

PATRIOTISM. 141

5. The Norwegians, proud of their barren summits,
inscribe upon their rix-dollars, “ Spirit, loyalty, valor, and
whatever is honorable, let the world learn among the rocks
of Norway.” The Esquimaux are no less attached to their
frigid zone, esteeming the luxuries of blubber-oil for food,
and an ice-cabin for habitation, above all the reﬁnements of
other countries.

6. Such are some of the exhibitions of this universal sen-
timent in less reﬁned nations. In a state of higher civiliza-
tion, it becomes a more exalted passion, and is thus beauti-
fully expressed by Scott:

“Breatlies there the man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,

‘ This is my own, my native land !’
Whose heart hath ne’er~ within him burned,
As home his footsteps he hath turned

From wand’ring on a foreign strand?

If such there be, go, mark him well ;
For him no minstrel raptures swell;
High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth as wish can claim;
8. Despite those titles, power, and pelf,

The wretch, concentrated all in self,

Living, shall forfeit fair renown,

And, doubly dying, shall go down

To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,

’ Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.”

N

9. It might at ﬁrst seem, that patriotism, which implies a
preference of one coun-try over another, was opposed to phi-
lanthro , which embraces in its enerous sco e the whole

P3’ _ 8 P
human family. . _ _ .
10. But a consideration of the practical effect of patrio-

tism, will lead us not merely to dismiss" all distrust, but to V

admire that dispensation of Providence, by which the inhab-
tants of every land,‘whether it be a region of sterile moun-
tains, or an inhospitable climate of snow, orta land ﬂowing
with milk and honey, or a desert of sand, are attached to the
soil where. their lot is cast.

11. In the ﬁrst place, this love is a source of content-

-ment and happiness, even though it may be founded on igno-

rance or false comparisons; and, in the second place, it
excites the people to seek the good and promote the pros-
perity of the inhabitants.

142 THE THIRD READER.

12. It stimulates them toact individually and unitedly ;
and, in cases of emergency, to put forth great efforts in the
sacred cause of country, whether it be to realize some desi-
rable object, or avert some threatened evil.

13. Thus it would appear, that, by implanting this sen-
timent in the breast of man, God has provided an active
agent, the design and tendency of which are, to cultivate
and cherish the advantages which each country possesses,
to develope its resources, to increase its comforts and riches,
to raise the standard of civilization, and, in short, to promote
its true glory. _ A

14.’ Such is the design and such the tendency of that seri-
timent, called patriotism; and, if it is more circumscribed in
its view than philanthropy, it is far removed from selﬁshness ;
and the bosom in which it dwells must be exalted and puri-
ﬁed, in proportion to the sway it is permitted to exercise
over the heart.

LESSON LXVIII. The Baptism of Christ.

1. IT was a green spot in the wilderness,
Touched by the river Jordan. The dark pine
Never had dropped its tassels on the moss,
Tufting the ‘leaning bank ; nor on the grass
Of the broad circle, stretching evenly
To the straight larches, had a heavier foot
Than the wild heron’s trodden. 2. Softly in,
Through a long aisle of willows, dim and cool,
Stole the clear waters with their muffled feet, '
And, hushing as they spread ‘into the light,
Circled the edges of the pebbled tank
Slowly, then rippled through the woods away.

THE BAPTISM or CHRIST. 143

3. Hither had come th’ Apostle of the wild,

Winding the river’s course. ’T was near the ﬂush
Of eve, and, with a multitude around,
Who from the cities had come out to hear,
He stood, breast-high amid the running/stream,
Baptizing, as the Spirit gave him power.

4. His simple raiment was of camel’s hair,

A leathern girdle close about his loins,

‘His beard unshorn, /andafor his daily meat
The locust and wild honey of the wood;
But like the face of Moses on_ the mount
Shone his rapt countenance, and in his eye
Burned the mild ﬁre of love ; as he spoke
The ear leaned to him, and persuasion swift
To” the chained spirit of the listener stole.

-5. Silent upon the green and sloping bank

The people sat, and while the leaves were shook
With the birds, dropping early to their nests,
And the gray eve came on, within their hearts
They mused, if he were Christ.‘ The rippling stream
Still turned its silver courses from his breast,

As he divined their thought. “ I but baptize,”

He said, “ with water ; but there cometh One,
The latchet of whose shoes I may not dare

Even to unloose. Hewill baptize with ﬁre

And with the Holy Ghost.” 6. And lo! while yet
The words’ were on his lips, he raised his eyes,
And on the bank stood Jesus. He had laid

His raiment off, and, with his loins alone

Girt with a mantle, and his perfect limbs,

Intheir angelic slightness, meek and bare,

He waited to go in. ,7. But John forbade;

And hurried to his feet and stayed him there,

And said, “ Nay, Master! I have need of thine,
‘Not thou of mine! ” and Jesus, with a smile

Of heavenly sadness, met his earnest looks,

And answered, “ Suffer it to beso now;

For thus it doth become me to fulﬁl

All righteousness.” And, leaning to the stream,
He took around him the A.postle’s arm,

And drew him gently to the midst.

144 THE THIRD READER.

8. The wood '

Was thick with the dim twilight as they came

Up from the water. With his clasped hands
Laid on his breast, th’ Apostle silently

Followed his Master’s steps,—-when lo! a light,
Bright as the tenfold glory of the sun,

Yet lambent as the softly burning stars,
Enveloped them, and from the heavens away,
Parted the dim blue ether, like a veil ;

And as a voice, fearful exceedingly,

Broke from the midst, “ This is my much-loved Son,
In whom I am well pleased,” a snow-white dove, .
Floating upon its wings, descended there,

And shedding a swift music from its plumes,
Circled, and ﬂuttered to the Savior’s breast.

LESSON LX.IX. Steamboats on the Mississippi.

1. IT imparts a feeling of energy and power to the be-
holder, as he ascends the Mississippi in one of the powerful
steamboat, to see the leviathan scudding up the eddies, as
though on the wing; and when it has run out the eddy,
again strike‘ the current. - ' .

2. The foam bursts in a sheet quite over the deck. She
quivers for a moment with the concussion; and then, as
though she had collected her energy, and vanquished her
enemy, she resumes her stately march, and mounts against
the stream, ﬁve or six miles an hour. ’

3. I have travelled in this way for days together, more
than a hundred miles in "a day, against the current of the
Mississippi. The diﬂiculty of ascending, used to be the
only circumstance of a voyage that was dreaded in the an-
ticioation‘.

STEAMBOATS ON THE MISSISSIPPI. 145

4. This diﬂiculty now disappears. A family_ in Pittsburg
wishes to make a social visit to a kindred family on Red
River. The trip is but two thousand miles. They‘ all go
together; servants, baggage, or “ plunder,” as the phrase is,
to any amount.

5. In twelve days, they reach the point proposed. Even

the return is but a short voyage. Surely the people of this

country will have to resist strong temptations, if they do not
become a social people. You are invited to a breakfast at

seventy miles distance. You go on board the/passing steam--

boat, and awake in the morning in season fortyour appoint-
ment. T i

6. The day will probably come, when the inhabitants of
the warm and sickly regions of the lower points of the Mis-

sissippi, will take their. periodical migrations to the north,
with. the geese and swans of the Gulf, and with them re-

turn in the winter.

7. A sea voyage, after all that can be said in its favor, is
a very different thing from all this. The barren and bound-
less expanse of waters,» soon tires upon every eye but a sea-

. man’s. I say nothing of fastening tables, and holding fast

to beds, or inability to write or to cook.

8. I leave out of sight sea-sickness, and the danger of de-
scending to those sea-green caves of which poetry has so
much to say.’ Here you arealways near the shore, always
see the green earth, can always eat, write, and sleep undis-
turbed. ' '

9. You can always obtain cream, fowls, vegetables, fruit,
wild game ; and in my mind there is no kind of comparison

between the comforts and discomforts of a sea and river’

voyage.
10. A stranger to this mode of travelling, would ﬁnd it‘

diﬂicult to describe his impressions upon ﬁrst descending’
the Mississippi in one of the better steamboats. He con-f
templates the prodigious establishment, with all its ﬁtting of

deck, common, and ladies’ cabin apartments. ‘

11. Overhead, about him and ‘below him, all is life and’
movement. He sees its splendid cabin, richly carpeted, its
ﬁnishings of mahogany, its mirrors and ﬁne furniture, and‘
its sliding tables, at which eighty passengers can sit down
with comfort. - Y

splendor, order, quiet, and regularity, far exceeding that of
taverns in general. You read, you converse, you walk, you
sleep, as you choose; for custom has prescribed, that every-
thing shall be “ sans cérémonie.”

13. The varied and ‘verdant scenery shifts" around you.
The trees, the gr_een islands, have an appearance, as by en-
chantment, of moving by you. The river-fowl, with their
white and extended lines, arewheeling their ﬂight above

.0u_ .

y 14. The sky is bright. The river is dotted with boats
above you, beside and below you. You hear the echo of
their bugles reverberating from the woods. Behind the
wooded point, yousee the ascending column of smoke, ris-
ing above the trees, which-san~nounces,»that another steamboat
is approaching you. ~  

15. This moving pageant glides through a narrow passage
between an island, thick set with young cotton woods, so
even, so regular, and beautiful, ‘that they seem to have been
planted for a pleasure-ground, -and the main shore. As you
shoot out again into the broad stream, you come in View of
a plantation, with all its busy and cheerful accompaniments.
At other times, you are sweeping along for many leagues to-
gether, where either shore is a boundless and pathless wil-
derness. .

16. And the contrast which is thus so strongly forced
upon the mind, of the highest improvement and the latest
invention of art, with the most lonely aspect of a grand but
desolate nature,——the most striking and complete assem-
blage of splendor and comfort, the cheerfulness of a ﬂoat-
ing hotel, which carries, perhaps, two hundred guests, with
a wild and uninhabitedforest, one hundred miles in Width,
the abode only .of owls, bears, and noxious animals, —the
strong contrast produces, to me at least, something of the
same pleasant sensation, that is produced by lying down to
sleep with the rain pouring on the roof immediately over-
head. ’ ~

.   LESSON VLXX. rm Village Pastor.

1. NEAR yonder copse, where once the garden smiled,
And still where many a garden ﬂower grows wild,
There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,
The village preacher’s modest mansion rose.

2. A man he was to all the country dear,
AY1.d_P§1§§_iL1.9‘...£lLGlLY!Lilh forty pounds a year;

Remote from towns he ran his godly race,
Nor e’er had changed, nor wished to change, his place;
» Unskilful he to fawn, or seek for power,
By doctrines fashioned tothe varying, hour;
Far other aims his heart had learned to prize,
More bent to raise the wretched than to rise.
3.— His house wasknown to all the vagrant train,
He chid their wanderings, but relieved their pain;
The long-remembered beggarwashis guest, T
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;
The ruined spendthrift, now no longer proud,
Claimed kindred there, and had his claims ‘allowed;
The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,
Sat by his ﬁre, and talked the night away;
Wept o’er his wounds, or, tales of sorrow done,
Shoiildered his crutch, and showed ‘how, ﬁelds were won.

4. Pleased with his g.ue.sts,_the good man learned to glow,
And quite forgot their vices in their woe;

Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
His pity gave ere charity began.

5. Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
And even his failings leaned to virtue’s side;
But, in his duty prompt at every call,
He watched and wept, he prayed and felt for all;

,BENEFITS OF INDUSTRY. 13

LESSON II. T /re Beneﬁts of Industry.

1.. THERE are many persons who look upon every species
of labor as an evil. Children are often unhappy, because
they must study to acquire knowledge; and men and women
sometimes complain, because they must sow before they can
reap. To all such persons I would tell the following alle-
gory,»which will teach them, that industry is a blessing, and
indolence a curse.

2. In the northwestern part of Asia there is a -famous
city, call-ed Bagdat. The people there believe in the exist-
ence of certain spiritual beings, whom they call genii.

3. Like fairies, they are supposed to have great power,
and to hold intercourse with mankind. All this is, of
course, a mere matter_of ‘fancy, but it will answer the pres-
e”r1't;pt,n'po‘se«-as well as if i~t”were true.

4. There was once in this city of Bagdat a7 little boy,
who was poor, and obliged to earn his daily bread by rear-
ing ﬂowers in a small garden.  

5. As the »-price of ﬂowers in that luxuriant climate is
extremely low, the boy was compelled to be very ‘industrious
in order to obtain necessary food and clothing.

6. But still he had good health, and he ate his coarse
meal with high relish and satisfaction. But this was not
his ‘greatest pleasure; his ﬂowe s were a perpetual source
of enjoyment. I a _ g a

7. They were his ﬂowers; be planted them, he watered
them, pruned and nurtured them. Besides all this, they
were the source of his livelihood. They gave him bread,
shelter, and raiment. I

8. He therefore loved them as if they were his compan-
ions. He saw them spring out of the ground with pleasure ;
he watched the budding «leaves and unfolding ﬂowers with
delight. ' ‘

9. But, at length, discontent sprung up in his mind, and, I

in the evening of a hot day, he sat down in his garden, and

began to murmur. .“I wish,” said he, ,“ that ﬂowers would

plant, and prune, and water themselves. I am tired of this

incessant toil. i _

And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,
To tempt its new-ﬂedged offspring to the skies,
He tried each art,.rep'roved each dull delay,
Allured to brighter worlds, and led the way.

6. Beside the bed where parting life was laid,

And sorrow, guilt, and pain by turns dismayed,
The reverend champion stood. At his control,
Despair and anguish ﬂed the struggling soul ;
Comfort came down, the trembling wretch to raise,
And his last faultering accents whispered praise.

7. At church, with meek and unaffected grace,
His looks adorned the venerable place; ‘
Truth from his lips prevailed with double sway,
And fools, who came to scoff, remained to pray.
The service past, around the pious man,
With ready zeal, each honest rustic ran;
Even childrenfollowed, with endearing wile,
And plucked his gown, to share the good man's smile.
8. His ready smile a parent’s warmth exprest,
Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distrest ;
To them his heart, his love, his griefs, were given,
- But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven.

Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread, ’
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.

LESSON LXXIII. The two Queens, Elizabeth of
England, and Isabella of Spain.

1. In the amiable qualities of her sex, Isabella’s superior-
ity becomes most apparent over her illustrious namesake,
Elizabeth of England, whose history presents some features
parallel to her own. Both were disciplined in early life by
the teachings of that stern nurse of wisdom, adversity.

2. Both were made to experience the deepest humiliation,
at the hands of their nearest relative. Both succeeded in
establishing themselves on the throne, after the most preca-
rious vicissitudes. ' Each conducted her kingdom through a
long and triumphant reign to a height of glory, which it had
never before reached. - '

3. Both lived to see the vanity of all earthly grandeur,
and to fall the victims of an inconsolable melancholy; and
both left behind an illustrious name, unrivalled in the subse-
quent annals of their country.

4. But with these few circumstances of their history, the
resemblance ceases. Their characters aﬁbrd scarcely a

oint of contact. Elizabeth, inheriting a large share of the
bold and bluff King Harry’s temperament, was haughty, ar-
rogant, coarse, and irascible.

5. Isabella,‘on the other hand, tempered the dignity of
royal station with the most bland and courteous manners.
Once resolved, she was constant inéther purposes, and her
conduct in public and private life, was characterized by
candor and integrity. ‘

152 THE THIRD READER.

6. Both may be said to have shown that magnanimity,
which is implied by the accomplishment of great objects
in the face of great obstacles.‘ But Elizabeth was desper-

ately selﬁsh; she was incapable of forgiving areal injury, /

but resented the slightest affront to her vanity ; and she was
merciless in exacting retribution.

'7. Isabella, on the other hand, lived only for others; was
ready at all times to sacriﬁce self to considerations of public
duty, and, far from personal resentments, showed the greatest
condescension and kindness to those who had most sensibly
injured her ; while her benevolent heart sought every
means to mitigate the authorized severities of law, ‘even
towards the guilty. _

8. Both possessed rare fortitude. Isabella, indeed, was
placed in situations which demanded. more frequent and
higher displays of it than her rival ; but no one will_ doubt a

full measure of this quality in the daughter of Henry the
‘ Eighth. I

9. Elizabeth was better educated, and every way more
highly accomplished, than Isabella. But the latter knew
enough to maintain her station with dignity :, and she en-
couraged learning by a muniﬁcent patronage.

10. The masculine powers and passions of I Elizabeth ‘

seemed to divorce her in a great measure from the peculiar
attributes of her. sex; at least, from those which constitute its
peculiar charm; for she had abundance of its foibles ; a
coquetry and love of, admiration, which age could not chill,
and a fondness for dress, and tawdry magniﬁcence of orna-
ment,‘which was ridiculous, or disgusting, according to the
different periods of life in which it was indulged. She is
s-aid to have left, at her decease, three thousand dresses in
her wardrobe. _ ' \

ll. Isabella, on the other hand, was distinguished through
life for decorum of manners, and content with the affection
she could inspire within the range of her domestic circle. Far
from a frivolous affectation of ornament or dress, she was
most simple in her own attire, and seemed to set no value on
her jewels, but as they could serve the necessities of the
state; and when they could be no longer useful in this way,
she gave them away to her friends.

12. The circumstances of their deaths, which were some-
what similar, displayed the great dissimilarity of their char-

FAREWELL SONG. 153

acters. Both ‘pined amidst their royal state, a prey to incu-
rable despondency, rather than any marked bodily distemper.

13. In Elizabeth, it sprung from wounded vanity, a sullen
conviction, that she had outlived the admiration on which
she had so long fed, and even the solace of friendship, and
the attachment of her subjects. Nor did she seek consola-
tion where alone it was to be found in that sad hour.

14. Isabella, on the other hand, sunk under a too acute
sensibility to the sufferings of others. But, amidst the gloom
which gathered around her, she looked with the eye of faith
to the brighter‘ prospects which unfolded of the future ; and
when she resigned her last breath, it was amidst the tears
and universal lamentations of her people.

15. We see but one judgment formed of her whether

by foreigners or natives. The French and Italian writers

equally join in celebrating the triumphant glories of her reign,
and her magnanimity, wisdom, and purity of character.

16. Her own subjects extol her as “the most brilliant
exemplar of every virtue,” and mourn over the day of her
death, as “the last of the prosperity and happiness of their
country.” . —

Note. This ﬁne passage aﬂbrds abundant materials for reflection. It
shows, that wealth and power cannot shield the heart from unhappiness. It
shows, that meanness may dwell in a queen, and that vanity, haughtiness, and
cruelty, are to be condemned wherever they are found. Elizabeth, the queen of
England, showed great talents, and her government on the whole was beneﬁ-
cial to her people. Isabella, of . Spain, was also a good queen, but she was
an amiable woman. Her memory is cherished to this day by the Spaniards.
It was she who furnished to Columbus the means of ﬁtting out the expedition
which led to the discovery of America. V

THE SCOTCH SHEPHERD AND HIS DOG. 155

LESSON LXXV. The Scotch Shepherd and his Dog

;S'irrah.

1. MY dog was always my companion. I conversed with
him the whole day; I shared every meal with him, and my
plaid, in the time of a shower ; the consequence was, that I
generally had the best dogs in all the country.

2.‘ The ﬁrst remarkable one that I had was named Sirrah.
He was, beyond all comparison», the best dog I ever saw.
He was of a surly, unsocial temper, disdained all ﬂattery,
and refused to be caressed; but his attention to his master’s
commands and interests never will be again equalled by any
of the canine race. a r v

3. The ﬁrst time I saw him, a droverwas leading him in
a rope ; he was hungry and lean, and far from being a beau-
tiful our, for he was all over black, a.nd had a grim face,
striped with dark brown. The man had bought him of a
boy for three shillings, somewhere on the Border, and,
doubtless, had. used him very ill on his journey.

4. I thought I discovered a sort of sullen intelligence in
his face, notwithstanding his"dejec.ted and forlorn situation ;
so I gave the drover a guinea for him, and appropriated the
captive to myself. I believe there‘ never was‘ a guinea so
well laid out; at least I am satisﬁed, that I never laid out
one to so good purpose.   I y

5. He was scarcely then a year old, and knew so little
of herding, that he had never turned sheep in his life; but
as soon as he discovered that it was his duty to do so, and
that it obliged me, I can never forget with what. anxiety and
eagerness he learned his different evolutions. s

6. He would try every way deliberately, till he found out I

what I wanted him to do; and when once I made him to
understand a direction, he never forgot or mistook it again.

7. Well as I knew him, he very often astonished me:-; for
when hard pressed in accomplishing the task that hevwassput
to, he had expedients of the moment, that bespoke a great
share of the reasoning faculty.

8. ‘Were I to relate all his exploits, it would require a
volume; I shall only mention one or two, to prove what
kind -of an animal he was. ‘ I

9. I was a shepherd for two years on the same farm,

155 THE THIRD READER.

where I had ‘always about seven hundred lambs put under
my charge every year, at weaning time. As they were of
the short or black-faced breed, the breaking of them was a
very ticklish and diﬂicult task. '

10. I was obliged to watch them night and day, for the
ﬁrst four days, during which time, I had always a person to
assist me. It happened one year, that, just about midnight,
the lambs broke loose, and came up the moor ‘upon us,
making a noise with their running louder than thunder. -

11. We got up and waved our plaids, and shouted, in
hopes to turn them, but we only made matters worse; for in
a moment they were all around us, and by our exertions we
cut them into three divisions ; one of these ran north,
another south, and those that came up between us, straight
up the moor to the westward.

12. I called out “ Sirrah, my man, they are away; ” the

_ word, of all others, that set him most upon the alert, but

owing, to the darkness of the night, and blackness of the
moor, I never saw him at all. 

13. As the division of the lambs that ran southward were
going straight towards the fold, where they had‘ been that
day taken from their dams, I was afraid they would go there,
and again mix with them; so I threw off part of my clothes
and pursued them, and by great personal exertion, and the
help of another old dog that I had besides Sirrah, I turned
them, but in a few minutes afterwards lost them altogether.

14. I ran here and there, not knowing what to do, but
always, at intervals, gave a loud whistle-to Sirrah, to let him
know that I was depending on him. , By/that whistling, the
lad who was assisting me found me out ; buthe likewise had
lost all trace whatsoever o-f the lambs.

15. I asked, if he had never seen Sirrah. He said,
he had not; but that, after I left him, a wing of the lambs
had, come" round‘ him with a twirl,’ and that he supposed
Sirrah had given them a turn, though he could not see him
for the darkness. "“ y ”

16. We both concluded, that, whatever way the lambs ran

at ﬁrst, they would ﬁnally land at the fold wherethey left V

their mothers, and,‘ without delay, we bent our course to-
wards that; but when we came there, there was nothing of
them, nor any kind of bleating to be heard, and we dis-9
covered-with vexation that we had come on a wrong track.

THE scorcn SHEPHERD AND HIS DOG. 157

17. ’My companion then bent hiscourse towards the farm
of Glen, on the north, and I ran away westward for several
miles, along the wild track where the lambs had grazed
while following their dams. We met after it was day, far
up in a place called the “ Black.Cleuch,” but neither of us
had been able to discover our lambs, nor any traces of them.

18. It was /the most extraordinary circumstance that had
ever occurred in the annals of the pastoral life! iWe had
nothing to do but to return to our master, and inform him,
that we had lost his whole ﬂock of lambs, and knew not
what was become of one of them.

19. On our way home, however, we discovered a body of
lambs at the bottom of a deep ravine, called the “Flesh
Cleuch,” and the indefatigable Sirrah standing infront of

them, looking all around for some relief, but still standing

true to his charge. - «

. 20. ‘The sun was then up; and when we ﬁrst came in
view of them, we concluded that it was one of the divisions
of the lambs, which Sirrah had been unable to manage until
he came to that commanding situation, for it was-about a

- mile and a half distant from the place where? they ﬁrst -broke

and scattered.   4

21. But what was our astonishment, when we discovered’
by degrees, that not one lamb of the whole ﬂock was want-
ing ! How he had got all the divisions collected in the dark
is beyond comprehension. ’

22. The charge was left entirely to himself, from midnight '

until the rising of thesun; and if all the shepherds in the
forest had been there to assist him, they could not have
effected it with greater propriety. All that I can say farther
is, that I never felt so grateful to any creature below the
sun, as I did to Sirrah that morning. ~,

bring me ﬂowers already made, so that I might be saved
all this trouble!” Scar-cely had he uttered this thought,
when a beautiful being in bright colors, stood before him,
and said, “ You called me, boy; what do you desire’! ”

11. “I am weary of my employment,” said the boy.

“ I live by cultivating ﬂowers. I am obliged to toil, day’

by day, with unceasing industry, and I am only able to
obtain my daily bread. If I mistake not, you are a kind
and powerful genius, who can give me ﬂowers if you will,
and save me all this toil.” '

12. “ Here!” said the genius, holding forth a beautiful
fan of feathers, “take this; wave it over the earth in your
ﬂower-pots, and the brightest blossoms of Cashmere will
spring up at your bidding!” Saying this, the spirit de-
parted. ,

13. The little boy received the charmed fan with great
delight, and waved itover one of his ﬂower-pots. A bud
immediately shot up through the soil, gradually unfolded
itself, and in «a few minutes a beautiful moss-rose, bloom-
ing and fragrant, stood before him! ,

1,4. I need not describe the transports of the little gar-
dener. He found his charmed fan to be just the thing he
had desired. He had now no labor to perform; a few
sweeps of his fan brought him all the ﬂowers he needed.
He therefore spent his time in luxurious indolence.

15. Things went on very well for afortnight. But now
a different kind of . weariness began to creep over him.
His appetite, too, failedﬂby degrees, and he no longer ‘en-
joyed his meals. He lost his interest, likewise, in the
ﬂowers. He saw no beauty in their bloom; their very
odor became sickening.

16. The poor boy was unhappy, and again began to
murmur. “ I wish,” said he, “ the genius would come back
and take away this foolish fan.’.’ In a’ moment the bright
being was standing at his side. '

1'7. “ Here,” said the boy, handing forth the fan, “take
back the charm you gave me. Forgive me, sweet genius,
but I was mistaken. “The weariness of indolence is far
worse than the weariness of industry. I loved the ﬂowers
which were produced by my own skill and care ; but things

And thecrimson leaf of the dulse is seen

And the yellow and scarlet tufts of ocean

Are bending like corn on the upland lea :

LESSON LXXVII. a Washington in Retirement.

1. THERE is no part of Washington’s career which. com-
mands more admiration than his private life, after he had
retired’ from the presidency of the United States. ~ Having
served his country as a soldier and a chief magistrate, he

_had yet something to do,— to set a great and noble exam-

ple in thesurrender of power and personal ambition. The
following passages will show, that in this, as in everything
else, he seemsto be superior to almost all other men.

2. Being established again at Mount Vernon, and freed
from public toils and cares, Washington returned to the
same habits of life and the same pursuits, which he had al-
ways practised at that place. a In writing to a friend, a few
Weeks after his return, he said, that he began his daily
course with the rising of the sun, and ﬁrst made prepara-
tions for the business of the day.

3., “ By the time I have accomplished these matters,” he

adds, “breakfast is ready. This being over, I mount my

horse and ride ‘round my farms, which employs -me until it is
time to dress for dinner, at which I rarely miss seeing strange
faces, come, as they say, out of respect for me.

4. “ The usual time of sitting at table, awalk and tea,
bring me within the dawn of candlelight; previous-,to which,
if not prevented by company, I resolve, that as soon as the
glimmering taper supplies the place of the great luminary,
I will retire to my writing-table, and acknowledge the letters
I have received. Having given you this historyiof a day,
it will serve for :a year.” ‘ .

5. ‘And in this manner a year passed away, and with no
other variety than that of the change of visiters, who came
from all parts, to pay their respects, or gratify their curiosity.

150 THE THIRD READER.

6. The feelings of Washington on being relieved from
the solicitude and burdens of office, were forcibly expressed
in letters to his friends. “ At length,” said he, in writing to
Lafayette, “ I am become a private citizen, on the banks
of the Potomac; and under the shadow of my own vine and
ﬁg-tree, free from the bustle of a’ camp, and the busy scenes
of public life, I am solacing myself with those tranquil en-
joyments, of which the soldier, who is ever in pursuit of
fame, the statesman, whose watchful days and sleepless
nights are spent in devising schemes to promote the Welfare
of his own, perhaps the ruin of other countries, as if this
globe was insuﬂicient for us all, and the courtier, who is
always watching thercountenance of his prince, in hopes of
catching a gracious smile, can have very little conception.

7. “ I have not only retired from all public employ-
ments, but I am retiring within myself, and shall be able to

_ view the solitary walk, and tread the paths of private life,

with heartfelt satisfaction. Envious of none, I am deter-
mined to be pleased with all ; and this, my dear friend, be-
ing the order of my march, I will move gently down the
stream of life, until I sleep with my fathers.”

1. My Beloved had a vineyard,

And he planted it with the vine of Sorek ;
And he built a tower in the midst of it,

And he hewed out also a lake therein :
And he expected, that it should bring forth grapes,
But it brought forth poisonous berries.

3. And now, 0 inhabitants of Jerusalem, and ye men of

Judah,

Judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard:

4. What could have been done more to my vineyard,
Than I have done unto it?

‘i , Why, when I expected that it should bring forth grapes,

Brought it forth poisonous berries’! ,
5. But come now, and I will make known unto you,
What I purpose to do to my vineyard :
To remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured;
To destroy its fence, and it shall be trodden down.
6. And I will make it a desolation :
And it shall not be pruned, neither shall it be digged ;
But the brier and the thorn shall spring up in it ; '
And I will command the clouds,
That they shed no rain upon it.
7. Verily, the vineyard of J EHOVAH GOD of Hosts is the
house of Israel;
And the men of Judah the plant of his delight :
And he looked for judgment, but behold tyranny ;
-And for righteousness, but behold the cry of the
oppressed. I

The clamorous horn along the cliffs above ;‘

The hollow murmur of the ocean-tide ;

And the full choir that wakes the universal grove.

2. The cottage-curs at early pilgrim bark;
Crowned with her pail the tripping milkmaid sings;
The Whistling ploughman stalks aﬁeld ; and, hark !
Down the rough slope the ponderous wagon rings:
Through rustling com the hare astonished springs ;
Slow tolls the village-clock the drowsy hour;
The partridge bursts away on whirring wings;
Deep mourns the turtle in sequestered bower, A
And shrill lark carols clear from her aerial tour. .

LESSON LXXX. The Deep.

THERE ’s beauty in the deep : —
The wave is bluer than the sky ; T
And though the light shine bright on high,
More softly do the sea-gems glow
That sparkle in the depths below’;
The rainbow’s tints are only made
When on the watersthey are laid,
And sun and moon most sweetly shine
Upon the ocean’s level brine.
There ’s beauty in the deep.

There ’s music i_n the deep: —
It is not in the surl’s_rough roar,
Nor in the whispering, shelly shore,_——
They are but earthly sounds, that tell‘
How little of the sea-nymph’s shell,
That sends its loud, clear note abroad,
Or winds its softness through the ﬂood,
Echoes through groves with coral gay,
And dies, on spongy banks, away.
There ’s music in the deep.

FALLS OF NIAGARA. 163

3. There ’s quiet in the deep : —e-
Above, let tides and tempests rave,
And earth-born whirlwinds wake the wave;
Above, let care and fear contend,
With sin and sorrow to the end :
Here, far beneath the tainted foam,
. That frets above our peaceful home,
We dream in joy, and wake in love,
. Nor know the rage that yells above.
There ’s quiet in the deep.

LESSON LXXXI. Thoughts suggested by the Falls of
Niagara. _

1. THE thoughts are strange that crowd into my brain,
' While I look upward to thee. It would seem
As if God poured thee from his “ hollow hand,”
And hung hisbow upon thine awful front;
And spoke in that loud voice, which seemed to him
Who dwelt in Patmos for his Savior’s sake,
“ The sound of many waters ; ” and had bade
Thy ﬂood to chronicle the ages back,
And notch His cent’ries in the eternal rocks.

2. Deep calleth unto deep. And what are we,
That hear the question of that voice sublime?
Oh ! what are all the notes that ever rung
From war’s vain trumpet, by thy thundering side!
Yea, what is all the riot man can make
In his short life, to thy unceasing roar !
And yet, bold babbler, what art thou to him,
VVho drowned a world, and heaped the waters far
Above its loftiest. mountains ’! ‘-4- a light wave,
That breaks, and whispers of its Maker’s might.

should Lesson 89 be read '2 Rule 5. In. what tone should Lesson 90 be read '1
Rule 6. How should Lesson 91 be read '2 Rule 10.

LESSON LXXXII. A Vainglorious Jllilitary Chief

A 1. GENERAL VAN PoFFENBUReH’s fortress being ﬁnished,
it would have done any man’s heart good to behold into what
a magnitude he immediately swelled. He would stride in
and out a dozen times a day, surveying it in front and in
rear ; on this side and on that. it

2. Then would he dress himsel.f in full regimentals, and
strut backwards and forwards, for hours together, on the top
of his little rampart, like a vainglorious cock-pigeon va-

' poring on the top of his coop.

3. In a word, unless my readers have noticed, with curi-
ous eye, the petty commander. of one of our little snivel-
ling military posts, swelling with all the vanity of new regi-
men—ta'~ls, and the pomposity derived from commanding a
handful of tatterdemalions, I despair of giving them any
adequate ideaeof the prodigious dignity of General Van
Peffenburgh.

4, It is recorded in the delectable romance of Pierce
Forest, that a young knight being dubbed by king Alexan-
der, did incontinently gallop into an adjoining forest, and
belabor the trees with such might and main, that the
whole court W.as convinced, that he was the most potent and
courageous gentleman on the face of the earth.

5. In like manner, the great Van Polfenburgh would ease
off his valorous spleen. At such times, when he found his
martial spirit waxing hot Within, he would prudently sally
forth into the ﬁelds, and, lugging out his trusty sabre, would
lay about him most lustily, decapitating cabbages by pla-
toons; hewing down whole phalanxes of sun-ﬂowers, which
he termed gigantic Swedes; and if, peradventure, he espied
a colony of honest pumpkins quietly basking themselves in
the ‘sun, “Ah, caitilf Yankees,” would he roar, “ have _I
caught ye at last?”   .

6. So saying, with one sweep of his sword, he would
cleave the unhappy vegetables from their chin to their waist-

bands; by which warlike havoc his choler being in some
sort allayed, he would return to his garrison with a__ full con-
viction, that he was a very miracle of military prowess.

7. The next ambition of General Van Poffenburgh Was
to be thought a strict disciplinarian. Well knowing that
discipline is the soul of all military enterprise, he enforced
it with the most rigorous precision; obliging every man to
turn out his toes and hold up his head on parade, and pre-
scribing the breadth of their rufﬂes to all such as had any
shirts to their backs.

8. Having one day encountered the history of Absalom
and his melancholy end, the General, in an evil hour, issued
orders for cropping the hair of both officers and men,
throughout the garrison.

9. Now it came to pass, that among his oﬂicers was one

‘Kildermeester, a sturdy veteran, who had cherished, through

the course of a long life, a rugged mop of hair, not a little
resembling the‘ shag of a Newfoundland dog, terminating
with an immoderate queue, like the handle of a frying-pan,
and queued so tightly to his head, that his eyes and mouth

_ generally stood ajar, and his eyebrows were drawn up to the

top of his forehead.

10. It may naturally be supposed, that. the possessor of
so goodly an appendage would resist with abhorrence an
order condemning it to the shears. On hearing the gen-
eral orders, he discharged a tempest of veteran, soldier-like
wrath, --declared he would break any man’s head who at-
tempted to meddle with his queue, made itstiffer than ever,
and whisked it about the garrison as ﬁercely as the tail of a
crocodile. The eel-skin queueof old Kildermeester became
instantly an affair of the utmost importance. -

11. The Commander-in-chief was too enlightened an

ofiicer not to, perceive, that the discipline of the garrison,

' the subordination and good order of the armies of the

N new-Nederlandts, the consequent safety of the whole prov-
ince, and ultimately the dignity and prosperity of their
High Mightinesses, the Lords States-Generalfabove all, the
dignity of the great General Van Poﬁenburgh, all imperi-
ously demanded the docking of that stubborn queue.

12. He therefore determined that old Kildermeester should
be publicly shorn of his glories in the presence of the whole
garrison ; — but the old man as resolutely stood on the defen-

highly exasperated, and the offender was arrested and tried ‘

by a court-martial for mutiny, desertion, and all the other
list of offences noticed in the articles of war, ending with a

“Videlicet, in wearing an eel-skin queue, three feet long,

contrary to orders.” a

13. Then came on arraignments, and trials, and plead-
ings; and the whole country was in a ferment aboutlthis
unfortunate queue. As it is well known, that the command-
er of a distant frontier post has the poweryof acting pretty
much after his own will, there is little doubt, that the veter-
an Would have been hanged, or shot, at least, had he not
luckily fallen ill of a fever, through mere chagrin and mor-
tiﬁcation, and most ﬂagitiously deserted from all earthly
command, with his beloved locks unviolated.

14. His obstinacy remained unshaken to the very last mo- A

ment, when he‘ directed, that he should be carried to the
grave with his eel-skin queue unmolested.

Note on the Lesson. This humorous description refers to the history of the

LESSON III. Neatness and Order. I

1. THERE is more comfort in neatness and order than
most people imagine. There is also much virtue in these
things. They stamp themselves, after long habit, on the
mind and heart, and, to some extent, mould the intellectual
and moral character. 2

2. No being but a pig is happy and at ease in the midst
of ﬁlth and confusion; and if a person, by living among
these for a long time, gets reconciled to them, he is so far
depraved and degraded toward the standard of one of the
lowest of the brute "creation.

deserves to be recorded in history,not only on account of
his dauntless courage and eccentric habits, but because his
life and achievements present a glowing picture of the suf-
ferings of those who subdued the western forests.   He stands

forward, too, as a prominent individual of a class peculiar to ,.

the United States. ’ V

2. _The American, who takes a retrospective view of the
early history of his country, must regard with admiration the
sturdy Woodsman, who, as the pioneer of civilization, ﬁrst
laid the axe to the tree, and made smooth the ‘road for others;
but we shall ﬁnd him an isolated being,» possessing tastes
and habits of his own, and voluntarily supporting incredible
hardships, peril, and privation, without‘ the usual incentives
to, or the ordinary rewards .of, courage. K

3. In the year 1769, Daniel Boon, a respectable farmer
of North Carolina, was led by a restless, migratory spirit,
into the forests of Kentucky, then an extensive wilderness,
inhabited by numberless savage tribes, and as yet unex-
plored by civilized man. i

4. Passing the Alleghany Ridge, whose hideous precipices
alone might have repelled a less determined band, guided
only by the stars, depending on game for subsistence, and

on their own vigilance and prowess for protection, Boon,

with ﬁve adventurous companions, plunged into the “ bound-
less contiguity of shade,” and boldly cut the tie which
bound them to society. The mariner, when heflooks abroad
upon the vast, interminable waste, may feel a depressing,
yet awful and sublime sense of danger, and solitude; but
he has the consolation of knowing, that, however dreary
may be the scene, its dangers‘a1'e few and easily surmount-
ed; they exist rather in idea than in reality. I I

5. Boon and his companions could have had no such
animating reﬂections. In a country called the “Bloody
Ground,” (from the exterminating character of its conﬂicts,)
among savage tribes, continually at war with -each other, and
agreeing in nothing’ but their "deadly enmity to the Whites;
cut off from society; with scanty means of defence, and no
hope of retreat, We scarcely know whether to extol the cour-
age, or censure the rashness, of this gallant little party.

6. They continued in Kentucky, until the year 1775,
leading a wandering life, employed chieﬂy in exploring the
country, and frequently engaged in conﬂicts with the In-
dians. In 1775, Boon -erected a fort at a salt lick, on the
Kentucky River, where the town of Boonsborough now
stands, which was called Fort Boonsborough, and to which
he removed his family in the same year. I

7. “My wife and daughters,” says he in his Journal,
“ were the ﬁrst white women that ever stood on the banks of
the Kentucky, River.” Here he was joined by ﬁve families
from North Carolina, and forty men from Powell’s Valley.
During the years 1775, 6, and 7, Fort Boonsborough was fre-
quently attacked, by the Indians, and several severe engage-
ments took place, in which the savages were always repulsed.

8. Boon’s settlement began now to exhibit something like
a permanent residence of civilized men. The forest was
levelled around the fort, ﬁelds were enclosed and cultivated,

andirustic labors were mingled with the business of war, and
the sports of the chase. Their numbers were now suﬂicient,
in general, to prevent ‘surprise; and, in case of danger, the
fortress offered a secure retreat. _ s

9. Nevertheless, in January, 1778, while Boon was en-
gaged with a party of twenty-seven men, in making salt at
the Blue Lick, they were surprised and taken by a large
body of Indians, who were on their way to attack the fort,

and conveyed to the Chillicothe, on the Little Miami, then a

considerable Indian town. .

10. In the month of March following, Boon was carried
with ten of his men to Detroit, where the party was well
treated by the British Governor Hamilton, as indeed they
had hitherto been by the Indians, agreeably to a stipulation
made at the time of their capture. The gallant bearing of
Boon, and his skill in hunting, had by this time, endeared

"him to the Indians, so that, although the British officers of-

fered a hundred pounds sterling for him,-— with the intention
of setting him at liberty, they would not_sell him, nor would
they allow him to remain a prisoner with his companions at
Detroit, but took him back with them to Chillicothe. '

ll. “ Here,” says his Journal, “ I was adopted into the fam-
ily of a chief as a son, which is their custom, and permitted
to hunt and spend my time as I pleased. In.June following,
they took me to Sciota Salt Springs, where we continued
making salt for ten days. On our return to Old Chillicothe,
I was alarmed to see four hundred and ﬁfty Indians, the
choicest of their warriors, painted and armed in a fearful
manner, and ready, as I found, to march against Boons-
borough. ’ e ~

12. “I now determined to make my escape on the ﬁrst
opportunity; there was no time to be lost. On the 16th,
before sunrise, I got off in the most secret manner, and on
the 20th, arrived at Boonsborough, a distance of one hun-
dred and sixty miles, while travelling which, I had but one
meal.” On arriving at his settlement, Boon found the peo-
ple in a critical situation. - About four hundred Indians. led
by French oﬂicers, were approaching; and, though thééiyvhitesa
had been reinforced by troops from Virginia, they were still
inferior to the enemy. These at last arrived, but, by-«the
skill and courage of, Boon, they were baffled in their schemes,
and at length retired. I I " I ‘ " *

13. These brief sketches are interesting from the evidence
they afford of the heroic character of a western Woodsman,
of early times. Boon was the chief of these, the very prince
of hunters, If many of the heroes of Greece and Rome
derived immortal fame from a single act of heroism, how
much «more does Boon deserve it, whose Whole life presents
a series of adventures of the same character as those which
I have been relating? ’ K L

‘14. Nor did he suﬂer and conquer alone; his wife accom-
panied him “to the wilderness, and shared his dangers; dur-
ing his captivity, under a belief, that he had fallen asacriﬁce
tolthe ferocity of the savage foe,,she returned with her fam-
ily to her father’s house, in North Carolina, braving the toil
and perils of a journey through a wilderness of immeasur.
able extent and gloom. She remained there till after the
siege, when Boon escorted her back to Boonsborough.

To tell thy mother at even tide’!

And long to go to thy quiet sleep.

4. Well were it then, if thine aching brow

Were as free from sin and shame as now !

Well for thee, if thy lip could tell

A tale like this, of a day spent well;

If thine open hand hath relieved distress,

If thy pity hath, sprung to wretchedness;

If thou hast forgiven the sore offence,

And humbled thy heart with penitence;

If ,nature’s voices have spoken to thee

With their holy meanings eloquently;

If every creature hath won thy love,

From the creeping worm to the brooding dove ;

If never a sad, low-spoken word,

Hath pleaded with thy heart unheard ;

Then, when the night steals on as now,

It will bring relief to thine aching brow,

And, with joy and peace at the thought of rest,

Thou wilt sink to sleep on thy mother’s breast.

LESSON LXXXVII." Character of Columbus.

1. THERE is considerable uncertainty as to Columbus’s
age, though it seems probable it was not far from seventy, at
the time of his death. His person has been minutely de-
scribed by his son. He was tall and well-made, his head
large, with an aquiline nose, small light blue or greyish eyes,
a fresh complexion and red hair, though incessant toil and
exposure had bronzed the former, and bleached the latter,
before the age of thirty. .

2. He had a majestic presence, with much dignity, and at
the same time, affability of manner. He was" ﬂuent, even
eloquent in discourse; generally temperate in deportment,
but sometimes hurried by a too lively sensibility into a sally
of passion. He was abstemious in his diet, indulged little

- in amusements of any kind, and, in truth, seemed too much

absorbed by the great cause to which he had consecrated his
life, to allow scope for the lower pursuits and pleasures,
which engage ordinary men.

3. Indeed, his imagination, by feeding too exclusively on
this lofty theme, ~ acquired an unnatural exaltation, which
raised him too much above the sober realities of existence;
leading him to spurn at difﬁculties, -which in the end proved
insurmountable, and to color the future with those rainbow
tints, whichtoo often melted into air. , _

4. This exalted state of the imagination was the result in

part, no doubt, of the peculiar circumstances of his life,

For the glorious enterprise which he had achieved, almost
justiﬁed the conviction of his acting under the inﬂuence of
some higher inspiration, than mere human reason, and led
his devout mind to discern intimations respecting himself, in
the dark and mysterious annunciations of sacred prophecy.
5. That the romantic coloring of his mind, however, was
natural to him, and ‘not purely the growth of circumstances,
is evident from the chimerical speculations in which he se-
riously indulged before the accomplishment of his great dis-
coveries. Hisscheme of a crusade for the recovery of the
Holy Sepulchre was most deliberately meditated, and stren-
uously avowed from the veryﬁrst date of his proposals to the
Spanish government. His enthusiastic communications_on
the subject, must have provoked a smile from apontiff like

CHARACTER or COLUMBUS. 

Alexander the Sixth ; and may suggest some apology for the
tardiness, with which his more rational, projects were accred-
ited by the Castilian government.

6. But these visionary fanc.ies never clouded his judgment.

in matters relating 1:0 his great u.nder:t_a_king; and it is cu-
rious to observe the, prapheti_c a.c,cur;~1cy, with which he dis-
cerned not only the existence, but the ‘eventual resources,
of the western world; as is sufﬁciently evinced by his pre-
cautions, to the very last, to secure the full fruits of them,
unimpaired, _to his posterity.

7. Whatever were the defects of his mental constitution,

the ﬁnger of the historian will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to point to a

single blemish in his moral cha.racter. His Qurmspondence
breathes the sentiment of devoted loyalty to ‘his sovereigns.
His conduct habitually displayed the utmost. Sﬂlicaitude for the
interests of his folklwers. A He -exp,ended almost his last
maravedi in restoring his unfortunate crew to their native
land. N " ‘

8. His dealings were regulated by the .nicest principles of
honor and ‘native. His last communication to the sovereigns
from the indies rerno.nstra,tes< against.  use} of violent
measures‘, in order to extract gold from the natives, as a
thin . equally ;S9ﬂI1£ltl.l13l&$ and irnpolitie. The grand object
to w ich he dedicated ,himself, seemed to expands his whole
soul, and raised it .above -the petty shivfts and ﬂfftiﬁces, by
which great ends are sQr_ne.times sought to be cornpassed.

9. There are some men, in whom rare virtues have been
closely allied, if not to positive vice, to deg1'~ra.di.ng» weakness.
Columbus’s character presented no such humiliating incon-
gruity.. Whether We contemplate it,in its public‘ ‘ or private
relations, in all its -features it wears the same, -noble aspect.
It was in perfegt harmony with the grandeur of his plans
and their results, more $tupend0.nS’1§l1%.n those which Heaven
has permitted any other mortal to achieve. i i

4. In front of the house is the wood-pile, spread out so
as to cover a mod of ground. As you pass by, the barn,
cow-house, and yard with its deep morass of manure in high
ﬂavor, salute the eye and nose.

5. The pig—pen, wide open and in full view, is between
the house and barn. In a warm day, the congregation of
vapors is overwhelming. The well, the wash.-shed, the
wood-shed, all are in full view to the» passers by. The
space around the front door is deﬁled by the pigs, that root
and grunt there by day, and by the geese, that lodge there

. by night.

6. Thus all the unsightly and unseemly objects are spread

u out to view, and the scene is embellished by the addition of

broken sleighs, sleds, ploughs, wagons, carts, old posts, &c.
There lies a shapeless heap of stones; yonder is a gate
hanging by one hinge, which will soon be broken for want
of care. Here is af pair of bars thrown down; there the

' stone wall has tumbled over!

'7. Such is the scene presented by the residence of a
wealthy, respectable farmer in New England; and I am
sorry to say that there are hundreds, nay thousands, like if
in New England; ay, in New England! Not that every
village is a Decay, or that every farmer is a Wideopen.
No! some of our villages are delightful, and some of our
country people are patterns of good order and neatness.

8. But I am speaking of those who are not so. And if
these pages should come into the hands of any person, in
New England or out of it, who is ignorant of the advan-
tages of neatness and order, let me urge upon him, as Wor-
thy of immediate attention, the following remarks, drawn
from observation and experience. ,

9. A man, whose house, like Captain Wideopen’s, is out
of doors marked by disorder, confusion, and want of clean-
liness, has generally the same within doors.

10. Where there is confusion and want of neatness,
though there may be plenty of bread, butter, milk, cheese,
fuel, clothing, and other necessaries, there is little comfort,
little thrift, little good nature, little kindness, little religion,
little beauty, little peace or happiness. 4

11. Persons brought up in the midst of confusion and‘
want of cleanliness, are likely to be low, vulgar, and
vicious in their tastes and in their character. 'Qhild_reI,_1,

LESSON LXXXIX. Tile Discovery.

1. Ir was on the morning of Friday, 12th October, 1492,
that Columbus first beheld the New World. When the
day dawned, he saw before him a level and beautiful island,
several leagues in extent, of great freshness and verdure, and
covered with trees like a continual orchard.

2. Though everything appeared in the wild luxuriance of
untamed nature, yet the island was evidently populous, for
the inhabitants were seen issuing from the woods, and run-
ning from all parts to the shore, where they stood gazing at
the ships.

3. Columbus made signal for the ships to cast anchor,
and the boats to be manned and armed. He entered his
own boat, richly attired in scarlet, and bearing the royal
standard, while Martin Alonzo Pinzon, and Vincent Yaﬁez,
his brother, put off in company, in their boats, each bearing
the banner of the Enterprize. Immediately on landing,
Columbus proceeded to take formal possession of the country.

4. The natives of the island, when, at the dawn of day
they had beheld the ships, with their sails set, hovering on
their coast, had supposed them some ‘monsters, which had
issued from the deep during the night. They had crowded
to the beach, and watched their movements with awful
anxiety.

5. Their veering about apparently without effort, the
ahiftin and furling of their sails, resembling huge wings,
ﬁlled am with astonishment. When they behold the boat:

and neatness to cause ruin and waste; consequently, a man,

18 THE THIRD READER.

2. And this arises from the good taste, neatness, a._n.dT'
order, which characterize the inhabitants. I will give you;
a sketch of the house belonging to Captain John Pepper-

idge; a careful, correct, upright man, who has risen from
poverty, to ease and competence, by industry, economy, and
prudence. i ‘

3. His house stands three or four rods back from th

street; the front yard is green, grassy, and decorated with

handsome trees. The wood-pile is fenced in; the barn-
yard, pig-pen, &c., are also tidily fenced. H

4. It is a favorite proverb‘with_Pepperidge, that “ there_

should be a place for every thing, and that every thing
should be in its place. i This is hisgreat maxim; and he
not only observes it himself, but he requires every man‘,
woman, and child about him to observe it also. He says
it saves him one hundred dollars a year.’

5. He has other rules, such as “A stitch in time saves nine.”

H Thus, as soon as a stone falls off the Wall, he puts it up;

when a rail gets out of the fence, he replaces it; when a
gate is broken, it ‘is forthwith_ repaired ;, if‘ a clapboard is
loose, a nail fastens it. p -

6. Thus, matters are kept tight and tidy-. Of a wet day,
instead of going to the tavern, he spends the time in making
little repairs. At odd moments of leisure, he setsout trees
and shrubs; “thus, year by year, beautifying his place, and
rendering itnot only more comfortable, but also worth more
money, in case he should ever desire to sell it.

7‘. Captain Pepperidge takes great pleasure,’ and perha is

’ a little innocent pride, in his place, though, to say the trut ,

it is by no means costly. He loves better to spend his time
in making it more convenient and pleasant, in setting out
trees and making neat fences, 61.0., than in going about to
talk politics, or gossip upon other people’s business, or in
haunting a tavern bar-room.

8. In short, his home is comfortable, pleasant, delightful.
It is neat and orderly, inside and out. And he has made
it so ; though his wife, having happily caught the inﬂuence
of his example, contributes her share to the. good -work.

His; children are well dressed, well educated, well behaved.
9. Can such a man be a drunkard ‘la Can hebe vicious!“

Can he be wicked’? W‘ho has so good a chance of health,

LESSON v. Tire Tame Squirrel."

1. THERE are few animals that are incapable of being
tamed by kind and gentle treatment. Many of them may
be thus» rendered very amusing companions. The following
is a pleasant story of a tame squirrel. _ '

2. Mr. Mackie had procured a common squirrel, from
a_ nest found at Woodhouslee, near Edinburgh, which he
reared and rendered extremely docile. It was kept in a
box, which was nailed against the wall, at about six feet
from the ﬂoor; it was wired, in front, and had an small‘
round aperture at one end, to allow the animal to enter.

3. To the end of the box, ‘below the aperture, was sus-
pended a rope, which touched the ground, by which the.
animal descended and ascended to its domicil, ‘at pleasuw.-,.
It became extremely playful, and was familiar with every

one of the family, but devotedly attached to its master, who
generally carried it about with him in his coat pocket, that
onthe right being made on the outside for the purpose.

4. The little creature used to watch very narrowly all
its master’s movements, and, whenever he was preparing
to go out, it ran up his legs and entered his pocket, from
whence it wouldpeep out at passengers as he walked along
the streets, never venturing, however, to go out.

5. But no sooner did he reach the outskirts of the city,
than the squirrel leaped on the ground, ran along the

road, ascended to the tops of trees and hedges, with the

quickness of lightning, and nibbled at the leaves and bark;
and, if its master walked on, it would descend, scamper
after him, and again enter hisapocket. In this manner it
would amuse itself during walks of miles, which its master
frequently indulged in. i

6. Whenever it heard a carriage or cart, it became much
alarmed, and always hid itself till they had passed by. "It
was so familiar, that, even in the company of strangers,'it
would leave its master’s~pocket, and run all over them.
It would amuse itself by licking and nibbling at its master’s
hand, or that of any of his family, for hours, like a little
dog. ,  

7. This gentleman had a dog, which, although -» he had
been trained not to touch the squirrel, would, however,
never make complete friendship with it, which the little
creature made many unsuccessful attempts to accomplish.
Whenever the squirrel attempted to pass over his body,
Ponto intimated his displeasure by a growl. ’ W

8. When Ponto was asleep, Filbert (which was the squir-
rel’s name) used to take great delight in teasing him, by
making’ a rapid descent from his box, and scampering over
the dog’s body, and then quickly ascending his rope.

9. This sport he would repeat again and again, to the
great annoyance of Ponto, who, at last, would sometimes
get very angry, when the little Filbert always discontinued
his gambols, and would sit peeping through the grating of
his box. , .

W 10. Its master had taught it to catch food, nuts, and
acorns, thrown to it, with its ,fore paws, which it accom-
plished with great neatness; ‘he also instructed it to leap
over a stick, held out to it, and various other tricks.

SUNSHINE. ,2;

11. This interesting little pet met with its death, by its
master inadvertently, leaning back in a chair, while it was
in his pocket. On being squeezed, the poor squirrel gave a
shrill scream, and when he took it from hispocket, it was
lifeless, to his unspeakable grief, and that of his whole

‘ family.

LESSON VI . Sunshine.

1. I LOVE the sunshine everywhere, -
In wood, and ﬁeld, and glen ;
I love it in the busy haunts
Of town-imprisoned men.

2. I love it when it streameth in
The humble cottage door,
And casts the checkered casement shade,
Upon the oaken floor.

3. I love it where the children lie
Deep in the clovery grass,
Watching among the twining roots
The ‘gold-green beetles pass.

22

THE THIRD READER.

4. I love it on the breezy sea,
Or glancing on the oar, a
While the great waves, like molten glass,
Come leaping to the shore.

5. I love it on the mountain-tops,
Where lies the thawless snow, ,
And «half a kingdom, bathed in light,
Lies stretching out below.

6. And when it shines in forest-glades,
Hidden, and green, and cool,
Through mossy boughs and v"'eined leaves,
How is it beautiful !-

7; How beautiful on little streams,
. When sun and shade, at play,
Make silvery meshes, while the brook
Goes singing on its way..

8. How beautiful, where dragon-ﬂies
Are wondrous to behold,
With rainbow wings of gauzy pearl,
And bodies blue and gold!

9. How beautiful, on harvest slopes
To see the sunshine lie ;
Or on the paler reaped ﬁelds,
Where yellow shocks stand high!

10. Oh yes! I love the sunshine!
Like kindness or like mirth
Upon a human countenance,
Is sunshine on the earth!

.11. Upon ‘the earth; upon the sea;

And through the crystal air,
On piled-up cloud ; the gracious sun
Is glorious everywhere !

Evil Adviser ; a Dialogue.

Thomas. What ’s your hurry, Frank? stop a minute. .

Frank. I can’t stay ! Father sent me with this letter to
the railroad depot.

Thomas. Well, --the depot won't run away.

Frank. But the cars will ; there ’s a gentleman going to
New York, he promised to carry this letter, and there ’s
money in it for my brother. ' ~

Thomas. But don’t you see it ’s but ten minutes past
three, —- and the cars don’t start till four, and you have time
enough for what I ‘want of you. ‘

Frank. Well, what do you want’!

Thomas. Just stepsin here to see the Wild beasts with
me; you have never been, have you’!

Frank. No ; I ’ll go when I come back from my errand.

Thomas, No, you can’t, for then it will be time -to go
to the writing-master.

Frank. Then I ’ll go with you to-morrow. . 2

Thomas. No, you can’t, for this is the last day of the
exhibition. 2

Frank.‘ Is it’! that ’s bad 2' Irdid not know there were’

any beasts in town till to-day, How many are there’!_ .

g4 THE THIRD READER. I

Thomas. Ever so many; there ’s a polar bear, and an
elephant, and a most beautiful rhinoceros, -5-

Frank. I have seen a rhinoceros, and he is the ugliest
creature that ever was ; his skin sits as loosely upon him as
a sailor’s trousers. A .

Thomas. Well, there ’s a royal tiger -

Frank. Is there’! I never saw a royal tiger !

Thomas. Oh! he ’s a beauty,-all yellow and covered
with black stripes. Then there are little leopards playing
just like kittens; and,—there! there! do you hear that’!
that ’s the lion roaring! ,

Franh. When! that ’s a peeler! How long will it .take
to see them all’! "

Thomas. Oh! not half an hour, and it won’t take you
ﬁve minutes to run down to the depot afterwards, if you clip
it like a good fellow. ,

Frank. Are there any monkeys’!

Thomas.- Plenty of them! the funniest monkeys you.

ever saw "; ‘they makerall sorts of faces.
Frank. Well,-——- I don’t know,  what‘ if I should be
too late for the cars’!   ‘

Thomas. No danger of that, I tell you‘ ; the town clock!

up there is too fast; its all out of order; and, besides, you
might see half the beasts while you are standing here think-
ing about it, 'looking up the street and down the street.
Frank. Well! come along then! where ’s your money?
Thomas. Oh! I don’t pay ! I got acquainted with the
door-keeper after I had been in twice, and now he lets me
in for nothing every time I bring a feller that does pay.
Frank. Oh ho ! well, I suppose it ’s quarter of a dollar,
and I have one somewhere in my pockets. (Pulling "out ‘his
handkerchief to search for the money, drops the letter.)
Ah! here it is! Come, ‘Tom! no time to be lost. Mind
you do not let me stay too long.
(They go into the e’a:hz'l2z't«z'on booth. ,
Franh:’s father, I passing along, picks up the letter, exam-
ines it, looks round for Frank, and passes hastzly ‘away.
After some time, the boys come out.)
‘Thomas. You did not half see them, you were in such
a hurry and worry.    A
T Frank. I know it. Are you sure that clock is too fast,
om '! o *  

FRANK AND THOMAS. Q5

Thomas. I don’t know, —- I suppose so, — the clocks
are wrong half the time.

Frank. Why, you told me it was too fast, Tom! and now
I ’ll bet anything I shall be too late ! I wish I hadn’t gone in!

-Thomas. Well, why don’t you move, then’! What are
you rummaging after ’! ‘

Frank. Why, after my letter. I ’m sure I put it in this
pocket. What in the name of wonder has become of it’!

Thomas. Look in t’other pocket. W

Frank. It is n’t there! nor in my hat! What shall I do’!

Thomas. Why you can’t have lost it, can you’!

Frank. I have lost it; I am as sure as can be I had it
in this very pocket just before I met you,'and now it ’s gone!

Thomas. May be somebody stole it in the crowd.
. Frank. That’s comfort! There was ever so much money
in it, for I heard father talking about it at dinner time.

Thomas. Oh ! I ’ll tell you what ’s become -of it’!.-

Frank. What *? what’! . .

Thomas. Why, I guess the elephant took it out of your
pocket!  

Frank. You ought to be ashamed to stand there laugh-

ing, after you have got me into such a scrape! I have a.

great mind to go in again and look all round.
Thomas. They won’t let you in again unless you pay.
Frank. Oh Tom! what will my father say to me?
Where shall I look’! I wish I had never heard of the beasts;
there was no comfort in looking at them, for I was thinking
of the cars all the time, and now my letter is gone, and

brother Henry’s money, and all ;« and what will father do to

me’!

Thomas. What ’s the use of telling him anything about

it’! he ’ll never know whether the letter went or not, if you»

don’t saya word. ‘

Frank. Yes, he will; my brother will write to inquire"

for the money. .

Thomas. Well, and can’t you say you gave the letter to

the gentleman?

 No, Tom; I.can’t do that. I can’t‘tell a lie,

and, above all, to my father. .
Thomas. The more fool you ! You needn’t look so mad.

Father. Why, Frank, you have run yourself out of
breath; I trust that letter will go safely, for your brother
wants the money very much. '

. Thomas. Frank was just in time, Sir. The cars were
just starting. , ' "

Father. Oh! you went with him,‘ did you’!

letter in his pocket-book very carefully. I fancy it will go

LESSON VIII. Let Home be made Happy.

1. INDUSTRY is a homely virtue, yet worthy of all praise.
Experience, religion, philosophy, alike inculcate it. Even
nature herself reads us a frequent lecture upon it. Let us
go, for a moment, from the haunts of men to the bosom of
the quiet forest. _

2. Here we shall ﬁnd no noisy sound of the mill, the
hammer, or the saw. It, is silent; but look around, and see
what has been done by the busy, though still, hand of Na-
ture. See the,rock,— how artfully it is woven over with
moss, as if to hide its roughness; and how is an object, of
itself uninteresting, thus rendered beautiful !

23 THE THIRD‘ READER.

3. Look at the ragged banks of the brawling stream!
See the tufts of grass, the spreading shrubs, and gaudy wild
ﬂowers, that cover it, and thus turn into beauty the very
deformity of the wilderness !

4. Look down upon the valley, and see how the withered
leaves, the mouldering branches of trees, the scattered
stems, and other objects, witnesses of decay and death,
are carpeted over by grasses and.ﬂowersl

.5. How beautiful, how ornamental, are the works of
Nature, even in the wilderness and the solitary place!
She seems to decorate them all, as if each spot were a gar-
den, in which God might perchance walk, as once in Eden;
and she would have it ﬁtly arrayed for his inspection.

6. And shall not man learn a homely lesson from this
lecture in the woods’! Will you look at Nature, and see
her, with industrious ﬁngers, weaving ﬂowers and plants,

. and grasses,'and trees, and shrubs, to ornament every part

of the earth, and will you go home no wiser for the hint’!
"'7. Will you go home,-— to that dear spot, upon which
the heart should shine, as the sun in spring-time upon the
ﬂowers, —and permit it to be the scene of idleness, negli-
gence, and waste’!
8. Will you permit it to be a nakedshelter from the
weather, like the den of a wild beast’! Will you not rather

adorn it by your industry, as nature adorns the ﬁeld and i

the forest’! r .

9. If you say, that this issomewhat fanciful, and should
be regarded rather as illustration than argument,—-let it
be admitted. Still, are not the works of Nature designed
to,._,have an inﬂuence of this kind upon us’! Why do we
feél "their beauty, and carry their images in our bosoms, but
as a language in ‘which our Creator ,wouldispeak to us,
move us, educate us ‘I

10. If the trembling string, that is set in the wind, yields
melody to the ear, shall we not listen to it’! And if Nature
would thus become a monitor, shall we not learn of her’!
If she sets us a useful and beautiful example, shall we not
-follow it’! .

11.» If she adorns the dell, the vale, the slope, the hill, -
covering up whatever may offend, and displaying in rich
color-s and beautiful forms, her fairy designs of leaves and
ﬂowers,— shall we not imitate her?

LET HOME BE MADE HAPPY. 29

12. It seems to me no violent stretch of faith, to deem
all this as meant for practical teaching to man. Nature is
industrious in adorning her dominions; and man, to whom
this beauty is addressed, should feel and obey the lesson.

13. Let him, too, beindustrious, in adorning his domain,
—in making his home, the dwelling‘ of his wife and chil-
dren, not ‘only convenient and comfortable, but pleasant.-
Let him, as far as circumstances will permit, be industrious
in surrounding it with pleasing.objects,—in decorating it,
within and without, with things that tend to make it agree-
able and attractive. , ,,,  . y

14. Let industry; and  i’i‘?i*=home the abode ot’/neat-
ness and order,;-— apliace which, brings satisfactionto every
inmate, and which in absence draws back the heart, by the
fond associations of comfort and content; .

15. Let this be done, and this sacred ‘spot will become
more surely the scene of cheerfulness, ‘kindness, and peace.
Ye parents, who would have your children happy, be indus-
trious to bring them up in the midst of a pleasant, a cheer-
ful, a happy home. '

    

16. Waste not your time in accumulating unnecessary-

wealth for them; but plant their minds and souls, in the
way proposed, with the seeds of virtue and true prosperity.
Let children’ join with their parents in trying to make home
a happy place ! Let them not forget that they may do much
to promote this object.  They can at least practise obedi-
ence to parents, and kindness to all around.

LESSON X. Indolence a Curse.

1. Tninexcellence, of industry may be illustrated by cont-.
trasting it with indolence. There is no person more truly
unhappy, than one who is given up to indolence. Whether

rich or poor, he is a wretch who is wedded to indolence. It '

was the design of Him, who made us, that we should be ac-
tive, and he has always laid happiness in the path of effort
and exertion. 7 i a H , ll

2. He, then,‘ who travels in the ways of indolence in
search. of happiness, always misses it. He is like a lazy
fellow, whom I once knew, who sat waiting at a woodchuck’s
burrow a whole day, expecti ,,the animal to come out and
be caught; but the brute walsﬁie wiser of the two, and went
out‘ by another Way. a

3. Indolence may get to be a disease. A man, dressed
in rags, haggard, and marked with misery, once approached
a rich man, and begged for a fewnence. “ But why do you
beg ’! ” said the rich man. “ I ani afflicted with a disease,”
said the beggar, “ and shame prevents my naming it to you.”

UNDERNEATH the greenweod tree, i
There we dwell right merrily,
Lurkingin the grassy lane,

Here this hour, -A—— then gone again; ,

Youmay see where we have been,
By theburned spot on the green ; ~
By the oak’s branch’ drooping low,
Withered in our fagots" glow ;

By the grass and hedge-row cropped,
Where our asses have been grazing;
By some old torn rag we dropped,
When our crazy tents were raising;

You may see where we- have been;
Where we are, — that is not seen :
Where we are, it is no place,

For a lazy foot to trace.

Over heath and over ﬁeld,

He must scramble who would ﬁnd us;
In the copse‘-‘wood close concealed,
With a running brook behind us.

Here we list no village clocks;
Livelier sound the farm-yard cocks,
Crowing, crowing round about,

As if «to point their roostings out;

And many a cock shall cease to crow,
Ere We from the copse.-wood go.

  LESSON XII. Man is endowed with Moral Faculties.

1. 013' all thevarious sentient beings which people this
vast earth, man is the only one that has been permitted to
taste of the tree of T knowledge of good and evil. He is the
only being here, that has a moral nature; the only being, that
is capable of perceiving beauty in virtue, and deformitffin
vice; the only being, that has a capacity to distinguish be-

tween truth and falsehood, between equity and injustice, _

between right and wrong; the only being, in whose breast
Heaven has established the -holy tribunal of vcenscience.
Man, then, alone, of all the creation,«has moral faculties.

2. It will be easy to illustrate this position, and show the .
difference between man and animals, in respect to moral

perceptions‘. Let us take the golden rule, laid down‘ by our
Savior, which is the basis of justice between man and man ;
“ Do to another as you would have another do to “you.”

3. This is no sooner presented to the human mind, than
its force is perceived, and the obligation to obey it’ felt. But
animals are utterly destitute of a capacity for such percep-
tions. Might, with them, is the universal rule of right.

4. The dog snatches the bone fromthe cat by the pre-
scriptive privilege of mastery. The raven yields the car-
cass to the vulture; the vulture retires and waits till the
feast of the sea eagle is done.

i 5. The hungry jackal surrenders his prey to the wolf ;

‘the wolf gives up his to the hyena. Thus, throughout the

brute creation, there ‘is no recognition of any principle of
justice; no judge or jury but force; no other rule of right,
than that the weak must yield to the strong. V,
6. I once met‘ with a beautiful and striking example of
the perception .of equity in a child, in reference to the seem-
ing injustice on the part of the bald eagle, described by
Wilson, the ornithologist. The reader is probably familiar
with the famous passage, in which that ‘author depicts the

35 THE THIRD READER.

king of birds, as robbing the ﬁsh-hawk of the prey he has

snatched from the bosom of the lake.

7. The child, a boy of about seven years old, read the
passage with great interest, and at ﬁrst seemed only ﬁlled
with the vivid picture presented to his imagination; but af-
ter a little while he asked, with a countenance that bespoke
a painful emotion, “ Was it not wicked for the eagle to get
away the ﬁsh that the hawk had taken out of the water '2 ”

. 8. It is admitted that man’s moral nature is the most exalted

portion of his being. Virtue is superior to knowledge ; the
good man is ranked as superior to the great man. “ An hon-
est man ’s the noblest work of God.” ‘The Scriptures ever
give the ﬁrst place to the righteous man, the man of high
nroralpharacter ; 2 not to the man of genius or talent.
 the high gift of moral faculties is not bestowed
without eoynditiones. If a man use them wisely, they will
insure happiness; if otherwise, they will work out his ruin.
With the power to‘ perceive the beauty of virtue and the
deformity of vice, he -must follow the one if he would be
happy, and shun the other at his peril. This is the weighty
condition, and it cannot be resisted or evaded. 2

10. This law is coiled around the soul of man, and while
that soul endures, it cannot be shaken off. It is the law of
the moral "universe, and is as pervading and ‘inﬂexible as the
principle of gravitation, which draws back to the earth a
stone hurled into the air, while, at the same time, it reaches
to the planets, and sustains the balance of the heavens.

11. It is a law ordained by Omnipotence and administered
by Omniscience: “ Mankind must be virtuous if they would
be happy; ” and the great rule of virtue is, “ Love the Lord
with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyself.” .

Because they do not understand it, and force is the law of their nature.
Why is man bound to obey the golden rule, or the moral law’! Be-
cause it is imposed by God, it is a good law, and man sees and feels
that it is a good law. Was the eagle wrong in snatching the ﬁsh from the ﬁsh-
hawk '2 Ans. No, because he did not know the golden rule. Would it be

LESSON XIV. Knowledge and Virtue.

1. KNOWLEDGE and learning are excellent things, but
they are not enough without virtue. I would say, there-
fore, Get knowledge, get understanding, but, with all your
getting, get virtue. Be good; be true; be honest. The
importance of uniting virtue with knowledge, ‘I shall en-
deavor to illustrate by the following fable.

2. In a country of the East, a” great while ago, when the
world was young, there lived a little child. As he lay, one
sultry day, in the shade of a wide-branching" tree, he wished
that some angel would come to him, and grant him his
request. 

3. On a sudden, he was alarmed to ﬁnd that his wish had
been complied with, and was awe-struck at the presence of
a celestial visitant. It was too late now to recall his wish,
as his " timidity would have dictated, and the benignant
countenance of the angel put courage in his heart, and set
him very soon at his ease.

4. “ You called me,” said the angel. “ Why have you
called me’! And what is your request’! ” “ In long for knowl-
edge,” said the child; “ can you procure it for me?” “ Your
desire is reasonable,” replied the angel, “ and the object is

KNOWLEDGE AND VIRTUE. .39

attainable. But before your request is granted, it is im-
portant you should be prepared for the reception of the gift.”

5. So saying, the angel took the child by the hand, and
led him into the midst of a great plain, where a vast con-
course of persons, of all ages and of both sexes, were
present, dispersed about and employed in various ways.

6. The angel placed‘ his young charge in a commanding
position, and then began to point out to him the principal
objects before him. In the middle of the plain stood two

trees, one of them the tree of Knowledge, and the other. the

tree of ‘ Virtue.
7. “ You observe,” said the angel, “ there is a great eager-

ness to get at the fruit of the tree of Knowledge. Look,

what a crowd there is about it! Some, you perceive, have

‘climbed upon the branches to pluck the fruit, and there, is

one who has ventured upon the slenderest and highest
boughs, out of a passion for the fairest and ripest fruit. _

8. .“ One striking effect, produced by eating this fruit, is
that it sharpens the appetite for more. ' But, in order to
understand the various effects of this fruit upon those who

‘ partake of it, you must observe more particularly these sev-‘

eral groups scattered about on the plain.”

9. _“ And who is that ﬁgure strutting along so gayly?”
asked the child’! “ That is Vanity,” replied the angel. “ He
has eaten of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge, and he imag—
ines himself the greatest, nay, the only being in the uni-
verse. ‘ Who is of so much consequence as I '2 ’ he seems to
ask in every feature and every movement.’

10. “ Butilethim pass, for his is not by any means the worst
case before you. Knowledge puﬁeth up, --but that is not
the worst it does. Look now at that evil-eyed person, who
walks along with such a ﬁerce expression of liatred in his
countenance. That is Envy. He was so afraid that his
companions would gather more than himself, that he would
not eat of the fruit of the tree of Virtue, and now he is
miserable.” ' - V

11. “ But who is that,” asked the child, “ so busy among

the crowd yonder, and who seems to be taking pleasure in.

setting them at variance?” “ That is Mischief,” said the
angel. “ He has eaten his ﬁll of the fruit of the tree of
Knowledge, and it seems to have intoxicated his brain. ‘

12. “He understands the natures of those he converses

with, and he delights in unsettlingtheir minds. He is ever
bringing forward new and startling notions about government
and religion. Wherever he goes, it is a signal for confusion
and quarrelling. K

13. “ Turn now your eyes to another quarter of the plain,
and look at- that conspicuous ﬁgure‘, who is busy aiming
deadly machines at the crowd which oppose him. That is
Ambition. ~ - ~ _

' 14. “ He has eaten of thetfruit of the tree of Knowledge,
and it has sharpened his invention; he knows the secrets of
nature; he has penetrated the mysteries of the earth, and
sea, and air; and he is using his knowledge and power to
destroy his fellows, and to erect. a throne for himself. But

. there would be no end if I attempted topoint out all to you.

15. ‘‘ Looknow to a different class of persons. On this
side of us are those, who, after gathering from the tree of
Knowledge, took care to supply themselves with the fruit of
the tree of Virtue. Mark how different their aspect from
those of the groups we have been observing. Their faces

beam with a benevolent expression. They are busy in apply- ,

ing their knowledge to useful purposes. ' i
16. f‘ See, some are employed in inventing instruments
which may serve the useful purposes of life... Others are fram-

ing laws, collecting men into societies, and teaching them to

live together peaceably, and strengthen and aid each other. T
Some are discoursing to their fellow beings on the laws of

the Creator, and pointing out to them their obligations, and
Warning them of their imminent dangers.”

17. “I have seen enough,” said the child, to his angel
guide. “ Let me taste of the fruit of the tree of Knowledge,
but let me also partake of the fruit of the tree of Virtue.”
And the angel left him with the promise that his request

should be granted. My young friends, let your prayer be of

a similar kind; "‘ Give me Knowledge, but give me Virtue to
guide it.”

Spell and deﬁne : knowledge, virtue, understanding, importance, awe-
struck, benignant, reception, dispersed, slenderest, strutting, variance, con-
spicuous, mischief, penetrated, benevolent, peaceably, immment, similar.

THE EARLY BLUE BIRD. 41

Questions on the Lesson. What is the distinction between knowledge and
virtue’! Ans. Knowledge consists in stores of facts, such as are contained
in books of history, geography, &c. Virtue consists in the love and prac-
tice of piety, truth, justice, charity, &c. May a person possess much
knowledge and little virtue ’! What do you learn from this lesson‘? Is not
virtue better than knowledge '2 Should not all strive to gain knowledge and
at the same time to be virtuous ’! '

Questions on the Rules. Why should you read naturally '2 Rule 5.
should your voice be neither too low nor too loud '3, Rule 6.

LESSON _Xv. ’ The Early Blue Bird.

1. BLUE BIRD, on yon leaﬂess tree, '
Dost thou carol thus to me,
“Spring is coming; spring is here l ”
Say’st thou so, my birdie dear’!
What is that, in misty shroud,
Stealing from the darkened cloud’!
Snow, my friend; it gathers round,
Settling o’er the whitened ground,
Yet thou singest’, blithe and clear,
“ Spring is coming ; spring is here.”

2. Strik’st thou not too bold a strain’!
Winds are piping o’er the plain,
Clouds are sweeping o’er, the sky
With a black and threatening eye;
Urchins, by the frozen rill,

Wrap their mantles closer still ;
Yon poor man, with doublet old,
Is he shivering at the cold’!
Hath he not a nose of blue’!
Tell me, birdling, tell me true.

3. Spring ’s a maid of mirth and glee,
Rose-bud wreaths and revelry ;—-
Hast thou wooed some Winged love
To a nest in verdant grove ’!

Sung to her of greenwood bower,
Sunny skies that never lower,
44:

42 THE THIRD READER.

Lured her_ with thy promise fair,
Of a lot that knows no care’!
Prythee, bird ,-in coat of blue,
Though a lover, tell her true.

4. Ask her, if, when storms are long,
She can sing a cheerful song;
When the tempest rocksthe tree,

If she ’ll closer cling to thee;

Then the blasts, that sweep, the sky,
Unappalled shall pass thee by ;
Though thy little chamber show
Siftings of untimely snow, .
Warm and glad thy heart shall be,
Love shall make it spring for thee.

Spell and deﬁne : leaﬂess, darkened, blithe, strain, urchins, doublet, rev-
elry, prythee, unappalled, untimely, blasts, birdie, birdling.

Note. The last words, birdie and birdling are not to be found in the
dictionary, but are used in poetry; it is deemed allowable to take liberties in
poetry, which would be improper in prose. These words are introduced in the
preceding verses, fbr the sake of aiding the tender sentiment of the piece.
Birdie means a bird that is loved; birdling, a little bird.

Faults of pronunciation. Ur-chun for ur-chin, chur-ful for cheer-ful,
chain-ber for chaim-ber. _

Questions on the Lesson. The blue bird is one of . the first of the feathered
tribe that goes to the north, at ‘the return of spring. It often comes so soon,
as to be caught in the lingering snows of winter. The general meaning to

v be gathered from these verses is this, that if a person has obtained a true

friend by means of fair and honest professions, the friendship will be lasting,
and prove a source of’ happiness. Is not this idea beautifully illustrated by
the poetry '2 '

LESSON XVI. _ The Irish and St. Patrick.

1. THE early Irish, like the other Celtic tribes, were de-

voted to the religion of the Druids; but, about the year 450,

a Christian missionary came into the country, whose name

.-was Patrick.

THE IRISH AND ST. PATRICK. 43

2. He was certainly a very wise and good man; and,
under the inﬂuence of his eloquent preaching and holy ex-
ample, ‘the nation was speed-ily converted from the darkest
paganism to Christianity. Patrick lived to a great age, but
at length he died, and was buried at Doune.

3. When he was gone, the people very properly” cherished a

his memory; but, in process of time, they began to tell
pretty large stories of him, and ﬁnally, considering him

more holy than other men, they called him a saint. To

this day, many of the Irish regard St. Patrick as in heaven,
watching over the interests of Ireland.

4. Among the curious notions still entertained by the
Irish with regard to their favorite saint, is this. In Ireland,
there are no serpents or venomous reptiles, and the people

ﬁrmly believe that St. Patrick put an end to them, and

freed the island from them for ever.
. 5. At the lake of W Killarney, the peasants are said still to

preserve the following amusing tradition. When the labors

of St. Patrick were drawing to a close, there was one enor-
mous serpent, who sturdily refused to emigrate, and baﬂled

. the attempts of the good saint for a long time.

6,. He haunted the romantic shores of Killarney, and was
so well pleased with his place of residence, that he never
contemplated the prospect of removing, without a deep sigh.

7. At length St. Patrick, having procured a large oaken
chest, with nine strong bolts to secure its lid, took it on his
shoulder, one ﬁne sunshiny morning,,and trudged over to
Killarney, where he found the serpent basking in the sun.

8. ‘‘ Good morrow to ye!” cried the saint. “Bad luck
to ye! ” replied the serpent. “ Not so, my friend,” replied
the good saint. “ You speak unwisely; I am your friend.
To prove which, have not I brought you over this beautiful
house as a shelter to you’! J So be aisy, my darling.” '

9. But the serpent, being a cunning reptile, understood
what blarney meant, as wellas the saint himself. Still, not
wishing to affront his’ apparently friendly visiter, he said, by
way of excuse, that the chest was not large enough for him.

110. St. Patrick assured .him that it would accommodate
him very well. “ Just get into it, my darlint, and- see how
aisy you ’ll be.” The serpent thought to cheat the saint, so
he whipped into the chest, but left an inch or two of his tail
hanging out over the edge. 4

44 THE THIRD READER.

11. “ I told you so,” said be; “there ’s not room for the

whole of me!” “Take care of your tail, my darling!"

cried the saint, as he whacked the lid down upon the ser-
pent. In an instant, the tail disappeared, and St. Patrick
proceeded to fasten all the bolts.

12. He then took the chest on his shoulders. “ Let me
out ! ” cried the serpent. “ Aisy !” cried the saint ; “ I ’ll let
you out to-morrow.” So saying, he threw the box far into
the waters of the lake, to the bottom of which it sank, to rise
no more. .

13. But ever since, the ﬁsherm.en_h,ave aﬂirmed, that they
often hear the voice of the pdorrtéheated reptile, eagerly
inquiring, “ Is to-morrow come yet? Is to-morrow come
yet ’! ”

Spell and deﬁne : Celtic, missionary, eloquent, paganism, favorite, Killar-
ney, tradition, emigrate, romantic, trudged, basking, accommodate, whacked,

LESSON XVII. The Bee.

1. OF this insect there are several kinds, but the most
interesting species is the Honey Bee. Small and insigniﬁ-
cant as this little creature may appear to be, it is one of
the most wonderful animals in the world.

2. Many bees live in a wild state, and make their hives in
hollow trees. In America and other countries,there are
persons who devote themselves to ﬁnding these hives, for the
"sake of the honey.

THE BEE. T 45

3. One of the most common. methods adopted is to place
some bee-bread, in order to tempt the bees, on a ﬂat board
or tile, and draw a circle round it with white paint. The
bee always settles upon the edge of anything ﬂat, so she
must travel through -the paint to reach the bee-bread.
When she ﬂies away, the white paint on her body enables
the observer to trace her ﬂight, and her course is marke
down with a pocket compass. . —

from the ﬁrst; and, by comparing the direction of the two
lines, the situation of the nest is easily found, as it must be
at the point, where, if continued, the lines would meet. In
Africa, the bee-hunter is, aided by a little bird called the
Honey Guide. ’ .

5. In the same country the Honey Rate], a small quad-
ruped, will sit and hold one of his paws before his eyes,
to shield them from‘ the glare about the time of sunset, in
order to ‘geta distinct View of the objects of his pursuit;
and when he sees any bees ﬂying, he knowsthat at that hour
they are returning home, and so he follows them.

6. The domestic bees afford a good opportunity for study-
ing the habits"“of this wonderful race of insects. Three

kinds of bees are discovered in the hive; the drone, the“

queen-bee, and the working-bee. The drones are the fathers
of the young bees, and live an idle life; they are larger
than the rest, andrrmake a louder hum in ﬂying. The queen
is the mother of the young bees, and governs the hive.
Her subjects are much attached to her. , - A ’

'7. If she dies, the whole community is thrown into the
greatest agitation; and those that ﬁrst ﬁnd out What is the
matter, run about the hive in a furious manner, touching
every companion they meet with their little horns or feel-
ers, which are called antennae. These in their turn run
about in the same manner, and informothers of the sad
event, till the whole hive is in confusion.

8. This agitation lasts four or ﬁve hours, after which the

bees begin to take measures for repairing their loss. N oth-'

ing can be more extraordinary, than the way in which they
proceed. They build several cells, which are much larger
than the common ones, and of a different form. ,

a few days it grows larger, and at length com-es out a
queen. One of these becomes the sovereign of the hive.

10. If the bees lose their queen, and there areyno worms
or young to supply herplace, they leave off’ working, and die
in a few days. But if, in the midst of their agitation, their
lost queen should be restored, they are quiet immediately,
for they instantly remember and distinguish her from all
others. ' . '

.11. If a new queen were to be placed in the hive too
soon after the loss of the \ other, no attention would be paid
her, and she would be starved, or smothered in the crowd.
But when four and twenty hours have passed, and the ﬁrst
grief is over, a stranger queen is well received and reigns
immediately. The bees crowd about her, touch her by
turns with their wantennae, give her honey, orange themselves
round her in a circle, and follow her as a guard when she

_ moves.

12. The oﬂspring of one queen alone is too numerous for

a hive to hold. She will sometimes lay in one season sixty‘

or seventy thousand eggs; so it would never do to have
more than one queen. Some of the eggs turn to queens,
some to drones, and the largest portion to workers. The
swarms that leave the hive are each led by aqueen. ‘ i

13. The drones do not collect honey, or help to build the

cells. People, who like‘ them lead an idlelife, are some-
times called drones. The drones are turned out of the hive
before winter, that they may not eat the honey that the
industrious workers. have collected. ’ T

14. A swarm of bees, on entering anew hive, imme-
diately Want cells to store their honey in, and to bring up
their young. These cells cannot be made without wax,
which is obtained, not from ﬂowers, as is supposed, but from
the bodies of the bees. This forms best while they are quiet,
and, in order to obtain it, they hang themselves in clusters,
clinging to each others’ legs. ‘

15. Having remained in this situation for twenty-four
hours, they scrape it oﬂ‘, and form it into cells, the tongue
being used as a sort of. trowel. Their industry, skill, and
contrivance in doing this are admirable.

 16. Bees have many enemies beside man, the honey
guide, and honey ratel. Wasps and hornets attack them
while in search of ﬂowers, and moths steal into the hive,

_where they sometimes do great mischief. At night, senti-

nels are set to Watch, and by moonlight you may see them
pacing to and fro, turning in every direction.

. 17. If an enemy approach, the sentinels utter a loud
hum, and other bees rush to their aid. If the moth gets in,
and escapes being stung to death, it lays its eggs, which
produce grubs, that sometimes oblige the bees to quit the
hive. _ The Death’s-head moth, which is very large, some-
times gets in and produces a sound, which renders the bees
motionless, and then it steals their honey.

PREFACE.

The leading design of reading books for schools is to supply helps
for the acquisition of the mechanical art of reading. Works of this
kind should, therefore, be progressive; beginning with simple lessons,
adapted to the capacity of the pupil, and gradually advancing, so as to
carry him along with an easy but increasing effort in ascending to the
higher kinds of composition. These works should also have va-
riety, as prose and poetry, gravel and gay pieces, description, narrative,
&c. They should introduce the writings of different authors, so as to
afford specimens of various styles. ~

All this is so obvious as to have escaped the notice of very few edi-
tors of reading-books; but they have, perhaps, too frequently conﬁned
their views to these objects, and have, therefore, either wholly or par-
tially overlooked otheriimportant considerations. The ﬁrst and greatest
practical evil of this error is, that the external organs seem only to be
taught, or attempted to be taught, while the mind is hardly brought into
the work. One consequence is, that reading becomes a mere act of
running over the sound of letters and syllables, without a correspond-
ing effort of the mind to grasp the ideas which the words convey.
There is a natural tendency in children to this, for the mechanical
effort of readin is great to a child, and it is apt to absorb all his fac-
ulties ; he will, 1; ierefore, be likely to read only with his lips and not with
his understanding ; but, if the books put into his ‘hand, and in which he
is accustomed to read, aid in this result, some of the worst and most
obstinate bad habits of a child are sure to be established. He gets
the idea, that books are only filled with sounds, and that reading is but
the rattling off of words. Accordingly in reading aloud he evidently
attends not to the sense, and you will often see him, even when sitting
by himself, and pretending to study a lesson, compelled to whisper out
the words ; for to-him reading is sound, and without sound it is nothing.

The importance of intercepting this bad habit of a divorce between
the .lips and the mind, by careful training, in every process of education,
cannot be overrated ; for children slide into this, as well as many other
bad habits, with aprone and slippery heel; and habit in children is like
a fox, that has taken to his den in the cliff 3 it is hard, very hard, to be
driven out. _ _

Impressed with these views, I have attempted in the series of books,
of which thisis the Third, to insure the constant presence and attention
of the young reader’s mind and heart, in the progress of the lessons.
The First volume consists of easy lessons, embracing few words beyond
the vocabulary of mere childhood, and using no idioms, or forms of
speech, which may require an impossible effort for its limited compre-
hension. The subjects too are such as are deemed likely to interest
the feelings of children, and stimulate or develope associations of
ideas already in their minds. ,

The Second volume carries the pupil still further onward, and the‘pres-
ent volume brings him to a wider and more varied ﬁeld of literature. Nor
is the careful progressive adaptation of style and thought to the pupi'l’s
capacity and condition, the only means that has been attempted to be
used, in making the mental and bodily machiner come into habitual
cooperation, in the act of reading. The designo the author of them

books, is, that they should be studied, and that the pupil shouldi;be-

made to regard them as containing ideas, whichqhe is to appropriate to
himself; as if, to use a familiar illustration, each lesson were ainut he i
to crack, and fromwhich he is to pick out and eat the meat. With

~ Father. Botany is the knowledge of plants; and these
were the ﬁrst things man became acquainted with. “ '
Anna. - Oh, dear papa, tell me how. r _
Father. Man, you know, was created out of the dust of
the earth; and, when he rose from the ground, he saw him-
self" everywhere surrounded with plants. The rearing of
them became his ﬁrst care,’ their fruit his ﬁrst food, and
marking their kinds hisﬁrst knowledge. ‘ Botany, therefore,
must have been as old as man’s creation; for at that time,
the Bible tells us,«that “ God planted agarden in Eden for
Adam, that he might dress it and till it.” I
' Anna. ‘That is‘ very true, indeed; but did any one else
in the Bible ever learn botany’!  n
, Father. Yes, not only the . ﬁrst man, but the wisest man
in the world turned his mind to it. A
Anna. Do you mean Solomon’!
Father. I do. V
Anna. , Did Solomon study botany? .
‘ Father; So the Bible tells us. He considered the sub-
ject with great attention, learned the names and uses of
‘every plant, and discoursed of trees from the largest to the
smallest, from “the cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop that
groweth out of the wall.” Even our Savior himself conde-
scended to"‘notice plants, and pointed them out to his disci-
ples, to instruct them in the wisdom, power, and providence
‘of God. “Behold,” said he, “ the lilies of the ﬁeld, how they
grow; they toil not, neither do theyspin; yet I say unto
you, that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one
of these.” 7 , p ; 1 I »
".Anna.' Oh a’ lily, indeed, is a beautiful ﬂower,'and if
there were ‘such ‘growing in’four ﬁelds, I am sure I should
not complain of . them. ‘But this ugly nettle l I do- not know
what beauty, use, or_ instruction, there can be in that.’
 '-Father. And yet, Nanny, there is more beauty, use, and
instruction in a nettle than even in a lily.
Anna. Oh, papa, How can you make thatout’!
' Father. Put on your gloves,”pluck up that nettle, and let
us examine it. First look at the ﬂower. ‘ ' » ‘
Anna. The ‘ﬂower, papa! ' I’ see no ﬂower, unless

giyou call that cluster‘ of littleiragged knobs ﬂowers, which-

z

A have neither color nor smell, and are not much larger than

the heads of pins.

THE NETTLE. 49

Father. Here take this magnifying glass and examine
them. .
Anna. Oh, I see now ;-every little knob is folded up
in leaves like a rosebud. May be there is a ﬂower inside.
Father. Try ; take this pin and touch the knob. Well,
what do you see’!
Anna. Oh, how curious.
Father. What is curious?

Anna. ‘ The moment I touched it, it flew open; a little

cloud rose out of it like enchantment, and four beautiful lit-
tle stems sprung up as if they were alive; and now that I
look again with the glass, I see an elegant little ﬂower, as
nice and perfect as a lily itself.

Father. Well, now examine the leaves.

. Anna. Oh, I see they are all covered over with little
bristles; and when I examine them with a glass, I see a lit-
tle bag ﬁlled with a juice like water, at the bottom of each.
Ha! these are the things which stung me. '

Father. Now touch the little bag with the point of the

pin. ,
Anna. Oh, when I press the bag, the juice runs up and

comes out at the small point at the top; so I suppose the

little thorn must be hollow inside, though it is ﬁner than the
point of my cambric needle.

"Father. Have all the leaves those stings ‘Z

Anna. No, papa ; some of the young ones are quite
green and soft, like velvet, and I may handle them without
any danger. -

Father. N ow look at the stem, and break it.

Anna. Oh! I can easily crack it, but I cannot break it
asunder; for the back is so strong, that it holds it together.

Father. Well, now you seevthere are more curious things-

in a. nettle than you expected. a

Anna. Oh, indeed, I see that. But you have often told
me that God makes nothing in vain or without its use ; and I
am sure I cannot see any use in all these things.

Father. That we will now consider; You saw the little
ﬂower,‘ burst open, a cloud rose, you say, like enchant-
ment, and stems sprang up as if they were alive. Now
all this is necessary for the nature of the plant. There are
many thousand plants in the world ; and it has pleased God.
in his wisdom to make them all different. Some have parts

5 .

50 THE THIRD READER.

that others want, and some have different ﬂowers on different
stems. Look at that nettle on the opposite side of the road ;
you see, that it is not exactly the “same as the one you ex-
amined. . T

Anna. No, papa; this has little ﬂat seeds instead of
ﬂowers. '

Father. Very right, my dear. Now, in order to make
these seeds grow, it is necessary that the little ﬂower of this
plant and the seed of that should be together, as they are in

others. But this, you see, is impossible; for they cannot"

move about like animals, but are ﬁxed to one spot. The
wisdom of God, therefore, has provided a remedy for this:
for, when you touched the ﬂower, the outside leaves imme-
diately burst open; and if you had not done so, they would in
time have burst ‘open of themselves: then they threw out a lit-
tle ﬁne powder, which you saw like a cloud ; this was con-
veyed by the air to the other plant at the opposite side of the
road; and then when it touched the seed, it gave it power
to grow, and produce a new plant when the other withers
and dies away.‘ , .. .

Anna. That ’s very curious, indeed; and I see- the use
of the little cloud and the ﬂower; but the leaf that stung
me, — what use can that be of’! There, dear papa, I am
afraid I puzzle you to tell me that. . ’

Faﬂrer. God has given to all his creatures some kind of
defence, that they may protect themselves ; and for this pur-
pose the bull has horns, and the nettle stings. But even
these stings aremade of use to man. There are certain
diseases which require sharp remedies. You had occasion
to know this; for once you were in pain, andthe doctor
thought it necessary to put a blister on the part, and yougot
relief. Well, the poor people in some countries, cannot
always get a blister, so they frequently use nettles.

Those leaves which do not sting, some persons use for

, food, and from the stalk others get a stringy bark, which

answers the purpose of ﬂax. Thus you see, that even the
despised nettle is not made in vain; and this may teach
you, that we only need. to understand the works of God, to
see that “ in goodness and Wisdom he has made them all.”

LESSON XIX. The Ant.

1. THERE are several different kinds of ants; some red,
some black, some with wings, and some Without. ,They all
possess a greater share of strength than any other insect of
the same size. They are constantly laboring, and they

- often carry loads ten times their own Weight. They are

chieﬂy carnivorous insects, preying on the ﬂeshy parts of
animals, which they consume with wonderful rapidity.

2. Ants of all kinds live in families. They are .very
fond of their young, ‘and nurse them with great care.
When an ant-hill is disturbed, you may observe how anxious
all the inhabitants are about a number of white substances,
how they seize them in their mouths, to carry them to a
place of safety. These are their young ones.

3.’ The patience, perseverance, and courage of ants are
surprising, and they are proverbial for their industry. Let
us not refuse to be taught by these little insects. In the
Bible, ants arespoken of as affording a most useful lesson.
“ Go to the ant, thou sluggard,” says Solomon ; “ consider
her Ways and be wise.” .

4. The sight of one of these little creatures is said to
have had a great effect upon the mind of a celebrated con-
queror, named Timour. He vvas forced to take refuge from
his enemies in a ruined building; as he sat alone there

many hours, and was almostin despair, his attention was

attracted by an ant, carrying something larger than itself
up a high wall. a

5. He counted the efforts it made to effect its object,iand .

found that sixty-nine times its burden fell to the ground, but
the seventieth time it reached the top. “ This sight,” said
Timour, “ gave me courage at the moment, and I have
never forgotten the lesson it conveyed.”

6. Let my readers gain the same improvement ‘from it,

52 THE THIRD READER.

and, when they have anything to do which is difiicult or
troublesome, let them go on patiently trying, and generally,

like the little ant, they will succeed at last.

'7. There is one most extraordinary circumstance respect-
ing some ants, which I must now tell you. You will smile
at the idea of their having cows; yet it is quite true, that
they keep certain insects, from which they draw a sweet
liquid, much in the same manner as we obtain milk from
cows; and they even make aproperty of them.

8. If any stranger ants attempt to climb the branch of a
tree, or the stalk of a plant, where they keep their herds,
those who consider themselves the rightful owners, drive
them away, and may be seen running about in a great bus-
tle. Sometimes they build a little wall round the place
where these cattle are, and so keep them safe in a kind 0
pen. V

9. Some kinds, choosing to have them still more within
reach, carry large herds of these insect cows to their nest,
and let them feed on the grass and stalks round» which it is
built. ‘They take as much care of ‘these creatures’, eggs as
of their own; put them in a place of safety when the nest
is attacked, and carry them in the same manner into the
sun; that, by their being hatched early, there may be a good
supply of their nourishing food. ,

10. Ants are remarkable for courage. Though so small,
they never fear to face any danger, but immediately turn
round and prepare to bite, and to shoot their poison into the
wound. They sometimes ﬁx themselves so obstinately to
the object of their attack, that they will sooner be torn limb
from limb than let go their hold ; a.nd man himself strikes
no terror into them. _ '

,11. These tiny nations, so well armed and courageous,
are not always at peace with their neighbors. A square
foot of earth is to them a kingdom; their droves of insect
cattle are as valuable to them as our ﬂocks and herds are to
us; and the body of a ﬂy, or a beetle, is a most valuable
possession. _

12. No wonder, then‘, if wars and quarrels arise. Myriads
may sometimes be seen pouring forth from two rival cities,
and, meeting half-way between their respective habita-

‘tions, equalling in numbers the armies of two mighty em-

pires. Though they do not cover —a space larger than two

SHORT SENTENCES ON MANNERS. 53

or three square feet, yet they present a spectacle exactly
like that of a ﬁeld of battle,_ where men are the combatants.

13. Thousands are to be seen struggling together, shoot-
ing poison at one another, which ﬁlls the air with a strong
odor, and is as destructive to them as gunpowder is to us.
Thousands of the dead and mangled strew the ground,
while others are led away as prisoners; and crowds are
seen hastening to reinforce the contending armies.
l .14. How the ants know those of their own party it is
impossible to say, as they are generally of the same kind,
and appear to us to be all alike in make, color, and scent.
They are not distinguished, as human soldiers are, by dif-
ferent-colored uniforms, yet ‘it very rarely happens that two
of one side attack each other; and if, by chance, they do,
the mistake is presently found out, and they become friends
directly.

15. When night comes on, each party returns to its own

' city, but the next morning the battle is resumed with fresh

fury, until at length, a rainy season separates them, and the
quarrel is forgotten.

LEssoN, XXI. Wonderful Instinct of Animals.

1. LET us consider the mental powers of man, as com-
pared with the higher animal instincts. We begin by
remarking, that while man has everything to le.arn, the ani-
mal tribes need no instruction. ' » e

2. The duck, that is hatched in the barn-yard by the hen,

‘and associates only with companions that shun the water,

marches off to the pool, and, in spite ‘of warning and re-
monstrance from its guardian, plunges into the wave.
3. Here it rides at ease, and manifests a perfect knowl-

edge of the element, which it has never seen before. ‘It

puts forth its paddles, and manages them with all the dexter-
ityof an experienced oarsman.

’ 4. The waterfowl that comes into existence on the r’eedy
margin of some northern lake, stays for a time around its
birth-place; but: the brief summer is soon passed, and the
monitory voice of winter comes upon the breeze. Thebird
listens to the warning, and, springing high in air, departs for
another clime. ‘ '

5. It needs no chart, it asks no compass. It mistakes not
its course, it deviates not from its track.

“ There is aepower, whose care ,
Teaches its ’way.along thatpathless coast,
The desert and illimitable air,
Lone wandering, but not lost.”

'6. How different is it _with man ! How slow is .the process
by which he acquires a knowledge of objects around him!
He can only judge of distances after being taught by expe-

rience. " He has no knowledge of places except so far as he '

acquires it.

56 THE THIRD READER.

'7. Every inch of his progress depends upon instruction;
every idea is to be acquired; all knowledge comes by tui-
tion. The various powers of the mind, like those of the
body, must be unfolded, trained, and enlarged by education.

8. How long and patient, then, must be the study and toil
of man, before he can acquire that stretch of geographical
knowledge, which would seem to be the free gift of Heaven
to the migratory bird !

.9. That feathered voyager untaught, and often alone, per-
formsa journey of a thousand or two thousand miles ; and
that in the space of a single week. It goes to a country
where it has never been before ; it pursues a track which is
totally new.

10. It ﬂies from a winter which it has never tried, and, as
if led by the gift of prophecy, proceeds with the speed and
directness of an arrow, to ﬁnd shelter in a region of per-

V petual summer.

11. In human society, it is found alike convenient and
necessary, that men should be distributed into Various occu-
pations. Some must be farmers, some carpenters, some
hunters, and some ﬁshermen. Amongst animals, we observe
a similar diversity,of pursuits. T

12. But it is to be remarked, that, while the latter are
instructed by nature in their various trades, and supplied by
nature with the tools necessary to carryithem" on, mankind
are obliged to serve a toilsome apprenticeship of many
years, in order to acquire a competent knowledge of the
several arts and professions to which they devote themselves.

13. Thus we observe that the Woodpecker, who is a nat-
ural carpenter, supplied with a tool, that serves both as
chisel and mallet, goes untaught to the ‘forest, selects his
piece of timber, and forms his abode; and all this without
instruction. The beaver,'who is both carpenter and mason,
architect and house-builder, furnished with teeth that per-

is out in the briny mud, is an oyster-catcher by profession.
And all these, as soon as they are hatched and have taken
to their Wings, go straight to their several vocations, without
a single lesson, and yet with a perfect understanding of
them. How different is the lot of man! How many are
the trials, how long the practice, before he can become
instructed in even the commonest pursuits by which a mere
livelihood is to be obtained !

15. But let us not imagine, that, though education is more
slow in, its operation, it is inferior in its results to instinct.
Let us compare the rude village of the beaver, consisting of
sticks, stones, and grass, and which is doubtless one of the
most wonderful works of animal instinct, with a human city,
the production of instructed human reason, and how ut-

LESSON XXII. Honor and Grace.

1. IN my view, good manners must rest upon three prin-
ciples, honor, grace, and politeness ; and whatever is incom-
patible with these, or either of these, must be inconsistent
with good breeding.

2. Honor is a feeling of self-respect, which leads a person
to shun every species of meanness. It is, therefore, incom-
patible with trick, artiﬁce, and cunning, by which some
advantage is to be gained over another. It interdicts lying,
deception, and equivocation of all kinds.

W PREFACE

this view,questions are annexed to the lessons, and teachers are re-

commended to add others, calculated to make the pupils think of, and-

reﬂect upon, what they have read.

In thus attempting to stamp the idea on the pupil’s mind, that books
are vehicles of thought,—-—mines to be wrought,lfrom which we are
to extract knowledge more precious than diamonds; and in attempt-
ing to establish the habit of reading with the full cooperation of the
mind, the author has also endeavored to convey useful knowledge, or
impart virtuous sentiments, or cultivate the taste, by means of the les-
sons themselves. He has likewise endeavored to make them supply, in
some degree, the deﬁciency of our schools, in relation to several im-
portant studies. Morals and manners, particularly in their more familiar
application to our daily duties, and daily intercourse with mankind,
are little taught in our seminaries. The present volume - is, therefore,
more especially devoted to these topics, though there is perhaps as
great variety as in any other book of the kind. It will be perceived,
that,even in the disquisitions upon morals, manners, economy, and reli-
gion, there is variety, often including dialogue, description or narra-
tion, together with sketches and anecdotes introduced, for the purpose
of illustration, and to excite the interest of the reader.

The importance of Moral Culture, as a part of school education, is
beginning to be felt. Virtue is now considered as_a profession, inwhich
we should all be established and perfected, by early apprenticeship ; so
that, at mature years, we may become expert 'ourneymen, and at last
successful master-workmen. If this volume sliould go into the hands
of teachers, I could wish, that they might especially use it as an
instrument of moral instruction. And as a part of lesser morals,l

’ could hope, that the chapters on manners might meet with favor, and

might be enforced upon the attention of the pupil. At page 166 is a
lesson, containing the “ Rules ofBehavior,” found among the papers of
Washington, and which his biographer, Mr. Sparks, says, had no doubt
great inﬂuence in shaping his character and fortunes. If this be true,
if these few rules were efﬁcient in moulding such a man as,.Washington,
how evident is the importance of subjecting every childtoithe action of
such or similar potent, yet salutary, inﬂuences?

It Will be observed, that the pieces in the volume are not mere frag-
ments, but each article is complete in itself, and needs no addition
to be understood. In order to accomplish this object, as well as
others, many articles have been remodeled from various works, and

. some have been written for the occasion, by the editor and others.

The book, is therefore, not a mere collection of unadapted extracts.
It may also be stated, that there are few pieces in the book to be
found in other readers ; and in no instance has a line been copied from
any school-book in common use. To this it may be added, that the
articles are so arranged with respect to each other, that they may be con-
tinuously read without the violent contrast between contiguous lessons,
complained of in some books. i 2 _ l -

With these observations, the author/leaves this volume to the public,
suggesting to teachers, that the mode of applying the rules of readin
pre xed to it, being peculiar, is also deemed important; as it wil
enable the teacher, in each lesson, to direct the pupil’s attention espec-
ially to one or more rules, and thus cause them to be impressed upon
the mind; and this can be done without occupying the pages of the
work with a frequent repetition of the same rule.

58 THE THIRDWREADER.

3. Such is true honor; and, though it may generally be
considered rather as a masculine accomplishment, still it is
not unworthy of being woven in with the graces of female
manners.

4. The dignity, frankness, and sincerity, which the princi-
ple of honor imparts to the air and bearing of every individ-
ual in whose. heart it resides, is not unbecoming in a lady,
though it may be ‘a more indispensable and appropriate ﬁn-
ish to the manners of a gentleman. .

'5. I need not say, that duelling, though often designated
as an “ affair of honor,” usually springs from a violation of

the principles of true honor. If a man has done another an

injury, he best avoids meanness, and consults his dignity,
by making due acknowledgments. .

6. If these are not satisfactory, does he act a noble part
in being cowed by public opinion, so as to risk his own life
or seek that of another, rather than stand upon his own
conscious rectitude’!

'7. Grace, in application to manners, is that ease and pro-
priety Which win the favor of all. It displays itself in those
movements of the body, those ex ressions of countenance,
those forms of speech, and that general bearing,'which ‘be-
speak good taste, chastened feelings, and reﬁnement.

8. It is a quality which puts astranger at ease, and ban-
ishes {uncomfortable restraint, even among those who may
be of unequal conditions in life, when they chance to meet

rfor*tli‘e ﬁrst time.

9. It is opposed alike to affectation and awkwardness, and
is of so captivating a nature, that _itfrnay be witnessed by
the plebeian in ‘the patrician without" envy, and without ex-
citing, a painful sense of humiliation. 'As“"ho“nor is the
essential mark of a gentleman, grace is the special orna-
ment of a lady. - . ‘

POLITENESS. 59

LESSON XXIII. V P0lz'teness.'*

1. THIS consists in an agreeable personal demeanor, and
is founded upon the great rule of morality ; “ Do to another
as_you would have another do to you.” We are apt to restrict
this to the greater transactions of life. iWhat I now pro-
pose is an observance of it in little things,——in the every-
day ‘intercourse between man and man. _

2. I do not mean the mere arbitrary forms and ceremo-
nies of fashionable life, but ‘I mean an habitual regard for the
feelings of others, and those looks, words, and actions which
spring from such a principle. ' . I

3. We have no more right wantonly to wound the sensi-

bility of another, than _wantonly to inﬂict Wounds upon his

body. We have no j more. right to steal away another’s

, peace of mind, thanto steal his visible and tangible proper-

ty_.,_ In a moral point of view the one act;is as Wrong as
theother. ~
4. We have laws to protect money, lands, and merchan-

' dise; politeness is a code of delicate_morals which would

throw- protection around the nicer and subtler feelings of the

-heart. Establish these in the mind; render them familiar

by habit, and easy by repetition.

5. Let all young persons regard the feelings of their
brothers, sisters, and playmates. Let them never attempt,
by look, Word, or deed, to inﬂict pain upon the sensitive bo-
som of their playfellows. , I ' t y

6. If they are indifferent, careless, or wanton in respect to
the feelings of their companions, let them remember, that
theyare guilty of ‘a mean and wicked offence. Let them
rather seek to mould all their feelings and manners so as to
please and gratify those around them. it I

'7. , Self-love is the master passion; and selﬁshness un-
checked is likely to rule the heart, and obtrudelits harsh
features through every look, and tone, and gesture. . n

8. If we would be virtuous, we must repress selﬁshness.
If we would be loved, we ‘must learn to check, its display.
Politeness is a training which renders this easy- It teaches

-us, when tempted by selﬁshness to snatch at some proffered

pleasure, to defer our own wishes to the claims of others. ,

10. I would say, then, to children and young persons,
Learn pol_2't.eness ; learn it as a principle of duty; persevere
in its practice, that it may becomea matter of habit. After
sleep, let the family circle meet in the morning with a kind-
ly salutation; as they part to rest, let their las-t words be a
fond “ Good night.”

11. Meeting, or parting, let the 'diﬁ'erent members of the
household be accustomed to show a delicate regard to the
wishes, tastes, and feelings of one another. Let this rule
govern in all our intercourse with mankind, and it will ex-
ert a powerful inﬂuence upon the heart itself, the source of
all our emotions.   i

LESSON X\X1V.. Manners at Table.

1. Avoid all display of greediness. It was formerly
esteemed a matter of propriety for each individual to delay
the— commencement of his meal till all were helped; but, as
this introduces a stiff ‘formality, and moreover causes the
food to get cold before it is eaten, it is now considered
proper for a person to begin to eat as soon as he is helped.

MANNERS IN THE STREET. 5]

2. It is better to put food into your mouth with your
fork than with your knife. Help yourself to salt only with
the salt-spoon. Eat with the least a-possible noise of the lips
and teeth. .

3. Never help yourself from any dish with your own
knife and fork; but apply to the person who is near it, or‘
who undertakes to. distribute its contents. If you are
called upon to help any person, never disgust him by over-
loadi_ng his plate. sDo everything with deliberation and an
air of leisure and delicacy.-

4. Easy, pleasant conversation should be promoted at the
table, but all argument and discussion shouldibe avoided.
Awkward positions, restlessness», picking of the teeth, ab-
sence of mind, inattention to the remarks or wants of those
‘around you, are gross breaches of good manners. -.

5. Before coming to the table, take care that your toilet id“
ﬁnished; and afterwards do nothing which may seem to in-
dicate, that you are thinking of your dress or personal ap-
pearance. ,

6. There is no disgrace in a good appetite; but, even in
satisfying it, we should habitually cultivate an air and man-

iier which may assert the dignity of human nature, and dis-

criminate between intellectual and moral beings and mere
animals.

1. Never push against people in the streets, or in any
crowded place. If by accident you come in contact with
another, make immediate amends by saying, “I beg your
pardon.” ' W

6

62 THE THIRD READER.

.,.2,.’_,_If in driving upon the road, you meet another person,
be solicitous to give him (ample space for passing you. Chil-
dren should be expressly forbidden to shout at passers-by.
These inconsiderate beginnings often grow into habitual
rudeness and impertinence.

3. If a man, young or old, meets a woman upon the road,
where she is unprotected, and by word, look, or deed, does
anything to offend her delicacy, he displays a gross instance
of dastardly brutality. " ‘

4. Let boys and young men make it aipoint to pay a
nice regard to the rights and feelings of the gentler sex.
The example of a certain New Hampshire mountaineer is
worthy of all praise.

5. A lady was travelling, a few years since, on the White
illountains. In ascending a steep‘ acclivity, some accident

“happened to her carriage; and while the coachman was re-

pairing it, she went up the hill on foot.

6. On turning an angle in the road, she met with a
Wagoner, who respectfully bade her good morning. She
then made some inquiry as to the road, and concluded by
expressing hersurprise to ﬁnd people living among these
wild hills. V

'7. “Well, ma’am,” said the Wagoner, “I suppose we
couldn’t live here, if we didn’t once in a while see a
lady.” This was genuine politeness,——pure, native -gold,
and not the less brilliant for the rustic ore through which it
shone. r V

8. In travelling, cultivate a pleasant intercourse with
those who gives you the opportunity; but obtrude yourself
upon no one. Put up with little inconveniences, and be
not pertinacious about your rights.

9. Avoid all arrogance to tavern-keepers, servants, and
others. Be neither inquisitive nor unduly communicative.

LESSON XXVI. Miscellaneozts Hints on Zllanners.

l_. A CLERGYMAN who should enter the pulpit in regimen-
tals, would be considered as bringingscandal upon his pro-
fession ; and amerchant who,;,: should go about the streets of
a city in a-sailor’s jacket, vdould subject himself to ridicule
and contempt. Dress is, therefore, a matter of some conse-
quence. ‘

2. The true rule in regard to dress is this, -— Let it be ap-

propriate to your condition. A person who is eager to adopt ’

any new fashion of dress, is always despised ; for it is proof
of a little mind. Keep rather behind than before the fash-
ion. Study simplicity. 7  , 1..
3. Always avoid the display of gaudy  Clean-
liness and, neatness, of attire are among the idecisiye

marks of good breeding. Vialgarity often displaysgitlself in

ostentatious and dashy decoration; ’ _ -

4.‘ Personal cleanliness ‘is indispensable to those who
would be esteemed well—bred. The’ teeth, especially, should
be kept scrupulously clean. Spitting, combing your hair,
and.‘ cleaning your nails, are three things to be done in
private. ' —  1

5. At church, let your manners ever be marked with rev-
erence baud decorum, paying respectto the rights and cer-
emonies. of the worshippers, though you may be of a
different creed.

6. In conversation, do not court argument, and never use

contradiction. Speak in a low, but ,distinct voice; and be
rather solicitous- to draw others out, than display yourself.

7. Be not ready to take offence, and shun temptation to
bitter retort. The spirit of the porcupine is of no great+~‘dig-
nity. ‘Good-humor is a better shield than an armory of
poisoned quills. ‘ at

8. Converse rather about things than persons. I You  i‘

LESSON XXVII. Accotnplishments.

1. BESIDE the knowledge and skill which belong to a
person’s profession, and qualify him to discharge the "serious
duties of  there are certain graceful arts, which are use-
ful, as being sources of pleasure to himself, and as rendering
him an interesting or agreeable member of society.

2. In respect to drawing and music, it may be well to
keep in mind, that, although there is great difference as to
the aptitude of persons . for these arts, there are still few, if

any, who are incapable of becoming proﬁcients in them, pro-

vided they begin early, and follow a proper mode of instruc-
tion.

3. The importance of these arts to individuals and society
at large, as furnishing innocent excitements and reﬁning
pastimes, and, therefore, as tending to the puriﬁcation of
private and public morals, cannot be too highly estimated.

4. The powerof walking several miles a day, as well for
a lady as a gentleman, though not usually ranked as an
accomplishment, may still be entitled, from its utility, to
decided encouragement. '

5. Reading well is an art which gives the possessor the
means of bestowing rich entertainment on others. But, of
all accomplishments, that of conversation is doubtless the
highest. What an inexhaustible power of amusement and
instruction has he, who possesses the art of conversing
easily and agreeably. T

ACCOMPLISHMENTS. 65

6. But let any one who desires to be loved, happy, or
respected, be careful not to indulge in personal satire or rid-
icule. A talent for either of these kinds of wit is seldom
associated with a great mind, or a good heart.

7. Besides, there is a debasing tendency in these things.
A satirist who is just and decent at ﬁrst, after a little prac-
tice, disregards both equity and propriety. He is eternally
seeking for some object of satire or -point of ridicule.

8. Under such eﬁbrts, the understanding is soon warped,
and becomes as incapable of just perception, as a piece of
wrinkled glass of transmitting true images. How pitiable
is such degradation of taste and intellect! Let us beware
of such things, and teach our tongues not to corrupt our
hearts. We should remember, that there is something in
human nature like gravitation, ever tending to draw us
downward. A

9. The arrow that is aimed’ below the mark will never
reach it, for it”will sink, rather than rise, in its ﬂight. You
must aim high, if you would hit. It is so in all moral things.

10. A person who would enjoy the consciousness of a
pure and generous heart, must cultivate pure and generous
speech ; at all events, he must avoid debasing his own mind
by dwelling upon the obliquities, vices, and follies of others.

11’. The art of narration is one of easy cultivation, and
not only affords ample scope for the exercise of talent, but
may also furnishgmuch amusement and instruction. This
seems to be a natural gift with some, and the society of
those who possess it is generally much sought after.

12. One may easily cultivate this talent, by reciting to
hisfriends at evenin the events and adventures of the day,
by detailing ‘ the substance of the books he may have read,
or by inventing tales from the resources of fancy.

LEssoN XXVIII. Books.

1. PREVIOUS to the invention of printing, in 1441, books
of every kind were scarce, and’, being written with pens,
were necessarily costly. A copy of the Bible was then
worth as much as a good house and farm are now.

2. King Alfred, of England, is said to have given a. very
large estate for a single volume. Inthose olden times, it is
clear, that the art of reading musthave been confined to
few persons. How great is the change that has taken place
in four hundred years !

3. Of the making of many books there is now no end;
and the idea of instructing every member of the communi-

"ty, not only in the art of reading, but in the elements of

geography, history, and philosophy, is no longer a chimera.
4. The printing of books upon typeswas a startling inven-

»-tion indeed, but strange combinations have taken place in
-our own day, to accelerate and expand its power.

5. It would seem-, that the vast beds of coal, which have

«slept for centuries in the gloomy recesses of the earth, could
‘have little to do with the progress of knowledge. But

these are now dragged from their repose, and compelled to
lend their power to the manufacture of books. ~ ’

6. Hundreds of steam presses are at work on both sides
of the Atlantic, throwing off countless quires of newspapers,
pamphlets, and volumes of every form, ﬁlled with every
species of literature. I '

'7. A single printer, in Scotland, had, a few years since,
forty thousandvolumes of the various works of Sir Walter
Scott, in the press, at one time. Three millions of a single
tract, by Hannah" More, were published in her lifetime.

8. Books to the value of a millionand a half of dollars
go from the Eastern to the Western States, annually. From
these scattered hints, we may form some faint conception of
the stupendous progress of improvement in the arts devoted
to the circulation of knowledge. .

9. But, while we are impressed with the advantages we
possess ‘over the people of former ages, let us consider one
thing, that books are human productions, and that some are

~ good and some bad.

10. Every volume has within it a spirit, and imparts to

those who commune with it either good or evil. Indiscrim-
inate reading, therefore, is dangerous to most ; to the young
it is perilous in the extreme.

11. Persons should exercise the same discretion in the
choice of books, as in the choice of their companions. The
danger is greater, indeed, from a bad book than from a bad
associate ; for there is. a magic iniprint, which gives it great
authority over the mind of the reader. , -

12. Nor should vigilance be restricted to any one form of
publication. The newspapers which are admitted to the
ﬁreside, to become the daily and weekly counsellors there,
should be selected with great care.

13; And this is becoming a matter of more serious con-
sideration, from the fact, that many newspapers are now
thrown forth upon the public, seeking to obtain patronage
by ministering to the worst passions of the human heart.

LESSON XXIX. The Blind Seal.

1.. ABOUT half a_ century ago, a young seal was taken in
Clew Bay, on the we_stern coast» of Ireland, and domesticated
in the kitchen of a gentleman, whose house was situated on
the seashore. It grew apace, becamefamiliar with the ser-
vants, and attached, to the house and family.

2. Its habits were innocent and gentle; it sported with
the children, came at its master’s call, and, in short, was
fond as a dog, and playful as a kitten. V

3. Daily the seal went out to ﬁsh; and, after providing for
its own wants, it frequently brought in a salmon or turbot to

its master. Its delight in summer was to bask in the sun,
and in winter to lie before the ﬁre, or, if permitted, to
creep into the huge oven.‘

4. For four years the seal had been thus domesticated,
when a disease, called in that part of the country the crip-
pawn, a kind of paralytic affection of the limbs, which gen-
erally ends fatally, attacked some cattle belonging to the
master of the house.

-5. A part of them died, and others became infected; and
the customary cure, produced by changing them to drier pas-
ture, failed. A wise woman, as she was called, was con-
sulted; and the hag assured the credulous owner, that the
mortality among his cows was occasioned by his retaining
an unclean beast about his habitation, the harmless and
amusing geal. ,

6. She insisted, that it must be made away with directly,
or the crippawn would continue, and her charms be insuﬂi-
cient to avert the malady. The superstitious proprietor
consented to the proposal ;. the seal was put on board a boat,
carried out beyond Clare Island, and there committed to the
deep, to manage for himself as he best could.

'7. The boat returned, and the family retired to rest. But
next morning a servant awakened her master to tell him,
that the seal was quietly sleeping in the oven. The poor
animal, over night, came back to his beloved home, crept
through an open window, and took possession of his favorite
resting-place ! _

8. Next morning, another cow was reported to be
attacked with the disease, and. it was decided that the seal
must now be ﬁnally removed. A Galway ﬁshing-boat was
leaving Westport on her return home ; and the master of it
undertook to carry off the seal, and not put him overboard,
until he had gone several leagues beyond Inis Baﬂin.

9. This was done. A day and night passed ; the second
evening closed; the servant was raking the ﬁre for the
night. ’ Something scratched gently at the door;——it was
of course supposed to be the house-dog. She opened it, and
in came the seal ! - ' g

10. Wearied with his long and unusual voyage, he testiﬁed
by a peculiar cry, expressive of pleasure, his delight to
ﬁnd himself safe at home. Then, stretching his length be-
fpre the glowing embers of the hearth, he fell into a deep
s eep.

THE BLIND SEAL. 69

ll. The master of the house was immediately apprized
of this unexpected and unwelcome circumstance. In this
exigency, the beldame was awakened and consulted; she
averred, that it was always unlucky to kill a seal, but sug-
gested, that the animal -should be deprived of sight, and a
third time carried out to sea.

12. To this unfeeling proposition, the man consented;
and next morning the affectionate and conﬁding creature
was -cruelly robbed of sight, on that hearth for which he had
resigned his native element! Writhing in agony, the muti-
lated seal was embarked, taken outside of Clare Island, and
for the last time committed to the waves. .

13. A week passed over, and things became worse instead
of better; the cattle of the proprietor died fast, and the

witch now confessed, that her arts were unavailing, and that

the destructive visitation upon his cattle exceeded her skill.

. 14. On the eighth night after the seal had been devoted
to the waves, it blew tremendously. In the pauses of the
storm, a wailing noise at times was faintly heard at the
door; the servants, who slept in the kitchen, concluded that

- the banshee had come to forewarn them of _an approaching

death, and buried their heads in the bed coverings.»

l5.lWhen morning broke, the door was opened ;——-the
seal Was there lying dead upon the threshold! It was a
mere skeleton, for the poor beast had perished from hunger;
being incapacitated by blindness to procure its customary food.

16. -It was buried in a sand-hill, and from that moment
it was observed, that misfortune followed" the abettors and
perpetrators of this inhuman deed. The hag, who_had
denounced the inoffensive seal, was within a twelvemonth
hanged for murder. A

17. Everything about the devoted house melted away.
Sheep rotted, cattle died, and “blighted was the corn.”
Of several children, none reached, maturity, and the cruel
proprietor, surviving everything, he loved on earth, at last
died himself, blind and miserable. ,

LESSON XXX. Integrity of Washington.

1. WHEN Washington was President of the United
States, an application was made to him by a gentleman, for
a lucrative and highly responsible oﬂice within his gift.
The application was made with more conﬁdence of success
from the fact, that this gentleman had been the companion
of the General throughout the whole course of the revolu-
tionary war, during which he had received, on various oc-
casions, indubitable marks of his kindness‘ and partiality. ,

2. He had become, in the estimation if not of himself, of
his friends, in a degree necessary to the happiness of Wash-
ington, and had, therefore, in their opinion, only to apply
for an oﬂice to receive it. It was a boon, which, while it
would secure a competency and ease to a. friend, would
bring that friend into frequent intercourse with his patron
and former friend in arms. .

3. For the same oflice there was, however, a competitor;
but he -was decidedly hostile to the politics of Washington,
and, as he had made himself conspicuous among opposers
of his administration, no serious apprehensions were felt
from this quarter. ,. s

4; Towards such a man,-—,-a well-known political ene-

my,—Washington could surely ‘feel under no obligations, i

and. was not likely to prefer such an one to a personal
friend and -favorite. Every one acquainted with the preten-
sions of the applicants, was at no loss to judge of the Presi-
dent’s decision, and the current opinion was in favor of the
friend, and against his competitor; \

X 5. Judge, then,‘ the general surprise, when it was an-
nounced, that the political opponent of Washington was
appointed to the oﬂice,’ and the former associate of the

INTEGRITY OF WASHINGTON. '7]

General in the toils and privations of a camp was left desti-
tute and neglected._ _,

6. When this decision was known, a mutual friend, who
interested himself in the affair, ventured to remonstrate with
the President on the injustice of the appointment. “My
friend,” replied this illustrious man, “ I receive with a cor-
dial welcome to my heart; but, with all iliis good qualities,
he is not a man of business. My private feelings have
nothing to do in this case. As George Washington, I
would do this man any kindness in my power, but, as Presi-
dent of the United States, I can do nothing ! ” _

'7. Who can read this incident in the life of this distin-
guished man, and not admire his integrity’! The tempta-
tion to hazard the public good for the beneﬁt and gratiﬁca-

tion of a friend,-—and such a friend,—must have been

powerful. Some might have persuaded themselves, that the
public good would not suﬂfer ; at least they would have
been Willing to make the experiment. ,

8. But Washington appears to have proceeded in this in-
stance (and in what similar instance did he not ’!) upon just

. and conscientious principles. His friend, with all his esti-

mahle qualities, had no business tact, His rival was a gen-
tleman of strong integrity, promptitude, and ﬁdelity in busi-
ness, and had qualities, which, if called into exercise, would
render service to the States. The decision of Washington,
therefore, was just, honorable, and patriotic. A

9. But whence this admirable, I may almost say, singular
integrity? Was Washington an exception to the inﬁrmi-
ties‘ of our nature’! Or was his piety of a higher order,
and more eﬁicient in its inﬂuence’! The ﬁrst is inadmissi-
ble; the latter, improbable. But the true explanation of
his sterling integrity is to be found, I think, in that happy
and eﬂicient maternal inﬂuence, which it  well known
was exercised upon him in "his, earlier years.

10. On the death of his father, when he was about ten
years old, the charge of his education devolved upon his
mother. All accounts concur in the admission, that 'she_Was
an extraordinary woman; possessing not only rare intellect-
ual endowments, but those moral qualities which give eleva-
tion, worth, and dignity to the soul. These‘ qualities she
was particularly desirous to engraft upon the heart of a be-

7g . THE THIRD READER.

loved son; and with what success she exerted herself for this
purpose, the history of his life displays.

11. The particular process by which she accomplished
so happy a design, it is not in my power at this time to de-
scribe; but a story occurs to my recollection, which may
serve to show the adroit manner inwhich she proceeded on
a certain occasion.

12. In the ample pasture belonging to her plantation, was
a. colt, which, on account, of its beauty and high promise,
she valued very much. Although of sufﬁcient age to be
used, it had never been mounted, no one seeming disposed
to attempt to break its wild and vicious spirit. One day,
George proposed to some of his companions to assist him at
a future time to secure the colt, until he could mount, and
he would curb his proud spirit.

13. Accordingly, soon after sunrise one morning, the
youthful band assembled, and having driven the animal into
an enclosure, succeeded, with no small difficulty however,
in bridling him. In a moment George sprung upon his
back, and the next ‘moment the surprised, wild, and mad-
dening creature sprung forth into the open ﬁeld, rearing,
plunging, and running, but George, clinging fast bythe
bridle and the mane, held his seat ﬁrmly, as much deter-
mined to subdue, ‘as the colt was detegrmined not to be sub-
duedi

14. The struggle was mutually desperate; and, as the
companions of George looked on, terror. and amazement
increased every moment. At length the colt obtained the
advantage, and, bounding forward with the speed of an
arrow, made a false step, and in his fall broke a blood vessel,
and died onthe spot.

15. George came down unhurt, but when he beheld the
gasping of the noble animal, and »-thought of his mother’s
regard for it, his heart was troubled. His companions hur-
ried to the spot, and, joining in the regret of George, anx-
iously inquired, “ What will your mother say’! Who can tell
her?” -
~ 16. At this moment they Were summoned to breakfast.
When seated at the table, Mrs. Washington said, “Well,
younggentlemen, have you seen my sorrel colt in your ram-
bles this morning?” '

INTEGRITY OF WASHINGTON. 7'3

17. The question was natural; but what a question it
was! No answer was returned, and it was repeated. Upon
this, George, with a perfect frankness, replied, “Mother,
the sorrel colt is dead ! ” '

18. This was followed by an exact account of the whole
affair. As the agitated narrator passed along in his story, a
ﬂush of displeasure was seen rising upon the mother’s
cheek; but it soon passed away, and she kindly and calmly
said, “ While I regret the loss of my favorite, I rejoice in
my son, who always speaks the truth.”

, 19. I scarcely know in what terms to express my admira-
tion of the woman, or the manner in which she treated this
delicate and difficult case. George was greatly in fault, and
her rebuke was appropriate and commensurate; he frank-

.ly confessed the whole act, and she expressed her high sense

of his regard for truth. . y

_ 20. That speech, short as it was, I dare say, told upon
his heart, drew his mother nearer to his bosom, and
taught him more effectually, and more lastingly, the impor-
tance and value of truth and integrity, than a volume of

, lectures would have done.

, 21. It was by such means, that this part of the character
of Washington was formed. Under the tutelage of such a
mother, the foundation of a character was laid, which was
the admiration of the generation that was contemporary with
him, which has lost nothing of its glory to the’ present time,
and will lose nothing as long as his memory shall last.

LESSON XXXI. On ,Relz'gz'on.

1. How lamentable is it, that so few hearts should feel
the pleasures of real piety; that prayer and thanksgiving
should be performed, as they too often are, not with joy,
love, and gratitude, but with cold indifference, melancholy
dejection, or secret aversion.

, 2. It is true, we are all such frail and sinful creatures, that
we justly fear to have offended our gracious Father ; but let

us remember the condition of his forgiveness; If you have ~

sinned,“ sin no more.”

3. He is ready to receive you, whenever you sincerely
turn to him; and he is ready to assist you, when you do but
desire to obey him.

- 4. Let your devotion, then, be the language of ﬁlial love
and gratitude; conﬁde to this kindest of Fathers every want

‘ and every wish of your heart; but submit them all to his

will, and freely offer him the disposal of yourself and all
your affairs.

5. Thank him for his beneﬁts, and even for his punish-
ments; convinced that these also are beneﬁts, and merciful-
l.y designed for your good. Implore his direction in all diﬂi-
culties, his assistance in all trials, his comfort and support
in sickness or affliction, his restraining grace in times of
prosperity and joy.

6. Do not persist in desiring what his Providence denies
you, but be assured it is not good for you. Refuse not any-
thing he allots you, but embrace it as the best and most
proper for you. Can you do less to your heavenly Father
than what your duty to an earthly one requires’!

'7. If you were to ask permission of your father to do or
to have anything you desire, and he should refuse it to you,
would you obstinately persist in setting your heart upon it,
notwithstanding his prohibition’! Would you not say, “ My
father is wiser than I am; heloves me, and would not deny
my request,,if it were ﬁt to be granted; I will therefore
banish the thought, and cheerfully acquiesce in his will ” ’!

8. How much rather should this be said of your heavenly
Father, whose wisdom cannot be mistaken, and whose
kindness is inﬁnite! Love him, therefore, in the same man-

ON RELIGION. , 75

ner as you love your earthly parents, but in a much higher
degree, in the highest your nature is capable of.

9. Forget not to dedicate yourself to his service every
day, to implore his forgiveness of your faults, and his pro-
tection from evil, every night; and this, not merely in for-
mal words, unaccompanied by any act of the mind, but “in
spirit and in truth,” in grateful love, and humble adoration.

10. Nor let these stated periods of worship be your only
communication with him ; accustom yourself often to think
of him throughout your Waking hours; to contemplate his
wisdom and power in the works of his hands; to acknowl-
edge his goodness in every object of use and pleasure, to de-
light in giving him praise in your inmost heart, in the midst
of every innocent gratiﬁcation, in the liveliest hour of social

. enjoyment.

11. You cannot conceive, if you have not experienced,
how much silent acts of gratitude and love will enhance
every pleasure, nor Awhatosweet serenity and cheerfulness
such reﬂections will diiilhise over your mind.

12. On theggtlger hand, when you are suffering pain and
sorrow, when you are conﬁned to an unpleasant situation, or
engaged in a painful duty, how will it support and animate
you, to refer yourself to your Almighty Father; to be as-
sured, that he knows your state and your intentions; that no
effort of virtue is lost in his sight, nor the least of your ac-
tions or sufferings disregarded or forgotten; that his hand is
ever over you, to ward off every real evil which is not the
eifect of your‘own ill conduct, and to relieve every suffer-
ing that is not useful to your future well-being.

LESSON XXXII. Tlze Belfry Pigeon.

. ON the cross-beam under the Old South bell,

The nest of a pigeon is builded well.

In summer and winter that bird is there,
Out and in with the morning air; -

I ’ve passed him oft, and I know his peck,
By the play of gold in his mottled neck:

'. And I love’ to see him track the street,

With his wary eye and active feet;

And I often watch him as he springs, _
Circling the steeple with easy wings,
Till across the dial his shade has passed,
And the belfry edge is gained at last.

. "r is a bird I love, with his brooding note,

And the pulsing throb in histrembling throat;
There ’s a human look in his swelling breast,
And" the gentle curve of his lowly. crest;

And I often stop with the fear I feel, .

He runs so close to therapid wheel.

 Whatever is rung on that noisy bell,

‘Chime of the hour "or funeral knell,

The dove in the belfry must hear it well.

When the tongue swings out to the midnight moon,
When the sexton cheerly ringsvfor noon,

vWhen the clock strikes clear at morning light,
When the child is waked with “ nine at night,”

. When the chimes play soft on the Sabbath air,
. Filling the spirit with tones of prayer,

Whatevertale in the bellis heard,

He broods on his folded feet unstirred;
Or, rising half in his rounded nest,

He takes the time to smooth his breast,

.Then drops again with ﬁlmed eyes,

And sleeps as the last vibration dies.

. Sweet bird! I would that I could be

A hermit in the crowd like thee;

THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET. 77

With wings to ﬂy to wood and glen.
Thy lot, like mine, is cast with men ;
And daily, with unwilling feet,

Itread, like thee, the crowded street;
But, unlike me, when day is o’er,

Thou can’st dismiss the world and soar,
Or, at a half-felt wish for rest,

Can’st smooth the feathers on thy breast,
And drop, forgetful, to thy nest.

Spell and define : pigeon, mottled, belfry, brooding, rapid, chime, mid-
night, tongue, Sabbath, vibration, hermit, half-felt.

Faults of pronunciation. For-git-ful for for-get-ful, ac-tive for ac-t’1'v.

Note on the Lesson. The description of the pigeon is here beautiful, and
it is natural for the tired and jaded spirit to seek amomentary exhilaration in
contemplating the light and easy cares of a bird. The chief advantage,
however, to be gained from reading this piece, is, that the taste is cultivated
by studying its graceful language, and its graphic imagery. "

Question on the Rules. How should poetry be read '2 Rule 22.

LESSON, XXXIII. The Old ,0aIten_ Bucket.

1. How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood,
When fond recollection’ presents them to view;
The orchard, the meadow, the deep-tangled wild-Wood,
And every loved spot which my infancy knew;
The wide-spreading pond, and the mill which stood by it,
The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell;
The cot of my father,_the dairy-house nigh it,
And e’en the rude bucket which hung in the well ;
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well!

2. That moss-covered vessel I hail as a treasure ;
For often at noon, when returned from the ﬁeld,
I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure,
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield:
How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing,
And quick to the white—pebbled bottom it fell,
Then soon with:-the emblem of truth overﬂowing,
And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well ;

The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket arose from the well!

3. How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it,
As, poised on the curb, it inclined to my lips!
Not a full, blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it,
Though ﬁlled with the nectar that Jupiter sips.
And now, far removed from the loved situation,
The tear of regret will intrusively swell,
As fancy reverts to my father’s plantation,
And sighs for the bucket which hangs in the Well;

The moss-covered bucket which hangs in the well !

LESSON XXXIV. Western Part qf the State of Nezp
N York. '

1,. THE western portion of this great and thriving State
now presents many large towns, and a multitude of growing
villages; yet it has been almost wholly settled within the last
thirty years. Thirty-ﬁve years‘ ago there was not a house
in Rochester, and. now there are nearly twenty thousand peo-
ple there. Thirty-ﬁve years ago, Utica had scarcely ﬁfty
houses, and now it has, I believe, ten thousand inhabitants.

2. The growth in this ‘part of the State seems indeed
quite magical. I recollect a story of what happened near
Rochester, within the last thirty years. Two persons were
travelling on horseback through the ‘woods in winter, guided
only by ’a ‘horse-path. , ‘ ‘

3. The "snow had recently fallen to a great depth, and

they at length _lost their way. They undertook to retrace
their steps; but night came on, while they were still in the
midst of the forest. '

4. They knew they were a considerable distance from any
settlement, and had no hope of reaching a.,house during the
night. It therefore became apparent, that they must spend
it in the woods. But, as the sun went down, the cold in-
creased, and, in a short time, it was exceedingly severe.

5. The horses were worn out with fatigue, and the travel-
lers began to fear that they should be frozen. They looked
about for the ‘shelter of a rock, or some other place, but

nothing of the kind presented itself. Their situation was '

now alarming; they could not proceed, and to remain idle
was certain death.

6. At length one of them recollected, that he had a small
tinder-box in his pocket. This he took out, and the travel-

lers set about making preparations to build a ﬁre With great

alacrity. They got together the bark of some trees and
some dry branches; they then began to prepare the tinder-
box, but, on examining it, the tinder was entirely gone.

7. There was, however, in the box a small piece of linen
rag, the edges of which were burnt. These edges were care-
fully rolled together, and, with a trembling hand, the sparks
of ﬁre were struck upon them; again and again the effort
was made, but without success.

8. With feelings of the deepest anxiety, the travellers"

bent over the box. Life and death hung on the issue. If
the spark caught, they were safe ; if not, they must perish.
To such a narrow point is human fortune often reduced.

9. The ﬂint is now struck with greater force. The ﬁre
descends in a shower, but without avail. Again, again, and
again they make the trial, and -they are on the point of giv-
ing themselves up in despair. , T

10. Another blow is struck; it is caught by the tinder,
and a match is ‘lighted; some small ﬁbres of wood are set
on ﬁre, andin a few minutes the travellers are warming
themselves by a bright blaze !

11. Here they remained duringpthe night. In the morn-
ing they mounted their horses, and reached theiplace of

their destination in__ safety. Does”it seem that this could‘

have taken place Within a mile or two of Rochester, and
not more than thirty years ago? * v . V a

Whispered in fear and love,

Or folds it to repose.

Obedient to thy will, a

LESSON XXXVI. The Indian Mounds.

.1. I NEVER at any time approached the Indian mounds,
those relics of a people and of a time of which no recollec-
tion or tradition has been preserved, without interest and

_ feeling.

2. That the hands that have reared them should long
ago have been mingled with the clay, of which they formed
these simple, but enduring monuments, excites no wonder ;
generation departs after generation, one dynasty follows
another; one nation perishes, and its place is ﬁlled by
another; but it is seldom that all memory, all tradition, is

' lost of a people.

3. A name alone may remain, without any other distinc-
tive feature; but it is still a name, and under it the exis-
tence of a distinct division of the human race may yet
stand recorded in the book of the world’s history.

4. But here, on this vast continent, dispersed over a
great extent of territory, you ﬁnd the relics of an utterly for-
gotten race. They must have been a numerous one, for the
magnitude of the works they have left behind them attest it.

5. You see mounds raised upon the rich, level plains of
the West, which will ever remain a marvel. They must have
attained to a certain’ degree of civilization and sedentary
habits, superior to the races whom the present age has seen
in turn displaced by those of our own hue and blood; they
were more civilized, more powerful, more enlightened than
the Indian races of our day.

6. We read this truth in the vestiges of their towns and
fortiﬁcations, and the lands once cultivated by them; yet it

is in vain you pry into the secret of their deeds, time of ex-'

istence, or history. You dig into their places of sepulture;
you handle their bones, but they are silent, and tell you

82 THE THIRD READER.

nothing; and the utensils you unearth, only show you that
they were numerous, and, however powerful, simple in their
habits. ,

'7. Thus we see, among mankind, change follows change;
language, language; one people tread in the steps and on
the graves of their predecessors, and, among men, nothing
like perfection is seen ; even the advance in cultivation, and
the attainment of light and knowledge, being by no means
progressive.

8. It is often retarded for centuries; and everything in
connexion with humanity shows the imperfection of its
nature, the weakness of its purposes, and the futility of its
projects, though distinguished above the rest of God’s earthly
creations by the gift of a living soul, in addition to the
common boon of the breath of life, granted to the rest
of animate nature. ’

Spell and deﬁne: mounds, relics, dynasty, tradition, existence, continent,
vestiges, powerful, sepulture, utensils, numerous, progressive, humanity, crea-
tions, animate, futility.

Faults of pronunciation : rared for reared, airth-lay for earth-ly.

Note. In the Southern States, and also in the great valle of the Missis-
sippi, are the remains of artiﬁcial works, evidently reared y nations now
extinct. Among these are numerous mounds, some of great extent, and
showing that the nations who produced them must have been great and
powerful. Yet these have passed away, and no record is left to tell us who
they were. .

LESSON XXXVII. Love and Jealousy.

1. IN yonder grove of myrtle straying,
I saw a damsel and a child ;
Joy on his frolic brow was playing, ,
Her cheeks were pale, her looks were Wild.

2. Oft as he culled the dewy ﬂowers,
His playful gambols she forbid,

Lovn TO con. 83

And, if he roved to distant bowers,
His steps controlled, his wanderings chid.

3. Time passed away on airy pinion,

The child had ﬂed her harsh dominion,
And, hopeless, she was left to moan.

The weeping mourner, Jealousy.

Spell and define : myrtle, frolic, dewy, gambols, wanderings, pinion,

4 nymph, prying, jealousy.

Fault of pronunciation : hash for harsh.

I ZVote on the Lesson. The moral of this is, that love and jealousy cannot
.-ve together in peace. It would teach us to place our aﬁ"ections only on

those ‘who are worthy of our conﬁdence, and never to indulge suspicion of .

the ﬁdelity, love, or friendship of those we have taken to our bosoms.

LESSON XXXVIII. Love to God; a Dialogue.

Katharine. Certainly, mother, if you tell me to love God,
I shall try to do so. But why should I  lnm? and how
shall I love him’! I do no-t see him ; I.do’n_ojt hear him.

Mother. Step to this balcony, my child. The sun is set-
ting, and its purple light is fading from the valley. The
night is coming on, and the-stars begin to twinkle inthe
sky. As the sun goes down, the moon is rising in the east.
Stay here, and study this scene.

K. It is beautiful, mother; it is indeed beautiful!

M. Is it not even more than beautiful, Katharine’! Is it
not sublime’! While one world is setting in the west,
another is rising in the east! As the light fades, a curtain
seems drawn from the sky, and discloses to us thousands of
other worlds, shining above us! 4

K. Yes, mother, and it is all wonderful.

84 THE THIRD READER.

M. And who made these things, Katharine’!

K. I know that God made them. —

M. Well,'now take a closer vievv of the valley. Do you
notice the smooth, quiet lake, reﬁecting the moon and the
stars C’ V

K. Yes.

M. And do you mark the tops of yonder mountains, pur-
pled withgthe sunset’!

»K. Yes.

M And do you listen to the songs of the various birds, —
the robin, the thrush, the mocking bird? i ‘

K. Yes.

M. And what feelings do all these things excite in your
heart ’! v I

K. I feel happy, mother, —-I feel what I cannot well put
into words.

M. Yes, Katharine, these beautiful works of nature do ex-
cite feelings which none can fully express. They ﬁll the
mind with images, and elevate the soul With emotions, too
exquisite, too lofty for human speech. But has it never oc-
curred to you, that God, in these beautiful works of nature,
is speaking to us, and that the exquisite thoughts and
feelings excited by them are but the answer of our hearts to
his appeal ’!

K. I have never thought of the subject in that light.

M. But is not that the true light in which we should
view it’! You say, you have never seen God; but his Works
are before you every day of your life, and if you will but
study them, you can be sure of his existence, and certain

of his character. You have an uncle in England, who has

sent you pretty presents, and Written you many kind letters.
Now, you have never seen your uncle; but have you any
doubt that he really exists’! ' ‘

K. Certainly not, mother. «

M. ‘And have you any doubt, that your uncle loves you,
and desires your happiness’! -

K. Surely not. It would be very absurd to suppose that
I have rio uncle, when. he has been sending me presents
every year, and has been writing me kind letters ever. since
I could read.

M. And do Vou love your uncle '!

LOVE TO GOD.7,_‘, 35

K. Can you doubt it, mother’! Shoul_d I not be ungrate-
ful and unfeeling not to love one so good and so kind C?

III. Well, my child, let us ‘now apply this to our subject.
You have never seen your uncle, nor heard his voice, and
yet you feel assured that he exists, and you love him sin-
cerely. And does not God prove his existence to us, beyond
the possibility of mistake, by his great and glorious works’?

a Who but God could have spread out this sky, and studded

the ﬁrmament with shining worlds’! Who but God could
have thrown up yonder hills, and scooped out this valley, and
gathered into-‘its bed the wide waves of that lake? And
who, but a good and benignant being, would have made all
these things beautiful, and placed creatures among them, to
feel and delight in their beauty’! ‘

K. Indeed, mother, it must be so; These great and glo- '

rious works must have had a great -and glorious Author. As

_these are beautiful too, and give ,us pleasure, he must have

designed them for our proﬁt and happiness. He is therefore
kind and benignant.

M. That is quite true, and can you not now love God,
though you have never seen him?»

K. I think I can, mother,—-— indeed, how can I help lov-
ing one so great and yet so good’! I can now perceive,
mother, the ingratitude of the” heart that refuses to love God,
and the folly, as well as the wickedness, of refusing to do
as he commands us. Surely one so great must know what
is best for us; and one so kind, one who has done so
much to make us happy, has a title to our obedience and af-
fection. ' . I t ‘ ” A - 

M. And remember one thing more, my child. Your
uncle, you say, has written you kind letters, and this has not
only‘ strengthened your conﬁdence in the existence of your
uncle, but it has excited and conﬁrmed your affection for him.
God has, also, written letters to his children, in the books

of the Old and New Testament. Study them, Katharine, .

and you will see, that they prove the existence of God, and
his love for his creatures,'more strongly than human Writ-*~
ings can prove human affection.

LESSON XXXIX. The Leaf.

1. IT came with spring’s soft sun and showers,
Mid bursting buds and blushing ﬂowers’; .
It ﬂourished on the same lightstem,
It drank the same clear. dews with them.-
The crimson tints of summer morn,
That gilded one, did each adorn :

2. The breeze that whispered light and brief
To bud or blossom, kissed the leaf;
When o’er the leaf the tempest ﬂew,
The bud and blossom trembled too.

3. But} its companions passed away,
And left the leaf to lonedecay. ,
The gentle gales of spring Went by, a
The fruits and ﬂowers of summer die.
The autumn winds swept o’er the hill,
And winter’s breath came cold and chill.
4. The leaf now yielded to the blast,

And on the rushing stream was cast.

Far, far it glided to the sea,

And whirled and eddied’ wearily,

Till suddenly it sank to rest,

And slumbered in the ocean’s breast.

5. Thus life begins, ——its morning hours
Bright as the birthday of the ﬂowers, —
Thus passes like the leaves away,

As withered and as lost as they.

6. Beneath the parent roof we meet ‘:

..In joyous groups, and gayly greet

THE SEA-BIRD. 87

The golden beams of love and light
That dawn upon the youthful sight.

'7. But soon we part, and one by one,

Like leaves and flowers, the group is gone.
One gentle spirit seeks the tomb, .
His brow yet fresh with childhood’s bloom.

8. Another treads the paths of fame,

And barters peace to win a name.
Another, still,- tempts fortune’s wave,
And, seeking wealth, secures a grave.

9. The last" grasps yet the brittle thread,
Though friends are gone and joy is dead;
Still dares the dark and fretful tide,

And clutches at its power and pride,
Till suddenly the waters sever,
And, like the leaf, he sinks forever.

Spell and deﬁne : blushing, brief, tempest, gentle, breast, yielded, eddied,
bright, wearily, group, childhood, wealth, thread, fretful, forever.
Faults of pronunciation. Growp for group, jy A for joy.

JVote on the Lesson. The design of the writer is to convey the impression,
that, on account of its ﬂeeting nature, life may be ﬁtly compared to a leaf.
We ought, therefore, while we enjoy life, ‘still to reflect, that it does not last
long; and we must be prepared for its termination. \

LESSON XL. T/ee;S'ea-Bird.

1. FAR, far o’er the deep is my island throne,
Where the sea-gull roams and reigns alone‘;
Where noughtis seen but the beetling rock,
And nought is heard but the ocean-shock,

And the scream of birds when t.he storm is nigh,
And the crash of the wreck, and the fearful cry
Of drowning men, in their agony.

2. I love to sit, when the waters sleep,
And ponder the depths of the glassy deep,

RULES FOR, READERS.

u-2.-jg

1. Remember that the. object of reading, in
general, is to acquire ideas and sentiments that
are written or printed.

Even when you sit down to read by yourself, be careful to understand
every word and sentence. If there is anything you do not perfectly compre-
hend, ask some person to explain it to you. If you meet with words you do
not know the meaning of, consult a dictionary. If you read carelessly, you
subject yourself to two evils ; you miss the object of reading, which is to

gain knowledge, and you are in danger of adopting the habit of reading in ‘

a negligent and slovenly manner; which is a very bad habit. You should
consider a book as a box of jewels, and you must read attentively, or they
may slip through your ﬁngers.

2. Remember that the object of reading aloud
is to make your hearers understand and feel what

-you read.

‘When you are reading to others, keep in mind what you read. It is a
common fault to read as if words were mere sounds, without ideas. This
might do for a parrot, but not for youth.

3. Read every word distinctly.

If you articulate every word perfectly, people will easily hear and under-

stand what you read, and they will therefore listen with /pleasure. If your

articulation is mumbling or imperfect in any way, your hearers will be dis-
gusted. Do not slip over any words, because they are little. Do not

uddle long words into a heap, but give each syllable its full sound. An
inarticulate or indistinct reader distresses his auditors.

4. In order to convey to others the sense of an
author, you must understand what you read.

All young persons, before they read aloud to others, should be careful to
read over the lesson, and learn the meaning of every word and sentence. If
they do not this, they are liable to read very badly. You are not likely to
makelothers understand what you read, if you do not understand it yourself.

5. Read naturally.
By this I mean, that you should read as you suppose the author of the piece
you are reading would have spoken it to your audience.
6. Let your tone of voice be neither too soft,
nor too loud.

You should pitch your voice so that every person whom you read to, may
hear distinctly. If you make it a labor for your audience to hear or.un-
derstand, you miss the object of reading,,.and your hearers’ will be rather
pained than pleased.

‘ THE THIRD anlinna.

Till I dream that I ﬂoat on a corse at sea,
And sing of the feast that is made for me.

. I love on the rush of the storm to sail,

And mingle my scream with the hoarser gale:

. When the sky is dark, and the billow is high,

When the tempest sweeps in its terror by,
I love to‘ ride on the maddening blast,
To ﬂap my wing o’er the fated mast,

V And sing to the crew a song of fear,

Of the reef and the surge. that“ await them here.

. When the storm is done and the revel is o’er, ‘

I love to sit on the rocky shore,

And tell to the ear of the dying breeze,

The tales that are hushed in the sullen seas.
Of the ship that sank in”the reefy surge,

And left her fate to the sea-gull’s dirge;

Of the lover, that sailed to meet his bride,
And his story gave to the secret tide, - ’

Of the father, that went on the trustless main,
And never was met by his child again;

Of the hidden things which the waves conceal,

And. the sea-bird’s song can alone reveal.

. I tell of the ship that hath found a grave, --

Her spars still ﬂoat on the restless wave,
But down in the halls of the voiceless deep
The forms of the brave andtheybeautiful sleep.

. I saw the storm as it gathered fast,

I heard the roar of the coming blast, I
I marked the ship in her fearful strife,
As she ﬂew on_ the tide, like a thing of life.

. But the whirlwind came, and her masts were wrung

Away, and away -on the waters ﬂung;

t I sat on the gale o’er« the sea-swept deck,

And screamed in delight o’er the coming wreck, -
I ﬂew to the reef with a heart of glee,
And wiled the ship to her destiny. i

. On the hidden rocks like ahawk she rushed,
- And the sea through her riven timbers gushed ;

O’er the whirling surge the wreck was ﬂung,
And loud on the gale wild voices rung.

THE SEA-BIRD.

. I gazed on the scene, —I saw despair

On the pallid brows of a youthful pair.

The maiden drooped like a gentle ﬂower,

That is lashed by the gale in its quivering bower;
Her arms round her lover she wildly twined,
And gazed on the sea with a wildered mind.

. He bent o’er the trembler, and sheltered her form
From the plash of the sea, and the Sweep of the storm;
V But woe to the lover, and woe to the maid,

Whose hopes onthe treacherous deep are laid !
For the sea hath a King whose palaces shine
In lustre and light down the pearly brine;

And he loves to gather in glory there

The choicest things of the earth and air.

In his deep saloons with coral crowned, _
Where gems are sparkling above and around,
He gathers his harem of love and grace,

And. beauty he takes to his ‘cold embrace.

The winds and the waves are his messengers true,
And lost is the wanderer whom they pursue‘;
They sweep the shore, they plunder the wreck,
His stores to heap, and his halls to deck-.

Oh! lady and lover, ye are doomed their prey !
‘They come! they come ! ye are swept away !
Ye sink in the tide, — but it cannot sever

The fond ones who sleep in its depths forever!

Wild ! wild was the ‘storm, and loud was its roar,
And strange were the sights that I hovered o’er ; f I
I saw the babe with its mother ‘die; ‘
I listened to catch its parting sigh;
And I laughed to see the black billows play

With the sleeping ‘child in their gambols gay.

I saw a girl whose arms were white .

As the foam, that ﬂashed on the billows’ height,
And the ripples played with her glossy curls,

And her cheek was kissed by the dancing whirls ;
But her bosom was dead to hope and fear, I

For she shuddered not as the shark came near.

tion. - 1
Question on the Rules. How should this piece’ be read’! .Rule 10.

LESSON XLI. Truth and Justice.

1. TRUTH is the foundation of virtue. An habitual re-
gard for it is absolutely necessary. He who walks by the
light of it, has the advantage of the midday sun‘; he who
would Spurn it, goes forth amid clouds and darkness. There
is no way in which a man strengthens his own judgment,
and acquires respect in society, so surely as by a scrupulous
regard to truth. '

2. The course of such an individual is onward and straight
onward. He is no weathercock, pointing one way to-day
and another to-rnorrow. Truth to him is like a mountain
landmark to the pilot; he ﬁxes his eye upon a point that.
does not move, and he enters the harbor in safety.

3. On the contrary, one who despises truth and loves
falsehood, is like a pilot who takes a ‘piece of drift-wood for
his landmark, which changes with every changing wave.
On this he ﬁxes his attention ; and, being insensibly le-d from
his course, strikes, upon some hidden reef, and sinks to rise
no more. Thus truth brings success; falsehood results in
ruin and contempt. I

TRUTH AND JUSTICE, 91

4. "Justice is a great virtue, implying in its general sense
the obligation to render to every one what is his due. In the
common acceptation, it is the duty of being honestand fair
in all our dealings. But it has a farther signiﬁcation. It
not only binds us to deal equitably in matters of property,

.but requires us to respect the feelings and characters of

others. . .

5. If you take an unfair advantage of a man in a bar-
gain, you cheat him; if you take away his goods or mer-
chandise, without his consent, you are guilty of theft. If
you forcibly take away another’s purse, you are a robber.
For all these acts of injustice, human laws provide punish-
ment; there are comparatively few, therefore, who will be
guilty of such crimes.

6. But I am afraid that many persons, who would be
shocked at the idea of cheating, thieving, or robbing, in mat-
ters of property,,have yet no scruples in cheating another
of what may be due to his character, —of stealing away his
peace of mind, or robbing him of his fair fame. But it should
not be forgotten, that justice requires fair dealing in the one
case as well as in the other; that, if human laws watch over
the rights of property, the all-seeing eye of Justice watches
over the subtler rights and «possessions ‘of the heart.

7.’ It is true, we\have walls and fences to protect our lands,
bolts and bars tosecure our merchandise; we have also
statutes against acts of injustice in respect to property; we
have courts to try, and prisons to punish, offenders against
these laws; and all this array of power admonishes every
member of ‘society to be just in the common business of life.

8. But there are dearer possessions, than those of lands
and merchandise which are thus protected. “He who
steals my purse steals trash, but he who robs me of my
good name leaves me poor indeed.” And how shall these
delicate interests be defended’! I know of no other way
than by inculcating a sense of justice in society.

9. And, to make this effectual, let parents begin with their
children. Let them not only caution them against theft,
and cheating, androbbery, but against all those little tricks,
arts, and artiﬁces, by which children attempt to wound each
other’s feelings; by which one child endeavors to shift to
another the blame that belongs to himself; and, above all,

against the wanton, mischievous, or malicious tendency, .

92 THE THIRD READER.

which children often’ have, to exaggerate the faults or mis-
represent the conduct of others.

10. One_ thing farther, let children be taught by example
and precept never to wound a person’s feelings because he is
poor; because he is deformed; because he is unfortunate;
because he holds a humble station in life; because he is
Weak in body or mind ; because he is awkward, or because
the God of nature has bestowed upon him a darker skin
than upon others.

11. The rich person, who makes an ostentatious display
of his wealth, and thereby robs a poor one of his peace of
mind, is, in the eye of morality, a robber. The fortunate
person, who bestows scorn and contempt upon the unfortu-
nate, and thus takes away his self-respect, is, in the eye of
morality, a thief. Let such lessons» as these be engraved on
the heart of every young person. '

Spell and deﬁne : habitual, scrupulous, auspices, falsehood, acceptation,

for observation in the village and its inhabitants. Wherever
they went they were kindly entertained.

2. If they entered a lodge, the buffalo robe was spread be- .

fore the ﬁre for them to sit down upon ; the pipe was brought,
and, while the master of the lodge conversed with his
guests, the squaw put the earthen vessel on‘ the ﬁre," well
ﬁlled with dried buffalo meat and pounded corn ; for the In-
dian in his native state, before he has mingled much with
white men, and acquired _ their sordid habits, has the hospi-
tality of the Arab. Never does a stranger enter his door
without having food placed before him; and neveris the
food thus furnished made a matter of trafﬁc.

3. The life of the Indian, when at home in his village, is
a life of indolence and amusement. To the woman is con-
signed the labors of the household and the ﬁeld; she ar-
ranges the lodge; brings wood for the ﬁre; cooks; jerks

, venison and buffalo meat; dresses the skins of “the animals

killed in the chase, and cultivates the little patch-of maize,
pumpkins, and pulse, which furnishes a great part of their
pl'OVlSl0I1S. .

4. Their time for repose and recreation is at sunset, when,
the labors of the day being ended, they gather together to
amuse themselves with petty games, or to hold gossiping con-
vocations on the tops of their lodges. ,

5. As to the Indian, he is a game animal, not to be de-
graded by useful or menial toil. It is enough that he ex-
poses himself to the hardships of the chase, and the perils of
war; that he brings home food for his family, and watches
and ﬁghts for its protection. Everything else is beneath his
attention. ' ‘ _

6. When at home, he attends only to his weapons and his

‘horses, preparing the means of future exploit. Or he en-

gages with his comrades in games of dexterity, agility, and
strength; or in games of chance, in which everything is put
at hazard, with a recklessness seldom witnessed in civilized
life. A

at home, is passed in squatting together in groups on the bank
of a river, on the top of a mound on the prairie, or on the
roof of one of their earth-covered lodges; talking over the
news of the day, the affairs of the tribe, the events and
exploits of their last hunting or ﬁghting expedition; or list-
ening to the stories of old times, told by some veteran chroni-
cler ; resembling aigroup of ourvillage quidriuncs and pol-

iticians, listening to the.prosing of some superannuated ora-
cle, or discussing the contents of an ancient newspaper.

8. As to the Indian women, they are far from complain-
ing of their lot. On the contrary, they would despise their
husbands, could they stoop to any menial office, and would
think it conveyed an imputation upon their own conduct.
It is the worst insult one Virago can cast upon another in a
moment of altercation. “ Infamous woman ! ” will she
cry, “ I have seen your husband carrying wood into his
lodge to make the ﬁre. Where was his squaw, that he
should be obliged to make a woman of himself? ”

Note. The expression in verse 5, that the Indian is “ a game animal,”
means, that, as an animal pursued as game may be thought above the tame
and useful brutes, so the Indian is above the drudgery of common life.

LESSON XLIII. The Barber.

1. EVER since reading the Arabian Nights, I have had a
warming of the heart. towards a barber, and the sentiment
has increased both by subsequent reading and observation.
Whenever I came across one in a book, I depended upon
getting many a good laugh out of him, and I was seldom
disappointed.

2. Authors, all over the world, agree in the views they
take of their characters. They are always described as
jovial, light-hearted fellows, full to the brim of fun and
frolic, running over with animal spirits, their tongues wag-
ging the live-longday, and only stopping long enough to
laugh. « Care makes many a clutch at them, but they al-
ways contrive to -slip through his ﬁngers. '

THE BARBER. 95

3. Poverty comes in at their door, but cheerfulness does
not ﬂy out of the ‘window. Old age lays his frosty ﬁnger
upon their brows, and they laugh in the gray-beard’s face.
A surly, malicious, or even reserved barber would shock
our notions of propriety as much as a good-natured Saracen,
or a benevolent Ogre.

4. I grew up in a little village, and gathered my ideas of
a barber from books; he was to me a Platonic idea, a beau-
tifulvision, an‘ entity, a shadow; and when I came tothe
city and saw a real painted pole, I took off my hat to it with
an involuntary impulse of respect; and as to the day on
Which, for the ﬁrst time,’ I was professionally taken by the
nose, I esteem it one of the whitest of my life.

5. The barber,in truth, deserves all the kind treatment
he has received from the hands of men of letters. He is the
essence of good-nature. He has a pleasant look with his

-eye, and he could not frown if he would. His wit is often

as sharp as his own razor, but, like that, it never draws
blood; it never shows itself in gibes, taunts, and thrusts.
Perhaps some crusty old bachelor, that prides himself upon
shaving with cold water every morning, may think this a
piece of especial humbug; if so, we have reasons for our
faith as plenty as blackberries.

6'. In the ﬁrst place, no one would choose the profession

' that was not a man of peace, full of the milk of human i

kindness. Only think of the temptations that beset him;
twenty or thirty necks laidibare to him every day of his
life, with full permission to pass a sharp razor, within a hair’s
breadth of the carotid, artery; who, that had a large organ
of destructiveness, could refrain from occasionally slitting a
wind-pipe, when the wind was east, or his breakfast not Well

digested’! “ Think of that, Master Brook.”

7. In the second place, his native goodness of heart is
fostered by the circumstances in which he is placed. He
takes sunny views of life, and sees men in the best mood.
No one enters his shop without having a mellow glow of
satisfaction steal over his soul. 4

8. In summer it is cooler, and in Winter warmer, than the
street, so that the ﬁrst sensation is a highly pleasurable one.
And whoever goes to get rid of a beard, or of an uncomfore
table and unbecoming length of hair, feels happy in his
errand. It diffuses a smiling look over his face, far unlike

the frowning brow and compressed lip of the poor fellow,
that creeps to the dentist to have a tooth pulled, or to a law-
yer to be helped out of a scrape. He takes off his coat and
cravat with an expression of relief, at being free from their
tight grasp. He throws himself down into the chair with an
emphasis not to be mistaken, and, taking a long breath,
wafts away with it all ‘his. anxieties and cares.

9. The “tonsorial artist” now approaches; he handles
his collar and neck as tenderly as a mother would a new-
born infant; he begins to lather him; there is a magic in
the touch of the brush; it thrills to the marrow. Now he

. sees and feels the sharp steel playing around his chin, and

every cut takes off a weight from his spirits. It is ﬁnished ;
he arises a new man ; he feels clean and smooth, and pure
in heart; he will assent to a paradox ; laugh at an old story,
and say a sincere amen to a prayer for his enemies. Happy

LESSON XLIV. The Dear-lbought Victory.

1. WITHIN a balcony of state,
At ease, and happy beyond measure,
A monkey, sat, who had of late,
Become the master of a treasure.

2. Though not, indeed, of gems or -gold,
(Mark! I relate it to the letter,)
But fresh, sweet nuts, which, I ’ll be bold, a
Friend Pug esteemed as something better.

3. These in a sack he tied withcare,
For other monkeys, by the dozen,

DEAR BOUGHT VICTORY.

Came ﬂocking round, in hopes to share
The rich possessions of their cousin.

. They thronged beneath, in greedy train,

The balcony, where he was seated ;
But quickly found, ’t was allin vain
They reasoned, menaced, or entreated.

. For Pug, however rich in fruit,

Appeared’: in bounty greatly lacking,
And ﬂung, in answer to their suit,

The shells of nuts, which he ’d been cracking.

. At this the suppliants, ﬁlled with rage,

Resolved to sue to him no longer; _
But battle now prepared to wage,
As they in numbers were the stronger.

. The monkey, on this rude attack,

Although hethought the means expensive,
Without ado, untied his sack,
And turned his nuts to arms offensive.

. Pug, with the missives, aimed his blows

So hard and fast, that, in conclusion,
His smarting and be-pelted foes
Fled off, in cowardly confusion.

. At length he proudly stood alone,

With feelings that of rapture savored,
Prepared to thank, in joyous tone,
Dame Fortune, who his cause had, favored;

That he had" from the ﬁerce attack

His precious nuts so well defended,_
But cast his eyes upon his sack,

And saw that they were allexpended!

Through these he had maintained’ his place ;.-
And’, now his foes had all retreated,
He stood precisely in the case
As if himself had been defeated.
