PREFACE.

»&u 

HE systematic study of English Literature, as part of the course of
ordinary English education, has been introduced almost entirely within
the last thirty yea.rs.

The reader who will take the trouble to look over the old catalogues of
our Colleges and Schools, will ﬁnd no Vestige of such a study prior to
1844. The Class Book of Poetry and the Class Book of Prose, issued in
1844, by the author of the present Volume, were a feeble beginning in this
line. Though intended primarily for reading-books, they were to some
extent studies in literature. The selections from the Various authors were in
each case preﬁxed by a brief critical and biographical notice of the author,
and were arranged in chronological order, so as to furnish the teacher and
the scholar with something like an outline of the general course of English
Literature.

In the works of Prof. Cleveland which followed, a few years later (1848-
1858), this feature became more marked. The books were still in the main
reading-books, but the space allotted to literary history and criticism was
considerably enlarged.

Other works have followed, from time to time, approaching more and
more to the character of a simple text-book on the subject, until now,
when selections are for the most part remanded to the readingabook, and
the text—book is occupied almost exclusively with criticism and literary
history.

P Any one who will compare the Class Books of Poetry and Prose of 1844,
already referred to, with the present volumes on English and American
Literature, by the same author, will have a means of measuring the growth

of this study in a single generation. A comparison of the School cata-
vii

viii PREFACE.

logues of 184.4. and 1872 will show a like result. Hardly a school of any
standing is now to be found that does not include the systematic study of
English Literature in its ordinary curriculum. The study has come to be
considered almost as necessary as that of Grammar and Geography, and
fully as necessary as that of History. The study of Literature is in fact a
part of the study of History. , L

The latest step in this onward movement is that which recognizes the
propriety of giving a full and adequate treatment to the literature of our
own country. The volume now in the hands of the reader furnishes ample
proof, if any were needed, that American Literature is abundant in mate-
rials, and that it is growing with unexampled rapidity.

In preparing this work the author has been indebted, at every step, to
those who have gone before him. No one ca.n write intelligently on the
subject, without a feeling of thankfulness for the labors of Dr. Allibone,
Dr. Griswold, and the brothers Duyckinck. Besides these general sources
of information, the author acknowledges with pleasure his obligations to
“ Southland Writers,” by Mrs. Mary T. Tardy (“ Ida Raymond ”) of Mobile,
Ala., and to “Living Writers of the South,” by Prof. James Wood David-
son of Washington. A

The work, however, is not a mere compilation. It is not only original in
its conception, form, and structure, but it has, in its materials also, to a
much greater extent than is usual in such works, the character of origi-
nality. Fully one-third of the matter here presented has been gathered by
the author himself, and is an original contribution to the subject of which

he has undertaken to treat.

To TEACHERS,

—-3»<.\\;<3‘,'E£&V,a~/~

HE author of these volumes, on English and American Literature,
ventures to make‘ a suggestion as to the method of using them as
text-books.

It is obvious, on a bare inspection of the pages, or of the table of Con-
tents, that much of the matter here contained is not mea.nt to be studied for
the purpose of recitation. Such a use of the books would be to mistake
entirely the design of the author, and to Waste unwarrantably the time of
the scholar. It is important, indeed, that the scholar should have by him,
in cheap and convenient ‘form for reference, information, so far as practi-
cable, in regard to all those Writers Who have contributed in any C0nsid«
enable degree to the body of our literature, and to have this information
properly classiﬁed and brought together under suitable heads. Besides
the convenience of having these details in this form for reference, there
is another consideration not to be overlooked. The mere inspection
of the authors thus epitomized and classiﬁed,,gives the student general

ideas which he can get in no other Way, in regard both to the magnitude

.and comprehensiveness of the subject as a whole, and to the proportions

and relations of the several parts. But it by no means follows that all
these minutiae are to be regularly studied. .

A proper use of either ‘of these books in the classuroom Would include
attention to the following particulars:

1. Study carefully the Introductions of the several Chapters, including
the subdivisions into ections.

2. Study carefully, in full, one leading author, in each Chapter or Sec-

tion, either taking the author who is named in the book as standing at the

head of that Section, or selecting some other, at the discretion of the

I teacher.

3. In connection with this exhaustive study of one author in each Sec-
tion, learn the portion in coarse print in regard to the other associated
authors in that Section.

4. Name merely, Without giving any other particulars, some of those
authors Who are presented in ﬁne print. How many of these minor authors
should be named, must be left to the judgment of the teacher. The better
Way is to require only a few, and leave the selection to each student.

By observing these four conditions, the teach er may take a class intelli-=
gently and proﬁtably through the entire book, in the shortest time allotted
to the study in any school that makes a pretence of studying thesubject
at all.

Having given this general survey of the Whole subject, if more time is
allowed, the process may be repeated, again and again, taking each time
one additional author in each Section for special study, and a few additional
minor authors for mere’ mention.

Scholars, while passing through the book, ‘should be advised and encour-
aged to read all the matter in its connection. Curiosity of itself will lead
them in many cases to read about authors in Whom they are interested.
But in no case is it deemed advisable that a larger amount than that

already indicated should be required for recitation.

AMERICAN LITERATURE.

————oO,5©5_O-0—-—-

CHAPTER I.

THE EARLY COLONIAL PERIOD.

AMERICAN LITERATURE, strictly speaking, is that part of

English Literature which has been produced upon American soil.

N0te.—A Literature is denominated from the language in which it is Written. As Latin
Literature is that written in the Latin language, and Greek Literature is that written in
Greek, so English Literature is that written in the English language. It includes works
written by Americans, as well as those written by Englishmen. It includes the works of
foreigners even, provided those works are written in the English tongue. For convenience
of treatment, however. the subject is divided into two parts. The works in English written
in England l1ave been considered in a separate volume, under the title of English Literature;
those works in English written in the United States are now to be considered, under the
title of American Literature. _

American Literature dates from the ﬁrst settlement of the
American Colonies.

Nearly all the leaders in these enterprises were men of education, gradu-
ates of the English Universities." They came to the New VVorld quite as
much in defence of opinions as in quest of fortune. The pen and the print-
ing—press shared from the ﬁrst with the musket, the axe, and the plough, in
the work which the early American colonists set before them.

The ﬁrst period of this literature is distinctly marked. It includes all
that was produced in the Colonies down to the time when the political fer-
ment began Which ended in the separation from the mother country.

26 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

The works of this period. though from the ﬁrst racy of the soil, are yet not so distinctly
American as those produced afterwards. Those early colonists were still Englishmen at heart,
and most of what they wrote saw the light ﬁrst in England. The types, the printing-presses,
the paper were still mostly there; the audience to which they appealed was quite as much
English as American. A

The ﬁrst Works in English written on American soil came from
Virginia.
Whitaker’s Good Newes.

Good Newes from Virginia, published in 1613, was the Work of Alexander
VVhitaker, one of the settlers of the town of Henrico, on the James River.

Whitaker was of good English family, his father being the distinguished theologian, Dr.
William Whitaker, Master of St. John’s College, Cambridge. Young Whitaker came to
America in a truly missionary spirit, and engaged earnestly in. his vocation as a Christian
minister. It was he who baptized Pocahontas, and who also married her to Rolfe.

The exact title of Whitaker’s work was “ Good N ewes from Virginia, Sent to the Council
and Company of Virginia resident in England.” The dedication by W. Crashawe ‘contains
the following eulogium upon the author: “ I hereby let all men know that a scholar, a grad-
uate, a preacher, well born and friended in England; not in debt nor disgrace, but compe-
tently provided for, and liked and beloved where he lived; not in want, but (for a scholar
as these days be) rich in possession, and more in possibility; of himself, without any persua-
sion (but God’s and his own heart), did voluntarily leave his warm nest; and to the wonder
of his kindred and amazement of those who knew him, undertook this hard, but, in my
judgment, heroical resolution to go to Virginia, and help to bear the name of God unto the
Gentiles.”

WILLIAM STRACHEY, the ﬁrst Secretary of the Virginia Colony, wrote a work called History
of Travaile into Virginia Britannia. It is not certain, however, that this work was written in
America, though sometimes so credited. Strachey resided in the colony three years, 1610-
1612, and then returned to England. The earliest date assigned to his work is 1618.

Sandys’s Ovid.

The ﬁrst purely literary work produced on American soil was the Trans-
lation of Ovid’ s Metamorphoses, by George Sandys, in 1621. Sandys Was,
at the time, Treasurer to the Virginia~Colony, and the Work referred to was
penned on the banks of the James River.

Though written in America, this work was printed in London, being issued there in folio,
with a dedication to King Charles I. In the dedication, Sandys apologizes for any want of
scholarly ﬁnish in his poetry by referring to the rude and unsettled kind of life in which
his verses had been produced. He tells the king that the poem “had been limned by that

imperfect light which was snatched from the hours of night and repose. For the day was.

not his 0w.n, but dedicated to the service of his father and himself; and had that service
proved as fortunate, as it was faithful in him, as well as [in] others more worthy, they had
hoped, before the revolution of many years, to have presented his Majesty with a rich and
well-peopled kingdom. B11t as things had turned, he had only been able to bring from thence
himself and that composition, which needed more than a single denization. For it was
doubly a stranger, being sprung from an ancient Roman stock, and bred up in the New
World, of the rudeness whereof it could not but participate; especially as it was produced
among wars and tumults, instead of under the kindly and peaceful inﬂuence of the muses.”

THE, EARLY COLONIAL PERIOD. 27

For further particulars in regard to Sandys, see “English Literature,” p. 107.

Sandys’s poem was held in high respect by Dryden and Pope. Dryden pronounced him the
best versiﬁer of his age. A few lines from the description of the Golden Age are quoted as
“ a pleasing memorial of this classic theme, pursued amidst the perils and trials of the early
colonial settlement.”— Dug/clcinclc.

. In ﬁrm content
And harmless ease their days were spent,
The yet-free Earth did of her own accord
(Untorn with ploughs) all sorts of fruit afford.
Con tent with nature’s unenforced food,
They gather wildings, strawb’ries of the wood,
Some cornels, what upon the bramble grows,
And acorns which J ove’s spreading oak bestows.
‘T was always Spring; warm Zephyrs sweetly blew
On smiling ﬂowers, which without setting grew.
Forthwith the earth corn unmanured bears;
And every year renews her golden ears:
With milk and nectar were the rivers ﬁlled;
And yellow honey from green elms distilled.

Vaughan’s Golden Fleece.

Another Work‘ written about the same time, but in a remote northeastern
settlement, was The Golden Fleece, by Sir VVi1liam Vaughan.

The Golden Fleece was a small quarto, partly in prose and partly in verse, humorous and
satirical, intended to set forth the general degeneracy of manners in England and the ad.
vantages of emigrating to America.

The Golden Fleece was written at Cambrioll, the author’s plantation in the southern
part of Newfoundland, and was sent to London for publication, with a view of inducing
other settlers to join him. The author himself‘ was a native of Wales, a physician and a
poet, who had emigrated to America and had purchased a tract of land in Newfoundland.
He signs himself Orpheus, Jr. The work is a curious specimen of Puritan thought mixed
up with the old classic machin‘ery of Apollo and the Muses. Parts of it are an irreverent
parody of the litany, put into the mouth of Florio, a pedantic Italian then much in vogue
in London. The following specimen will give some idea of the author’s manner in this part

of his work:
From blaspheming of God’s name.

From recanting words with shame,
From damnation eternal,

From a rich soul internal,

From a sinner will not mend,
From a friend that will not lend,

From such sins as do delight us,
As from dreams that do aifright us,
From parasites that stroke us,
From morsels that will choke us,
From false sycophants that soothe us,
As from those in sin do smooth us,
From all profane discourses,
From all ungodly courses,
’ Sweet angel free
Deliver me.

28 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

The full title of this work is as follows: “The Golden Fleece, divided into three parts,
under which are discovered the errors of religion, the vices and decay of the kingdom, and,
lastly, the way to get wealth and to restore trading, so much complained of. Transported from
Cambrioll Colchos, out of the southernmost part of this Island, commonly called The New
Found Land, by.Orphe.us Junior, for the general and perpetual good of Great Britain. 1626.”

Vaughan was the author of several other works, written in England.

Mo1°ell’s Nova Anglia.
Another literary production of this early period was a poem by Rev.
VVillia1n Morell, entitled Nova. Anglia, or New England.

The Nova Anglia was composed in Latin hexameters, and afterwards translated by the
author into English heroics. It is occupied mainly with a description of the aborigines and

of the animals of the country. The author came to America in 1623, and after spending a

year in Plymouth, returned to England. The poem was published in England after his return.
It is not clear whether the poem was written in America or in England.

VVood’s New England’s Prospect.

New England’s Prospect was the title of a descriptive Work by William
Wood, and was printed in London in 1684.

Wood was a resident of the Plymouth Colony. After spending four years there, he went
to London and published the work just named. The full title is : “ N EW ENeLAND’s PROSPECT;
a true, lively, and experimental description of that part of America commonly called New
EnglaI1d——discovering the state of that country, both as it stands to our new-come English
planters, and to the old native inhabitants —-laying down that which may both enrich the
knowledge of the mind-travelling reader, or beneﬁt the future voyager. By William Wood,
London, 1634.” In his preface, he says, “I have laid down the nature of the country

. without any partial respect unto it, as being my dwelling-place, where I have lived these

four years, and intend, God willing, to return shortly again.”

The work is written in a cheerful strain, and some parts of it are in verse, in the common
heroic couplet. The author’s poetry, though giving frequent reminders of his English birth
and training, has an unmistakable American ﬂavor. In the lines quoted below, the imita-
tion of Spenser is too obvious to escape notice, and yet no one could have written the de-
scription who was not personally familiar with the American forest-trees:

Trees, both in hills and plains, in plenty be’,

The long—liv’d oak, and mournful oypris tree,
Sky-tow’ring pines, and chesnuts coated rough,

The lasting cedar, with the walnut tough:

The rosin-dropping ﬁr, for masts in use,

The boatmen seek for oares light, neat, growne sprewse,
The brittle ash, the ever-trembling aspes,

The ,broad-spread elm, whose concave harbours wasps,
The water-spungie alder, good for nought,

Small elderne, by the Indian ﬂetchers * sought,

The knottie maples, pallid birch, hawthornes,

The horne-bound tree that to be cloven scorncs ;
W’hich from the tender vine oft takes his spouse,
‘Who twines embracing arms about his boughs.

* Makers of bows and arrows.

"THE EARLY COLONIAL PERIOD. 29

Mr. Wood, after returning to Massacliusetts, represented the town of Lynn in the General
Court in 1636; he was the principal founder and _tl1e Town Clerk of Sandwich, in the Ply-
mouth Colony, in 1637 ; and he died there in 1639.

The First Printing—Press.——The ﬁrst printing-press in America was at
Harvard College, Cambridge,Massachusetts. It was set up in the Presi-
dent’s house, in 1639.

The First Printed Book. -— The ﬁrst book printed was the celebrated Bay
Psalm Book, Cambridge, 1640.

Note.—Some small pamphlets had appeared before, as the Freeman’s Oath, and an
Almanac, but the Bay Psalm Book was the first book issued.

The Bay Psalm Book. —— Before coming to New England the colonists had been
accustomed to use the version by Sternhold and Hopkins, and that by Henry Ainsworth.
(See English Literature, pp. 132, 184.) Ainsworth’s Book of.Psalms was published in Am-

sterdam in 1612. The Puritans brought it with them to New England. But neither this‘

version nor that of Sternliold and Hopkins was suiﬁciently literal to satisfy the scruples of
the colonists. They had doubts, not only whether anything should be sung in public wor-
ship except the very words of Scripture, but also whether any one except “church mem-
bers ” should join inthe service, it being an’act of religion. Even of the church members,
women were supposed by some to be excluded from the service, on the ground that it is
forbidden to a woman to speak in church. To meet these scruples, a number of the minis-
ters undertook the preparation of a new version, which accordingly was extremely literal,
and the Rev. John Cotton, of Boston, a man of great inﬂuence and authority, published
a treatise, “The Singing of Psalms a Gospel Ordinance,” to show the propriety of this part
of public worship. ‘

The men who were chieﬂy engaged in preparing the new version were the Rev. Richard
Mather, of Dorchester, the progenitor of a race of great scholars, and himself a scholar and
a leading man in the colony; the Rev. John Eliot, of Roxbury, of world-wide celebrity as
the “apostle to the Indians; ” and the Rev. Thomas Welde, also of Roxbury, and a man of
inﬂuence and standing. They were selected with reference, evidently, to their authority in
church matters and their reputation as theologians, rather than for their poetical abilities.
Under some apprehension, apparently, that the work might be found wanting in its literary
character, the Rev. Thomas Shepard, a brilliant preacher of Cambridge, addressed them a.
note of warning in the following signiﬁcant rhymes:

You Roxbury poets, keep clear of the crime

Of missing to give us a very good rhyme,

And you of Dorchester your verses lengthen,

And with the text’s own Word your verses strengthen.

The work was begun in 1639, and was completed and published in 1640, with the follow»
ing title: “ The Whole Book of Psalms, faithfully translated into English Metre. Where-
unto is preﬁxed a Discourse declaring not only the Lawfulness, but also the Necessity of the
Heavenly Ordinance of singing Scripture Psalms in the Churches of God.”

It being found ‘necessary to employ “a little more art” upon the work, it was committed
a few years later to the Rev. Henry Dunster, the _ﬁrst President of Harvard College, to be
revised. Thus revised, the book found its way into general use. It was adopted and used
almost exclusively in all the New England colonies, down to the period of the Revolution.
Twenty-seven editions of it had been printed before 1750. It was also reprinted several
times in England and Scotland, in both of which countries it was much used in dissent-
ing congregations.

The following specimen is from Dunster’s revision:

PSALM CXXXVII.

The rivers on of Babilon,
There when wee did sit downe,

Yea, even then, wee mourned when
Wee remembered Sion.

Our harp wee did hang it amid,
Upon the willow tree,

Because there they that us away

Requir’d of us a song, and thus
Askt mirth us waste who laid,

Sing us among a Sion’s song,
Unto us then they said.

The Lord’s song sing, can wee, being
In stranger’s land? then let

Lose her skill my right hand if I
Jerusalem forget.

Let cleave my tongue my pallate on
If mind thee doe not I,

If chiefe joyes o’er I prize not more

Remember, Lord, Edom’s sons’ word ;
Unto the ground, said they,

It rase, it rase, when as it Was
Jerusalem her day.

Blest shall he be that payeth thee,
Daughter of Babilon,

Who must be waste, that which thou hast
Rewarded us upon.

0 happie hee shall surely bee
That taketh up, that eke

Thy little ones against the stones

Nathaniel Ward.

NATHANIEL WARD, 1570-1653, acquired considerable notoriety, both in
the Colonies and in England, by a Work called The Simple Cobler of Agawam.

Ward was born and educated in England, and was one of those clergymen who were
silenced by Laud for non—conformity. He thereupon emigrated to Massachusetts, and in
1634 became pastor of Ipswich, or Agawam, as it was then called. He returned to England
in 1645, and remained there until his death. While in Massachusetts he published the piece
already, named, which was written in a very conceited, pedantic style, but contains some
home thrusts at the way in which colonial matters were managed. The full title of the
piece is: “The Simple Cobler of Agawam, in America, Willing to help Mend his Native
Country, lamentably tattered, both in the Upper-leather and the Sole, with all the honest

.THE EARLY COLONIAL PERIOD.- 31

stitches he can take,” etc. After returning to England, he wrote another piece of a similar
kind, Mercurius Anti-Mechanicus, or The Simple Cobler’s Boy with his Lap-full of Caveats,
etc. ,

Ward, though a preacher, was originally bred to the law, had travelled considerably, and
was well versed in political affairs. He prepared the ﬁrst code of laws established in
New England, that, namely, which was adopted in 1641, and which was called The Body of
Liberties.

Ward was an inveterate punster, and remarkable for his coinage of new words. A few
extracts are given in illustration of his peculiarities:

“ Many men, woodcock—like, live by their long bills.”

“ Too much diet-bread will bring a man to a diet-drink ; mack—roones will make room for
(no good) luxury. Marmalade may mar my lady, me it shall not. March pane shall not be
my arch-bane.”

“ It is a most toilsome task to run the wi1d—goose chase after a well-breath’d opinionist;
they delight in vitiliﬁcation: it is an itch that loves a life to be scrub’d; they desire not
satisfaction, but satisdiction, whereof themselves must be judges.”

“I honour the woman that can honour herself with her attire: a good text always de-
serves a fair margent: I am not much offended if I see a trim far trimmer than. she that
wears it: in a word, whatever Christianity or civility will allow, I can afford with London
measure; but when I hear a nugiperous gentledame inquire what dress the Queen is in
this week ; what the nudiustertian fashion~ of the Court, I mean the very newest ; with egg
to be in it in all haste, whatever it be; I look at her as the very gizzard of a triﬂe, the pro-
duct of a quarter of a cypher, ﬁtter to be kickt, if she were of a kickable substance, than
either honour’d or humour’d.”

John Cotton.

REV. J01-IN COTTON, 1585-1652, is known by his Bloody Tenent I/Vashed,
in reply to Roger VVilliams, Milk for Babes, Meat for Strong Men, and sun-
dry other publications suited to the times.

Cotton was a native of Derby, in England, and a graduate of Cambridge. ‘He was a zeal-
ous Puritan, and a man of great and varied learning. He emigrated to America in 1633, and
settled in Boston, where he exercised his ministry until his death, in 1652. He had a sharp
controversy with Roger Williams, on the subject of the interference of the civil magistrate
in the support of religious truth, Cotton contending for such interference, and Williams pro-
testing against it. Pamphlets ﬂew thick and fast between them, that being the mode of
civil warfare in those days. He is known in the early colonial history as “the great Cotton.”
His learning, pastoral ﬁdelity, and general amiability of character gave him great and de-
served political inﬂuence in the young theocratic commonwealth. He was appointed by the
General Court, in 1636, to prepare a scheme of laws for the government of the colony. His
work, ‘made in pursuance of this appointment, and called An Abstract of the Laws of New
England, though printed, was not adopted, the General Court preferring the Body of Liber-
ties, prepared for the same purpose by Nathaniel Ward of Agawam, already noticed. Cot-
ton’s theocratical views of government were indeed of the strictest kind.

Among his other publications are the following: Set Forms of Prayer; Keys of the King-
dom of Heaven and the Power thereof, giving his views of church government; Meat for
Strong Men, containing his views of civil government; Milk for Babes, being a catechism
for instructing young children in the elements of Christian doctrine. The piece last named,
though small, was of great inﬂuence and importance. It was one of the documents which
composed the famous New England Primer, and as such was for many generations stored in
the memory of almost every New England child. A

32 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

The general New England custom of beginning the Sabbath on Saturday evening origi-
nated with Mr. Cotton. He published arguments, before leaving England, in favor of such
an observance, and his authority in Boston and throughout the colony was such that his
View of the matter obtained general acquiescence. Cotton Mather gives the following cl1ar-
acteristic anecdote of Mr. Cotton. “ At another time, when Mr. Cotton had modestly replied
unto one that would much talk and crack of his insight into The Revelation, ‘Brother, I
must confess myself to want light in those mysteries,’ the man went home and sent him a
pound of candles; upon which action this good man only bestowed asilent smile. He would
not set the beacon of his great soul on ﬁre at the landing of such a little cock-boat.”

Thomas Hooker.

REV. THOMAS HOOKER, 1586-1647, better known in his own day as
“Minister Hooker,” was another of the great lights of the early colonial
settlements in New England.

Hooker was a zealous Non-conformist preacher in London, and being silenced by Laud,
went to Delft, Holland, where he preached for some time to the English Puritans who had
taken refuge there. In 1633 he emigrated with a large number of others to New England,
and with his fellow—emigrants founded New Town, now Cambridge. A few years later, with
a part of his congregation, he went to Connecticut and settled Hartford, where he ended
his days. _

Hooker was an exceedingly zealous preacher, and a man of untiring energy, and he ex-
erted a controlling inﬂuence in the colony. Nearly one hundred of his sermons were pub-
lished after his death. His principal works are: A Survey of the Sum of Church Disci-
pline; The Soul’s Implantation; The Application of Redemption by the Effectual VVork of
the Word and Spirit of Christ, a small quarto of seven hundred pages, containing a system
of practical divinity; The Poor Doubting Christian drawn to Christ, of which the seventh
edition was published in Boston in 1743. I

Hooker, Cotton, and Stone, all ministers of note, came over in 1633, in the same ship, and
were the means of drawing many other colonists. “Such multitudes,” says Cotton Mather,
“ﬂocked over to New England after them that the plantation at N ewtown [Cambridge] be-
came too strait for them.” In another place, he speaks of “Mr. Cotton, Mr. Hooker,
and Mr. Stone, which glorious triumvirate coming together made the poor people in the

. wilderness, at their coming, to say, that the God of heaven had supplied them with what

would in some sort answer their then great necessities: Cotton for their clotIn'ng,_ Hooker for
their ﬁshing, and Stone for their building.”

Samuel Stone.

REV. SAMUEL SToNE,— 1663, was born at Hartford, England, and educated at Cambridge.
He came over in the same ship with Hooker and Cotton, and was associate pastor with
Hooker, ﬁrst at New Town or Cambridge, and then at Hartford. Mr. Stone published, A
Congregational Church is a Catholic Visible Church, and some other things, and left in man-
uscript A Confutation of the Antinomians, and A Body of Divinity. Bancroft the historian
says, “ We know of no cardinals of that day so worthy of reverence as Hooker and Stone.”

The following lines on the occasion of his death are worthy of note, both as a specimen
of the literature of the times, and as an evidence of the estimation in which Mr. Stone was

held. ,

THE EARLYOOLONIAL PERIOD. 33

A stone more than the Ebenezer fam’d;

‘Stone splendent diamond, right orient named;
A cordial stone, that often cheered hearts

VVith- pleasant wit, which Gospel rich imparts;
VVhetstone, that edgify’d th’ Obtusest mind;
Loadstone, that drew the iron heart unkind;

A pond’rous stone, that would the bottom sound
Of Scripture depths, and bring out Arcan’s found;
A stone for kingly David’s use to ﬁt,

As would not fail Goliah’s front to hit;

A stone, an antidote, that brake the course

Of gangrene errour, by convincing force;

A stone acute, ﬁt to divide and square;

A squared stone became Chri'st’s building rare.

John Norton.

REV. JOHN NORTON, 1606-1663, a colleague of VVard in the church at
Agawam or Ipswich, was the author of several works both in English and
Latin.

Norton was a graduate of the University of Cambridge, in England, and came to America
in 1635. When the churches in Zealand sent over to the clergy in New England, through
Apollonius, various questions on church government, Norton wrote a reply in Latin, which
gained him great applause. Fuller the church historian says of it: “ Of all the authors that
I have perused concerning the opinions of those Dissenting Brethren, none to me was more
informative than Mr. John Norton (one of no less learning than modesty), minister in New
England,_ in his answer to Apollonius.” -

Ofhis English works, the best known is his Life of John Cotton. The titles of some of
his other works are: The Doctrine of Godliness; The Sufferings of Christ; The Orthodox
Evangelist; ‘The Heart of New England Rent (about the Tuckers), etc. He also left in
manuscript A Body of Divinity.

Thomas Shepard.

REV. THOMAS SHEPARD, 1605-1649, was one of the shining lights Of
the Massachusetts'Colony. His best known Work is The Parable of the
Ten Virgins Opened.

Mr. Shepard was educated at Cambridge,-and took orders in the Church of England, but
being silenced by Laud for non-conformity, emigrated to Boston, Mass., in 1635, and suc-
ceeded Rev. Thomas Hooker as pastor at New Town, now Cambridge, where he remained
until death. He was in high repute in the colony for his learning and piety. His Works,
and a Memoir of his life, were published in Boston, in 1853, in 3 vols. The following are
the titles of some of his treatises: New England’s Lamentation for Old England’s Errors;
Seine Secret Cases Resolved; The Clear Sunshine of the Gospel Breaking forth upon the
Indians of New England; Parable" of the Ten Virgins Opened and Applied; Liturgical
Considerator Considered; First Principles of the Oracles of God, etc. “Various testimonials
have been tendered, on both sides of the Atlantic, to Mr. Shepard’s excellence as a writer.
President Edwards’s estimate of him in this respect may be gathered from the fact that out
of one hundred and thirty-two quotations which he makes from various authors, in his
Work on the'A1fections, more than seventy—ﬁve are from Mr. Sliepard."-—-Sp7'aguo’s
Annals. _

34 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Governor Winthrop.

JOHN WINTHROP, 1588-1649, the ﬁrst Governor of Massachusetts, found
time amid the exacting cares of office to make some valuable contribu-
tions to the literature of his period.

Winthrop was chosen as leader of the Massachusetts colonists before they left England.
N 0 one man probably did more towards strengthening and moulding and giving character to
the infant colony. He was of good family, son of Adam Winthrop, a lawyer of some dis-
tinction, and was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was the author of two works :
A Model of Christian Charity, written on board the Arabella, on the Atlantic Ocean; and A
Journal of the Public Occurrences in the Massachusetts Colony. The latter, after lying a
long time in manuscript, has been carefully printed by Mr. James Savage, the antiquary,
w'ith- annotations, under the title of The History of New England, from 1630 to 1619. Its
value as an original historical document is extremely great. It is entitled to consideration
also for its literary merits.

“ For years, Winthrop, the leader of this ﬁrst great enterprise, was the chief magistrate
of this infant metropolis. His prudence guided its councils. His valor directed its strength.
His life and fortune were spent in ﬁxing its character or improving its destinies. A bolder
spirit never dwelt, a truer heart never beat, in any man. Had Boston, like Rome, a conse-
crated calendar, there is no name better entitled than that of Winthrop to be registered as
its patron saint.”——Presz'dent Quincy.

Governor Bradford.

VVILLIAM BRADFORD, 1590-1657, the second Governor of the Plymouth Colony, though not
having the advantage of a university education, as most of the colonial leaders had, was yet
not wanting in culture or in literary productiveness. He published nothing of any mo-
ment, but left some valuable manuscripts, which, after many narrow escapes from destruc-
tion,have at length been brought to light by the persevering vigilance of the Massachusetts
Historical Society, and have been printed. His chief work was A History of the Plymouth
Colony, from the formation of their church, in 1602, to 1647. Bradford was himself one of
the original band that came over in the Mayﬂower, in 1620, and on the death of Carver was
elected the second Governor. '

Thomas Morton.

THOMAS Monrron, 1646, published, in 1632, a book called The New
English Canaan, describing that country and its inhabitants.

 

This Morton, who signs himself “ of Clifford’s Inn, Gent,” was not in sympathy with the
l.’uritan notions, either 011 social or on religious questions. He was a free liver, a lover of
sports and public carousals. In company with a set of roistering fellows like himself,
he established a settlement, at Mount Wollaston, which he named “Ma-re Mount.” There
they set up a May-pole, brewed a barrel of beer, besides obtaining a case of other liquors,
and had a grand carouse, with singing of songs and other revels. Morton was arrested for
these scandalous proceedings, and sent out of the colony, but returned, and persisted for
many years in his irregularities, to the great annoyance of the other colonists, who regarded
him as a “ troubler of Israel.” His book is written with decided ability, and has many ﬁne
touches of humor. An extract is given:

“The inhabitants of Pasonagessit (having translated the name of their habitation from
that ancient savage name to Ma—re Mount; and having resolved to have the name conﬁrmed

'.l‘H.E EARLY COLONIAL PERIOD. 35

for a memorial to after ages), did devise amongst themselves to have it performed in a sol-
emn manner with Revels, and merriment after the old English custom, and prepared to set up

a May—pole upon the festival day of Philip and Jacob ; and therefore brewed a barrel of eXcel- '

lent beer, and provided a case of bottles to be spent, with other good cheer, for all comers
to that day. And because they would have it in a complete form, they had prepared a song
ﬁtting to the time and present occasion. And upon May-day they brought the May-pole to
the place appointed, with drums, guns, pistols, and other ﬁtting instruments, for that pur-
pose; and there erected it with the help of savages, that came thither of purpose to see the
manner of our Revels. A goodly pine-tree of 80 feet long, was reared up, with a pair of
buck-horns nailed on, somewhat near the top of it; where it stood as a fair sea-mark for di-
rections, how to ﬁnd out the way to mine Host of l\Ia—re Mount . . . . . . . . . .

‘-‘ There was likewise a merry song made, which (to make their Revels more fashionable) was
sung with a corus, every man bearing his part; which they performed in a dance, hand in
hand about the May-pole, whiles one of the company sung, and ﬁlled out the good liquor
like Gammedes and Jupiter.

THE SONG.

Drink and be merry, merry, merry boys,
Let all your delight be in Hyn1en’s joys,
If to Hymen now the day is come,
About the merry May-pole take a roome.
Make green garlons, bring bottles out;
And ﬁll sweet nectar freely about.
Uncover thy head, and fear no harm,
For here ’s good liquor to keep it warm.

“This harmless mirth made, by young men (that lived in hope to have wives brought over
to them, that would save them a labour to make a voyage to fetch any over) was much dis-
tasted of the precise Separatists; that keep much ado, about the tithe of mint and cummin,
troubling their brains more than reason would require about things that are indifferent;
and from that time sought occasion against my honest Host of Ma-re Mount to overthrow his
undertakings, and to destroy his plantation quite and clear.”

Nathaniel ‘Morton.

NATHANIEL MORTON, 1612-1685, Clerk of the Colonial Court of Ply-
mouth, made a valuable contribution to the literature of the period by his
New England’ s Memorial.

Morton with the rest of his father’s family emigrated to America and settled in Plymouth
in 1623. He was Clerk of the Colonial Court from 16i5 to his death in 1685. His work was
the ﬁrst regular history, that was published, of the New England’ Colonies. It was in the
form of annals, beginning with the departure of the Pilgrims from England, and coming
down to the date of its publication, 1669. Much of the materials was drawn from Governor
Bradford’s manuscript, already described. The full title of his book is: “New England‘s
lllelnorial; or, a brief Relation of the most memorable and remarkable Passages of the Provi-
dence of God, manifested to the Planters of New England in America; with special reference
to the First Colony thereof, called New Plymouth, published for the use and beneﬁt. of pres-
ent and future generations.” The work is one of extreme value 011 historical grounds, and
is not wanting in literary merit. He gives, among other things, a minute narrative of the
irregular proceedings of that “lord of misrule,” Thomas Morton, already noticed. A short
extract is given:

“After this, they fell to great licentiousness of life, in all profaneness ; and the said Morton
became lord of misrule, and maintained, as it were, a school of atheism; and after they had
got some goods into their hands, and got much by trading with the Indians, they spent it

as vainly in quaﬁing and drinking both wine and strong liquors in great excess, as some

have reported ten pounds within a morning, setting up a May-pole, drinking and dancing
about it, and frisking about it like so many fairies, or furies rather, yea, and worse prac-
tices, as if they had anew revived and celebrated the feast of the Roman goddess Flora, or
tl1e beastly practices of the mad Bacchanalians.” V

Governor Winslovv.

EDWARD WINSLOW, 1595-1655, who in 1633 succeeded Bradford as Grov-
ernor of the Plymouth Colony, Was the author of Good News from New
England and of several other publications, historical and controversial.

Governor Winslow was born in Worcestershire, and emigrated in the ﬁrst band of pilgrims
in 1620. ' Like most of the sturdy race of settlers to which he belonged, he could wield with
equal vigor the axe, the sword, or the pen. His publications are Hypocrisy Unmasked, a
true relation of the proceedings of the Governor and Company of Massachusetts against
Samuel Gorton; New England’s Salamander, a continuation of the sharp controversy begun
by “ Hypocrisy Unmasked ; ” Good News from New England, a true relation of things very
remarkable at the Plantation of Plymouth; The Glorious Progress of the Gospel amongst
the Indians in New England.

Roger Williams.

ROGER WILLIAMS, 1606-1683, famous as the apostle of civil and religious
liberty, and as the founder of a State established on that principle, is favor-
ably known also by his Writings, especially by his Bloody Tenent of Perse-
cution, and other pieces growing out of it, in his controversy With John
Cotton on that subject. '

Williams was a native of Wales. He was educated at Oxford, and was ordained as a min-
ister of the Church of England. In 1631 he emigrated to Massachusetts, in search of religious
liberty, and preached for a time at Salem, but was banished from the colony in 1635 on
account of his doctrines in regard to religious liberty. In 1636 he laid the foundations of the
city of Providence, in which men of all creeds might enjoy full religious liberty; and going
to England in 1613, he obtained a charter for the Province of Rhode Island, of which he was
himself afterwards President. He lived at peace with the Indians, and exerted a great and
beneﬁcial inﬂuence over them. I

The main feature of Roger Williams’s system was the doctrine that the State ought not
to punish for breaches of the ﬁrst table of the law. In this he was in advance of all his
contemporaries, being the ﬁrst bold advocate of entire and absolute toleration in matters of
religion. He wrote the following works: The Bloody Tenent of Persecution for Cause of
Conscience Dfgscussed; The I-Iireling Ministry None of Cl1rist’s; George Fox digged out of
his I3-urrowis, being an attack upon the Quakers; Letters from Roger VVilliams to John
Winthrop; Key into the Language of America, containing much curious information in
regard to the Indian languages, customs, etc.

“Roger Williams asserted the great doctrine of intellectual liberty. It became his glory
to found a State upon that principle, and to stamp himself upon its rising institutions in
characters so deep that the impress has remained to the present day, and can never be erased
without the total destruction of the work. He was the ﬁrst person in modern Christendom
to assert, in its plenitude, the doctrine of the liberty of conscience, the equality of opinions
before the law; and in its defence he was the harbinger of Milton, the precursor and supe-
rior of Jeremy Taylor,” — Bancroft.

THE EARLY COLONIAL PERIOD. 37

“ If ever a Welsh Fuller should write the Worthies of 1/Vales, Roger VVilliams will deserve,

If not the first place, a place among the ﬁrst; for he began the ﬁrst civil government upon t
— earth that gave equal liberty of conscience. His history belongs to America rather than

Engla.nd; but we must not even casually mention his name without an expression of respect
and reverence, for he was one of the best men who ever set foot upon the New World,-—— a
man of genius and of virtue, in whom enthusiasm took the happiest direction and produced
the best fruits.” —S0u.they, Lon. Qudr. Review.

J OHN CLARKE, 1609-1676, was a friend of Roger Williams, and one of the founders of Rhode
Island. Clarke was educated a physician, but after his settlement in New England, he be-
came a preacher, and the pas tor of the Baptist Church at Newport. Visiting his friends at
Lynn in 1651, and preaching there, he was arrested and imprisoned. His principal work

was Ill News from New England, published in London in 1652. It contains an account of

the discussion going on in the Colonies in regard to the question of toleration.

President Chauncy.

CHARLES CHAUNCY, 1589——l672, second President of Harvard College,
was a man of extensive literary and theological attainments, and of good
repute as a writer.

Chauncy was educated at the Westminster School, a11d at Trinity College, Cambridge. He
was a man of learning, and was for a time Professor of [lebrew and Greek in Cambridge, but
left England for the New ‘World on account of the persecutions under Laud. He was sixty
years old when appointed President. ' He published a volume on J ustiﬁcation; Antisynodalia,
against the proceedings of the Synod held in Boston, in 1662; and some occasional Sermons.

JOHN DAVENPORT, 1597-1670, the ﬁrst minister of New Haven, celebrated as a pulpit orator,
had some reputation also as an author. He published A Discourse about Civil Government
in a New Plantation, and The Saints’ Anchor Hold. Davenport was educated at Oxford.
Becoming a Non—conformist, he went in 1633 to Holland, where he preached for some years
to an English congregation. In 1637, he emigrated to Boston, and in 1638 was one of the
company that settled New Haven. He was minister of the church in New Haven for thirty
years, and was mainly instrumental in the passage of the rigid laws on church-membership
which prevailed in that colony. In 1661, he concealed the regicides, Whalley and Goffe, in
his own house, and when their pursuers were expected in New Haven, he preached from the
text, Isa. xvi. 3, 4, “Hide the outcasts ; bewray not him that wa.ndereth. Let mine outcasts
dwell with thee, Mo-ab‘; be thou a covert to them from the face of the spoiler.”

John E1iot,the Apostle to the Indians.
JOHN ELIOT, 1604-1690, distinctively known in colonial annals as The
Apostle to the Indians, has a place in literature by numerous religious
works Written in English, but chieﬂy by his translation of the Scriptures

into the Indian tongue.

There is no more beautiful picture in New England colonial history tha_n that of John
Eliot, the saintly apostle to the Indians. Eliot, like most of the Massachusetts leaders, was
educated at Cambridge. Before leaving England, he was for a time engaged as usher in a
classical school under Hooker, already noticed, who became so famous afterwards in the
annals of Connecticut. Eliot emigrated in 1631, and formed in Roxbury a settlement and
church consisting of persons to whom he had preached before leaving England. His labors

4

38 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

in behalf of the Indians were conducted in connection with his duties as pastor of the church
at Roxbury. He was ﬁrst led to take a special interest in the Indians from a belief that they
were the long lost Ten Tribes of Israel. IIe began preaching to the Indians in the neigh-
borhood as early as 1646, and with such good effect that several settlements of “praying
Indians ” were established, and the greatest hopes were entertained of converting and civil~
izing the entire body of the natives. But the outbreak of King Philip’s war interrupted
the good work, and brought it nearly to an end.

Eliot lived to the age of eighty-six, and continued his pious and self-denying labors to the
end. Among his latest efforts was an attempt to promote education among the negroes who
had been imported into the colony.

Eliot’s labors in behalf of the Indians led to the formation of the venerable Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel in New England, in the maintenance of which the Hon. Robert
Boyle took a prominent part. . .

Tl1e works which Eliot prepared in the Indian tongue, a dialect of the Mohegan, were an
Indian Grammar, and translations of The Bible, The Bay Psalm Book, two Catechisms (one
for children and one for adults), BaXter’s Call, The Sincere Convert, The Sacred Believer(two
tracts by Thomas Shepard), and The Practice of Piety.

E1iot’s works in English were, The Christian C ‘mmonwealth, a treatise on government,
framed for the Indian converts; The Communion of Churches; and The Harmony of the
Gospels. He was also one of the three ministers who prepared the Bay Psalm Book.

Eli_ot’s Indian Bible was printed in 1658-1663, on the press which had

been set up in the President’ s house at Cambridge in 1639, and was the ﬁrst

Bible printed in the New World.

Cotton Mather gives the following specimen of Eliot’s style of preaching. It is on the
text, “Our Conversation is in heaven :”

“Behold, said he, the ancient and excellent character of a true Christian ; ’tis that which
Peter calls ‘holiness in all manner of conversation,’ you shall not ﬁnd ;a Christian out of
the way of godly conversation. For, ﬁrst, a seventh part of our time is all spent in heaven,
when we are duly zealous for, and zealous on the Sabbath of God. Besides, God has written
on the head of the Sabbath, Remember, which looks both forwards and backwards, and thus
a good part of the week will be spent in. Sabbatizing. Well, but for the rest of our time!
Why, we shall have that spent in heaven, ere we shall have done. For, secondly, we have
many days for both fasting and thanksgiving in our pilgrimage; and here are so many Sab-
baths more. Moreover, thirdly, we have our lectures every week; and pious people won’t
miss them, if they can help it. Furthermore, fourthly, we have our private meetings,
wherein we pray, and sing, and repeat sermons, and confer together about the things of God;
and being now come thus far, we a.re in heaven almost every day- But a little further, ﬁfthly,
we perform family duties every day ; we have our morning and evening sacriﬁces, wherein
having read the Scriptures to our families, we call upon the name of God, and ever now and
then carefully catechize those that are under our charge. Sixthly, we shall also have our
daily devotions in our closets; wherein unto supplications before the Lord, we shall add some
serious meditation upon his word: a Daniel will be at this work no less than thrice a day.
Seventhly, we have likewise manyscores of ejaculations in a day; and these we have, like
Nehemiah, in whatever place we come into. Eighthly, we have our occasional thoughts and
our occasional talks upon spiritual matters; and we have our occasional acts of charity,
wherein we do like the inhabitants of heaven every day. Ninthly, in our calli11gs, i11 our
civil callings, we keep up heavenly frames ; we buy and sell, and toil, yea, we eat and drink,
with some eye both to the command and honor of God in all. Behold, I have not now left
an inch of time to be carnal ; it is all engrossed for heaven. And yet, lest there should not
be enough, lastly, we have our spiritual warfare. We are always encountering the enemies

of our souls, which continually raises our hearts unto our Helper and Leaderin the heavens.
Let no man say, ‘ ”l‘is impossible to live at this rate;’ for We have known some live thus;
and others that have written of such a life have but spun a web out of their own blessed
experiences. New England has examples of this lifegnthough, alas! ’tis to be lamented
that the distractions of the world, in too many professors, do becloud the beauty "of an
heavenly conversation. In ﬁne, our employment lies in heaven. In the morning, if we ask,
‘ Where am I to be to-day? ’ our souls must answer, ‘In heaven.’ In the evening, if we ask,
‘Where have I been to-day? ’ our souls may answer, ‘In heaven.’ If thou art a believer,
thou art no stranger to heaven while thou livest; and when thou diest, heaven will be no
strange place to thee; no, thou hast been there a thousand times.”

DANIEL GOOKIN, 1612-1687, wrote a valuable work, Historical Collections of the Indians in
New England. Gookin settled originally in Virginia, but ﬁnding himself more in sympathy
with the Puritans, he removed to Massachusetts, and settled in Cambridge. IIe held several
important civil oﬂﬁces, but is chieﬂy known by his services as Superintendent of all the In-
dians who acknowledged the authority of Massachusetts. He was in Warm sympathy with
Eliot in the movements for Christianizing the natives.

Richard Mather.

RICHARD MATHER, 1596-1669, eminent as a religious leader in the infant
settlement, published several controversial treatises, and was one of the three
ministers who prepared the famous Bay Psalm Book.

Mather studied at Oxford, and took orders in the Church of England. Being silenced for
Non-conformity, he emigrated to Massachusetts in 1635,and became pastor of the new church
at Dorchester. He was the father of the celebrated Increase Mather, and grandfather of the
still more celebrated Cotton Mather.

CAPTRROGER CLAP, 1609-1691, who emigrated in 1630, and settled in Dorchester, wrote an A

interesting volume of Memoirs. It was intended primarily for the beneﬁt of his children,
but has been found to'be of public value, and has been ﬁve times reprinted. It has consid-
erable literary merit, and being a record of events in which the Writer was himself an actor
and an eye-witness, has special historical value.

EDWARD JOHNSON, —— 1682, wrote a work called The Wonder Working Providence of
Sion’s Saviour, in New England, being a history of the country “from the English plant-
ing in the year 1628 until the year 1652.” Johnson was one of the emigrants who came over
with Gov. Winthrop in 1630. He was a prominent man in the settlement of the town and
church of VVoburn. Johnson begins his book in the following pithy style: “Good Reader:

As large gates to small ediﬁces, so are long prefaces to little books; therefore I will brieﬂy .

inform thee that here thou shalt ﬁnd the time when, the manner how, the cause why, and the
great success which it hath pleased the Lord to give to this handful of his praising saints in
New Englanc .”

VVILLIAM HUBBARD, 1621-1704, a member of the first graduating class
of Harvard, 1642, Wrote A Narrative of the Troubles with the Indians, and
A History of New England.

Mr. Hubbard was minister of the church at Ipswich. The “Narrative ” and several Ser-
mons were published during his life. The State paid him £50 for his “History,” which was

used by Mather, Hutchinson, and others, and was printed by the Mass. Historical Society
in 1815.

40 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Anne Bradstreet.

MRS. ANNE BRADSTREET, 1612-167 2, daughter of one and Wife of another
Governor of Massachusetts, published in 1640 a volume of poems which
were for the time in high repute, and Won for her in England the title of
the Tenth Muse.

If a critic at this day ﬁnds it diﬂicult to become enthusiastic over the poems of this lady,
he can without trouble place her at the head of the American poets of her own time. The
most distinguished men in the Colonies were her friends and the admirers of her genius.
The title of her volume is worthy of being quoted, in illustration of the fashion of thetime
in such matters. Nowadays it would have been called The Four Elements and Other Poems,
or some such fancy name. But in those stately days, a title-page was a serious matter. Mrs.
Bradstreet_’s volume begins thus: “ Several Poems, Compiled with great variety of Wit and
Learning, full of Delight ; wherein especiall is contained a Complete Discourse and Descrip-
tion of the Four Elements, Constitutions, Ages of Moons and Seasons of the Year, together
with an Exact Epitome of the Three First Monarchies, viz., The Assyrian, Persian, and Gre-
cian : and the Beginning of‘ the Roman Commonwealth to the end of their last King; with
Divers Other Pleasant and Serious Poems: By a Gentlewoman of New England.”

Mrs. Bradstreet worthily stands at the head of the women writers of America. One of the
descendants of Mrs. Bradstreet is Richard H. Dana, the well-known author.

“ The formal natural history and historical topics, which compose the greater part of her
Writings, are treated with doughty resolution, but without much regard to poetical equality.
The plan is simple. The elements of the world, ﬁre, air, earth, and water; the humors of
the constitution, the choleric, the sanguine, the melancholy, and phlegmatic; childhood,
youth, manhood, and age; spring, summer, autumn, and winter, severally come up and say
what they can of themselves, of their powers and opportunities, good and evil, with the ut~

most fairness. The four ancient monarchies are catalogued in a similar way. It is not to

be denied, that, if there is not much poetry in these productions, there is considerable in-
formation. For the readers of those times they contained a respectable digest of the old
historians, and a fair proportion of medical and scientiﬁc knowledge.”— Du-yclcinclc.

The specimens quoted by Mr. Duyckinck fully sustain his rather disparaging judgment.
Yet passages of a more pleasing kind are not Wanting.

FROM THE PROLOGUE TO “THE FOUR ELEMENTS.”

I am obnoxious to each carping tongue
That says my hand a needle better ﬁts;
A l’oet’s pen all scorn I should thus wrong,
For such despite they cast on female wits;
If what I do prove well, it won’t advance-
’1‘hey’ll say, It ’s stolen, or else it was by chance.

But sure, the antique Greeks were far more mild,
Else of our sex why feigned they those Nine,
And Poesy made Calliope’s own child?
So, ’mongst the rest, they placed the arts divine.
But this weak knot they will full soon untie—-
The Greeks did naught but play the fool and lie.

Let Greeks be Greeks, and women what they are;
Men have precedency, and still excel;
It is but vain unjustly to Wage war,
S Men can do best, and women know it well;

Yet grant some small acknowledgment of ours.

And oh, ye high-ﬂown quills that soar the skies,
And even with your prey still catch your praise,

Peter Folger.

PETER FOLGER, 1618-1690, one of the settlers of Nantucket, wrote a
poem called A Looking-Glass for the Times, which has acquired some
celebrity.

Folger came to America in 1635, and settled ﬁrst at Martha’s Vineyard, but ﬁnally in
Nantucket. He made himself proﬁcient in the language of the Indians,and was serviceable
to the missionary Mayhew, both as an interpreter and a catechist. He acquired considera-
ble knowledge also of surveying, and was one of the commissioners for laying out land. His
chief distinction, however, is that he was grandfather on the mother’s side to 13e11_jamin
Franklin. Franklin thus refers to this fact in his Autobiography:

“ I was born in Boston, in New England. My m other, the second wife, was Abiah Folger,
daughter of Peter Folger, one of the ﬁrst colonists of New England, of whom Cotton Mather
makes honourable mention in his Ecclesiastical History of that province, as a pious and
learned Englishman, if I rightly recollect his expressions. I have been told of his having
written a variety of little pieces; but there appears to be only one in print, which I met
with many years ago. It was published in the year 1675, and is in familiar verse, agreeably
to the tastes of the times and the country. The author addresses himself to the governors
for the time being, speaks for liberty of conscience, and in favour of the Anabaptists,
Quakers, and other sectaries, who had suffered persecution. To this persecution he attrib-
utes the wars with the natives, and other calamities which afflicted the country, regarding
them as the judgments of God in punishment of so odious an offence, and he exhorts the
government to the repeal of laws so contrary to charity. The poem appeared to be written
with a manly freedom and a pleasing simplicity.”—- F7'cm7cZiin’s Azztobiogrccplzy.

Michael Wigglesworth.

MICHAEL WIGGLESWORTI-I, 1681-1705, was the author of two poems, --
The Day of Doom, and Meat out of the Eater.

Wigglesworth was graduated at Harvard in 1651, and was for nearly ﬁfty years pastor of
the church at Malden. He was always in delicate health, “ a little feeble shadow of a man,”
and his poems were written at times when by reason of bodily weakness he was obliged
temporarily to discontinue his pastoral labors. The “ Day of Doom ” is a poetical description
of the last Judgment; “ Meat out of the Eater” is a series of meditations showing the bene-
ﬁts of aﬁlictions. Both poems went through several editions.

42 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Samuel Willard.

. SAMUEL WILLARD, 1640-1707, who held a conspicuous position in the
Boston churches and in the affairs of Harvard College, was the author of
sundry religious works, including a Complete Body of Divinity.

’ VVillard was born at Concord, Massachusetts, and graduated at Harvard, in the class of
1659. He was one of the co-pastors of the Old South»Church, Boston. On the retirement
of Increase Mather from the presidency of Harvard, in 1701, Willard succeededito the gov-
ernment of the institution, being nominally Vice-President, but virtually President, from
1701 to 1707.

Willard displayed much boldness in stemming the torrent of persecution during the
witchcraft delusions. I-Iis published works are numerous. The following are a portion:
A Complete Body of Divinity, in two hundred and ﬁfty lectures on the Assembly’s Shorter
Catechism, folio, 914 pp.; Ne Sutor Ultra Crepid-am, animadversions upon a publication of
the Anabaptists ; Peril of the Times Displayed; Covenant Keeping the VVay of Blessedness ;
The Mourner’s Cordial against Excessive Sorrow.

Willard’s Body of Divinity was the ﬁrst regular and full treatise on theology, as well as
the ﬁrst folio volume, published in America. Willard was twice married, and he had twenty
children. .

Willard was celebrated for his tact, accompanied occasionally with a touch of humor.
The following instance is given. His son-in-law, Mr. Neal, on one occasion preached for
him. The sermon was so poor that several of the congregation asked Willard not to invite
the man to preach again. Willard some time afterwards borrowed the sermon and preached
it himself, giving it the beneﬁt of his ﬁne delivery. The same persons who had asked that
All‘. Neal should not preach to them, were so delighted with Mr. Willard’s sermon that they
asked a copy for publication 1

Increase Mather.

INCREASE MATHER, D. D., 1639-1723, one of the most prominent figures
in the early history of Massachusetts, was the author of a large number of

« Works, among which may particularly be named that on Remarkable Provi-

dences, and A History of the VVars with the Indians.

Dr. Mather was born at Dorchester. He graduated at Harvard in 1656, and became
preacher in the old North Church in Boston. He died in his eighty-ﬁftli year, a11d in the
sixty-sixth of his ministry. He was President of Harvard during sixteen years of that time,
1685-1701, and he exerted a commanding inﬂuence both in Church and State. Though
mingling much in affairs, he was indefatigable as a student, passing two-thirds of the day
among his books, and he left behind him no less than eighty-ﬁve publications, mostly religious
and theological. The Essay for the Recording of Illustrious Providences, sometimes quoted
by its other title of Remarkable Providenees, is a collection of remarkable cases bearing
upon witchcraft, demonology, marvellous escapes at sea, etc. The phenomena therein de-
scribed are _attributed to the agency of the Devil. The work is interesting from its showing
that many of the phenomena of spirit-rapping and the like wereknown and studied before
their reappearance two centuries later.

The latest work from his hand was Agathangelus, a preface to the Coelestinus by his son
Cotton Mather. The following passage will be read with interest :

“The landscape of heaven here exhibited isldrawn by one who,.for two-and-forty years,
has, as a. son with a father, served me in the gospel. It wi.l1'be much if these forty-two

periods do not ﬁnish our peregrinations together through the wilderness. For my own
part, I am every hour looking and longing for the pleasant land, where I am sure I shall
not ﬁnd things as I do here this day. And having been somewhat comforted and strength-
ened by the prospect, which is here, as from the top of Mount Pisgah. taken of it, and en-
tirely satisﬁed in it, I commend it as one of my legacies to the people of God, which I must
leave behind me in a world which has things come and coming upon it, which blessed are
they that are escaped from.”

Cotton Mather-

Cotton Mather, D. I)., 1663-4728, the greatest of the famous
Mather family, is also in some respects the most conspicuous ﬁg-
ure in the early history of New England; and the Magnalia
Christi Americanaiis, on the Whole, the greatest, and the best
known, of his almost interminable list of Works.

If there is anything in blood and breeding, Cotton Mather would seem
to have had an hereditary ‘right to be, as in fact he was,» a theologian and a
scholar. His father, Dr. Increase »Mather, preacher of the Old North
Church in Boston, and for sixteen years President of Harvard, while a
sturdy champion of church prerogative and an ever busy manager of public
affairs, was yet evidently a man of books, spending usually two-thirds of the
day in his library. The grandfather, old Richard Mather, the founder of
the family in New England, though less conspicuous than some of his de-
scendants, was yet a man of mark for his scholarly habits and attainments.
The same is true, but in a still higher degree, of the grandfather on the
mother’s side, the “great John Cotton” of the infant colony.

Cotton Mather was ﬁtted for College with special care by Ezekiel Cheever, a pedagogue
famous in New England annals, and was so precocious in his studies that at the age of twelve

he “ had read Cicero, '.I.‘erence, and Virgil, the Greek Testament, and had entered upon Soc-
rates [qr. Xenopl1on’s Memorabilia] and Homer, and the Hebrew Grammar.” He graduated

with distinction at Harvard, at the age of ﬁfteen. After spending some years in teaching,’

he was ordained at the age of twenty-one, preaching the ﬁrst Sunday in the church of his
grandfather, Richard Mather, at Dorchester, the second Sunday in that of his father, and the
third Sunday in that of his maternal grandfather, John Cotton, in Boston. Mather is said to
have been a divine almost from his cradle, and he early formed a habit, which adhered to him
through life, of making a religious “improvement” of all the ordinary incidents of life.

“ ’l_‘his quaintness suited the genius of Mather. Every incident in life afforded him a text.
He had  special consideration for the winding up of his watch. As he mended his ﬁre, he
thought of rectifying his life; the act of paring his nails warned him to lay aside ‘all super-
ﬂuity of naughtiness ;’ while drinking a dish of tea ‘he was especially invited to fragrant
and grateful reflections.’ He appropriated the time while he was dressing to particular
speculations, parcelling out a different set of questions for every day in the week. On Sun-
day morning he commented on himself, as pastor; on Monday, as husband and father; on
Tuesday he thought of his relations, taking a catalogue which began with his parents and
extended as far as the children of his cousin-germans, and by an odd distribution, inter-
changing them sometimes with his enemies; Wednesday he gave to the consideration of the

church throughout the world; on Thursday he turned over his religious society efforts;
Friday he devoted to the poor and suffering, and Saturday he concluded with his own spir~
itual interests. To these devout associations he added the most humorous turns, not merely
improving—a notion readily entertained ——such similes of mortal affairs as the striking of
a clock or the dying ﬂame of a candle, but pinning his prayers on a tall man, that he might
have high attainments in Christianity; on a negro, that he might be washed white by the
Spirit; on a very small man, that he might have great blessings; upon a man on horseback,
that as the creature served him, so he might serve the C1'eato1'.’?—Dz_o3/c/cinch.

The one great blot in Cotton Mather’s character was his infatuation on the subject of
witchcraft, and the excessive zeal with which he defended and urged the persecution of
those suspected of being witches. The error in his case seems to have grown out of his
habit, already described, of carrying to excess the doctrine of a special providence. N 0 one
doubts, however, that he was thoroughly sincere and honest in what he wrote on this

. subject.

Mather gives the following account of his literary and scientiﬁc attainments. The state-
ment is fully borne out by what is known of him from other sources. “I am not unable,
with a little study, to write in seven languages. I feast myself with the secrets of all the
sciences which the more polite part of mankind admiringly pretend unto. I am entertained
with all kinds of histories, ancient and modern; I am no stranger to the curiosities which
by all sorts of learning are brought to the curious.”

The list of his printed works, given by his son Samuel, numbers three hundred and eighty-
two. Even this does not complete the list, several of his publications having been brought
to light afterwards. Many of these, of course, were only tracts, or occasional sermons. But
a large number of them were elaborate and stately volumes. Besides his published works,
he left in manuscript one which has never been printed, and which is now to be seen in the
library of the Massachusetts Historical Society, in six volumes folio, “ written in the author’s
round, exact hand, in double columns.” It is called Illustrations of the Holy Scriptures.
Portions of his Diary also are there, including the torn leaf, from which, according to his
declaration, an invisible hand plucked a piece, before his eyes! -

Mather’s greatest Work was his Mccgnalia Christi Ameariecma, purporting
to be an ecclesiastical history of New England, from its ﬁrst planting ‘in
1620 to the year 1698, but including also civil history, an account of Har-
vard College, of the Indian wars, and the witchcraft troubles, and a large
number of biographies.

New England’s worthies are indeed largely indebted for their perpetuity of fame to the
embalming inﬂuence of Cotton Mather’s genius and kindness of heart. These pen-portraits
of his contemporaries are now among the most precious of all his writings. The poet IIal-
leek thus refers to them:

0 Genius! powerful with thy praise or blame,
W’hen art thou feigning? when art thou sincere?

Mather, who banned his living friends with shame,
In funeral sermons blessed them on their bier,

And made their death-beds beautiful with fame——
Fame true and gracious as a widow’s tear

To her departed darling husband given;

Him whom she scolded up from earth to heaven.

Thanks for his funeral sermons, they recall
The sunshine smiling through his folio’s leaves

That makes his readers’ hours in bower or hall
Joyous as plighted hearts on bridal eves;

THE EARLY COLONIAL PERIOD. 

Chasing, like music from the soul of Saul,

The doubt that darkens, and the ill that grieves;
And honoring -the author’s'\ heart and mind, I
That beats to bless, and toils to ennoble human kind.

Mather’s dying charge to his son _Samuel, “Remember only that one word, F7'uctuosus,”
gives a key—note to an important part of his character. If ever a man was “fruitful,” it was
Cotton Mather. His industry was prodigious, and was almost continually occupied in
something intended to beneﬁt others. His “Essays to do Good” are mentioned by Franklin
as among the few books that gave to his own mind its remarkable bent towards the useful.
Franklinaccompanies the statement with the following characteristic anecdote:

“ The last time I saw your father was in the beginning of 1724, when I visited him after
my ﬁrst trip to Pennsylvania; he received me in his library, and on my taking leave, showed
me a shorter way out of the house, through a narrow passage, crossed by a beam overhead.
"We were still talking as I withdrew, he accompanying me behind, and turning partly to-
wards him, when he said hastily, ‘ Stoop, stoop I ’ I did not understand himtill I felt my
head hit against the beam. He was a man who never missed any occasion of giving instruc-
tion; and upon this he said to me, ‘ You are young, and have the world before you; stoop as
you go through it, and you will miss many hard thumps.’ This advice, thus beat into my
head, has frequently been of use to me; and I often think of it when I see pride mortiﬁed,
and misfortunes brought upon people by their carrying their heads too high.”—— Frcmklz'n.

“Mather was always exercising his ingenuity to contribute something useful to the world.
He was one of the first to employ the press extensively in the dissemination of tracts; he
early lifted his voice in favor of temperance; he preached and wrote for sailors; he in-
structed negroes; he substituted moral and sagacious intellectual restraints with his chil-
dren for ﬂogging; conversation he studied and practised as an art; and he was a devoted
historiographer of his country for posterity—besides his paramount employment, accord-
ing to the full measure of his day and generation, of discharging the sacred duties of his

profession.”—- Duyc7cz'nc7c.

After the Magnalia, Mather’ s next most important works are Memorable
Providences relating to VVitchcraft; and The VVonders of the Invisible
VVorld, being an Account of the Trial of Several VVitches.

Mather published also a new literal version of the Psalms, in metre, but “without the
jingle of rhyme,” and intended as an improvement upon the‘ old Bay Psalm Book.

Minor Authors.

Certain minor authors of this period deserve a brief passing notice.

ROBERT CALEF, ——- 1719, a Boston merchant, is known chieﬂy by his book against Cotton
‘.\Iat.he1‘ and other believers in witchcraft. When Mather published his Wonders of the In-
visible World, Calef replied by More Wonders of the Invisible World. The reply excited
great indignation, and was burned in the college-yard of old Harvard, by order of the Presi~
dent.—BENJAMIN THOMPSON, 1640-1714, a graduate of Harvard, of the class of 1662, and Mas-
ter, ﬁrst of the public school in Boston, and afterwards of that in Cambridge, was, according
to the inscription on his tombstone, a “learned schoolmaster ” and “the renowned poet of
New England.” His chief production was a poem entitled “New England’s Crisis.”— JOHN
JOSSELYN, who ﬁrst visited Boston in 1638 and spent a year there, and afterwards, in 1663-
1671, spent eight years and a half there and elsewhere in New England, published several
works descriptive of the country and its inhabitants: New England’s Rarities Discovered ;

46 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

An Account of Two Voyages to New England; Chronological Observations of America.-—
JOHN VVILLIAMS, 166-l—l729,_a native of Roxbury and a graduate of Harvard, was pastor of
the church at Deerﬁeld  the time that it was burnt by the French’ and Indians in 1704.
Mr. Williams and about one hundred of his people werefcarried away captive to Montreal in
midwinter. On his return from captivity, two or three years later, Mr. VVilliams published
a narrative of the sufferings of himself and his companions. This work, called The Re-
deemed Captive, has been frequently reprinted, and is one of the most graphic pictures of
simple-hearted heroism and constancy to be found in the early literature of New England.-—
ROGER WoLCoT'r,1679—1767, a native of Windsor, Connecticut, had not the advantage of a
liberal education, but rose to distinction, and ﬁlled various important ofﬁces in the colony,
being at one time Governor of Connecticut. He wrote a volume of poems, called Poetical
Meditations, and also a narrative and descriptive poem, being A Brief Account of the Agency
of John Winthrop in obtaining the Charter of Connecticut.-—CAPTAIN BENJAMIN CHURCH,
1639—1718, the leader of the colonists in King Philip’s war, dictated in his declining years an
account of the memorable transactions in which he had been engaged. This is called The
Entertaining Hist-ory of King Philip’s War. It.is an important historical document, and
has been several times reprinted.

President Blair.

JAMES BLAIR, D. 1)., 1656-1748, the ﬁrst President of William and Mary
College, Virginia, published in 1722 an extended work with the title, Our
Saviour’s Sermon on the Mount. '

This work of President Blair’s consisted of one hundred and seventeen sermons, in 5 vols.,
8vo, on texts in the Sermon on the Mount. It was reprinted in 1740, in 4 vols., with a preil
ace and high commendation by Dr. Watcrland. “ Blair’s Commentary on Matthew v.-viii.
is the best extant. He appears to have been a person of the utmost candor, and has solicit-
ously avoided all unkind and contemptuous reflections on his brethren. ‘He has an excel-
lent way of bringing down criticism to common capacities, and has discovered a vast knowl-
edge of Scripture in the application of them.”—Docld1'z'dge. “The best exposition of this
discourse.” —- Biclcerstet/L.

President Blair was born and educated in Scotland, and took orders in the Scottish Epis-
copal Church. Going to England, he was persuaded by the Bishop of London to emigrate
to Virginia. He appears to have been a man of unusual ability, of great purity of charac-

ter, and of untiring perseverance. It was mainly by his continued and persistent efforts

that the College of William and Mary was established and put on a permanent footing. He
raised £2500 by subscription for its endowment, and was sent to England in 1692 by the
General Assembly to obtain a charter. He was named as President in the charter itself, and
held the office until his death. He died in 1743, in his eighty-eighth year. He was Com-
missary of the Bishop of London for Virginia and Maryland, and in virtue of this office was
a member of the Council of State. He was a clergyman over sixty years, Commissary ﬁfty-
four years, and President ﬁfty years. He was buried in the churchyard at Jamestown.

Col. William Byrd.

WILLIAM BYRD, 1674-1744, a wealthy and accomplished Virginia gen-
tleman, was the author of a number of narratives and descriptive pieces
known as The VVestover Manuscripts.

Col. Byrd, being born to ample fortune, was sent to England to be educated. There he
became the intimate friend of Charles Boyle, the Earl of Orrey, and of other eminent per-
sons, and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. On returning to Virginia, he took an

active, part in public affairs, and was one of the leading men in the colony. In 1728, he set
out with a party of commissioners to meet a party of commissioners from North Carolina,
to survey and settle the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia. The other Vir-
ginia commissioners were William Dandridge and Richard Fitz-William. The surveyors
were ‘William Mayo and Alexander Irvin, the Mathematical Professor of VVillian1 and
Mary. They had with them, also, Rev. Peter Fountain as chaplain, and seventeen woodsmen
and hunters. Col. Byrd took notes of the journey, and from them wrote out a Narrative.
He wrote also Sketches of Travel in Old Virginia, on two other occasions.

These important documents remained in manuscript until 1841, when they were printed
by Edward Ruﬁin of Petersburg, under the title of The Westover lllanuscripts, being so
called from the estate of Westover, on the north branch of the James River, where the
author lived.

These journals of Col. Byrd are remarkable for the freshness and vividness of their de-
scriptions, the quiet, gentlemanly air that pervades them, showing the author to be one
equally at home among books and men, and for a continual undercurrent of good—natured
humor worthy‘ of Irving or of Fielding. Ile is particularly fond of indulging in a bit of
fun at the expense of the North Carolinians.

The journa.ls abound in stories illustrative of Natural History. A passage is quoted,
giving some of his experiences with Bruin.

ABOUT BEARS.

“Our Indian killed a bear, two years old, that was feasting on grapes. He was very
fat, as they generally are in that season of the year. In the fall, the ﬂesh of this animal
has a high relish, different from that of other creatures, though inclining nearest to that
of pork, or rather of wild boar. A true woodsman prefers this sort of meat to that
of the fattest venison, not only for the ham! gout, but also because the fat of it is well
tasted, and never rises in the stomach. Another proof of the goodness of this is, that it is
less apt to corrupt than any other with which we are acquainted. As agreeable as such
rich diet was to the men, yet we who were not accustomed to it, tasted it at ﬁrst with some
sort of squeamishness, that animal being of the dog kind; though a little use soon recon-
ciled us to this American venison. And that its being of the dog kind might give us the
less disgust, we had the example of that ancient and polite people, the Chinese, who reckon
dog’s flesh too good for any under the quality of a Mandarin. This beast is in truth a very
clean feeder, living. while the season lasts, upon acorns, chestnuts, and chinquapins, wild
honey a.nd wild grapes. They are naturally not carnivorous, unless hunger constrain them
to it, after the mast is all gone, and the product of the woods is all exhausted. They are not
provident enough to lay up any hoard, like the squirrels ; nor can they, after all, live very
long upon licking their paws, as Sir John Mandevil and some other travellers tell us, but
are forced in the winter months to quit the mountains, and visit the inhabitants. Their
errand is then to surprise a poor hog at a pinch, to keep them from starving. And to show
that they are not ﬂesh-eaters by trade, they devour their prey very awkwardly. They do not
kill it right out, and feast upon its blood and entrails, like other ravenous beasts, but hav-
ing, after a fair pursuit, seized it with his paws, they begin ﬁrst upon the rump, and so de-
vour one collop after another till they come to the Vitals, the poor animal crying all the
while for several minutes together. However, in so doing, Bruin acts a little imprudently ;
because the dismal outcry of the hog alarms ' the neighbourhood, and it is odds but he pays
the forfeit with his life, before he can secure his retreat. But bears soon grow weary of this
unnatural diet, and about January, when there is nothing to be gotten in the woods, they
retire into some cave or hollow tree; where they sleep away two or three months very com-
fortably. But then they quit their holes in March, when the ﬁsh begin to run up the rivers,

on which they are forced to keep Lent, till some fruit or berry comes in season. But bears.

are fondest of chestnuts, which grow plentifully towards the mountains, upon very large
trees, where the soil happens to be rich. VVe were curious to know how it happened that

many‘~of the outward branches of those trees came to be broken off in that solitary place,
and were informed that the bears are so discreet as not to trust their unwieldy bodies on the
smaller limbs of the tree, that would not bear their weight; but after venturing as far as
it is safe, which they can judge to an inch, they bite off the end of the branch, which fall-
ing down, they are content to ﬁnish their repast upon the ground. In the same cautious
manner they secure the acorns that grow on the weaker limbs of the oak. And it must be
allowed that, in these instances, a bear carries instinct a great way, and acts more reason-
ably than many of his betters, who indiscreetly venture upon frail projects that will not
bear them.”-—-From The l‘V»stovelr Zi1a12.uscm'pts.

ROBERT BEVERLY, —— 1716, was a native of Virginia and clerk of the Council when Andros
was Governor. He wrote A History of the Present State of Virginia, 1705.

Jarnes Logan.

J AMES LOGAN, 167 4-1751, a man of note in the early settlement of Penn-
sylvania, was the founder of the Loganian Library in Philadelphia, and the
author of several valuable Works, both literary and scientiﬁc.

Logan was an Irishman by birth. He distinguished himself in youth by his attainments
in classics and mathematics, and was engaged for a time in teaching. Logan was a member
of the Society of Friends, and in 1699 he came to America as Secretary to William Penn, on
the occasion of the second visit of the .latter to his province. Logan became Chief Justice
of the colony and President of the Council. He was held in great respect, both by the
colonists and the aborigines. The celebrated Indian chief, Logan, whose speech is given by
Jefferson, was so named in honor of this friend of William Penn.

Logan communicated to learned men and societies abroad valuable scientiﬁc papers, mostly
in Latin, which were published in London, Amsterdam, and Leyden. Besides these, he
wrote in English The Duties of Man‘ as’ they may be deduced from Nature; A Defence of
Aristotle and the Ancient Philosophers (unﬁnished); Essays on Languages and the Antiqui-
ties of the British Isles; and several translations from the Greek a11d Latin classics.

Logan passed the closing years of his life i11 retirement, at Stanton, his country-seat near
Germantown. While there he wrote a translation of Cicero’s essay On Old Age, with
numerous explanatory notes. » This Was‘ printed in 1744 by Franklin, with the following
characteristic preface:

THE PRINTER TO THE READER.

“This version of Cicero’s tract De Senectute was made ten years since, by the honorable
and learned Mr. Logan, of this city; undertaken partly for his own amusement (being then
in his sixtieth year, which is said to be nearly the age of the author when he wrote it), but
principally for the entertainment of a neighbor, then in his grand climacteric; and the notes
were drawn up solely on that neighbor’s account, who Was, not so well acquainted as him-
self with the Roman history and language. Some other friends, however (among whom I
had the honor to be ranked), obtained copies of it in MS., and, as I believed it to be in itself
equal at least, if not far preferable, to any other translation of the same piece extant in our
language, besides the advantage it has of so many valuable notes, which at the same time
they clear up the text, are highly instructive and entertaining, I resolved to give it an im-
pression, being conﬁdent that the public would not unfavorably receive it.

“ A certain freedman of Cicero’s is reported to have said of a medicinal well, discovered in
his time, Wonderful for the virtue of its waters_in restoring sight to the aged, that it was a
gift of the bountiful gods to man, to the end that all might now have the pleasure of read-
ing his master’s works. As that well, if still in being, is at too great a distance for our use,
I have, gentle reader, as thou seest, printed this piece of Cicero’s in a large and fair char-

acter, that those who begin to think on the subject of Old Age (which seldom happens till
their.sight is somewhat impaired by its approach), may not, in reading, by the pain small
letters give to the eyes, feel the pleasure of the mind in the least allayed.

“I shall add to these few lines my hearty wish, that this ﬁrst translation of a classic in
this VVesteru World may be followed with many others, performed with equal judgment
and success; and be a happy omen that Philadelphia shall become the seat of the American
muses.” .

Franklin was mistaken in calling this “the ﬁrst translation of a classic in this Western
’World,” Sandys’s Ovid having been written on the banks of the James River, in Virginia,
more than a century before. Logan’s work may have been, however, the ﬁrst translation of
a classic printed in America. Loga.n’s translation is spoken of in high terms, and is consid-
ered the best before that of Melmoth.

,Tl1omas Chalkley.

THOMAS CHALKLEY, 167 5-17 49, another eminent Friend,was the author
of a series of religious Tracts, and of a Journal containing an account of
his experiences as an itinerant preacher.

Chalkley was born in. Southwark, London. Coming to America, he made Philadelphiahis
headquarters, but spent the greater part of his life in travelling through New England, the
Southern States, the West Indies, and elsewhere, as a voluntary missionary, preaching the
gospel. His writings are remarkable for their unpretending simplicity, and often for an un-
affected pathos and beauty. r l

011 one occasion, at sea, provisions became scanty, and there began to be ominous talk
among the crew “about eating one another,” and Chalkley, to whom the vessel had been
consigned, was upbraided for their distress. _

“ To stop this murmuring,” he says, “I told them they should not need to cast lots,
which was usual in such cases, which of us should die ﬁrst, for I would freely offer up my
life to do them good. One. said,_‘God bless you! I will not eat any of you.’ Another said,
‘ He would die before he would eat any of me; ’ and so said several. I can truly say, on
that occasion, at that time, my life was not dear to me, and that I was serious and ingenuous
in my proposition : and as I was leaning over the side of the vessel, thoughtfully consider-

ing my proposal to the company, and looking in my mind to Him that made me, a very‘

large dolphin came up towards the top or surface of the water, and looked me in the face;
and I called the people to put a hook into the sea, and take him, for here is one come to re-
deem me (I said to them). And they put a hook into the sea, and the ﬁsh readily took it;
and they caught him. He was longer than myself. I think he was about six feet long, and
the largest that ever I saw. This plainly showed us that we ought not to distrust the
providence of the Almighty. The people were quieted by this act of Providence, and
murmured no more. We caught enough to eat plentifully of till we got into the capes of
Delaware.” '

The following are the titles of some of his Tracts: God’s Great Love unto lvlankind
through Jesus Christ our Lord; Observation on Christ’s Sermon on the Mount; Youth Per-
suaded to Obedience, Grratitude, and Honor to God and their Parents, etc.

The ﬁrst of these Tracts is introduced with the following lines, which give an idea both
of his style and of his true and loving spirit. '

. “In sincerity and unfeigned love, both to God and man, were these lines penned. I de-
sire thee to peruse them in the same love, and then, peradventure, thou mayst ﬁnd some
sweetness in them. Expect not learned phrases, or ﬂorid expressions; for many times heav-

enly matter is hid in mean sentences, or wrapped up in mean expressions. It sometimes
pleases God to reveal the mysteries of his kingdom (through the grace of his Son our Lord
Jesus Christ) to babes and sucklings; and he oftentimes ordains praise out of their mouths ;
one of which, reader, I desire thou mayst be. My intent in writing these sheets is that
they, through the help of God’s grace and the good spirit of Christ, may stir up true love in
thee; first to God and Christ, and then to man; so thou wilt be ﬁt to be espoused to him,
who is altogether lovely, (that is Christ,) which is the desire ‘of him who is thy friend, more
in heart than wordz”

John Woolman.

JOHN WOOLMAN, 17 20-17 7 2, a native of New Jersey, and a noted
preacher among the Friends, is favorably known in letters by his Essays
and Epistles, but more particularly by his Journal.

Woolman was born in Northampton, Burlington Co., New Jersey. After exercising for
some time his craft as a tailor, he travelled on religious visits to various parts of America,
and ﬁnally died of the small-pox at York, England, where he was attending a Quarterly
Meeting of the Friends. He wrote Essays and Epistles on various religious and moral sub-
jects, but is most known by his Journal, which is admirable equally for its spirit and its
style. It has lately been republished, being edited with pious and loving care by the poet
Whittier. Charles Lamb says, in one of the Essays of Elia, “ Get the writings of John Wool-
man by heart, and learn to love the early Quakers.”

Aquila Rose.

AQUILA ROSE, 1695-1723, who was Clerk of the Assembly of Pennsyl-
vania, was the author of a volume called Sundry Poems, and seems to have
been a man of more than ordinary promise.

Rose was born and educated in England. Although he died when only twenty-eight, he

seems to have made a profound impression upon the Philadelphians of that day, by his poet-
ical abilities and his scholarly attainments. The following lines by Rose, written “for the
boys who carried out the weekly newspaper,” and hearing date 1720, give some evidence
of his style, and also show that the American custom of Carriers’ Addresses on New Year‘s
day goes back to a very respectable antiquity.

Full ﬁfty times have roul’d their changes on,
And all the year’s transactions now are done;
Full ﬁfty times I’ve trod with eager haste,

To bring youweekly news of all things past.
Some grateful thing is due for such a task,

Tho’ modesty itself forbids to ask;

A silver thought, expressed in ill-shaped ore,

Is all I wish; nor would I ask for more.

To grace our work, swift Mercury stands in view

When human nature lmlgll a God within.

Samuel Keimer.

SAMUEL KEIMER, who ﬂourished in Philadelphia about the years 1720-
1730, wrote several pieces, half poetical, half doggerel, which are note-
worthy as a feature in the literature of the day.

Keimer came from England to Philadelphia, and was about establishing himself as a
printer there at the time of Franklin’s arrival on the same errand. Keimer was an odd
genius, with more ability than discretion. After plying his trade for some time in Philadel-
phia, he went to the \Vest Indies, where he is found in 1734 as the printer of The Baa-badoes
Gazette. He got himself into hot water among the planters, and ﬁnally returned to England.

Cadwallader Golden.

CADWALLADER COLDEN, M. D., 1688-17 7 6, was the earliest author of note
in the city of New York, of those at least who wrote in English.

Colden was a Scotchman by birth. I-Ie was graduated in 1705 at the University of Edin-
burgh, and then spent three years in studying medicine. He emigrated to America in 1708,
and settled in Philadelphia, where he practised medicine with success for several years. In
1715, he visited London, where he made the acquaintance of Halley the astronomer, who
read before the Royal Society a paper of Colden’s with great applause. In 1718, he settled
in New York, and quitting his profession gave himself up to public affairs, holding at differ-
ent times various important offices. He was lieutenant-governor from 1760 until his death
in 1776.

Colden’s chief work was AI-Iistory of the Five Indian Nations, which has been several
times reprinted, both in England and America. He wrote also a philosophical treatise, On
the Principles of Action in Matter, and numerous scientiﬁc papers. He was much devoted
to Botany, and was a correspondent of Linnaeus, Buffon, and other eminent scientists. He
took an active part in the formation of the American Philosophical Society.

THOMAS PRINCE, 1687-1758, was a native of Sandwich, Massachusetts, and a graduate of
Harvard, of the class of 1707. He was one of the pastors of the Old South Church, Boston.
He made a valuable collection of documents in regard to the early history of New England.
'l‘he manuscripts, which were deposited in the tower of the Old South Church, were de-
stroyed by the British during the revolutionary war. Prince wrote A Chronological History
of New England in the Form of Annals. It was not completed, coming down only to 1633.

SAMUEL TVIATHER, D. D., 1706-1785, a son of Cotton Mather, was educated at Harvard, and
was pastor of the Old North Church in Boston. He published a number of sermons, tracts,
etc. The most curious of his works is An Attempt to Show that America was known to the
Ancients, maintaining that the posterity of Japhet by Magog were the primary inhabitants
of the continent. He was also the author of a Life of Cotton Mather.

SOLOMON STODDARD, 1643-1729, was born in Boston, and graduated at Harvard, in the class
of 1662. He was a divine of high repute, and was settled for many years at Northampton,
Mass. He wrote a work, The Doctrine of Instituted Churches, intended to show that the
Lord’s Supper is a converting ordinance. Some of his other pieces were, An Appeal to the

52' AMERICAN LITERATURE.

SAMUEL JoIINsoN, D. 1)., 1696-1722, is styled by Dwight thefather of
Episcopacy in Connecticut.

Johnson was a native of Guilford, in Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale College, in the
class of 1714. Becoming a convert to Episcopacy, he went to England for Episcopal ordina-

tion in 1722, and returned the next year as a Missionary of the Society for the Propagation .

of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, at Stratford. Here he was instrumental not only in build-
ing up a parish, but in extending Episcopacy throughout the colony.

He was a man of distinguished attainments and ability,.and upon the establishment of
King’s (now Columbia) College, New York, he was chosen President,-—but retired ﬁnally to.
his original charge in Stratford. He published several works, among them, A System of
Morality; a Compendium of Logic; an English and aHebrew Grammar; and various con-
troversial tracts in favor of Episoopacy.

John Seccomb.

JOHN SECCOMB, 1708-1792, gained considerable notoriety by a witty
poem, called Father Abbey’s VVill.

Seccomb was a native of Medford, and a graduate of Harvard, of the class of 1728. He was
minister of the town of Harvard for more than twenty years. In 1757, he became minister
of a congregation in Nova Scotia, Where he remained until his death, at the age of eighty-
four.

Father Abbey’s VVi_ll was published in 1732, soon after the author’s graduation.‘ Governor
Beloher sent a copy of the poem to England, where it was published in the Gentleman’s
Magazine. It has been often reprinted, and is one of the best comic poems of that day. The
real name of the hero was Matthew Abdy, who was for many years “ Bedmaker and Sweeper”
to Harvard College, and whose wife succeeded him in that vocation. She died in 1762, at the
advanced age of ninety-three. Besides this poem, part of which we quote, Seccomb wrote
another of the same sort, purporting to be a letter from the “ Bedmaker and Sweeper” of
Yale to the heiress, the widow Abbey, and begging her to unite her fortunes with his.

FATHER ABBEY’S WILL.
CAMBRIDGE, December, 1730.
Some time since died here, Mr. Matthew Abbey, in very advanced age. Ile had for a great
number of years served the College in quality of Bedmaker and Sweeper. Having no child,
his wife inherits his whole estate, which he bequeathed to her by his last will and testa-

ment, as follows, viz.:

To my dear wife, Two painted chairs, ‘
My joy and life, Nine warden pears,

I freely now do give her A large old dripping platter,
My whole estate, This bed of hay,
‘With all my plate, ‘ On which I lay,

Being just about to leave her. An old saucepan of batter.
My tub ofsoap, A little mug,
A long cart rope, A two-quart jug,

A frying-pan and kettle, A bottle full of brandy,
An ashes pail, - A looking glass,
A threshing-ﬂail, To see your face,

An iron wedge and beetle. You ‘ll ﬁnd it very handy.

THE EARLY COLONIAL PERIOD. 53

A musket true This is my store,
As ever ﬂew,‘ I have no more,
A pound of shot and wallet, I heartily do give it;
A leather sash, My years are spun,
My calabash, - My days are done,
My powder-horn and bullet. And so I think to leave it.

Thus Father Abbey left his spouse
As rich as church or college mouse,
Which is suﬁicient invitation

To serve the college in his station.

CHARLES CHAUNCY, D. D., 1705-1787, a great-grandson of the Charles Chauncy who was the
second President of Harvard, was a native of Boston, and was for sixty years minister to the
first church in that city. He entered college at twelve, and graduated with high honor at
sixteen. Dr. Chauncy had a great reputation as a theologian, but was opposed to all orna-
ment in writing or speaking. He bitterly opposed the preaching of Whiteﬁeld, as being what
would now be called “sensational,” and wished. some one would translate Paradise Lost
into prose, that he might understand it. He was a man of the most uncompromising integ-
rity and independence, and made no hesitation in openly rebuking the General Court, for
its political delinquencies. His principal publications were : On the Various Gifts of Minis-
ters; On Enthusiasm; On the Outpourings of the Holy Ghost; An Account of the French
Prophets ; Seasonable Thoughts on the State of Religion in New England; The Validity of
Presbyterian Ordination; Remarks on a Sermon of the Bishop of Llandaff; The Mystery
Hid from the Ages; The Fall of Man and its Consequences, etc.

JOHN CALLENDER, 1706-1748, is a man of some note, as being the ﬁrst historian of Rhode
Island. He published in 1739 A Centennial Discourse, giving a history of the civil and re-
ligious affairs of Rhode Island, from its ﬁrst settlement, in 1638, to 1738, or the end of the
ﬁrst century. Callender was a native of Boston, and a graduate of Harvard. He was a Bap-
tist minister, and a man of ﬁne literary tastes. He was connected with Berkeley in the
formation of a literary and philosophical society at Newport.

MRS. JANE TURELL, 1708-1735, who was noted for her extraordinary precocity of intellect,
left i11 manuscript a number of poems, which were collected and published by her hiusband.
These pieces show a reﬁned taste and varied reading, and no little of genuine poetic ﬁre.—-
REV. EBENEZER TURELL, 1702-1778, husband of the lady just named, and pastor of Medford
for over ﬁfty years, published Memoirs of Mrs. Turell, A Life of Benjamin Coleman, D. D.,
Mrs. Ture1l’s father, and left in manuscript an ingenious work on witchcraft.

President Clap.

REV. THOMAS CLAP, 1703-1767, one of the early Presidents of Yale Col-
lege, eminent for his attainments in science and letters, Was the author of
several valuable Works.

President Clap entered upon the Presidency in 1739, and continued to discharge its duties
with signal ability for twenty-seven years, resigning the oﬁice in 1766, a few months before
his death. His published works are An Essay on the Religious Condition of Colleges; A
Vindication of the Doctrines of New England Churches; An Essay on the Nature and Foun-
dation of Moral Virtue and Obligation; A History of Yale College; Conjectures on the
Nature and Motion of Meteors above the Atmosphere, etc.

President Dickinson.

REV. JONATHAN DICKINSON, 1688-1747, ﬁrst President of the College
of New Jersey, was an eloquent preacher and a writer of acknowledged
ability. -

President Dickinson was for forty years pastor of the ﬁrst Presbyterian Church in Eliz-
abcthtown, which place was then the chief town in New Jersey. The College was first
chartered in 1746, and was organized and Opened at Elizabethtown in 1717. Dickinson was
a leading man in getting the charter, and in the movement which led to the establishment
of the College. He was a native of Hatﬁeld, Massachusetts, and a graduate of Yale, in the
class of 1706. He published many sermons and theological treatises, and a volume of
Familiar Letters upon Important Subjects in Religion.

President Burr.

AARON BURR, 1716-1757, second President of the College of New Jersey,
was a man of no Little note as a writer.

President Burr’s chief publications were A Treatise on the Supreme Deity of Our Lord
Jesus Christ; A Fast Sermon on the Encroachments of the French ; The Watchman’s Answer
to the Question, “ What of the Night? ” A Funeral Sermon on Governor Belcher, and some
Dther occasional sermons.

President Burr was a native of Fairﬁeld, Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale, of the class
of 1735. He was a son—in-law of Jonathan Edwards, and father of the Aaron Burr who ﬁg-
ured so largely in political affairs. He was celebrated as a preacher, but was still more dis-
tinguished for his executive ability. President Edwards, when elected afterwards to the
same office, expressed great reluctance to accept, on account of having to come after a man
of such great and varied ability ; and Governor Livingstone pronounced a glowing eulogium
upon him. All the contemporary accounts show that he was a man of extraordinary abil-
ities.

President Edwards.

REV. JONATHAN EDWARDS, 1703-1758, third President of the College
of New Jersey, is considered the greatest metaphysician that America has
produced, and one of the greatest that has ever lived. His works are nu-
merous and varied, but that by which he is most known is his essay on The

Will.

President Edwards was born in East Windsor, Connecticut; and graduated at Yale, at the age
of sixteen, and in the class Of 1720. Before completing his nineteenth year he began preach-
ing in New York city, to a congregation of Presbyterians. I:Ie was next tutor for two years
in Yale, and then settled as pastor in Northampton, Massachusetts. There, after minister-
ing for twenty-three years with great zeal, he was involved in diﬁiculties by attempting to
carry out the views which he held in regard to the religious character of those who
approached the Communion. At a meeting of his church to decide this question, he was
Out-voted by a large majority. He went then to Stockbridge, in the western part of the
State, and preached as a missionary to the Indians who occupied that part of the country,
and to the whites that lived among them. While thus engaged, he was elected President
of the College at Princeton, New Jersey, to which place he went in January, 1758. He died
there of small-pox, after a residence of about two months.

THE EARLY COLONIAL PERIOD. 55

President Edwards’s greatest work, On the Freedom of the Will, was written during the
time that he was preaching to the Stockbridge Indians. His other works are exceedingly
numerous, and several of them are second in value and importance only to that on the Will.
Many of them still remain in manuscript. The best edition of those published is in 10 vols-.,
8vo. Those with which the public are most familiar are: The Religious Affections; The
History of Redemption; The Doctrine of Original Sin; The True Nature of Christian Virtue ;
The End for which God Created the World ; A Narrative of the Work of God in the Conver-
sion of Many Hundred Souls in Northampton; Thoughts on the Revival of Religion ; Life
of David Br-ainerd, etc. A R

The fervor of Edwards’s piety was equal to the profoundness of his intellect. Those
abstruse speculations of his, on the deepest questions of logic and metaphysics with which
the human mind is ever called to grapple, were wrought out in the midst of abouuding pas-
toral labor and the excitements of a great religious revival; and the ablcst and subtlest of
them all was produced in the midst of a mission among savages, and while so straitened for
the means of living that his wife and daughters had to help out his scanty income by send-
ing their delicate handiwork to Boston for sale.

“This remarkable man, the metaphysician of America, was formed among the Calvinists
of New England, when their stern doctrine retained its rigorous authority. His power of
subtile argument, perhaps unmatched, certainly unsurpassed among men, was joined, as in
some of the ancient mystics, with a character which raised his piety to fervor.”—Sir James
Jllaclcintoslzi.

“I consider Jonathan Edwards the greatest of the sons of men. He ranks with the high-
est luminaries of the Christian church, not excluding any country, or any age, since the
Apostolic,”—Robert Hall.

“ The Inquiry into the Will is a most profound and acute disquisition. The English Cal-
vinists have produced nothing to be put into competition with it.”— Sir James Maclcintosh.

“In all the branches of theology, didactic, polemic, casuistic, experimental, and practical,
he had few equals, and perhaps no superior. The number and variety of his works show the
intenseness of his industry and the uncommon strength of his intellectual powers. The
Inquiry into the Will is a masterly work, Which, as a specimen of exact analysis, of pro-
found or perfect abstraction, of conclusive logic, and of calm discussion, will long support
its high reputation.”——Lowndes.

“He was commanding as a pulpit teacher, not for grace of person; he was slender and shy;
not for elocution; his voice was thin and weak; not for any trick of style; no man more
disdained and trampled on it: -—-but from his immense preparation, long forethought, sedu-
lous writing of every word, touching earnestness and holy life. He was not a man of com-
pany; he seldom visited his hearers. Yet there was no man whose mental power was
greater. Common consent set him at the head of his profession. Even in a time of rapture
and ﬁery excitement he lost no inﬂuence. The incident is familiar of his being called on a
sudden to take the place of Whiteﬁeld, the darling of the people, who failed to appear when
a multitude were gathered to hear him. Edwards, unknown to most in person, with un-
feigned reluctance, such as a va.iner man might feel, rose before a disappointed assembly and
proceeded with feeble Inanner to read from his manuscript. In a little time the audience
was hushed; but this was not all. Before they were aware, they were attentive and soon
enchained. As was then common, one and another in the outskirts would arise and stand ;
numbers arose and stood; they came forward, they pressed upon the centre; the whole
assembly rose; and before he concluded, sobs burst from the convulsed throng. It was the
power of fearful argument.”—— Dr. James Alexander.

President Davies.

REV. SAMUEL DAVIES, 1723-1761, fourth President of the College of
New Jersey, was in his day the most famous preacherin America.

The traditions in regard to the power of President Davies as a pulpit orator fully equal
those in regard to the popular and forensic eloquence of Patrick Henry. Davies was a
native of Newcastle County, Delaware, but his preaching was chieﬂy in Virginia. A collec-
tion of his Sermons was published in London,in 5 vols., 8vo. They have been frequently
reprinted. The latest edition, New York, 1851,in 3 vols., containeda Memoir on the Life and
Times of the Author, by Albert Barnes. Davies’s Sermons are to this day among the most popu-
lar to be found in that class of literature. He was only about eighteen months President
of the College, being cut off by death in the midst of his career of usefulness, yet even i11
that short time he did considerable to elevate the standard of scholarship in the College.
President Davies was the author of a number of excellent Hymns, some of which hold their
place in the hymnals of the present day.

President Finley.

SAMUEL FINLEY, D.'D., 1715-1766, ﬁfth President of the College of
New Jersey, did not publish much, but had the reputation of being a man
of superior ability, both as a scholar and a writer.

President Finley was a native of Armagh, Ireland. He emigrated to Philadelphia in 1734,
and was ordained by the Presbytery of New Brunswick, in 1740. He was actively engaged
with Whiteﬁeld and Gilbert Tennent in the great revival of that day. After preaching for
some time in Philadelphia and in diiferent parts of New Jersey, he was settled for seven
years in Nottingham, Maryland, where he established an Academy, and.was held in high
estimation. From Nottingham, he pro'ceeded to the Presidency in 1761. He published a
considerable number of Sermons, one of which, on the character of President Davies, is pre—
ﬁxed to the works of the latter. I

THE TENNEN’l.‘S.—GllbeI't Tennent, 1703-1764, was born in Ireland, and emigrated to
America in 1718. He was settled from 1726 to 1743 over a Presbyterian church in New
Brunswick, New Jersey, and from 1743 to 1764 over the Second Presbyterian Church in
Philadelphia, the one gathered by the preaching of Whiteﬁeld. He published three vol‘
umes of Sermons, and some separate discourses. -—William Tennent. 1705-1777, a brother of
Gilbert, and a native of Ireland, emigrated to America at the same time with his brother.
William was settled over the Presbyterian church at Freehold, New Jersey. He published
some separate Sermons, but no volume. He is chieﬂy noted for having been three days in a
trance, and for the many speculations among theologians, to which his trance gave rise.
Both the Tennents were connected with the revival movements of Whiteﬁeld.

 

 

CHAPTER II.

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD.

THE political ferment which ended in the War for independence
and the establishment of a separate nationality gave a peculiar
type to the literature of the time. The agitation spoken of be-
gan as early as 1760, and did not end before the close of the cen-
tury.’ This period, therefore, from 1760 to 1800, forms the limits
of our Second Chapter. ‘

The battle of the Revolution was fought by the pen as Well as by the
sword. The leaders in the fight against the mother country had, not only
to argue their case before the tribunal of the World, but to educate their own
countrymen up to the point of armed resistance, and to hold them there
during a long and gloomy contest. After the War was over, there was the
not less grave and diﬂicult task of guiding the opinions of the nation and of
moulding the political elements into form and symmetry. _

In the accomplishment of this great and varied Work, the political Writers

of the period usedlfreely almost every variety of style that could be made

available for the purpose. They made grave and formal argument; they
employed also warm and patriotic appeal. The philippics of Patrick Henry,
Otis, and the elder Adams were ably seconded by Wit and song from Freneau,
Brackenridge, and Hopkinson. They roused their own side by patriotic
ballads, they stung the enemy with squibs. The Wit of the revolutionary
period, though not perhaps of a very high order of literature, was yet no
insigniﬁcant part of the moral force by Which the War of independence was
brought to a successful termination. ‘

In treating of the literature of this period, it is not practicable to divide
it into distinct sections, for the reason that most of those who Wrote much
Wrote in a great variety of characters; grave and humorous, “ prosing and
versing.” In the main, however, those Writers will be mentioned first who

by their pens engaged actively in the political struggle. After them Will
come those who during the same period contributed to the general current
of literature, but who did not engage directly in political and partisan dis-
eussions.

Benjamin Franklin.

Benjamin Franklin, 17 06-1790, may be Viewed under three
aspects,—as a sage, a statesman, and a man of science; in each
aspect, he stands among the ﬁrst men of all time.

Franklin’s Writings, which are numerous, ﬁlling 10 octavo volumes,
consist, 1. Of his Autobiography and of Essays on Moral and Religious
Subjects and the Economy of Life; 2. Of Essays on Politics, Commerce,
and Political Economy; 8. Of Papers on Electricity and other Scientific
and Philosophical Subjects.

The following is a more detailed enumeration of the subjects, as given in the edition of
his works by Mr. Sparks: 1. Autobiography; 2. Essays on Moral and Religious Subjects and
the Economy of Life; 3. Essays on General Politics, Commerce, and Political Economy; 4.
Essays and Tracts, Historical and Political, before the American Revolution; 5. Political
Papers during and after the American Revolution; 6. Letters and Papers on Electricity;
7. Letters and Papers on Philosophical Subjects; 8. Correspondence.

Franklin was born in Boston. His schooling was limited to the common English branches.
At the age of ten, he was taken from school, and placed in the shop of his father, a tallow—
chandler, and set “at cutting wicks for the candles, ﬁlling moulds for east candles, attend-
ing the shop, going of errands, etc.” The occupation was so distasteful that he formed the
design of going to sea. To prevent such a result, he was apprenticed to learn the trade of a
printer of an older brother, who had a printing-oiﬁce in Boston. This employment was
congenial to Franklin’s tastes, and he acquired a knowledge of the art with great rapidity.
The work brought him also into communication with books, and he spent his leisure hours
in eagerly reading whatever he could ﬁnd that was suited to his tastes. Among the books
which he thus read, and which exerted a powerful inﬂuence over him were Pilgrim’s Prog-
ress, Plutarch’s Lives, an odd volume of The Spectator, and Cotton Mather’s Way to Do
Good.

The brother and he not getting on pleasantly together, Benjamin, at the age of seventeen,
left Boston and went to Philadelphia. At the latter place he found employment as a jour-
neyman printer. Meeting with some encouragement, he determined, when about twenty-
one years of age, to open a printing-oﬁice _on his own account, and proceeded to London to
procure the type and other necessary materials. Not being able to effect the purchase, he
remained nearly two years in London, practising his trade as a journeyman printer. While
there, he published a Dissertation on Liberty and Necessity, which attracted some attention.

On returning to Philadelphia, Franklin, by the aid of some friends, established a printing-
ofﬁce, and at the same time bought out a newspaper, The Pennsylvania Gazette, which he
continuedlfor many years to publish, and which by his business sagacity and his talents as
a writer he made a source both of proﬁt and of inﬂuence.

Franklin began about the same time the publication of an annual almanac, purporting to
be written by Richard Saunders, and commonly known as Poor Riehard’s Almanac. It con-
tained, besides the matters customary in such publications, a series of pithy sayings in
regard to economy and thrift and the minor morals of life. The Almanac was exceedingly
popular, and was continued for twenty-six years. Some of the best things that Franklin

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 59

ever wrote, and that have since become proverbs amdng all English-speaking people, ap-
peared ﬁrst in this Almanac.

By his paper and his other publications, and by his personal character, Franklin acquired
a great and constantly growing inﬂuence, both social and political. He was mainly instru-

, mental in founding, in 1731, the Philadelphia Library; in 1743, the American Philosophidal

Society; and in 1749, the Academy out of which grew the University of Pennsylvania.

Franklin held various important public offices, both in Pennsylvania and under the
general government, and was one of the leaders of public opinion in all the controversies
between the Colonies and the mother country; and he was, on diiferent occasions, sent to
England as agent for the colonial Assembly. He was a prominentmember of the Continental
Congress, and was one of a committee of ﬁve to draft the Declaration of Independence; be
negotiated the Treaty with France, which contributed largely to the achievement of inde-
pendence; he was one of the three commissioners who negotiated the Treaty of Peace, in
1783; and, ﬁnally, he was a delegate to the Convention by whom‘ the Constitution of the
United States was drafted, after the war was over.

During all the time that Franklin was thus engaged in public aifairs, he found the leisure
to pursue the philosophical investigations which have made his name ‘famous, and also to
write those numerous essays on familiar subjects which by their simplicity and wisdom have
excited the marvel of mankind.

In his youth, while following his trade as a printer, Franklin one day amused .himself by
composing the following Epitaph, which has often been quoted :,

The Body
of
Benjamin Franklin,
Printer. *
(Like the cover of an old book,
Its contents torn o11t,
And stript of its lettering and gilding,)
Lies here, food for Worms.
Yet the work itself shall not be lost,
For it Will, as he believed, appear once more,
In a new A
And more beautiful edition,
Corrected and amended
By
The Author.

During the sessions of the Convention which framed The Constitution of the United States.
Franklin made the following brief, but memorable speech, on the propriety of public prayer
by bodies engaged in the affairs of state:

PRAYER IN PUBLIC COUNCILS.

In the beginning of the contest with Britain, when we were sensible of
danger, We had daily prayers in this room for the Divine protection. Our
prayers, sir, were heard, and they were graciously answered. ' All of us who
Were engaged in this struggle must have observed frequent instances of a

superintending Providence iii our favour. To that kind Provid.ence We owe
this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing
our future national felicity. And have We now forgotten this powerful

friend? or do we imagine We no longer need His assistance? I have lived, _

sir, a long time, (eighty-one years ;) and the longer I live the more convinc-
ing proofs I see of this truth, that God governs in the affairs of man. And
if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground Without His notice, is it probable that
an empire can rise Without His aid? i We have been assured, sir, in the
sacred Writings, “that except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain
that build it.” I ﬁrmly believe this; and I also believe that Without His
concurring aid, We shall succeed in this political building no better than the
builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local interests;
our projects will be confounded; and we ourselves shall become a reproach
and a byword down to future ages. And What is Worse, mankind may here-
after, from this unfortunate instance, despair of establishing government by
human Wisdom, and leave it to chance, war, or conquest. I therefore beg
leave to move that henceforth prayers, imploring the assistance of Heaven,
and its blessing on our deliberations, be held in this assembly every morning
before we proceed to business; and that one or more of the clergy of this
city be requested to ofﬁciate in that service.

The following apothegms are culled from Poor Richard’s Almanac:

APOTHEGMS.

God helps them that help themselves.

Sloth, like rust, consumes faster than labour wears; while the used key is always bright.
Dost thou love life, then do not squander time, for that is the stuff life is made of.

The sleeping fox catches no poultry.

There will be sleeping enough in the grave.

If time be of all things the most precious, wasting time must be the greatest prodigality.
Lost time is never found again ; and what we call time enough always proves little enough.
Sloth makes all things diﬂicult, but industry all easy. a

He that riseth late must -trot all day, and shall scarce overtake his business at night.
Laziness travels so slowly that Poverty soon overtakes him.

Drive thy business, let not that drive thee.

Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.

Industry need not wish ; and he that lives upon hopes will die fasting.

He that hath a trade hath an estate; and he that hath a calling hath an oiﬁoe of proﬁt and

honour.

Industry pays debts, while despair increaseth them.

Diligence is the mother of good luck.

God gives all things to industry.

Plough deep while sluggards sleep, and you will have corn to sell and to keep.

One to-day is worth two to-morrows.

Never leave that till to-morrow which you can do today.

The cat in gloves catches no mice.

Constant dropping wears away stones.

By diligence and patience the mouse ate in two the cable.

Little strokes fell great oaks.

“ Antiquity would have raised altars to this mighty genius, who, to the advantage of man-
kind, compassing in his mind the heavens and the earth, was able to restrain alike thunder-
bolts and tyrants.” — Mirabeau. '

“A singular felicity of induction guided. all his resea_rch, and by very small means he

established very grand truths. The style and manner of his publication on electricity are

almost as worthy of admiration as the doctrine it contains. He has endeavored to remove
all mystery and obscurity from the subject. He has written equally for" the uninitiated and
for the philosopher; a11d he has rendered his details amusing and perspicuous; elegant as
well as simple. Science appears in his language in a dress Wonderfully decorous, best adapted
to display her native loveliness. He has in no instance exhibited that false dignity by which
philosophy is kept aloof from common applications; and he has sought rather to make her

A a useful inmate and servant in the common habitations of man, than to preserve her merely

as an object of admiration in temples and palaces.” — Sir IIm’np/way Davy.

“This self-taught American is the most rational, perhaps, of all philosophers. He never
loses sight of common sense in any of his speculations; and when his philosophy does not
consist entirely in its fair and vigorous application, it is always regulated and controlled by
it in its application and results. No individual, perhaps, ever possessed a juster under-
standing, or was so seldom obstructed in the use of it by indolence, enthusiasm, or authority.
The distinguished feature of his understanding was great soundness and sagaeity, combined.
with extraordinary quickness of penetration. He possessed also a strong and lively imagi-
nation, which gave his speculations, as well as his conduct, a singularly original turn. The
peculiar charm of his writings, and his great merit alsoin action, consisted in the clearness
with which he saw his object, and the bold and steady pursuit of it by the surest and the
shortest road. He never suffered himself, in conduct, to be turned aside by the Seductions
of interest or vanity, or to be scared by hesitation and fear, or to be misled by the arts of
his adversaries. Neither did he, in discussion, ever go out of his way in search of ornament,
or stop short in dread of the consequences. He never could be caught, in short, acting ab-
surdly, or writing nonsensically : at all times, and in everything he undertook, the vigor of
an understanding at once original and practical was distinctly perceivable.” - Lord Je,[/“reg/.

62 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

George Washington.

GEORGE WASHINGTON, 1732-1799, was so immeasurably great in other
respects, that it seems almost a profanation to speak of him as a Writer.
Yet hiswritings ﬁll twelve octavo volumes, and are a valuable part of the
political literature of the time.

Most of Washington’s writings are oﬁicial papers. Some are diaries or journals, some are
agricultural essays, yet all are distinctly Washingtonian. He had formed for himself a
style, the unconscious outgrowth of his character, which is as distinctly marked as his hand-
writing. Even in his Farewell Address, in which he invited the co-operation of Madison,
Hamilton, and Jay, the document, in its -ﬁnal form, gives unmistakable evidence of the
moulding hand of its original author. “It ‘is unlike any composition of Madison or Ham-
ilton, in a certain considerate moral tone which distinguished all Washington’s writings.
It is stamped by the position, the character, the very turns of phrase of the great man who
gave it to his country.”

“The handwriting of Washington, large, liberal, and ﬂowing, might be accepted as . . . .
a capital index of the style” of the writer, “and may help us to what we would say of its
characteristics. It is open, manly, and uniform, with nothing minced, affected, or con-
tracted. It has neither the precise nor the slovenly style which scholars variously fall into;
but a certain grandeur of the countenance of the man seems to look through it. Second to

. its main quality of truthfulness, saying no more than the writer was ready to abide by, is

its amenity and considerate courtesy. Washington had, at different times, many unpleasant
truths to tell; but he could always convey them in the language of a gentleman. He wrote
like a man of large and clear views. His position, which was on an eminence, obliterated
minor niceties and shades which might have given a charm to his writings in other walks
of life. This should always be remembered, that Washixigton lived in the eye of the pub-
lic, and thought, spoke, and wrote under the responsibility of empire. Let his writings be
compared with those of other rulers and commanders, and he will be found to hold his rank
nobly, as well intellectually as politically. There will be found, too, a variety in his treat~
ment of different topics and occasions. He can compliment a friend in playful happy terms
on his marriage, as well as thunder his demands for a proper attention to the interests of the
country at the doors of Congress. Never vulgar, he frequently uses colloquial phrases with
effect, a11d, unsuspected of being a poet, is fond of ﬁgurative expressions. In ﬁne, a critical
examination of the writings of Washington will show that the man here, as in other lights,
will suffer nothing by minute inspection.” —-Duyc7cz'ncIc.

James Otis.

JAMES OTIS, 1725-1783, the Patrick Henry of New England, Was one of
the earliest, boldest, and most eloquent advocates of the rights of the C010-
nies, in the dispute with the mother country.

Otis was a native of West Barnstable, Massachusetts, and a graduate of Harvard, of the
class of 1743. He was a ﬁne classical scholar, and, among other things, published a work
on Latin Prosody, and a dissertation on The Power of Harmony in Prosaic Composition. His
chief publications, however, were of a political character, namely, A Vindication of the Con-
duct of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts Bay; The Rights of the British
Colonies Asserted and Proved; Considerations on behalf of the Colonists; A Vindication of
the British Colonies.

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 63

As a speaker, Otis was ﬁery and vehement, and often carried his hearers with him to an
almost uncontrollable pitch of enthusiasm. His ﬁrst great speech was in 1761, when he
argued against an application for “ writs of assistance.” Of this speech, John Adams says:
“Otis was a ﬂame of ﬁre; with a promptitude of classical allusions, a depth of research, a
rapid summary of historical events and dates, a profusion of legal authorities, a prophetic
glance of his eyes into futurity, and a rapid torrent of impetuous eloquence, he hurried
away all before him. American independence was then and there born. Every man of an im-
mense crowded audience appeared to me to go away, as I did, ready to take up arms against
writs of assistance.”

In 1769, in an altercation in a coffee-house, Otis received a severe blow on the head, which
led to insanity, and incapacitated him from taking any further part in public affairs. He
passed the remainder of his life in retirement, at Barnstable and Andover. At the latter
place, in 1783, while leaning on his cane, in the door of the house, he Was struck by light-
ning, and his soul instantly released from its shattered tenement. “ Extraordinary in death,
as in life, he has left a character that will never die, while the memory of the American
Revolution remains; whose foundations he laid with an energy and with those masterly
abilities which no other man possessed.” —J0lm Adams. '

The Elder Adams.

JOHN ADAMS, 1735-1826, one of the originators and leaders of the
American Revolution, and the second President of the United States, was
a political writer of great ability, and by his Writings contributed largely to
the success of the American cause.

Adams embarked in the controversy between the Colonies and Great Britain as early as
1765, and continued to discuss the subjects at issue until the close of the war. His writings
have been collected and edited by his grandson, Charles Francis Adams, in 10 vols., 8vo. His
Letters to his Wife have also been published in 2 vols. The following are some of his larger
works: A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law; Novanglus, A History of the Dispute
with America, from its origin in 1754 to the Present Time (1774); Defence of the Constitu-
tions of Government of the United States of America (published in England, in 1787); Dis?
courses on Davila, a Series of Papers on Political History.

Adams was a native of Braintree, Mass., and a graduate of Harvard, of the class of 1755.
He was a member of the ﬁrst Continental Congress, in Philadelphia, in 1774; he ﬁrst nomi-
nated George Washington as Commander-in-Chief of the American forces; he was one of
the committee of ﬁve to draft the Declaration of Independence; he went in 1777 as commis-
sioner to France, and again in 1779, to negotiate a peace ; he was one of those who made the
treaty of peace in 1783; and in 1785, he became the "ﬁrst American minister to England.
He was Vice-President during Washington’s two terms, and in 1797 succeeded to the Presi-
dency.

MRS. ABIGAL ADAMS, 1744-1818, the wife of the preceding, was a woman of ﬁne literary
culture. A collection of her Letters has been published by her grandson, Charles Francis
Adams.

Thomas Jefferson.

THOMAS J EFFERSON, 17 43-1826, third President of the United States, in
addition to all his other merits, won for himself an imperishable name, as
the author of the Declaration of Independence.

64 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Jefferson was born at Shadwell, Albemarle County, Virginia, and studied at William and
Mary.

IIe was admitted to the bar in 1767; and soon afterward entered upon political life, not to
leave it until his ﬁnal retirement in 1809. J eﬁerson was successively a member of the State
Legislature, of the Continental Congress, Governor of the State, Secretary of State under
Washington, Minister to France, Vice-President and President of the United States.

As a political leader, Jefferson’s merits and demerits are too well known to need more
than a brief recapitulation. His name is the most conspicuous, next to those of Washington
and Franklin, in American history; his services are great and manifold, although less pro-
found perhaps than those of Hamilton.

It was J eiferson who first ‘reduced party strife to a system, and originated, if he did not
fully develop, the plan of ejecting oﬂ"1ce—holders in favor of the victorious political party——a
system that has done more to degrade American politics than all other causes combined.
Jefferson was also the chief organizer of what was then the Republican (now the Demo-
cratic) party, in opposition to the Federalists under the lead of Hamilton. The former sought
to weaken, the latter to strengthen the power of the general government.

On the other hand, J eiferson has won for himself an imperishable name through his au-
thorship of the Declaration of Independence. It is now generally conceded that the Decla-
ration, aside from a few slight alterations, was the exclusive work of Jefferson. \Vhat the
character of the Declaration is, and what its effects upon the political history of the world
have been and still are, is known to all. Jefferson is also the author of the Virginia Statute
for Religious Freedom, and the father of the University of Virginia. In 1784, while residing
in Paris, he published his celebrated Notes on the State of Virginia, a work which attracted
great attention at the time, and which still l1as its value as an important collection of facts
and statistics. J eiferson is also the author of a Manual of Parliamentary Practice, which is
regarded as authority in Washington and elsewhere. J efferson’s Correspondence was pub-
lished in 1829, and,_in 1854 appeared, in 9 vols., 8vo, a complete edition of his letters, auto-
biography, messages, etc., etc., published from the original manuscripts then in the Depart-
ment of State at Washington. These papers form a most valuable contribution to the
history of the United States, covering, as they do, the most critical military and political
period prior to 1860.

Jefferson made no pretensions to oratory, and seldom engaged in debate. But as a skilful
Writer, he had no superior among his contemporaries and associates. Some of his messages
are models of political eloquence. The ﬁrst of the following extracts reminds us of Frank-
lin; the second will compare favorably with the character-paintings of Brougham.

CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.

I think I knew General VVashington intimately and thoroughly; and were I called on to
delineate his character, it should be in terms like these : —-

His mind was great and powerful, without being of the very first order; his penetration

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 65

strong, though not so acute as that of Newton, Bacon, or Locke; and as far as he saw, no
judgment was ever sounder. He was slow in operation, beingilittle aided by invention
or imagination, but sure in conclusion. Hence the common remark ‘of his officers, of the
advantage he derived from councils of War, where, hearing all suggestions, he selected wl1at-
ever was best; and certainly no general ever planned his battles more judiciously. But if
deranged during the course of the action, if any member of his plan was dislocated by sud-
den circumstances, he was slow in a re—adjustrnent. The consequence was, that he often
failed in the ﬁeld, but rarely against an enemy in station, as at Boston and York. He was
incapable of fear, meeting personal dangers with the calmest unconcern. Perhaps the
strongest feature in his character was prudence, never acting until every circumstance,
every consideration was maturely weighed; refraining, if he saw a doubt; but, when once
decided, going through with his purpose, whatever obstaclesopposed. His integrity was the
most pure, his justice the most inﬂexible I have ever known ; no motives of interest or con-
sanguinity, oflfriendship or hatred, being able to bias his decision. He was, indeed, in every
sense of the word, a wise, a good, and a great man. His temper was naturally irritable and
high-toned; but reﬂection and resolution had obtained a ﬁrm and habitual ascendancy over
it. If ever, however, it broke its bonds, he was most tremendous in his wrath. In his ex-
penses he was honorable, but exact; liberal in contributions to whatever promised utility;

but frowning and unyielding on all visionary projects and all unworthy calls on his charity.‘

His heart was not warm in its affections; but he exactly calculated every 1nan’s value, and
gave him a solid esteem proportioned to it. His person, you know, was ﬁne; his stat.ure ex-
actly what one would wish; his deportment easy, erect, and noble; the best horseman of
his age, and the. most graceful ﬁgure that could be seen on horseback. Although in the
circle of his friends, where he Inight be unreserved with safety, he took a free share in con-
versation, his colloquial talents were not above mediocrity, possessing neither copiousness
of ideas nor ﬂuency of words. In public, when called on for a sudden opinion, he was un-
ready, short, and embarrassed. Yet he wrote readily, rather diffusely, in an easy and correct
style. This he had acquired by conversation with the world, for his education was merely

reading, writing, and common arithmetic, to which he added surveying at a later day. His.

time was employed in action chieﬂy, reading little, and that only in agriculture and English
history. His correspondence became necessarily extensive, and, with journaliziug his agri-
cultural proceedings, occupied most of his leisure hours within doors. On the whole, his
character was, in its mass, perfect; in nothing bad, in few points indifferent; and it may
truly be said, that never did nature and fortune combine more perfectly to make a man
great, andto place him in the same constellation with whatever worthies have merited
from man an everlasting remembrance. For his was the singular destiny and merit, of
leading the armies of his country successfully through an arduous war for the establishment
of its independence ; of conducting its councils through the birth of a government, new in
its forms and principles, until it had settled down to a quiet and orderly train ; and of scru-
pulously obeying the laws through the whole of his career, civil and military, of which the
history of the world furnishes no other example. -

James Madison.

JAMES MADISON, 1751-1836, fourth President of the United States, con-
tributed to the political literature of the country two works of great i1npor-
tance, namely, a considerable portion of The Federalist, and A Report of
the Debates of the Convention which framed the Constitution.

Madison was a native of King George County, Virginia, and a graduate of Princeton, of
the class of 1771. He was a diligent student, enjoying in a high degree the conﬁdence of
President Witherspoon, and remained in Princeton some time after graduating, engaged in

a course of reading under the President’s direction. His health, always delicate, was im-
paired by excessive study. Though a life-long invalid, yet by care in husbanding his
resources he accomplished an unusually large amount of work, and he survived to the age
of eighty—ﬁve.

Madison was, in 1776, a member of the Convention which framed the ﬁrst Constitution of
Virginia; in 1780, a member of the Continental Congress, many of whose most important
State papers were written by him; in 1787, a member of the Convention that framed the
Constitution of the United States. He not only contributed largely to the formation of that
document, but did the inestimahle service of taking notes daily of the debates of the Con-
vention, and writing them out carefully at night. Such a labor, performed by one in his
habitually feeble health, shows both his high sense of duty and his clear and prophetic
apprehension of the gravity of the labors in which they were engaged.

Madison’s character as a statesman is well known. In breadth of view and in depth of
character he was surpassed by Jefferson and Hamilton; on the other hand, he was distin-
guished for his calm good sense and his ready tact in carrying out political measures. Judge
Story speaks of him in the following language: “ I entirely concur with you in your esti-
mate of Mr. Madison,— his private virtues, his extraordinary talents, his comprehensive and
statesmanlike views. To him and Hamilton, I think, we are mainly indebted for the Con-
stitution of the United States; and in wisdoml have long been accustomed to place him
before Jefferson.”

As a writer, Madison is chieﬂy known by his contributions to The Federalist——twenty-
nine in number ——-and his Reports of the Debates of the Convention which framed the Con-
stitution of the United States. The manuscript of these reports was purchased by Congress
and published in 1840, in 3 vols. The great bulk of his manuscripts, however, still remains
unpublished, and would probably ﬁll twelve or thirteen volumes. It is to be regretted that
this collection is inaccessible to the public. His political writings are second only to those
of Hamilton in ability and inﬂuence. His style has not the intense nervous energy of Jef-
ferson’s, but his argumentation is considered sounder.

James Monroe.

JAMES MONROE, 1758-1831, ﬁfth President of the United States, though
not so distinguished in authorship as some of the early Presidents, was yet
a scholarly man, and made some valuable contributions to the political lit-
erature of the period.

Monroe was a native of Westmoreland County, Virginia, and a graduate of William and
Mary. Though only eighteen at the outbreak of the Revolution, he entered at once and with
characteristic earnestness into the service of the country as a soldier. After the war was
over, he engaged actively in public affairs, state and national, and rose by degrees through
various oﬂioes until in 1817 he reached the Presidency. Though much of his political Ca1‘ee1‘
belongs to the present century, an important part of it is connected with the organization
and settlement of the government a.fter the war of the Revolution. For this reason, he is
usually classed with the men of that generation.

Monroe wrote some works worthy of note: A View of the Conduct of the Executive in
the Foreign Affairs of the United States, published by him in London in 1798, in vindication
of his public conduct while he was resident minister in Paris; A Tour of Observation
through the N orth-Eastern and North-Western States in 1817.

The inscription on the tomb of Monroe, in the Hollywood Cemetery, at Richmond, is sin-
gularly beautiful, and deserves to be transcribed as a specimen of good taste in such compo-
sitions. The inscription is these simple words: “James Monroe; born in Westmoreland

County, 28th April, 1758; died in the city Of New York, 4th July, 1831. By order of the
Greneral Assembly, his remains were removed to this cemetery, 5th July, 1858, as am emldevzce
of the ctﬁectioiz of‘ Vz'rgz'ma_f0r her good and honored son.” .I wish I knew the author of this
remarkable inscription. Nothing in Greek or Roman letters is more beautiful.

Alexander Hamilton.

ALEXANDER HAMILTON, 17 57 -1804, was the ablest of all the political
writers of the Revolution. The Federalist, which was mainly his work, is
not only an important national treasure, but an enduring monument of
intellectual and literary greatness. ‘

Hamilton was a native of St. Kitts, in the West Indies, being of Scotch blood on the
fathcr’s side, and of Huguenot blood by his mother. Though his mother died when he was
but a child, he cherished her memory “ with inexpressible fondness.” At twelve years of
age he was entered as a clerk in the counting-house of Nicholas Cruger, a West India mer-
chant having dealings with New York. Cruger took a special‘ interest in his ‘young clerk,
and the kindness thus shown made a lasting impression on the mind of the susceptible boy.
When, on the death of Cruger, his affairs were in litigation, Hamilton, then in the height of
his practice as a lawyer, put forth his professional abilities to protect the interests of the
family, but steadily refused all compensation for his services; and when, after the death of
Hamilton, a compensation was offered to his widow, a paper was found, written by Hamilton,
in which he enjoined upon his family “never to receive money from any of the name of
Cruger."

Hamilton’s father had not been successful in business, but the indications of superior
talent shown by the boy induced his friends to make special exertions for his education, and
in 1772 he was sent to the United States for this purpose. He studied for a time at Eliza-
bethtown, New Jersey, with Francis Barber, a Princeton man, and while there enjoyed the
intimacy of Governor Livingston. He presented himself for admission to the College at
Princeton, with a View of passing from class to class as rapidly as his attainments would
permit. But Dr. Witherspoon not acceding to this plan, Hamilton went to King’s (now Col-
umbia) College, New York. He had already caught the popular enthusiasm in regard to
liberty, and he began while in College taking an active part, both by the pen and with the
tongue, in the political discussions of the day. He published when only seventeen a series
of essays on the Rights of the Colonies. His ﬁrst attempt to address a popular assembly
is thus described by his biographer:

“ It has been related to have been his habit to walk several hours each day under the shade
of some large trees which stood in Batteau, now Dey street, talking to himself in an under
tone of voice, apparently engaged in deep thought, a practice h_e continued through life.
This-circumstance attracted the attention of his neighbors, to whom he was known as
the “ young West Indian,” and led them to engage in conversation with him. One of them
remarking the vigor and maturity of his thoughts, urged him to address this meeting, to
which all the patriots were looking with the greatest intercst._ - From this seeming intru-
sion he at ﬁrst recoiled; but after listening attentively to the successive speakers, and ﬁnd-
ing several points untouched, he presented himself to the assembled multitude. The nov-
elty of the attempt, his youthful countenance, his slender and diminutive form, awakened
curiosity and arrested attention. Overawed by the scene before him, he at ﬁrst hesitated
and faltered ; but as he proceeded almost unconsciously to utter his accustomed reflections,
his mind warmed with the theme,'his energies were recovered; and after a discussion clear,
cogent, and novel, of the great principles involved in the controversy, he depicted in glow-
ing colors the long-continued and long-endured oppressions of the mother country; he in-
sisted on the duty of resistance, pointed to the means and certainty of success, and described

68 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

the waves of rebellion sparkling with ﬁre, and washing back on the shores of England the
wrecks of her power, her wealth, and her glory. The breathless silence ceased as he closed;
and the whispered murmur, ‘It is a collegianl it is a Collegian ! ’ was lost in loud expres-
sions of wonder and applause at the extraordinary eloquence of the young stranger.”

Hamilton’s remarkable powers andservices as a writer have rather thrown into the shade
his abilities as a soldier. It should not be forgotten, however, that he did conspicuous ser-
vice in the ﬁeld. By the advice of Washington, when war with France was threatened,
Hamilton was placed second in command, and he became commander~in-chief on the death
of "Washington.

No one of the great men of those times stands forth more conspicuous than Hamilton, and
no one certainly has had a greater inﬂuence than he in shapingthe destiny of his country.
This inﬂuence is due, ﬁrst to his labors as a member of the Constitutional Convention and
his essays in The Federalist, and next to his success in organizing the national credit and
treasury at a time when the ﬁnances of the country seemed in a hopeless condition.

Hamilton’s fame as a writer and thinker rests chieﬂy upon his contributions to The Fed-
eralist. Out of the eighty-ﬁve essays contained therein, ﬁfty-one are by him, twenty-nine by
James Madison, ﬁve by John Jay. These essays appeared in the interval between the pub-
lication and the adoption of the Constitution, and were designed to explain its merits to the
people at large. Hamilton’s contributions are easily distinguished from the others “ by
their superior comprehensiveness, practiealness, originality, and condensed and polished
diction.” The leading feature in Hamilton’s character was genius, but genius turned un-
ceasingly to useful ends. The precocity of his development, his unerring insight, the ease
and the energy with which he labored, as well as his early and tragic death, have all com-
bined to make his name second to that of Washington alone in the annals of his country.
To this day the arrangement of the Treasury Office remains substantially as Hamilton left
it, and The Federalist is still the best manual for the student of the Constitution.

“ Hamilton must be classed among the men who have best known the vital principles and
fundamental conditions of a government, —not of a government such as this, [France,] b11t
ofa government worthy of its mission and its name. There is not in the Constitution of
the United States an element of order, of force, or of duration, which he has not powerfully
contributed to introduce into it and caused to predominate.” — Gmlzot.

“ N o constitution of government ever received a more masterly and successful vindication.
I know not, indeed, of any work on the principles of free government that is to be com-
pared, in instruction and intrinsic value, to this small and unpretending volume of the Fed-
eralist; not even if we resort to Aristotle, Cicero, Machiavel, Montesquieu, Milton, Locke,
or Burke. It is equally admirable in the depth of its wisdom, the coniprehensiveness of its
views, the sagacity of its reﬂections, and the fearlessness, patriotism, candor, simplicity,
and elegance, with which its truths are uttered an d recommended. Mr. Justice Story acted
wisely in making The Federalist the basis of his Comrnentary.”—-Chancellor Kent.

“He smote the rock of the national resources, and abundant streams of revenue gushed
forth. He touched the dead corpse of the Public Credit, and it sprung upon its feet. The
fabled birth of l\linerva from the brain of Jove was hardly more sudden or more perfect
than the ﬁnancial system of the United States as it burst forth from the conception of Alex-
ander Ilamilton.”—Dcm*iel Webster.

“ He was capable of intense and eifectual application, as it abundantly proved by his pub-
lic labours. But he had a rapidity and clearness of conception in which he may not have
been equalled. One who knew his habits of study said of him, that when he had a serious
object to accomplish, his practice was to reﬁect on it previously; and, when he had gone
through this labour, he retired to sleep, without regard to the hour of night, and, having
slept six or seven hours, he rose, and, having taken strong coffee, seated himself at his table,
where he would remain six, seven, or eight hours ; and the product of his rapid pen required
little correction for the press.”—- Willzkmz Sullivan.

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 69

John Jay.

JOHN JAY, 17 45-1829, another conspicuous political writer of the Revo-
lutionary period, was associated with Hamilton and Madison in tlie produc-
tion of The Federalist.

Jay wrote only ﬁve of the papers in The Federalist, being prevented from writing others
by an injury received in the interim. He is, however, universally accepted as one of the
great men who contributed powerfully by his pen to the achievement of national indepen-
dence and to the organization and settlement of the new government.

Jay was a native of New York city, of Huguenot descent, and a graduate of Columbia
College. After ﬁlling many important positions, he was appointed by VVashington, in 1789,
Chief Justice of the United States. Besides his contributions to The Federalist, he was the
author of a number of State papers, the most celebrated of which is the Address to the
People of Great Britain, in 1774. This gained for him the reputation of being one of the
most eloquent writers of the times.

Dr. Witherspoon.

JOHN WITIIERSPOON, D. D., LL. D., 1722-1794, sixth in the line of illus-
trious Presidents of the College of New Jersey, contributed largely to the
literature of the period, and was in various ways one of the leaders of pub-
lic opinion, both political and religious.

Witherspoon’s works have been published in numerous editions, and in a variety of forms,
chieﬂy in 4 vols. 8vo,— and 9 vols. 12mo. They embrace, among others, the following: Con-
siderations on the Nature and Extent of the Legislative Authority of the British Parlia-
ment; An Essay on Money; Thoughts on American Liberty; The Druid, a collection of
essays on literary and social topics ; Lectures on Moral Philosophy; Lectures on Eloquence;
Ecclesiastical Characteristics ; The History of a Corporation of Servants; A Serious Enquiry
into the Nature and Effects of the Stage; Practical Discourses on the Leading Truths of the
Gospel, etc.

Witherspoon was born at Yester, Scotland, a lineal descendant from John Knox. and was
educated at the University of Edinburgh. He was a minister at Paisley, at the time of his
election to the Presidency of the College. He was President from 1768 to his death, 1794,
twenty-six years. He took an active part in Provincial affairs ; and represented the
Province of New Jersey in the Continental Congress, from 1776 to 1782. He was one of the
Signers of the Declaration of Independence.

Witherspoon was a ready deba.ter, and carried great weight, both in ecclesiastical and
political assemblies. He was remarkable for his wit, and often used it to the discomﬁture of
his opponents. He was through life active in the use of his pen, and his writings, though
less known now than formerly, exerted an important influence upon the men of his
generation.

One of the works which he published before leaving Scotland, Ecclesiastical Character-
istics, created a decided breeze. It was written to expose the character of what was known
as the Moderate party in the Church of Scotland, including such men as Blair, Robertson,
Campbell, and Gerard, and by its racy wit as well as by its solid argument gained for the
author great applause. Under the form of a defence of the worldly spirit and practices of
the Moderates, he assailed them with a merciless irony which penetrated between the very
joints of the harness. It was a species of attack to which there could be no reply, and from
which there was no escape. The following sentence is a specimen :

70 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

“Sometimes, indeed, it may happen, by a concurrence of circumstances, tha.t one of us
may, at bedtime, be unequally yoked with an orthodox brother, who may propose a little
unseasonable devotion between ourselves, before we lie down to sleep: but there are twenty
ways of throwing cold water upon such a motion; or, if it should be insisted upon, I
could recommend a moderate way of complying with it, from the example of one of our
friends, who, on a like occasion, yielded so far, that he stood up at the back of a chair, and
said, ‘O Lord, we thank thee for Mr. Bayle’s Dictionary. Amen.’ This was so far from
spoiling good company, that it contributed wonderfully to promote social mirth, and sweet-
ened the young men in a most agreeable manner for their rest.”

The Characteristics passed through ﬁve editions.
~ The History of a Corporation of Servants was a disguised narrative of the church-history
of Great Britain. The essay on the Stage originated in the publication of IIome’s Douglas.
Both these were written before he left Scotland.

When the invitation from America came, a rich bachelor friend_ offered to make Wither-
spoon heir to a large property if he would remain in Scotland. But he had already imbibed
those sentiments on religious and civil affairs which made him feel that America was his
true home; and from the day of his entrance into the New World until his death, he e1n-
barked with all his wealth of wit and wisdom and eloquence, in the cause of his adopted
country. No one thought, or “ thinks, of Witherspoon as a Briton, but as an American of
the Americans: as the friend of Stockton, the counsellor of Morris, the correspondent of
VVashington, the rival of Franklin in his Sagacity, and of Reed in his resolution; one of the
boldest in that Declaration of Independence, and one of the most revered in the debates of
C-ongress.”—Dr. James Alexamler.

During the latter part of his life, Witherspoon lived in a small country-seat, called Tuscu-
him, a little out of Princeton, on the slope of Rocky Hill. For the last two years of his life
he was blind. He retained the oﬂice of President until his death, but for several years his
duties in that connection were merely nominal, his son-in-law and successor, Dr. Smith,
being the acting President.

James Rivington.

JAMES RIVINGTON, 1725-1802, publisher of the New York Royal
Gazette, though not himself a literary man, occupies a conspicuous but
rather unenviable position in our Revolutionary literature.

New York city being, during most of the time, in the possession of the British, Riving-
t.on’s Gazette was the channel through which British officers and partisans carried on the
war of squibs against the “rebels.” The paper, though noted for lying, was conducted with
ability, and the Americans, stung to the quick by Rivington’s wasps, replied with equal
sarcasm. The literature thus engendered is one of the notable features of the times. Some
of the best effusions of Witherspoon, Freneau, and I-Iopkinson, were caused in this Way.

Rivington was originally a bookseller in London, where he amassed a fortune by trade,
but lost it by gambling. Failing in business, he came to America in 1760, and settled ﬁrst
in Philadelphia and afterwards in New York. In connection with his paper, he kept a book-
store. He had, before the war, made himself so obnoxious to the Aineri*wns, that in 1775 a
company of the “ Sons of Liberty” broke up his press and converted the type into bullets,
and he was at one time held under duress by order of the Continental Congress.

Rivington made himself so obnoxious, both to the Government and the people, that when
the British withdrew from New York, it was thought as a matter of course that he would
escape. Instead of that, he remained in the city and continued his business unmolested.
The circumstance excited some surprise, but the fact leaked out gradually that during the
latter days of the war, while Rivington was ﬁlling his paper with his most virulent attacks
upon the American cause, he was secretly acting as _a spy for Washington.

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. ‘71

Philip Freneau.

PHILIP FRENEAU, 1752~1832, was the ablest and most versatile of the
political humorists of the Revolutionary period. His contributions, both
prose and verse, to the newspapers, during and after the Revolution, were
very numerous, and were held in high repute. They included social and
literary topics, as well as those which were political; and many of them
were reprinted, from time to time, in book form.

Freneau was of French descent, a native of New York, and a graduate of Princeton, of the
class of 1771. Being a resident of New York in the years 177-l—’75, he wrote poetical satires
of the Tory leaders, which were an important aid to the popular cause.

iWhile at Princeton, he was the room-mate and classmate of James Madison, who con-
tinued to be his warm friend. He enjoyed also the friendship of Adams, Franklin, Jeffer-
son, and Monroe. In reward for his services as a political writer during the war of Inde-
pendence, he received an appoiiitnient from Jefferson as translator in the Department of
State.

In the beginning of the War, Freneau was captured by the British, and suffered in the
horrors of one of the infamous prison-ships in New York harbor. After the war he com-
manded for a time a vessel sailing out of Charleston, and he is often spokenof as Captain
Freneau.

As a political writer, after the war, Freneau took sides with Jefferson and the Republican
party, and against Hamilton and the Federals. He edited for a time the Daily Advertiser,
New York; then the National Gazette, Philadelphia, 1791-1793. Afterwards, he retired to
Mount Pleasant, near Middletown Point, New Jersey, where, in 1795, he started a small
paper of his own, the Jersey Chronicle, which continued about a year. His next venture
was in New York, where, in 1797, he began the Time Piece and Literary Companion.

Among Freneau’s prose Writings may be mentioned The Philosopher of the Forest, Essays
by Robert Slender, etc. Poetry, however, was the chief resource of his pen, and the pieces
which he wrote would, if collected, ﬁll several large volumes. Much’ of this was designed
for mere temporary effect, and passed away with the occasion which called it forth. Others
of his efforts had the genuine poetic afflatus, and deserve a permanent place in letters.

Several collections have been made at different times: The Poems of Philip Freneau, written
chieﬂy during the late war, 1‘2.mo, Philadelphia, 1786; The Miscellaneous Works of Philip Fre-
neau, containing his Essays and Additional Poems, 121110, 429 pp., Philadelphia, 1788; Poems
written between 1768 and 1794:, by Philip Freneau, of New Jersey, 8vo, 456 pp., Middletown
Point, N. J., 1795. This was a reprint of the two previous volumes, with additions, and
was issued from his own press. A similar reprint, with still further additions, appeared in
Philadelphia in 1809, in 2 vols. Another collection appeared in New York, in 1815, in 2 vols.,

l2mo, being A Collection of Poems on American Affairs, and on a Variety of Other Subjects, ,

chieﬂy Moral and Political, written between 1797 and l8l5.

Freneau lived to an advanced age, his last years being spent in retirement, at Mount
Pleasant, Monmouth County, New Jersey. He perished in a snow storm, near Freehold, in
that county, in 1832, in the eightieth year of his life.

THE NEW ENGLAND SABBATII-DAY CHASE.

On a ﬁne Sunday morning I mounted my steed,

And southward from Hartford had meant to proceed;
My baggage was stow’d in a cart very snug,

Which Ranger, the gelding, was fated to lug;

AMERICAN LITERATUREe

With his harness and buckles, he loom’d very grand,
And was drove by young Darby, a lad of the land—-
On land or on water, most handy was he;

A jockey on shore, ancla sailor at sea;

He knew all the roads, he was so very keen,

And the Bible by heart, at the age of ﬁfteen.

As thus I jogg’d on, to my saddleconfined,

With Ranger and Dm-by a distance behind;

At last in full View of a steeple we came,

With a cock on the spire,‘(I suppose he was game;
A dove in the pulpit may suit your grave people,
But always remember—a cock in the steeple.)

Cries Darby—“ Dear master, I beg you to -stay;
Believe me, there ’s danger in driving this way;

Our deacons on Sundays have power to arrest

And lead us to churcl1—if your honour thinks best:
Though still I must do them the justice ‘to tell,
They would choose you should pay them a ﬁne——ful1 as Well.”

“The ﬁne (said I), Darby, how much may it be--

A shilling or sixpence? Why, now let me see,

Three shillings are all the small pence that remain,

And to change a half joe would be rather PROFANE.

Is it more than three shillings, the ﬁne that you speak on?
What say you, good Darby, will that serve the deacon?” H

“ Three shillings!” (cried Darby) “ why, master, you ’re jesting!—-
Let us lajf while we can, and make sure of our westz'ng——

Forty Sltillﬁlgs, excuse me, is too much to pay.

It would take my month’s wages ——that ’s all I ’ve to _'say.

By taking this road that inclines to the right,

The squire and the sexton may bid us good night:

If once to old Ranger I give up the rein,

I The parson himself may pursue us in vain.”

“Not I, my good Darby (I answer’d the lad),

Leave the churcl1 on the left! they would think we were mad
I would sooner rely on the heels of my steed,

And pass by them all, like a Jelm indeed.

As long as I’m able to lead in the race,

Old Ranger, the gelding, will go a good pace;

As the deacon pursues, he will ﬂy like a swallow,

And you in the cart must undoubtedly follow.”

Then approaching the church, as we pass’d by the door,
The sexton peep’d out, with a saint or two more.

A deacon came forward and wav’d us his hat,

A signal todrop him some money——-mind that!

“Now, Darby, (I whispered) be ready to skip,

Ease off the curb bridle——give Ranger the whip:
While you have the rear, and myself lead the way,

No doctor or deacon shall catch us to-day.”

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 73

By this time the deacon had mounted his pony,

And chased for the sake of our souls and—-—our money:
The saint, as he followed, cried—“ Stop them, hallool”
As swift as he followed, as swiftly we ﬂew.

“Ah, master! (said Darby) I very much fear

We must drop him some money to check his career;
He is gaining upon us, and waves with his hat——
There ’s nothing, dear master, will stop him but that.
Since fortune all hope of escaping denies,

Better give them a little than lose the whole prize.”
But scarce had he spoke, when we came to a place,
Whose muddy condition concluded the chase.

Down settled the cart, and old Ranger stuck fast.
Aha! (said the saz'm,) hare I catch’0l ye at last?

The following is in a very different vein:

MAY TO APRIL.
I.

Without your showers
I breed no ﬂowers,
Each ﬁeld a barren waste appears;
If you don’t weep,
My blossoms sleep, ,
They take such pleasure in your tears.

II.

As your decay
Made room for May,
So I must part with all that ’s mine;
My balmy breeze,
My blooming trees,
To -torrid suns their sxveetsafesign.

III.
For April dead
My shade I spread,
To her I owe my dress so gay;
Of daughters three
It falls on me
To close our triumphs on one day.

IV.

Thus to repose
All naturegoes;
Month after month must ﬁnd its doom;
Time on the wing,
May ends the Spring,
And Summer frolics o’er her tomb.

In his Essays by Robert Slender is one giving Directions for Courtship,‘another contain-
ing Advice to Authors, etc. These various pieces are full of quiet satire, sharp as Wither-
spoon and practical as Franklin. Take the following:

74 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

“Never make a present of your works to great men. If they do not think them worth
purchasing, they will not think them worth reading.”

Hugh Henry Brackenridge.

_HUGH HENRY BRACKENRIDGE, 1748-1816, was one of the ablest humor-
ists of the Revolutionary period. His chief work, Modern Chivalr ,is
Worthy of a permanent place in literature. Its satire is keen and trench-
ant, and its sketches of life and manners in VVestern Pennsylvania give an
admirable picture of society in that region at the close of the last
century. '

Brackenridge was born in Scotland. He came at the age of ﬁve to America, and settled
with the rest of the familyin York County, Pennsylvania, near the border of l\Iaryland.
His opportunities for learning were meagre. A clergyman of the neighborhood gave mm
some help in making his first acquaintance with Latin and Greek. All the rest he had to
pick up as he could. Books were few, schools there were none. He thought nothing of a
tramp of twenty or thirty miles to secure the loan of a book or a newspaper. By teaching a.
district school he gained the means of taking himself to Princeton, where he was kindly re-
ceived by Dr. Witherspoon. While in college he sustained himself in the upper classes by
acting as tutor to the lower classes, and he graduated in 1771, in the same class with Madi-
son and Freneau. Among the Commencement exercises, on the occasion, was a poem on the
Rising Glory of America, the joint work of Brackenridge a.nd Freneau. The poem was in
the form of a dialogue, between Acasto and Eugenio, and was afterwards published.

Brackenridge, after graduation, taught an academy for several years in Maryland. VVhile
thus engaged, he wrote for his pupils a dramatic piece, called Bunker’s Hill, in ﬁve acts.
This was published in Philadelphia, in 1776, with a dedication to Richard Stockton of New
Jersey. Appended to this drama are two other patriotic poems, one An Ode on the Battle
of Bunker’s Ilill, the other A Song on W'ashington’s Victorious Entry into Boston.

In 1776, Brackenridge went to Philadelphia, and supported himself by editing the United
States Magazine. “At one time the magazine contained some severe strictures on the cele-
brated General Lee, and censured him for his conduct to VVashington. Lee, in a rage, called
at the office, in company with one or two of his aids, with the intention of assaulting the
editor; he knocked at the door, while Mr. Brackenridge, looking out of the upper story
Window, inquired what was wanting. ‘ Come down,’ said Lee, ‘ and I ’ll give you as good a
horse-whipping as any rascal ever received.’ ‘ Excuse me, general,’ said the other, ‘ I would
not go down for two such favors.’ ” '

Brackenridge studied for the ministry and was licensed to preach, but was never ordained.
He acted as chaplain in the Revolutionary army, and preached political sermons in the camp.
Six of -these sermons, printed in pamphlet form, had a large circulation. Finding after a
time that his inclinations and tastes were for a different kind of life, and not being entirely
satisﬁed on some points of doctrine, he declined ordination, and engaged in the practice of
the law. He settled himself, in 1781, in Pittsburg, a11d took an active part in the politics
of Western Pennsylvania. In 1799, he was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of Penn-
sylvania, and he filled the oﬂice until his death in 1816.

Brackenridge was mixed up to some extent with what was known as the Whiskey Insur- _

rection, in 1794, and he published, in the following year, an account of the affair, under the
title of Incidents of the Insurrection in the Western Parts of Pennsylvania. ,

The full titleof his chief work was Modern Chivalry, or the Adventures of Captain Far-.
rage, and Teague O’Regan, his Servant. The materials of the story are taken from his own
political experience. Captain Farrago was the author himself. Teague is a creation of his

own, in which some elements of the Irish character are used as a means of hitting off some
of the follies of the day. The ﬁrst part of Modern Chivalry was published at Pittsburg, in
1796. The second part appeared after an interval of ten years. The whole with the author’s
last corrections was issued in Pittsburg, in 1819, in 2 vols. A Philadelphia edition, with
illustrations by Darley, appeared in 1846.

CAPTAIN FARRAGrO’S REPLY TO A CHALLENGE.

Sir: I have two objections to this duel matter. The one is, lest I should hurt you; and
the other is, lest you should hurt me. I do not see any good it would do me to put a bullet
thro’ any part of your body. I could make no use of you when dead for any culinary pur-
pose, as I would a rabbit or turkey. I am no cannibal to feed on the ﬂesh of men. Why

then shoot down a human creature, of which I .could make no use? A buifaloe would be‘

better meat. For though your ﬂesh may be delicate and tender, yet it wants that ﬁrmness
and consistency which takes and retains salt. At any rate, it would not be ﬁt for long sea-
voyages. You might make a good barbacue, it is true, being of the nature of a raccoon or
an opossum; but people are not in the habit of barbacuing anything human now. As to
your hide, it is not worth taking off, being little better than that of a year old colt.

It would seem to me a strange thing to shoot at a man that would stand still to be shot at,
inasmuch as I have been heretofore ‘used to shoot at things ﬂying, or running, or jumping.
W'ere you on a tree now, like a squirrel, endeavouring to hide yourself in the branches, or
like a raccoon, that after much eyeing and spying, I observe at length in the crutch of a tall
oak, with boughs and leaves intervening, so that I could just get a sight of his hinder parts,
I should think it pleasural>le enough to ‘take a shot at you. But as it is, there is no skill
or judgment requisite either to discover or take you down. A

As to myself, I do not like to stand in the way of anything harmful. I am under" appre-
hensions you might hit me. That being the case, I think it most advisable to stay at some
distance. If you want to try your pistols, take some object, a tree or a barn-door, about my
dimensions.‘ If you hit that, send me word, and I shall acknowledge that if I had been in
the same place you might also have hit me. J. F.

Francis Hopkinson.

FRANCIS HOPKINSON, 1737-1791, was the author of many humorous
pieces, both prose and verse, which did good service to the popular cause.
Some of his productions, like The Battle of the Kegs, and his squibs on
Rivington, set the whole country in a roar.

Hopkinson was born in Philadelphia, and educated at the University of Pennsylvania.
After graduating, he spent two years in England. _ On returning to America, he settled in
Bordentown, New Jersey, and married there. He represented New Jersey in 1776 in the
Continental Congress, and was one of the signers of the Declaration. He was made Judge
of the Admiralty of Pennsylvania in 1779, and a Judge of the United States District Court
in 1790.

The best'known of I-Iopkinson’s poems are: The Battle of the Kegs, The Treaty, A Camp
Ballad, The New Roof; of his satirical pieces, The Typographical Method of Conducting a
Quarrel, Essay on Whitewashing, Modern Learning; of his political pieces, The Pretty Story,
The Prophecy, The Political Catechism. Hopkinson’s wit and audacity made him one of the
chief agents in educating the minds of the American people for independence.

“A poet, a wit, a patriot, a chemist, a mathematician. and a judge of the admiralty; his
character was composed of a happy union of qualities and endowments commonly supposed
to be discordant; and, with the humor of Swift and Rabelais, he was always found on the side
of virtue and social order.” —— Thomas J. Wharton.

76 AMERICAN LITERATURE.
The following extract from the Political Catechism will give some idea of Hopkinson’s
style in serious prose: ‘

FROM THE POLITICAL CATECI-IISM.

“ Who has the chief command of the American army ? —- His Excellency General Wash-
ington.

“ What is his character ?—To him the title of Excellency is applied with peculiar propriety.
He is the best and the greatest man the world ever knew. In private life he wins the hearts
and wears the love of all who are so happy as to fall within the circle of his acquaintance.
In his public character he commands universal respect and admiration. Conscious that the
principles on which he acts are indeed founded in virtue and truth, he steadily pursues the
arduous work with a mind neither depressed by disappointment and diﬂiculties, nor elated
with temporary successes. He retreats like a General, and attacks like a Hero. Had he
lived in the days of idolatry, he had been worshipped as a God.”

The humorous ballad of The Battle of the Kegs originated in the following incident. Cer-
tain machines, in the form of kegs, charged with gunpowder, were sent down the river to
annoy the British shipping then at Philadelphia. The danger of these machines being dis-
covered, the British manned the wharves and shipping, and discharged their small arms and
cannon at everything they saw ﬂoating in the river during the ebb tide.

TI-IE BATTLE OF THE KEGS.

Gallants attend and hear a friend
Trill forth harmonious ditty,

Strange things I ’ll tell which late befell
In Philadelphia city.

"T was early day, as poets say,
Just when the sun was rising,

A soldier stood on a log of wood,
And saw a thing surprising.

As in amaze he stood to gaze,
The truth can’t be denied, sir,
He spied a score of kegs or more
Come ﬂoating down the tide, sir.

A sailor, too, in jerkin blue,
This strange appearance viewing,
First damn’d his eyes, in great surprise,
Then said, “ Some mischief ’s brewing.

“ Those kegs, I ’m told, the rebels hold,
Pack’d up like pickled herring;

And they ’re come down t’ attack the town,
In this new way of ferrying.”

The soldiers ﬂew, the sailors too,
And scar’d almost to death, sir,

VVore out their shoes to spread the news,
And ran till out of breath, sir.

Now up and down throughout the town
Most frantic scenes wereacted;

And some ran here, and others there,
Like men almost distracted.

Some ﬁre cry’d, which some denied,
But said the earth had quaked;

And girls and boys, with hideous noise,
Ran thro’ the streets half naked.

Sir William he, snug as a ﬂea,
Lay all this time a snoring,

‘Now in a fright he starts upright,

iAwak’d by such a clatter;
He rubs both eyes, and boldly cries,
“ For God’s sake, what ’s the matter? ”

At his bed-side he then espy’d
Sir Erskine at command, sir,

Upon one foot he had one boot,
And th’ other in his hand, sir.

“Arise, arise I ” Sir Erskine cries,
“The rebels —more ’s the pity,

Without a boat are all aﬂoat,
And rang’d before the city.

“The motley crew, in vessels new,
With Satan for their guide, sir,
Pack’d up in bags, or wooden kegs,

Come driving down the tide, sir.

“ Therefore prepare for bloody war,
These kegs must all be routed,

Or surely we despised shall be,
And British courage doubted.”

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 77

The royal band now ready stand,
All rang’d in dread array, sir,
With stomach stout to see it out,
And make a bloody day, sir.

The cannons roar from shore to shore,
The small arms make a rattle;

Since wars began I ’m sure no man
E’er saw so strange a battle.

The rebel dales, the rebel vales,
With rebel trees surrounded;

The distant woods, the hills and ﬂoods,
With rebels echoes sounded.

The ﬁsh below swam to and fro,
Attack’d from every quarter;

The kegs, ’t is said, tho’ strongly made
Of rebel staves and hoops, sir,

Could not oppose their powerful foes,
The conq’ring British troops, sir.

From morn to night those men of might
Display’d amazing courage;

And when the sun was fairly down,
Retir’d to sup their porrage.

An hundred men, with each a pen
Or more, upon my word, sir,

It is most true, would be too few
Their valor to record, sir.

Such feats did they perform that day,
Against those wicked kegs, sir,

Why sure, thought they, the devil ’s to pay That years to come, if they get home,
’Mongst folks above the water. They ’ll make their boasts and brags, sir.

John Trumbull.

JOHN TRUMBULL, LL; D., 17 50—1831, the author of numerous works, is
chieﬂy known by his poem of MoFingal, a work in the style of Hudibras,
and intended to hold the British up to ridicule.

Trumbull was born in Woodbury, Ct., and graduated at Yale, in the class of 1767. He
studied law for a time with John Adams, in Boston, and afterwards returned to Connecticut
to practise. V In 1781 he settled in Hartford. He was a member of the Legislature in 1800,
and a Judge of the Superior Court from 1801 to 1819. He went to Detroit in 1825, and died
there. He published many humorous articles, prose and verse, and three extended works
of humor, The Progress of Dulness, a satire on the prevailing mode of education; An Elegy
on the Times; and lVIcFingal, an Epic Poem. The work last named is his chief poem. It is
Hudibrastic in metro and style, and is intended to lash the Tories. McFingal was published
in 1775, and was immensely popular. More than thirty editions of it were published. John
Adams predicted that it would “live as long as Hudibras.” Its popularity, however, has
proved to be temporary. “It owes its decadence, not to a deﬁciency in genuine wit and
humor of the Hudibrastic school, but to the lack of picturesqueness in the story, and of all
elements of permanent interest in its heroes.” -1))‘. Peabody, in the N. A. Review.

Joel Barlow.

JOEL BARLOW, 1755-1812, gained a rather unenviable notoriety by his
ambitious attempt at a great American epic, _Tl1e Columbiad.

Barlow was a native of Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale, of the class of 1778. He
engaged actively in the war of Independence, part of the time as a soldier and part of the
time as chaplain. At the close of the war he engaged in the profession of the law, and
edited for a time a weekly newspaper, The American Mercury, at Hartford. He was em-
ployed, in 1785, by the General Association of Connecticut to revise and supplement Watts’s
version of the Psalms, adapting them for the use of the churches. ‘He was afterwards em-
ployed by the general government in various foreign negotiations; and in 1811 was minister
plenipotentiary to the French Court. ' '

Barlow was the author of several literary works, but his chief performance was The C0-

7*

78 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

lumbiad, an epic poem of great length. It is composed of a series of Visions, in which
Hesper, the genius of the western continent, reveals to Columbus in prison the future his-
tory of the new world. The work was published in 1808, in a style of great elegance, and
ushered into notice with due heralding; but it failed to live. Its merits were so far short
of its pretensions that it only provoked ridicule. “ In sketching the history of America from
the days of Manco Oapac down to the present day, and a few thousand years lower, the
author, of course, cannot spare timeito make us acquainted with any one individual. The
most important personages, therefore, appear but once upon the scene, and then fall away
and are forgotten. Mr. Barlow’s exhibition accordingly partakes more of the nature of a
procession, than of a drama. River gods, sachems, majors of militia, all enter at one side of
his stage, and go off at the other, never to return. Rocha and Oella take up as much room
as Greene and Washington ; and the rivers Potowmak and Delaware, those ﬂuent and ven-
erable personages, both act and talk a great deal more than J eiferson and Franklin.’7 —Jef-
frey, in Eclinburgh Review.

The most popular of Barlow’s works was a poem, called Hasty Pudding, written while he
was abroad, and containing a good deal of genuine humor.

President Stiles.

EZRA STILES, D. D., LL. D., 1727-1795, President of Yale College, pub-
lished among other things A History of Three of the Judges of King
Charles I.,—- Whalley, Croife, and Dixwell.

President Stiles was a man of extraordinary intellectual activity, as well as of great purity
of character, and his administration of Yale College _was one of distinguished success.
He was born at North Haven, and graduated at Yale, in the class of 1746. He became Presi-
dent in 1777. Besides the work in regard to the three regicide Judges, he published numer-
ous Discourses, both English and Latin, and he left unﬁnished an Ecclesiastical History of
New England, and a great many other manuscripts. “Take him for all in all, this extraor-
dinary man was undoubtedly one of the purest and best-gifted men of his age.” — C’hcmcello7-
Kent.

President Dwight.

TIMOTHY DWIGHT, D. D., 1752-1817, President of Yale College, was
almost equally distinguished as a theologian and “a man of letters, while for
skill and ability inthe administration of the affairs of the’College, he is
justly regarded as a model President.

Dr. Dwight seems to-be on the border line between the last century and the present. But
as the larger part of his intellectual activity is connected with the -affairs of the last century.
he has been included in the present chapter. 1

Dwight was a native of Northampton, Mass., and a grandson, on the mother’s side. of the
famous Dr. Jonathan Edwards. He entered Yale College at the age of thirteen, and gradu-
ated with distinction in the class of 1769. He was a chaplain in the army during the war of
Independence, and after several years of pastoral service, became President of Yale College.
He continued in that office from 1795 till the time of his death; and by his learning and his
abilities as a preacher, a lecturer, and an administrator, acquired a reputation coextensive
almost with the civilized world.

Dwight’s principal work is his Theology, 5 vols., 8vo. He published. Travels in New Eng-
land and New York, 4 vols., containing notes of things which he had observed during a
course of years in his summer vacations. He published also Sermons and Addresses on
Special Occasions, 2 vols. In addition to his theological works, Dr. Dwight published sev-

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 79

eral poems: America, a poem in the style of Pope’s Windsor Forest; The Conquest of Ca-
naan, an epic in eleven books; Greenﬁeld Hill, a poem; The Triumph of Inﬁdelity, a satire.
Among his literary labors should be mentioned his revision of Watts’s Psalms. The
revision by Barlow not being satisfactory, the General Association committed the work of
further revision to Dr. Dwight. In this work, he added translations of his own, of such
Psalms as Watts had not attempted, and annexed a selection of Hymns. The work was ap-
proved and adopted, not only by the Association, but also by the General Assembly of the
Presbyterian Church. Dwight’s version of the 139th Psalm, beginning with the words,

I love thy kingdom, Lord,
has been a general favorite.
Dwight’s satirical poem, The Triumph of Inﬁdelity, 1788, was occasioned by the rampant
inﬁdelity then prevalent, particularly in France. It is dedicated very appropriately to the
arch inﬁdel of that age.

DEDICATION TO VOLTAIRE.

“ Sir, your Creator endued you with shining talents, and cast your lot in the ﬁeld of action I

where they might be most happily employed. In the progress of a long and industrious
life, you devoted them to a single purpose, the elevation of your character above His. For
the accomplishment of this purpose, with a diligence and uniformity which would have
adorned the most virtuous pursuits, you opposed truth, religion, and their authors, with
sophistry, contempt, and obloquy: and taught, as far as your example or sentiments ex-
tended their inﬂuence, that the chief end of man was, to slander his God, and abuse him
forever._ To whom could such an effort as the following be dedicated with more propriety
than to you ?”

The following passage from this satire would make a good companion picture to some of
the sketchesvin Withcrspoon’s Ecclesiastical Characteristics:

T HE SMOOTH DIVINE.

There smil’d the smooth Divine, unus’d to wound
The sinner’s heart with hell’s alarming sound.‘

No terrors on his gentle tongue attend;

No grating truths the nicest ear offend.

That strange new-birth, that methodistic grace,

Nor in his heart nor sermons found a place.

Plato’s ﬁne tales he clumsily retold,

Trite, ﬁreside, moral seesaws dull as old;

His Christ, and Bible, plac’d at good remove,

Guilt hell-deserving, and forgiving love.

’Twas best, he said, mankind should cease to sin;
Good fame requir’d it; so did peace within:

T-heir honours, well he knew, would ne’er be driven,
But hop’d they still would please to go to heaven.
Each week he paid his visitation dues;

Coax’d, jested, laugh’d; rehears’d the private news;
Smok’d with each goody, thought her cheese eXce11’d;
Her pipe he lighted, and her baby held.

Or plac’d in some great town, with lacquer’d shoes,
Trim wig, and trimmer gown, and glistening hose,
He bow’d, talk’d politics, le.arn’d manners mild;

Most meekly question’d, and most smoothly smil’d;
At rich men’s jests laugh’d loud, their stories prais’d;
Their wives’ new patterns gaz’d, and gaz’d, and gaz’d;

Most daintily on pamper’d turkies din’d;

Nor shrunk with fasting, nor with study pin’d;

Yet from their churches saw his brethren driven,
Who thunder’d truth, and spoke the voice of heaven,_
Chill’d trembling guilt in Satan’s headlong path,
Charm’d the feet back, and roused the ear of death.
.“ Let fools,” he cried, “starve on, while prudent I
Snug in my nest shall live, and snug shall die.”

JACOB Ducﬂﬁ, D. D»., 1739-1798, was a native of Philadelphia, and rector of Christ’s Church
and of St. Peter’s in that city. His pulpit oratory was greatly admired, and two volumes of
his Sermons have been printed. He deserted the cause of Independence, and wrote a Letter
to Washington urging him.to do likewise. He went over to England during the war, but
returned to Philadelphia afterwards.

SAMUEL CURWEN, 1715-1802, was a native of Salem, Mass., and a graduate of Harvard, of the
class of 1735. He became Judge of the Admiralty. Not sympathizing with the popular cause,
he was obliged to take refuge in England, but returned after the war and lived unmolested
in his native town until his death. While in England, he kept a journal, giving an account
of his experiences. He appears to have been something of a gossip,’ seeing with insatiable
curiosity whatever was to be seen, and recording with diligence what he saw. Besides
chatty interviews with the facetious Joseph Green, ex-Governor Hutchinson, and other refu-
gees, we have lively sketches of “John Wes1ey’s Preachment,” of Charles James Fox, and
various other English celebrities. His work, sent in _,detached pieces to his nieces, was

printed in 1842, with the title, Journal and Letters of the late Samuel Curwen,, Judge of

Admiralty, an American Refugee in England, from 1775 to 1784.

Mather Byles.

MATHER BYLES, D. D., 1706—17 88, an eloquent preacher of Boston, had
a great reputation as a wit and a poet.

Byles was descended on the mother’s side from old Richard Mather and"John Cotton. He
was a man of rare eloquence as a preacher, and some of his sermons have gone through
repeated editions. In the earlier part of his life, he published several poems, which were
well received, and he was throughout life celebrated for his wit. In punning and lively
repartee, he especially excelled.

Byles was a loyalist, but does not seem to have been active on the Tory side. Neutrality,
however, was not tolerated in those times, and Byles was obliged to give up his church He
was put under arrest, and ordered to go to England. The order, however, was not carried
out, and Byles died in Boston in retirement.

Byles was well known in England in his day, among his correspondents being Pope, Watts,
and others. He received from Pope a handsome copy of his Odyssey in quarto.

He published the following poems: O11 the Death of Lady Belcher; On the Death of the
Queen; An Elegy on the Death of Daniel Oliver; The Comet; The Conﬂagration ; The God
of Tempest, etc.

Some ‘contemporary verses by one of the wags of the day show Byles’s reputation for pun-
ning and repartee.

There ’s punning Byles provokes our smiles,
A man of stately parts;

He visits folks to crack his jokes,
Which never mend their hearts.

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 81.

With strutting gait and wig so great,
He walks a.1ong the streets;

And throws out wit, or what ’s like it,
To every one he meets.

In 1780 occurred a day known as “the dark day.” A lady sent her son into his house to
inquire the cause of the darkness. “My dear,” said the Doctor, “tell your mother that I
am as much in the dark as she is.”

When the British troops, or “ red coats,” marched into Boston, “Ah,” said Byles, “ now
our grievances will be red—dressed.”

Joseph Green.

JOSEPH GREEN, 17064780, is associated. with Byles, as one of the humor-
ists of the day. Green was a native of Boston and a graduate of Harvard.
He was _a distiller by trade, and amassed a large fortune. He did not en-
gage actively in politics, but used his pen freely on social subjects, for the

amusement of the town. His writings were mostly in verse, and of the

humorous kind. His satire, so far as it touched on political affairs, was
used on the side of freedom, but he was disinclined to turmoil, and in 1775,
when it was evident that hostilities were about to begin, he went to England
for repose, and remained there until his death.

Some brother wag, in 1743, wrote a humorous "epitaph on Green, which
shows the popular estimate of him:

Siste, Viator: here lies one

Whose life was whim, whose soul was pun,
And if you go too near his hearse,

He ‘ll joke you, both in prose and verse.

Byles and Green had many a friendly tilt. One of Green’s best essays in this line was a
mock heroic poem on the death of Byles’s favorite cat. This pet of the good Doctor’s was
called his Muse, and it was said he never felt the inspiration of song unless Pussy was some-
where about his chair.

TEE PoET’s LAMENTATION ron THE Loss or HIS CAT, WHICH HE USED TO CALL HIS MUSE.
Felis qaedam delicium erat cujusdam Adolescentis.-—&'so10.

Oppress’d with grief, in heavy strains I mourn
The partner of my studies from me torn.

How shall I sing? what numbers shall I chuse?
For in my fav’rite cat I’ve lost my muse.

No more I feel my mind with raptures ﬁr’d,

I want those airs that Puss so oft inspir’d;

No crowding thoughts my ready fancy ﬁll,

Nor words run ﬂuent from my easy quill;

Yet shall my verse deplore her cruel fate,

And celebrate the virtues of my cat.

82 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

She neverthirsted for the chickens’ blood;
Her teeth she only used to chew her food;
Harmless as satires which her master writes,
A foe to scratching, and unused to bites,

She in the study was my constant mate;

There we together many evenings sate.
Whene’er I felt my tow’ring fancy fail,

I stroked her head, her ears, her back, her tail;
And as I stroked improv’d my dying song
From the sweet notes of her melodious tongue:
Her purrs and mews so evenly kept time,

She purr’d inmetre, and she niew’d in rhyme.
But when my dulness has too stubborn prov’d,
Nor could by Puss’s music be remov’d,

Oft to the well-known volumes have I gone,
And stole a line from Pope or Addison.
Ofttimes when lost amidst poetic heat,

She leaping on my knee has took her seat:
There saw the throes that rock’d my 1ab’ring brain,
And lick’d and claw’d me to myself again.

Then, friends, indulge my grief, and let me mourn,
My cat is gone, ah! never to return.

Now in my study all the tedious night

Alone I sit, and unassisted write;

Look often round (0 greatest cause of pain),

And view the num’rous labors of my brain;
Those quires of words array’d in pompous rhyme,
Which brave the jaws of all-devouring time,

Now undefended and unwatch’d by cats,

Are doom’d a victim to the teeth of rats.

Samuel Peters.

‘ SAMUEL PETERS, 1735-1826, a clergyman of Connecticut who was obliged
to leave the country on account of his Tory opinions, retaliated on his per-
secutors by publishing a pretended General History of Connecticut.

Peters is the man referred to in McFingal as “ Parson Peters.” His work has all the ap
pearance of a veritable history, and by many was received as such. It is not certain, indeed,
whether he intended it as a piece of waggery, like Knickerbocker’s History of New York, or
whether it was written in a ﬁ-t of spleen. If the latter, his misrepresentations are so patent
 to have no effect except to turn the laugh upon himself. The work altogether is a curi-
osity. Two short extracts are given. The first is a scrap of physical geography that will
probably be new even to Prof. Guyot.

NARROWS IN THE CONNECTICUT RIVER.

“ Two hundred miles from the Sound is a narrow of ﬁve yards only, formed by two shelving
mountains of solid rock, whose tops intercept the clouds. Through this chasm are com-
pelled to pass all the waters which in the time_of the ﬂoods bury_the northern country. At

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 83

the upper cohos the river then spreads several miles wide, and for ﬁve or six weeks ships of
War might sail over lands that afterwards produce the greatest crops of hay and grain in all
America. People who can bear the sight, the groans, t.he tremblings, and surly motion of
water, trees, and ice through this awful passage, view with astonishment one of the greatest
phenomenons in nature. Here water is consolidated, without frost, by pressure, by swift-
ness, between the pinching, sturdy rocks, to such a degree of induration that an iron crow
ﬂoats smoothly down its current:—here iron, lead, and cork have one common weight: -
here, steady as time, and harder than marble, the stream passes, irresistible, if not swift as
lightning: —the electric ﬁre rends trees in pieces with no greater ease than does this
mighty water. The passage is about four hundred yards in length, and of a zigzag form,
with obtuse corners.”

The following piece of natural history is equally remarkable:

THE FROGS OF VVINDIIAM.

“ Strangers are very much terriﬁed at the hideous noise made on summer evenings by the
vast number of frogs in the brooks and ponds. There are about thirty different voices
among them; some of which resemble the bellowing of a bull. The owls and whippoor-
wills complete the rough concert, which may be heard several miles. Persons accustomed
to such Serenades are not disturbed by them at their proper stations; but one night in July,
1758, the frogs of an artiﬁcial pond, three miles square, and about ﬁve from Windham, ﬁnd-
ing the water dried up, left the place in a body, and marched, or rather hopped towards
Winnomantic River. They were under the necessity of taking the road_and going through
the town, which they entered about midnight. The bull frogs were the leaders, and the
pipers followed without number. They ﬁlled a road forty yards wide for four miles in length,
and were for several hours in passing through the town, unusually clamorous. The inhabi-
tants were equally perplexed and frightened ; some expected to ﬁnd an army of French and
Indians ; others feared an earthquake, and dissolution of nature. The consternation was uni-
versal: old and young, male and female, fled naked from their beds with worse shrieking than
those of the frogs. The event was fatal to_ several women. The men, after a ﬂight of half
a mile, in which they met with many broken shins, ﬁndingno enemies in pursuit of them,
made a halt, and summoned resolution enough to venture back to their wives and children ;
when they distinctly heard from the enemy’s camp these words: Wight, Ililcler/ten, Dier, Tate.
The last they thought meant treaty, and plucking up courage, they sent a triumvirate to
capitulate with the supposed French and Indians. Those three men approached in their
shirts, and begged to speak to the general; but it being dark, and no answer given, they
were sorely agitated for some time, betwixt hope and fear; at length, however, they discov-
ered that the dreaded inimical army was an army of thirsty frogs going to the river for a
little water.”

Peters was a native of Hebron, Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale, of the class of 1757.
He was ordained in England, and returning to Connecticut, preached in Hebron and other
places. As he was opposed to the Revolution, and was suspected of being in correspondence
with the enemy, he was obliged to ﬂee to England. He returned to America in 1805, and
settled in New York, where he lived until his death, in his ninety-ﬁrst year. He was an
odd genius, and he Wrote many things, both in England and America. But the History
of Connecticut, whatever may have been his design, was the most remarkable.

BENJAMIN YOU-NGIPRIME, M. D., 1733-1791, was a native of Huntington, Long Island, and a
graduate of Princeton, of the class of l751. He studied medicine at Leyden, and was versed
in French and Spanish, as well as in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. He had the pen of a ready
Writer, and during the Revolutionary period helped to uphold his country’s cause by patri-
otic songs and ballads. Dr. Prime’s ﬁrst poetical works were produced before the war of
Independence. The Patriot Muse, published in London in 1764, is a collection containing

poems on Bradd_ock’s Defeat, on the taking of Quebec, on Gov. Belcher of New Jersey, and
on President Burr of Princeton, etc. The ode on the capture of Quebec is called Britain’s
Glory, or Gallia’s Pride Humbled. In 1791, he published a long poem of 1441 lines, intended
in part as a parody of this, and called Columbia’s Glory, or British Pride Humbled.

Dr. Prime was the grandfather of the gentlemen of that name who publish the New York
Observer. The men of that family for ﬁve generations have been college-bred men, and
nearly all of them have been ministers.

Governor Livingston.

WILLIAM LIVINGSTON, LL. D., 1723-17 90, Governor of New Jersey, was
one of the most effective writers of the times. He wrote a poem, called
Philosophic Solitude, and several series of Essays on political and social
questions. I

These Essays were modelled in some respects after The Spectator. One series bore the
name of The I_ndependent Reﬂector; another was called The Watch Tower; another, The
Sentinel; another, The American Whig; still another, The Primitive Whig.

Livingston was born in Albany, and was graduated ‘at Yale, in 1741, at the head of his
class. He studied law in the city'of New York, and remained there until 1772, when he
retired to a country-seat at Elizabethtown, New Jersey. During his long residence in New
York, he took an active part in nearly all public measures. He published, in 1757, A Review
of the Military Operations in North America, being intended as a defence of Gov. Shirley.
He published in the same year A Funeral Eulogium on Aaron Burr, President of the College
of New Jersey. One of his essays that made some stir was entitled A New Sermon on an
Old Text, “ Touch not Mine Anointed.” Livingston undertook to show that the “anointed ”
spoken of are not monarchs, but the people.

When the J erseymen had sent Governor Franklin out of the State, Livingston was in 1776
elected Governor of New J ersey, and continued to be elected annually until the time of his
death. He was a brother of the Philip Livingston who signed the Declaration of Independ-
ence as a delegate from New York.

Governor Hutchinson.

THOMAS HUTCHINSON, 1711-1780, royal Governor of Massachusetts at
the time of the outbreak of the Revolution, contributed to the literature of
the day A History of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay.

Hutchinson’s History begins with “ the first settlement in 1628,” and is brought down to
the year 1774. It is in 3 vols., of which two were published during his life, and the third,
left in manuscript and containing the history from 1750 to 1774, was printed in England,
in 1823. '

Hutchinson was a descendant from the celebrated Ann Hutchinson. He was a native of
Boston, and a graduateiof Harvard, of the class of 1727. He took an active part in all colo-
nial affairs, rising gradually to the oﬁice of Governor. In consequence of his leaning to the
English side, in the controversy between the Colonies and the mother country, he became
very unpopular, and was obliged ﬁnally to take refuge in England, where he received a pen-
sion, bu-t was treated otherwise with neglect. _ ‘

CHARLES THOMSON, 1729-1824, the patriot Secretary of the Continental Congress, was born
in Ireland. He emigrated to America at the age of eleven and settled in Philadelphia. He
was educated by Rev. Francis Alison, and afterwards taught the Friends’ Academy, in Phila-

delphia. He was Secretary to the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1789. He died in
Lower Merion, ‘near Philadelphia, in the ninety-ﬁfth year of his age. He wrote A Transla-
tion of. the Bible, 4 vols., 8vo, the Old Testament being translated from the Septuagint; An
Inquiry into the Cause of the Alienation of the Delaware and Shawanese Indians.

Fisher Ames.

FISHER AMES, 1758-1808, contributed much, by his writings and speeches,
towards the consolidation of the Government, after the war of Independence.

Ames was born at_Dedham, Massachusetts, and was graduated at Harvard, in the class of
1774. He was a ﬁne classical scholar and a brilliant writer, as well as an impressive speaker.
He belonged to the Federal party, a11d was an active and inﬂuential statesman during the
administration of Washington. His works have been published in 2 vols., 8vo. They con-
sist mainly of speeches and essays, and are models of style.

I11 all the writings of this period, there are none that exceed those of Fisher Ames in
vigor of thought and expression. He was remarkable for the aptness of his classical allu-
sions and for the frequency and beauty of his comparisons. These are so numerous, indeed,
that the reader would weary of them as needless ornament, were it not for the intense ear-
nestness that everywhere breathes through the glowing periods. _

Fisher Ames was a devout admirer of Alexander HamiltOn,and deplored his untimely loss
in terms of almost passionate eloquence. “It is not as Apollo, enchanting the shepherds

‘ with his lyre, that we deplore him; it is as Hercules, treacherously slain in the midst of his

unﬁnished labors, leaving the world overrun with monsters.” “The tears that ﬂow on this
fond recital will never dry up. My heart, penetrated with the remembrance of the man,
grows liquid as I write, and I could pour it out like water. I could weep, too, for my coun-
try, which’, mournful as it is, does not know the half of its loss. It deeply laments, when it
turns its eyes back and sees what Hamilton was ; but my soul stiffens with despair when I
think what Hamilton would have been.” A

JOHN WINTHROP, LL.D., 1714-1779, a descendant in the fourth generation from the ﬁrst
Governor of Massachusetts, old John Wintlirop, was born in Boston, and graduated at Har-
vard, in the class of 1732. From 1738 to 1779 he was Hollis Professor of Mathematics and
Natural Philosophy, and he twice declined the Presidency of the College. He published A
Lecture on Earthquakes; Two Lectures on Comets; A Voyage to Newfoundland to observe
the Transit of ‘Venus, in 1761; Two Lectures on the Parallax and Distance of the Sun, as de-
ducible frOn1 the Transit of Venus, etc. He took an active part in the struggle for Inde-
pendence. '

Benjarnin Rush.

BENJAMIN RUSH, M. D., 1745-1813, besides his medica.l writings, which
placed him in the front rank in his profession, wrote much on popular sub-
jects, and took an active part in various ways in the struggle for national
independence.

Dr. Bush was born near Philadelphia, and graduated at Princeton, in the class of 1760.

He studied medicine afterwards at Edinburgh, Paris, and London, and in 17 69 was appointed V

a professor in the medical school of the University of Pennsylvania. During the War of the
Revolution, Dr. Rush was appointed Surgeon and Physician General for the Hospitals of the
Middle States. He took a prominent part in politics, being an ardent supporter of the Revo-
lution and one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He was also a member

of the State Convention that adopted the Constitution of the United States. During the last
fourteen years of his life he was Treasurer of the U. S. Mint.

1 In 1793, while Philadelphia was visited with the yellow fever, Dr. Rush distinguished him-
self by his successful practice and his spirit of devotion. For this and for other medical
services, he was honored with presents from the King of Prussia and the Emperor of
Russia. _

Dr. Rush’s works have been collected and published in 7 vols., 8vo. The ﬁrst six are upon
topics of medicine or hygiene. Volume seven contains his Essays, Literary, Moral, and
Philosophical. Besides these original works, Dr. Rush also edited the works of Sydenham,
and numerous detached medical treatises. It is estimated that more than twoithousand
medical pupils were instructed by pim in the University of Pennsylvania.

ANTHONY BENEZET, 1713-1784, a member of the Society of Friends, was born in France, but
was mainly resident in Philadelphia, to which he came in 1731, and in which he taught
school. He published A Caution to Great Britain and her Colonies, on the subject of slavery,
in 1767, and an Historical Account of Guinea, in 1772, giving the rise and progress of the
slave-trade. The works of this philanthropist are said to have ﬁrst awakened the attention
of Clarkson and Wilberforce to this subject. Some interesting anecdotes of this good man
were published by Dr. Rush.

THOMAS GODFREY, 1736-1763, a native of Philadelphia and a son of the Godfrey who in-
vented the “ Quadrant,” was the author of several poems of some note. Among these were
The Prince of Parthia, a drama; The Court of Fancy, a poem modelled after Chaucer’s House
of Fame; and other smaller pieces. ’

John Dickinson.

JOHN DICKINSON, 1732-1808, was one of the leading publicists in Penn-
sylvania in the controversy between the Colonies and the mother coun-
try, before and during the war of Independence. Many of the state papers
of that period which elicited such glowing eulogy from Chatl1am,Were
Written by.Dickinson.

Dickinson was born in Maryland, but lived chieﬂy in Delaware. He studied law in Phil-
adelphia, and afterwards in London.

Among the papers written by Dickiirson were the celebrated Petition to the King; The Sec-
ond Petition to the King; Letters from a Pennsylvania Farmer to the Inhabitants of the
British Colonies, written in 1767-8 ; Letters of Fabius, 17 88, intended to promote the adop-
tion of the Constituti_on; Letters of Fabius, 1797, intended to promote a friendly feeling
towards France. His political writings were collected and published in 2 vols., 8v0.

“ The Petition to the King won the highest admiration on both sides of the Atlantic, and
will remain an imperishable monument to the glory of its author, and of the assembly of
which he was a member, so long as fervid and manly eloquence, and chaste and elegant com-
position shall be appreciated.” —- Thomas A. Budd.

“Mr. Dickinson’s style was distinguished by perspicuity, vigor, and a ﬂowing eloquence
admirably suited to the exciting topics which commanded his pen.” --Allibone.

PELATIAH WEBSTER, 1725-1797, was born at Lebanon, Ct., and graduated at Yale, in the
class of 1746. He preached for some years in Massachusetts. In 1755, he went to Philadel-
phia, embarked i11 business, and amassed a fortune. Being an active patriot, he was thrown
into prison by the British when they had possession of Philadelphia. He wrote several

essays on public affairs: On the Redemption of the Continental Money ; On Free Trade and
Finance; On Credit, explaining the theory on which banks are founded; On the Restoration

' of the Charter to the Bank-of North America; On the Political Union of the Thirteen

States, etc.

GEN. JOSEPH REED, 1741-1785, was a native of Trentdn, N. J., and a graduate of Princeton,
of the class of,1757. General Reed was in active service in the war of Independence; was
a Member of Congress in 1777; and President of Pennsylvania from 1778 to 1781. He pub-
lished several pamphlets of a controversial character: Remarks on Gov. Johnstone’s Speech
in Parliament ; Remarks on a Late Publication in the Independent Gazetteer, etc. His Life
and Correspondence, in 2 vols., 8vo, has been published by his grandson, Wm. B. Reed.

David Ramsay.

DAVID RAMSAY, M. D., 1749—1815, was the earliest American historian
of note. His chief works are A History of the United States, and A His-
tory of South Carolina.

Ramsay was born in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and graduated at Princeton, in the
class of 1765. He studied medicine in Philadelphia, and in 1773 went to Charleston, South
Carolina, to practise, and continued to reside there the remainder of his days. He was an
accomplished scholar, and was universally esteemed for the purity of his life, and for his
patriotic and benevolent labors. He was for many years a member of the South Carolina
Legislature, and for three years, 1782-5, a member of the National Congress, and a part of
the time its President. He married ﬁrst a daughter of President Witherspoon, of Princeton
College, and afterwards a daughter of Henry Laurens, of South Carolina. He was shot by a
lunatic in the streets of Charleston. 2
' Dr. Ramsay’s works are the following: A History of the Revolution of South Carolina; A
History of South Carolina, from its Settlementin 1670 to the Year 1808, 2 vols., 8vo; A His-
tory of the American Revolution, 2 vols., 8vo; A History of the United States, from 1607 to
1808, 3 vols., 8vo; Universal History Americanized, or An Historical View of the World from.
the Earliest Records to the Nineteenth Century, 12 vols., 8vo, the ﬁrst three volumes of the
collection being the History of the United States just mentioned. This work sprang from
a desire to give an abridgment of the old Universal History, in 65 vols. The project was a
failure. Besides these Histories, Dr. Ramsay wrote A Life of Washington, which was in the
main an abridgment of Marshall’s; Memoirs of Mrs. Martha Laurens Ramsay; A History
of the Congregational "Church in Charleston, and numerous Orations, Addresses, and Pam-
phlets of various kinds. ,

Dr. Ramsay did not rise to the dignity of a classical historian. His works are wanting in
artistic treatment. But they are eminently truthful and accurate, and they can never be
safely ignored by those who wish to be well acquainted with the history of the United States.
He had the advantage of living in close relationship to the affairs which he describes, and
in many of them he was an eye-witness and an actor; and he has withal, like John Marshall,
that character for entire honesty and for sobriety of judgment, which makes his testimony,
and in most cases also his opinions, authoritative and ﬁnal.

WILLIAM HENRY DRAYTON, 17424779, was a native of South Carolina, and one of the lead-
ing men who brought about the struggle for American Independence, and was a member of
the Continental Congress at the time of his death. He compiled a History of the American
Revolution.—JoHN DRAYTON, 1760-1822, son of William Henry Drayton and Governor of
South Carolina. He wrote A View of South Carolina; and also edited the History of the
American Revolution, left in MS. by his father. ‘

Independence, wrote a valuable historical Work, Memoirs of the VVar in
the Southern Department of the United States.

Lee was a native of Virginia, and a graduate of Princeton, of the class of 1773. He was
appointed by Congress to pronounce the Funeral Oration on -the Death of Vfashington. In
this oration occurs the phrase, which originated with Lee, “ First in war, ﬁrst in peace, first

the University of Pennsylvania, in 1765, and was ordained in England, as deacon in 1770, as

priest in 1772, and as bishop in 1787. He was assistant of Christ Church and of St. Petcr’s,
Philadelphia, from 1772 to 1779, and rector of both from 1779 to his death in 1836. He was

elected Bishop of Pennsylvania in 1786, and became senior Bishop on the death of Bishop
Seabury, in 1796. He was chaplain to the Continental Congress during its sessions in Phila-

delphia in 1777.

Bishop White published the following works: The Case of the Episcopal Church in the
United States Considered; Lectures on the Catechism of the Episcopal Church ; Compara-
tive View of the Controversy between the Calvinists and the Armini-ans; Memoir of the
Episcopal Church in the United States; Commentary on the Offices for the Ordaining of
Priests and Deacons.

Bishop White was a man of great moderation and good sense, and was revered by men of
all denominations.

SAMUEL SEABURY, D. D., 1729-1796, was consecrated as Bishop of Connecticut in 1784, and
was the first Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States. He published
two volumes of Sermons, besides occasional Discourses. “U Seabury was a man of strong na-
tive powers, of cultivated intellect, and extensive inﬂuence, and ardent in the cause of
Episcopacy.” — Dr. John W. Francis.

WILLIAM SMITH, D.D.,1727—1803, was a native of Aberdeen, Scotland, and a graduate of
the University of that place, -in the class of 1747. He emigrated to America soon after, and
in 1754 became Provost of the University of Pennsylvania. His Works were printed in 2
vols., 8vo, in 1803, with a preface by Bishop White. They consisted chieﬂy of Addresses,
Orations, Sermons, and Letters.

Jonathan . Mayhew.

REV. JONATHAN MAYHEW, 1720-1766, was one of those clergymen
whose stirring eloquence helped to quicken the pulse of patriotic feeling.

Mayhew was a native of Martha’s Vineyard, and a graduate of Harvard, of the class of
1744. He was pastor of the West Church, Boston, from 1747 to his death in 1766. He
preached, as early as 1750, a sermon in reference to the execution of Charles 1., showing bold
and independent views in regard to the extent of allegiance. He took an active part in the
discussion upon the conduct of The Society for the Propagation of Christianity in Foreign
Parts, on account of its alleged attempts to introduce Episcopacy into New England. The
most striking and vigorous of his published discourses was A Sermon on the Repeal of the
Stamp Act, in 1766.

ON THE REPEAL OF THE STAMP ACT.

“We have never known so quick and general a transition from the depth of sorrow to the
height of joy, as on this occasion ; nor, indeed, so great and universal a ﬂow of either, on
any other occasion whatever. It is very true, we have heretofore seen times of great adver-
sity. We have known seasons of drought, dearth, and spreading mortal diseases; the pesti-
lence walking in darkness, and the destruction wasting at noonday. We have seen wide
devastations made by ﬁre; and amazing tempests, the heavens on ﬂame, the winds and
waves roaring. VVe have known repeated earthquakes, threatening us with speedy destruc-
tion. We have been under great apprehensions by reason of formidable ﬂeets of an enemy
on our coasts, menacing ﬁre andsword to all maritime towns. We have known times when
the French and Savage armiesmade terrible havock on our frontiers, carrying all before
them for a while ; when we were not without fear that some capital towns in the colonies
would fall into their merciless hands. Such times as these we have known: at some of
which almost every ‘face gathered paleness,’ and the knees of all but the good and brave
Waxed feeble. But never have we known a season of such universal consternation and amt»

iety among the people of all ranks and ages, in these colonies, as was occasioned by that
parliamentary procedure, which threatened us and our posterity with perpetual bondage
and slavery. For they, as we generally suppose, are really slaves to all intents and pur-
poses, who are obliged to labor and toil only for the beneﬁt of others; or, which comes to
the same thing, the fruit of whose labor and industry may be lawfully taken from them
without their consent, and they justly punished if they refuse to surrender it on demand, or
apply it to other purposes than those which their masters, of their mere grace and pleasure,
see ﬁt to allow. Nor are there many American un dersta.ndings acute enough to distinguish
any material difference between this being done by a single person, under the title of an
absolute monarch, and done by a far-distant legislature consisting of mcmy persons, in which
they are not represented; and the members whereof, instead of feeling and sharing equally
with them in the burden thus imposed, are eased by their own in proportion to the great-
ness and weight of it. It may be questioned, whether the ancient Greeks or Romans, or any
other nation in which slavery was allowed, ca.rried their idea of it much farther than this.
So that our late apprehensions, and universal consternation, on account of ourselves and
posterity, were far, very far indeed, from being groundless. For what is there in this world
more wretched than for those who were born free, and have a right to continue so, to be
made slaves themselves, and to think of leaving a race of slaves behind them; even though
it be to masters confessedly the most humane and generous in the world! Or what wonder
is it, if after groaning with a low voice for a while to no purpose, we at length groaned so
loudly as to be heard more than three thousand miles ; and to be pitied throughout Europe,
wherever it is not hazardous to mention even the name of liberty, unless it be to reproach
it, as only another name for sedition, faction, or rebellion? ” ‘

JEREMIAH LEAMING, D. D., 1719-1804, was a native of Middletown, Connecticut, and a grad-
uate of Yale. He was a clergyman of the Episcopal Church, and was held in high estima-
tion. He wrote A Defence of the Episcopal Government of the Church; Evidences of the
Truth of Christianity, etc. A

NATHAN Srnoive, D. D., 1748-1816, was born at Coventry, Connecticut, and graduated at
Yale, in the class of 1769. He was pastor of the First Church, in Hartford. Publications:
The Doctrine of Eternal Misery Consistent with the Inﬁnite Benevolence of God; two vol-
umes of Sermons; a large number of single Discourses. Dr. Strong contributed to the
Hartford Collection of Hymns, and originated and edited The Connecticut Evangelical
Magazine.

Samuel Hopkins.

SAMUEL HOPKINS, D. D., 1721-1803, is celebrated in theological annals
as the founder of the Hopkinsian scheme of divinity. '

Hopkins was a native of Waterbury, Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale. , He studied the-
ology under Jonathan Edwards, and preached at Great Barrington, Mass., at Newport, It. I.,
and other places. He published various works, but his chief performance was The System
of Doctrines contained in Divine Revelation. “ Hopkins sought to add to the ﬁve points of
Calvinism the rather heterogeneous ingredient that holiness consists in pure, disinterested
benevolence, and that all regard for self is necessarily sinful.” —Hz'ldrez§h.

JONATHAN EDWARDS, J R., D. D.,1745—-1801, a son of the ﬁrst President Edwards, was a grad-
uate and a tutor of the College of New Jersey, and President of Union College, Schenectady.
He published a number of Sermons and theological Essays, and was a contributor to the
New York Theological Magazine.

THE REVOLUTIONARY PERIOD. 91

REV. JEREMY BELKNAP, 1744—1798, a native of Boston, and a graduate of Harvard. Chieﬂy

known by his History of New Hampshire, 4 vols., and by his American Biography, 3 vols.

He also wrote Foresters, a work descriptive of American manners, and marked by wit and
humor. The strictl y historical part of his work on New Hampshire is more valuable than
that relating to its natural history, his attainments in such subjects being limited even for
those times.

REV. ISAAC BACKUS, 1724-1806, a native of Connecticut, was a distinguished Baptist minis-
ter. He Wrote A History of New England with Particular Reference to the Baptists.

ELHANAN WINCHESTER, 1751-1797, one of the earliest Universalist preachers of the United
States, was bor11 at Brookline, Massachusetts. He was at ﬁrst a Baptist, preaching at New-
ton, Massachusetts, and on the Pedee River, South Carolina, but in 1781 became a preacher
of universal restoration, and labored in Philadelphia and in England. He published The
Universal Restoration; Course of Lectures on the Prophecies; The Three War Trumpets;
Progress of the Empire of Christ; Poems and Hymns.

REV. J OHN HECKWELDER, 1743-1810, a native of Bedford, England, labored for many years
as a Moravian missionary among the Delawarelndiaiis, and published a series of papers
containing the results of his observations upon their language, habits, and character. The
views adopted by Heckwelder have been warmly attacked by General Cass and as warmly
defended by Nathan Hale. Upon the whole, we may say that Cass’s judgment of Heck-
welder, as a man utterly Wanting in accuracy of observation and in scientiﬁc spirit, has
gained the day, although it is generally admitted that the Delawares Whom he extols are
the best and most docile of all the Indian tribes.

Phillis Wheatley.

PHILLIS WHEATLEY, 1754-1784, was the negro phenomenon of the last
century.

Phillis was a native of Senegal, Africa, brought in a slave-ship to Boston when a child,
and bought in the slave-market of that city by Mrs. Wheatley, the wife of a Boston mer-
chant. Mrs. VVheatley, wanting a maid to attend upon her person, and being pleased with
the appearance of this child, gave her opportunities for mental culture. Phillis learned
rapidly, studying 11ot only the ordinary English branches, but Latin also. Her parts and at-
tainments attracting attention, she was much noticed, and had the advantage of conversation
and of social intercourse with the most educated and refined people in Boston. In 1772, she

was taken to England, on account of her health, and while there a volume of her Poems was

published under the patronage of the Countess of Huntingdon. She returned to Boston in
17 78. Her master and mistress both dying soon after, and their son settling in England,
Phillis, left without a protector, married a “Doctor” Peters, a man of her own race. The
marriage was an unhappy one, and Phillis died in poverty and neglect.

Mas. ELIZABETH (GRAEME) FERGUSON, 1739-1801, was a native of Philadelphia, and a
daughter of Dr. Thomas Graeme. She was married to Hugh H. Ferguson, a Scotchman,
from whom she separated on the outbreak of the Revolution, because he adhered to the
British Government. She was a Woman of ﬁne literary culture, and published numerous
minor'Poems and Letters. She translated also Fenelon’s Telemachus into English heroic
verse.

92 AMERICAN‘ LITERATURE.

Susanna Rovvson.

SUSANNA ROWSON, 1761-1824, was famous in her day as the author of
Charlotte Temple. 1

Mrs. Rowson was the daughter of Lieutenant William Haswell, of the British navy. At
the age of seven she came with her father to New England. While s_till a child, she, by her
precocious talents, wo11 applause from James Otis and others in the highest circles in Bos-
ton. In 1784 she went to London, and in 1786 she‘ was married there to William Rowson.
About the same time she began authorship, and published in rapid succession several novels,
—-Victoria, Mary or The Test of Honor, The Fille de Chambre, The Inquisitor, and Charlotte
Temple. The last-named work had a great success, 25,000 copies being sold, and is the only
work by which she is now known. She wrote also A Trip to Parnassus, and A Critique of
Authors and Performers.

In 1793, Mrs. Rowson returned to the United States, and was engaged as an actress for the 1

next three years in Philadelphia and Boston. In 1796, she retired from the stage, and open-
ing a school for young ladies, was very successful, having pupils from the West Indies,
from the British provinces, and from all parts of the Union.

Both during her dramatic career and her career as a teacher, Mrs. Rowson kept her pen
busy. Among the books which she wrote after her return to America, may be named two
novels, The Trials of the Heart, and Reuben and Rachel; Slaves in Algiers, an Opera; The
French Patriot, a Comedy; The Volunteers, a Farce founded on the Pennsylvania Whiskey
Insurrection; besides several school-books, poetical addresses, and songs. The song, Amer-
ica, Commerce, and Freedom, was very popular.

MRS. MERCY WARREN, 1728-1814, the wife of Mr. James Warren, and a sister of James
Otis, was born at Barnstable, Mass. Like the rest of her family, she was a zealous patriot,
and exercised her talents in satirizing the royalists. She wrote The Adulator, as now acted
in Upper Servia; and The Group, a satirical tragedy of similar character; Poems, Dramatic
and Miscellaneous; History of the Rise, Progress, and Termination of the American Revo-
lution, 3 vols., 8vo.

ST. GEORGE TUCKER, 1752-1827, was born in Bermuda, West Indies, but was educated in
VVilliam and Mary College, Virginia, and in 1778 was married to Mrs. Randolph, the mother
of John Randolph of Roanoke. Judge Tucker gained distinction as a jurist, and published
several essays on professional topics. He is known in general literature by the following
short poem only:

STANZAS.

Days of my youth, ye have glided away;

Hairs of my youth, ye are frosted and gray;

Eyes of my youth, your keen sight is no more;
Cheeks of my youth, ye are furrowed all o’er;
Strength of my youth, all your vigor is gone;
Thoughts of my youth, your gay visions are ﬂown.

Days of my youth, I wish not your recall;

Hairs of myyouth, I’m content ye should fall;
Eyes of my youth, you much evil have seen;

Cheeks of my youth, bathed in tears have you been;
Thoughts of my youth, ye have led me astray;
Strength of my youth, why lament your decay?

Days of my age, ye will shortly be past;

Pains of my age, yet awhile ye can last;

Joys of my age, in true wisdom delight;

Eyes of my age, be religion your light;
Thoughts of my age, dread ye not the cold sod;
Hopes of my age, be ye ﬁxed on your God.

JAMES MCOLURG, M. D., 1747-1825, was a native of Hampton, Virginia, and a fellow-st11-
dent with Jefferson at W'illiam and Mary. McClurg studied medicine in Edinburgh and
Paris. Dr. McClurg attained great eminence in his profession. In addition to his scientiﬁc
attainments, he was well versed in literature, and occasionally used his pen for the amuse-
ment of the public. One of these productions, The Belles of Williamsburg, the joint pro-
duction of Dr. McClurg and his friend Judge Tucker, had considerable notoriety. A few
stanzas are quoted: O

THE BELLES OF WILLIAMSBURG.

Myrtilla’s beauties who can paint?

The well-turned form, the glowing teint,
May deck a common creature;

But who can make th’ expressive soul

VVith lively senseinform the whole,
And light up every feature.

At church Myrtilla lowly kneels,
No passion but devotion feels,

No smiles her looks environ;
But let her thoughts to pleasure ﬂy,
The basilisk is in her eye,

And on her tongue the Syren.

~More vivid beauty—fresher bloom,

With teints from nature’s richest loom
In Sylvia’s features glow;

Would she Myrtilla’s arts apply,

And catch the magic of her eye,
They ’d rule the world below.

See Laura, sprightly nymph, advance,

Through all the mazes of the dance,
With light fantastic toe;

See laughter sparkle in her eyes—

At her approach new joys arise,
New ﬁres within us glow.

Such sweetness in her looks is seen,

Such brilliant elegance of mien,
S0 jauntie and so airy;

I-Ier image in our fancy reigns,

All night she gallops through our veins,
Like little Mab the fairy.

Aspasia next, with kindred soul,
Disdains the passions that control

And graceful form attract our praise,

JONATHAN MITCHEL SEWALL, 1748-1809, was born at Salem, Massachusetts, and educated at
Harvard. He published a volume of Poems, of considerable merit, but is chieﬂy known by
his patriotic song, entitled War and Washington. It was written at the beginning’ of the
war, and was sung by the army all over the country with great enthusiasm. He Was the
author of the couplet so much quoted,

No pent-up Utica contracts your powers,
But the whole boundless continent is yours.

ELIJAH FITCH, 1745-1788, a graduate of Yale, of the class of 1765, and minister of the

church in Hopkinton, Mass., published a long poem in ﬁve books, on The Beauties of K6,‘-'
ligion, addressed to youth; and another poem of less extent, but like character, called The
Choice. A

REV. NATHANIEL EVANS, 1742-1767, was born in Philadelphia, and educated in the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania. He we11t to England in 1765 for ordination, and returned  a mis-
sionary of the Society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign Parts. He was stationed in
Gloucester County, New Jersey, and remained there until his death, in 1767. He published a
volume entitled Poems on Several Occasions. The poems show ﬁne literary taste.

BENJAMIN CHURCH, M. D., 1734-17 76, was a native of Newport, Rhode Island, and a gradu-
ate of Harvard,in the class of 17.34:. He studied medicine in England, and was married
there. On returning to America, he established himself in his profession in Boston. Church
had considerable poetical abilities. His ﬁrst poem was written while a student at college,
and was called The Choice. It was in smooth. inoffeiisive heroic couplets, written profess-
edly in imitation of Pomfret’s poem of the same name. In 1765, after the passage of the
stamp act, he published a satire, called The Times; in 1766, an elegy on Dr. Mayhew; in
1769, An Address to a Provincial Bashaw, by a Son of Liberty; in 1770, An Elegy on the
Death of Rev. George Whiteﬁeld. In these more mature productions of his muse, Church
displayed much poetical ability. His political satires, particularly, were vigorous and keen,
and were on the side of liberty. But he was extravagant and irregular in his life, and being
led by his necessities into treasonable practices, he was obliged in 1776 to leave for England.
The vessel in which he sailed was never heard from.

J OHN BARTRAM, 1701-1777, was the father of American botany. He was born at Marple,
Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Having a taste for botany, he established a botanical gar-
den, the ﬁrst ever attempted in America, and devoted himself to his favorite pursuit with
a degree of sagacity and a singleness of purpose that made his name famous in both conti-
nents. He made no pretensions to literary skill, but his published observations show great

ishrewdness.

VYILLL\M BARTRA.‘M,1739—1823,SOn of John B., inherited the tastes of his father, and de-
voted himself through life to his favorite pursuit. “ Bartram’s Garden,” begun by the father
and continued by the son, became famous. It was on the west bank of the Schuylkill, a
little below Philadelphia, near where the Gray’s Ferry bridge now stands. Bartram never
married. He spent ﬁve years in traversing the South Atlantic States, studying the natural
history of the region, and in 1791 published his observations in an Svo volume, with a map
and plates. The title of hiswork is Travels through North and South Carolina, Georgia,
East and West Florida, the Cherokee Country, etc., containing an Account of the Soil ELHC
Natural Productions of those Regions, together with Observations on the Manners of the
Indians. “It is a delightful specimen of the enthusiasm with which the lover of nature,
and particularly the botanist, surveys the beautiful and wonderful productions which are

scattered over the face of the earth.” Bartram made some other contributions to scientiﬁc
and to popular literature, but the work just named was his chief production. After return-
ing from his Southern expedition, he lived in quiet seclusion at the old homestead, where
he was often visited by scientiﬁc travellers. l unlap, the painter and historian, gives the
following sketch of Bartram’s appearance, on the occasion of a visit of this kind, in 1797 :

“ Arrived at the botanist’s garden, we approached an old man, who, with a rake in his
hand, was breaking the clods of earth on a tulip bed. His hat was old, and ﬂapped over
his face; his coarse shirt was seen near his neck, as he _wore no cra.vat or kerchief; his
waistcoat and breeches were both of leather, and his slices were tied with leather strings.
We approached and accosted him. He ceased his work, and entered into conversation with
the ease and politeness of nature’s nobleman. His countenance was expressive of benignity
and happiness. This was the botanist, traveller, and philosopher we had come to see. He
pointed out many curious plants.”

ELIAS BOUDINOT, 1740-1821, a native of Philadelphia, but resident for the most part in New
Jersey, espoused actively the cause of the Revolution. He was at one time President of the
Congress, and was for ten years Director of the Mint. He was the ﬁrst President of the
American Bible Society, and a liberal benefactor of benevolent and literary institutions. lle
wrote some works which attracted very general attention. The Second Advent of the
Messiah; The Age of Revelation, a reply to Paine: The Star in the West, a work intended
to prove that the American Indians are the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.

REV. WILLIAM LINN, 17524808, was a native of Pennsylvania, and a graduate of Princeton,
of the class of 1772. He was_a Presbyterian minister, and served as chaplain in the Ameri-
can army. Ile enjoyed a high reputation as a pulpit orator. Besides numerous Sermons on
special occasions, he published in l70l a volume of Discourses on the Leading Personages of
Scripture History, and in 1704 another, entitled The Signs of the Times. Of his special ser-
mons, the one published in 1800, 011 the Death of Washington, is the most noted. An
extract is given :

WASHINGTON.

“ There was in him thatlassemblage of qualities which constitutes real greatness ; and these
qualities were remarkably adapted to the conspicuous part which he was called to perform.
He was not tinsel, but gold; not a pebble, but a diamond ; not a meteor, but a sun. Were
he compared with the sages and the heroes of antiquity, he would gain by the comparison,
or rather, he would be found to be free from the blemishes, and to unite the excellencies of
them all. Like Fabius, he was prudent; like Hannibal, he was unappalled by diﬂiculties;
like Cyrus, he conciliated affection; like Cimon, he was frugal; like Philopemon, he was
humble; and like Pompey, he was successful. If we compare him with characters in the
Sacred Records, he combined the exploits of Moses and of Joshua, not only by conducting us
safely across the Red Sea, and through the wilderness, but by bringing us into the promised
land; like David, he conquered an insulting Goliath, and rose to the highest honors from an
humble station; like Hezekiah, he ruled; and like Josiah, at his death there is a mourning
‘ as the mourning of Hadadrimmon, in the valley of Megiddon.’ ”

GEORGE R. MINoT,1758—180:2, was a native of Boston, and a graduate of Harvard, of the
class of 1778. He studied law in the same office with Fisher Ames, and became a Judge.
He wrote two historical works which are held in high repute, A History of the Province of
Massachusetts Bay, from 174.8 to 1765, and The Rebellion in Massachusetts in 1786.

JOSEPH BELLAMY, D.D., 1719-1790, a learned and able theologian of the Edwards school,

CHAPTER III.
FROM 1800 TO 1880.

THE famous taunt of the Edinburgh Review, “ Who reads an
American book?” had its sting in the fact that in those days
there was a real dearth of authorship in the United States.

The earlier colonial literatureiwas already among the things of the past.
The literary activity of the Revolutionary period had subsided with the
subsidence of the political ferment in Which that special activity originated.
After the achievement of Independence and the establishment of a national
Government, the American people were too busy in the Work of material
progress to give much attention to literature and science. There were, in-
deed, some honorable exceptions to this remark. But on the whole, the
growth of the nation in this direction was by no means equal to its progress
in other respects.

The time since the year 1800 may be conveniently divided, so far as liter-
ature is concerned, into three periods, the ﬁrst ending in 1830, the second
in 1850, and the last coming down to the present time. These periods con-
stitute, accordingly, our Third, Fourth, and Fifth Chapters.

Chapter Third, 1800-1830, represents the national literature in its incip-
ient, formative condition, under the new order of things, and is compara-
tively weak and meagre.

Chapter Fourth, 1830-1850, is much more abundant in materials and
strength.

Chapter Fifth, 1850-] 87 3, far exceeds all the preceding in the abundance
and quality of its materials, and shows the nation to be, at length, in its in-
tellectual activity, thoroughly self-reliant, and nearly, if not quite, -abreast
of its older transatlantic neighbors.

The period constituting Chapter Third, though confessedly weak, would

' 96

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 97

appear stronger than it now does, were it not that many Writers who ac-
quired celebrity in that period continued their literary activity far on towards
the middle of the century, and that some, Who, like the veteran Bryant,
were famous as far back as 1825, still live to add yearly to their laurels.

Among the Writers who gave, lustre to the period now under considera-g
tion, but who, happily for us, were spared to swell the treasures of a later

day, may be named Bryant, Halleck, Paulding, Verplanck, Irving, Cooper,
Kennedy, Percival, Pierpont, John Howard Payne, Miss Leslie, Miss Sedg-
wick, Mrs. Sigourney, Mrs. Hale, Mrs. Willard, Mrs. .Phelps, the veteran
magazinist John Neal, and the eminent theologians, Dr. Samuel Miller and

Dr. Archibald Alexander, all of whom had become writers of note before,

the year 1830.

In some instances it has been diﬂicult to determine to which of these periods a particular
writer should be assigned. The rule which it has been intended to observe has been to con-
sider a man as belonging to that period in which his literary productiveness has been great-
est, and in which he may fairly be said to have culminated.

The writers included in Chapter III. are divided into seven
sections: 1. The Poets, beginning with Robert Treat Paine;

2. Miscellaneous Prose Writers, beginning *with Charles Brock- ’

den Brown; 3. Scientiﬁc Writers, beginning with Wilson the
Ornithologist; 4. Writers on Political Economy, beginning with
Matthew Carey; 5. Legal and Political Writers, beginning with
Chancellor Kent; 6. Writers of Biography and History, begin-
ning with Chief—Justice Marshall ; 7. Theological Writers, begin-
ning with Samuel Stanhope Smith.

I. THE POETS.

Robert Treat Paine, Jr.

ROBERT TREAT. PAINE, .13., 1773-1811, was the author of several
poems which had a temporary notoriety, but he is now almost exclusively
known, so far as he is known at all, by a patriotic song, called Adams and
Liberty.

Mr. Paine was a son of the Signer of the Declaration of Independence, Robert Treat Paine,
and was named originally Thomas Paine. But on his own application, his name was changed
by the Legislature to that of his father.

Paine was born at Taunton, Massachusetts, and was graduated at Harvard, in the class of
1792. He began writing poetry early in life, and nearly all his college exercises were in
verse. About the time of his graduation, the players made their ﬁrst appearance in Boston.
Theatrical life and people suited Paine’s tastes, and most of his brief career after this was
connected with the dramatic profession. He became fascinated with one of the actresses,
and married her. He wrote theatrical criticisms and prologues, and engaged in various

9 G

other literary projects, but became dissipated, and died prematurely, with a reputation for
shining abilities, but without having achieved any permanent success.

His two chief poems, after the patriotic song already named, were The Invention of Let-
ters, and’ The Ruling Passion.

After his death, Mr. Paine’s poetry gradually declined in popular estimation. It was pro.-
nounced tawdry, stilted, and conventional, the poetry of books and not of the heart. There
has been, however, some reaction from this sweeping condemnation, and he is now generally‘
allowed, by those familiar with the subject, to have possessed talents of a very high order.

ADAMS AND LIBERTY.

Ye ‘sons of Columbia, who bravely have fought
For those rights, which unstained from your sires had descended,
May you long taste the blessings your valour has bought, A
And your sons reap the soil which your fathers defended;
’Mid the reign of mild peace,
May your nation increase,
With the glory of Rome and the wisdom of Greece;
And ne’er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves,
While the earth bears a plant, or the sea rolls its waves.

In a clime whose rich vales feed the marts of the world,
Whose shores are unshaken by Europe’s commotion,
The trident of commerce should never be hurl’d,
To increase the legitimate powers of the ocean,
But should pirates invade, A
Though in thunder array’d,
Let your cannon declare the free charter of trade.

While France her huge limbs bathes recumbent in blood,
And society’s base threats with wide dissolution;
May peace, like the dove who return’d from the ﬂood,
Find an ark of abode in our mild constitution.
' But though peace is our aim,
Yet the boon we disclaim,
If bought by our sovereignty, justice, or fame.

’Tis the ﬁre of the ﬂint each American warms:
Let Rome’s haughty victors beware of collision;
Let them bring all the vassals of Europe in arms,
We’re a world by ourselves, and disdain a provision.
While, with patriot pride,
To our laws We’re allied,
No foe can subdue us, no faction divide.

Our mountains are crowned with imperial oak,
Whose roots, like our liberties, ages have nourished,
But long ere our nation submits to the yoke,
Not a tree shall be left on the ﬁeld where it ﬂourish’d.
Should invasion impend,
Every grove would descend
From the hill-tops they shaded, our shores to defend.

Should the tempest of War overshadow our land,
Its bolts could ne’er rend Freedom’s temple asunder;

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 99

For, unmov’d, at its portal would Washington stand,
And repulse, with his breast, the assaults of the thunder!
His sword from the sleep
01' its Scabbard ~would leap,
And conduct, with its point,‘ every ﬂash to the deep.

Let fame to the world sound America’s voice;
No intrigues can her sons from their government sever;
Her pride are her statesmen—~their laws are her choice;
And shall ﬂourish till Liberty slumbers forever.
Then unite heart and hand,
Like Leonidas’ band,
That ne’er shall the sons of Columbia be slaves,
While the earth bears a plant, or the sea rolls its waves.

Fessenclen.

THOMAS GREEN FESSENDEN, 1771-1837, gained much notoriety as a
humorous and satirical writer, under the name of Christopher Caustic.
His two chief poems were Terrible Tra.ctoration, and The Country Lovers.

Fessenden was a native of VVal pole, New Hampshire, and a graduate of Dartmouth, of the
class of 1796. He went to England in 1501, to introduce some mechanical invention. The
machine failed, and its inventor fell into want. To relieve himself from his pecuniary
troubles, he made a literary venture which was as successful as his mechanical ones had
been disastrous. A man by the name of Perkins was at that time making a great noise by
employing galvanism in the cure of disease. He used for this purpose what he called
“metallic tractors.” Fessenden seized the occasion to write his best known poem. Its full

title is: “Terrible Tractoration, a Poetical Petition against Galvanizing Trumpery and the ,

Perkinistic Institution, in four Cantos, most respectfully addressed to the Royal College of
Physicians, by Christopher Caustic, M. D., LL. D., A. S. S., Fellow of the Royal College of
Pliysicians, Aberdeen, and Member of no less than nineteen very learned Societies.” ‘The
poem is written professedly in the interest of the faculty and against Perkins, but is in fact
a satire upon the medical profession.‘ The poem made a decided hit, and gained the author
both money and fame.

On returning to America, Fessenden engaged in several literary and political enterprises,
with varying success,’ and ﬁnally settled down as a writer on agricultural subjects. He
ed.ted for some years the New England Farmer, the Horticultural Register, and the Silk
Manual. Hawthorne gives the following picture of Fessenden near the close of his career:

“ In January, 1836, I became, and continued for a few months, an inmate of Mr. Fessen-
de.n’s family. It was my ﬁrst acquaintance with him. His image is before my mind’s eye
at this moment; slowly approaching me with a lamp in his hand, his hair gray, his face
solemn and pale, his tall and portly ﬁgure bent with heavier inﬁrmity than beﬁtted his
years. His dress—though he had improved in this particular since middle life—was
marked by a truly scholastic negligence. He greeted me kindly, and with plain, old-fash~
ioned courtesy; though I fancied that he somewhat regretted the interruption of his even--
ing studies. After a few moments’ talk, he invited me to accompany him to his study, and
give my opinion on some passages of satirical verse, which were to be inserted in a new
edition of ‘Terrible Tractoration.’ Years before I had lighted on an illustrated copy of
this poem, bestrewn with venerable dust, in a corner of a college library; and it seemed
strange and whimsical that I should ﬁnd it still in progress of composition, and be consulted
about it by Doctor Caustic himself. While Mr. Fessenden read, I had leisure to glance

around at his study, which was very characteristic of the man and his occupations. The

table, and great part of the ﬂoor, was. covered with books and pamphlets on agricultural
subjects, newspapers from all quarters, manuscript articles for the New England Farmer,
and manuscript stanzas for ‘Terrible Tractoration.’ There was such a litter as always
gathers around a literary man. It bespoke, at once, Mr. Fessenden’s amiable temper and
abstracted habits, that several members of the ‘family, old and young, were sitting in the
room, and engaged in conversation, apparently without giving him the least disturbance.
A specimen of Doctor Caustic’s inventive genius was seen in the ‘Patent Steam and Hot-
water Stove ’ which heated the apartment, and kept up a pleasant singing sound, like that
of a tea-kettle,——thereby making the ﬁreside more cheerful. It appears to me, that, having
no children of ﬂesh and blood, Mr. Fessenden had contracted a fatherly fondness for this
stove, as being his mental progeny; and it must be owned that the stove well deserved his
affection, and repaid it with much warmth.”

Joseph Hopkinson.

J OSEPI-I HOPKINSON, LL.D., 17 7 0-1 842, is known in literature by a
single brief production only, the patriotic song of Hail Columbia.

Hopkinson was a Philadelphian, was _ educated at the University of Pennsylvania, was a
member of Congress, and, in 1828, was appointed United States District Judge. lle deliv-
ered and published several addresses before literary societies, but is now known almost
exclusively by the popular song already named. Ile was a son of the Francis Hopkinson,
of Revolutionary memory, who is described in the preceding chapter.

JOHN BLAIR LINN, 1777—1804, a native of Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, and an assistant
minister to Dr. Ewing, in the First Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, was the author of
The Gallic Orphan, a drama, acted in New York; The Power of Genius, a Poem; Valerian,
a Poem in blank verse ; and 2 volumes of Miscellania, prose and verse.

CHARLES PINCKNEY SUMNER, 1766-1839, the father of Charles Sumner, was born at Milton,
Massachusetts, and graduated at Harvard, in the class of 1793. He studied law under Josiah
Quincy, was appointed High-Sheriﬁ‘ of the County of Suffolk in 1825, and retained the office
until 1839. He published The Compass, a poetical performance; Eulogy on Washington;
Letters on Speculative Masonry,_etc.

Frarfcis S. Key.

FRANCIS SCOTT KEY, 1779-1843, is, like Hopkinson, indebted for literary
celebrity to the composition of a single patriotic song, The Star-Spangled
Banner. '

Mr. Key was born in Frederick County, Maryland, and educated at St. John’s College,
Annapolis. He practised law first in Fredericktown, and afterwards in Washington, where
he became District Attorney. After his death, his poems were collected by H. V. D. Johns
and published in Baltimore. The only one of any celebrity is The Star-Spangled Banner,
already named. It was composed in 1814, on the occasion of the bombardment of Fort
McHenry, when the author was a prisoner in the hands of the attacking British.

VVILLIAM MUNFORD, 1775-1825, was a native of Mecklenburg County, Virginia, and a grad-
uate of VVilliam and Mary College. He studied law; was a member of the House of Dele-
gates, 1797-1801; Senator, 1801-1805; Member of the Privy Council, 805-1811; and Clerk
of the House of Delegates, 1811-1825. Besides several volumes of Law Reports, he published

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 101

a volume of Poems and Prose_ articles, containing versiﬁcations of Ossian, Homer, etc. His
chief literary performance was a translation of the Iliad into blank verse. This work was
reviewed at length by Felton in the North American Review, by C. A. Bristed in the Ameri-
can Whig Review, and by Frothingham in the Christian Examiner. It is by general con-
sent an accurate and scholarly version, and is entitled to an honorable place in the long line
of illustrious attempts to give to the world an English Homer.

Washington Allston.

WASHINGTON ALLSTON, 1779~1813, a native of South Carolina, is known chieﬂy as a painter.
He wrote, however, with great ‘ease and no little ability, both in prose and‘ verse. His prin-
cipal publications are The Sylphs of the Seasons and Other Poems, The Romance of Monaldi,
and Lectures on Art. Mr. Allston was greatly distinguished also for his conversational
powers. “His tongue wrought on his associates and acquaintances like an enchanter’s
spell, preventing them taking any note of time; and the small hours would be close upon
them before they had thought of retiring.” A short passage is quoted from the romance
of Monaldi. The scene is one in which Landi, the father, is trying to persuade his daughter
to marry a man whom she does not love:

LOVE MATCHES.

“ My dear father,” said Rosalie, “I would that I could reason on this subject, but —indeed
I cannot.”

“Strange! You hint not even an objection, and yet-—— Do you think I overrate him? ”

“ No; he deserves all you say of him; but yet —”

“You would still reject him? ”

Rosalie was silent.

“ If you esteem, you may certainly love ; nay,  will fellow of course.”

“Did you always think so, sir? ” ~ -

“ Perhaps not. When I was young, I was no doubt fanciful, like others.”

“ And yet you did not marry until past thirty.”

“Well, child? ”

“ My mother died when I was too young to know her; but I have heard her character so
often from yourself and others, that I have it now as fresh before me as if she had never
been taken from us. Was she not mild and gentle? ”

“As the dew of heaven.”

“And her mind? ”

“The seat of every grace and virtue.”

“And her person too was beautiful? ”

“Except yourself, I have not seen a creature so lovely.”

“And did she make you a good wife ? ”

Landi turned pale. “ Rosa1ie——my child —why remind me, by these cruel questions, of a
loss which the whole world cannot repair ? ” R

“ She was then all you wished; and yet I have heard that yours was a love match.”

“ N 0 more,” cried Landi,averting his face. “You have conquered.”

Clement C. Moore.

CLEMENT C. Moons, LL. D., 1779-1863, son of the late Bishop Moore, was a native of New
York city and a graduate of Columbia-College. He was for a long time Professor of Oriental
and Greek Literature in the Episcopal Theological Seminary, New York. He published a
Hebrew and Greek Lexicon, a volume of Poems, and some other works; but will long be
gratefully remembered as the author of those sprightly lines: ‘

AMERICAN LITERATURE.

A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS.

’Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house"

Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse:

The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that ST. NICHOLAS soon would be there;

The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads:
And mamma in her ’kerchief, and I in my cap,

Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap:
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.
Away to the window I ﬂew like a ﬂash,

Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.

The moon, on the breast of the new fallen snow,
Grave the lustre of mid—day to objects below,

When, what to my wandering eyes should appear,
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,

With a little old driver, so lively and quick,

I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
“Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prcmcer, and Vixen.’
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!

To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!”

As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane ﬂy,
When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky:
So up to the housetop the coursers they ﬂew,

With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof

The prancing and pawing of each little l1oof——

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,
Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound;
He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;
A bundle of toys he had ﬂung on his back,

And he looked like a pedlar just opening his pack.
His eyes—how they twinkled! his dimples how merryl
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!
His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,
And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow;
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, V
And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath;
He had a broad face and a little round belly,

That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful ofjelly.
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,
And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,

Soon gave me to know" I had nothing to dread;

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,
And ﬁlled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,

men 1800 TO 1830.   103

And laying his ﬁnger aside of his nose,

And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;

He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,
And away they all ﬂew like the down of a thistle.
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
“Happy (7h7'istmas to all, and to all a good-m'ght.”‘

RICHARD ALSOP, 1761-1815, was a native of Middletown, Connecticut. He studied for a
while at Yale, but did not graduate, preferring to devote himself to the study of languages.
He was familiar not only with the Latin and Greek, but also with the French, Spanish, and
Italian. In connection with Theodore Dwight, he published in Hartford, in 1791, a series
of humorous papers called The Echo. These were clever travesties and exaggerations of
current publications, —scientiﬁc twaddle, spread-eagle orations, pompous state-papers, -
whatever seemed to offer a target for the shafts of ridicule. Citizen Genet’s processions,
Governor Hancock’s messages, J efferson’s inaugurals are among the topics thus put into
polished pentameters. Among the other works of Alsop were A Poem to the Memory of
Washington, The Enchanted Lake of the Fairy Morgana, The Charms of Fancy.

Robert Dinsmoor.

ROBERT DINSMOAOR, 1757-1886, commonly known as the “Rustic Bard,”
published in 1828 a Volume called Incidental Poems.

Dinsmoor belonged to one of the old Scotch-Irish Presbyterian families who settled the.

town of Londonderry, New Hampshire. His education was ve,ry limited, and he continued
to the last a sturdy country farmer. But "he had drunk inspiration from Robert Burns, and
had much of the same doric humor. Whittier, in his charming book, Old Portraits and
Modern Sketches, has given a genial picture of Dinsmoor, in his old age.

“The last time I saw him he was chaifering in the market-place of my native village
(llaverhill), swapping potatoes, and onions, and pumpkins, for tea, coffee, molasses, and, if
the truth be told, New England rum. Threescore years and ten “hung o’er his back_,”
yet. he stood stoutly and sturdily in his thick shoes of cowhide, like one accustomed to tread
independently the soil of his own acres——his broad, honest face seamed by care and dark-
ened by exposure to ‘all the airts that blow,’ and his white hair ﬂowing in patriarchal
glory beneath his felt hat. A genial, jovial, large-hearted old man, simple as a child, and
betraying neither in look nor manner that he was accustomed to

‘Feed on thoughts which voluntarily make

Harmonious numbers.’ ”

Dinsmoor wrote sometimes in plain English, but more frequently in the Scottish dialect.
The followingis a favorable specimen of his style, and is remarkable as being Written at the
age of seventeen. The piece is called Skip’s Last Advice, and is in commemoration of a
favorite old dog “who had survived his ﬁfteenth year.”

‘SKIP’S LAST ADVICE.

Levi Frisbie.

LEVI FRISBIE, 1784-1822, was born at Ipswich, Massachusetts, and graduated at Harvard
in the class of 1802. He was Latin Tutor in the College, then Professor of Latin, and f i‘()l'l1
1817 to 1822 was Professor of Moral Philosophy. An octavo volume was published after his
death, containing some of his poems and of his philosophical lectures.

Samuel Woodworth.

SAMUEL VVOODWORTH, 17 85-1842, a poet of some note, is the author o_f
the familiar lyric, The Old Oaken Bucket.

V\'oodworth was born in Scituato, Massachusetts. He learned the trade of a printer, and
was engaged at different times in a large number of periodicals, of one kind or another. He

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 105

published, Beasts at Law, "or Zoological Jurisprudence; Quarter-Day, or the Horrors of the
First of May; and many short poems. One of his lyrics, already named, has been a general
favorite, and is likely to live. —

THE OLD OAKEN BUCKET.

How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood,
When fond recollection presents them to view;

The orchard, the meadow, the deep tangled wild wood,
And every loved spot which my infancy knew;

The wide spreading pond, and the mill which stood by it,
The bridge and the rock where the cataract fell;

The cot of my father, the dairy-aouse nigh it,
And e’en the rude bucket which hung in the well,

The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.

That moss-covered vessel I hail as a treasure;
For often, at noon, when returned from the ﬁeld,

I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure,
The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.

How ardent I seized it with hands that were glowing,
And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell;

Then soon, with the emblem of truth overﬂowing,
And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well;

The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.

How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it,
As, pois’d on the curb, it inclined to my lips!
Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it,
Though ﬁl1’d with the nectar that Jupiter sips.
And now, far removed from the loved situation,
The tears of regret will intrusively swell,
As fancy reverts to my father’s plantation,
And sighs for the bucket which hangs in the well;
The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,
The moss-covered bucket which hangs in his well.

ROBERTVVALN, JR., 1797-1824, was a native and resident of Philadelphia, and a member,
of one of the oldest and most honored families of that city. He received a liberal education,
but did not engage in professional life. He published, in 1819, The Hermit in Philadelphia,
describing the various scenes and incidents of city life. His other publications are Ameri-
can Bards, a satire; Touches at the Times; Life of Lafayette, etc.

I-Iillhouse.

JAMES A. HILLHOUSE, 17 89-1841, was a poet of national reputation, his

best work being the drama of Hadad, published in 1825.

Hillhouse was a native of New Haven, and a graduate of Yale, of the class of 1808. He
retired from commercial life in 1821, and passed the remainder of his life in elegant leisure
at Sachem’s Wood, near New Haven. He delivered several able orations, and published at

106 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

number of poems that have been warmly commended. _ These are: The Judgment, a Vision ‘,
Percy’s Masque, a drama; Hadad, a sacred drama, and one or two shorter pieces. The best
of his orations, perhaps, is the Phi Beta Kappa discourse in 1826, On Some of the Consider-
ations which should inﬂuence an Epic or a Tra.gic Writer in the Choice of an Era. Hill-
11ouse’s poetry, although at one time ranked very high by critics, is now but little read by
the public. A collected edition of his works, in 2 vols., 8vo, was published in 1839. .

RICHARD DABNEY, 1786-1825, a scholar and a poet of rare excellence, was a native and resi-
dent of Virginia, and belonging to an ancient family known in early times in England as
Daubeney, and in France as D’Aubigné. Mr. Dabney was one of those who escaped with his
life at the burninghof the theatre in Richmond, in 1811, though he suffered severely, and
died prematurely in consequence.‘ He was specially noted for his elegant scholarship in
Greek and Latin, also for his acquaintance with English and Italian literature. He pub-
lished a volume of Poems, chieﬂy translations from the Greek of Euripedes, Alcaeus, Tyr-
tarus, and Sappho, from the Latin of Seneca and Martial, and from the Italian of Petrarch

and others, which were marked. with ﬁne taste and accurate scholarship.

JOHN M. HARNEY, M. D., 1789-1825, was born in Sussex County, Delaware. In 1791, the
family removed to Tennessee, and afterwards to Louisiana. He studied medicine, and set-
tled at Bardstown, Kentucky. After practising for four years, he went abroad and travelled
in Great Britain, France, and Spain, and receiving a naval appointment, spent several years
in Buenos Ayres. On returning to the United States, he settled at Savannah, Georgia, but
losing his health returned to Bardstown, and died there. He published Crystalina, a Fairy
Tale, in six cantos, and left a number of poems in manuscript, some of which were published
afterwards in magazines.

Joseph Rodman Drake.

J OSEPH RODMAN DRAKE, 1795-1820, gave promise of the highest excel-
lence as a poet. His early death caused profound regret. He is chieﬂy
known as the author of The Culprit Fay, which is his largest poem, and
The American Flag, which is the most popular.

Drake was a native of New York. He was a poet almost from the cradle, and he began at
a very early age to contribute to the periodicals. He and Fitz Green Halleck, under the
name of Croaker & C0,, wrote a number of witty sallies, which had much temporary celeb-
rity. His poem, The, American Flag, appeared originally as one of the Croaker articles.
Drake’s poetical abilities were of a high order, and had he lived the ordinary term of life, he
would probably have produced some great Work of art. He died at the age of twenty-ﬁve.
Drake and Halleck were very intimate. “ The Culprit Fay arose out of a conversation in
the summer of 1819. in which Drake, De Kay, Cooper, and Halleck were speaking of‘ the
Scottish streams and their adaptation to the uses of poetry by their numerous romantic
associations. Cooper and Halleck maintained that our own rivers furnished no such capa-

bilities, while Drake, as usual, took the opposite side of the argument; and to make his A

position good, he produced in three days The Culprit Fay.”-—l)uyc7cz'nck. The scene of the
poem is laid in the Highlands of the Hudson, and all the myriad life of ﬁeld and ﬂood pecu-
liar to that region is transformed by the magic wand of the poet’s fancy into a sort of Mid-
summer Night’s Dream.

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 107

THE AMERICAN FLAG.

Only the first and last stanzas of this familiar piece are given. The last four lines
were written by Halleck.

When Freedom, from her mountain height,

Unfurled her standard to the air,
She tore the azure robe of night,

And set the stars of glory there!
She mingled with its gorgeous dyes
The milky baldric of the skies,

And striped its pure celestial white
With streakings of the morning light;
Then, from his mansion in the sun,
.She called her eagle bearer down,
And gave into his mighty hand

The symbol of her chosen land!

Flag of the free heart’s hope and home,

By angel hands to valour given;
Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,

And all thy hues were born in heaven!
Forever ﬂoat that standard sheet!

Where breathes the foe but falls before us-
With freedom’s soil beneath our feet,

And freedom’s banner streaming o’er us?

The friendship between Halleck and Drake was of the most beautiful and tender kind.
Hal1eck’s tribute to the memory of his friend has become classical.

ON THE DEATH OF JOSEPH RODMAN DRAKE.

Green be the turf above thee,
Friend of my better days!

None knew thee but to love thee,
Nor named thee but to praise.

Tears fell, when thou wert dying,
From eyes unused to weep,

And long where thou art lying,
Will tears the cold turf steep.

When hearts, whose truth was proven,
Like thine, are laid in earth,

There should a wreath be woven
To tell the world their worth.

And I, who woke each morrow
To clasp thy hand in mine,

Who shared thy joy and sorrow,
Whose weal and woe were mine—-

It should be mine to braid it
Around thy faded brow,
But I’ve in vain essayed it,

And feel I cannot now.

108 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

REV. CARLOS WILCOX, 1794-1827, was born at Newport, New Hampshire. He was grad-
uated at Middlebury College, and afterwards studied theology at Andover. He had several
pastoral charges in Connecticut, but had frequent interruptions in his ministry, as in his
studies, on account of ill health. He contemplated an extended Poem in ﬁve books, on The
Age of Benevolence. He published the First Book during his life. After his death, his
Remains were published, containing The Age of Benevolence (the First Book and portions
of the second, third, and fourth), and The Religion of Taste, also incomplete. “The poems
of Wilcox abound in passages of rural description of remarkable accuracy. The greater
portion is, however, occupied with reﬂections on the power and beneﬁcence of the Deity
in the constitution of the material universe and the human mind. His verse always
maintains correctness and dignity of expression, and often rises to passages of sublimity.”
—— Dzcyclci-izck.

JOHN G. C. BRAINARD, 1796—l828, was a poet of some note in the last generation. A
volume of his poems, with a biographical men1oir,'was edited in 1832 by his friend and
brother poet, John G. Whittier. Brainard was a native of Connecticut, a graduate of Yale,
and a lawyer by profession.

GRENVILLE MELLEN, LL.D., 1799-1841, was born at Biddeford, Maine. He was graduated
at Cambridge; studied law; practised in North Yarmouth from 1823 to 1828; after that
spent ﬁve years in Boston; then removed to New York, and resided there the rest of his
life. He was devoted to literary pursuits, wrote much for the periodicals, and was consid-
ered at the time a poet of high order. Time‘ has gradually reversed the verdict, and even
now, after the lapse of only thirty years, he is almost unknown. The following are the
titles of some of his works : Our Chronicle of Twenty-six, a satire; Glad Tales and Sad Tales,
a collection of prose pieces; The Martyr’s Triumplrand Other Poems ; The Rest 01 Empire,
etc. “ As a poet he enjoyed a higher reputation in his lifetime than his works will preserve.
They are without vigor of thought or language, and are often dreamy, mystic, and unintel-
ligible. In his writings there is no evidence of creative genius; no original, clear, manly
thought; no spirited and natural descriptions of life and nature; no humor, no pathos, no
passion; nothing that appeals to the common sympathies of mankind.” -4- Griswold.

Robert C. Sands.

ROBERT C. SANDS,‘ 1799-1882, was a writer of great promise, whose early
death was universally regretted. He wrote, conj ointly with his friend
Eastburn, a poem of some celebrity, called Yamoyden.

Sands was a native of the city of New York, and a graduate of Columbia College, of the
class of 1815. He was one of a literary coterie which ﬂourished in New York in the early
part of the century, and which included in its membership Bryant, Paulding, Verplanck,
Irving, Halleck, Eastburn, and others. Eastburn and Sands botl1 died early. They were
young men of great literary promise. They wrote conjointly a poem called Yamoyden,
which made some noise at the time. Sands was a lawyer by profession, and was gaining a

good degree of professional success; but his talents and taste were so decidedly literary that

he gradually abandoned the law and gave himself up entirely to literature. He wrote for,
or edited, several magazines, and for the last few years of his life was editor of The Com-
mereial Advertiser. He had a special fancy for literary copartnerships, and several of his
publications were made in this way. Sands, Verplanck, and Bryant wrote in. this way The
Talisman, a sort of illustrated annual, 3 vols. The same party, with the addition of Leggett
and Miss Sedgwick, wrote Tales of Glauber Spa, 2 vols. Sands wrote also A Life of John

Paul Jones. He died at the_age of thirty-three,just as he was rising from metropolitan
into national fame. From the versatility of his talents and l1is great mental activity, there

[is little doubt but that, had his life been spared, he would have ﬁlled a large space in Amer-

ican literature.

REV. JAMES WALLIS EASTBURN, 1797-1819, was a college friend and intimate literary asso-
ciate of Robert C. Sands, and the two poets were writing conjointly the poem of Yamoyden,
when an early death put an end to Mr. Eastburn’s part of the labor. He was a native of
New York.

MICALI P. FLINT, 1807-1830, son of Rev. Timothy Flint, was born in Lurcnberg, Massachu-
setts. The father going VVest as a missionary, the son received his education from his father
as tutor, wherever, from time to time, the latter was stationed, St. Louis, N ew*Orleans, New
Madrid, and Alexandria. He published in 1826 a volume, The Hunter and Other Poems,

_ and contributed a large amount of poetry to The VVestern Review, a monthly magazine

begun by his father at Cincinnati in 1827. The father, who was a man of superior abilities
and ﬁne tastes, entertained high hopes in regard to Micah, which however were cut off by
the early death of the latter. The following lines by the poet in regard to his youthful
verses are worthy of quotation, as showing an experience very common among authors in
regard to their ﬁrst ventures:

I was permitted, in my youthful folly,
To write, and send a book forth, once myself;
And now it makes me feel right melancholy,
VVhene’er "by chance I see it on a shelf:
Not that I think the book was common trash,
But that it cost some hundred dollars cash.

JOHN AUGUSTUS STONE, 1801-1834, was born at Concord, Massachusetts. He drowned
himself in a ﬁt of temporary insanity, in the Schuylkill River, at Philadelphia. He was a
dramatist of good promise. His chief play was Metamora, written for Edwin Forrest. He
wrote two other plays for Forrest, The Ancient Briton, and Fauntleroy. Forrest paid him
$500 for Metamora, and $1000 for The Ancient Briton. Stone wrote also La Rogue, the
Regicide ; The Demoniac; Tancred, and some other pieces.

JAMES GORDON BROOKS, 1801-1841, and MR3. MARY E. BROOKS, (originally Miss Aiken, and
married to 3/11‘. Brooks in 1828,) were both poets. He wrote under the name of Florio; she,
under that of Norna. They published, in 1829, a volume with the title, The Rivals of Este
and Other Poems, by ‘James G. and Mary E. Brooks. Mrs. Brooks’s contributions to ‘the
volume were considered the most valuable. “The poems of Hr. Brooks are spirited a11d
smoothly versiﬁed, but diffuse and carelessly written.‘ He was imaginative, and composed
with remarkable ease and rapidity ; but was too indifferent in regard to his reputation ever
to rewrite or revise his productions.” -— Griswold.

Mrs. Br°ooks—Ma1°ia del Occidente.

MRS. MARIA BROOKS, 1795-1845, surnamed by Southey Mctrid del Occi-
dente (Maria of the V/Vest), had a somewhat romantic history, and Was re-
garded for a time as a star of the ﬁrst magnitude in the poetic iﬁrmament.
Her chief work was an imaginative poem, founded on Oriental tradition,
and called Zophiel.

110 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Mrs. Brooks was originally a Miss Gowen, a lady of Welsh descent, born in Massachusetts.
On the bankruptcy and death of Miss Gowen’s father, her education was completed by Mr.
Brooks, a merchant of Boston, who afterwards married her. Ile too be coming embarrassed and
dying, she was again reduced from opulence to poverty, and her ﬁrst poems were written as a
solace to herself. A rich uncle in Cuba invited her to live with him, and on dying left her his
estate in that island. With ample means, she spent the remainder of her days in various places,
—- the United States, England, Europe, and Cuba. She died in Cuba. While in England, she
was the guest of Southey, who was a great admirer of her genius, and gave her the name of
Maria del Occidente, by which she is often known. 1-Ie.superintended an English edition
of her principal poem, Zophiel, and said, “America has never produced any poem to be
compared with it;” and in “The Doctor,” he calls her “ The most zmpctssioizecl and most
z'nzagincttz've of all poctesses.” The London Quarterly Review says, in regard to this eulogy:
“ Without taking into account quaedctm a7'clentz'07'a [certain rather over-warm passages] scat-
tered here and there throughout her singular poem, there is undoubtedly ground for the
ﬁrst clause, and, with the substitution of ‘ fanciful’ for ‘imaginative,’ for the whole of the
eulogy. It is altogether an extraordinary performance.” Charles Lamb, speaking of this

poem, writes»: “ He [Southey] says it is by some Yankee woman; as if there ever had been

a woman capable of anything so great!” Mr. Griswold also goes into a very elaborate
eulogy of Mrs. Brooks, putting her at the head of all those whose intellectual gifts have
thrown lustre upon her sex. A much more sober judgment is that given by Mrs. Hale, in
Woman’s Record: “Mrs. Brooks has displayed Inuch artistic skill,,as well as poetic talent,
cultivated taste, and literary research, in managing the materials of her poem. It has many
beautiful passages; the descriptions are gorgeous and glowing; there is thrilling incident
and burning passion; but it lacks nature, simplicity, and true feeling. It excites the fancy,
leaving the heart comparatively unmoved; therefore the poem is deﬁcient in that kind of
interest which insures popularity: though praised by critics, it will never be read by the
people.” i

The title of this, her chief poem, is Zophiel, the Bride of Seven ; the plot is taken from
the story of Tobit, in the Apocrypha, Where the heroine is married successively to seven
husbands, who all die on entering the bridal chamber, each being killed by Asmodeus, an
evil spirit. .Mrs. Brooks published also Judith, Esther, and Other Poems ; and Idomea, or
the Vale of Yumari, which was in effect an autobiography. C

Lucretia and Margaret’ Davidson.

LUCRETIA MARIA DAvIDsoN, 1808-1825, and MARGARET MILLER
DAVIDSON, 1823—_1838, sisters, are the Inost remarkable instances of preco-
cious intellectual development that American literature presents, and are
quite equal in that respect to Chatterton and Kirke Wliite.

Lucretia and Margaret Davidson were born at Plattsburg, New York, daughters of a phy-
sician of that place.

Lucretia, when only six years old, had composed a number of poetical pieces, which were
found secreted in a closet. The first of her poems that has been preserved was written at the
age of nine. Several are found in her published works written at eleven. Before the age of
twelve, she had read most of Shakespeare, Goldsmith, and other standard poets. At the age
of sixteen, through the kindness of a benevolent gentleman, she was placed in the Seminary
of Mrs. Willard, at Troy.

f‘ She at once surprised us by the brillianoy and pathos of her compositions; she evinced a
most exquisite sense of the beautiful in the productions of her pencil; always giving to what-
ever she attempted to copy certain peculiar and original touches which marked the liveliness
of her conceptions and the power of her genius to embody those conceptions. But from studies

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 111

which required calm and steady investigation, efforts. of memory, judgment, and consecutive
thinking, her mind seemed to shrink. She had no conﬁdence in herself, and appeared to
regard with dismay any requisitions of this nature.”—Mrs. Emma. Wz'llard.

Lucretia’s health soon failed, and she died not quite seventeen years old. Besides one
hundred and forty pieces which had been destroyed before her death, she left two hundred
and seventy—eight pieces, among them ﬁve poems of several cantos each, a number of ro-
mances, and a tragedy. A volume, entitled Amir Khan and Other Poems, being a collection
of her pieces, with a Memoir, was published in 1829, by Mr. S. F. B. Morse. It attracted

general attention, not only in this country, but in England, where it was reviewed with

high commendation by Southey in the London Quarterly.
Margaret, who was about two years old at the time of Lucretia’s death, not only had the
precocious imaginative character of the elder sister, but growing up in the atmosphere of

wondering admiration which surrounded the memory of Lucretia, seemed early to have im-_

bibed the idea that a like career awaited herself. “ When only three years old, she would
sit on a cushion at her mother’s feet, listening to anecdotes of her sister’s life, and details of
the events which preceded her death; and would often exclaim, while her face beamed with
mingled emotions, ‘ Oh, I will try to ﬁll her place —teach me to be like her.’ ” At the age
of six, she found delight in reading Milton, Cowper, Thomson, and Scott; “her language
assumed an elevated tone, and her mind seemed ﬁlled with poetic imagery, blended with
religious thought.” She died even younger than her sister, being at her death but ﬁfteen
years and eight months old. She left many things, both prose and verse, which were
deemed worthy of publication, and which excited great interest. The largest was a poem
called Leonore.

Memoirs of these interesting young women were written by Miss Sedgwick and by Wash-
ington Irving.

A volume of selections from the writings, chieﬂy poetical, of Mrs. Margaret M. Davidson,
the mother, was published with a preface by Miss Sedgwick. “Mrs. Davidson has some
command of language, and a knowledge of versiﬁcation, . . . but her writings are interest-
ing only as indexes to the early culture of her daughters.” — Gmswold.

II. MISCELLANEOUS PROSE VVRITERS.

Charles Brockden Brown.

CHARLES BROCKDEN BROVVN, 1771-1810, was a novelist of good repute,
and was the ﬁrst'American of any considerable note who made literature a
profession. Two of his novels, Arthur Mervyn and Edgar Huntley, have
taken a place in Bentley’ s Library of Standard Romance.

Brown was a native of Philadelphia, and a descendant from those who came over in the
same ship with William Penn. His works, as a novelist, though celebrated in their day,
were not of the highest order of ﬁctitious writing. His forte was not in the delineation of
character, or of actual life, but in creating scenes of thrilling and even horrible interest.
In this he had undoubtedly great powers of invention. His novels are no longer read to any
extent, and he himself is nearly forgotten, except, among those curious in literary history.
The following are the names of his novels : Wieland, or the Transformation; Ormond; Arthur
Mervyn; Edgar Huntley; Clara Howard; Jane Talbot; Sky-Walk, or the Man Unknown to
himself. Mr. Brown made several attempts towards establishing a literary magazine, but
did not succeed. This was not from want of the literary ability needed for such an enter-
prise, for he seems to have had special ﬁtness for such work, but there was at that time no
adequate demand in America for a literary magazine.

112 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Mr. Brown wrote several political pamphlets, which were well received.

He was eye-witness to the terrible scenes of the yellow fever in Philadelphia in 1793, and
afterwards in New York, in 1798, at which time he was a resident in that city. These hor-
rors found expression in one of his novels, Arthur Mervyn, where the condition of Philadel-
phia in the time of the yellow fever is described with a vividness equal to De Foe’s descrip-
tion of London in the time of the Great Plague.

JOSEPH DENNIE, 1768-1812, is associated with the early beginnings of a native literature

‘in America, after the war of Independence. He was a native of Boston, and a graduate of

Harvard. He studied law, but having no taste for the profession, addicted himself to liter-
ature. He published for some time, in Boston, The Tatler, and then, in New Hampshire.
The Farmer’s Museum, but ﬁnally settled in Philadelphia, where he established The Port-
folio, and enjoyed a great reputation as an elegant writer. “ It was natural to overrate him,
as in his time we had very few writers with whom he could be compared. For several years
after the death of Brockden Brown, I believe he [Dennie] was the only man in the country
who made literature a profession.” —— Griswold.

Robert Walsh.

ROBERT WALSH, LL. D., 1784-1859, after Brown and Dennie, was for a
long time the chief representative of Philadelphia in the literary World.
Although the author of no great Work, he was eminently a man of letters,
and he did much towards making Philadelphia a leading literary centre.

Mr. Walsh was born in Baltimore, and educated at ‘St. Mary’s College in that city, and at
the Jesuit College in Georgetown. After residing for several years in Europe, he settled in
Philadelphia, at the age of twenty—four, and was admitted to the bar, but did not practise.
His tastes and habits were all literary, and he gave himself at once to the life of a journalist
and a man of letters. He began his literary career as a writer for Dennie’s Portfolio.

In 1809 he published A Letter on the Genius and Disposition of the French Government,

commenting severely on the measures of Napoleon. The work was received with favor not

only in America, but in England, where it passed through four editions and was heartily
endorsed in an article in the Edinburgh Review. In 1811, he began The American Review,
the ﬁrst Quarterly ever attempted in the United States. It survived only two years, nearly
all the articles being written by the editor. In 1813, he published Correspondence with
Robert Goodloe Harper respecting Russia, and An Essay on the Future State of Europe. In
1817, he became editor of The American Register, a statistical publication which lasted only
two years. In 1818, he published, in Delaplaine’s Repository, A Memoir of Benjamin
Franklin.

In 1818 appeared Mr. Walsh’s largest work," An Appeal from the Judgments of Great

Britain respecting the United States. It was an 8vo of 512 closely printed pages. The essay _

was occasioned by the continued and systematic calumnies and disparagements of the Brit-
ish journals, and particularly of the great Quarterly Reviews of both political parties, the
Edinburgh and the London Quarterly, in regard to the American Government and people.
Mr. Walsh took up the subject in a digniﬁed and calm, but energetic manner, and brought
such an array of facts and reasoning to bear upon it as to produce a marked change of tone
in the British manner of treatment of American topics.

In 1821, Mr. Walsh began the publication of the National Gazette, which he continued to
edit with great ability for ﬁfteen years, and to which he gave more of a literary character
than had before beengiven to daily newspapers. In 1827 he resuscitated The American
Review, and continued it for ten years.

In 1837, Mr. Walsh retired from the Gazette, and published at the same time Didactics, 2

FROM 1800 To 1830. A 113

vols., consisting of editorials from the paper. From 1837 to the time of his death, he lived
in France, being for a part of the time United States consul there, and corresponding on
European aﬁ“airs for the National Intelligencer and the New York Journal of Commerce.

Although Mr Walsh survived to so recent a date, yet, his chief literary works having been
written in the early part of the century, he is considered as belonging properly to the pres-
ent chapter.

WILLIAM DUANE, 1760-1835, was born near Lake Champlain, New York, and was bred to
the trade of a printer. He passed some years in India and England, when he returned to
the United States and settled in Philadelphia, where he published for many years a political
paper, The Aurora, which exerted great inﬂuence. He was a man of marked character and
talents. Besides The Aurora, he published A Visit to Colombia; An Epitome of the Arts
and Sciences; The Mississippi Question; A Military Dictionary, etc.

MRS. SARAH HALL, 1761-1830, was a native of Philadelphia, and a daughter of the Rev.
John Ewing, D. D., Provost of the University of Pennsylvania. She was married in 17 82 to
Mr. John Hall, a wealthy planter of Maryland. After a residence of eight years in Mary-
land, she returned to Philadelphia, and continued to reside there the rest of her life. She
early imbibed a keen relish -for polite literature, and devoted much time to its pursuit.
When the Portfolio was established by Mr. Dennie, in 1810, Mrs. Hall was one of the liter-
ary circle that gathered round it and gave it celebrity. Elegant literature was then more
cultivated in Philadelphia than in any other city of the Union, and to write for the Port-
folio was no small honor. The magazine afterwards came into the hands of her son, Mr.
John E. Hall, who conducted it for ten years. During that time, she was the leading con-
tributor. In addition to her essays in the Portfolio, she prepared a work for religious in-_
struction, called Conversations on the Bible, which was received with great favor.

PHILIP H. NIQKLIN, 1786-1842, a native of Philadelphia, and a graduate of Princeton, and
Widely known as a bookseller, gave considerable attention in his later years to literary pur-
suits. He wrote Letters Descriptive of the Virginia Springs, by Peregrine Prolix ; A Pleas-
ant Peregrination through the Prettiest Parts of Pennsylvania by Peregrine Prolix (I) ; Re-
marks on Literary Property; Papers on Free Trade, etc.

William VVi1°t.

WILLIAM VVIRT, LL.D., 177 2-1834, though chieﬂy distinguished for his
legal and forensic abilities, has an honored place in literature by his British
Spy and his Life of Patrick Henry. '

Mr. Wirt was born at Bladensburg, Maryland, and lost both his parents (one Swiss, and

the other German) before he was eight years old. Through the kindness of friends and his
own exertions, however, he managed to get an education, and was admitted to the bar in

1792. He practised in various parts of Virginia, chieﬂy at Richmond, but won his ﬁrst real ‘

distinction in the famous trial of Aaron Burr for high treason, at Richmond, in 1807. His
forensic ability and his eloquence, on that occasion, gave him at once a national reputation.

_ He was Attorney—General of the United States during three successive Presidential terms,

1817-1828. After retiring from the oﬂice of Attorney-General, in 1828, he removed to Balti-
more, where hetresided for the remainder of his life, practising in the courts of that city,
and in the Supreme Court at Washington. 1

Few American statesmen of equal standing have shown such decided marks of reﬁned and
elegant culture as Mr. Wirt, and had he given himself to a life of letters, he would have won
great distinction as a writer. I-Iis publications were, Letters of the British Spy, published
originally in a Richmond paper, and purporting to be written by an Englishman travelling

through Virginia and describing what he saw; The Rainbow, a series of essays published
originally in the Richmond Inquirer; The Arguments in the Trial of Burr; The Old Bach-
elor, a collection of essays; The Life of Patrick Henry. Mr. Wirt published also numerous
Addresses on public occasions. One of these, delivered before Rutgers College, New Bruns-
wick, New Jersey, was celebrated for its eloquence. Memoirs of Wirt, 2 vols., 8vo, were
written by John P. Kennedy.
The following extract is from The British Spy :

THE BLIND PREACHER.

It was one Sunday, as I travelled through the county of Orange, that my eye was caught
by a cluster of horses tied near a ruinous, old, wooden house in the forest, not far from the
roadside. Having frequently seen such objects before, in travelling through those States, I
had no diﬂiculty in understanding that this was a place of religious Worship.

Devotion alone should have stopped me, to join in the duties of the congregation; but I
must confess, that curiosity to hear the preacher of such a wilderness, was not the least of
my motives. On entering, I was struck with his preternatural appearance. He was a tall
a11d very spare old man; his head, which was covered with a white linen cap, his shrivelled
hands, and his voice, were all shaking under the inﬂuence of a palsy ; and a few moments
ascertained to me that he was perfectly blind.

The first emotions that touched my breast were those of mingled pity and veneration.
But how soon were all my feelings changed! The lips of "Plato were never more Worthy of
a prognostic swarm of bees, than were the lips of this holy man! It was aday of the ad-
ministration of the Sacrament; and his subject was, of course, the passion of our Saviour.
I have heard the subject handled a thousand times: I had thought it exhausted long ago.
Little did I suppose that in the wild woods of America, I was to meet with a man whose
eloquence would give to this topic a new and more sublime pathos than I had ever be-

, fore witnessed.

As he descended from the pulpit to distribute the mystic symbols, there was a peculiar,
a more than human solemnity in his air and manner, which made my blood run cold, and
my whole frame shiver.

He then drew a picture of the sufferings of our Saviour; his trial before Pilate; his
ascent up Calvary; his cruciﬁxion; and his death. I knew the whole history; but never
until then had I heard the circumstances so selected, so arranged, so colored! It was all
new; and I seemed to have heard it for the ﬁrst time in my life. His enunciation was
so deliberate that_his voice trembled on every syllable; and every heart iii the assembly
trembled in unison. His peculiar phrases had the force of description, that the original

‘scene appeared to be at that moment acting before our eyes. We saw the very faces of

the Jews; the staring, frightful distortions -of malice and rage. We saw the buffet: my
soul kindled with a ﬂame of indignation; and my hands were involuntarily and convul-
sively clinched.

But when he came to touch on the patience, the forgiving meekness of our Saviour;
when he drew, to the life, his blessed eyes streaming in tears to heaven; his voice breath-
ing to God a soft and gentle prayer of pardon on his enemies, “Father, forgive them,
for they know not what they do,”--the voice of the preacher, which had all along fal-
tered, grew fainter and fainter, ‘until, his utterance being entirely obstructed by the force
of his feelings, he raised his handkerchief to his eyes, and burst into a loud and irrepress-

ible ﬂood of grief. The effect is inconceivable. The whole house resounded with the mingled.

groans, and sobs, and shrieks of the congregation. ,

It was some time before the tumult had subsided, so far as to permit him to proceed.
Indeed, judging by the usual, but fallacious standard of my own Weakness, I began to be
very uneasy for the situation of the preacher. For I could not conceive how he would be able
to let his audience down from the height to which he had wound them, without impairing
the solemnity and dignity of his subject, or perhaps shocking them by the abruptness

FROM 1800 To 1830. 115

of the fall. But—-no: the descent was as beautiful and sublime as the elevation had
been rapid and enthusiastic.

The ﬁrst sentence, with which he broke the awful silence, was a quotation from Rousseau:
“Socrates died like a philosopher, but Jesus Christ, like a God! ”

I despair of giving you any idea of the effect produced by this short sentence, unless
you could perfectly conceive the whole manner of the man, as well as the peculiar crisis
in the discourse. Never before did I completely understand what Demosthenes meant by
laying such stress on delivery. You are to bring before you the venerable ﬁgure of the
preacher; his blindness,'constantly recalling to your recollection old IIomer, Ossian, and
Milton, and associating with his performance the melancholy grandeur of their geniuses ;
you are to imagine that you hear his slow, solemn, well-accented enunciation, and his
voice of affecting, trembling melody ; you are to remember the pitch of passion and enthu-
siasm to which the congregation were raised; and then thefew moments of portentous,
deathlike silence which reigned throughout the house: the preacher removing his white
handkerchief from his aged face, (even yet wet from the recent torrent of his tears,) and
slowly stretching forth the palsied hand which holds it, begins the sentence, “Socrates
died like a philosopher,”-—then, pausing, raising his other hand, pressing them both,
clasped together, with warmth and energy, to his breast, lifting his “sightless balls” to
heaven, and pouring his whole soul into his tremulous voice— “but Jesus Christ -— like
a God!” If it had indeed and in truth been an angel of light, the effect could scarcely
have been more divine.

WILLIAM CRAFTS, 1787-1826, was a native of Charleston, South Carolina, and for some
time Editor of the Charleston Courier. He was prominent as a lawyer, and was at differ-
ent times a member of the State Senate and House of Representatives. He wrote numer-
ous Addresses and Speeches for public occasions, and also published some poems.

WILLIAM ELLIOTT, 1788 -——-, born at Beaufort, South Carolina, and a political writer of
some note, wrote Fiesco, a tragedy ; Carolina Sports by Land and Water.

William Dunlap.

VVILLIAM DUNLAP, 17 66-1839, acquired considerable note in his day by
his various reminiscences and especially by his sketches of American the-
atrical life.

painter, and also wrote several entertaining books: Life of George Frederick Cooke; The
American Theatre; History of the Arts of Design in the United States; Thirty Years Ago,
a novel; History of New York; Life of Charles Brockden Brown, etc.

SAMUEL LATHAM MITCHILL, LL. D., 1764-1831, was for many years one of the notabilities in
the scientiﬁc and literary circles of New York city.

Dr. Mitchill was Professor of Chemistry, Natural History, and Philosophy in Columbia
College. He helped to found the Lyceum of Natural History of New York. He took an

active part in public and political affairs, and at different times represented the State at’

THE BROTHERS IRVING. The brothers of VVashington Irving were all engaged, more or less.
in literary pursuits.—-—WILLIAM IRVING, 1706——1821, contributed the poetry and hints and
sketches for some of the essays in Sa1magundi.——-PETER IRVING, 1771-1838; edited the Morn-
ing Chronicle. He projected, with his brother Washington, the sketches which the latter

Peter Irving. John Irving made himself conspicuous by his poetical attacks upon his politi-
cal opponents. His son, also named John Treat Irving, is known by his Sketches of the
Pawnee Indians, and by two novels, The Attorney, and Harry Harson.

MRS. TARITHA TENNEY, 1762-1837, acquired considerable celebrity by the publication of a
humorous work, called Female Quixotism. In this amusing novel, a young woman, Dorcas

A Sheldon, acquires ridiculous notions of life by excessive reading of the Rosa-Matilda novels

of the last century, and the various follies into which this romantic sentimentalism leads
her are hit oﬁ” with much good-natured wit.

Mrs. Tenney was the wife of Hon. Samuel Tenney, a surgeon in the old Continental ‘army,
and in 1800 a Member of Congress. She was a native and a life-long resident of Exeter, New
Hampshire, and‘ sprang on the father’s side from the’Gihnans, and on the mother’s side

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 117

was licensed to preach the gospel, but abandoned the profession and became a scoﬁing inﬁ-
del. He wrote a volume, Grounds of Christianity Examined, which was answered at length
by Edward Everett, then a young man not quite twenty-one. English published afterwards
Five Smooth Stones out of the Brook, intended as a reply to Everett; also, A Letter to Mr.
Cary, and A Letter to Dr. Channing, in reply to their strictures on the same subject. His
roving disposition showed itself in other things, besides his religious opinions. He entered
the service of the Pasha of Egypt, and was reputed to have become a Mussulman.

Timothy Flint.

REV. TIMOTHY FLINT, 1780-1840, was -one of the pioneers of literature

‘in the VVestern States. His Valley of th-e Mississippi was a work of de-

cided literary merit, and by its attractive pages helped materially to people
the region which it describes. "

Mr. Flint was a native of Massachusetts and a graduate of Harvard. After preach-

_ ing some time in his native State, he went, in 1815, as a missionary to the West, and

spent ten years preaching and teaching in various parts of the Mississippi Valley. On
returning to the East, he spent the remaining years of his life chieﬂy in literary pursuits.
Besides someeditorial labors on the Knickerbocker Magazine and the Western Monthly,
he published: Recollections of Ten Years in the Valley of the Mississippi; A Condensed
Geography and History of the Western States in the Mississippi Valley; Francis Berrian,
or The Mexican Patriot, purporting to be the autobiography of a New England adventurer,
who acted a conspicuous part in the ﬁrst Mexican Revolution and in the overthrow of Itur-
bide; Indian War in the West; Memoir of Daniel Boone, the ﬁrst settler of Kentucky;
George Mason, the Young Backwoodsman; The Shoshonee Valley, a Romance; Arthur
Clemming, a Novel; The Old Bachelor Reclaimed, etc.

CAPT. JOHN C. SYMMES, 1788-1829, a native of New Jersey, made himself notorious in the
early part of the century by promulgating a theory that the earth was hollow, open at the
poles, and habitable within. He collected industriously a great many facts which favored
his theory, published a volume on the subject, Symmes’s Theory of Concentric Spheres, and
travelled about the country lecturing on the subject, and trying to get up an expedition for
testing the truth of his theory. Some of the facts now used to prove an open polar see. were
ﬁrst observed by Capt. Symmes.

III. SCIENTIFIC WRITERS.

\/Vilson the O rnithologist.

ALEXANDER VVILSON, 1766-1813, was the founder of American Orni-
thology, and his great Work on the birds of the United States was not only
the earliest, but in some respects the best that has been Written on that
subject.

Wilson was born at Paisley, Scotland. He was a weaver by trade, but was by nature of "a.
restless disposition, and spent many years alternately weaving at the loom and travelling
about peddling his wares. Before lea.ving Scotland, he published a volume of poems, hu-
morous, satirical, and serious; also, anonymously, the poem of Watty and Meg, of which
one hundred thousand copies were sold. In 1794 he emigrated to America and settled in
Pl;ila«le‘.phia. After a brief trial at copperplate engraving, and at weaving and peddling,
he turned his hand to school-keeping, first at Frankford, then at Milestown, nea1-Philadel--

iphia, then in Bloomﬁeld, New Jersey, and then again at Kingsessing, near Philadelphia.

At Kingsessing, he made the acquaintance of William Bartram, the well-known naturalist.
That association determined Wilson’s future career. Bartram encouraged Wilson’s taste for
natural history and gave him facilities for its pursuit.

Wilson also fell in with Lawson the engraver, who gave him lessons in drawing and
etching, and who ﬁnally engraved the greater part of the drawings for the Ornithology.

’ VVilson’s most substantial pa.tron, however, was William Bradford the publisher, who
Was then reprinting Rees’s Cyclopedia, and who employed Wilson at a liberal salary to
superintend the publication. This relieved him from the drudgery and conﬁnement of the
school-room, and gave him leisure and means for undertaking the great work on which his
heart was now set. Henceforward, to the end of his life, all his leisure and all his available
income were directed to this end.

The ﬁrst of the nine volumes contemplated was completed in 1808, the plates being
engraved by Lawson and colored by himself with assistance from Leslie the painter. The
edition consisted of only two hundred copies, the subscription for the whole work being
$120 a copy. Wilson courageously set off on a tramp through New England, and through
the Southern States, collecting new specimens, and trying to get subscribers. The narra-
tive of his diﬂiculties and adventures is alternately amusing and appalling. But he never
faltered, and before his death, in 1813, he saw the seventh volume completed. The eighth
volume was nearly through the press when the author died. His friend and biographer,
and the companion of many of his rambles, Mr. George Ord, superintended the printing of
the remainder. Ord also wrote the letter-press descriptions for the ninth volume. “The
work made 9 vols. imperial 4to, with plates engraved and colored from original drawings
taken from nature. The title was American Ornithology, or The Natural llistory of the
Birds of the United States.

Like Audubon, and like every great Ornithologist worthy of the name, Wilson was a poet
as well as a man of science. Ile had an eye to see the beauty of the bird‘s life as well as of
his plumage, and records the doings and the ways of his little friends with the fondness of
a lover and the imagination of an artist.

Wilson’s intense love for his subject and the intrinsic beauty of the theme itself seem to
have had a transforming and educating inﬂuence on the man. When writing on some
favorite bird he is no longer the more scientiﬁc naturalist, but rises into the region of poetic
fancy. There is nothing in Irving or Goldsmith ﬁner, as mere literary efforts, than some
of Wilson’s descriptions of the birds of his acquaintance.

THE MOCKING-BIRD.

The plumage of _tl1e Mocking-bird, though none of the homeliest, has nothing gaudy or
brilliant in it; and, had he nothing else to recommend him, would scarcely entitle him to
notice; but his ﬁgure is well proportioned, and even handsome. The ease, elegance, and
rapidity of his movements, the animation of his eye, and the intelligence he displays in

listening and laying up lessons from every species of the feathered creation Within his ,

hearing, are really surprising, and mark the peculiarity of his genius. To these qualities
we may add that of a voice full, strong, and musical, and capable of almost every modula-
tion, from the clear, mellow tones of the \.Vood-Thrush to the savage scream of the Bald
Eagle. In measure and accent he faithfully follows his originals. In force and sweetness
of expression he greatly improves upon them.

In his native groves, mounted upon the top of a tall bush or half-grown tree, in the dawn
of dew y morning, while the woods areialready vocal with a multitude of Warblers, his admi-
rable song rises pre-eminent over every competitor. The ear can listen to his music alone, to
Which that of all the others seems a mere accompaniment. Neither is this strain altogether

FROM 1800 To 1830. 119

imitative. His own native notes, which are easily distinguishable by such as are well
acquainted with those of our various song birds, are bold and full, and varied seemingly
beyond all limits. They consist of short expressions of two, three, or at the most ﬁve or six
syllables; generally interspersed with imitations, and all of them uttered with great em-
phasis and rapidity; and continued, with undiminished ardor, for half an hour, or an hour
at a time.

His expanded wings and tail glistening with white, and the buoyant gayety of his action
arresting the eye, as his song most irresistibly does the ear, he sweeps round with enthu-
siastic ecstasy——he mounts and descends as his song swells or dies away; and, as my friend
Mr. Bartram has beautifully expressed it, “He bounds aloft with the celerity of an arrow,
as if to recover his very soul, which expired in the last elevated strain.” While thus
exerting himself, a bystander, destitute of sight, would suppose that the whole feathered

V tribes had assembled together, on a trial of skill, each striving to produce his utmost effect,

so perfect are his imitations. He many times deceives the sportsman, and sends him in
search of birds that perhaps are not within miles of him; but whose notes he exactly imi-
tates. Even birds themselves are frequently imposed upon by this admirable mimic, and
are decoyed by the fancied calls of their mates; or dive, with precipitation, into the depths
ot' thickets, at the scream of what they suppose to be the Sparrow Hawk.

The. Mocking-bird loses little of the power and energy of his song by conﬁnement. In his
domesticated state, when he commences his career of song, it is impossible to stand by unin-
terested. He whistles for the dog: Caesar starts up, wags his tail, and runs to meet his
master. He squeaks out like a hurt chicken, and the hen hurries about with hanging
wings and bristled feathers, clucking to protect her injured brood. He runs over the quiv-
erings of the Canary and the clear whistle of the Virginia Nightingale or Red-bird, with
such superior execution and effect, that the mortiﬁed songsters feel their own inferiority,
and become altogether silent; while he seems to triumph over their defeat by redoubling
his exertions. . .

His excessive fondness for variety, however, in the opinion of some, injures his song. His
elevated imitations of the Brown Thrush are frequently interrupted by the crowing of cocks;
and the warbling of the Blue-bird, which he exquisitely manages,are mingled with the
screaming of Swallows or the cackling of hens; amidst the simple melody of the Robin we
are suddenly surprised by the shrill reiterations of the W'hippoorwill, while the notes of
the Kildeer, Blue Jay, Martin, Baltimore, and twenty others, succeed, with such imposing
reality, that we look round for the originals, and discover, with astonishment, that the sole
performer in this singular concert is the admirable bird now before us. During this exhibi-
tion of his powers, he spreads his wings, expands his tail, and throws himself around the
cage in all the ecstasy of enthusiasm, seeming not only to sing, but to dance, keeping meas-
ure of his own music. Both in his native and his domesticated state, during the solemn still-
ness of night, as soon as the moon rises in silent majesty, he begins his delightful solo; and
Serenades us with a full display of his vocal powers, making the whole neighborhood ring
with his inimitable medley.

THE BALD EAGLE.

This distinguished bird, as he is the most beautiful of his tribe in this part of the world,
and the adopted emblem of our country, is entitled to particular notice. He has been long
known to naturalists, being common to both continents, and occasionally met with from a
very high northern latitude, to the borders of the torrid zone, but chieﬂy in the vicinity of
the sea, and along the shores and cliffs of our lakes and large rivers. Formed by nature for
braving the severest cold; feeding equally on the produce of the sea and of the land; pos-
sessing powers of ﬂight capable of outstripping even the tempests themselves; unawed by

anything but man ; and from the ethereal heights to which he soars, looking abroad, at one-

glance, on an immeasurable expanse of forests, ﬁelds, lakes and ocean, deep below him; he
appears indifferent to the little localities of change of seasons; as in a few minutes he can

pass from summer to winter, from the lower to the higher regions of the atmosphere, the
abode of eternal cold; and thence descend at will to the torrid or arctic regions of the earth.
He is, therefore, found at all seasons in the countries which he inhabits; but prefers such
places as have been mentioned above, from the great partiality he has for ﬁsh.

In procuring these he displays, in a very singular manner, the genius and energy of his
character, which is ﬁerce, contemplative, daring a.nd tyrannical; attributes not exerted but
on particular occasions; but when put forth, overpowering all opposition. Elevated upon a
high dead limb of some gigantic tree, that commands a wide view of the neighboring shore
and ocean, he seems calmly to contemplate the motions of the various feathered tribes that
pursue their busy avocations below; the snow-white gulls slowly winnowing the air; the
busy Tringze coursing along the sands; trains of ducks streaming over the surface; silent
and watchful cranes, intent and wading; clamorous crows, and all the winged multitudes
that subsist by the bounty of this vast liquid magazine of nature.

Iligh over all these hovers one whose action instantly arrests all his attention. By his
wide curvature of wing, and sudden suspension in air, he knows him to be the ]3‘isl1—hawk,
settling over some devoted victim of the deep. His eye kindles at the sight, and balancing
himself, with half—opened wings, on the branch, he watches the result. Down, rapid as an
arrow from heaven, descends the distant object of his attention, the roar of its wings reach-
ing the ear as it disappears in the deep, making the surges foam around. At this moment
the looks of the Eagle are all ardor ; and levelling his neck for ﬂight, he sees the Fish-hawk
emerge, struggling with his prey, and mounting into the air with screams of exultation.
These are the signals for our hero, who, launching into the air, instantly gives chase, soon
gains on the Fish‘-hawk; each exerts his utmost to mount above the other, displaying in
these rencontres the most elegant and sublime aerial evolutions. The unincumbered Eagle
rapidly advances, and is just on the point of reaching his opponent, when with a sudden
scream, probably of despair and honest execrat-ion, the latter drops his ﬁsh; the Eagle pois-
ing himself for a moment, as if to take a more certain aim, descends like a whirlwind,
snatches it in his grasp ere it reaches the water, and bears his ill-gotten booty silently away
to the woods. , —

Audubon.

JOHN JAMES AUDUBON, 1780-1851, Was a worthy successor of VVilson,
in the Walk of Ornithology. Audubon’s work, The Birds of America,
equalled VVilson’s in the poetical beauty of the descriptions, and surpassed
it in the splendor of the engraving and coloring.

Audubon was a resident of Louisiana, of French descent, the son of an admiral in the
French navy. He engaged at first in commercial pursuits, but ﬁnding himself strongly
drawn towards the study of birds, he concluded to follow the bent of his mind, and gave him-
self up entirely to his favorite pursuit, travelling in every direction in the collection of
materials.

After nearly half a lifetime spent in this manner, Audubon visited Europe to obtain sub-
scribers to his great work, The Birds of America. He was everywhere received with ap-
plause. The most distinguished men of the time, Brewster, Cuvier, Humboldt, Herschel, Sir
Walter Scott, Jeffrey, Wilson,‘and others of that stamp, shared a warm interest both in him
and his work, and he proceeded at once with the publication.

VVilson, of Blackwood’s Magazine, said of him: “The hearts of all warmed towards
Audubon, who were capable of conceiving the difficulties, danger, and sacrifices that must
have been encountered, endured, and overcome, before genius could have embodied these,
the /glory of its innumerable triumphs. The man himself is just what you would expect
from his production ; full of ﬁne enthusiasm and intelligence, most interesting in his looks
and manners, aperfect gentleman, and esteemed by all who know him for the simplicity and
frankness of his nature. He is the greatest artist in his own walk that ever livec .”

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 121

The subscription price of the work was $1000. It contained 448 plates of birds of the
natural size, engraved from his original drawings and beautifully colored. The engravings
ﬁlled 5 folio volumes, and the descriptions ﬁlled 5 volumes more, 8vo.

Audubon published also, in connection with his sons, Quadrupeds of North America, in 3
vols., folio, 150 plates, with 3 vols., 8vo, of descriptions.

Audubon’s work not only Won for himself universal renown but gave to the study of
ornithology a new infpulse, under which it has since made prodigious advances. It is diffi-
cult to say which is most fascinating, his pictures of the birds, which were manifestly drawn
with a loving hand, or his (1 scription of their habits and of his solitary rambles in studying

THE RAMB LES OF A N ATURALIST.

The life which I have led has been in some respects a singular one. Think of a person,
intent on such pursuits as mine have been, aroused at early dawn from his rude couch on
the alder-fringed brook of some northern valley, or in the midst of some yet unexplored
forest of the West, or perhaps on the soft and warm sands of the Florida shores, and lis-
tening to the. pleasing; melodies of songsters innumerable saluting the magniﬁcent orb, from
whose radiant inﬂuence the creatures of many worlds receive life and light. Refreshed and
reinvigorated by healthful rest, he starts upon his feet, gathers up his store of curiosities,
buckles on his knapsack, shoulders his trusty ﬁrelock, says a kind word to his faithful dog,
and recommences his pursuit of zoological knowledge. Now the morning is spent, and a
squirrel or a trout affords him repast. Should the day be warm, he reposes for a time under
the shade of some tree. The woodland choristers again burst forth into song, and he starts
anew to wander wherever his fancy may direct him, or the object of his search may lead

him in pursuit. When evening approaches, and the birds are seen betaking themselves to.

the retreats, he looks for some place of safety, erects his shed of green boughs, kindles his
ﬁre, prepares his meal, and as the widgeon or blue-winged teal, or perhaps the breast of a
turkey or‘a steak of vension, sends its delicious perfumes abroad, he enters into his parch-
ment-bound journal the remarkable incidents and facts that have occurred in the course of
the day. ‘Darkness has now drawn her sable curtain overthe scene; his repast is ﬁnished,
and kneeling on the earth, he raises his soul to heaven, grateful for the protection that has
been granted to him, and the sense of the divine presence in this solitary place. Then wish-
ing a cordial good-night to all the dear friends at home, the American woodsman wraps

himself up in his blanket, and closing his eyes, soon falls into the comfortable sleep which

never fails him on such occasions.

THE HUMMINGr—BIRD.

Where is the person, who, on observing this glittering fragment of the rainbow, would
not pause, admire, and instantly turn his mind with reverence towards the Almighty Crea-
tor, the wonders of whose hand we at every step discover, and of whose sublime conceptions
we everywhere observe the manifestations in his admirable system of creation? There
breathes not such a person; so kindly have we all been blessed with that intuitive and
noble feeling —— admiration I

No sooner has the returning sun again introduced the vernal season, and caused millions
of plants to expand their leaves and blossoms to his genial beams, than the little hummin g-
bird is seen advancing on fairy wings, carefully visiting every opening ﬂower-cup, and, like
a curious ﬂorist, removing from each the injurious insects that otherwise would ere long
cause their beauteous petals to droop and decay. Poised in the air, it is observed peeping
cautiously, and with sparkling eye, into their innermost recesses, whilst the ethereal mo-

tions of his pinions, so rapid and so light, appear to fan and cool the ﬂower, without injur- .

ing its fragile texture, and produce a delightful murmuring sound, well adapted for lulling
the insects to repose, . . . . ‘

122 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

The prairies, the ﬁelds, the orchards and gardens, nay, the deepest shades of the forests
are all visited in their turn, and everywhere the little bird meets with pleasure and with
food. Its gorgeous throat in beauty and brilliancy baﬁies all competition. Now it glows
with a ﬁery hue, and again it is changed to the deepest velvety black. The upper parts of
its delicate body are of resplendent changing green; and it throws itself through the air
with a swiftness and vivacity hardly conceivable. It moves from one ﬂower to another like
a gleam of light, upwards, downwards, to the right and to the left. In this manner it
searches the extreme northern portions of our country, following with great precaution the
advances of the season, and retreats with equal care at the approach of autumn.

Duponceau.

PETER S. DUPONCEAU, 1760-1844, of Philadelphia, gained for himself
a European fame by his Memoir on the Indian Languages of North
America.

Mr. Duponceau was a native of France. He came to the United States as aid to Baron
Steuben, and rose to eminence in civil life. He entered the legal profession, and settled in
Philadelphia, where he distinguished himself by his practice as a lawyer, and by his devo-
tion to literary and philosophical pursuits. He became President of the American Phil-
osophical Society, and a Corresponding Member of the French Institute. His Memoir on
the Indian Languages gained him great applause, and a medal from the Institute of France.
His latest work in the department of linguistics was A Dissertation on the Chinese System
of Writing. He wrote numerous other learned essays.

Noah Webster.

NOAH WEBSTER, LL. D., 17 58-1843, is known the World over by his
Spelling-Book and his American Dictionary of the English Language.

Mr. Webster was born at Hartford, Connecticut, and graduated at Yale, in the class of
1778. He taught school and studied law, and in 1781 was admitted to practice. In 1783, he
published his ﬁrst work, called “Grammatical Institute of the English Language," the in-
troductory portion of which became afterwards his well-known “ Spelling-Book.” In 1785,
he travelled in the Southern States; in 1787, he taught an academy in Philadelphia; in 1788,
he projected in New York. the American Magazine, which failed; in 1789—93, he practised
law at Hartford; in 1793, he went again to New York and started another paper, advocating
Washington’s administration; from 1798 to 1812, he lived in New Haven, engaged in phil-
ological pursuits; from 1812 to 1822, he lived at Amherst, continuing his studies, and engag-
ing incidentally in the establishment of the College; from 1822 to his death in 1843 he
resided in New Haven.

Mr. Webster’s early experience as a schoolmaster led no doubt to his making a Spelling-
Book, and that in t11rn to the preparation of a Dictionary. His ﬁrst essay in the latter work
was a small aifair, called “A Compendious Dictionary,” published in 1806. By the prepara-
tion of these works, however, his mind became fully set in that direction, and henceforth
his life labor became that of writing a great, comprehensive work on this subject. Pending
the completion of this, he issued a School Dictionary in 1817.

Mr. Webster’s great work was brought out in 1828, after a continuous labor of more than
twenty years. It was published at ﬁrst in 2 vols., 4to. Under the direction of Professor
Goodrich (Dr. Webster’s son-in-law), and of Dr. Noah Porter, now President of Yale, with
the aid of a large number of fellow laborers, the work was amended and increased, from
time to time, until the appearance, in 1864, of what is known as the Revised Webster.

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 123

Dr. Webster’s ﬁrst publication, in 1783, contained the germ of a Grammar as Well as of a
Spelling-Book and a Dictionary, and he subsequently, at several different times, put forth a
text-book on English Grammar. But his labors in this line did not succeed, and are new
little known except as a matter of curious history. He published several essays also on the
errors in Jol1nson’s Dictionary, on the errors in the English translation of the Bible, and he
attempted a revised version, but did not succeed in bringing the public over to his views.
IIe wrote likewise a considerable number of pieces on political and moral subjects.

'1he'sale of Webster’s Spelling-Book, notwithstanding the large number of competitors
now in the market, is over a million of copies annually, and the entire sale is supposed to
have been over ﬁfty millions. The Dictionary, as ﬁnally revised, has also an enormous sale.
It is published in a great variety of forms, from the Imperial Quarto, of 1840 pages and
114,000 words, down to the small Primary and Pocket Dictionaries of 320 pages, 16mo.

. JOHN PICKERING, LL.D.,1772-1846, son of Colonel Timothy Pickering of Revolutionary-

memory, was a native of Salem, Massachusetts, and a graduate of Harvard, of the class of
1796. Soon after graduating, he was Secretary of Legation to Portugal, and afterwards con-
nected with the American Embassy in London. He practised law in Salem from 1801 to
1829; after that date he resided in Boston and continued his practice there until his death.
He was devoted through life to linguistic studies, and was elected to the chair of Hebrew,
and then to that of Greek, in Harvard, but declined both positions. He published A Vocabu-
lary of VVords and Phrases which are supposed to he Peculiar to the United States; On the
Adoption of a Uniform Orthography for the Indian Languages of North America; Remarks
on the Indian Languages of North America ; A Comprehensive Lexicon of the Greek Lan-
guage, which was at the time of its appearance, 1826, the best Work in English on the
subject, and which even now has not been superseded by the subsequent labors in the same
line.

FREDERICK PERCIVAL LEVERETT,1803—-1836, was a native of Boston, and a distinguished
teacherin that city. He compiled a Latin-English Lexicon, which is one of the best works
extant in English on that subject, and he had in hand, at the time of his death, the prepa-
ration of a similar Greek-English Lexicon.

JOHN D. GODMAN, 1794-1830, was a native of Annapolis, Maryland. He was at ﬁrst a printer,
then a sailor, but afterwards applied himself to the study of medicine, and rose to high dis-
tinction in the profession. He was Professor of Anatomy, ﬁrst in the Medical College at

Cincinnati, then in Rutgers Medical College, New York. Obliged by failing health to give a

up his professorship, he retired to Germantown, Pennsylvania, where he spent the closing

years. of his life. Besides some valuable contributions to medical science, of a strictly‘

professional character, he published American Natural History. 3 vols._; Rambles of a Natu-
ralist; and Addresses on various occasions. He also wrote the articles in the Encyclo-
paedia Americana to the end of the letter C.

IV. VVRITERS ON POLITICAL ECONOMY.

MATTHEW CAREY, 1760-1839, Was greatly distinguished in his day, as a
practical philanthropist and as a writer on questions of social and political
economy. He was also at that time the leading bookseller in the United
States.

Mr. Carey was an Irishman by birth, but by his liberal publications he gave offence to

the English Government and was obliged to leave. the country. He came to the United
States in 1783, and made his permanent home in Philadelphia. Besides the large book

124 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

business which he founded, he published ﬁrstathe Pennsylvania Herald, and then the
American Museum, the latter being a monthly magazine and continuing for thirteen vol-
umes. He wrote also numerous pamphlets on the topics of the day, and always with
marked effect on public opinion. Among these, were Essays on Political Economy, the
subject to which his son Henry C. Carey has given so much attention. “He [Matthew
Carey] has given more time, money, and labor to the public than any man I am acquainted
With, and intruth he has founded in Philadelphia a school of public spirit.”+John Sargecmt.
Among his bookselling enterprises, Mr. Carey, who- was himself a Catholic, published, about
1790, the ﬁrst Catholic Bible issued in the United States, and kept it in the market several
years.

TENCH COXE-, 1756-1824, was a Philadelphian, and a writer on political economy, com-
merce, and kindred subjects. Works :; Address on American Manufactures; Inquiry into
the Principles of a Commercial System for the United States; View of the United States of
America; Thoughts on Naval Powers, etc.

WILLIAM M. GOUGE, 1796 —, a native of Philadelphia, is the author of several works on
banking and currency: A Short History of Paper Money in the United States; The Ex-
pediency of Dispensing with Bank Agency and Bank Paper in the Fiscal Concerns of the
United States; History of the American Banking System, etc.

CONDY RAGUET, LL. 1)., 1784-1842, a native and resident of Philadelphia, was a man of
varied learning. He was a writer on trade, commerce, and banking, and advocated Free
Trade principles. He published An Inquiry into the Present State of the Circulating
Medium of the United States, 1815; The Principles of Free Trade; Currency and Bank-
ing, etc.

ROBERTS VAUX, 1786-1836, was born, lived, and died, in Philadelphia. He was a member
of the Society of Friends, and took an active and leading part in almost every enterprise

. of a benevolent and philanthropic character in the city of Philadelphia. Institutions for

the deaf, blind, and insane, reformatories for the vicious, associations for the relief of the
poor, had in ‘him a never-failing friend. More than all else, he took the lead in the efforts
to establish arsystem of Public Schools for the city, and may justly be considered the
founder of the system. His publications, consisting mostly of pamphlet Addresses, relate
chieﬂy to the various benevolent enterprises with which he was connected: Letter on the
Penitentiary System of Pennsylvania; The Original and Successive Efforts to Improve the
Discipline of the Prison /at Philadelphia; Annual Reports of the Controllers of the Public
Schools, of which he was for many years President; Memoirs of Ben_ja_min Lay, -Ralph
Sandiford, and Anthony Benezet, etc. '

CHARLES WILSON PEALE, 1741-1827, widely known as a painter and as the founder of
“Peale’s Museum,” was also a man of literary tastes, and wrote several works worthy of
mention: Introduction to a Course of Lectures on Natural History; The Preservation of
Health; An Essay to Promote Domestic Happiness; Economy in Fuel; An Essay on Build-
ing Wooden Bridges, etc. Mr. Peale was a native of Maryland. and resided alternately in
Philadelphia and London. -

Albert Gallatin.
ALBERT GALLATIN, 17 61-1847 , an eminent banker of New York, wrote
on banking and currency, and other kindred topics.

Mr. Gallatin was a native of Geneva, Switzerland. He came to America in 1780, and took
an active and conspicuous part in the affairs of his adopted country. He was Secretary of

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 125

the Treasury under Jefferson, and one of the leaders of the Republican (now Democratic)
party. He was a warm advocate of internal improvements, and one of the originators of the
Coast Survey. He was associated with Adams and Clay in negotiating the Treaty of Peace
with Great Britain; was minister to France from 1816 to 18:23; and in 1826 was made minis-
ter to Great Britain. 011 returning from these foreign missions he settled in New York, and
was connected with the banking system of that city. Besides his ﬁnancial and political
studies, he gave much attention to ethnography, particularly to the languages and antiqui-
ties of the Indian tribes. _

The following are Mr. Gallatin’s principal publications: Considerations on the Currency
an-d Banking System of the United States; Synopsis of the Indian Tribes; The Oregon Ques-
tion; Peace with Mexico, etc. A

Dr’. Cooper.

THOMAS COOPER, M. D., LL. D., 1759-1840, of Columbia, South Caro-
lina, Wrote much on political economy and kindred topics.

Dr. Cooper was an Englishman by birth, and a graduate of Oxford. He emigrated to the
United States with Dr. Priestley in 1792, and settled in Pennsylvania. Governor McKean
appointed him Judge. He became Professor of Chemistry in Dickinson College, Carlisle,
then in the University of Pennsylvania, and ﬁnally in Columbia College, South Carolina, of
which institution he became President. He was a man of great mental activity and of very
pronounced opinions. He wrote a good deal on political subjects, and exerted a powerful
inﬂuence in the State which he adopted as his permanent home.

Some of his publications are the following : The Bankrupt Law of America compared with
that of England; An English Version of the Institutes of Justinian ; Lectures on Political
Economy. The last years of his life were spent in revising the Statutes of South Carolina,
10 vols.

ALEXANDER B. JOHNSON, 1786 , was born at Gosport, England, but settled in 1801 at
Utica, New York, where he followed the occupation of banker and lawyer. He has writ-
ten on banking and on other subjects: Inquiry into the Nature and Value of Capital; A
Treatise on Banking; The Philosophy of Human Knowledge, or a Treatise on Language;
The Meaning of Words Analyzed into Words and Unverbal Things ; Religion in its Relations
to the Present Life; The Physiology of the Senses ; Sketches of the Literature of the United

V. LEGAL AND POLITICAL VVRITERS.

Chancellor Kent.

JAMES KENT, LL. D., 1763-1847, the distinguished Chancellor of the
State of New York, enriched the literature of his profession by his Com-
mentaries upon American Law, ——-— a work commended by the excellence of
its style as well as by its legal acumen, and received as a text-book where-
ever the subject itself is a matter of study.

Chancellor Kent was a native of Putnam County, New York. He graduated at Yale, in
the class of 1781. He commenced the practice of law in 1785; was Professor of Law in C01-
umbia College, 1793—1798 ; was City Recorder ; Judge, and subsequently Chief Justice, of the
Supreme Court of the State; and Chancellor of the State from 1814: to 1823. Being then

sixty years of age, he was, in consequence of the limitation clause of the State Constitution,
]_ 9%

obliged to retire from his oﬁice, although in the prime of his intellectual and physical life.
On retiring from the Chancellorship he reaissumedithe professorship of law at Columbia Col«
lege.

The ﬁrst edition of the Commentaries appeared 1826-1830. Since that time the work has
passed through a large number of editions. His decisions in law and in equity are contained
chieﬂy in the State reports of Caines and Johnson.

Chancellor Kent is the most eminent personage in the annals of American jurisprudence,
-— not excepting such men even as Marshall and Story. N 0 one had so large a share as had
Chancellor Kent in creating the American system of Equity. In the language of Judge’
Duer, “although when he (Kent) was appointed to the office of Chancellor, a Court of Chan-
cery existed, yet a Court of Equity, in the true sense and full signiﬁcance of the term, was
still to be created.” Again, in the words of Judge Story, “ It required such a mind, at once
liberal, comprehensive, exact, and methodical, always reverencing authorities and bound by
decisions, truepto the spirit yet more to the letter, pursuing principles with a severe and
scrupulous logic, yet blending with them the most persuasive equity,—it required such a
man, with such a mind, to unfold the doctrines of Chancery in our country, and to settle
them upon immovable foundations.”

Chancellor Kent has been called, in allusion to his Commentaries, the “ American Black-
stone.” The comparison does the Englishman the greater honor, for Kent surpassed his
predecessor in almost every feature that goes to constitute a jurist. Chancellor Kent was
profoundly versed in Roman law, and from that knowledge derived his wonderful symmetry
and breadth of culture, whereas not one in ten of the allusions to the Roman Law in Black-
stone’s Commentaries is respectably accurate. The style of the English jurist is inﬂated
and conceited; that of Kent is easy, natural, and vigorous. ‘C

Kent’s Commentaries upon American Law is the leading text-book of the present day, and
has not only made its author famous both in England and on the Continent, but has also
obtained universal recognition for the merits of the legal system which it unfolds.

Judge Story.

JOSEPH STORY, 1779-1845, is considered as ranking next to Kent as a
jurist. His great work on the Constitution of the United States contains,
from the nature of its subject,.much that is not strictly professional, and
that brings it to some extent within the range of general literature.

Judge Story was a native of Massachusetts, and a graduate of Harvard, of the class of 1798.
After rising to ‘eminence in his profession as a lawyer, and serving several terms as a
member of the legislature of Massachusetts and of the National House of Representatives,
he was appointed in 1811, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.
This office he retained until his death. From 1829 he ﬁlled the additional office of Dane pro-
fessor of law at Harvard.

Judge Story’s name is among the ﬁrst that impress themselves upon the attention of the
young American student of law, and ranks in importance second only to that of Chancellor
Kent. For thirty-four years a prominent member of the highest tribunal in the land, the
leading professor of the chief law-school, the author of the most widely read text-books,
Story’s record is indeed a glorious one in the annals of his profession. C

The mere enumeration of his labors is instructive. According to his biography, carefully
prepared by his son, Judge Story delivered 13 volumes of Circuit Court decisions, had a large
share in 35 volumes of Supreme Court decisions, prepared 13 volumes of legal treatises,
besides discourses, essays in the North American Review, drew up many important acts of
Congress, such as the Judiciary and the Crimes Act, and discharged the duties of law pro-
fessor with regularity and success. “ In quantity, all other authors in the English law,
and all judges, must yield to him the palm.”

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 127

Story’s,legal text-books, by which chieﬂy he is known to the public, are Commentaries
on the Law of Bailments (largely superseding Sir William Jones’s work), on the Constitution
of the United States, on the Conflict of Laws (translated into German and French), on Equity
Jurisprudence, on the Law of Agency, on the Law of Partnership, of Bills of Exchange,
Promissory Notes, etc.

By the breadth of research and the liberality of spirit manifested in these works, espe-
cially in the Treatise on the Conﬂict of Laws, the author earned for himself a lasting repu-
tation not only among his countrymen but also among the jurists of France, Germany, and
England. Judge Story’s works, however, all suffer from one defect. They are too diffuse.
The materials which they contain are very ample, but they are not sufficiently worked up
by the author. The young student especially is bewildered oftentimes in a labyrinth of
seemingly contradictory decisions and arguments, and feels the want of a few skilful,
trenchant words from the compiler.

HARRISON GRAY OTIS, 1765-1845, son of James Otis, was a native of Boston, and a graduate
of Harvard, of the class of 1783. He was United States Senator from 1817 to 1822, and held
various important posts. IIe was celebrated for his eloquence. He published Letters in
Defence of the Hartford Convention, Speech on restricting Slavery in Missouri, Eulogy on
Hamilton, and ‘several other orations and addresses.

JAMES SULLIVAN, LL.D., 1774-1889, was born at Saco, Maine, and graduated at Harvard, in
the class of 1792. He studied law, and practised many years in Boston, with great success.
He published Political Class-Book; Moral Class-Book; Historical Class-Book; Historical
Causes and Effects; Familiar Letters on the Public Men of the Revolution, a defence of the
old Federalists against the animadversions in J effe1'son’s Memorial; also numerous Addresses.

THOMAS ADDIS EMMET, 1764-1827, was an Irish patriot and exile, who settled in New York,

and rose to eminence there as a lawyer. He published Pieces of Irish History, in Illustra-

tion of the condition of the Catholics in Ireland. He was the brother of the famous Robert
Emmet, who was tried and executed for treason in 1803.

VVILLIAM RAWLE, 17 59-1836, a prominent member of the Philadelphia bar, was distinguished
also for his literary attainments. Several of his speeches have been published. He is gener-
ally known, however, as the author of a treatise on the Constitution of the United States
which was, for a long while, the leading manual on the subject. It has been surpassed, in
a measure, but scarcely superseded by later works.

ALEXANDER JAMES DALLAS, 1759-1817, the father of George M. Dallas, was a native of Ja-
maica, and was educated in London, where he early made the acquaintance of Dr._Johns0n
and Benjamin Franklin. Mr. Dallas emigrated to the United States in 1783, and settled in
Philadelphia. He rose to eminence at the bar, and published several valuable law books.
In addition to these, he was a frequent contributor to periodical literature, and conducted
for some time The Columbian Magazine. He published alsq, Features of Ja.y’s Treaty;
Speeches 011 the Trial of Blount; Address to the Constitutional Republicans; The Causes
and Character of the Late War (that of 1812), etc.

HENRY N. BRAGKENRIDGE, 1786 , son of the Brackenridge mentioned in the previous
chapter, and a distinguished jurist, was born in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania. Besides works on
legal subjects, he has written several of a popular character: Views of Louisiana; Voyage
to South America; Recollections of Persons and Places in the West; History of the Second
"War between the United States and Great Britain ; A Letter to Mr. Monroe.

 

JOHN TAYLOR, —- 1824, was a native of Virginia, and a graduate of Princeton, of the class
of 1790. His writings, chieﬂy political, were held in high estimation by Jefferson: Inquiry

Vindicated; Tyranny Unmasked ; New View of the Constitution of the United States ; Ara-
tor, a series of agricultural essays.‘

VI. BIOGRAPHY AND HISTORY.
Chief-Justice Marshall.

JOHN MARSHALL, 1755-1835, long Chief Justice of the United States,
connected himself with the general literature of the country by his Life of
VVashington.

Judge Marshall was a native of Virginia, and served in the war of Independence. He was
admitted to the bar, and gradually rose to the high position of Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court of the United States, retaining it from 1801 until his death.

Marshall’s Life of Washington is an able but rather heavy work. It is not so much a life
of Washington himself as of the times in which he lived, and the biographer has not suc-

ceeded in investing Washington with the attractiveness and the air of individualized reality

which such a hero demands. As a depository of valuable facts and researches, 'Marshall’s
Life will ever retain its utility; but as a biogra.phy of Washington, it has been superseded
by the works of Sparks and Irving.

Marshall’s chief service to his country was rendered in his judicial capacity. For upwards
of thirty years Chief Justice of the highest tribunal in the land, at a time when that tribunal
was literally in its infancy, Marshall, and his coadjutors animated by his spirit, laid the

‘foundations of American national jurisprudence, and developed the great body of American

constitutional law, a system from which his successors have rarely departed, and never to
their own or their country’s good. Marshall was pre‘e'minently of a judicial mind, distin-

guished for the accuracy and soundness of his judgments.

REV. MASON L. WEEMS, 1759-1825, was an Episcopal clergyman, who oﬂiciated, in the time
of W'ashington, in achurch near Mount Vernon. Later in life he was a travelling book-
agent for Matthew Carey. IIe died in Beaufort, South Carolina. He wrote a number of
popular biographies : Life of Washington; Life of lllarion; Life of Franklin ; Life of Penn;
The Old Bachelor; The Drunkard’s Looking-Glass, etc. “ Some of Mr. Wecms’s pamphlets
on drunkenness would be most admirable in their effects, but for the fact that you know
not what to believe of the narrative. There are passages of deep pathos and great eloquence
in them. His histories of Washington and Marion are very popular, but the same must be
said of them: you know not how much of ﬁction there is in them. That of Washington
has probably gone through more editions than all others, and has been read by more persons
than that of Marshall, Ramsay, Bancroft, and Irving, put together.” —— Bishop Meade.

AARON BANCROFT, D.D , 1755-1840, father of the historian, was himself a writer in good
repute. He was the author.of a Life of Washington, based on iWIarshall’s, and of a volume
of Sermons on the Doctrines of the Gospel. He was settled for more than half a century as

_ minister at Worcester, and died there in his eighty-ﬁfth year.

ABIEL HOLMES, D.D., 1763-1837, father of Oliver Wendell Holmes, was a native of Wood-

stock, Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale, of the class of 1783. IIe was a Congregational
pastor at Cambridge, Massachusetts. He wrote a Life of President Ezra Styles, a Memoir
of the French Protestants, and a History of the town of Cambridge. His great work, how-
ever, is his American Annals, published in 1805, *2 vols.. Fvo, pronounced by Jared Sparks
«to be “ the best repository of historical, chronological, and biographical knowledge respect-
ing America that can be found embodied in one volume.”

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 129

ELKANAH WATSON, 1758-1842, was born at Plymouth, Massachusetts. In the early part
of his life he visited Europe, and while there published in London an account of his travels
through the wilderness of New York. He lived many years in Pittsﬁeld, Massachusetts.
In *1815, he removed to Albany, and in 1825 to Port Kent, on Lake Champlain, where he
remained until his death. Ilis publications are : A Tour in Holland in 1784; History of the
Western Canals in New York; History of Agricultural Societies; Men and Times of the
Revolution, being his Autobiography.

Hannah Adams.

Mns. HANNAH ADAMS, 1755-1832, was the first American woman who
devoted herself to authorship. Her chief work, A View of Religions,
though new little known, was once a familiar book among all classes.

Mrs. Adams was a native of Massachusetts. Her principal work was a View of Religions,
in which she gave a comprehensive survey of the various religions of the world. The work
was well received, and had an extensive circulation, but is new little known. She wrote
also a History of New England, a-History of the Jews, and Evidences of Christianity. She
was a woman of varied learning and indomitable perseverance. She died in Bl‘0Ol{llI]O,
Massachusetts, and was buried in Mount Auburn, —-the ﬁrst person whose body was placed
in that beautiful cemetery. I

SAMUEL LORENZO KNAPP, 1784-1838, was a native of Massachusetts and a graduate of Dart~
mouth College. He edited the Boston Gazette and the Boston Monthly Magazine. He also

published a number of biographical sketches of distinguished Americans, one or two volumes-

of travels, a work in defence of Freemasonry, and one volume of short stories.

‘ THADDEUS l\’.fAsoN HARRIS, D.D., 1768-1842, was a native of Charlestown, Massachusetts, and
a graduate of Harvard, of the class of 1787. He was librarian at Harvard from 1791 to 1793,
and pastor of the Congregational Church of Dorchester the last ﬁfty years of his life.
Among his published works are the following: Discourses in favor of Freemasonry; The
Minor Encyclopedia, 4 vols.; Journal of a Tour northwest of the Alleghany Mountains;
Natural History of the Bible; Memorials of the First Church of Dorchester; Biographical
Memoirs of Oglethorpe.

At a school exhibition in Dorehester, Edward Everett, then a boy of four years, was called
upon to “ speak a piece.”. The verses were written for the young orator by the minister, Mr.
Harris. They are an interesting reminiscence of both parties. The “little roan” refers to
the color of young Everett’s hair:

THE LITTLE OR ATOR’.

Pray how should I, a little lad,
In speaking make a ﬁgure?

You’re only joking, I’m afraid,——-
Bo wait till I am bigger.

But, since you wish to hear my part,
And urge me to begin it,

I’ll strive for praise, with all my heart,
Though small the hope to win it.

I’ll tell a tale how farmer John
A little roan-colt bred, sir,

I

130 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

And every night and every morn
He water’d and he fed, sir.

Said neighbour Joe to farmer John,
“Arn’t you a silly dolt,'sir,

To spend such time and care upon
A little useless colt, sir?”

Said farmer John to neighbour Joe,
“I’ll.bring my little roan up,

Not for the good he now can do,
But will do, when he ’s grown up.”

The moral you can well espy,

7 To keep the tale from spoiling;

The little colt, you think, is I,—
I know it by your smiling.

And now, my friends, please to excuse
My lisping and my stammers;

I, for this once, have done my best,
And so—I"ll make my manners.

TIMOTHY PITKINS, LL.D., 1766-1847, was a native of Farmington, Connecticut, and a grad-
uate of Yale, class of 1785. He was a lawyer and a politician. He wrote Statistical View
of the Commerce of the United States; and Political and Civil History of the United States
from 1763 to 1797.

ALDEN BRADFORD, LL.D., 1765-1843, a native of Massachusetts, was the author of a History
of that State.

REV. JOSEPH B. FELT, 1789 -—, is a native of Salem, Massachusetts, and a graduate of
Dartmouth. Mr. Felt has cultivated with good results the too much neglected study of
local history. His publications are: Annals of Salem; History of Ipswich, Essex, and Hamil-
ton; Historical "Account of Massachusetts Currency, &c.

ALEXANDER GRAYDON, 1752-1818, published, in 1811, Memoirs of a Life, Passed chieﬂy in
Pennsylvania, within the Last Sixty Years. Graydon was a native of Bristol, Pennsylvania,
and was educated in Philadelphia. During the revolutionary struggle, he was brought into
contact with many of the celebrities of the times. The latter part of his life was spent in

and near Harrisburg. His Memoirs, written in his old age, are written in a lively, enter-

taining style, a.nd contain much curious information.

CHARLES MINER, 1800-1865, a man of -letters, long a resident of the Wyoming Valley in
Pennsylvania, gathered up the ﬂoating traditions of that romantic region. His publications
are: A History of Wyoming; Essays from the Desk of Poor Robert the Scribe; Ballad of
James Bird. He edited various papers in Wilkesbarre and in- West Chester.

J OHN AI{MSTRONG, 1758-1843, a native of Pennsylvania, and a general in the United States
army. He wrote War of 1812, Treatise upon Gardening, Treatise upon Agriculture, etc.

JOHN LEEDS BOSMAN, 1757—1823, a native of Maryland, and an eminent lawyer, and writer
on law. He wrote also on popular subjects, contributing both in prose and verse to Dennie’s
Portfolio. He published a History of Maryland, 2 vols., 8v0.

FROM 1800 TO 1830. 131

Isaiah Thomas.

ISAIAH THOMAS, LL.D., 17 49-1831, is chieﬂy known by his History of
Printing, 2 vols., 8vo, published in -1810.

’_l‘homas’s early history connects him with the period of the Revolution. But he lived to
be over eighty, and continued his active labors almost to the last, so that his chief doings
come within the present century. His ﬁrst public engagement was in the publication of a
newspaper, the Massachusetts Spy, in 1770. He began business in Boston, but in 1774 removed
to Worcester, where all his subsequent operations were conducted. He remained connected
with the Spy until 1801. He was concerned also with the Massachusetts Magazine, of which
eight volumes were issued, 1789-1796, and also with the Farmer’s Museum. Besides a gen-
eral book business, he published at Worcester a folio Bible, Watts’s Psalms and Hymns, and
a great variety of other works. His own chief work, the History of Printing, is held in high
estimation, especially for its notices of the early labors of the press on this continent.
Thomas published also a New England Almanac, something like the Poor Richard’s Almanac
of Franklin. Thomas’s Almanac was continued, under some change of titles, for forty-two
years. A
Thomas made himself a public benefactor by his labors and gifts in founding the American
Antiquarian Society of Worcester, — a model institution of its kind.

J EDEDIAH MORSE, D. D., 1761-1826, was the father of Geography, in this country. Morse’s
Geography was the first text-book on that subject introduced to any extent into the schools
of the United States. Dr. Morse was a native of Woodstock, Connecticut, and a graduate
of Yale. He distinguished himself by several geographical and historical works of value:
American Atlas, a Geographical Description of the Whole Continent of North America;
Geography Made Easy; Elements of Geography; The American Gazetteer; Annals of the
American Revolution; A (Jompendious History of New England, etc.

WxLLIAM C. WOODBRIDGE, 1795-1845, came next after Morse as a writer of Geographies. Mr.
Woodbridge was born in Connecticut, and graduated at Yale, in the class of 1811. He studied
theology, but was prevented by feeble health from preaching. He became a teacher of the
Deaf and Dumb, in Mr. Gallaudet’s Institution, at Hartford. He was one of the ﬂrst in the
United States to prepare a text-book on Geography, and his work had a great run. It was
published in three forms  Universal Geography, Ancient and Modern, the ancient part being
prepared by Mrs. Emma Willard; Rudiments of Geography ; Modern School Geography.

ROSWELL 0. SMITH, 1797-1875, was the author of a series of school-books, Geography, Gram-
mar, and Arithmetic, which had an enormous sale. They are still largely used.

VII. TH EOLOGICAL VVRITERS.

Samuel Stanhope Smith.

SAMUEL STANHOPE SMITH, D.D., LL.D., 1750-1819, seventh in the
distinguished line of Presidents of the College of New Jersey, was the
author of several important philosophical and theological Works. One
of these, On the Variety of Complexion and Figure of the Human Species,
attracted great attention in its day.

132 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Dr. Smith was a native of Pequea, Pennsylvania, and a graduate of Princeton, of the class
of 1769. He was for a time President of Hampden Sidney in Virginia; then Professor of
Moral Philosophy at Princeton; and ﬁnally, from 1794 to 1812, President of the College. Ile
married a daughter of his predecessor, Dr. Witherspoon. Dr. Smith was greatly admired for
the elegance of his manners and appearance, as well as for his eloquence as a lecturer
and preacher. Besides the work already quoted, he published Lectures on the Evidences of
the Christian Religion; Lectures on Moral and Political Philosophy ; A Comprehensive
View of the Principles of Natural and Revealed Religion ; and a Volume of Sermons.

“Viewing him [Dr. Smith] in his meridian, I have never seen his equal in elegance of
person and manners. Dignity and winning grace were remarkably united in his expressive
countenance. Ilis large blue eye had apenetration which commanded the respect of all
beholders. Notwithstanding the want of health, his cheek had a rosy tint, and his smile
lighted up the whole face. The tones of his elocution had a thrilling peculiarity, and this
was more remarkable in his preaching, in which, it is well known, he imitated the elaborate
polish of the French school.”——D7'. A7'chz'bald Alecccmcler.

HENRY KOLLOCK, D. D., 1778-1819, was a native of New Providence, New Jersey, and a
graduate of the College at Princeton. He was for many years pastor of the Presbyterian
church in Savannah,‘Georgia. His Sermons were published in 4 vols., 8vo. He was greatly
celebrated as a pulpit orator. He is said to have imitated, in his style and delivery, his in-
structor, Dr. Stanhope Smith.

SHEPPARD K. KOLLOCK, D. D., 1795 , brother to Dr. Henry Kollock, was a native of
Elizabeth, and a graduate of Princeton, New Jersey. After preaching for several years in
Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, he became in 1818 Professor of Rhetoric in tlie
University of North Carolina. In 1825 he became Pastor of the church in Norfolk, Virginia,
and continued in it ten years. He afterwards returned to New Jersey, and was for a time
Secretary of the Board of Domestic Missions. He published a Biography of Rev. Henry
Kollock; Ministerial Character; Best Method of Delivering Sermons ; Treatise on the Per-
severance of the Saints; Pastoral R-eminiscences, etc. I

Ashbel Green.
ASHBEL GREEN, D.D., 1762-1848, eighth President of the College of

New Jersey, was one of the distinguished lights and ornaments of the

Presbyterian Church «in the United States. He published several separate
works, but the great bulk of his writings is contained in the volumes of The
Christian Advocate, a religious monthly which he edited, and a large part
of which he wrote.

Dr. Green was a native of Hanover, New Jersey, and was graduated at Princeton, under
the Presidency of Dr. Witherspoon, in the class ot'1783. At the time of his graduation, the
Congress of the United States was meeting at Princeton, and being present on the platform
during the exercises, young Green, who was the Valedictorian, made an address to Wash-
ington which was long remembered in the traditions of the College on account of its bril-
liant eloquence. In 17 87 he became pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church of Philadel-
phia, where he greatly distinguished himself as a pulpit orator. From 1792 to 1800 he
oﬂiciated as chaplain to Congress, which then met in Philadelphia. In 1812, he became
President of Princeton College. He resigned the oﬂice in 1822, and lived in retirement in
Philadelphia the remainder of his days. For twelve years of that time, 1822-1834, he pub-
lished the religious monthly already mentioned, The Christian Advocate, writing a large
part of the articles himself. The Advocate wielded a powerful inﬂuence in the Church, oc-
cupying in some respects, though in a less degree, the same position that has since been held

FROM 1800 To 1830. 133

:by the Princeton Review. In the discussions between Old and New School, which were
then beginning to rise, The Advocate held bold a.nd decided ground on the Old School side.
Dr. Green took an active and conspicuous part iii the later stages of the discussion, and in
the ﬁnal act of disruption. After that, he retired entirely from public life.

Dr. Green’s last two years, from the eigl1ty—second to the eighty-fourth, were spent in writ-
ing his autobiography. I ' 8

Besides the 12 volumes of The Christian Advocate, a large part of which was from his own
pen, he wrote An Autobiography, already named; A History of Presbyterian Missions; Lec-
tures on the Shorter Catechism; Discourses on the College of New Jersey, with a History
of the College, besides numerous pamphlet Sermons and Addresses. A Memoir of his Life,
large 8vo, was written by Dr. Joseph H. Jones.- ’

“Asa writer, his style is not unlike that of his model, Dr. Witherspoon, remarkably per-
spicuous, showing a clear perception of his subject; it is chaste, wholly free from all that is
quaint, affected, foreign, and barbarous. The grand quality of Dr. Green’s style may be said
to have been strength; by means of which, even when the thought was familiar, it was car-
ried to the mind with unusual condensation and force. His Lectures on the Shorter Cate-
chism are probably the most useful and generally popular of all his instructive works.” -
Dr. Joseph II. Jones.

Dr. Mason.

JOHN M. MASON, D.D., 1770-1829, has the reputation of having been one
of the most accomplished pulpit orators that the country has yet produced.

Dr. Mason was a native of New York city and a graduate of Columbia College. He was
Provost of Columbia College from 1811 to 1816, and President of Dickinson College, Carlisle,
from 1821 to 1824. He returned to New York in 1824, and remained there until his death.
His Sermons and other writings have been published in 2 vols., 8vo. His Oration on the
Death of Hamilton was his most celebrated performance.

CHARACTER OF HAMILTON.

He was born to be great. Whoever was second, llamilton must be first. To his stupen-
dous and versatile mind no investigation was difﬁcult, no subject presented which he did not
jlluminate. Superiority, in some particular, belongs to thousands. Pre-eminence, in what-
ever he chose to undertake, was the prerogative of Hamilton. No ﬁxed criterion could be
applied to his talents. Often has their display been supposed to have reached the limit of
human effort, and thejudgment stood ﬁrm till set aside by himself. When a cause of new mag-
nitude required new exertion, he rose, he towered, he soared; surpassing himself as he sur-
passed others. Then was nature tributary to his eloquence! Then was felt his despotism
over the heart! Touching at his pleasure every string of pity or terror, of indignation or
grief, he melted, he soothed, he roused, he agitated; alternately gentle as the dews and
awful as the thunder. Yet, great as he was in the eyes of the world, he was greater in the
eyes of those with whom he was most conversant. The greatness of most men, like objects
seen through a mist, diminishes with the distance; but llamilton, like a tower seen afar
off under a clear sky, rose in grandeur and sublimity with every step of approach. Famili-
arity with him was the parent of veneration. Over these matchless talents probity threw
her brightest lustre. Frankness, suavity, tenderness, benevolence, breathed through their
exercise. And to his family I ——but he is gone—that noble heart beats no more; that eye
of ﬁre is dimmed ; and sealed are those oracular lips. Americans, the serenest beam of your
glory is extinguished in the tomb.

JOHN H. RICE, D.D., 1777-1831, an eminent Presbyterian divine, was born in New London,
Virginia. He was for some time Tutor in Hampden Sidney College, during the Presidency

of Archibald Alexander. He preached for several years with great applause in Richmond.
In 1823, he was tendered the Presidency of Princeton College, but accepted instead of it a
Professorship in the Union Theological Seminary of Virginia. In the latter institution he
continued until his death. Dr. Rice was an eloquent speaker, and his labors in that line
were abundant. His writings are comparatively few: A Memoir of President Davies; A
Memoir of Rev. J. B. Taylor; Considerations on Religion; two articles in the Princeton
Review, and numerous contributions to The Virginia Evangelical and Literary Magazine.

T. CHARLTON HENRY, D.D., 1790-1827, a native of Philadelphia, was the eldest son of
Alexander Henry (long known as President of the American Sunday-School Union). Dr.

position until his death. He was an eloquent preacher, and was very celebrated for his
wisdom and skill as an administrator of College affairs. He published two works only, both,
however, giving evidence of power and of practised skill as a writer, and worthy of his great
fame. These were Counsels to Young Men, and Lectures on Temperance. The work last
named had a large sale and was very useful in arresting the evil of drunkenness. Dr.
Carnahan, then Presi<:lent of Princeton College, thought so highly of these Temperance Lec-
tures, at the time of their first appearance, that he called the students of the College
together, in a series of special services, and read to the students the whole of these Lectures,
saying at the same time that they contained his own sentiments, but expressed more forcibly
than he himself could express them.

Dr. Emmons.

NATHANIEL EMMONS, D.D., 1745-1840, was one of the great lights of
theology in New England during the latter part of last century and the
earlier part of this century. His Works have been published in six octavo
volumes.

Dr. Em rnons was a native of East Haddam, Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale. He lived
to his ninety-sixth year, and retained his faculties to the close. He was minister to the
church in Franklin, Massachusetts, seventy years.

Dr. Emmons held some peculiar religious views, which led to a good deal of discussion.
His style is described as being direct and forcible, but without ornament. One of his aphor-
isms, in regard to style, is this: “ Style is only the frame to hold our thoughts. It is like

136 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

the sash of a window; a heavy sash will obscure the light. The object is to have as little
sash as will hold the lights, that we may not think of the frame, but have the most light.”

One of Dr. Emmons’s sermons made a great noise at the time. It was known as his Jero-
boam Sermon. It was written on the occasion of Jeﬁ‘"erson’s inauguration as President, and
although Jefferson is not named, the delinea.tion of the character of J eroboam is such that
no one can doubt the personal application intended.

The Doctor was celebrated for his repartees, in this resembling Dr. VVitherspoon. He
often condensed his thoughts into the form of apothegms. The following are examples:
On being asked what was the best system of rhetoric for a clergyman, he gave these
two rules, “First, have something to say; secondly, say it.” Another of his sayings was
“ Be short in all religious exercises. Better have people longing than loathing. No con-
versions after the hour is out.”

Professor Park, of Andover, speaking of Dr. Emmons’s great age, makes the following
statement in regard to the habits of study and the longevity of the old New England di-
vines: “We read of the two Edwardses, Hopkins, Smalley, Stiles, Chauncy, and Dwight, as
at their books thirteen, fourteen, ﬁfteen, and sometimes eighteen hours of the day. Dr. Em-
moms, in this respect, equalled any of them. Mr. Stoddard of Northampton died at eighty-
six; Dr. Increase Mather at eighty—four; Dr. Cotton Mather at sixty-ﬁve; Dr. Stiles at sixty-
eight; Dr. Johnson at seventy-six; Dr. Hopkins at eighty-three; Dr. Bellamy at seventy-_
two; Dr. Hart at sixty-nine; President Chauncy, of Harvard, and Dr. Chauncy, of Boston,
at eighty-two; Dr. Smalley -at eighty-six; Dr. West at eighty-four; Dr. Strong at sixty-
eight; Dr. Lothrop at ninety.”

between the Unitarians and the Orthodox, and theyﬁrst decided triumph of the former, led
to a heated controversy, in which, however, Dr. Ware took no part.

Dr. Ware resigned the Professorship in 1840, in order to devote himself exclusively to the
Divinity School, and in 1842 he retired entirely from public duty. He published, in 1820,

number of years previous to his death he was minister at large, devoting his time and energy
to alleviating the condition of the Boston poor. He was'a sound vigorous writer, but his
claims upon us in this respect are thrown in the shade by the rare excellencies of his

CHAPTER IV.

FROM 1880 TO 1850.

THE period included in the present chapter was one of great
and healthy progress. With the increase. of material Wealth
came a corresponding growth in the department of letters. The
number of writers was greatly multiplied, and literature itself
began to take rank as a regular profession.

The writers included in Chapter IV. are divided into eight
sections: 1. The Poets, beginning with Poe; 2. Writers of
Novels, Tales, etc., beginning with Cooper; 3. Writers of
History and Biography, beginning with Irving; 4. Writers on
Literature and Criticism, beginning with Emerson; 5. Writers
on Political Affairs, beginning with Alexander and Edward

‘Everett; 6. Scientiﬁc VVriters, beginning with Silliman ; 7.

VVriters on Religion and Theology, beginning with Archibald
Alexander; 8. Miscellaneous Writers, beginning with Mrs. Sig-
ourney.

I. THE POETS.

Poe.

EDGAR ALLAN P013, 1811-1849, was endowed with poetical gifts of the
rarest and most wonderful kind. ‘Had he united with these gifts high moral
principle, and a power of will and of persistent labor, such as marks all
true greatness, he might have made for himself a name above that of any
yet known to American letters. The two short poems by which almost

exclusively he is known, The Raven and The Bells, although not of the A

1. 40

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 141

highest order of poetry, and only hints of What the author might have done,
are yet unique and unsurpassed in their kind.

Poe was a na-tive of Baltimore. While still very young, he was left an orphan, and
adopted by Mr. Allan, a Richmond merchant. Young Poe was sent successively to the
Univer_sity of Virginia and to ‘West Point, but was dismissed, or advised to leave, in conse-
quence of his dissipation. He also quarrelled with his benefactor, who henceforth abandoned
him. Poe resolved thereupon to lead the life of a man of letters. He became editor of
several magazines and journals, among them, The Southern Literary Messenger, The Gen-
t1eman’s Magazine, and Graham"s Magazine, besides contributing to many others. After a

‘career of reckless intemperance, in which he estranged himself from many of his friends

and harrowed the feelings of all, he died in a ﬁt of delirium tremens in the Baltimore
Hospital, at the early age of thirty-eight.

Brief and unhappy as was his career, Poe has left behind him a memorable name in the
annals of American literature. He is a remarkable instance of precocity and eccentricity
of genius. Some of his earlier poems, Written before he was twenty, are still much admired.
His genius was cast in a peculiar mould. His writings are thoroughly pervaded with the
spirit of melancholy. Poe is pre-eminently the poet of morbid anatomy.

The writings of Poe group themselves naturally into three classes: Poems, Tales, and
Literary Criticisms, collected under the heading of The Literati. Among the poems, The
Raven and The Bells stand alone. Indeed, there are no similar poems to be compared with
them in English literature. Not that they represent poetry in its highest form. The
Raven is the expression of absolute despair; The Bells is the rarest instance of the suggest-
iveness of rhyme and the power of onomatopoetic words. There is nothing exalted or
morally invigorating about them. But taken for just what they are, they must be pro-
nounced unique. The Tales are equally powerful as prose specimens. The Murder in
the Rue Morgue, The Gold Bug, The Mystery of Mary Roget, etc., are unrivalled in their
Word-painting and their power of subtle analysis. And yet, like The Raven and The Bells,
they leave the mind of the reader depressed and desponding. In his Criticisms Poe displays
altogether too much acrimony. His remarks are occasionally very just and striking, but
there runs through them all a spirit of fault-ﬁnding. Moreover, in many instances, his
judgment is completely blinded to real merit.

Could Poe have overcome his one besetting sin of intemperance, and disciplined his mind
thoroughly by severe and regular study, he might have become a leader of American
thought. The genius forisuch a position was there, but its eccentricities were not toned
down or eradicated, and hence his life was What it was ——a failure, and his works are what
they are — fragmentary and one-sided. ‘

There is a curious bit of literary history in regard to The Bells. This poem, as ﬁrst Written
by Poe and offered for publication, contained only eighteen lines, as follows :

THE BELLS.—[The original form.]

The bells l —hear the bells!

The merry wedding bells!

The little silver bells!

How fairy-like a melody there swells

From the silver tinkling cells

Of the bells, bells, bells!

Of the bells.

The bells! —ah, the bells!

The heavy iron hells!

Hear the tolling of the bells!
Hear the knells!

142 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

How horrible a monody there ﬂoats
From their throats-—
From their deep-toned throats!
How I shudder at the notes
From tl1e melancholy throats
Of the bells, bells, bells —
Of the bells-

The poem in this form came into the hands of the writer of the present volume, who was
then editing Sartain’s Magazine. Some months after the receipt of the poem,but before its
publication, Poe sent the piece altered and enlarged to nearly its present conditionf About
three months later, and before it actually saw the light, he sent me the ﬁnished poem in its
present shape. The facts are only another illustration of the gradual development of an
idea in the mind of a man of genius.

In a mad expostulation with the deaf. and frantic ﬁre,

Yet the ear, it fully knows,
By the twanging

How the danger ebbs and ﬂows;
Yet the ear distinctly tells,

How the danger sinks and swells,

What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that ﬂoats
From the rust within their throats
‘Is a groan.
And the people——ah, the people-
They that dwell up in the steeple,

Among Poe’s prose pieces is one on The Rationale of Verse, that deserves particular study.
‘One of the curiosities of this essay is that part of it in which he describes minutely the pro«
cess of his own mind in the creation of The Raven.

Halleck.

FI'rZ—GrREENE HALLECK, 17 95-1867 , wrote comparatively little, but that
little is of such‘ extraordinary excellence as to have made‘ it a matter of
general regret that the author produced no more. His Marco Bozzaris is
probably the bestwar lyric in the language.

Halleck does not seem to have enjoyed a liberal education. He was clerk in a banking-»

hoase, and afterwards conﬁdential adviser to John Jacob Astor. In 1819 he was associated
with Joseph Rodman Drake in composing the Croaker Papers, published in the Evening
Post. In 1821 he published “Fanny,” a satire upon the literature and politics of the clay.
In 1822 and 1823 he travelled in Europe, a.nd in 1827 published a small volume containing
the poems on Burns, Alnwick Castle, Marco Bozzaris and a few others, in all 32 pieces.
After that nothing further appeared from his pen.

“The poems of Fitz—Greene Halleck, although limited in quantity, are perhaps the best
known and most cherished, especially in the latitude of New York, of all American verses.
. . . The school-boy and the old Knickerbocker both know them by heart. In his serious
poems he belongs to the same school as Campbell ; and in his lighter pieces reminds us of
Beppo and the best parts of Don Juan. Fanny, conceived in the latter vein, has the point
of a ﬁne local satire gracefully executed. Burns, and the lines on the death of Drake, have
the beautiful impressiveness of the highest elegiac verse. Marco Bozzaris is perhaps the

FROM 1830 TO 1850. _ 145

best martial lyric in the language; Red Jacket the most effective Indian portrait; and
Twilight an apt piece of contemplative verse; while Alnwick Castle combines his grave and
gay style withvinimitable art and admirable effect.” —— Tue/cerman.

MARCO BOZZARIS.

At midnight, in his guarded tent,
The Turk was dreaming of the hour
When Greece, her knees in suppliance bent,
Should tremble at his power:
In dreams, through camp and court, he bore
The trophies of a conqueror;
In dreams, his song of triumph heard;
Then wore his monarch’s signet-ring:
Then pressed that monarch’s throne-—a king;
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,
As Eden’s garden-bird.

At midnight, in the forest shades,
Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,

True as the steel of their tried blades,
Heroes in heart and hand.

There had the Persian’s thousands stood,

There had the glad earth drunk their blood
On old Plateeafs day;

And now there breathed that haunted air

The sons of sires who conquered there,

With arm to strike, and soul to dare,
As quick, as far, as they.

An hour passed on—-the Turk awoke;

That bright dream was his last;
He woke—-A-to hear his sentries shriek,
“To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!”
He woke—to die midst ﬂame, and smoke,
And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke,

And death-shots falling thick and fast
As lightnings from the mountain-cloud;

-And ‘heard, with voice as trumpet loud,

Bozzaris cheer his band:
“Strike——til1 the last armed foe expires;
Strike --for your altars and your ﬁres;
Strikem-for the green graves of your sires;
God—and your native land! ”

They fought—like brave men, long and well;
They piled that ground with Moslem slain;

They conquered—-but Bozzaris fell,
Bleeding at every vein.

His few surviving comrades saw

His smile when rang their proud hurrah,
And the red ﬁeld was won:

Then saw in death his eyelids close

Calmly, as to a night’s repose,
Like ﬂowers at set of sun.

AMERICAN LITERATURE

Come to the bridal chamber, Death!
Come to the mother’s, when she feels,
For the ﬁrst time, her ﬁrst-born’s breath;
Come when the blessed seals
That close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke;
Come in consumption’s ghastly form,
The earthquake shock, the ocean-storm,
Come when the heart beats high and warm.
With banquet-song, and dance and wine;
And thou art terrible——the tear,
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
And all we know, or dream, or fear
Of agony, are thine.

But to the hero, when his sword
Has won the battle for the free, _
Thy voice sounds like a prophet’s word;
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanks of millions yet to be. I
Come, when his task of fame is wrought-==
Come, with her laurel-leaf, blood-bought—
Come in her crowning hour—and there
Thy sunken eye’s unearthly light
To him is welcome as the sight
Of sky and stars to prisoned men:
Thy grasp is welcome as the hand
Of brother in a foreign land;
Thy summons welcome as the cry
That told the Indian isles were nigh
To the world-seeking Genoese,
When the land-wind, from woods of palm,
And orange-groves, and ﬁelds of balm,
Blew o’er the Haytian seas.

Bozzaris! with the storied brave

Greece nurtured in her glory’s time,
Rest thee—there is no prouder grave,

Even in her own proud clime.

She were no funeral weeds for thee,

Nor bade the dark hearse wave its plume,
Like torn branch from death’s leaﬂess tree,
In sorrow’s pomp and pageantry,

The heartless luxury of the tomb:

But she remembers thee as one

Long loved, and for a season gone;

For thee her poet’s lyre is wreathed,
Her marble wrought, her music breathed;
For thee she rings the birthday bells;

Of thee her babe’s ﬁrst lisping, tells;

For thine her evening prayer is said

At palace couch, and cottage bed;

Her soldier, closing with the foe,

Gives for thy sake a deadlier blow;

His plightedx maiden, when she fears

For him, the joy of her young years,

Thinks of thy fate, and checks her tears:
And she, the mother of -thy boys,

Though in her eye and faded cheek

Is read the grief she will not speak,
The memory of her buried joys,

And even she who gave thee birth,

Will, by their pilgrim-circled hearth,
Talk of thy doom without a sigh:

For thou art Freedom’s now,,and Fame’ﬁ,

One of the few, the immortal names,
That were not born to die.

The stanzas of Halleck on the death of his friend, J. Rodman Drake, have already been
given in connection with the notice of that writer.

Richard Henry Dana.

RICHARD HENRY DANA, 1787 , although living to a good old age,
achieved his principal distinction in letters more than half a century ago.
His chief poem is The Buccaneer.

Mr. Dana is a native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a member of the family that has
given so many distinguished persons to the learned profession in that State. He began

public life as a lawyer, but his health not being adequate to the labors of the profession,
he adopted that of literature. He was associated for atime with Edward T. Channing in edit-

_'ing the North American Review, and wrote some valuable articles for it. His chief separate

publications are The Buccaneer, a poem; The Dying Raven; and Tom Thornton, a novel.
He gave also a course of ten Lectures on Shakespeare, which were received with great en-
thusiasm.

Mr. Dana is a thoughtful writer, and he requires too much thought on the part of the

_ reader, to be in the ordinary sense popular. His poetry especially must be studied before it

can be enjoyed. Two stanzas are given from Daybreak:

DAYBREAK.

Now, brighter than the host that all night long,
In ﬁery armor, far up in the-sky
Stood watch, thou comest to wait the morning’s song,
Thou comest to tell me day again is nigh,
Star of the dawning! Cheerful is thine eye;
And yet in the broad day it must grow dim,
Thou seen1’st to look on me, as asking why
My mourning eyes with silent tears do swim;
Thou bid’st me turn to God, and seek my rest in Him.

How suddenly that straight and glittering shaft
Shot ’thwart the earth! In crown of living ﬁre
Up comes the day! as if they conscious quaff’d—
The sunny ﬂood, hill, forest, city spire

148 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Laugh in the wakening light—Gro, vain desire!

The dusky lights are gone; go thou thy way!

And pining discontent, like them, expire!

Be call’d my chamber, PEACE, when ends the day;
And let me with the dawn, like PILG}RIM, sing and pray.

Mr. Dana is known chieﬂy as a poet. He has written, however, most admirably in prose.
In ourjudgment, indeed, his prose is much superior to ‘his verse. An extract is given from
his Lectures on Shakespeare, which were among his latest contributions to literature.

EDMUND KEAN’S LEAR.

It has been so common a saying, that Lear is the most diﬂicult of characters to personate,
that wehad taken it for granted no man could play it so as to satisfy us. Perhaps it is the
hardest to represent. Yet the part which has generally been supposed the most diﬁicult, the
insanity of Lear, is scarcely more so than that of the cboleric old king. Ineﬁicient rage is
almost always ridiculous; and an old man, with a broken-down body and a mind falling in
pieces from the violence of its uncontrolled passions, is in constant danger of exciting, along
with our pity, a feeling of contempt. It is a chance matter to which we may be most moved,
and this it is which makes the opening of Lear so diﬂicult.

We may as well notice here the objection which some make to the abrupt violence with
which Kean begins in Lear. If this be a fault, it is Shakespeare, and not Kean, who is to
blame; for, no doubt, he has conceived it according to his author. Perhaps, however, the

mistake lies in this case, where it does in most others, with those who put themselves into

the seat of judgment to pass upon great men.

In most instances, Shakespeare has given us the gradual growth of passion, with such
little accompaniments as agree with it, and go to make up the whole man. In Lear, his
object being to represent the beginning and course of insanity, he has properly enough gone
but a little back of it, and -introduced to us an old man of good feelings enough, but one who
had lived without any true principle of conduct and whose unruled passions had grown
strong with age, and were ready, upon a disappointment, to make shipwreck of an intellect
never strong. To bring this about, he begins with an abruptness rather unusual; and the
old king rushes in before us, with his passions at their height, and tearing him like ﬁends.

Kean gives this as soon as the ﬁtting occasion offers itself‘. Had he put more of melan-
choly and depression, and less of rage into the character, we should have been much puzzled
at his so suddenly going mad. It would have required the change to have been slower; and
besides, his insanity must have been of another kind. It must have been monotonous and
oomplaininginstead of continually varying; at one time full of grief, at another playful, and
then wild as the winds that roared about him,and ﬁery and sharp as the lightning that shot
by him. The truth with which be conceived this was not ﬁner than his execution of it. Not
for a moment, in his utmost violence, did he suffer the imbecility of the old man’s anger to
touch upon the ludicrous, when nothing but the j ustest conception and feeling of the char-
acter could have saved him from it. ' ’

It has been said that Lear is a study for one who would make himself acquainted with the
Workings of an insane mind. And it is hardly less true, that the acting of Kean was an
embodying of these workings. His eye, when his senses a.re ﬁrst forsaking him, giving an
inquiring look at what he saw, as if all before him was undergoing a strange and bewilder-
ing change which confused his brain,——the wandering, lost motions of his bands, which
seemed feeling for something familiar to them, on which they might take hold and be assured
of a safe rea1j.ty,—the under monotone of his voice, as if he was questioning his own being,
and What surrounded him, ——the continuous, but slight, oscillating motion of the body, —
all these expressed, with fearful truth, the bewildered state of a mind fast unsettling, and
making vain and weak efforts to ﬁnd its way back to its wonted reason. There was a child-
ish, feeble gladness in the eye, and a half-piteous smile about the mouth, at times, which one

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 149

could scarce look upon without tears. As the derangement increased upon him, his eye lost
its notice of objects about him, wandering over things as if he saw them not, and fastening
upon the creatures of his crazed brain. The helpless and delighted fondness with which he
clings to Edgar as an insane brother, is another instance of the justness of Kean’s concep-
tions. N or does he lose the air of insanity even in the ﬁne moralizing parts, and Where. he
inveighs against the corruptions of the world: there is a madness even in his reason.

The violent and immediate changes of the passions in Lear, so difficult to manage Without
jarring upon us, are given by Kean with a spirit and with a ﬁtness to nature which we had
hardly thought possible. These are equally well done both before and after the loss of reason.
The most difficult scene in this respect, is the last interview between Lear and his daughters,
Goneril and Regan, ——(and how wonderfully does Kean carry it through !) ——- the scene which
ends with the horrid shout and cry with which he runs out mad from their presence, as if
his very brain had taken ﬁre.

The last scene which we are allowed to have of Shakespeare’s Lear, for the simply pathetic,
was played by Kean with unmatched power. We sink down helpless under the oppressive
grief. It lies like a dead weight upon our hearts. VVe are denied even the relief of tears;
and are thankful for the shudder that seizes us when he kneels to his daughter in the de-
ploring weakness of his crazed grief.

It is lamentable that Kean should not be allowed to show his unequalled powers in the
last scene of Lear, as Shakespeare wrote it; and that this mighty work of genius should be
profaned by the miserable, mawkish sort of by-play of Edgar’s and Cordelia’s loves: nothing
can surpass the impertinence of the man who made the change, but the folly of those who
sanctioned it.

Pierpont.

JOHN PIERPONT, 1785-1866, published a volume of sacred verse, called
Airs of Palestine; also, a large number of short domestic lyrics which had
great popularity.

Pierpont was a native of Litchﬁeld, Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale, in the class of
1804. After being for some time tutor in the family of Col. William Allston of South Caro-
lina, he studied and began to practise law, but gave it up for merchandise, and ﬁnally, in

1816, entered the theological school at Harvard, and prepared himself for the ministry in the
Unitarian Church. He preached successively in Boston, in Troy, N. Y., and in Medford,

Massachusetts, and he travelled over various parts of Europe and Asia. Besides Writing

his poems,‘ Pierpont compiled a series of Readers which had a good run.

PASSING AWAY.

Was it the chime of a tiny bell,
That came so sweet to my dreaming ear,-
Like the silvery tones of a fairy’s shell
That the winds on the beach, so mellow and clear,
When the winds and the Waves lie together asleep,
And the moon and the fairy are Watching the deep,
She dispensing her silvery light, A
And he, his notes as silvery quite,
While the boatman listens and ships his oar,
To catch the music that comes from the shore?-
Hark! the notes, on my ear that play,
Are set to words: --as they ﬂoat, they say,
“Passing away! passing away!”

13*

AMERICAN LITERATURE.

But no; it was not a fairy’s shell,
Blown on the beach, so mellow and clear;
Nor was it the tongue of a silver bell,
Striking the hour, that ﬁll‘d my ear,
As I lay in my dream; yet was it a chime
That told of the flow of the stream of time,
For a beautiful clock from the ceiling hung,
And a plump little girl, for a pendulum swung;
(As you’ve sometimes seen, in a little ring
That hangs in his cage, a Canary bird swing;)
And she held in her bosom a budding bouquet,
And as she enjoy’d it, she seem’d to say,
“Passing away! passing away!”

0, how bright were the wheels, that told
Of the lapse of time, as they moved round slow!
And the hands as they swept o’er the dial of gold,
Seemed to point to the girl below.
And 10! she had changed!—in a few short hours
Her bouquet had become a garland of ﬂowers,
That she held in her outstretched hands and ﬂung
This way and that, as she dancing swung
In the fulness of grace and womanly pride,
That told me she soon was to be a bride;—
Yet then, when expecting her happiest day,
In the same sweet voice I heard her say,
“Passing away! passing away!”

While I! gazed at that fair one’s cheek, a shade
Of thought, or care, stole softly over,

Like that by a cloud in a summer’s day made,
Looking down on a ﬁeld of blossoming clover,

The rose yet lay on her cheek, but its ﬂush

Had so1ne.thing»lost of its brilliant blush;

And the light in her eye, and the light on the wheels,
That marched so calmly round above her,

Was a little dimmed, —as when evening steals
Upon noon’s hot face:—Yet one could n’t but love her,

For she look’d— like, a mother, whose ﬁrst babe lay
Rocked on her breast, as she swung all day;—-
And‘ she‘ seemed, in the same silver tone to say,

“Passing away! passing away!”

While yet I looked, what a change there came!
Her eye was quenched and her cheek was wan:

Stooping and staffed was her withered frame,
Yet, just as busily swung she on;

The garland beneath her had fallen to dust;

The wheels above her were eaten with rust;

The hands that over the dial swept, w _

Grew crooked and tarnished, but on they kept,

And still there came that silver tone

From the shrivelled lips of the toothless crone,-—
(Let me never forget till my-dying day
The tone or the burden of her lay,)-—

“Passing away! passing away!”

Percival.

J AMES GATES PERCIVAL, 1795-1856, was once in high repute as a poet.
He published three volumes, under the title of_ Clio, containing a miscel-
lany of prose and poetry.

Percival was a native of Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale College. His life was passed
in devotion alternately to letters and to science. He published Geological Surveys of Con-
necticut and Wisconsin, and translated,Malte Brun-‘s Geography. He was familiar with
Greek, Latin, Sanscrit, and nearly all the languages of modern Europe. One of his hobbies
consisted in imitating foreign metres. His poems were highly admired thirty or forty years

, ago, but, like those of Hillhouse, are now little read. They were first published, collectively,

in 1859. In common with that of so many of his contemporaries, much of Perciva1’s verse is
crude and extravagant. He preferred the bubble and ﬂash of momentary inspiration to the
severer but more enduring labor of correction and rejection.

TO SENECA LAKE.

On thy fair bosom, silver lake!
The wild swan spreads her snowy sail,

And round his breast the ripples break,
As down he bears before the gale.

On thy fair bosom, waveless stream!
The dipping paddle- echoes far,

And ﬂashes in the moonlight gleam,
And bright reﬂects the polar star.

The waves along thy pebbly shore,
As blows the north-wind heave their foam;
And curl around the dashing oar,
As late the boatman hies him home.

How sweet, at set of sun, to view
Thy golden mirror spreading wide,
And see the mist of mantling blue
Float round the distant mountain’s side.

At midnight hour, as shines the moon,
A sheet of silver spreads below,
And ‘swift she cuts, at highest noon,
Light clouds, like wreaths of purest snow.

On thy fair bosom, silver lake!
0! I could ever sweep the oar,
When early birds at morning wake,
And evening tells us toil is o’er.

John Howard Payne.

JOHN HOWARD PAYNE, 1792-1852, was the author of several dramatic
Works, which met with good success, but is chieﬂy known by his song of
Home, Sweet Home. '

Payne was a native of New York. He became conspicuous very early in life as a writer

.152 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

and an actor, appearing as Young Norval when only sixteen. He is the author of several
plays, Brutus, Virginius, and Charles II., and he translated many others from the French. He
engaged in various magazine enterprises in England and in the United States, and was, at
the time of his death, United States Consul at Tunis. To the general public, however, Payne
is known almost exclusively by the song Home, Sweet Home, inserted by him in one of his
plays. This song, it is needless to say, has become one of the treasures of the English lan-
guage. It brought its author both fame and a considerable share of fortune.

HOME, SVVEET HOME.

’Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,
Be it ever so humble, there ’s no place like home;
A charm from the skies seems to hallow it there,
Which, go through the world, you ’ll not meet elsewhere.

An exile from home, pleasure dazzles in vain,
Ah! give me my lowly thatched cottage again;
The birds singing sweetly, that came.to my call--
Give me them, and that peace of mind, dearer than all.
Home,_home,
Sweet home!
There ’s no place like home-—
There ’s no place like home.

Charles Sprague.

CHARLES SPRAGUE, ‘ 1791-1875, was the author of a number of short
poems which have been very popular. His Shakespeare Ode is the one
most highly prized, but none is so often quoted as The Family Meeting.

Mr. Sprague was a. native of Boston. He left school at an early age to enter into business.
For a long time he was cashier of the Globe Bank in his native city. He scarcely travelled
beyond the immediate vicinity of Boston, and devoted all his leisure time to the study of
English authors. His practical familiarity with the English poets was remarkable.- His
Ode to Shakespeare, delivered in 1823, is, according to Griswold, “one of the most vigorous
and beautiful lyrics in the language.” His long Phi Beta Kappa poem on Curiosity has had
the doubtful honor of being plagiarized entire, in Calcutta, as the work of a British officer.
Among his other, shorter poems, The Family Meeting, I See Thee Still, The Winged Wor-
shippers, etc., are also much admired.

THE FAMILY MEETING.

We are all here!
Father, Mother,
Sister, Brother,
All who hold each other dear.
Each chair is ﬁlled—we’re all at home;
To-night let no cold stranger come;
It is not often thus around
Our old familiar hearth we’re found:
Bless, then, the meeting and the spot;
For once be every care forgot;
Let gentle Peace assert her power,
And kind affection rule the hour;
We ’rc all —- all here.

FROM 1830 T() 1850. 153

We ’re not all here!
Some are away——the dead ones dear,
Who throng’d with us this ancient hearth,
And gave the hour to guiltless mirth.
Fate, with a stern, relentless hand,
Looked in and thinned our little band:
Some like a night-ﬂash passed away,
And some sank, lingering, day by day;
The quiet graveyard——some lie there-
And cruel Ocean has his share——

We ’re not all here.

We are all here!
Even they——the dead—tl1ough dead, so dear;
Fond memory to her duty true,
Brings back their faded forms to view.
How life-like, through the mist of years,
Each well-remembered face appears!
VVe see them as in times long past;
From each to each kind looks are cast;
We hear their words, their smiles behold;
They ’re round us as they were of old——
We are all here.

We are all here!

Father, Mother,

Sister, Brother,
You that I love with love so dear,
This may not long of us be said;
Soon must we join the gathered dead;
And by the hearth we now sit round,
Some other circle will be found.
01 then, that wisdom may we know,
Which yields a life of peace below!
So, in the world to follow this,
May each repeat, in words of bliss,

We ’re all—a1l here! '

SUMNER LINCOLN FAIRFIELD, 1803-1844, a native of Massachusetts, and for many years a
resident of Philadelphia, was a poet of considerable reputation. He wrote: The‘Last Night
of Pompeii; The Sisters of Saint Clare; Abaddon, The Spirit of Destruction; The Heir of the
VVorld; The Cities of the Plain. ’ ’ V

Mrs. Jane Fairﬁeld, the widow of the foregoing, is a native of Rahway, New Jersey. She
wrote A Life of S. L. Fairﬁeld.

F Miss Genevieve G. Fairﬁeld, 1832 ————, is a daughter of S. L. and Mrs. J. Fairﬁeld. She is
a native of New York. She has written Genevra, or the History of a Portrait; The Vice-
President’s Daughter; The Wife of Two Husbands; The Innkeeper’s Daughter, etc.

JOHN H. BRYANT, 1807 -—--_, a brother of William Cullen Bryant, went West in‘183l, and
settled in Bureau County, Illinois, where he has been successful as a farmer, and has held
several oﬂices of public trust. He partakes to some extent of the poetic faculty of the older
brother, and published, in 1855, a volume of Poems.

154 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

MCDONALD CLARKE, 1798-1842, had some temporary notoriety in New York as “The Mad
Poet.” He published Review of the Eve of Eternity and Other Poems; The Gossip, or a
Laugh with the Ladies, a Grin with the Gentlemen; Afara, or the Belles of Broadway; A
Cross and a Coronet; The Elixir of Moonshine, a Collection of Prose and Poetry, by the Mad

William ‘D. Gallagher.

 

WILLIAM D. GALLAGHER, 1808 , occupied, thirty years ago, a. con-
spicuous position in Western literature. He published three volumes of
juvenile poems, under the name of Erato, and another volume consisting of
pieces written in more mature life. He engaged actively also in general
literature.

Mr. Gallagher is a native of Philadelphia, though he emigrated at an early age to Cincin-
nati, and is to be considered a Western man. He learned the tradeof a printer, and he has
been occupied most of his time in the life of a journalist, chieﬂy in Cincinnati. Besides the
volume already named, he edited, in 1841, avolume of Selections from the Poetical Literature
of the West.

“The poems of Mr. Gallagher are numerous, various, and of very unequal merit. Some
are exquisitely modulated, and in every respect ﬁnished with excellent judgment, while
others are inharmonious, inelegant, and betray unmistakable signs of carelessness. His
most unstudied performances, however, are apt to be forcible and picturesque, fragrant with
the freshness of Western woods and ﬁelds, and instinct with the aspiring and determined
life of the race of Western men. The poet of a new country is naturally of the poetry of
progress; his noblest theme is man, and his highest law, liberty.”— Griswold.

Mr. Gallagher, during a period of twenty years, from 1830 to 1850, did more perhaps than
any one man towards the creation of a Western literature, and although the several literary
enterprises in which he was engaged from time to time, as The Cincinnati Mirror, The
Western Literary Journal, and The Hesperian, were all short-lived, and unsuccessful
pecuniarily, they helped to create a taste for literature which has not died out, and which
has borne ample fruit since.

In 1850, Mr.- Gallagher went to Washington to take office in the Treasury Department.
On returning to the West, after an absence of three years, he did not renew his literary
career, but went to farming, near Louisville, Kentucky.

J OHN FINLEY, 1797 ———, was born at Brownsburg, Rockbridge County, Virginia. He went
to a country school, and learned “to read, write, and cipher as far as the rule of three.”
He went West, and settled, ﬁrst in Ohio, and ﬁnally in Richmond, Indiana. There he be-
came a prominent citizen, and ﬁlled many public oiﬁces. He published many short poems
which had a wide circulation.

REV. CHRISTOPHER P. CRANCH, 1813 --—, a native of Alexandria, Virginia, and a son of
Judge Cranch, is a poet and a painter. He visited Italy in 1848, and after that resided for
some time in Paris. He has published a volume of poems; also, The Last of the Hugger-
muggers, and Koboltozo.

CHARLES G. EASTMAN, 1816 —, is a native of Maine. He edited the Vermont Patriot,
and published in 1848 a volume of Poems, descriptive of rural life in New England.

REV. JOHN W. BROWN, 1814-1849, was an Episcopal minister. He wrote Christmas Bells,
a Tale of Holy Tide, and -other Poems. ~

HENRY B. Hmsr, 1813 , is a native of Philadelphia, and a lawyer by profession.‘ He
has given considerable attention to literary pursuits, and has published three volumes of
poems: The Coming of the Mammoth; Endymion, a Tale of Greece; and the Penance of
Roland.

Hosmer.

WILLIAM HENRY CUYLER HOSMER, 1814 -——-, has published two
volumes of poetry, relating chieﬂy to the legends of the North American
Indians.

Mr. Hosmer is a native of Avon, New York, and a graduate of Hobart College, Geneva.
He engaged in the practice of law at Avon, and afterwards went to New York, where he
held a position in the Custom-House. In early life he spent much time among the Indians,
and most of his writings are on subjects connected with Indian traditions. The following
are some of his publications: The Hall of Tecumseh; Yonnondio, or the Warriors of the
Genesee; Legends of the Senecas; Indian Traditions and Songs; The Pioneer of Western
New York, etc.

Some of his simpler and less ambitious poems, echoing the notes of the birds, or painting
the varying phenomena of the months, have greater attractions to the ordinary reader than
the poems relating to Indian life. Two stanzas are quoted from October:

OCTOBER.

Black walnuts, in low meadow ground,
Are dropping now their dark green balls,

And on the ridge, with rattling sound,
The deep brown chestnut falls.

When comesia day of sunshine mild,

From childhood, nutting in the wild,
Outbursts a shout of glee;

And high the pointed shells are piled
Under the hickory tree.

In piles around the cider-mill
The parti-coloured apples shine,
And busy hands the hopper ﬁll,
While foams the pumice ﬁne-
The cheese, with yellow straw between
Full juicy layers, may be seen,
And rills of amber hue _
Feed a vast tub, made tight and clean,
While turns the groaning screw.

his minor poems, Rain on the Roof, has been very popular, and well deserves the favor it
has received.

RAIN ON THE ROOF.

When the humid shadows hover
Over all the starry spheres,
And the melancholy darkness
Gently weeps in rainy tears,
What a joy to press the pillow
Of a cottage-chamber bed,
And to listen to the patter
Of the soft rain overhead!

Every tinkle on the shingles
Ilas an echo in the heart;
And a thousand dreamy fancies
Into busy being start,
And a thousand recollections
VVeave their bright hues into woof,
As I listen to the patter
Of the rain upon the roof.

Now in fancy comes my mother,
As she used to, years agone,

To survey her darling dreamers,
Ere she left them till the dawn

Oh! I see her bending o’er me,
As I list to this refrain

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 157

Which is played upon the shingles
By the patter of the rain.

Then my little seraph sister,
VVith her wings and waving hair,
And her bright-eyed cherub brother-—
A serene, angelic pair!-
Glide around my wakeful pillow,
With their praise or mild reproof,
As I listen to the murmur
Of. the soft rain on the roof.

And another comes to thrill me
With her eye’s delicious blue;

And forget I, gazing on her,
That her heart was all untrue:

, I remember but to love her
VVith a rapture kin to pain,

And my heart’s quick pulses vibrate
To the patter of the rain.

There is naught in Art’s bravuras,
That can work with such a spell
In the spirit’s pure, deep fountains,
Whence the holy passions well,
As that melody of'Nature,
That subdued, subduing strain
Which is played upon the shingles
By the patter of the rain.

THOMAS H. STOCKTON, D.D., 1808-1868, a very eloquent Methodist preacher, was born in
Mount Holly, New Jersey. He was at different times Chaplain to the United States Senate,
and to the House of Representatives, and had several important pastoral charges, chieﬂy in
Baltimore and Philadelphia. Dr. Stockton published A Volume of Sermons; 2 vols. of
Poems, one of them containing the ballad, Stand up for Jesus, in commemoration of Dudley
A. Tyng; and Bible Tracts.

THOMAS WARD, M.D., 1807 -—, was born in Newark, New Jersey, and educated at Prince-
ton. He studied medicine at the Rutgers Medical School of New York, and afterwards in
Europe. After practising for two or three years, having ample private means, he retired
from the profession, occupying thenceforward some portion of his leisure hours in literary
pursuits. He published in 1842 a volume of poems, entitled Passaic, a Group of Poems
Touching that River, with Other Musings. He wrote under the name of Flaccus.

JAMES W. WARD, 1818 —, is a native of Newark, New Jersey, the son of a bookseller of
that city. He was educated in the Boston High-School, and going to Cincinnati, became a
favorite pupil in chemistry of Professor Locke. Mr. VVard was one of the band of young
men who thirty years ago gave so much of a literary character to Cincinnati. He wrote for
The Mirror and The Hesperian, in 1838 published at Cleveland Yorick and Other Poems, the
first volume of poems published in Northern Ohio. Among his poetical effusions was a
very successful and amusing parody on Hiawatha, called Higher Water, describing a ﬂood
in the Ohio.

Mrs. Osgood.

MRS. FRANCES SARGENT'OSGOOD, 1812-1850, holds deservedly a high
place among the poetesses of America. She wrote no one great poem, but
she Was for nearly twenty years an industrious contributor to current liter-
ature, her productions steadily improving. to the last. Her collected poems,

. all short, ﬁll a large octavo, and are a valuable addition to the literature

of the period in which they were produced.

Mrs. Osgood was a native of Boston, the daughter of Mr. Joseph Locke, a merchant of that
city. Her early life was passed chieﬂy in the village of Hingham. She gave very early
indications of poetical talent. Her abilities in this respect were ﬁrst recognized by Mrs.
Lydia M. Child, who was then editing the Juvenile Miscellany. Miss Locke became a regular
contributor to this work, and subsequently to other works, under the name of “ Florence.”
She was married in 1834 to Mr. Osgood the painter, and accompanied him soon after to
London. They remained in the great metropolis for four years, Mr. Osgood acquiring repu-
tation as an artist, and Mrs. Osgood as a writer. After their return to the United States, they
resided chieﬂy in New York, although Mr. Osgood was occasionally absent on professional
tours to diiferent parts of the country.

In 1841, Mrs. Osgood edited an Annual, “The Flowers of Poetry, and the Poetry of Flowers,”
and in 1847, “ The Floral Offering.” She published a collection of her poems in 1846, and in
1850 a complete collection of her poetical works in one large octavo volume. This Work,
which was issued in sumptuous style, contained, of her poems up to that date, all that
she thought worthy of preservation.

Her prose contributions to the magazines were numerous, and would make, if collected,
one or two volumes. Though prose in name, they are all essentially poetical, far more so
than much that goes under the name of poetry. Her whole ‘life, indeed, as it has been well
remarked, was a continual poem. “ N ot to write poetry — not to think it— act it— dream
it—- and be it,—Was entirely out of her power.”

“ Of none of our writers has the excellence been more steadily progressive. Every month
her powers have seemed to expand and her sympathies to deepen. With an ear delicately
susceptible to the harmony of language, and a light and pleasing fancy, she always wrote
musically and often with elegance; but her later poems are marked by a freedom of style, a
tenderness of feeling, and a wisdom of apprehension, and are informed with a grace so unde-
ﬁnable but so pervading and attractive, that the consideration to which she is entitled is
altogether different in kind, as well as in degree, from that which was awarded to the playful,
piquant, and capricious improvisatrice of former years.” — Griswold.

TO MY PEN.

Dost know, my little vagrant pen,
That Wanderest lightly down the paper,
Without a thought how critic men
May carp at every careless caper?

Dost know, twice twenty thousand eyes,
If publishers report thee truly,

Each month may mark the sportive lies
That track, oh shame! thy steps unruly?

Now list to me, my fairy pen,
And con the lessons gravely over;
Be never wild or false again,
But “mind your_Ps and Qs,” you rover!

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 159

While tripping gayly to and fro,

Let not a thought escape you lightly,
But challenge all before they go ,

And see them fairly robed and rightly.

You know that Words but dress the frame,
And thought ’s the soul of verse, my fairy:

So drape not spirits dull and tame
In gorgeous robes or garments airy.

I would not have my pen pursue
The “ beaten track” —a slave forever;
No! roam as thou Wert wont to do
In author-land, by rock and river.

Be like the sunbeam’s burning wing,

' "Be like the wand in Cinderella-

And if you touch a common thing,
Ah, change to gold the pumpkin yellow!

May grace come ﬂuttering round your steps,
Whene’er, my birds, you light on paper,

And music murmur at your lips,
And truth restrain each truant caper.

Let hope paint pictures in your way,
And love his seraph-lesson teach you;
And rather calm with reason stay,
Than dance with fo1ly——I beseech you!

In faith’s pure fountain lave your wing,
And quaff from feeling’s glowing chalice;
But touch not falsehood’s fatal spring,
And shun the poisoned weeds of malice.

Firm be the Web you lightly spin,

From leaf to leaf, though frail in seeming,
While Fancy’s fairy dew-gems win

The sunbeam Truth to keep them gleaming.

And shrink not thou when tyrant wrong
O’er humble suffering dares deride thee:
With lightning step and clarion song,
Go! take the ﬁeld, with heavenbeside thee.

Be tuned to tenderest music when

Of sin and shame thou ’rt sadly singing;
But diamond be thy point, my pen,

When fol1y’s bells are round thee ringing!

And so, where’er you stay your ﬂight,

To plume your wing or dance your measure,
May gems and ﬂowers your pathway light,

For those who track your tread, my treasure!

But what is this? you ’ve tripped about,
While I the mentor grave was playing;
And here you’ve Written boldly out
The very words that I was saying!

And here, as usual, on you ’ve ﬂown

Hannah F. Gould.

HANNAH F. GOULD, 1789-1865, wrote many charming pieces in verse,
which were general favorites with the public, and some of which will prob-
ably hold a permanent place in literature. She excelled in the quiet themes
of home life, such as The Snow-Flake, and The Frost.

Miss Gould was a native of Lancaster, Vermont, but removed early to Newburyport, Mas-
sachusetts, and continued to reside there until her death. Her mother dying when Hannah
was young, the latter led a quiet, secluded life, devoting herself mainly to the care of her
father, to whom she was housekeeper, nurse, companion, and chief source of earthly hap-
piness.

Miss Gould began her literary career by contributing fugitive pieces to the periodicals,
and had in this wa.y already achieved considerable celebrity as early as 1830. A volume of
her Poems appeared in 1832, another in 1836, and a third‘ in 1841. A collection of prose
pieces, called Gathered Leaves, was published in 1846; Diosma, or Poems selected and
original, in 1850; and in the same year, The Youth’s Coronal, a book of poems for children.

THE SNOW~FLAKE.

“Now, if I fall, will. it be my lot
To be cast in some lone and lowly spot,
To melt, and to sink unseen, or forgot?

And there will my course be ended?”
’T was thus a feathery Snow-ﬂake said,
As down through measureless space it strayed,
Or as, half by dalliance, half afraid,

It seemed in mid air suspended.

“Oh, no!” said the Earth, “thou shalt not lie

Neglected and lone on my lap to die,

Thou pure and delicate child of the sky!
For thou wilt be safe in my keeping.

But then, I must give thee a lovelier form-—

Thou wilt not be a part of the wintry storm,

But revive, when the sunbeams are yellow and Warm,
And the ﬂowers from my bosom are peeping!

“And then thou shalt have thy choice, to be

Restored in the lily that decks the lea,

In the jessamine bloom, the anemone,
Or aught of thy spotless whiteness;

To melt, and be cast in a glittering bead

With the pearls that the night scatters over the mead,

In the cup where the bee and the ﬁre-ﬂy feed,
Regaining thy dazzling brightness.

FROM 1880 TO 1850. 161

“Or wouldst thou return to a home in the skies,
To shine in the Iris I’ll let thee arise,
And appear in the many and glorious dyes
A pencil of sunbeams is blending!
But true, fair thing, as my name is Earth,
I’ll give thee a new and vernal birth,
When thou shalt recover thy primal worth,’
And never regret descending!”

“Then 1 will drop,” said the trusting Flake;
“But, bear it in mind, that the choice I make
Is not in the ﬂowers nor the dew to wake;

Nor the mists, that shall pass with the morning.
For, things of thyself, they will die with thee;
But those that are lent from on high, like me,
Must rise, and will live, from thy dust set free,

To the regions above returning.

“And if true to thy Word and just thou art,

Like the spirit that dwells in the holiest heart,

Unsullied by thee, thou wilt let me depart,
And return to my native heaven;

For I would be placed on the beautiful bow,

From time to time in thy sight to glow;

So thou mayest remember the Flake of Snow,
By the promise that God hath given.”

Elizabeth Bogart.

ELIZABETH BOGART, -——— , wrote much for the literary magazines
of the last generation, and was a general favorite with the public. Her
pieces appeared under the name of Estelle.

Miss Bogart was a native and for the most of her life a resident of New York. She was
of Huguenot descent, the daughter of the Rev. David S. Bogart. She was at one time well
known to the reading public by her poetical contributions to the New York Mirror, and some
of her pieces were much quoted. But it is now many years since she has written for the
public, and her poems have never appeared in a collected form, so that in the crowd of

younger competitors for distinction she is pretty much forgotten. But she wrote some things ‘

well worthy of living, and she was a great favorite with a former generation. Her ﬁrst pieces
appeared in 1825. Among them may be named I Knew Men Kept no Promises, He Came
too Late, Give Me back My Letters, An Autumn View from My Window.

GIVE ME BACK MY LETTERS.

Give back thy letters?——take them—there,
I’ve done with them, and thee!

They ’re hollow as the empty air,
And worthless, now, to me.

I prized them only when I deemed
Thy heart was in each line;

I worshipped truth, and never dreamed
I bowed at falsehood’s shrine.

ANNA DRINKER, ——-— ———«, better known by her assumed name of
“Edith May,” contributed, about twenty-five years ago, a number of poems
of extraordinary merit to Sartain’s Magazine and other periodicals.

Miss Drinker is a native of Philadelphia, though she has resided chieﬂy at Montrose, Pa.
Her poetical contributions to Willis’s Home Journal and to Sartain’s Magazine, about 1848-
50, attracted much attention by their beauty and ﬁnish, and a handsome edition of her
Poetical Works, in 4to, was published in 1851. She published afterwards Tales and Poems
for Children.

AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Like roses scattered on the wind,
The poisoned draught to hide,
So did each written page of thine

Conceal deception’s tide.

Then take thy letters back again,
And read them if thou wilt,

And let them shame the treacherous pen,
Which love’s false fabric built.

Take back the memory of the past!
I have abolished all-

’T is sealed within thy packet, fast,
That thou may’st it recall.

I cast it from me, and am free,
For now, I know thee not!

Unmasked, I ﬁnd thou art not he
Whom I had ne’er forgot.

The semblance only thou dost wear,
The intellectual face,

From Nature stolen, or elsewhere
It must haveifound its place.

And thou dost ask thy letters, now,
The missives of thy art!

A scornful smile is on my brow,
And lightness in my heart.

Take back—take back thy written words!
They have no power for me!

Truth only has the strength that girds
A lasting memory.

TI-IEODORA.

Since we knew her for an angel,
Bearing meek the common load,
Let us call her Theodora,
Gift of God!

mom 1830 TO 1850. 163

Still so young, that every summer
Is a rose upon her brow,

All her days are blooms detaching
From a bough.

She is very slight, and graceful
As the bending of a fern;

As the marble ﬁgure drooping
I O’er an urn.

In her eyes are tranquil shadows
Lofty thoughts alone can make,
Like the darkness thrown by mountains
O’er a lake.

If you speak, the slow returning
Of her spirit from afar
To their depths, is like the advent
Of a star.

No one marvels at her beauty;
Blended with a perfect Whole,
Beauty seems the just expression

Of her soul.

For her lightest word, or fancy,
Unarrayed for human ear,
Might be echoed by an angel
Watching near.

Be a theme however homely,
It is glorious at her will,
Like a common air transﬁgured
By a master’s skill.

‘ And her words, severely simple,

As a drapery Grecian-wrought,
Show the clear, symmetric outline
Of her thought.

To disguise her limbs with grandeur
Would seem strange as to dispose
Gold and velvet round a statue’s
Pale repose.

But a robe of simplest texture
Should be gathered to her throat,

And her rippled locks, part braided,
' Part aﬂoat,

While a pendent spray of lilies
In their folds should be arrayed,
Or a Waxen white camelia
Lamp their shade.

UN REST.

Rest for a while! I’m tempest-tossed to-day.

Bar out the sunshine. Let importunate life,
Beating forever with impatient hand

My soul’s closed portals, only rouse within

Dim, dreary echoes. In a forest calm

Builds Sleep, the white dove. As a bird she rides
The lulled waves of the soul. To-day my thoughts
Hunt me like hounds; the very prayer for peace
Scares peace away; my senses, wide awake,

Watch for the touch that thrills them; every sound
Falls through the listening air unscabbarded;

And if sleep comes, ’t is but a transient dream
That ﬂits betwixt me and the light of life,
Alighting never.

Oh, sweet chrism of God!

Baptismal font from whence our bodies rise
Regenerate, cool wayside shadow ﬂung

Over the paths of toil, I am athirst;

Strengthen me with thy strength!

Lo! where she stands,

Sleep, the beloved, and mocks me with her beauty!
Her hands lie clasped around a lamp alight,
Burning faint incense; from her zone unbound
Dark robes trail silently; the poppies wreathed
Above her temples, bursting, over-ripe,

Drop with her motion. She is fair and calm,

But dreams, like cherubs, with bright restless wings,
Cling to her sweeping robes. Let her draw near,
Laying her dewy lips upon my brow,

Twining me with soft movement in her arms,

And then shall pass a ﬂuttering through my sense,
Leaf-like vibration, and my soul, as one

VVho drifts out seaward. seeing the dim shore
Receding slow, hearing the voice of Waves

Call to him fainter, shall ﬂoat guideless on

Rocked into slumber; dream effacing dream,
Thought Widening around thought, till all grows vague.

Mas. CATHERINE H. (WATERMAN) ESLING, 1812 ——, is a native and resident of Philadel-
phia. She published in 1850 The Broken Bracelet and Other Poems. “Her poems are the
expressions of a true woman’s soul ; she excels in portraying feeling, and in expressing the
warm and tender emotions of one to whom home has ever been the loadstone of the soul.”-

Amelia Welby.

MRS. AMELIA WELBY, 1821-1852, of Louisville, Kentucky, was for
many years “the bright, particular star” in the western horizon.

Mrs. VVelby, whose maiden name was Coppuck, was born at St. Michael’s, Maryland.
Her father removed in 1835 to Louisville, Kentucky, where in 1838 she was married to Mr.
Welby, a merchant of that city. She began at an early age to write for the Louisville
Journal under the signature of “Amelia,” and acquired considerable reputation as a poet.
Edgar A. Poe praised her in very high terms. “ She has nearly all‘ the imagination of Maria
del Occidente [Maria Brooks], with a more reﬁned taste; and nearly all the passion of Mrs.
Norton, with a nicer ear and (what is surprising) equal art. Very few American poets are
at all comparable with her in the true poetic qualities. As for our poetesses (an absurd but
necessary word) few of them approach her.” —-Poe. A volume of Mrs. Welby’s poems was
published in Boston, in 1844, of which four editions were published. An enlarged and illus-
trated edition appeared in New York in 1850.

Mrs. Nichols.

Mas. REBECCA S. NICHOLS was one of the writers who gave lustre to

under the name of Kate Cleveland. In 1851, an elegant volume of her later poems was pub-
lished, Songs of the Heart and of the Hearth-Stone.

Mrs. Gage.

Mas. FRANCES DANA GAGE, 1808 —, who is chieﬂy known as a
public lecturer, has written some very clever poetry.

Mrs. Gage was born at Marietta, Ohio, daughter of one of the original settlers of that place,
Mr. Joseph Barker. She was married at the age of twenty to Mr. James L. Gage, of McCon-
elsville, where she resided twenty-five years. In 1853 the family removed to St. Louis. In

M1°s._Shindler° (late Mrs. Dana).

MRS. MARY S. B. SHINDLER, 1810 , better known to the reading
public as Mrs. Dana, is the author of numerous works, both prose and verse,
chieﬂy the latter. The poems by which she ﬁrst gained celebrity appeared
in 1840, in a volume called The Southern Harp. '

Mrs. Shindler was born in Beaufort, South Carolina. Her maiden name was Mary Stanley
Bunce Palmer. She was the daughter of the Rev. Benjamin M. Palmer, D.D., who at the
time of her birth was pastor of the Independent or Congregational church at Beaufort. In
1814, the family removed to Charleston, Dr. Palmer having been called to a church in that
city. Mrs. Shindler was educated chieﬂy by the Misses Ramsay of Charleston, daughters of
the historian. In 1835, she became the wife of Mr. Charles E. Dana. The ﬁrst years of
their married life were passed in New York city. In 1838, they went out West, and settled
in Bloomington, Iowa. But a fever then prevailing in that region cut off in the same week
Mr. Dana and their only child. Mrs. Dana also was near to. death, but recovering made
her way back by slow and painful journeys to her parents and her old home in Carolina.

The anguish of these domestic sorrows found voice in song, and thus originated her ﬁrst
and best volume, The Southern Harp. This was followed by The Northern Harp, The
Parted Family and other Poems. She published also several other works: Charles Morton,
or The Young Patriot; The Young Sailor ;V and Forecastle Tom.

Mrs. Dana was bred a Calvinist. In 1844, she began to entertain doubts on the doctrine
of the Trinity, and ﬁnally went over to the Unitarians. In 1845, she published a volume,
Letters to Relatives and Friends, stating the process through which her mind had passed.

In 1848, she was married to Rev. Robert D. Shindler, a clergyman of the Episcopal
Church; and her views on the Trinity having again changed, she was received into the
communion of the Episcopal Church. Mr. Shindler was for a time Professor in Shelby
College, Kentucky. ,'.l.‘hey are now living in Texas.

7 PASSING UNDER THE ROD.

I saw the young bride, in her beauty and pride,
Bedeck’d in her snowy array;

And the bright ﬂush of joy mantled high on her cheek,
And the future looked blooming and gay:

And with woman’s devotion she laid her fond heart
At the shrine of idolatrous love,

And she anchor’d her hopes to this perishing earth,
By the chain which her tenderness wove.

But I saw when those heart-strings were bleeding and torn,
And the chain had been sever’d in two,

She had changed her white robes‘ for the Sables of grief,
And her bloom for the paleness of woe.

But the Healer was there, pouring balm on her heart,
And wiping the tears from her eyes, '

And he strengthen’d the chain he had broken in twain
And fasten’d it ﬁrm to the skies!

There had whispered a voice——’t was the voice of her God,
“I love,thee—I love thee —-pass under the rod! ”

I saw the young mother in tenderness bend
O’er the couch of her slumbering boy,

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 167

And she kissed the soft lips as they murmur’d her name,
While the dreamer lay smiling in joy.
Oh, sweet as a rose-bud encircled with dew,
When its fragrance is ﬂung on the air,
So fresh and so bright to that mother he seemed,
As he lay in his innocence there.
But I saw when she gazed on the same lovely form,
Pale as marble, and silent, and cold,
But paler and colder her beautiful boy,
And the tale of her sorrow was told!
But the Healer was there who had stricken her heart
And taken her treasure away,
To allure her to heaven he has placed it on high,
And the mourner will sweetly obey.
There had whispered a voice— ’t was the voice of her God,
“I love thee—I love thee ——pass under the rod! ”

I saw the fond brother, with glances of love,
Gazing down on a gentle young girl,
And she hung on his arm, and breathed soft in his ear
As he played with each graceful curl.
Oh, he loved the sweet tones of her silvery voice,
Let her use it in sadness or glee; ’
And he ’d clasp his brave arms round her "delicate form,
As she sat on her brother’s knee.
But I saw when he gazed on her death-stricken face,
And she breathed not aword in his ear;
And he clasped his brave arms round an icy cold form,
And he moisten’d her cheek with a tear.
But the Healer was there, and he said to him thus-
“Grieve not for thy sister’s short life,”
And he gave to his arms still another fair girl,
And he made her his own cherished wife!
There had whisper’d a voice—’t was the voice of his God,
“I love thee—I love thee —pass under the rod!”

I saw where a father and mother had leaned
On the arms of a dear gifted son,

And the star in the future grew bright to their gaze,
As they saw the proud place he had won:

And the fast-coming evening of life promised fair,
And its pathway grew smooth to their feet,

And the starlight of love glimmered bright at the end,
And the whispers of fancy were sweet.

But I saw when they stood, bending low o’er the grave,
Where their heart’s dearest hope had been laid,

And the star had gone down in the darkness of night,
And the joy from their bosoms had ﬂed.

But the Healer was there, and his arms were around,
And he led them with tenderest care;

And he showed them a star in a bright upper world,
’T was their star shining brilliantly there!

They had each heard a voice—’t was the voice of their God,

“I love thee——I love thee-—pass under the rod! ”

II. WRITERS OF NOVELS‘, TALES, ETC.
Coopen

JAMES FENIMORE CooPER, 17 89-1851, wa.s the ﬁrst American novelist
that gained a national reputation. He was also the ﬁrst American writer
that obtained general recognition in Europe, and until lately was the most
widely known abroad of all Americans, excepting only Washington and
Franklin. His tales of pioneer life threw a glamour over the American
landscape, not unlike, and hardly inferior, to that which Scott had thrown
over Scotland. His sea tales are still unequalled in their kind, on either
side of the Atlantic.

Cooper was born at Burlington, New Jersey, his ancestors having been among the early
settlers of West Jersey. Cooper’s father, however, bought extensive tracts of land in the
interior of New York, where he founded Cooperstown, on Otsego lake, and with that place
chieﬂy the author is connected. He entered Yale College in 1802, at the age of thirteen,
and after remaining three years left college without graduating, and entered the navy. He
continued in the naval service for six years, and by his experience there acquired that
familiarity with sea-life which was of so much value to him in a portion of his romances.
At the end of the six years, he resigned from the navy, and married Miss De Lancey, a sister
of Bishop De Lancey.

. Cooper’s ﬁrst venture in authorship was a novel, called Precaution, and its success was
very moderate. His second work, The Spy, contained nearly all his strong characteristics,
and was immediately successful. From that time onward, he continued to the end of life

‘ to pour forth novel after novel, with amazing fertility of invention.

Cooper’s strong point as a novelist is his power of description. His scenes stand before
the eye with the most perfect and absolute distinctness. Another feature, equally marked,
is his nationality—not so much the nationality of feeling, which often leads its posses-
sor into saying what is absurd, but that which led him to write about the scenes and
things that he was familiar with and had seen in his own land. American scenery, manners,
customs, and ideas, ﬁrst stood forth in distinct relief in the pages of Cooper. He was
equally happy in depicting sea-life, which never had a truer or more vivid painter than in
the author of The Pilot.

Cooper’s novels number no less than thirty. They are divisible mainly into two classes, one
consisting of sea-stories, of which The Pilot and The Red Rover are the most notable exam-
ples, and the other called his Leather—Stocking tales, descriptive of pioneer life, and named
from the hunter-hero, Leather-Stocking, who appears in several of them. Besides these, he
wrote several novels on European subjects, and several also of a political character. The
best example of the latter is The Bravo, the scene of which is laid in the Gulf of Venice;
the object of the story is to vindicate popular institutions iii the eyes of Europe. Three
others, Satanstoe,Chainbea1‘er, and Red Skins, were in like manner meant to rouse the
American people to the injustice and wickedness of the anti—rent agitation in the State
of New York. ~

The following is believed to be a complete list of his novels: Precaution, The Spy, The
Pioneer, The Last of the Mohicans, The Prairie, The Pathﬁnder, The Deer—Slayer, The Pilot,
The Red Rover, The Bravo, The Water-Witch, The Two Admirals, The Wept of Wish-ton—Wish,
Homeward Bound, Home as Found, Headsman of Berne, Heidenmauer, Mercedes of Castile,
The Monikins, Wing and Wing, Wyandotte, Ned Myers, Ashore and Aﬂoat, Miles Walling-
ford, Islets of the Gulf, VVays of the Hour, Autobiography of a Pocket Handkerchief, Satans—

toe, The Chainbearer, The Red Skins. The ten‘ ﬁrst named are the ones most known, and
except Precaution are by far the best.

After publishing some of his _most celebrated novels, Mr. Cooper went abroad, where he
was most kindly received. He spent several years in Europe, chieﬂy in France, and while
there continued his work as a novelist.

Besides his ‘works of fiction, Mr. Cooper wrote A History of the Navy of the United
States, 2 vols., and Lives of American Naval Oiﬁcers, 2 vols. He wrote also a series of
sketches of travel, including works on England, France, Switzerland, and Italy, and ﬁlling
10 vols. The complete edition of his works occupies 34 vols.

Mr. Cooper appears to have had a not very amiable temper, and all the latter part of his
life he was in hot water, quarrelling ﬁrst with one set of people, and then with another.
Ilis writings, too, are of very unequal merit. It would be diiﬁcult to name an author of
such very high merit, who has written so much that is absolutely worthless. Fully one-
half of what he wrote was a dead weight and a drag upon the other half. With all these
drawbacks, however, he was one of the greatest and most original writers of his day, and
he divided with Washington Irving the general recognition which was awarded them in
Europe.

THE PANTHER.

By this time they had gained the summit of the mountain, where they left the high-
way, and pursued their course under the shade of the stately trees that crowned the emi-
nence. The day was becoming warm, and the girls plunged more deeply into the forest, as
they found its invigorating coolness agreeably contrasted to the excessive heat they had
experienced in the ascent. The conversation, as if by mutual consent, was entirely changed
to the little incidents and scenes of their walk, and every tall pine, and every shrub and
ﬂower, called forth some simple expression of admiration. .

In this manner they proceeded along the margin of the precipice, catching occasional
glimpses of the placid Otsego, or pausing to listen to the rattling of wheels, and the sounds
of hammers, that rose from the valley to mingle the signs of men with the scenes of nature,
when Elizabeth suddenly started, and exclaimed —' ,

“Listen 1 there are the cries of a child on this mountain ! is there a clearing near us? or
can some little one have strayed from its parents? ”

“Such things frequently happen,” returned Louise. “ Let us follow the sounds: it may
be a wanderer starving on the hill.”

Urged by this consideration, the females pursued the low, mournful sounds, that proceeded
from the forest, with qr’ek and impatient steps. More than once, the ardent Elizabeth was
on the point of announcing that she saw the sufferer, when Louise caught her by the arm,
and pointing behind them, cried‘—-

“ Look at the dog I ”

Brave had been their companion, from the time his young mistress had lured him from
his kennel, to the present moment. His advanced age had long before deprived_him of his
activity; and when his companions stopped to view the scenery, or to add to their bouquets,
the mastiif would lay his huge frame on the ground, and await their movements with eyes
closed, and a listlessness in his air that ill accorded with the character of a protector. But
when, aroused by this cry from Louise, Miss Temple turned, she saw the dog, with his eyes
keenly set on some distant object, his head bent near the ground, and his hair actually
rising on his body, through fright or anger. It was most probably the latter, for he was
growling in a low key, and occasionally showing his teeth, in aimanner that would have
terriﬁed his mistress, had she not so well known his good qualities.

“ Brave! ” she said, “ be quiet, Brave! what do you see, fellow? ”

At the sound of her voice, the rage of the mastiff, instead of being at all diminished, was
very sensibly increased. Ile stalked in front of the ladies, and seated himself at the feet of
his mistress, growling louder than before, and occasionally giving vent to his ire, by a short,
surly barking.

“What does he see? ” said Elizabeth: “there must be some animal in sight.”

Hearing no answer from her companion, Miss Temple turned her ‘head, and beheld Louise,
standing with her face whitened to the color of death, and her ﬁnger pointing upwards, with
a sort of ﬂickering, convulsive motion. The quick eye of Elizabeth glanced in the direction
indicated by her friend, where she saw the ﬁerce front and glaring eyes of a female panther,
ﬁxed on them with horrid malignity, and threatening to leap. .

“ Let us ﬂy,” exclaimed Elizabeth, grasping the arm of Louise, whose form yielded like
melting snow. ‘

There was not a single feeling in the temperament of Elizabeth Temple that could prompt
her to desert a companion in such an extremity. She fell on her knees, by the side of the
inanimate Louise, tearing from the person of her friend, with instinctive readiness, such
parts of her dress as might obstruct her respiration, and encouraging their only safeguard,
the dog,.at the same time by the sounds of her voice.

“Courage, Brave!” she cried, her own tones beginning to tremble, “courage, courage,
good Brave I ”

A quarter-grown cub, that had hitherto been unseen, now appeared, dropping from the
branches of a sapling that grew under the shade of the beech which held its dam. This
ignorant, but vicious creature, approached the dog, imitating the actions and sounds of its
parent, but exhibiting a strange mixture of the playfulness of a kitten with the ferocity
of its race. Standing on its hind legs, it would rend the bark of a tree with its fore paws,
and play the antics of a cat; and then, by lashing itself with its tail, growling, and scratch-
ing the earth, it would attempt the manifestations of anger that rendered its parent so terriﬁc.

All this time Brave stood ﬁrm and undaunted, his ‘short tail erect, his body drawn back-
ward on its hannches, and his eyes following the movements of both dam and cub. At
every gambol played by the latter, it approached nigher to the dog, the growling of the
three becoming more horrid at each moment, until the younger beast, overleaping its
intended bound, fell directly before the mastiff. There was a moment of fearful cries and
struggles, but they ended almost as soon as commenced, by the cub appearing in the air,
hurled from the jaws of Brave, with a violence that sent it against a tree so forcibly as to
render it completely senseless.

Elizabeth witnessed the short struggle, and her blood was warmed with the triumph of
the dog, when she saw the form of the old panther in the air, springing twenty feet from the
branch of the beech to the back of the mastitf. No words of ours can describe the fury of
the conﬂict that followed. It was a confused struggle on the dry leaves, accompanied by
loud and terriﬁc cries. Miss Temple continued on her knees, bending over the form of
Louise, her eyes ﬁxed on the animals, with an interest so horrid, and yet so intense, that she
almost forgot her own stake in the result. So rapid and vigorous were the bounds of the
inhabitant of the forest, that its active frame seemed constantly in the air, while the dog
nobly faced his foe at each successive leap. When the panther lighted on the shoulders of
the mastiﬁ‘, which was its constant aim, old Brave, though torn with her talons, and
stained with his own blood, that already ﬂowed from a dozen wounds, would shake off his
furious foe like a feather, and rearing on his hind legs‘, rush to the fray again, with jaws
distended, and a dauntless eye. But age, and his pampered life, greatly disqualiﬁed the
noble mastiﬁ‘ for such a struggle. In everything but courage, he was only the vestige of
what he had once been. A higher bound than ever raised the wary and furious beast far
beyond the reach of the dog, who was making a desperate but fruitless dash at her, from
which she alighted in a favorable position, on the back of her aged fee. For a single moment
only could the panther remain there, the great strength of the dog returned with a convulsive
effort. But Elizabeth saw, as Brave fastened his teeth in the side of his enemy, that the
collar of brass around his neck, which had been glittering throughout the fray, was of the
color of blood, and directly that his frame was sinking to the earth, where it soon lay
prostrate and helpless. Several mighty efforts of the wild-cat to extricate herself from the
jaws of the dog followed, but they were fruitless until the mastiif turned on his back, his

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 17l

lips collapsed, and his teeth loosened, when the short convulsions and stillness that ensued,

announced the death of poor Brave.

Elizabeth now lay wholly at the mercy of the beast. There is said to be something in the
front of the image of the Maker that daunts the heart of the inferior beings of his creation;
and it would seem that some such power, in the present instance, suspended the threatened
blow. The eyes of the monster and the kneeling maiden met for an instant, when the
former stooped to examine her fallen foe; next to scent her luckless cub. From the latter
examination, it turned, however, with its eyes apparently emit-ting ﬂashes of ﬁre, its tail
lashing its sides furiously, and its claws projecting inches from her broad feet.

Miss Temple did not or could not move. Her hands were clasped in the attitude of prayer,
but her eyes were still drawn to her terrible enemy--her cheeks were blanched to the
whiteness of marble, and her lips were slightly separated with horror.

The moment seemed to have arrived for the fatal termination, and the beautiful ﬁgure of

Elizabeth was bowing meekly to the stroke, when a rustling of leaves behind seemed rather

to mock the organs than to meet her ears. .

“Hist! histl ” said a low voice, “ stoop lower, gal ; your bonnet hides the creater’s head.”

It was rather the yielding of nature than a compliance with this unexpected order, that
caused the head of our heroine to sink on her bosom; when she heard the report of the riﬂe,
the whizzing of the bullet, and the enraged cries of the beast, who was rolling over on the
earth biting its own ﬂesh, and tearing the twigs and branches within its reach. At the next
instant the form of the Leatlier-stocking rushed by her, and he called aloud —

“ Come in, Hector, come in, old fool; ’t is a hard—lived animal, and may jump ag’in.”

Natty fearlessly maintained his position in front of the females, notwithstanding the
violent bounds and threatening aspect of the wounded panther, which gave several indica-
tions of returning strength and ferocity, until his riﬂe was again loaded, when he stepped
up to the enraged animal, and placing the muzzle close to its head, every spark of life was
extinguished by the discharge.

indicating a reﬁned taste and talent of no common order. Her ﬁrst publication, Rural
Hours, has passed through several editions. It is a book descriptive of the scenery that

, daughter of the Novelist, has written several works

surrounds her own home, and is an admirable portraiture of American out—door life, just as
it is, with no coloring but that which every object necessarily receives in passing through
a cultivated and contemplative mind. Miss Cooper has also written Rhyme and Reason of
Country Life, and Country Rambles. She has an observant eye, and a happy faculty of mak-
ing her descriptions interesting by selecting the right objects, instead of the too common
method of extravagant embellishment. She never goes into ecstasies, and she sees nothing
which anybody else might not see who walked through the same ﬁelds after her.

Miss Sedgwiok.

CATHERINE M. SEDGWICK, 1789-1867, as a novelist, holds about tl1e
same rank among the writers of her own sex in the United States that
Cooper holds among the writers of the other sex. She was the ﬁrst of her
class Whose writings became generally known, and the eminence univer-
sally conceded to her on account of priority has been almost as generally
granted on other grounds. The novels by which she is best -known are
Hope Leslie, and Redwood. "

Miss Sedgwick was born the same year as (‘ooper. She was a native, and most of her life, a
resident of Stockbridge, Massachusetts. Her father was the Hon. Theodore Sedgwick, of

172 AME ireAN LITERATURE.

Stockbridge, who served his country with distinguished reputation in various stations, and
particularly in the Congress of the. United States as Speaker of the House of Representatives,
and afterwards as Senator, and who, at the time of his death, was one of the Judges of the
Supreme Court of his own State. Iler brothers, Henry and Theodore, have both been dis-
tinguished as lawyers and as political writers.

Judge Sedgwick died in 1813, before his daughter had given any public demonstration of
her abilities as a writer. Her talents seem to have been from the ﬁrst justly appreciated by
her brothers, whose judicious encouragement is very gracefully acknowledged in the preface
to the new edition of her works, commenced by Mr. Putnam, in 1849. A

Miss Sedg\vick’s ﬁrst publication was The New England Tale. The author informs 11s in
the preface, that the story was commenced as a religious tract, and that it gradually grew
in her hands beyond the proper limits of such a work. Finding this to be the case, she
abandoned all design of publication, but ﬁnished the tale for her own amusement. Once

»ﬁnished, however, the opinions and solicitationsof her friends prevailed over her own

earnest wishes, and the volume was given to the world in 18:23. The original intention of
this book led the author to give special prominence to topics of a questionable character for
a. professed novel, and the unfavorable portraiture which she gives, both here and elsewhere,
of New England Puritanism, has naturally brought upon her some censure. The limited
plan of the story did not give opportunity for the display of that extent and variety of power
which appear in some of her later productions. Still it contains passages of stirring elo-
quence, as well as of deep tenderness, that will compare favorably with anything she has
written. Perhaps the chief value of The New England Tale was its effect upon the author
herself. Its publication broke the ice of diﬂidence and indifference, and launched her, with
a strong wind, upon the broad sea of letters.

Redwood accordingly followed in 1821. It was received at once with a degree of favor
that causedthe anthor’s name to be associated, and on equal terms, with that of Cooper,
who was then at the height of his popularity; and, indeed, in a French translation of the
book, which then appeared, Cooper is given on the title-page as the author. Redwood was
also translated into the Italian, besides being reprinted in England.

The reputation of the author was conﬁrmed and extended by the appearance, in 1827, of
Hope Leslie, the most decided favorite of all her novels. She wrote other things afterwards
that in the opinion of some of the critics are superior to either Redwood or Hope Leslie.
But these later writings had to jostle their way among a crowd of competitors, both domestic
and foreign. Her earlier works stood alone, and Hope Leslie, especially, became ﬁrmly
associated in the public mind with the rising glories of a native literature. It was not only
read with lively satisfaction, but familiarly quoted and applauded as a source of national
pride.

Her subsequent novels followed at about uniform intervals: Clarence, a Tale of our Own
Times, in 11830; Le Bossu, one of the Tales of the Glau‘aer Spa, in 1832; The Linwoods, or
Sixty Years Since in America, in 18:35; and, lastly, after an interval of twenty-two years,
Married or Single, in 1857.

In 1836, she commenced writing in quite a new vein, giving a series of illustrations of
common life, called The Poor Rich Man, and The Rich Poor Man. These were followed, in
1837, by Live and Let Live, and afterwards by Means and Ends, a Love Token for Children,
and Stories for Young Persons. _

In 1839, Miss Sedgwicl: went to Europe, and while there wrote Letters from Abroad to
Kindred at Home. These were collected after her return, and published in two volumes-

She wrote also a Life of Lucretia M. Davidson, and contributed numerous articles to the
annuals and magazines. Most of her later publications were prepared expressly for children
and young persons. The titles of some of her small volumes are Facts and Fancies, Morals
of Manners, Wilton Harvey, Boy of Mount Rhigi, etc.

The quality ofmind which is most apparent in Miss Sedgwick’s writings is that of strength.
The reader feels at every step that he has to do with a vigorous and active intellect. Another

FROM 1830 TO .1850. 1737

quality, resulting from this possession of power, is the entire absence of aifectation of every
kind. There is no straining for effect, no mere verbal prettinesses. The discourse proceeds
with the utmost simplicity and directness, as though the author were more intent upon
what she is saying than how she says it. And yet, the mountain springs of her own Housa-
tonic do not send up a more limpid stream than is the apparently spontaneous ﬂow of her
pure English. .

As a novelist, Miss Sedgwick for the most part, and wisely, chose American subjects. The
local traditions, scenery, manners, and costume, being thus entirely familiar, she had
greater freedom in the exercise of the creative faculty, on which, after all, real eminence
in the art mainly depends. Her characters are conceived with distinctness, and are
minutely individual and consistent, while her plot always shows a mind fertile in resources
and a happy adaptation of means to ends. A V

An interesting volume was published in 1871, called Life a.nd Letters of Catherine M.
Sedgwick. It was edited by Mary E. Dewey. and was virtually an autobiography.

THEODORE SEDGWICK, 1781-1889, brother of Catherine Sedgwick, was a native of Stockbridge,
and a graduate of Yale, of the class of 1798. He practised law in Albany for almost twenty
years, and then removed to Stockbridge to spend the remainder of his days. He wrote
Public and Private Economy, 3 vols. ; Ilints to My Countrymen; and two Addresses to the
Berkshire Agricultural Association. ——MRS. THEODORE SEDGWICK, 1789 , wife of the pre-
ceding, was a granddaughter of Governor Livingston of New Jersey. She wrote The
Morals of Pleasure; The Young Emigrants; Allen Prescott; Alida, or Town and Country.

Miss Mclntosh.

MARIA J. MCINTOSH, 1808 , has written a large number of novels
and tales, all of a— domestic character, "and all excellent in tone and spirit.
Those which have shown greatest power, and met with the most general
acceptance, are Conquest and’ Self-Conquest, Charms and Counter-Charms,

* The Lofty and The Lowly, and Two Lives, or To Seem and To Be. Miss

McIntosh worthily takes up the line of succession after Miss Sedgwick.

Miss McIntosh was born at Sunbury, Liberty County, Georgia. Her grandfather was one
of a band of doughty Scotch Highlanders, who on the ﬁnal downfall of the Stuarts came
with Oglethorpe to America, and assisted in the settlement of his colony. Her father, Major
Lachlan Mclntosh, served with gallantry and distinction in the war for Independence. At
the close of the war, he returned to his original profession, that of the law. His house, a
stately old mansion, was noted for its generous hospitality.

On the death of her parents, Miss McIntosh, in 1835, came to New York, where she has
resided ever since. The whole of her ample fortune was invested in New York securities
just before the terrible crash of 1887. The lady awoke, one morning, to ﬁnd herself bankrupt
in a strange city. Thrown thus upon her own resources for support, Miss McIntosh resorted
to her pen, and has continued from time to time to give to the world the fruits of her labor.
Some of her publications are as late as 1863, but the period of her greatest activity and pro-
ductiveness was from 1840 to 1850.

Miss McIntosh’s ﬁrst work, Blind Alice, appeared in 1841. It was followed in quick suc-
cession by Jessie Graham, Florence Arnott, Grace and Clara, and Ellen Leslie. These are
generally known as Aunt Kitty’s Tales. They were intended mainly for juvenile readers.
They are simple stories of American life, told in easy and graceful language, without exag-
geration or false sentiment, and while attractive and pleasurable, have yet for their primary
object the aim to teach some useful lesson of life and morals.

In 1844, Miss McIntosh published Conquest and Self-Conquest, her ﬁrst regular novel.
This was followed in 1845 by Praise and Principle; in 1847, by Two Lives, or To Seem and
To Be; and in 1848, by her greateat work, Charms and Counter-Charms. The Letty and

15 *  

174 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

The Lowly appeared two years later. Besides these novels, she published Woman in
America, her Work and her Reward, a didactic work, discussing without any veil of iiction
the duties and responsibilities of women. She published also The Cousins, a tale for children,
and Evenings at Donaldson Manor,—a collection of short tales. Her later publications
have been Violet, or the Cross and the Crown; Meta Gray; and Two Pictures.

‘ Miss McIntosh makes no attempt at what is called descriptive writing, meaning by that,
the description of local scenery and manners, of which (ooper was such a consummate
master. She is a delineator of mental life, and of that only. The external, in man and
animals or nature, is never used, except so far as it is necessary to bring forward the mind, its
virtues, desires, and principles. She excludes from her attention everything not absolutely
necessary to the moral life. Her heroes and heroines may be in Paris or in Rome, but it is
in name only. There is no local coloring to make one place rather than another needful for
the story.

Miss McIntosh still further restricts herself in the characters of her story, taking those
only which belong to common, practical life. Furthermore, while her tales are not wanting in
interest and excitement, yet the moral is with her ever supreme. She has evidently felt it
to be her calling, not to minister to the pleasure merely of her readers, but to be a public
teacher of what is right and true in domestic life.

John P. Kennedy.

JOHN PENDLETON KENNEDY, 1795-1870, comes next after Cooper and
Miss Sedgwick in the list of American novelists. His three novels, Swallow
Barn, Horse-Shoe Robinson, and Rob of the Bow], besides their value as
Works of art, are all careful historical studies, giving us admirable pictures
of life in the Southern States in the earlier days of the republic.

Mr. Kennedy was a native of Baltimore, in which city he also completed his studies and
was admitted to the bar. He took a prominent part in politics, on the Whig side; was a
member of the Maryland House of Delegates and also of the United States House of Repre-
sentatives ; and in 1852 he was appointed, by Fillmore, Secretary of the N avy.

In 1818, in company with Peter Hoffman Cruse, Mr. Kennedy began the publication of
The Red Book, a miscellaneous fortnightly in prose and verse. In 1832 Swallow Barn
appeared, being a tale descriptive of life and manners in the Old Dominion. This was fol-
lowed, in 1835, by Horse-Shoe Robinson. This was a tale of soldier life during the American
Revolution, and was even more popular than its predecessor. In 1838 appeared Rob of the
Bowl. another historical novel based upon the troubles between Catholics and Protestants
in the early history of Maryland. In 850, Mr Kennedy published his Well—known life of
William Wirt, a valuable contribution to the history of the United States. Besides these
works, Mr. Kennedy has contributed to the periodical literature essays enough to ﬁll
several volumes.

An admirable Life of Kennedy has been written by his friend, Henry T. Tuckerman.

James K. Paulding.

JAMES KIRKE PAULDING, 1778-1860, was distinguished both as a poli-
tician and a man of letters. He held various political oﬂices, the highest
being that of Secretary of the Navy. He wrote numerous works, prose and
verse, humorous and serious. The best known are John Bull and Brother
Jonathan, The Three VVise Men of Gotham, and The Dutchman’ s Fireside.

Mr. Paulding was a native of Dutchess County, New York, and lived the greater part of

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 175

his life in New York city. By the marriage of his sister to William Irving, Paulding became
intimate with the Irving family; and his ﬁrst literary work was a copartnership with
Washington Irving in the composition of the Salmagundi Papers. A political pamphlet by
Mr. Paulding, entitled The United States and England, brought him to the notice of Presi-
dent Madison, and led to Madison’s making him, in 1814, Secretary of the Board of Navy
Commissioners. Mr. Paulding afterwards was for twelve years Navy Agent in New York
city, and in ,1839—el1, he was Secretary of the Navy, under Van Buren.

By far the greater part of what Mr. Paulding did, in the way of pen-work, was political
writing for the newspapers. But he never lost his early fondness for literary pursuits, and
his contributions to polite letters were considerable, for one who did not make literature a
profession.

His principal works are the following: The Lay of the Scottish Fiddle; The Diverting
History of John Bull and Brother Jonathan; John Bull in America; Sketch of Old England
by a New England man ; Three Wise Men of Gotham; Konigsmark; The Dutchman’s Fire-
side; The Backwoodsman; Letters from the South; Life of Washington; Westward Ho!
Slavery in the United States ; The Old Continental; The Painter and his Daughter. He also
wrote, in connection with his son, William J. Paulding, a volume of American Comedies.
The literary Life of Mr. Paulding, consisting in great measure of extracts from his various
writings, has been published by his son, already referred to.

One of the most amusing of Mr. Paulding’s works was The Lay of the Scottish Fiddle, “ aﬁ

Tale of Havre de Grace, supposed to be written by Walter Scott, Esq. First American,
from the fourth Edinburgh edition.” This good-natured parody on Scott’s Lay of the Last
Minstrel was intended to lash certain follies of the Americans, and also to expose some of
the excesses of the British in the Chesapeake. The poem was in ﬁve_cantos. It was pub-
lished in 1813, and has been several times reprinted. “The course of the story is this. A
blind ﬁddler, led by his dog, ﬁnds his way from New York to Princeton, where he brings up
at the tavern. Here he is induced to sing his Lay, and — (with the episode of a grand row
of students from Nassau Hall) works through it.”

RANDOLPH OF ROANOKE.

Among the descendants of Pocahontas, the most remarkable are John Randolph and
Bolling Robertson. The eyes of both are perfectly Indian——black, shining, and occasionally
ﬁerce. Indeed, I have never met with a man having a cross with the aboriginal, that did
not show it like a blood-horse. The mark seems indelible, both in body and mind.

In my visit to lVashington, four winters ago, it was my fortune to lodge in t-he same
hotel with Mr. Randolph, and to be favored with his acquaintance, I might almost say his
friendship, which, notwithstanding his alleged wayward disposition is, I am told, generally
steadfast and sincere." He is certainly the most extraordinary personage I have known,
and, on the whole, the greatest orator I have heard. There is wit in everything he says, and
eloquence at every end of his long ﬁngers. He is the last man in the world into whose
hands I should wish to fall in a debate, for he cuts with a two-edged sword, and makes War
like his Indian ancestors, sparing neither sex nor age. Yet his tenderness is irresistible,
and when he wishes to evince it, the tones of his voice and the expression of his eye go
equally to the heart.

His style of oratory in Congress is emphatically his own. He is indeed original and
unique in everything. His language is simple, though polished ; brief, though rich, and as
direct as the arrow from the Indian bow. He often tides away, apparently, from his sub-
ject, but, however he may seem to drift without rudder or compass, never fails to return
with a dash, illustrating it with ﬂashes of living light. Though eccentric in the ordinary
intercourse of life, there will be found more of what is called plain common-sense in his
speeches than in those of any other member of Congress. His illustrations are almost
always drawn from the most familiar sources, and no man is so happy in allusions to fables,
proverbs, and incidents of the day. He never declaims, or sacriﬁces strength, clearness, and

176 AMERICAN L1-"rnn./irons.

simplicity, to the more popular charms of redundant metaphor and full rounded periods. He
is abrupt, sententious, and laconic. Nothing, indeed, is more easy of comprehension than
the expressed ideas of the great orator of Virginia. Though exceedingly irritable in debate,
he is never loud or boisterous, but utters biting sarcasm in a manner the most provokingly
cool, and a voice that suggests the music of the spheres. Such is the admirable clearness
and perfection of his enunciation, that his lowest tones circulate like echoes through the
hall of Congress. In short, in all the requisites of a great orator he has no superior; and,
in the greatness of all, the power of attracting, charming, riveting the attentiden of an audi-
ence, no equal in this country.

Mr. Randolph has shared the fortunes of most political leaders, in having his conduct mis-
represented, his foibles -—which, Heaven knows, are suﬁiciently formidable —— exaggerated,
and his peculiarities caricatured, without remorse. The fault is, in a great measure, his
own. He spares no adversary, and has no right to expect quarter from others. In this
respect his fate may serve as a beacon, indicating the necessity of toleration in politics as
well as in religion. That he is capricious, and careless of wounding those for whom he has
no particular regard, no one will deny. That he is impatient in argument, and intolerant
of. opposition, is equally certain; and the whole world knows that he is little solicitous to
disguise his contempt or dislike.

But, whatever may be the defects of Mr. Ran dolph’s temper, no one can question his_lofty
independence of mind, or his unsullied integrity as a public agent or as a private gentleman.
In the former character he has never abandoned his principles to suit any political crisis,
and in the latter he may be emphatically called an honest man. His word and his bond are
equally to be relied on-—= and as his country can never accuse him of sacriﬁcing her interests
to his own ambition, so no man can justly charge him with the breach of any private obli-
gation. In both these respects he stands an illustrious example to a country in which
political talents are more common than political integrity, and where it is too much the
custom to forget the actions of a man in admiration of his speeches. _

We passed our evenings together for some weeks, or rather I may say the better part of
our nights, for he loved to sit up late, because, as he was wont to say, the grave, not the bed,
was his place of rest. On these occasions there was a_charm in his conversation I never
found in that of any other person. Old Virginia was the goddess of his idolatry, and of her
he delighted to talk. He loved her so dearly, that he sometimes almost forgot he was also
a citizen of the United States. The glories and triumphs of Patrick Henry’s eloquence, and
the ancient hospitality of the patricians on James River, were among the favorite topics, of
which he never tired, and with which he never tired me. In short, the impression on my
mind, never to be eradicated, is, that his heart was naturally liberal, open, and gracious,
and that his occasional ebullitions of splenetic impatience were the spontaneous, perhaps,
irrepressible efforts of a debilitated frame to relieve itself a moment from the impression
of its own ceaseless worrying.

Mr. Randolph is, beyond comparison, the most striking person I have ever met. He is
made up of contradictions. Though his person is exceedingly tall, thin, and ill-proportioned,
he is the most graceful man in the world when he pleases; and with an almost feminine
voice, his whispers are heard across a room. When seated on the opposite side of the hall
of Congress, he looks like a boy of ﬁfteen; b11t when he rises to speak, he seems to stretch
and expand his ﬁgure almost into sublimity, from the contrast between his height when
sitting a11d standing. In the former, his shoulders are raised, his head sunk, his body col-
lapsed; in the latter he is seen, his ﬁgure dilated, in the attitude of inspiration, his head
raised, his long white ﬁnger pointing, and his dark Indian eye ﬂashing, at the object of his
overwhelming sarcasm.

Such is John Randolph, the descendant of Pocahontas, as he appeared to me. He may be
self-willed, and erratic. Ilis op_ponents sometimes insinuate that he is crazy, because he
sees what they cannot see, and speaks in the spirit of inspiration of things to come. He
looks into the clear mirror of futurity with an eye that never winks, and they think he is

FROM 1880 TO 1850., 177

staring at some phantom of his own creation. He talks of things past their comprehension,
and they pronounce him mad.

Would to Heaven there were more such madmen among our rulers and legislators, to
make folly silent and wickedness ashamed ; to assert and defend the principles of our revo-
lution; to detect quack politicians, quack lawyers, and quack divines; and to aﬁbrd to their
countrymen examples of inﬂexible integrity both in public and private life.

THE QUARREL OF SQUIRE BULL AND HIS SON JONATHAN.

John Bull was a choleric old fellow, who held a good manor in the middle of a great mill-
pond, and which, by reason of its being quite surrounded by water, was generally called
Bullock Island. Bull was an ingenious man, an exceedingly good blacksmith, a dexterous
cutler, and a notable weaver, and pot-baker besides. He also brewed capital porter, ale, and
small beer, and was in fact a sort of Jack-of-all-trades, and good at each. In addition to
these, he was a hearty fellow, a11 excellent bottle-companion, and passably honest as
times go.

But what tarnished all these qualities was a quarrelsome, overbearing disposition,
which was always getting him into some scrape or other. The truth is, he never heard of
a quarrel going on among his neighbors, but his ﬁngers itched to be in the thickest of
them ; so that he was hardly ever seen without a broken head, a black eye, or a bloody nose.
Such was Squire Bull, as he was commonly called by the country people his neighbors --
one of those odd, testy, grumbling, boasting old codgers, that never get credit for what they
are, because they are always pretending to be what they are not. . .

The squire was as tight a hand to deal with in-doors as out ; sometimes treating his family
as if they were not the same ﬂesh and blood, when they happened to differ with him in certain
matters. One day he got into a dispute with his youngest son Jonathan, who was i‘-amiliarl y
called Brother Jonathan, about whether churches ought to be called churches or meeting-
houses; and whether steeples were not an abomination. The squire, either having the

~worst of the argument, or being naturally impatient of contradiction, (I can’t tell Wl1l('h,)

fell into a great passion, and swore he would physio such notions out of the boy’s noddle.
So he went to some of his doctors and got them to draw up a prescription, made up of t7u'1'z‘y-
mjvze d1;_fj'e7'cnt a7'tz'cZcs, many of them bitter enough to some palates. This he tried to make
Jonathan swallow; and ﬁnding he made villanous wry faces, and would not do it, fell upon
him and beat him like fury. After this, he made the house so disagreeable to him, that
Jonathan, though hard as a pine-knot and as tough as leather, could bear it no longer.
Taking his gun and his axe, he put himself in a boat, and paddled over the mill-pond to
some new lands to which the squire pretended some sort of claim, intending to-settle there,
a11d build a meeting—housewithout a steeple as soon as he grew rich enough.

When he got over, Jonathan found that the land was quite in a state of nature, covered
with wood, and inhabited by nobody but wild beasts. But being a la.d of mettle, he took
his axe on one shoulder and his gun on the other, marched into the thickest of the wood,
and clearing a place, built a log hut. Pursuing his labors, and handling his axe like a
notable woodman, he in a few years cleared the land, which he laid out into thirteen good
farms ; and building himself a fine frame house, about half-ﬁnished, began to be quite
snug and comfortable.

But Squire Bull, who was getting old and stingy, and, besides, was in great want of money,
on account of his having lately been made to pay swinging damages for assaulting his neigh-
bors and breaking their heads—the squire, I say, ﬁnding Jonathan was getting well to
do in the world, began to be very much troubled about his welfare; so he demanded that
Jonathan should pay him a good rent for the land which he had cleared and made good for
something. He trumped up I know not what claim against him,~-and under different pre-
tences managed to pocket all Jonathan’s honest gains. In tact, the poor lad had not a

shilling left for holiday occasions; and had it not been for the ﬁlial respect he felt for the
old man, he would certainly have refused to submit to such impositions.

But for all this, in a little time, Jonathan grew up to be very large of his age. and became a
tall, stout, double-jointed, broad-footed cub of a fellow, awkward in his gait and simple in
hlS appearance; but showing a lively, shrewd look, and having the promise of great strength
when he should get his full growth. He was rather an odd-looking chap, in truth, and
had many queer ways ; but everybody that had seen John Bull saw a great likeness between
them, and swore he was J ohn’s own boy, and a true chip of the old block. Like the old
squire, he was apt to be blustering and saucy, but in the main was a peaceable sort of care-
less fellow, that would quarrel with nobody if you only let him alone. He used to dress in
homespun trousers with a huge bagging seat * * *, and always wore a linsey-Wolsey
coat * * *, the sleeves of which were so short that his hand and wrist came out beyond
them, looking like a shoulder of mutton. All of which was in consequence of his growing
so‘ fast that he outgrew his clothes.

While Jonathan was outgrowing his strength in this way, Bull kept on picking his pock-
ets of every penny he could scrape together; till at last one day when the squire was even
more than usually pressing in his demands, which he accompanied with threats, Jonathan
started up in a furious passion and threw the Tea-kettle at the old man’s head. The choleric
Bull was hereupon exceedingly enraged; and after calling the poor lad an undutiful, un-
grateful, rebellious rascal, seized him by the collar, and forthwith a furious scuﬂie ensued.
This lasted a long time; for the squire, though in years, was a capital boxer, and of most
excellent bottom. At last, however, Jonathan got him under, and before he would let him
up, made him‘ sign apaper giving up all claim to the farms, and acknowledging the fee-
simple to be in Jonathan forever.

John Sanderson.

JOHN SANDERSON, 17 83-1844, was a man of genial temper and great
kindness of heart, and a genuine humorist. His American in Paris, and
American in London have seldom been excelled for brilliancy of wit- Be-

‘ sides these works, he ‘edited The Biography of the Signers of the Declara-
V tion of Independence, in seven volumes, and wrote the ﬁrst two volumes of

the collection.

Prof. Sanderson was born near Carlisle, Pennsylvania; he studied law for a time; became
a classical teacher; resided in. Paris for a year, 1835-6; and was one of the original Pro-
fessors in the Philadelphia High-School, from 1838 to 1844.

DINING IN PARIS.

The French being naturally a more sociable people than the English, and being less
wealthy, and having less comfortable homes, frequent more public-houses; so that these
establishments are, of course, made to excel in decoration and convenience as well as science.
Indeed, cookery at home, and many other things at home,will always want the stimulus ne-
cessary to a very high state of improvement. No one of the arts has attained eminence even,
unless fostered by rivalship and public patronage, and brought under the popular inspec-
tion. Much is said about the undomesticated way of the French living, but certain it is that
the social qualities have gained more than the domestic have lost; and it is certain that the
wealthy and fashionable French are after all less erratic in their habits and less discontented
with their homes than the domestic and comfortable English. Comfort! comfort! nothing
but comfort! To escape they wander everywhere upon the broad sea and land, and reside

FROM 1880 TO 1850. 179

among the Loo-koos, Creeks, and Negroes-—everywhere disgusted. Where—into What
uncivilized nook of earth, can you go without ﬁnding even there women?

“If to the west you roam,

There some blue’s ‘at home ’
Among the blacks of Carolina,

Or ﬂy you to the east, you see '

Some Mrs. Hopkins at her tea
And toast, upon the Walls of China.”

The very genteel Parisians do not encumber their houses with kitchens at all, and that
ugly hobdomadal event, a wash-day, is totally unknown in the Parisian domestic economy.
The f'amilies dine out in a family group, or by appointment with friends, or the dinner is
served in their apartments——a duty which is assigned to an individual you meet every-
where in a white night—cap and apron, and whom they call a traiteur.

VVhat a gay and animated picture the Parisian restaurant with its spacious mirrors, and
marble tables gracefully distributed, with its pretty woman at the comptoir, erected for her
often at the expense of many thousand francs, and with its linen of winnowed snow, the
whole displayed at night under a blaze of glittering chandeliers, and alive with its joyous
and various company! The custom of dining the best-bred ladies in these public saloons
gives them an air of elegance, decency, and Vivacity it is in vain to hope for under any direc-
tion where there is a public separation of the sexes, as in England and America.

Cooking, like the drama, will conform with public opinion, and bad eaters and bad judges
of a play, are alike the ruin of good houses, and of the reputation of the artists. We to the
gastronomy of a people whose public taste is gross and uncultivated. In those countries
where men dine with cynical veracity in ﬁfteen minutes, why talk of it ? —d2'ne, as Careme
eloquently and indignantly expresses it, as if they had craws for the comminution of their
food after its deglutition.

I remember about ﬁve hundred dyspeptics who used to group themselves about the Red
Sulphur, (which they preferred of all the Virginia Springs for the abundance of its table ;)
how they used to saunter about in little squads, or huddle altogether at the little ruby and
sulphurous fountain, and discourse the livelong day of gastric juices, peristaltic motions,
kneading of stomachs, virtues of aliments and remedies, inquiring diligently into the cause
that might be assigned for the almost epidemic prevalence of this disease; some blaming
the stars, some hot rolls, others the cacochymical qualities of our American climate, and a
few threatened to leave the country. Two Virginia members believed it was the exciting
nature of our institutions, and they sat about on stumps, (these gentlemen having a great
aﬂinity for stun1ps,) pale, abdominous, and wan, and nearly disgusted with republicanism ;
and there was an Irish gentleman, who had a strong suspicion he might have been changed
at nurse, for he was a healthy baby. '

These things are better managed in China. Chewing is done, they say, at a large Chinese
ordinary, by a kind of isochronical movement, regulated by music. They have a leader, as
at our concerts, and 111) go the jaws upon sharp F, and down upon G flat. I wish our “Con-
script Fathers ” at Washington, if it would not interfere too much with the liberty of the
subject, would take this matter under consideration, and if, themselves, they would chew
and digest a little more their dinners and speeches, I beg leave to intimate, it would be, not

only a personal comfort, but an economy of the money and reputation of the Republic. The A

destiny of a nation, says a sensible French writer, may depend upon the digestion of the
ﬁrst minister. Who knows, then, but the distress that has fallen, without any assignable
cause, like a blight upon our prosperity ; that the contentious ill-humors of our two Houses;
their sparrings, duellings, ﬂoggings, removal of deposits, expungings, vetoings, and disrup~
tion of cabinets, may not be chieﬂy owing to an imperfect mastication by the two honorable
bodies,'the president, secretaries, and others entrusted with the mismanagement of the
country. Legislation on such subjects is not without respectable precedent. The emperor

Domitian had it brought regularly before his senate What sauce he should employ upon a
turbot. It was put to vote in committee of the whole, and the decree (as related by Tacitus,
and translated by the Almcmach cles G0m'm<mds) was a sauce piquamfe.

The entire force of appetite is concentrated, in Paris, upon two meals, and an inﬁnite
variety of dishes is sought to give enjoyment to these two meals. To dine on a single dish
the French call an “atrocity.” The precept of the goumncwzcl is to economize appetite and
prolong pleasure, and therefore intermediate refreshments of all kinds are strictly forbidden.
Cake-shops are patronized by foreigners only.

Joseph C. Neal.

JOSEPH C. NEAL, 1807 -1847 , was, like Sanderson, essentially a humorist.
Mr. Neal’ s Charcoal Sketches, conta.ining amusing pictures of city life, were
in their time as original and as racy as the earlier papers of the same kind
by Dickens. Another volume of like character, by Mr. Neal, was called
Peter Ploddy and Other Oddities.

Mr. Neal died in early manhood, much lamented by the public, with

whom he was fast becoming a general favorite.
_ Mr. Neal was born at Greenland, New I-Iampshire. He settled in Philadelphia, and in
1831 became editor of the Pennsylvanian, a political paper, i11 which position he was entirely
out" of his element. In 1844-, he began a Weekly literary paper 011 his own account, Neal's
Saturday Gazette, which was received with marked favor, and which he continued to edit
until the time of his death.

A PRETTY TIME OF NIGHT.

We know it to beitheoretical in certain schools——in the kitchen, for instance, which
is the most orthodox and sensible of the schools —— that, as a general rule, the leading fea-
tures of character are indicated by the mode in which we pull the bell ; and that, to a con-

. siderable extent we may infer the kind of person who is at the door —— just as we do the kind"

of ﬁsh that bobs the cork-—-by the species of vibration which is given to the wire. Rash,
impetuous, choleric, and destructive, what chance has the poor little bell in such hands?
But the considerate, modest, lowly, and retiring—do you ever know such people to break
things? Depend upon it, too, that our self—estimate is largely indicated by our conduct in
this respect. If it does not betray what we really are, it most assuredly discloses the
temper of the mind at the moment of our ringing.

“Tinkle ! ”

Did you hear?

Nothing could be more amiable or more unobtrusive than that. It would scarcely disturb
the nervous system of a mouse; and whoever listened to it, might at once understand that
it was the soft tinlinnabulary whisper of a gentleman of the convivial turn and of the
“locked out ” description, who, conscious probably of default, is desirous of being admitted
to his domiciliary comforts, upon the most paciﬁc and silent terms that can be obtained
from those who hold the citadel and possess the inside of the door.

“ Tinkle I ”

Who can doubt that he —Mr. Tinkle —would take off his boots and go up-stairs in his
stocking-feet, muttering rebuke to every step that creaked? What a deprecating mildness
there is in the department of the “ great locked out!” How gently do they tap, and how
Softly do they ring; while perchance, in due proportion to their enjoyment in untimely and
protracted revel, is the penitential aspect of their return. There is a “ never—do-so-any-more-
;isl1ness ” all about them——- yea——even about the bully boys “ who would n’t go home till
morning—till daylight does appear,” singing up to the very door ; and when they

“ Tinkle ! ”

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 181

It is intended as a hint merely, and not as a broad annunciation——insinuated—not pro-
claimed aloud ——that somebody who is very sorry ——who “ did n’t go to help it,” and all
that———is at the threshold, and that if it be the same to you, he would be exceedingly glad
to come in, with as little of scolding and rebuke as may be thought likely to answer the
purpose.‘ There is a hope in it— a subdued hope —

“Tinkle! ”

-— that perchanee a member of the f'amily—good-natured as well as insomnolent—may be
spontaneously awake, and disposed to open the door without clamoring up Malcolm, Donw
albain, and the whole house. Why should every one know? But-

“ Tinkle — tinkle ! ”

Even patience itself ——on a damp, chilly, unwholesome night——patience at the street door,
all alone by itself and disposed to slumber —— as patience is apt to be after patience has been
partakin: of potations and of collations —— even patience itself cannot be expected to remain
tinkling there —“ pianissimo ” — hour after hour, as if there was nothing else in this world
worthy of attention but the ringing of bells. Who can be surprised, that patience at last
becomes reckless and desperate, let the consequences-—rhinoceroses or Hyrcan tigers-
assume what shape they may?

There is a furious stampede upon the marble — a ﬁerce word or two of scathing Saxon,
and then — ' ‘

“ Rangle ——ja—a-a-ngle— ra-a-a-ngI ! l” the sound being that of a sharp, stinging, excru-
ciating kind, which leads to the conclusion that somebody is “worse,” and is getting in a
rage. _

That one, let me tell you, was Mr. Dawson Dawdle, in whom wrath had surmounted "dis-
cretion, and who, as a forlorn hope, had now determined to Inake good his entrance —-
assault, storm, escalade——— at any hazard and at any cost. Dawson Dawdle was furious now
—“ sevagerous ” — as you have been, probably, when kept at the door till your teeth rattled
like castanets and cachuchas.

Passion is picturesque in attitude as well as poetic in expression. Dawson Dawdle braced

his feet one on each side of the door—post, as a purchase, and tugged at the hell with both

hands, until windows flew up i11 all directions, and night-capped heads in curious variety
were projected into the gloom. Something seemed to be the matter at Dawdle’s.

“ Who ’s sick? ” cried one.

“ Where ’s the ﬁre? ” asked another.

“ The Mexicans are come I ” shouted  third. B11t Dawson Dawdle had reached that state
of intensity, which is regardless of every consideration but that of the business in hand, and
he continued to pull away, as if at work by the job, while several watchmen stood by in
admiration of his zeal. Yet there was no answer to this pealing appeal for admittance—-
not that Mrs. Dawson Dawdle was deaf— not she ——- nor dumb, either. Nay, she had recog-
nized Mr. Dawdle’s returning step —— that husba.nd’s “ foot ” which should according to the
poet,

“Have music in ’t,
As he comes up the stair.”

But "Dawdle was allowed to make his music in the street, while his wife—obdurate——-
listened with a smile bordering, we fear, a little upon exultation, at his progressive lessons
and rapid improvement in the art of ringing “ triple-bob-majors.”

“Let him wait,” remarked Mrs. Dawson Dawdle‘, “let him wait—’t will do him good.
I ’m sure I ’ve been waiting long enough for him.”

And so she had; but, though there be a doubt whether this process of waiting had “ done
good” in her own case, yet, if there be truth or justice in the vengeful practice which would
have us act towards others precisely as they deport themselves to us, —~ and every one con-
cedes that it is very agreeable, however wrong, to carry on the war after this fashion,——
Mrs. Dawson Dawdle could have little diﬁiculty in justifying herself for the course adopted.

Only to think of it, now!

16

182 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Mrs. Dawson Dawdle is one of those natural and proper people, who become sleepy of even-
ings, and who are rather apt" to yawn after tea. Mr. Dawson Dawdle, on the other hand, is
of the unnatural and improper species, who are not sleepy or yawny of evenings—never so,
except of mornings. Dawson insists on it that he is no chicken to go to roost at sundown ;
while Mrs. Dawson Dawdle rises with the lark. The larks he prefers are larks at night.
Now, as a corrective to these differences of opinion, Dawson Dawdle had been cunningly
deprived of his pass-key, that he might be induced “to remember not to forget” to come
home betimes—a thing he Was not apt to remember, especially if good companionship
intervened. . . . .

This last peal-—as peals, under such circumstances, are apt to be—was louder, more
sonorous, and in all respects more terriﬁc than any of its “illustrious predecessors,” prac-
tice in this respect tending to the improvement of skill on the one hand,just as it adds
provocation to temper on the other. For a moment, the fate of Dawson Dawdle quivered
in the scale, as the eye of his exasperated lady glanced fearfully round the room for a means
of retaliation and redress. Nay, her hand rested for an instant upon a pitcher, while
thoughts of hydropathics, douches, shower-baths, Graef nbergs, and Priessnitzes, in their
medicinal application to dilatory husbands. presented themselves in quick aquatic succes-v
sion, like the rushings of a cataract. Never did man come nearer to being drowned than
Mr. Dawson Dawdle. _ V

“ But no,” said she, relenting ; “if he were to ketch his death 0’ cold, he ’d be a great deal
more trouble than he is now—husbands with bad co1ds—coughing husbands and sneezing
husba.nds——are the stupidest and tiresomest kind of husbands ; bad as they may be, ducking
don’t improve ’em. I’ll have recourse to moral suasion; and if that won’t answer, I’ll
duck him afterwards.” I

Suddenly, and in the midst of a protracted jangle, the door ﬂew widely open, and dis—‘

played the form of Mrs. Dawson Dawdle, standing sublime——silent —statuesque —wrapped
in wrath and enveloped in taciturnity. Dawdle wasvappalled.

“ My dear I ” and his hand dropped nervelessly from the bell-handle. “ My dear, it ’s me
—only me! ” ‘

Not a word of response to the tender appeal ——the lady remained obdurate in silence-
chilly and voiceless as the marble, with her eyes sternly fixed upon the intruder. Dawson
Dawdle felt himself running down. '

“ My dear—he! he! ” and:Dawson laughed with a melancholy quaver———“it ’s me that ’s
‘tome home——-you know me-——it ’s late. I confess — it ’s most always late ——and I——-ho! ho!
——why don’t you say something, Mrs. Dawson Dawdle!-—Do you think I ’m going to be
ikeered, Mrs. Dawdle? ” ' ‘

As the parties thus confronted ‘each other, Mrs. Dawdle’s “masterly inactivity” _proved
overwhelming. For reproaches, Dawson was preparod——he could bear part in a War of
opinion——-the squabble is easy to most of us —but where are we when the antagonist will
not deign to speak, and environs us, as it were, in an ainbuscade, so that we fear the more
because we don’t know what to fear?

“Why don’t she blow me up? ” queried Dawdle to liimsolf, as he found his valor collap-
sing—“ why don’t she blow me up like an affectionate woman and a loving wife, instead of
standing there in that ghostiﬁed fashion? ”

«Mrs. Dawdle’s hand slowly extended itself towards the culprit, who made no attempt at
evasion or defence — slowly it entwined itself in the folds of his neck-handkerchief, and, as
the unresisting Dawson had strange fancies relative to bow—strings, he found himself drawn
inward by a sure and steady grasp. Swiftly was he sped through the darksome entry and
up the winding stair, without a word to comfort him in his stumbling progress.

“Dawson Dawdle I look at the clock! —a pretty time of night, indeed, and you a married
man. Look at the clock, I say, and see.”

Mrs. Dawson Dawdle, however, had, for the moment, lost her advantage in thus giving
utterance to her emotion; and Mr. Dawson L‘a\v-Cale, though much shaken, began to recover

this spirits.

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 183

“Two o’c1ock, Mr. Dawson-—two ! ——is n’t it two, I ask you? ”

“If you are positive about the fact, Mrs. Dawson, it would be unbecoming in me to call
your veracity in question, and I decline looking. So far as I am informed, it generally is
two o’clock just about this time in the morning ——at least, it always has been whenever I
stayed up to see. If the clock is right, you ’ll be apt to ﬁnd it two just as it strikes two-
that ’s the reason it strikes, and I don’t know that it could have a better reason.”

“ A pretty time i ”

“ Yes—pretty enough I ” responded Dawdle; “ when it don’t rain, one time of night is as
pretty as another time of night—it ’s the people that ’s up in the time of night, that ’s not
pretty; and you, Mrs. Dawdle, are a case in point-—kecping a man out of his own house.
It ’s not the night that ’s not pretty, Mrs. Dawdle, but the goings on. As for me, I ’m for
peace — a deadlatch key and peace; and I move that the goings on be indeﬁnitely postponed,
because, Mrs. Dawdle, I ’ve heard it all before —and I know it like a book; and if you insist
on it, Mrs. Dawdle, I ’ll save you trouble, and speak the whole speech for you right off the
reel, only I can’t cry good when I ’m jolly.”

But Dawson Dawdle’s volubility, assumed for the purpose of hiding his own misgivings,

did not answer the end which he had in view ; for Mrs. Dawson Dawdle, having had a glimpse '

at its effects, again resorted to the “ silent system ” of connubial management. She spoke
no more that night, which Dawson, perchance, found agreeable enough; but she would not
speak any more the day after, which perplexed him when he came down too late for break-
fast, or returned too late for dinner. »

“I do wish she would say something,” muttered Dawdle ; “something cross, if she likes
-—-any thing, so it makes a noise. It makes a man feel bad, after he ’s used to being talked
to, not to be talked to in the old-fashioned way. When one’s so accustomed to being blowed
up, it seems as if he was lost or did n’t belong to anybody, if no one sees to it that he’s
blowed up at the usual time. Bachelors, perhaps, can get along well enough without hav-
ing their comforts properly attended to in this respect, —~what do they know, the miserable
creatures, about s11ch warm receptions, and such little endearments? When they are out
too late, nobody ’s at home preparing a speech for them; but I feel just as if I was a wid-
ower, if I ’m not talked to for not being at home in time.” .

John Neal.

JOHN NEAL, 1793-1876, was for a time the Nestor of American maga-
zinists. He began writing early in life, his ﬁrst volume having appeared
in 1817, and he continued almost to the time of his death to exercise his
gifts, his latest Volume bearing the date of 1870. Mr. Neal ﬁrst gained
celebrity in 1824, by a series of brilliant papers in BlackWood’s Magazine.
These papers were chieﬂy on American affairs, and Were Written in Eng-
land, where the author was at that time resident. '

Mr. Neal was born, and for the greater part of his life he lived, in Portland, Maine. He
was originally a Friend, but left the society. At the age of twelve, he was a shop-boy in
Portland. Afterwards he taught drawing and penmanship in various towns in Maine. Then
he was adry-goods jobber successively in Boston, New York, and Baltimore. Failing in this
line, he began in 1816 the study of law, but ﬁnally, in 1817, determined to throw himself
upon his pen for support, and from that time until 1850 he was engaged almost continuously
in authorship. He has written both in prose and verse. His writings have been on almost
every variety of topic, and have appeared sometimes in magazines, and sometimes in inde-
pendent volumes. He wrote usually with extraordinary rapidity, his pieces being struck
013' at a white heat, and without pausing to correct or polish. The amount of his contribu-

184 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

tions to current literature is enormous, and they contain much that is valuable. Yet it is
doubtful whether any of his works will survive. Prominent among his novels are Logan,
Randolph, Seventy-six (scene laid in the American Revolution), Rachel Dyer, The Down-

Easters, Brother Jonathan, Authorship, True \Vomanhood, etc. He has also \vritten Otho,

Our Ephraim, and other plays, and the poems on The Ba.ttle of Niagara, Goldan the Maniac
Harper, etc. In 1870 he published a semi-autobiographical work, V/Vandering Recollections
of a Somewhat Busy Life.

Mr. Neal has evinced unquestionable poetical ability. His verse is vigorous and contains
occasional passages of high merit, but is rendered intolerable by want of pruning and
toning down. In the words of Griswold, the author “has no just sense of proportion,”
or, as Lowell has still more sharply expressed it, in his Fable for Critics, he

— “cracked half the notes of a truly ﬁne voice
Because song drew less instant attention than noise.”

Mr. Neal’s novels and plays also, although rich in ﬁne passages, are spoiled by extravagance
and incoherency. His abilities are unquestionable. VVith a little more care, and a little
less impatience, he might have achieved permanent renown.

VVILLIAM LEGGETT, 1802-1840, was a native and resident of the city of New York. He
served for a while as niidsliipman in the U. S. Navy ; was editor of The Critic, and associated
with VVm. C. Bryant in the editorship of The Evening Post; also editor of The Plain-
dealer. Aside from his editorial labors he published Leisure Hours at Sea, a volume of
poems composed by him while in the service; -also Naval Stories, and Tales by a Country
Schoolmaster. His political writings were edited with a preface, in 18l0, by Theodore
Sedgwick. A

Leggett had many warm friends, who deeply lamented his premature death, which cut
short what had seemed the promise of a brilliant career. Bryant alludes to Leggett in the
lines,

“The earth may ring from shore to shore,” 850.

Charles F"er11:1o Hoffrnan.

CHARLES FENNO HOFFMAN, 1806 ,held in the last generation a

conspicuous place in general literature. He founded the well-known Knick-

erbocker Magazine, and published several volumes both of prose and verse,"
and was one of the notabilities of New York city, social and literary. Since ’

1850, mental disorder has kept him in complete retirement from the world.

Hoffman is a native and a. resident of New York city. He graduated at Columbia Col-
lege, and studied law, but abandoned it for literature. He wrote a number of novels and
tales: Wild Scenes in Forest and Prairie; A VVinter in the “Test; Greyslaer, &c., and sev-
eral collections of poems, among them the Vigil of Faith, Lays of the Hudson, Love’s Calen-
dar; also a number of popular songs, such as Rosalie Clare, Sparkling and Bright, The
Myrtle and Steel. In 1833, he established the well-known Knickerbocker lllagazine; sub-
sequently he was editor of The American Monthly, The New York Mirror, and The New
York Literary World. He also contributed to Sp-arks’s American Biography the sketch
entitled The Administration of Jacob Leisler.

‘ N. P. Willis.

NATHANIEL PARKER VVILLIS, 1806-1867, was in his day a leader among
the “lesser lights” of American Literature. He was identiﬁed with the

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 185

New York Mirror and the Home Journal, at that time the two most popu-
lar of our literary journals. He wrote poetry which found its way into
most common school Reading Books, and into all young ladies’ albums.
He wrote volumes of prose, ﬁlled with sketches of scenery and snatches oi
social gossip, which seemed to charm every reader.

Mr. Willis was a native of Portland, Maine, and the descendant of a well-known family
of publishers. He studied at Phillips_,Academy, Andover, and at Yale, where he was grad-
uated in 1827. The following year he undertook the editorial management of The Legend
any, a magazine established by Goodrich (Peter Parley),,and in the year after that The
Token. In 1829 he established The American Monthly, which was merged in 1931 into the
well-known New York Mirror. Of this latter \Villis and lllorris were joint editors.

From 1831 to 1835 Mr. W'illis travelled in Europe. Mr. Rives, then United States Minister
to France, appointed him attache, and this position gave him access to the upper circles of
European society, which he turned to good account. In 1835 he married the daughter of

‘General Stace, of the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, and, returning to America, resided, until

his wife’s death in 1814, chieﬂy at a beautiful place on the Susquehanna, which he named,
after his wife, Glenmary.

In 1844 he revisited Europe, and in 1816 married his second wife, Miss Grinnell. The re-
mainder of his life was passed chieﬂy at his well-known place, Idlewild, near NeV\'b11i‘gl1.
In 1851 he made a tour for the beneﬁt of his health through the South and the “fest Indies.
Soon after his second marria:_:c, in 1816, he became associated with 1\'Iorris in the publication
of the Home Journal, to which he remained a permanent contributor.

Willis represents a phase of American literature which was at one time extremely fash-
ionable, but which has since lost its hold upon the popular mind. His works, which are
too numerous and too miscellaneous to admit of complete enumeration, are chieﬂy of one
class. They are easy essays or sketches, the droppings of society chit-chat, covered over
with a thin varnish of ﬁction. Indeed, this outer coating is at times so thin as to otter no
concealment, and the real persons described may be recognized very readily by their friends
or their enemies. I-Ie belongs, in the language of one of his critics, to the Venetian school
of art, that is to say, he is less concerned with his thoughts than with his language, with
what he has to say than with how he is to say it. Partly by his lively manner, partly by
the personality of his sketches, partly by appealing to the popular taste for wha.t is striking
and bizarre, he succeeded in making himself at one time the most widely read author of his
classi1rA111e1'ica.. It is not risking much, however, to predict that the present and the
coming generation, strengthened and deepened by the works of men like Whittier, Bryant,
Longfellow, Lowell, Hawthorne, will demand more substantial nourishment. Willis’s
poetry, in fact, is decidedly out of date. It is musical in structure, and delicate in senti~
ment, but gravely deﬁcient in force.

The best. known of his poetical works, perhaps, are his Scriptural Poems, Melanie, and Lady
Jane. The principal of his prose works are Pencillings by the W'ay_, lnklings by the Way,
People I have Met, Life Here and There, llurry-graphs, The Rag Bag, Famous Persons and
Places, The Convalescent, etc. i

Willis also furnished the text to Bartlett’s American Scenery, and other illustrated
works.

Willis’s novels Tortesa, and Bianca Visconti (published together under the fantastic title
of Two Ways of Dying for a Husband), and Paul Fane are not equal to his sketches. The
author was too deﬁcient in constructive art to elaborate a well sustained narrative. Daslies
at Life with a Free Pencil, a collective edition of sketches of travel, is perhaps his spiciest
work, and Rural Letters the most toned down.

Wil1is’s style is good in the structure of the sentence, but is often marred by the use of
words and phrases coined by himself. This affectation is greatly to be regretted in one
who could be, when he chose, a perfect master in case and finish.

SPRING.

The Spring is here, the delicate—footed May,
With its slight ﬁngers full of leaves and ﬂowers;
And with it comes a thirst to be away,
Wasting in wood-paths its voluptuoushours;
A feeling that is like a sense of wings,
Restless to soar above these perishing things.

We pass out from the city’s feverish hum,
To ﬁnd refreshment in the silent woods;
And Nature, that is beautiful and dumb,
Like a cool sleep upon the pulses in-oods;
Yet, even there, a restless thought will steal,
To teach the indolent heart it still must feel.

Strange, that the audible stillness of the noon,

The waters tripping with their silver feet.
The turning to the light of leaves in Jul-.e,

And the light whisper as their edges meet:
Strange, that they ﬁll not, with their tranquil tone,
The spirit, Walking in their midst alone.

There ’s no contentment in a World like this,
Save in forgetting the immortal dream;
We may not gaze upon the stars of bliss,
That through the cloud-rifts radiantly stream;
Bird-like, the prison’d soul will lift its eye
And pine till it is hooded from the sky.

TRENTON FALLS.

Trentou Falls is rather a misnomer. I scarcely know what you would call it, but the
wonder of nature which bears the name is a tremendous torrent, whose bed, for several
miles, is sunk fathoms deep into the earth -—a roaring and dashing stream, so far below the
surface of the forest in which it is lost, that you would think, as you come suddenly upon
the edge of its long precipice, that it was a river in some inner world, (coiled within ours,
as we in the outer circle of the ﬁrmament,) and laid open by some Titanic three that had
cracked clear asunder the crust of this “shallow earth.” The idea is rather assisted if you
happen to see below you, on its abysmal shore, a party of adventurous travellers; for, at
that vast depth, and i11 contrast with the gigantic trees and rocks, the same number of well-
shaped pismires, dressed in the last fashions, and philandering upon your parlor ﬂoor,
would be about of their apparent size and distinctness.

They showed me at Eleusis, the well by ,which Proserpine ascends to the regions of day on
her annual visit to the plains of Thessaly-——but with the genius loci at my elbow in the
shape of a Greek girl as lovely as Phi-yne, my memory reverted to the bared axle of the
earth in the bed of this American river, and I was persuaded (looking the while at the
feromére of gold sequins on the Phidian _forehead of my Katinka) that supposing Hades in
the centre of the earth, you are nearer to it by some fathoms at Trenton. I confess I have
had, since my ﬁrst descent into those depths, an uncomfortable doubt of the solidity of the

I globe —-how can it hold together with such a crack in its bottom 1

Most people talk of the subl2'«mz'ty of Trenton, but I have haunted it by the week together
for its mere loveliness. The river in the heart of that fearful chasm is the most varied. and

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 187

beautiful assemblage of the thousand forms and shapes of running water that I know of in
the world. The soil and the deep—striking roots of the forest terminate far above you, look-
ing like a black rim on the enclosing precipices; the bed of the river and its sky-sustaining
walls are of solid rock, and, with the tremendous descent of the stream———forming for miles
one continuous succession of falls and rapids —the channel is worn into curves and cavities
which throw the clear waters into forms of inconceivable brilliancy and variety. It is a
sort of half-twilight below, with here and there a long beam of sunshine reaching down to
kiss the lip of an eddy or form a rainbow over a fall, and the reverberating and changing
echoes,
“ Like a ring of bells whose sound the Wind still alters,”

maintain a constant and most soothing music, varying at every step with the varying phase of
the current. Cascades of from twenty or thirty feet, over which the river ﬂies with a single
and hurrying leap, (not a drop missing from the glassy and bending sheet,) occur frequently
as you ascend; and it is from these the place takes its name. But the Falls, though beau-
tiful, are only peculiar from the dazzling and unequalled rapidity with which the waters
come to the leap. If it were not for the leaf which drops wavering down into the abyss
from trees apparently painted on the sky, and which is caught away by the ﬂashing cur-
rent as if the lightning had suddenly crossed it, you would think the vault of the steadfast
heavens a ﬂying element as soon. The spot in that long gulf of beauty that I best remem-
ber is a smooth descent of some hundred yards, where the river in full and undivided vol-
ume skims over a plane as polished as a table of scagliola, looking, in its invisible speed,
like one mirror of gleaming but motionless crystal. Just above, there is a sudden turn in
the glen which sends the Water like acatapult against the opposite angle of the rock, and, in
the action of years, it has worn out a cavern of unknown depth, into which the whole mass
of the river plunges with the abandonment of a ﬂying ﬁend into hell, and, reappearing like
the angel that has pursued him, glides swiftly but with divine serenity on its way. (I am
indebted for that last ﬁgure to Job, who tra\'elle.Ll with a Milton in his pocket, and had a
natural redolence of “ Paradise Lost ” in his conversation.)

Much as I detest water in small quantities, (to drink,) I have a hydromania in the way
of lakes, rivers, and waterfalls. It is, by much, the belle in the family of the elements.
Earth is never tolerable unless disguised i11 green. Air is so thin as only to be visible when
she borrows drapery of water; and Fire is so staringly bright as to be unpleasant to the
eyesight; but water, soft, pure, graceful water! there is no shape into which you can throw
her that she does not seem lovelier than before. She can borrow nothing of her sisters.
Earth has no jewels in her lap so brilliant as her own spray pearls or emeralds; Fire has no
rubies like what she steals from the sunset ; Air has no robes like the grace of "her ﬁne-woven
and ever-changing drapery of silver. A health (in wine 1) to WATER.

Who is there that did not love some stream in his youth? Who is there in whose vision
of the past there does not sparkle up, from every picture of childhood, a spring or a rivulet
woven through the darkened and torn woof of first affection like a thread of unchanged
silver? How do you interpret the instinctive yearning with which you search for the river-
side or the fountain in every scene of nature—the clinging unaware to the river’s course when
a truant in the ﬁelds in June—the dull void you ﬁndin every landscape of which it is not
the ornament and the centre? For myself, I hold with the Greek: “ Water is the ﬁrst prin-
ple of all things 2 we are made from it and we shall be resolved into it.”

George P. Morris.

GEORGE P. MORRIS, 1802-1864, was intimately associated, in fame and
fortunes, with Mr. VVillis. They were jointly concerned in the New York
Mirror and the Home Journal, and as such Were for a time the arbiters of

188 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

taste and fashion in literary matters. Mr. Morris was chieﬂy distinguished
as a song writer. A He produced also a Very successful drama, Briar-Cliff,
and an opera, The Maid of Saxony.

Mr. Morris was born in Philadelphia, but went early to New York,'and is known only as
a New Yorker. He began in 1823, in connection with Woodworth, the publication of the
Mirror, which was continued for twenty years, with distinguished success, and which had
among its contributors Bryant, II-alleek, Paulding, Leggett, Hoffman, Fay, Epes Sargent,
and, above all, Willis. After some discontinuations and some changes in form and name, the
work reappeared in 1846 as the Home Journal, under the joint auspices of Morris and Wil-
lis, and was for a long time the chief favorite with the reading public.

Mr. Morris was one of the most popular song-writers of America. Many of his short,
simple strains are so well known and so frequently quoted that the author’s name is not
even known by many who use his verses. Prominent among these short lyrics are My
Mother’s Bible; Woodman, Spare That Tree; Long Time Ago; Near the Lake where drooped
the Willow; 0 think of Me. Besides his songs, Morris was, as already stated, the author of
a successful drama, Briar-Cliff, and of an opera, The Maid of Saxony; and he edited, in
partnership with Willis, The Prose and Poetry of Europe and America.

“ Morris is the best known poet of the country, —— by acclamation, not by criticism. He
is just what poets would be if they sang, like birds, without criticism; and it is a peculiar-
ity of his fame that it seems as regardless of criticism as a bird in the air. Nothing can
stop a song of his. It is very easy to say that they are easy to do. They have a momentum,
somehow, that it is difﬁcult for others to give, and that speeds them to the far goal of p0pu-
1arity.”—-JV’. P. Willis.

WOODMAN, SPARE THAT TREE.

Woodman, spare that tree!
Touch not a single bough!

In youth it sheltered me,
And I’ll protect it now.

’T was my foreIather’s hand
’.l‘hat placed it near his cot;

There, woodman, let it stand,
Thy axe shall harm it not!

That. old familiar tree,
W'hose glory and renown
Are spread o’er land and sea, -
And wouldst thou hew it down?
Woodman, forbear thy stroke!
Cut not -its earth-bound ties;
Oh, spare that aged oak,
N ow towering to the skies.

When but an idle boy

I sought its grateful shade;
In all their gushing joy

Here too my sisters played.
My mother kissed me here;

My father pressed my hand ~A
Forgive this foolish tear,

But let that old oak stand!

FROM 1830 T() 1850. 189

My heart-strings round thee cling,
Close as thy bark, old friend!
Here shall the wild-bird sing,
And still thy branches bend.
Old tree! the storm still brave!
And, woodman, leave the spot:
VVhile I’ve a hand to save,
Thy axe shall harm it not.

NEAR THE LAKE.

Near the lake where drooped the willow,
Long time ago!

Where the rock threw back the billow,
Brighter than snow,

Dwelt a maid, beloved and cherished

_ By high and low;

But with autumn’s leaf she perished
Long time ago!

Rock and tree, and ﬂowing water,
Long time ago!

Bee, and bird, and blossom taught her
Love’s spell to know!"

While to my fond words she listened,
Murmuring low!

Tenderly her dove-eyes glistened,
Long time ago!

Mingled were our hearts forever,
Long time ago!

Can I now forget her? Never!
No, lost one, no!

To her grave these tears are given,
Ever to flow;

She ’s the star I missed from heaven,
Long time ago!

PROSPER M. WETMORE, 1799 ———, a prominent New York merchant, who has been largely
connected with the literary interests of the city, was born at Stratford, Conn. He removed
with his parents to New York, and entered a counting-house when only nine years old. ' All
his literary work has been done in hours of leisure won from business. He began writing
for the public in 1816, when only seventeen years old, and continued to contribute to the
periodicals of the day, in conjunction with Morris and others. In 1830, he published his
only volume, Lexington and other Fugitive Poems. He helped in various ways, however,
to foster literature in that city during the early part of this century.

THEODORE S. FAY, 1807 ———, is a native of New York. He was Secretary of Legation at
Berlin from 1837 to 1853, and after 1853 Minister to Switzerland. He has been a contributor,
and was at one time editor, of the New York l\Iirror. His separate publications are Dreams
and Reveries of a Quiet Man; The Minute-Book, a journal of travel; Norman Leslie, a Tale
of the Present Times; Sydney Clifton; The Countess Ida; Hoboken, a Romance of New
York ; Robert Rueful ; Ulric, or The Voices; also, a series of papers on Shakespeare. Mr. Fay
writes in a pleasant, genial style, always leaving upon the reader’s mind the impression
that he has been in communion with a courteous and accomplished gentleman.

FREDERICK S. CozzENs, 1818-1869, was a native and resident of New York city, and one of
the most amusing contributors to the Knickerbocker and to Putnam’s Magazine. He pub»
lished The Sparrowgrass Papers; Prismatics; Stone House on the Susquehanna; Acadia, or
a Sojourn among the Blue Noses. He edited also The VVine-Press, almagazine devoted to
the business of vine-planting and wine-making. Hurd & I-Ioughton announce his complete
works.

JAMES HALL, 1793-1868, was born in Philadelphia. He served in the War of 1812-, and in
1820 went West and lived in Illinois until 1833, after which time he lived in Cincinnati. He
occupied various civil ofﬁces, including that of Judge, and in the latter years of his life was
engaged in commercial pursuits. During his long and busy life, he found leisure to write
several works of a popular character. The following are the chief: Letters from the West;
Legends of the West; The Soldier’s Bride, and Qther Tales ; The Harper’s Head, a Legend
of Kentucky; Tales of the Border; Notes on the Western States: Life of William Henry
Harrison; The Wilderness and the War-Path ; History of the Indian Tribes, written in con-
nection with Colonel Thomas L. McKinn(-.y, etc. The work last named was avery costly
illustrated work, embellished with one hundred and twenty portraits. The literary matter
was contributed chieﬂy by Judge Ilall. A complete edition of his other works, revised by
himself, was published in 1856, in 4 vols.

SOLITUDE.

And what is solitude? Is it the shade
Where nameless terrors brood-—

The lonely dell, or haunted glade,

By glossy phantasy arrayed?
This is not solitude.

For I have dared alone to tread,
In boyhood’s truant mood,

Among the mansions of the dead

By night, where others all have ﬂed-
Yet felt not solitude.

And I have travelled far and wide,
And clared by field and ﬂood;
Have sl.ept upon the mountain side,
Cr slumbered on the ocean’s tide,
And known no solitude.

RICHARD PENN SMITH, 1799—1854, was a native of Philadelphia, a grandson of Dr. William
Smith, the first President of the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Smith was a lawyer by
profession, but occupied himself with literature. He edited The Aurora, from 1822 to 1827 ;
published The Forsaken, a novel, in 1831; A Guide to Philadelphia, in 1832; The Actress of
Padua-, and other Tales, in 1836. He was also the author of several Plays and Poems. Fif-
teen of his Plays were produced on the stage in Philadelphia, and two of them were repro-
duced in London. The Tragedy of Caius Marius was written by him for Edwin Forrest.

ROBERT T. CONRAD, 1805—1858, was a native of Philadelphia, and for many years one of its
leaders in the world of letters. He was a lawyer by profession, and an eloquent pleader and
speaker. He became Judge of the Court of General Sessions in 1840, and Mayor of the city
in 1854. He wrote two tragedies, Conrad of Naples, and Aylmere, which were acted with
success. He wrote Sonnets and other minor poems, which have been much admired.

degree, he travelled in Spain and Africa, and elsewhere, and then settled in New York.
He has written several romances of awild and legendary character, which have had a decided
success: Kaloolah, or Journeyings to the Djebel-Kumri, a ﬁctitious tale of African adven-
tures; The Barber, or The Mountaineer of the Atlas; Romance-Dust from the Historic
Placer. ' '

LAUGHTON OSBORNE, ———- —-; a native of New York, and a graduate of Columbia Col-
lege, of the class of 1827, is the author of several works, the most prominent of which are
Sixty Years of the Life of Jeremy Levis, and The Confessions of a Poet, botl1 powerfully
written novels. The questionable morality of the latter was criticized by the Commercial
Advertiser, of which paper Stone was then editor. To this Osborne replied by Rubeta, an
Epic of Manhattan, with Illustrations done on Stone.

Rionartn HENRY WILDE, 1789-1847, distinguished equally as a lawyer and a man of letters,
was born in Dublin, Ireland. IIe came to the United States in 1797, settling ﬁrst in Balti-
more, and afterwards in Georgia. He became Attorney-General of that State, and repre-
sented it in Congress most of the time from 1815 to 1835. After that he spent ‘several years
in Europe, engaged in literary researches. On returning, he settled in New Orleans, and
was made Professor of Common Law in the Law Department of the University of Louisiana.
His publications are Conjectures and Researches concerning the Love, Madness, and Impris-
onment of Torquato Tasso; Hesperia, a Poem, published after his death. He had a Life of
Dante partly ﬁnished. He was a frequent contributor to the Southern Review and other
periodicals.

A beautiful poem of his, beginning with the words, “My life is like the summer rose,” is
connected with a curious piece of literary mystiﬁcation. After his poem had been for
some time going the rounds of the papers, “ Mr. Wilde was one day surprised to ﬁnd in a
Georgia newspaper a Greek Ode, purporting to have been written by Alcaeus, an early Eolian
poet of somewhat obscure fame, and it was claimed that Mr. VVilde’s verses were simply a
translation of this Ode, the ideas in both being almost identical. As Mr. Wilde had never
heard of Alcaeus, he was much puzzled to account for this resemblance of the two poems.
At the suggestion of a friend, the Greek Ode was sent to Mr. Binney for examination and
criticism. He at once, much to the relief of Mr. Wilde, pronounced it a forgery, and pointed
out wherein its style differed from that of the classical Greek. It turned out afterwards
that the Ode in question had been written by an Oxford scholar on a wager that no one in
that University was suﬁicientl y familiar with the style of the early Greek poets to detect the
counterfeit. To carry out this scheme, he had translated Mr. Wilde’s verses into Greek.” —

MY LIFE IS LIKE THE SUMMER ROSE.

My life is like the summer rose,
That opens to the morning sky, -
But ere the shades of evening close,

Is scattered on the ground—to die!
Yet on the rose’s humble bed
The sweetest dews of night are shed,
' As if she wept the waste to see—-
'But none shall weep a tear for me!

192 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

My life is like the autumn leaf,
That trembles in the moon’s pale ray;
Its hold is frail——its date is brief,
Restless-——and soon to pass away!
Yet, ere tl1at leaf shall fall and fade,
The parent tree will mourn its shade,
The winds bewail the leaﬂess tree,
But none shall breathe a sigh for me.

My life is like the prints, which feet
Have left on Tampa’s desert strand;
Soon as the rising tide shall beat,
All trace will vanish from the sand;
Yet, as if grieving to efface
All vestige of the human race,
On that lone shore loud moans the sea,
But none, alas! shall mourn for me!

HENRY ‘WILLIAM HERBERT, 1807-1859, better known as “ Frank Forester,” son of the Hon.
and Rev. William Herbert, was born in London, and educated at Cambridge. I-Ie emigrated
to America in l8.'31. At first he was a teacher in a classical academy, but he soon betook
himself exclusively to authorship. {erbert was an exceedingly voluminous writer. He
produced a number of novels and novelettes, fugitive poetical pieces, some historical
sketches, translations from the French, and also from ]Eschylus, and a long list of sporting
works upon the game of the United States and British America, besides an immense num-
ber of uncollected contributions to magazines and papers. Herbert has shown himself a
thorough judge of ﬁeld-sports, and a general writer of decided vigor and uncommon versa-
tility.

CHARLES W. WEBBER, 1819—1856, was born at Russelville, Kentucky, son of Dr. Augustus
Vi-lebber. From his mother, who had a talent for drawing and for natural history, and who
often took him as a companion of her artistic excgursions, he imbibed an early--fondness for
the free, out-door life which marked his brief career. After the death of his mother, in his
nineteenth year, he wandered into the Texan frontier, then in an unsettled condition, and
became associated with Col. Jack Hays, Major Chevalier, and other noted Texan rangers.
Several years spent in this wild life furnished him with the materials which he afterwards
worked up into books.

After returning to his home in Kentucky, Mr. V.Vebber became interested in the subject
or. religion, and went to Princeton, New Jersey, to study theology. This purpose, however,
was soon abandoned, and he gravitated to New York as the centre, at that time, of literary
enterprise, and embarked in literature as a profession. He had the usual experiences, alter-
nately rough and gentle, of those who thus adventure, but was gradually winning his way
to an assured position, when he was tempted to join the ill-fated expedition of Capt. William
Walker, in Central America, in the winter of 1855-6, and fell there in one of the chance
encounters that accompanied the enterprise.

Mr. Webber’s writings show much freshness, vigor, and individuality, and leave us to re—
gret that he did not live to achieve something of a greater and more permanent value.

The following are his principal works: Old Hicks the Guide, or Adventures in the
Camanche Country in Search of a Gold Mine; The Gold Mines of Gila, a sequel to “Old
Hicks;” Shot in the Eye, adventures with the Texas Rangers; The Hunter Naturalist, a
Romance of Sporting; Wild Scenes and Song Birds; Texan Virago; Wild Girl of Nebraska;
Tales of the Southern Border; Spiritual V ampirism, a take-off of sundry popular isms.

erates. He published for a time The Memphis Appeal. Mr. Pike is by nature a poet, and
had circumstances led him to a literary life, he would doubtless have made himself a distin-
guished name in letters. His contributions, both prose and verse, are mere incidents in a
life given mainly to action. He published in 1831 Prose Sketches and Poems, written in

Daniel P. Thompson.

DANIEL P. THOMPSON, 17 95——1868, has thrown a glamour over the his-
tory of Vermont by a number of historical novels descriptive of life as it
was in that State two or three generations back.

Mr. Thompson wrote the following works: May Martin, or The Money Diggers, a prize
story; The Green Mountain Boys, a story embodying some of the most interesting traditions
of Vermont ; Locke Amsden, or The Schoolmaster, giving a picture of his own experience
“boarding round;” The Rangers, or The Tory’s Daughter, a story giving a picture of
Vermont in the times of the Revolution. .

Mr. Thompson was born in Charlestown, Massachusetts, His father, not succeeding in
Charlestown, withdrew to a wild farm iii the town of Berlin, Vermont, where the family
lived as pioneers, remote from schools, churches, and books. When Daniel was at the age of
sixteen, a Spring freshet, which brought down upon the ﬂood the wrecks of mills and other
buildings, brought among the ﬂoating timbers a chance volume, thoroughly soaked. The
young pioneer, thirsty for knowledge, seized the prize, carefully dried the leaves, and after-
wards eagerly devoured the contents. It was a volume of poetry, and was his ﬁrst intro-
duction to English literature. It only increased the longing which he already felt to get an
education. By self-denial and thrift as a young farmer, and as a teacher of the district school,
he gradually laid up money to pay his expenses in college, and entering Middlebury, grad-
uated in 1820. After graduation, he taught for some time as private tutor in afamily in
Virginia. After three or four years pleasantly spent in this manner, he returned to Ver-
mont, and opened a law oﬂice in Montpelier. He held several public offices, and was much
respected.

Miss Leslie.

ELIZA LESLIE, 1787-1857, was the sister of Leslie the artist, and was by
birth and social position brought into terms of intimacy with Adams, Jef-
ferson, and the other men of note who lived in the early part of the pres-
ent century. She held a conspicuous rank as a writer, and was particularly
happy as a satirist of social affectations and of pretence and vulgarity of
every kind. Her story of Mrs. Washingtoii Potts is worthy of Dickens.

For further information in regard to Miss Leslie, and as a specimen of her style of writing,
I give below a sketch of her life, written by herself, at my request, in 1851, for my work on
“ The Female Prose Writers of America.”

AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.

I was born in Philadelphia, at the corner of Market and Second Streets, on the 15th of
November, 1787, and was baptized in Christ Church by Bishop White.

Both of my parents were natives of Cecil County, Maryland, also the birthplace of my
grandfathers and grandmothers on each side. My great-grandfather, Robert Leslie, was a
Scotchman. He came to settle in'America about the year 1745 or ’46, and bought a farm on
North-East River, nearly opposite to the insulated hill called Malden’s Mountain. I have
been at the place. My maternal great-grandfather was a Swede named Jansen. So I have
no English blood in me. D

My father was a man of considerable natural genius, and much self-taught knowledge;
particularly in natural philosophy and in mechanics. He was also a good draughtsman,

and a ready writer on scientiﬁc subjects; and in his familiar letters, and in his conversation,
there was evidence of a most entertaining vein of humor, with extraordinary powers of

description. He had an excellent ear for music; and without any regular instruction, he.

played well on the ﬂute and violin. I remember, at this day, many ﬁne Scottish airs that
I have never seen in print, and which my father had learned in his boyhood from his Scot-
tish grandsire, who was a good singer. My mother was a handsome woman, of excellent
sense, very amusing, and a ﬁrst—rate housewife.

Soon after their marriage, my parents removed from Elkton to Philadelphia, where my
father commenced business as a watchmaker. He had great success. Philadelphia was
then the seat of the Federal government; and he soon obtained the custom of the principal
people in the place, including that of Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, the two last becom-
ing his warm personal friends. There is a freemasonry in men of genius which makes
them ﬁnd out each other immediately. It was by Mr. J eﬁerson’s recommendation that my
father was electeda member of the American Philosophical Society. To Dr. Franklin he
suggested an improvement in lightning-rods,—-— gilding the points to prevent them rusting,
— that was immediately, and afterwards universally adopted.

Among my father’s familiar visitors were Robert Patterson, long afterwards President of
the Mint; Charles Wilson Peale, who painted the men of the Revolution, and founded the
noble museum called by his name; John Vaughan, and Matthew Carey.

When I was about ﬁve years old, my father went to England with the intention of engag-
ing in the exportation of clocks and watches to Philadelphia, having recently taken into
partnership Isaac Price, of this city. We arrived in London in June, 1793, after an old-
fashioned voyage of six weeks.‘ ‘We lived in England about six years and a_l1alf, when the
death of my father’s partner in Philadelphia obliged us to return home. An extraordinary
circumstance compelled our ship to go into Lisbon, and detained us there from November
till March; and we did not ﬁnish our voyage and arrive in Philadelphia till May. The win-
ter we spent in our Lisbon lodgings was very uncomfortable, but very amusing.

After we came home, my fatherls health, which had long been precarious, declined rap-
idly; but he lived till 1803. My mother and her ﬁve children (of whom I was theeldest)
were left in circumstances which rendered it necessary that she and myself should make
immediate exertions for the support of those who were yet too young to assist themselves,
as they did afterwards. Our diﬁiculties we kept uncomplainedly to ourselves. We asked
no assistance of our friends, we incurred no debts, and we lived on cheerfully, and with
such moderategenjoyments as our means afforded; believing in the proverb, that “All work
and no play make Jack a dull boy.” L

My two brothers were then, and still are, sources of happiness to the family. But they
both left home at the age of sixteen. Charles, with an extraordinary genius for painting,
went to London to cultivate it. He rapidly rose to the front rank of his profession, and
maintains a high place among the great artists of Europe. He married in England, and
still lives there. ,

My youngest brother, Thomas Jefferson Leslie, having passed through the usual course
of military education, at West Point Academy, was commissioned in the Engineers, and,
with the rank of l\'Iajor, is still attached to the army. My sister, Anna Leslie, resides in
New York. She has several times visited London, where she was instructed in painting by
her brother Charles, and has been very successful in copying pictures. My youngest sister,
Patty, became the wife of Henry 0. Carey, and never in married life was happiness more
perfect than theirs. .

To return now to myself. Fortunate in being gifted with an extraordinary memory, I
was never in childhood much troubled with long lessons to learn, or long exercises to write.
My father thought I could acquire suﬂicient knowledgeifor a child by simply reading “ in
book,” without making any great effort to learn things by heart. And as this is not the
plan usually pursued at schools, I got nearly all my education at home. I had a French
master, and a music master, (both coming to give lessons at the house ;) my father himself

FROM 1830 T() 1850. 199

taught me to write, and overlooked my drawing; and my mother was fully competent to
instruct me in every sort of useful sewing. I went three months to school, merely to learn
ornamental needle-work. All this was in London. We had a governess in the house for
the younger children. ,

My chief delight was in reading and drawing. My ﬁrst attempts of the latter were on
my slate, and I was very happy when my father brought me one day a box of colors and a
drawing-book, and showed me how to use them. _

There was no restriction on my reading, except to prevent me from “ reading my eyes
out.” And, indeed, they have never been very strong. At that time there were very few
books written purposely for children. I believe I obtained all that were then to be found.
But this catalogue being soon exhausted, and my appetite for reading being continually on
the increase, I was fain to supply it with works that were considered beyond the capacity
of early youth — a capacity which is too generally underrated. Children are often kept on
break and milk long after they are able to eat meat and potatoes. I could read at four
years old, and before twelve I was familiar, among a multitude of other books, with Gold-
smith’s admirable Letters on England, and his histories of Rome and Greece (Robinson
Crusoe and the Arabian Nights, of course), and I have gone through the six octavo volumes
of the ﬁrst edition of Cook’s Voyages. « I talked much of Tupia and Omiah, and Otoo and
Terreoboo—Captain Cook I almost adored. Among our visitors in London was a naval
oﬁicer who had sailed with Cook on his last voyage, and had seen him killed at Owhyhee——
I am sorry the name of that island has been changed to the unspellable and unpronounce-
able Hawaii. I was delighted when my father took me to the British lVIuseu1n, to see the
numerous curiosities brought from the South Sea by the great circumnavigator.

The Elegant Extracts made me acquainted with the best passages in the works of all
the British writers who had ﬂourished before the present century. From this book I ﬁrst
learned the beauties of Shakespeare. My chief novels were Miss Burney’s, Mrs. Radcl'iffe’s,
and the Children of the Abbey. 1

Like most authors, I made my ﬁrst attempts in eerse. They were always songs, adapted F

to the popular airs of that time, the close of the last century. The subjects were chieﬂy
soldiers, sailors, hunters, and nuns. I scribbled two or three in the pastoral line, but my
father once pointed out to me a real shepherd, in a ﬁeld somewhere in Kent. I made no
further attempt at Damons and Strephons, playing on lutes and wreathing their brows with
roses. My songs were, of course, foolish enough; but in justice to myself I will say, that
having a good ear, I was never guilty of a false quantity in any of my poetry ——rny lines
never had a syllable too much or too little, and my rhymes always did rhyme. At thirteen
or fourteen, I began to despise my own poetry, and destroyed all I had. I then, for many
years, abandoned the dream of my childhood, the hope of one day seeing my name in print.

It was not till 1827 that I first ventured “ to put out a book,” and a most unparnassian
one it was —- “ Seventy-ﬁve receipts for pastry, cakes, and s'wcetmea-ts.” Truth was, I had
a tolerable collection of receipts, taken by myself while a pupil of Mrs. Goodfellow’s cook-
ing-school, in Philadelphia.‘ I had so many applications from my friends for copies of these
directions, that my brother suggested my getting rid of the inconvenience by giving them
to the public in print. An offer was immediately made to me by Munroe & Francis, of
Boston, to publish them on fair terms. The little volume had much success, and has gone
through many editions. Mr. Francis being urgent that I should try my hand at a work of
imagination, I wrote a series of juvenile stories, which I called The Mirror. It was well
received, and was followed by severalother story-books for youth——’I‘hc Young Ameri-
cans, Stories for Emma, Stories for Adelaide, Atlantic Tales, Stories for Helen, Birthday
Stories. Also, I compiled a little book called The Wonderful Traveller, being an abridg-
ment (with essential alterations) of Munchausen, Gulliver, and Sinbad. In 1831 Munroe &
Francis published my American Girls’ Book, of which an edition is still printed every year.
Many juvenile tales, written by me, are to be found in the annuals called The Pearl and
The Violet.

200 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

I had but recently summoned courage to write ﬁction for grown people, when my story
of Mrs. Washington Potts obtained a prize from ’Mr. Godey, of the Lady’sV Book. Subse-
quently I was allotted three other prizes successively, from different periodicals. I then
withdrew from this sort of competition.

For several years I wrote an article every month for the Lady’s Book, and for a short
time I was a contributor to Graham’s Magazine; and occasionally, I sent, by invitation, a
contribution to the weekly papers. I was also editor of The Gift, an annual published by
Carey & Hart; and of TheViolet, a juvenile souvenir.

My only attempt at anything in the form of a novel, was Amelia, or a Young Lady’s
Vieissitudes, ﬁrst printed in the Lady’s Book, and then in a small volume by itself. Could
I begin anew my literary career, I would always write novels instead of short stories.

Three volumes of my tales were published by Carey & Lea, under the title of Pencil
Sketches. Of these, there will be soon  new edition. In 1838 Lea & Blanchard printed
a volume containing Althed Vernon, or the Embroidered Handkerchief, and Henrietta
Harrison, or The Blue Cotton Umbrella. Several books of my fugitive stories have been
published in pamphlet form, -— the titles being Kitty’s Relations, Leonilla Lynmore, The
Maid of Canal Street (Maz'cZ is a reﬁned and accomplished young lady), and The Dennings
and their Beaux. All my stories are of familiar life, and I have endeavored to render their
illustrations of character and manners as entertaining and instructive as I could; trying
always to “point a moral,” as well as to “ adorn a tale.” _

The works from which I have, as yet, derived the greatest pecuniary advantage, are my
three books on domestic economy.‘ The Domestic Cookery Book, published in 1837, is
now in the forty-ﬁrst edition, no edition having been less than a thousand copies ; and the
sale increases every year. The House Book came out in 1840, and the Lady’s Receipt
Book in 1846. All have been successful and proﬁtable.

My two last stories are J ernigan’s Pa, published in the Saturday Gazette, and The Bay-
mounts, in the Saturday Evening Post.

I am now engaged on a Life of John Fitch, for which I have been several years collecting
information from authentic sources. I hope soon to ﬁnish a work (undertaken by partic-
ular desire) for the beneﬁt of young ladies, and to which I purpose giving the plain simple
title of The Behavior Book.

CHARLES R. LESLIE, 1794-1859, brother of the preceding, was born in London, but of
American parents, and passed the greater part of his life in England. He rose to distinc--
tion as a painter. Besides his works of art, he is also the author of two valuable publica-
tions: Memoirs of John Constable, and A Hand-book for Young Painters, in which latter
he takes occasion to controvert many of Ruskin’s views. Mr. Leslie’s style as an art-critic
is very agreeable.

Mrs. Kirkland.

Mas. CAROLINE M. (STANSBURY) KIRKLAND, 1801-1864, held in her
day a high place among the writers on domestic and social topics. She
was a shrewd observer, and she expressed her observations with singular
clearness and point. Among her works deserving of special commenda-
tion is one called Fireside Talks on Morals and Manners. She wrote also,
under the name of “Mrs. Mary Clavers,” several works descriptive of pio-
neer life in the ‘Vest, in which she gave full play to the sense of humor
with which she was largely gifted.

Mrs. Kirkland was born and bred in the city of New York. After the death of her father,

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 201

Mr. Samuel Stansbury, the family removed to the western part of the State, where she was
married to Mr. William Kirkland, an accomplished scholar, at one time Professor in Ham-
ilton College. After her marriage she resided several years in Geneva, and in 1835 removed
to Michigan; lived two years i11 Detroit, and six months in the woods sixty miles west of
Detroit. In 1813 she returned to New York, where she lived till the time of her death, with
the exception of a visit abroad in 1849, and another in 1850. Mr. Kirkland died in 1846.

Hrs. Kirkland was first prompted to authorship by the strange things which she saw and
heard while living in the backwoods. These things always presented themselves to her
under a humorous aspect, and suggested an attempt at description. The descriptions, given
at ﬁrst in private letters to her friends, proved to be so very amusing that she was tempted
to enlarge the circle of her readers by publication. A New Home ——Who ’l1 Follow?
appeared in 1839 ; Forest Life, in 1842 ; and Western Clearings, in 1846. These all appeared
under‘ the assumed name of “Mrs. Mary Clavers,” and attracted very general attention.
For racy wit, keen observation of life and manners, and a certain air of reﬁnement which
never forsakes her, even in the roughest scenes, these sketches of VVestern life were entirely
without a parallel in American literature. Their success determined in a great measure
Mrs. K_irkland‘s course of life, and she thenceforth became an author by profession.

An Essay on the Life and Writings of Spenser, preﬁxed to an edition of the ﬁrst book
of the Fairy Queen, in 1846, formed her next contribution to the world of letters. The
accomplished author appears in this volume quite as shrewd in her observations, and as
much at home, among the dreamy fantasies of the great idealist, as she had been among the
log cabins of the far West.

In July, 1847, the Z.'m'e72. Magazine was commenced in New York, with Mrs. Kirkland as
sole editor. After eighteen months the magazine was transferred to Philadelphia, its
name changed to .S’(z7't~.zz'n’s lllagazine, and Mrs. Kirkland retained as a monthly contributor.
This engagement she fulﬁlled for a period of two years and a half. Of all the brilliant array
of contributors to that periodical, there was not one whose articles gave such entire and
uniform satisfaction as those of Mrs. Kirkland. These articles were mostly in the form of
essays on familiar topics, sucl1 as Visiting, Conversation, Growing Old Gracefully, etc., and
form really her best claim to a_ permanent place in literature. Among her later volumes
may be named Holidays Abroad ; The Evening Book, or Fireside Talks on Morals and
Manners; A Book for the Home Circle, or Familiar Thoughts on Various Topics, Literary,
Moral, and Social, etc.

CONVERSATION.

Conversation is a pleasure for which all men have a taste; one which is never relinquished

except by compulsion, or some motive almost as potent. The silence of monastic life is the <

highest triumph of asceticism; that of prison existence the utmost cruelty of the law.
The sage loves conversation even better than the child, for the very desire of acquiring

makes him anxious to impart. Joy prattles; grief must talk or die; both are eloquent,‘

for passion is always so. A feeling too strong for words is agony; if they be long withheld
it becomes madness. The chattering of youth is the overﬂow of animal spirits by the
stimulus of new ideas; the garrulity of age seems an effort to excite the fainting animal
spirits, by recalling the ideas which once stimulated them. Letter-writing is an effort at
conversation; so indeed is essay-writing. Let us then have a little talk about talking. Our
object shall be to show that we do not give it a due share of attention, or at least to inquire
whether we do or not. ‘ '

Goethe advises that we shall at least “speak every day a few good words.” Do we concern
ourselves about this when we are making up the day’s account? Did we begin the day with
any resolves about it, as if it were a thing of consequence, or have we maundered on, drop-
ping tinkling words about triﬁes, or evil words like ﬁrebrands, or words of gloom and re-
pining, insulting Providence, or words of hatred, piercing hearts that love us? Each day’s

202 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

talk is surely no triﬂe; we can hardly help sowing the germs of many thoughts in a twelve
hours’ intercourse with our co-ma.tes, in the ordinary duties of life; and allowing our words
a negative value, we rob our friends of all the good and pleasure that we might bestow and
do not.

There are those who have never even entertained the idea that under certain circum-
stances it may become a duty to talk. They talk when they like, andwhen not moved by
inclination, they sit mum, leaving the trouble to others. That it is sometimes a trouble to
talk is very true; the French have a proverbial saying which expresses this: they say of
such an one, that he “ bore the expense” of the conversation.

Two young girls together are said to be like the side—bones of a chicken, “because they al-
ways have a merry thought between them.” And truly the giggling which generally ensues
when a few young ladies get together, would seem to justify the old riddle. It is hard to
say whether what is said on these occasions is conversation or not. To settle the point it
would be necessary to go into an analysis of conversation, which were foreign to our pres-
ent purpose, as well as diﬂicult for want of material, since no one has ever reported what is
said under cover of so much laugh. To count the bubbles on the surface of boiling water
beneath a cloud of steam, were perhaps as easy, and as useful. But every age has it pleas-
ures, and we must not quarrel with this. Sober days do not await our bidding.

Ball-room talk is equally beyond our pale. Its ineifable nothingness deﬁes us. Fortu-
nately, conversation is not the characteristic pleasure of the ball—roon1. The West Indian
lady understood this, who exclaimed impatiently to a friend of ours, who had wearied her
by trying to ﬁnd a subject on which she would open her lips —- “ Cha, cha! I come no here
for chatter, I come here for dance! ” Happy were it if her notion were generally adopted.
The harp and violin discourse more excellent music than can be expected from unhappy
beaux, who, not very well furnished with ideas at the outset, must belabor their beseeching
brains for something to say to ten young ladies in succession, all of different disposition,
character, and education, and probably no better ﬁtted for extempore conversation than
their partners.

The faults and follies of our neighbors and friends afford, perhaps, the most fertile of all
subjects for conversation, when it is at all spontaneous. The study of character is one of
the pleasures of life, but we are not particularly fond of exercising it upon ourselves, or at
least of divulging the results of our practice. As surgeons choose the lifeless body for their
demonstrations, so we try our skill upon the absent, and, as he can neither resist nor reply,
this is very pleasant and advantageous——to the operator, who, not being forced to defend
his positions, may expatiate at will, and having set out with a general theory or proposition,
may easily, by the aid ofa little imagination, make out a consistent view of the whole case.
One inconvenience attending the use of this class of material for conversation, is the danger
that the person dissected may not relish our view of his case as reported to him by some
good-natured friend. His vanity may hinder his appreciating our discernment; he may
mistake for spite or envy or unkindness the keen perception on which we pride ourselves;
he may not be able to consider himself as an abstraction, in which light, of course, we con-
sider him when we demonstrate upon h11n, and we may thus lose his friendship just as we
ﬂattered ourselves we understood him thoroughly.

Then again the habit of discussing character in ordinary conversation is apt to be a little
chilling, all around. It is hardly possible to feel quite at ease and to behave unconstrain-
edly, if we know that as soon as we depart we shall be coolly analyzed for the beneﬁt of
those who remain. We are not quite so conﬁdent of the impartiality and discernment of
others as of our own, and we would rather not feel that every word and action of ours is
being treasured up as material for future sketches of character. So that this style of con-
versation, while it exercises the intellect, is likely to harden the heart, and instead of dif-
fusing an affectionate conﬁdence through social intercourse, will probably end in putting
each individual secretly on the defensive. Some frigid soul devised the maxim, “Live

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 203

always with your friend as if he might one day be your enemy; ” and those must have kin-
dred notions of the spirit of society, who consider the peculiarities and shades of character
of their friends matter for habitual discussion.

There is indeed one way of avoiding the obvious danger of this theme, ——-that of giving
offence to the absent, ——namely, by making our discussion the vehicle of praise only: But
is not this apt to become a little tiresome? In some families most of the conversation with
visitors ——-We can judge of nothing further -— consists in eulogies upon absent members of
the household or connections. Unhappily there is hardly enough disinterested sympathy in
human nature to make this agreeable to persons who have not the advantage of belonging
to these exemplary races. The perfections of those we love are a n1ost fascinating subject
for private contemplation, but they are hardly the topic for entertaining our guests withal.
Nor are the individuals eulogized in all respects gainers by this enthusiastic enumeration
of their excellencies. Being human, they have probably still some remains of human im-
perfection, and these will be very apt to come up in full size before the memory or imagina-
tion of the listener, who is driven to seek a refuge for his self-love from the painful contrast
suggested by so much virtue. On the whole, then, we conclude that personal discussion,
even in this honeyed phase, is not very advantageous to the main end of conversation, as a
sweetener of the soul and a cultivator of the social affections.

Touchy people are to be dreaded in conversation. Their propensity is to ﬁnd out, in the
discourse of those about them, points of offence wholly impalpable to all but themselves, by
a power like that of a magnet, which will cover itself with particles of steel where no other
afﬁnity could detect their presence. Woe to the good-natured, unsuspicious sayer of noth-
ings, in such company. It will be hard to convince him that terrible insinuations have
been discovered by unwrapping his gentlest meanings. Does he speak of somebody’s kind-
ness to the poor? Mrs. Sensitive is suddenly beclouded, for she remembers (what he does
not) that she has just been inveighing against indiscriminate charity. Does he wish for
rain? It is because he ‘knows Mrs. Sensitive is depending upon fair weather for a party of
pleasure. Does he express indignation at some instance of dishonesty? Why need he go
out of his way to bring to mind the defalcation of Mrs. Sensitive’s cousin twenty years ago?
If he venture upon any subject of interest, he is sure to touch upon a tender spot; if he
carefully adhere to generalities, he is reserving his better things until he has more agree-
able company. It is astonishing to hear with what bitterness some people will dwell upon
these constructive offences ———crimes made by the law, as it were. A disposition of this sort
is a fatal bar to the ﬂow of conversation. Our ordinary ideas will not endure such sifting
and weighing. By the time We have turned a thought round and round, to be sure that it
has no ridge or corner of offence, whatever point it had is sure to have been worn off. We
must leave the touchy person out of our select conversational circle, and we do it with the
less regret, because he is almost sure to be found deﬁcient in other requisites for compan-
ionship besides good-humor. Intelligence, cultivation, and acquaintance with society are
sure antidotes of touchiness, which is only one phase of egotism.

Mrs. Lydia Maria Child.

MRS. LYDIA l‘./IARIA CHILD, 1802 , has been for nearly fifty years
one of our leadingliterary celebrities. She has Written chieﬂy on social
topics, dividing her attention between the instruction of the young and
the discussion of the vexed question of domestic slavery.

Mrs. Child was the daughter of Convers Francis, and was born at Medford, Mass. She was
sister of Rev. Convers Francis, D. D., Professor in Harvard University. She was educated
chieﬂy in the public schools of her native town, and afterwards taught a private school in

204 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Watertown, Mass., where she was the friend and fellow-student of Margaret Fuller. In 1828
she was married to David Lee Child, a lawyer of Boston.. Both survive, without children,
and reside at Wayland, Mass.

The beginning of her authorship was in this wise: She had been residing several years
in M_aine, remote from all literary associations, but was now on a visit to her brother, Rev.
Convers Francis, minister of the Unitarian church in Watertown. “One Sunday noon, soon
after her arrival there, she took up a number of The North American Review, and read Dr.
Palfrey’s article on Yamoyden, in which he eloquently describes the adaptation of early
New England history to the purposes of ﬁction. She had never written a word for the
press,—never dreamed of turning author,—but the spell was on her, and seizing a pen,
before the bell rang for the afternoon meeting, she had composed the first chapter of the
novel [Hobomok], just as it is printed. When it was shown to her brother, her young am-
bition was ﬂattered by the exclamation: ‘But, Maria, did you really write this? Do you
mean what you say, that it is entirely your own?’ The excellent Doctor little knew the
effect of his words. Her fate was ﬁxed: in six weeks, Hobomol; was ﬁnishec .”—G7'isw0ld.

From that time, 1824, now nearly ﬁfty years, Mrs. Child has been known to the public as
one of our leading and most acceptable _writers. Her publications have been numerous,
and have been marked with great beauty and power. A desire to instruct and to inculcate
truth is a prominent feature in her writings. She has accordingly written much for the
young, and she began in 1827 The Juvenile Miscellany, the ﬁrst monthly periodical for chil-
dren issued in the United States. Another feature of her writings is her happy talent for
observation, by which she is enabled to clothe the common every-day occurrences with
interest.

Among her works may be named the following: llobomok, a Tale of Early Times; The
Rebels, a Tale of the Revolution; Philothea, a Romance of Greece in the Days of Pericles;
A I*Iisto1'y of the Condition of Women of All Ages and Nations; The Mother’s Book; The
Girl’s Book; The American Frugal Housewife; Biographies of Good VVives; The Family
Nurse; The Coronal ; Appeal in favor of that class of Americans called Africans; Pieces i11
Prose and Verse; Flowers for Children; Fact and Fiction; Memoirs of Madame De Stael

‘and Madame Roland; Isaac Hopper, a True Life; Letters from New York; Progress of Re-

ligious Ideas through the Ages; Autumnal Leaves; Looking towards Sunset; A Romance
of the Republic. In 1841, Mr. and Mrs. Child assumed the editorship of The Anti-Slavery
Standard, and after that time the subject of slavery engrossed a large share of her attention.

“Mrs. Child has a large acquaintance with common life, which she describes with a genial
sympathy and ﬁdelity, a generous love of freedom, extreme susceptibility of impressions of
beauty, and an imagination which bodies forth her feelings in forms of peculiar distinctness
and freshness.” -— Griswold. A I

A STREET SCENE.

The other day I was coming down Broome Street. I saw a street musician, playing near
the door of a genteel dwelling. The organ was uncommonly sweet and mellow in its tones,
the tunes were slow and plaintive, and I fancied that I saw in the woman’s Italian face an
expression that indicated suﬂicient reﬁnement to prefer the tender and melancholy, to the
lively “ trainer tunes ” in vogue with the populace. She looked like one who had suﬁered
much, and the sorrowful music seemed her own appropriate voice. A little girl clung to
her scanty garments, as if afraid of all things but her mother. As I looked at them, a young
lady of pleasing countenance opened the window, and began to sing like a bird, in keeping
with the street organ. Two other young girls came and leaned on her shoulder; and still
she sang on. Blessings on her‘ gentle heart! It was evidently the spontaneous gush of
human love and sympathy. The beauty of the incident attracted attention. A group of
gentlemen gradually collected round the organist: and even as the tune ended, they bowed
respectfully towards the window, waving their hats, and calling out, “ More, if you please I ”

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 205

One, whom I knew well for the kindest and truest soul, passed round his hat; hearts were
kindled, and the silver fell in freely. In a minute, four or ﬁve dollars were collected for
the poor woman. She spoke no word of gratitude, but she gave such a look! “ Will you go
to the next street, and play to a friend of mine? ” said my kind-hearted friend. She an-
swered, in tones expressing the deepest emotion, “ No, sir, God bless you all —God bless you
all,” (making a curtsey to t.he young lady, who had stept back, and stood sheltered by the
curtain of the window,) “I will play no more today; I will go home now.” The tears
trickled down her cheeks, and as she walked away, she ever and anon wiped her eyes
with the corner of her shawl. The group of gentlemen lingered a moment to look afterher,
then turning towards the now closed window, they gave three enthusiast_ic cheers, and de-
parted, better than they came. The pavement O11_WlllCl1 they stood had been a church to
them; and for the next hour, at least, their hearts were more than usually prepared for
deeds of gentleness and mercy. Why are such scenes so uncommon? Why do we thus
repress our sympathies and chill the genial current of nature, by formal observances and
restraints. I

UNSELFISHNESS.

I found the Battery unoccupied, save by children, whom the weather made as merry as
birds. Everything seemed moving to the vernal tune of

“Brignal banks are fresh and fair,
And Greta woods are green.”

To one who was chasing her hoop, I said, smiling, “You are a nice little girl.” She
stopped, looked up in my face, so rosy and happy, and laying her hand on her brother’s
shoulder, exclaimed earnestly, “and he is a nice little boy, too! ” It was a simple, child-
like act, but it brought -a warm gush into my heart. Blessings on all unselﬁshness I on all
that leads us in love to prefer one another. Here lies the secret of universal harmony; this
is the diapason, which would bring us all into tune. Only by losing ourselves can we ﬁnd
ourselves. How clearly does the divine voice within us proclaim this, by the hymn of joy
it sings, whenever we witness an unselﬁsh deed, or hear an unselﬁsh thought. Blessings
on that loving little one! She made the city seem a garden to me. I kissed my hand to
her, as I turned off in quest of the Brooklyn ferry. The sparkling waters swarmed with
boats, some of which had taken a big ship by the hand, and were leading her out to sea, as
the prattle of childhood often guides wisdom into the deepest and broadest thought.

Mrs. Emily Judson—~—“ Fanny Forrester.”

MRS. EMILY JUDSON, 1817-1854, became _Widely known, ﬁrst by her
contributions to polite literature, under the familiar name of “Fanny
Forrester,” and then by her self-denying labors as the Wife of the veteran
missionary, Adoniram Judson.

Mrs. Judson’s maiden name was Emily Chubbuck. She was born in the pleasant town
of Morrisville, in the central part of New York. This is the “Alderbrook ” so familiar to
her readers. - From Morrisville she went to Utica, to engage in teaching. While living at
Utica, she made her ﬁrst essays at authorship. These consisted of some small volumes of
a religious character published by the Baptist Publication Society, and poetical contribu~
tions to the Knickerbocker. None of these, however, attracted any special attention.

The ﬁrst production of her pen that was a.t all noticeable was a light article which, without
any very deﬁnite design, she wrote under the assumed name of “Fanny Forrester,” to the
“New York Mirror,”—while on a visit to the city of New York. This was in June, 1844.
The editor had the sagacity in this, as in several other instances, to perceive at once the

evidences of genius that appeared in this playful bagatelle, and by a warm and judicious
commendation, led the author to a continued, and, in the end, most successful exploration
of the vein thus accidentally brought to light. A series of essays, sketches, and poems fol~
lowed, of a brilliant character, which in 1846 were collected and published in two volumes
under the title of Alderbrook.

In the beginning of 1846, the memorable missionary Judson returned to America, to visit
the churches. On coming to Philadelphia, he was directed to Miss Chubbuck as a suitable
person to prepare a memoir of his lately deceased wife, the second Hrs. Judson. Miss Chub-
buck, then resident in Philadelphia, cheerfully undertook the grateful task. Being thus
thrown much together, a mutual affection sprang up between them, and the favored child
of literature joyfully laid aside the laurels then fresh upon her brow, to go, as the wife of
Dr. Judson, on a self-denying mission to the Burmans. They were married at Hamilton,
N. ‘Y., J11ne 2, 1846, and soon after sailed for Burmah. The Memoir was published in
1848. Dr. Judson died at Maulmain, in Burinah, in 1850. Soon after the death of her hus—
band, Mrs. Judson returned to the United States. Her health soon began to decline, and
on the ﬁrst of June, 1854, after a lingering illness, she died at the residence of her brother,
at Hamilton, Madison County, N. Y.

Mrs. Judson’s publications were Alderbrook, a collection of Fanny Forrester’s Sketches
and Poems; A Biographical Sketch of Mrs. Sarah C. Judson; An Olio of Domestic Verses;
How to be Great, Good, and Happy, a volume designed for children; My Two Sisters, a

‘ Sketch from Memory.

The poem quoted below gives a touching page from her missionary life.

WATCHING.
Sleep, love, sleep!
The (lusty day is done.
Lo! from afar the freshening breezes sweep,
VVild over groves of balm,
Down from the towering palm,
In at the open casement cooling run,
And round thy lowly bed,
Thy bed of pain,
Bathing thy patient head,
Like grateful showers of rain,
They come;
While the white curtains, wavering to and fro,
Fan the sick air;
And pityingly the shadows come and go,
VVith gentle human care,
Compassionate and dumb.

The dusty day is done,

The night begun;

While prayerful watch I keep.

Sleep, love, sleep!

Is there no magic in the touch

Of ﬁngers thou dost love so much?

Fain would they scatter poppies o’er thee now;
Or, with a soft caress,

The tremulous Zip its own nepenthe press
Upon the weary lid and aching brow,
VVl1ile prayerful watch I keep --

Sleep, love, sleep!

On the pagoda spire

The bells are swinging,

Their little golden circles in a ﬂutter

With tales the wooing winds have dared to utter,
Till all are singing

As if a choir

Of golden-nested birds in heaven were singing;
And with a lulling sound

The music ﬂoats around,

And drops like balm into the drowsy ear;
Commingling with the hum

Of the Sepoy’s distant drum,

And lazy beetle ever droning near,

Sounds these of deepest silence born,

Like night made visible by morn;

So silent, that I sometimes start

To hear the throbbings of my heart,

And Watch, with shivering sense of pain,

To see thy pale lids lift again.

The lizard, with his mouse-like eyes,

Peeps from the mortise in surprise

At such strange quiet of the day’s harsh din-.
Then ventures boldly out,

And looks about,

Andwith his hollow feet,

Treads his small evening heat,

Dartingi upon his prey

In such a tricksy, Winsome sort of Way,
His delicate marauding seems no sin.

And still the curtains swing,

But noiselessly; _

The bells a melancholy murmur ring,

As tears were in the sky;

More heavily the shadows fall,

Like the black foldings of a pall,

Where juts the rough beam from the Wall;
The candles ﬂare

VVith fresher gusts of air;

The bectle’s drone

Turns to a dirge-like solitary moan;

Night deepens, and I sit, in cheerful doubt, alone.

Mrs. Alice  Haven.

"MRS. ALICE B. HAVEN, 1828-1863, was at the time of her death one of
the most promising young authors in the ﬁeld of American letters. Several
of her small Volumes, Written under the name of “Cousin Alice,” form a
part of our standard literature for the young.

Mrs. Haven was born in the city of Hudson, N. Y. Her maiden name was Emily Bradly.
While a girl at school, she sent a contribution, under the assumed name of Alice G. Lee,

208 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

to Joseph 0. Neal of Philadelphia, for publication in his paper, The Saturday Gazette. Mr.
Neal was then in the prime of his days, and one of the acknowledged arbiters of taste in
literature. The successive pieces of his new contributor pleased his fancy, and led to a con-
siderable correspondence. Finding out, at length, her real name, he niade her an offer of
marriage, which was accepted. She became a resident of Philadelphia, and her literary
history thenceforward is connected with her life in that city.

At the request of Mr. Neal, his wife retained the name of “Alice,” by which he had ﬁrst
known her.

In July, 1847, only a few months after her marriage, she was left a widow by the sudden
death of Mr. Neal.- In 1853, she was married to Mr. Joshua L. Haven. She died in 1863,
leaving a family of ﬁve children.

Mrs. Haven had a ﬁne fancy, a delicate perception of the beautiful i11 character or con-
duct, and a rare gift for embodying herconceptions in attractive form. She was particularly
successful as a writer for the young, and her efforts in that line, under the name of“ Cousin
Alice,” are Worthy of a permanent place in literature.

The following is a list of her principal works: Helen Morton; No Such Word as Fail;
Patient Waiting N 0 Loss; Contentment Better -than Wealth; All ’s Not Gold that Glitters;
The Gossip of Rivertown, &c.

Mrs. Caroline Lee Hentz.

MRS. CAROLINE  HENTZ, 1804-1856, contributed largely by her pen
to the amusement and instruction of the last generation. The two best
known of her numerous productions were The Mob Cap, and Aunt Patty’s
Scrap Bag.

Mrs. Hentz was a native of Lancaster, Massachusetts, a daughter of Gen. John Whiting,
and a sister of Gen. Henry Whiting, United States Army. She was married in 1825 to Mr.
-N. M. Hentz, a French gentleman of varied talents, who was then associated with Mr. Ban-
croft, the historian, in the management of a boys’ school at Northampton, Massachusetts.
Mr. Hentz afterwards became Professor in the college at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where
they resided for several years. They lived subsequently in various Southern States, but
chieﬂy in Georgia and Florida, and were engaged in teaching. ’

Mrs. Hentz, besides her labors in the school—room, was an industrious writer, as is shown

' by the long list of her published works. Her ﬁrst publication was the tragedy of De Lara,

or The Moorish Bride, for which she received the competitive prize of $500. The following
are her other principal works : The Western Wild, a Tragedy; Constance of Weiden berg, a
Tragedy; Aunt Patty’s Scrap Bag; The Mob Cap; Linda, or the Young Pilot of the Belle
Creole ; Rena, or the Snow Bird; Marcus Warland, or The Long Moss Spring; The Planter’s
Northern Bride, etc., etc. Her novelettes were very popular. It is said that 93,000 volumes
of her stories were sold in three years.

MRS. EMMA C. EMBURY, 1806-1863, was the daughter oi‘ James R. Manly, M. D., of New
York, and the wife of Mr. Daniel Embury, banker, of Brooklyn. She began at an early age
to write for the periodicals, chieﬂy for the New York Mirror, her contributions appearing
under the name of Ianthe. Although she never devoted herself to a literary life, she wrote
much for publication, in the shape of tales, sketches, and poems, and her pieces were re-
ceived with much favor. Many of her ‘ articles appeared afterwards in collected form.
Among them may be named the following: Guide, and Other Poems; Blind Girl, and Other
Tales; Glimpses of Ilonie Life; Pictures of Early Life; Love’s Token Flowers. Her latest

“If Mrs. Embury never rises so high as some of our female writers sometim es do, no one,
on the other hand, who has written so much, approaches her in the ability of writing uni-
formly well. She seems to have the faculty of never being dull. There is, too, a certain
gentle amenity of thought and diction that never forsakes her, taking from the edge of
what might otherwise be harsh, and giving a charm to what might be commonplace. If her
Stories are not deeply tragical or thrilling, they are always beautiful, they always please,
they always leave the mind instructed and the heart better.” ——FeInale Prose W'9'z‘2fers.

III. HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY.
Washington Irving.

WASIIINGTON IRVING, LL.D., 1783-1859, is on the Whole the brightest
and the dearest name in the annals of American literature. He is almost
equally known as a historian, and as a writer of tales and sketches, and in
both departments he stands clearly in the ﬁrst class.

Irving was a native of New York city. He studied law, and was ad-

FROM 1880 TO 1850. 211

mitted to the bar, but abandoned the profession and engaged with his
brothers in commercial business.

Irving’s first publications of note were his contributions to Salmagundi,
a semi-monthly sustained by himself, his brother ‘William, and James K.
Paulding. In 1809 appeared Diedrich Knickerbocker’s History of New
York, the sketch of the first part of which was in part the Work of his
brother Peter.

In 1819, Irving, then in England, was led to take up literature as a pro-
fession by the failure of the commercial ﬁrm in which he and his brothers
were partners. The result was the appearance of The Sketch Book, soon
followed by Bracebridge Hall, and Tales of a Traveller.

In 1826, at the request of Alexander H. Everett, then United States
Minister to Spain, Irving went to that country and remained there until
1829. During his stay in Spain he published The Life of Columbus, and
The Chronicle of the Conquest of Granada. In 1829 he returned to Lon-
don as Secretary of the United States Legation, and soon afterwards pub-
lished The Voyages of the Companions of Columbus, and The Alhambra.

In 1832 Irving returned to America after an absence of seventeen years,
and was welcomed with an ovation such as none of his predecessors had re-
ceived. In 1839 appeared the Legends of the Conquest of Spain; in 1849,
Mahomet and his Successors. His subsequent productions are nearly all
upon subjects connected with America: Astoria, 1886 ; Wolfert’s Roost,
18.55 ; Life of Goldsmith; Life of Wasliington, 1855-9.

From 1842 to 1846, Irving was United States Minister at Madrid. The
remainder of his life was passed in quiet retirement at his residence, Sun-
nyside, near Tarrytown, on the Hudson.

Irving’s character as a man and a writer is too well known to call for
any but the briefest notice. As a man his geniality of disposition l1as be-
come proverbial. Probably no other American ever met with such a hearty
welcome abraad from men of all classesand nationalities. During the
twenty odd years that he passed in Europe, he had for his Warm friends
such men as Scott, Moore, Campbell, Byron, in fact nearly all the leading
literary characters of the day. In his own country he was no less the idol
of his times. .

As a writer, Irving may be safely pronounced to be the most popular
of all American authors.‘ His works are known and read by every one. Died-
rich Knickerbocker, Sleepy Hollow, Dolf I-Ieyliger, Ichabod Crane, Rip Van
Winkle, have become household names and forms. No other creations of
the imagination have taken such prominence in American literature. They
are not so grand or so subtle as Hawthorne’ s, but they are more life—like,
more genial, more generally comprehended. Irving as a historian is sub-
ject to one grave criticism. He is too diffuse in his treatment of the sub-

212 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

ject, and his style is at times altogether too ﬂorid. The descriptions of
scenery and incidents are too highly colored for the sober pages of history.
Taken all in all, however, he is still, as already said, the brightest and

the dearest name in the annals of American literature.

A uniform edition of Irving’s works has been published, in 15 vols. To these should be
added A Memoir of Irving, with his Letters, in 5 vols., by his nephew, Pierre M. Irving.

Jared Sparks.

JARED SPARKS, LL. D., 17 94-1866, is justly considered one of the most
eminent contributors to American history. His labors were partly edito-
rial, and partly those of original authorship, and in both respects he is en-
titled to a high rank. He is chieﬂy known by his American Biography
and his editions of the works of VVashington and Franklin.

Mr. Sparks was a native of Connecticut. He was educated at Harvard, both in the colle-
giate departmentand the divinity school, and was ordained a clergyman in the Unitarian
church. In 1821 he was Chaplain to the House of Representatives. He was editor of the
North American Review from 1823 to 1830, Professor of History at Harvard from 1838 to
1849, and President of the University from 1849 to 1853. At the time of his death (1866) he
had in preparation a History of the American Revolution. A

Sparks’s principal publications are the following : American Biography, 25 vols., 12mo (the
Lives of Ethan Allen, Arnold, Marquette, De la Salle, Pulaski, Ribault, Charles Lee, and Led-
yard, by Sparks himself, the others written by various parties at his solicitation and edited
by him); Life and Writings of Washington, 12 vols., 8vo.; Life and Writings of Franklin, 10
vols.; Life of Governeur Morris, 3 vols.; Diplomatic Correspondence of the Revolution, 12
vols. (published under the authority of Congress); Correspondence of the American Revo-
lution, 4 vo1s.; Essays and Tracts in Theology, 6 vols.

The faithfulness and accuracy with which Mr. Sparks’s historical works were carried out
have made his name famous in Europe as well as in his native country. His Washington
alone cost him nine years of labor, including researches in the archives of London and
Paris, and a personal examination of the Revolutionary State Papers of the United States
and of the original thirteen States. Nor was he amere collector and collator. Although 11ot
aiming at the high art of the classical historian, like Bancroft and Prescott, he has an hon-
ored place among those who have written upon American history. His merits as an author
would probably stand out in higher relief were they not to some extent overtopped by his
still greater merits as a dispassionate, laborious, and judicious investigator.

THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

The acts of the Revolution derive dignity and interest from the character of the actors,
and the nature and magnitude of the events. It has been remarked, that in all great politi-
cal revolutions, men have arisen, possessed of extraordinary endowments, adequate to the
exigency of the time. It is true enough, that such revolutions, or any remarkable and con-
tinued exertionsof human power, must be brought to pass by corresponding qualities in the
agents ; but whether the occasion makes the men, or the men the occasion, may not always
be ascertained with exactness. In either case, however, no period has been adorned with
examples more illustrious, or more perfectly adapted to the high destiny awaiting them,
than that of the American Revolution. -

John G. Palfrey.

’ JOHN GORHAM PALFREY, D. D., LL. D., 1796 , is the author of
various works, chief among which is, A History of New England under
the Stuart Dynasty.

Dr. Palfrey is a native of Boston, and a graduate of Harvard. He was for many years
pastor of a church in Boston, and Professor in the Divinity School of Harvard. Since his
resignation, in 1839, he has taken an active part in state and national politics, holding

North American Review, and contributed many valuable articles. He has published a large
number of sermons and addresses. He has published in book-form, Lectures on the Jewish
Scriptures, and Lectures on the Evidences of Christianity. He is chieﬂy known, however,
by the work ﬁrst named, Tl1e History of New England under the Stuart Dynasty, in 3 vols.,
Svo. This is a valuable contribution to American history, and is exhaustive of the ground
that it covers. His articles in the North American Review are considered among the best
that have appeared in that periodical. ‘

MISS SARAH H. PALFREY, —— ——-, daughter of the preceding, has published several
interesting volumes, under the assumed name ofE. Fonton. These are, Prémices, a volume
of poems; Herman, or Young Knighthood: Agnes Wentworth; Sir Pavon and St. Pavon;
and a story of some length in the Atlantic Monthly, called Katharine Morne, or First Love
and Best.

REV. CONVERS FRANCIS, D.D., 1796-1863, was a native of West Cambridge, Mass., and a

. graduate of Harvard, of the class of 1815. He was Parkman Professor of Pulpit Eloquence

in Harvard from 1843 to 1863. His chief publications are the following: Errors of Educa-
tion; Dudlean Lectures at Cambridge; Historical Sketch of VVatertown; Discourse at Ply-

. mouth; Life of John Eliot, the Apostle to the Indians; Memoirs of John Allyn; Gamaliel

Bradford, and Judge Davis.

Dr’. John W. Francis.

JOHN w. FRANCIS, M. 1)., LL. 1)., 1789-1861, was 8. native of New
York city, and for more than half a century one of its most distinguished
ornaments. C

Dr. Francis was a leading Professor, ﬁrst in the College of Physicians and Surgeons of that
city, and afterwards in the Rutgers Medical College. As the colleague and equal of such
men as Mott and Hosack, his position made him one of the celebrities of the city. Besides his
professional eminence, he was a man of general culture, and his Discourses on various occa-
sions were noteworthy specimens of literary taste and ﬁnish. Besides these, and numerous
biographical sketches published in the public journals, he wrote an entertaining volume of
historical recollections: Old New York, or Reminiscences of the Past Sixty Years. His
medical writings were numerous and are in high estimation.

CALEB SPRAGUE HENRY, D.D., 1804 ,was born at Rutland, Mass. He graduated at
Dartmouth in 1825, and studied theology in New Haven. He was appointed Professor of
Intellectual Philosophy in Bristol College, Penn., in 1835, and moved to New York in 1837

Review and to the periodicals, and has also translated from the French Cousin’s Critique on
Locke, Guizot’s General History of Civilization, and an Epitome of the Philosophy of His-
tory, and was associated. with Dr. Taylor in the preparation of A Manual of Ancient and
Modern History. He removed to Poughkeepsie in 1857, and afterwards was rector of an
Episcopal church in Newburgh. IIis latest publications are a volume of essays, and a work
published anonymously in 1860, called Dr. Oldham at Graystones, and his Talk there.

William L. Stone.

CoL. WILLIAM LEETE STONE, 1793-1844, for a long time one of the
most conspicuous journalists in the United States, made several Valuable
contributions to the colonial history of New York, particularly that relating
to the border wars between the whites and the Indians. His chief works
in this line were A Life of Sir William Johnson, A Life of Joseph Brandt,
A Life of Red Jacket, and The Poetry and History of Wyoming.

Col. Stone was born at New Paltz, N. Y. He began ﬁrst as a printer, and then, at the age
of seventeen, as a contributor, for a country newspaper. He edited various political papers,
from 1813 to 1821, in Hudson, Albany, and Ilartford, but from 1821 to 18H he was editor and
proprietor of the New York Commercial Advertiser, and in that paper he did the chief work
of his life.

Besides his labors as a journalist, Colonel Stone bestowed a good deal of time upon the

study and elucidation of local colonial history, and the several works which he published 011
this subject are of great value as repositories of many now extinct traditions of Indian and
border warfare. His other works, also, like those on the impostures of Matthias and Maria
Monk, and similar temporary excitements, are more valuable now than at the time when
they were written, for the reason that to the present generation these Works are almost the
only accessible sources of information on the subjects named.

Works: Life of Joseph Brandt, including the Border Wars of the American Revolution,
2 vols , 8V0; Life and Times of Red Jacket, being a Sequel to the History of the Six Nations;
A Life of Sir William Johnson, 2 vols., 8vo, completed by the author’s son, W. L. Stone, Jr,;

lished the ﬁrst number of his famous Merchants’ Magazine, destined to'have a great and
permanent success. In 1856-7, appeared The Lives of American Merchants. Both the

FROM 1830 TO 1850.   215

published, in 1837, a Life of Burr, 2 vols., 8vo; and afterwards, The Private Journal of

GRANT THORBURN, 1773-1863, was famous as a seedsman in New York city. He was born

I in Dalkeith, Scotland, and emigrated to New York in 1794. He was a man of marked pecu-

liarities, and not addicted to hiding his light under a bushel. He ﬁrst gained notoriety
as the hero of Galt’s novel, Laurie Todd. Thorburn could sow words as well as seeds, and
wrote several books worthy of remembrance. The most thoroughly characteristic was his
autobiography, en titled, Forty Years’ Residence in America, or The Doctrine of a Particular
Providence Exempliﬁed in the Life of Grant Thorburn, Seedsman, written by Himself.
Some of his other publications are Life and Writings of Grant Thorburn, prepared by Him-
self; Fifty Years’ Reminiscences of New York, or Flowers from the Garden of Laurie Todd;

Charles J. Ingersoll.

CHARLES JARED 1NeERsoLL, 1782-1862, wrote much on historical and
political subjects, his chief work being. A History of the ‘War of 1812-15,
between Great Britain and the United States, in 4 volumes. ‘

Mr. Ingersoll was a native and resident of Philadelphia, where for half a century he was
a man of mark as a political leader. He was by profession a lawyer, but gave considerable
attention to literature. His chiefpublications are the following: Chiomara, a Poem; Edwy
and Elgiva, a Tragedy, acted at the Chestnut Street Theatre; The Rights and Wrongs, Power
and Policy of the United States; History of the 'War of 1812-15, between Great Britain and
the United States, 4 vols.; and a large number of political and other pamphlets. To Mr.
Ingersoll is conceded, on all sides, intellectual ability of no common order. But the force
of what he had to say was sadly weakened by his vicious style of writing, or rather by his
utter neglect and contempt of style. “The quotations that we have made suggest a con-
cluding remark as to Mr. Ingersoll’s style. It is a rough, energetic style, not deﬁcient in
happy and vivid expressions; but we have rarely met with American writing more con-
temptuous not only of English rules, but of the reader’s respiratory convenience—the book
is hard to read because of the uncouthness of its forms.” —— London Atlzezzamn.

HENRY D. GILPIN, 1801-1860, was a lawyer of Philadelphia. He ranked high in his profes-
sion, and was the author of several valuable law works. He found time also to cultivate
literature. Among his services in this line it may be mentioned that he wrote a considerable
number of the Biographies of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence; he edited The
Madison Papers, published by authority of Congress ; he contributed to the American Quar-
terly Review, North American Review, and Democratic Review; and he edited for several
years, 1826-32, the ﬁrst literary annual published in America, the Atlantic Souvenir, writing
numerous articles for it.

RICHARD STOCKTON 1<'isLD, LL. D., 1803-1870, was a native of Whitehill, N. J. He was edu-
cated at Princeton, and resided there all the latter part of his life. He was a lawyer, and
rose to eminence at the bar; he was for a short time a Senator of the United States, and was
Judge of the United States District Court of New Jersey. He took an active part in advo-
cating and organizing a system of common schools for the State, and was President of the
Trustees of the State Normal School from its organiwation, in 1855, to the time of his death.
He published: The Provincial Courts of New Jersey; Contributions to the Collections of the
N ew Jersey Historical Society; and numerous valuable Addresses and Orations.

College. He studied law with Mr. Jefferson. He took a conspicuous part in national poli-
ties, as well as those of his own State; was for a long time a Member of Congress, both in

the House of Representatives and in the Senate, and was twice sent as American Ambassador ,

to France. He was a member of the “Peace Congress” of 1801, and, after the secession of

liberal culture, and possessed t.he ability to have distinguished himself in the field of letters,
if affairs of State had not called him elsewhere. He wrote The Life and Character of John
Hampden;'.The Life and Times of James Madison; Discourse on the Uses and Importance
of History; Ethics of Christianity; On Agriculture, &c.

Mrs. Rives, wife of the preceding, Was an author of considerable merit. She wrote Tales
and Souvenirs of a Residence in Europe; Home and the World; The Canary Bird; Epitome
of the Holy Bible.

SAMUEL M. JANNEY, 1801 ———, is a native of London County, Va. He is a member and
preacher of the Society of Friends, and besides preaching has given his attention a good deal
to literature. He was appointed by President Grant in 1869 one of the superintendents of
Indian affairs. He has written The Country School—House, a Poem; The Last of the Lenape
and Other Poems; Conversations on Religious Subjects; A Teacher’s Gift; Historical Sketch
of the Christian Church during the Middle Ages; Life of William Penn; Life of George Fox;

C and a History of the Religious Society of Friends, from its Rise to the year 1828, 4 vols., 8vo.

This is his latest and most matured work, and is one of original research, constituting his
chief claim to a permanent place in literature.

ALEXANDER SLIDELL MACKENZIE, 1803-1848, was a native of New York, and a son of John
Slidell. In 1837, by act of legislature, Alexander added his mother’s family name, MacKenzie,

of which are: A Year in Spain, which attracted much attention at the time of its appear-
ance, and was Warmly praised by VVashington Irving; the Life of John Paul Jones; the Life
of Commodore Decatur; and the Life of Commodore Perry. Ile assisted VVashin gton Irving
in the latter’s Life of Columbus, by examining Co1umbus’s route, and contributing other
nautical information. MacKenzie's biographical works are able,,and the one on Commodore
Perry has a decided historical value in settling the question of Perry’S claims to the chief
honors of the naval victory on Lake Erie.

JOHN C. FREMONT, 1813 , was born in Savannah, Ga. He distinguished himself by his
explorations in the extreme Western regions of the United States, and he is familiarly known

 

' as “ The Pathﬁnder of the Rocky Mountains.” His Harrative of the Exploring Expedition

to the Rocky Mountains, and to Oregon and North California, was published in various
forms ; and constitutes an important part of the literature of scientiﬁc exploration under-
taken by the United States Government. '

CART. SETH EASTMAN, U. S. A., 1808 —, is a native of Brunswick, Me. He graduated at
‘fest Point in ‘1829. He was stationed at Fort Snelling and other places on the north~west—
ern frontier, and came much into contact with Indian life and scenery. He made the Illus-

C trations for the work published by Congress, on The History, Condition, and Future Prospects

of the Indian Tribes.

MRS. MARY (HENDERSON) EASTMAN, 1818 , is a native of Warrington, Va. She is a
daughter of Dr. Thomas Henderson, and the wife of Captain S. Eastman, both of the U. S. A.
She accompanied her husband in his various services at Fort Snelling and other frontier sta-
tions, and thus had the opportunities of studying the Indian character and customs, which

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 217

she has employed to much advantage in her works. These are the following: Dacotah, or

Life and Legends of the Sioux; Romance of Indian Life; American Aboriginal Portfolio,

with illustrations by Captain Eastman; Chicora, and other Regions of the Conquerors and
the Conquered; Aunt Phillis’s Cabin, 3; novel, intended as a reply to Uncle Tom’s Cabin, by
Mrs. Stowe. Of all the portraitures of Indian life and character that have been given to
the public, none, probably, have come more nearly to‘ the truth than those by Mrs.
Eastman. —

 

LORENZO SABINE, 1803 , a native of Lisbon, N. H., and a Member of Congress from Mas-
sachusetts, has made some valuable contributions.to historical literature: The American

CHARLES E. ARTHUR GAYARRIE, 1805 , an eminent lawyer of New
Orleans, has acquired distinction by his Various contributions to the history
of Louisiana.

Mr. Gayarré is a native of New Orleans, a.nd a descendant of one of the old historical fam-
ilies of the State. He is by profession a lawyer, but has given much of his time to the c111-
tivation of letters. He has held various civil ofﬁces, and was for several years Secretary of
State for Louisiana. His works are: History of Louisiana (French Domination), 2 vols.,
8vo; History of Louisiana (Spanish Domination), 1 vol., Svo; Romance of the History of

States Secretary in Mexico, and has published several valuable works upon that country :
Mexico As It Was and As It Is; Mexico, Aztec, Spanish, and Republican; and Observations
on Mexican History and Archaeology. He is also the author of Captain Canot, or Twenty
Years of an African Slaver, a scathing exposure of the horrors of the slave-trade, which

PETER OLIVER, 1821-1855, was a native of New Hampshire. During his brief lifetime he
contributed numerous articles to the Church Review. After his death there was published
from his MS., A Historical Review of the Puritan Government in Massachusetts, etc. :The
work was intended to show, in the greatest fulness of detail, the dark side of the Puritan
régime. The style is clear, concise, and forcible. The author’s views and statements, how?
ever, have been severely criticized. He has been accused of prejudice and inaccuracy. The

. controversy may be considered as not yet fully decided.

Elements of lllyt-hology; Grecian History; English History; Scripture History; Classic
Tales; Tales from American History; Popular Lessons, etc. -

J. DANIEL RUPP, 1803 , was born near Harrisburg, Penn. He has been an industrious

- writer on the subject of local history, and has translated many works from the German and

the Dutch. The following are some of his original works: An Original History of the Re-
ligious Denominations in the United States; Histories of Lancaster, Berks, Lebanon, York,
Northampton, Lehigh, Monroe, Carbon, Schuylkill, Dauphin, Cumberland, I<‘ranklin, Bed-

Massachusetts Bar. He contributed largely to the North American Review, and The New
England Magazine, and was for a number of years President of the Massachusetts Historical
Society. In 1825 he published, with notes, John W'inthrop’s History of Massachusetts, from
the MS. continuation discovered in Boston in’ 1816. His chief work, however, is a Genea-
logical Dictionary of the First Settlers of New England, in 4 vols., 8vo. Upon this work the
author expended twenty years of careful labor. The diﬂiculties and obscurities to be over-
come in its preparation justify the North American Review in pronouncing it “ the most
stupendous work on genealogy ever compiled.”

the list here given, Mr. Barber’s works do not belong to a very high order of literature.

SAMUEL HAZARD, 1784-1870, a native and resident of Philadelphia, deserves honorable men-
tion for his laborious services as a local historian and annalist. He published, 1828-1836,
sixteen octave volumes of the Pennsylvania Register; 1839-1842, six volumes of the United
States Commercial and Statistical Register; also, Annals of Pennsylvania, from 1609 to 1642,

William Allen.

VVILLIAM ALLEN, D.D., 17 84-1868, President of Bowdoin College, is
widely known to the reading public by his American Biographical and
Historical Dictionary, the ﬁrst work of the kind published in the United
States.

Dr. Allen was a native of Massachusetts and a graduate of Harvard, and was President of
Bowdoin College from 1820 to 1829. His Dictionary appeared originally in 1809. It has been
revised and enlarged from time to time. The ﬁrst edition contained notices of 700 Americans.
The last, 1857, contains notices of 7,000. Dr. Allen assisted Dr. Bogue, of London, in his History
of Dissenters, 1809, preparing for it the lives of the American ministers noticed in the work.
Among his services to literature, one of special value, was a collection of more than 10,000
words not previously found in any English Dictionary. Of these, 1,500 were contributed in
1846 to Worcester’s Dictionary, 4,000 to Webster’s in 1854, and 6,000 to the Revised Webster
oi'1864. Some of his_ other publications are Baccalaureate Addresses, J unius Unmasked, and
numerous commemorative discourses. His chief claim to a place in literature, however, is
his Biographical Dictionary, already mentioned, a careful and scholarly performance, which
for half a century was almost our only representative in that department of letters, and
which laid the foundation for the more ﬁnished structures which have succeeded it.

JOHN L. BLAKE, LL. D., 1788-1857, a graduate of Brown University, was known chieﬂy as
the Principal of a Young Ladies’ Seminary, and as the author of a series of popular school-
books. During the latter years of his life, he devoted his attention to general literature, the
results of which were given in his Family Encyclopaedia, 960 pp. royal 8vo, and General
Biographical Dictionary, 1100 pp. royal 8vo, both of which had a large sale. He wrote also

opened a private school for young ladies. On the opening of the High-School, in 1888, he
was appointed one of the original Professors, and he held the position until 1845, when he
resigned. IIe made books almost without number, though he did little in the way of
authorship. He was merely a compiler, and used the paste and scissors more than the pen.
Yet some of his works had a large sale, and the number of them was prodigious. Those best
known are Pictorial History of the United States, and Pictorial History of the World. IIe
was a good scl1olar,an'd a man of very decided ability, and he might have attained high rank
as a writer, but he deliberately preferred cheap compilation to original authorship.

IV. VVRITERS ON LITERATURE AND CRITICISM.

Ralph Waldo Emerson.

RALPH VVALDO EMERSON, 1803 , is a conspicuous ﬁgure in the
literature of the period now under consideration.

Mr. Emerson is a native of Boston, and a graduate of Harvard. He
was ordained as a minister to a Unitarian church in Boston, but in conse-
quence of the peculiarity in his views he in 1832 sundered the connection,
and has since that time given himself up to the investigation of metaphys-
ical and moral questions.

Mr. Emerson is an independent thinker, and is remarkable equally for
the originality and the subtlety of his thoughts, and for his power of
expression. In the latter respect he is indeed an enigma. Nobody can
express himself more clearly than Mr. Emerson, when he chooses. &But
when he does not choose, nobody can more successfully hide his meaning,
if he has any, under a show of plain words and simple constructions. The

Sphinx is not a greater mystery than are some of Mr. Emerson’s delphic‘

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 223

sayings, though clothed in words and phrases as plain as Blair’s Sermons,
or Murray’s English Grammar.

Mr. Emerson is a transcendentalist of the most advanced school; and
his views on the higher subjects of mind and spirit a.re so far removed from
the common apprehension, that it is not easy to formulate them, or to say
precisely what he does think and teach.

As an essayist and a lecturer on more familiar subjects, he is singularly
attractive. His method is, not to reason, in the ordinary sense of the term,
but to utter truth oracularly, leaving it to make its own appeal to the in-
tuitions of the reader or hearer.

Mr. Emerson has visited various parts of the United States on invitation
to deliver lectures or addresses, and he has visited England twice, the
second time on a professional lecturing tour. But for the most part he has
lived in seclusion at Concord, Mass., to which place his admirers have
resorted, as devotees to a shrine. Most of his peculiar views were given to
the world in The Dial, a magazine begun in 1840 and continued for four
years, and devoted to the discussion of disputed points in religion, philoso-
phy, literature, and history.

A uniform edition of his Works has been printed in 6 vols., as follows:
Essays, 2 vols.; Representative Men, 1 vol.; English Traits, 1 vol.; Lec-
tures and Addresses, 1 vol.; Poems, 1 vol.

The English Traits was published after his return from his lecturing tour
in England, and contains his impressions of the country and its people.
It has been one of his most popular books. The volumes of Essays and of
Lectures are exceedingly various in style and subject, but contain in frag-
mentary form all those peculiarities of his style, as a thinker and a writer,
which have given him such a wide celebrity. The same is true to a certain
extent of his Poems. Some of these have, in form and ﬁnish, all the brilliance
and the exactness of the diamond, —-— hard, bright, and cutting. It would be
difficult to find, outside of the Greek Anthology, anything more absolutely
faultless than some of these little gems. Others again belong to the order
of the Sphinx, and may be safely commended to those who are fond of rid-
dles. The most important volume in the series is that which contains Rep-
resentative Men. In this, under six great heads, Mr. Emerson, more nearly
than in any of his other works, gives expression to his system as a whole.
The topics are, 1. Plato, the Philosopher; 2. Swedenborg, the Mystic; 3.
Montaigne, the Sl:ept.ic; 4. Shakespeare, the Poet; 5. Napoleon, the Man
of the World; 6. Goethe, the W1'iter. The mental portraits sketched under
these six heads give us Mr. Emerson himself, so far as he is capable of being
formulated at all. s

“A more independent and original thinker can nowhere in this age be found.”—
Blackwood.

224 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

“It is better for a man to tell his story, as Mr. Irving, Mr. Hawthorne, or Mr. Longfellow
does, than to adopt the style Emersonian — in which thoughts may be buried so deep that
common seekers shall be unable to ﬁnd them.”——Loradon A/,/ienzvemn.

THE MOUNTAIN AND THE SQUIRREL.

The mountain and the squirrel
Had a quarrel,
And the former called the latter “Little Prig.”
Bun replied——
“You are doubtless very big;

But all sorts of wind and weather
Must be taken in together,

To make up a year,

And a sphere;
And I think it no disgrace
To occupy my place.

If 'I’m not so large as you,

You are not so small as I,
And not half so spry.

I’ll not deny you make

A very pretty squirrel-track.

Talents differ: all is well and wisely put:

If I cannot carry forests on my back,
Neither can you crack a nut.”

THE SPHINX.

The Sphinx is drowsy,
Her wings are furled,
Her eye is heavy,
She broods on the world.
“ Who ’Il tell me my secret
The ages have kept?
I awaited the seer
While they slumber’d and slept,

“The fate of the man-child,——
The meaning of man,~—

Known fruit of the unknown,
Daedalian plan.

Out of sleeping a waking,
Out of waking a sleep,

Life death overtaking,
Deep underneath deep.

“Erect as a sunbeam
Upspringeth the palm;

The elephant browses
Undaunted and calm;

In beautiful motion
The thrush plies his Wings,

Kind leaves of his covert!
Your silence he sings.

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 225

“The waves unashamed
Indifference sweet,

Play glad with the breezes,
Old playfellows meet.

The journeying atoms,
Primordial wholes,

Firmly draw, ﬁrmly drive,
By their animate poles.

“Sea, earth, air, sound, silence,
Plant, quadrupeld, bird,

By one music enchanted,
One deity stirred,

Each the other adorning,
Accompany still,

Night veileth the morning,
The vapor the hill.

“The babe, by its mother
Lies bathed in joy,

Glide its hours uncounted,
The sun is its toy;

Shines the peace of all being
Without cloud in its eyes,

And the sum of the world‘
In soft miniature lies.

“ But man crouches and blushes,
Absconds and conceals;

He creepeth and peepeth,
He palters and steals;

Inﬁrm, melancholy,
Jealous glancing around,

An oaf, an accomplice,
IIe poisons the ground.”

Outspoke the great mother,
Beholcling his fear;— _
At the sound of her accents
Cold shuddered the sphere;—-
9‘ Who has drugg’d my boy’s cup,
“Tho has mixed my 'b0y’s bread?
Who, with sadness and madness,
Has turned the man-child’s hcad?‘”’

Uprose the merry" Sphinx,
And crouched no more in storm:

She hopped into the baby’s eyes,
She hopped into the morn,

. She spired into a yellow ﬂame, ,
She ﬂowered in blossoms red,
She ﬂowed into a foaming wave,

She stood Monadnoc’s head.

GREAT WORKS A GROWTH.

It is easy to see that what is best written or done by genius, in the world, was no man’s
work, but came by wide social labor, when a thousand wrought like one, sharing the same
impulse. Our English Bible 1S a wonderful specimen of the strength and music of the Eng-
lish language. But it was not made by one man, or at one time; but centuries and churches
brought. it to perfection. There never was a time when there was not some translation ex-
isting. The Liturgy, admired for its energy and pathos, is an anthology of the piety of ages
and nations, a translation of the prayers and forms of the Catholic Church,—these, collected,
too, in long periods, from the prayers and meditations of every saint and sacred writer, all
over the world. . . . . The nervous language of the Common Law, the impressive forms of
our courts, and the precision and substantial truth of the legal distinctions are the contri-
bution of all the sharp-sighted, strong-minded men who have lived in the countries where
those laws govern. . . . . The world takes liberties with world-books. Vedas, ]Esop’s
Fables, Pilpay, Arabian Nights, Cid, Iliad, Robin Hood, Scottish Minstrelsy, are not the
work of single men. In the composition of such works, the time thinks, the market thinks,
the mason, the carpenter, the merchant, the farmer, the fop, all think for us. Every book
supplies its time with one good word; every municipal law, every trade, every folly of the
day; and the generic catholic genius who is not afraid or ashamed to owe his originality to
the originality of all, stands with the next age as the recorder and embodiment of his own.

SHAKESPEARE BIOGRAPHY.

Can any biography shed light on the localities into which the Midsummer Night’s Dream
admits me? Did Shakespeare conﬁde to any notary or parish recorder, sacristan, or surro-
gate, in Stratford, the genesis of that delicate creation? The forest of Arden, the nimble
air of Scone Castle, the moonlight of Portia’s villa, “the antres vast and deserts idle,” of
Othe1lo’s captivity,—where is the third cousin, or grand-nephew, the chancellor’s ﬁle of ac-
counts, or private letters, that has kept one word of those transcendent secrets ? In ﬁne, in
this drama, as in all great works of art, —-in the Cyclopaean architecture of Egypt and In-
dia; in the Phidian sculpture; the Gothic minsters; the Italian paintings ; the Ballads of
Spain and Scotland,—the Genius draws up the ladder after him, when the creative age goes
up to heaven, and gives way to a new, who see the works, and ask in vain for a history.

Shakespeare is the only biographer of Shakespeare ; and even he can tell nothing, except
to the Shakespeare in us; that is, to our most apprehensive and sympathetic hour. He can-
not step from off his tripod, and give us anecdotes of his inspirations. Read the antique
documents extricated, analyzed, and compared, by the assiduous Dyce and Collier; and
now read one of those skiey sentences —a‘eLrolites — which seem to have fallen out of heaven,
and which, not your experience, but the man within the breast, has accepted as words of
fate; and tell me if they match; if the former account in any manner for the latter; or,
which gives the most historical insight into the man.

Hence, though our external history is so meagre, yet, with Shakespeare for biographer,
instead of Aubrey and Rowe, we have really the information which is material, that which
describes character and fortune, that which, if we were about to meet the man and deal
with him, would most import us to know. We have his recorded convictions on those
questions which knock for answer at every heart,——on life and death, on love, o_n wealth
and poverty, on the prizes of life, and the ways whereby we come at them ; on the charac-

malice and their gift in our brightest hours. VVhoever read the volume of the Sonnets,
without ﬁnding that the poet had there revealed, under masks that are no masks to the in-
telligent, the love of friendship and of love; the confusion of sentiment in the most sus-
ceptible, and at the same time, the most intellectual of men? VVhat trait of his private
mind has he hidden in his dramas? One can discern, in his ample pictures of the gentle-
man and the king, what forms and humanities pleased him; his delight in troops of friends,
in large hospitality, in cheerful giving. Let Timon, let Warwick, let Antonio the merchant,
answer for his great heart. So far from Shakespeare bei11g the least known, he is the one
person, in all modern history, known to us. VVhat point of morals, of manners, of economy,

Margaret Fuller, Marchioness D’Ossoli.

SARAH MARGARET FULLER, JlIa.rchz'0ne3s D’ Ossol-7}, 1810-1850, is asso-
ciated, in history and in her modes of thinking and writing, with her friend
and biographer, Ralph VValdo Emerson. Her writings were chieﬂy criti-
cal, her Papers on Literature and Art being her best volume. She was while
living noted also for her conversational power, in which particular she is
thought to have been fully equal to the celebrated Madame de Stat-Ll.

Margaret Fuller was born in Cambridge, Mass. She was the daughter of the Hon. Timothy
Fuller, a lawyer of Boston, but nearly all his life a resident of Cambridge, and a Represen-
tative of the Middlesex District in Congress from 1817 to 1822'). Mr. Fuller, upon his retire-
ment from Congress, purchased a farm at some distance from Boston, and abandoned law
for agriculture, soon after which he died.

Margaret from a very early age evinced the possession of remarkable intellectual powers. '

Her father regarded her with a proud admiration, and was from childhood her chief in-
structor ‘uide com )ELI1lO1] and friend. He was accustomed to re uire of her at eirrht
7 7 3 3 b
ears of a ‘e the com )OSltlOI1 of a number of Latin verses ever da . Her studies in hi-
7

losophy, history, general science, and current literature were in after years extensive and
profound.

After her father‘s death, she applied herself to teaching as a vocation, first in Boston,

then in Providence, and afterwards in Boston again, where her “Conversations ’.’ were for
several seasons attended by classes of women, some of them married, and including many
from the best families of that city.

In the autumn of 1814, she acceptedan invitation to write for the New York Tribune, in
the department of Reviews and Criticisms on current Literature and Art, ‘a position which

. she ﬁlled with eminent ability for nearly two years. She had previously found “ ﬁt audience

though few,” for a series of remarkable papers in The Dial, of which she was at ﬁrst
co-editor with Emerson, but which was afterwards edited by him only, though she contin-
ued a contributor to its pages. The subj ects discussed in these papers were the following:
Lord Herbert of Cherbury; Woman; The Great Musicians, etc.

In 1843, Miss Fuller accompanied some friends on a tour by Niagara, Detroit, and Mack-
inac to Chicago, and across the prairies of Illinois. The resulting volume, entitled Sum-
mer on the Lakes, is considered one of her best works in this department. Her W'oman

in the Nineteenth Century——an extension of her essay in The Dial, was published early
in 1845, and a moderate edition sold. The next year a selection from her Papers on Litera-
ture and Art was issued by Wiley and Putnam, in two volumes of their Library of American
Books. These Papers embody some of her best contributions to The Dial, The Tribune, and
perhaps one or two which had not appeared in either.

In the summer of 1845, Miss Fuller accompanied the family of a friend to Europe,
visiting England, Scotland, France, and passing through Italy to Rome, where they spent
the ensuing winter. She accompanied her friends next spring to the north of Italy, and
there stopped, spending most of the next summer at Florence, and returning at the approach
of winter to Rome, where she was soon after married to Giovanni, Marquis d’Osso1i, who
had made -her acquaintance during her ﬁrst winter in the Eternal City.

They afterwards resided in the Roman States until the summer of 1850, when they deemed '

itexpedient to migrate to Florence, both having taken a11 active part in the Republican
movement. In June they set sail __at Leghorn for New York, in the Philadelphia brig
Elizabeth, which was doomed to encounter a succession of disasters. They had not been
many days at sea when the captain was prostrated by a disease which ultimately exhibited
itself as conﬂuent small-pox of the most malignant type, and terminated his life soon after
they touched at Gibraltar, after a sickness of intense agony and loathsome horror.

. The vessel was detained some days in quarantine by reason of this aﬁliction, but ﬁnally set
sail again just in season to bring her on our coastvon the fearful night between the 18th and
19th of July, 1850, when darkness, rain, and a terrible gale from the south-west conspired
to hurl her into the very jaws of destruction. She struck during the night, and before the
next evening was a mass of drifting sticks and planks, while the passengers and part of the
crew were buried in the boiling surges. Among those drowned in this fearful wreck were
the Marquis and Marchioness d’Ossoli, and their only child.

Horace Binney Wallace.

HORACE BINNEY WALLACE, 1817-1852, was a man of remarkable abili-
ties and character. His posthumous volumes on Art and Scenery in
Europe, and Literary Criticisms and Other Papers, though fragmentary
and incomplete, give on every page evidence of the very highest abilities
as a literary and art critic. His early death occasioned profound regret.

Mr. Wallace was  native and resident of Philadelphia, and a nephew of the distinguished
jurist, Horace Binney. After studying for two years in the University of Pennsylvania, he
entered Princeton, graduating in the class of 1835. He studied both medicine and law, but
practised neither. IIe travelled in Europe in 18eL9—and ’50, and again in 1852, dying in the
year last named, at Paris. After his death were published: Art and Scenery in Europe;
Literary Criticism and Other Papers. He had been engaged, with Mr. J. I. Clarke Hare, in
the preparation of a series of volumes on Civil and Canonical Law, which received the high-.
est Commendations of the profession. Mr. Wallace’s ﬁrst publication was a novel, Stanley,
or The Recollections of a Man of the I/Vorld, written at the age of twenty. “I doubt whether
history displays, at thirty years of age, a loftier nature, or one more usefully ‘or profoundly
cultivated.” -— Daniel ' Webster.

Henry Reed.

HENRY REED, LL. D., 1808-1854, grandson of General Joseph Reed of
Revolutionary memory, and Professor of Rhetoric and English Literature
in the University of Pennsylvania, is widely and most favorably known by
his Lectures on English Literature and other Works of a like character.

FROM-1830 TO 1850. 229

Prof. Reed was born in Philadelphia, and graduated at the University of Pennsylvania, in
the class of 1825. He studied law and was admitted to the bar, but afterwards devoted hi1n-
self to the more congenial pursuits of literature. He was lost on the steamer Arctic, Sept.
27, 1854. ’

Prof. Reed was a man of ﬁne literary culture, an accomplished writer, lecturer, and
critic; and his sudden death in the midst of his years a11d his usefulness was justly regarded
as a great public loss. Besides important services in editing the Poems of Wordsworth,
,Reid’s English Dictionary, Graham’s English Synonymes, and other scholarly work, he left
in manuscript several Courses of Lectures, which were edited by his brother William B.
Reed, and which have been received witl1 great favor. There were Lectures on English
Literature, already mentioned; Lectures on English Ilistory as illustrated by Shakespeare’s

"Plays; Lectures on the British Poets; Two Lectures on the History of the American Union.

WILLIAM B. REED, LL. D., 1806
delphia, and graduated at the University of Pennsylvania, in the class of 1822. Mr. Reed is
by profession a lawyer. He was Attorney~G eneral of Pennsylvania in 1838, and United States
Minister to China in 1857 and ’58. He negotiated the Treaty with China. Mr. Reed is a
vigorous writer, and his pen has seldom been idle. Besides numerous Addresses before liter-
ary and historical societies, he has published‘The Life and Correspondence of Joseph Reed
(his grandfather), 2 vols., 8vo; and A Memoir of Prof. Henry Reed (his brother) with an
edition of Prof. Reed’s Lectures. Mr. Reed l1ad also an active pamphlet wa’rfare with Ban-
croft and others, in regard to certain points in the history of Gen. Joseph Reed.

, a brother of the preceding, was likewise born in Phila-

Verplanck.

GULIAN CROMMELIN VERPLANCI{, LL. D., 17 87-187 0, was the ﬁrst
American who distinguished himself in the diﬂicult walk of Shakes pearian
criticism. His edition of Shakespeare’s Plays, with a Life and Critical
Notes, was an honor to American scholarship, and was the best American
edition of Shakespeare prior to that of Richard Grant VVhite.

Mr. Verplanck was born in the city of New York, and graduated at Columbia College at
the early age of ﬁfteen. He studied for the bar, was admitted, and then spent several years
in European travel. ' On his return he took an active part in State politics ——whicl1 didinot
prevent him, however, from discharging the duties of Professor of the Evidences of Christi-
a.nity in the Protestant Episcopal Seminary of New York, —was member of Congress from
the city for eight years, and for a long while afterwards was State Senator. The New York
Senate at that time — like the House of Lords — constituted, in conjunction with the judges
of the higher courts, a court of appeals from the Supreme Court and the Chancery. Ver-
planck took great interest in these judicial proceedings, and many of his decisions are con-
tained in VVendell’s Reports. .

As a federal representative, Mr. Verplanck is entitled to the grateful regard of every
American author for his successful efforts in securing the extension of time of copyrights.

For the forty years preceding his death he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of New

. York.

Mr. Verplanck’s works, the most inﬂuential, at least, are mainly speeches delivered on

‘ public occasions. The earliest was the anniversary discourse before the New York Histori-

cal goeiety, delivered in 1818. This is generally known under its distinctive title: The
Early European Friends of America. Among his other discourses are those on The Right
Moral Inﬂuence of Liberal Studi_es, delivered at llobart College; on The Inﬂuence of Moral
Causes upon Opinions, Science, and Literature, delivered at Amherst College; and on The
Advantages and Dangers of the American Scholar.

20

230 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

In early life Mr. Verplanck published anonymously The Bucktail Bards, a collection of
poems satirizing the literary pretensions of De Witt Clinton.

His Essay on the Doctrine of Contracts, called forth by the celebrated case of Ludlow vs.
Organ, is a searching inquiry into the bearings of ignorance, error, and concealment on the
part of contracting parties upon the validity of contracts.

In 1844 appeared his well-known edition of Shakespeare, prefaced by a Life of the drama«
tist, and illustrated with wood-cuts and critical notes.

Besides his labors already mentioned, Verplanck was a constant contributor to The Talis-
man, the Analectic Magazine, the North American Review, etc. In short, his protracted
life was industriously spent in furthering in every way the cause of American literature
and American progress. ‘

WILLIAM ALFRED JONES, 1817 -——-, _a native of New York and a graduate of Columbia
College, is a writer of note, the author of several volumes of literary criticism, wl1icl1 have
been favorably received by Washington Irving, Poe, Whipple, and others. His principal
works are: The Analyst; Essays upon Authors and Books; and Characters and Criticisms.

Rufus W. Griswold.

RUFUS WILMOT GRISWOLD, D.D., 1815-1857, without having much native

I talent, with little scholarship, and with less either of taste or judgment in

literary matters, yet by persevering industry and by skill in availing l1im~
self of the help of others, not only gained distinction for himself, but did
important service in the cause of American letters. His chief works, The
Female Poets of America, The Prose VVriters of America, and The Poets
and Poetry of America, are valuable and permanent contributions to our
literature.

Mr. Griswold was a native of Benson, Rutland County, Vt. He began life as a Baptist
preacher, but gradually discontinued his clerical functions, and gave himself up to literary
life. He was editor successively of several periodicals -——- Tl1e New Yorker, The Brother Jona-
than, The New World, Graham’s Magazine, and The International Magazine. He pub-
lished a volume of Poems, a volume of Sermons, The Biographical Annual for 1842, and
Curiosities of American Literature, the last being intended as an appendix to Disraeliis Cu-
riosities of Literature. He also edited the works of Poe, with a memoir. One of his more
elaborate performances was a sumptuous volume, called The Republican Court, giving a
description of American society in the days of Washington, with twenty-one portraits of the
distinguished women of that time. _

Mr. Griswold’s chief literary service, however, was the compilation of the three large
octaves, already mentioned, ﬁlling 1500 double-column pages, and entitled severally, The
Female Poets of America, The Prose \Vriters of America, and The Poets and Poetry of
America. They contain biographical and critical notices, copious extracts, and a few well
engraved portraits, and form a most valuable contribution to the history of American litera-

ture. Most of the biographical information contained in these volumes was obtained from

original sources, the selections are made with taste and judgment, and the works as a whole

_do credit to the industry, and in some respects to the literary skill of the author. “ He was

a plodding, industrious, and careful writer, extremely well informed on American literature,
but by no means an elegant, or even a correct, though a very ambitious writer. He was
inclined to be metaphysical and transcendental. but would get out of his depth and lmeome
unintelligible. Though he had no genius whatever, he has done some service in literature.
He will be remembered by his compilations.” — R. Shelton fI!ttc}c.mzz'e.

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 231

PARK BENJAMIN, 1809-1864, a poet and journalist, was born at Demarara, British Guiana,
where his father, a New York merchant, was residing at the time. Mr. Benjamin wrote
numerous short lyrics, his longest poem being one called The Meditation of Nature. He
edited the American Monthly Magazine in New York for ten years, and was associated with
Rufus W. Griswold in some of the literary enterprises of the latter. Many of Mr. Benja-
min’s pieces show capabilities for something higher than anything he ever achieved.

CHARLES DEXTER CLEVELAND, LL. D., 1802-1869, was a native of Salem, Mass., and a gradu-
ate of Dartmouth. He became a Professor in Dickinson College in 1830, and in the New
York University in 1832. In 1834 he established a school for young ladies in Philadelphia,
and in that position achieved his principal success. He was the author of several valuable
school-books for teaching Latin and Greek, but was chieﬂy known in letters by the following
works: A Compendium of English Literature; English Literature of the Nineteenth Cen-
tury; A Compendium of American Literature; A Compendium of Classical Literature. He
also issued the Lyra Sacra Americana, and a critical edition of Milton’s Poetical Works, with
Notes, a Life of the Author, and a complete Verbal Index.

Professor Cleveland, in 1861, was appointed United States Consul at Cardiff, Wales, which
oﬂice he held until 1864, when he returned to America. In 1866, he went to Europe and
spent three years abroad, mostly on the Continent.

V. POLITICAL VVRITERS.

Alexander H. Everett.

ALEXANDER HILL EVERETT, 1790-1847, was a man of letters as well as
a statesman, and did much by his writings to give shape to the national
policy. His writings did much also towards vindicating American states-
manship before the bar of European opinion. His two largest works, one
on the State of Europe, and one on the State of America, challenged and
gained general and respectful attention. His numerous contributions to
the North American Review also formed a valuable body of political criti-
cism and debate.

Mr. Everett was a native of Boston and a graduate of Harvard. He entered college at the
age of twelve and graduated with the highest honors at the age of sixteen. Ile studied law
with John Quincy Adams, and accompanied Mr. Adams on his mission to Russia, in 1809,
being then nineteen years old. From that time until 1829, with brief intervals, he was
engaged in the foreign diplomatic service of the United States, at St. Petersburg until 1812,
in the Netherlands until 1824, and in Spain until 1829.

On returning from-Spain he became editor and proprietor of the North American Review,
to which he had already, during his foreign residence, been a frequent contributor. He was
conﬁdential agent of the United States in Cuba in 1840, and President of Jefferson College,
Louisiana, in 1841. ’I‘he latter appointment he soon relinquished on account of declining
health. In 1846, he went to Canton as United States Minister to the Chinese Empire, and
died there in 1847, at the age of ﬁfty-seven. .

Mr. Everett’s ﬁrst publications were articles in the Monthly Anthology, a Boston maga-
zine, issued from 1803 to 1811. His contributions to the North American Review number
forty-four; those to the Boston Quarterly, eleven; those to the Democratic Review, seven-
teen; in all, seventy-two articles, on subjects of the most diverse character, and displaying
abilities of the highest order. Besides these contributions to periodical literature, Mr.
Everett published a volume of Poems; and two volumes of Critical and Miscellaneous
Essays ; and wrote the Lives of Warren and Patrick Henry,for Sparks’s American Biography.

232 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Mr. Everett’s largest separate publications were those already quoted, namely: Europe,
or a General Survey of the Political Situation of the Principal Powers," with conjectures on
their Future Prospects; America, or a General Survey of the Political Situation of the Several
Powers of the Western Continent, with Conjectures on their Future" Prospects; and New
Ideas on Population, 850., being a sequel to the discussion occasioned by his work on Europe.
In these important works, Mr. Everett boldly and intelligently examined’ the two leading
theories of political economy then dominating European thoughts, those of Godwin and
Malthus, and gavea solution to the vexed question of population, which, if it did not escape
criticism, gained universal attention. The work on Europe was translated into French,
Spanish, and German, the German edition being under the editorial supervision of Professor
Jacobi, of the University of Halle. The work on America likewise gained ample considera-
tion:

“This essay, however objectionable it may be to an Englishman in several respects, is
marked by ability of the very ﬁrst order. Since the publication of those admirable disserta-
tions which were collected in The Federalist, we have not seen any political composition

from the pen of a.n American that can at all be compared with this. The style is idiomatic’

and thoroughly English, found in our best school. We are often compelled to admire the
beauty of the periods when we are most disposed to differ from the sentiments which they
convey.” ——L0ndon Monthly Rev-2'ew. '

Edward Everett.

EDWARD EVERETT, I).C.L., 1794-1865, in addition to the many and
varied gifts of his brother Alexander, as a writer and a negotiator of aﬁoairs
of state, had the rare qualities of a consummate orator. He had from boy-
hood a natural gift for eloquence, and he cultivated the art to the highest

point that the most assiduous study and practice could enable him to reach.

His writings are numerous and varied, but his fame rests chiefly on his
Orations.. These have been published in four large volumes, and are an
enduring monument of his genius.

Edward Everett was born at Dorchester, near Boston, and educated at Cambridge. He
entered college at thirteen, and was graduated with high honors at seventeen. After study-
ing divinity for two years, he was ordained as a Unitarian minister, and began preaching to
the Brattle Street church, in Boston, left vacant by the death of Buckminster.

As a pulpit orator, Mr. Everett‘s success was immediate and brilliant. The following testi-

mony to his abilities in this line is from the pen of Mr. Justice Story. It was on the

occasion of a sermon preached in the Capitol, at Washington, in 1820. “ The sermon truly
was splendid, and was heard with a breathless silence. The audience was very large; and
being in that magniﬁcent apartment of the House of Representatives, it had vast effect.
I saw Mr. King, of New York, and Mr. Otis, of Massachusetts, there. They were both very
much affected with Mr. Everett’s sermon; and Mr. Otis, in particular, wept bitterly. There
was some very touching appeals to our most delicate feelings, as the love of our friends.
Indeed, Mr. Everett was almost universally admired, as the most eloquent of preachers.
Mr. King told me he never heard a discourse so full of unction, eloquence, and good taste."

In 1815, at the early age of twenty—one, lVIr. Everett was appointed to the chair of Greek
in the University at Cambridge, but before entering on the duties of his professorship, and
as preparatory to it, he spent four years in European study, chieﬂy in the University of
Gottingen. He also made the acquaintance of Scott, Byron, J effrey, Mackintosh, Campbell,
Romilly, Davy, and others. ‘

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 233

In 1825 he entered actively upon’ political life, being elected to the House of Representa-
tives, at Washington, and continuing in Congress for the next ten years. In 1835 he be-
came Governor of lVIassachusetts, and continued in oﬁice four years. On the election of
Harrison to the Presidency, Mr. Everett was appointed, 1841, United States Minister to Eng-
land. On returning from that mission, in 1848, he was elected President of Harvard Unive.r-
sity, which post he held about three years. A

In 1852, he was appointed Secretary of State by President Fillmore, and continued in
that otiice until the accession of President Pierce, in 1853. Being then elected a United
States Senator from Massachusetts, he entered actively upon the duties of the oﬁice, but in
1851., on account of declining health, resigned the position with the intention of retiring
entirely from public life. - ,

Recovering to some extent his health, and being earnestly drawn towards measures of
conciliation in the impending crisis of public affairs, Mr. Everett conceived, among other
things, the patriotic project of purchasing Mt. Vernon, the residence and burial—place of
Washington, and consecrating it as a public shrine for Americans in all future ages. As a means
of raising the money needed for the project, and at the same time of diffusing patriotic sen-
timents, he prepared an Oration on Washington, which he delivered to public audiences in

almost every part of the United States, and raised by these means nearly one hundred thou-'

sand dollars for his object. ‘He also wrote, for the promotion of the same object, a series of
articles for the New York Ledger, for which Mr. Bonner, the liberal-minded publisher of
that paper, paid the handsome sum of ten thousand dollars.

When the issue ﬁnally came between the North and the South,at the Presidential election
in 1860, Mr. Everett was a candidate for the Vice-Presidency on the ticket which proposed
constitutional compromise. Being defeated, and the war coming on, he gave his cohesion
to the party of his Northern brethren and the support of the national government.

Mr. Everett was by nature an orator and rhetorician, in the highest and best sense of those
words; and both as a speaker and a writer, he will compare favorably with some of the
great orators of antiquity. His orations are prepared with the most elaborate care, and in
the delivery there was nothing in manner, person, dress, gesture, tone, accent, or emphasis
too minute for his attention.

He began authorship at an early age, his first work, published when he was only twenty,
being a volume of nearly 500 pages, entitled A Defence of Christianity, written in reply to the
work, Christianity Examined, by the inﬁdel writer, George B. English. He edited the North
American Review from 1820 to 1824, and continued to contribute to it afterwards under the
editorship of his brother and others. His contributions to this review number over one
hundred, the articles, like those of Alexander Everett’s, being exceedingly varied in their
subjects, b11t marked with ability and scholarship, as was everything that came from his pen.

His Orations and Speeches have been published, 4 vols., 8vo. He prepared, also, a volume
for the Massachusetts District School Library, Importance of Practical Education and Use-
ful Knowledge. The articles written for the New York Ledger were likewise printed in a

separate volume, called The Mount Vernon Papers.

Mr. Everett’s fame as a writer rests mainly upon his Orations.

“The great charm of Mr. Everett’s Orations consists, not so much in any single and
strongly developed intellectual trait, as in that symmetry and ﬁnish which, on every page,
g_ives token of the richly-endowed and thorough scholar. The natural movements of his
niinzl are full of grace ; and the most indifferent sentences which fall from his pen have that
simple e1egance_whicl1 it is as diﬂicult to deﬁne as it is easy to perceive.” — E. G’. IIillm'cZ.

“If Webster is the Michael Angelo of American oratory, Everett is the Raphael. In the
former’s deﬁnition of eloquence, he recognizes its latent existence in the occasion, as well as
in the man and the subject. His own oratory is remarkable for grasping the bold and essen-
tial; for developing, as its own, the anatomical basis—— the very essence and nerves of his
subjeet—whi1e Everett instinctively catches and unfolds the grace of occasion, whatever

20*

it be ; in his mind the sense of beauty is vivid, and nothing is more surprising in his oratory
than the ease and facility with which he seizes upon the enduring amenities of every topic,
however far removed it may be from the legitimate domain of tact or scholarship.”—— Whipple.

Daniel Webster.

DANIEL VVEBSTER, 17 82-1852, was not merely a great lawyer and a
great statesman; he was also a great master of sound English, and as such
is entitled to a conspicuous position in the literary records of his country.

His works have been published in 6 Vols., 8V0, consisting of Speeches,
Forensic Arguments, and Diplomatic Papers.

The leading incidents of Mr. Webster’s life are too well known to call for more than a
brief summary in this place. Born of humble but sturdy parents, on the very outskirt of
civilization in New Hampshire, he enjoyed only meagre opportunities of education. By
dint of strenuous exertions on his own part, aided by the warm self-sacriﬁce of his father,
he was enabled to study for a While at Exeter Academy and at Dartmouth College, where
he graduated in 1801. * ’

Mr. Webster studied law, ﬁrst in his native place,‘ Salisbury, and afterwards with Chris-
topher Gore of Boston. He was admitted‘ to the Suffolk Bar, and afterwards to practice in
the Superior Court of New Hampshire. He practised for a number of years in Portsmouth,
then the capital of the State, but removed to Boston again in 1816; from this time, Boston
and Marshﬁeld were his home, if not always his place of residence.

Mr. Webster was United States Representative nine years in all, and United States Senator
eighteen years, and was three times Secretary of State, namely, under Harrison, Tyler, and
Fillmore. That he was not elected to the highest oﬂice in the gift of his country, was due
rather to peculiar conjunctions of public affairs than to any want of appreciation of his ser-
vices in the hearts of his countrymen generally.

Webster has not shaped the political clesti_nies of his country as directly or as permanently,
perhaps, as Jefferson and Hamilton have done. But he had a wider range of intellect and
culture than either, and he is on the whole the most attractive ﬁgure in the American
political arena next to VVashington. With all his mistakes and shortcomings, he was a
man to be loved and respected. The nick-name of “Black Dan” only indicates the familiar
affection with which he was regarded by his followers. He stood alone in his generation -
a tall, commanding ﬁgure, with swarthy complexion, sonorous voice, deep-seated, lustrous
eye, overhanging brows, and a grand, majestic head whose size has become proverbial.

In private life Mr. Webster was genial and entertaining, and he lived and died an enthu-
siastic sportsman and disciple of Izaak VValton. Amid all his greatness he was never so
happy as when rambling, gun in hand, over the shooting—grounds at Marshﬁeld or patting
the necks of his favorite cattle. To Webster’s memory may be applied most ﬁttingly those:
words of I-Iamlet: 1

He was a man, take him for all in all,
We shall not look upon his like again.

Regarded from the literary point of view, Webster’s productions may be grouped into
three classes: his legal arguments, his Congressional speeches, and his set orations.

Prominent, almost alone, in the ﬁrst class, stands his celebrated argument in the Dart-
mouth College case. The Legislature of New Hampshire had, without the consent of the
Trustees, entirely reorganized the College. The Trustees brought suit to recover possession
of the seal, records, and other property. This suit had been rejected in the State courts, and
was brought up to the United States Supreme Court on appeal. Webster, who was only
junior counsel, opened the case-—regarded then as hopeless — with the most profound and

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 235

skilful argument that had ever been made before that tribunal, and really exhausted the
subject. His main stress was laid upon that cla11se of the National Constitution which pro-
hibits the States from interfering with the inviolability of contracts. He held that the act
of incorporation was itself’ a contract with the incorporated body which the Legislature
could not, by any subsequent act, annul or weaken. The Jourt, with but one dissenting
vote, accepted his views, and from that day the Dartmouth College case has been regarded
as settling forever the position of corporate bodies throughout the United States. Of equal
power and of almost equal importance were Webster’s arguments in the leading cases of
Gibbons and Ogden (on steamboat monopolies), the Charles River Bridge, the Rhode Island
Charter, the Alabama Bank, and the Girard Will.

In criminal la.w, also, VVebster’s speech in the trial of Knapp at Salem is a wonderful
display of forensic eloquence. Nor are his state papers inferior in merit. They are all con-
ceived and expressed with wonderful vigor and elegance. Nothing in the English language
is better written than, for instance, Webster’s letter to Lord Ashburton on the impressment
of seamen.

The second class of Webster’s productions —— his Congressional speeches —are so familiar
to every American schoo°l—boy as to call for scarcely any notice. The very ﬁrst of them,
delivered in 1818, on the subject of the repeal of the Berlin and Milan decrees, established
his reputation forever. Then came the speeches on the United States Bank, the Tariff
Question, the Greek Revolution (where Webster denounced in unsparing terms the Holy

‘ Alliance), and on the Panama Congress.

In 1880 Webster made what the popular heart, if not the orator’s own mind, has always
considered his greatest effort— the reply to Hayne. Its delivery was a memorable scene in
the annals of Congress. The old Senate Chamber was crowded to overﬂowing with notables
of every grade, party, and nationality, kept spellbound for hours by the speaker’s eloquence.
This speech was regarded, at the time, as settling forever, as a matter of argument, the nul-
liﬁcation doctrine. Bitter subsequent experience has shown that both the doctrine of seces-
sion and the love for the Union, were too deeply rooted for mere forensic argument.

Brilliant, however, as Webster’s Congressional speeches are, they do not fully equal his
set orations. Three of these—the Plymouth Rock discourse, the Bunker Hill Monument
discourse, and the Eulogy on Adams and Jeﬁ'erson—are among the very choicest master-
pieces of all ages and all tongues. Nothing in the palmy days of Greece or Rome or Eng-
land or France has ever shrpassed these orations in unity and harmony of structure, or in
simple but majestic diction. The genius of Webster here reveals itself, unfettered by the
needs of party and untainted by the heat of debate, in all its depth, its sweetness, and its
originality. We cannot analyze these orations. Each seems to pour itself forth as the
single, spontaneous utterance of a great creative mind. It is the voice of a man who has
something grand to say to his fellow-men. To the student, these orations, and indeed all
Webster’s speeches, may be recommended as models of style to be carefully considered.

It is especially true of Webster that the style is the man. His style is the plain, straight-
forward expression of aclear and earnest mind. The sentences are singularly free from the

tricks of rhetoric in which most orators delight to deal, and the words are the living em-

bodiment of the ideas which they are intended to convey, while back of all we seem to see
the tall, gravely impassioned form of the orator himself, arousing us, convincing us, sway-
ing us at his will.

Webster’s Private Correspondence was published in 1856, in part, but his Lifelong re-
mained unwritten in a manner adequate to the importance of the subject. In 1869 and ’70,
however, appeared Mr. George Ticknor Curtis’s excellent biography of Webster. This work
fully supplies the need so long felt by the public. It is based upon the richest biographical
material, collected by Webster and by his literary executors, of whom Mr. Curtis himself is
one. The biographer is also in full sympathy with his subject, and prepared, by his own
culture and position, to do it justice. He has given us a full and thoughtful portraiture of
Webster, not merely in his legal and political activity, but in the ease and charming famil-
iarity of domestic and friendly intercourse.

.236 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

John Quincy Adams.

JOHN QUINCY ADAMS, 17 67-1848, son of John Adams, and sixth Presi-
dent of tlie United States, was a man of varied learning, and his ‘writings,
both literary and political, are numerous.

Mr. Adams published during his life several volumes, among which may
be named Lectures on Rhetoric and Oratory; The Bible and its Teachings,
a series of letters to his son; Poems of Religion and Society; and Letters
on Freemasonry. A collective edition" of his Works, by his son Charles
Francis Adams, l1as been promised. '

‘Mr. Adams’s life was spent almost entirely in public, and forms a part of the national his-
tory. He was born at Braintree, Mass., and graduated at Harvard. Ills boyhood and youth
from seven to eighteen were spent in Europe with his father and others, then in the foreign
service of the United States; and thus he was at an early age initiated in the arts and forms
of diplomacy. He returned home in 1785, and after graduating at Harvard, studied law with
Theophilus Parsons. ’

Mr. Adan1s’s ﬁrst publication, of any note, was a series of letters, under the signature of
Publicola, in 1791, advocating neutrality with France. From that time to the time of his
death, his tongue and his pen were busy, though mostly in the form of legislative and
forensic speeches, or of political discussion through the columns of the newspapers.

From 1806 to 1809 he was Professor of Rhetoric in Harvard University‘, and his two volumes
of Lectures on that subject were one of the fruits of his labors there.

Mr. Adams maintained his intellectual activity to the very close of life, and almost literally
died in the harness. After retiring from the Presidency, he entered the House of Represent-
atives, and continued to the last to engage in the arena of political debate, never hesitating
to break a lance with the youngest and the doughtiest of those opposed to him. Some of
his boldest and most vigorous efforts were put forth when he was over fourscore, and gained
for him by common consent the familiar title of “ the old man eloquent.”

In the heat and bitterness of partisan life at Washington, Mr. Adams never lost his love
for the more genial atmosphere of letters, in which his young manhood had been spent, and
he often gave tokens of this more genial aspect of his 1nany—sided character. On one occasion,
when appealed to by a number of young ladies for his autograph, he composed the follow-
ing characteristic poem, writing, for convenience of distribution, each stanza 011 a separate
sheet of note paper. A few stanzas are quoted: _

THE VVANTS OF MAN.

“Man wants but little here below,
Nor wants that little long.”-—-Goldsmith.
“Man wants but little here below,
Nor wants that little long.”
’Tis not with ME exactly so,
But ’tis so in the song.
My wants are many, and if told
VVould muster many a score;
And were each wish a mint of gold,
I still should long for more.

FROM 1830 T() 1850. 237

What ﬁrst I want is daily bread,
And canvas-backs and wine;

And all the realms of nature’ spread
Before me when I dine.

Four courses scarcely can provide
My appetite to quell,

With four choice cooks from France, beside,
To dress my dinner well.

These are the wants of mortal man;
I ca.nnot want them long,

For life itself is but a span,
And earthly bliss a song.

My last _great want, absorbing all,
Is, when beneath the sod,

And summoned to my ﬁnal call,
The mercy of my God.

Benton.

THOMAS HART BENTON, 1782-1858, for thirty years a representative of
Missouri in the Senate of the United States, was one of the most eminent
of political writers‘, as well as one of the most distinguished of American
statesmen. Besides his Speeches he published two works of great political
and literary Value, namely, his Thirty Years’ View, and his Abridgment
of the Debates of Congress. 8

Mr..Benton was born near Hillsborough, N. C., and studied for some time at the Univer-
sity of that State, at Chapel Hill, but did not reinain to‘ graduate. He removed to Tennessee,
and afterwards, in 1813, to Hissouri. In the Senate, he was a strong andspersistent advocate
ofa specie currency, acquiring by his efforts the epithet of Old Bullion. Two other measures
with which he was largely identiﬁed were the reduction of the price of the public lands, with
a view to promote settlement, and the construction of a railroad to the Paciﬁc.

On retiring from the Senate, he devoted himself to literary pursuits, and prepared for
publication the important works which have been named. These were Thirty Years’ View,
or a History of the ‘Workings of the American Government for Thirty Years, from 1820 to
1850, 2 vols., 8V0; An Examination of the Dred Scott Case, 8vo; and An Abridgment of the
Debates of Congress from 1789 to 1856, 15 vols., 8vo. The ﬁrst named of these works had a
very large sale. “The _literary execution of this work, the simplicity of its style, and the
unexceptionable taste which tempers all its author’s allusions to his contemporaries, have
been the subject of universal admiration.” —-717. 0’. Bryant.

Clay.

HENRY CLAY, 1777-1852, acquired special distinction as an orator. His
Speeches have been published in 2 Vols., 8vo. Though valuable merely as
literary efforts, they give little idea of his wonderful powers, his eloquence,
much more than that of his great political compeers, depending upon
the matchless graces of his delivery.

“Take him for all in all, we must regard him as the ﬁrst of American orators ; but posterity
will not assign him that rank, because posterity will not hear that matchless voice, will not

see those large features, those striking attitudes, that grand manner, which gave to second~
rate composition ﬁrst—rate eﬁ'ect. His Speeches will long be interesting as the relics of a
magniﬁcent and dazzling personality, and for the light they cast upon the history of par-
ties; but they add scarcely anything to the intellectual property of the nation.”—— Parton.

Mr. Clay was a. native of Virginia, buta resident and representative of Kentucky. He
was in political life for ﬁfty years, and a great part of that time in the city of Washington,
where he was the associate and peer of Webster, Calhoun, and the other great men of the
nation of that day. He negotiated the Treaty of Ghent, in 1815, and was for several terms
Speaker of the House of Representatives. He gained his greatest honors, however, in the
United States Senate. He was on different occasions a candidate for the Presidency, but
never on the winning side.

Calhoun.

JOHN CALDWELL CALHOUN, 17 82-1850, was one of the most distin-
guished political Writers and thinkers of his generation. However much
his compeers may have differed from him in views, there was among them
but one opinion in regard to his transcendent abilities. His Wrorks, con-
sisting mainly of speeches, have been published in 6 vols., 8vo, and form
a compact and coherent system of political opinion.

Mr. Calhoun was born in the Abbeville District, S. C. He graduated at Yale, in 1804,
with the ﬁrst honor. Ile studied law in Litehﬁeld, Conn., and began practice in his
native State in 1807. He was in political life from 1808 to the time of his death, 1850, a pe-
riod of more than forty years, and nearly all that time at Washington. Of all the men
during that time at the national capital, none exercised so commanding an inﬂuence in his
own section as Mr. Calhoun. '

“The eloquence of Mr. Calhoun, or the manner in which he exhibited his sentiments in
public bodies, was part of his intellectual character. It grew out of the qualities of his
mind. It was plain, strong, terse, condensed, concise , sometimes impassioned, still always
severe. Rejecting ornament, not seeking far for his illustrations, his power consisted in the
plainness of his propositions, the clearness of his logic, and in the earnestness and energy of
his manner.”——Dam'eZ Webster.

Hugh L. Legaré.

HUGH SWINTON LEGAR173, 17 97-1843, was almost equally distinguished
as a jurist, and as a man of letters, and in both respects he was held in
great estimation. His Works have been published in 2 vols., 8vo. ’ They
comprise speeches and papers on political, literary, and historical subjects,
and show him to have been a man of high culture and of a most gegal
temper.

Mr. Legaré was a native of South Carolina. He studied at the college in Columbia, and
afterwards in Paris and Edinburgh. Ile was Attorney-General of the State, Charge d’Af-
faires at Brussels, Member of Congress, and. in 184‘, Attorney-General of the United States.

Mr. Legaré was one of the most popular and eminent jurists that America has produced,

_ and also a man of wide attainments, elegant culture, and genial manners.

The best known of his essays are: The Constitutional History of Greece; Demosthenes;
and the Origin, History, and Inﬂuence of Roman Legislation. All three appeared in the

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 239

New York Review. Legaré’s chosen object in life was the fusion of the Civil and the Com- ,

mono I.-aw.

“Fifteen years ago (1828), I knew him as an eminent lawyer. He afterwards went abroad
in a diplomatic capacity, and at Brussels, where he resided, devoted himself anew to the
study of the Civil Law, with a view to make it subservient to the great object of his life-
the expansion of the Common Law and the forcing into it the enlarged and liberal principles

. a?1l(Ilj11Si1 morality of the Roman jurisprudence. This object he seemed about-to accomplish;

for his arguments before the Supreme Court were crowded with the principles of the Roman
law wrought into the texture of the Common Law, with great success. . . . His argumenta-
tion was marked by the closest logic; a.t the same time he had a presence in speaking,
which I have never seen eXcelled.”~Judge Story.

Rufus Choate.

RUFUS CHOATE, LL. D., 17 99-1859, was a man of commanding abilities
at the bar and in the Senate, and hardly less distinguished in letters. His
contributions to literature are not numerous, but they are of a character to
leave a permanent impress of the man upon his age. They have been pub-
lished, with a memoir of his life, in 2 vols., 8vo, and consist of Lectures,
Addresses, and Speeches. Of his great forensic arguments, no adequate
report remains.

Mr. Choate was born in Essex, Mass., and educated at Dartmouth. He studied law ﬁrst at
Cambridge, and then in the oﬂice of VVilliain Wirt at Washington. After practising for a.

, time at Danvers, he removed to Boston, where he rose to the highest position as an advo-

cate. He was United States Senator from 1841 to 1845.

MRS. LOUISA S. MCCORD, 1810 —, is a native of South Carolina, and a daughter of the
distinguished publicist, Langdon Cheves. She is a woman of high culture, and of superior
literary abilities. Her prose writings have been for the most part contributions to the
Southern Quarterly Review, De Bow’s Review, and The Southern Literary Magazine, and
have dealt-chieﬂy with questions of political economy. She has written Sophisms of the
Protective Policy, a translation from Bastiat; Caius Gracchus, a Tragedy; and My Dreams,
a volume of Poems. 1

THOMAS R. DEW, 1802-1846, was born in King and Queen County, Va., and graduated at
William and Mary, in which institution he became Professor of Political Economy and His-
tory in 1827, and President in 1836. The latter position he held until his death. He died
in France. He was a man of a philosophic turn of mind, and was held in high estimation.
The following are his chief publications : A Digest of the History and the Laws of Ancient
and Modern Nations; Lectures on History; On the Restrictive System; On Usury ; On
Slavery; The Characteristic Differences between Man and Woman.

BEVERLY TUCKER, 1781-1851, a son of the jurist, St. George Tucker, was born at Matoax.
Va., and educated at William and Mary College. He studied law, and in 1815 he removed
to Missouri, of which State he became a resident, and where he was appointed a Judge. In
1834, he was elected Law Professor in 1/Villiam a.nd Mary, which position he held till his
death. Prof. Tucker’s writings, besides numerous Addresses, etc., are Lectures on Govern-
ment, and three novels, George Balcombe, Gertrude, and The Partisan Leader. The last
named was a curious piece of anticipative ﬁction. Though published in 1836, it is dated

1 twenty years ahead, and purports to give what would be the state of things in 1856, when

Van Buren should be in his third Presidential term, at the head of a consolidated govern-

ment, and the Southern States, with the exception of Virginia, should have seceded. This
singular book was reprinted at the beginning of the late war, in 1861, and attracted much
attention. “He was a brave old Virginia gentleman, a stern States’ Rights doctrinaire,
intense of feeling, jealous of right, and with an eager sense of irony and injury. In his
style, I regard him as one of the best prose writers of the United States, at once rich, ﬂow-
i11g, and classical; ornate and copious, yet pure and chaste; full of energy, yet full of grace;
intense, yet stately ; passionate, yet never with a forfeiture of diguity.”— W7. Gilmore Simms.

GEORGE TUCKER, 1775-1861, was born in Bermuda, and educated at William and Mary Col-
lege, Va., under the direction of his relative, Judge St. George Tucker. George studied and
practised law; was sent to the Virginia Legislature in 1819-21, and to Congress in 1823; and

was Professor of Moral Philosophy and Political Economy in the University of Virginia, .

from 1825 to 1845. After that he lived in retirement, chieﬂy in Philadelphia. He died in
Albemarle County, Va. I-Iis mind was one of restless- activity, and he kept his pen busy
almost to the last, even after he had gone beyond his eightieth year. In the earlier part of
his career, he wrote some works of the imagination, which were well received. But imagi-
nation and fancy were not his forte. His place was rather in the region of philosophy and
political economy. The following are the titles of some of his works : Essay on Cause and
Effect; Essay on the Association of Ideas; .lssays on Subjects of Taste, Morals, and Na-
tional Policy; History of the United States, 4 vols., 8vo; Life of Thomas Jefferson, 2 vols.,
8V0; Political Economy for the People; Progress of the United States in Population and
IVealth in Fifty Years; The Theory of Money and Banks; Principles of Rent, Wages, and
Proﬁts _; The Valley of the Shenandoah, a novel, 2 vols.; A Voyage to the Moon, a satirical
romance, etc. 1

JAMES D. B. DE Bow, 1820-1867, was a native of Charleston, S. C., and a graduate of Charles-
ton College. He studied law, but devoted himself almost‘ entirely to political economy,
writing extensively ‘on commercial statistics and ﬁnance. I-Ie edited for a time the South-
ern Quarterly Review, at Charleston; went thence to New Orleans, where he established
De Bow’s Commercial Review ; and was afterwards Professor of Political Economy and Sta-
tistics in the University of Louisiana. He was also for two years Superintendent of the
United States Census, at Washiiigton, and Compiledithe Compendium, and three volumes of
Statistics, of the Census of 1850. He published Industrial Resources and Statistics of the
Southern and Western States, 3 vols., 8vo.

Henry Wheaton.

HENRY WHEATON, 17 85-1848, was the first American writer who at-
tained special eminence in the department of international law. His Ele-
ments of International Law has become a classic on that subject.

Mr. Wheaten was a native of Rhode Island, and a graduate of Brown University. From
1805 to 1807 he partly travelled in Europe and partly studied the Roman Law at Poic-tiers
in France. In 1807 he returned to America, and after practising his profession with success
was appointed Reporter for the Supreme Court of the United States.

From 1835 to 1846 he resided at Berlin, at ﬁrst Charge. d’Affaires and subsequently Minis-
ter Plenipotentiary to the Court of Prussia. In this, as well as in his other public positions,
he gained the esteem and friendship of all with whom his oﬂicial duties brought him into
contact. He reckoned among his warm friends many of the most celebrated statesmen and
men of science in Europe. I

Mr. Wheaten was engaged, at the time of his death, to deliver a course of lectures at the
Harvard Law School on International Law. _

Mr. Wheaton’s works, although not very numerous, are all extremely valuable. Promi-

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 241

nent among them, of course, is his Elements of International Law. This treatise took from
its ﬁrst appearance, and has ever since retained, the leading position among all of its class.
It was acknowledged by authorities in every nation to be the standard work on International
Law. It has run through several editions, the latest of which was the occasion for a serious
lawsuit between William Beach Lawrence and Richard 11. Dana, the former charging the
latter with literary piracy and infringement of the copyright law.

Wheaton’s Elements have been_ translated into Frciicli, Chinese, and Japanese, and have
been widely read and commented upon in every country in Europe.

Mr. Wheaton was also the author of a History of the N orthmen, a History of the Progress
of the. Law of Nations since the Peace of Westphalia (written originally in French, and
translated under the supervision of William Beach Ilawrence), an Inquiry into the British
Claim of Right to search, etc., and a Discourse on the Progress and Prospects of Germany,
besides several other discourses and orations. He also published a Digest of the Law of
Maritime Capture, the Reports of Cases argued in the United States Supreme Court from
1816-1827, and a Digest of Decisions of the same Court from 1789-1820. .

In his personal manners, Mr. Wheaton was very engaging, and his legal labors have the
merit of being at once very scholarly and very practical.

William Beach Lawrence.

 

WILLIAM BEACH LAVVRENCE, 1800 , like his immediate predeces-
sor Wlieatoii, and like Kent and Story ofia still earlier date, belongs to
that class of American jurists whose fame extends over both continents. It
may even be said of Mr. Lawrence in particular, that his reputation is more
European than American. Much, if not_tl1e greater part, of his miscella-
neous writings ﬁrst saw the light in English and French law periodicals,
and his magnum opus, —-— still unﬁnished, —- A Commentary on the Elements
of International Law, is now in course of publication in French, by Brook-
haus in Leipsic. ’ A

Mr. Lawrence is the representative of one of the oldest and best known families in New
York city. He was graduated at Columbia College in 1818, with distinguished honors.
After studying the Common law in the office of William Slosson, he passed two years,
1821-3, in travel through England, France, Italy, and one winter in Paris, in the study of
the Roman law. . A

In 1826 he was appointed Secretary of Legation at London, Mr. Gallatin being ambassador.
In 1827, when Mr. Gallatin returned to Washington, Mr. Lawrence was made Charge
d’Affaires, and entrusted with the diﬂicult task of carrying out the provisions of the recently
ratiﬁed treaty of peace, and sustaining a protracted diplomatic correspondence with the
English Government. Such was the impression made by his diplomatic ability on this occa-
sion, that Mr. Adams, then President, assured him of the mission to Berlin. The project
was frustrated, however, by the change of administration under Jackson.

After revisiting Paris, Mr. Lawrence resumed the practice of law in New York, and gained
great distinction by several able arguments before the Court of Errors. He also contributed
largely to the American Annual Register, and other periodicals, and delivered several dis-
courses before the New York Historical Society, as well as a course of lectures upon Political
Economy in Columbia College. Mr. Lawrence was thus one of the early advocates in
America of the Ricardian theory and of free trade.

After removing to Rhode Island (1850),. he was elected Lieutenant-Governor, and soon
after entering oﬂice became, by constitutional provision, Governor of the State. 4

On the death of Mr. Wheaten, in 1848, Mr. Lawrence undertook, for‘ the beneﬁt of the

21- Q

242 1 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

family of the deceased, the publication of the well-known Elements of International Law.
The first edition, a large portion of the matter of which was really furnished by Mr. Law-
rence himself, appeared i11 1855, and immediately made Wheaton’s name famous i11 America
and Europe. It met with universal recognition and adoption in courts and consular offices.
A second edition, carefully revised and furnished with elaborate notes bringing the text
down to date, was published by Hr. Lawrence in 1863. The appearance of a rival work, by
Richard B. Dana, purporting to be original and covering exactly the same ground, led to a
sharp litigation between Mr. Dana and Mr. Lawrence in the United States Circuit Court for
Massachusetts. Mr..Lawrence’s claims were fully sustained, and Mr. Dana’s work declared
an infringement of the copyright law.

In 1868 appeared the ﬁrst volume of Mr. Lawrence’s great Oominentaiv-e; in 1869, the

_ second volume. Merely to indicate the topics discussed in these two volumes would exceed

the limits of a sketch such as the present. Suffice it to say that they are exhaustive, and,
with the volumes yet to come, will constitute by far the completest and most valuable con-
tribution to international law and diplomatic intercourse in their origin, growth, and present
status, ever made in this or perhaps any country.

The Oomnzentaire has already met with the warmest expressions of approval from the lead-
ing European reviews. Its author carefully refrains from fanciful theories and speculation,
aiming to make his work a storehouse of positive historical facts and of rights based upon
treaty.

Space is Wanting even to enumerate Mr. Lawrence’s numerous contributions to such peri-
odicals as the Revue de Droit International, the London Law Magazine, etc., or his brochures
published from time to time in this country upon topics of international legislation. The
most recent of them, The Disabilities of American W'onien Married Abroad, led to the recom-

mendation of the author’s views by Governor Hoffman in his Message to the State of New -

York.

Mr. Lawrence’s Letters on the Treaty of Wlashington, which appeared originally in the
New York VVorld, have also been republished, and merit attention more than ever at the
present moment (1872), when that Treaty is undergoing such grave discussion.

Upon the whole, Mr. Lawrence’s activity as a writer upon international jurisprudence is
an example, rare indeed in America, of one who has devoted himselfwith unswerving per-
sistency to one special line of research, and has attained to the highest distinction in that
speciality.

WILLIAM WHITING, 1813 ——, was born in Concord, Mass., and graduated at Harvard, in
the class of 1833. He studied law, and practised many years in Boston; was Solicitor of the
United States War Department, lVashington, from 1863 to 1865. In this connection he wrote
an important work, which has passed through many editions, and has been made the basis
of much executive and legislative action: The War Powers of the President and the Legis-
lative Powers of Congress, in Relation to Rebellion, Treason, and Slavery. “This work
ﬁrst formulated the war powers of the count.ry. It was called for from all quarters, and
more than one edition was sent for from England, France, and other foreign countries. It
has passed through ten editions in Boston and seventeen in New York, and is still the hand-
book of the American statesman. The late editions are printed with the other more recent
writings on the same subject, vi7.., Military Arrests in Time of War; Reconstruction of the
Union, or The Return of the Rebellious States; and Military Government.”—Duyc7cinc7c’s
Cyc. of Amer. Lit, '

WILLIAM JAY, 1789-1858, was a native of New York city, a graduate of Yale, and a son of
Chief-Justice John Jay. He wrote the Life of John Jay; Inquiry into the Character and
Tendency of the American Anti-Slavery Societies; A View of the Action of the Federal
Government in behalf of Slavery; A volume of Miscellaneous Writings on Slavery; The
Causes and Consequences of the Mexican War; War and Peace, an essay recommending
arbitration instead of war, in the settlement of national disputes.

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 248

FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED, 1821 ———, a native of Connecticut, is widely known both as an
author and as the superintendent (until recently) of the Central Park of New York. He
is also known as a writer on political and economical subjects. He has published the fol-
lowing works: Walks and Talks of an American Farmer; A Journey in the Seaboard Slave
States; A Journey in Texas. His books are characterized by shrewd observation and a
pleasant style. His accounts of travel in the South, written before the war, discussed the
politico~economical aspects of slavery in a very searching manner, and provoked no little
discussion at the time of theirappearance. Mr. Olmsted’s labors as chief architect of the
Nexv York Central Park are evident to every visitor of that city. The park in its present
magniﬁcent condition is substantially the creation of his energy and engineering skill.

J OEL PARKER, LL. D., 1795-1875, was a native of New Hampshire, and a prominent jurist
and lawyer of that State, attaining the high position of Chief Justice of the Superior Court;
also Professor in the Harvard Law School. Judge Parker is the author of a number of purely
legal publications, and contributed, during the war, many articles and pamphlets on topics
of political law. Prominent among them are The Right of Secession, Habeas Corpus, and
Martial Law; The War Power of Congress; The,Trent Case, etc., etc.

Francis Lieber.

FRANCIS LIEBER, LL. D., 1800-1872, Professor of History and Political
Science in Columbia College, is the author of a large number of works,
but is best known by his Manual of Political Ethics, and his Work on Civil
Liberty.

Dr. Lieber is a native of Berlin. He served as volunteer against Napoleon in 1815, and
was severely wounded at Waterloo. He was persecuted in Germany at various times on
account of his liberal principles; he took part in the Greek revolt; afterwards, in Rome, he
was kindly received by Niebuhr and made an inmate of the family; in 1827 he settled
ﬁnally in the United States. From 1835 to 1857, he was Professor of Political Economy in
the State College of South Carolina; since then, he has occupied the chair of History and
Political Science in Columbia College, New York.

Dr. Lieber is the author of a great number of works and essays on critical, political, his-
torical, and biographical subjects, and also of several poems of merit. But the works by which
he is chieﬂy known are his Manual of Political Ethics, his Legal and Political Hermeneutics,
and his treatise On Civil Liberty and Self-Government. These works have earned for their
author a high reputation as a clear writer and a sound thinker upon the fundamental princi-
ples of law and government. Theyrhave been made text—books in many colleges and acad-
emies of the United States, and are cited with approval by our most eminent legal tribunals
and jurists. V

Lieber’s Civil Liberty is perhaps the best short exposition yet written of the character of
Anglo-American liberty, as institutional, in contrast with French democratic absolutism,
the most stringent of all despotisms.

In the matter of political economy, Dr. Lieber is a philosophic free-trader, in his own
words, “ an unhesitating advocate of the necessity as well as blessing of the freest possible
exchange, on grounds of philosophy, religion, civilization, civil liberty, and the commonest
utilitarian interests, as well as the highest humanitarian ends.”

HoN. CALEB CUSHING, 1800 —, is a native of Massachusetts and a graduate of Harvard.

VI. SCIENTIFIC VVRITERS.

Benjamin Silliman.

BENJAMIN SILLIMAN, LL. D., 1779-1864, “The Nestor of American
Science” (Edwcml Everett), is universally known by -his Works on Chem-
istry and as the founder of Silliman’s Journal of Science and Art.

Professor Silliman was born in North Stratford, Ct., and graduated at Yale, in the class of
1796. He was Professor of Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Geology, in Yale, from 1804 to 1855,
a little over half a century. By the brilliancy of his lectures, his eminence as a man of
science, and the genial and pervading goodness of heart which formed a prominent trait in
his character, he contributed largely to the prosperity of the institution.

Besides his scientiﬁc works, Professor Silliman wrote several attractive works of Travel :
A Journal -of Travels in England, Holland, and Scotland, 3 v_ols., 8vo; Remarks on a Short
Tour between Hartford and Quebec, 2 vols.; and A Narrative of a Visit to Europe in 1851,
2vols. He wrote also a work called The Consistency of Discoveries in Modern Geology
with the Sacred History of the Creation and Deluge, and numerous special Addresses. His
Life and Correspondence, by Professor Fisher, 2 vols., 8vo, consists to a great extent of Pro-
fessor Silliman’s own writings, and is a charming work.

Denison Olmsted.

DENISON OLMSTED, 1791-1859, long Professor of Natural Philosophy in
Yale College, was the author of several popular text-books connected with
his department of science.

Professor Olmsted was a_ native of Connecticut, and a graduate of Yale. For a long series
of years previous to his death he occupied the chair of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy

in that institution. His name is widely known throughout the country as a teacher and a

21*

246 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

man of science. His text-books are used largely in American colleges and academics. They
are: A_Compendium of Natural Philosophy; An Introduction to Natural Philosophy; An
Introduction to Astronomy; A Compend of Astronomy; and Rudiments of Natural Philoso-
phy. Besides these pop_11lar Works, Professor Olmsted contributed many valuable articles to
the scientiﬁc, literary, and educational reviews, and published biographical sketches of
Professor Mason, President Dwight, Eli Whitney, and others. He will long be remembered
by many thousand pupils as an earnest and successful teacher, and a most genial man.

Joseph Henry.

JOSEPH HENRY, LL.D., 1797 , is known almost exclusively as a
scientist. His series of annual reports as Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, however, partake to some extent of a popular character, and
give him a place in the ﬁeld of letters, though by no means commensurate
with his position as a man of science.

Professsor Henry was born in Albany, N. Y. He received a common school education,
and was for some years a watchmaker. In 1826, he was appointed Professor of Mathematics
in the Albany Academy, and while in this position began in 1827 a series of original experi-
ments in electricity, and in 1828 published an account of some of his experiments and discov-
eries. In 1831, by means of the electro—magnet which he had invented, he transmitted signals
through a wire at a distance of more than a mile. The development of the idea thus begun
led to the construction by Professor Morse of the magnetic telegraph. In 1832, Professor
Henry was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy in the College of New Jersey, which
position he held until 1846, when on the organization of the Smithsonian Institution at
VVashington, he was appointed its Secretary. In this position, he has achieved a world-wide
celebrity, not only by his own personal contributions to science, but by his wise measures
in so directing the policy of the Institution as to have made it a powerful instrumentality
for the promotion of general science.

Alexander‘ Dallas Bache.

ALEXANDER DALLAS BACHE, LL. D., 1806-1867, a distinguished phi-
losopher,’ and a great—grandson of Benjamin Franklin, achieved the crown-
ing glory of his life in. the successful prosecution of the work of the United
States Coast Survey. Apart from that, however, his success in other de-
partments of science and letters would have given him a lasting place in
the national history.

Professor Bache was a native of Philadelphia. He was educated at West Point, where he
graduated with the highest honors in 1825. He" became Professor of Mathematics in the
University of Pennsylvania in 1827.

In 1836 he was appointed President of Girard College, the buildings of which were then
approaching completion, and was sent to Europe to inspect the charitable foundations of

'the Old World, and prepare a plan for the organization of the College. On his return, he

published in 1839 a large volume, containing his Report on the European System of Educa-
tion. The College being not yet ready to go into operation, he became in 1841 the ﬁrst
Principal of the Philadelphia High-School, which had been established in 1838 without any
oﬂicial head, and which he reorganized.

In 1842, he returned to the University as Professor of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry,
which place he resigned in 1843, on being appointed Superintendent of the United States
Coast Survey. This last position he held to the time of his death, in 1867.

FROM 1830 TO -1850. 247

Professor Bache’_s publications, with the exception of the Report on Education in Europe,
before named, and l1is Reports on the Philadelphia High-School, are all of a scientific char-
acter, and are very numerous: Observations at the Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory
at the Girard College, 8 vols.; Annual Reports of the Coast Survey, in more than twenty large
4to volumes, besides papers a.l1nost without number on the transactions of the various scien-
tiﬁc bodies of which he was a member. _

FRANKLIN BACHE, M. D., 1792-1864, a cousin of Dallas Bache, and a great-grandson of Dr.
Franklin, was a native of Philadelphia, and a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania,
and for the last _twenty-three years of his life Professor of Chemistry in the Jefferson
Medical College of Philadelphia. He was also for a time President of the American Philo-
sophical Society. His contributions to medical science were very numerous, both as separate
volumes and as articles in scientiﬁc journals. The one best known is that prepared jointly
by him and his colleague, D13. Wood, The Dispensatory of the United States, familiarly
known in the profession, and among apothecaries, as “ Wood and Bache.” The ..only pub-
lication of his, not strictly professional, was Letters to Roberts Vaux on the Separate Con-
ﬁnement of Prisoners.

Robley Dunglison.

ROBLEY DUNGLISON, M.D., LL. D., 17 98-1869, was for almost half a
century one of the great ornaments of the medical profession in America.
His chief publications, A Medical Dictionary, and Human Physiology,
though intended mainly for the medical profession, are not Without :inter—
est to the general reader. I

Dr. Dunglison was an Englishman by birth; he studied medicine in London, Edin-
burgh, Paris, and Erlangen in Germany. He was invited to the United States by Jefferson,
in 1821, to ﬁll a chair in the new University of Virginia. He left that position for one in
Maryland in 1833, and ﬁnally, in 1836, he accepted the chair of Institutes of Medicine in
the Jefferson Medical School, Philadelphia, where he remained until within a few months
of his death. His publications were exceedingly numerous, and many of them, from the
nature of their subjects, were upon that order of land which lies between the domains of pure
science and popular literature. His Medical Dictionary, of which 60,000 copies were sold, is
a work for every library. Among his numerous other works may be named Human Physi-
ology; Elements of Hygiene; General Therapeutics; Practice of Medicine, etc., etc.

In 1872, a posthumous Work, A History of Medicine, was published, edited by his son
Richard J. Dunglison, M. D.

Dr. Dunglison took an active part in the management of various philanthropic institu-
tions, and published various Lectures and Addresses in their behalf.

ORMSBY MACKNIGHT MITCHEL, 1810-1862, was a native of Kentucky and a graduate of West
Point. He distinguished himself as an astronomer, and as a popular writer and lecturer on
that subject. The Observatory at Cincinnati was due to his exertions. In 1859 he became
the Director of the Dudley Observatory at Albany. 011 the breaking out of the civil war, he

took an active part in the conﬂict 011 the Union side, and met with distinguished success.

IIe died of yellow fever at Beaufort, S. C. His published works are The Planetary and
Stellar Worlds; and The Orbs of Heaven.

ROBERT OWEN, 1771-1858, father of the three named below, was a Well—known socialist and
founder of the sect called the Owenites. Originally Mr. Owen was a cotton-spinner in Eng-
land and Scotland. In 1825 he purchased a large tract of land in Indiana and established
asettlement to which he gave the name of New Harmony, and which was intended to carry

248 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

out his peculiar socialistic views. These views had been already set forth in his works enti-
tled A New View of Society, Observations on the Effects of the Manufacturing System, 850.
The Colony of New Harmony was a failure, and Mr. Owen returned to England, where he
continued to advocate his peculiar views to a small circle of believers. Whatever may be
thought of the soundness of those views, there seems to be no doubt but that Mr. Owen him-
self was a man of energy, sincerity, business abilities, at least in early life, and actuated by
unselﬁsh motives. He had in 1829 a public Debate, in Cincinnati, with the celebrated Alex-
ander Campbell, in regard to the truth of Christianity, he denying and Campbell aﬁirming.
The Debate was published in a large 8vo vol.

ROBERT DALE OWEN, 1801 , son of Robert Owen, was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland,
but emigrated while very young with his father and brothers to Indiana. Mr. Owen has
been a prominent member of the Democratic party in the West, and represented the United
States at the court of Naples for ﬁve years. He edited the Fraee Inquirer, and has contributed
a number of articles to the press. His principal publications are On Education, and Foot-
falls on the Boundary of Another \Vorld. The latter work is a collection of so-called spirit-
ual manifestations, that is, of incidents and phenomena supposed to prove the existence
around us of a spirit world that occasionally reveals itself to our senses. Mr. Owen is a.
strong advocate of the credibility of Spiritualism, and a clear, able writer. He has published
a political pamphlet on the Wrongs of Slavery, and, very recently, a novel, Beyond the
Breakers.

DAVID DALE OWEN, 1807-1860, another son of Robert Owen, emigrated to the United States,
and rose to eminence as State geologist for several of the States. In this capacity he ex-
amined and reported upon the geology of Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, XVisconsin, Illinois,
Kentucky, etc. The results of his explorations are embodied in a numberof State and United
States oﬂicial reports.

RICHARD OWEN, M.D., 1810 , like his brothers, Robert and David, emigrated to the
United States, and has since remained here. He has been connected with various edu-
cational institutions in the West and South-West, and has published a Key to the Geology
of the Globe, and many essays on scientiﬁc and educational subjects.

SAMUEL G". MORTON, M.D., 1799—l851, was a native of Philadelphia. After spending some
time in a counting-house, he studied medicine, ﬁrst in Philadelphia, and afterwards in Edin-
burgh. He became a Professor in the Pennsylvania Medical College and President of the
Academy of Natural Sciences. Besides numerous special contributions to science, he pub-
lished two works, Crania Americana, and Crania Egyptiaca, which led to much discussion,
and gave the author a place among the most eminent ethnologists of the world.

GEORGE E. GLIDDON, 1808-1857, was born in England, but became a resident of the United
States the latter part of his life. He spent twenty-three years in Egypt, where his father
was United States Consul. Mr. Gliddon wrote several works on Egyptian antiquities, and
lectured extensively on the subject in the United States. He was a shallow man, with ready
utterance, and large pretensions to science, and he acquired a temporary notoriety, which
was very general. But he is already nearly forgotten. He died at Panama.’ His works
were: Ancient Egypt, Her Monuments, Hieroglyphics, History, and Archaeology; Appeal
to the Antiquaries of Europe on the Destruction of the Monuments of Egypt; Discourses
on Egyptian Archaeology; A Memoir on the Cotton of Egypt; Otia Egyptiaca; The Types
ef Mankind, or Ethnological Researches. The work last named was "the one which was
criticized with greatest severity. He was assisted in its preparation by J. C. Nott, M. D., of

Mobile. The work contained also contributions from Agassiz and from the unedited papers.

of Dr. Morton of Philadelphia. In it Gliddon attempted to set up a theory in regard to the
creation of the human race entirely at variance with the facts recorded in the Bible. The

FROM 1880 TO 1850. 249

shallowness both of his scientiﬁc knowledge and of his biblical learning, to Which also he
made pretensions, was exposed in various quarters, but by no one with more ability than by
Dr. Bachman, a learned naturalist and theologian, of Charleston, ‘S. C.

JOSIAH C. NOTT, M.D., 1804 —, was a native of Columbia, S. C. He studied medicine in
Philadelphia and afterwards in Paris and London. He practised for a time in his native
State, and then removed to Mobile and Alabama. In conjunction with Mr. Gliddon he pub-
lished two works which made a good deal of noise, Types of Mankind, and Indigenous Races
of the Earth. He also wrote The Physical History of the Jewish Races.

JOHN BACHMAN, D.D., LL.D'., 1790-1874, was a native of New York, but resident of South
Carolina, Where chieﬂy his intellectual activity was exercised. His profession was that of
a clergyman, but he had a taste for natural science, and gave much time to its prosecution.
He assisted Audubon in the preparation of his great Works, and .was the principal author
of that on Quadrupeds. His other Works are: Defence of Luther and the Reformation; Doc-
trine of the Unity of the Human Races; Notice of “The Types of Mankind” (Nott and
Gliddon’s work); Examination of the Charges in the Biography of Dr. Morton; Exami-
nation of Dr. Agassiz’s Natural Provinces of the Animal World; Characteristics of Genera
and Species as applicable to the Doctrine of the Unity of the Human Race. Dr. Bachman’s
writings have been chieﬂy of two kinds,'those descriptive of natural history, and those de-
fending the Bible account of nature on scientiﬁc grounds.

Professor Hitchcock.
EDWARD HITCHCOCK, 1). 1)., LL. D., 1798-1864, distinguished himself

especially in the department of Geology. His various Works on that sub-_

ject have been valuable, not only as text-books for schools and colleges, but
in Vindicating the consistency of geology with religion.

Prof. Hitchcock was born at Deerﬁeld, Mass. When a young man, he taught the Academy
in his native town; afterwards he was ordained to the ministry and preached at Conway ;
then he became Professor, and ﬁnally President, of Amherst College. Later in life, he re-
signed the Presidency and returned to his Professorship, in order to have more ‘time for
scientiﬁc pursuits. He made a geological survey of Massachusetts, and was also a commis-
sioner in behalf of the State to visit the Agricultural Schools of Europe. Besides his scien-
tiﬁc publications, which are numerous, he wrote: Elementary Geology; Religion of Geology
and its Connected Science; Religious Truth illustrated from Science; Lectures on Diet,
Regime, and Employment; Religious Lectures on the Peculiar Phenomena of the Four
Seasons; An Argument for Early Temperance, etc.

DANIEL DRAKE, M.D., 1785-1852, an older brother of Benjamin Drake, and a native of
Plainﬁeld, N. J., studied medicine in Philadelphia, and became very distinguished as a prac-
titioner and a teacher of medicine in Cincinnati. He was Professor in the Ohio Medical
College, the Cincinnati Medical College, the 'l‘_ransylvania l\Iedical College, Louisville, Ky.,
and ﬁnally in the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia. His publications are numerous,
but are chieﬂy professional. The largest, on The Diseases of the Interior Valley of North
America, is in high repute for its original investigations, and contains a vastamount of in-
formation on physical geography in connection with its account of local diseases. Other
works, of a popular kind: Pictures of Cincinnati; Practical Essays on Medical Education,
etc.

JOHN CASSIN, 1813-1869, a naturalist, was born in Pennsylvania, and was an active member
of the Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia. His works are the following: Illustra-
tions of the Birds of California, Texas, Oregon, British and Russian America; Mammalogy

JAMES P. ESPY, 1785-1860, was a native and resident of Pennsylvania. He was a zealous
student of meteorology, and maintained the theory that, by proper mechanical agencies
within the control of man, it was practicable at any time to produce storms. He published
The Philosophy of Storms. ‘ G

JACOB BIGELOW, M. D., 1787 , is a native of Massachusetts, and a graduate of Harvard,
and Professor of Materia Medica and Botany in the same. Dr. Bigelow is widely known by
his medical writings and his contributions to science. He has also written some works of
a popular character, as The Useful Arts considered in Connection with the Applications of
Science, 2 vols., and numerous witty pieces of poetry of a fugitive kind.

WORTHINGTON HOOKER, M.D., 1806-1867, was born in Springﬁeld, Mass., and graduated at
Yale College, where he was afterwards a Professor. He is the author of several essays of a
popular character, and of a series of excellent elementary text-books: Child’s Book of
Common Things ; Child’s Book of Nature, in three parts, treating severally of Plants, Ani-

of Medical Delusions ; Physician and Patient; The Medical Profession and the Community; .

Rational Therapeutics.

VVILLIAM F. LYNCH, U. S. N., 1805-1865, was a native of Virginia. He made an expedition
to explore the Dead Sea, of which he published an interesting account: Narrative of the
United States Exploring Expedition to the River Jordan and the Dead Sea. The work had
a large popular sale, and itsscientiﬁc results were of high value, adding largely to the
knowledge of the physical geography of that interesting region.

Dr. Kane.

ELISHA KENT KANE, M. 1)., 1820-1857, made himself known through-

out the civilized World by his Arctic explorations and his heroic attempts‘

to discover the fate of Sir John Franklin. His Works, describing these
explorations of the north polar regions, are at the same time valuable as
contributions to science, and brilliant as specimens of English composition.

Dr. Kane was a native of Philadelphia, a son of the Hon. John K. Kane. Dr. Kane studied
at the University of Virginia and in the Medical Department of the University of Pennsyl-
vania. He was appointed surgeon in the United States navy, and also served in his medical
capacity in the Mexican war. He is chieﬂy known, however, as an Arctic explorer.

In 1850 he accompanied, as Senior Medical Oﬂicer, the ﬁrst Grrinnell Expedition in search
of Sir John Franklin, and published in 1853 an account of the expedition. In 1853 he sailed
again to the Arctic regions, as commander of the second Grinnell Expedition. "i_‘h‘e party
did not return until 1855, and in 1856 Dr. Kane published his account, in 2 vols., 8vo, hand-
somely illustrated. The labors of composition bore too heavily upon a constitution already
undermined by fatigue and exposure, a11d the author died in February, 1857, at Havana,
where he had gone in the vain search after health. An interesting biography of Dr. Kane
was published in 1858, by Dr. Elder.

Dr. Kane’s merits, not merely as a naturalist and a daring explorer, but as a writer, are
conspicuous in his works, especially in his account of the second expedition. The narrative
of the dangers and sufferings of the party is given with a simplicity and vividness that place
the work in the foremost rank of descriptive writings.

SAMUEL TYLER, LL.D., 1809- —--, a native of Prince George’s County, Md., has been for many
years a practising lawyer at Frederick City, in that State. While pursuing diligently his pro-
fessional career, he has redeemed the leisure to make himself eminent as a writer on meta-
physical science. Mr. Tyler is probably, with the exception of Dr. McCosh, the ablest living
interpreter of Sir William Hamilton in the United States. The ﬁrst book which led him
into this line of study was Reid’s Inquiry into the Human Mind. He has written a large
number of articles for the Princeton Review, mostly on metaphysical subjects. He has
published The Progress of Philosophy; Discourse on the Baconian Philosophy; Burns as a
Poet and as a Man; Memoir of Roger Brooke Taney, LL. D. He has also written some law
works, and is Senior Professor in Columbian College Law School, at Washington City.

HENRY VETHAKE, LL.D., 1792-1866, was a native of Guiana. He removed to the United
States at the age of four; graduated at Columbia College; studied law, but afterwards gave
his attention to the study of mathematics. He was Professor in Rutgers College in 1813; in
Princeton College, 1817-21; again in Princeton; in the University of New York, in 1832;
President of Washington College, Lexington, Va.; Professor, and afterwards Provost, iii the
University of Pennsylvania, 1836-59; Professor in the Polytechnic College, Philadelphia,
1859-66. He edited the Supplementary volume of the Encyclopedia Americana, and wrote
most of the articles; also, The Principles of Political Economy.

CHARLES DAVIES, LL.D., 1798 -—-, distinguished as a mathematician, was Professor of
Mathematics, ﬁrst at West Point, 1824-1837 ; and afterwards in Columbia College, New York.
He is a nativeof Connecticut. He is widely and most favorably known as the author of a
series of mathematical works for teaching that branch of science, beginningwith the first
lessons in arithmetic, suited to the primary school, and ascending regularly to the highest
branches studied in college. The sale of these works, particularly of the elementary por-
tion of the series, has been enormous. First Lessons in Arithmetic; Intellectual Arithme-
tic; School Arithmetic; Grammar of Arithmetic; University Arithmetic; Elementary Al-
gebra; Elementary Geometry; Practical Mathematics; Bourdon’s Algebra; Legendre’s
Geometry; Elements of Surveying; Analytical Geometry; Differential and Integral Calcu-
lus ; Descriptive Geometry; Shades, Shadows, and Perspective‘; Logic of Mathematics;
Mathematical Dictionary. A

JAMES B. THOMPSON, LL. D., -—- —-, anative of Springﬁeld, Vt., and a graduate of Yale
of the class of 1831., has published a complete seriesof mathematical school-books, beginning
with primary arithmetic and extending to geometry and surveying. The series has been
received with favor, and enjoys a large circulation. A

THOMAS EWBANK, 1792-1870, was born in England, but in 1820 emigrated to the United
States. He was appointed Commissioner of Patents in 1849. He has written several works
descriptive of mechanical processes: Hydraulics, a Descriptive and Historical Account of
Hydraulic and other Machines for Raising Water; the World a Workshop; Thoughts on
VVater and Force; Life in Brazil; Reminiscences in the Patent Oﬂice. “It [Hydraulics] is
full of the gossip of the art ; it is just such a book as any amateur of mechanics would allow
to be open on his table for the purpose of passing the little fragments of his time in occu-
pations of a light and useful description.” -—- London Atheneeum.

Joseph E. Worcester.

JosE1=H E. WORCESTER, LL. D., 17 84-1865, contested with Noah Web-
ster the palm for lexicography. Worcester’s English Dictionary is cer-
tainly one of the best that has ever been written, and by a large portion

FROM 1830 To 1850. 253

of the soundest American scholars is accepted as the best standard of the

English la.nguage.

Dr. Worcester was born in Bedford, N. H. He graduated at Yale, in the class of 1811; was
engaged for some years in teaching; studied for two years in Andover; and in 1820 removed
to Cambridge, where most of his remaining years were spent.

Dr. VVorcester’s ﬁrst publications were in the line of geography and history. He pub-
lished in 1818 A Geographical Dictionary, a Universal Gazetteer, in 2 vols. This was followed
by A Gazetteer of the United States; Elements of Geography, Ancient and Modern; Epitome
of Geography; Sketches of the East and its Inhabitants ; Elements of History, Ancient and
Modern; Epitome of Ilistory; Classical and Scriptural Geography.

His labors in the ﬁeld of lexicography, by which almost exclusively he is now known, .

appear to have been begun with the superintending of a new edition of Johnson in 1828. He
was next employed in making an abridgment of VVebster’s large work, after which he began
to labor on his own account as an independent lexicographer, his labors culminating in 1846
in his Universal and Critical Dictionary of the English Language, large Svo.

Dr. Worcester still labored at his work, revising and making additions, until 1860, when
it appeared as a royal quarto of 1843‘pages. In this, its _ﬁnal form, it has been the compet-
itor of Webster.

Dr. Worcester’s work is published in six different forms, from the small Primary up to the
Royal Quarto. There is also a Series of Spellers, prepared by Dr. Worcester, on the same
principles as the Dictionary.

Dr. Worcester’s work is the fruit of long years of unremitted and conscientious labor, and
is in the highest degree creditable to his scholarship and his critical Sagacity.

CHAUNCEY A. Goonmcn, D.D., 1790-1860, was a native of New Haven and a graduate of Yale,
andafterwards Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory in the same. An important service ren-
dered by him to the cause of literature was his labor bestowed upon editing, revising, and
perfecting Webster’s Dictionary. .

Dr. Goodrich was a son-in—law of Webster, and naturally was interested in making this

great work as perfect an exponent as possible of the present state of English lexicography.
The Dictionary in its present state is a great improvement upon the original work of Dr.
VVebster, and for the series of changes and additions by which this improvement has been
brought about, we are largely indebted to Prof. Goodrich, though he died before the work
received its ﬁnal form in the Revised Edition of 1864:. The part contributed speciﬁcally by
him was the portion on Synonyms. He effected also a modiﬁcation of the extreme views
of Dr. Webster in regard to the spelling and pronunciation—a concession which aided
much in giving the work a general acceptance.
' Dr. Goodrich gave another most valuable contribution to literature in the publication of
a large volume, 947 pp. 8vo, entitled Select British Eloquence, containing the best speeches
entire of the most eminent orators of Great Britain for the last two centuries, with sketches
of their lives, an estimate of their genius, and notes critical and explanatory. The biographi—
cal and critical matter in this work contains the substance of the author’s lectures on the
English orators. '

“This bulky volume performs more than it premises. It is not only a collection, made
with excellent taste and judgment, of the best specimens of English eloquence, whet-her
parliamentary, forensic, or popular, but the biographical and illustrative matter annexed is
copious enough to form a tolerably complete political history of England from Queen Anne‘s
time to the present day. At any rate, a full acquaintance with the contents of this volume,
taking the speeches and the commentary together, would be a very useful appendage to
that knowledge of the political events of the period which may be derived from works pro«
fessedly historical or biographical in their character.” —1V0rth Ame7'z'c0L'n Review.

Professor Marsh.

GEORGE P. MARSH, L L. 1);, 1801 , has bestowed much labor upon
the study of English philology. His Lectures on the English Language,

and Lectures on Early English Literature, are standard Works on that
sub} ect.

Prof. Marsh is a native of Woodstock, Vt., and a graduate of Dartmouth. He is a lawyer
by profession, but has spent a large part of his life in foreign diplomacy. He was Resident
Minister of the United States at Constantinople, f.rom 1849 to 1858. Since 1861 he has been
U-nited States Minister to Italy. He has been a diligent student of language and philology,
and his publications on linguistic and literary subjects are in high repute.

Prof. Marsh’s works are Lectures on the English Language; the Origin and History of
the English Language, and of the Literature which it embodies; Man and Nature, or Physi-
cal Geography Modiﬁed by Human Action; A Compendious Grammar of the Icelandic, com-
piled from Rask; The Camel, his Organization, Habits, and Uses. This last mentioned
volume was intended to facilitate the introduction of the camel as a means of transporta-
tion over the desert plains in the south—western part of the United States. The iron horse,
however, has been found a better freight-bearer.

Prof. Marsh’s two volumes on the English Language entitle him to a prominent place in
its literature. They are the fruits of original reading and study, and are marked by breadth
of View and soundness of judgment.

WILLIAM CHAUNCEY FOWLER, LL.D., 1793 -—-, is known. by his elaborate and able works
on the grammar of the English language. '

Dr. Fowler was born in Clinton, Conn. He graduated at Yale, in the class of 1816. He
was for ﬁve years Tutor at Yale; eleven years Professor of Chemistry and Natural History
in Middlebury; and ﬁve years Professor of Rhetoric in Amherst.

After leaving Amherst, he occupied himself mainly with literary labor. His published
works are the following: The English Language in its Elements and Forms, 8vo, an elabo-
rate treatise, on the basis of Latham; Elementary English Grammar; English Grammar for
Schools; lVIemorials of the Chaunceys; The Sectional Controversy, a passage in the political
history of the United States; A History of Durham, Co11n.; and numerous pamphlets,
addresses, etc.

Dr. Fowler married a daughter of Noah Webster, the lexicographer, and has bestowed
much labor in preparing for the press various editions of Webster’s Dictionary.

CORNELIUS C. FELTON, LL. D., 1807-1862, was one of the most eminent Greek scholars that
America has yet produced. He was a native of Massachusetts, and a graduate of Harvard.
He became Tutor in that institution in 1829, Professor of Greek in 1834, and ﬁnally Presi-
dent in 1860. He published critical editions of I-1omer’s Iliad; Panegyrics of Isocrates; The
Clouds and The Birds, of Aristophanes; The Agamemnon, of Eschylus; also, A Greek
Reader. He contributed more than ﬁfty articles to the North American Review, besides
numerous articles in the Christian Examiner, and the Bibliotheca Sacra. He wrote also
Greece, Ancient and Modern, 2 vols., a course of Lectures before the Lowell Institute. Prof.
Felton wrote several articles also for Appleton’s Cyclopaedia, among them those on Agassiz.
Athens, Attica, Demosthenes, Euripedes, and Homer.

JOSIAH WILLARD GIBBS, LL. D., 179041861, an eminent philologist, was born at Salem, Mass.
He graduated at Yale, in the class of 1809 ; was Tutor there from 1811 to 1815 ; and Profes-
sor of Sacred Literature in the T11e.()1ogica.l SUIllll'l.'L‘.‘y, fr:>m 1824 to 1861. His works are the
following : A Translation of Storr’s Historical Sense of the New Testament ; A Translation

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 255

of Gesenius’s Hebrew Lexicon; A Manual Hebrew and English Lexicon, abridged from
Gesenius; Pliilological_Studies; Latin Analyst; besides contributions to the revised edition
of Webster’s Dictionary, and to Fowler’s English Language.

Dr. Taylor of Andover.

SAMUEL H. TAYLOR, LL. D., 1807-1871, known all over the land as the
Principal of Phillips Academy, at Andover, Mass., comes nearer perhaps
than any other American has done, to the world-famous Arnold of Rugby.

Dr. Taylor did so great a work as a teacher that it dwarfs him to speak of his authorship.
His work in the ﬁeld of letters however was respectable. He prepared A Guide for Writing
Latin, being a translation from the German of Krebs. In connection with Dr. B. B. Edwards,
he translated K1'ihner’s G-reek Grammar, and he compiled from it An Elementary Greek
Grammar. He wrote A Method of Classical Study, and a work called Classical Study, con-
sisting, of extracts from the opinions of eminent men in regard to the value of classical
studies, with an introduction by himself. He also aided in editing the Bibliotheca Sacra,
and wrote for it.

What he did in these several works was done with the most scholarly accuracy, and has
been of use in promoting accurate scholarship in others. But the great work of his life
was done in the school-room, on the minds of the six thousand pupils who during a period
of thirty-four years came under the direct magnetism of his powerful mind.

Dr. Taylor was born in the old township of Londonderry, N. 11., and was of Scotch—Irish
descent. He was graduated at Dartmouth, in the class of 1832; studied theology at Andover;
was Tutor for a time at Dartmouth; became Principal of the famous Phillips Academy at
Andover in 1837, and retained the position until his death in 1871.

Charles Anthon.

CHARLES ANTHON, LL. D., 1797-1867, is known almost exclusively by
his series of Greek and Latin text-books. He stands in this line at the
head of American scholars.

Prof. Anthon was a native of the city of New York, and for a long time Professor of An-
cient Languages in Columbia College. As already stated, he is widely known by his Greek
and Latin school-books, his editions of classical authors for school and college use, and his
large works on Greek and Roman Antiquities, Ancient and Mediaeval Geography, his Clas-
sical Dictionary, etc., amounting in all to about 50 vols. The series has been very popular.
The preparation of it required varied and extensive learning and a vast amount of labor.
The use of his editions as text-books has been objected to on the ground of their furnishing
the student with undue facilities, the “notes ” being for the most part equivalent to a trans-
lation. Dr. Anthon never travelled into any of the walks of authorship outside of his own
chosen path as a writer and commentator in aid of classical scholarship. But in that walk
he has won for himself a distinguished and honorable name.

E'ri{AN ALLEN ANDREWS, LL. D., 1787-1858, a native of Connecticut and a graduate of Yale,
and at one time Professor of Ancient Languages in the University of North Carolina. Espe-
cially known as the author of a comprehensive Latin-English Dictionary, founded on the
great German work of Freund. He is also the author of a Latin Grammar, Latin Lessons,
and numerous other elementary classical school-books.

256 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

JOHN J. OWEN, D. D., 1803-1869, the well known Professor of Greek and Latin in the Free
Academy of New York city, was born at Kingsborough, N. Y., and graduated at Middlebury
College, in the class of 1828. He studied theology at Andover. He has published several
text-books of Greek authors, which have had a large sale : Xenophon’s Anabasis, Xenophon’s
Cyropaedia, Thucydides, and Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. Besides these, he has published
some valuable commentaries on portions of the Bible: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, and
Acts.

CHARLES T. FOLLEN, I. U. D., 1796-1840, was a native of I-Iesse-Darmstadt, Germany. He
was an advanced liberal in his opinions, and being proscribed by the Holy Alliance, he made
his escape to the United States, where he ﬁrst obtained employment through the interpo-
sition of Lafayette. He became Professor of German in Harvard University. He perished
in the burning of tlie Lexington, on L. I. Sound, in 1840. He published a German Gram-
mar, German Reader, and wrote various articles and reviews. His works, in 5 vols., were
edited by his widow.

MRS.ELIZA LEE (CABOT) FOLLEN, 1787-1859, was a native of Boston, and the wife of Prof. Fol-
len. Besides editing the works of her husband, she published Sketches of Married Life; The
Skeptic; Twilight Stories; Little Songs, and other books for children.

REV. PETER BULLIONS, D. D., 1791—1864, a distinguished teacher and writer of school-books,

was a native of Scotland, but spent the main part of his life in Albany. His school-books
have been numerous, and are of a high order of merit: English, Latin, and Greek Gram-
mar; Latin and Greek Readers; school editions of Caesar, Sallust, Cicero, and Virgil.

GOOLD ‘BROWN, 1791-1857, is well known as awriter on English Grammar. His publications
are First_Lines of English Grammar; Institutes of English Grammar; Grammar of English
Grammars. The latter is intended as a digest of all that has been written on the subject, for
the information of teachers and advanced students; the two former are,text-books for
schools. The books have had a wide sale.

Dr. James Rush.

JAMES RUSH, M. 1)., 1786-1869, is Widely known by his work on The
Philosophy of the Human Voice.

Dr. Bush was a native of Philadelphia, and son of the celebrated Dr. Benjamin Rush. Dr.
James Rush led the life of a recluse, a consumer rather than a producer of books. He was

a. man of keen and decided, but rather eccentric mental powers, and stood opposed, in many '

particulars, to the spirit of his age and his country. One of his chief aversions was the
daily newspaper, which he considered the great demoralizer of sound thinking and correct
spelling. The only work of his that is at alliknown is his treatise on the Philosophy of
the Human Voice, which has gone through six editions. It is considered by competent
critics to be not only a standard work but thoroughly exhaustive of the subject. It has
been made tl1e basis for a large number of popular and school treatises.

By his will, Dr. Rush left his estate of more than a million dollars to the Philadelphia
Library, but the gift unfortunately is coupled with such severe, not to say absurd, conditions
that the Library will probably be unable to accept it.

WILLIAM RUSSELL, 1798 , the well—known elocutionist, is a native of Glasgow, Scotland,
and a graduate of the University of that city. He began teaching in Augusta, Ga., in 1817.
He was afterwards Principal of an Academy in Savannah, and then of the Latin School,
New Haven, Conn.; Instructor in Elocution in Boston, Cambridge, and Andover; Principal

 

FROM 1880 '.ro.1850. 257

of Merrimack Normal Institute, N. H.; Director of the New England Normal Institute, Lan-
caster, Mass. He has published several valuable school-books, chieﬂy on elocution: Ameri-
can Elocutionist; Orthophony, or the Culture of the Voice; Elements of Musical Articu-
lation; Lessons in Enunciation; Vocal Culture; Rudiments of Gesture; Pulpit Elocution;
Grammar of Composition, etc. “ Mr. Russell has been well known for thirty years or more
as an elocutionist of rare taste, skill, and power, and as an eminently eﬂicient teacher.” -
A. I’. Peabody, N. A. Rev.

ANDREW CoMs'rocK, M. D., 1795 , attained considerable notoriety as an Elooutionist and
8.1; ihe inventor of a system of Phonetics. He published New System of Phonetics ; Phonetic

Speaker; Phonetic Reader; Phonetic New Testament; Elocution, etc. He was a native of .

New York, but resided in Philadelphia.

RICHARD GREEN PARKER, 1798 ——, son of the late Bishop Parker, was born in Boston, and
graduated at Cambridge in the class of 1817. After teaching i11 several other places, he was
placed, in 1827, at the head of one of the public grammar—schools of Boston, i11 which posi-
tion he continued over thirty years. From 1853 to 1858 he had a private school for young
ladies. Mr. Parker has made several valuable contributions to the literature of his profes-
sion. His school-books, which are numerous, have been creditable specimens of taste
and scholarship, and have been eminently successful. The following are the chief: Pro-
gressive Exercises in English Composition; Aids to English Composition; Progressive

Exercises in English Grammar; Progressive Exercises in Rhetorical Reading, changed after- ,

wards to The Rhetorical Reader; School Compendium of Natural and Experimental Philos-
ophy; Outlines of General History; and, in connection with J. M. Watson, a complete series
of Readers, called The National Readers, and often familiarly quoted as the Parker and Wat-
son Readers.

VII. THEO LOGICAL VVRITERS.

Archibald Alexander.

ARCHIBALD ALEXANDER, D. D., 177 2—l851, holds a position altogether
unique among American Presbyterians. He may not have been their
greatest theologian, as he certainly was not their greatest Writer; yet, by
the peculiarities both of his position and of his personal character, he
wielded an inﬂuence altogether unprecedented in this branch of the Ameri-

can Church. -

. Dr. Alexander was born near Lexington, Rockbridge County, Va. He was educated
mainly by the Rev. William Graham, at Liberty 1Iall, afterwards Washington College, and
now VVashington—Lee University, at Lexington. After preaching a few years, he became, in
1796, President of Hampden Sidney College. In 1807 he became pastor of the Old Pine Street
Presbyterian church, Philadelphia; and, in 1812, when the Theological Seminary at Princeton
was instituted, he was appointed its ﬁrst Professor, in which oﬁice he remained until his death.

Dr. Alexander was a man of wonderful power as a preacher. In this respect he probably
has never been excelled by any American divine. As the leading Professor in the Theologi-
cal Seminary at Princeton for nearly forty years, and during the formative period of that
great religious denomination of which the Seminary was the acknowledged centre and
representative, he did more probably than an 3* other one man towards giving tone and shape
to the Presbyterian Church in the United States.

In addition to his work as a preacher and as a theological teacher, Dr. Alexander, "after

22 * R

258 AMERICAN LITERA’l‘URE.

his accession to the chair at Princeton, was almost always busy with his pen, and his con-
tributions to religious literature, most of them too of a popular cast, were numerous and
varied. From 1829 to 1850 scarcely a number of the Princeton Review appeared without an
article from his pen. No less than seventy-seven articles are enumerated as his, being
enough to ﬁll several large volumes. _

Of "Dr. Alexander’s separate publications, the following are specially worthy of mention :
Evidences of Christianity; The Canon of Scripture; Outlines of Moral Science; Practical
Truths; Thoughts on Religious Experience; Advice to a Young Christian; Counsels from
the Aged to the Young; Bible Dictionary; History of the Patriarchs ; Annals of the Jewish
Nation; History of African Colonization; History of the Log College. A volume of his
Sermons also has been published.

The chief characteristics of Dr. Alexander’s style are simplicity and clearness. He had
pondered the great themes upon which he wrote until their truths had become axiomatic
to himself, and he unconsciously communicated something of the same character to his
expression of them. He was remarkable also for his pure, idiomatic English. In his extem-
pore addresses from the pulpit, Dr. Alexander was often highly imaginative. But little of
this quality appears in any of his written discourses.

Of all Dr. Alexander’s writings, the ones which have made the deepest impression on the
public mind are those on the Evidences, the Canon, and Religious Experience. His maturest

work is the small volume on Moral Science. It is of this that the Westminster Review, no I

friendly witness, says: “It is a calm, clear stream of abstract reasoning, ﬂowing from a
thoughtful, well-instructed mind, without any parade of logic, but with an intuitive sim-
plicity and directness which gives it an almost axiomatic force.” ‘

Dr. Alexander was married to J anetta Waddel, daughter of the celebrated Dr. Waddel, the
“Blind Preacher,” described in such glowing terms by William Wirt in the British Spy.

James Alexander.

J AMES WADDELL ALEXANDER, D. D., 1804-1859, eldest son of the pre-
ceding, is widely known as an accomplished scholar and graceful writer,
and as the author of a large number of works on religion and morals.

Like his father and his brother Addison, James Alexander is associated in the public mind
with the Princeton school of theology and letters, though most of his public career was
spent elsewhere. He was born in Louisa County, Va., and graduated at Princeton, in the
class of 1820. He was at different times Professor in the College and in the Theological
Seminary at Princeton, and Pastor in Charlotte Court-House, Va., in Trenton, N. J ., and in
New York city.

Dr. Alexander’s pen was seldom idle. Whether ﬁlling the pastoral oﬂice or the Professor’s
chair, he always had some literary work in hand. He wrote constantly for the Princeton
Review, his contributions to it numbering one hundred and one, being suﬁicient to ﬁll sev-
eral large Volumes. He wrote frequently also for the weekly and daily papers. He was the
author of more than thirty juvenile works, written mostly for the American Sunday-School
Union. Among these may be named Infant Library, Frank Harper, Carl the Young Emi-
grant, Only Son, Scripture Guide. In connection with his brother Addison, he prepared for
that society A Geography of the Bible. He wrote for them also The American Sunday-
School and its Adjuncts. Some of his other publications are Thoughts on Family Worship,
A Gift to the Aﬁlicted, Consolation, and Plain Words to a Young Communicant. He pre-
pared also a Biography of his father, Dr. Archibald Alexander, a large 8vo, of 700 pages.
Many of his writings were aimed particularly at the improvement of the condition of the
workingmen. One of these, the American Mechanic and Workingman, is held in high
estimation. Another deservedly popular book of somewhat the same cast is called Good,
Better, Best.

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 259

Dr. Alexander was pre-eminently a scholarly man in his tastes and habits, being pro-
foundly versed in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, and in three or four modern languages; yet
in his books for popular reading there is not the slightest hint of all this varied learning.
His English is as pure and limpid as if he had never known any language but his own.

Addison Alexander.

JosE1>H ADDISON ALEXANDER, D.D., 1809-1860, is on the whole the
greatest of the remarkable family to which he belongs. Though born in
Philadelphia, all his public life and Writings are associated with Princeton,
where for many years, as a Professor in the Theological Seminary, and still
more through his writings, he wielded a prodigious influence over the World
of opinion.

Addison’ s special department was that of oriental literature. But he was
great in almost every department of letters, and his contributions to English
literature alone would entitle him to prominent rank, had he no other claim
to greatness.

He was Adjunct Professor of Ancient Languages in Princeton College
from 1830 to 1838, and a Professor in the Theological Seminary from 1888
to the time of his death.

He Wrote several articles for Walsh’s American Quarterly Review, and
occasionally for other periodicals weekly and monthly. But most of his
contributions to periodical literature were made to the Princeton Review,
of which he was one of the main supports. VVith the single exception of
Dr. Hodge, no one of the Princeton writers did so much as Addison Alex-
ander to give this famous Review its world-wide celebrity. His articles,
ninety-two in number, are not quite so numerous as those of his brother
James, but they are of much greater value and importance. Among them
are many which for brilliancy, power, and scope, may well be named with
those of Macaulay, Jeffrey, and Sidney Smith.

His power of sarcasm was unequalled; and when he began writing for
the Review, he seems to have thought that there were certain ecclesiastical
and theological assumptions (then aﬂoat which needed to be met with wit
rather than argument, and whose authors deserved punishment rather than
refutation. He castigated them accordingly, and with merciless severity.
It is to be observed, however, that after the ﬁrst few years, he rarely in-
dulged in this vein. If the fact of his abstaining was due to a growing con-
viction that a different line of controversy was better suited to the proprie-
ties of theological discussion, the fact does credit to his conscientiousness.
Few temptations are harder to resist than the temptation to use sarcasm
and ridicule, when one has manifestly been gifted with these powerful
Weapons. The shafts which he sent were not only keenly pointed, but were
hurled with a force which it was next to impossible to resist. Few oppo-

nents, in or out of the church, could have stood up against the terrible
weapon which seemed ever lying within reach of his ﬁngers, and which
yet, ‘during the last twenty years of his life, he forebore entirely to employ.

Of a man gifted with such a rare combination of great qualities, it is not
easy to say which was the greatest. It was as a linguist, however, that he
is generally considered as most distinguished. He was perfect master of
seven languages, English, Latin, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and
Portuguese, all of which he knew not only philologically, but linguistically

———reading, writing, and speaking them with easeyand ﬂuency. He knew .

profoundly, as a philologist, six others, Arabic, Hebrew, Chaldee, Persian,
Greek, and Romaic, all of which he read and wrote ﬂuently, without help,
but did not speak, at least not familiarly. He was ‘at home with eight
others, Dutch, Danish, Flemish, Norwegian, Sanscrit, Ethiopic, Syriac, and
Coptic, reading them without a Lexicon, but not writing. or speaking them.
He read with a Lexicon four others, Polish, Swedish, Malay, and Chinese.
In all, twenty-ﬁve diﬂerent languages. He was unquestionably the greatest
oriental scholar that America has ever produced.

As his greatest attainments were in the line of languages, so his most im-
portant works are his Commentaries. These are the following: On Psalms,
2 vols.; Isaiah, 2 vols.; Matthew, 1 vol.; Mark, 1 vol. ; Acts, 2 vols. Next
to his commentaries, are his Sermons, 2 vols., and New Testament Litera-
ture, and Ecclesiastical History, 1 vol. ’

His articles in the Princeton Review, however, give the best idea of the
wonderful variety and depth of his attainments, as well as of the versatility
of his’ genius. He was a signal proof that the study of languages, even
when pushed to their _most abstruse points, does not necessarily make one
dry and dull. The United States probably never produced a scholar of
more secluded and solitary habits. Yet his writings and his pulpit dis-
courses were as simple and perspicuous as if he had been a mere English
scholar. His sentences are as limpid in their flow, and glide as gently a.nd
smoothly into the reader’s understanding, as those of the Joseph Addison
after whom he was named. This wonderful simplicity, both of his thoughts
and his language, combined often witha fervid eloquence, and always with
profound and comprehensive views, made his pulpit performances exceed-
ingly attractive. He had, too, a warm and vigorous imagination, to which
in his sermons he sometimes gives the rein with startling effect. His style
is always rhythmical, showing that he had a natural ear for verse, and he
has given some specimens of poetry of a high order.

Among his other traits was a strong love of fun, and he often amused
himself, by way of relaxation from his profounder studies, by writing hu-
morous pieces for the young children of his acquaintance. Sometimes he

Wrote to these little folks long letters in rhyme, but making them in the form.

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 261

of prose. At other times, he amused himself by describing some familiar
event in language utterly unintelligible, although every word was taken
from Webster’s quarto dictionary. Another of his amusements was to write
sonorous periods, faultless in diction and grammar, and apparently very
profound, which however, on eXamination,'were found to be entirely devoid
of meaning. Indeed his love of poking good-natured fun at men and things
was one of his most striking characteristics, and there is no doubt that he
might have become famous as a humorist, had he not been drawn to higher
things. An admirable Biography of him has been written by his nephew.

THE DOOMED MAN.

There is a time, we know not when,
A point, we know not where,

That marks the destiny of men
To glory or despair.

There is a line, by us unseen,
That crosses every path;

The hidden boundary between
God’s patience and his wrath.

To pass that limit is to die,
To die as if by stealth;

It does not quench the beaming eye,
Or pale the glow of health.

The conscience may be still at ease,
The spirits lightand gay;

That which is pleasing still may please,
And care be thrust away.

But on that forehead God has set
Indelibly a mark,

Unseen by man, for man as yet
Is blind and in the dark.

And yet the doomed man’s path below
Like Eden may have bloomed;

He did not, does not, will not know
Or fee1'that he is doomed.

He knows, he feels, that all is Well,
And every fear is calmed,

He lives, he dies, he wakes in hell,
Not only doomed, but damned.

0 where is this mysterious bourn,
By which our path is crossed,

Beyond which, God himself hath sworn,
‘That he who goes ‘is lost?

How far may we go on in sin?
How long will God forbear?

‘Where does hope end, and where begin
The conﬁnes of despair?

An answer from the skies is sent:
“Ye that from God depart,

While it is called TO—DAY repent,
And harden not your heart.”

BE STILL, AND KNOW THAT I AM GOD.

When fortune smiles and friends abound;
When all my fondest hopes are crowned;
When earth with her exhaustless store,
Seems still intent to give thee more;
When every wind and every tide
Contribute to exalt thy pride;

When all the elements conspire

To feed thy covetous desire;

When foes submit and envy stands

Pale and abashed with folded hands;
While i'ame’s unnumbered tongues prolong
The swell of thy triumphal song;

Vfhen crowds admire and worlds applaud,
“Be still, and know that I am God.”

When crowns are sported with, and thrones
Are rocked to their foundation stones;
Vxhen nations tremble and the earth
Semis big with some portentous birth;
W'hen all the ties of social life

Are severed by intestine strife;

When human blood begins to drip
From tyranny’s accursed whip;

W'hen peace and order ﬁnd their graves
In anarchy’s tempestuous waves; '
W’hen every individual hand

Is steeped in crime, and every land

Is full of violence and fraud;

“ lie still, and know that I am God.”

When to the havoc man has made
The elements afford their aid;

"When nature sickens, and disease
Rides on the wing of every breeze;
When the tornado in -its ﬂight

Blows the alarm and calls to ﬁght;
VVhen raging Fever leads the van

In the ﬁerce onslaught upon man;
When livid Plague and pale Decline
And bloated Dropsy form the line;
W'hile hideous Madness, shivering Fear,
And grim Despair bring up the rear;
When these thy judgments are abroad:
“be still, and know that I am God.”

When messages of grace are sent,
And Mercy calls thee to repent;

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 263

When through a cloud of hopes and fears
The Sun of Righteousness appears ;
VVhen thy reluctant heart delays

To leave its old accustomed ways;
When pride excites a storm within,
And pleads and ﬁghts for every sin;
Be still, and let this tumult cease;

Say to thy raging passions, “ Peace!”
By love subdued, by judgment awed:
“Be still, and know that I am God.”

MONOSYLLABICS;

Think not that strength lies in the big round Word,‘
Or that the brief and plain must needs be weak.
To whom can this seem true, that once has heard
The cry for help, the tongue that all men speak,
When want or woe or fear is in the throat,
So that each Word gasped out is like a shriek
Pressed from the sore heart, or a strange wild note,
Sung by some fay or ﬁend. There is a strength
Wliicli dies if stretched too far or spun too ﬁne,
Which has more height than breadth, more depth than length.
Let but this force of thought and speech be mine,
And he that will may take the sleek fat phrase,
Whicl’1 glows and burns not, though it gleam and sl1ine—
Light, but no l1eat—a ﬂash, but not a blaze!

DIAGNOSIS OF THE I AND THE NO'.l_‘—I.

Assuming as we safely may that all the reﬂex actings of the rational idea towards the
pole of semi-unity are naturally complic-ated.with a tissue of non—negatiVe impressions,
which can only be disintegrated by a process of spontaneous and intuitive abstraction, it
inevitably follows, as a sel f-sustaining corollary, that the isolated and connatural conceptions,
formed in this antespeculative stage of intellectual activity, must be reﬂected on the faculty
itself, or, to speak with philosophical precision, on the I, when received concretely as the
N ct-I ; and in this reciprocal self-reproduction, carried on by the direct and transverse
action of the Reason and the Understanding, modiﬁed of course by those extraneous and
illusory perceptions, which can never be entirely excluded from the mutual relations of the
pure intelligence on the one hand and the mixed operations of the Will and the imagination
on the other, may be detected, even by an infant-eye, the true solution of this great philo-
sophical enigma, the one sole self-developing criterion of the elementary difference between
the Not-I and the I. ‘

AN ADVENTURE.

During a short outlope, which I took one rafty morning, in my olitory fell, to discover
the. ubication of a vespiary which annoyed me, I saw a tall, wandy, losel lungis, in a leafy
roquelam, thriclding my gate, and knabbing ajannock which I had just before inchested in
my pantry. From his xanthe color I took him for a Zambo poller who had sometimes
shaved me. As it was gang week, I thought he might be maunding, and would willingly
have given him a manchet ; but I was not suﬁch a hodgly-doddy as to suffer every patibulary
querry to go digitigrade about my house and grounds. I mounted my horse, which I had
left to gise on a scavy eyot in the neighboring be.:k during my grassation, and pursued
him, but he seized a clevy and tried to blench the horso’s chauﬁn and to hase him back into

the fell. Failing in this, he began to accoy me, and begged me to employ him as an abacist,
pretending he had served as a lancepesade of infantry in Hayti. But I snebbed and gouged
him, and not wishing tl1c affair to be known to the neighboring clerisy, who were already
not a little roiled by some things I had said too overlashingly, I let the lown go shot-free,
and went home rather lateward, feeling very hebete and curst; but after eating a chewet,
and drinking-a few mozers of perkin, I slumped into the quag and slept till morning.

SAMUEL DAVIES ALEXANDER, D.D., 1819 , ﬁfth son of Dr. Archibald Alexander, was
born at Princeton. ‘ He graduated at the College of New Jersey, in 1838, and studied theol-
ogy in the Seminary at Princeton. After preaching in different places he became, in 1855,
pastor of the Phillips Presbyterian Church, New York. Besides contributing to the Prince-
ton Review, he published, in 1872, avolume, called Princeton College during the Eighteenth
Century, and containing interesting sketches of its principal alumni.

 

Samuel Miller.

SAMUEL MILLER, D. D., 1769-1850, is associated in the minds of all

iPresbyterians with his friend and colleague, ‘Dr. Archibald Alexander.

Besides his great Work, in giving shape and tone at its most critical period,
to theological education in the Presbyterian Church of America, Dr. Miller
contributed largely to the theological and religious literature of his church.
His works are numerous and valuable, and are accepted as standards among
most Presbyterians. '

Dr. Miller was born at Dover, Del., and was graduated at the University of Pennsylvania,
in 1789. He was pastor of the Brick Church, New York, from 1793 to 1813; and Professor
of Ecclesiastical History and Church Government in the Theological Seminary at Princeton
from 1813 until his death.

Dr. Miller was for nearly forty years one of the great lights of Princeton and of the Pres-
byterian Church in the United States. * He and Dr. Archibald Alexander, taken respectively
from the cities of New York and Philadelphia, and holding at the time conspicuous positions
in those leading Presbyterian centres, were selected by the General Assembly as the original
Professors and founders of the ﬁrst Theological Seminary, which has exerted such a pro-
digious inﬂuence on,the Presbyterian Church. A n1ore happy selection probably was never
ma.de in the founding of any great institution; and the high tone in learning, literature,
theology, and in every kind of earnest practical Christianity, which has marked the later
development of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, may be traced in no small
degree to the personal character of these two remarkable men.

Dr. Miller was ever busy with his pen, and his publications are both numerous and valua-
ble. The following are the chief: A Brief Retrospect of the Eighteenth Century, containing 3.
Sketch of the Revolutions and Improvements in Science, Arts, and Literature in that Period,
published in 1803, in 3 vols., 8vo ; Letters on the Christian Ministry ; Presbyterianism the
Truly Primitive and Apostolic Constitution of the Church of Christ; Letters on Church
Government; Letters on Unitarianism; On the Eternal Sonship of Christ; Office of Ruling
Elder in the Presbyterian Church ; Letters on Clerical Habits and Manners, etc.

The Work last named criticized with singular keenness some of the bad professional
habits into which young ministers are a.pt to fall. The work was not uncalled for, and it
had a marked and happy effect.

An admirable Life of Dr. Miller, in 2 vols. 8vo, has been published by his son, Samuel
Miller, D. D.

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 265

“Dr. Miller came from the training of city life, and from an eminently polished and lite-
rary circle. Of ﬁne person and courtly manners, he set a high value on all that makes
society digniﬁed and attractive. He was pre-eminentlya man of syst.em and method, gov-
erning himself, even in the minutest particulars, by exact rules. His daily exercise was
measured to the moment; and for half a century he wrote standing. He was a gentleman
of the old school, though as easy as he was noble in his bearing,—full of conversation,
brilliant in company, rich in anecdote, and universally admired. As a preacher, he was
clear, without brilliancy, accustomed to laborious and critical preparation, relying little on
the excitement of the occasion, but rapid with his pen, and gifted witha tenacious memory
and a strong, sonorous voice, always instructive, always accurate.”--James W. Alexander.

President Carnahan.

JAMES CARNAHAN, D. D., 1775-1859, President of the College at Prince-
ton from 1823 to 1854, although he published comparatively little, was so
connected with the scholarship, theology, and literature of Princeton during
the time of Dr. Miller, and the Alexanders, that some brief notice of him

is required in this place.

Dr. Carnahan was born near Carlisle, Pa., but spent his youth near Canonsburgh. He
graduated at Princeton in 1800, and was Tutor from 1801 to 1804. After preaching for some
years in Whitesborough and Utica, N. Y., he removed to Georgetown, D. C., and opened
a classical school, which he continued until his election to the Presidency in 1823.

Dr. Carnahan published a few Baccalaureate Discourses, and two articles in the Princeton
Review, all admirable of their kind, and it was hoped that a collection of his Sermons would
appear after his death. But he left directions in his will that none of his manuscripts
should be published. I '

Dr. C-arnahan’s presidency was the longest in the history of the institution.’ W'hen he
came into oiﬁce, in 1823. the Faculty consisted of five members: a President, a Vice-Presi-
dent, a Prof Assor of Mathematics, and two Tutors. When he resigned, it was composed of ﬁf-
teen, ——a President, a Vice~President, six Professors, two Assistant Professors, three Tutors,
a Teacher of Modern Languages, and a Lecturer on Zoology.

“ He had the Sagacity to surround himself at all times with a Faculty equal in ability and
talent to any in the history of the institution. The names of Joseph Henry now of the
Smithsonian Institution, of Stephen Alexander the eminent astronomer, of Dr. Torrey the
botanist, of Professor Guyot, of Albert B. Dod, of J. VV. Alexander, and Dr. Maclean, who
succeeded him in the presidency, will illustrate the character of the Princeton Faculty under
Dr. Carnal1an’s administration. It was probably the period in which the College reached
the greatest prosperity and widest inﬂuence that it had yet known, —-great as had been the
reputation and ability of the‘ men who from its origin had been called successively to its
headship. An excellent classical scholar, a sound teacher of philosophy and ethics, exem-
plary and consistent in all his conduct, he gave his whole time and talent to the College;
and to his diligence, ﬁdelity, and wisdom, much of this healthful growth of thirty years must
be attributed. A writer in the Cyclopedia of American Literature well remarks: “lie
was less brilliant than his predecessors, but he brought to the service of education a balance
and constancy of solid qualities, and an administrative talent in ﬁnance, which, joined to
proverbial truth and uprightness. made his green old age peculiarly honorable.

“ H is distinguishing attribute of character was practical wisdom. In sound sense, unerr-
ing judgment, few men have excelled him. This made him a successful head in guiding
the College, and governing the youth committed to his charge. He was so modest and un-
pretending a man in all his feelings and habits, that the public were little aware of the

great work he accomplished at Princeton. The whole number of students graduated at
Nassau Hall, from the beginning of the College to his resignation, in 1853, a period of one
hundred and seven years, as stated by Dr. Van Rensselaer from the College records, was
three thousand three hundred and ninety ; and yet during his administration of thirty years
more than half of these gra.dua.ted. He thus conferred the ﬁrst degree upon a larger num-
ber of alumni than all his predecessors had done. It is somewhat singular that a man with
no great claims to popular eloquence, or preelminence as a preacher, should have done such
a Work as this, in a position which for more than seventy years l1ad been adorned with a
succession of the greatest pulpit orators in our annals. Still Dr. Carnahan was not without
his attraction in the pulpit, especially to cultivated minds. Though his manner was quiet,
he always inspired the respect and conﬁdence which the consciousness of accurate knowl-
edge gives a man. Tall in person, neither lean nor corpulent, and preaching in the black
gown which was then the fashion at Princeton, he was always heard with attention and in-
terest, and his appearance at Commencements and other public occasions was digniﬁed and
commanding.” —- Leroy J. Halsey.

ALBERT B. DOD, D.D., 1805—l 845, was bornin Mendham, N. J ., and was educated at Prince-
ton, both in the College and the Theological Seminary. He was a.ppointed Professor of
Mathematics in the College in 1830, and he continued to hold that position until the time
of his death. He was a man of brilliant parts, and as a Proi'e:ssor made a profound impres-

C sion upon the generation of students who came within the reach of his inﬂuence, as well as

upon the other Professors of the College and the Seminary. He published nothing, however,
except eleven articles contributed to the Princeton Review, from 1835 to 1845. These were
on the following subjects: Finney’s Sermons; i[4‘inney’s Lectures; Beecher’s Views in The-
ology; Missionary Enterprise in the South Sea Islands; Phrenolo.gy.; ’l‘ranscendentalism,
that part of the article reviewing Cousin, the other part being by James Alexander;
Analytical Geometry; Capital Punishment ; Oxford Architecture ; The Elder Question ;
Vestiges of Creation. “ I have a strong conviction that he had in him rich stores of unde-
veloped resources, which, had it pleased God to prolong his life, would have rendered him
one of the most eminent and useful ministers of our Cliurch.”-—Dr. C’/’Lcw'Zes Ifoclge.

Albert Barnes.

REV. ALBERT BARNES, 1798-1870, is chieﬂy known by his Commen-
taries on the Scriptures. These Commentaries have been the most popular
probably that have ever been published. “ Barnes’ s Notes” is a household
Word Wherever, in Protestant Christendom, the English language is spoken.
The number of volumes of the series issuedbefore his death was over a million.

Mr. Barnes (he steadily refused the D. D.) was a native of the State of New York and a
graduate of Hamilton College. His theological education was received at Princeton, though
in some respects his opinions differed from those of the Princeton school of theology, He
began his ministry in Morristown, N. J., but was settled in the First Church in Philadel-
phia in 1830, and continued to make that city his residence until his death in 1870,

Among the earliest, of Mr. Barncs‘s publications was a Work on The Atonement, which
led to much discussion, his views being sharply criticized by the Princeton Reviewers and
others of the Old School. He also took early ground against slavery, in two publications,
Inquiry into the Scriptural Views of Slavery, and The Church and Slavery. Among his
miscellaneous works are Sermons on Ptevivals, Practical Sermons for Vacant Congregations,
Prayers for Family Worship, etc. Ilis chief work, however, is his Notes on the Scriptures.
He began by preparing Flotes on the lospcl-r, for the use especially of Sunday-school

teachers. After completing the Gospels, he wrote on, commenting upon one book after
another, until he had gone over nearly the whole of the sacred volume.

“Mr. Barnes’s style is plain, simple, and direct; and though his pages teem with the
mcztcriel of deep scholarship, yet he is, for the most part, eminently happy, in making hi1n-
self intelligible and interesting to every class ; while the rich practical remarks, every now

Robert J. Breckinridge.

ROBERT JEFFERSON BREOKINRIDGE, D.D., LL. D., 1800—1871, was a
Presbyterian divine of great eminence as a writer, and still more as a leader.
His chief work is a system of theology, under the title of The Knowledge
of God, Objectively and Subjectively Considered. He was one of the ac-
knowledged leaders i.n the great disruption of the Presbyterian Church,
which took place in 1837.

Dr. Breckinridge‘ was born at Cabell’s Dale, near Lexington, Ky. His father, Hon. John
Breckinridge, a distinguished lawyer of that State, was at one time Attorney-(leneralof the
United States, under Jefferson. His mother was of the well—known Cabell family of Vir-
ginia, and was a woman of great strength of character. He went to Princeton College, then
to Yale, and ﬁnally graduated at Union, in his twentieth year, and under the Presidency of
Dr. Nott. He began public life as a lawyer and a politician, and his talents were of that
kind which could hardly have failed to lead to high political distinction. But after con-
tinuing about eight years in the practice of the law, he became an earnest Christian, and
thenceforward, to the end of life, he consecrated his great talents without reserve to the
work of the Christian ministry. While preparing himself for this work, he spent some time
at Princeton, in connection with the Theological Seminary.

1n 1832, Dr. Breckinridge became pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore,
and he remained there several years, preaching with great acceptance. His life at Baltimore
was signalized also by a large amount of controversial writing, directed against the Catholics
of that city. The controversy was conducted chieﬂy through The Baltimore Literary and
Religious Magazine, a periodical of marked ability, of which he was the editor and the chief
contributor.

In the discussions which led to the disruption of the Presbyterian Church in 1837, Dr.
Breckinridge took an active and prominent part, being one of the acknowledged leaders of
the Old School party. -

In 1845, he became President of Jefferson College, in Western Pennsylvania, in which post
he remained two years. He then became pastor of the Third Presbyterian Church in Lex-
ington, Ky., and after a time was made, by popular election, Superintendent of Public
Schools in the State.

In 1853, when the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church established a Theological
Seminary at Danville, Ky., Dr. Breckinridge \x'a§ made Professor of Didactic and Polemic
Theology in the new institution. He continued to ﬁll this oﬂice with great eﬂiciency and
acceptance for a number of years.

A few years before his death, his health being impaired, he resigned his Professorship, and
withdrew almost entirely from public affairs, both secular and religious.

S His works, mostly theological, are the following: Internal Evidence of Christianity ; The
Knowledge of God, objectively considered; The Knowledge of God, subjectively considered;
Travels in France, Germany, etc,; Memoranda of Foreign Travel ; and numerous pamphlets
and articles on the current topics of the day —— Slavery, Temperance, Presbyterianism, etc ’

268 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Dr. Breckinridge’s chief characteristics as a writer are clearness and force, the result, evi-
dently, of strong and assured convictions. He was a man of compreliensive views and gen-
erous impulses, and was thoroughly in earnest in the great questions which he undertook to
handle. He particularly excelled in debate, and he has had few equals on the ﬂoor of the
General Assembly. His character was thus summed up by Dr. Thornwell : " What Dr.
Breckinridge does, he does with his might; when he loves, he loves with his whole soul;
when he hates, he hates with equal cordiality ; and when he ﬁghts, he wants a clear ﬁeld,
and nothing to do but to ﬁght.”

JOHN BRECKINRIDGE, D. D., 1797-1841, brother of Robert, was considered the equal of the
latter, and exercised while he lived a like commanding inﬂuence in the Church. But his
labors were conﬁned mostly to the pulpit and the platform. Ilis writings were compara-
tively few, and were by no means commensurate with his general standing and his acknowl-
edged abilities. His chief publication was a volume containing the report of the controversy
between him and Bishop Hughes.

numerous. His principal volumes are Interviews Memorable and Useful,
Theopneuston, and Quakerism not Cliristiaiiity.

Dr. Cox was born at Leesville, N. J., of Quaker parents, but at the age of twenty he con-
nected himself with the Presbyterian Church. At the same time he abandoned the study
of the law, which he had begun, and concluded to devote himself to the work of the Chris-
tian ministry. He preached for thirteen years in New York city; was then for a time Pro-
fessor of Sacred Rhetoric in the Auburn Theological Seminary; preached in Brooklyn for
the next nineteen years, when he was obliged to desist from public speaking on account of
loss of voice. He was then for some years President of Ingham University.

Dr. Cox took aprominent part in the discussions which led to the division of the Presby-
terian Church, throwing his inﬂuence i11 with the New School party.

He has been industrious with his pen, though he has made comparatively few books. His
communications with the public have been mostly through the religious weekly papers, or
by pamphlets. He was_ one of the originators of the New York Observer, and has been a
frequent contributor to its columns. One of his pamphlets, On Regeneration, created con-
siderable noise. .It was criticized with much severity by Dr. Hodge in the Princeton
Review. ,

Dr. Cox published a book, Quakerism not Christianity, or Reasons for renouneing the
Doctrines of Friends, in which he gives some account of his own early experience. Another
of his volumes, called ’_l_‘heopneuston, or Select Scriptures Considered, is a work inteirled for
the use of Bible Classes and Sunday-School Teachers. One ofhis latest works is Interviews
Memorable and Useful, from Diary and Memory Reproduced.

Dr. Cox has always been something of a‘humorist, and on receiving in 18:73 the degree of

D.D., he addressed a letter to the New York Observer, declining the honor, and ridiculing .

the whole system, ——calling the D. D.’s “ semi-lunar fardels.” After a time, however, be sub-
mitted to the inﬂiction, and even accepted the three additional letters that grace his hen-
ored name.

One of the peculiarities of Dr. Cox’s style, especially in his pulpit performances, is his
fondness for “dictionary words.” No living preacher probably uses, in his common speech,
so large a percentage of words of Latin origin. He has been known, even in his prayers, to
quote whole sentences from the Latin. With all his peculiarities, however, as a writer and

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 269

a speaker, he has ever been held to be a man of great and original force, and he has ﬁlled a
large space in the public mind.

THOMAS H. SKINNER, D. D., 1791-1871, a distinguished Presbyterian clergyman, was a native

of North Carolina, and a graduate of Princeton, in the class of 1809. He was pastor of the
Arch Street Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, from 1816 to 1832; Professor of Sacred
thetoric in Andover Theological Seminary, from 1832 to 1835; pastor of the Mercer Street
Presbyterian Church, New York, from 1835 to 1818; and Professor of Sacred Rhetoric, etc.,
in the Union Theological Seminary, New York, from 1848 until his death. Dr. Skinner had
great celebrity as a preacher. His writings also are marked with ability. The most im-
portant of them are in the line of his Professorship : Aids to Preaching and Hearing; Vinet’s
Pastoral Theology, translated and edited; Vinet’s I-Iomiletics, translated, with notes; Dis-
cussions in Theology; Thoughts on Evangelizing the World, etc.

GEORGE DUFFIELD, D. D., 1799-1870, was a native of Pennsylvania, and a minister of high
standing in the Presbyterian_Chureh. He belonged during the time of the division to the
New School party. Besides contributing to the religious papers and magazines, he has pub-
lished: Dissertations on the Prophecies; Millennium Defended; Spiritual Life; Obligation
and Perpetuity of the Christian Sabbath; Claims of Episcopal Bishops Examined, etc.

JOEL PARKER, D. D., 1799-1873, a Presbyterian clergyman of -great eminence, was born at
Bethel, Vt., and graduated at Hamilton College, New York, in the class of 1824. I-1e C0111-
menced preaching in 1826, and has been pastor in Rochester, New Orleans, New York, Phil-
adelphia, and Newark, N. J., besides being for two or three years Professor in the Union
Theological Seminary, in New York city. He is settled at present, 1872, in New York. Dr.
Parker has published several volumes of a popular character: Lectures on Universalism;
Morals for a Young Student; Invitation to True Happiness; Courtship and Marriage; Rea-
sonings of a Pastor with the Young of his Flock, etc.

Dr. Thornwell.

JAMES H. THORNVVELL, D.D., LL. D., 1811-1862, has Written largely
on the subject of Systematic Theology, and he is accounted by general con-
sent one of the ablest of recent Presbyterian theologians. His Theological
Works ﬁll six large volumes.

Dr. Thornwell was born in Marlborough District, S. C., and graduated in South Carolina
College, in 1829, with the highest honors of his class. He studied afterwards at Harvard,
and in Europe. At the age of twenty-ﬁve he was elected Professor of Logic and Belles-Let-
tres in South Carolina College. He became subsequently President of the College, and
ﬁnally Professor of Theology in the Theological Seminary at Columbia, with intervals of
pastoral labor in the Presbyterian church at Columbia, and the State Street Church in
Charleston.

Dr. Thornwell was a man of varied learning and persuasive eloquence, and one of the
ablest theologians of the Presbyterian Church. Whenever he was a delegate to the General
Assembly, his opinions carried great weight in that body. By his lectures as a theological
Professor, and by his publications, chieﬂy in the Southern Presbyterian Review, he has left
a deep and abiding impress of his character a11d opinions.

A collected edition of his Works has been prepared by his associate, John B. Adger, D.D.,
in 6 vols., large 8vo. Vol. I. is Theological, relating to God and the moral government of the
World; Vol. II. is Theological a11d Ethical, relating to God’s moral government as modiﬁed
by the covenant of grace; Vol. III. is Theological and Controversial, discussing the Canon
and the Authenticity of the Scriptures, and various points at issue between Protestants and
Catholics; Vol. IV. is Ecclesiological ; Vols. V. and VI. are Miscellaneous.

GEORGE BUSH, D.D., 1796-1860, Professor of Hebrew and Oriental Literature in the Uni-
versity of New York, was a man of rare learning and talents. He was a graduate of Dart-
mouth College, and studied theology at Princeton. His principal works are: A Hebrew
Grammar; Commentaries on Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Joshua, Judges, and Numbers, 8
vols.; A Commentary on the Psalms; A Life of Mohammed (written for Harper‘s Family

Dr. Junkin.

GEORGE J UNKIN, D. D., 1790-1868, attained much note as a champion
of the Old School, in the controversy which rent the Presbyterian Church
in 1837. He was the author of several theological Works, and was promi-
nent in the cause of education.

Dr. J unkin was born near Kingston, Cumberland County, Pa. He graduated at Jefferson
College in 1813, and studied theology under Dr. John Mason, in New York city. After sev-
eral years of pastoral labor, he became Principal of the Manual Labor Academy, in German-
town, Pa., and then President of Lafayette College, at Easton, at its organization in 1832.
He was President of Miami University, Ohio, from 1841 to 1844, and then again of Lafay-
ette from 1844 to 1848. From 1848 to 1861 he was President of Washingtoii College, Lex-
ington, Va., but retired on the breaking out of the War.

His remaining years were spent in Philadelphia, without oﬁicial charge. During this
period several of his Works were published. -

North Adams and Pittsﬁeld, in Mass., and at Trenton, N. J. In 1841 he became President
of Lafayette College, at Easton, Pa.; and from 1844 to his death, in 1863, he was pastor
of the Presbyterian church in Danville, Pa. Dr. Yeomans published no books, but was the
author of twenty articles in the Princeton Review.

EDWARD Donn YEOMANS, D. D., 1829-1868, son of the preceding, was born in North Adams,
Berkshire County, Mass., and was educated mostly by his father. He passed through the
Junior year of Lafayette College before he was ﬁfteen. His academic degrees of A. M. and
D.D., were both honorary, and both received from Princeton. He preached in the Warrior
Run Church, Pa., from 1854 to 1858; in the Fourth Church of Trenton, N. J., from 1858 to
1863; in St. Peter’s Church, Rochester, N. Y., from 1863 to 1867; and in Orange, N. J., from
1867 to the time of his death in 1868.

Dr. Yeomans, besides more than usual proﬁciency in Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, was an
accomplished student of the German, and possessed rare skill as a translator. His chief
literary productiveness was in this line. His translations from the German had all the
idiomatic character of original compositions. The works which he translated were Schafl"s
History of the Apostolic Church, Sehaﬁ" ’s History of the Christian Church, Schaﬁ“’s Lectures
on America. He was engaged, at the time of his death, in translating the large volume of
Lange‘s Commentary on J ohn.

Dr. Sprague.

WILLIAM B. SPRAGUE, D. 1)., 1795-1876, was one of the most proliﬁc
Writers in the Presbyterian Church. His Annals of the American Pulpit
especially is a monument of industry and research.

Dr. Sprague was born at Andover, Conn., and graduated at Yale, in the class of 1815. He
studied theology at Princeton. He was pastor in West Springﬁeld, Mass, ten years, from
1819 to 1829; and of the Second Presbyterian Church in Albany forty years, from 1829 to
1869.

Besides a number of contributions to the Princeton Review, he has published by request
no less than 160 Addresses and Sermons on spiritual occasions. His published volumes are
Letters on Practical Subjects to a Daughter; Letters from Europe; Visits to European
Celebrities; Lectures on Revivals; Hints to Regulate the Intercourse of Christians; Lec-
tures Illustrating the Contrast between True Christianity and various other systems; Life
of Edward Dorr Grifﬁn; Letters to Young Men; Words to a Young Man’s Conscience; Aids
to Early Religion; Lectures to Young People; and lastly, Annals of the American Pulpit,
10 vols., large 8V0. This last and greatest work was begun by him at the age of ﬁfty-two,
when most men begin to think of relief from literary labor.

“With industry appalling to weaker men, and perseverance that never fainted, he ad-
dressed himself to the task of rescuing from oblivion the personal history of every individual
minister, of every Christian denomination, from the ﬁrst settlement of this country, whose
usefulness had made him distinguished in the church to which he belonged. The informa-
tion to be wrought into history was mainly to be found by personal inquiry and correspond-
ence. He wrote and received tens of thousands of letters, and all the letters he received
are carefully preserved in volumes. Through seventeen years of steady toil he pursued this
work, at the same time writing fresh sermons every week, fulﬁlling every pastoral duty, visit-
ing his large congregation systematically and more frequently than is common, keeping open
house with a hospitality that had no limit, and never denying himself to calls that became
almost incessant upon a man so distinguished and so generous. Admonished by the advance
of years that he could not expect to have vigor for eiﬁcient pulpit service much longer, he
decided to resign his pastoral charge. This he did towards the close of the year 1869, and
he has now removed to Flushing, N. Y., near the city, where he is passing in digniﬁed
retirement the evening of his useful life. As a preacher, he is earnest, persuasive, affection-
ate, and instructive; as a writer, vigorous, ﬂuent, and elegant; as a man, genial, gentle,

accomplished, loving and beloved; shrinking from public service, yet constantly called into
it; timid as a child, and resolute as a lion, he has the heart of a woman and the head of a
man. His biography will form a ﬁtting conclusion to his own annals of American divines ;
for among them all there never lived a purer or a better man than the subject of this
slietch.”—Prz'nceton Revimv, Index Vol.

NICHOLAS MUR-RAY, D.D., 1802-1861, Was a native of Ireland. He emigrated to America in
1815; was graduated at Williams College in 1826; studied theology at Princeton; was settled
at Wilkesbarre, Pa., in 1829; and went thence in 1833 to Elizabeth, N. J ., where he remained
until his death. He was ever busy with his pen, and wrote several books, besides an almost
weekly contribution for many years to the New York Observer. He took an active part in
the controversy with the Catl1olics,and his best known works are those written on this sub-
ject. He wrote usuallypunder the signature of Kirwan. His chief publications are Letters
to Bishop (afterwards Archbishop) Hughes; The Decline of Popery and its Cause; Romanisxn
at Home, Letters addressed to Chief—Justice Taney; Men and Things, as I saw them in
Europe; Parish and other Pencillings ; The Happy Home; Notes, Historical and Biographi-
cal, respecting Elizabethtown. The work ﬁrst named, Letters by Kirwan to Bishop Ilughes,
had a very large circulation, and was translated into French, Spanish, Italian, German, and
Tamul. Dr. Murray had a sparkling Irish wit, and his writings, even those on theological
controversy, are always brimming with life.

Dr. Spring.

GARDINER SPRING, D. D., LL. D, 1785-1873, was for more than sixty
years a standard-bearer of Presbyterianism in the city of New York. Both
by his ministry and his Writings he wielded a great inﬂuence in the
religious denomination to which he belonged.

Dr. Spring Was born at Newburyport, Mass., and was graduated at Yale, in the class of
1805. After leaving college, he ﬁrst studied law and was admitted to the bar, but afterwards
entered the Andover Theological Seminary and studied for the ministry. He became pastor
of the Brick Church, Presbyterian, in New York city, in 1810, and continued in that
relation until his death. -

Dr. Spring’s publications, mostly on subjects of practical religion, have been numerous.
The following are the chief: Attractions of the Cross; Obligation of the World to the Bible;
The Mercy Seat; First Things; The Glory of Christ; Sermons for the People; The Power
of the Pulpit; The Bible not of Man; The Church in the Wilderness; The Rule of Faith;

Dr. William Nevins, he changed his plans, and in 1827 entered the Theological Seminary at
Princeton. In 1830, he was settled in the Sixth Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, where
he labored for seven years. In 1837, he took charge of the Presbyterian church in Natchez,

Joel Jones.

JOEL JONES, LL.D., 1795-1860, was an eminent jurist of Philadelphia,

but studied and wrote much on theological subjects. His chief Work was a
. large octavo volume, called Jesus and the Coming Glory, in which he ad-

vocated the doctrines of the Second Adventists.

Judge Jones was a native of Coventry, Conn., and a graduate of Yale, where he gained dis-
tinction as a student. Having studied law at Litchﬁeld and New Haven, he settled at Easton,
Pa.,.where he practised for many years. He was appointed Judge in Philadelphia in 1835,
and continued upon the bench until 1848, when he was elected President of Girard College.
On resigning that position two years after, he was elected Mayor of the city, and at the ex-
piration of his term returned to the practice of his profession.

Few judges in the United States have had such eminence as scholars. He was not only
learned in the law, in the highest sense of the word, but was a man of mark in general
scholarship. He read a.nd spoke familiarly most of the languages of modern Europe; he
knew Latin, Greek,and Hebrew almost as if they were living languages. He took an active

8 interest in theological speculations and inquiries, and there were few professed theologians

better informed than he in regard to the current of opinion in biblical exegesis and hermeneu-
tics. lle was an earnest advocate of a literal interpretation of those scriptures which pre-
dict the second advent of Christ.

His law publications consist of his Reports on a Commission to revise the Civil Code of
Pennsylvania, and A Manual of Pennsylvania Land Law. He contributed largely to religious
periodicals,—the Theological and Literary Journal, the Literary and Religious Magazine
of Baltimore, the Spirit of the Nineteenth Century, the Jewish Chronicle, and the Princeton
Review. His largest separate publication was a large octavo, Notes on Scripture, expound-
ing especially those passages in which our Lord speaks of his second coming. The work
has since been printed with the title, Jesus and the Coming Glory.

JOSEPH HUNTINGTON J ONES, D. D., 1797-1868, a brother of J oel Jones, was a native of Cov-
entry, Conn., and a graduate of Harvard. He studied theology at Princeton, and entered
the ministry of the Presbyterian Church. He was settled successively at VVoodbury and

New Brunswick, N. J., and in the Sixth Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, in each of

which pastorates he remained a considerable time and accomplished a large work. The last
few years of his life were spent as Secretary of the Committee for Disabled Ministers. He
wrote an interesting work, The Effects of Physical Causes on Christian Experience; also,
A Memoirof Dr. Ashbel Green, besides some smaller publications.

Lyman Beecher.

LYMAN BEECHER, D. D., 17 75-1863, during his long public career, ex-
erted a commanding inﬂuence in the church and in society. He was
equally celebrated as a preacher and as .a Writer. His Writings are not
numerous, as compared with those of his still more illustrious descendants,
but are marked by great boldness, Vigor, and clearness, both of thought
and expression, Wi.th occasional outbursts of passionate eloquence.

Dr. Beecher was born in New Haven, and graduated under Dr. Dwight. He ﬁrst rose to
eminence as a preacher in Litchﬁeld, Conn., but attained his greatest celebrity in Boston,
where he embarked zealously in the Unitarian controversy, in opposition to the views of
Dr. Channing. He held a conspicuous position also for many years in Cincinnati, as the
Presi<le11t of Lane Theological Seminary. .

As a thinker, Dr. Beecher was bold to the point of audacity, and it was this feature of his
character probably, more than any positive errors, that made him a subject of anxiety to
the more conservative class of theologians. He was one of the earliest and most eloquent
advocates of the temperance movement. His chief publications are the following: Sermons
on Temperance; Views in Theology; Scepticism; Political Atheism; Plea for the West.

JAMES B. WALKER, D. D., 1805 -——, a theological writer of considerable note, was born in

Moses Stuart.

MOSES STUART, 1780-1852, was one of the most eminent biblical scholars
that America has produced, and was the ﬁrst that acquired special distinc-
tion in this department. His publications are both numerous and Varied,
beginning as far back as 1813, and continuing, in an almost uninterrupted
series, down to 1852. Those by which he is most known are his Hebrew
Grammar, and his Commentaries on the Epistles to the Romans and the
Hebrews.

By his long life and his continued activity to the last years of his life, Prof. Stuart con-
nected himself with two distinct generations. He was prominent as a tower of strength
in Andover, in 1820, when his associate, Leonard VVoods, had his celebrated controversy with
the Unitarians of Boston. IIe broke a lance with Daniel "Webster on the Slavery Question
in 1850, and published the last of his series of commentaries in 1852. It has been diﬂicult,
therefore, to decide, in regard both to him and Dr. Woods, in which chapter to place them.
But, on the whole, Dr. 'vVoods’s chief . activity seems to have been in the Unitarian contro-
versy, which puts him in the preceding chapter, and the preponderance of Prof. St\1art’s
work comes after 1830.

Prof. Stuart was born at Hilton, Conn., and graduated at Yale, in the class of 1799. He
studied law, then was Tutor in Yale, then preached in New Haven, and in 1810 was made
Professor of Sacred Literature in Andover. This position he held until 1848, when he
resigned “in consequence of the inﬁrmities of advancing age.”

Prof. Stuart’s principal publications are the following: Commentaries on Hebrews, Ro-
mans, The Apocalypse, Ecclesiastes, and Proverbs ; A Hebrew Grammar; A Hebrew Chres-
tomathy; Elements of Interpretation, a translation from Ernesti; Hints on the Interpre-

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 8 277

tation of Prophecy; Critical History and Defence of the Old Testament Canon; Grammar
of the New Testament Dialect; Rules for Greek Accents and Quantity; Exegetical Essays
on Certain W'0rds relating to Future Punishment; Philological Views of the Modern Doc-
trines of Geology; Cicero on the Immortality of the Soul, criticized with great severity by
Prof. Kingsley of Yale ; Reply to Strictures of the Princeto11 Review on the American Edu-
cation Society ; Letters to Dr. Channing, on the Unitarian Controversy ; Letters to Dr. Chan-
ning, on Religious Liberty; The Mode of Christian Baptism ; Discourses on the Atonement;
Conscience and the Constitution. He had a sharp controversy also with Dr. Maclean of
Princeton on the “ Wine Question,” and was the author of numerous pamphlets.
Of all the long list of his publications, the most important by far are his Commentaries.

ISAAC VV. STUART, 1809-1861, a son of Prof. Moses Stuart of Anclover, was born in New
Haven, Conn., and graduated at Yale, iii the class of 1828. He became Professor of Greek
and Roman Literature in the College of South Carolina, at Columbia. He published IIart-
ford in the Olden Time; A Life of Capt. Nathan Ilale; A Life of Jonathan Trumbull, the
Revolutionary Governor of Connecticut, etc.

Edward Robinson.

EDWARD ROBINSON, D. D., LL. D., 17944863, was another eminent

biblical scholar connected for a time with Andover Theological Seminary.
Of his many works, the "greatest, and those most likely to be enduring, are
his Biblical Researches in the Holy Land, and his Lexicon of the New
Testament. ' v

Professor Robinson was born in Southington, Conn., and was graduated at Hamilton College,
N. Y., with the highest honors of his class, in 1816. He was for two years aTutor in the col-
lege, and was married to President Kirkla.nd’s sister, but was left a widower in less than a
year. In 1821 he went to Andover, Mass., for the purpose of carrying a work through the
press. It ended in his turning his attention to the study of Hebrew, and becoming an
assistant in that department to Professor Stuart.

In 1826 Professor Robinson went abroad to pursue his biblical studies, and he continued
the pursuit four years, chieﬂy at Hallo and Berlin. In Ilalle he married a daughter of Pro-
fessor Ludwig H. Von Jakob. On his return he was made Professor Extraordinary of Sacred
Literature in Andover Theological Seminary, and he continued in that post from 1830 to
1833. The next four years, from 1833 to 1837, were spent in Boston. During the remainder
of his life, from 1837 to 1863, he was Professor of Biblical Literature i11 Union Theological
Seminary, New York. '

In 1838, and again in 1852, in conjunction with the missionary Eli Smith, he made the
exploration of Palestine and Jerusalem, which created such an era in biblical research. Dr.
Robinson, by his previous biblical studies, knew just what points in the topography of the
H0:ly‘Land needed elucidation. Eli Smith, by his long residence in the country as a mis-
sionary at Beirut, had become thoroughly familiar with the ways of the people, and spoke
the language of the country with the freedom of a native. Dismissing, therefore, all the old

legends which had served to bewilder so many generations of students, they traversed the «

country with the open Bible in the original language in one hand, and with a measuring-line
and barometer in the other, and by actual measurement and observation were able to
identify with entire certainty nearly two hundred places named in the Bible, which had
been either lost, or given up to painful conjecture.

These Biblical Researches in the Holy Land, published in their completed form in 3 vols.,
large 8vo, were the fruit of thirty years" previous preparation,‘ of nearly two years spent in
the work of exploration, and of several more years given to the reduction of his observa-

tions. The work holds a high rank in the literature of the subject, and has given both to
him and his coadjutor a lasting place among the original contributors to the geography of
the Holy Land. ‘

Professor Robinson’s other works, all in the line of biblical studies, were numerous and
important. The following are the chief: A Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testa-
ment; A Hebrew and English Lexicon of the Old Testament, on the basis of Gesenius; A
Dictionary of the Holy Bible, for the Use of Schools and Young Persons ; A Harmony of the
Four Gospels in Greek, according to the text of Hahn, with notes; A Harmony of the Four
Gospels in English, according to the Common Version, with notes; Physical Geography of
the Holy Land, a supplement to the Biblical Researches. Professor Robinson published also
a. translation of Buttmann’s Greek Grammar.

Besides these separate works, Professor Robinson established The Biblical Repository, in
1831, and The Bibliotheca Sacra, in 1843, and contributed largely to both.

Mus. EDWARD RoB1NsoN, 1797-1870, wife of the preceding, and daughter of Professor Von
Jakob of Halle, was a woman of great learning and of equal ability. She published a large
number of works, all, however, except one, in German. The only work written by her in Eng-
lish was Historical Views of the Language and Literature of the Slavic Nations. She was
first introduced to the republic ofletters by Goethe, who said of her that “she had the heart
of a woman but the brain of a man.” Her works were issued under the assumed name of
Talvi, an anagram on the initials of her maiden name, Therese Albertine Louise Von Iakob.

ELI SMITH, D. D., 1801-1857, one of the ablest and most sagacious of modern Christian mis-
sionaries, was born at Hartford, Conn., and graduated at Yale, 1823. He studied theology at
Andovcr, entered the service of the American Board of Foreign Missions, in 1826, and went
to Beirut, Syria, and continued his labors in that region during most of the remainder of
his life. His long residence in Syria, his entire familiarity with the people and with the
vernacular Arabic, together with his natural shrewdncss and sagacity, made him invaluable
as a companion and assistant to Dr. Robinson, and added largely to the value of Dr. Robin-
son’s great work, Biblical Researches in Palestine. Dr. Smith published also, in connection
with Dr. Dwight, another missionary, Missionary Researelics in Armenia, in 2 vols. He
prepared also, a Translation of the Bible into Arabic, and had seen the greater part of it in
print before his death.

Bela B. Edwards.

BELA BATES EDWARDS, D. 1)., 1802-1852, Was another of the distin-
Uuished men connected with Andover Seminarv and with New En land
2:) .1 g
theological literature during the period now under consideration.

Dr. Edwards was born in Southampton, Mass. He graduated at Amherst, in the class of
1824, and was afterwards for two years a Tutor there. He studied theology at Andover, and
his chief work was done there.

For ﬁve years, from 1828 to 1833, he was Secretary of the American Education Society,
having his oﬂice for the first two years at Andover, and for the remaining three years at
Boston.

While thus engaged, and asa part of the means for carrying on the work of the Society,
he estalolislied The. American Quarterly Register, which he edited for fourteen years, from
1828 to 1842. V He bestowed a vast amount of labor on this work, designing to make it a
storehouse of facts for present and future generations. It contains indispensable materials
for-future history ——elaborate descriptions and tabular views of academies, colleges, profes-
sional schools, public libraries, and eleeinosynary associations in this country and in Europe;
historical and chronological narratives of parishes, states, kingdoms, sects, eminent men,

and philanthropic schemes; and calm trustworthy notions of current literature, —all either
prepared by himself, or at his suggestion, and passing under his ﬁnal revision.

Concurrently with this, during a part of its career, he was engaged in another great en-
terprise of a more strictly theological character. This was a quarterly Theological Review,
which he began in 1833 and continued for six years. The ﬁrst three years it was published
as The Quarterly Observer. Then it was merged in the Biblical Repository. Under that
name he edited it for the three ensuing years. After an interval of a few years, he entered
upon the editorship of the Bibliotheca Sacra, in‘ Andover, and continued to edit it till his
death in 1852.

In these several enterprises, during a. period of twenty-three years, Dr. Edwards produced
31 vols., 8vo, to which he contributed a much larger proportion of original matter than is
usual with editors of such publications. The amount of authorship in them which belongs
to him is very large. It is, too, of a kind which, though it may not ﬁnd its way into the

permanent literature of the country, yet exercised a prodigious inﬂuence upon the thought-

and culture of the men of his generation.

Most of this large amount of literary work was done by Dr. Edwards in connection with
the duties of a laborious professorship. From 1837 to 1852, he was Professor in Andover
Theological Seminary. For the first eleven of these years, his department was that of He-
brew. On the resignation of Prof. Stuart, in 1848, Greek and Biblical Literature were added.

In the earlier part of his career, Prof. Edwards published The Eclectic Reader, and A
Biography of Self -Made Men. But his great work in letters was what he did in the
Register, Observer, Repository, and Bibliotheca Sacra. In these, as in all his doings,
his aims were high, and he pursued them with an unselﬁsh devotion worthy of all com-
mendation.

Two volumes of his Writings have been published, with a Memoir by Prof. Park of
Andover.

Professor Upharn.

THOMAS COGSWELL UPHAM, D. D., 17 99——187 1, is extensively and favor-
ably known as the author of a teXt—book on. Mental Philosophy.

Prof. Upham was born in Deerﬁeld, N. H., and graduated at Dartmouth in the class of
1818. He studied theology at Andover, and became Professor of Mental and Moral Phi-
losophy at Bowdoin College in 1824. He is chieﬂy known by his work already named, on
Mental Pliilosopliy, in 3 vols. (The Intellect, The Sensibilities, and the Will, each ﬁlling one
volume.) This work does not aim at originality, or the setting forth of any new system, but
is a clear, systematic, and well digested exhibition of generally received doctrines, and with
an arrangement admirably suited for the purposes of instruction. The consequence is that
it has been largely used as a text-book, though not so much now as formerly. Prof. Upham
has publishedalso Outlines of Imperfect and Disordered Mental Action; Principles of the
Interior or Hidden Life; A Treatise on the Divine Union; Religious Maxims having :1 Con-
nection with the Doctrine and Practice of I-Ioliness; The Life of Faith; Manual of Peace;
American Cottage Life; Life and Religious Experience of Madam Gruyon; Life of Catharine
Adorna; Essay on a Congress of Nations, etc.

preaching on account of loss of voice. He has ﬁlled several public posts. His publications
are, Letters on the Logos; Principles of Congregationalism; Lectures on Witchcraft; Life
of John 0. Fremont, etc.

NATHANIEL W. TAYLOR, D.D., 1786-1859, was for many years the
leader of theological opinion in New Haven.

New Haven for ten years, 1812-1822; and Professor of Didactic Theology in Yale thirty-six
years, 1822-1858.

Dr. Taylor did not publish much. His only separate works are Practical Sermons,
preached while he was pastor of Centre Church ; Essays, Lectures, etc., upon Select Topics
in Revealed Theology; and Lectures on the Moral Government of God, 2 vols., 8vo. He
contributed also to the Christian Spectator, which was for a long time the organ of New
Haven theological opinions, and it was through this channel mainly that he propagated his
peculiar views. Those views were considered unsound by a large body of Calvinistic
theologians, and as his views were maintained with unusual ability and persistence, a pro-
longed and exciting controversy was the result.

JAMES MURDOCK, D.D., 1776-1856, was a native of Westbank, Conn., and a graduate of
Yale. Ilewas a Professor of Languages in the University of Vermont, and then of Rhetoric
and Ecclesiastical History in the Theological Seminary at Andover. The last twenty-seven
years of his life were spent in retirement at New Haven. He wrote a work on The Atone-
ment, which excited considerable controversy His chief literary services were in the line of
translation. He translated and introduced to American students Mosheim’s Ecclesiastical
History, which became a text-book in most theological seminaries. He contributed numer-
ous articles to the Bibliotheca Sacra, Christian Spectator, New Englander, New York Ob-
server, etc.

summer holidays, rod in hand, in some out of the way place among the mountains. An
interesting Memoir of him was prepared by Rev. A. R. Van Nest, D.D., containing many of
his letters.

The following interesting reminiscences of Dr. Bethune are given by Rev. A. A. Willits, D.D.

REMINISCENCES OF DR. BETHUNE.

The greatest and noblest exhibitions of his oratorical powers were witnessed when he
stood forth upon the platform on some grand occasion, with a noble and inspiring theme,
unfettered by notes and unencumbered by barriers 1 Ah! then it was that his bow “abode in
strength,” and every shaft he sent from the string, like the arrow of Alcestis of old, would
ﬂash into ﬂame from the very force and intensity of its ﬂight.

It was when thus exalted, and inspired by a noble theme, and before a ﬁtting auditory,
that all the rich resources. of his great nature and rare culture seemed to be in a state of
fusion, and came glowing like molten gold from the furnace of his enkindled soul. And
yet, amid all the ardor of his oratory, there was a perfect equipoise. He knew how, “in
the very torrent and tempest of his passion, to beget a temperance that should give it
smoothness.”

You saw the storm lifting up its mighty waves, and heard “deep calling unto deep;”
but the ship riding that raging ﬂood was not like that one which bore St. Paul on the
Adriatic Sea ~——a poor helpless waif, driven before the Euroclydon, with mainsail struck and
helm unshipped —but was rather like the historic picture of “ Old Ironsides clawing oil‘ a
lee shore ”—sails snugly reefed, yards tautly braced, halliards securely belayed, every man
at his post, and a master of the situation at the wheel, with strong arm, clear head, and
keen vision, keeping the ship to her course despite the tempest, and making every cresting

billow bow in submission beneath her hissing keel. The only regret one felt in hearing
him on these grand occasions was that these richest effusions of his mind, these noblest exhi-
bitions of his pathos and passion, could not be preserved for the beneﬁt and admiration of
mankind.

For, alas! it was all too ethereal for that. No pen could report it, no process could pre-
serve it; one might as well try to catch the ﬂash and explosion that drives a bullet from
the riﬂe as to attempt to catch the spirit and ﬂame of such eloquence. ’l‘he pierced target
you might indeed ﬁnd —— the ﬂattened bullet a.nd the scorched wad—— and these would tell,
most signiﬁcantly, of the ﬁre and force that drove the bullet on wings of lightning to the
mark; but the e2fhe7'ealpowe7* would not be there. No, the electric ﬂash was but an instant
before your eyes, and the echo of the sharp explosion had passed, like a spirit, behind
the hills.

But while Dr. Bethune had few equals, and perhaps no superior, on the rostrum, he shone
with a lustre quite as attractive, though more subdued, in the social circle. Here he was
“facile prz'nceps.” His warm heart, his ever-cheerful temper, his rich and varied acquire-
ments, his keen and playful wit, and his genial humor and companionable disposition, made
him a welcome guest in every circle he visited, and constituted him at once its centre of
attraction. A . .

All who knew him will ever remember the fascination of his social qualities. Ah! how
brilliant and ready was his wit. Vfoe to the reckless knight that undertook to run a tilt
against it! It was generally short, sharp, and decisive; a few brilliant ﬁashings of weapons,
and then a dismounted cavalier rising from the dust with a shivered lance, amid the merry
shouts of the company, (in which the discomﬁted knight was quite as likely to join as the
rest,) for while Bethune’s wit ﬂashed as bright and keen as a falchion, the blade was iii the
hand of a master who knew how to wield it with discretion and good-humor.

One instance I now call to mind, which I think has never been in print, but which is
entirely too good to be lost.

There resided in the city of B-—-, during Dr. Bethune’s pastorate there, a man of wealth
and social position, who was rather noted for his penuriousness. He was a near neighbor
of the Doctor’s, and they were well acquainted and quite familiar. This neighbor was a
large man, of brusque manner, and not devoid of a rude, blunt kind of humor, and there
had been repeatedly good-natured passages of wit between them. One morning, as Bethune
stepped from his door to go down town, he saw his neighbor just ahead of him, moving in
the same direction. He quickened his pace, and soon overtook him. As he joined him, he
saluted him good-naturedly, “ Good morning, "Mr. S———, good morning ; how do you do, sir,
turned, saw who it was, and with a merry twinkle in the corner of

 

this morning? ” S
his eye, said, roughly, (intending to be jocose,) “What is it your business how I do?”
Bethune instantly and calmly replied, with an air of great benevolence, “Well, Mr. S
I ’m one of those kind of men who take an interest in the meanest of God’s cre<m'on.”

I

The following Sonnet, introducing his Lays, gives a good idea of his ﬁne poetic abilities.

As one arranges in a single vase
A little store of unpretending ﬂowers,
So gathered I some records of past hours

Till I, with thankful gladness in my looks,
Turned me to God, sweet nature, loving friends,

The charm of art, the rapture music sends;
And sang away the grief that on ma.n’s lot attends.

better known as “Father Lochni-an,” to be prepared for the gospel ministry. In 181; he
entered upon the ministry at Hagerstown, Md., and remained there sixteen years. In 18.1"),
during the time of this pastorate, he was sent to Germany by the General Synod to seek aid
for the Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, just then struggling into life. He was absent
two years on this mission, and its results were from that day eminently successful. In 1831,
Dr. Kurtz became pastor of the Lutheran church at Chambersburg. Two years afterwards,
being threatened with pulmonary disease, he was obliged to forego preaching, and gave up
his pastoral charge. III 1833, he took charge of the Lutheran Observer, of Baltimore, and
for the next twenty—nine years he gave his best energies to this paper. He found it a strug-
gling, sickly, seven-by-nine semi-monthly, with a subscription list of seven to eight hundred;
he left it a large, handsome, prosperous weekly, with a list of as many thousands. Dr. Kurtz

wrote.

his life.

Dr. Channin-g was confesseclly the most eloquent Unitarian preacher in the United States.
His sermons areconsidered models of pulpit eloquence. He was as remarkable for his gen-
tleness and charity, and for the digniﬁed and reﬁned courtesy of his manners, as for his elo-
quence. He tool; an active part in the formation of the Peace Society, and he sympathized

Boston, and was for a long time the “bright particular star” of that metropolis. The two

former of these was severely criticised by Macaulay. Next to these two essays come his
works on the Evidences of Christianity, Se]f—Culture, and the Elevation of the Laboring
Classes. His sermons on The Paternal Character of God, and on the Loveliness of the
Example of Christ, are also celebrated. '

Dr. Furness.

 

WILLIAM HENRY FURNESS, D. D., 1802 , has been for nearly half

Y .
As a tlieolorrian he belonos to the extreme humanitarian school as d1stin-
D 7 O 7
guished from that of Channing, P abody, and Norton. He wrltes with
great elegance and persuasiveness, and is very accomplished as a man of
letters. His principal writings are on the Life of Jesus.

Dr. Furness is a native of Boston and a graduate of Cambridge. He has been pastor of the
Unitarian church in Philadelphia since 1825. IIe is universally respected as a man of ﬁne
taste and ele ant culture, even by those who dissententirely from his reli ious opinions. His

s s _
principal publications are the following: Remarks on the Four Gospels; Jesus and his

Biographers; History of Jesus; Thoughts on the ‘Life and Character of Jesus of Nazareth;
Domestic Worship; Mirror of Nature, translated from the German ; Julius, and other Tales,
from the German ; Gems of German verse, translated.

“He is a man of a rich, active, and fruitful intellect, of a most liberal culture, of warm
enthusiasm and of glowing fancy. But he is neither a logician nor a critic. ]Esthetic con-
siderations weigh more with him than historical proofs, and vividncss of conception the.
demonstration. So far is he from needing facts to verify his theories, that he is ready to
reject the best authenticated facts, if they would not ﬂow necessarily from his a. pn'orL' rea-
soning. A History of Jesus is a title worthy of the author’s honesty. The deﬁnite article
would have been sadly out of place; for the work is not an exposition of the Gospels as they
are, but an original Gospel, embracing and endorsing such portions of the record of the
evangelists, as accorded with his noti.ons of what must and should have been, and telling
the rest of the story as the evangelists would have told it had they belonged to his school
of philosophy and theology. His theory is, we believe, entirely original and peculiar. It
is naturalism in a form so irrational and untenable, that we canihardly conceive of its ever
ﬁnding a second advocate.” —— Peabody in N. A. Review.

“ He is a poet of ﬁne taste and deep feeling, and has published fugitive poems, chieﬂy
hymns and devotional pieces. He has made exquisite translations from the German, chief of
which stands his version of Schiller’s ‘Song of the Bell.’ He is a lover of the beautiful
arts, and has rendered them great service in Philadelphia.” — Men of the Times.

Theodore Parker.

THEODORE PARKER, 1810-1860, represents the most advanced stage of
American Rationalism. His position indeed can hardly be defined other—
Wise than one of open and avowed unbelief in Christianity. He was re-
markable equally for the ultraism of his opinions, and for the learning,
ability, and resolution with Which he maintained them. He is admitted
by all to have been a man of rare genius. He was an incessant worker,
both with his pen and his tongue. His collected VVo’-sks have been 'p1,1‘o.
lished in 12 Vols., besides the 2 vols. of his Life and Correspondence.

Parker was born in Lexington, Mass. He entered Harvard in 1830, but did not graduate.
He studied divinity at Harvard, and had charge of a Unitarian congregation in Roxbury,
which he subsequently abandoned for an independent service in Boston.

His departure from the ordinary Unitarian doctrines was marked by two sermons, one in
1841, on The Transient and the Permanent in Christianity, the other in 18452, A Discourse
of Matters relating to Religion. His ﬁnal rupture with the orthodox party, however, did
not take place until after his return from Europe in 1845. A

From 1845 until 1859, when he travelled again in the vain quest of health, his labors were
unremitting and multifarious. He translated from the German numerous works on theol-
ogy and biblical criticism,'and took very decided ground on the sl: very question.

He was one of the ﬁrst to rise up against the Fugitive Slave Law, not shrinking from the
boldest denunciation of its promoters. His celebrated oration on the death of Daniel Webster
gave great offence to the friends of that statesman. I

A collected edition of his works in 12 vols. was published in London in 18653, and his Life
and Letters, 2 vols., by Weiss, in 1864.

Whatever opinion may be held of the soundness of Theodore Parker’s religious views)
there can be no question as to his remarkable genius. He was one of the most original and

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 291

daring thinkers that America has produced. No fear of logical deductions or of social con-
sequences ever deterred him from taking What he deemed a correct position or a righteous
step. 8 .'H',e died from sheer exhaustion ‘through overwork. His writings, of whatever kind,
sparkle with freshness of thought and glow with feeling. They stimulate and suggest, even
where they run most strongly counter to our cherished beliefs. Though stern and uncom-
promising in his public acts, he is said to have been remarkably genial and companionable
in private life.

Bishop Hopkins.

JOHN HENRY HOPKINS, D. C. L., LL. D., 1792-1868, Bishop of Vermont,

Bishop Potter.

ALONZO POTTER, D. D., LL. D., 1800—1865, Bishop of Pennsylvania, was

movements for increasing and improving the means of popular education,
and was often present in associations of teachers, and always ex-tremely
welcome there. One of the most popular of his Works was The School and
The Schoolmaster, the la.tter part being written by George B. Emerson.

with Dr. Boardman, on Apostolical Succession, and he published many Sermons and Charges.
His works have been published iI1 four large volumes.

Two of Bishop Doane’s short lyrics are quoted. The ﬁrst was occasioned by the following
incident. For several mornings a little bird found its way into the saloon at St. Mary‘s
Hall, where Miss Stanley’s Sunday-class was gathered. The allusion to Bishop Ken arose
from the fact that his “Morning Hymn ” is always sung there on Sundays.

TO THE SUNDAY MORNING BIRD.

Little wingéd bit of song,
Whr-resoe’er thou dost belong.
Come and go without a fear;
Thou art ever welcome here.

Dost thou know the sacred day?
Dost thou know where maidens pray?
‘Wast thou won down from the sky
By our chapel minstrelsy?

Did the angels tell thee when
Thou might’st hear good Bishop Ken,

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 293

In that sweetest Morning Hymn
Fit for Chanting Cherubiml

Did the Saviour, from above

In the fulness of his love,

Send a message down, by thee;
"Let tl1e children come to me?”

Little winged bit of song,
Wheresoe’er thou dost belong,
Come and go without a fear,
Thou art ever welcome here.

EVENING.

Softly now the light of day
Fades upon my sight away;
Free from care, from labor free,
Lord, I would commune with Thee!
Thou, whose all pervading eye
Naught escapes, without, within,
Pardon each inﬁrmity,
Open fault, and secret sin.

Soon for me the light of day

Shall forever pass away;

Then, from sin and sorrow free,

Take me, Lord, to dwell with Thee!

Thou who, sinless, yet hast known 3
All of man’s inﬁrmity;

Thou, from Thy eternal throne,
Jesus, look with pitying eye.

Dr. Turner.

SAMUEL H. TURNER, D. D., 1790-1861, is by general consent the ablest

Protestant Episcopal Church. In the range of accuracy of his Biblical learning he has no
equals in that church ; and few in other churches take higher rank.” — Am. Theol. Review
(Presbyterian).

“We have more than once expressed our high sense of Professor Turner’s merits as a
Biblical critic. We can hardly conceive of a nicer mutual equilibrium than exists in his
mind between reverence and learning. faith and freedom, loyalty to the voice of revelation
and fearless inquiry as to what that voice utters and means.”——N. Am. Review, Dr. A. P.
Peabody, (Unitarian.)

Christianity at the age of twenty-ﬁve. He came to the United States in 1816, and was for
some time a Presbyterian minister, and afterwards a Baptist. He labored both in England

Commonwealth, etc.

Dr. Chase.

IRA CHASE, D. 1)., 1793-1864, may be considered the father of theologi-
cal education among the Baptists in the United States. He wrote several
valuable works, but the great work of his life was his founding the Theo-
logical Institution, at Newton, Mass.

Dr. Chase was born at Stratton, Vt. His ﬁrst impulse to a literary life came from a little
book that his mother put into his hands, Mason’s “ Self-Knowledge.” He grzuluated at
Middlebury College, which he entered at an advanced standing, in 1812. There he was asso-
ciated with Pliny Fisk and Levi Parsons, who were afterwards missionaries in Palestine. He
studied theology at Andover, completing his course there in 1817.

‘While at Andover he became strongly impressed. with the need in his own branch of the
church, the Baptist, of a distinct institution for theological education, and to found such an
institution became thenceforward the controlling purpose of his life. While pondering this
subject, he was invited to Philadelphia, in 1818, to be associated with the venerable Dr.
Stoughton in educating young men for the ministry. Dr. Stoughton and Prof. Chase ac-
cordingly drew up a plan ofstudy, and a Theological School was opened, the ﬁrst ofits kind
by the Baptists in the United States.

In 1822, the school was transferred to Washington, D. C., and made a part of the Colum-
bian College. Prof. Chase labored there three years, b11t ﬁnding that the theological depart-
ment of the College did not attain that distinct development which he desired, he resigned
the professorship in 1835, and looked elsewhere for the realization of 11iS hopes. The im-
portant Theological Institution, at" Newton, Mass, was the result. It was opened in Novem-
ber, 1825, and Dr. Chase was its ﬁrst Professor. He labored there for the next twenty years,
until 1815, when he retired from active duty.

Dr. Ch-ase’s publications are The Life of Bunyan; Infant Baptism an Invention of Men;
The Design of Baptism, in its Relation to the Christian Life; The Constitutions of the Holy
Apostles ; and a large number of Tracts, Sermons, Essays in the Bibliotheca Sacra, etc.

Sabbath; Encyclopaedia of Religious Knowledge; Apocalypse, a Poem; Emily and Other
Poems. I-le edited the Practical Works of John Bunyan, 8 vols.

Dr. Raphall.

MORRIS JACOB RAPHALL, Ph. 1)., 1798-1868, a Jewish clergyman of
New York city, was greatly distinguished for his learning and eloquence.
His publications ﬁll many volumes.

Dr. Raphall was born at Stockholm. Early in life he showed talents of a high order, and
being designed for the ministry, he was furnished by his parents with the bestlopportunitiexs
for a liberal education._ He was sent ﬁrst to the Jewish College at Copenhagen, where he
gained distinction at the age of thirteen. At the age of fourteen he went to England to
perfect himself in the English, of which language he acquired a complete mastery. In 1818
-20, he made the tour of Europe; in 1821, at the age of twenty—three, he entered the Uni-
versity of Giessen, where he remained four years. In 1825, he returned to England, and
made his residence there until 1819, when he came to the United States.

Dr. Raphall resided in New York from 1849 to the time of his death,in 1868, and was held
in high estimation by all classes of people, Christian as well as Jewish.

The following are his principal publications: Post-Biblical History of the Jews ; Path to
Immortality; Bible Views of Slavery; Judaism Defended; Devotional Exercises for the
Daughters of Israel ; The Festivals of the Lord, as Celebrated by the House of Israel; The
Literature of the Jews in Spain; The Social Condition of the Jews. Dr. Raphall also trans-

popular lecturer, and contributed much to periodical literature.

REV. ISAAC LEESER, 1806-1868, a Jewish preacher settled for a long time in Philadelphia,
was born in Westphalia. He came to the United States in 1824, and resided for the ﬁrst

and wrote a good deal. Instructions in the Mosaic Religion; The Jews and the Mosaic
Law; Discourses, Argumentative, on the Jewish Religion; Hebrew Spelling and Reading
Book; Translation of the Holy Scriptures from the Original Hebrew. Mr. Leeser published

Hosea Ballou.

REV. HOSEA BALLOU, 17 71-1852, was the founder of Universalism in
the United States, and a man of great eminence as a preacher and a con-
troversialist.

Mr. Ballou was a native of New Hampshire, but spent the greater part of his public life
in Boston. His publications are very numerous, and would make, it is supposed, not less
than one hundred 121110 vols. The most important is An Examination of the Doctrine of
Future Retribution. Some of the others are: Notes on the Parables ; Treatise on the Atone-
ment; Authenticity of the Scriptures; Candid Review. In 1819, he began The Universalist
Magazine, the ﬁrst weekly paper devoted to the dissemination of Universalist doctrines in
the United States. In 1831, in connection with his nephew, also Hosea Ballou, he began
the Universalist Expositor, changed afterwards to the Universalist Quarterly Review, and
still continued.—MA'rURIN M. BALLOU, 1822 , son of Rev. Hosea B., is the author of:
History of Cuba; Biography of Rev. Hosea Ballou; and Life-Story of Hosea Ballou, a juvenile
work; also, Editor and proprietor of Ballou’s Pictoria1.—-HOSEA BALLOU, D.D., 1796-1861,

a nephew of the Hosea Ballou just named, was born at Halifax, Vt. After preaching at
Roxbury and Medford, Mass., and at Staiford,lConn., he became, in 1855, President of 'l‘uft’s
College, Somerville, Mass., an institution which he had helped largely to found. He was
associated with the older Ballou in the management of the Uiiiversalist Magazine. He
wrote also Ancient History of Universalism, and edited Sisinondfs History of the Crusades.
--MOSES BALLOU, 1811 —--. "another nephew of Rev. Ilosea Ballou, was the author of Me-
morial of Sanford; and The Divine Charact.er Yindicated, a reply to Bee(:her’s Conflict of the
Ages ; a contributor also to the Universalist Review. '

THOMAS VVHITTEMORE, D.D., 1800-1861, a Universalist preacher of prominent standing, was
born in Boston. After some experience in two or three different trades, he became at the
age of twenty a Universalist preacher. He was subsequently a member of the Legislature,
President of the Cambridge Bank, and President of the Vermont and Massachusetts Rail-
road. He wrote Modern History of Universalism; Plain Guide to Universalism; Notes on
the Parables; Gospel Harmonist; A Commentary on Revelation; A Comnienta-ry on Daniel;
Life of Walter Balfour and Hosea Ballou; Autobiography.

Alexander Campbell.

REV. ALEXANDER CAMPBELL, 1788-1865, is well known as a religious
reformer, and as the founder of a large and inﬂuential religious society, who
are sometimes called Campbellites, but who usually call themselves Disciples
of Christ. He was a man of extraordinary intellectual activity, andvthe
amount of labor which he performed during the forty—ﬁve years of his min-
istry borders on the marvellous. His writings ﬁll nearly sixty volumes, and
yet they Were but a part, and that not the largest part, of his Work. His

_chief power was in unwritten discourse, and the greater part of his incessant

activity was exercised as a speaker. He excelled especially in debate, and
he had a particular fondness for that method of propagating truth. As a
public disputant on religious topics, he has probably never had his superior.

Mr. Campbell was born iii the county of Antrim, in Ireland. His father, Thomas Camp-
bell, was a minister of the Secession Church, in Ireland, and emigrated to America in 1807,
and settled in Vfashington County, in Western Pennsylvania. Alexander with the rest of
the family followed in 1800, he being then twenty-one years of age. He had been educated
mainly by his father, and after the departure of the latter for America had studied for a
year at Glasgow University.

While in Glasgow, he became acquainted with the views of the Haldanes, and began to
entertain doubts of the correctness of the religious system in which he had been educated.
On reaching Pennsylvania, he found that his father had undergone a similar change of
views. They accordingly withdrew from the Seccders the same year, 1809, publishing a
declaration of their reasons, and forming articles of Association for those who united with
them.

Alexander began preaching in 1810, and from this time to the time of his death, he devoted
his energies unintermittingly and exclusively to the new religious movement. After labor-
ing for several years in Washington County, he established himself in Bethany, not far from
W'heeling, in VVest Virginia. Bethany became thenceforth the centre of his opera.t.ions,
though much of his time was spent in travelling through the We tern and South-western
States, preaching his doctrines, and meeting opponents in public debate.

His first encounter of this kind was in 1820, at Mount llleasant, 0., with the Rev. John

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 301

Walker, of the Secession Church, the question being that of Infant Baptism. The debate
lasted several days. The report of it was printed in a volume, and two or three editions of
it were sold.

The effect of the publication of this Volume led Mr. Campbell to reﬂect upon the import-.

ance of employing the press in the dissemination of his opinions. He accordingly set up a
printing-press at his house, and began in 1823 the publication of a monthly magazine, The
Christian Baptist, nearly all of it written by himself. The magazine was changed in 1830
to the Millennial Harbinger, and under this name was continued by him until 1863, in all
ell vols. The amount of writing which he did for these periodicals seems almost incredible.

Mr. Campbell’s subsequent great debates were with the Rev. VVilliam L. McCalla, of the
Presbyterian Church, Kentucky, 1823; with Robert Owen the inﬁdel, Cincinnati, 1829;
with Bishop Purcell, of the Catholic Church, Cincinnati, 1837; and with N. L. Rice, D.D.,
Presbyterian, Lexington, Ky., 1842. Each of these debates was reported in full, forming a

large volume.

Besides his Debates, and his writ.ings in the magazine, Mr. Campbell at different times
wrote the following: The Christian System or Christianity testored; Christian Preacher’s
Companion, or Inﬁdelity refuted by Inﬁdels; Christian Baptism, its Antecedents and Conse-
quences; Popular Lectures and Addresses; The New Testament, a new version, with notes;
Christian Hymn-Book; Life of Thomas Campbell.

Among his other works, Mr. Campbell established, in 1841, Bethany College, at Bethany,
WV. Va., and was its first President. A very interesting Life of Mr. Campbell, in 2 vols., Svo,
has been written by his associate and successor in Bethany College, Prof. Robert Richardson,

The following description of Mr. Cam pbell’s manner and appearance in the pulpit is from
a letter by the Rev. Heman Humphrey, D.D., published in the New York Observer.

“At length Dr. Campbell made his way up through the crowd and took‘ his seat in the
pulpit. He is somewhat above the middle stature, with broad shoulders, a little stooping,
and, though stoutly built, a little spare and pale. He has a high, intellectual forehead, a
keen, dark eye, somewhat shaded, and a well-c'overed head of gray hair, fast changing into
the full bloom of the almo11d~tree. I think he must be rather over than under sixty-fi ve
years of age. He looks like a hard-working man, as he has been from his youth up. Very
few could have endured so much mental and physical labor as has raised him to the com-
manding situation which he now occupies, and so long sustained him in it. His voice is not
strong, evidently owing, in part, to the indifferent state of his health, but it is clear and
ﬁrmly modulated. -Ilis enunciation is distinct, and, as he uses no notes, his language is re-
markably pure and select. In his delivery, he has not much action, and but little of that
fervid outpouring which characterizes VVestern and Southern eloquence. There is nothing
vociferous or impassioned in his manner. I think he is the most perfectly self-possessed,
the most perfectly at ease in the pulpit, of any preacher I ever listened to, except, perhaps,
thecelebrated Dr. John Mason of New York. No gentleman could be more free and unem-
barrassed in his own parlor. At the same time there is not the slightest apparent want of
deference for his audience.

“ In laying out his work, his statements are simple, clear, and concise, his topics are well
and logically arranged, his manner is calm and deliberate, but full of assurance. His ap-
peals are not very earnest 11or indicative of deep feeling; but nevertheless winning and im-
pressive in a high degree. There were many ﬁne and truly eloquent passages in the two
discourses I heard, but they seemed to cost him no effort, and to betray no consciousness on
his part that they were ﬁne. In listening to him you feel that you are in the presence of a
greatman. He speaks like a ‘master of assemblies,’ who has entire conﬁdence in the
mastery of his subject and his powers, and who expects to carry conviction to the minds of
his hearers without any of those adventitious aids on which ordinary men find it necessary
to rely. On both evenings when I heard him he held the great congregation for one hour
and a half in that profound stillness which shows that his listeners are not aware of the
lapse of time.”

302 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

,“»Alexander Campbell is unquestionably one of the mostextraordinary men of our time.

A-‘Putting wholly out of view his tenets, with which we of course. have nothing to do, he

claims, by virt11e of his intrinsic qualities, as manifested in his achievements, a place among

.,the very foremost spirits of the age. His energy, self—reliance, and self-jiclelity, if We may

use the expression, are of the stamp that belongs only to the world’s ﬁrst leaders in thought
or action. His personal excellence is certainly without a stain or a shadow. His intellect,
it is scarcely too much to say, is among the clearest, richest, profoundest, ever vouchsafed
to man. Indeed,- it seems to us that in the faculty of abstract thinking — in, so to say, the
sphere of pure -thought——-he has few, if any, living rivals. Every cultivated person of the
slightest metaphysical turn W110 has heard Alexander Campbell in the pulpit or in the social
circle, must have been especially impressed by the wonderful facility with which his facul-
ties move in the highest planes ofthought. Ultimate facts stand forth. as boldly in his con-
sciousness as sensations do in that of most other men. He grasps and handles the highest,
subtlest, most comprehensive principles as if they were the liveliest impressions of the
senses. No poet’s soul is more crowded with imagery than his is with the ripest forms of
thought. Surely the life of a man thus excellent and gifted, is a part of the common treas-
ure of society. In his essential character, he belongs to no sect or party, but to the world.”
——George D. 1’rentz'ce, in the Louisville Jourizal.

VIII. MISCELLANEOUS VVRITERS.

Mrs. Sigourney.

MRS. LYDIA H. SIGOURNEY, 17 91—1865, won her Way to a distinguished
position in letters, not by any one special and extraordinary work of genius,
but by persistent and long continued labors, moderate in tone and useful in
their tendency. Her indefatigable pen sent forth one volume a year, on an
average, for half a century, her ﬁrst volume, Moral Pieces in Prose and
Verse, bearing date 1815, and her ﬁftieth, Letters of Life, a sort of auto-
biography, being ready for publication at the time of her death, in 1865.

In all this long career of authorship there was nothing to startle or elec-
trify the public mind. I-Ier Writings were more like the dew than the
lightning. Yet the dew, it is Well togremember, is not only one of the most
beneﬁcent, but also one of the most powerful, of nature’ s agents, —— far more
potential in grand results than its brilliant rival. VVhen count shall be
made of the various agencies, moral and intellectual, which moulded the
American mind and heart during the first half of the nineteenth century,

few names will be honored with a larger credit than. that of Lydia 
Sigourney.

The maiden name of this lady was Lydia Howard Huntly. She was a native of Norwich,
Conn. Being an only child, she was nurtured with special care and tenderness. At the age
of nineteen, in company with an intimate friend, Anna Maria Hyde, she established a school
for young ladies at Norwich. Two years later, she removed to Hartford to pursue the same
occupation in that city. There, in 1819, at the age of twenty—eight, she was married to Mr.
Charles Sigourney, a merchant of Hartford, and she continiicd to make that city her home
until her death in 1865. .
~ Mrs. Sigourney’s career is an instance, i_f any were needed, to prove that a woman may
be true to all her womanly instincts and duties, and yet do worthy service in the ﬁeld of
letters. That she was able to accomplish so much was due to her habits of system and order,
and her diligent use of the passing hour. She was famous among her neighbors for domestic

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 303

thrift, and for active co-operation with her sex in deeds of social benevolence, yet always
ready for an engagement with a publisher, -and punctual to a day in whatever literary task
she undertook.

A paramount sense of duty seemed to be the obvious spring of Mrs. Sigourney’s writings,
as of her conduct. If it did not lead her to the highest regions of fancy, it saved her from
the disgraceful falls which too often mark the track of genius. Few, who have written so
much, have written so little to cause regret in the review. Along the calm, sequestered
vale of duty and usefulness, her writings, like a river fresh from its mountain springs,
gladdened many a quiet home, stimulated into activity many a’ generous heart.

Some of Mrs. Sigourney’s small volumes, like the VVhisper to a Bride, unpretending in
character, as in appearance, yet contain a wealth of beauty and goodness that few would

believe who have not examined them. Of her larger volumes, none are more widely known

than Letters to Young Ladies, Letters to Mothers, and Letters to My Pupils. Past Meridian,
written when the shadows of life began to fall about her, in the calm and cheerful serenity
of its spirit, and the wisdom of its counsels, reminds the reader of Cicero’s famous essay on
Old Age. ‘

Mrs. Sigourney has been generally quoted as a poet. Her true position is that of a prose
writer. Of the vast number of verses which she wrote, it is doubtful whether any even
now are remembered, except one, Lines on the Death of an Infant.

DEATH OF AN INFANT.

Death found strange beauty on that polished brow,
And dashed it out. There was a tint of rose

On cheek and lip. He touched the veins with ice,
And the rose faded. Forth from those blue eyes
There spake a wistful tenderness, a doubt
Whether to grieve or sleep, which innocence
Alone may wear. With ruthless haste he bound
The silken fringes of those curtained lids

Forever. There had been a murmuring sound
VVith which the babe would claim its mother’s ear,
Charming her even to tears. The spoiler set

The seal of silence. But there beamed a smile,

So fixed, so holy, from that cherub brow,

Death gazed, and left it there. He dared not steal
The signet-ring of heaven.

SKETCH OF A FAMILY.

It is the duty of mothers to sustain the reverses of fortune. Frequent and sudden as they
have been in our own country, it is important that young females should possess some em-
ployment by which they might obtain a livelihood in case they should be reduced "to the
necessity of supporting themselves. VVhen females are suddenly reduced from afﬂuence to
poverty, how pitiful and contemptible it is to see the mother desponding and helpless, and
permitting her daughters to embarrass those whom it is their duty to assist and cheer.

“I have lost my whole fortune,” said a merchant, as he returned one evening to his
home; “we can no longer keep our carriage. ‘Ye must leave this large house. The chil-
dren can no longer go to expensive schools. Yesterday I was a rich man; to-day there is
nothing I can call my own.” _

“Dear husband,” said the wife, “we are still rich in each other and our children. Money
may pass away, but God has given us a better treasure in these active hands and loving
hearts.”

“Dear father,” said the children, “ do not look so sober. We will help you to get a

living.”

304 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

“What can you do, poor things? ” said he.

“You shall see! you shall see!” answered several voices. “ It is a pity if we have been
to school for nothing. IIow can the father of eight children be poor? We shall work and
make you rich again.” ,

“ I shall help,” said a little girl, hardlyfour years old. “ I shall not have any new things
bought, and I shall sell my great doll.”

The heart of the husband and father, which had sunk within his bosom like a stone, was
lifted up. The sweet enthusiasm of the scene cheered him, and his nightly prayer was like
a song of praise. ,

They left their stately house. The servants were dismissed. Pictures and plate, rich
carpets and furniture, were sold, and she who had been mistress of the mansion shed no tears.

“Pay every debt,” said she; “let no one suffer through us, and we may be happy.”

He rented a neat cottage and a small piece of ground a few miles from the city. With the
aid of his sons he cultivated vegetables for the market. He viewed with delight and aston-
ishment the economy of his wife, nurtured as she had beenin wealth, and the eﬂiciency
which his daughters soon acquired under her training.

The eldest assisted in the household, and also instructed the young children ; besides, they
executed various works which they had learned as accomplishments, but which they found
could be disposed of to advantage. They embroidered with taste some of the ornamental
parts of female apparel which were readily sold to a merchant in the city.

They cultivated ﬂowers, and sent. bouquets to market in the cart that conveyed the vegetas
bles; they plaited straw, they painted maps, they executed plain needle-work. Every one
was at her post, busy and cheerful. The little cottage was like a beehive.

“ I never enjoyed such health before,” said the father.

“ And I never was so happy before,” said the mother.

“ We never knew how many things we could do when we lived in the grand house,” said
the children; "' and we love each other a great deal better here. You call us your little
bees.” ‘

“ Yes,” said the father; “ and you make just such honey as the heart likes to feed on.”

Economy, as well as industry, was strictly observed ; nothing was wasted. Nothing
unnecessary was purchased. The eldest daughter became assistant teacher in a distinguished
semina.ry, and the second took her place as instructress to the family.

The dwelling, which had always been kept neat, they were soon able to beautify. Its
construction was improved, and the vines-and ﬂowering trees were repla.nted around it.
The merchant was happier under his woodbine—c0vered porch in a summer’s evening, than

he had been in his showy dressing-room.

“ We are now thriving and )l‘OS erous ” said he‘ “shall we return to the cit ? ”

“Oh no 1 ” was the unanimous re )1 .
’ .

“ Let us remain,” said the wife, “where we have found health and contentment.”

“Father,” said the youngest, “all we children hope you are not going to be rich again ;
for then,” she added, “ we little ones were shut up in the nursery, and did not see much of

I you or mother. Now we all live togetlier, and sister, who loves us, teaches us, a.nd we learn

to be industrious and useful. We were none of us happy when we were rich and did not
work. So, father, Jlease not to be rich any more.”

Mrs. Willard.

MRS. EMMA VVILLARD, 178'7~l870, is more known as a Woman of. action
than as an author. She devoted the greater part of a long and most
useful life to the education of women, in which her eﬁbrts, both as athe-
orist and as a practical teacher, Were crowned with signal success. He!

-prominence as a writer, however,idoes not by any means correspond to
that assigned to her by common consent as aneducator. Still, she found
time, in the midst of other ' duties of a most urgent character, to make sev-
eral valuable contributions to thecause of letters.

Mrs. Willard was the daughter of the late Samuel Hart, of Berlin, Conn., where she was born
in February, 1787. Her father was descended, on the maternal side, from Thomas Hooker, min-
ister, and on the paternal side, from Stephen Hart, deacon, of the original church in Hart-
ford, Conn. Minister llooker and Deacon Hart were among that large company ofe1'nigrant.s
who came over in 1630, and settled the town of Cambridge, Mass. In 1635, ﬁve years after
the settlement of Cambridge, a fresh colony swarmed from the parent hive, including the
“ minister” and the “ deacon ” just named, and settled the town of Hartford.

The love of teaching appears to have been a ruling passion in Miss I~Iart’s mind, and was
developed in her early years. At the age of sixteen she took charge of a district school in
her native town. The following year she opened a select school, and in the summer of the
next year was placed at the head of the Berlin Academy.

During the spring of 1807, Miss Hart received invitations to take charge of academies in
three different States, and accepted that from \Vestﬁeld, Mass. She remained there but a.
few weeks, when, upon a second a11d more pressing invitation, she went to Middlebury in
Vermont. Here she assumed the charge of an academy for young women, which she re-
tained for two years. The school was liberally patronized, and general satisfaction rewarded
the efforts of its preceptress. In 1809, she resigned her academy, and was united in marriage
with Dr. John Willard. -

In 1814, Mrs. Willard was induced to establish a boarding-school at Middlebury, when she
formed the determination to effect an important change in the education of women, by the
institution of a class of schools of a higher character than had been established in the
country before. She applied herself assiduously to increase her own personal abilities as a
teacher by the diligent study of branches with which she had been unacquainted. She
introduced new studies into her school, and invented new methods of teaching. She also
prepared An Address to the Public, in which she proposed A Plan for Improving Female
Education. ‘

A copy of this Plan was sent to Gov. De 1Vitt Clinton, who immediately wrote to Mrs.
W'illa.rd,, expressing a most cordial desire that she would remove her institution to the State
of New York. He also recommended the subject of her “Plan ” in his message to the Leg-
islature. The result was the passage of an act to incorporate the proposed institute at
VVaterford ; and another to give to female academies a share of the literary fund; being, it
is believed, the first law ever passed by any Legislature with the direct object of improving
female education. -

During the spring of 1819, Mrs. VVillard removed to Waterford, and opened her school.
Tile higher mathematics were introduced, and the course of study was made suﬂ"1ciently
complete to qualify the pupil for any station in life.

In the spring of 1821, diﬂiculties attending the securing of a proper building for the school
in Waterford, Mrs. VVilla-rd again determined upon a removal. The public-spirited citizens
of Troy offered liberal inducements; and in May, 1821, The Troy Female Seminary was
opened under ﬂattering auspices; and abundant success crowned her indefatigable exertions.
Since that period, the institute has been well known to the public, and the name of Mrs.
\Villard, for more than half a century, has been identiﬁed with her favorite academy.

Dr. VVillard died in 1825; Mrs. VVillard continued her school till her health was impaired,
and in 1830 visited France. She resided in Paris for several months, and from thence went
to England and Scotland, returning in the ‘following year. After her return she published
a volume of Travels, the avails of which, amounting to twelve hundred dollars, were 0.8 voted
to the cause of female education in Greece.

306 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

In 1838, Mrs. Willard resigned the charge of the Troy Seminary, and returned to Hartford.
Her time after that, for several years, was occupied with the revision of her more important
text-books. These were A History of the United States, Universal History, and Ancient
Geography. She also wrote numerous addresses on different occasions, being mostly on
education.

In the winter of 1846, Mrs. Willard prepared for the press a work of a speculative charac-
ter, whieh attracted considerable attention, both abroad and at home. This work, which
was published in the ensuing spring, both in New York and London, developed the results
of a study which had intensely occupied her at times for fourteen years. Its title is “A
Treatise on the Motive Powers which produce the Circulation of the Blood ; ” and its object
was nothing less than to establish the fact, that the principal motive poweuwliieli produces
circulation of the blood is not, as has been heretofore supposed, the heart’s a.ction, that being
only secondary; but that the principle motive power is respiration, operating by animal
heat, and producing an effective force at the lungs.

Some of her later works were two Chronographic Charts, one for American, and one for
Universal History; History of the Mexican War, and of California; Morals for the Young;
Astronography; and Astronomy.

Mrs. Willard published a small volume of Poems.

Mrs. Phelps.

MRS. ALMIRA HART (LINCOLN) PHELPS, 1793 , sister of Mrs. Wil-
lard, Was like her prominently identiﬁed with the first movements to raise
the character of education for Women, and like her too made valuable con-
tributions to the literature of instruction. Her text—books on Botany, in
particular, were for a long time the best in the market.

Mrs. Phelps was born at Berlin, Conn., and was educated chieﬂy by her sister Emma. At

the age of eighteen, she spent a year at the Seminary of Miss Hinsdale, at Pittsﬁeld, Mass.,
and soon after was married to Simeon Lincoln, editor of the Connecticut Mirror, of Hartford.

Mrs. Lincoln was left a Widow at the age of thirty. Being thrown by this event upon her‘
own resources, she began preparing herself in the most thorough manner for what was"

henceforth to be her chosen ofﬁce, the education of the young. For this purpose she studied
the Latin and Greek languages, and the natural sciences, applying herself at the same time
to the cultivation of her talents for drawing and painting, and spent seven years in the Troy
Seminary, engaged alternately in teaching and study.

In 1831, she was married to Hon. John Phelps, of Vermont, and the next six years of her
life were spent in that State. .

In 1839, she became Principal of a Female Seminary at West Chester, Pa. She subse-
quently removed to Ellicott’s Mills, Md., to establish, in conjunction with her husband, the
Patapsco Female Institute. Mr. Phelps died in 1849, and Mrs. Phelps was again left a widow.

Mrs. l’helps’s ﬁrst publication was a work known as Lincoln’s Botany, having been writ-
ten while she was Mrs. Lincoln. It appeared in 1829, and had a large circulation. The next
work, a Dictionary of Chemistry, though mainly a translation from the French, contained
much original matter. After her second marriage, she published Botany for Beginners, and
Chemistry for Beginners, and a course of Lectures on Education. These lectures afterwards
formed a volume of Harper’s School Library, under the name of The Female Student. Her
other principal works were Natural Philosophy for Schools ; Natural Philosophy for Begin-
ners; Geology for Beginners; Progressive Education (translated from the French); Caroline
Westerly, or the Young Traveller; Ida Norman. or Trials and their Uses; A l\Iother’s Jour-
nal of "her Child's Last Year; Christian Households; Hours with my Pupils; Whispers to a.

Bride, etc. It is estimated that more than a million copies of Mrs. Phelps’s books had been
sold up to 1850.

Her career, running through more than two generations, has been one of continued use-
fulness, and is an honor to her cou11try and her age. “ No woman in America, nor any one
in Europe, excepting Mrs. Marcet and Mrs. Somerville, has made such useful and numerous
contributions to the stock of available scientiﬁc knowledge as Mrs. Phelps.” — Mrs. HccZe’s
W0mcm’s Record.

MRS. ELIZA WARE FARRAR, 1791-1870, was born in Flanders, of parents who went from Nan-
tucket to Europe, and who ﬁnally settled i11 England. She was educated in England, and
lived there until 1819. Her ﬁrst book, Congo in Search of his Master, was written and ﬁrst
published in England. After coming to America, she was married to Prof. John W. Farrar, of
Harvard University. She wrote the following works besides the one already named: Tl1e
Children’s Robinson Crusoe ; The Story of Lafayette ; The Life of Howard; Youth’s Letter-
W'riter; Young Lady’s Friend. The book last named contains plain, homely advice to young
ladies in regard to manners and decorum, and has been very popular. It contains no ﬂights
of fancy, or attempts at ﬁne writing, but for sound practical sense, expressed in good Eng-
lish, and in a style perfectly adapted to the subject, it is a work worthy of Hannah More,
or of Maria Edgeworth. In her old age, she wrote also an interesting volume of reminis-
cences, Recollection of Seventy Years. She died at Springfield, Mass.

Mrs. Gilman.

MRS. CAROLINE (HOWARD) GILMAN, 1794 ————, was very generally
known to a preceding generation by her pleasant book, called Recollections
of a Southern Matron. '

Mrs. Gilman was a native of Boston, and the Wife of Dr. Samuel Gilman. She went with

him to Charleston, S. C., in 1819, and has lived there ever since. Her ﬁrst publications,
which were poems, began as early as 1810. Among them, J eptha’s Rash Vow, and J airus’s

. Daughter, attracted particular attention. Her activity as a prose writer commenced with

the Southern Rose Bud, a weekly juvenile paper, which she began in 1832, and continued for
seven years. This miscellany contains a large amount of valuable literary matter, and is
especially rich in contributions from Mrs. Gi1man’s own pen. Her other publications have
been as follows: Recollections of a Southern Matron ; Recollections of a New England House-
keeper; Ruth Raymond, or Love’s Progress; Poetry of Travelling; Tales and Ballads; Let-
tors of Eliza Wilkinson ; Verses of a Lifetime; The Oracles from the Poets; The Sibyl, etc.
The two books ﬁrst named have had a large sale.

SAMUEL GILMAN, D. D., 1791-1858, was a native of Gloucester, Mass., and a graduate of Har-
yard. He was a classmate of Edward Everett, and after graduation was for two years a
tutor in the college. In 1819 he was settled in Charleston, S. C., as pastor of the Unitarian
church there, and he remained in that position until his death. His publications are: Me-
moirs of a New England Choir, much admired for its graphic and harmonious descriptions;

' Pleasures and Pains of a Student’s Life; The History of a Ray of Light; A Poem read b.e-

fore the Phi Beta Kappa of Harvard; Contributions to Literature, Critical, Humorous, Bio-
graphical, Philosophical, and Poetical. Dr. Grilman was a contributor to the North American
Review and the Christian Examiner.

MADAME FRANCES (WRIGHT) D’ARUsMoNT, better known as Fanny Wright,1796—1852, was
an atheistical Scotch woman, who came to the United States in 1818, and again in 1820, and
in 1825, and made herself notorious by delivering public lectures against moralsand religion.

308 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

She published Views of Society and Manners in America; A Few Days in Athens ; Altorf, a
Tragedy. She was married afterwards to M. D’Arusmont, a Frenchman, and died in Cincin-
nati. “ She excited much comment, by her levelling doctrines and her extravagant lan-
guage. But she had many followers and coadjutors, among them the still living Robert
Dale Owen. The well-known Amos Gilbert wrote a memoir of her in 1855, three ye.ars after
her death, entitled The Pioneer Woman, or the Cause of ‘Woman’s Rights. She was a person
of immense energy and uncommon versatility. The list of her works is something unusual.
She wrote a tragedy called ‘Altorf, in 1819 ; Views of Society and Manners in America, which
ran through four editions, and was translated into Frencli, published in 1820, and repub-
lished, with alterations and additions, in 1821 and 1822; A Few Days in Athens, being a.
translation of a Greek manuscript found in Herculaneum, and a defence of the Epicurean
Philosophy, published in London in 1822, and republished in Boston the same year. These
were followed by a course of popular lectures, spoken in all the leading cities, North, West,
and South, and printed for circulation and running through six editions. She was a.lso the
author, in company with Robert Dale Owen, of certain popular tracts, and in 1844 her biog-

raphy was published in England, including her notes and political letters. I shall always I

remember the effect produced by the lectures of this i:nlei'_atigable and really gifted woman,
as she travelled through Pennsylvania many years ago. Cont-roverted and attacked by the
clergy and the press, she maintained an unda.unted front, and persevered to the last. That
she was a woman of great mind is established by the number of her followers, including
some of the best intellects of the country, and by the repeated publication and very general
reading of her tracts and essays. It is related that when she came to her death-bed she
recanted the most of her free-love and socialistic theories.” —- John W. Forney.

MRS. ANNE ROYALL,17G9—1854, was a native of Virginia. In early life she was stolen by

the Indians, and remained with them ﬁfteen years. Her career altogether was a rough one, _

and the rude buifets which she had encountered seemed to have a hardening effect upon her
temper. Unfortunately for the public, she learned, late in life, to read and write, and having
written some books of'little interest, she used them as a means of extortion. VVa'shington
city was the principal scene of her labors, and woe to the public man who did not buy what-
ever she thrust at him. Besides a series of Black Books, she published a small paper, for

the express purpose of def-aming any one who would not submit to her extortion, and as ‘

\Vashington politicians are not immaculate, it was not diﬂicult for a woman with a coarse
temper and a sharp wit to make herself feared as well as disliked. Aime Royall was the
special pest of Washington city thirty or forty years ago. As an example of the literary
virago, she was probably without a parallel.

“She was the terror of politicians, and especially of Congressmen. I can see her 110w
tramping through the halls of the old Capitol, umbrella in hand, sei:/.ing upon every passer-
by, and oifering her book for sale. Any public man who refused to buy was certain of a
severe philippic in her newspaper, the VVashington Paul Pry, or in that which succeeded it,
The Iluntress. ‘We have the famous Mrs. Royall here,’ writes Justice Story to Mrs. Story,
on the 8th of March, 1827, ‘with her new novel, The Tennesseeans, which she has compelled
the Chief Justice and myself to buy, to avoid a castigation. I shall bring it home for your
ediﬁcation.’ She wrote and printed a great deal, but seemed to rely almost entirely upon
her ability to blacken private character. Among her productions were Sketches of History,
Life, and Manners in the United States, published in 1826; the Black Book, published in
1828, and continued in .1820; and her Southern Tour, the second series of the Black Book,
which appeared in 1880-31 ; The. Tennesseeans, a novel, and Letters from Alabama on various

subjects in 1830. Her newspapers were badly printed and badly written, and her squibs and

stories more remarkable for bitterness than for wit. She was a woman of great industry
and astonishing memory, but at last she seemed to tire of a vocation which grew more and
more unproﬁtable with better times and sweeter manners.” —-John W. Forney.

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 309

MRS. ELIZA W. FARNHAM, 1815-1864, was a Miss Burhaus of Rensselaerville, N. Y. She was
married in 1836 to Mr. Thomas J. I4‘-arnham. In 1844, she was appoiiiteil matron of the
female department of the Sing Sing Prison. In 1848 she was C011neCt;‘<l with the Institution
for the Blind, in Boston. In 1849, she went with her husband to California, where she re-
maineduntil 1856. On returning to New York, she devoted herself for some years to organ-
izing a society to aid emigrant women in going out West. She wrote several works, most
of them connected with and illustrating her various projects for elevating the status of the
commoner classes of her sex. The following works are named: Life in the Prairie Land;
California Indoor and Out; My Early Days ; The Era of Women.

Mrs. Hale.

Mns. SARAH J OSEPHA HALE, 1790 , like several other of the noble
Women menti._oned in this section, is known all over the land by her life-long
efforts to promote the intellectual elevation of her sex. Her work in this
behalf has differed, however, from that of Mrs. Willard and Mrs. Phelps, in
that she has labored with her pen only. Besides numerous volumes of an
attractive and useful kind, she has continued for forty-ﬁve years to cater
monthly for the intellectual entertainment of her countrymen, through the
columns of The Lady’s Book and its predecessor The Ladies’ Magazine.
The high standard of domestic morals always observable in these magazines
has undoubtedly done much towards preserving the purity of American
homes, and for this service the public is largely indebted to the sound sense
of Sarah Josepha Hale.

Mrs. Hale is a native of Newport, N. H. Her maiden name was Buell. Her husband,
David Hale, was a lawyer. By his death, she was left the sole protector of five children, the
eldest then but seven years old. It was in the hope of gaining for them the means of sup-
port and education, she engaged in authorship as a profession. C

Her ﬁrst venture was a small volume of Poems, printed for her beneﬁt by the Freemasons,
of which fraternity her husband had been a member. "Ihis was followed by Northwood, a
novel, in two volumes, published in 1827.

In 1828, she. went to Boston to edit The Ladies’ Magazine, the ﬁrst American periodical
devoted exclusively to her sex. She continued in this work until 1837, when the magazine
was merged in The Lady’s Book, and transferred to Philadelphia. She then removed to
Philadelphia, and has lived there ever since, having charge of the literary department of the
magazine. I

Her other publications have been the following: Flora’s Interpreter; Sketches of Ameri-
can Character; Traits of American Life; The Ladies’ Wreath, a selection from the female
poets of England and America; A Complete Dictionary of Poetical Quotations; The Opal;
The Good Housekeeper; Grosvenor, a tragedy; Alice of the Sea; Three Hours, or The Vigil
 Love, and other Poems; Harry Guy, the Widow’s Son, a romance of the sea; The Judge,
a_.drama of American Life; Love, or Woman’s Destiny, a poem. She has also edited the

‘Letters of Madame Sévigné and Lady Montagu, and The Mother’s Legacie to her Unborne

Childe by Elizabeth Joceline. _

Mrs. Hale’s greatest work of all remains to be mentioned. That is her Woman’s Record,
a large volume of 918 pages, royal 8V0, containing biographical sketches of all distinguished
women from the earliest times down to the year 1868, and illustrated by 230 portraits.

MP8. Tuthill.

MRs. LOUISA CAROLINE TUTHILL, 1799 ————, has had more than ordi-=
nary success as a writer of books for the young, and she was one of the
earliest to engage extensively in that line of composition. _ Her stories are
marked by sobriety and good sense, and are entirely free from the extrava-
gance and sensationalism which disﬁgure too many of the books now Written
for juvenile readers. Her books for the young are numerous, and have
been very popular. -

Mrs. Tuthill’s maiden name was Huggins. She was born in New Haven, and educated
partly there, and partly at Litchﬁeld. She was married in 1817 to Cornelius Tuthill, Esq., a
lawyer of Newburgh, who after his marriage settled in New Haven. Mr. Tuthill himself
was of a literary turn, and his wife’s first efforts at authorship were due to his suggestions
and encouragement. He with two friends projected and carried on for a time a literary
paper, The Microscope, of which he was the editor. Mr. Tuthill died in 1825, leaving a
widow and four children, ——- one son and three daughters.

Mrs. Tuthill’s ﬁrst publication to which she put her name was The Ladies’ Reader, 1839.
It was a book intended to teach rhetoric as well as reading, the selections being all made
and arranged with a View to illustrate rhetorical principles. Her next book was called The
Young Lady’s llome, being a collection of tales and essays designed to continue a young
lady’s education after she had left school. Her largest work is A History of Architecture.

Her other publications, mostly story-books, are the following: I will be a Lady; I will he
a Gentleman; Onward, right Onward; Anything for Sport; A Strike for Freedom; The
Lawyer; The Artist; The Mechanic; Braggadocio; Queer Bonnets; Tip-Top; Beautiful
Bertha; Joy and Care; Reality; Get Money; Edith; I will be a Soldier; I will be a Sailor;
Romantic Belinda; True Manliness, etc. Mrs. Tuthill has been living in Princeton, N. J.,
since 1848. _

One of Mrs. Tuthill’s daughters, who declines giving her name to the public, has written
a large number of Sunday-school books, which are among the best that have appeared from
any quarter. Some of them are published under the name of “ AuntFriendly.” The following
is the list: Poor Little Joe ; Bound Out ; I-Iatty and Marcus; Kate Darley; The Orange Seed ;
The Little Musicians; Mcggie of the Pines ; 8 Mary Burns ; Heart and Hand; Coming to the
Light, or Fidgety Skeert; The Babes in the Basket; Under the Pear-Tree; The Picket

Mas. FRANCES H. (WHIPPLE) GREEN, , was bor11 in Smithﬁeld, R. I., and was de-
scended on both sides from families of honorable distinction in the history of that State.
Being early thrown upon her own resources by the misfortunes of her father, she resorted
to literary composition as a means of support. Her principal publications are the follow
ing: Memories of Eleanor Elbridge, a colored woman, 30,000 copies sold; The Mechanic,
addressed to operatives, 1841; Might and Right, a history of the attempted revolution in
Rhode Island in 1842, known as theeDorr Insurrection. In that same year she con-
ducted The Wampanoag, a- journal devoted to the elevation of the laboring classes, and in
1848 she became editor of The Young People’s Journal, of New York. She contributed"

Iargely to various “reform periodicals.” Among her poems may be named The Dwarf’s
Story, and Nanuntenoo, a Legend of the Narragansetts.

HARRIET FARLEY, -—-— , one of the factorygirls at Lowell, and a native of New Hamp-
shire, began, in 18411, the publication of a magazine, The Lowell Offering, the contents of
which were wholly original with herself and her fellow-operatives. Both she and the other
girls who wrote for the magazine were laborers i11 the factory ; they had had no education
but that offered by the New England common school, and the articles were written at such
intervals of leisure as they could command, while earning their bread by manual labor. Yet
the magazine was respectable for its literary character and was continued for several years
with decided success. A selection from its pages was published by Charles Knight, in Lon-
don, in 1849, entitled Mind among the Spindles, and attracted great applause.

President Quincy.

JOSIAH QUINCY, LL. 1)., 1772—1864, long the honored President of Har-
vard University, wrote much for the public, but chieﬂy in the form of pam-
phlets and addresses on special occasions. His principal work in book form
was A History of Harvard University.

President Quincy was a son of Josiah Quincy, of Revolutionary-memory, and was born in
Boston. He graduated at Cambridge, in the class of 1790. He was a lawyer by profession,
and took an active part in political affairs, both those of his own State and those of the
United States. He held various important positions of honor and trust, and was the leader
of the old Federalist party, opposing the Non-intercourse and Embargo Law, and the war
with England in 1812. He was President of Harvard from 1829 to 1845. President Quincy’s
publications, nearly ﬁfty in number, are mostly in the form of pamphlets on special occa-
sions, and therefore not easily enumerated in a work like the present. The following are
the titles of some of his larger works: History of Harvard University, 2 vols.; History of
the Boston Athenzeum, with Biographical Notes of its Deceased Founders; A Municipal
History of the Town and City of Boston during Two Centuries; Memoir of the Life of John
Quincy Adams; Memoir of James Grahame, LL. D.; Memoir of the Life of Josiah Quincy, Jr.
——EDMUND QUINCY, 1808 , son of President Quincy, and a graduate of Harvard, of the
class of 1827, besides contributions to periodicals and magazines, has published Wansley, a
Story without a Moral.

HENRY WARE, JR., 1). D., 1794-1813, son of the Dr. Ware mentioned in the preceding chap-
ter, was born at Hingham. He was educated at the Phillips Academy, Andover, and at
Harvard. He became pastor of the Second Church, Boston, in 1816, and preached there with
great acceptance for thirteen‘ years. In 1829, ’30, he travelled extensively in Europe, and
in 1830 he became Parkman Professor of Pulpit Eloquence in the Divinity School of Har-
vard, which position he held until 1842. A selection from his writings was published after
his death, in 4 vols. 8vo. They contain, The Feast of Ta-bernacles, a poem; The Recollec-
tions of Jotham Anderson, a tale drawn in part from his own experience; Biographical
Essays, etc.

WILLIAM WARE, D. D., 1797-1852, a brother of the one just named, was also born at Hing-
ham. lie was graduated at Harvard in 1816. He preached in Unitarian churches in various
places — New York city, West Cambridge, etc., from 1820 to 1845, when ill health obliged him
to relinquish all pastoral duty. His first work, Letters from Palmyra, publishedin 1836, at-
tracted general attention. They purport to be letters from a young nobleman of Rome who
visited Palmyra during the reign of Queen Zenobia, and are among the most successful

efforts to reproduce for the modern reader the every-day life of the Roman empire. In 1838
he published another work of the same kind, called Probus, introducing the reader to the
city of Rome during the time of the last great persecution of the Christians. Another work,
Julian, depicts scenes in Judea and the cruciﬁxion of the Saviour. After his return from
Europe he Wrote Sketches of European Capitals, delivered originally as public lectures. His
last work was Lectures on Allston, in which he reviews in detail each of the works of that
great artist. Dr. Ware also edited the Christian Examiner for several years.

OLIVER WILLI:1RI BOURNE PEABODY, 1799-1848, studied at Harvard ; practised law for many
years, and edited or assisted in editing several newspapers and also the North American Re-
view. During the later years of his life he was pastor of a Unitarian congregation in Ver-
mont. He contributed -many articles to the reviews and the papers, and published an
annotated edition of Shakespeare. He also contributed to Sparks’s Library of American
Biography the lives of Putnam and Sullivan.

"WILLIAM BOURNE OLIVER PEABODY, 1799-1847, twin-brother of 0. W. B. Peabody, like his
brother, studied at Harvard, and for upwards of twenty years was pastor of a Unitarian
church in Springﬁeld, Mass. He contributed several pieces to Sparks’s Library of Ameri-
can Biography, and nearly ﬁfty articles to the North American Review. After his death
appeared a volume of Literary Remains. Several poems by him were published in the
Christian Examiner and other papers, and are well-known, such as Monadnock, Hymn of
Nature, Winter Night, etc.

GEORGE B. EMERSON, 1797 ———, is a native of Maine, and a graduate of Harvard. He is
extensively and most favorably known as an educator. He wrote, in conjunction with
Bishop Alonzo Potter, The School and The Schoolmaster, a work which had a wide circu-
lation. He wrote also A Report on the Trees and Shrubs Growing Naturally in Massachu-
setts. Several of his Lectures on Education have been published, and he has contributed to
the North American Review and the Christian Examiner.

FRANCIS C. G-RAY, LL. D., 1790~1856, was a native of Salem, Mass., a graduate of Harvard,
a lawyer by profession, but much addicted to literature. All the latter part of his life was
spent in Boston, Where he was one‘ of the acknowledged literary celebrities ofithe town.
His writings, beyond a pretty long list of Addresses, etc., consisted mainly of contributions
to the North American Review, of which sixteen are enumerated.

SAMUEL M. WORCESTER, D. D., 1701-1866, son of Samuel Worcester, was born at Fitchburg,
Mass., andigraduated at Harvard, in the class of 1822. He was Tutor in Amherst in 1823,
and Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory there from 1825 to 1831-; became pastor of the Taberu
nacle Church at Salem in 1834; was Recording Secretary of the A. B. C. F. M. from 1847 to
1866. He published Essays on Slavery; a number of Sermons and Discourses; and a revised
edition of the Hymn-Book put forth by his father.

Horace Mann.

HORACE MANN, LL. D., 1796-1859, is universally known by his Writings
and labors in the cause of popular education. He gave to that cause a new

and important impulse, the beneﬁts of Which have been felt far beyond the

limits of his own time or of his personal labors. Hiswritings Were con-
ﬁned chieﬂy to his Annual Reports and his Lectures and Addresses.

Mr. Mann was a native of Franklin, Mass. Being poor, and with almost no advantages of

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 313

books or of education, he fought his way by hard Work and self-denial into and through
Brown University, where, in 1819, he was graduated with the highest honors of his class.
After graduation he studied law, and in 1828 was elected to the State Legislature, where
he distinguished himself by his zeal for education and temperance, and other philanthropic
subjects. Somewhat later, he was chosen a member of the State Senate, and then President
of the Senate. The establishment of the State Lunatic Hospital, at Worcester, is due mainly
to his exertions.

In 1837, Mr. Mann was elected Secretary to the Massachusetts‘Board of Education, a posi-
tion which he held for eleven years. His labors and writings in this office constitute his
chief claim to distinction. His Annual Reports, instead of being mere bundles of dry sta-
tistics, were ﬁlled with reasoning and argument, and oftentimes with burning eloquence.
His theories of education were not always of the sou ndest. But they were put forth with a
power of persuasion that made them models of style for such productions. By these Re-
ports, and by his public Lectures and Addresses, he unquestionably gave a great impulse
to popular education, not only in Massachusetts, but throughout the country. ~‘

From 1848 to 1852- he was in Congress. In 1852, he was elected President of Antioch Col
lege, in Ohio, in which office he continued until his death.

His publications, besides his Annual Reports, are: Lectures on Education; Report of an
Educational Tour in Germany. Great Britain, and Ireland, the best perhaps of all his works;
A Few Thoughts for a Young Man on Entering Life; A Few Thoughts on the Powers and
Duties of Woman; Report of the Educational Census of Great Britain, a work often quoted
in England; Form and Arrangement of School-Houses, etc. A Life of Horace Mann has
been written by his widow.

Philip Lindsley, D. D._

PHILIP LINDSLEY, D. D., 1786—l855, was among the foremost men of
his time in the work of higher education. His labors as President of
Nashville University for a period of a quarter of a century made a deep
impression upon the generation with which he Was associated, while his
published Lectures and Addresses form a valuable permanent addition to
our stock of educational literature. 1 ' '

Dr. Lindsley was born near Morristown, N. J. He was ﬁtted for College at the famous
school of Robert Finley, at Basking Ridge, N. J. He graduated at Princeton in 1804; was
Tutor in the College, 1807-1809; Professor, 1813-1824; during the last seven years of this
time was Vice-President, and on the resignation of Dr. Green was elected President, but de-
clined. In 1825 he was inaugurated ‘as President of the University of Nashville, which
oﬂice he held until 1850, when he resigned to become Professor in the Theological Seminary
at New Albany, Indiana. The estimate in which he was held by the public is shown by
the numerous and persistent offers which were made him by various institutions of learn-
ing, east and west. Besides the offer of the Presidency of Princeton, he was chosen Provost
of the University of Pennsylvania, President of Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa., of Wash-
ington College, Lexington, Va., of Transylvania University, Kentucky, of the University of
Alabama, besides two or three other institutions of less note. All these offers, some of them
made two or three times and urgently pressed upon his acceptance, he persistently declined,
preferring to devote himself resolutely to his one chosen Work of building up in the south-
westlregion of the United States an institution of learning of the widest scope and the most
liberal culture. If in this enterprise he did not succeed to the full extent of his desires, be
yet achieved a noble work worthy of his genius and of his high aspirations.

tional topics. They were collected and published in 1866, in 3 large vo1s., 8vo, with a
memoir by Le Roy J. Halsey, D. D.‘

DAVID P. PAGE, 1810-1848, the first Principal of the State Normal School at Albany, was a
native of Epping, N. II. He was greatly esteemed in his profession, and his early death was
lamented by friends of education in every part of the United States. I-Iis Theory and Practice
of Teaching, embodying many of his educational views, has been a very useful and popular
work.

DAVID MEREDITH REESE, M.D., LL.D‘., 1800-1861, was for a time prominently before the
public in connection with the cause of education. He was Superintendent of Public Schools
of the city of New York, and edited the American reprint of Chambers’s Educational Course,
Scientiﬁc Section, 12 vols. He wrote Strictures on Health, sale 30,000 copies; Review of the
Anti—SIavery Society’s Report, sale 25,000 copies ; Phrenology known by its Fruits; Quaker-

Brown University, and was at one time Professor of Modern Languages in the same. He

was also Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. In that position he advocated '

the policy of devoting a large part of the income of the institution to library purposes, and
therein took issue against the views of the Secretary, Prof. Henry, and of a majority of the

Schoolcraft.

HENRY Rown scnoorcnim, LL. n., 01798-1864, has acquired for him-
self an enduring name, by his writings and researches in reference to the
Indian tribes of North America.

Mr. Schoolcraft was born at Watervliet, N. Y. He studied at Union College, but did not
complete the course.

Mr. Schoolcraft commenced at a very early age that series of researches into Indian anti-.
quities with which his name is so indissolubly associated. He spent in all thirty years
among the Indians, chieﬂy at Michilimackinac. He was the founder of the Michigan Ills-
torical Society, and of the Algic Society at Detroit. In 1882 he discovered the sources of the
Mississippi River in Itasca Lake. The latter part of ‘his life was passed in Washington, D.C.

I-Iis publications are very numerous. The best known of them are his Narrative Journal
of Travels to the Source of the Mississippi; Narrative of an Expedition through the Upper
Mississippi to Itasca Lake; Summary Narrative of an Exploring Expedition to the Sources
of the Upper Mississippi ; The Myth of Hiawatha (the basis of Longfellow’s celebrated poem) ;
Personal Memoirs of a Residence of. Thirty Years among the Indian Tribes, etc. His great
work is his Historical Information concerning the Indian Tribes, etc., published by act of
Congress, in six large quarto volumes, profusely and handsomely illustrated. The work
contains an immense amount. of information upon everything relating to Indian manners,

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 315

mythology, antiquities, language, etc., but so poorly digested and so deﬁcient in philosophic
method as to be, in the words of Humboldt, "' almost worthless.” The volumes are a mine
from which the gold is yet to be extracted by some future explorer.

GEORGE CATLIN, 1796 , artist and writer, a native of Pennsylvania, spent eight years
ax. mg the Indians, taking notes and painting portraits and costumes, and. thus collected
the ‘materials for his famous Indian Gallery, which be exhibited in Europe. He published
ll'::istrations of the Manners, Customs, and Conditions of the North American Indians, 2

J OHN LLOYD STEPHENS, 1805-1852, the well-known American traveller, was born at Shrews-
bury, N. J., and graduated at Columbia, in the class of 1822.

In 1834-(3 he travelled in Europe and the East, and published the results of his observation
in 1837 and 1838, in two works entitled respectively Incidents of Travel in Egypt, Arabia
Petreea and the Holy Land, and Incidents of Travel in Greece, Russia, Turkey, and Poland.
These works were very favorably received by critics and the public.

Mr. Stephens is even better known, however, as a traveller in Central America. He
visited that region three or four times and superintended the construction of the Panama
Iiailroad. Two works of travel were published by him: Incidents of Travel in Central
America, and Incidents of Travel in Yucatan, both profusely illustrated by Catherwood. IIe
i'urnished the text for Catherwood’s Views _of Ancient Monuments in Central America.
Stephens and Squier are the two great American authorities on the subject of Central Ameri-
ca. His works have met with a wide sale, and contain the record of many important dis-
coveries presented in a pleasing style.

ness, but not finding it congenial, and not liking Boston society, he went to Cincinnati, in
1832, studied law, and began the practice, but ﬁnding it no more congenial than commerce,
he began in 1834 a literary career. He wrote for the Western Monthly, and united with
Gallaglier and Shreve in The Cincinnati Mirror. In 1837 he contributed a series of critical
and histericalarticles for The New York Quarterly, and The North American Review. He
publislied also The Annals of the West, “ a work whose accuracy, completeness, thorough-
Iless of research, clear method, and powerful perspicuity of style show his admirable qualiﬁ-
cations for an historian.” —-‘V17. II. Ohcwming. In 1839, he became minister at large to the
poor of Cincinnati, and soon after pastor of the Unitarian church. He continued in this rela-
tion until his death in 1849. ‘

and had a ﬁne opportunity for witnessing the scenes of the war. His letters, describing the
progress of affairs, were the ﬁrst that reached the United States,and were extensively copied
in the newspapers. He prepared also, during that year, two volumes on the subject, Our
Army on the Rio Grande, and Our Army at Monterey,whicl1 furnished the materials for
most of the subsequent publications on the subject by compilers. Mr. Thorpe took an
active part in ,_the canvass for General Taylor for the Presidency, passing through the Soutl1-
western States as apolitical speaker. In 1853, he removed to New York, and engaged in
literary pursuits. While in New Orleans he had published many tales, racy of Western

toration of the Jews; Gleanings from a Gatliered Harvest, being newspaper articles repro-
duced in book form. He also wrote a number of Plays.

Mr. Noah was of the Jewish faith. After his return from Africa, he made a quixotic
attempt to gather the Jews, from all parts of the world, to Grand Island, in the Niagara
River, where they were to constitute a Hebrew Commonwealth and build a New J ernsal em,
Major Noah being the Judge in Israel. He seems to have been in earnest in the matter; the
difficulty was, no one responded to his call, and the kind-hearted old gentleman was a good
deal laughed at.

Gallaudet.

REV. THOMAS H. GALLAUDET, LL. D., 1787-1851, is justly celebrated
for his efforts in the education of _deaf mutes. He was indeed the apostle
of this work in the United States. Besides ‘his labors in this direction,
he Wrote many valuable Works. Among these, two deserve particular
mention, The Child’s Book of the Soul, and the Youth’s Book of Natural

W Theology. »

Mr. Gallaudet was born in Philadelphia. He’ studied theology in Andover, Mass, and
preached, but was never settled in the ministry. Feeling a special interest in the condition
of deaf mutes, he helped in 1815, to forn1 an association for their relief, and went to Paris to
qualify himself as an instructor, by studying the system there perfected by the Abbé Sicard.
The institution at Hartford, the ﬁrst of the kind in the United States, was opened under his
direction in 1817, and he continued to superintend it until 1830, when failing health obliged
him to resign.

Dr. Gal1audet’s publications, which are numerous, are all marked by that talent for simpli-
ﬁcation, which was one of the gifts that ﬁtted him for his peculiar work, and which was de-
veloped and strengthened by the work itself. His two most characteristic works are those
already named, The Child‘s Book of the Soul, and The Youtl1’s Book of Natural Theology.
In both these We see traces of that wonderful skill in analysis and simple conception which
gave him such success in gaining access to the minds of those shut out from ordinary inter-
course with their kind by the closing of what Bunyan calls the ear-gate. -

The principal publications of Dr. Gallaudet, besides these, are the following: The Cl1ild’s
Book on Repentance; The Child’s Book of Bible Stories; a part of the Youth’s Scripture
Biography, 11 vols., published by the American Tract Society, the series being completed by
Rev. H. Hooker; An Elementary Book for the Use of the Deaf and Dumb; Principles of
Teaching; The Child’s Picture, Deﬁning, and Reading Book; The Mother’s Primer; The
School and Family Dictionary and Illustrative Deﬁner; Discourses on Various Points of
Christian Faith and Practice, delivered in Paris in 1816, while he was studying with the
Abbe Sicard; also several pamphlet sermons and addresses on various occasions.

HARVEY P. PEET, LL.D., 1794-1873, like his former associate, Dr. Gallaudet, had a national
reputation as an instructor of the deaf and dumb. He was engaged, from 1831 until his
death, as Principal of the New York Institution. Besides Addresses and Reports on the

subject, he wrote A Course of Instruction for the Deaf and Dumb, 4 vols., which is exten-
sively used.

JOHN WILSON, 1802-1868, the Punetuist, was born in Glasgow, and coming to the United
States settled in‘ Boston about the year 1843, where he acquired a high reputation as a
printer. He published several Works in favor of Universalism: Scripture Proofs and Illus-
trations of Universalism; The Concessions of Trinitarians ; Unitarian Principles Conﬁrmed
by Trinitarian Testimonies. But his chief work was one in the line of his business, namely,
A Treatise on English Punctuation, and an abridgment of the same, The Elements of Punc-
tuation. In this work, Mr. Wilson places punctuation on a clear and intelligible grammat-
ical basis, and so completely exhausts _the subject as to leave nothing to be desired, —— unless
it be a law of Congress, making it a penal offence for any printer, author, schoolmaster, or
professor, not to have a copy always on his table 1

JOHN K. MITCHELL, M. D., 1798-1858, a very eminent medical lecturer and practitioner of
Philadelphia, was born in Shepardstown, Va. His early education was received in Edin-

the University of Pennsylvania in 1819, being then twenty-one years old. Besides his medi-
cal Writings, which are numerous and valuable, he published St. Helena, a poem; Indecision
and Other Poems; On the W-’isdom, Goodness, and Power of God, as illustrated in the Prop-
erties of Water, besides numerous contributions to literary periodicals.

F. A. Packard.

FREDERICK A. PACKARD, LL. D., 1794-1867, Was for a period of thirty-
eight years theieditor of the publications of the American Sunday-School
Union, and the controlling spirit of its affairs. He edited more than two
thousand of its publications, big and little, and Wrote or compiled more
than forty of them, besides editing, at different times, The Sunday-School
Magazine, The Sunday-School Journal, and The Youth’s Penny Gazette.
He Wrote also most of the Society’s Annual Reports. -

Mr. Packard was a native of Marlborough, Mass., and a graduate of Harvard, in the class
of 1814. He studied law at Northampton, practised at Springﬁeld from 1817 to 1829, and
While there edited, for ten years, the Hampden Federalist. From 1839 to 1867, a period of
thirty-eight years, he was chief Secretary and Editor of the American Sunday-School
Union.

Mr. Packard’s three most important books were the Union Bible Dictionary, The Teacher
Taught, and The Teacher Teaching. The sale of all these was very large.

He took an active interest in the subject of prisondiscipline, and wrote several pamphlets
about it. He wrote a pamphlet, The Daily Public School of the United States, attacking the
system, and he contributed occasionally to the reviews, but for the most part conﬁned his
labors to the publications and the aﬁairs of the society.

REMBRANDT PEALE, 1778-1860, son of Char1es.Wilson Peale, was a Philadelphian by birth
and residence. He was a painter by profession, and attained in it a just celebrity. He had
alove for the art amounting to a passion, and he pursued it with unﬂagging zeal to the last.
Mr. Peale had an earnest conviction that drawing, so far at least as training the eye to observe,
and the hand to make, the elements of form, should be a part of primary education, holding the
same place in the programme of studies as learning to read, spell, and compute, and actu-
ally preceding the learning to write. He prepared a small work on this subject, called
Graphics, reducing the art to its simplest elements, and labored earnestly for many years to

FROM 1830 TO 1850. 321

secure the introduction of the study into the primary schools. His efforts have left some
impression, but not to the extent of his wishes. Besides his labors in this line, Mr. Peale
wrote Notes 011 Italy, Portfolio of an Artist, etc.

JAMES D. NOUR-SE,1816-1854, a native of Bardstown, Ky., edited at different times three
different papers in Bardstown, and at the time of his death was editor of the lntelligencer,
in St. Louis. He wrote the Philosophy of History; Remarks on the Past and its Lega-
cies to American Society, or God in History; The Forest Knight, a Novel; and Leaven-
worth, a story of the prairies.

JOSEPH G. PASSMORE, D. D., 1818-1866, was a native of Lancaster, Pa. He entered the min-
istry of the Episcopal Church in 18-18. He was for many years Professor of Mental Philoso-
phy in the College of St. James, Maryland. He published Footprints, or Fugitive Poems;
and an edition of Bishop Butler’s Ethical Discourses, with an Introductory Essay on the
author’s Life and Writings.

Nicholas Biddle.

NICHOLAS BIDDLE, LL.D., 1786-1844, occupied so conspicuous a posi-
tion as a ﬁnancier, and as President of the United States Bank, that his
claims as a literary man have almost been lost sight of. He was, however,
one of the most brilliant Writers of his day, and his articles in Vindication
of the Bank, as well as his literary addresses, attracted great attention by
their polished Wit and by the singular force and elegance of his language.

Mr. Biddle was a native of Philadelphia, of Quaker blood, his ancestors having come over
with William Penn. He graduated at Princeton, in the class of 1801. From 180-1 to 1807 he was
Secretary of Legation in Paris and London. On his return to Philadelphia he practised law.
He edited The Portfolio, compiled a Commercial Digest, and prepared the Narrative of Lewis
& C1arke’s Expedition to the Paciﬁc. He was at different times in the State Legislature,
and President of the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, of the Girard College, and
of numerous other public institutions. His great work, however, was that performed as
President of the Bank of the United States. His two most noted public addresses were A

Eulogium on Jefferson, before the American Philosophical Society, and An Address before ’

the Alumni of Princeton on the Duties of an American.

JOSEPH R. CHANDLER, 1792 , a native of Massachusetts, but a resident of Philadelphia,
edited for a long time the United States Gazette, in which position he acquired a high repu-
tation as a journalist. He published an English Grammar, and numerous addresses on public
occasions, besides the speeches which he delivered while in Congress.

ROBERT SEARS, 1810 ————, was born in St. John, New Brunswick. He has been an indus-
trious and successful compiler. His compilations, mostly pictorial, have had an enormous
sale. The following are the titles of a few: Illustrations of the Bible; Family Bible; His-
tory of China and India; Thrilling Incidents of the Wars of the United States ; Treasury of
Knowledge and Cyclopeedia of Art ; Information for the People; VVonders of the World, etc.,
etc. '

EDWIN VVILLIAMS, 1797-1854, an industrious writer on statistics, was born at Norwich,
Conn. He resided for many years in New York. He published The New York Annual
Register, from 1830 to 1845; The Statesman’s Manual, 4 vols., 8vo ; The New Universal Ga-
zetteer; The Treasury of Knowledge, etc. ‘

V

322 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

FRANK B. GOODRICH, 1826 ——, is a native of Boston, and a son of -the well known writer,
Samuel G. Goodrich, alias‘ Peter Parley. The son has written several works of a popular
character, and was for some time the Paris correspondent of the New York Times, under the
signature of Dick Tinto. His separate publications are Tri-Colored Sketches of Paris ;_Court
of Napoleon, or Society under the First Empire; Women of Beauty and Heroism; Man
upon the Sea, or A History of Maritime Adventure, Exploration, and Discovery.

S. G. Goodrich——“ Peter Parley.”

SAMUEL GRIswoLD GooDRIoH, 17 93-1863, better known as Peter Par-
ley, was remarkably successful in simplifying various kinds of knowl-
edge, chieﬂy historical, so as to make it easily understood by young readers,
and consequently useful as a means of education. The Peter Parley books

form a noticeable feature in the literature of the period.

Mr. Goodrich was a native of Ridlgeﬁeld, Conn. After attaining his majority, he began
business as a bookseller, in Hartford, and continued in the business for several years. In
1823-4 he travelled abroad, visiting England, France, Germany, and Holland. On returning
to the United States, he entered upon his career as a writer, assuming the name of Peter
Parley, now a household word thoughout Europe and America. In 1851, he was appointed
United States Consul at Paris, and he continued to reside there for many years in that
capacity.

Mr. Goodrich’s pen was kept busy to the close of his life,—how busy, may be inferred
from the fact that he was either author or editor of one hundred and seventy distinct vol-
umes ; and how far hi_s labors were acceptable, may be judged from the fact that over seven
millions of volumes of his works were sold during his lifetime. It is true that many of these
books were compilations, and that in the compilation he had the aid of several colaborers. It
is also true that much of what he published was not of a very high order of literature. But
those who sneer at such writing as entirely beneath the dignity of authorship, would do
well to try their hands at a few pages of Peter Parlcyism before pronouncing a ﬁnal verdict.
Mr. Goodrich made no pretence to classical or critical erudition or to historical research, but

he had a special gift for writing in a style suited to the taste and comprehension of children, '

and he exercised his gift in a way that has brought lasting honor to him, and has been a
public beneﬁt to his race.

The following are his leading works: Peter Parley books, 116 vols., on a great variety of
subjects likely to interest children; School books (Histories, Geographies, Readers, etc.),
27 vo1s.; Miscellaneous, 27 vols. Among the miscellaneous are three volumes of poems.
Allibone’s Dictionary of Authors contains a minute enumeration of Mr. Goodrich’s works,
prepared by himself, and stating in regard to each volume the circumstances of its author-
ship, showing which were exclusively his own, and in regard to those compiled by himself
and others jointly, showing what share he had in them. The record is a curious and valu-
able one. It was called out by an attack made on the author by a Boston critic. alleging
that the Peter Parley books were really not the work of Mr. Goodrich but of one of his

assistants.

 

 

CHAPTER V.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME.

THE present Chapter treats mainly of writers still living.

Some Writers still living are included in the previous chapter because it is many years
since they have published anything. Thciractivity in authorship belongs to a former
generation.

The Writers included in Chapter V. are divided into eleven
sections: 1. The Poets, beginning with Longfellow; 2. Writei°s
on Literature and Criticism, beginning with Lowell ; 3. Magazine
ists, beginning with Holmes ; 4. Journalists, beginning with Ben»
nett ; 5. Humorists, beginning with Artemus Ward ; 6. Miscel-=
laneous Vlfriters, beginning with Bayard Taylor; 7. Novelists
and writers of Tales and Travels, beginning with Hawthorne;
8. Historians, beginning with Prescott; 9. ‘Writers on Politics
and Political Economy, beginning with Henry C. Carey; 10. Sci-
entiﬁc Writers, beginning with Agassiz ; 11. W1°iters on Religion
and Theology, beginning with Hodge.

I. THE POETS.

Longfellow.

HENRY VVADSWORTH LONGFELLOW, LL. D.,-1807 , is by general
consent the most distinguished living representative of the poetical litera-
ture of the country. He is clearly our American Poet-Laureate, ——crowned
by general suffrage, alike of the learned and the unlearned, the critic and
those who read only for the pleasure his sweet verse gives them.

Mr. Longfellow is a native of Portland, Me. He graduated at Eowdoin

323

324 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

College in the class of 1825, and was appointed Professor of Modern Lan-
guages in the same, in 1826. After receiving this appointment, he passed four
years in Europe in ﬁtting himself for the post. In 1835, he succeeded

gGreorge Ticknor in the chair of Belles-Lettres at Harvard, when he again

Visited Europe. He retired from his professorship at Harvard in 1854, and
has since devoted himself exclusively to literature.

Longfellow is undoubtedly the most conspicuous name hitherto, in the
list of American poets and writers of imagination. Hawthorne is more
profound and subtle, Bryant more robust, Holmes and Lowell and Saxe‘ are
more witty. But Longfellow’s name symbolizes allvthat is liberal, tender,
and cultured in American letters. His career has been one of unbroken
and ever growing popularity.

Prof. Longfellow began publication Very early. Several of his poems
which appeared before he was yet nineteen, and while still a student in col-
lege, have been retained in the collected edition of his works. One of these
college poems was the Hymn of the Moravian Nuns of Bethlehem, which
early found its way into the reading books of the common schools.

His ﬁrst volume, 1833, was Coplas de Manrique, —- a translation from the
Spanish, with an Essay on the Moral and Devotional Poetry of Spain. .

His next volume, 1835, was Out-re-Mer, a Pilgrimage beyond the Sea.
It was a poetical prose work, not unlike the Sketch-Book of VVashington
Irving.

A third volume, also of poetical prose, was Hyperion, a Romance, 1839.

The same year appeared Voices of the Night, a collection of short poems,
containing among others A Psalm of Life, The Reaper and the Flowers,
and The Beleaguered City. This volume contained likewise a reprint of
certain Early Poems, already referred to, and a large number of poetical
translations from the Spanish, German, Italian, French, Danish, and Anglo-
Saxon.

In 1841, appeared Ballads and other Poems, containing several pieces
which attained immediate and lasting favor, such as The Skeleton in Armor,
Grod’s-Acre, To the River Charles, Blind Bartimeus, and Excelsior.

Poems on Slavery appeared in 1842, and in the same year The Spanish
Student, a Play, of which the sale has been large.

In 1845, he published The Poets and Poetry of Europe, a large octavo,
containing biographical and critical notices, and translations by himself and
others.

The Belfry of Bruges and other Poems appeared in 1846. The most
noted of the pieces in this collection were The Arsenal at Springﬁeld, and
The Old Clock on the Stairs.

Evangeline, his ﬁrst long poem, was published in 1847.

Kavanagh, a prose tale, descriptive of New England life, appeared in

1849. The same year witnessed the publication of Seaside and Fireside, a A

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 325

collection of short poems. Among these were The Building of the Ship,
Resignation, a.nd Sand of the Desert in an Hour—Glass.

The Golden Legend, his longest single poem, was issued in 1851. It is
a narrative poem, giving a lively picture of monastic and civil life in the
Middle Ages, and is remarkable for its variety of style and versiﬁcation.

The Song of Hiawatha, another long poem, appeared in 1855. Like
Evangeline, it attracted universal attention, both by the freshness of its sub-
ject and the novelty of its versiﬁcation. A '

The Courtship of Miles Standish, another long poem, also immediately
popular, appeared in 1858.

Tales of a Wayside Inn, a collection of poems somewhat after the fashion
of the Canterbury Tales, was published in 1863. The pieces in this collec-

tion which are best known are Paul Revere’ s Ride, and the Birds of Killing-

worth. A continuation of these Tales, called The Second Day, appeared in
1872.

Another collection appeared under the title of Birds of Passage, among
its exquisite gems being The Children’ s Hour, and \/Veariness; and in 1866
was published a volume called Flower-de-Luce and other Poems.

Since that time have appeared New England Tragedies, and the Divine
Tragedy. These last, it is said, are to be ta.ken in connection with The
Golden Legend, published twenty years ago, the whole forming one con-
nected work of art, somewhat as do the successive Arthurian legends of
Tennyson. .

In 1867, appeared the translation of Dante’s Divina Commedia, in three
superb octaves. It is the crowning achievement of Mr. Longfellow’ s remark-
able skill as a translator.

From this rapid sketch, it appears that Mr. Longfellow has been actively
and almost continuously productive as an author for forty-seven years. His
longer poems, The Golden Legend, Evangeline, Hiawatha, Miles Standish,
The Spanish Student, and the translation of Dante, are familiarly known to
all readers of English poetry. Each of his many collections of short pieces
has contained some which have become household words wherever the Eng-
lish tongue is spoken. I

Although Mr. Longfellow has written so much, and on such a variety of
topics, his poetry cannot be said, in strictness, to have a wide range of
thought or characterization. His utterances are in the middle key between
the matter-of-fact and the highly ideal. The chief defect of his poetry is a
want of deep, active passion. The Golden Legend borders upon, if it does
not enter, the domain of the sentimental; and Evangeline is plaintive and
resigned, rather than passionate. There is not, in all his compositions, one
tumultuous outburst of feeling that can be placed by the side of hundreds
that mark his great contemporary, Tennyson. On the other hand, Long-
fellow’s verse is always tender and delicate, unobtrusively winning its way

to the heart. It is the chosen companion of our quiet, unbent moods.
"70

326 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Longfellow’s longer poems are unequal. Hiawatha, so much read and
admired at ﬁrst, has lost much of its popularity. I/Vhatever its merits as a
poem, it can no longer be regarded as a portrait of Indian life and charac-
ter. The Golden Legend, based upon Hartman von Aue’ s Arme Heinrich
(Poor Henry), a well—known German poem of the thirteenth century,con-
tains many beautiful passages, but is not, upon the whole, a durable work.
Evangeline and Miles Standish, on the contrary, will always hold their
own. The former is the best specimen of the hexameter in English, is in-
teresting as a story, and full of the choicest scenes and touches of character,
while the robust ﬁgures of the Puritan captain, in his haps and mishaps,
and of John Alden and Priscilla, are now part and parcel of our national
treasures. Still, coming generations, it is believed, will cherish Longfellow
chieﬂy as a sweet singer. His future fame will rest upon those short, ex-
quisitely simple utterances that speak for the weary heart and aching brain
of all humanity. A

“ Each of his most noted poems is the song of a feeling common to every
mind in moods into which every mind is liable to fall. Thus, A Psalm of
Life, Footsteps of Angels, To the River‘ Charles, Excelsior, The Bridge,
The Gleam of Sunshine, The Day is Done, The Old Clock on the Stairs,
The Arrow and the Song, The Fire of Driftwood, Twilight, The Open
Window, are all most adequate and inexpressibly delicate renderings of
quite universal emotions. There is  humanity in them which is irresist-
ible in the fit measures to which they are wedded.” —G. W. O’m~tz's.

In conclusion, we may add that Longfellow is no.less eminent as a trans-
lator than as an author. His shorter renderings from the French, German,
and Spanish, are perfect reproductions of the spirit and form of the originals,
while his version of the Divina Oommedia is, beyond question, the best
in the language. It has done all that the English tongue is capable of do-
ing in the reproduction of the great Italian master. Besides, by his notes
and- essays accompanying the translation, Longfellow has revealed his re-
markable wealth of scholarship and exquisite taste iniselection.

THE ARROVV AND THE SONG.

I shot an arrow into the air,

It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For, so swiftly it ﬂew, the sight
Could not follow it in its ﬂight.

I breathed a song into the air,

It fell to earth, I knew not where;
For who has sight so keen‘ and strong,
That it can follow the ﬂight of song.

Long, long afterward, in an oak

I found the arrow, still unbroke;

And the song, from beginning to end,

I foundiit again in the heart of a friend.

RESIGNATION.

There is no ﬂock, however watched and tended,
But one dead lamb is there!

There is no ﬁreside, howsoe’er defended,
But has one vacant chair!

The air is full of farewells to t.he dying,
And mournings for the dead;

The heart of Rachel, for her children crying,
Will not be comforted!

Let us be patient! These severe afflictions
Not from the ground arise,

But oftentimes celestial benedictions
Assume this dark disguise.

We see but dimly through the mists and vapors;
Amid these earthly dalnps

What seem to us but sad, funereal tapers
May be heaven’s distant lamps.

There is no death! What seems so is transition;
This life of mortal breath
Is but a suburb of the life elysian,
. Whose portal we call Death.

She is not dead,——the child of our affection,-
But gone unto that school

Vfhere she no longer needs our poor protection,
And Christ himself doth rule.

In that great cloister’s stillness and seclusion,
,By guardian angels led,

Safe from temptation, safe from sin‘s pollution,
She lives, whom we call dead.

Day after day we think what she is doing
In those bright realms of air;

Year after year, her tender steps pursuing,
Behold her grown more fair.

Thus do We walk with her, and keep unbroken
The bond which nature gives,

Thinking that our remembrance, though unspoken,
May reach her where she lives.

Not as a child shall we again behold her; A
For when, with raptures wild,

In our embraces we again enfold her,
She will not be a child;

But a ﬁtir maiden, in her Father’s mansion,
Clothed with celestial grace;

And beautiful with all the s0ul’s expansion
Shall we behold her face.

328

AMERICAN LITERATURE.

And though at times, impetuous with emotion
And anguish long suppressed,

The swelling heart heaves moaning like the ocean,
That cannot be at rest,-

We will be patient, and assuage the feeling
We may not wholly stay:

By silence sanctifying, not concealing,
The grief that must have way.

WEARINESS.

0 little feet! that such long years

Must wander on through hopes and fears,
Must ache and bleed ‘beneath your load;

I, nearer to the wayside inn

Where toil shall cease and rest begin,
Am weary, thinking of your road!

0 little hands! that, weak and strong,
Have still to serve or rule so long,
Have still so long to give or ask:
I, who so much with book and pen
Have toiled among my fellow-men,
Am weary, thinking of your task.

0 little hearts! that throb and beat
With such impatient, feverish heat,
Such limitless and strong desires;
Mine that so long has glowed and burned,
With passions into ashes turned
Now covers and conceals its ﬁres.

0 little souls! as pure and white
And crystalline as rays of light
Direct from heaven, their source divine;
Refracted through the mist of years,
How red my setting sun appears,
How lurid looks this soul of mine!

THE CI-IILDREN’S HOUR.

' Between the dark and the daylight,
When the night is beginning to lower,
Comes a pause in the day’s occupation,
That is known as the Children‘s Hour.

I hear in the chamber above me
The patter of little feet,

The sound of a door that is opened,
And voices soft and sweet.

From my study I see in the lamplight,
Descending the broad hall stair,

Grave Alice, and laughing Allegree,
And Edith with golden hair.

Fnori 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 329

A whisper, and then a silence;
Yet I know by their merry eyes

They are plotting and planning together,
To take me by surprise.

A sudden rush from the stairway,
A sudden raid from the hall I‘

By three doors left unguarded
They enter my castle wall!

They climb up into my turret,
O’er the arms and back of my chair;

If I try to escape, they surround me;
They seem to be everywhere.

They almost devour me with kisses,
Their arms about me entwine,

Till I think of the Bishop of liingen
In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine!

Do you think, 0 blue-eyed banditti,
Because you have scaled the wall,

Such an old mustache as I am,
Is not a match for you all!

I have you fast in my fortress,
And will not let you depart,

But put you down into the dungeon,
In the round-tower of my heart”

And there will I keep you forever,
"Yes, forever and a day, .

Till the walls shall crumble to ruin,
And moulder in dust away!

Whittier.

J OHN GREENLEAF WHITTIER, 1808 , is our leading lyric poet, and,
with the exception perhaps of Byrant, is the one most thoroughly American.
In Mr. VVhittier’s poems, the life, the scenes, the characters portrayed, the
very atmosphere in which they move, are all intensely American. He has
been called the Quaker Poet, in reference to his religious Views and con-
nections, and he has certainly earned for himself the title of Abolitionist,
by his ﬁerce anti-slavery philippics. Yet much of his best poetry, and
especially that of his later years, shows him possessed of a large and truly
catholic spirit, which ﬁnds its way to the heart of every reader.

I Mr. Whittier is a native of Haverhill, Mass., where he passed his boyhood and youth. In
1829 he became editor of the American Manufacturer, a tariff organ. Soon afterwards he
was editor of the New England Weekly, of Hartford. In 1836 he removed to Philadelphia,
became a prominent member of the Anti-Slavery Society, and edited, until 1840, their paper,
The American Freeman. Since that time he has resided in Amesbury, Mass., as Corre-
sponding Editor of The National Era. '

28*

330 A?e.2§ll?.l()iAN LITERATURE.

Whittier is one of the few reformers. who have lived to see the full accomplishment of
their desires without outliving their sense of thankfulness. By birth a Quaker or Friend,
he inherited, in all its force, the inveterate Quaker dislike to bondage. In him, however,
this dislike was not merely passive; it assumed the form of untiring, passionate purpose to
do battle for his ideal of the right and just. In this respect, certainly, W'hittier may be re-
garded as a descendant of the old Puritan ﬁghting stock, only liberalized by Quakerism.
Accordingly we ﬁnd him, during the greater part of his life, devoting his time and energies
to the anti—slavery cause, and regarding his poems —-on which his future fame will rest——as
a secondary matter.

The Proem, dated November, 1847, contains a graceful and touching confession of poetic
imperfection, and yet is one of his happiest efforts. Literary history affords scarcely another
so striking an instance of underestimation of self.

As a prose writer, Whittier’s ﬁrst separate publication was a collection of essays entitled
The Stranger in Lowell, 1845. The Legends of New England, however, which appeared
in 1831, was partly in prose. The Stranger in Lowell was followed by Supernaturalism in
New England, and by Leaves from Margaret Smith’s Journal, an imaginary description of
early New England life. In 1850 there appeared a volume entitled Old Portraits and Modern
Sketches (a collection of ten biographies), and in 1854 a Volume of Literary Recrcationsand
Miscellanies. But the great bulk of Whittier’s prose still lies uncollected in the columns
of the various papers with which he has been connected. Like almost all controversial
writing, it has, we may conjecture, lost its literary value with the peculiar institution which
gave it birth.

As a poet, Whittier ﬁrst appeared in 1831, when he published his Legends of New Eng-
land, in Prose and Verse. The majority of his early poems were ﬁrst published as fugitive
pieces in newspapers and other periodicals, and afterwards re-issued in collections, from
time to time. Thus appeared The Ballads, 1838; Lays of My Home, 1843; The Voices of
Frcedom,1849; The Chapel of the Hermits, 1853; The Panorama and Other Poems, 1856;
Home Ballads, 1860; .In War Time, 1863; National Lyrics, 1865. Mogg Megone and Moll
Pitcher appeared separately in 1836. '

Whittier’s latest productions are Snow-Bound, The Tent on the Beach, Among the Hills,
and Ballads of New England, which have all appeared since 1866.

Not only did Whittier serve the anti-slavery cause with the editor’s pen; he devoted to it’

much of his early poetic ﬁre. The Voices of Freedom are a collection of anti-slavery pieces
of very unequal poetic value. The most deﬁant is the one entitled Massachusetts to Vira
ginia; the bitterest, perhaps, The Christian Slave.

Whittier as a poet is too well known to the American reader to call for any elaborate
analysis of his style. As we turnover the collective edition of his poems, we are astonished
to see the number of pieces that have become household words. Mogg Megone, Maud Mul-
ler, The Angels of Buena Vista, The Vaudois Teacher, My Soul and I, A Dream of Summer,
The Songs of Labor, The Barefoot Boy, Skipper Ireson’s Ride, Barbara Frietchie—wh-at a
host of associations thevery names evoke! They, and their twin-brethren, have long since
passed into the hearts of the poet’s countrymen. They are a part of ourselves. If we seek
for the cause of this real popularity, we shall ﬁnd one cause of it at least in Whittier’s intense
nationality. Bryant excepted, there is not an American poet who can, in this respect, be
compared with Whittier. Longfellow and Lowell, althoughtmore richly endowed with the
poetic faculty, are at the same time‘ more cosmopolitan, more foreign. But setting aside a
very few songs on borrowed themes, we may say that everything that Whittier has written
comes directly home to the American. What, for instance, can be more beautiful in its
genial simplicity and also more characteristic than Snow-Bound, or Among the Hills?
Snow-Bound, in particular, may safely be ranked among the sweetest, most endearing idyls
of the language. In it we see the ﬁery crusader of the Voices of Freedom softened and mel-
lowed into the retrospective artist. The period of fermentation has passed, the puriﬁcation
is complete. Harsh numbers are tuned to perfect accord, hatred of oppression has made

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 331

Way for broad humanity. If we read the Proem of 1847 side by side with Snow-Bound, we
shall have little diﬂiculty invpersuading ourselves that Whittier has not only nothing to

fear from a comparison with melodious Spenser and Sidney, but has even surpassed them

in artistic reality.
“Whittier is the most thoroughly American of all our native poets.”——R. Shelton Maclcenzie.
“He seems, in some of his lyrics, to pour out his blood with his lines. There is a rush
of passion in his verse which sweeps everything along with it.” —-W'hz'pple.
“His poetry bursts from his soul with the ﬁre and energy of an ancient prophet.”--=
Chanm'ng. —
“A vein of genuine tenderness runs through his nature.” —Hz'llard.

PROEM.

I love the old melodious lays
Which softly melt the ages through,
The songs of Spenser’s golden days,
Arcadian Sidney’s silvery phrase,
Sprinkling our noon of time wi_th freshest morning dew.

Yet, vainly in my quiet hours
To breathe their marvellous notes I try;
I feel them, as the leaves and ﬂowers
In silence feel the dewy showers,
And drink with glad still lips the blessings of the sky.

The rigor of a frozen clime,
The harshness of "an untaught ear,
The jarring words of one whose rhyme
Beat often Labor’s hurried time,
Or Duty’s rugged march through storm and strife, are here.

Of mystic beauty, dreamy grace,
No rounded art the lack supplies;
Unskilled the subtle lines to trace,
Or softer shades of Nature’s face,
I view her common forms with unanointed eyes.

Nor mine the seer-like power to show
The secrets of the heart and mind;
To drop the plummet-line below
Our common world of joy and woe,
A more intense despair or brighter hope to ﬁnd.

Yet here at least an earnest sense
' Of human right and weal is shown;
A hate of tyranny intense,
And hearty in its vehemence,
As if my brother’s pain and sorrow were my own.

0 Freedom! if to me belong
Nor mighty Milton’s gift divine,
Nor M.arvell’s wit and graceful song,
Still, with a love as deep and strong
As theirs, I lay, like "them, my best gift on thy shrine.

IN SCHOOL DAYS.

Still sits the school-house by the road,
A ragged beggar sunning;

Around it still the surnachs grow,
And blackberry vines are running.

Within, the master’s desk is seen,
Deep scarred by raps official;

The Warping floor, the battered seats,
The jack-knife’s carved initial-

The charcoal frescoes on its walls,
Its door’s worn sill, betraying

The feet that, creeping slow to school,
Went Storming out to playing!

Long years ago a winter’s sun
Shone over it at setting;

Lit up its western window-panes,
And low eaves’ icy fretting.

It touched the tangled golden curls,
And brown eyes full of grieving,

Of one Who still her steps delayed
VVhen all the school were leaving.

For near her stood the little boy
Her childish favor singled,
His cap pulled low upon a face
Where pride and shame‘ were mingled.

Pushing with-restless feet the snow
To right and left he lingered,

As restlessly her tiny hands
The blue-checked apron ﬁngered.

He saw her lift her eyes; he felt
The soft hand‘s light caressing,

And heard the trembling of her voice,
As if a fault confessing.

“Pm sorry that I spelt the word;
I hate to go above you,

Because ”—the brown eyes lower fell-==
“ Because, you see, I love you! ”

Still memory to a gray-haired man
That sweet child-face is showing;

Dear girl! the grasses on her grave
Ilave forty years been growing!

He lives to learn, in life’s hard school,
How few who pass above him

Lament their triumph and his loss
Like her-—-because they love him.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 333

Bryant.

WILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT, 1794 , by the publication of Thanatop-
sis, acquired, almost sixty years ago, a national reputation as a poet, and he
has continued at brief intervals ever since to add to his laurels by some new
effort, showing that his ﬁre is not yet extinct, nor his vigor abated. His
poems are not so numerous or so varied as those iof VVhittier or Longfellow,
yet he is as clearly among the great poets that every American involun-
tarily claims as a part of the national inheritance.

Mr. Bryant is a native of Massachusetts. He published two poems, The Embargo, a po-
litical satire, and The Spanish Revolution, in 1808, he being then only fourteen years old.
He has been before the public, therefore, more than sixty years. Thanatopsis, the most
perfect of all his poems, and the one best known, first appeared in 1817. It was written
when he was but eighteen years old. His largest poem, The Ages, a survey of the experience
of mankind, appeared in 1821.

Mr. Bryant is by profession a lawyer, but he early abandoned the profession for that of
journalism, and since 1826 he has been editor of the New York Evening Post.

He visited Europe in 1834, in 1845, and in 1849, the last time extending his journey to
Egypt and Syria. His communications to the Post during these journeys were republished
in a volume, called Letters of a Traveller. In 1857-58, he again visited Europe, producing
Letters from Spain and other countries. He has resided, since 1845, at Roslyn, L. I.

Mr. Bryant’s poems have appeared from time to time as occasional contributions to the maga-
zines, and have had a singular uniformity of excellence. They all show care and finish, and
original observation. N 0 English poet, living or dead, has been a more accurate observer of
nature, as any one may prove who will take a volume of his poe.ms out into the woods and
ﬁelds, and read the descriptions in the very presence of what is described. “ Bryant’s writings
transport us into the depths of the solemn primeval forest, to the shores of the lonely lake,
the banks of the wild nameless stream, or the brow of the rocky upland, rising like a promon-

tory from amidst a wide ocean of foliage ; while they shed around us the glories of a climate

ﬁerce in the extremes, but splendid in all its vicissitudes.” — Washington Irving.

“One effect of Bryant’s faithful observation, of which we have spoken, is, that his poems
are strictly American. They are American in their subjects, imagery, and spirit. Scarcely
any other than one born in this country can appreciate all their merit, so strongly marked
are they by the peculiarities of our national scenery, our social feelings, and our national
connections. What the author has seen, or what has been wrought in his own mind, he has
written, and no more. His skies are not brought from Italy, nor his singing-birds from the
tropics, 11or his forests from Germany or regions beyond the pole. He is not indebted to the
patient study of books so muchas to the calm communion with outward things. lIe has
levied no contributions on the masters of foreign literature, nor depended upon the locked
up treasures of ancient genius for the materials of thought and expressions. He has written
from the movings of his own mind; he has uttered what he has felt and known; he has de-
scribed things around him in ﬁtting terms, terms suggested by familiar contemplation, and
thus his writings have become transcripts of external nature, appreciated by his country-
men ‘with the readiness and ease with which truth is ever recognized.” —Parke Godwin.

WAITING BY THE GATE.

Beside a massive gateway built up in years gone by,

Upon whose top the clouds in eternal shadows lie,

While streams the evening sunshine on quiet wood and lea,
I stand and calmly wait till the hinges turn for me.

334

AMERICAN LITERATURE.

The tree-tops faintly rustle beneath the breeze"s ﬂight,

A soft and soothing sound, yet it whispers of the night;

I hear the woodthrush piping one mellow descant more,

And scent the ﬂowers that blow when the heat of day is o’er.

Behold the portals open, and o’er the threshold, now,
There steps a weary one witha pale and furrowed brow;
His count of years is full, his allotted task is wrought;
He passes to his rest from a place that needs him not.

In sadness then I ponder how quickly ﬂeets the hour

Of human strength and action, man’s courage and his power.
I muse while still the woodthrush sings down the golden day,
And as I look and listen the sadness wears away.

Again the hinge_s turn, and a youth, departing, throws
A look of longing backward, and sorrowfully goes;

A blooming maid, unbincling the ‘roses from her hair,
Moves mournfully away from amidst the young and fair.

Oh glory of our race that so suddenly decays!

Oh crimson ﬂush of morning that darkens as we gaze!

Oh breath of summer blossoms that on the restless air
Scatters a moment’s sweetness and ﬂies we know not where!

I grieve for life’s bright promise, just shown and then withdrawn;
But stillthe sun shines «round me: the evening birds sing on,
And I again am soothed, and, beside the ancient gate,

In this soft evening sunlight, I calmly stand and wait.

Once more the gates are opened; an infant group go out,

The sweet, smile quenched forever, and stilled the sprightly shout.
Oh frail, frailtree of Life, that upon the greensward strows

Its fair young buds unopened, with every wind that blows!

So come from every region, so enter, side by side,

The strong and faint of spirit, the meek and men of pride.
Steps of earth’s great and mighty, between those pillars gray,
And prints of little feet, mark the dust along the way.

And some approach the threshold ‘whose looks are blank with fear,
And some whose temples brighten with joy in‘drawing near,

As if they saw dear faces, and caught the gracious eye

Of Him, the Sinless Teacher, who came for us to die.

I mark the joy, the terror; yet these, within my_ heart,
Can neither wake the dread nor the longing" to depart;
And, in the sunshine streaming on quiet wood and lea,
I stand and calmly wait till the hinges turn for me.

THE PLANTING OF THE APPLE-TREE.

Come, let us plant the apple-tree,
Cleave the tough grecnsward with the spade;
Wide let its hollow bed be made; A
There gently lay the roots, and there
Sift the dark mould with kindly care,
And press it o’er them tciiclei-ly,

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENTTIME. 335

As, round the sleeping infant’s feet
We softly fold the cradle sheet;
S0 ‘plant we the apple-tree.

What plant we in this apple-tree?
Buds, which the breath of summer days
Shall lengthen into leafy sprays;
Boughs where the thrush, with crimson breast,
Shall haunt and sing and hide her nest;
We plant, upon the sunny lea,
A shadow for the noontide hour,
A shelter from the summer shower,
When we plant the apple-tree.

. What plant we in this apple—tree?
Sweets for a hundred ﬂowery springs,
To load the May—wind’s restless wings,
When, from the orchard row, he pours
Its fragrance through-its open doors;
A world of blossoms for the bee,
Flowers for the sick girl’s silent room,
For the glad infant sprigs of bloom,
We plant with the apple-tree.

What plant we in this apple-tree?
Fruits that shall swell in sunny June,
And redden in the August noon,

And drop, when gentle airs come by,
That fan the blue September sky,

While children" come, with cries of glee,
And seek them where the fragrant grass
Bet-rays their bed to those who pass,

At the foot of the apple-tree.

And When, above this apple-tree,
The winter stars are quivering bright,
And winds go howling through the night,
Girls, whose young eyes o’erﬂow with mirth_,
Shall peel its fruit by cottage hearth,

And guests in prouder homes shall see,
Heaped with the grape of Cintra’s Vine,
And golden orange of the line,

The fruit of the app1e—tree.

The fruitage of this apple-tree
Winds, and our flag of stripe and star.
Shall bear to coasts that lie afar,
Where men shall wonder at the view,
And ask in what fair groves they grew;
And sojourners beyond the sea
Shall think of childhood’s careless day,
And long, long hours of summer play,
In the shade of the apple-tree.

336 AMERICAN LITERATURE,

Each year shall give this apple-tree
A broader ﬂush of roseate bloom,
A deeper maze of verdurous gloom,

And loosen, when the frost—clouds lower,
The crisp brown leaves in thicker sliower.
The years shall come and pass, but We

Shall hear no longer, where we lie,
The summer’s songs, the autumn’s sigh,
In the boughs of the apple-tree.

And time shall waste this apple-tree—-
Oh! when its aged branches throw
Thin shadows on the ground below,
Shall fraud and force and iron will
Oppress the weak and helpless still?
What shall the tasks of mercy be,
Amid the toils, the strifes, the tears
Of those who liv_e when length of years
Is wasting this apple-tree?

“Who planted this old apple-tree? ”

The children of that distant day

Thus to some aged man shall say;

And gazing on its mossy stem,

The gray-haired man shall answer them:
“A poet of the land was he,

Born in the rude but good old times;

’Tis said he made some quaint old rhymes
On planting the apple-tree.”

Boker.

GEORGE HENRY BOKEE, 1824 ——, has succeeded better than any other
American author in the diflieult line of dramatic composition. His prin-
cipal plays, Calaynos, Anne Boleyn, Leonor de Guzman, and Francesca da
Rimini, tragedies, are all conceived on the highest type of the regular
drama, and are truly classical performances. In addition to his dramatic
compositions, he has wr' ten‘ several other long poems, besides numerous
short lyrics of great excellence.

Mr. Boker is a native and a resident of Philadelphia, son of a wealthy banker of that city.
He graduated at Princeton, in the class of 1842, and studied law, but has never practised.
His ﬁrst appearance as an author was in 1847, when he published The Lesson of Life and
Other Poems. This ﬁrst publication, crude and imperfect as in many respects it was, con-
tained at the same time distinct indications of latent power, though not of that high and
varied power which the author has since exhibited. Mr. Boker has not been a proliﬁc
writer, yet something considerable from his pen every few years shows that he has not been
idle; and every new addition to his list of works has been such as to increase the admira-
tion of the public for his poetic genius. Carefully avoiding whatever is of a sensational
character, and resolutely refusing to cater to a false taste, even at the risk of some loss of
temporary notoriety, he has wrought slowly and laboriously, after the highest ideals of ex-
cellence, calmly awaiting the ﬁnal verdict of assured success. The tenrlencyof his mind,
as already remarked, is towards the dramatic form of composition, and his ﬁrst signal suc-
cess, the tragcdy of Cal-aynos, was in that line. As a lyric poet, however, and especially as

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME.» 83-’?

a. Writer of Sonnets, his merits are of a high order. The following is a list of his principal
publications: Calaynos, a Tragedy ; Anne Boleyn, a Tragedy ; Leonor de Guzman, a Tragedy;
The Betrothal; The Podesta’s Daughter; The Ivory Carver; A Ballad of Sir John Franklin;
Song of the Earth ; Street Lyrics ; and a large number of Sonnets, Songs, and minor poems.

Besides his poetical works, Mr. Boker has written a goodly amount of vigorous and stir-
ring prose. Most of this has been in the form of Reports of the Union League, of which
from its origin he was annually elected Secretary. No abler political manifestoes have ap-
peared in all the stirring times, from 1861 to 1871, than those documents put forth during
and after the war by George H. Boker, Secretary of the_Union League.

Mr. Boker received in 1871 the appointment of United States Minister to Constantinople,
and in 1875 was transferred to the corresponding position at St. Petersburg.

TO LOUIS NAPOLEON.—A SONNET.

O, shameless thief! a nation trusted thee
With all the wealth her bleeding hands had won,
Proclaimed thee guardian of her liberty:
So proud a title never lay upon
Thy uncle’s forehead: thou wast linked With one,
First President of France, whose name shall be
Fixed in the heavens, like God’s eternal sun-—
Second to him alone—-to Washington!
Was it for thee to stoop unto a crown?
Pick up the B'ourbon’s leavings? yield thy height
Of simple majesty, and totter down,
Full of discovered frailties—sorry sight! —
One of a mob of kings? or, baser grown,
Was it for thee to steal it in the night?

THE GROOEB.’S DAUGHTER.

Stop, stop! and look through the dusty pane.-
She’s gone! —-Nay, hist! again I have caught her:

There is "the source of my sighs of pain,
There is my idol, the Grocer’s Daughter! ’

“A child! no woman! ” S A bud, no ﬂower:

But think, when a year or more has brought her
Its ripening roundness, how proud a dower

Of charms will bloom in the Grrocer’s Daughter!

I have a love for the ﬂower that blows,

One for the bud that needs sun and Water;
The first because it is now a rose,

The other will be, -- like the Grocer’s Daughter.

She stood in the door, as I passed to-day,
And mine and a thousand glances sought her,-
Like a star from heaven with equal ray,
On all alike, shone the Grocer’s Daughter.

Mark how the sweetest on earth can smile,

As you patient drudge, yon coarse-browed porter,
Eases his burdened back, the while

Keeping his eyes on the Grocer’s Daughter.

I I’M SICK OF LIFE, I’M WEARY.

I sit beneath the sunbeam’s glow,
Their golden currents round me ﬂow,
Their mellow kisses warm my brow,
But all the world; is dreary.

The vernal meadow round me blooms,
And ﬂings to me its faint perfumes;
Its breath is like an opening tomb’s—-
I’m sick of life, I’m weary!

The mountain brook skips down to me,
Tossing its silver tresses free,
Humming like one in revery;

But, ah! the sound is dreary—-
The trilling blue-birds o’er me sail,
There ’s music in the faint-voiced gale;
‘A11 sound to me a mourner’s wail-

’ I’m sick of life, I’m weary.

The night leads forth the starry train,
The glittering moonbeams fall like rain,
There’s not a shadow on the plain;

Yet all the scene is dreary.
The sunshine is a mockery,
The solemn moon stares moodily;
Alike is day or night to me—-

I’m sick of life, I’m weary.

I know to some the world is fair,

For them there ’s music in the air,

And shapes of beauty everywhere;
But all to me is dreary.

I know in me the sorrows lie

That blunt my ear, and dim my eye;

I cannot weep, I fain would die——-
I’m sick of life, I’m weary.

Not when the buxom form which Nature wears
Is pregnant with the lusty warmth of Spring;
Nor when hot Summer, sunk with what she bears,

Lies panting in her ﬂowery oﬁ”ering;

To hear her treasures to the griping snares
Hard Winter‘ set for the poor bankrupt thing;
Not even when Winter. heir of all the yqyar, '
Deals, like a miser, round his niggard board,
The brimming plenty of his luscious hoard:

Buchanan Read.

THOMAS BUCHANAN READ, 1822-1872, is almost equally celebrated as
an artist and a poet, and is familiarly known as the Poet-Painter. He pub-

. ‘lished several long poems, as The New Pastoral, and The House by the

Sea, but the short lyrics contained in his Lays and Ballads are those on
which chieﬂy his reputation rests. _

Mr. Read was born in Chester County, Pa. At the age of fourteen he went to Cincinnati,
and became a pupil of the sculptor, Clevenger. On the departure of Clevenger to Europe,
Read turned his attention to painting, and acquired considerable reputation. In 1840, he
went to Boston, where he spent ﬁve years, dividing his time between painting and poetry,
and gaining favor in both departments of effort. The next four years were spent in like
manner in Philadelphia. In 1850 he visited Italy and passed a year at Florence. He went
to Italy again in 1853, and remained there several years, havinggorders from America for
pictures enough to ﬁll up his time. After returning from Italy, he resided partly in Phila-
delphia, and partly in Cincinnati. The last few years of his life were spent in Rome, follow-
ing his profession as .a painter. On his return home, in May, 1872, he was attacked with
pleuro-pneumonia, and died in New York, after an illness of two weeks.

Mr. Read’s literary works have almost kept pace with his works as an artist. His chief
publications have been the following: The Female Poets of America, a large pictorial vol-
ume, in which the portraits were painted and the biographical and critical notices and selec-
tions were all made by himself; Lays and Ballads ; The Pilgrims of the Great St. Bernard, a
Prose Romance; The New Pastoral; The House by the Sea; The Wagoner of the Alleghanies;
A Voyage to Ireland, etc.

Mr. Read’s shorter pieces have been collected and published in various forms, both in Eng-
land and the United States, and have received the warmest commendations. They consti-
tute indeed his highest claims to fame. His lyrics are his greatest works. Sheridan’s Ride
is one of the few things written during the heat of the war that is likely to survive. Others
of his short pieces, though not so widely known as this, are hardly inferior to it in merit.

No writer of the present age, except Tennyson, has so delicate a fancy, or such wonderful
nicety in the use of words. This exquisite delicacy in the use of words is the more remark-
able in Mr. Read’s case from the fact that his advantages of early education were very
limited. It seems to grow out of the native poetical faculty of the man, which instinctively
selects with inﬁnitesimal precision exactly the right words to express its own airy fancies.

“At his house in Florence and Rome, he was the centre of a large social circle, dispensing
an elegant hospitality on the most generous scale, and unwearied in his attentions to Ameri-
cans who made a temporary sojourn in those capitals. His studio in Rome, especially, dur-
ing the last few years, was the resort of numerous American and English visitors, together
with many distinguished personages from various European countries, who learned to prize
his portraits and other productions of his pencil for the delicate reﬁnement of their execu-
tion and the soft ideal charm which he threw around his favorite subjects. His chief pleas-
ure was in the delineation of scenes of aerial lightness and grace, though diversiﬁed at
times by such pieces as his vigorous portrait of Sheridan and his Horse, which has at-
tained almost equal celebrity with his singularly popular poem on Sheridan’s Ride. His
most successful paintings are, perhaps, Undine, The Lost Pleiad, The Star of Bethlehem,
Water Sprite, Longfe1low’s Children.” —New York Tribune.

THE DESERTED ROAD.

Ancient road, that wind’st deserted
Through the level of the vale,

Sweeping toward the crowded market
Like a stream without a sail;

Standing by thee, I look backward,
And, as in the light of dreams,

See the years descend andvanish
Likethy whitely-tented teams.

Here I stroll along the village,
As in youth’s departed morn; I

But I miss the crowded coaches,
And the driver’s«bugle-horn-

Miss the crowd of jovial teamsters
Filling buckets at the wells,

With their wains from Conestoga,
And their_ orchestras of bells.

To the merry wayside tavern
Comes the noisy throng no more;

And the faded sign, complaining,
Swings unnoticed at the door.

While the old decrepit tollman,
Waiting for the few who pass,
Reads the melancholy story
In the thickly springing grass.

Ancient highway, thou art vanquish’d;
The usurper of the vale

Rolls in ﬁery, iron rattle,
Exultations on the gale.

Thou art vanquish’d and neglected;

But the good which thou hast done,
Though by man it be forgotten,
’ Shall be deathless _as the sun.

Though neglected, gray, and grassy,
Still I pray that my decline

May be through as vernal valleys
And as blest a calm as thine.

1839. He studied law and practised for a time, but afterwards abandoned the proiession for
that of literature. He is widely known also as a lecturer. Until his fame was somewhat
overshadowed by Artemus Ward, he might have been called the most popular humorous
writer of America. Prominent among his poems are Progress, The Proud Miss McBride,
The Money King, Rhyme of the Rail, The Flying Dutchman, The Masquerade, etc.

Mr. Saxe excels in light, easy verse, and in unexpected, if not absolutely punning, turns of
expression. His more elaborate productions are not so successful. In the general style and
effect of certain of his comic pieces he strongly reminds one of Thomas Hood. Saxe, it must
be observed, is. one of the very few thoroughly national poets, in this sense, that his themes
and the atmosphere of his verse are almost exclusively American. This,however,is perhaps
a general rule applicable to all humorous and satirical poets, who must be local and national
to be acceptable.

THOMAS W. PARSONS, M.D., 1819 —, is a native and resident of Boston. He is an accom-
plished and scholarly man, who has enriched his mind by foreign travel, and ha.s given proofs
of his culture and of his poetic abilities by his translations from Dante and by original poems
of great merit. He has published The Inferno of Dante, a new metrical version of extraor-
dinary excellence; and two volumes of miscellaneous Poems. “ His verses are clear alike
to the ear and the brain, and their old—fashioned music is in keeping with their vigorous
sense, ﬁne humor, sharp but not unequal wit, and delicate though always manly senti-
ment.”-—-Go'isw0ld. “The book displays more culture than enthusiasm, —— more of the poetic
art than of poetic ﬁre. Its author shows a rare wealth of resource derived equally from
study and from travel, —from classic fountains and from the literature and life of the pres-
ent day.” —A. P. Peabody, D. D., in the North American Review.

Dr. I-Iollavnol.

 

JOSIAH GILBERT HOLLAND, M. D., 1819 , after becoming widely
and favorably known as a prose Writer, under the name of Timothy Tit-
comb, rose suddenly to fame as a poet, by the publication of two poems,
Bitter Sweet, and Kathrina. Both these poems, especially the latter, were
received with an immediate and general favor almost unprecedented.

Dr. Holland is a native of Belchertown, Mass. He practised medicine for a time, and was
for one year superintendent of schools in Vicksburg. Miss. From 1849 to 1866, he was asso-
ciate editor of the Springﬁeld Republican, Mass. In 1870, he became editor of Scribner’s
Monthly, which position he still holds.

Dr. Ho1land’s publications are the following: History of Western Massachusetts, 2 vols.,
1855; The Bay Path, a tale of New England Colonial Life, 1857; Letters to Young People,
Single and Married, by Timothy Titcomb, 1858; Bitter Sweet, a poem, 1858; Gold Foil,
Hammered from Popular Proverbs, 1859; Miss Gilbert’s Career, an American Story, 1860;
Lessons in Life, 1861 ; Letters to the Joneses,1863; Plain Talks on Familiar Subjects, 1865;
The Life of Abraham Lincoln, 1866; Kathrina, Her Life and Mine, a poem, 1867.

As a prose writer, Dr. Holland is admitted by all to be one of our best. As a poet, he has
received much adverse, and some unkind criticism. His Kathrina doubtless is open to criti-
cism. Yet it is idle to deny to this poem great and distinguishing merit. The author, at
all events, may console himself with the fact, that While the critics ﬂout, the people read
and buy. N 0 American poem, with the single exception of Longfellow’s Hiawatha, has had
such tangible evidences of popularity. The sale of Kathrina in the ﬁrst six months was
40,000 copies, and it has since gone beyond 60,000. Many of Dr. Holland’s other Works have
enjoyed a like popularity.

THOMAS BAILEY ALDRICH, 1836 ——-, is a native of Portsmouth, N. H. He has contributed,
in prose and verse, to the Atlantic, Harper’s, Knickerbocker, and other periodicals, weekly
and monthly, and is at present one of the editors of the Home Journal. He has published
Poems; Pampinea and Other Poems; Ballad of Babie Bell and Other Poems; Out of his
Head, a Romance ; Daisy’s Necklace; The Course of True Love Never Did Run’ Smooth; and
The Story of a Bad Boy.

The Ballad of Babie Bell gave the author immediate and general favor. It shows a deli-
cate fancy, as well as a ﬁne command of language, and makes its appeal to the domestic
affections in a way that is sure to awaken a kind response. He is at present, 1872, editor
of Every Saturday.

AMERICAN LITERATURE.

BABIE BELL.
I.

Have you not heard the poets tell

How came the dainty Babie Bell
Into this world of ours?

The gates of heaven were left ajar:
With folded hands and dreamy eyes,
1/Vandering out of Paradise,

She saw this planet, like a star,

Hung in the purple depths of even——

Its bridges, running to and fro,

O’er which the white-winged angels go,
Bearing the holy dead to heaven !

She touched a bridge of ﬂowers—-those feet,

So light they did not bend the bells

Of the celestial asphodelsl‘

They fell like dew upon the ﬂowers,
And all the air grew strangely sweet!

And thus came dainty Babie Bell

' Into this world of ours.

II.

She came and brought delicious May.
The swallows built beneath the eaves;
Like sunlight in and out the leaves,

The robins went, the livelong day;

The lily swung its noiseless bell,
And o’er the porch the trembling vin-e
Seemed bursting with its veins of wine!

How sweetly, softly, twilight fell!

0, earth was full of singing birds,
And happy spring-tide ﬂowers,

When the dainty Babie Bell
Came to this world of ours!

III.

0 Babie, dainty Babie Bell,
How fair she grew from day to day!

What woman nature ﬁlled her eyes,
What poetry within them lay!

Those deep and tender twilight eyes,
So full of meaning, pure and bright,
As if she yet stood in the light

Of those oped gates of Paradise!

And we loved Babie more and more:

Ah! never in our hearts before
Was love so lovely born:

We felt .we had a link between

This real world and that unseen-
The land beyond the mom!

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 345

And for the love of those dear eyes,
For love of her whom’ God led forth,
(The mother’s being ceased on earth

When Babie came from Paradise) —-

For love of Him who smote our lives,
And woke the chords of joy and pain,

We said, Sweet Christ!-——-our hearts bent down
Like violets after rain.

IV.

And now the orchards, which in June
Were white and rosy in their bloom-

Filling the crystal veins of air
With gentle pulses of perfume-—

Were rich in Autumn’s mellow prime:

The plums were globes of honeyed wine,

The hived sweets of summer time!

The ivory chestnut burst its shell:

The soft-cheeked peaches blushedland fell!

The grapes were purpling in the grange,

And time brought just as rich a change
In little Babie Bell.

Her tiny form more perfect grew,

And in her features we could trace,
In softened curves, her mother’s face!

Her angel-nature ripened too.

We thought her lovely when she came,
But she was holy, saintly now. . . .
Around her pale angelic brow

We saw a slender ring of ﬂame!

V.

God’s hand had taken away the seal
Which held the portals of her speech;

And oft she said a few strange words-
Whose meaning lay beyond our reach;

She never was a. child to us,
We never held her ba;ing’s key:

We could not teach her holy things:
She was Christ’s self in purity!

VI.

It came upon us by degrees:
We saw its shadow ere it fell,

The knowledge that our God had sent
His messenger for Babie Bell.

We shuddered with unlanguaged pain,
And all our hopes were changed to fears,
And all our thoughts ran into tears,

Like sunshine into rain.

We cried aloud in our belief,

“O, smite us gently, gently, God!
Teach us to bend and kiss the rod,
And perfect grow through grief.”

346 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Ah, how we loved her, God can tell;
Her little heart was cased in ours:
Our hearts a.re broken, Babie Bell!

VII.

At last he came, the messenger,
The messenger from unseen lands:
And what did dainty, Babie Bell?
She only crossed her little hands,
She only looked more meek and fair!
We parted back her silken hair;
We laid some buds upon her brow,
White buds, the summer’s drifted snow-
Death’s bride arrayed in ﬂowers!
And thus went dainty Babie Bell
Out of this world of ours!

James T. Fields.

JAMES T. FIELDS, 1820 , the well-known Boston bookseller, is the
author of two volumes of poems and of a series of charming prose sketches,
called Yesterdays with, Authors.

 

Mr. Fields is a native of Portsmouth, N. H. He came to Boston in 1833, and engaged as
clerk in the bookselling house of Carter & Hendee, corner of Washington and School Streets.
There, and in the quarters recently occupied in Tremont Street, he followed the vocation
of bookselling and publishing until his retirement frombusiness in 1870, the ﬁrm changing
successively to Allen & Ticknor; Ticknor, Reed & Fields; Ticknor & Fields; Fields, Osgood
& Co., and lastly, J. R. Osgood & Co. The history of this house, and of Mr. Fields, for nearly
forty years its presiding genius, is a history of much of the most brilliant literature of the
country during that period. The literary record of Everett, Prescott, Whittier, Bryant,
Hawthorne, Longfellow, Holmes, Emerson, Dana, Halleck, Lowell, Whipple, Hillard, Sum-
ner, Parsons, Sprague, Mrs. Stowe, Bayard Taylor, and a long list of others, is connected
with the operations of this house. Mr. Fields has had more to do also, probably, than any
other American belonging to the craft, with the most distinguished English authors, such as
Wordsworth, De Quincey, Thackeray, Dickens, Reade, the Brownings, and others. Since
retiring from the business, he has written a series of delightful reminiscences of some of
these distinguished writers, under the title of Yesterdays with Authors.

Mr. Fields published a volume of Poems in 1849, and another in 1855, called A Few Verses
for a Few Friends. Among his poems are Commerce, read before the Boston Mercantile
Association in 1838, and another called The Post of Honor, before the same body in 1818.

REV. CHARLES T. BROOKS, 1813 —, minister of the Unitarian church at Newport, R. I.,
was born at Salem, Mass., graduated at Harvard, in 1832; and settled in Newport in 1837.
He is an accomplished German scholar, and has gained a high reputation by his poetical
versions of some of the best German classics, Goethe, Schiller, Jean Paul Richter, etc. His
chief publications are Sehiller’s William Tell, Mary Stuart, and Maid of Orleans; Ricl1ter’s
Titan, and Hesperus; Goetl1e’s Faust; Leopold Schefer’s Layman’s Breviary; Puck’s Mighty
Pranks; Specimens of German Song; German Lyrics, etc. Also, he has published, of his
own poems, Songs of Field and Flood; Eight Months on the Ocean and Eight Weeks in
India; The Old Stone Mill in Newport; and the Simplicity of Christ, a volume of Sermons.

VVILLIAM ALLENABUTLER, 1825 —-—, a lawyer in the city of New York, has occasionally

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 347

turned aside from his professional occupations, for the purpose of satirizing some of the
follies of the day. His poem, Nothing to Wear, which was a sharp“ but good-natured satire
upon women’s dress, was received with great applause. Some of his other pieces, in a similar
vein, are Two Millions, and’Genera1 Average, the last being aimed at some of the sharp
practices in mercantile life. '

WILLIAM H. BURLEIGH, 1812-1871, a native of Woodstock, Conn., and a magazine writer,
published a volume of Poems, and contributed a good deal to periodical literature.

AUGUSTINE J. H. DUGANNE, 1823 ————, is a native of Boston. He has contributed largely
to periodical literature, both in prose and verse, though chieﬂy known as a poet. Ilis sepa-
rate publications are: Comprehensive Summary of General Philosophy; Class Book of Gov-
ernments and Civil Society; Revised Leaves, a series of critiques on contemporary writers,
published originally i11 Sartain’s Magazine; Parnassus in Pillory, a satire; The Gospel of
Labor, a poem; The Mission of Intellect, a poem; The Iron Harp; The True Republic; The
Lydian Queen, a Tragedy, played at the Walnut Street Theatre, Philadelphia; Home Poems.
“Mr. Duganne’s lyrical powers are characterized by a nervous energy, a generous sympathy
with humanity, a wonderful command of language, and an ardent hatred of usury and op-
pression in all their forms.”—7V. II. Bm'le2'gh.

THOMAS DUNN ENGLISH, M.D., 1819 , has contributed largely to magazine literature,
and published, in 1855, a volume of poems. One of these, Ben Bolt, has had an extensive
popularity. He has also published a novel, called Walter Wolfe.

CHARLES GAYLER, 1820 , dramatist, is a native of’New York. He began writing for the
stage while in Cincinnati, editing a newspaper. He returned to New York in 1850, and has
been connected with the periodical press of that city. He: has written a large number of
dramatic pieces. Among those which have been published are The Gold Hunters, a Drama;
The Frightened Friend, an Operetta; Taking the Chances, a Comedy; The Love of a Prince,
a Comedy; The Son of the Night, a Drama; Isms, a Comedy‘, Galieno Faliero, a Tragedy.

THOMAS PowELL, 1809 , is a native of London. He emigrated to the United States in:
1849, and since that time has resided chieﬂy in New York, engaged in literary pursuits,
chieﬂy as a writer for the stage. The following are the titles of some of his dramatic pieces:
The Wife’s Revenge, Marguerita, True at Last, Love’s Rescue, The Shepl1erd’s \Vell, The
Blind “life. He has Written also, The Living. Authors of England, The Living Authors of
America, Tales from Bocoaccio, Florentine Tales, Chit Chat, The Ambassador’s Daughter (a
romance), and several volumes of Poems. Mr. Powell has been an industrious contributor
to a large number of papers and magazines, both in England and in the United States.

Alfred B. Street.

ALFRED BILLINGs STREET, 1811 ———, is one of the best descriptive
poets of which American literature has to boast. His, descriptions of forest
life, especially, are Wonderfully graphic and true to- nature. His longest
Work, Frontenac, is a narrative poem, being a tale of the Iroquois. The
poem which is best known, and which on the Whole is the most effective, is
the Gray Forest-Eagle, a part of which is quoted: below.

Mr. Street was born at Poughkeepsie, N. Y. He studied law and practised for a few years.

Since 1839 he has resided at Albany, where he has been for some years State Librarian. The
following are his principal publications: The Burning of Schenectady and Other Poems,

348 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

1842; Drawings and Tintings, 1844; Fugitive Poems, 1846; Frontenac, a metrical romance,
1849; Woods and Waters, or the Saranacs and Rucket, 1860; Forest Pictures in the Adiron-
dacs, 1864; Poems, 1866. He has also_ written some historical and statistical works.

“ In a. foreign land, his poems would transport us at once to home. He is no second-hand

vlimner, content to furnish insipid copies, but draws from reality. His pictures have the

freshness of originals. They are graphic, detailed, never untrue and often vigorous. He is
essentially an American poet. In England we notice that these qualities have been recog-
nized. His Lost Hunter has been ﬁnely illustrated there, thus aifording the best evidence
of the picturesque fertility of his muse. His Gray Forest-Eagle is a noble lyric, full of
spirit; his Forest Scenes are minutely and at the same time elaborately true.”——H. T.
Tuckerman.

THE GRAY FOREST-EAG LE.

With storm-daring pinion and sun-gazing eye,

The gray forest-eagle is king of the sky!

0, little he loves the green valley of ﬂowers,

Where sunshine and song cheer the bright summer hours,
For he hears in those haunts only music, and sees

Only rippling of waters and waving of trees;

There the red-robin warbles, the honey-bee hums,

The timid quail whistles, the sly partridge drums;

And if those proud pinions, perchance, sweep along,
There ’s a shrouding of plumage, a hushing of song;

The sunlight falls stilly on leaf and on moss,

And there ’s naught but his shadow black gliding across;
But the dark gloomy gorge, Where down plunges the foam,
Of the ﬁerce, rock-lashed torrent, he claims as his home:
There he blends his keen shriek with the roar of the ﬂood,
And the many-voiced sounds of the blast-smitten wood;
From the crag-grasping ﬁr-top where morn hangs its wreath,
He views the mad waters while writhing beneath:

On a limb of that moss-beared hemlock far down,

With bright azure mantle and gray mottled crown,

The kingﬁsher watches, where o’er him his foe,

The ﬁerce hawk, sails circling, each moment more low;
Now poised are those pinions and pointed that beak,

His dread swoop is ready, when, hark! with a shriek,

His eye-balls red-blazing, high bristled his crest,

His snake-like neck arch’d, talons drawn to his breast,
With the rush of the wind-gust, the glancing of light,
The gray forest—eagle shoots down in his ﬂight;

One blow of those talons, one plunge of that neck,

The strong hawk hangs lifeless, a blood-dripping wreck;
And as dives the free kingﬁsher, dart-like on high

With his prey soars theeagle, and melts in the sky.

REV. SIDNEY DYER, 1814 ———, a Baptist preacher and writer of high standing, was born at
White Creek, Washington County, N. Y., but while yet a child went with his father to the
“Black River Country,” New York, and settled near Brownsville, where he enjoyed such
advantages of education as were afforded by the rude log school-house of pioneer life. This
part of his life experience found expression afterwards in two of his ballads, Clumsy Joe,
and The Double Conquest. At the age of thirteen, even these advantages were brought ab-

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 349

ruptly to an end. Thrown at that early age upon his own exertions, he was employed in va-
rious ways until the Black Hawk War of 1831, when he joined the army and was sent into
Illinois to ﬁght the Indians. While thus employed, the desires for a higher life awoke
within him. The time there given by his companions to idleness and dissipation was spent
by him in the reading and study of such works as the post afforded. He was aided in his
efforts at improvement by the advice and good oﬂices of the captain’s wife. This period of his
life is embodied in his ballad of The Drummer Boy. He remained in the army about ten
years, and rose to a position both pleasant and lucrative. But the desire to preach the gospel
became so strong and earnest that he no longer dared resist, and he entered at the age of
twenty-two upon a course of preparation for the ministry. Not able to take a college course,
he studied what Greek and Latin he could, and made good proﬁciency in the natural
sciences and in general literature, under the direction of Rev. Charles G. Sommers, D.D.,
pastor of the South Baptist Church in New York. Mr. Dyer was ordained in 1842, and
preached ﬁrst in a church near his former residence in Brownsville, and afterwards as a mis-
sionary among the Choctaws. After that he was for some years Secretary of the Indian
Mission Board at Louisville, Ky. In 1852 he became pastor of the Baptist church in Indian-
apolis, and in 1859 he came to Philadelphia as District Secretary of the American Baptist
Publication Society, which position he still holds. Mr. Dyer’s contributions to letters have
been the fruits, not of learned leisure, but of self—denying love to literature for its own sake.
His ﬁrst eiforts were a few rhymes published in a village newspaper, of whose imperfec-
tions he afterwards became so fully aware that he forbore to write any more verses until
ﬁfteen years’ hard study had matured his powers. He then began to contribute to Sartain’s
Magazine, the Southern Literary Magaiine, and the Louisville Journal. These pieces were
afterwards published in a volume, Voices of Nature. Besides this, and occasional Sermons,
etc., he has published Dyer’s Psalmist; Songs and Ballads; The Drunkard’s Child; Ruth, a
Sacred Cantata; Winter’s Evening Entertainment; and Great Wonders in Little Things, a
charming book for boys and girls. Hehas also issued more than two hundred Songs in
sheet music, and some of his songs have been set to as many as eight different tunes.

"Among the songs thus honored may be mentioned: Ah! yes, I Remember; Spare the Old

Homestead; The Songs My Mother Sung; and the Grave of Ben Bolt.

church at New Brunswick. Mr. Hageman has given decided evidences of poetic talent. He
published in 1868, the year of his graduation, a volume of poems, called Vesper Voices.

The two stanzas quoted below are from an unpublished poem on Silence:

SILENCE.

God shall keep the spaceless secret
Of the Silence in his heart,
Through the crescent years of knowledge,
Through the golden days of art; .
Silent heart, whose birthless beatings
Throb so softly in their place,
That God cannot hear himself
In all the continent of space.
Greatness lies insphered in silence,
Littleness to sound is stirred;
All the grandest things of nature
Have been seen, but never heard,
Proving well by printless logic
All the science of the school:
Silence is the law of being,
Sound the breaking of the rule.

RAY PALMER, D.D., 1808 -——, is a native of Rhode Island, and a graduate of Yale, of the

MARK F. BIGNEY, —— --—-, is a native of Nova Scotia, but for many years a resident of
New Orleans. Besides much editorial labor, particularly in the New Orleans Times, he has
published, 1867, a volume of excellent poetry, The Forest Pilgrims and Other Poems.

HENRY M. CLARKSON, M. D., —— ,a native and resident of South Carolina, and a
graduate of the Medical College of Charleston, has published a volume, Evelyn and Other
Poems, which is well spoken of.

 

MAJ. LAMAR FONTAINE, —— , of Texas, is the author of several war lyrics, and among
others claims to have written the piece generally known as The Picket Guard, or All Quiet
Along the Potomac. On the other hand, this piece ﬁrst appeared in Harper’s Weekly, No-
vember, 1861, to which periodical it was contributed by Mrs. Ethel Beers. Those interested
in the question of the authorship of this piece are referred to Davidson’s Living Writers of
the South, p. 194. The piece itself is one of the most remarkable lyrics produced by the
War. ‘

THE PICK ET GUARD.

All quiet along the Potomac, they say,
Except here and there a stray picket

Is shot, as he walks on his beat to and fro,
By a riﬂeman hid in the thicket.

’T is nothing, a private or two now and then
Will not count in the news of the battle.

Not an officer lost, only one of the men
Meaning out all alone the death-rattle.

All quiet along the Potomac to-night,
Where the soldiers lie peacefully dreaming;

Their tents in the rays of the clear autumn moon,
Or in the light of their camp-ﬁres gleaming;

A tremulous sigh, as a gentle night wind,
Through the forest-leaves softly is creeping,

W'hilc the stars up above, with their glittering eyes,
Keep guard o’er the army while sleeping.

There’s only the sound of the lone sentry’s tread,
As he tramps from the rock to the fountain,

And thinks of the two on the low trundle-bed,
Far away in the cot on the mountain.

His musket falls slack, and his face, dark and grim,
Grows gentle with memories tender,

As he mutters_ a prayer for the Children asleep;
For their mother,—may Heaven defend her!

The moon seems to shine as brightly as then, -
Thut. m'ght when the love yet unspoken .

Leaped up to his lips, and when low-murmured vows
Were pledged to be ever unbroken.

Then drawing his sleeve roughly over his eyes,
He dashes off tears that are Welling,

And gathers his gun close up to its place,
As if to keep down the heart-swelling.

He passes the fountain, the blasted pine-tree;
The footsteps are lagging and weary;

352 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Yet onward they go, through the broad belt of light,
Toward the shade of the forest so dreary.

Hark! was it the night wind rustling the leaves?
VVas it moonlight so wondrously ﬂashing?

It looked like a riﬂe! “Ha! Mary, good-by.”
And the life-blood is ebbing and splashing.

All quiet along the Potomac to~night,
No sound save the rush of the river;

Whilst soft falls the dew on the face of the dead,-
The picket’s of duty, forever!

Henry Lynden, Flash.

HENRY LYNDEN FLASH, 1837 , of Alabama, published, in 1860, a
volume of Poems of uncommon power and beauty. During and since the

published no additional Volumes.

Mr. Flash is a native of the West Indies, of English descent, connected with the Wilber-
force family. He studied for a while at Georgetown College, D. C., and afterwards in Ken-
tucky. The following poem needs no eulogy. It cannot fail to make the reader wish to
hear again from the same author. '

VVHAT SHE BROUGHT ME.

This faded ﬂower that you see,
Was given me, a year ago,

By one whose little dainty hand
Is whiter than the snow.

Her eyes are blue as violets,
And she’s a ‘blonde, a.nd very fair,

And sunset-tints are not as bright
As is her golden hair.

And there are roses on her cheeks
That come and go like living things;

Her voice is softer than the brook’s
That ﬂows from hidden springs.

She gave it me with downcast eyes,
And rosy ﬂushes of the cheek,

That told of tender‘ thoughts her tongue
Had never learned to speak.

The ﬁtting words had just been said,
That she was mine as long as life;

I gently laid the ﬂower aside,
And kissed my blushing wife.

She took it up with earnest. look,
And said, “Oh, prize the ﬂower,” --

And tender tears were in her eyes,-
“It is my only dower.”

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 353

She brought me Faith, and Hope, and Truth,
She brought me gentle thoughts and love,

A soul as pure as those that ﬂoat
Around the throne above.

But earthly things she nothing had,
Except this faded ﬂower you see;

And though ’tis worthless in your eyes,
’T is very dear to me.

MRS. MARY E. TUCKER, 1838 -——, is a native of Alabama. Her maiden name was Perine.
She was married to Mr. Tucker, of Milledgcville, Ga. After the ‘war, she went to New York,
wliere she has since lived, engaged in writing for the journals and magazines. Her ﬁrst
volume, a collection of Poems, appeared in 1867. Another brief.poem was published sepa-
rately, called Loew’s Bridge, a Broadway Idyl. It is a description of the moving throng of
Broadway as seen from the bridge at the intersection of Broadway and Fulton Street. Her
latest and largest book was A Life of Mark M. Pomeroy, Editor of the La Crosse Democrat.

MRS. MARY S. HOMES, ——- ——--, is a native of Frederick City, Md. She is the daughter of
Thomas Shaw, long the Cashier of the Frederick County Bank. After her father’S death,
she removed with the rest of the family to New Orleans, where she has since resided. She
was ﬁrst» married to Mr. Norman Rogers, and afterwards, in 1864, to Mr. Luther Homes.
Mrs. Homes has written for the most part under the nameof “Millie Mayﬁeld.” Her ﬁrst
volume was in prose, Carrie Harrington, or Scenes in New Orleans, 1857. Her next vol-
ume was in verse, Progression, or The South Defended, 1860. Besides these two volumes, she

has contributed numerous poetical articles to current literature.

MRS. JULIA P. CRESWELL, ——- ———, is a native of Huntsville, Ala. Her father was Colonel
James J. Pleasants, of Virginia, and her mother was Miss Bibb, daughter of Governor Bibb
of Alabama. Miss Pleasants was married, in 1854, to Mr. Creswell, a lawyer of distinction,
who before the war was one of the Judges of the State of Alabama. Judge Creswell became

following works: Apheila and Other Poems (the joint production of herself" and her cousin
Thomas Bibb M. Bradley), 1854; Poems by herself only ; Callamura, a novel, 1868.

Mrs. Margaret J. Preston.

MRS. MARGARET J UNKIN PRESTON, —— , of Lexington, Va., is
at this time the sweetest singer of the Old Dominion. She has never made
literature a profession, yet she has been for twenty-ﬁve years a frequent
contributor to the magazines, and she has published three volumes of poems
which have been received with marked favor. The most considerable of
these was Beechenbrook, a Rhyme of the War.

Mrs. Preston’s maiden name was J unkin. She is a daughter of the late Dr. George J unkin,
who at the outbreak of the war was President of Washington College, at Lexington. The
father sympathized with the North, and left the College. The daughter sympathized with
her husband, Col. Preston, of the Military Institute at Lexington, and with her sister’s hus-
band, Stonewall Jackson, and her other Southern friends. The poetry of Beechenbrook is

tinctulredaccordingly with warm Southern feeling. The book has been very popular in the
South, and has had many admiring readers in more northernly latitudes. N o fair-minded
reader can well help admiring such passages as the lines on Stonewall Jackson’s Grave,
or the pathetic lyric, Slain in Battle.

Another volume, Silverwood, a book of Memories, was published in 1856. Her latest vol-
ume, published in 1870, and called Old Song and New, is almost entirely religious, and con-

tains little or no allusion to the war. It is made up, as its name indicates, of short lyrics

which had appeared through various channels and at different dates. The Proem to this

ton’s ﬁne literary taste.

Mrs. Preston has been of late years a frequent contributor to Gen. Hil1’s magazine, The
Land We Love. She Was, as Margaret J unkin, a favorite contributor to Sartain’s Magazine,
in 1849 and ’50.

DEDICATION.

Day-duty done, I’ve idled forth to get

An hour’s light pastime in the shady lanes,

And here and there have pluckt with careless pains
These Wayside waifs,—sweetbrier and violet,

And such—like simple things that seemed indeed
Flowers,—though, perhaps, I knew not ﬂower from weed.

What shall I do with them? They ﬁnd no place

In stately vases where magnolias give

Out sweets in which their faintness could not live:
Yet tied with grasses, posy-wise, for grace,

I have no heart to cast them quite away,

Though their brief bloom should not outlive the day.

Upon the open pages of your book
I lay them down:—And if within your eye
A little tender mist I may descry,

Or a sweet sunshine ﬂicker in your look,-
Right happy will I be, though all declare
No eye but Love’s could ﬁnd a violet there.

SLAIN IN BATTLE.

Break, my heart, and ease this pain;
Cease to throb, thou tortured brain;
Let me die, since he is slain——

Slain in battle!

Blessed brow, that loved to rest

Its dear whiteness on my breast;

Gory was the grave it prest-
Slain in battle!

Oh! that still and stately form!

Nevermore shall it be warm,

Chilled beneath that iron storm-
Slain in battle!

Not a pillow for his head;

Not a hand to smooth his bed;

Not one tender parting said-
Slain in battle!

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 355

Straightway from that bloody sod,
Where the trampled horsemen trod,
Lifted to the arms of God—

Slain in battle!

Not my love to come between,

With its interposing screen;

N aught of earth to inte_rvene——
Slain in battle! ,

Snatched the purple billows o’er,

Through the ﬁendish rage and roar,

To the far and peaceful shore——-
Slain in battle!

Nunc (lemme, thus I pray;

What else left for me to say,

Since my life is reft aWay?——
Slain in battle!

Let me die, 0 God! the dart

Drinks the life~blood of my heart;

Hope, and joy, and peace depart!-
Slain in battle!

KEEPING HIS WORD.
In
“ Only a penny a box,” he said:
But the gentleman turned away his head,
As if he shrankfrom the squalid sight
Of the boy who stood in the failing light.

“Oh, sir,” he stammered, “you cannot know-

(And he brushed from his matches the ﬂakes of snow,

That the sudden tear might have chanced to fall,)
“Or, I think——I think you will take them all.

“Hungry and cold, at our garret pane,
Ruby will Watch till I come again,
Bringing the loaf. The sun has set,
And he has n’t a crumb of breakfast yet.

“One penny, and then I can buy the bread.”
The gentleman stopped. “And you?” he said.

“ I .?—I can put up with them, hunger and cold,
But Ruby is only ﬁve years old.

“I promised our mother before she went-—
She knew I would do it, and died content-
I promised her, sir,,through best, through Worst,
I always would think of Ruby ﬁrst.”

The gentleman paused at the open door;
Such tales he had often heard before;

But he fumbled his purse in the twilight drear—
“I have nothing less than a shilling here.”

“Oh, sir, if you will only take the pack,
I’ll bring you the change in a moment back;
Indeed you may trust me!” “Trust you?-no;
But there is the shilling; take it and go.”

II.

The gentleman lolled in his easy-chair,

And watched his cigar-wreath melt in the air,
And smiled on his children, and rose to see
The baby asleep on its mother’s knee.

“And now it is nine by the clock,” he said,
“Time that my darlings were all abed;
Kiss me ‘good-night,’ -and each be sure,
Whenyou ’re saying your prayers, remember the poor.”

Just then came a message —-“ A boy at the door”——
Before it was uttered he stood on the ﬂoor,
Half breathless, bewildered, and ragged and strange;

“I am Ruby—Mz'he’s brother_—1 have brought you the change.

“Mike ’s hurt, sir. ’Twas dark; the snow made him blind,
And he did n’t take notice the train wasbehind,
Till he slipped on the track—and then it whizzed by,
And he’s home in the garret. I think he will die.

“ Yet nothing\ would do him, sir—_nothing would do,
But out through the snow I must hurryto you.
Of his hurt he was certain you would n’t have heard,
And so you might think he had broken his w_or0l.”

When the garret they hastily entered, they saw

Two arms, mangled, shapeless, outstretched from the straw.
“You did z't_—decw' Rubg,/— God bless you!” he said,

And the boy, gladly smiling, sank back—-and was dead.

of Mint Julep, a story in verse. The work last named “ is a playful eifusion, marked by un-
mistakable ability, and full of ﬁne hits, sly humor, and playful fancy, with no want of genu-
ine ﬁre. It is a species of melcmge humor, in which the burlesque and mock-heroic prevail,
which has been compared to the Rev. Mr. Barham’s celebrated Ingoldsby Legends.”—J.
Wood Davidson.

QRIGIN OF “MINTHE.”—-From “Pluto.”

It chanced, as his majesty wandered, one day,
Through his realm, in a listlessly loitering way,
That he came to a ferry,
From which a grim wherry
Crossed over Cocytus, a river so very
Peculiar, that really, believe it who can,
It was wholly a river and partly a man!
It was certainly water,
And yet had a daughter,
So fair and so lovely, that every one thought her
A goddess, and numberless suitors had sought her
With patient persistence, which certainly ought to
Have melted her heart, and enduced her to leave
Her watery old father, whose name means “to grieve.”

King‘Pluto had heard of the fame of this maid,
And though an old gentleman, sober and staid,
“Very married,” besides, had no business to know
Any charms in black eyes, or in shoulders of snow.

GOING OUT AND COMING IN.

Going out to fame and triumph,
Going out to love and light;

Coming in to pain and sorrow,
Coming in to gloom and night:

Going out with joy and gladness,
Coming in with woe and sin;

Ceaseless stream of restless pilgrims
Going out and coming in!

Through the portals of the homestead,
From beneath the blooming vine;

_FROM 1850, TO THE PRESENT TIME. 359

To the trumpet-tones of glory,

Where the bays and laurels twine;
From the loving home-caresses,

To the chill voice of the world—-
Going out with gallant canvas

To the summer breeze unfurled.

Through the gatewa.y, down the footpath,
Through the lilacs by the way;
Through the clover by the meadow,
Where the gentle home-lights stray;
To the wide world of ambition,
Up the toilsome hill of fame,
Winning oft a mighty triumph,
Winning oft a nobler name.

Coming back all worn and weary-
Weary with the world’s cold breath;

Coming to the dear old homestead,
Coming in to age and death:

Weary of its empty ﬂattery,
Weary of its ceaseless din,

Weary of its heartless sneering,
Coming from the bleak world in.

Going out with hopes of glory,
Coming in with sorrows dark;
Going out with sails all ﬂying,

‘ Coming in with mastless bark;
Restless streams of pilgrims, striving
Wreaths of fame and love to win,
From the doorways of the homestead

Going out and coming in.

The Cary Sisters.

ALICE and PH(EBE CARY were so connected in their lives, and are so
linked together in the recollections of the public, that no record of either
can be truthful or complete without containing at the same time a record
of the other. They will be noticed therefore together.

Alice Cary, 1820-1871, and Phoebe Cary, 1824-1871, were born on a farm, eight miles north '

of Cincinnati. They had no advantages of early education, except the usual attendance
upon the district school.

The sisters were unlike in mind and body. Alice was possessed of extreme delicacy, was
timid in disposition and feeble in health. Phoebe was possessed of robust health, was self-
reliant, and had no small share of humor and wit.

Alice began writing about 1838. Her first publications appeared in the Cincinnati papers.
She next wrote for the'Ladies’ Repository, Cincinnati, and for Graham’s Magazine. In 1847
she began writing, both prose and verse, for the National Era, at Washington.

In 1850 a volume of poems by Alice and Phoebe Cary appeared, edited by Griswold. Of
this volume about one third was by Phoebe, the rest by Alice.

In 1851, their mother being dead, and the family considerably broken up, the sisters, aged
respectively thirty-one and twenty-seven, with no means of support but their brains and
their ﬁngers, went to New York to make a living by literature. Instead of boarding, they
rented a small, cheap house, and set up house-keeping, and there, by economy, and by dint
of hard work, they managed to keep the wolf -at bay. Graduallyhsigns of_ thrift appeared;
and eventually they lived in a house of their own, not large or showy, but comfortable, and
paid for by the labor of their hands.- Here they received weekly, without ostentation, literary
and artistic guests, and dispensed for many years a quiet, inexpensive hospitality. “Their
parlor was not so large as some others, but quite as neat and cheerful; and the few literary
persons or artists who occasionally met at their informal invitation, to discuss with them a
cup of tea and the newest books, poems, and events, might have found many more pretens
tious, but few more enjoyable, gatherings. I have a dim recollection that the ﬁrst of these
little tea-parties was held up two ﬂights of stairs, in one of the less fashionable sections of
the city; but good things were said there, that I recall with pleasure even yet; while of
some of the company, on whom I have not since set eyes, I cherish a pleasant and grateful
remembrance. As their circumstances gradually though slowly improved, by dint of dili-
gent industry and judicious economy, they occupied more eligible quarters ; and the modest
dwelling they have for some years owned and improved, in the very heart of this emporium,
has long been known to the literary guild as combining one of the best private libraries,
with the sunniest drawing-room (even by gas-light) to be'found between King’s Bridge and
the Battery.”—Ho7'ace Greeley.

To the evening gatherings here alluded to, Phoebe contributed many attractions of mind,
person, and accomplishment. In her presence, every guest, however obscure or humble,
was Inade to feel perfectly at home, and her genial wit sparkled and corruscated to the de-
light of all around her. Iler repartee often out like a Damascus blade. On one occasion, a

certain well-known actor, then recently deceased, and more conspicuous for his professional
skill than for his private virtues, was discussed. “We shall never,” remarked some one,
“ see ——- again.” “ No,” quickly responded Phoebe, “ not until we go to the pit.” Her con-
versation abounded in turns as quick and sharp as this; but her wit was never used to
wound any one.

Alice died in February, and Phoebe in July, 1871.

They wrote chiefly for the New York Tribune, and Independent, though not conﬁning
themselves to these periodicals, and appearing in frequent volumes, both prose and versi-.

Of the separate publications, those of Alice are: Hagar, a novel ; Lyra and Other Poems ;
Clovernook; Married, not Mated, a novel ; Poems; Pictures of Country Life, prose; A Lover’s
Diary. The separate volumes by Phoebe are: Poems and Parodies; Poems of Faith, Hope,
and Resignation.

The parents of the Cary sisters Were among the early converts to Universalism, and the

daughters were earnest believers and advocates of the same faith. A religious spirit pervades
the writings of both. and some of their hymns have been favorites with people of all
creeds.

A curious and beautiful incident is told in regard to one of these hymns, called “ Nearer
Home,” and written by Phoebe Gary. A gentleman in China, intrusted with packages for a
young man from his friends in the United States, learned that he would probably be found
in a certain gambling-house. He went thither, but not seeing the young man, sat down
and waited in the hope that he might come in. The place was a bedlam of noises, men get-
ting angry over their cards, and frequently coming to blows. Near him sat two men — one
young, the other forty years of age. They were betting and drinking in a terrible way, the
older one giving utterance continually to the foulest profanity. Two games had been ﬁn-
ished, the young man losing each time. The third game, with fresh bottles of brandy, had
just begun, and the young man sat lazily back in his chair, while the oldest shuﬁled his
cards. The man was a long time dealing the cards ; and the young man, looking carelessly
about the room, began to hum a tune. He went on, till at length he began to sing the hymn
of Phoebe Cary above quoted. The words, says the writer of the story, repeated in such a
vile place, at ﬁrst made me shudder. A Sabbath-School hymn in agambling den! But
while the young man sang, the elder stopped dealing the cards, stared at the singer a mo-
ment, and, throwing the cards on the ﬂoor, exclaimed: “ Harry, where did you learn that
tune?” “What tune? ” “Why, that one you ’ve been singing.” The young man said he
did not know what he had been singing, when the elder repeated the words, with tears in
his eyes, and the young man said he had learned them in a Sunday-School in America.
“Come,” said the elder, getting up; “come, Harry. Here ’s what I won from you. Go and
use it for some good purpose. As for me, as God sees me, I have played my last game, and
drank my last bottle. I have misled you, Harry, and I am sorry. Give me your hand, my
boy, and say that, for old America’s sake, if for no other, you will quit this infernal
business.”

NEARER HOME.

One sweetly solemn thought
Comes to me o’er and o’er;

I’m nearer my home to-day
Than I ever have been before;

Nearer my Father’s house,
Where the many mansions be;

Nearer the great white throne,
Nearer the crystal sea;

Nearer the bound of life,
Where we lay our burdens down;

31

362   AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Nearer leaving the cross,
Nearer gaining the crown.

But the waves of that silent sea.
Roll dark before my sight,

That brightly the other side
Break on a shore of light.

Oh, if my mortal feet

I-Iave almost gained the brink,
If it be I am nearer home

Even to-day than I think,

Father, perfect my trust,
Let my spirit feel in death
That her feet are ﬁrmly set
On the Rock of a living faith.—-Phoebe Cary.

A PSALM OF LIFE.

Tell me not in idle jingle,
l\'Iarriage is an empty dream,

For the girl is dead that ’s single,
And things are not what they seem.

Married life is real, earnest;
Single blessedness a ﬁb;

Ta’en from man, to man returnest,
Has been spoken of the rib.

Not enjoyment, and not sor.row,
Is our destined end or way;
But to act, that each to-morrow

Nearer brings the. wedding-day.

Life is long, and youth is ﬂeeting,
And our hearts, if there we search,

Still like steady drums are beating
Anxious marches to the church.

In the World’s broad ﬁeld of battle,
In the bivouac of life,

Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
Be a woman, be a wife!

Trust no Future, howe’er pleasant!
Let the dead Past bury its dead!

Act——-act in the living Present:
Heart within, and Man ahead!

Lives of married folks remind us
We can live our lives as well,
And, departing, leave behind us
Such examples as will tell ;—

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 2363

Such examples, that another,
Sailing far from IIymen’s port,

A forlorn unmarried brother,
Seeing, shall take heart and court.

Let us then be up and doing, -
With the heart and head begin;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor, and to win.—-Phcebe Oary.

TO AN, EVENING ROSE.

Your tears, my evening rose,
Speak for you. I can almost hear them say:
Day cometh all too soon unto the close——
My sweetheart maketh haste to be away;
Ah! not for all my weeping will he stay.

This blessed morn of grace-
The memory still my pain almost deceives——

He lapped his yellow locks about my face,
And kissed and kissed me deep among my leaves.
Is it a wonder such forsaking grieves?

Nay, my lamenting ﬂower,
But for sad solace, hear me tell you this:

After the lapse of just a little hour,
There cometh ending of all earthly bliss,
No matter howsoever dear it is.

I had a sweetheart too,

And loved him with a lovesurpassing thine;
But when my life was gone out of the dew,

And lost the blushes that did make me ﬁne,

His mouth with smiles for me did cease to shine.

And when my poor, sick heart
Had burned itself to ashes, and was dead,

So that no ruddy drop might_ever start
And run into my cheeks andmake them red,
My soul and I took counsel, and we said:

If not on this low earth,

Then somewhere—in the heavens and in the sky-
This life-long travail surely must give birth

To love too vital with God’s grace, to die:

And we got comfort so, my soul and I.—-Alice Oary.

ORDER FOR A PICTURE.

“Woods and cornﬁelds a little brown,-
The picture must not be over-bright,-
Yet all in the golden, gracious light

Of a cloud when the summer sun is down.

864 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

And always and always, night and morn,
Woods upon woods, and ﬁelds of corn
Lying between them, not quite sere,
And not in the full, thick, leafy bloom,
When the wind can hardly ﬁnd breathing-room
Under their tasse1s;——catt1e near,
Biting shorter the short green grass;
And a hedge of sumach and sassafras,
With bluebirds twittering all around,—-
(Ah, good painter, you can’t paint sound I)
These, and the house where I was born,
Low and little, and black and old,‘
Witli children, many as it can hold,
All at the windows, open wide,-
Heads and shoulders clear outside,
And fair young faces all ablush;
Perhaps you may have seen, some day
Roses crowding the self—sa1ne way,
Out of a Wilding, wayside bush.

“Listen closer. When you have done
With woods, and cornﬁelds, and grazing herds,-
A lady, the loveliest ever the sun
Looked down upon, you must paint for me;
Oh, if I only could make you see
The clear blue eyes, the tender smile,
The sovereign sweetness, the gentle grace,
The woman’s soul, and the angel’s face
That are beaming on me all the while!
I need not speak these foolish words;
Yet one word tells you all I would say,-
She is my mother; you will agree
That all the rest may be thrown away.”—Ah'ce Cary.

Mrs. E. C. Kinney.

   

MRS. ELIZABETH CLEMENTINE KINNEY, , wife of the Hon.
William B. Kinney, long United States Minister to Sardinia, is gifted with
ﬁne poetic talents, and is the author of numerous lyrics which in 1867 were

TO AN ITALIAN BEGGAR-BOY.

Thou miniature of woe!
Thy half-clad meagre form
Gliding along doth go,
Starvation’s spectre! Storm
And sun alike
Unheeded strike
That head which ne’er did covering know,

Thy ravenous gray eyes glare
Like a young w0lf’s, dread boy!
Fearful is chi1dhood’s stare,
Bereft of chi1dhood’s joy:
It makes me wild
To see a child
Who never gladdened at a toy.

Oh, hard must be the lot
That makes a child a dread!
Where children’s smiles are not,
Thorns grow in ﬂowret’s stead;
A child’s glad face
Is Heaven’s own grace
Round manh0od’s stern existence shed.

Turn off that hungry eye,
It gnaws at Pity’s heart!
Here ’s bread; but come not nigh—
Thy look makes agues start!
There, take the whole;
To thy starved soul
No crumb of joy will bread impart.

Thine is the famished cry
Of a young heart unfed,
The hollow spirit’s sigh,
For something more than bread
“Give! give! ”_ it says:
Ah! vain he prays
To man, who prayer to God ne’er said!

Wert thou of woman born?
Did human mother’s breast
Nourish thee, thing forlorn?
Hath any love carest
Thine infant cheek?
Didst ever speak,
Or hear, the name of father blest?

No, no, it cannot be!
Thou‘ art the birth of Want;

_Thy sire was Misery,

Thy mother Famine gaunt:

AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Thou hadst no home, -
The naked dome
Was all the covering Earth could grant.

See! here a happy troup
Of real children come,
Their lips the fond names group
Of Father, Mother, Home!
They go not far——
Love is the star
That draws them back where’er they roam.

But wherefore, with mock grin,
Dost thou pursue these now?
Hath childhood any kin
Or kith with such as thou‘:
One hand did form
The bird and worm -
‘No other kinship these allow.

Hark! there rings Nature’s laugh
Fresh from those Well-fed throats;
Old age leans on his staff
To listen to its notes:
The gush of joy
Makes him a boy,—-
How glad remembrance o’er it gloatsi

Does that spasmodic scream,
Jerked from thy shrunken chest,
A human effort seem
To laugh among the rest?
It shocks the ear,
‘O God! to hear
Woe, through a child’s false laugh, confestl

And have these children all
One "Father, each who owns?
How partial blessings fall
Upon his little ones!
Why, outcast boy,
Must thou mock joy,
While these pour out its natural tones?

Ah! why indeed? Be hushed,
Short-sighted soul, and wait,
To ‘learn why Worms are crushed,
While birds sing at heaven’s gate;
Why pools infect,
While lakes reﬂect
The pure sky, and bear Fortune’s freight.

EDMUND C. STEDMAN, 1833 —-—, mentioned in the preceding sketch, and son of the poetess,
Mrs. E. O. Kinney, has won‘ for himself an honored name in the ﬁeld of letters. He was

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 367

born in Hartford, Conn., and graduated at Yale. He went to New York in 1853, and since
that time has been engaged mostly in literary pursuits. He has contributed at different
times to the Tribune, the World, the Atlantic Monthly, Galaxy, Putnam, and the North
American Review. His separate publications are the following: Poems, Lyric and Idyllic;
Alice of Monmouth, an Idyl of the Great War, with other Poems; The Blameless Prince
and other Poems; The Battle of Bull Run; Letter of an Army Correspondent.

Mr. Stedman is a member of the New York Stock Exchange, but gives much of his time
to the cultivation of letters.

MRS. EMELINE S. SMITH, 1823 ——-, wife of Mr. James M. Smith of the New York bar, and
a native of New Baltimore, N. Y., has published two volumes of poetry: The Fairy’s
Secret and other Poems; Poems and Ballads.

MRS. ANNE C. (LYNCH) BOTTA, ——- ——-, is widely known as a poetess. A collection of her
Poems, handsomely illustrated, and forming an elegant volume, was published in 1848. A
prose book, Leaves from the Diary of a Recluse, appeared in 1845. Her latest work is Hand-
Book of Universal Literature. She was born in Bennington, Vt., and educated in Albany.
She was for many years the centre of a literary circle in New York, and one of the arbiters
of taste in literary matters. She was married, in 1855, to Professor Vincenzo Botta, noticed
elsewhere in this volume.

Mrs. Sarah T. Bolton.
MRs. SARAH T. BOLTON, 1820

, is one of the sweet singers of the

West. Her poems have never been collected in book-form, though emi-

nently deserving of that honor.

Mrs. Bolton’s maiden name was Barritt. She was born at Newport, Ky. Her mother was
one of the Pendletons of Virginia. Mr. Barritt removed to Indiana when Sarah was only
three years old, and she has resided ever since in that State. She began to write verses
for the newspapers when only sixteen years old. Writing for the paper led to an acquaint-
ance with the editor, Mr. Nathaniel Bolton, and ended in her marriage to him.’ Mr. Bolton
soon after became involved in his affairs, during the ﬁnancial crisis of 1837-8. “ To extricate
himself from his difficulties, he opened a tavern on his farm, a short distance west of the
city of Indianapolis. Mrs. Bolton, then scarcely seventeen years old, found herself encum-
bered with the care of a large dairy and a public house. To aid as much as possible in
relieving her husband from embarrassment, she dispensed with help, and with her own
hands, often for weeks and months, performed all the labor of the establishment. Thus,
for nearly two years, this child of genius, to whom song was as natural as to the bird
of the greenwood, resigned herself to incessant toil and care, in order that she might aid her
husband in meeting the pecuniary obligations which honesty _or honor might impose.
During those long and dreary years of toil and self-denial, she wrote little orgnothing. At
last the crisis was reached, the work accomplished, and the bird so long caged and tuneless
was again free to soar into the region of the sun.”———William C’. Larrabee, in the Ladies’
Repository.

Mr. Bolton, on returning to Indianapolis, was enabled to establish himself in a neat cot-
tage, which has been the home of the family ever since. In 1855, Mr. Bolton was appointed
Consul at Geneva, Switzerland, and Mrs. Bolton accompanied him during part of his Euro-
pean sojourn. He returned in feeble health in 1857, and died in the following year. While
in Europe, she wrote. letters for the Cincinnati Commercial and the New York Home Jour-
nal. Some of them, like Paddle Your Own Canoe, are very familiar to the public ear. The
impulse which drives her to song is well expressed in the following lines _:

368 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Breezes from the land of Eden
Come to fan me with their wing,
Till my soul is full of music,
And I cannot choos'e but sing.

When a sparkling fount is brimming,
Let a fairy cloud bestow,

But another drop of water,
And a Wave will overﬂow.

When a thirsty ﬂower has taken
All the dew its heart can bear,
It distributes the remainder
To the sunbeam and the air.

JOSEPHINE POLLARD, —— —-—, a native and resident of New York, is the author of many
beautiful lyrics, as well as of numerous short, pithy prose articles in the periodicals. She
has been for ten years or more a constant contributor to religious periodical literature, and
has written some hymns and sacred songs of great beauty. She has published two Sunday--
School books. Miss Pollard was educated by Rev. Gorham D. Abbot.

OUTSIDE THE GATE.

I stood outside the gate,
A poor, Wayfaring child;
Within my heart there beat
A tempest loud and wild.
A fear oppressed my soul,-
That I might be too late;
And oh! I trembled sore,
And prayed, outside the gate.

“Mercy! ” I loudly cried;
“Oh! give me rest from sin!”
“I will,” a voice replied;
And Mercy let me in.
She bound my bleeding Wounds;
She soothed my aching head;
She eased my burdened soul,
And bore the load instead.

In Mercy’s guise, I knew
The Saviour long abused;
Who often sought my heart,

And wept when I refused.
Oh! what a blest return
For ignorance and sin!
I stood outside the gate,
And JESUS let me in !

Mas. ELIZABETH (AKERS) ALLEN, ——-- —--, published, under her former name of Elizabeth
Akers, many lyrical pieces of high merit. One of these, “Rock me to Sleep, Mother,” has
been very extensively copied. A volume of her Poems was published in 1853, and another
by Ticknor & Fields, in 1867. Mrs. Allen was born and educated in Maine. She has lived
for the last seven years in Richmond, Va.

MRS. MARGARET E. SANGSTER, 1838 —-——, wife of Mr. George Sangster of Williamsburgb,
N. Y., has contributed largely for the last ﬁfteen years to religious periodical literature.
Mrs. Sangster’s maiden name was Munson. She was born in New Rochelle, N. Y., and edu-
cated chieﬂy in Paterson, N. J ., and at Williamsburgh. Her only volumes are two Sunday-
School books—Little Jamie, and Home in Heaven.

THOMAS A. MACKELLAR, 1812 —-, is a native of New York city, and a printer by trade. He
came to Philadelphia in 1833, a11d entered the famous stereotype foundry of L. Johnson &
Co. There he rose by degrees to be the chiefproof-reader of that extensive concern, afterwards
a partner in the house, and, on the death of Mr. Johnson, became its head, the title being
changed to that of MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan. Mr. MacKellar is the author of The Ameri-
can Printer, a manual of Typography for the instruction of beginners. Besides this, which
is strictly in the line of his profession, he has, all through his professional career, sparedsome
time for literary culture, and has published several volumes of excellent poetry. He ﬁrst
came before the public through the columns of N eal’s Gazette, under the signature of Tam
(the initials of his own name). His volumes are : Tam’s Fortnight Ramble and other Poems;
Droppings from the Heart; and Lines for the Gentle and Loving.

Rev. William Baxter.

REV. WILLIAM BAXTER, 1820 ——, of New Lisbon, Ohio, has published
some poems of great merit.

Mr. Baxter was born in Leeds, England, and emigrated with his parents to the United

States in the year 1828. He received his education at Bethany College, Virginia, graduating

in 1845. After leaving College he engaged in the ministry. He preached one year in Pitts- _

burg, Pa., three years in Port Gibson, Miss., seven years at Woodville, Miss., next at Baton
Rouge, La., then at Fayetteville, Ark., at which place he also occupied the position of Presi-
dent of Arkansas College. The college was broken up and destroyed during the war. In
1863, he came to Cincinnati, and remained there between two and three years, preaching and
engaged in literary labors. . .

In 1864, Mr. Baxter published a volume called Pea Ridge and Prairie Grove, or Scenes
and Incidents of the War in Arkansas. This work was received with great favor,‘ was highly
commended by the leading journals of the country, and passed through several editions in a
short time. Entire chapters of the work were copied by the New York Tribune.

During his stay in Cincinnati he wrote several War Lyrics, which appeared in I-larper’s
Weekly. Some of these were very extensively copied, and were recited at Mass Meetings
by Kidd, Murdoch, and other popular elocutionists.

Mr. Baxter published, in 1852, a volume of Poems which was well received. He‘ has
contributed largely to periodical literature, having written for the Ladies’ Repository of Cin-
cinnati, The Southern Literary Messenger, the Millennial Harbinger, and a number of other
journals. He has aided in the preparation of several books which were sold by subscription,
among them a large volume called the Loyal West in the Times of the Rebellion. His hymn
called Let Me Go has found its way into at least a dozen hymn-books and collections of

sacred music. I .
For the last seven years Mr. Baxter has been the pastor of the Christian Church at New

Lisbon, Ohio. One of his sermons with his portrait may be found in a handsome volume
called The Living Pulpit of the Christian Church. He is still engaged in active literary
labor, writing almost every week for some periodical. He is also preparing a Biography
of Elder Walter Scott, a very prominent minister of the religious body known as the Dis-
ciples of Christ.

PAUL HAMILTON HAYNE, 1831 , of Charleston, has acquired con-
siderable reputation, particularly as a lyric poet.

Mr. Hayne was born and educated in Charleston, S. C., and is a resident there. Besides
numerous poetical contributions to periodicals, he has published the following volumes:
Poems, 1855; Sonnets and other Poems, 1857; Avolio, a Legend of the Island of Cos, with
Poems Lyrical, Miscellaneous, and Dramatic, 1860. Mr. Hayne gives abundant evidence of
literary culture, and of an intimate acquaintance with the best English, old and new. He
excels chieﬂy in lyrical poetry, and has written some admirable sonnets. “Mr. Hayne has
an intense love of nature‘; a rich imagination, quick and hold; a limited power of narrative
structure; and a true sense of the beauty of words. His poetry is alive with pent passion,
glowing yet repressed; a tropical wealth of emotion, touched here and there with a dash
of quaintness or a ﬂaw of affectation. He is fervent, but sometimes feeble; musical and
dainty in phraseology; full of earnestness, tenderness and delicacy.”—J. Wood Davidson.

The passionate summer ’s dead! the sky ’s aglow

With roseate ﬂushes of matured desire;

The winds at eve are musical and low

As sweeping chords of a lamenting lyre,

Far up among the pillared clouds of ﬁre,
Whosepomp in grand procession upward grows
With gorgeous blazonry of funeral shows,

To celebrate the summer’s past renown.

Ah me! how regally the heavens look down,
O’ershadowing beautiful autumnal woods,

And harvest—ﬁe1ds with hoarded increase brown,
And deep-toned majesty of golden ﬂoods,

That lift their solemn dirges to the sky,

To swell the purple pomp that ﬂoateth by.

drama; De Soto, a drama; Christine, a troubadour story in verse. He wrote several spirited
war songs during the late War. '

JOHN D. BRYANT, M.D., ——- '—-——, a native and resident of Philadelphia, though not an
author by profession, has a turn towards literature, and has redeemed the time from his
duties as a physician, to write several important works. Dr. Bryant was educated an Episco-
palian, being the son of an Episcopal minister, but in 1841 embraced the faith of the Catholic
Church. His publications have been mostly on religious subjects: Pauline Seward, a tale,
tracing the course of his mind in his conversion to the Catholic Church ; The Immaculate
Conception a Dogma, written after the promulgation of the Papal decree on this subject; Re-
demption, an elaborate poem upon the same subject as the Paradise Lost; The Dark Ages, a.
pamphlet. The most popular of these is Pauline Seward.

Dr. Bryant is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania.

EDWARD YOUNG, 1818' , is the author of a volume called The Ladye Lillian and Other
Poems. Mr. Young was born and educated in England. In early life he came to America,
and settled in Trenton, N. J. Thence, at nineteen, he went to Wisconsin, where in 1839 he
married. Afterwards he went to South Carolina, and thence to Georgia, where he still lives.

JOHN T. HUMPHREYS, 1838 ,a native and resident of Lynchburg, Va., published in
London, in 1866, a volume of poetry which gives evidence of acultivated taste and no little
poetical fancy. The title of the book is Eros, a Series of Connected Poems, by Lorenzo
Solnervillel Mr. Humphreys, after graduating at Randolph Macon College, Virginia, in
1859, went abroad and spent two years at Berlin, studying the German language and litera-
ture. Running the blockade, he returned to Virginia in 1863, and served in the Confederate
army until disabled by a wound in the head which unﬁtted him for further service. Having
a literary turn, and unable from his wound to engage in active pursuits, he devoted himself
to study, and in 1866 went to London and published the volume of Poems already named.
They are the first efforts of a young poet; and as the titleindicates, are all on one theme, the
author writing throughout, and evidently by no ﬁction, in the character of a. lover. Mr.
Humphreys, it is understood, has another velume nearly ready for the press.

Of youth, because it has no shade
Upon its smooth and even grade,
And whence the need of marking time.

I brought a blossom from the garden bed,
Sweet was its fragrance, a11d its face was red;
But ere I saw thee, it was pale and dead.

I found a shell upon the leafy wold,
Its lips were soft, its dress was blue and gold;
But ere I saw thee, all its dyes were cold.

My heart I bring thee from the inner shrine,
Breathe but one hope around it, it will shine,
And wear a hue unchangingly divine.

A drop of amber fell upon a bee,*
And thus" preserved it from corruption free;
Thus would I live in love that comes from thee.

years have been passed in Louisville, Ky.

 

J AMEs RYDER RANDALL, 1839 , is the Tyrtaeus of the late war. He has not published
any volume, but his war lyrics, particularly his Maryland, my Maryland, and one or two
others, spoke to the heart of seven millions of people as nothing else probably that was
written during the war. Mr. Randall is a native of Baltimore, of French and English ex-
traction, “ with a dash of Irish.” He was educated at the Catholic College in Georgetown,
and went to Point Coupée, La., to edit a newspaper. At the close of the war he settled in
Georgia.

newspapers, were collected by a brother in the craft, Mr. Charles Scribner,
and published in a dainty volume, under the title of Hopefully Waiting.

Mr. Randolph was born at Woodbridge, N. J. At the age of four he went to New York,
and has lived there ever since. He “ graduated” at one of the public schools of that city at
the age of ten. Whatever knowledge of culture he has since received, has been gained
by private study.

OUR BABY.
IO

Of all the darling children
That ever a household blessed,

We place our baby for compare
With the fairest and the best.

She came when last the violets
Dropped from the hand of Spring;
When on the trees the blossoms hung -
Those cups of odorous incense swung-

When dainty robins sing.

How glowed the early morning
After a night of rain,

When she possessed our waiting hearts
To go not out again.

“Dear Lord,” we said, with thankful speech,

“Grant we may love thee more

For this new blessing in a cup

That was so full before!”
September, 1858.

II.

This year, before the violets
Had heralded the Spring,

And not a leaf was on the trees,
Nor robin here to sing,

An angel came one solemn night,
Heaven’s glory to bestow,

And take our darling from our sight:

What could we, Lord, at morning light,
But weep, and let her go!

How dark the day that followed
That dreary night of pain;
Those eyes now closed, and never more
To open here again!
“Dear Lord,” we said, with broken speech,
, “Grant weniay love thee more
For this new jewel in the crown

Where we had two before!”
September, 1860.

ERASTUS W. ELLSWORTH, 1822 , is a native and a resident of East Windsor Hill, Conn.
He graduated at Amherst in 1844, and studied law. Having a predilection for mechanism,
he has devoted his time chieﬂy to the business of invention, and has patented several valu-

 

able machines of great advantage to the public, as well as of proﬁt to himself. He pub- ‘

lished about twenty years ago some admirable poems in Sartain’s and Putnan1’s magazines,
and in 1855 he issued a volume of Poems. Since that, the reading public has not heard
from him. The presumption is that machinery and steam have silenced the Muse. The
short lyric quoted below, taken from the collection of 1855, could have been written by no
me who was not at heart a poet.

SHAKESPEARE.

What more extolling, from the tongue of Fame,
Can Shakespeare need than his suggested name,
W110, in a volume so compactly writ,

Has hived the honey of all human wit.

Praise suits, where merit in a corner lies,

But seems uncomely to the acknowledged wise.
Praise suits, where laboring Art, at times, succeeds,
And the shrewd reader pardonsas he reads;
But fails, in wonder, where the leaves dispense
Infinite resource of intelligence-

Where the great Player, at his game of chess,
Frolics through all, to glorious success’-
Thrids, with exulting ken a boundless maze;
Plays with his kings, and kings it in his plays.
Swan of the Avon! Genius of the Thames,
“That so diclst take Eliza and (king) James!”-
Muse or so vast a ﬂight, so ample pinion,
Whose name is as the name of a dominion!
Though kings be great, give glory to the pen;
A whole-souled Poet is the king of men:

King and high-priest, one bard, at least, has been.
Lo! where we lesser Levites pause and quail,
How grandly goes before, within the veil,

Our great Melchizedec, without compeers,
Without progenitors, nor end of years.

ROBERT W. WRIGHT, 1816 , was born in Ludlow, Vt. ; graduated at Yale College, in 1842;
admitted to the Suffolk bar in Boston, in 1845; practised law in Wisconsin for twelve years;

removed to Connecticut in 1857, where he mainly devoted himself to journalism for about
ﬁfteen years, editing successively the Waterbury Journal, IIartl'ord Daily Post, New Haven
Daily News, Daily Register. and Daily Lever, besides ﬁlling the office of Judge of Probate
for one year, and that of Executive Secretary of State for three years, and writing for vari-
ous magazines and otherjournals than those above named. He is at the present time (1872)
ﬁlling the chair of editor-in-chief of the Richmond (Va.) Daily and Weekly State Jour_nal.
Mr. Wright has cultivated the Muses more as a matter of recreation, it would seem. than
with any view to build up a reputation as a poet. He has published three poems only, two in
book-form, and one in brochure. The titles of these are: The Church Knaviad, or Horace in
VVest Haven, by Horatius Flaccus, a satirical mock-heroic poem of three hundred and seventy
six-line stanzas ; The Vision of Judgment, or the South Church, Ecclesiastical Councils,
viewed from Celestial and Satanic Stand-points, by Quevedo Redivivus, J r., a satire in three
Cantos, written in the Italian or Don Juan stanza; and The Pious Chi-Neh, or a Veritable
History of the Great Election Fraud, done in verse by U. Bet, a humorously illustrated
pasquinade of seventy stanzas, on the election of 1871, in Connecticut, modulated after Bret
Harte. Of the ﬁrst—named of these productions, the Ilome Journal, edited at the time by
N. P. Willis, without knowing the author, said : “ The preface is one of the best ever written to
express the proper office of a preface, and the author of it, whoever he may be, is a Satirist
who either is, or ought to be, famous.” Of the second-named work, the London Times, to
whose critical editor an American gentleman. had presented a copy, says: “ The incidents
of the poem are entirely local, and yet it rises, in some of its passages, to the dignity of a
national satire. It is to be regretted that the author did not land his Peri .in Washington,
and make the poem What it should have been in this respect, a national one; for it is the
sharpest satire ever written by an American.” And of the Pious Chi-Neh (chief Nehemiah),

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 375

the Yale College Courant says :— “ Throughout are evidences of I skill and practice, and
here and there unmistakable touches of a master-hand. The satire is keen, and some of its
ﬂashes lay the ﬂesh open to the bone.”

HENRY TIMROD, 1829-1867, a native of Charleston, S. C., was a poet of brilliant promise.
He entered the University of Georgia, but through lack of means was obliged to leave
the institution before graduating. He studied law for a time with Mr. Petigru, but ﬁnd-
ing the business distasteful left it, and engaged for several years in the occupation of
private tutor, pursuing meanwhile those literary studies which were ever most congenial
to him. A small volume of his Poems was published by Ticknor & Fields, in 1860. On the
outbreak of the war, he supported the Southern cause by stirring patriotic odes. He was
also variously engaged as War Correspondent and as Editor for several papers, though the
delicacy and reﬁnement of his organization, mental and bodily, hardly ﬁtted him for such
rough work. The overthrow of the Confederacy left him poor and without occupation.
After struggling manfully for a while for the support of himself and a dependant family,
and taxing his powers of eﬁbrt and endurance beyond his strength, he died from sheer
exhaustion, at Columbia, S. C., in 1867, at the age of thirty-eight. In 1873 a volume of his
Poems was published, with a Memoir by his friend and schoolmate, Paul H. Hayne.

Mr. Timrod’s poetry is of the school of Wordsworth, studious, thoughtful, and meditative
rather than passionate or sensuous, showing often high ﬁnish, and always a lofty ideal.
Had fortune been more propitious and his life been spared, there can hardly be a doubt that
he would have made for himself a high place in American letters. His name is one which
should be ever dear to his native State and to the sunny clime which he loved so Well.

THE TWO ARMIES.

Two armies stand enrolled beneath

The banner with the starry wreath;

One, facing battle, blight, and blast,
Through twice a hundred ﬁelds has passed;
Its deeds against a ruﬂian foe,

Stream, valley, hill, and mountain know,
Till every wind that sweeps the land

Goes glory laden from the strand.

The other, with a narrower scope,

Yet led by not less grand a hope,

Hath won perhaps as proud a place,
And wears its fame with meeker grace.
Wives march beneath its glittering sign,
Fond mothers swell the lovely line,
And many a sweetheart hides her blush
In the young patriot’s generous ﬂush.

No breeze of battle ever fanned

The colors of that tender band;

Its oﬂice is beside the bed

Where throbs some sick or wounded head;
It does not court the soldiers tomb,

But plies the needle and the loom;

And by a thousand peaceful deeds
Supplies a struggling nation’s needs.

Nor is that army’s gentle miglit
Unfelt amid the deadly ﬁght;

376 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

It nerves the son’s, the husband’s hand,
It points the lover’s fearless brand;

It thrills the languid, warms the cold,
Gives even new courage to the bold;
And sometimes lifts the veriest clod

To its own lofty trust in God.

When Heaven shall blow the trump of peace,
And bid this weary warfare cease,

Their several missions nobly done,

The triumph grasped, and freedom won,

Both armies, from their toils at rest,

Alike may claim the victors crest,

But each shall see its dearest prize

Gleam softly from the other’s eyes.

Walt Whitman.

WALTER WHITMAN, 1819 , is the most singular instance on record
of a successful poetical iconoclast. Holding in contempt all the hitherto
recognized laws of Verse, he has been a law to himself, writing according to
his “own sweet will,” and yet, unlike most literary nulliﬁers, has been suc-
cessful. We may not be able to scan his verse, or to reduce it to any known
scheme of prosody, yet every one’s ear tells him the lines are rhythmical.
As with his verse, so with his matter. He takes subjects accepted in all
ages as essentially vulgar and prosaic, and creates out of them forms of deli-

 

cacy, grace, and beauty.

Mr. Whitman was born at West Hills, N. Y. Like Artemus Ward and other illustrious ,

countrymen, he began life as a printer. He then became successively a school-teacher, an
editor, and a clerk in the government offices at Washington. From 1865 to 1870 he was clerk
in the Attorney-General’s oiﬁce.

His life may be called, in one sense, shiftless. He has not attained to, probably has never
even sought after,isocial distinction and advancement. Like the genial La Fontaine, he is

content to live to himself and to his friends. quite regardless of the world’s opinion. Not M

that his life has been a dissipated one. On the contrary, Whitman is a rather rigid moralist,
but a strong up-bubbling of animal spirits leads him to do and say things which offend so-
ciety. Moreover, he is one of those strongly magnetic characters that have the gift of attract-
ing, even fascinating others.

The article entitled The Carpenter, which appeared in Putnam’s Magazine for January,
1868, is a half-way sketch of this curious kind of personage. He appears as the peace-maker,
the preventer of sin and shame, the friend of the children, the lover of all, who searches the
heart at a glance, and attracts irresistibly, by his simple, unheralded presence. The sketch
receives such delicate vanishing touches that the reader is ﬁnally left in doubt as to
whether Whitman is really the character, or whether it is not the Son of Man himself. The
thought is a bold one, and is redeemed from blasphemy only by its earnest sincerity. It
shows how great is the spell exercised by the wanderer-poet over his circle of friends.

Whitman is not a proliﬁc writer. His ﬁrst work appeared in 1855, under the title Leaves of
Grass. In 1865 appeared“Drum Taps. In 1867 appeared a third volume, including the two
former, and some other poems by way of a sequel. These, and a fewuncollected pieces,
nake up all that the author has put forth in print. It is enough, however, to enable us to

ecognize his peculiar genius.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 377

Walt Whitman is a radical, an iconoclastic democrat. The feudal, the aristocratic, the
traditional are in his eyes well enough in themselves as a past, as a teacher, but they Will.
not serve the coming needs of the country. American talent must seek for itself other, less
conventional modes of expression. There must be freedom from rule and pre_cedent,sponta-
neity, and truthfulness to surrounding nature. And as the principle of democracy is that
all are alike interesting and are akin in essence if not in development, so the poet ——-if we can
indeed call his unrhymed, unmetrical utterances poetry ——- gives us the average of life,rather
than life in its highest, most differentiated types. He feels himself a.kin to the farmer, the
blacksmith, the lowly of every class, -— even to the vicious and morally degraded, for they too
are his brethren. He does not present them to us, as Dickens does, with a view to excite our
laughter or our tears, or as Scott, for instance, has done, with a certain aristocratic con-
descension. He shows them to us simply as our brethren and our equals. Whitman even
goes one step further. In his wide-reaching democratic sympathies he scarcely has leisure
for the individual ; his vision takes in rather the entire class,or society at large. His poetic
sk_etches are not even democratic portraits, but so many kaleidoscopic views of restless, shift-
ing, human life as it surges past the poet’s gaze.

His diction is extremely terse and idiomatic. The words come quick and apt; the general
thought sweeps along with a vigorous, unimpeded ﬂow. The atmosphere is pure and brac-
ing. But, as might be anticipated, there is not much harmony, and scarcely even an attempt
at symmetry. He makes no pretense to giving us anything well rounded off. His utter-
ances are those of a keen,-eyed, whole-souled, philosophic spirit,—who sees each object in its
real shape and true light, for a moment, but can linger over none.

From whatever point of view we may consider him, he is, if not a true poet, at least a
poetic nature. He is eminently original and inspiriting. He gives us the impression that
we are in company with one who sees with every-day eyes or commonplace soul. Like Goethe,
he looks upon men and the world as though they were fresh from the hands of the Creator
and had never been studied before. However much he may have failed, however sorely he
may have sinned against our preconceived notions and tastes, this will remain his merit,
that he has aroused the public from dull conventionality and imitation, and set us upon
independent thinking.

The lines quoted below are taken from a poem recited before the American Institute, New
York, 1871.

AFTER ALL, NOT TO CREATE ONLY.

After all, not to create only, or found only,

But to bring, perhaps from afar, what is already founded,

To give it our own identity, average, li1nitless, free;

To ﬁll the gross, the turbid bulk with vital religious ﬁre;

Not to repel or destroy, so much as accept, fuse, rehabilitate;

To obey as well as command——to follow, more than to lead;

These also are the lessons of our New VVorld; »

—While how little the New, after a1l——how much the Old, Old Worldlj

Long, long, long, has the grass been growing,
Long and long has the rain been falling,
Long has the globe been rolling round.

Come, Muse, migrate from Greece and Ionia;

Cross out, please, those immensely overpaid accounts,

That matter of Troy, and Achilles’ wrath, and Eneas’, Odysseus’ Wanderings;

Bret Harte.

FRANCIS BRET HARTE, 1837 , is one of the few poets that have
risen to fame by a single bound. His Heathen Chinee and his Condensed
Novels took the public by surprise, and marked the author at once as a man
of genius.

Mr. Harte was born at Albany, N. Y., in 1837, and is in part of Dutch origin. His father,‘

who died whilst Bret was very young, was teacher in a school for young ladies in that city,
and died poor. After the usual common schooling, Mr. Harte saw something of New York,
as clerk in a store, and when seventeen went to California with his widowed mother. He
walked from San Francisco to the mines at Sonora, and there opened a school. The mines
at Sonora probably offered as little encouragement, ﬁfteen or sixteen years ago, to an open-
ing school, as any other quarter of the globe could have done, and Mr. Harte’s experiment
was brief, and by no means triumphal; though it helped on his own self-education, by sug-
gesting the use of mining-life in literature.

He tried mining for a while, and then having picked up the readily acquired art of print-
ing, he became a compositor in a newspaper office at Eureka, where he began life as an
author by “setting up ” various essays and contributing them to the journal in type. Dur—
ing the absence of the editor he once controlled the journal, and incurred popular wrath
for censuring a little massacre of Indians by the leading citizens and most remarkable men
of the locality. His erring sympathies excited something like a mob, and doubtless in-
volved the editor in endless apologies and explanations. At any rate, Mr. Harte went back
to San Francisco, where, after working for a while as compositor, he was given an editorial
place on The Golden Era. Then followed an unsuccessful newspaper enterprise of his own,
-—unsuccessfu_l commercially, though The Californian, which he and Mr. Webb managed,
was lively and agreeable literature, and merits remembrance for the publication of Mr.

Harte’s delightful parodies, “The Condensed Novels.” When the Overland Monthly was
established, Mr. Harte was naturally and obviously the ﬁt editor for it, and in his charge

it achieved enviable distinction. He gave it tone and character, and imbued it, in a degree_

unprecedented, save with the publications which Charles Dickens edited, with the literary
ﬂavor of the editor. In other words, Mr. Harte founded a school, ——aschool which ought to
remove any lingering regrets for the failure of the educational establishment at the mines
of Sonora. Mr. Harte published some small collections of verse in San Francisco. But
in 1869, Fields, Osgood & 00., of Boston, brought out in handsome style The Luck of
Roaring Camp and Other Stories, and since that have published in book-form The Con-
densed Novels and two volumes of Poems. They have also, by the payment, it is Il[](l(‘-I‘-=

THE HEATHEN CHINEE.

Which I wish to remark,-
And my language is plain,-
1‘hat for ways that are dark
And for tricks that are vain,
The heathen Chinee is peculiar.
Which the same I would rise to explain.

Ah Sin was his name;
And I shall not deny

In regard to the same
What that name might imply;

But his smile it was pensive and childlike,
As I frequent remarked to Bill N ye.

It was August the third;
And quite soft was the skies;

Which it might be inferred
That Ah Sin was likewise;

Yet he played it that day upon William
And me in a way I despise.

Which we had a small game,
And Ah Sin took a hand:
It was Euchre. The same
He did not understand;
But he smiled as he sat by the table,
With the smile that was childlike and bland.

Yet the cards they were stocked
In a way that I grieve,

And my feelings were shocked
At the state of N ye’s sleeve,

Which was stuffed full of aces and bowers,
And the same with intent to deceive.

But the hands that were played
By that heathen Chinee,

And the points that he made,
Were quite frightful to see,-

Till at last he put down a right bower,
Which the same Nye had dealt unto me.

380

AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Then I looked up at Nye,
And he gazed upon me;

And he rose with a sigh,
And said, “ Can this be?

We are ruined by Chinee cheap Iab0r,”—-
And he Went for that heathen Ohiuee.

In the scene that ensued
I did not take a hand,

But the floor it was strewed
Like the leaves on the strand

With the cards that Ah Sin had been hiding,
In the game “he did not understand.”

In his sleeves, which were long,
He had twenty-four packs,—-

Which was coming it strong,
Yet I state but the facts;

And we found on his nails, which were taper,~--
What is frequent in tapers,—that’s wax.

Which is why I remark,—-
And my language is plain,——
That for ways that are dark,
And for tricks that are vain,
The heathen Chinee is peculiar,-
Which the same I am free to maintain.

A NEVVPORT ROMANCE.

They say that she died of a broken heart
(I tell the tale as ’twas told to me);
But her spirit lives, and her soul is part

Of this sad old home by the sea.

Her lover was ﬁckle a.nd ﬁne and French:
It was nearly a hundred years ago

When he sailed away from her arms——poor \V8I1Chw¢
With the Admiral Rochambeau.

I marvel much what periwigged phrase
Won the heart of this sentimental Quaker.

At what golden-laced speech of ‘those nmdish days
She listened—the mischief take her!

But she kept the posies of mignonette
That he gave; and even as their bloom failed

And faded (though with her tears still wet)
I-Ier youth with their own exhaled.

Till one night, when the sea-fog wrapped a shroud
Round spar and spire, and tarn and tree,

Her soul Went up on that lifted cloud
From this sad old home by the sea.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 381%

And ever since then, when the clock_ strikes two,
She walks unbidden from room to room,

And the air is ﬁlled that she passes through
With a subtle, sad perfume.

The delicate odor of mignonette,

The ghost of a dead and gone bouquet,
Is all that tells of her story; yet

Could she think of a sweeter way?

I sit in the sad old house to-night, -
Myself a ghost from a farther sea;

And I trust that this Quaker woman might,
In courtesy, visit me.

For the laugh is ﬂed from porch and lawn,
And the bugle died from the fort on the hill,

And the twitter of girls on the stairs is gone,
And the grand piano is still.

Somewhere in the darkness a clock strikes two;
And there is no sound in the sad old house,

But the long veranda dripping with dew,
And in the Wainscot a mouse.

The light of my study-lamp streams out
From the library-door, but has gone astray

In the depths of the darkened hall. Small doubt
But the Quakeress knows the way.

Was it a trick of a sense o’erwrought
With outward watching and inward fret?

But I swear that. the air just now is fraught
With the odor of mignonette!

I opened the window, and seem almost -
S0 still lies the ocean—to hear the beat

Of its Great Gulf artery oﬁ” the coast,
And to bask in its tropic heat.

In my neighbor’s Window the gas-lights ﬂare,
As the dancers swing in a waltz of Strauss,
And I wonder how could I ﬁt that air, .

To the song of this sad old house.

And no odor of mignonette there is
But the breath of morn on the dewy laWn;

And mayhap from causes as slight as this
The quaint old legend is born.

But the soul of that subtle, sad perfume,
' As the spiced enihalmings, they say, outlast

382 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

The mummy laid in his rocky tomb,
Awakens my buried past.

And I think of the passion that shook my youth,
Of its aimless loves and its idle pains,

And am thankful now for the certain truth
That only the sweet remains.

And I hear no rustle of stiff brocade,
And I see no face at my library-door;

For now that the ghosts of my heart are laid,
She is viewless for evermore.

But whether she came as a faint perfume,
Or whether a spirit in stole and white,

I feel, as I pass from the darkened room,
She has been with my soul to-night!

Joaquin Miller.

CINCINNATUS HEINE MILLER, 1841 ———, better known as “Joaquin” .

Miller, is another Western celebrity, whose appearance above the horizon
Was even more sudden and meteoric than that of Bret Harte. Miller’s
Songs of the Sierras, published in London in 1871, made him before the
end of the year famous in both continents.

Mr. Miller was born in a log-cabin, in what Was then a wilderness, in the Wabash district
of Indiana, where he had no opportunities of education. In 1851 the family emigrated to
Oregon by the overland route—a journey of ﬁve months, across the deserts, and over the
mountains and valleys that stretched away from the Missouri almost two thousand miles to
the west, without the habitation of a civilized man.

The farming life which his father adopted in Oregon did not suit the dreamy, restless boy.
After three or four years’ work on the farm, therefore, he left his home for the gold regions
of California. ‘

The next ﬁfteen years of his life were the wildest imaginable, and partook of almost every
kind of bold and daring adventure that Bret Harte’s poems have made so familiar to the
public mind. At length, Miller settled down to the study of law, and was admitted to prac-
tice, and in 1870 he was elected Judge. About the same time he published a small volume
of poems, one of which bearing the name of “Joaquin,” he has since that time assumed the
same name for himself. '

In 1863, he married Miss Minnie Theresa Dyer’, who as “Minnie Myrtle ” was a poetical
correspondent of a paper which he was temporarily editing. He called to introduce himself
to her on Friday and married her on Sunday. They were divorced in 1870.

In 1870, he went to Europe, and after travelling over the continent settled down in obscure
lodgings in London. Here he made various attempts to bring his poems before the public,
but for some months without success. At length, some critic, capable of seeing the marks
of genius under the unwonted forms in which it had been clothed, brought the poems to the
notice of a-leading publishing house. Songs of the Sierras thereupon appeared, and created
at once a sensation which has hardly been equalled since the time of Byron.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 383

American Hsymnody.

The history of the various Collections of Psalms and Hymns, which have
been used in the American churches, is a chapter of no little interest in the
history of our literature. A brief account therefore will be given of these
several Psalm and Hymn Books, in connection with a brief notice also
of some of the Writers who have made original contributions to these
collections.

PsALM AND HYMN WRITERS.

The ﬁrst Psalter prepared for use in public worship, in the American churches, origi-
nated, as already explained on page 30, in the Massachusetts colony, and was familiarly
known as The Bay Psalm Book. The ﬁrst settlers had brought with them from Holla.nd
copies of a Book of Psalms, prepared by Henry Ainsworth, an exiled Brownist, and published
in Amsterdam in 1612. But neither this version, nor that of Sternhold and Hopkins, was
literal enough to suit the strict views of the early New England Reformers. Of Hymns, in
our sense of the word, they knew nothing. They sang in public worship nothing but the
Psalms of David, and those they wanted in a form as near as possible to the exact words
of the original, and without regard to the graces of style.

“About the year 1639, the New England Reformers resolving upon a new translation, the
chief divines in the country took each of them a portion to be translated; among whom
Were Mr. Welde and Mr. Eliot of Roxbury, and Mr. [Richard] Mather of Dorchester.”—
Cotton Mather’s Magnalia. '

The result of the labors of these divines was the Bay Psalm Book already mentioned. It
was ﬁrst printed in 1640, and was for a long time almost exclusively used in theANew
England churches. It had, by 1750, passed through at least twenty-seven editions. The
title of this venerable book was as follows: The Whole Book of Psalms faithfully translated
into English metre. Whereunto is preﬁxed a discourse declaring not only the lawfulness,
but also the necessity of the heavenly ordinance of singing Scripture Psalms in the churches
of God. Imprinted, 1640.” The book was revised at different times, by Rev. Henry Dunster,
the ﬁrst President of Harvard, by the Rev. Thomas Prince, and others. It continued in
general and almost exclusive use in New England during the whole colonial period.

Cotton Mather published in 1718 a new literal version of the Psalms, The Psalterium

Americanum. It was in metre, but without rhyme, or, as the author himself says, “ without
any jingle of words at the end.” It does not appear to have been used to any extent by the
churches.
. Other original versions of the Book of Psalms, mostly of little value, were made by Rev.
John Barnard, of Marblehead, Mass., 1752; R. Davidson, D.D., Carlisle, Pa., 1812; ———-— Davis
(somewhere in Pennsylvania), 1813; Joseph P. Bartrum, Boston, 1833; George Burgess
(afterwards Bishop of Maine), Boston, 1840; Samuel McClure, Lewiston, Pa.,18/19; Abner
Jones, New York, 1854——60; M.'L. Hawley, New York, 1868. I

The ﬁrst American edition of Sternhold and Hopkins was published at Cambridge, in
1693. Tate a.nd Brady was not reprinted in America until 1741. Watts’s Hymns were
reprinted the same year in Boston by Franklin, but did not come much into use until after
the Revolution.

The deﬁciencies in Dr. Watts’s Version (he left several Psalms unrendered) were ﬁlled up by
Joel ‘Barlow (1755-1812, noticed elsewhere in this book) ; and also by Timothy Dwight, D.D.,
(1752-1817). These two further revised Watts throughout. Barlow’s revision was “allowed
to be sung ” by the Presbyterian Synod of New York and Philadelphia, 1787 ; and Dwight’s
Was made by request of the Congregational Association of Connecticut, 1797, and adopted by
them, and by the Presbyterian General Assembly in 1800. Dwight’s paraphrase of Psalm

384 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

137, “ I love Thy Kingdom, Lord,” has become universally popular at home, and has won
some acceptance in England.

The earliest American hymnist, as such, who still survives in his works, was the well
known Samuel Davies, who succeeded Jonathan Edwards as President of the College of New
Jersey. Davies’s twelve hymns were published by Dr. Gibbons, 1769, and several of them
are still in use.

Benjamin Cleveland published a. volume of hymns, of which the fourth edition appeared,
Norwich, Conn., 1792. One of them is still popular, “O could I ﬁnd from day to day a near-
ness to my God.” .

Henry Alline (1748-1784) was born at Newport, R. I., and ministered at Falmouth, Nova
Scotia. He published several treatises and sermons, and a volume containing four h_un-
dred and eighty-seven hymns. Of this the third edition appeared, Dover, Mass., 1797. Un-
important.

Lewis Baldwin published one h_undred and ﬁfty-two hymns, Philadelphia, 1808. Never used.

William Bingh-am Tappan (1791-1849), long in the service of the American Sunday-School
Union, published several poetical volumes; but ‘his perhaps best—known pieces, “There is
an hour of peaceful rest,” ant “There is an hour of hallowed peace,” appeared in his earliest
book, New England and other Poems, Philadelphia, 1819.

John Quincy Adams (17 67-18-18), sixth President of the United States, wrote a number of
hymns and versions of psalms, which appeared in Rev. Wm. P. Lunt’s Christian Psalter,
1841. His collected Poems of Religion and Society were published, New York, 1848; fourth
edition, Auburn, 1854.

Dr. Asahel Nettleton’s Village Hymns, which appeared 1824, went through many editions,
and exerted at one time very considerable inﬂuence. The collection contained some origi-
nals, as noticed below, by Mrs. Hyde, Hrs. Sigourney, and Mrs. Phoebe Brown.

Mrs. Phoebe H. Brown (1783-1861) contributed the popular lyric, “I love to steal awhile
away,” to Nettleton’s Village Hymns. This collection also gave to the world nine hymns
by Mrs. Anne Bradley Hyde, some of which are still in use; and several by Mrs. Lydia
Huntley Sigourney (1791-1865), well known as a poetess.

Eliel Davis (1800 to about 1830) wrote “From every earthly pleasure.”

Abram Lucas Hillhouse (1792-1851) was author of a hymn which has been highly praised,
“Humb1y before Thine awful throne.”

The Episcopal Collection of Hymns, 1826, made known some hymns which have since
come into more or less general use. Two were taken from an important volume now scarce,
Songs by the Way, 1824, by George W. Doane (1799-1859), afterward Bishop of New Jersey ;
this book contained several lyrics of considerable merit, besides the exquisite hymn, “ Thou
art the way.” Henry U. Onderdonk, D.D., afterwards Bishop of Pennsylvania, contributed
to the Protestant Episcopal Collection ten hymns, among them, “The Spirit in our hearts.”
Five by Dr. W. A. Muhlenberg appeared then, among them, “ I would not live alway ; ” his few
lyrics were collected in 1859. One good hymn by Francis Scott Key (‘I779-1843) also ap-
peared then; his Poems were published in 1857 : and one by Rev. J. W. Eastburn (1797-1819),
who with R. C. Sands wrote Yamoyden. Subsequent hymnists in the Episcopal Church are
Arthur Cleveland Coxe, D.D., now Bishop of VVestern New York, author of Christian Ballads,
etc.; William Croswell, D.D. (1804-1851),. of Boston, whose Poems appeared 1861; and the
Rev. John Henry Hopkins, whose Carols, Hymns, and Songs were published 1863.

Samuel F. Smith, D.D., (born 1805,) contributed twenty-six hymns to the Baptist Psalmist,
which he edited in 1843. George W. Bethune, D.D., (1805-1862,) wrote a few hymns, most of
which are in his Lays of Faith and Hope, 1818. Leonard Bacon, D.D., (born 1802,) of New
Haven, has written one or two. Rev. George Dufﬁeld (b. 1818) has written hymns, notic-
ably “ Stand up for Jesus.” The Rev. Edwin H. Nevin and Henry Harbaugh, D.D., of Penn-
sylvania, are to be mentioned. More conspicuous work of this sort has been done by Ray
Palmer, D.D., (born 1808,) now Secretary of the Congregational Union in New York. Some
of hishymns have obtained nearly universal acceptance. His Hymns and Sacred Pieces

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 385

were collected in 1865. The venerable Thomas Hastings, Mus. Doc. (born 1784), published
in 1815 one hundred and ninety»nine Devotional Hymns, some of which are well known.
John S. Dwight, son of President Dwight, is a11tl1or of “God bless our native land.” Mrs.
Sarah A. Miles, of Brattleboro, Vt., has written a few good’ hymns. specially “Thou who

didst stoop below.” Wm. H. Burleigh (born 1812) is represented by eleven pieces in Prof. V

Cleveland’s book.

The poets Bryant, Whittier, Holmes, and Lowell, have written a few hymns each: Mr.
Bryant’s, to the number of nineteen, were privately printed in 1869. Mrs. Stowe’s few
sacred lyrics were collected 1867. The sisters Alice and Phoebe Cary have written some
hymns; the latter’s “One sweetly solemn thought,” iswell known. .Her Poems of Faith,
Hope, and Love, appeared 1868.

The Unitarian body, possessing much of the highest intellectual culture and activity of New
England, have produced many hymnists, among whom the Rev. Edmund H. Sears, by his
two exquisite Christmas hymns, holds the ﬁrst rank. It is sufficient further to name John
Pierpont, Jones Very, W. II. Furness, James Freeman Clarke, F. H.Hedge, Andrews Norton,
N. L.‘Frothingham, Henry Ware, Jr., W. B. O. Peabody, T. W. Higginson, Samuel Johnson,
and Samuel Longfellow. 

In translating foreign hymns America has done something, and part of that something
well. Dr. Ray Palmer has rendered a few Latin hymns excellently. The version, “ 0 sacred
Head, now wounded,” (1840,) of a great Passion hymn, which comes to us from St. Bernard
through Paul Gerhardt, by James W. Alexander, is a masterpiece and model. Dr. Henry
Mills, of Auburn, in his Horze Germanicae (1845, second edition, enlarged, 1856) has trans-
lated one hundred and seventy-two German hymns, but not well. Dr. John Williams,
since Bishop of Connecticut, published in 1845 a small volume, now scarce, Ancient Hymns
of Holy Clement. The ﬁne paraphrase, “ Shepherd of tender youth,” of the earliest Christian
hymn (Clement of Alexandria), is believed to be American. The Hon. E. C. Benedict, Dr.
E. A. Washburne, and the Rev. S. W. Duﬂield, have translated more or less extensively from
the Latin.

PSALM AND HYMN Booxs.

The old Bay Psalm Book and the other collections used during the colonial period have
already been named. ’

The Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1789 set forth Tate and Brady, with
twenty-seven hymns. In 1808 thirty were added, and in 1827 these were enla.rged to two
hundred and twelve, while an abridgment of Tate and Brady, with a few psalms from other
sources, was supplied. This provision has been bound up with the Prayer-Book from 1827
till now. A few private selections have been put forth for use in irregular or week-night
services; and in 1865 sixty—ﬁve Additional Hymns were set forth, but they have not been
universally received. For the last few years Hymns Ancient and Modern, and some other
Collections, have been used in many parishes, subject to the Bishop’s licensure.

Among the Lutherans the ﬁrst English hymn-books were Dr. Kunze’s, 1795.; Strebeck’s,
1797; Williston’s, 1806; all published in New York. The Collection of the New York Min-
isterium (1814, enlarged, 1834) was long and widely used. That of the Tennessee Synod ap-
peared 18l5; second edition, 1888; two subsequent editions, 1850, 1857, met the local demand.
The Ohio Synod published one in 1815,‘ afterwards revised. More extensively circulated
than any of these was the General Synod’s Collection, 1828, revised 1850 and 1852. The
recent collection of the General Council, forming the chief portion of their Church Book,
(Philadelphia, 1868,) was prepared with great care, and had for its basis a larger acquaintance
with hymnic facts and materials than has generally been shown by American compilers.

The German Reformed Psalms and Hymns appeared 1834.

The Moravian collections are reproduced from English ones of the same body.

The Reformed Dutch Communion used for many years a selection of Psalms and Hymns
prepared for them in 1789 by Dr. John H. Livingstone, revised 1813, with additional hymns,
1831; enlarged and rearranged in one Volume, 1847.

386 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

The Presbyterians for a long time used, as mentioned already, Barlow’s, and then Dwignt’s,
version of Watts. In 1828 they published a collection of Psalms and Hymns, which was suc-
ceeded by other editions and compilations in 1830, 1834, and 1843. The last has been gener-
ally used by the Old School Presbyterians to this day, so far as it was not displaced by their
Hymnal, 1867. The New School Presbyterians used mostly the Church Psalmist, 1843;
Supplement, 1859. Various other collections, however, have been employed among these
two bodies; of which we may mention The Christian Psalmist, 1836; Beman’s Sacred Lyrics,
1841; Parish Psalmody, Philadelphia, 1844; W. C. Dana’s Collection, Charleston, 18_59; Dr.
Boardman’s Supplement to the Old School Psalms and Hymns, Philadelphia, 1860; Dr. C. S.
]{obinson’s Songs for the Sanctuary, New York, 1865; and The Sacriﬁce of Praise, New York,
1869. One or two new books of importance will soon appear.

For the Methodists‘ in America John Wesley prepared before his death a Sunday Service
from the Book of Common Prayer, with a Collection of Psalms and Hymns for the Lord’s
Day. It was not much used, however. Their official Pocket Hymn-Book appeared about
1802 (it had been preceded by others with similar titles), and a Supplement to it in 1810.
This was revised in 1836, and their present collection was prepared in 1849. The Southern
Methodists use a book of their own, published in 1847; and the Methodist Protestants,
Wesleyan Methodists, and other smaller sects, also have separate collections. Mr. David
Creamer of Baltimore, an eminent American hymnologist, has done much to elucidate the
Wesleyan poetry, in his Methodist Ilymnology, N. Y., 1848.

The Baptists early exhibited much compiling activity, feeling the need of revival and
camp-meeting hymns to meet the craving stimulated by Geo. Whiteﬁeld’s preaching; and
shortly before and after 1800 appeared many private collections of theirs, none of which de-
serve special mention. Winchell’s Watts, and Watts & Rippon, were both much used among
them for a time. Their oﬂicial book, The Baptist Psalmist, appeared in 1843; Supplement in
1847; The Baptist Harp, 1849; Pilgrim’s Ilarp (German), 1854; Devotional Hymn Book,
1864; Baptist Hymn Book, 1871. Various other books are more or less used by that body,
and in the South is used Wesley’s Baptist Psalmody, Charleston, 1850.

The Congregationalists have also been very active, having no official hymnal. Dwight’s
revision of Watts’s Psalms, and Worcesters Watts and Select, were largely used till 1830 or
later. The Hartford Selection (1799) went through various editions. Of more recent books
we may mention Mason & Green’s Church Psalmody, 1831 ; the Connecticut Collection, 1856;
Nason’s Congregational Hymn—Book, 1857 ; and eminently H. W. Bcecher‘s Plymouth Collec-
tion, 1855; and the Andover Sabbath Hymn-Book, 1858. The last especially is a book of
universal interest and value.

The Unitarians also have produced a great number of Hymn-books. Anticipating the split
in the Congregational body, Dr. Belknap’s Sacred Poetry, 1795, marked an era: it passed
through a number of editions. The most widely circulated subsequent books have been the
Philadelphia Selection, by Eddowes & Taylor, 1812; the New York Collection, 1820; the
Cambridge Selection, 1824; Dr. Greenwood’s, Boston, 1830; the Cheshire Association’s Chris-
tian Hymns, 1844; and S. Longfellow and S. Johnson’s Book of Hymns, 1848. These were
mainly of the old school. More modern in tone, and noticeably characteristic, are Dr. Hedge’s
and Huntington’s Hymnsfor the Church of Christ, 1853; Dr. J. F. Clarke’s Disciples’ Hymn-
Book, 1855; and Longfellow and Johnson’s Hymns of the Spirit, 1864. The last is largely
med by the extreme or Parkerite school.

The early Universalists vied in activity with the early Baptists. Their most popular Hymn-
Books are, however, of later date ; S. and R. Streeter’s Collection, 1829; that by Hosea Bal-
lou, 1837; and Adams and Cha-pin’s Hymns for Christian Devotion, 1846.

The hymnic activityof America has been somewhat unintelligent and traditional, for the
most part compiling merely from previous compilations. But a steady progression is visible
in the work of late years, and much better things than we have yet attained may be hoped
for in the future.

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 387

II. VVRITERS ON LITERATURE AND CRITICISM.

Lowell.

J AMES RUSSELL LOWELL, 1819 ——-—, excels in so many lines of effort
that it is- not easy to know in what class of writers to place him. The
Cathedral and Under’ the Willows give him rank among our foremost poets.
The Biglow .Papers show him to be inferior’ to none in humorous satire.
His latest and most consummate efforts, however, as given in the two volumes
Among My Books, and My Study Windows, seem to point to literary criti-
cism as that in which he has achieved his greatest success.

Mr. Lowell was born in Cambridge, Mass., and graduated at Harvard, in the class of 1838.
He commenced the study of law, but soon relinquished it for letters. In 1855 he succeeded
Longfellow as Professor of Belles Lettres in Harvard, a_nd this position he still holds.

Lowell’s ﬁrst poetical production that attracted attention was A Year’s Life, published in
1841. This was followed by two other volumes of poems, published in 18-14 and 1848 respec-
tively. In l8l8 appeared A Fable for Critics, a witty review in verse of the principal Ameri-
can lz'te1~atz'. In the same year there also appeared The Biglow Papers, a political satire upon
the United States at the time of the Mexican war. Subsequently, during the American civil
war, Lowell published the second series of Biglow Papers as a satirical protest against the
quasi neutrality of Great Britain.

llis more recent productions in verse are, The Cathedral, and Under the Willows.

For the ﬁrst ﬁve years of The Atlantic Monthly, Mr. Lowell was its editor. He has also

contributed to the North American and other reviews a number of literary and critical.

essays, delivered a course of warmly received lectures on the English Poets, and edited the
works of Marvell, Donne, Wordsworth, Keats, and Shelley, in Little and Brown’s series of
the British Poets. Some of the best of Lowell’s scattered essays have been recently col-
lected and published in two volumes, Among My B0oks,’and My Study Windows.

Lowell is one of those writers who have not leaped but steadily grown into favor. Each
successive work has been an improvement on its predecessor. The earliest of his publica-
tions, A Year’s Work, was criticised by Hillard as revealing in the author a lack of power of
expression, a struggling, so to speak, of the word with the thought. Certainly no one who
has read any of Lowell’s recent productions will feel disposed to repeat the objection. The
poet has attained the utmost grace and power of expression, and it almost seems as though
the word were now overmastering the thought, the poet playing with his theme.

As a satirist, Lowell has no equal in his own country, perhaps not among English writers
of the century. His satire is not broad, like that of Saxe and Holmes,but* quaint and subtle.
The Bi glow Papers,written in Yankee dialect, have one special merit. They give that dia.
lect in all its native raciness and truth, and expose the hollowness of such doggerel as Sam
f:;lick’s, which sinks down by the side of the Biglow Papers into the merest every-day vul-
garism.

Of Lowell’s serious poetry we may say. in the main, that, while strictly original, it sug-
gests to the reader a curious blending of Wordsworth’s simplicity and Tennyson’s subtlety
of thought and diction. The latter has doubtless had the larger share in inﬂuencing Lowell’s
development. Lowell’s verse has not the sweet, apparently unstudied, simplicity of Long-
fellow’s. It is somewhat too subtle for the average mind, and, as in The Cathedral, it loses
itself sometimes in mysticism.

As a critic, Lowell stands foremost among-his countrymen. Others have equalled him in
erudition, but no one has succeeded so happily in blending profound and wide study with

388 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

exquisite sympathy for the author or the work discussed. The article on Rousseau, for in-
stance, could have been written only by one who had striven long and earnestl_y to ﬁnd out,
not what Rousseau should have be.en, but what he really was. In this respect, Lowell has
followed the lead of, and been strongly inﬂuenced by, the German critics whom he at times
mentions rather slightingly. The only objection that can be urged against his literary
essays is that the author occasionally sacriﬁces an exact shade of truth for a neat point.

- The truth is stated substantially, but thrown into the background by a briiliant corruscation

of wit.
THE MORAL IN SHAKESPEARE.

I have said that it was doubtful if Shakespeare had any conscious moral intention in his
Writings. I meant only that he was purely and primarily poet. And while he was an Eng-
lish poet in the sense that is true of no other, his method was thoroughly Greek, yet with
this remarkable diiference,——-that while the Greek dramatists took purely national themes
and gave them a universal interest by their mode of treatment, he took what may be called
cosmopolitan traditions, legends of human nature, and nationalized them by the infusion of
his perfectly Anglican breadth of character and solidity of understanding. Wonderful as his
imagination and fancy are, his perspicacity and artistic discretion are more so. This coun-
try tradesman‘s son, coming up to London, could set high wits, like Beaumont, uncopiable
lessons in drawing gentlemen, such as are seen nowhere else but on the canvas of Titian : he
could take Ulysses away from Homer and expand the .shrewd and crafty islander into a
statesman whose words are the pith of history. But what makes him yet more exceptional
was his utterly uniinpeachable _judgment, and that poise of -character which enabled him to
be at once the greatest of poets, and so unnotice-able a good citizen as to leave no incidents
for biography. His material was never far-sought; (it is still disputed whether the fullest
nead of which we have record were cultivated beyond the range of grammar-school prece-
dent!) but he used it with a poetic instinct which we cannot parallel. identiﬁed himself with
it, yet remained always its born and questionless master. He ﬁnds the Clown and F001 upon
the stage, —he makes them the tools of his pleasantry, his satires, and even his pathos; he
ﬁnds a fading rustic superstition, a.nd shapes out of it ideal Pucks, Titanias, and Ariels, in
whose existence statesmen and scholars believe forever. Always poet, he subjects all to the
ends of his art, and gives in Hamlet the churchyard ghost, but with the cothurnus on,—- the
messenger of God’s revenge against murder; always philosopher, he traces in Macbeth the
lnetaphysics of apparitions, painting the shadowy Banquo only on the overwrought brain of
the murderer, and staining the hand of his wife-accomplice (because she was the more re-
ﬁned and higher nature) with the disgustful blood-spot that is not there. We say he had no
moral intention. for the reason, that as artist, it was not his to deal with the realities, but
only with the shows of things; yet, with a temperament so just, an insight so inevitable as
his, it was impossible that the moral reality which underlies the mirage of the poet’s vision,

should not always be suggested. His humor and satire are never of the destructive kind ;'

what he does in that way is suggestive only—not breaking bubbles with Thor’s ham-
mer, but puﬁing them away with the breath of a Clown, or shivering them with the light
laugh of a genial cynic. Men go about to prove the existence of a God I Was it a hit of
phosphorus, that brain whose creations are so real, that, mixed with them, we feel as it we
ourselves were but ﬂeeting magic-lantern shadows?

But higher even than the genius we rate the character of this unique man, and the grand
impersonality of what he wrote. What has he told us of himself? In our self—exploiting
nineteenth century, with its melancholy liver-complaint, how serene and high he seems!
If he had sorrows he made them the woof of everlasting consolation to his kind; and if, as
poets are wont to whine, the outward world was cold to him, its biting air did but trace
itself in loveliest frost-work of fancy on the many windows of that self-centred and cheerful
soul.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 389

Tuckerman.

HENRY THEODORE TUCKERMAN, 1813-1871, was one of the ablest, as
well as one of the most proliﬁc Of American writers on subjects connected
with criticism. He was almost equally celebrated also as a biographer and
a poet. His largest and best-known Works are, Artist Life, and Essays Bio-
graphical ' and Critical.

Mr. Tuckerman was born in Boston. He was prepared for college, but did not graduate,
his health at that time forbidding him to pursue an academic course. Under the advice of
his physicians, he was sent abroad at the age of twenty, and spent a year in Europe, chieﬂy
in Italy. Three years later he made another voyage, spending nearly ten years in Sicily
and Florence. Here he laid the foundation for that intimate acquaintance with Italian
affairs which marked his siilismpzeiit writings.

His literary labors began in 1835, with the publication of the Italian Sketch Book. This
was followed by Isabel of Sicily, a romance, published in 1839. From that time onward Mr.
Tuckerman continued to give to the world a series of successful works embodying the re-
sults Of his numerous journeyin abroad and at home and of his extensive studies.

The best known, perhaps, are Artist Life, a collection of sketches of American painters,
Thoughts on the Poets, The Optimist, a Memorial of Horace Greenough, Essays Biographical
' nd Critical, a11d the Book of the Artists, a collection of biographical and critical sketches
of American artists and art in America.

Besides these collected works, Mr. Tuckerman is also the author of a large number of
pieces scattered through the pages of the leading American magazines.

At one time Mr. Tuckerman was considered the first of American essayists. He can
scarcely be said to occupy that high position at present. Not that his style of writing degen-
erated; it is as pleasing as it ever was. But it has been surpassed in depth and originality
of thought by Whipple, and still more by Lowell. Tuckerman’s style is marked by case
and by delicate discrimination rather than by strength. It was his good fortune, and also
his merit, at a time when the interest of the American public in its literature was dornzant
or almost dormant, to reviveit, and to strengthen and foster the recollection of the early
American authors and artists, as Well as to further the claims of sound literary criticism.

Mr. Tucl<erman’s last considerable work, ﬁnished not long before his death, was a Memoir
of John Pendleton Kennedy, in 2 Vols.

Whipple.

EDWIN PERCY WHIPPLE, 1819 , is probably, next to Lowell, the
most capable as well as the most popular American critic and essayist. His
two volumes entitled Character and Characteristic Men, and his Volume on
The Literature of the Age of Elizabeth, are the publications by which he
has gained the greatest applause.

Mr. Whipple is a native of Gloucester, Mass., and since 1837 has resided in Boston. He
never attended college, but in consideration of his services to literature, he received in 1848 the
honorary degree of A. M. He was for a number of years Superintendent of the Merchants’
Exchange Reading Room in Boston. He has contributed largely to all the leading American
magazines, a.nd delivered many single lectures and courses of lectures before college and
other societies. Several collections of his essays and lectures have been published. The
best known and ablest are the two already named, Character and Characteristic Men, and
The Literature of the Age of Elizabeth. The latter, especially. is a valuable contribution to

33 *

390 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

English Letters, and gives perhaps a clearer and more graphic idea of the theme than any
other work in the language. A

Mr. Whipple’s works are widely known and appreciated. His style is easy and attractive,
and his treatment of his subjects is candid and skilful. A uniform edition of his works, ill
6 vols., has lately appeared.

Kate Field.

   

KATE FIELD,» , has published but one volume, Pen—Photo-
graphs of Dickens’s Readings, but she is very widely and favorably known
as a critic on art and literature, and as a lecturer.

Miss Field was born in St. Louis, and educated in Massachusetts, and has resided at differ-

ent times in New York, Boston, and Europe. She began writing as the Florence correspon-

dent of the Boston Courier, Boston Transcript, and New Orleans Picayune. She became better
known afterwards as the New York correspondent of the Springﬁeld Republican, under the
name of Straws, Jr. In 1867, she became connected with the New York Tribune, ﬁrst as
writer of dramatic criticisms on Ristori, and later as correspondent and writer of leading

editorials. She wrote also at the same time for the Philadelphia Press and the Chicago

Tribune. She is at present writing for Every Saturday (Boston) and the New York Tribune.

‘Her principal magazine articles have been: Memorial of Mrs. Browning; Last Days of Walter

Savage Lander; Criticism on Feehter’s Hamlet.

Mas. MARY (LOWELL) PUTNAM, a sister of James Russell Lowell, has contributed to the
North American Review and the Christian Examiner. She has also published Records of an
Obscure Man, Tragedy of Errors, and Tragedy of Success.

DELIA BACON, an American lady, published in London, in 1857, a curious book, Philosophy
of the Plays of Shakespeare Unfolded. The object of this book was to prove that the Plays,
universally attributed to Shakespeare, were really writ-ten by Lord Bacon 1 The book was
introduced with a Preface by Hawthorne.

Moses Coit Tyler.

MOSES COIT TYLER, 1835 , Professor. of the English Language and
Literature in the University of Michigan, has made some admirable contri-
butions to current literature.

Mr. Tyler was born at Griswold, Conn. The family, soon after his birth, removing to
Michigan, his boyhood was passed in Detroit. He graduated at Yale, in 1857 ; studied the«
ology at New Haven and Andover, and preached in Poughkeepsie, N. Y., from 1860 to 1862.
Then, on account of ill-health, he withdrew from the ministry ; and after spending a few
months i11 Boston for the recovery of his health under Die Lewis’s system of exercises, he
went to England, where he resided four years, engaged in teaching, lecturing, stud ying, and
writing for American periodicals, chieﬂy The Independent, and The Nation. For the latter
he contributed the article entitled American Reputations in England, which has since been
republished in the volume of “ Critical and Social Essays,” issued by the publisher of that
journal. Returning to America in the beginning of 1867, he engaged in public lecturing,
and soon after accepted the Professorship of English Language and Literature in the Uni-.-
versity of Michigan, which position he still holds.

Prof. Tyler’s publications, besides numerous articles in the newspapers, have been as fol-
lows: An Account of Vassar College; Popular Lecturing in England; The Brownville
Papers, a volume of essays on physical culture.

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 391

Prof. Tyler is now engaged in the study of American History, with a View to the produc-
tion of an elaborate History of the United States, from the close of the Revolutionary War
through the administrations of the earlier Presidents. The researches upon which he has
entered for this work are on so large a scale, however, that they will require many years for
their completion. '

EDWARD S. GOULD, 1808 , a New York merchant, has redeemed time from the pursuits
of business to make many valuable contriblitionsto literature. I Mr. Gould was born at Litch—
ﬁeld, Conn., but has lived mostly in New York city, and is known as a New Yorker. Hf
was one of the early contributors to the Knickerbocker, as a writer of tales and sketches.
Later he contributed to Charles King’s American, to the New World, the Mirror, and the
Literary World. In 1836, he delivered a Lecture, American Criticism on American Litera-
ture. I-le published translations of several of Dumas’s, Balzac’s, and Victor llugo’s works
In 1843, he published The Sleep Rider, or the Old Boy in the Omnibus. His next literary
work was an Abridgment of Alison’s History of Europe. In 1850, appeared The Very Age,
a comedy; in 1862, John Doe and Richard Roe, a story of New York city life ; in 1871, a Sup-
plement to Duyckinck’s History of the World. The work of Mr. Gould which of late years
has attracted most attention,is one published in 1867, —Good English, or Popular Errors in
Language. ‘

FRANCIS J. CHILD, LL.D., 1825 ——,'Professor of Rhetoric and Oratory in Harvard Uni-
versity, did a valuable service to American letters by his labors in superintending the
American edition of the British Poets, in 130 vols. The amount of scholarly labor displayed
in the biographical, historical, and critical notices in this edition is very great, and no small
part of it was the work of Prof. Child himself, although he had several fellow-laborers, and
it is not always easy to determine which is by him and which by others. The Spenser in 5
vols., and the Ballads in 10 vols., are exclusively his, and both are admirable specimens of
literary editing. The Ballads was evidently done with a loving hand, and remains the only
English collection that may be called complete.

Prof. Child was born in Boston, and graduated at Harvard, in the class of 1846. He was
tutor of Mathematics and afterwards of History; spent two years in Europe; and in 1851
was appointed to his present chair, that of Rhetoric and Oratory.

Richard Grant White.

 

RICHARD GRANT WHITE, 1822 , is Well known as the ablest Shakes-
pearian editor and critic that has yet appeared in America.

Mr. White is a native of New York city, and a graduate of the New York University, of
the class of 1839. He studied both medicine and law, and was admitted to the bar in 1845.
For the last twenty years he has given a large portion of time to the cultivation of letters,
and‘ his "contributions to literature have been both numerous and valuable. 8

His most important work is that which he has bestowed upon the elucidation of Shakes-
peare. His ﬁrst essay in this line was a large octavo, Shakespeare’s Scholar, in 1862, being
historical and critical studies of the text, characters, and commentators, with an examina-
tion of Mr. Collier’s Folio of 1682. This volume gave the author at once a high standing as
a Shakespeare critic. It was followed in 1859 by An Essay on the Authorship of the Three
Parts of King Henry VI. These works were preliminary to a larger one, namely, A New and
Independent Critical Edition of Shakespeare’s Works. This appeared in 1857-1865, in 12 vols.,
8vo. It is a noble monument of taste and scholarship, and contains all that any ordinary
reader Wants for studying and enjoying Shakespeare. In connection with this, butas an
independent work, appeared A Life of Shakespeare, with an essay on his genius and on the
rise of the English drama.

392 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Since closing up his Shakespeare labors, Mr. White has produced a chatty volume, of much
value, On Words and their Uses.

During the ﬁrst year of the war, some one offered a prize of $500 for the best National
Hymn. Twelve hundred poems were sent in for competition. None of them were deemed
Worthy, and the prize was not awarded. Mr. White made it the occasion of an essay, Na-
tional Hymns, How they are Written and How they are not Written, giving in illustration
some of the best and some of the worst specimens that had been put in competition. After
the close of the war, in 1866, he published another book on this subject, Poetry, Lyrical,
Narrative, and Satirical of the Civil War.

Mr. White has written at different times for the Courier and Inquirer, The World, the
Galaxy, Putnam’s, and the Atlantic Monthly, and for other magazines and papers.

REV. HENRY NORMAN HUDSON, 1814 , is a native of Cornwall, Vt. He graduated at
Middlebury College in 1840. After spending some years as a public lecturer on Shakespeare,
he became a clergyman in the Protestant Episcopal Church. He has published Lectures
on Shakespeare in 2 vols., and also A Critical Edition of Shakespeare, in 11 vols.

“ Mr. Hudson has enriched the literature of our language with the fruits of his studies,
mastering the diﬁiculties of the poet with wonderful ingenuity, seizing the spirit of his char-
acterization with kindred subtlety, and, in a singularly nervous and racy style, presenting
some of the ﬁnest specimens of critical analysis of which any modern writer can boast." —-
New Quarterly Review,

 

JOSIAH PHILLIPS QUINCY, 1830 ——, a grandson of President Quincy, was born in Boston,
and graduated at Cambridge, in the class of 1850. He has published M£t1]11SCl‘lpt Corrections
from a Copy of the Fourth Folio of Shakespeare; Lyteria, a Dramatic Poem ; and Charicles,
a. Dramatic Poem.

Professor Corson.

HIRAM CORSON, 1828 , Professor of the English jpanguage and
Literature in Cornell University, has made several valuable contributions
to the department of English scholarship. He is also one of the ablest
lecturers in the country, on the subj ect of English Literature.

Prof. Corson was born in Philadelphia. From 1849 to 1856, he was connected with the
Library of the Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, then in charge of the accomplished
scholar and bibliographer, Prof. Charles C. J ewett, under whose guidance, and in the prep-
aration of the catalogues of the Libraries of Congress and of the Smithsonian Institution, in
accordance with the plan originated by Prof. J ewett for the stereotyping of a general alpha-
betical catalogue of the Libraries of the United States, Mr. Corson made a careful study of
Bibliography and the management of Libraries. The removal of Prof. J ewett from the
Smithsonian Institution caused the grand catalogue scheme to fall through, and Mr. Corson
was obliged to resort to teaching, in which he had already had considerable experience as a
private tutor and as an assistant teacher in the Treemount Seminary at Norristown, Pa., of
which the Rev. Samuel Aaron, D.D., was principal.

In 1859, Mr. Corson removed with his family to Philadelphia, and for some years devoted
himself‘ to teaching and lecturing on English Literature. In l865, he was elected Professor
of History and Rhetoric in Crirard College, which position he resigned in l866, to accept the
Professorship of Rhetoric and of the English Language and Literature, in St. J ohn’s College,
Annapolis. In 1870, he was elected to the chair of the English Language and Literature,
Rhetoric and Oratory, in The Cornell University, which position he still holds.

8 Prof. Corson has published the following works: Chaucer’s Legende of Geode Women,

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 393

containing an elaborate introduction on the Versiﬁcation of Chaucer, and copious Glossarial
and Critical Notes showing a wide range of early English reading; An Elocutionary Manual,
with an Introductory Essay on the study of Literature and the relations of Vocal Culture to
an Jllsthetic Appreciation of Poetry; Address on the occasion of his Induction as Professor
in Gir:_1.r<l College ; Hand-Book of Anglo-Saxon and Early English. The work last named is
one of uncommon excellence and value.

All of Prof. Corson’s publications are remarkable for thoroughness and scholarship. I-Iis
edition of Chaucer’s Legende of Geode Women is a masterpiece in its way. Prof. Corson
has prepared, with immense labor, a Thesaurus of Early English, containing a complete
verbal and glossarial index of the Canterbury Tales, Piers Ploughman, Gower’s Confessio
Amantis, Wyckliffe’s Bible, Spenser, and Chapman’s Homer. The work awaits a publisher.

ARTHUR. GILMAN, A. M., 1837 ——, was born at Alton, Ill., and educated in New York
city, and at an early age entered upon commercial life. The conﬁnement of business under-
mining his health, he removed to Berkshire, Mass., where he was identiﬁed with the move-
ments in favor of religion and education, and at the same time pursued his favorite literary
studies. In 1869, he published A Genealogy of the Gilman Family; and in 1870, First Steps
in English Literature. The latter is an admirable manual, and has already passed through
several editions. Mr. Gilman has contributed to Appleton’s Journal, Putnam‘s Magazine,
Our Young Folks, The Riverside Magazine, and the American Educational Monthly. In 1871,
he became the editor of the books and papers of the American Tract Society, Boston.

Duyckinck Brothers.

The brothers Duyckinok have bestowed a lasting beneﬁt upon American
letters by their invaluable Work, The Encyclopeedia of American Literature.
This work, in two large volumes, double-column octavo, is modelled after
Chambers’s Encyclopaedia of English Literature, but for thoroughness and
every other desirable quality is superior to Chambers’s. The Duyckincks’
work may be supplemented (the continual and rapid growth of our litera-
ture requires this), but it can never be superseded. It is the best, in fact
the only, comprehensive and adequate exposition of American literature to
the date of its publication, 1856.

EVART AUGUSTUS DUYCKINCK, 1816 ——, the older of the brothers, was also the chief
laborer in the production of the Cyclopaedia. In‘1840, he began, in connection with Corne-
lius Mathews, Arcturus, a journal of books- and opinions, which continued two or three
years. In 1847, he began, with his brother George, the Literary World, which continued
about seven years. The Encyclopmdia, the joint Work of the brothers, was completed in
1856. Evart published a supplement to it in 1866. Among his other publications are: Wit
and Wisdom of Sydney Smith; History of the War for the Union, 3 vols., 1865; Memoir of
Francis L. Hawks; Memorial of John Allan, etc.

GEORGE LONG DUYCKINCK, 1823-1863, graduated at the New York University in 1843. He
studied law, but never practised. Besides his work in the Encyclopaedia and the Literary
Wo1'ld, he published Lives of George Herbert, Bishop Ken, a11d Jeremy Taylor, and numer-
ous essays and reviews.

Both brothers were born in New York, sons of the well-known publisher, Evart Duyckinck.
1705--1833.

SM AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Allibone.

 

SAMUEL AUSTIN ALLIBONE, LL. D., 1816 , has made the entire
literary world his debtors by his great Work, the Dictionary of Authors.

Dr. Allibone is a native and resident of Philadelphia. He is known almost exclusively by
his one work, A Critical Dictionary of English Literature and of British and American
Authors, in 3 vols., large 8vo, ﬁlling 3,140 closely printed pages, and containing over 46,000
authors, with 40 Indexes of subjects. The plan is to. give a short life of each author, accom-
panied by a list of his publications, and extracts from the opinions of the best critics in re-
gard to his standing and character. The work abounds also in literary anecdotes and curious
information of an authentic character in regard to authors and authorship. As a mine of
information on the subject of which it treats, it is unparalleled. By solitary and single-
handed labor, protracted through twenty years, the author has achieved a work such as or-
dinarily is accomplished only by the joint effort of a large number of laborers working in
concert; and the result is a monument of patient and productive industry which has few
parallels in literary history. Besides this great work, Dr. Allibone has lately prepared an
excellent text-book for Sunday-Schools. called The Union Bible Companion.

Dr. Allibone has been Secretary and Editor of the American Sunday-School Union since
the decease of Mr. Packard. A

James Wood Davidson.

 

PROF. JAMES WOOD DAVIDSON, 1829 , has done a signal service to
letters by his exceedingly interesting. and able work, The Living VVriters
of the South. This work, in its 635 well-ﬁlled pages, contains an amount
and kind of information on the subject of which it treats that is nowhere
else to be obtained.

Professor Davidson was born in the County —then District —-of Newberry, S. C. He was
educated at the South Carolina College at Columbia, graduating with high distinction in
1852. He early manifested a devotion to literature, and while in college spent his vacations
reading in the College Library.

From 1854 until 1859 he was Professor of Greek in the Mount Zion College, at Winnsboro’,
S. C. From 1859 until the progress of the war suspended the institution, he was a joint-
principal of the Carolina High School in Columbia.

In connection with ‘Greek he studied Romaic. He reads French; and has some knowledge
of Spanish and Italian.

During a portion of the war he was an oﬂicer in the Confederate Army under Lee in
Virginia.

Since the war, he has taught school in Columbia, mainly in the Columbia Male Academy,
where he taught the Latin and Greek classics. ~

Professor Davidson has published two books: A School History of South Carolina, a

manual for schools, extending the history from the discovery of the State down to 1869; .

The Living Writers of the South, 635 pages. He has in preparation A Dictionary of Southern
Authors, to embrace both sexes, all races, and the living and dead; also a work illustrative
of life in the Homeric times, entitled Helene, [Helen of Troy,] something after the manner
of Becker’s Charicles. He has written also for a large number of periodicals both North and
South, principally the latter. He has twice appeared as a lecturer before lyceums.
Professor Davidson holds the idea of art that its utmost limit is Nature; and hence that
creative art is false when it transcends that limit, even in symbolism. Hence Madonnas on

moons are absurd; and angels with wings, Washingtons in togas, and narratives of conver-
sation on ocean-wrecks that reach no land, ——are all false art.
He is at present a resident of Washington, D. C.

MRS. MARY T. TARDY, —— -——, of Mobile, Ala., under the name of “ Ida Raymond,“ has
published a work, in two large volumes, entitled Southland Writers. It is limited to those
of her own sex, and is very full and particular in its information, most of it. from original
sources. She gives also ample quotations. The work has been well received. She has
written also Living Female Writers of the South.

III. MAGAZINISTS.

Oliver Wendell Holmes.

OLIVER WENDELL HoLMEs, M. D., 1809 , likemany others named
in the present chapter, excels in several departments. He is by profession
a medical lecturer, and ranks high as a Writer on medical science, producing
on one occasion three prize dissertations in two successive years. He has
Won great praise also as a poet. But his greatest and most enduring fame,
undoubtedly, is that acquired as a writer of magazine articles. Were there
a laureate for this line of art, as there is for poetry, Holmes beyond all
question would Wear the bays. N o living magazinist, English or American,
can equal him. His Autocrat at the Breakfast Table and its successors, are
fully up to the N octes Ambrosianae of Blackwood when Wilson was in his
prime.

Dr. Holmes, son of Abiel Holmes, mentioned elsewhere in this volume, was born and edu-
:ated at Cambridge, graduating in 1829. He studied medicine abroad nearly three years. In
i838 he was elected Professor of Anatomy in Dartmouth College; in 1847, was appointed to
the same chair in Harvard, as successor to Dr. Warren. ' .

Dr. Holmes’s literary productions are so well known that the present notice of them need
not be otherwise than very brief. His principal earlier poems are Poetry, Terpsichore, and
Urania. Since these he has published a number of short lyric pieces, either detached or
embodied in his prose Writings. As a prosaist, he has rendered himself famous by his Au-
tocrat of the Breakfast Table, his Professor at the Breakfast Table, Elsie Venner, and The
Guardian Angel. ' ' -

In both his prose and his verse, he exhibits a strange blending of the humorous, witty,
and sentimental, an accurate, although scarcely a profound, knowledge of character, a per-
fect command of words, and a most genial vigor of expression. No other An1eric:m writer,
perhaps, has so cheered and stimulated his public. His Autocrat of the Breakfast Table, in
the pages of the Atlantic, came like the dawning of a new era, and contributed more than
any one other cause to the success of that periodical. Among IIolmes’s poems it is almost
impossible to make a choice — they are so much alike, and so equally good.

“The ‘Autocrat’ is as genial and gentle, and withal, as philosophical an essayist as any
of modern times. Hazlitt, saturnine and cynical, would yet have loved this Writer. Charles
Lamb would have opened his heart to one who resembles him so much in many excellent
points. Leigh Hunt, we dare say, has been much delighted with him. Thomas Hood, the
great humanitarian, would have relished his ﬁne catholic spirit. Dickens, no doubt, has
read him more than once, admiring his command of our common language, — the ‘ well of
English undeﬁled,’ —and, above all, the pervading tone of practical philosophy. The ‘ Auto-

398 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

crat,’ however, is somewhat more than an essayist; he is contemplative, discursive, poetical,
thoughtful, philosophical, amusing, imaginative, tender, —-never didactic. This is the secret
of his marked success; he interests variously constituted minds and various moods of minds.
It needed not the introduction of lyrical pieces (which we are glad to have) to show that the
“ Autocrat ’ is essentially a poet. Of all who would have most enjoyed him, we may foremost
name Professor Wilson, who would have welcomed him to a seat ‘above the salt’ at the far-
famed ’Noctes Ambrosianze,’ placing him next to William Maginn, the wayward ‘O’Do-=
herty ’ of Blackwood’s Magazine.’’—-- 1?. S’/zclton Zllackenzie.

“ As he is everybody’s favorite, there is no occasion for critics to meddle with him, either
to censure or to praise. He can afford to laugh at the whole reviewing fraternity. His wit
is all his own, so sly and tingling, but witl1_gut a drop of ill-nature in it, and never leaving
a sting behind. His humor is so grotesque and queer, that it reminds one of the frolics of
Puck; and deep pathos mingles with it so naturally, that, when the reader’s eyes are brim-
ming with tears, he knows not whether they have their source in sorrow or in laughter.” -
Frcmcis Bowen, in North American Review.

“If any of your readers (and at times we fear it is the case with all) need amusement, and
the wholesome alterative of a hearty laugh, we commend them not to Dr. Holmes the phy-
sician, but to Dr. Holmes the scholar, the wit, and the humorist; not to the scientiﬁc medi
cal professor’s barbarous Latin, but to his practical prescriptions given in choice old Saxon.
We have tried them, and are ready to give the doctor certiﬁcates of their eﬂicacy. . . . .
Long may he live, to make broader the face of our care-ridden generation, and to realize for
himself the truth of the wise man’s declaration that a merry heart is ‘ a continual feast.’ ”—
John G. Whittier. ‘

BILL AND JOE.

Come, dear old comrade, you an.d I

Will steal an hour from days gone by-—
The shining days when life was new,
And all was bright as morning dew,
The lusty days of long ago,

When you were Bill and I was Joe.

Your name may ﬂaunt a titled trail,
Proud as a cockerel’s rainbow tail;
And mine as brief appendix wear
As Tam O’Shanter’s luckless mare;
Cl‘o—day, old friend, remember still
That I am Joe -and you are Bill.

You’ve won the great world’s envied prize,
And grand you look in people’s eyes,
VVith H O N., and L L. D.,

In big brave letters, fair to see—-

Your ﬁst, old fellow! Off they go!

How are you, Bill? How are you, Joe?

You ’ve worn the judge’s ermine robe;
You’ve taught your name to half the globe’;
You’ve sung mankind a deathless strain;
You ’ve made the dead past live again:

The world may call you what it will,

But you and I are Joe and Bill.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 397

The chafﬁng young folks stare and say,

“See those old buffers, bent and gray;
They talk like fellows in their teens;
Mad, poor old boys! ‘That’s What it means”-
And shake th_eir heads; they little know
The throbbing hearts of Bill and Joe-

How Bill forgets his hour of pride,
VVhi1e Joe sits smiling at his side;

How Joe, in spite of time’s disguise,
Finds the old schoolmate in his eyes-
Those cahn, stern eyes that melt and ﬁll,
As Joe looks fondly up at Bill.

Ah! pensive scholar, what is fame?

A ﬁtful tongue of leaping ﬂame;

A giddy whirlwind’s ﬁckle gust,

That lifts a pinch of mortal dust:

A few swift years, and who can show
VVhich dust was Bill, and which was Joe.

The weary idol takes his stand,

Holds out his bruised and aching hand,
While ‘gaping thousands come and.sgo—
How vain it seems, this empty show!-
Till all at once his pulses thrill:

’Tis poor old Joe’s “God bless you, Bill!”

And shall we breathe in happier spheres
The names that pleased our mortal cars,
In some sweet lull of harp and song,
For earth-born spirits none too long,
Just whispering of the world below,
Where this was Bill, and that was Joe?

No matter; while our home is here,

No sounding name is half so dear;

VVhen fades at length our lingering day,
Who cares what pompous tombstones say?
Read on the hearts that love us still,

H750 jacet Joe. Hie jacet Bill.

James Parton

 

JAMES PARTON, 1822 , is a magazinist of the ﬁrst order, although
he has not the exuberant wit and fancy which in conjunction with the
more solid qualities make Holmes supreme. Mr. Parton is, perhaps, the
only American author who has made magazine-writing a profession. He
has pursued it for a long series of years with continued and undivided
devotion, and his success has been commensurate with his zeal.

Mr. Parton, though a native of England, came to the United States when only four years
34

old, and he has spent nearly his whole life in New York city. He has devoted himself to
the profession of letters, Writing chieﬂy for the Monthly Magazines.

No magazinist of the day writes more readable articles. His judgment, however, is not
always equal to his faculty of making a subject interesting, so that his opinions are received
with some distrust, though he is always‘ sure of an audience. He has a vigorous imagina-
tion, apprehends with wonderful clearness what he wants to say, and says it in such a way
that it is diﬂicult not to take his meaning; and withal he has an instinctive Sagacity for
knowing what points in any given subject are likely to interest the general reader. He
usually writes long articles, yet he is never dull; he makes even statistics entertaining.

Mr. Parton’s separate volumes are mostly biographies, while his magazine articles are
usually special studies of the current topics of the day. He has published extended Biog-
raphies of Horace Greeley, Aaron Burr, Andrew Jackson, Benjamin Franklin, John Jacob
Astor, and Thomas Jefferson; Famous Americans of Recent Times, containing sketches of
Clay, Webster, Calhoun, Randolph, Girard, Vanderbilt, James Gordon Bennett, Goodyear,
Beecher, etc.; People’s Book of Biography, or Short Lives of the Most Interesting Persons
of All Ages and Countries. Some of his other publications are, Smoking and Drinking;
Triumphs of Enterprise, Ingenuity, and Public Spirit; General Butler in New Orleans; How
New York City is Governed; Manual for the Instruction of “Rings,” Railroad and Political;
The Humorous Poetry of the English Language from Chaucer to Saxe.

Mrs. Parton,——“Fanny Fern.”

MRS. SARAH PAYSON (WILLIS) PARTON, 1811-1872, under the name of
“Fanny Fern,” acquired, and has for a long series of years maintained, a
reputation almost unique as a writer of short, spicy articles on topics of the
day. Her contributions are limited to the New York Ledger.

Mrs. Parton Was a native of Portland, Maine, and a sister of the late N. P. Willis. She was
married in 1834 to Mr. Charles H. Eldredge, of Boston. On his death, in 1846, she was sud-
denly reduced from a life of aﬂluence to the necessity of labor for the support of herself and
a family of young children. In this emergency, she betook herself to her pen, and began
Writing for the public journals, under the assumed name of Fanny Fern. She had at first
the usual bitter experiences of the novitiate in the life of authorship, having to run the
gauntlet not only of indifference and neglect, but of impertinence, superciliousness, and idle
curiosity, receiving often the rnerest pittance for brain-work which had cost an agony of
labor, yet receiving it thankfully, because the wolf was at the door.

She bravely persevered against all discouragements, learning her trade while practising
it, and gradually ﬁghting her way into public favor.

The first distinct recognition of her extraordinary merit came from Mr. Bonner, of the
New York Ledger, who boldly engaged her .to write a story for that paper at the extraordi-
nary price of a hundred dollars a column, and was so well pleased with his bargain that he
contracted with her to write for him, on the same terms, a weekly artic1e,vWhich she con-
tinued to do for eighteen years, without ever missing for a single week.

These sprightly essays have been worked up, from time to time, into volumes with fancy
names, and have had a large sale in this separate form, besides the enormous circulation
which they have had in the Ledger. The names of these books are Fern Leaves, First and
Second Series; Fresh Leaves; Little Ferns for Fanny’s Little Friends ; The Play Book;
Folly as it Flies; and Ginger Snaps.

About the time of her engagement with Mr. Bonner, she published, in quick succession,
two novels, Ruth Hall, and Rosa Clark, which made a great sensation, and sold largely. -It
was thought at that time that she would become a regular novelist. But the short, pithy
essay is evidently her forte, and she has wisely adhered to it.

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 399

THE FASHIONABLE PREACHER.

Do you call this a church? Well, I heard a prima-donna here a few nights ago: and
bright eyes sparkled, and waving ringlets kept time to moving fans; and opera-glasses and
ogling, and fashionand folly reigned for the nonce triumphant. I can’t forget it; I can’t
get up any devotion here, under these latticed balconies, with their fashionable freight. If
it were a good old country church, with a cracked bell and unhewn rafters, a pine pulpit,
with the honest sun staring in through the windows, a pitch-pipe in the_ gallery, and a few
hob-nailed rustics scattered round in the uncushioned seats,‘I should feel all right; but my
soul is in fetters here; it Won’t soar—its wings are ‘earth-clipped. Things are all too ﬁne!
Nobody can come in at that door, whose hat and coat and bonnet are not fashionably cut.
The poor man (minus a Sunday suit) might lean on his staif, in the porch, a long while,
before he ’d dare venture in, to pick up his crumb of the Bread of Life. But, thank God, the
unspoken prayer of penitence niay wing its way to the Eternal Throne, though our mocking
church-spires point only with cm’-stocratv;cfmgers to the rich man’s heaven.

—That hymn was beautifully read; there’s poetry in the preacher’s soul. Now he takes

‘his seat by the reading-desk; now he crosses the platform, and offers his hymn-book to a

female who has just entered. What right has he to know there is a woman in the house?
’Tis n’t clerical ! Let the bonnets ﬁnd their own hymns.

Well, I take a listening attitude, and try to believe I am in church. I hear a great many
original, a great many sta1'tl1.'ng things said. I see the gauntlet thrown at the dear old
orthodox sentiments which I nursed in with my mother's milk, and which (please God) I’ll
cling to till I die. I see the polished blade of satire glittering in the air, followed by curious,
eager, youthful eyes, which gladly see the searching “sword of the Spirit ” parried.. Meaning
glances, smothered smiles, approving nods follow the witty clerical sally. The orator pauses
to mark the effect, and his face says, That. stroke tells! and so it did, for “ the Athenians ”
are not all dead. who “ love to see and hear some new thing.” But he has another arrow in
his quiver. Now his features soften —his voice is low and thrilling, his imagery beautiful
and touching. He speaks of human love; he touches skilfully a chord to which every heart
vibrates; and stern manhood is struggling with his tears, ere his smiles are chased away.

Oh, there’s intellect there — there ’s poetry there -— there ’s genius there; but I remember

‘Gethsemane—I forget not Calvary! I know the‘ “rocks were rent,” and “the heavens

darkened,” and “ the stone rolled away; ” and a cold chill strikes to_my heart when I hear
“Jesus of Nazareth” lightly mentioned. .
. Oh, what are intellect, and poetry, and genius, when with Jewish voice they cry, “Away
with HIM! ”
With “ Mary,” let me “bathe his feet with my tears, and wipe them with the hairs of my
head.”
And so, I “ went away sorrowful," that this human preacher, with such great intellectual
possessions, should yet “lack the one thing needful."

THE BABY’S COMPLAINT.

Now, I suppose you think, because you never see me do anything but feed and sleep, that I
have a very ﬁne time of it. Let me tell you that you are mistaken, and that I am tormented
half to death, although I never say anything about it. How should you like every morn-
ing to have your nose washed up, instead of down? How should you like to liave a pin put
through your dress into your skin, and have to bear it all day till your clothes were taken
oil‘ at night‘.{ How should you like to be held so near the fire that your eyes were half
scorched out of your head, while your nurse was reading a novel? How should you like to
have a great ﬂy light on your nose, and not know how to take aim at him, with -your little,
fat, useless ﬁngers? How should you like to be left alone in the room to take a nap, and have
a great pussy jump into your cradle, and sit staring at you with her great green eyes, till
you were all of a tremble? How should you like to reach out your hand for the pretty bright

candle, and ﬁnd out that it was away across the room, instead of close by? How should
you like to tire yourself out crawling way across the carpet, to pick up a pretty button or
pin, and have it snatched away as soon as you begin to enjoy it? I tell you it is enough to
ruin any baby’s temper. How should you like to have your mamma stay at a party till you
were as hungry as a little cub, and be left to the mercy of nurse, who trotted you up and
down till every bone in-your body ached? How should you like, when your mamma dressed
you up all pretty to take the nice, fresh air, to spend the afternoon with your nurse in some
smoky kitchen, while she gossiped with one of her cronies? How should you like to
submit to have your toes tickled by all the little children who insisted upon “seeing the
baby’s feet”? How should you like to have a dreadful pain under your apron, and have
everybody call you “a little cross thing,” when you could n’t speak to tell what was the
matter with you? How should you like to crawl to the top stair (just to look about a little),
and pitch heels over head from the top to the bottom? ,

Oh. I can tell you it is no joke to be a babyl Such a thinking as we keep up; and if we
try to ﬁnd out anything, we are sure to get our brains knocked out in the attempt. It is
very trying to a sensible baby, who is in a hurry to know everything, and can’t wait to
grow up.

Mary Abigail Dodge_,——“ Gail Hamilton.”

MARY ABIGAIL DODGE, 1838 , known as “Gail Hamilton,” is one
of the most brilliant contributors to current literature. Her contributions
usually appear ﬁrst in the weekly or monthly magazines, and afterwards
are collected into volumes.

Miss Dodge “was born at Hamilton, Mass., about 1838. Her father was a farmer. She
taught school in Hartford, Conn, and was afterwards governess in the family of Dr. Gamaliel
Bailey, of VVashington, D. C., to whose paper (National Era) she was a contributor.”——D9'cLL'e’s
Dict. of Amer. Bz'og1'ap7z3/. Miss Dodge’s assumed name is said to be made up of “ Hamilton,”
the place of her residence, and “ -gall,” the last syllable of her middle name. The magazines
to which chieﬂy she has contributed are the Atlantic Monthly and H-a.rper’s Bazar. Iler
books are the following: A New Atmosphere, or the Whole Duty of Man ; Gala Da.ys; Coun-
try Living; Woman’s Wrongs; Skirmishes and Sketches; Red Letter Days; Wool Gather-
ing ; . Summer Rest; Stumbling-Blocks ; Battle of the Books ; Woman’s Worth and Worth-
lessness. '

George W. Curtis.

GEORGE VVILLIAM CURTIS, 1824 , is known all over the land, and
for that matter pretty much all over the world, or at least wherever the
English language is spoken, by his Writings in the three great magazines
published by the Harpers. He is the political editor of the VVeekly, ﬁlls
the Easy Chair of the Monthly, and writes Manners upon the Road for the
Bazar. His Writings in these periodicals, as any one may see by a glance
at the annual table of contents, would ﬁll at least a score of Volumes.

Mr. Curtis was born in Providence, R. I., and was educated chieﬂy at Jamaica Plains, Mass.
At the age of ﬁfteen he entered a counting-house in New York. In 1842, he joined the
famous Brook Farm Association, VVest Roxbury, Mass., where he remained eighteen months,
and afterwards was engaged for an equal time on a kindred enterprise at Concord, in con-
nection with Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Ralph VValdo Emerson. In 1846 he went to Europe,

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 401

and a.fter a year spent in Italy, entered the University of Berlin, and witnessed the revolu-
tionary scenes there in 1848. The two following years were spent in travel, chieﬂy in Syria.
and Egypt. In 1850 he returned to America, and joined tl1e editorial staff of the New York
Tribune. He was one of the original editors of Putnam, and sunk his entire private fortune
in trying to save its creditors from loss by the failure of the publishers. In 1853 he began
as a lyceum lecturer, in which kind of labor his success has been marked and uniform. In
1856 he enlisted with great zeal as a public speaker in advocacy of the Republican party.
In 1858 he advocated in many places the rights of women, in a lecture entitled Fair Play for
‘women. He has delivered for several years a course of lectures on English Literature at
Cornell University. .
Mr. Curtis‘s separate publications have been the following: Nile Notes of a I-Iowadji; The
Ilowadji in Syria; Lotus-Eating; The Potiphar Papers; Prue and I; Trumps. He edited
also Downing’s Rural Essays with a Biography, and has published several public addresses.

W. D. Howells.

WILLIAM DEANE HOWELLS, 1837 , editor of the Atlantic Monthly,
like a good many others of the craft, began his career as a practical printer,
and has worked his way up to his present distinguished position by dint of
labor and brains.

Mr. Howells was born at Martin’s Ferry, 0., of VVelsh parentage on the father’s side, and
of Pennsylvania-German on the side of the mother. Without the advantages of early leisure
or of liberal education, he yet managed, by rr “ding and study out of work—hours, to educate
himself, and at a comparatively early age, has won for himself a distinguished place in the
ﬁeld of letters.

Mr. Howells learned the printing business in his father’s oﬂices at Hamilton and Dayton,
0., and worked pretty steadily “at case ” from his twelfth to his nineteenth year. He then
became Legislative correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette from Columbus, and two years
later news editor of the Ohio State Journal. He began to contribute to the Atlantic Monthly
in 1860. In 1861, he was appointed United States consul at Venice, where he remained
until July, 1865, when he resigned the position and returned to the United States. After
an engagement of a few months upon The Nation, New York, he received from Mr. Fields,
March, 1866, an invitation to be assistant editor of the Atlantic Monthly, and on the 1st of
July, 1871, he became editor-in-chief of that important magazine. He resides a.t Cambridge.

Mr. Howells’s publications thus far are the following: Poems of Two Friends (W. D.
Howells and'J. J. Piatt); No Love Lost, a Romance of Travel, in hexamcter verse; Life of
Abraham Lincoln ; Venetian Life; Italian Journeys; and Suburban Sketches.

“ Mr. Howells’s new volume (Suburban Sketches) will conﬁrm and extend the fame he had.‘

already acquired by the singular delicacy of his genius, and the respect which he shows for
it in the fastidious purity of his style. It is wonderfully easy reading, because it is graded
with such consummate skill. But there is profound feeling here, and humor so subtle, so
evanescent, that it suggests itself by indications, as it were, and dominates all our associa-
tions like a faint perfume that is and is not, and yet possesses us wholly with its indeﬁnable
cha.rm.”—J. R. Lowell, in the JV. Am. Revzew.

“ If there are diﬁiculties, and few will deny that they are almost insurmountable, in writ-
ing a book about Venice, it must be confessed that Mr. Howells deserves all the reputation
which can ﬂow from overcoming them. His book does not revel in new descriptions of
thrice-described palaces, and is not inordinately stuffed out with half-digested scraps of
Venetian history. The picturesque streets, the balmy and caressing atmosphere are con-
stantly felt, and afford an ever-present local tone to all he writes of a place he had lived in

long enough to love with the love of knowledge. And not the place only, but the people as
they live at the present day. Indeed, it is the people, and Venetian society that offered
themselves to him as the supremely interesting things. This point of View is one which is
ever present in the minds of intelligent Americans, and gives to their marks a freshness
and apparent originality, which we seldom ﬁnd except in the very highest class of European
travellers.” — l/Vestmz'nster Review. I

“ There is in it [Suburban Sketches] such reﬁnement of thought, such depth and subtilty
of humor, and such graceful elegance and artistic beauty of style, as makes us recognize
with grateful pleasure that we have in America, to use the words of another, a prose writer
‘ worthy to be ranked with Hawthorne in sensitiveness of observation, and with Longfellow
in perfection of style.’ ” —-The Oatizolic World.

Col. T. W. Higginson.

CoLoNEL THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON, 1823 , has been a
favorite contributor to the Atlantic Monthly. His volumes, Out-Door
Papers, Malbone an Oldport Romance, and others, made up of magazine
articles, are held in high esteem.

Colonel Higginson was born and educated in Cambridge, Mass., where his father was stew-
ard of the University. He is descended from a long line of colonialministers, writers, magis-
trates, and Indian ﬁghters, so that he comes honestly ‘by the writing and ﬁghting propensi-
ties which have been so strongly developed in his career. It is worthy of note, in the same
connection, that he is own cousin to Dr. Sty ahen H. Tyng and to Rev. W. H. Channing,
Chaplain of United States House of Representatives during the late war.

Colonel Higginson was graduated in 1841, ranking second in a class of forty-ﬁve. After
teaching for some years, and studying theology in the Divinity School of Cambridge, he was
ordained, in 1847, minister of the First Religious Society at Newburyport, Mass. His anti-
slavery opinions, which were very pronounced, .not being acceptable to the people there, he
went in 1852 to the Free Church at Worcester, and in 1858 he retired from the ministry
altogether, for the purpose of devoting himself to literary pursuits. Since that time, he has
followed literature as a profession, with the exception only of some interruptions caused by
the war. 4

Colonel Higginson took an active part in the late war, the principal ﬁeld of his operations
being in South Carolina and Florida. He was for two years in command of a regiment there,
and in one of his expeditions he was seriously wounded, and obliged in consequence to
resign.

Colonel Higginson was married, in 1847, to Mary E. Channing, daughter of Walter Chan-
ning, M. D., of Boston. He lives at Newport, R. I.

The following are his principal publications : Out-Door Papers ; Malbone, an Oldport
Romance, reprinted in London; Army Life iii a Black Regiment; Atlantic Essays. He has
edited the following: Thalatta, a Book of Poetry for the Sea-Side, edited in connection with
Samuel Longfellow; The Works of Epictetus, a new translation, based on that of Elizabeth
Carter; Harvard Memorial Biographies, 2 vols., 8vo. He has also written a large number
of pamphlets and magazine articles, the latter being chieﬂy for the Atlantic Monthly. He
wrote the articles on Margaret Fuller Ossoli, and Lydia Maria Child, for “The Eminent
Women of the Age”; and the Memoir of Dr. Thaddeus William Harris, which is prefaced
to his Entomological Correspondence. '

For Redpath’s Life of John Brown he furnished a Sketch of a visit to the family of Captain
_Brow11 just before his execution, which is pronounced by R. H. Dana, Jr., “an unsurpassed
narrative.” His latest publication is an Essayon “ The Sympathy of Religions,” marked by

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT'TIME. 403

much research,_of which Rev. Dr. Dewey says, “In the style, and in the study of the subject
which it shows, it is admirable enough to make a reputation.” _
John G. Saxe wrote of Malbone: “As a romance, it seems to us the most brilliant that has
appeared in this country since Hawthorne (whom the author in some points has the happi-
ness to resemble) laid down the most fascinating pen ever held by an American author.”

J. T. Trovvbridge.

JOHN TOWNSEND TROWBRIDGE, 1827 , a favorite contributor to the
Atlantic Monthly and the Young Folks, and at present editor of the latter
magazine, is known also as the author of the popular poem called The
Vagabonds, and of numerous popular tales and novels.

‘ John Townsend Trowbridge, 1827 -——, is a native of the town of Ogden, in Western New
York. At the time of his birth, the country around was a wilderness, and he had the usual
sharp experiences of pioneer life. After roughing it for a few years, and vainly trying to
make a farmer of himself, the plough and he formally dissolved partnership ; and, with only
the limited advantages of early education to be had from a country school, he plunged at
once fearlessly into a life of authorship. At the age of nineteen he went to New York, and
began to write for anybody that would buy his wares, and for any price that he could get,——-
a dollar a page being considered liberal. After struggling for a few years in this way, often
reduced to his last loaf, which he carried under his arm 11p four ﬂights of stairs and ate
bravely in the solitude of his chamber, and part of the time eking out his scanty means by
engraving pencil-cases for a manufacturer in Jersey city, the young author at length pushed

his way to Boston, as a more promising market for such things as he had to sell. The very .

hardships that he had encountered gave him faith and muscle, and he began after a while to
ﬁnd himself in demand. His ﬁrst efforts in Boston were a series of tales under the signa-
ture of Paul Cr-eyton. His ﬁrst book was Father Brighthopes. It was a decided success, and
led to others of a like character. Martin Merivale, His >4 Mark, appeared in 1854, but with
only a limited success. In 1855, he went to Europe and spent a year abroad, mostly in
France and Italy. While there, he Wrote Neighbor Jackwood, a powerful work of ﬁction, in
which the common phases of country life are faithfully portrayed. The story was drama-
tized by the author, and brought out in Boston, New York, and elsewhere. Cudjoe’s Cave,
a novel of the war, came out in 1863, and had a large sale.

Mr. Trowbridge was one of the original contributors to the Atlantic Monthly, and a large
part of his Works have appeared ﬁrst in that magazine. He has also been connected with
The Young Folks from the start, and latterly he has been its managing editor.

The Vagabonds, his most striking and original poem, ﬁrst appeared in the Atlantic, in
1863. No American poem, of the same size, has made a more profound impression, or has
been more frequently read or recited in public exhibitions of every kind.

The following list embraces most of his publications: The Brighthope Series, (viz., Father
Brighthopes, Hearts and Faces, Burcliff, Iron Thorpe the Pioneer Preacher, The Old Battle-
ground); Martin Merivale, His N Mark; Neighbor Jackwood; The Drummer Boy; Cud_]'oe’s
Cave; The Three Scouts; Lucy Arlyn; Neighbors’ Wives; Lawrence’s Adventures among
the Ice-Cutters, etc. ; Coupon Bonds ; The South, A Tour of its Battleﬁelds; The Vagabonds,
and other Poems.

Mr. Tr-owbridge lives at Arlington, seven miles from Boston.

“If there is any one who understands so thoroughly New England life and character, and
describes it so accurately and with so much sympathy and humor as the author of Neighbor
Jackwood, we are not acquainted with him. Mr. Trowbridge has qualiﬁcations as a tale-
writer which render all his productions reputable and even exceptional ; but he is strongest

when he keeps the Connecticut River, the Green Mountains, and Massachusetts Bay in sight
In Cudjoe’s Cave he showed very clearly that he had strayed from his native soil. For if he
is master in his way, that way is not of the broadest. He cannot, like Gérome, paint you an
Arab, Turk, Egyptian, Russian; he cannot call tl1e past before you—the ltoman amphi-
theatre, the Areopagus, augurs, players, philosophers; but he will give you the youth of
to-day with absolute ﬁdelity, and no historical painting can be better — it ranks with the
Bigelow Papers, and the domestic poems of Whittier.” —-— The Nation.

THE VAGABONDS.

We are two travellers, Roger and I.
Roger ’s my dog. —-Come here, you scamp.
Jump for the gentlemen,—mind your eye!
Over the table,—1ook out for the lamp!-—
The rogue is growing a little old:
Five years we’ve tramped through wind and weather,
And slept out doors when nights were cold,
And ate and drank—and starved—together.

We ’ve learned what comfort is, I tell you I '
A bed on the ﬂoor, a bit of rosin.
A ﬁre to thaw our thumbs, (poor fellow,
The paw he holds up there has been frozen,)
Plenty of catgut for my ﬁddle,
(This out-door business is bad for strings,)
Then a few nice buckwheats hot from the griddle,
And Roger and I set 11p for kings!

No, thank you, Sir, —I never drink:
Roger and I are exceedingly moral,-
Are n’t we, Roger?—see him wink! —
Well, something hot, then, we won’t quarrel.
IIe’s thirsty, too——see him nod his head!
What a pity, sir, that dogs can’t talk——
He understands every word that’s said,——-
And he knows good milk from water and chalk.

The truth is, Sir, now I reflect,
I’ve been so sadly given to grog,
I wonder I ’ve not lost the respect
(Here ’s to you, Sir !) even of my dog.
But he sticks by, through thick and thin;
And this old coat, with its empty pockets,
And rags that smell of tobacco and gin,
He ’ll follow while he has eyes in his sockets.

There is n’t another creature living
Would do it. and prove, through every llisaster,
So fond, so faithful, and so forgiving,
To such a miserable thankless master!
No, Sir!——see him wag his tail and grin!
By George! it makes my old eyes water!
That is, there ’s something in this gin
That chokes a fellow. But no matter!

We’ll have some Inusic,'if you are willing,
And Roger (hem! what a plague a cough is, Sir!)
Shall march a little.~—Start, you villain!
Stand straight! ’Bout face! Salute your officer!
Put up that paw! Dress! Take your riﬂe!
(Seine dogs have arms, you see!) Now hold
Your cap while the gentlemen give a triﬂe,
To aid a poor old patriot soldier.

March! Halt! Now show how the rebel shakes,

‘When he stands up to hear his sentence.
‘ Now tell how many drains it takes

To honor a jolly new acquaintance.

Five yelps, that ‘s ﬁve; he’s mighty knowing!
The night ’s before us, ﬁll the glasses!

Quick, Sir! I’n1 ill,——1ny brain is going;
Some brandy,——~—thank you; there,—it passes!

Why not reform? That ’s easily said;

But I’ve gone through such wretched treatment,
Sometimes forgetting the taste of bread,

And scarce remembering what meat meant,
That my poor stomach ’s past reform;

And there are times when, mad with thinking,
I’d sell out Heaven for something warm

To prop a horrible inward sinking.

Is there a way to forget to think‘?
At your age, Sir, home, fortune, friends,

A dear girl’s love, —-but I took to drink;—
The same old story; you know how it ends.
If you co11ld have seen these classic features,-—
You need n’t laugh, Sir; they were not then
Such a burning libel on Goc’s creatures;

I was one of your handsome men!

If you had seen her, so fair, so young,
Whose head was happy on this breast!
If you could have heard the songs I sung
When the Wine went round, you would n’t have guessed
That ever I, Sir, should be straying
V From door to door, with ﬁddle and dog,
Ragged and penniless, and playing
To you to-night for a glass of grog.

She’s married since, a parson’s wife;
’Twas better for her that we should part;
Better the soberest prosiest life
Than a blasted home and broken heart.
I have seen her? Once: I was weak and spent
On the dusty road; a carriage stopped;
But little she dreamed, as on she went,
Who kissed the coin that her ﬁngers‘ dropped?

4'06 AMERICAN LITERATURE»

Y0u’ve set me talking, Sir; I ’m sorry;

It makes me wild to think of the change!
What do you care for a beggar’s story?

Is it amusing? You ﬁnd it strange?
I had a mother so proud of me!

’Twas well she died before. Doyou know
If the spirits in heaven can see

The ruin and wretchedness here below?

Another glass, and strong, to deaden
This pain; then Roger and I will start.
I wonder, has he such a lumpish, leaden,
Aching thing, in place of a heart?
He is sad sometimes, and would weep, if he could,
No doubt, remembering things as they were,—-
A virtuous kennel, with plenty of food,
And himself a sober respectable cur.

I’m better now; that glass was warming,-—
You rascal! limbcr your lazy feet!
We must be ﬁddling and performing
For supper and bed, or starve in the street. —~
Not a very gay life to lead, you think?
But soon we shall go where lodgings are free,
And the sleepers need neitheryvictuals nor drink;—-
The sooner the better for Roger and me.

JOHN WILLIAM PALMER, M.D., 1825 —, is a native of Baltimore He was City Physician
of San Francisco in 1849, entered the East India Compan'y’s service as a surgeon in 1851, and
continued in it for two or three years. In 1853 he returned to the United States, and em-
barked in literary pursuits, contributing to Putnam, Harper, the Atlantic, the New York
Tribune, and other periodicals. Among his best-known "fugitive pieces are The California
Sketches, in Putnam; Forty-nine, a Chapter from the Real Romance of San Francisco, in
Harper; Sketches of East India Life, in the Atlantic. He has published also The Golden
Dagon, or Up and Down the Irrawaddie, being passages of adventures in the Burman Empire
of an American; The New and the Old, or California and India in Romantic Aspects; The
Queen’s Heart, a Comedy. played with success in Boston; also several volumes of transla-

tions and compilations

Mas. HENRIETTA (LEE) PALMER, 1834 , is a native of Baltimore. She was married, in
1855, to J. W. Palmer, M.D. She has been a contributor to the New York Tribune’; has
translated The Lady Tartuffe, from Rachel ; and has published a volume of great merit, The
Stratford Gallery, or The Shakspeare Sisterhood, containing forty-ﬁve ideal portraits. Mrs.
Palmer’s plan, in this, is “simply to present a woman’s instinctive measurement of the
heighth and breadth and depth of Shakespearian women.”

Gen. Hill.

GEN. DANIEL HARVEY HILL, 1824 , a distinguished ofﬁcer in the
Confederate army during the War, has acquired almost equal distinction
since the War as a magazinist. His magazine, The Land VVe Love, is said
to be the most successful, as it is the ablest, monthly published in the South.

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 407

Gen. Hill is a native of South Carolina, and a graduate of West Point, of the class of 1842.
He was distinguished for gallantry in the Mexican war; resigned from the army in 1849,
and became Professor of Mathematics, ﬁrst in Washington College, Lexington, Va., then in
Davidson College, N.C., and then, in 1859, Principal of the Military Institute, Charlotte,

, N. C. He took an active part in the war’, and was distinguished for his ability. “In the

army I knew Gen. Hill by reputation, as an austere man, eccentric, having no mercy upon
skulkers and deadheads, a good ﬁghter, and a. writer of pointed endorsements and telling
orders. He entered the army as a Colonel, and came out of it a Lieutenant-General. That
fact gives a whole biography in itself.” — J. Wood Davidson.

Gen. Hill has published the following works: Essays from the Quarterly Review; Essays
from the Southern "Presbyterian Review; Algebra. His chief literary work, however, has
been done in the magazine already mentioned, The Land We Love.

IV. JOURNALISTS.

James Gordon Bennett.

J AMES GORDON BENNETT, 1800-1872, the founder of the New York
Herald, initiated anew era in journalism. He was followed, indeed, in close
succession by Mr. Greeley, and at a somewhat later interval by Mr. Ray-
mond. But to Mr. Bennett clearly belongs the honor of making the ﬁrst
movement in this direction. After having embarked in the enterprise, he
made it his one, undivided ambition, to achieve success as a journalist, and
he realized, in this respect, the full extent of his ambition. '

Mr. Bennett was born at Keith, in Scotland, of Catholic parents. He attended a Catholic
seminary in Aberdeen,with a view of taking orders. liut the ministry being distasteful to
him, he left the seminary, and emigrated to America, landing at Halifax in 1819.

His ﬁrst effort to gain a living was by teaching. Failing in this he went to Boston, where
for a time he was engaged as proof-reader in the printing-house of Wells & Lily. In 1822
he Went to New York, and managed to make a living by writing items for various journals.
In 1823 he went to Charleston, S. C., and was employed by the Charleston Courier in trans.
lating articles from the Spanish American papers. In 1824 he returned to New York, and
made an effort to open a school, but failed. In 1825 he bought the New York Courier, a
Sunday paper, but not succeeding with it returned to his occupation of reporter. In 1826
he became editor of the National Advocate, an anti-tariff paper. In 1827 he formed a con.
nection with the New York Inquirer (changed soon after to the Courier and Inquirer) and
went to Washington as its correspondent. In that position he gained considerable celebrity
by the ability displayed in his articles. In 1832 he started another paper on his own account,

‘the New York Globe, but failed. The same year he became editor and part proprietor of

The Pennsylvanian, and continued in this position until 1834. He then returned to New
York and determined to found a paper of his own, for which his varied experience of the
preceding ﬁfteen years had served as a. special training.

In 1885, Mr. Bennett, with $500 in his pocket, rented a small cellar in Wall Street and
began the Herald, his desk and counter being a plank supported on two old barrels. At the
end of six months, even these humble arrangements were destroyed by ﬁre. But he fortl1-
with rented another cellar, and with characteristic enterprise brought out his paper the
following morning without interruption.

From that day to this the Herald has steadily grown in power and inﬂuence.

The features which distinguish the great journals of to-day from those of a former genera-

408 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

tion are mainly the following: 1. Independence of party dictation in its editorials ; 2. Making
the acquisition of the latest news at any cost the ﬁrst and leading aim ; 3. Free discussion
of ﬁnance and of stock-jobbing, or what is known as the “ Money Article ” ; 4. Foreign cor-
respondence, by persons living at the great European centres; 5. Army correspondence, in

‘time of war, gathering and publishing at the earliest possible moment the actual occurrences

of the battle-ﬁeld; G. Interviewing, or obtaining at ﬁrst hand,from the lips of the actors

themselves, accounts of great social and political movements. I11 each of these radical-

changes, now become almost universal, Mr. Bennett took the initiative.

Mr. Bennett devoted himself to the work of building up a great paper with a singleness
of purpose that has no parallel in the annals of journalism, and his success was commensu-
rate with his devotion.

“Mr. Bennett will be judged in future not by what he was, but by what he accomplished.
The passions, thehates, the controversies of the past, will all fade away from memory in
another generation. But The Herald will remain the permanent and visibleqproof of what
there was in the heart and the intellect of its founder.

“Viewing his life from this point of view, it was completely successful. He had no other
aim than to make a great and lucrative newspaper. In his days of poverty and privation,
he boasted with gay deﬁance that, in spite of all the malice of his enemies, he would one day
make the Herald produce $30,001) annually. He probably thought this prophecy exagger-
ated, but he lived to see it dwindled into absurdity, by its tenfold accomplishment. He
attained this great result by no trick, no luck, no accident. There was never seen a more
logical and necessary issue of a given course of action. He was a man of extraordinary
capacity. He has written so little of late years that elderly people have forgotten and young
people never have known that no journalist in the country excelled him in the power of
commenting upon current events in the way most acceptable to a large majority of readers.
He had a good temper and a geniality which were purely professional, having no relation
whatever to his toilsome and sombre life. At a time when drunkenness was the rule among
people of his craft, he was as frugal and abstemious as an Arab. An iron constitution ena-
bled him to do the work of three ordinary men, without either fever or fatigue. To these
qualiﬁcations was added a gift which is common enough ‘now, but which at the time when
he began his career was so rare that it partook of the exceptional quality of genius. He un-
derstood the value of news. He may almost be said to be the inventor of journalism in its
latest and highest development as a means of disseminating all accessible contemporaneous
intelligence. He was the ﬁrst journalist who went to meet the news half-way. This was
the sole secret of his success. All the sensations, scandals, and ﬁerce wranglings of his ear-
lier years did very little to advance or retard the march of his great newspaper. When he
began that long and desperate battle with a hostile fate in the dark Wall Street cellar, the
victory was assured to him beforehand by his inexhaustible energy and his infallible jour-
nalistic instinct.

“By adhering to certain true piéinciples ofjournalism, he made the greatest material, that
is to say, pecuniary success, in’that profession which the world has yet seen. This is per-
haps as much in the way of example as the world has any right to expect from any one
man. Beyond this, it certainly receives nothing more than warning from the founder of
The Herald. Ile attempted no more than the establishment of a newspaper. Others have
followed him in the same path with equal success, and now the only journalism which looks
to the future for a constantly widening sphere of power and influence is that which aims not
only to gather and edit each day the whole world’s history for the preceding day, but, so far
as possible, in addition, to lead and train the honest thought of the world. This is an im-

_mense plan, impossible to be accomplished perfectly by the present resources of any journal.

Even to approach its fulﬁlment will require all the energy, all the sagacity, all the varied
ability, all the personal probity of the great journalist who died on Saturday, together with
a public conscience, a personal earnestness, a freedom from private ends, and a respect for
the dignity of human nature, which he considered outside of the sphere of journalism.”—-
New Yo?‘/c Tribzme.

FROM 1850 To THE 1>REsENT TIME. 409

Horace. Greeley.

, HORACE GREELEY, 1811-1872, divided with Mr. Bennett the credit of
imitating the new type of journalism which was introduced in the last gen-
eration. Mr. Greeley had other ambitions. But the main work of his life
was the founding of the New York Tribune.

Mr. Greeley was born at Amherst, N. H., the son of a farmer. He learned the art of
printing, and worked at it about four years. After trying several other places, he ﬁnally
went to New York in 1831, and not long after rose from the occupation of a type-setter to
that of a journalist. He was engaged in various editorial enterprises, but with no marked
success until 1840, when he published The Log Cabin, a campaign paper supporting Harri-
son for the Presidency, which attained a circulation of 80,000, and “ gave him an immense
reputation in all parts of the country as an able writer and a zealous politician,” (Parton.)

In the following year, 1841, being then just thirty years of age, he began The New York
Tribune, and since that time his fame and fortunes have been indissolubly connected with
that journal. Not only has he “grown with its growth and strengthened with its strength,”
but he has for a period of thirty years stamped upon it in boldest linesthe features of his
own character. There may be other journals equally able, but there is none, in either hem-
isphere, that has so much individuality; none of which, in any given circumstances, we can
predict its course, just as we would those of a living man of known character and ante-
cedents.

Besides his work as a journalist, or rather in connection with it, and as its legitimate
offshoots, Mr. Greeley has published several valuable works, and has done much as a popu-
lar lecturer. The following is a list of his principal separate publications: Hints towards
Reforms; Glances at Europe; Art and Industry, as represented in the Exhibition of the
Crystal Palace; Association Discussed ; What I Know of Farming; History of the Struggle
for Slavery Extension ; The American Conﬂict; Recollections of a Busy Life, etc. '

In 1848-9, Mr. Greeley was a member of the House of Representatives at Washington. II
1872, he was a candidate for the Presidency of the United States.

Henry J. Raymond.

HENRY JARVIS RAYMOND, LL.D., 1820-1869, acquired great and de-
served celebrity as the founder and editor of the New York Times. Of all
the conspicuous enterprises in that line which have marked the last thirty
years, his paper was the only one which was successful from the beginning.
He is also one of the small, though now growing, number of eminent jour-
nalists who had a regular classical education.

Mr. Raymond was born in Lima, Western New York. He was ﬁtted for college in the
Genesec Wesleyan Seminary at that place, and was graduated at Burlington University, Vt.,
in the class of 1840. He could read at the age of three, and he began going to the District
school when only three and a half years old; and in all his schools, down to the time of his
graduation, he gained distinction by his studious habits, his quickness at learning, and his
uniform correctness of deportment . I

His ﬁrst impulse after graduating was to engage in teaching, but failing to ﬁnd immediate
employment, he went to New York with the view of trying his fortune there, and offered his

services to Mr. Greeley, who was then publishing a small weekly paper, The New Yorker.
Mr. Greeley was poor, his paper was barely paying expenses, and there was no place for an
additional assistant.’ All that young Raymond could at first obtain wa.s permission to hang
about the oﬂice and make himself generally useful, while waiting for “something to turn
up.” The ‘matter ended, however, in a few weeks in Mr. Greeley’s engaging him at a salary
of eight dollars a week, and this engagement decided Raymond’s career. He became from
that day ajournalist by profession.

When Mr. Greeley, in the following year, 1841, began the publication of the Tribune, Mr.
Raymoncl was his ﬁrst assistant, and gave himself upto the work with great zeal. The con-
521-: ction continued about three years. Of this service Mr. Greeley says, in his Recollections
mi’ :1 Busy Life, “I never found another person, barely of age andjust from his studies, who
exlnced so much and so versatile ability in journalism as he did. Abler and stronger men I
may have met; a cleverer, readier, more generally efficient journalist I never saw.”

In 1843, Mr. Raymond left the Tribune for a more lucrative position in the Courier and
Inquirer, and he continued in the latter paper until 1850.

The signal ability displayed by Mr. Raymond in the editorial columns of this paper, and
particularly in the discussion between him and Mr. Greeley in the winter of 1846 and 1847,
on the subject of Socialism, became a matter of general notoriety throughout the country,
so that when Mr. Raymond determined to found a paper of his own, he had little diﬂiculty
in obtaining the necessary amount of capital for beginning his enterprise.

The New York Times began its existence in September, 1851, and was successful from the
ﬁrst. The capital invested in it was one hundred thousand dollars. At the end of eight
years, the proprietors refused for their property the offer of one million of dollars. This
wonderful success was undoubtedly due in no small degree to the literary and intellectual
character and labors of Mr. Raymond. He was the inspiring soul of the enterprise, and from
the time of its inception to the time of his death, he was its editor-in-chief.

Mr. Raymond was a member of the New York Legislature in 1850 and 1851, and in the
latter year he was Speaker of the Assembly. In 1855-7, he was Lieutenant—Governor of New
York, and in 1865-6 he was a member of the House of Representatives in Washington.

Mr. Raymond’s political career, particularly that in Congress, has been severely criti-
cised. But men of all parties award him the praise of having been one of the most accom-
plished and successful of American journalists. He did a great service to the profession by
elevating the tone of newspaper discussion, showing by his own example that it was possible
to be earnest and brilliantwithout transgressing the laws of decorum.

Mr. Raymond’s publications, apart from his newspaper work, were few. He wrote a Biog-
raphy of Abraham Lincoln, two or three College Addresses, and several political manifes-
tdes, setting forth the views of the Republican party. But his literary productiveness,
through the columns of the Tribune, Courier and Inquirer, and Times, was prodigious. llis
articles in these papers, which, though necessarily dashed off in haste, were often of a
high order of literary merit, would ﬁll a large number of volumes. As an evidence of his
power of concentration and of rapid production in cases of emergency, it,may be mentioned
that on the occasion of the death of Daniel Webster, the Times for the following day, October
25th, 1852, contained a biography of Webster, twenty-six columns in length, every word of
which was written and put in type in the few hours intervening between the news that
Webster was dying and the hour that the paper went to press. Of that remarkable bio-
graphical sketch, sixteen columns were written by Mr. Raymond himself, in a space of less
than half a day I _

-A Biography of Mr. Raymond has been written by Mr. Augustus Maverick, in a large vol-
ume of 501 pages, entitled Henry J. Raymond and the New York Press.

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 411

W. H. Hurlbut.

WILLIAM HENRY HURLBUT, 1827 , of the New York World, is

probably, of all the living journalists of America, who have made journal-

ism a distinct and exclusive profession, the one most highly educated, as he
is the most ‘brilliant and versatile. Unlike some of our other leading
journalists, he has had every advantage Which education and opportunity
could bestow. Besides a thorough classical and academic training, and
familiarity with the languages and literatures of the leading nations of
Europe, he has had large experience of travel and of intercourse with
men in all the great centres of power.’ These advantages he utilizes to
the last degree, and he throws himself into the work of writing,'on the
exigencies of the hour, with a fulness of resource and an abandon of effort
that are marvellous.

Mr. Hurlbut was born in Charleston, S. C. Up to the time of his entering college, he was
educated in Philadelphia, by his father, Mr. M. L. Hurlbut, who had opened a classical school

~ in that city, and who was a man of superior parts and learning. Under these favorable
"auspices, he was grounded with extraordinary care and thoroughness in the knowledge of

Greek and Latin. He entered Harvard in 1845, and was graduated in 1847. After gradua-
tion, he remained at Cambridge as a student of theology, law, and general literature for
eight years, including two years spent in Europe.

In 1854, he published in Boston, Gan Eden or Pictures of Cuba, which was republished in
London by the Longmans, at the suggestion of Walter Savage Landor.

In 1855 he adopted the profession of a writer, and went to New York. He wrote at this-

time for Putnanfs Magazine, The Albion, Frazer’s, and the Edinburgh Review. In 1855, he
delivered the Phi Beta Kappa Poem at Cambridge, the orator on the occasion being Henry
Ward Beecher.

The year 1856 was spent in Europe, and in that year he published, in the October number
of the Edinburgh Review, the famous article on the Political Crisis in the United States,
which attracted such general attention on both sides of the Atlantic. The article was
denounced in the Senate of the United States by Butler of South Carolina. On the other
hand, the author received letters of thanks from Prince Albert and Lord Macaulay, and was
elected an Honorary Foreign Member of the London Athenaeum Club.

In 1857, he was invited by Henry J. Raymond to join the staff of the New York Times.
He was at that time a strong opponent of the South on the Kansas question, as he had
always been an anti-slavery man. _

In 1858 he went again to Europe, and after spending “the season” in London, made “a.
continental tour‘ with Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Hughes, and Lord and Lady Goderich, now the
Marquis and Marchioness of Ripon.” On his return he brought with him the proof—sheets of
Tom Brown and Rugby, which he induced Fields of Boston to publish and introduce to the
American public.

In 1859 he abandoned the Republican party as revolutionary, and espoused the cause of
Douglas in the Times. When, after the election of 1860, Raymond decided to support the
Lincoln administration, Mr. Hurlbut amicably left him.

In 186l he went South, on private affairs, to his sister’s in Charleston, and being arrested
by a Vigilance Comrnittee, in Atlanta, Ga., he went at his own expense with his accusers to
Richmond. There, after being imprisoned for a time, he was released, in January, 1862, by
order of the Confederate Commissioner Lyons. The Confederate War Department, however,
refused him a passport, unless with an agreement not to take part against the Confederacy-—
a condition which he peremptorily declined. He remained in Richmond until the failure of
McClellan’s campaign.

412 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

In August, 1862, he escaped through the Confederate lines, and reached Washington. He
published in the Times, at the request of Mr. Raymond, an account of his Southern experi-
ences; but ﬁnding himself unable to act with the party in power, he associated himself, in
October, 1862, with the New York World, then organizing as a Democratic paper, and he
has since that time been steadily prominent i11 that journal and with the Democrats of New
York. .

In 186i, he published a book on General McClellan and the Conduct of the War. In the
same year he purchased the Commercial Advertiser, with Free Trade intentions and asso-
ciates; but, as the association could not agree, the Advertiser was sold, in 1867 , to Thurlow
Weed.

Mr. Hurlbut went to Mexico on private business in 1866, and was invited to the capital by
the unfortunate Maximilian. In 1867, as the representative of the New York World, he
visited the World’s Fair at Paris, and the Centenary Festival of St. Peter at Rome. Two
years later, on the invitation of the Empress Eugenie and of M. De Lesseps, he visited Tur-
key, Syria, and Egypt, before and during the fétes of the Suez Canal, which he described in
the World. He was present at the opening of the (Ecumenical Council in Rome, December 8,

I 1869, and spent the winter in that city corresponding with the World. After a tour in Dalma-

tia, Hungary, Albania, Greece, and European Turkey, he returned home in the summer of
1870. In January of 1871, he was invited to accompany the United States Expedition to San
Domingo, during which he wrote and published, in the World, an account, the only one
tolerably complete, in the English, or indeed in any language, of the modern history of that
country.

Mr. Hurlbut is an apt illustration of Buffon’s saying, that the style is the man. Other
American writers for the press have had scholarly training on the one hand, or world-

experience on the other, but few, if any, have so successfully combined the two. His leaders .

and letters, in the World, have that peculiar ease and that raciness which are found only in

' the writings of men who have not merely read much and closely, but have mingled freely

with society in all its phases. The sentences are neither too long nor too short, but judi_
ciously varied; the words are thoughtfully chosen and thoughtfully placed, yet with seeming
artlessness; the keys and the pitch of the theme are incessantly varied; and the writer
wields his instrument at_wil1, never going too far, but hammering, or cutting, or stinging,
or bantering, as the occasion or the subject demands and his own good taste approves.

Mr. Hurlbut, besides his knowledge of the classics, is master of the leading languages of
continental Europe, and familiar with its literature and its history. He is thus enabled to
enrich his contributions with the accumulated gleanings of many tongues and many lands,
not interlarding his English with quotations and italicised phrases, but in the way of apt
allusion, accurate statement, breadth of view, and diversiﬁed culture.

“ We admit the practical force and verbal vigor of Horace Greeley’s leading articles; We
admire the breadth of philosophic thought and large style of Parke Godwin’s; we know
the judiciousness of Rayxnond’s, the immacnlateness of Dana’s, the dignity and complete-
ness of Manton Marble’s, the gravity of Godkin’s —bnt the unique, the brilliant, the unri-
valled Corinthian style of one of the writers of the New York World, whose articles whip
and bewilder and amuse the mind, is a matter for special consideration. Whether he discusses
the opera, Kilpatrick, Sickles, Butler, Seward. Sumner, or Grant; H. G. or ‘ Sorosis;’ art,
music, or literature; his articles are alike exuberant, unscrupulous, and remarkable. He is
the most audacious, familiar, and brilliant of American journalists, a.nd handles with un-
common tease and in a rapid manner the most diverse subjects ; yet probably makes no more
permanent impression on the political mind of the country than so much foam on its shores.
Who that has read his articles but has admitted the sweep and dash of the style, the free
handling-— as painters would call it, the bold touch? Although no man’s articles are more
invariably recognized, none are more original and unexpected in treatment. His alliterative
phrases and rich fund of expression, his Scriptural allusions, which are the envy or abom-
ination of enlightened readers, are the unfailing characte'ristics of his work. He covers the

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 413

gravest and heaviest subjects with the very foam of human speech, and freshens the driest;
mind with the cool, full shock of his style. His sang froicl, audacity, playfulness, and ﬂuency
give one a shock like the sea-foam of a running wave, and, like it, melt away in noise, leaving

you not exactly sure of the drift of the matter. In one word, Mr. Hurlbut is the prince of

perst'ﬂem‘s. Only a polished and adroit mind can perszﬁﬂe. Mr. Hurlbut has a polished and
adroit mind. But his knowledge, his experience, are used only as a means to shine, not to
warm. The intellectual light that radiates from his works is an artiﬁcial light, meant to
dazzle and please the luxurious, not to send heat to some freezing little one of our demo-
cratic life.” —— Eugene Benson, in the Galaxy.

E. L. Godkin.

EDWIN L. GODKIN, 1831 ,. editor of the Nation, represents still
another element of American journalism, appreciably different from any of
those already named. In a paper such as The Nation, news is no longer
king. Independent and trustworthy criticism on the living issues of the
day form the one predominating element in a periodical of this kind, and
for such a function Mr. Grodkin has acknowledged aptitudes of a high order.

Mr. Godkin was born in Wicklow County, thirty miles from Dublin, Ireland. He was edu-
cated at a Grammar-school near Wakeﬁeld, Yorkshire, England, and afterwards at Queen’s
College, Belfast.

After leaving college, and while preparing himself for the bar, he was invited by Mr.
Knight Hunt, who then edited the,London Daily News, and whose attention had been
attracted by some of Mr. Godkin’s contributions to the periodical press, to go to Turkey as
the Correspondent of that paper, in View of the war thenimpending between Turkey and
Russia. He went out accordingly in that capacity in the fall of 1853, reaching the Turkish
headquarters on the Danube immediately after the action of Oltenitza. He passed the win-
ter in the Turkish camp at K-alafat on the upper Danube, crossed the river with the main
body in the summer of 1854, after witnessing the operations at Silistria, and passed the fall
travelling about in the Danubi-an Principalities, and in Transylvania. In January, 1855, he
Went to the Crimea, and passed the remainder of the winter at Eupatoria, going to Sebasto-
pol in April, where he witnessed the battles of the Tchernaya, of June 18th, and the ﬁnal
assault on the place. After some excursions in Asia Minor, he returned to England in the
following winter, broken down in health. '

In the fall of 1856, he came to the United States, and passed the months of November, De-
cember, and January following, in a horseback journey through the Southern and South-
western States, an account of which was communicated to the Daily News, in a series of
Letters. - .

On returning to New York, he determined to settle there and engage in the practice of the
law, and entered the oﬁice of Mr. David Dudley Field by way of preparation, and in 1858 he
was admitted to the bar. In 1859 his health again broke down, and he returned to Europe,
passing the years 1861-62 on the continent, mainly in Paris and Switzerland, but doing no
work beyond making occasional editorial communications to the Daily News on American
questions.

He returned to New York towards the close of 1862, and until the establishment of the
Nation, in 1865, was the New York Correspondent of the Daily News, and a regular editorial
contributor to the New York Times. '

Beyond a few articles in the Quarterlies, on political and commercial topics, Mr. God-
kin’s literary work has been done wholly for the newspaper press. The paper with which
he is more particularly identiﬁed as an American writer, is the Nation, already mentioned.

414 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

It was begun in 1865, with Mr. Godkin as editor, and a stock company as proprietors. In
1866, the company was dissolved, and the paper passed i11to the hands of Mr. Godkin and two
other gentlemen. Mr. Godkin, however, has always been its chief and responsible editor.

’.l‘he permanent establishment of the Nation marks a new and interesting phase in Ameri-
can journals. For many years France, Germany, and England —especially England —— have
had weekly critical papers devoted to politics and pure literature. The Athenaeum, Specta-
tor, and Saturday Review are familiar to all Americans. But it was reserved for the Nation
to show that a weekly of like character and ability was also possible in the United States.
At first the success of the Nation was by no means assured. It had not only to create its
public, so to speak, but it had to compete with the Round Table, which had been previously
started. But the Round Table, while occasionally brilliant, lacked deﬁniteness of aim and
careful editing, and hence disappeared, as a separate journal, in 1868, leaving the ﬁeld clear to
its younger rival. Since that time the progress of the Nation has been uniform, if not rapid,
and it is now a paying enterprise. Its circle of appreciative readers grows steadily from
year to year, and it is an acknowledged power in the land. It is, on the whole, the best
written and most ably edited paper in the country. Although of course the work of many
pens and of different minds, its style is uniformly clear and elegant, free from vulgarity and
extravagance. Mr. Godkin’s contributions are numerous and varied, ranging over the whole
ﬁeld covered by the journal, to which he has succeeded in imparting a general tone of health
and raciness.

Parke Godwin.

PARKE GODWIN, LL. D., 1816 —-—, has acquired distinction in several
Walks of authorship, but is chieﬂy known by his connection with the New
York Evening Post, of which he has been at different times the associate
editor.

Mr. Godwin was born at Paterson, N. J ., and graduated at Princeton, in the class of 1834.
He studied law, and was admitted to the bar in Kentucky, but did not practise. From 1837
to 1858 he was associated with his father-in-law, Mr. Bryant, in the Evening Post. In 1843
he undertook a weekly periodical, the Pathﬁnder, which, however, was continued only three
months. He was a frequent contributor to the Democratic Review, and afterwards to Put-
nam’s Magazine, Writing chieﬂy on political and literary subjects. He was for a time editor
of Putnam. In 1865 he resumed his connection with the Post, which position he still holds.

Mr. Godwin, besides his newspaper and magazine articles, is the author of several separate
volumes. Among them may be named the following: Zschokke’s Tales, and part of Goethe’s
Autobiography, translated from the German; A Popular View of the Doctrines of Charles
Fourier; Constructive Democracy; Vala, a mythological tale, founded on incidents in the
life of Jenny Lynd ; A Handbook of Universal Biography; Out of the Past, a collection of
papers on literature and criticism; A History of France. The work last named is the one
on which he has spent most labor and study. It is not a mere compilation, or rehash ofold
materials, but is written from original investigation, and intended as a classical work. The
ﬁrst volume, giving a history of Ancient Gaul down to the time of Charlemagne, was pub-
lished in 1860.

Mr. Godwin received the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the College of New
Jersey, in 1872.

THE JCURNALIST.

No man requires a larger range of intellect, more varied acquirements, or greater strength
of character, than the conductor of a public journal. Of course, we allude to one who acts
with a full sense of the dignity and worth of his calling, and a conscientious desire to discharge
its duties. Neither statesman, lawyer, nor divine moves in a broader sphere, or has more

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 415

occasion for the use of the noblest faculties both of mind and heart. The journalist stands
in immediate contact with the public mind; he gives a tone to public sentiment; he is the
guardian and guide of public morals. Thousands of men, each morning and evening, listen
to his voice, are moved by his persuasions, are chastised by his rebukes, or corrupted by his
license. He may elevate the bad, or degrade the good——he can stimulate the worst or the
best passions. '

His inﬂuence again differs from that of others not only in its directness but its persist-ency.
While theirs is conﬁned to particular and distant occasions, his acts incessantly. The orator
agitates only while he is speaking; the preacher is hemmed in by the walls of his church,
and the limits of a Sabbath-day; the statesman seldom steps out of his bareau; the man of
science is ﬁxed among his retorts and crucibles; and the teacher’s sway is conﬁned to his
schoolroom. But the editor is universally as well as perpetually at work. As the mails carry
his speculations from one city to another, his action spreads like the waves of a pool, and be-
fore the last ripple has subsided, the waters at the centre a.re again disturbed. Even while
he sleeps his thoughts are awake, entering other minds, and moulding them to good or evil.

Why is it that a means so intimately connected with human happiness as the press, so
powerful over social issues and human destinies, has so seldom been used by men of the
loftiest endowments?

It is not because the sphere of the journalist is too contracted for a noble ambition; for
it is a sphere as wide as the universe of intelligence, and as durable as language. As a
means of swaying the minds of men, which is the essence of power, as an instrument for
elevating society, which is the object of goodness, as a vehicle for the expression and enforce-
ment of thought, the press is without an equal among all the constituted agencies of human
utterance. No voice reaches so far as the voice of the press; no book arrests a wider atten-
tion or penetrates a deeper retirement.

It is not because the s11bjet:'~i's with which newspaper w ‘iting is mostly occupied, are tem-
porary and incidental. That species of composition is not conﬁned to chronicling events,
or to ﬁglitinq the battles of transient pa.rties. Higher objects often engage it. The instruc-
tion of society in the nature of government, the inculcation of great principles, the applica-
tion oi’ judicious criticism, the development and control of social tendencies, the direction
of public opinion, the exposition of public characters, the prosecution of grand moral re-
forms, and the correction of prevailing iniquities and frauds, are among its principal func-
tions. The editor is stationed, as a sentinel upon the watch-towers of society, to warn it of
the approach of dangers; to summon it to battle, and to cheer it on to success.

Nor is it because there is anything in the condition of the press to cripple its activity and
arrest its inﬂuence. N 0 better condition could be required for it than obtains in this
country. It is founded on a basis of perfect freedom. Liberty of action, which is the aim
of the democratic doctrine to introduce into all kinds of business, it has enjoyed from the
beginning. Government has never dared to impose a restraint upon it; it has been exposed
to the stimulus of competition; it has received favor from all political parties. VVhoever
may have fancied that he possessed talent enough to undertake a public journal, has been
at liberty to do so, and he has had the opportunity of displaying all the enthusiasm and
talent that he could bring to the task. _

We must look elsewhere, then, for the causes of the singular fact to which we refer. We
must look, not so much to journalists themselves, as to the community in which they live.
It is because so low a standard has been established in regard to journalism, that so few men
of the strongest intellect. and character have taken it up; they have sought distinction in
other spheres less inﬂuential, but supposed to be more honorable. Because society has not
required more, more has not been done. Journalists are what society has made them; if
they fall short of the lofty dignity of their vocation, it is because society falls short of its
demands. Johnson, in his prologue, says that “ they who live to please, must please to
live,” which is especially true of the press. It has been regarded as a mere agent for pleas-
ing society, and therefore it has aspired to no higher function. }£t has failed to perceive its

real value ; it has failed in asserting its claims ; it has failed in discharging its duties as an
instructor ; it has failed in asserting the moral power of which it is capable.

John R. Thornpson.

. JOHN R. THOMPSON, 1823-187 3, long connected with the Southern Lit-
erary Messenger, and afterwards with the New York Evening Post, did
good service to the periodical literature of the country.

Mr. Thompson was born in Richmond, and educated at the University of Virginia, where
he took the degree of Bachelor of Laws in 1845. He practised law fora short time, but
afterwards gave himself up to the pursuit and profession of literature, for which he was well
ﬁtted by nature. He has produced no books, yet few men in the Southern States have been
more widely or more favorably known by their literary labors, or have exerted a greater
inﬂuence upon the native literature of that region. Mr. Thompson’s chief work has been
done through the columns of the Southern Literary Messenger, which he edited from 1847
to the breaking out ofthe war, and which, as it was the longest lived, so it was the most
high-toned and successful of all the Southern literary magazines. His articles, both prose
and verse, lie scattered through the pages of his own magazine, and of others, he having
never collected them into volumes. Mr. Thompson has succeeded well also as a popular
lecturer, his happiest effort in this line being a lecture upon The Life and Character of Edgar
A. Poe. During the war he went to England, and while there contributed to Blackwood,
and to various other English periodicals. He was, at the time of his death, engaged upon
the editorial staff of the New York. Evening Post.

A. PICTURE.

Across the narrow, dusty street,
I see, at early dawn,

A little girl, with glancing feet
As agile as the fawn.

An hour or so, and forth she goes,
The school she brightly seeks;

She carries in her hand a rose,
And two upon her cheeks.

The sun mounts up the torrid sky—-
The bell for dinner rings-

My little friend, with laughing eye,
Comes gayly back and sings.

The week wears off, and Saturday,
A welcome day, I ween,

Gives time for girlish romp and ‘play—--
How glad my pet is seen!

But Sunday——in what satins great
Does she not then appear! I

King Solomon, in all his state,
Wore no such pretty gear.

I ﬂung her everyday a kiss,
And one she flung to me,
I know not truly when it is

She prettiest may be.

George D. Prentice.

GEORGE DENIsoN PRENTICE, 1802-1870, for forty years editor of the
Louisville Journal, holds a conspicuous place among American journalists.

Mr. Prentice was a native of Preston, Conn., and graduated at Brown University in 1823.
From 1828 to 1830 he was editor of the New England Weekly Review. In 1831 he became
editor ofthe Louisville Journal, and retained that position until his death. Under his edi—
torial management the Journal became one of the leading papers in the country, the fear-
less exponent of Henry Clay Whigism, the violent opponent of the Democratic party, and
the receptacle of Prentice’s inexhaustible wit and satire. Prentice’s wittioisms have become
proverbial. A selection of them was made and published in book-form in 1859, under the
title of Prenticeiana. Prentice also publishedin the Journal several good poems, among
which are The Flight of Years, Sabbath Evening, To My Wife, etc.

George Ripley.

GEORGE RIPLEY, 1802 —~--—, has done service to American literature in
many Ways. He was, With 0. A. Dana, associate editor ‘of Appleton’s
American Encyolopaedia. But his chief Work has been performed in con-
nection With the New York Tribune, where for the last tWenty—four years
he has held the post of literary critic._

Mr. Ripley was born at Greenﬁeld, Mass., and graduated at Harvard, in 1823. He studied
divinity also at Cambridge, and was for several years pastor of a Unitarian church in Boston.
In 1844, ’5, ’6, he was associated with Hawthorne and others in the famous Brook Farm
experiment at West Roxbury. In 1847 he removed to New York, where he has lived ever
since. In 1840-1841, he was, with Emerson and Margaret Fuller,_associate editor of The Dial.
From 1844 to 1848 he edited the Harbinger, a Fourierite organ. In 1849 he became literary
critic of. the Tribune, which position he still holds. His literary criticisms have won for
him high consideration. His separate publications are the following: Discourses on the

Philosophy of Religion; Letters to Andrews Norton on the Latest Form of Inﬁdelity;

Specimens of Foreign Literature (edited), 14 vols.; with Bayard Taylor, Hand—Book of Lit-
erature and the Fine Arts.

Charles A. Dana.

CHARLES ANDERSON DANA, 1819 , editor of the New York Sun,
has been prominent as a journalist for more than twenty years past.

Mr. Dana is a native of New Hampshire. He passed two years at Harvard, but on
account of disease of the eyes was obliged to leave the University before graduating. He
edited the Harbinger for a time, and contributed t.o the Boston Ghronotype. He was asso-
ciated with George Ripley in editing Appleton’s Cyclopaedia, and he edited the Household
Book of Poetry. He was for a long time prominent in the editorial management of the New
York Tribune ; and after leaving that paper he assumed the editorship of the New York Sun,
in which position he still continues. I

Mr. Dana was Assistant Secretary of War in 1863-4.

SAMUEL BoWLEs, 1826 , is a native and a resident of Springﬁeld, Mass. He left school to
enter his father’s printing—otﬁce and editorial rooms at the age of seventeen, and has been

Charles J. Biddle.

MAJOR CHARLES J OHN BIDDLE, 1819~1875, editor of The Age, was a
leading representative of journalism in Philadelphia.

Major Biddle was a son of the late Nicholas Biddle, and was a native and a resident of Phila-
delphia. He was educated at Princeton, graduating in the class of 1837. He studied law
and practised for several years. He enlisted as a volunteer in the Mexican War, and was
breveted Major for gallant behavior. He was in active service also in the late war. I-Iis
writings were limited almost entirely to leading editorials for his paper, but these were
of a high order and have commanded respect from his political opponents as well as from
his friends.

The only separate publication which he made was a carefully prepared essay read be-
fore the Pennsylvania Historical Society, and published by them, in regard to the execu-
tion of Major André. The essay was a reply to the strictures in the History of England by
Lord Mahon, who pronounced the execution of Andre to be the greatest blot in the career
of Washington. Major Biddle’s essay, by the concession of the best English critics, sets this
question at rest. «

“ The Historical Society of Philadelphia has lately been occupied by the consideration of
3 question of some interest to us as Englishmen, namely, the execution of Major André as
a spy during the great American War of Independence. In the last volume of his ‘ History
of England,’ Lord Mahon brought against the memory of Washington a very grave charge
in connection with this melancholy event, terming it ‘ the greatest blot’ upon the career

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 419

of Washington. Zealous to defend the character of their hero, the Americans have very
naturally been indignant at this imputation; and Major Charles J. Biddle, an eminent
member of the above-named Society, uinlertook to investigate the question and to offer the
results of his researches t.o the Society. We are not, of course, surprised that these results
are altogether favorable to the American hero, but must in justice admit that we think that
the evidence produced by Major Biddle would be sufficient to bring an English jury to the
same way of thinking.

“ . . . If every one had had his due, the traitor Arnold would have been given up, and then
the Americans would have let André go free. As it was, however, VVashington had no
alternative : the prisoner was regularly tried before a proper tribunal, and received the fate
which he had incurred. Lord Mahon owes to the memory of the great American patriot
the reparation of,,an apology, or else he owes-to his own fame as an historian a refutation
of the facts upon which the Americans rely.” — London 0rz'tL’c.

Mr. Massey, a later English historian, in his History of England in the Reign of George
the III., refers to Major Biddle’s paper “as clearly establishing the justice of André’s sen-
tence.”

Mr. McMichael was born in Burlington County, N. J. He contributed to the Philadelphia
magazines from 1821 to 1844-, and has been editor of the Philadelphia North American from
1844 t.o the present time. He is an accomplished speaker, and formerly was engaged much
in public lecturing.

John W. Forney.

J OHN WEISS FORNEY, 1817 , is known‘ as a journalist in connection
with his two papers, the Press of Philadelphia, and the Chronicle of
VVashington.

Mr. Forney was born in Lancaster, Pa. He began, in 1833, as a printer’s boy in the ofﬁce
of the Lancaster Journal. In 1845 he went to Philadelphia, and for a long time edited The
Pennsylvanian. From 1851 to 1855, he was Clerk of the House of Representatives at
Washington, and while in that position edited the Union. I11 1857, he began the Press,
which he has continued ever since. From 1861 to 1868, he was Clerk of the Senate at Wash-
ington. He began in 1861 the Washington Chronicle, in addition to the Press. After resign-
ing his position as Clerk of the Senate, he was made Collector of the Port of Philadelphia.
But he resigned this post also, in order that he might devote himself more exclusively to his
work as a journalist.

Mr. Forney has made no separate publications of any note. But his editorials and his
editorial correspondence have been marked by unconnnon ability, and have had a great iii-
ﬂuence on thepublic mind.

ROBERT SHELTON lVIACKENZIE, D.‘C. L., LL. D., 1809 ~ , is the author
of several Works, both prose and verse, but is chieﬂy known as a journalist,
and in connection with the Philadelphia Press.

42O AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Dr. Mackenzie was born in Limerick County, Ireland, and educated at a school in Fermoy

At the age of thirteen he was apprenticed to an apothecary in Cork. He studied medicine
and obtained on examination the degree of M. D. He opened a school in Fermoy. In 1829
he edited a journal in Staffordshire, England. In 1830-81, he was engaged in literary labor
in London. From 1834. to 1851 he was the English correspondent of the New York Evening
Star, and contributed to various American periodicals. In 1847 he took an active part in
the proceedings of Brougham’s Law~Amendi;nent Society. In 1852 he came to America, and
was engaged for several years in New York writing for various journals. In 1857 hebecame
literary and foreign editor of Forney’s Press, Philadelphia, which position he still holds.
His separate publications are the following: Lays of Palestine; 'I‘itian,.an art novel, 3vols.;
Partnership en Commandite, a legal work; lllornings at Matlock, a collection of stories, 3
vols.; Bits of Blarney; Tressilian, or The Story-tellers; Life of Charles Dickens; Life of
Walter Scott. Dr. Mackenzie has edited a valuable series of works, enridhing them with
notes from his own recollections and reading. The following are the works which he has
edited: N octes Ambrosianae, 5 vols.; Dr. Maginn’s Writings, 5 vols.; Shiel’s Sketches of. the
Irish Bar, 2 vols.; and other works by De Quincey, Lady Morgan, etc.
' “The pervading personality, lively spirit, and great accuracy of Dr. M-ackenzie’s notes as
a book editor constitute their value. His life has been passed in intimacy and. correspon-
dence with the leading literati and politicians of his time, and he has a remarkable memory
for dates, events, and persons, which overﬂows into expression when he puts pen to paper.
Such also is his conversation, ——crowded with anecdotes of notable and noticeable persons
and things; and no one would dream, from his lively conversation, that he had nearly ex~
hausted libraries as a reader and contributed to ﬁll them as a writer.” —AlZz'bon,e.

Dr. Mackenzie received the degree of D. C. L. from Oxford, and that of LL. D. from Glas-
gow.

Albert D. Richardson.

ALBERT D. RICHARDSON, 1833-1869, was one of the leading VVar' Cor-
respondents of the New York Tribune.

Mr. Richardson was born in Franklin, Mass. llis schooling was limited to the usual at~
tendance upon the district school, and one year in the Ilolliston Academy, in which latter
place he began the study of the classics and the higher English branches. After leaving the
Academy, he taught a district school for two terms. At the age of eighteen, in 1851, he set
out for the'West, stopping at Pittsburg. Not ﬁnding anything better to do, he took a dis-
trict school in the neighborhood, and taught one term. He then began work as local
reporter for the Pittsburg Journal. He began also to try his hand at play-writing, and was
in high glee on the occasion of selling one of his farces to Barney Williams, the comic actor.
“ I shall never forget how rich I felt, when I was a boy of eighteen, and had sold a play to
Barney Williams for ten dollars, and got the money in my pocket.”

In 1852, he went to Cincinnati, and became local editor to the Sun of that city. He con-
tinued his labors there as reporter for various papers until 1857. While in Cincinnati, he
was married to Miss Mary L. Pease. '

In 1857, he removed to Kansas, and took an active part in the ﬁerce political struggle
going on there, attending conventions and making political speeches, and writing graphic
accounts of affairs to the Boston Journal.

In 1859, the gold excitement at Pike’s Peak being at fever-heat, Mr. Richardson, having
deposited his wife and children in safety at Franklin, Mass, set out on his ﬁrst journey over
the plains to the Rocky Mountains, Horace Greeley among others being in the company.
His next expedition, made in the same year, was a wanderin g journey, mostly on horseback
and mulebaclﬁ, through the western territories, visiting the Cherokee and Choctaw reserva-

tions, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, and writing for the eastern papers letters descrip-
tive of ail that he saw or did. In 1860, he went again to Pike’s Peak as special correspond-
ent of the New York Tribune.

In 1860-61, he undertook the perilous job of going through the Southwestern States as a
secret correspondent of the Tribune, and in this capacity travelled for three or four months,
writing letters, _cl1ieﬂy from New Orleans, and reporting whatever he could hear or see, and
making his way back through Baltimore just before the first actual bloodshed of the war.

For the next two years, he followed the armies of the North as War Correspondent of the
Tribune. VVhile attempting to pass the Vicksburg batteries, in May, 1863, he was captured,
and was kept in close conﬁnement for twenty months, in seven different prisons, Libby and
Salisbury being the last. At length, in December, 1861, he made his escape from Salisbury,
and four weeks after reached the Union lines at Knoxville, Tenn. During his captivity, his
wife and one of his children had died. '8 ‘

Alter the close of the war, his time was spent mostly in authorship. He brought out in
rapid succession three works, all very popular, partly no doubt from the nature of their
subjects, but mainly from the adventurou-s spirit and the graphic power of the writer. These
were: The Field, The Dungeon, and The Escape, giving an account of his experiences as a
war correspondent; Beyond the Mississippi, describing the old West as it was, and the new
VVest as it is; and The Personal History of Ulysses _S. Grant.

Mr. Richardson died December 2, 1869, having been shot in the Tribune Office by Mr.
Daniel McFarland. A volume has since been published, called Garnered Sheaves, contain-
ing a selection from Mr. Richardson’s Miscellaneous writings, and a Memoir.

George Alfred Townsend.

GEoRGE ALFRED TowNsEND, 1841 , the “Grath” of the Chicago
Tribune, has had a large and varied experience as a VVar Correspondent,
both in Europe and America, and has written for nearly all the leading
journals,——the New York Herald, VVorld, Cincinnati Commercial, Chi-
cago Tribune, and others of like standing.

Mr. Townsend was born at Georgetown, the county seat of Sussex, in the south of Delaware,
of parents whose English predecessors settled upon the Chesapeake about 1680. The Town-
sends, a numerous family in the Peninsula, appear to have been Quakers originally; the
Milbournes, family of Mr. Townsend’s mother, were probably Virginia Puritans. Mr. Town-
send’s father, Stephen Townsend, was a mechanic, who became a Methodist preacher about
1835, and is still living in Philadelphia. In the course of his father‘s itinerate career Alfred
was made a native of Delaware in the year 1841. He was educated chieﬂy at the Philadelphia
I-Iigh-School, where he graduated in 1859. The last two years of his High-School course were
almost wholly devoted to newspaper and fugitive writing. While still at school he selected
journalism for his profession, as promising to afford opportunities for travel, and perhaps
for future authorship. Immediately upon graduating he was made news editor of the Phila-
delphia Inquirer, and afterwards city editor of the Press, spending two active years in Phila-
delphia, and accredited as the writer of frequent poems and prose sketches upon many pass-
ing topics. He published a play in 1860, and corresponded from Philadelphia for the New
York Herald until he entered its corps of army correspondents in 1862.

Newspaper correspondence had previously made some display in the columns of the three

New York morning journals, the Herald, Tribune, and Times, notably in the letters of_ Ed-
ward I-I. House and Harry Neill. Bayard Taylor, N. P. 1/Villis, and others, had, many years
previously, distinguished themselves as tourist correspondents, but the day had come when
news was to be king in journalism. _An inundation of new young writers appeared at the

36

422 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

outbreak of the war, and the nature of the volunteer armies seemed to demand that these
writers should be permitted to follow the campaigns and put the soldiers in communication
with their Northern neighbors and families.

Mr. Townsend had the advantage over many of these in fair schooling and in many years
of leisure for desultory reading, when he availed himself of the oddities of a country parson’s
library. He could read before he was four years old, and he is reported to have read the
whole of Matthew Henry’s Commentaries at fourteen. Uncle Tom’s Cabin was the only
novel ever admitted to his father’s house, but the old Apprentices’ Library, in Philadelphia,
gave him a good chance at travels and history.

Mr. Townsend began operation as a war correspondent in the service of the Herald. The
regulations of that paper did not permit a correspondent the use of his name, and hence Mr.
Townsend’s battle-writings in that journal were never accredited to him. It is known, how-
ever, that he made the first detailed report in the United States of the Six Days’ Battles on
the Virginia Peninsula and of McClellan’s retreat, covering three full pages, or about twenty-
ﬁve columns, of the Herald. He had been sick with the typhus fever for a week prior to that
retreat, and after writing the account of the Battleof Cedar Mountain, some weeks later, he
suffered a relapse, and so sailed to Europe in the fall.

An attempt to lecture upon the American War, in Laneashire and the North of England,
immediately after his arrival, resulted in the loss of all his ready money, whereupon he pre-
cipitated himself into London serial literature, and achieved a handsome success, obtaining
thereby means to travel on the continent.

These foreign peregrinations were not without fruit in home correspondence. He was
constantly afoot, chasing up historical clues to their places of reminiscence, or reading in
the British Museum, the Imperial Bibliotheque, and the Library of St. Genevieve. This ad-
ditional lease of ﬂitting scholarship enabled Mr. Townsend, on his arrival in the United
States, to take instant position on the American journals.

He returned to the army in April, 1865, as correspondent for the New York VVorld, and
his first letter, “The Battle of Five Forks,” to which his name was appended, made him
a prompt reputation. He followed it up with a series of vigorous letters, to which the dra-
matic element gave novelty, reciting all the great tableaux at the close of the war, the burn-
ing of Richmond, the assassination of the President and its retribution, and the disbandment
of the great armies. He was invited also to lecture in the leading cities and to contribute
to their presses.

For the ensuing six years he was probably the most fertile newspaper correspondent in
the language, appearing on the spot of every great transaction at home or abroad, the
Prusso-Austrian war, the Great Exhibition, and the disenthralment of Venice. Meantime,
in three winter courses, he lectured nearly two hundred nights, and publishedﬁve books.
His ﬂuency of description and rapidity of movement exceeded even the credit they obtained
for him, so that he wrote under pseudonyms to avoid the imputation of “ writing himself out.”

In 1867, on the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, Mr. Townsend selected VVashington city
as his headquarters, and conducted the political correspondence of six journals at the same
time. His success here was commensurate with his previous enterprise; perhaps his most
notable letters were those bearing the signature of “Swede,” in the Cincinnati Commercial.

Since 1868 he l1as been in the exclusive employment of the Cl’iic-ago Tribune, the leading
newspaper of the Northwest, writing both editorial and correspondence, the latter over the
signature of “Gath.”

In addition to his newspaper work,—-which has included at different times the editor-
ship of two literary papers, the New York Citizen and the Washington Capital, Mr. Town-
send has written a vast deal of private composition for mercantile enterprises and addresses
for colleges and societies.

His most widely known letters are the Battle of Five Forks, the Entrance of Victor Em-
manuel into Venice, the Batt1e'of Gettysburg, the narrative of the John Brown raid, and
the keen personal sketches of public men in the “ G-atlr” letters.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 423

Mr. Townsend’s separate publications, in book form, are the following: Campaigns of a.
Non-Combatant and his Romaunt abroad during the War, a series of sketches of Virginia. in
the War of Secession, intended to convey the impressions of a novice upon the social, farm-
side, and byplay features of warfare _; The Story of the Conspiracy against the Lives of the
Executive Officers of the United States in 1865, composed of letters taken from the New York
World, written freshly in the days of the assassination; The Real Life of Abraham Lin-
coln; The New World compared with the Old, a description of the American Government,
its institutions, and enterprises, and the corresponding features of European Governments,
England and France particularly, a book of more than 700 octavo pages; Lost Abroad, a
romaunt and tale of American character in Europe during our Civil War, about 500 pages;
Poems, chieﬂy studies in verse and idyllic pieces upon the scenery of the Chesapeake, con-
taining ﬁfty pieces; A History of the Administrations, in two large volumes, contracted for.
but unﬁnished.

Alexander C. Wilson.

. ALEXANDER C. WILSON, 1824 ————-, the London manager of the New
York Associated Press, has reached his present position through the usual
stages ofournalism, as editor, contributor, and correspondent. He is, like
Mr. Townsend, a graduate of the Philadelphia High-School.

Mr. Wilson was born at Trenton, N. J., son of James J. Wilson, a popular journalist and
politician of that day. Young Wilson received such instruction as the schools a.t Trenton
afforded, until, at the age of ﬁfteen, he went to Philadelphia, and entered the Central High-
School of that city, then under the supervision of Prof. A. D. Bache. Mr. Wilson studied law
in the office of Peter McCall, of Philadelphia, and was admitted to the bar i11 1845. While
waiting for practice, he beguiled his leisure by contributions to Park Benjamin’s “New
World ; ” and after the experience of a few weeks was invited to replace that gentleman in
the editorship.

Soon after, he removed to Belvidere, N. J., with the intention of uniting the practice of his
profession with the conduct of a weekly journal, but relinquished the project on the invita-
tion of Henry J. Raymond to become associate editor of the New York Times. He remained
in the Times, as writer of leaders, and as general manager, for several years.

Needing rest, with health impaired by labor, Mr. Wilson withdrew from active work, con-
tributing still, however, to the Times, to Harper’s, the Atlantic Monthly, the Independent,
and other periodicals, as strength and leisure permitted; never, however, over his own
signature.

In l866, Mr. James ‘W. Simonton having undertaken the task of reorganizing the system
of the New York Associated Press, invited Mr. Wilson to visit Europe, and so modify the
machinery on that side of the ocean, as to adapt it to the conditions imposed by the successful
laying of the Atlantic Cable. This task accomplished, Mr. Wilson has since remained in
London in charge of the European service of the Associated Press.

Vvhitelavv Reid.

WHITELAW REID, 1839 , Editor-in-Chief of the New York Trib-
une, ﬁrst made his mark in literature as a newspaper Correspondent, under
the signature of Agate.

Mr. Reid was born in Xenia, Ohio, son of Robert Charlton Reid, an elder in the Cameronian
Covenanting Church. Young Reid, after passing through the Xenia Academy, graduated
with high honors at Miami University, in 1856. Immediately after graduating he became

424 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

editor and proprietor of the Xenia News. He is next found on the staff of the Cincinnati
Gazette. He represented the Gazette in Columbus during the meeting of the Legislature,
his letters appearing under the name of Agate. His strong, racy English, his courage and
energy, his ﬁne faculties of observation, marked him as a model correspondent, and at the
ﬁrst outbreak; of the war he was designated to accompany the Ohio troops in their march
11pon VVestern Virginia. Returning to Cincinnati, he began to. write editorials for the
Gazette, and continued for some time in that employment, with occasional interruptions
of ﬁeld work when there was anything especially worth reporting. He was present at Fort
Donelson, and went up the Tennessee River to Pittsburg Landing with our advance. He
was the only correspondent on the ﬁeld in that terrible scene of slaughter, to report which
he rose from a sick-bed. He passed the fearful night between the two days of battle among
the private soldiers on the bluff, and slept the next night on the victorious ﬁeld in the tent
of Gen. Lew Wallace.

With the prestige of his Western achievements in journalism, Mr. Reid came to Washing-
ton, and took charge of the Gazette bureau in that city. He distinguished himself at once
by his bold, incisive, and energetic correspondence. Among all the pens that made and un-
made reputations in Newspaper Row, in those stirring days, there was none more dreaded
and more courted than that ‘of.-“Agate.” From a certain ascetic habit of thought, which
may, perhaps, be derived from his severe and conscientious ancestry, he was always more
ready to criticise than to praise, always more eager in attack than in defence.

The routine work of his Washington life was varied by occasional resuniptions of the note-
book and saddle. He saw and vividly reported the battle of Fredericksburg, the second Bull
Run, and Gettysburg. I-lis political services and his scholarly tastes were at once recognized
by an appointment as Librarian of the House of Representatives.

-VVhen the war ended, l\/I1‘. Reid, whose health had become somewhat impaired by unremit-
ting labor, and who was one of those who believed in the possibility of a genuine peace, and
in the complete restoration of the South, gave evidence of his faith by removing to Louisiana,
and engaging, in company with General Herron, of Iowa, in the culture of cotton. They
planted two thousand ﬁve hundred acres of land, embracing three farms, and employing
three hundred hands. The year of 1865 was a disastrous one for planters, but in spite of this
the two young Northerners managed their affairs with such skill and prudence that they
closed their operations without loss. Mr. Reid employed the next year in writing two
books: the one, After the War, gave a most complete and graphic account of the condition
of the South in the years 1865-6; and the other, Ohio in the War (2 vols., 8vo, 1000 pages
each), besides being an eloquent tribute to his native State, was prepared with such pains-
taking and elaborate research as to form a valuable addition to the history of the epoch.

Mr. Reid, who had by this time become a co-proprietor of the Gazette, passed the greater
part of two years on his old homestead near Xenia, engaged in literary pursuits; and in the
summer of 1868, his health being entirely re-established, he came to New York, at the per-
sonal invitation of Mr. Greeley, and assumed an editorial position on the Tribune. He was
promoted the following year to the chair of Managing Editor, and on the death of Mr. Gree-
ley became lllditor-in-Chief. The Tribune under Mr. Reid’s auspices eclipsed all its former
reputation, and became one of the leadingjournals of the world.

“ It was only when cha1'ged with the administration of a great journal that the highest
qualities of Mr. Rei<l’s talents were developed. He had achieved gratifying successes in all
his preliminary pursuits, but evidently attained his true ﬁeld as manager of the Tribune.
His knowledge of human nature, his capacity to see at a glance what a man is good for, and
to put the round pegs with unerring accuracy in the round holes ; his impatient rapidity of
decision ; his instinct for news, which is like the nose of a bloodhound, and his capacity for
compelling the respect and esteem of those with whom he is brought into relationmall
mark him out as the predestined administrator of a great daily newspaper. If he were not
so valuable where he is, one might sometimes regret that his absorbing office duties leave
him comparatively so little leisure for editorial writiiig. But he is a facile and singularly rapid

James W. Sirnonton.

JAMES W. SIMONTON, 1824 -—-—, Manager of the New York Associated
Press, has been an active journalist, in various capacities, as reporter, cor-
respondent, editor, and manager, since he was twenty-one years of age.

Mr. Simonton was born in Columbia County, N. Y. He was reared in New York city, and
educated in its public schools.

,At twenty~one years of age he entered upon journalism as law reporter for a city news-
paper, at $5 per week. i _ '

During the ﬁrst year of President P0lk’s administration he went to Washington as a 1nem-
ber of the sen1i—oﬂ"1cial staff of United States Senate reporters. Subsequently he joined the
staff of the New York Courier and Enquirer, ——of which General J. Watson Webb was pro-
prietor and Henry J. Raymond the working editor,——writing for it sketches of Congres-
sional proceedings and debates during the session, and fulﬁlling the duties of an assistant
editor under Mr. Raymond during the recess.

In the autumn of 1850, he proceeded to California, under the patronage and with the ad-
vice and active aid of Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, Millard Fillmore,
and other distinguished men of that day, to establish a Whig paper at the capital of the new
State. ’J‘l1e ﬁeld being occupied by another party before his arrival on the scene, Mr. Simon-
ton accepted an engagement on the San Francisco Courier——the ﬁrst Whig paper estab-
lished on the Paciﬁc coast; but after editing it for three months he returned to New York,
and resumed his place on the Courier and Enquirer, as night-editor. . g

In September, 1851, he resigned, in order to join Mr. Raymond in establishing the New
York Times, -——the capitalists who furnished the money for that enterprise having set aside
a portion of stock in his name, to be awarded whenever he should be ready to take it at
cost, which he subsequently did.

His former experience in Washington soon led to his transfer to that ﬁeld, where for seven
years he had charge of the Times’ correspondence, —— during a period of surpassing political
and national interest.

Too independent to be a mere partisan, his letters were nevertheless always earnest, bold,
and emphatic in support of the opponents of slavery extension during the memorable strug-
gle attending and succeeding the repeal of “the Missouri Co1npro1nise.” His Washington
career was also marked by earnest and incessant war upon the lobby and upon Congressional
corruption generally. In 1857, one of his letters 011 this subject led to an investigation by
the House of Representatives, resulting in a report recornniending the expulsion of four
niembers of that body, the evidence against three of them being given by witnesses whom
Mr. Simonton named to the Committee.

Having refused to give the names of other members, whose conﬁdential conimunications
led himto suspect them of corruption which he had no evidence to prove, Mr. Simonton
was brought to the bar of the House to answer for contempt. In a personal address to the
House, he ﬁrmly maintained his position, declining to violate the professional conﬁdence

-reposed in him; and for his contumacy was ordered into custody of the Sergeant-at-arms,

where he remained for about three weeks, and was ﬁnally discharged without having re-
sponded to the disputed question.

36*

426 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

During the recesses of Congress he was usually employed in editorial writing on the
Times.

In 1858, when Albert Sydney Johnston’s army was sent to Utah, to subject the Mormons
to Federal authority, Mr. Simonton went with the trooﬁps, and spent several months in writ-
ing up the Mormon question for the New York‘Times, and also for the London Times.

In 1859, he returned to San Francisco, where he bought a half interest in the San Fran-
cisco Bulletin, and became its editor, of which, as also of the San Francisco lllorning Call,
he is still one-third owner.

At the breaking out of the war he was again at Washington, writing for the Bulletin, and
the Times; and since then——-with the exception of some ﬁfteen months spent in European
travel-—he has been constantly engaged in the active duties of his profession.

In the autumn of 1866, Mr. Simonton was suddenly called to_ the management of the
Associated Press, the wide-reaching and complicated organization through which the tele-
graphic news of all the world is collected for and distributed to the Press (with slight excep-
tions) of the entire United States and of Canada. This responsible position he still holds,
superintending at the same time the Eastern and European interests of his California news-
papers, while his partners take care of them on the Pacific.

The New York Associated Press.

THE ASSOCIATED PRESS is simply a partnership for the collection of
news, and consists of the proprietors of the New York Herald, Tribune,
Times, VVorld, Journal of Commerce, Sun, and Express. These journalists
own the Institution, and theoretically control its affairs, though its details,
in fact, are managed chieﬂy by its General Agent (or Superintendent) act-
ing under the immediate direction of an Executive Committee, to whom the
General Agent appeals for advice when necessary.

Special agents are appointed in the chief cities of the United States, subject to the General
Agent, and responsible to him. Besides these, there are hundreds of smaller cities and
towns where the local press is charged with the duty of acting as agents of the New York
Association. The duties of these subordinate agents are, ﬁrst, to collect and forward to the
general agency the news of their respective localities; and, second, to receive the tele-
graphic news supplied by the New York ofﬁce, and distribute the same to the press of their
vicinity. - '

The Association has its agents also in Europe and China, on the Paciﬁc Coast, in Central
and South America, the West Indies, and the British Provinces of North America; every-
Where, in fact, whence it is desirable to receive news by telegraph.

Thus the news of the world is concentrated at New York, primarily for the use of the As-
sociated Press journals i11 that city. But the Association, having thus obtained the news,
supplies it for a per centage of its cost, in such quantities as may be desired, to avast number
of journals all over the United States——from Maine on the North Atlantic to Texas on the
Gulf of Mexico, and to California on the Paciﬁc, and also to the Press of the Canadas.

With slight exceptions, the news is all sent to New York ﬁrst, and thence distributed in
every direction, according to the wants of each section; the Association agents collecting
the assessments (generally ﬁxed in amount per week, and graduated according to the im-
portance of the city or town where used), deducting local expenses therefrom, and remitting
the balance to the General Agent at New York.

The chief exception to this plan is that of the Western Associated Press, which collects
the news of the North-western States, from Ohio to the Missouri river, and delivers the same
to an agent of the parent institution of New York, located at Cincinnati, Ohio. The Western

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 4127

Association, too, receives the news of the rest of the world at New York, where its own
reporter condenses the same for transmission to the West.

The Press of New England, and the Interior Press of New York State, also have their re-
porters at the Central Agency, to make up and forward the news to their respective em-
ployers. The California Press have an agent of their own at Chicago, and the Press of the
South have one at the central point, Washington, to perform similar service for their respec-
tive sections.

By arrangement with the telegraph companies, the distribution of news from New York,
Washington, and Cleveland, is made simultaneously to all points desired to be served in a
given section. Take the New England service as an illustration. At regular hours, agreed
upon by contract, a main wire between New York and Boston is put in telegraphic commu-
nication with every city and town in New England which is entitled to the report; then, by a
single manipulation in New York, the same message is sent simultaneously to all of them ; an
operator at each receiving station taking it off for local use. The same plan, substantially,
is pursued throughout the country.

All this involves an expenditure of a considerable sum of money. The total disburse-
ments of the New York Associated Press may be estimated in round numbers at $500,000 per
annum. The expenditures of the Western Associated Press, probably amount to $150,000 per
annum more. This, be it remembered, is for the single item of collecting a11d distributing
telegraphic news of the Associated Press. All the great dailies of New York, Philadelphia,
Boston, and the larger cities of the Northwestern States, supplement the Associated news
with “special” despatches, upon which each journal expends a sum probably much larger
than its share of Associated Press bills. The charges on such “specials” are settled directly
between the oﬂices using them and the telegraph companies, and therefore do not appear in
the expenditures of the Association.

The Associated Pressagents are rigidly restricted to reporting simple facts ; always dis-
tinctly giving as “ rumor ” anything deemed of suﬂicient importance to notice at all, unless
it is well authenticated. Opinions, by telegraph, are religiously tabooed; and the agent who
ventures to p11t them upon the wires is sure to repent of his rashness as soon as his superior
oﬂicer has time to communicate with him. The special correspondents —each catering for
the particular journal to which he is attached —— are restricted to no such rule, but travel
unfettered in the realms of fancy, speculation, and gossip. The total cost of telegrams to a
leading journal in New York city may be estimated at from $75,000 to $100,000 per annum.

The Associated Press machinery is necessarily quite complex; nevertheless, so well organ-
ized is the system, that, when in competent and trustwortliy hands, it works very satisfac-
torily.- Its superintendence requires for success decided executive ability, and much jour-
nalistic taste, experience, and tact, coupled with quick perception and great industry.

The General Agent must be a good judge of news, that he may know how to direct its
judicious collection for the innumerable journals of diverse sentiments and wants which
the Association undertakes to serve. He must also be a good business man to manage
satisfactorily the ﬁnancial affairs of the Association. Without ready energy and decision,
he would inevitably become involved and lost in the intricate machinery which he manipu-
lates, and which frequently must need a prompt and steady hand for its adjustment to new
conditions and necessities. With these qualities in the General Agent, the Associated Press
system operates as regularly and smoothly as that of a well-directed post-ofﬁce department,
which in some respects it resembles.

The present General Agent, Mr. J. VV. Simonton, is a graduate of the New York Times
establishment, a journalist of large experience, who has been successful both as an editor
and a publisher, and is still a stockholder, one-third owner of the Bulletin,the leading paper
of San Francisco, Cal., and also of the San Francisco Morning Call.

The American Press have always resisted the establishment of anything akin to the Renter
system in Europe, which, they claim, leaves journalism more or less at the mercy of aprivate
corporation, with whom press service, on behalf of the general public, is made secondary

to" the service of private speculators. In 1866 a former General Agent undertook to convert
the machinery of the New York Associated Press to his own use, with a view to creating a
private American corporation similar to lteuter’s for the collection and distribution of the

news of the world. So objectionable is that system in the eyes of American newspaper pub-

lishers, that the Associated Press waged vigorous battle against their former agent, until they
had beaten him out of the ﬁeld, at a cost for the war of perhaps $50,000.

Charles Carleton’ Coffin.

CHARLEs CARLETQN COEEIN, 1821 , VVar Correspondent of the
Boston Journal, has had an experience like that of many of the other most
vigorous journalists of the day,—having had to Work his Way up from
small beginnings, and in the face of many adverse circumstances.

‘Mr. Coffin was born at Boscawen, N. H., the birthplace of the late Senator Fessenden, and
of Gen. John A. Dix, and within ﬁve miles of the birthplace of Daniel Webster. Mr. Coﬁin
was a far1ner’s son, and he remained upon the farm until the age of twenty-one, with very
limited means of education. After reaching his majority, he contrived to make up in some
measure for these deﬁciencies, by studying at night, after the work of the day was over.

In 1845 he commenced civil engineering, and was engaged for three years in this manner.
He then purchased a farm, but his health failing he turned his attention to the Fire Alarm
Telegraph.

His ﬁrst attempts at writing were for seine of the 1\"ew Hampshire papers. In 1851 he
began writing for the Boston press. He gave to his pieces at this time much study and
labor, not unfrequently rewriting an article ten times, before sending it to the printer. He
found it difficult, however, to obtain a situation on a newspaper. “ Don’t want anybody”
was the stereotyped reply. Determined to become a journalist, he began writing editorials
and reports for the Boston Journal without pay. After continuing this for three months,
he was enabled to earn by his services from $10 to $15 a week. From 1855 to 1860, he held
various positions as reporter and editor on the Journal, Atlas, and Traveller.

In 1858 he gave to the public his first separate publication, entitled the Great Commercial
Prize. In 18-16, while engaged in civil engineering, and while studying the physical features
of the continent, he saw that there was but one great river emptying into the Paciﬁc Ocean,
the Columbia, and that there were but two gateways to the western side of the continent,
the Bay of San Francisco and Puget Sound. He saw that a great highway must one day span
the continent between the lakes and the Paciﬁc Ocean. A few years later his convictions
of the importance of a railway were so great, and the prize to be graspe<l~— the trade of
Asia——so important, that he advocated through his pen the importance of a railway over
the route wherethe Northern Paciﬁc is now being constructed, and he put forth accordingly
in 1858 the pamphlet already named, urging those views. It fell dead upon the public, and
the author was laughed at as a visionary enthusiast.

At the breaking out of the war, Mr. Coiﬁn began a correspondence for the Boston Journal,

the one side, and Austria on the other, he left home for the seat of war at ten days’ notice,
as a correspondent of the Boston Journal.

The war having ended,‘he travelled through nearly all the countries of Europe, attended
the Great Exposition, was present at the coronation of Francis Joseph as king of Hungary;

Arabian Gulf to Bombay; travelled through India, China, ascending the Yangtze to the
heart of the empire ; visited Japan; sailed thence to San Francisco, and completed the transit
by stage across the continent, the Paciﬁc Railroad not having been completed. He was
absent two and :1 half years, and was accompanied by his wife in all his travels.

In 1869 he published Our New Way Round the World. _

During the war and since his return, he has been upon the platform, lecturing upon
various themes connected with what he has seen.

Robert Barry Coffin.

ROBERT BARRY COFFIN, 1826 , the author of several popular vol.-
umes, ﬁrst came into notice as associate. editor, with Morris and Willis, of
the Home Journal.

Mr. Coﬂin was born at Hudson, N. Y. His great.-grandfather, Alexander Coﬂin, who died
in 1839, in the ninety-ninth year of his age, was one of the thirteen original proprietors,
from the island of Nantucket, who made the settlement of Hudson, in 1783. His father,
VVilliam Henry, was for many years postmaster at Hudson, and died in 1837, leaving a widow
and ﬁve children, of whom Robert B. was the eldest. He received a classical, though not a
collegiate education. In 1846 he entered an English importing house as a clerk in New
York city, where he remained several years. In 1852, in connection with a younger brother,
he opened a bookstore in Elmira, N. Y. His ﬁrst contributions to the press were in 1845,
when he wrote a series of sketches for the Rural Repository, a literary weekly published at
Hudson, since which time he has been a frequent contributor to the magazines and journals
of the day. In 1858 he was invited by Messrs. Morris & Willis, of the Home Journal, to
become its associate editor, and removed to New York. He remained on the Home Journal
until the autumn of 1862, when he accepted a position in the New York Custom House, i_n
which position he continued through several administrations. Latterly he has been the
literagy editor of the Eastern State Journal, published at White Plains, Westchester County,

8 N. Y,’ and has also renewed his connection, as contributor, with the Home Journal.

M1“ Coﬂin is now residing at Fordham, N. Y., in a small cottage, purchased a few years
ago, where, in the companionship of his wife and children, and surrounded by books and
pictures, he leads a quiet, studious life, seldom going to town more than once or twice a
week.

His works, published under the name of “Barry Gray,” are the following: My Married
Life at Hillside; Matrimonial Infelicities; Out of Town, a Rural Episode; Cakes and Ale at
Woodbine; Castles in the Air and other Phantasies; Who is the Heir? Left in the Lurch ;
Ale : in prose and verse, irivately printed. Mr. Barry also superintended a new edition of the
works of Lucretia Maria Davidson, and wrote the ,introductory Biographical Sketch.

ISAAC PRAY, 1813 —-v——, is a native of Massachusetts. He studied at Harvard and Amherst.
He has been editor of several papers and magazines, and has contributed largely to others.
He is also the author of a few dramas and burlesques printed for private circulation, and
has published two volumes of poems. .'l‘wo of the acts in The Corsican Brothers are by him.
In 1855 he published the Memoirs of James Gordon Bennett.

-430 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Curtis Guild.

CURTIS GUILD, 1828 —---~—, founder, editor, and proprietor of the Boston
Commercial Bulletin, has a name for wit and spice almost equal to that of
Prentice of the Louisville Journal. Mr. Guild has published one volume,
and has contributed a good deal to the magazines. But he is most known
as a journalist.

Mr. Guild wa.s born in Boston. His father was a Boston merchant and a graduate of Har-
vard University. Young Guild was of a literary turn, and designed going through the Univer-
sity, but owing to ﬁnancial reverses, such a course was found impossible. He was therefore
given the best education that could be had at the public schools, with some excellent pri-
vate instruction, and in 1844, at the age of sixteen, commenced mercantile life in a mer-
chant’s writing-room.

After three years experience among cotton bales, foreign cargoes, and merchandise, dur-

,ing which time he was frequently a contributor to the papers of the day, he obtained, in

1847, a position more congenial to his tastes in the Boston Daily Journal newspaper estab-
lishment. From that time he became a frequent contributor to what were then known as
the literary papers of the day, as well as to the columns of the paper he was connected with.

In 1849 Mr. Guild accepted a position in the Boston Daily Traveller, and soon after wrote
also for some years for various newspapers and magazines, chief among which may be men-
tioned the New York Knickerbocker from 1850 to ’54, then under the conduct of Louis
Gaylord Clark.

In 1856 Mr. Guild became one of the proprietors of the Boston Traveller, that journal buy-
ing out and consolidating into one establishment the Boston Daily Atlas and the Boston
Chronicle. The ﬁnancial crisis of 1857-8 was disastrous to the Traveller’s plans, and a dis-
solution of the partnership occurred in the latter year, Mr. Guild disposing of his interest in
the concern.

On the 1st of January, 1859, he founded the Boston Commercial Bulletin, starting with
the intention of what was thought the Quixotic enterprise of making commerce, man ut'a.c-
tures and business, bright and interesting to the general reader. Mr. Guild’s enterprise
was a complete success, and the Bulletin in 1872 is one of the most inﬂuential and largely
circulated papers in the country. As editor-ln~chief, Mr. Guild contributed largely to every
department of the Bulletin, his happiest efforts, however, being those calling for the exercise
of descriptive power. His sketches are always very popular, and his humorous writings,
contributed anonymously to a department of the Bulletin known as the Spice of Life, have
rivalled those of Prentice of the Louisville Journal in popularity.

In 1867 Mr. Guild made an extended tour in Europe, and contributed a series of sketches
of the same to his paper, under the title of Over the Ocean. These were received with such
favor that they were afterwards prepared in a handsome octavo volume and published in
1871 by Lee & Shepard of Boston. The book was received with still more marked favor, and
the publishers pronounce it the most popular volume of travels ever issued from their press.

Mr. Guild is still an industrious writer. His contributions in past years to the magazines
were both in prose and poetry, but of late years have been chieﬂy of the former, and of that
description which skilled journalists ﬁnd to pay the best. Few practical journalists have
any ambition to be “ the author of a book ; ” they argue, that, where they reach one reader
through the pages of a book, they reach twenty in the columns of a newspaper.

EEoM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 431

Edvvard Eggleston.

EDWAED EeeLEs'roN, D.D., 1837 , lately editor of the New York
Independent, and now of Hearth and Home, has shown eminent ﬁtness for
the work of journalism, and has been uniformly successful in his various

enterprises in thatiline.

I Dr.iEggleston was born in Vevay, Switzerland County, Ind. He was in feeble health dur-

. ing boyhood, so as to be able to attend school very little, and that at irregular intervals. He

has not had the opportunity of a college education, but has managed in various ways to pick
up an acquaintance with the Latin and Greek, and with several modern languages (French,
Spanish, and Italian). He has given much time to the reading and study of the English
classics, which he considers the best part of his education. — He entered the ministry of the
Methodist Church in his nineteenth year, and preached for ten years in Minnesota, at St.
Paul, Stillwater, and Winona. L

A He went to Chicago in 1866, as associate editor of the Little Corporal, and in 1867 began to
edit the Sunday—Scl1ool Teacher, the circulation of which, under his management, rose in
three years from 5,000 to 30,000.

. In 1870, he went to New York as literary editor of the New York Independent, and he
was for a time the superintending editor of that important paper. He has since become
editor of Hearth and Home.

Dr. Eggleston’s labors, both with his pen and his tongue, have been mainly in the line of
Sunday-Schools, and few men living have given more effective aid than he to this great
cause. In a Sunday-«School Institute, or in a Convention, he has no superior, either as a
lecturer or as a conductor.

. His published works are the following: Sunday-School Conventions and Institutes;
Sunday-School Manual; Mr. Blake’s Walking Stick, a Christmas Story for Boys and Girls;
The Book of Queer Stories. All these books have been popular, and have sold largely. Of
his short stories published in Scribner’s Monthly, the editor of that magazine says : “They
have been more widely copied than any recent short stories, except Bret Harte’s.”

Samuel Ireneeus Prime.

SAMUEL IRENJEUS PRIME, D. D., 1812 , is the author .of several in-
teresting volumes, but is chiefly known by his writings and labors for" the
past thirty-two years as editor of the New York Observer. I

Dr. Prime was born at Ballston, N. Y., a son of N. S. Prime, and graduated at Williams,
Mass, in the class of 1829. He studied theology at Princeton, preached for a time at Ballston
Spa, and elsewhere, but was obliged to retire from ministerial labor on account of the loss
of health. In 1840, he became connected with the New York Observer, and he has remained
in that connection ever since.

Besides his editorial writings and labors, Dr. Prime has published a considerable number
of separatevolunies : The Old White Meeting-House, or Reminiscences of a Country Congre-
gation ; Life in New York; Annals of the English Bible, an abridgment and continuation of
Anderson; ’.l‘houghts on the Death of Little Children; Travels in Europe and the East;
Letters from Switzerland; Memoirs of Rev. Nicholas Murray; The Bible in the Levant, or
The Life and Letters of the Rev. C. N. Righter; The Power of Prayer, being a History of
the Noon-day Prayer Meeting; Five Years of Prayer, with the Answers, being a continua-
tion of the previous work. '

Dr. Prime’s Letters to the Observer are usually signed Irenaeus.

.432 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Dr, Prime has a son, Rev. Wendell Prime, a Presbyterian minister in Newburgh, who has
the same Greek Testament that his father had, and his grandfather, and his g7'eat-g7'cmd-
father, and his greaz‘-g/reat-grandfather: the ﬁve generations being classically educated men,
and all but one (B. Y. P.) being Presbyterian ministers.

EDWARD DORR GRIFFIN PRIME, 1814 ——, also a son of N. S. Prime, was born at Cambridge,
N. Y., and graduated at Union College, in 1832. He studied theology at Princeton, was Ameri-
can Chaplain at Rome in 1855, and has been for some years one of the editors of the New
York Observer. _ He has written Letters for the Observer, under the signature of Eusebius.
In 1869-70, he made a journey around the world, an account of which was published in
1872, in one volume 8vo.

WILLIAM COWPER PRIME, 1825 , also a son of N. S. Prime, was born at Cambridge, N. Y.,
and graduated at Princeton, in the class of 1843. He is a lawyer by profession, but ﬁnds
time for travel and for literature. He has published Owl Creek Letters ; The Old House by
the River; Later Years; Boat Life in Egypt and Nubia; Tent Life in the Holy Land; Coins,
Medals, and Seals, Ancient and Modern ; Oh, Mother Dear, Jerusalem, The Old Hymn, its
Origin and Genealogy, etc.

Theodore Tilton.

THEoDoRE TILTON, 1885 , is the author of several volumes which
have commanded attention. His chief work, however, thus far, has been in
the line of journalism, for many years in the New York Independent, and
now in his own paper, The Golden Age.

Mr. Tilton was born in the city of New York, and graduated at Yale. He was connected
with the Independent from,1856 to 1871, and during the latter part of that time Was its
editor. In 1871 he began an enterprise of his own, The Golden Age. -

Mr. Tilton has published the following works: The American Board and American Sla-
very; Memorial of ‘Mrs. Browning; The Fly; Golden-haired Gertrude; The Two Hungry
Kittens; The King’s Ring ; The True Church; The Sexton’s Tale and Other Poems.

Mrs. Svvisshelm.

MRS. JANE G. SWISSHELM, 181.5 ———, has been the most energetic and the
most successful of those of her sex Who have undertaken the hazardous ex-
periment of journalism. The story of her struggles and of her resolution
in the face of dangers borders often upon the marvellous.

Mrs. Swisshelm was born in Pittsburg, the daughter of Mr. Thomas Cannon. Both father
and mother were Scotch-Irish, and Covenanters, and in the Covenanting Church Jane was
brought up. -

In 1836, she was married to Mr. Swisshelm, a Methodist. After marriage, Mr. Swisshelm,
believing the husband to be the “head of the wife even as. Christ is the head of the Church,”
insisted that Jane should give up her Calvinistic notions, go to campsmeeting, and “preach.”
Jane, believing that the Bible enjoined on all women silence in public, kept it. But the
command, “Open thy mouth to the dumb,” had no mark of being exclusively addressed to
women, so she concluded to speak through the press.

In 1845 she began writing for The Spirit of Liberty. In 1846-47, she wrote a series
of articles for that paper, and for the Pittsburg Commercial Journal, on the Property
Rights of Married Women. These articles are believed to have been mainly instrumental

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 438

in leading the Pennsylvania Legislature, at the session of 1847-48, to pass its ﬁrst la.w grant-
ing to married women the right to hold property. Edwin M. Stanton, then a lawyer in
Steubenville, called on her, after the Phssage of the law, and congratulated her on the suc-
cess of “her” measure. ‘

In 1844,’45,’4.6, Mrs. Swisshelm wrote occasional articles for Neal’s Gazette and The Dollar
Newspaper, under the name of Jeannie Deans, which were well received.

But the Covenanting blood in her veins beat to more stirring themes ; and when the Mexi-
can war broke out, she wrote for the Commercial Journal of Pittsburg a series of articles
in opposition to the war, which created a perfect storm-

At the close of the Mexican war she began The Pittsburg Saturday Visitor, on her own

account, in December, 1847, and continued to edit and publish it until 1851, when it was sold,
and merged in The Family Journal and Visitor.

In the winter of 1849-50, she spent some weeks in Washington, D. 0., as a correspondent for
the New York Tribune, as well as for her own paper. Here her indignation was roused at
what she considered Daniel Webster’s treason against liberty; and to weaken the inﬂuence
of his great name, she published an account of his private life, which raised a furious tem-
pest. But believing that her statements were true and capable of proof, and that their pub-
lication was necessary for the protection of the oppressed, she boldly held her ground, and
was afterwards publicly congratulated with having “ killed oﬁ” Daniel Webster” as a Presi-
dential candidate. - ‘

Mrs. Swisshelm was the ﬁrst to suggest and urge, through the Tribune, the establishment
of a Court of Claims, a measure which has since become a law.

Her only book is a series of Letters to Country Girls, which appeared ﬁrst in The Visitor,
and were afterwards published in book form.

In 1857, Mrs. Swisshelm went to St. Cloud, Minn., to reside with her brother-in-law, Gen.
H. Z. Mitchell. Here she was induced to start a newspaper, “The St. Cloud Visitor.” The
paper gave offence to one of the leading proprietors of the town, who, with some confeder-
ates, broke into the oﬁice at night, destroyed the press and scattered the type, and left on
the table a letter threatening personal violence if she persisted. She did persist, and tri-
umphed, but through agony worthy ofa Cameronian. Her paper, its name changed, became
the leading organ of Minnesota politics, and contributed largely towards giving to that
State its political character. -

During the war, Mrs. Swisshelm was employed in the Quartermaster’s department at
Washington, but was dismissed by President Johnson for disrespectful language towards
him in The Reconstructionist, a weekly paper which she started in Washington. Since that
time, she has lived in the vicinity of Pittsburg. «

When her life was threatened by the mob, at the time of breaking up her press in Min-
nesota, Mrs. Swisshelm felt that the mouth of the dumb was at length opened; she harangued
them openly and deﬁantly, and since that time has done much in the way of public lectur-
ing, chieﬂy on political topics.

Though an early and persistent advocate of justice to her sex, she has always stood aloof
from what is known as the Women’s Rights movement, believing it to be unwise, and likely,
by its extravagant demands, to put back immediate practicable reforms. She was very
earnest in denouncing the Bloomer costume.

V. THE HUMORISTS.
C. F. Br>ovvne,—-—“A1°ternu.s Ward.”

CHARLEs_ FOSTER BROWNE, 1836-1867, became widely known, both in
Emgland and America, by his humorous conception of Artemus Ward, “the

37' 20

484 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

genial showman.” So complete was his conception of this character, and
his representation of it in his writings, that it has become diﬂicult for the
public to realize that Artemus Ward was not a real, historical personage,
or that there was behind him any such being as the writer, Mr. C. F. Browne.
Artemus Ward is to us the living man, Mr. Browne the myth. This species
of writing does not belong to the highest kind of art. Yet there is in it a
peculiar dramatic power, as clearly creative as anything in Shakespeare.

Mr. Browne was, like so many of the present day, a creation of the newspaper oﬂice. He
was born in Waterford, Me., and passed from the common school into the printing-oﬂice.
After working in various places he settled fora while in Boston, where he set type and began
to write comic sketches. He left Boston, however, for Toledo, 0., where he became local
editor, and from Toledo went to Cleveland.

It was at Cleveland, in the oﬂice of the Plaindealer, that his fame chieﬂy was made. His

-series of letters from “ Artemus Ward, showman,” giving absurd descriptions of the remark-

able animals in this imaginary travelling menagerie, and interspersed with keen Witticisms,
sly hits, and shrewd plays of humor, attracted general attention.

About the breaking out of the war, he became acontributor to Vanity Fair, and soon after
began his celebrated course of lectures.

In 1863 he visited California, taking the Overland route and lecturing at Salt Lake City.
In 1864, upon his return to the East, he lectured with great success upon California and the
Mormons.

In 1866 he visited England, where he contributed a number of sketches to Punch, and
lectured in London, at the Egyptian Hall. The following year, when about to embark tor
home, he died of consumption, in the thirty-second year of his age. _

Mr. Browne’s death left a void in American letters. He had endeared himself to many

friends by his genial social qualities, and to the great American public by an unfailing flow

of rich humor.

Of all American humorists, Artemus Ward is the best. His lectures and sketches are rarely
weak, and never vulgar—a trait which many of his imitators would do well to heed more
closely. His purposely grotesque spelling heightens the effect of his sayings, but is not
essential to them. Any one of his compositions could be set up in the ordinary style and
not miss its mark. _

His works have been collected intoithe following volumes: Artemus Ward,_his Book;
Artemus Ward, his Panorama; Artemus Ward among the Mormons; Artemus Ward among
the Fenians; Artemus Ward in London. The work entitled Artemus Ward in England was
published after his death, and contains an entertaining biographical sketch.

When we review these volumes, we are struck with the number of sayings an_d_ turns of
thought that have already beconie the common property of the author's countrymen at
large. Many of the sketches, written when the war was at its height, express in the most
humorous way the nation's trials and perplexities. The satire is not biting, the humor is

very genial, and there is below all a substratum of shrewd American sense and philosophy ‘

that give to Artemus Ward’s essays a permanent value. How exquisitely has the Showman
hit off the confused and jarring notions of the average American upon the great emancipa-
tion question by those celebrated essays on the negro! How true the satire in the descrip-
tion of the self-sacriﬁcing patriot who sends all his wife’s and all his own relatives to the war!
Artemus was perhaps less successful as an actual lecturer than as a writer of imaginary
lectures and sketches. His delivery was monotonous,and the audience had to rely for their
entertainment solely upon the substance of the discourse, the absurdly novel treatment of
the subject, the unexpected turns and twists of thought that upset all their calculations.
Many of the genial Showman’s most genial sayings were wholly impromptu. One of the

ERoM‘185O TO THE PRESENT TIME. 435

most famous was the answer he returned to an invitation to lecture in California. A Well-
known theatre manager in San Francisco, having heard of the rising young lecturer, decided
to engage him for a course of lectures. As the season was almost at hand, and no time to be
lost, he telegraphed from San Francisco to Artemus in New York, the message, “What will
you take for forty nights in California? Answer immediately.” To this unexpected in-
vitation Artemus sent, also by telegraph and with equal gravity, the now famous reply:
“Brandy and Water! ” Thejoke was immediately noised throughout all California, so that
when Artemus did subsequently visit the State, lecturing on his own account, he found his
fame already secured. ‘

Mr. Brown has left us no humorous creations except that of the inimitable “genial show-
man.” It would be idle, of course, to speculate at length upon what he might have achieved
had his life not been cut so suddenly short. But the chances were that he would have
produced other character-creations worthy to be placed by the side of Artemus, and those
of the great English humorists.

AT THE TOMB OF SHAKSPEARE.

MR. PUNCH, MY DEAR Sm, —I’ve been lingerin by the tomb of the lamentid Shakspeare.

It is a success.

I do not l1es’tate to pronounce it as such.

You may make any use of this opinion that you see ﬁt. If you think its publication will
subswerve the cause of litteratoor, you may publicate it.

I told my wife Betsy when I left home that I should go to the birthplace of the orthur of
Ofhellwr and other Plays. She said that as long as I kept out of Newgate she didn’t care where
I went. “ But,” I said, “ don’t you know he was the greatest Poit that ever lived? Not one
of these common poits, like that young idyit who writes verses to.our daughter, abowt the

Roses as growses and the Breezes as blowses -——but a Boss Poit-—a1so a philospher, also a

man who knew a great deal about everything.
‘She was packing my things at the time, and the only answer she made was to ask me if
I was goin to carry both of my red ﬂannel night-caps.

436 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Yes. I’ve been to Stratford onto the Avon, the Birthplace of Shakspeare. Mr. S. is now
no more. He’s been dead over three hundred (300) years. The peple of his native town are
justly proud of him. They cherish his mem’ry, and‘ them as sell picturs of his birthplace,
etc., make it prof ’tible cherishin it. Almost everybody buys a pictur to put into their Albiom.

As I stood gazing on the spot where Shakspeare is s’posed to have fell down on the ice
and hurt hisself when a boy (this spot cannot be bought, —-the town authorities say it shall
never be taken from Stratford,) I wondered if three hundred years hence picturs of my birth-
place will be i11 demand? Will the peple of my native town be proud of me three hundred
years? I guess they won’t short of that time, because they say the fat man weighing 1000
younds which I exhibited there was stuffed out with pillers and cushions, which he said
one very hot day in July, “ Oh bother, I can’t stand this,” and commenced pullin the pillers
out from 11nder his weskit, and heavin ’em at the audience. I never saw a man lose ﬂesh
so fast in my life. The audience said I was a pretty man to come chiselin my own towns-
men in that way. I said, “Do not be angry, feller-citizens. I exhibited him simply as a
work of art. I simply wished to show you that a man could grow fat without the aid of cod-
liver oil.” But they wouldn’t listen to me. They are a low and grovelin set of peple,

who excite a feelin of loathin in every brest where lorfty emotions and original idees have

3. bidin place. _

I stopped at Leamington a few minits on my way to Stratford onto the Avon, and a very
beautiful town it is. I wentinto a shoe shop to make a purchis, and as I entered I sawover
the door those dear familiar words, “By Appintment: H. R. H ;” and I said to the man,

“ Squire, excuse me, but this is too much. I have seen in London four hundred boot and shoe -

shops by appintment: II. R. H.; and now y0u’7'e at it. It is simply onpossible that the
Prince can wear 400 pair of boots. Don’t tell me,” I said in a voice choked with emotion-—
“oh, do not tell that you also make boots for him. Say slippers—say that you menda
boot now and then for him; but do not tell that you make ’em reg‘lar for him.”

The man smilt, and said I didn’t understand these things. He said I perhaps had not
noticed in London that dealers in all sorts of articles was By Appintment. I said, “ O. had-n.‘t
I?” Then a sudden thought ﬂasht over me. “I have it!” I said; “ when the Prince
walks through a street he no doubt looks at the shop-windows.”

The man said, “ No doubt.” I

“ And the enterprisin tradesman,” I continnerd, “the moment the Prince gets out of sight,
rushes frantically and has a tin sign painted, By Appintment, H. R. H.! It is a beautiful, a
great idee 1 ” .

I then bought a pair of shoe-strings, a.nd wringin the shopman’s honest hand, I started
for the Tomb of Shakspeare in a hired'ﬂy. It lookt, however, more like a spider.

“And this,” I said, as I stood in the old church-yard at Stratford, beside a Tombstone,
“this marks the spot where lies William Shakspeare. Alarsl and this is the spot
where —— ” _

“You’ve got the Wrong grave,” said a man—a worthy villager: “ Shakspeare is buried
inside the church.” A

“ Oh,” I said, “a boy told me this was it.” The boy larfed and p11t the shillin I’d given
him into his left eye in a inglorious manner, and commenced moving backwards towards
the street.

I pursood and captered him, and after talking to him a spell in a skarcastic stile, I let
him we-nt. V

The old church was damp and chill. It was rainin. .The only person there when I en-
tered was a ﬁne, bluﬁ‘ old gentleman who was talking in a excited manner to a fashnibly-
dressed young man. “ No, Ernest Montresser,” the old gentleman said, "‘ it is idle to pursoo
this subjeck further. You can never marry my daughter. You were seen last Monday
in Piccadilly without a umbreller! I said then, as I say now, any young man as venture
out in a uncertain climit like this without a umbreller, lacks foresight, caution, strength
.)f mind, and stability; and he is not a proper person to intrust a daughter’s happiness to.”

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 437

I slapt the old gentleman on the shoulder, and I said, “You ’re right! You ’re‘ one of
those kind of men, you are — ”

He wheeled suddenly round, and in a indignant voice, said, “Go way—-go way! This
is a privit intervoo.”

I did n’t stop to enrich the old gentleman’s mind with my conversation. I sort of inf'orr.r-rl
that he was n’t inclined to listen to me, and so I went on. But he was right about the rum
breller. I ’m really delighted with this grand old country, Mr. Punch, but you must admit
that it does rain rayther numerously here. Whether this is owing to a monerkal foun of
gov’ment or not, I leave all candid and onprejudiced persons to say. I

William Shakspeare was born in Stratford in 1564. All the commentaters, Shaksperian
scholars,‘ etsetry, are agreed on this, which is about the only thing they are agreed on in
regard to him, except that his mantle has n’t fallen onto any poet or dramatist hard enough
to hurt said poet or dramatist much. And there is no doubt if those commentaters and per-
sons continner investigatin Shakspeare’s career, we shall not, in doo time, know anything
about it at all; When a mere lad little William attended the Grammer School, because, as
he said, the Grrammer School would n’t attend him. This remarkable remark, coming from
one so young and inexperunced, set peple to thinkin there might be somethin in the lad.
He subsequently wrote Hamlet and George Barnwell. When his kind teacher Went to Lon-
don to accept a position in the office of the Metropolitan Railway, little'William was chosen
by his fellow-pupils to deliver a farewell address. “ Go on, Sir,” he said, “ in a glorus career.
Be like a eagle, and soar, andthe soarer you get the more we shall be gratiﬁed! That ’s so.”

My young readers, who wish to know about Shakspeare, better get these vallyable remarks
framed.

I returned to the hotel. Meetin a young married couple, they asked me if I could direct
them to the hotel which Washington Irving used to keep? ‘

“I ’ve understood that he was onsuccessful as a lan’lord,” said the lady.

“ We ’ve understood,” said the young man, “that he busted up.”

I told ’em I was a stranger, and hurried away. They were from my country, and ond0ubt-
edly represented a thrifty Ile Well somewhere in Pennsylvany. It ’s a common thing, by
the way, for a old farmer in Pennsylvany to wake up some mornin and ﬁnd ile squirtin all
around his back yard. He sells out for ’normous price, a.nd his children put on gorgeous
harness and start on a tower to astonish peple. They succeed in doin it. Meanwhile the ile
it quirts and squirts, and Time rolls on. Let it roll.

A very nice old town is Stratford, and a capital inn is the Red Horse. Every admirer of
the great S. must go there once certinly; and to say one is n’t a admirer of him, is equv’lent
to sayin one has jest about brains enough to become a eﬂicient tinker.

Some kind person has sent me Chawceris poems. Mr. 0. had talent, but he could n’t spel.

No man has a right to be a lit’rary man onless he knows how to spel. It is a pity that _

Chawcer, who had geneyus, was so unedicated. He ’s the wuss speller I know of.
I guess I ’m through, and so I lay down my pen, which is more mightier than the sword,
but which I ’m afraid would stand a rayther slim chance beside the needle-gun.

S. L. Clemens,—“Mar°k Twain.”

SAMUEL LANGHORNE CIJEMENS, 1835 ———-, who writes under the name
of “Mark Twain,” set the whole continent in a roar. by his volume, The
Innocents‘ Abroad, giving a humorous description of a visit to the old World
by a ship-load of American excursionists.

Mr. Clemens was born in the village of Florida, Monroe County, Mo. His father failed in

business, and died, leaving him the ample world to seek his fortune in, with a slender educa-
tion and a slenderer moneyed capital to work with. He was immediately apprenticed to a
printer (age thirteen at this time), and served several years at that occupation.

At the age of sixteen he worked his way over most of the Eastern States, to see somewhat
of the world, and returned to the West at the age of eighteen, and became a steamboat pilot
on the Mississippi from St. Louis to New Orleans. (Hence his nom. de plume, —it mean t two
fathoms.)

His brother having been appointed Secretary of Nevada Territory, Mr. Clemens went to
that country with him for the sake of the trip, became fascinated with silver—1nining anal
the wild life there, and remained. He roved about the deserts and mountains for a year,
making and losing one or two triﬂing fortunes, and ﬁnally being out of money and out of
credit, accepted a reporter’s berth 011 the daily Territorial Enterprise, and blossomed into a
literary man.

After serving on the paper three years, he went to San Francisco, and reported on news-
papers there durlng a" year or more; and also began to create a local notoriety for his newly-
chosen nom de plume of “ Mark Twain.” Then he was employed to go down to the Sand-
wich Islands, and write about the sugar interest for the Sacramento Union; returned at the
end of six months and found himself famous in a small way; turned the notoriety to ac-
count by delivering lectures, and acquiring much money.

He returned East in the Spring of 1867, and published The Celebrated Jumping Frog and
Other Sketches, 200 pp. lzmo, a book which sold fairly in America and very largely in
England.

In the summer of 1867, he joined the Quaker City European and Holy Land Pleasure Ex-
cursion, was gone six months, came back and went to California to lecture. Having written
The Innocents Abroad, or the New Pilgrim’s Progress, he came East and published it in the
fall of 1869-650 pages 8vo, illustrated-—-republished in England. The sale in America
had reached in the ﬁrst two years 110,000 copies. He has in press a volume of Nevada and
Californian Experiences, of the same size and style as Innocents Abroad, and illustrated in
the same manner.

GROWING MONOTONOUS.

“ Butchered to make a Roman holyday,” sounds well for the ﬁrst seventeen or eighteen
hundred thousand times one sees it in print, but after that it begins to grow tiresome. I
ﬁnd it in all the books concerning Rome —and here latterly it reminds me of Judge Oliver.
Oliver was a young lawyer, fresh from the schools, who had gone out to the deserts of Ne-
vada to begin life, He foa..:d that country, and our ways of life there, in those early days,
different from life i--. New England or Paris. B11t he put on a woollen shirt and strapped a
navy revolver to his person, took to the bacon and beans of the country, and determined to
do in Nevada. as Nevacla did. Oliver accepted the situation so completely, that although he
must have sorrowed over manyof his trials, he never complained — that is, he never com-
plained but once. He, two others, and myself, started to the new silver mines in the Hum-
boldt Mountains — he to be Probate Judge of Humboldt County, and we to mine. The distance
was two hundred miles. It was dead of wint.er. We bought a two-horse wagon and put
eighteen hundred pounds of bacon, ﬂour, beans, blasting-powder, picks and shovels in it; we
bought two sorry-looking Mexican “ Plugs,” with the hair turned the wrong way, and more
corners on their bodies than there are on the Mosque of Omar; we hitched up and started.
It was a dreadful trip. But Oliver did not complain. The horses dragged the wagon two
miles from town and then gave out. Then we three pushed the wagon seven miles, and
Oliver moved ahead and pulled the horses after him by the bits. We complained, but Oliver
did not. The ground was frozen, and it froze our backs while we slept: the wind swept
across our faces and froze our noses. Oliver did not complain. Five daysof pushing the
wagon by day and freezing by night brought us to the bad part of the journey——-the Forty

Mile Desert, or the Great American Desert, if you please. Still this mildest—mannered
man that ever was, had not complained. We started across at eight in the morning,
bushing through sand that had no bottom; toiling all long by the wrecks of a thousand
wagons, the skeletons of ten thousand oxen; by wagon-tires enough to hoop the Washington
Monument to the top, and ox-chains enough to girdle Long Island; by human graves ; with
our throats parched always with thirst; lips bleeding from the alkali dust; hungry, perspir-
ing, and very, very Weary—— so weary that when we dropped in the sand every ﬁfty yards to

‘rest the horses we could hardly keep from going to sleep -—.no complaints from Oliver; none

the next morning at three o’clock, when we got across, tired to death. Awakened two or
three nights afterward at midnight, in a narrow canon, by the snow falling on our faces,
and appalled at the imminent danger of being “snowed in,” we harnessed up and pushed on
till eight in the morning, passed the “Divide,” and knew we were saved. No complaints.
Fifteen days of hardship and fatigue brought us to the end of the two hundred miles, and
the Judge had not complained. We wondered if anything could exasperatelhim. We built
a Humboldt house. It is done in this way. You dig a square in the steep base of the moun-
tain, and set up two uprights and top them with two joists. Then you stretch a great sheet
of “cotton domestic” from the point where the joists join the hill-side down over thejoists
to the ground; this makes the roof and the front of the mansion; the sides and back are
the dirt-walls your digging has left. A chimney is easily made by turning up one corner of
the roof. Oliver was sitting alone in this dismal den one night, by a sage-brush ﬁre, writing
poetry. He was very fond of digging poetry out of himself——or blasting it out when it
came hard. He grew uneasy and said, “Hi!——clear out from there, can‘t you! ”—from
time to time. But by and by he fell asleep where he sat, and pretty soon a mule fell down

-the chimney! The ﬁre ﬂew in every direction, and Oliver went over backwards. About ten

nights after that he recovered conﬁdence enough to go to writing poetry again. Againhe
dozed off to sleep, and again a mille fell down the chimney. This time about half of the side of
the house came in with the mule. Struggling to get up, the mule kicked the candle out and
smashed most of the kitchen furniture, and raised considerable dust. These vio1en.t awaken-
ings must have been annoying to Oliver, but he never complained. He moved to a mansion
on the opposite side of the canon, because he had noticed that the mules did not go there.
One night, about eight o’clock, he was endeavoring to ﬁnish his poem, when a stone rolled in
—- then a hoof appeared below the canvas— then part of a cow -— the after part. He leaned
back in dread, and shouted “Hooy! hooy! get out of this!” and the cow struggled man-
fully—lost ground steadily—dirt and dust streamed down, and before Oliver could get
well away, the entire cow crashed through on to the table, and made a shapeless wreck of
everything!

Then, for the ﬁrst time in his life, I think, Oliver complained. He said,

“ This thing is growing monotonous! ”

Then he resigned his j udgeship and left Humboldt County. “ Butchered to make a Roman
holyday,” has grown monotonous to me.

GUIDES.

In this place I may as well jot down a chapter concerning those necessary nuisances. Eu-
ropean guides. Many a man has wished in his heart he could do without his guide; but
knowing he could not, has wished he could get some amusement out of him as a remunera-
tion for the affliction of his society. We accomplished this latter matter, and if our experi-
ence can be made useful to others, they are welcome to it.

Guides know about enough English to tangle everything up so that a man can make
neither head nor tail of it. They know their story by heart—-the history of. every statue,
painting, cathedral or other wonder they show you. They know it and tell it as a parrot
would—and if you interrupt, and throw them off the track, they have to go back and begin
over again. All their lives long they are employed in showing strange things to foreigners

440 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

and listening to their bursts of admiration. It is what prompts children to say “smart”
things, and do absurd ones, and in other ways “show off” when company is present. It is
what makes gossips turn out in rain and storm to go and be the ﬁrst to tell a startling piece
of news. Think, then, what a passion it becomes with a guide, whose privilege it is, every
day, to show to strangers wonders that throw them into perfect ecstasies of admiration! He
gets so that he could not by any possibility live in a soberer atmosphere. After we dis-
covered this, we ne‘v.«ar went into ecstasies any more———we never admired any thing—we
never showed any but impassible faces and stupid indifference in the presence of the sub-
limest wonders a guide had to display. We had found their weak point. We have made
some _r'ood use of it ever since. We have made some of those people savage,at times, but we
have never lost our own serenity.

’l‘he doctor asks the questions generally, because he can keep his countenance, and look
more like an inspired idiot, and throw more iinbecility into the tone of his voice, than any
man that lives. It comes natural to him.

The guides in Genoa are delighted to secure an American party, because Americans so
much wonder, and deal so much in sentiment and emotion before any relic of Columbus.
Our guide there ﬁdgeted about as if he had swallowed a spring mattress. He was full of
animation —— full of impatience. He said: ,

“Come wis me, genteelmen!—come! I show you ze letter-writing by Christopher Co-
lombo! ——write it himself! ——write it wis his own hand! ——come! ”

He took us to the municipal palace. After much impressive fumbling of keys and open-
ing of locks, the stained and aged document was spread before 11s. The guide’s eyes sparkled.
He danced about us andtapped the parchment with his ﬁnger : '

“What I tell you, genteelmen! ls itlnot so? See! hand-writing Christopher Colombo ! —
Write it himself! ”

We looked indifferent-—unconcerned. The doctor examined the document very deliber-
ately, during a painful pause. Then he said, without any show of interest:

“Ah —-Ferguson——-what —what did you say was the name of the party who wrote this?”

“Christopher Colombo I ze great Christopher Colombo I ”

Another deliberate examination.

“Ah —-did he write it himself, or——or how?”

“ He write it himself! ——-Christopher Colombo! hes own hand-writing, write by himself!”

Then the doctor laid the document down and said:

“Why, I have seen boys in America only fourteen years old that could write better than
that.”

“But zis is ze great Christo—”

“I don’t care who it is! It ’s the worst writing I ever saw. Now you must n’t think you
can impose on us because we are strangers. We are not fools, by a greatdeal. If you have got
any specimens of penmanship of real merit, trot them out!-——and if you have n’t, drive on I ”

We drove on. The guide was considerably shaken up, but he made one more venture. He
had something which he thought would overcome us. Ile said:

“Ah, genteelmen, you come wis me! I show you beautiful, oh, magnificent bust of Chris-
topher Colombo ! — splendid, grand, magniﬁcent

He brought us before the beautiful bust—for it was beautiful-—and sprang back and

'77

struck an attitude : A
“Ah, look, genteelmen I —beautiful, grand, ——bust Christopher Colombo I — beautiful
bust, beautiful pedestal ! ”
The doctor put up his eye-glass—procured for such occasions:
“ Ah -—what did you say this gentleman’s name was? ”
“Christopher Colombo! ——- ze great Christopher Colombo I ” _
“Christopher Colombo—the great Christopher Colombo. Well, what did he do? ”
“Discover America I —discover America. Oh, ze devil I "

“Discover America! N o——-that statement will hardly wash. We are just from America .

ourselves. We heard nothing about it. Christopher Colombo-—pleasant name. Is—is
he dead? ”

“Oh, corpo di Bacclio!-— three hundred year!”

“What did he die of! ”

“I do not know ! — I cannot tell.”

“ Small-pox, think‘? "

“ I do not know, gentee1men!—I do not know WHAT he die of! ”

“Measles, likely?”

“ May be— may be —I do not know —- I think he die of somethings.”

“ Parents living? ”

“ Imposseeble! ”

“ Ah ——which is the bust and which is the pedestal? ”

“ Santa Maria! ——zis ze bust! — zis ze pedestal!”

“ Ah, I see, I see—— happy combination —very happy combination, indeed. Is——is this
the ﬁrst time this gentleman was ever on a bust?”

That joke was lost on the foreigner—-guides cannot master the subtilties of the Ameri-
can joke. ‘

We have made it interesting for this Roman guide. Yesterday we spent three or four
hours in the Vatican, again, that wonderful world of curiosities. We came very near ox-
pressing interest, sometimes——even admiration———it was very hard to keep from it. We
succeeded though. Nobody else ever did, in the Vatican museums. The guide was bewildered
—non~plussed. He walked his legs off, nearly, hunting up extraordinary things, and ex-
hausted all his ingenuity on us, but it was a failure; we never showed any interest in any
thing. He had reserved what he considered to be his greatest wonder till the last —- a royal
Egyptian mummy, the best preserved in the world, perhaps. He took us there. He felt so
sure, this time, that some of his old enthusiasm came back to him:

“ See, genteelmen ! -—-Mummy! Mummy! ”

The eye-glass came up as calmly, as deliberately as ever.

“Ah — Ferguson —— what did I understand you to say the gentleman’s name was ? ”

“ Name? —— he got no name ! — Mummy —’Gyptian mummy!”

_“ Yes, yes. Born here? ”

“No! ’Gyptian mummy!”

“ Ah, just so. Frenchman, I presume? ”

“No ! —not Frenchman, not Roman! born in Egypta ! ”

“Born in Egypta. Never heard of Egypta before. Foreign locality, likely. Mun1my—-
mummy. How calm he is —— how self~possessed. Is, ah — is he dead? ”

“Oh, sacre bleu, has been dead three thousan’ year! ”

The doctor turned on him savagely: ;

“Here, now, what do you mean by such conduct as this! Playing 11s for Chinamen be-
cause we are strangers and trying to learn! Trying to impose your vile second-hand car-
casses on us! — thunder and lightning, I ’ve a notion to — to—If you ’ve got a nice fresh
corpse, fetch him out ! —-' or, by George, we ’ll brain you !”

TIIE TOMB OF ADAM.

The greatest proof [that this column marks the centre of the earth] lies in the fact that
from under this very column was taken the dust from which Adam was made. This can
surely be regarded in the light of a settler. It is not likely that the original man would
have been made from an inferior quality of earth when it was entirely convenient to get
ﬁr-st quality from the world’s centre. This will strike any reﬂcctive mind forcibly. That
Adam was formed of dirt procured in thies very spot is amply proven by the fact that, in six
thousand years, no man has ever been able to prove that the dirt was not procured here

whereof he was made.

442 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

It is a singular circumstance that right. under the roof of this same great church, and not
far away from that illustrious column, Adam himself, the father of the human race, lies
buried. There is no question that he is actually buried in the grave which is pointed out

v as his—there can be none—because it has never yet been proven that that grave is not the

grave in which he is buried.

The tomb of Adam! How touching it was, here in the land of strangers, far away from
home, and friends, and all who cared for me, thus to discover the grave of a blood relation.
True, a distant one, but still a relation. The unerring instinct of nature thrilled its recog-
nition. The fountain of my ﬁlial affection was stirred’ to its profoundest depths, and I gave
way to tumultuous emotion. I leaned upon a pillar and burst into tears. I deem it no
shame to have wept over the grave of my poor dear relative. Let him who would sneer at
my emotion close this volume here. He will ﬁnd little to his taste in my journeyings
through Holy Land. Noble old man -—-he did not live to see me ——he did not live to see his
child. And I—I—alas, I did not live to see him. Weighed down by sorrow and disap-
pointment, he died before I was born —— six thousand brief summers before I was born. But
let me try to bear it with fortitude. Let me trust that he is better off where he is. Let us
take comfort in the thought that his loss is our eternal gain. ’

C. H. Welob,——“John Paul.”

 

CHARLES HENRY WEBB, 1885 , a humorist, better known as “John
Paul,” has written a number of amusing sketches and travesties, which
have been very successful. The following clever travesty of himself, writ-
ten for this volume, gives a good idea both of the man and of his style.

AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY, BY JOIIN PAUL.

I was born at Rouse’s Point, a little village in the State of New York, standing at the
northern extremity of Lake Champlain. There were excellent schools, both private and
public, in the vicinity, and it was the intention of my parents to ﬁt me for college, my
mother especially being ﬁrmly persuaded that I was destined to become an eminent mission-
ary. I did not object to being a missionary, inasmuch as this seemed to promise a wild life in
primitive forests, gathering cocoanuts and chasing monkeys and green parrots. But, on the
whole, I preferred to be a great Western trapper; and I devoted myself to preparatory studies
and pursuits to that purpose with such effect, that I soon became famous as the best squirrel-
shot and bull-trout catcher in town.

When little more than twelve years of age, my father thought he would steady and utilize
me a little by giving me an idea of business, and he sent me to act as clerk in a branch store
he had established at a village about twelve miles distant. My usefulness as clerk was only
marred by a habit I acquired, when left to myself, of shutting up the store in the morning
and going out squirrel-hunting, seldom returning before dark. So,'between work and play,
with some studying and a good deal of reading, my years wore on, until it seemed good to
me to go down to the great city of New York and seek my fortune.

I was now between sixteen and seventeen years old. New York interested me ainazingly
——so much so, that with wandering and wondering around, I spent nearly all my money
before even attempting to ﬁnd anything to do. Thinking all things over, I cletermined at
this crisis to be a reporter. True, I knew little of the city, and nothing at all about news-
papers; but it seemed to me that the editor’s life was a grand one. Looking back at it now,
I ’m afraid I wanted to be an editor principally because I had discovered that editors were
admitted to theatres and all places of amusement free.

I must mention here that I had written several compositions, in both prose and verse, while
at school, which were much praised by the teachers, and which went far to conﬁrm my mother
in the belief that I was yet destined to become a missionary or some other great man.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 443

So being introduced by a friend to Mr. Snow, of the Tribune, that gentleman set me to
getting up an article telling what was going on in the shipyards. This I did in quite a cred-
itable manner,‘and_ it was actually printed pretty nearly as I wrote it. Being so fortunate,
also, while circulating about the wharves, as to see a woman fall into the water, I made
quite an interesting item about that too ; so my boat seemed quite successfully aﬂoat on the
waters of journalism.

But wandering about among ships and shipyards had a strange effect on me, —it kindled
all the roving blood in my veins; and after sundry conversations with old salts whom I
found chewing their quids on the wharves, I cletermined to be a sailor. Having once deter-
mined, I took no further counsel with any one, but set out for South Street. A sign in front
of a shipping—ofﬁce stated that ﬁfty young Americans were wanted to go on a whaling Voy-
age! Here seemed my chance. 'l‘rembling, lest every situation was ﬁlled, I entered the
oﬂice and asked if there was still a vacancy. To my great joy, I was told that there was.
My name was down on the books in a moment, and the next morning I was in New Bedford.
I wrote home, telling my parents what I had done; but by the time they had my letter, I
was aﬂoat——bound to the Paciﬁc Ocean on a three years’ voyage.

I was never sea-sick once; and, notwithstanding many hardships and a great deal of ill
usage, I enjoyed my sailor’s life much ; and to this day, at times I look back to it with regret.
I learned very many lessons which have been useful to me in after life. Beginning my
studies on a lake, I graduated on the ocean.

I was at sea about three years. Returning, I found that my parents had moved to the
West, and, yielding to their entreaties, I went out to Illinois to visit them, though fully de-
termined to follow the sea thenceforth for a living. But once at home, old ties reasserted
themselves, and I went into business with an elder brother. Moderately successful fora
while, a wheat speculation, which resulted unfavorably, set me back where I began ——-a little
further back, in fact. But of this wheat speculation I wrote a humorous account, which
was published in one of the Chicago papers. This made a “hit,” beingvery generally copied,
and ﬁnally attracted the attention of Henry J. Raymond.

Very soon thereafter'(in 1860). I. found myself contributing to the New York Times, and
next was offered a position in the editorial rooms. I originated the “Minor Topic” col-
umn, brief pointed paragraphs on current subjects, did some correspondence that attracted
considerable attention, and was ﬁnally put in charge of" “ new publications ; ” and here my
acquaintance with publishers began. I should have stated, however, that previous to my
connection with the Times, I had published a number of “ poems” in Ilar-per’s Weekly —-
it being so much easier to write poetry than prose.

I remained on the Times until the snring of 1863, when I went out to California, to take
the position of City Editor on the San Francisco Bulletin. Leaving the Bulletin at the ex-
piration of my year, I started the Californian, a journal which acquired some celebrity
and no inconsiderable reputation at the East as well as on the Paciﬁc Coast. During the
existence of the Californian both Mark Twain and Bret Harte became contributors to it,
—this was, of course, before they were known at the East. While editing and publishing
the Californian, I corresponded for the Sacramento Union and the New York Times, besides
bringing out two plays which had rather successful runs on the San Francisco stage.

Returning to New York in 1866, I became a contributor to the Times, the Tribune, Har-
per’s Magazine, Weekly, and Bazar, Hours at Home, and the Springﬁeld Republican.

To exemplify what an author can do as his own publisher, I published “Liﬂith Lank,”
——altravesty of Charles Reade’s Griﬂith Gaunt—and St. ’Twelmo,——a travesty of Miss
Evans’s St. Elmo — and made a good deal of money out of them‘. Since, as an experiment
of what an author can do with a publisher, I have issued a brochu‘re entitled “ The Wickedest
Woman in New York,” and received’ just $22.53 as my share of the proceeds.

My friend Mark Twain coming East while I was publishing my own works, and being
desirous of getting before the public, I undertook to publish a book for him -— moved to a
belief in its success from the fact that nearly all the principal publishers in the United

444 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

States had refused it. Thisselection from his miscellaneous writings was given to the
World as The Jumping Frog of Calaveras and Other Sketches. by Mark Twain, a book of some
220 pages. It made an immediate success, and the copyright to-day would be worth to any
publisher $5000 a year. At the request of the author, who wished to use some of the
sketches in another form, and suppress others entirely, the stereotype plates were melted
down about a year since, and The Jumping Frog has disappeared as a book from the trade
forever.

In 1868 I patented the machine known as “ Webb’s Adder,” and in 1869, having perfected
the machine and completed the machinery necessary for its economical manufacture, it was
offered to the public. Finding the impression prevalent that I was asking the community
to take a viper to its bosom, I have since caused it to be known as Webb’s Adding Machine
——the name now explains the machine.

Having gotten the patent Adding Machine well a-going, it seemed patent to me that it
was well-nigh time to bethink myself of multiplying. So October 11, 1870, I was married to
the sweetest little woman in the world —-of course excepting everybody else’s wife.

And now in my quiet little home of Orange, N. J., I am seriously bethinking myself of

doing something; for it really seems to me that in my life hitherto I have done nothing

at all.

And yet I can remember when it seemed to me that if I could only get a situation on
some New York daily, I should have nothing further to ask for—earth could contain no
greater advancement. And within three months I have refused three offers of excellent
editorial positions. How men and times change! How _small the object of our ambition
seems when once reached-- how diminutive when passed.

B. P. Shi11aber,— “Mrs. Partington.”

BENJAMIN P. SHILLABER, 1814 ,' by his conception of the character
of Ruth Partington, has entitled himself to a place among genuine humor-
ists. The old lady has become, indeed, in the public mind, a living per-
sonage, almost as distinctly as Artemus Ward himself.

Mr. Shillaber was born in Portsmouth, N. II. He left school at ﬁfteen, for the printing
oﬂice. I-[aving served three years in Dover, N. H., he came to Boston in 1832, and “ﬁnished
his trade.” _

In 1835 he went to British Guiana (Demerara) threatened with consumption. There he
was connected with the Royal Gazette for nearly two years, as compositor. In 1837, he re-
turned, and married, still a journeyman. I11 1840, he became connected with the Post, and
worked at the case till 1850. l A

In 1847, he began to write for that paper. The Partington sayings began here. The adop-
tion of the name was unpremeditated. There were certain things to be said, and by some
chance the name of Mrs. Partington occurred, which was adopted without a thought of
anything beyond a present satisfaction. It might have been Brown or Smith as well ; but
Sidney Smith’s “Mrs. Partington and her Mop,” were in his mind, and these sayings were
cognate. Apart from this suggestion of the name, the whole conception of Ruth Parting-
ton, as known to American readers, is unquestionably a pure creation of Mr. Shillaber’s.

In 1850, he left the Post and joined the Pathﬁnder as printer and editor. From this sprung
the Carpet Bag, of which he had control for two years. It was a mildly humorous sheet, in
the best sense of that much abused word. It concentrated an array of excellent talent.
Chas. G. Eastman, John G. Saxe, Chas. G-. Halpine (Miles O’Reil1y), Chas. F. Browne (Arte-
mus Ward), and many others wrote for it.

In 1852, he published a book of poems, entitled Rhymes with Reason and Without, that
was well received by the best critics. In 1853, The Life and Sayings of Mrs. Partington

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 445

appeared, and had an immense sale, orders for the ﬁrst edition of twenty thousand exhausting
the whole before a book was issued. This was succeeded, a year or two later, by Knitting
Work, which met with nearly as much favor. After which, becoming a more exclusively
newspaper man, he wrote little except on current matters, and made no sign of publication

I in book form.

In 1853, he returned to the Post, and continued for three years as local reporter, and in
1856 was associated, on the Saturday Evening Gazette, wit_h \Vm. W. Clapp, Jr., Esq., con-
tinuing wit.h him until the paper changed hands in 1866. Since that time he has written
much for various publications. , _

Mr. Shillaber has anotlier volume ready for publication, the name not yet decided upon.

At the annual commencement of Dartmouth College, in 1871, Mr. Shillaber, on the invi-
tation of the literar.y societies of the College, read a Poem, following the Address by Dr.
McCosh, and was at the: same time elected an honorary member of the Phi Beta Kappa
Society.

In reply to the question whether the old lady is still living, Mr. Shillaber says: “Ruth
Partington is not dead yet. Her virtues, ﬂagrant as her souchong, still exhale for human
delectation, her specs still beam with the benevolence of olden time, but her vivacity is
somewhat impaired by the reproach of old age. A conscience that acquits her of nothing
makes the days pass as pleasantly as the Indian summer.” Of himself he says, “I am now
in the grandfatherly period (eet 58), and enjoying as much happiness to my avoirdupois
(240 lbs.) as any other man,———experiencing, as Mrs. Partington says, the true npiurn. cum
dz'gitat73s.” A

SAYINGS BY MRS. PARTINGTON.

“ Dear me! here they are going to have war again over the sea, and only for a Turkey,
and it don’t say how much it weighed either, nor whether it was tender; and Prince Knock-
emstiff has gone off in a miff, and the Rushian bears and austriches are all to be let loose to
devour the people, and heaven knows where the end of it will leave off. War is a dreadful
thing—so destroying to temper and good clo’es, and men shoot at each other just as if they
was gutter purchase, and cheap at that.”

“What is your opinion of the humor of Hawthorne, Mrs. Partington? ” asked a young
neighbor that had been reading ‘Twice-Told Tales.’ “ I don’t know,” said she, looking at
him earnestly; “but if you have got it, you ’d better take something to keep it from strik-
ing in. Syrup of buckthorne is good for all sorts of diseases of that kind; I don’t know
about the humor of Ilawthorne, but I guess the buckthorne will be beneﬁcious. VVe eat
too much butter, and butter is very humorous.” .

“ It is all very true, Mr. Knickerbottom,” said Mrs Partington, as she read in the Knicker-
bocker something concerning brevity and simplicity of expression; “it ’s true, as you say;
and how many mistakes there does happen when folks don’t understand each other! Why,
last summer I told a dressmaker to make me a long visite, to wear, and, would you believe
it, she came and staid a fortnight with me? Since then I ’ve made it a pint always to speak
just what I say.” ' I

“I never liked the Swedenvirgins; but I ain’t one that believes nothing good can come
out of Lazarus, for all that, now. Now, there’s Jenny Lind‘, — that is so very good to every-
body, and who sings so sweet that everybody ’s falling in love with her, tipsy-turvy, and
gives away so much to poor, indignant people. They call her an angel, and who knows but
she may be a syrup in disguise, for the papers say her singing is like the music of the spears.
How I should love to hear her! ”

“A have in our church! Who can it be? Dear me, and they have been so careful, too,
who they took in,—exercising ’em aforehand, and putting ’em through the catechis and
the lethargy, and pounding ‘em into a state of grace 3 Who can it be? ” And the spectacles
expressed anxiety. “I believe it must be slander after all. Oh, what a. terrible thing it is

to pisen the peace of a neighborhood deteriorating and backbiting, and lying about people,
when the blessed truth is full bad enough about the best of us! ”

“ Entered at the Custom Home? ” said Mrs. P-artington, pondering on the expression; “ I
don’t see how the vessels ever got in; but I am glad that the collector cleared ’em right
out again. It will learn them better manners next time, I think.”

Deacon Snarl, in exhortation, would often allude to the “place where prayer is wont to
be made.” " Ah! ” said Mrs. Partington to herself, “ there’ s nothing like humility in a Chris-
tian. I’m glad you confess it. I don’t know a place under the canister of heaven where
prayer is wanted more to be made than here, and I hope you ’ll be forgiven for the rancor-
ous butter you sold me yesterday.”

Mrs. Partington’s neighbor, Mrs. Sled, complained one morning of a ringing in her cars.
“It must be owing to the guitar in your head, dear,” said the old lady. She knew every
sort of human ailment, and, like the down—east doctor, was death on ﬁts. “ I know what
ringing in the ears is,” continued she; “for my ears used to ring so bad, sometimes, as to
wake Paul out of his sleep, thinking it was an alarm of ﬁre ! ” J - ‘

“ The prayer of Moses executed on one string ! ” said Mrs. Partington. “ Praying, I s’pose,

to be cut down. Poor Moses!” sighed she; “ executed on one string! Well, I don’t know

as ever I heard of anybody’s being executed on two strings, unless the rope broke;” and
she went on wondering how it could be.

H. W. ShaVv,—‘-‘Josh Billings,”

HENRY VV. SHAVV, 1818 —~—-, has acquired no little notoriety as a Writer
and “lecturer,” under the assumed name of “Josh Billings.”

To a letter of inquiry in regard to his career, Mr, Shaw gives the following statement:

“I was born in Berkshire County, lVIass., in 1818. I left home at ﬁfteen; went to the from
tier, lived there for twenty-ﬁve years, and know a good deal about border life. I had school»
ing until I was fourteen. My father and grandfather were both members of Congress. I
think my father was a graduate of your college; if so, it must have been about 1812. His
name was Henry Shaw. ' '

“I have been in every kind of business, but found-none very proﬁtable. I have been
merchant, extensive farmer, drover, steamboat captain, auctioneer, etc., etc.

“There is one thing perhaps a little peculiar. I never wrote a line for the public eye
until after I was l'orty—ﬁve years old. I entered Hamilton College when I was fourteen years
old ; stayed out the freshman year, and then ﬂed to the edge of civilization.

“ My ﬁrst book, Sayings of Josh Billings, was issued about 1866. It sold very well at that A

time, and even sells some now; it was published in England, and met with reasonable
success.

“ My next book, Josh Billings on Ice, has had a good sale.

“In 1870 I put forth Josh Billings’s Farmer’s Allminax. Of this 90,000 copies were sold
in that year; 117,000 in 1871; and 100,000 in 1872, the Chicago ﬁre hurting the sale very
much, so the publishers say.

“ I have been married thirty years, have two daughters; one lives in Venezuela, and the
other in New York. I have four grandchildren, which are my glory and strength.

“ I lecture about the country in winter, and deliver, on an average, eighty lectures a sea-
son, or have for the last four winters.

“ I am employed, as a scribbler, on the New York Weekly, for which I write exclusively,
and receive from them $4,000 a year. I am offered $150 a night for ten nights next October
in Kansas. My lectures are on Milk, What I Know about Hotels, and The Cockroach and
his Friends. These are comic efforts.

“I enjoy life, and love the funny side of all things.”

HENRY W. SHAW, “Josn BiLL1Nes.”

RATS.

Rats originally cum from Norway, and i wish they had originally staid thare.

They are about az uncalled for az a pain in the small ov the back.

They can be domestikatcd dredful eazy, that iz, as far as gitting in cupboards, and eating
cheese, and knawiug pie, iz concerned.

The best way to doxncstikate them that everi saw, is tew surround them gently with a
steel trap; yu can reason with them then tu great advantage.

Rats are migratorious, they migrately wharever they hav a mind to.

Pizen iz also good for rats; it softens their whole moral naturs.

Cats hate rats, and rats hate cats, and — who don’t?

I serpoze thare iz between 50 and 60 millions of rats in Amerika (i quote now entirely
from memory,) and i don’t serpoze thare iz a single necessary rat in the whole lot. This
shows at a glance how menny waste rats thare iz. Rats enhance in numbers faster than
shoe:pegs do by machinery. One pair ov helthy rats iz awl that enny man Wants to start
the rat bizziness with, and in ninety daze, without enny outlay, he. will begin tew have
rats tew turn c-ph.

Rats, viewed from enny platform y11 kan bild, are unspeakibly cussed, and i would be will-
ing tew make enny man who could destroy awl the rats in the United States, a valuable
keepsake, say, for Instance, either the life and sufferings of Andy Johnson, in one vollum
calf bound, or a receipt tew kure the blind staggers,

REMARKS.

Fust appearances are ced tu be everything. I don’t put all my fathe into this saying; i I

think oysters and klams, for instanse, will bear looking into.

If you want tew git a sure krop, and a big yield for the seed, sow wild oats.

Humin natur is the same allover the world, ’cept in New England, and thar it’s akordin tu
sarcumstances. .

If i had a boy who didn’t lie well enuff to sute me, i wud set him tu tendin a retale dri
good store.

Man was created a little lower than the angells, and has bin gittin a little lower ever,
sinse.

When a feller gits a goin down hil, it dus seem as tho evry thing had been greased for the
okashun.

It is dreadful easy tew be a phool —a man kan be one and not know it.

Ignorance is ced to be bliss. This ma be so, I never tried it.

The man who kan wear a shirt a hole weak and keap it klean, aint ﬁt for enny thing else.

When a man’s dog deserts him on akount ov his poverty, he kant git enny lower down in
this world, not bi land.

Luv is like the measels, we kant alwas tell when we ketched it, and ain’t apt tew hav it
severe but onst, and then it ain’t kounted mutch unless it strikes inly.

Charles G. Leland.

CHARLES GODFREY LELAND, 1824 , opened a new vein of humor
by his conception of Hans Breitmann, a carousing, but shrewd, money-loving
German immigrant, of a class that prevailed to a considerable extent before
and during the war.

Mr...Leland was born in Philadelphia (in Chestnut Street below Third, in the house from
which President Madison wooed and wedded his “Dolly ”). When he was ten years of age
he went to a celebrated school near Boston, Mr. Greene’s, the same which Geo. Curtis has
described in his novel Prue and I.

448 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

At fourteen or ﬁfteen he published some little poems in newspapers, and within a year after.’
1840, l1e began to read everything by Carlyle and writers of that class, with the works also
of their opponents. In a very, few years he had perused with great care an incredible
amount of metaphysics and general literature. Prof. Albert Dod said of him, at sixteen,

' that there were not ten men in America who had read more than he.

At Princeton he neglected mathematics, but devoured metaphysics. He wrote a great deal
for the college magazine, among other things an article on Spinoza. In 1815 he graduated
and went to Europe, where he passed three years, meeting many distinguished men. He
studied at Heidelberg, Munich, and the University of Paris, attending lectures at the Sor-
bonne and Louis le Grand (college). I

‘From infancy, humor, in a high literary sense, had always peculiar charms for him. He was 4

the only boy among ninety a.t school who regularly collected comic almanacs,jest~books,
and such cheap facetianl‘ Everything smacking of the quaint and curious pleased him to an
inordinate degree. '

Being in Paris at the time, he took an active part in the French Revolution. He was even
put into a caricature of the American deputation going to congratulate the Gouvernement
Provisoire. He was armed in the ﬁght, and was leader of a barricade.

In October, 1848, he returned to Philadelphia and studied law, but soon gave it up for
literature, writing articles for Sa-rtain’s Magazine and other periodicals. Afterwards he
went to New York, and was a great deal with Rufus Griswold, and edited for a time the
Illustrated News. In 1856, he returned to Philadelphia, went on the Bulletin, where he
remained for three years. During this time he published Maister Karl’s -Sketch Book,
translated I-Ieine’s Pictures of Travel and Book of Songs. wrote the Poetry and Mystery of

Dreams, and ﬁnally went to New York again in the end of 1859. Here he engaged in many_

literary affairs, did the foreign editing for six months of the Times under Raymond. and
edited Vanity Fair for one year, besides contributing about two hundred articles to Apple-
ton’s Cyclopaedia. .

On the breaking out of the war, Mr. Leland employed his pen very actively and eiﬁciently
in support of the national government. This he did for a time through the columns of the
Knickerbocker, but afterwards more distinctly and boldly in a magazine, The Continental,
started by himself and another gentleman, and published in Boston. He first broached and
urged the idea of emancipation, as distinguished from abolition.

In 1803, he returned to Philadelphia, and wrote and illustrated the Book of Copperheads.
In that year also he translated the Memoirs of a Good for Nothing from the German of You
Eichendorff. ‘

Before the. end of the war he went West and engaged in coal-land and oil speculations, and
passed the winter. spring, and summer ot'18b'5 in travelling in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ten-
nessee, and ﬁnally in West Virginia. After a most remarkable series of adventures, he returned
to Philadelphia and went on the Press as managing editor. The paper under his management
rose, from paying nothing, to paying $10,000 a year, clear. Having travelled to Kansas, he
published an account of the very wild and jolly trip in a pamphlet, To Kansas and Back, or
Three Thousand Miles in a Rail Road Car. Then he went again to St. Paul’s and Duluth -
when there were only six houses in the latter place. Then came the extraordinary success
of Hans Breitinann, again lifted into popularity by the late German war. In May, 1860, he

went to Europe -— Paris, Spa, the Rhine; passed the winter in Dresden, Italy, Nice, Paris; '

and then to hiiglaiitl, where he was at once cordially received by numbers of eminent people.
He has been a guest at‘ Lord Lytton’s splendid country-seat, and often at his house in town;
has met Tennyson, Carlyle, Robert Browning, Ruskin, Lord Houghton, and numbers of
others like.them. In the summer of 1870 he went to the German spas and Switzerland, but
for the last two years has lived in England.

Mr. Leland has just completed twovnew volumes: The Music Lesson of Confucius and
Other Poems, containing efforts to combine the Greek spirit of beauty—“ the rights of the
Flesh” with earnest Christian feeling; something in the spirit in which the Troubadours

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 449

. combined religious sentiment with an exalted ideal of love and beauty; 2. Gandeamus, a

translation of a number of rollicking German poems from Joseph V. Scheffel, the most popu-
lar modern German poet. Mr. Leland seems to have domiciliated himself permanently in
England.

llEN1tY PERRY LELAND, 1828-1868, brother of Charles P. Leland, was a magazinist and
author of some note. He was a native of Philadelphia, and cultivated his talents by t1‘a\'<=l
as well as by study. Besides numerous magazine and newspaper articles, he published two
volumes: Americans in Rome; and The Gray Bay Mare.‘ He had a. fine vein of humor, and
would probably have risen to high distinction had his life been spared.

MORTIMER H. THOMPSON, 1830-1875, Wrote some very amusing sketches, under the name

of Q. K. Phi1anderDoesticks. The following are his published volumes : Doestick’s Letters;
Plu-Ri-Bus-Tah; The Elephant Club; Witches of New York.

George H. Derby,——“John Phoenix.”

' GEORGE H. DERBY,_1824—1861, U. s. Topographical Engineer, while
stationed on the California Coast, Wrote a series of Very amusing papers

under the assumed name of ,“ John Phoenix.” These were published after-

wards in a Volume, called Phoenixiana.

Mr. Derby was born in Norfolk County, Mass, and graduated at West Point, in the
class of 1846. He was brevetted for gallantry in the Mexican war. While employed by
the U. S. government in erecting light-houses on the coast of Florida and Alabama, he
received a sunstroke, which caused a softening of the brain. He died, however, in New
York city.

A NEW SYSTEM OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR.

This system -— shall I say this great system —is exceedingly simple, and easily explained
in a few words. In the ﬁrst place, “ﬁgures won’t lie.” Let us then represent by the num-
ber 100 the maximum, the ne plus ultra of every human quality-— grace, beauty, courage,
strength, wisdom, learning—— everything. Let pa?-fectznn, I say, be represented by ‘100, and
an absolute minimum of all qualities by the number 1. Then applying the numbers between
to the adjectives used in conversation, we shall be able to arrive at a very close approxi-
mation to the idea we wish to convey; in other words, we shall be enabled to speak the
truth. Glorious, soul-inspiring idea! For instance, the most ordinary question asked of
youis, “How, do'you do?” To this, instead of replying, “Pretty well,” “Very well,”
“ Quite well,” or the like absurdities -— after running through your mind that pe7j“ectz'on of
health is 100, no health at all, 1-—-you say, with a graceful bow, “Thank you, I‘m 52 to-
day ; ” or, feeling poorly, “ I’m .13, I’m obliged to you ,” or “I’m 68,” or “75,” or “ 871/2,” as
the case may be! Do you see how very close in this way you may approximate to the
truth; and how clearly your questioner will understand what he so anxiously wishes to
arrive at—-your exact state of health. . . '

Let this system be adopted into our elements of grammar, our conversation, our literature,
and we become at once an exact, precise, mathematical, truth-telling people. It will apply
to everything but politics; there, truth being of no account, the system is useless. But
in literature, how admirable! Take an example.

As a l9 young lady and 76 hateful lady was 52 gaily tripping down the sidewalk of
our Sal frequented street, she accidentally came in contact——100 (this shows that she came
in close contact with a 75 fat, but 87 good-humorecl looking gentleman, who was 93 (i. e.,
intently) gazing into the window of atoy-shop. Gracefully 56 extricated herself, she received
the excuses of the 96 embarrassed Falstaff with a 68 bl-and smile, and continued on her
way. But hardly —7 — had she reached the corner of the block ere she was overtaken by

38* 2D

50 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

a 24 young man, 32 poorly dressed, but of an 85 expression of countenance; 91 hastily
touching her 54 beautifully rounded arm, he said to her 67 surprise :

“ Madam, at the window of the toy-shop yonder, you dropped this bracelet, which I had
the 71 good fortune to observe, and now have the 94 happiness to hand to you.”_ Of course
the expression “ 94 happiness ” is merely the young man’s polite hyperbole.

Blushing with 76 modesty, the lovely (76, as before of course) lady took the _bracc1et——
which was a 24 magniﬁcent diamond clasp —(24 magniﬁcent, playfully sarcastic; it was
probably not one of‘ Tue-ker’s) from the young man’s hand, and 84 hesitatingly drew
from her beautifully 38 embroidered reticule a 67 porte-monnaie. The young man noticed
the action, and 73 proudly drawing back, added:

“Do not thank me; the pleasure of gazing for an instant at those 100 eyes (perhaps
too exaggerated a compliment), has already more than compensated me for any trouble
that I might have had.”

She thanked him, however, with a 67 deep blush, and a 48 pensive air, turned from him,
and pursued with a 33 slow step her promenade.

Seba Smith, —— “ Major Jack Dovvning.”

SEBA SMITH, 1792-1868, the “Jack Downing” of the last generation,
belongs chronologically to the preceding chapter. But his writings seem
to be naturally associated with those of the humorists now under considera-
tion, and therefore he is mentioned here.

Mr. Smith was born in Turner, Me., anl died at Patchogue, Long Island, N. Y. He was
of a good family, well to do, long-lived, intelligent, and religious. He graduated at Bowdoin
College i11 1818, taking the highest honors of his class. The simplicity of his life, the sweet-
ness, purity, and truthfulness of his character made him a general favorite, although a nat-
ural reserve and shyness limited his acquaintance to the few.

Mr. Smith is best known by his Letters of Major Jack Downing. Of these Lord Brougham
once declared that they “ were not merely humorous, but statesmanlike, and for quaintness
and humor. originality and genius, unequalled since the writings of Hudibras.”

Mr. Sn;i;h’s other publications are the following: Powhatan,_a metrical romance; Dew-
Drops of the Nineteenth Century; Way Down East, or Portraitures of Yankee Life; My
Thirty Years out of the Senate, by Major Jack Downing; New Elements of Geometry. A

One well acquainted with Mr. Smith, and a thoroughly competent witness, bears the fol-
lowing emphatic testimony to the purity and simplicity of his character: “ No one can read
the introduction to his New Elements of Geometry, without being impressed with the
learning and earnestness of the author. A few weeks before his death he was talking with
me upon this subject, when he remarked, ‘It does not matter whether the doctrine, the
scientiﬁc truth I have discovered, he accepted this year, or ﬁve hundred years hence,“ it is
the Truth, and it will p7'e7:cn'l.” There is something sublime in such assurance.

“The close of his life was quiet, in the sanctuary of home, which he rarely ever left, even
on brief occasions, being purely domestic in his tastes and habits. He was indifferent to
wealth or fashion, ridiculed all ostentation, and believed in the native dignity of man with-
out exterior decorations. He was warm and enduring in his friendships, never losing a
friend, except by death. He enjoyed his fame, treating with indifference those who strove
to detract from his well-earned reputation. Few men have been more equable under mis-
fortune, none less elated by success.” . '

He married Elizabeth Oakes Smith, March 6th, 1823, who brought him six children,
all sons.

ON MAKING THE PRESIDENT A DOCTOR OF LAWS.

When we were at Boston, they sent word to us to come to Cambridge, for they wanted to
make the President [Jackson] a doctor of laws. What upon airth a. doctor of laws was, or

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 451

why they wanted to make the President one, I couldn’t think So when we come to go up
to bed I asked the Gineral about it. And says I, “ Gineral, what is it they want to do to you
out to Cambridge?” Says he, “ They want to make a doctor of laws of me.” “Well,” says
I, “ but what good will that do? " “ Why,” says he, “you know, Major Downing. there’s a
pesky many of them are laws passed by Congress, that are rickety things. Some of ’em
have very poor constitutions, and some of ’e1n haven’t no constitution at all. So that it is
necessary to have somebody there to doctor ’em up a. little and not let ’em go out into the
world, where they would stand a chance to catch cold and be sick, without they had good
constitutions to bear it. You know,” says he, “ I’ve had to doctor the laws considerable
ever since I’ve been at Washington, although I wasn’t a regular bred doctor. And I made
out so well about it, that these Cambridge folks think I’d better be made into a regular (l<w.'—
tor at once, and then there ’ll be no grumbling and disputing about my practice.” Says he,
“Major, what do you think of it? ” I told him I thought it an excellent plan; and asked
him if he didn’t think they would be willing, bein’ I ’d been round in the military business
considerable for a year or two past, to make me a doctor of war. He said he didn’t know,

but he thought. it would be no harm to try ’em. “ But,” says he, “ Major, I feel a little kind

cfstreaked about it, after all; for they say they will go to talking to me in Latin, and
although I studied it a little once, I don’t know any more about it now than the man in
the moon. And how I can get along, in that case, I don’t know.” I told him my way,
when anybody talked to me in a lingo that I didn’t understand, was jest to say nothing,
but look as knowing as any of ’em, and then they ginerally thought I knew a pesky sight
more than any of ’em. At that the Gineral fetched me a slap on my shoulder, and haw-
hawed right out. Says he, “ Major Downing, you are the boy for me; I don’t know how I
should get along in this world if it wasn’t for you.”

So when we got ready we went right to Cambridge as bold as could be. And that are
Cambridge is a real pretty place: it seems to me I should like to live in them colleges as
well as any place I’ve seen. We went into the libry, and I guess I stared a little, for I
didn’t think before there was half so many books in the world. I should think there was
near about enough to ﬁll a meetin’-house. I don’t believe they was ever all read, or ever
will be to all ages.

When we come to go in to be made doctors of, there was a terrible crowding around;
but they give us a good place, and sure enough, they did begin to talk in Latin or some
other gibberish; but wl_1ether they were talking to the Gineral, or who ’twas, I could n’t
tell. I guess the G-ineral was a little puzzled. But he never said a word, only once in
a while bowed a little. And I s’pose he happened sometimes to put the bows in the
wrong p1ace,for I could see some of the sassy students look up one side once in a while,
and snicker out of one corner of their mouths. Howsomever, the Gineral stood it out
like a hero, and got through very well. And when ’t was over,I stept up to Mr. Quincey
and asked him if he wouldn’t be so good as to make me adoctor of war, and hinted to
him a little about my services down to Madawaska. and among the Nulliﬁers. At that he
made me, a very polite bow, and says he, “Major Downing, we should be very happy to
oblige you if we could, but we never give any degrees of war here; all our degrees are
degrees of peace.” So I ﬁnd I shall have to practise war in the natural way—let milli-
ﬁcation or what will come. After ’t was all over, we went to Mr. Quincey’s and had a
capital dinner. And, on the whole, had about as good a visit to Cambridge as most
anywhere.

Geo. W. Bagloy,—“Mozis Addurns.”

GEORGE WILLIAM BAGBY, M. D., 1828 , of Lynehburg, Va., has an
extended reputation in the Southern States, and is not unknown further
North, by his amusing Letters to Mozis Addums, and by other Writings of
a humorous character.

452 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

‘Dr. Bagby was born in Buckingham County, Va., son of a Lynehburg merchant. He was
ﬁtted for college at the Edgehill School, Princeton, N. .I., then under the care of the author
of the present volume. Young Bagby entered Delaware College in 1843, but left at the end
of the Sophomore year. He studied medicine and took his degree at the University of Penn-
sylvania, but has never practised. In 1853, he became editor of the Daily Express, Lynch-
burg. He was for several years VVashington Correspondent of the New Orleans Crescent,

Charleston Mercury, and Richmond Dispatch. He wrote for Harper’s Magazine, My Wife

and My Theory about Wives, and other articles ; also for the Atlantic an article on Wash-
ington City. In 1860 he succeeded John R. Thompsonas editor of the Southern Literary Mes-
senger, and continued to edit it till near the close of the war. He was at the s-ame°time
associate editor of the Richmond Whig, and correspondent of the Charleston Mercury, Mobile
Register, Memphis Appeal, and Columbus (Ga.) Herald, and contributed to the Southern
Illustrated News.

His eyes suffering from overwork, he began lecturing, in 1865, and met with good success
as a humorous lecturer in many parts of Virginia and Maryland. His most successful lec-
tures were : Bacon and Greens, or The Native Virginian ; Womenfolks; An Apology for Fools,

‘etc. His best known writings are his articles in Harper, already mentioned, and his Letters

to'Mozis Addums, and to Billy Ivvins. Dr. Bagby, since 1870, has been State Librarian and
First Clerk to the Secretary of State, at Richmond.- The passage quoted is from an article
in the Southern Literary Messenger, May, 1863.

GOOD EATINGS.

In the lower part of my countenance there is a remarkable excavation, which, while it
does not disﬁgure me a great deal, costs me a heap of money and gives me a world of trouble.
To ﬁll up this pit has been the labor of my life. For nearly forty years I have been hard
at it, and the pit, this day, is, if anything, rather emptier than it ever was before. Don’t ask
me what I have put into it to ﬁll it up‘ ; rather ask me what I have not. They tell me that
the good people who first discovered this gaping cavern, endeavored to stop it up with--
what do you reckon? Milk! Fact, I assure you; they tried milk. It makes me laugh to
think of such folly. Yet year after year I see folks pouring milk into other excavations.
There is mighty little sense in this world. Gallons upon gallons of milk are wasted, when
a handful of mortar would do the business in a minute. In Skitsland, they ﬁll these human
pits with beeswax, and there is never any more trouble with them. I think I shall try the
beeswax plan myself, if this war don’t end pretty soon.

Since I quit being a baby, I have tried everything in earth, air and water, dirt not excepted,
and the plaguey excavation will not stay ﬁlled. I think there is a quicksand bottom to it,
if it has any bottom, which I doubt. Did I mention that the act of ﬁlling this pit was called
eating? I don’t want to deceive you. My mouth is the wonderful excavation alluded to.

It ’s very strange, but somehow I love to eat. Don’t you? I can’t help it. As far back
as I can remember, I loved to eat; and now the habit is so conﬁrmed that I don’t even
want to break myself of it. Yes, matters have come at length to such a pass, that unless I
go three times a day to a long table and thrust a variety of things into my excavation, I
am sure to feel badly. And sometimes I feel badly if I do thrust them down. Odd, is n’t
it? That ’s what you call dyspepsia, or the dyspepsy. I would n’t advise youto get the
dyspepsy, because the dyspepsy is a bad thing to have.

Not only do I love to eat, but I love to sit down and think about the good things I have
eaten in my time. Is that the case with yourself? It makes me mighty hungry — it ’s like
reading about feasts and drinking-bouts in novels, late at night, when all the restaurants
and oyster—cellars are shut up, and you couldn’t get a crust of bread to save your life.
Still, I love to think over the glorious meals I have enjoyed in times past, when I had the
stomach of a Muscovy drake, and could eat forever.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 453

The first good eating I remember, was at my Aunt Betsy’s. She lived in the County of
Cumberland, so far out of the world that she took to good eating as a resource against enmci.
She had more kinds of bread than any woman I ever heard of; splendid, hot, high, light
bread—the best bread for breakfast of all others, if I am a judge — and rolls, and biscuit,
and waﬂles, and buttercakes, and mufﬁns, and pone, and ash-cake, and hoe-cake, and “ salt-
risen” bread, and apple-bread, and cracklin bread — did you ever eat any cracklin bread ?—
and many others; to say nothing about fritters. and pan~cakes, and suet-dumplings, and
things of that sort. Then meats—-—especially at hog—killing time———when we revelled in
spare-ribs, sausages, chine, sauce, brains——particularly brains———-dear life! how I did eat
brains! and even chitterlings. But I can’t say that I loved chit’lins. Don’t ask me whether
I ate pig-tails, too. Do you think I would dare call myself a Virginian if I had not gnawed
many aone ; tasting it. gently with the tip of my tongue while it was burninghot, and sensing
it in the snow to hasten" its cooling, so that I might the quicker glut my appetite upon the
brown, crisp skin? How much more delightful, too, because of the presence of half-a-dozen
little negro playmates, engaged in the same occupation. Tell me nothing about Charles
Lamb’s Chinese theory of the origin of roast pig; mankind would never have learned the
sublime virtue of cooked pig—skin, but for the Virginia practice of eating pig-tails.

A few years later found me at a boarding-school [Edgehill] in New Jersey, and with an
appetite bigger than my breeches, so to speak. We lived plainly, as is not uncommon at
boarding—schools, and we talked French at table. .

During the session, which lasted ﬁve months, we were never allowed to eat butter and
molasses———glorious combination for the young stomach, when the butter is good, as it
generally was at Edgehill —-together, and that was a great hardship. On Saturdays, we
‘received from the Principal, who kept all our money, from twenty-ﬁve cents (never
more than that) down to four pence ha’pen11y--“ﬁp” they called it in Princeton Yankee
lingo —and even less than that ——- nothing, with bread and water, and “ kept in ” all day——
according to our good or bad behavior during the week. There was a negro man, named
Horace Scudder, who was a sort ofjanitor —— that is, ﬁre-maker and sweep-outer —who kept
a little shop in the basement, and sold ice-cream in the summer-time, oysters in winter, and
cakes, candy, apples, nuts, etc., all the time. Ice-cream was three cents a glass, as well as I
remember, and oysters fo’pence a dozen——and, you may depend upon it, Saturday night
saw little of the boys’ ‘money left. Consequently few of them came to supper. Then was
my time, for then I could indulge my rage for milk, of which a pint each was allowed us
for our evening meal. I seized every bowl within reach of me, and I pledge you my word
I ’ve drunk a half gallon —— perhaps a- gallon — eight pints make a gallon, den’t they ? —-a
gallon of milk many and many a Saturday night. Now I can’t drink it at all. Well, I had
my share at Princeton ; that’s one consolation. _

In the vacation ——many of us were from the far South, and stayed with Mr. Hart during
the vacation — we had many privileges —could lie abed till breakfast-time and eat butter
and molasses together. Great fathers! how I did eat! There» was a fellow named Jones,
from North Carolina, upwards of twenty years old — a mighty good fellow too — who had
come to Edgehill to learn a little Latin and Greek preparatory to studying medicine in
Philadelphia. Jones took quite a fancy to me, and told me privately, one day, that he never
got tired of eating bread and butter and molasses. ' After that, all misgivings, if I ever had
any, vanished. I fell upon the bread and butter and molasses and milk, even as Samson fell
upon the Philistines, when he slew them with the jawbone of an ass — heaps upon heaps
did he slay them. Thus was it with my incisors, my canines, my cuspids and bicuspids, in
the land and upon the viands of the Jerseys —even in the home of the Yankee, and upon
the victuals thereof, until I got me thence unto mine own place.

I pass over the sorrows I endured for a whole week at Edgehill from eating toasted cheese.
I make no mention of the day I spent in Commodore Stockton’s splendid orchard and ate
apples from breakfast till the sun went down ; and I say nothing of the glorious fries of sun-
perch "caught in Stony Brook on Saturdays ; or of the New Year’s dinners in Trenton; or of

454 AMERICAN LITERA’I‘URE.

Christmas and Fourth of July feasts, compounded of the contents of boxes of goodies sent‘
the boys, or made up by “fellows ﬂinging in ” and buying things down town. I leave all _

this out, and come at once to a notable eating — an unexpected treat, that I shall never for-
get. Attend : _

Under the big school-room was a room of the same size called the play-room. The boys
played there in wet weather, and dancing and fencing masters gave their lessons there. A
row of seats next the wall extended the whole length of each side of the room, and under
each seat was a box, which could be locked, and in which the boys kept their apples, shell-
barks, walnuts, chestnuts and such like. One day, after dinner, I was sitting in this room
by my lone self. What I was doing there, I don’t know, but think I was reading Midship-
man Easy. Suddenly a fellow, whose name I am ashamed to say I forget—ran in, popped

' something down on the seat beside me, and ran out, saying : “ Mother’s come; you may have

that.” What do you ‘think “that” was? “That” was a very large old hen, about nine
years old I should say, roasted to a turn by Mrs. Horace Scuclder, with plenty of gravy, anl
bread according. Remember, I had had my dinner. Nevertheless, I dismissed Midshipman
Easy; took “that ” by her legs (there was no knife and fork), tore her in two, and in ten min-

‘ utes consumed her to the very last bone, that lay glistening and naked in the gravyless and

breadless plate before my still greedy eyes. I tell you I could eat in those days! I wonder
if the boy that gave me that old “that ” is still living I hope he is, and his mother too. I1
he is, he will please accept my thanks; if he is gone, this shall be the record, and the
only one, I suspect, of his noble generosity.

Judge Longstreet.

AUGUSTUS BALDWIN LONGSTREET, LL.D., 1790-1870, was among the
most successful humorists of his day. His Georgia Scenes, for broad, irre-
sistible fun, has rarely been equalled.

Judge Longstreet was born in Edgeﬁeld District, S. C. He graduated at Yale, and studied
law at Litchfield, Conn. In 1821 he entered the Georgia Legislature. In 1822. he was
elected Judge of the Superior Court. After serving some years on the bench, he resumed
practice. In 1838 he became a Methodist minister. In 1839 he was elected President of
Emory College, Oxford, Ga., and held the position nine years. In 1848 he became Presi-
dent of Century College, and in the same year President of the University of Mississippi,
‘remaining in the latter post six years. In 1857 he was elected President of South Carolina
College. and remained there till 1861. His closing years were spent in retirement at Ox-
ford, Miss. I

Judge Longstreet’s publications were as various as his life. Besides the work already
named, he wrote Letters to Clergymen of the Northern Methodist Church; Letters from
Georgia to Massachusetts; A Letter to the London Times, on the admission of a Negro to
the International Congress; Master William Mitten, a Youth of Brilliant Talents, who was
Ruined by Bad Luck; and a great variety of other productions. But the only one that
survives to give him a permanent place in literature, is the work ﬁrst named, Georgia
Scenes, Characters, Incidents, etc., during the ﬁrst half century of the republic. Though
written in a spirit of broad fun, it is probably, like l)iedrich Knickerbocker’s History of
New York, the best and truest picture of the times that it describes, and will be valuable
as history a hundred years hence.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 455

GEORGIA THEATRICS.

If my memory fails me not, the 10th of June, 1809, found me, at about 11 o’clock in the
afternoon, ascending a long and gentle slope in what was called “The Dark Corner” of
the county of Lincoln.

Rapt with the enchantment of the season and the scenery’ around me, I was slowly rising
the slope, when I was startled by loud, profane, and‘ boisterous voices, which seemed to
proceed froma thick covert of undergrowth aho11t two hundred yards in the advance of
me, and about one hundred to the right of my road.»

“ You kin, kin you ? ”

“ Yes, I kin, and am able to do it, Boo-oo-oo! Oh, wake snakes, and walk your chalks!
Brimstone and— ﬁre ! Don’t hold me, Nick Stovall The ﬁght’s made up, and let ’s go at
it. My soul if I don’t jump down his throat, and gallop every chitterling out of him
before he can say ‘quit’ ! ”

“Now, Nick, don’t hold him ! Jist let the wild-cat come, and I ’ll tame him. Ned ’ll see
me fair ﬁght, won’t you, Ned?”

I “ Oh, yes; I’ll see you a fair ﬁght, blast my old shoes if I don’t.”

“ That ’s suﬂieient, as Tom Haynes said, when he saw the elephant. ' Now let him come.”

Thus they went on, with countless oaths interspersed, which I dare not even hint at,
and with much that I could not distinctly hear.

In mercy’s name! thought I, what band of ruﬂi-ans has selected this holy season and
this heavenly retreat for such‘ Pandemonian riots! I quickened my gait, and had come
nearly opposite to the thick grove whence the noise proceeded, when my eye caught indis-
tinctly, and at intervals. through the foliage of the dwarf-oaks and hickories which inter-
vened, glimpses of a man or men, who "seemed to be in a violent struggle; and I could
occasionally catch these deep-drawn, emphatic oaths which men in conﬂict utter when
they deal blows. I dismounted and hurried to the spot with all speed. I had overcome
about half the space which separated it from me, when I saw the combatants come to the
ground, and, after a short struggle, I saw the uppermost one (for I could not see the other)
make a lieavy 1.)l11n§__-_e with both his thumbs, and at the same instant I heard a cry in the
accent of keenest torture, “ Enough! My eye ’s out! ” E

I was so completely horror-struck that I stood transﬁxed for a moment to the spot
where the cry met me. The accomplices in this hellish deed which had been perpetrated
had all ﬂed at my approach; at least I supposed so, for they were not to be seen

“Now then, you cormshucking soul,” said the victor (a youth about eighteen years old),
as he rose from the ground, “come cutt’n your shines ’bout me agin, next time I come
to the Courthouse, will you! Get your owl eye in agin, if yer’ can!”

At this moment he saw me for the ﬁrst time. He looked exceedingly embarrassed, and
was moving oil‘, when I called to him, in a tone emboldened. by the sacredness of my office

and the iniquity of his crime, “Come back, you brute! and assist me in relieving your fel-

low-mortal, whom you have ruined forever I ”

My rudeness subdued his embarrassment in an instant; and, with a taunting curl of his
nose, he replied, “ You need n’t kick before you ’re spurr’d. There an’t nobody there, nor
han‘t been nother. I was jist seein’ how I could ha’ font.” So saying, he bounded to his
plough, which stood in the corner of the fence about fifty yards beyond the battle-ground.

And would you lwlleve it. gentle reader! his report was true. All that I had heard and
seen was nothing more nor less than a Lincoln rehearsal; in which the youth who had just
left me had played all the parts of all the characters in a court-house ﬁght.

I went to the ground from which he had risen, and there were the prints of two thumbs,
plunged up to the balls in the mellow earth, about the distance of man’s eyes apart; and
the ground around was broken up as if two st.-igs had been engaged upon it.

456 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

VI. M ISCELLANEOUS VVRITERS.

Bayard Taylor.

BAYARD TAYLOR, 1825 , has excelled, almost equally, in so many
different lines of literary effort, that it is not easy to assign him to any one
department of letters. He is eminent as a Traveller and a writer of Trav-
els, as a Newspaper Correspondent, as a Novelist, as a Poet, as a Poetical
Translator. There seems no resource, therefore, but to place him at the
head of Miscellaneous writers, although this association separates him some-
What from those with whom he is most associated in the public mind.

Mr. Taylor is a native of Kennet Square, Chester County, Pa., where he has now ﬁxed his
residence after his many travels by land and sea. He was originally an apprentice in a
printing-office of _his native place.

In 1844, at the age of nineteen, he set out for Europe, and travelled afoot, for two years,

with light purse and light heart. The experiences of this pedestrian tour appeared in 1846,,

in Views a-Foot, or Europe Seen with Knapsack and Staff. This work, the ﬁrst of a long
series, established the author’s reputation at once.

Views a-Foot was followed, in 18:30, by Eldorado, a Voyage to California, a work which ap-
peared originally in the shape of letters to the NewYork Tribune. The gold-fever was then
at its height, and Mr. Ta.ylor’s lettersdescribing that period of excitement and the birth-
throes of the new Paciﬁc State, were eagerly devoured by hundreds of thousands of readers.

Eldorado was followed, in 1854, by A Journey to Central Africa, or, as it is generally
called, A Voyage on the Nile. The contrast in style and tone between the restless, reckless
American society of Eldorado, and the quiet, dreamy dlolcefcor niente of the Nile, is one well
worthy of note.

In 1854. appeared The Lands of the Saracen; in 1855, A Visit to India., China, and Japan;
in 1857, North Travel, or Sweden, Denmark, and Lapland; in 1859, Travels in Greece and
Russia; in 1867, Colorado. To these may be added some minor volumes —-of sketches rather
than of continuous narrative --—such as At Home and Abroad, By-Ways of Europe, etc.

Besides his books of travel, Mr. Taylor has also delivered of late years, many hundred
lectures. —

His merits as a narrator are too well known to call for any special discussion in this
place. The st.ylc is just what it should be-——easy, sprightly, diversiﬁed, neither ainbitiously
soaring into turgid eloquence nor lapsing into wearisome monotony. It is evidently the
expression of a genial, healthy mind, alive to the beauties of the external world, and in sym-
pathy with mankind in all its motley phases. I _

As a novelist, Mr. Taylor made his debut in Hannah Thurston, published in 1863, which
was speedily followed by John Godfrey’s Fortunes. The story of Kennett, published in 1866,
is probably his best novel, although that title may be disputed by The Picture of St. John -
a metrical romance -01‘ by Joseph and his Friends.

Mr. Taylor belongs to what is sometimes called the realistic class of novelists. His novels.

are, as they claim to be, accurately drawn pictures of certain phases of American life, not
entering into the marvellous or the profoundly emotional, but still idealized above the
commonplace. The writer’s art is shown in the execution, rather than in the_ subject mat-
ter, while the style is eminently clear and healthy, and interspersed with genial touches of
poetic feeling and judicious reﬂection. I _

In addition to these novels of his own invention, Mr. Taylor has also published a transla-
tion of Auerbach’s Villa on the Rhine.

FROM 185().To THE PRESENT TIME. 457

In‘1855, Griswold hazarded the prediction concerning Mr. Taylor: “Eminent as he
is as a writer of travels, his highest and most enduring distinction will be from his poetry
. . . . his travels will hereafter be to his poems no more than those of Smoilett were to his
extraordinary novels.” It will be interesting to see how far that prophecy has been
fulﬁlled.

At that time Mr. Taylor had published Ximena (written before he was twenty years of
age), Rhymes of Travel, The American Legend, and the Book of Romances and Lyrics.
These had been favorably received. Edgar A. Poe, that most fastidious of critics, was espe-
cially pointed in his praise of the rising poet, pronouncing him to be “ the most terse, glow-
ing, and vigorous of all our poets, young or old —in point of expression.”

Since then there have appeared Poems of the Orient, Poems and Ballads, Poems of Home
and Travel, The Poets Journal, The Picture of St. John, Frithiof’s Saga (a translation from
the Swedish), The Ballad of Abraham Lincoln, a.nd several fugitive pieces.

The latest and greatest, however, of Mr. Taylor‘s poetic efforts is the translation of
Goethe’s Faust. The diﬁiculties of such an undertaking can be appreciated only by those
who are familiar with the original. It will be suﬂicient to say that Hr. Taylor’s rendering
has met with the warmest praise from Americans, Eniglisli, and Germans. Even those who
are most critical in theirjudginents upon translations cannot withhold from ’l‘aylor‘s Faust
their candid approval. The thought of the original is scrupulously preserved, the metre
and the rhyme are retained even in the most intricate passages, and the translation has
about it so much of the atmosphere of dignity of the original as to impress the lover of
Goethe with a strong sense of the translator’s thorough sympathy with his master. It is
indeed a most reﬁned and scholarly work, and places Mr. Taylor on the bench of honor by
the side of Longfellow and Bryant. The translator is at present engaged upon a life of
Goethe, which we may conﬁdently expect to be the most complete and sympathizing reve-
lation of the outxrard andinner life of German_\’s master-mind, for the biographer will
bring to his task every qualiﬁcation of training, experience, research, and poetic insight.

Among all our American writers it is diﬂ‘icult' to name one who exempliﬁes in a more
striking degree the Boratian aphorism, Mens sjanct in some corpora. To those who know him
personally, Mr. Taylor’s capacity for work of a high order and a diversiﬁed character is
marvellous. No less admirable is the progressive development of his talents, and his steady
and rapid growth into fame and inﬂuence against obstacles that would have thwarted
an ill-balanced genius.

Gen. D. H. Strother,——“ Porte Crayon.”

GEN. DAVID HUNTER STEOTHER, 1816 -—, of Berkeley Springs, Va.,'
the “ Porte Crayon” of Harper’ s Magazine, is known to all classes of readers
by his genial pen-and-pencil sketches of life and ‘scenery in the Witching
mountain scenery of the Old Dominion.

Gen.‘Strother was born in Martinsburg, Berkeley County, Va. Up to the age of twelve
he received the ordinary English and classical education afforded by the village academy.
Having almost from ‘infancy shown a fondness for the arts, he was sent to Philadelphia,
in 1829, to study drawing with Persico, and afterwards with Pietro Ancora, an Italian
drawing-master, who lived on Walnut street, between Third and Fourth streets.

In 1883 he entered the Sophomore Class of Jefferson College, at Cannonsburg, Pa, but
having little taste for regular studies and less for college rules, his unproﬁtable career
there terminated in less than a year.

The three years following were passed in feeble attempts at the study of law and medi-
cine, aimless and desultory reading, wild sports and idle adventures in the mountains of
Virginia. In 1886 he went to New York, and entered as a pupil of S. F. B. Morse, then
Professor of Painting in the University of New York.

458 AMERICAN LITERATUIEE.

In the fall of 1838 Mr. Strother went to the West, prc-fessedly as a portrait painter.
During his sojourn there he visited the States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Ken
tucky, spending his time principally in hunting, ﬁshing, sight—seeing, and adventure, eXer~
cising his art at intervals, only as it became necessary to replenish his purse.

Returning from the West he sailed for Europe, in 1810, and spent several years studying
painting in the galleries of Paris, Florence, and Rome.

Here, as at home, he gave the smallest portion of his time and effort to the specialty he
had adopted, but devoted himself mainly to music, literature, and the modern languages.
His favorite occupation, however, was the observation of men and manners, to which end
he travelled over a great portion of Italy on foot, seeking by-roads, obscure districts, and
towns not named in the guide-books.

During this time he wrote to his friends in the United States a number of letters, which
were published in a country newspaper, and attracted some general notice. ‘

Visiting France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, and England, he 1‘etu1‘ned to the United
States, and in 1845 took up his residence in the city of New York, where, under the direc-
tion of John G. Chapman, he acquired and practised the art of drawing on wood for the
engravers, illustrating a number of tracts, books, and pamphlets.

For the next four years, he passed his time between New York and Virginia, dividing
his summers between wild sports in the mountains and gay society at the Virginia Springs,
and working at the graphic arts during the winter languidly, like one who has not yet
found his true vocation.

In 1849 he married in Martinsburg, and took up his abode at his father’s house, abandon-
ing all business and professional eﬁort, and occupying himself with art and literature only
as amusements. 8

During the next three years he has left no record, except some characteristic sketches in
oil and crayon, and the illustration of John P. Kennedy’s “Swallow Barn.”

It was in__1852 and 1853 he made those pleasant journeys through the picturesque regions
of Virginia, the results of which were offered to the Harpers for publication in 1853. From
this date until the spring of 1861, his pen and pencil were rarely idle, as the pages of Har-
per’s Magazine and 1/Veekly may attest.

His principal productions, named in the order in which they appeared, are as follows:‘

Virginia Canaan, 1 paper; Porte Crayon and his Cousins, 5 papers; ’1‘he Dutchman and
the Bear, 1 paper; The Dismal Swamp, Va., 1 paper; North Carolina Illustrated, 5 papers;
A Winter in the South, 6 papers ; A Reminisceiice of Rome, 1 paper ; Rural Pictures, 1 paper;
A Summer in New England, 6 papers. '

Besides those which were published in the Magazine between 1853 and June, 1861, he
published the following in the Weekly: Visit to Jamestown, Va.; Pompeys Philosophy,-
verse; Letters and Illustrations of John Brown’s Raid, etc., etc.

On the breaking out of the war, in 1861, Mr. Strother moved his family to the Berkeley
Springs, and abandoning literary pursuits, joined the United States Army, under the com-
mand of Major-General Patterson, which hadjust entered Virginia. He entered the service
as Civil Assistant in the Corps of Engineers, and was afterward commissioned Captain,
Assistant Adjutant—Genera1, Colonel of Cavalry, Chief of Cavalry, Inspector-General, and
Chief of Staff of the Army of West Virginia. ' '

Having served in ten campaigns, twelve pitched battles, and twenty--two minor actions,
he received from the National Government at the end of the wa.r the honorary brevet of
Brigadier—General, and a civil appointment to Buenos Ayres, which latter he declined.

In May,1865, he accompanied Governor Pierpont to Richmond, in the capacity of Aid,
and was there appointed Adjutant-General of Virginia, and assisted in the paciﬁcation and
reconstruction of the State.

On the 1st of May, 1866, he resigned this oﬂice and retired to his home at the Berkeley ’

Springs, to recuperate his broken health and fortunes.

FROM 1850 To THE PRESENT TIME. 459

During the years 1866-67-68 be furnished eleven illustrated papers to Harper’s Magazine,
entitled, Reminiscences of the War.

In 1868-69-70 he wrote and illustrated a serial called the Young Virginians, which ap-
peared in the Riverside Magazine. Since 1869 he has published nothing except some news-
paper articles, and an illustrated paper in Harper’s Magazine on The Watkins Glen.

He is now occupied in getting up a series of illustrated papers on the Mountains and
Mountaineers of West Virginia, for Harperls Magazine, and in completing his Personal Re-
collections of the War.

JOHN Ross BROWNE, 1817—1875, was an enterprising writer of travels, whose sketches both
by pen and pencil were very popular. They appeared originally as contributions to Har-
per’s Magazine, and were published afterwards as separate volumes ; Etchings of a Whaling
Cruise; Yusef, a Crusade in the East; An American Family in Germany; Crusoe’s Island;
Land of Thor; Adventures in the Apache Country. He was appointed Minister to China

in 1868. . '

JAMES JACKSON J ARVES, 1818 -——, was born in Massachusetts. He spent several years in
travel among the islands of the Paciﬁc. He has published History of the Hawaiian or
Sandwich Islands; Scenes and Scenery of the Sandwich Islands; Kiana, a Tradition of Ila-
waii ; Scenes and Scenery in California; Parisian Sights and French Principles seen through
American Spectacles; Italian Sights and Papal Principles seen through American Spec-
tacles; Art-Hints on Architecture‘, Sculpture, and Painting; Art-Thoughts; Confessions
of an Inquirer.

J. C. Fletcher.

JAMES COOLEY FLETCHER, 1823 , has become extensively known
by his Work on Brazil and the Brazilians, and by his various missionary
labors in that country. A

Mr. Fletcher was born at Indianapolis, Ind. His father was for many years a leading
lawyer of central Indiana, -who had exalted views of education, and sent no less than six of his
sons to Brown University, Providence, R. I. J. C. Fletcher, after his preparatory studies at
Phillips Exeter Academy, entered Brown Universityvin 1842, and graduatediin 1846. In
1847 he commenced his theological course in the Seminary at Princeton. He spent two
years at Princeton, and then leaving, determined to devote his exertions to preaching the
gospel in Catholic countries. He went to Europe to complete his theological course and to
perfect himself in the French language, with the idea of becoming a missionary to Ilayti.
For this purpose he studied in Paris, and afterwards in the Theological School of Geneva,
Switzerland, under Dr. Merle d’Aubigné. He married at Geneva a daughter of Dr. Cesar
Malan.

1 He returned to the United States in 1850; and in 1851 the mission to Hayti was abandoned,
and he was sent to Rio de Janeiro as the Chaplain-missionary of the American and Foreign
(Thristian Union, and of the American Sea_men’s Friends’ Society. At Rio de Janeiro, in
addition to his services as chaplain, he was called for a time to be the Secretary of the United
Siates Legation, which brought him in Contact with the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro II.
This mere diplomatic acquaintance ripened into a long and intimate friendship. «

In 1854 Mr. Fletcher returned to the United States via the Straits of Magellan and the
Isthmus of Panama, thus making the entire tour of South America. Some months were
spent in the United States, when he went again to Brazil in 1855, travelling three thousand
miles in distributing the Bible in that Empire. In 1856 he "returned to the United States
via Europe.

him and Rev. D. P. Kidder, D.D., was published simultaneously in the United States and
England, and had an extensive sale in botl1 countries. The leading Reviews in America
and England gave it most commendatory 11otices; and nea.rly all in the latter country fol-
lowed the tone of the long article of the London Athenzeum, which began with this state-
ment, that “Brazil was never before so fully, so faithfully, so artistically photographed.”
Prescott, the historian, who was more able to judge of a work on South America than any
other writer, gave Brazil and the Brazilians the highest praise for its fulness and research.

In 1868 the eighth edition of this work was published by Little & Brown, of Boston, and
Sampson Low & Co., of London. Mr. Fletcher in the last edition gave the result of four new
tours made in Brazil during 18862-63-64-65.

In 1862 he travelled two thousand miles up the Amazon, and in this ‘journey made inci-
dentally such a collection of rare objects of natural history for Professor Agassiz, that it led
to the correspondence between the sowcmt and the Emperor of Brazil, which ﬁnally resulted
in Professor Agassiz going to Brazil in 1865 for his extended explorations of that empire.

In 1864-5, Mr. Fletcher was the meansof inducing the lirazilian Government to join the
United States in establishing a line of steamships between New York and Rio de J aneiro.

From 1846 Mr. Fletcher became connected with the press, both secular and religio.us, as a.
correspondent, and as a contributor of editorials. ‘While ﬁnishing his studies in Europe
he was a regular contributor to the New York Observer. His articles on the Waldenses,
whom he visited, were not only widely copied i11 England and America, but were repub-
lished in pamphlet form in Calcutta.

The principal journals to which he contributed letters or editorials were the New York
Evening Post, New York Journal of Commerce, the Providence Journal, the Boston J our-
nal, and the Boston Transcript. From time to time he contributed to the North American
Review, Harper’s Weekly, and other literary publications.

For a number of years be occupied his Winters in lecturing before lyceums in the United
States and England.

In 1869 he was appointed United States consul to Oporto, Portugal, where he is completing
a work on Pompeii, on which he has been laboring for some years, and in the prosecution
of which he has twice visited Italy. I

RAPHAEL SEMMES, 1810 , is a native of Maryland. He entered the navy of the United
States, but at the outbreak of hostilities joined the Confederate service. At first Semmes
was in commandof the Sumter, but. was transferred in 1862 to the notorious Alabama, in
command of which vessel he ravaged American commerce for nearly two years, until he was
defeated and the Alabama. sunk off Cherbourg by the Kearsarge. Semmes himself escaped
in an English steam-yacht. Before the Civil War, Semmes published two works, not very
widely known: Service Aﬂoat and Ashore during the Mexican War, and General Scot.t’s
Campaign in the Valley of Mexico. In 1864 he published his Cruise of the Sumter and the
Alabama, in 2 volumes. The work has no special literary excellence; it is merely the

straightforward account of a brief but remarkable career.

ﬁne fancy, with keen appreciation of the beautiful in natural scenery.”-Poe.

“ He has written of the sea with more freshness and graphic power, with more true fancy
and poetic feeling, than Falconer, or many others of a higher reputation.” —Whz'pple.

Henry Giles.

REV. HENRY GILES, 1809 ———, . acquired great celebrity twenty years
ago, or more, as a public lecturer, chieﬂy on literary and historical topics.
These lectures, with other of his writings, have since been published.

In reply to some inquiries respecting his life, Mr. Giles has sent the following interesting
account, which is given in his own words, with some slight abbreviations:

“ More than sixty years ago I was born near Gorey, County of Wexford, Ireland. My
parents were very young—-little acquainted with the ways of life, and soon after, their
course was through a long and stern struggle. My father owned a small property, which
gradually went from him by little and little, and which he had no faculty to increase—my
mother had ﬁve hundred pounds, which went in the‘ same way. My parents had, notwith-
standing, good faculties ‘and good breeding; but these did not help them to prudence or
economy-, or any of the practical arts of life. I thus ﬁrst became acquainted in my young
days with the County of Wexford; but afterwards with Dublin and parts adjacent to it.

“But the portions of Ireland I became the most acquainted with, which I knew the most
familiarly, and loved the most clearly, are parts of the County of Tipperary, the city of Cork,
and the town of Belfast. My mother’s family were Tipperary people, mostly in the neigh-
borhood of Cashel and Clonmel, and among them the greater portion of my youth was spent.
My mother had an only sister, whose family was large, whose means were small, whose
husband contrived, notwithstanding, to keep a private tutor for his children. Among
these much of my early life was passed; and in the school-room, though seldom aided by
the teacher, Iicontrived to pick up a few scraps of early learning.

“At this time I was a Catholic, though most of my relations and connections were mem-
bers of the Churchof England, except my aunt. With slight preparation and but early
years, I became myself a tutor. in which situation I continued for about a year. This was
broken up by my mind changing in religious thought to thejdoctrines of the Church of
England. I lost my employment-—b11t not the friendship of the family among whom I
lived. They were Catholics; but they always remained among the truest, the best, the
most affectionate acquaintances with whom my life has been associated. I

“ From this I went to live with my brother, who was then near Cork. I was not long here
when I was engaged in Cork. to visit the poor, and to read the Scriptures among them. In
the mean while, I had a single pupil, and advanced my own studies in mathematics, French,
and classics; most of which I have since forgotten. _

“I passed about three years in this place and in this career; then another change ‘came
over my mind, and altered my course. My belief changed to Unitarianism. I went on,
then, to Belfast. Here, for a. time, I entered the Academy, and devoted the short while I
remained there to the study of Greek and Latin. After this I went to Greenock in Scotland,
where I became a minister, and a preacher of Unitarianism. I preached here for about three
years. From this I passed to Liverpool, where I had been chosen minister of the Toxteth
Park Chapel. After three or four years had passed over me there, then I first saw this
country, in New York, in March, 1840.

“ I remained there almost unknown for a period of nearly three months. Letters of intro-
duetion I had to some, bu.t after the delivery of ‘one or two, I gave up the task. Gradually
I became known. I wrote an article, and sent it to the Christian Examiner; it was ac-
cepted and paid for. The Examiner was at that time conducted by the Rev. William Ware,
from whom I afterwards shared a world of kindness. The Rev. F. Holland, then living
in Brooklyn, was a man to whose goodness I became much indebted. He got me to lecture
in Brooklyn, and gave his church for the purpose. I lectured on Robert Burns; and this
was the ﬁrst lecture in my life for which I was paid. Mr. Brooks, a graciously benignant
man, who lived then in Greenwich Street, found me out, knew I was poor, and took me to

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 463

his house, where I remained forsix or seven weeks, until I received an invitation to Boston,
whither I always had wished to go. The person who gave me that invitation to his parents’
home was the Rev. George Simmons, a remarkably ﬁne young man, then in the freshness
of his eloquence, fervor, and enthusiasm. V

“ Here I was received with the most hospitable urbanity, and spent three weeks of genuine
and honielike tranquillity. At this time I became acquainted with the venerable Dr.
Channing, the Wares, and others of the best people in Boston and its neighborhood. I had
already become kindly known in New York to the Rev. Dr. Dewey and the Rev. Mr. Bellows.

“ Shortly after this, I prepared a few lectures, and began to give them with as much suc-
cess as I could expect. My course gradually enlarged, the lectures became more varied and
more numerous, until lecturing became my only regular course of life.

“ About 1850, I- married, in Bangor, a Miss Louise Lord, of Buckport, Me. We had three
children, two girls and a boy. The youngest girl, about seventeen, was drowned while
boating on the Penobscot, in Buckport, where she was staying with her grandmother. Her
elder sister died of a decline nearly a year ago. The son, much the youngest, is now the
one child spared to us. ‘

“ About eight years ago a disease came on me, which gradually paralyzed me from toes

‘to hips. I was in this helpless state from three to four years. Then unaccountably my

power was restored, and age was upon me. So I am.”

The following is a list of Mr. Giles’s publications : Lectures and Sketches, 2 vols.;
Christian Thoughts on Life, etc., a series of discourses, 1 vol.; Illustrations of Genius in
Some of its Relations to Culture and Society, 1 vol.; Human Life in Shakespeare; Lectures
and Essays on the Irish, and other Subjects.

S. S. COX.

SAMUEL SYLVESTER COX, 1824 ,Member of Congress for ‘many
years from the State of New York, has considerable note as a public lec-
turer, and is the author of several interesting Volumes.

Mr. Cox was born in Zanesville, Ohio. He attended the Ohio University at Athens, but
subsequently became a student of Brown University, Rhode Island, where he paid his ex-
penses by means of literary labor, graduating with honor in the class of 1846. His attach-
ment to Rhode Island was shown the other day in Congress when the statue of Roger
Williams was presented.

After studying law and practising the profession for two or three years, Mr. Cox went to

Europe, and on his return published The Buckeye Abroad, a well-written and popular book-

Returning in 1853, Mr. Cox became owner an_d editor of the Columbus (Ohio) Statesman, the
Democratic organ of the State. In 1855 he was tendered the secretaryship of legation to
England, but declined, being unable satisfactorily to dispose of the Statesman. Subsequently,
in the same year, he accepted the secretaryship of legation to Peru, but on account of ill-
health was compelled to resign. . ,

He was elected a Representative from the Columbus district to the Thirty-ﬁfth, Thirty-
sixth, Thirty-seventh, and Thirty-eighth Congresses. During his Congressional career he
has served as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, and as one of the Regents of
the Smithsonian Institution. He is still a member of that board. He was the nominee of
his party for Speaker against Mr. Colfax in the Thirty-eighth Congress. _ Although in the
minority, he accomplished many reforms, especially as to the rules. On his motion, the
Committee of Ways and Means was divided into three committees —Banking and Currency,
Ways and Means, and Appropriations. He is a member of the Committee on Banking and
Currency, and is charged with the duty of inquiring into the question of resumption of
specie payments, of which he has been a persistent advocate.

 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

In March, 1805, Mr. Cox removed to New York city, and in that year published a b00K
entitled Eight Years in Congress.

Soon after the publication of the above-mentioned work, Mr. Cox made another visit to
Europe, spending his time while abroad chieﬂy on the islands and shores of the Mediterra-
nean. He gave to the public, as the result of his observations, a volume, which was pub-
lished in London and New York, entitled A Search for Winter Sunbeanis, a work much more
elaborate and philosophical t_han books of travel generally. Mr. Cox also is a popular lec-
turer on literary themes. The latest subjects upon which he has appeared upon the plat-
form were Spain, and the Poetry of Mechanism.

In 1868, Mr. Cox was elected a Representative from the Sixth district of New York to the
Forty-ii rst Congress. and in 1870 was re-elected over Mr. Greeley. No member of the minority
has taken a more important part in the proceedings than Mr. Cox. His principal efforts
have been made on subjects connected with the tariff. Graduating under Dr. Wayland, at
Brown University, he early became interested in discussions of that nature. One of his
prize essays at college, which was successful, was upon the Repeal of the Corn Laws, in
1846. He has been constant in protesting against the doctrine of Protection, presenting
his views with elaborate statistics. The revenue reform which he contemplates is sweep-
ing, believing, as he does, that the custom-house system is a perpetual fraud on the body of
the people.

“ Few men in Congress, certainly none on the Democratic side, ‘ hold the House ’ better
than Mr. Cox. He is a ready, graceful, self-possessed, and vigorous debater, so mingling argu-
ment with wit, and sarcasm with good-humor, as always to command attention and respect.
He is a high personal favorite with members, irresp_ective of party, and is ever on the alert
to serve his constituents, regardless of politics.” ——Harper’s Weekly.

THOMAS S. KIRKBRIDE, M.D., 1809 ————, is widely known for his skill in the treatment of
the insane, and for his writings and reports on the subject of insanity. He is a native of

Hospital, 1833 and ’34; to the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane. from 1841 to the pres-
ent time (1872). His Annual Reports for the last thirty years contain a vast amount of
thoughts, suggestions, and information in regard to the treatment of the insane. Besides
these Reports he has published: Appeal for the Insane; Construction, Organization, and
General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane ; Essays on Insanity and the Cure of the
Insane, in the American Journal of Insanity, etc., etc.

ENOCH C. WINES, D. D., 1806 ———, was born in Hanover. N. J., and educated at Middlebury
College. He was for several years Professorof Mathematics in the United States Navy. He
has been Principal of the Edgehill School at Princeton, N. J., Professor in the Philadelphia

JOHN B. GOUGH, 1817 +—, the celebrated temperance lecturer, was born in England, and
was originally an editor. He fell into habits of intemperance, and was on the verge of de-
struction, when he was rescued by the kind and judicious interposition of a friend of tem-
perance. lle thenceforward devoted himself to the advocacy of total abstinence, and has
lectured on this subject with unabated and ever-increasing interest, to large audiences, for

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 465

nearly thirty years. Asa popular lecturer, both on this subject and on others, he is un-
rivalled. His only published work is his Autobiography.

R. G. PARDEE, 1811-1869, was well known for his labors in the work of establishing Sun-
day-schools. Though possessing only a limited education, and with little training as a
writer, he produced two books of great value in his special department, The Sunday-School
Worker, and The Sabbath-School Index. He also wrote A Complete Manual for the Culti-
vation of Strawberries.

Mrs. C. H. Dall.

' Mas. CAROLINE HEALEY DALL, —— ———, has written numerous books
and- pamphlets on subjects connected with social and political reform, and
particularly on the subject of Women’s rights. Her productions have been
marked by point and vigor, and show various reading and scholarship, as
Well as cultivated taste. She has not sought publicity, yet has not shrunk
from it when loyalty to truth and duty has seemed to her to call for public
action, Whether through the press or on the platform.

Mrs. Dall is the wife of a Unitarian minister, the Rev. Charles Dali, and daughter of Mr.
Mark Healey,,a.n India merchant of Boston. She was born and educated in that city, and
at present resides there, although she has lived at different times in Baltimore, Washington,

etc. ; Patty Gray’s Journey, 3 vols.

The book first named was written at the age of eighteen, though not published until seven
years later, in 1849. It consisted of a series of moral and religious essays, written originally
for her own use in her Sunday-school class. .

Mrs. Dall has the reputation of being a tireless and conscientious student. In addition to
her work as a writer and a lecturer, she has taken an active part in Sunday-schools and in
various schemes of organized charity, and has had several classes of adults in philology,
Biblical criticism, Herodotus, and Shakespeare.

REV. CHARLES LORING BRACE, 1826 ————, a native of Connecticut, has published several
interesting volumes of travel: Norsefolk, Travels in Norway and Sweden; Home Life in
Germany; Hungary. Mr. Brace has been very active in the establishment of the Children’s
Aid Society, New York.

VVILLIAM WETMOEE STORY, 1819 , is a native of Massachusetts, the son and biographer
of Judge Story. Mr. Story studied at Harvard, and was admitted to the bar. In 1848, how-
ever, he abandoned the profession, and gave himself up wholly to art. IIe is now one of the
prominent sculptors in Rome, of which city he is a permanent resident. His statues and

2E

busts have earned for him aworld-wide reputation. Indeed it is not hazarding much to
assert, to the shame of his countrymen, that Mr. Story’s genius is far better appreciated in
England and in Italy than in America. His statues of The Shepherd Boy, Little Red Riding
Hood, Cleopatra, Sappho, are among the very best that modern art has produced. As an
author, Mr. Story is known almost exclusively by two works: one, an excellent biography
of his father, in two volumes; the other is Roba di Roma, a charming sketch on Walks and
Talks about Rome. He has also published several occasional poems, and thereby, in the
language of Francis Bowen, “narrowly escaped being a poet.” He has contributed occa-

sionally to The Atlantic Monthly. Before abandoning the legal profession, he published.

several able lawtreatises, on the Law of Contracts not under Seal, and on the Law of Sales
of Personal Property.

REV. WILLIAM C. DANA, 1810 —, pastor of the Central Presbyterian Church in Charles-
ton, S. C., was born at Newburyport, Mass., and graduated at Dartmouth. He has published

of Masonic Jurisprudence; Mackey’s Masonic Ritualist; Lexicon of‘ Freemasonry; The
Mystic '1‘ie; The Symbolisms of Freemasonry. He edited also the Ahiman Rezon.

Madame Le Vert.

»M:as. OCTAVIA WALTON LE VEET, , of Mobile, has been long

and widely known for her literary tastes and accomplishments, although
her actual contributions to letters have been comparatively meagre.

Mrs. Le Vert was born near Augusta, Ga., but in her infancy was moved to Pensacola. Fla.
Her father, Col. George Walton, became Governor of Florida. In 1836, she was married to
Dr. Henry S. Le Vert, of Mobile. She visited Europe in 1853, and again in 1855. In 1858,
she published Souvenirs of Travel, in two vols. Another book, Sou.venirs of Distinguished
People, was announced in 1859, but did not make its appearance. She has contributed occa-
sional papers to the New York Ledger, and was said, in 1867, to have in preparation Sou-
venirs of the War. ‘ - .

Madame Le Vert’s social position has given her rare opportunities for seeing distinguished
persons, and her personal attractions, especially as a conversationist, have received the
warmest encomiums. One out of many equally competent witnesses is quoted: “ Madame
Le Vert is perhaps the only woman who has reigned as _a belle in both hemispheres, has
received the homage of chivalrous admiration, alike in the Northern and Southern sections

of the United States, as well as in the courtly circles of Great Britain and continental

Europe, and who, at the same time, has never been assailed by the shafts of envy or cal-
umny. She has had a remarkable experience in wearing the crown of beauty and genius-
it has been without a thorn.”—-Mrs. E. F. Ellet.

HENRY WASHINGTON HILLIARD, 1808 —-—, was born in North Carolina, and educated at
Columbia College, South Carolina. He studied law and practised for a time. In 1831, he

Professor La Borde.

MAXIMILIAN LA BORDE, M. D., 1804-1873, Professor of Rhetoric and
Literature in the University of South Carolina, was for thirty years

conspicuously associated with the fortunes of that important State institu-

tion.

Dr. La Borde was of Huguenot descent. He was born at Edgeﬂeld, S. C., and graduated
in 1821 at the College of which he was so long an ornament. He first studied law, then
medicine. After practising medicine for a time, and holding certain political preferments,
he became, in 1842, a Professor in South Carolina College (now the University of South
Carolina), and, to the time of his death, remained connected with its fortunes. Dr. La
Borde published three books: Introduction to Physiology; Story of Lethea and Verona;
History of South Carolina College. The work last named is the chief literary work of his
life, and is commended in the highest terms for the thoroughness of its information, and
for its calm, philosophical, and conscientious spirit.

Life and Character of George Peabody. ’

The Holcombes.

J AMES P., and WILLIAM H. HOLCOMBE, brothers, belonging to a Well-
known family in Lynchburg, Va., have acquired about equal distinction in
letters, though following different professions and moving in somewhat dif-

_ ferent lines of thought.

James P. Holcombe, 1820-1873, was educated partly at Yale, and partly in the University
of Virginia. He was, before the war, Professor in the University, his department being that
of Civil, Constitutional, a.nd International Law. The following are his publications: Selec-
tion of Leading Cases upon Commercial Law, decided by the Supreme Court of the United
States, 1847 ; Digest of the Decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1848; The
Merchant’s Book of Reference for Debtor and Creditor, 1848; Address before.the Alumni
of the University of Virginia,—1853'; Address before the State Agricultural Society, 1858:
Literature in Letters, 1868. The work last named is a compilation of the famous Letters of
the World, under classiﬁed heads.

William H. I-Iolcombe, M. D., 1825 , graduated at Washington College, Va, nu
studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. He practised for a time in Lynch-
burg; moved to Cincinnati in 1850; then to the interior of Louisiana; and ﬁnally to Ne v
Orleans, where he has lived ever since.

In 1852, Dr. Holcombe gave up allopathy, and published, in 1867, a pamphlet, entitled
How I Became a Homoeopa.th. In the introduction, he gives the following amusing account
of himself: ,

“I am the son of a doctor. I was born and bred in a medical atmosphere. My father’s
oﬂice was the favorite place for my games when a little boy, and for my reading and study

when a youth. The imposing shelves of imposing volumes, the big jars of hideous speci-
mens preserved in alcohol, the pervading odors of paregoric and lavender, the bloody-looking
map of the great sympathetic, on the wall, the long white skeleton grinning in the closet,
and the mysterious box containing the detached bones of a baby’s skull, made a strong im-
pression on my childish imagination. The old brown saddle-bags, with their incredible
stores of vials and packages and pill-box es, excited my special admiration. Physicians were,
in my estimation, the wisest, and greatest, and best of mankind. I saw the whole faculty
through the venerated form and character of my good father. We‘ differ as much from our
own selves at different times, as we do from each other. I havelived to question and scout
the old oracles, to abandon the ‘intensely respectable’ path of routine, to discover in the
old brown saddle-bags a Pandora"s box of evils, and to see how much ignorance and mischief
are soinetnnes concealed and consecrated under a medical diploma.”

Dr. llolconibe became also a Swedenborgian, and has written extensively for his new reli-
gion, as well as for his pro,fessiona1 faith. His writings have appeared mostly in the New
Church Herald and in the North American Journal of Homoeopathy. He has written also on
purely literary subjects for the Knickerbocker and the Southern Literary Messenger.

The following is a list of his books: The Scientiﬁc Basis of Homoeopathy, 1855; Yellow
Fever, and its Homoeopathic Treatment, 1856; Poems, 1860; Our Children in Heaven, Swe-
denborgian, 1868; The Sexes, 1869.

Henry Barnard.

HENRY BARNARD, LL. 1)., 1811 ————-, has acquired a national reputa-
tion by his labors in the cause of popular education, and by his numerous
and important publications on that subject.

Dr. Barnard is a native of Hartford, Conn., and a graduate of Yale, of the class of 1830.
He studied law and practised for a time. In 1837 he was elected a member of the State
Legislature. In that body he effected a reorganization of the Common School system. He
was for four years Secretary of the Board of School Commissioners. His ﬁrst annual report,
in 1839. was “ a bold and startling document, founded on the most painstaking and critical
inquiry.” — Chcmcellor Kent.

In his capacity as Secretary of the Board of Education in Connecticut, and afterwards in .

a similar position in Rhode Island, Dr. Barnard issued a series of reports, in which almost
every topic connected with popular education was discussed with earnestness and ability.
He has been a most ‘diligent collector of facts and of the opinions of eminent educators at
home and abroad, and has put forth these facts and opinions into convenient form in a
number of volumes of great value. The principal of these are the following: School
Architecture; Normal Schools in the United States and Europe; National Education in
Europe; History of Education in Connecticut; Hints and Methods for the Use of
Teachers. He published also the Connecticut Common School Journal, 4 vols. ; the Rhode
Island Journal of Instruction, 3 vols., and the American Journal of Education, 4 vols. He
was appointed United States Commissioner of Education on the organizationof that Bureau,
and while in that office issued several elaborate reports.

FREDERICK A. P. BARNARD, D.D., LL.D., 1809 ,is a native of Sheﬂield, Mass, and a
graduate of Yale, of the class of 1828. He has written several works on educational topics,
the principal ones being Letters on College G.overnment and the Evils Inseparable from the
American College System in its Present Form. Dr. Barnard taught for some years in insti-
tutions for the Deaf and Dumb. IIe became a Professor in the University of Alabama in
1848; President of the University of Mississippi in 1856; and President of Columbia College,
New York, in 1864.

CHARLES NORTHEND, I. M., 1811 , is a native of Newbury, Mass. He was educated at
Dummer Academy, l\’ewbury, and at Amherst. He remained only two years at Amherst,
but afterwards received from the college the honorary degree of A. M. He taught twenty

 

years, mostly in Salem and Peabody, M-.xss., and afterwards was Superintendent of Schools
in Peabody. Still later he was Assistant State Superintendent. He is now in the real
estate business, and lives at New Britain, Conn. Ile has published the following works:
Teacher and Parent; '1‘eacher’s Assistant; American Speaker; National Orator; Entertain-
ing Dialogues; Little Speaker; Little Orator; Child’s Speaker.

C. H. Wiley.

REV. CALVIN HENDERSON WILEY, 1819 , of North Carolina, ac-
quired reputation, ﬁrst as a novelist, by Alamance, and Roanoke, then as an
advocate of popular education, and writer of a valuable school—book, and
also as an earnest preacher of the gospel.

Mr. Wiley is of Scotch—Irish descent. He was born in Guilford County, N. C., in what is
known in that State and Virginia as the Piedmontese region. His ancestors were among the
famous Regulators, who claim, in the battle of Alamance, to have struck the ﬁrst blow for
freedom on the American continent. He was ﬁtted for college at Caldwell Institute, at
Greensboro’, and graduated at the University of North Carolina, in 1840. Having studied
law, he commenced practice in Granville county. '

In 1848 he was elected a member of the State Legislature, and took an active part in ad-
vocating the policy of internal improvements. _

In 1845 he published his ﬁrst novel, Alamance, embodying the interesting revolutionary
traditions of the region in which he was born. This was followed by Roanoke, or Where is
Utopia, a story illustrating especially the experiences of the English colonists along the
coast. All these novels were racy of the soil, and were received with favor.

Conceiving his duties, however, to be of a graver character than that of a romancer, Mr.
'Wiley, after the publication of Roanoke, abandoned novel-writing, and entered actively
upon the business of popular education. Ilis ﬁrst work in this line was a popular His-
tory of North Carolina, in a form suited to be used as a school reader. The work was a
model of its kind, and has become, as it deserves to be, a classic in that region. Mr. Wiley
purposed following up this work with a connected series of primary school books. But
being elected Superintendent of Common Schools for the State, he relinquished his pur-
pose and entered with all his energies upon the duties of the new oiﬁce.

The Common School system of North Carolina, begun in 1840, had only a feeble ex-
istence until 1851, when the office of State Superintendent was created and Mr. Wiley was
elected ﬁrst superintendent. He continued to be re-elected every two years, and generally
by a unanimous vote, although belonging politically to the old Whig party, and most of
that time in the minority. ,

In his position of State Superintendent Mr. Wiley achieved a great and noble work,
and at the time when the war broke out, North Carolina was probably further ad-
vanced in popular education, and mainly through his prudent and patriotic efforts, than
any other Southern State. He held on to his work, so far as circumstances would allow,
all through the war. At the close of the war the system was suspended for the want of
money. Mr.,Wiley was made, however, a member of the Literary Fund, and wrote a
pamphlet on The Swamp Lands of North Carolina, and was otherwise active in endeavoring
to create the means of carrying on the work of public education.

Mr. \Viley, at the time of his election to the Superintendency, was an elder in the Presby-

40

terian church. He began, soon after that, to feel it to be his duty to enter the ministry
He was licensed to preach in 1854, and ordained to the full work of the ministry in 1866.
In 1869, he was invited by the American Bible Society to become its agent in East and
Middle Tennessee, which position he still holds.

Mr. Wiley’s publications, in addition to those already named, are Scriptural Views of Na-
tional Trials, 1863; The North Carolina Form Book, and various tracts, essays, speeches, etc.

John Ogden.

JOHN OGDEN, A. M., 1824 -——,‘ of the Ohio Central Normal School, has
done good service in the cause of education, both by his labors as a teacher,
and by his writings, particularly by his Work on The Science of Education
and Art of Teaching.

Mr. Ogden was born near Mt. Vernon, 0. His early education was sadly neglected, so far
at least as “schooling ” was Concerned. His father lnoved, when John was a mere child,
to a part of the State — where Crestline now stands——that was almost an unbroken wilder-
ness, and where no schools existed until the boy was nearly eleven years old. Here he
spent his summers among the grand old forest-trees, his only educators,—working upon
the farm; and his winters —eXcept about two and a half months of the coldest weather,
when he attended a very indifferent country sch0o1—in supplemental and preparatory
work upon said farm. V

This continued until he was about nineteen years old, when, after teaching a winter school
for $11 a month in his home district, his father gave him a cow, which he drove twelve
miles and sold for $11. By these means he saved enough to attend a so-called high school,
(whose chief claim to such distinction consisted in the fact that it was kept up-stairs,) two
and a half months. The following summer, after teaching a winter school, he attended the
Ashland Academy, then in charge of the lamented Lorin‘Andrews, one of Ohio’s noblest
educators. Here he received his ﬁrst lessons in education. He remained at the Academy
for three summers, teaching during the intervening winters to pay his way.

After one summer’s failure as a book agent, and one more winter’s successful teaching,
he was called, in the spring of 1849, to take charge of one of the Grammar schools of
Columbus. He remained there three years, when, determined, although already twenty-
eight years old, to improve his education by taking a regular college Course, he entered
accordingly the Wesleyan University, Delaware, 0. Before completing his college course,
however, he was elected principal of the Normal Department which he had organized in
said University, and he conducted the same for three years. »

He was then called by the Ohio State Teachers’ Association to the principalship of the
McNee1y State Normal School, the first attempt made by Ohio teachers to establish a school
of this kind. While there he received the honorary title of A. M. He remained there three
years, when the teachers of theiState, feeling it too great a burden,——the school being sus-
tained by a voluntary percentage of each teacher’s salary, — were compelled to abandon the
project. He was then put into the ﬁeld as general agent for the Ohio Journal of Education,
and for Teachers’ Institutes. These he continued one year, during which time he wrote his
only published work, The Science of Education and the Art of Teaching. It was the fruit
of his courses of Lectures in the Normal Schools and in Teachers’ Institutes.

In the fall of 1858, he engaged with Hon. Henry Barnard, then Chancellor of the Wis-
consin University, in a series of teachers’ institutes for that State; and in the following
spring was elected Principal of the lVIi1mesota StateNorinal School, at Winona, Minn. This
school he organized and brought into successful operation. In the second year of the war,

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 471

he resigned and entered the army. He was captured in 1864, and remained a prisoner until
the close of the war.

After the close of the war, he was employed in the service of the Freedmen’s Bureau. In
this capacity, he established Fisk University, at Nashville, Tenn., for educating colored
teachers, and acted for some time as its Principal. He is at present Associate Principal of
the Normal School at Worthington, O.

IRA MAYHEW, 1814 —, is a native of Ellisburg, N. Y. He has taken a prominent part in
the cause of education, and has been at different times Superintendent of Public Institu~
tions in Michigan. He has published A Treatise on Popular Education for the use of Parents
and Teachers.

J. P. Wickersham.

JAMES PYLE VVICKERSHAM, LL. D., 1825 , State Superintendent
of Public Schools of Pennsylvania, has been one of the most successful of
American educational Workers. He has been a practical teacher; he has
had on a large scale the training of teachers; he has for several years
directed the educational system of one of the largest States in the Union;
he has Written several volumes on the work of education, and in each
department of effort he has been found equal to the occasion.

Mr. Wickersham was born in Chester County, Pa., of good old Quaker stock on both sides.
His ancestor, Thomas Wickersham, coeval with William Penn, came over with other Friends
from Cheshire, in England, in 1705, and settled within two miles of the spot where the
present Mr.W1'ckersham was born. On the mother’s side he came from the Pyle family,
also Friends and early settlers.

All his education, so far as received from schools, was obtained in Chester County,.at the
district schools, and at the Unionville Academy. In the latter he studied Latin, French,
Mathematics, and natural science. At sixteen he expressed a desire to study for a profes-
sion. ~ Ilis father objected, wanting him on the farm, but gave him the option of setting out
on his own resources. The plucky boy chose the latter, and since that time has made his
own way in the world. He entered at once upon his career as a teacher.

In the winter of 1841-42, he taught a district school at twenty dollars a menth, and then
went back to the Academy as a student. and so alternated for several years, teaching an.l
studying, until 1845, when he became Principal of the Marietta Academy, being then just
twenty-one years of age.

In 1854 he was elected the first County Superintendent of Lancaster County, and in 185.) he
began at Millersville a Normal Institute, which ended in the establishment of the State
Normal School at Millersville. This institution is one of the most successful of its kind in
the United States. Its erection was the special work of Mr. Wickersham.

In 1866, on the invitation of Gov. Curtin, Mr. Wickersham became State Superintendent
of Common Schools in Pennsylvania, in which position he still remains. As State Superin-
tendent, his measures have been marked by energy and wisdom, and have given a great
impulse to the cause of popular education. .

Besides .numerous printed Addresses, and contributions to educational journals, Mr.
Wickersham has published two books, which have had a large sale, and have taken their
place among the standard Works of the profession: School Economy, and Methods of In-
struction. '

SAMUEL S. RANDALL, 1809 , has been prominently connected, by his Writings and other-
wise, with the educational movements of the State of New York.

Mr. Randall was born at Norwich, Chenango County, N._ Y. He was educated at Oxford
Academy, 1822-23, and Hamilton College, 1824-25. He practised law for several years in
Chenango County, 1830-36; in 1836-37, he oﬂ‘iciated as Dep. Clerk of Assembly at Albany_
In May, 1837, he was appointed a clerk in the Department of Common Schools, and in 1838
General Deputy Superintendent of Common Schools. This otﬁce he held until 1854. After
a brief service as City Superintendent of the Brooklyn Public Schools, he was appointed
City Superintendent of the New York City Public Schools, and served during eight s11cces-
sive terms of two yearseach, until June, 1870, when he tendered his resignation. IIe has
since devoted himself exclusively to literary avocations.

In the fall of 1846, in consequence of ill-health, growing out of the excessive labors de-
volving upon him during the Free School Campaign, he retired for a brief period to a farm
in Fairfax County, Va.. and subsequently was appointed to a clerkship in the War Depart-
ment, under Adjutant-General Jones. This was during the administration of his cousin,
Henry S. Randall, as Secretary of State and Superintendent of Common Schools.

The following is a list of his publications: Mental and ﬂoral Culture; Incitements to the

‘Study of Geology; Educational Reader; Rural Reader; Common School Reader; Primary

Reader; Common School History and Manual; History of the State of New York, for Acade-
mies and Schools; History of the Common School System of the State of New York; First
Principles of Popular Education and Popular Instruction.

From 1845 to 1852, be edited the District School Journal, and was associate editor of the
Northern Light, published at Albany.

Mr. Randall has just completed A History of the Public School System of the City of New
York, as a companion volume to History of the Common School System of the State of New
York, 500 pages each, and has in MS., Walks with the Poets and Philosophers, and Conduct
and Character, a series of Essays.

W. Swinton.

WILLIAM SWINTON, 1834 —-——, Professor of English Literature in the
University of California, ﬁrst acquired general notoriety as a War Corre-
spondent. Since the close of the War, he has returned to literary pursuits,
Where he is Winning _fresh laurels.

Mr. Swinton was born in Salton, Scotland, April 23, 1834. When but a few months old,
hi_s parents removed to Edinburgh, and in 1844 emigrated to America. He pursued his
scholastic studies at Amherst College, Mass. While still in college, he had become a co.n-
tributor to Putna.m’s Magazine. I

Immediately after graduation —having in the meantime married—he accepted the posi-
tion of teacher in a female school in North Carolina. While so engaged, he continued assid-
uously his literary labors, being a frequent contributor to the magazines of the day. At
this time he produced in Putnam’s Monthly the series of philological papers subsequently
published under the title of Rambles Among VVords. After two years residence in the
South he removed to New York, where he continued to teach and write.

In 1858, he was invited by Mr. Raymond to become the literary critic of the New York
Times. In the columns of that paper his elaborate reviews of the most important publica-
tions of the day, such as Darwin‘s Origin of Species, Buckle’s History of Civilization, Wor-
cester’s Dictionary, Bancroft’s History, etc., received more attention than is usually accorded
to the fugitive essays of the daily journal.

.In-1862, Mr. Swinton exchanged the editorial chair for the saddle, and became the War

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 4733

Correspondent for the New York Times. In this capacity he described most of the memo-
rable actions in Virginia. In 1866, the fruit of his military observations and reﬁections ap-
peared in a volum_e entitled Campaigns of the Army of the Potomac, 1 vol. 8vo, 640 pages.
Concerning this volume, the London Saturday Review remarks: “ All that can possibly
be done from the Northern sources of "information has already been done by Mr. Swinton,
whose Army of the Potomac is a monument of military talent and industry, set forth with
elaborate clearness of exposition and in a ﬁne style of narrative. Americans compare Mr.
Swiuton to Napier, but his real place is nearer to that of Siborne, an historian whom he
much resembles in his admirable study of details and his desire honestly to reconcile vary-
ing testimony; while he rises above Siborne in style, impartiality, and the power of historic
grouping.”

In 1867 Mr.‘ Swinton published The Twelve Decisive Battles of the War, an octave volume
of 500 pages.

In 1869 he was elected to the chair of Belles Lettres in California University, where he
still ren'iains. On assuming his professional duties he began the preparation of a series of
educational text-books, among which two school Histories of the United States, together
with a Word-Book of Spelling, and a Manual of Word Analysis, have already been pub-
lished, to be followed by a series of school geographies and grannnars.

Dr. Alden.

JOSEPH ALDEN, D.D., LL.D., 1807 , of the New York State Nor-
mal School at Albany, has long been prominently before the public as a
leading educator and writer on educational topics. Dr. Alden’s services,
both literary and administrative, entitle him to the high rank which he
holds as the head of one of the oldest and strongest of our State institutions
for the education and training of teachers.

Dr. Alden is a native of Cairo, N. Y., and a graduate of Union, in the class of 1829. He
studied theology at Princeton. He has been successively Professor of Rhetoric in Williams,
Prof. of Moral Philosophy in Lafayette, President of Jefferson, and for several years past
Principal of the New York State Normal School in Albany.

Dr. Alden, besides his large work as an educator, has been diligent in the use of his pen,
writing almost constantly for the periodical press, and sending out at intervals instructive
volumes for the beneﬁt of his generation. I-lis earlier works were mostly for the young.
Among these may be mentioned, The Example of Washington; The Patriot’s Fireside; Re-
ligion in Fashionable Life, etc. Among his later writings are: Elements of Intellectual
Philosophy; The Science of Government in Connection with American Institutions, a text-
book for academics and colleges; The Citizen’s Manual, being an abridgment of the preced-
ing and intended for common schools ; Christian Ethics, or the Science of Duty.

“ Dr. Alden has the ability, and has had the courage, to write a small book 011 a large
subject (Intellectual Philosophy). 1Ie has written in good English where many think it
necessary to write in bad German. He has dared to write clearly, where obscurity and mist
are too often taken as indications of depth. We need hardly add, we think he has made a
good text-book. We know not a better on the subject of which he treats."’—Szmday School
Times. .

Dr. Alden’s method of treating the subject of Ethics, appealing directly to the Bible as
authority in all matters of duty, commends itself to every Christian reader and teacher;
while his clear, aphoristic style of expression relieves the subject of much of the obscurity
and fog in which it is usually and unnecessarily enveloped.

ALFRED HOLBROOK, 1816 --—, was born in Darby, Conn., son of the well-known philan-
thropist, Josiah Holbrook, who did so much in the way of invention and of unselﬁsh labor
towards popularizing scientiﬁc apparatus, and introducing it into .the common schools of the
country. The education of Alfred, so far as it has not originated with himself, was received
at Groton, Mass., where at the age of eleven he was placed under the tuition of Eliza Wright.
Mr. I-Iolbrook, though not gifted with much physical health, has a strong will and an ex-
traordinary inventive faculty. This latter, which might have won him fame and fortune in
the line of mechanical inventions and civil engineering, has been devoted to the work of
education. By his own unaided exertions, and by the magnetism of his character and his
labors, without either private contributions or State endowment, he has built up,‘at Leb-
anon, O., a large educational establishment, chieﬂy for the education and training of
teachers. In the prosecution of this work, he has prepared for the use of the pupils a series
of Lectures on the work of the school-room, which embodies his educational views, and
which is thus far his only separate publication.

VII. NOVELS AND TALES.

Hawthorne.

NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE, 1804-1864, stands by general consent at the
head of the novelists of the present period. His Scarlet Letter, House of
the Seven Gables, and Marble Faun place him beside the great masters,
not of the age only, but of all time.

Mr. Hawthorne was born at Salem, Mass., and graduated at Bowdoin in 1825, in the same
class with Longfellow, and in the class next after that of Franklin Pierce, afterwards Presi-
dent of the United States. After quitting college, Mr. Hawthorne lived for many years at
Salem. From 1838 to 1841, he was weigher and gauger in the Boston Custom—House. He
was next in the Brook Farm Association, at West Roxbury, with Ripley and others, where
a community of literati and philosophers attempted to carry out an ideal scheme of rural
independence by the labor of their hands. In 1843 he retired to Concord and settled in the
“Old Manse ” which is celebrated in his stories. From 1846 to 1850, he was surveyor of the
port of Salem, by appointment of President Polk, and from 1853 to 1857 Consul at Liverpool,
by appointment of President Pierce-. The friendship between Hawthorne and Pierce, begun
at college, was terminated only by the death of the former. With the exception of the seven
years spent in the discharge of his oﬁicial duties at Salem and Liverpool, Hawthorne’s life
was for the most part passed in quiet seclusion.

In 1837 he published his Twice-Told Tales, in part a collection of sketches that had for-
merly appeared in an annual called The Token; hence the name. In 1846 appeared Mosses
from an Old Manse, a similar collection, giving reminiscences of his residence at Concord.

In 1830 appeared the Scarlet Letter, containing reminiscences of the old Custom House
at Salem; in 1851, The House of the Seven Gables; and in 1852, The Blithedale Romance,
picturing his life at Brook Farm. These were followed by The Snow Image and several vol-
umes for the young: Grandfather’s Chair, True Stories, Tanglewood Tales, etc. In 1860
appeared The Marble Faun; soon after, a series of sketches of English life, called Our Old
Home. .‘

Hawthorne produced nothing in verse, yet he has been rightfully styled the greatest crea-
tive genius of America. Certainly no other writer has succee_ded_so completely in spiritual-
izing American life, in pervading it with the inner vitality of passion and reﬂection. His
characters are apparently real, and yet separated from the commonplace by an impassable
gulf. The reader feels himself transported into a new world, under the guidance of a som-
bre and powerful genius. His style, indeed, is morbid, at least in its general effects. It

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 475

produces the impression of a life utterly vain and hopeless, with a dark background of aveng-
ing fate. Yet as a master of style, Hawthorne is inimitable. No one ever wrote purer Eng-
lish, or used words more delicately and powerfully.

Hawthorne"'s greatest works are unquestionably The Scarlet Letter, The House of the
Seven Gables, and The Marble Faun. Each of these is full of passages, long and intense,
where the reader feels that every word is a thought or a picture. The characters are won-
derfully deﬁned by a succession of clear, delicate strokes, and move in an atmosphere of
brooding fancy. One who feels himself strong enough to overcome the spell exerted by
Hawthorne’s melancholy genius, can ﬁnd no better model for studies in style and expression.

In his personal life, Hawthorne seems to have been of a very shy, retiring disposition,
known only to a few intimate friends, and by them and by his own family loved as a
pure-hearted, genial, rather playful companion.

Since, Hawthorne’s death hisdiary has been published by his widow, under the title of
Passages from his American and English Note Books; it is full of choice bits of description
and shrewd observation. .

A complete edition of his works has been published, in 18 vols.

“ Another characteristic of this writer is the exceeding beauty of his style. It is clear as
running waters are. Indeed he uses words merely as stepping-stones, upon which, with a
free and youthful bound, his spirit crosses and re-crosses the bright and rushing stream of
thought. Some writers of the present have introduced a kind of Gothic architecture into
their style. All is fantastic, vast, and wondrous in the outward form, and within is myste-
rious twilight, and the swelling sound of an organ, and a voice chanting hymns in Latin,
which need a translation for many of the crowd. To this we do not object. Let the priest
chant in what language he will, so long as he understands his own mass-book. But if he
wishes the world to listen and be ediﬁed, he will do well to choose a language that is gen-
erally understood.” —- Henry W. Longfellow, in North American Review. I

A RILL FROM THE TOWN PUMP.
(SCENE-— the corner of two principal streets; the Town Pump talking through its nose.)

Noon,by the north clock! Noon by the east! High noon,too, by these hot sunbeams, which
fall, scarcely aslope, upon my head, and almost make the water bubble and smoke, in the
trough under my nose. Truly, we public characters have a tough time of it! And, among
all the town ofﬁcers, chosen at March meeting, where is he that sustains, for a single
year, the burthen of such manifold duties as are imposed, in perpetuity, upon the Town
Pump? The title of “town treasurer” is rightfully mine, as the guardian of the best treas-
ure that the town has. The overseers of the poor ought to make me their chairman, since I
provide bountifully for the pauper, without expense to him that pays taxes. I am at the head
of the ﬁre department, and one of the physiciansto the board of health. As a keeper of the
peace, all Water-drinkers will confess me equal to the constable. I perform some of the duties
of the town clerk, by promulgating public notices, when they are posted on my front. To
speak within bounds, I am the chief person of the municipality, and exhibit, moreover, an
admirable pattern to my brother ofﬁcers, by the cool, steady, upright, downright, and im-
partial discharge of my business, and the constancy with which I stand to my post-. Sum-
mer or winter, nobody seeks me in vain ; for, all day long, I am seen at the busiest corner,
just above the market, stretching out my arms, to rich and poor alike; and at night, I hold
a lantern over my head, both to show where I am, and keep people out of the gutters.

At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to the parched populace, for whose beneﬁt an
iron goblet is chained to my waist. Like a dramseller on the Mall, at muster-day, I cry
aloud to all and sundry, in my plainest ac.cents, and at the very tip-top of my voice. Here
it is, gentlemen! Here is the good old liquor! Walk up, walk up, gentlemen, walk up,‘

Walk up! Here is the superior stuff! Here is the unadulterated ale of father Adam-
better than Cognac, Hollands, Jamaica, strong beer, or wine of any price; here it is, by the
hogshead, or the single glass, and not a cent to pay! Walk up, gentlemen, walk up, and
help yourselves! A

I It were a pity, if all this outcry should draw no customers. Here they copie.’ A hot day, i

gentlemen! Quaff, and away again, so as to keep yourselves in a nice cool sweat. You, my
friend, will need another cup-full, to wash the dust out -of your throat, if it be as thick there
as it is on your cowhide shoes. I see that you have trudged half a score of miles to-day;
and, like a wise man, have passed by the taverns, and stopped at the running brooks and
Well-curbs. Otherwise, betwixt heat without and ﬁre within, you would have been burnt to
a cinder, or melted down to nothing at all, in the fashion of a jelly-ﬁsh. Drink, and make
room for that other fellow, who seeks my aid to quench the ﬁery fever of last night’s pota-
tions, which he drained from no cup of mine. Welcome, most rubicund sir! You and I
have been great strangers, hitherto; nor, to confess the truth, will my nose be anxious for
a closer intimacy, till the fumes of your breath be a little less potent. Mercy on you, man!
the water absolutely hisses down your red~hot gullet, and is converted quite to steam, in
the miniature tophet, which you mistake for a stomach. Fill again, and tell me, on the
word of an honest toper, did you ever, in cellar, tavern, or any kind of a dramshop, spend
the price of your children’s food, for a swig half so delicious? Now, for the ﬁrst time these
ten years, you know the ﬂavor of cold water. Good-by; and, whenever you are thirsty,
remember that I keep a constantisupply, at the old stand. Who next? Oh, my little
friend, you are let loose from school, and come hither to scrub your blooming face, and
drown the memory of certain taps of the ferule, and other schoolboy troubles, in a draught
from the Town Pump. Take it, pure as the current of your young life. Take it, and may

Theodore Winthrop.

THEODORE VVINTHROP, 1828-1861, a young man of brilliant promise, is
known chiefly by his posthumous novel of Cecil Dreeme.

Mr. Winthrop was a descendant from old Governor Winthrop on one side and from Jona-
than Edwards on the other, and numbered in his other ancestry seven Presidents of Yale Col-
lege. He was born at New Haven, and graduated at Yale, in the class of 1848. He travelled in
Europe in 18l9—50—51; resided two years in Panama, exploring extensively Southern and

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 477

Central America; joined the famous Seventh Regiment of New York on the breaking out
of the war, and was killed in the ﬁrst campaign, at the battle of Big Bethel. Though so
young a man, he had already published several articles which pointed him out as. a man oi
mark, and he left in manuscript several books which were published posthumously : Cecil
Dreeme; John Brent; Edwin Brothertoft; The Canoe and the Saddle, adventures among
the Northwestern rivers and forests; Life in the Open Air. Mr. Winthrop’s writings show
a freshness, a versatility, a.nd a vigor which make his early death a loss greatly to be deplored.
Had he lived, there can be little doubt that he would have become one of the great lights
of American letters.

Henry D. Thoreau.

HENRY D. THOREAU, 1817-1862, was a thorough humorist, in the old
English sense of a man who indulges in humors.

Thoreau was born in Concord, Mass., and was graduated at Harvard, in the class of 1837.
He taught school for a time, and afterwards practised land-surveying for several years. One
of his “ humors ” was to make long rambles. usually alone, through out-of—tl1e-way districts,
and give minute descriptions of what he saw, and his own thoughts upon it. Once, accom-
panied by his brother, he went down the Concord‘ River to its junction with the Merrimac,
then up the Merrimac to its source, then backward to his starting point, at the town of
Concord. This voyage, occupying a week, was performed in a boat which was built by the
brothers for the purpose, and which was rowed, pulled, dragged, or propelled by wind, ac-
cording to circumstances, the travellers resting at night under a tent which they carried
with them. The incidents of this journey, to the minutest particulars, were written down,
from hour to hour, mingled with reﬂections, and were published in a volu me called A Week

' on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers. Another fancy still more curious occupied him for a

period of two years and two months. Taking an axe and a few dollars, and the clothes
which were upon him, he went into the woods, on the edge of a pond, and unaided, except
at the raising, built himself a house, ﬁfteen feet long, ten feet wide, and eight feet high, the
whole costing $'38.l2%, and lived there by himself over two years, at a total net cost of
$‘2.5.‘2l%! Having abundance of leisure, he read Homer, watched the birds, bees, ants,
squirrels, and other “small deer,” and meditated, —narrating and describing from day
to day. This odd life was the origin of his next book, Walden, or Life in the Woods. His
other works all partake, more or less, of the character of these two: Excursions in Field
and_ Forest; The Maine Woods; Cape God; A Yankee in Canada; Walking; Autumnal
Tints; Wild Flowers, etc. With Thoreau’s wonderfully acute power of observation, and his
ﬁne taste and skill in word-painting, he might have made a ﬁrst-class naturalist. Ilis works
are to the last degree original and quaint.

Richard Henry Dana, Jr.

 

RICHARD HENRY DANA, JR., LL. D., 1815 , son of the poet and
essayist mentioned in the preceding chapter, though not following literature
as a profession, has attained no little eminence in that line. His Two Years
before the Mast, in particular, has had an uncommon popularity.

MI‘. Dana is a native of Cambridge, Mass., and a graduate of Harvard, of the class of 1837.
While in college he suffered from weakness of the eyes, which compelled him to stop study
for a time. He took the occasion to make a voyage of two years, which formed the basis
of his most popular work. Two Years before the Mast. His voyage took him to California,
then a wild, almost unknown region. His narrative gives a vivid description of his expe-
rience on ship and shore, and has been a sort of Robinson Crusoe, both in England and
America. While the book was in manuscript,Vhe sold the copyright to the publishers for
$250, and they held it for the full term of twenty-eight years. On its expiration. in 1868,
he renewed it for his own beneﬁt. A

478 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Mr. Dana made a trip to Cuba in 1859, and on his return published his book, To Cuba and
Back. In 1859-60, he made a voyage round the world, visiting California, Sandwich Islands,
China, Japan, Ceylon, British India, and Egypt, returning through Europe.

Mr. Dana resides in Boston. He is a lawyer, and has a large and lucrative practice. He
was United States Attorney for Massachusetts from 1861 to 1866.

Mr. Dan-a’s publications, in addition to those named, have been chieﬂy legal, though not
exclusively so. The following are the chief: Seaman’s Friend, a manual of sea usages and
law; Letters on the Somers Mutiny; Life of Major John B. Vinton; Poems and Lectures
of Washington Allston, edited with a biographical sketch; Eulogy. on Edward Everett;
Enemy Property and Enemy Territory, a tract published in 1863; Letters on Italian Unity,
and the Relative Rights of Italy and the Catholic Church, 1871.- His other publications
have been almost exclusively legal.

Donald G. Mitchell, — “_Ik Marvel.”
DONALI) GRANT MITCHELL, 1822 , better known as “Ik Marvel,”
has charmed his countrymen by the exquisite sketches of life contained in
the Reveries of a Bachelor and in Dream Life.

Mr. Mitchell is a native of Norwich, Conn. He graduated at Yale in 1811. Feeble health
obliged him to abandon professional life, and to give himself up to those rural employments
wl1icl1 have thrown so pleasant atint on many of his writings.

His earliest works were Fresh Gleanings from the Old Fields of Europe, and The Battle
Summer, or Paris in 1848.

The two works by which he is almost exclusively known, are The Reveries of a Bachelor,
and Dream Life. Rarely have any books better deserved their title. They are a collection
of sketches of life and character, painted in such a dream-like, delicate manner as to make
the reader lose for the time being the full consciousness of his ow11 reality. They might,
on that account, be placed among the dangerous books for the young. The thought and
sentiments in them are the very essence of purity and reﬁnement, but the fascination which
they exercise over a sympathetic imagination is almost too strong.

Mr. Mitchell’s style is exquisite in its perfect adaptation to the subject. It is simple,
melodious, with words that paint, and words that suggest. It has called forth a number of
imitators more or less successful, noone of whom, however, is comparable to the original.

Mr. Mitchell was at one time Consul at Venice, and meditated writing a history of that
republic. The plan, however, has not been carried out. Of late, he has devoted himself to
writing upon agricultural and semi-agricultural themes, and has contributed largely to the
several magazines. ‘ ~

Besides the works already named, he has published the following: Lorgnette; Fudge
Doings ; Seven Stories; Wet Days at Edgewood ; Rural Studies; Dr. Johns.

Richard B. Kimball.

RICHARD BURLEIGH KIMBALL, 1816 ————, has published a number of
works, of which the best known is St. Ledger, or The Threads of Life.

Mr. Kimball is a native of Lebanon, N‘. H., and a graduate of Dartmouth, of the class of
1834. After studying law for a time, he visited Europe and remained some months abroad;
returning, he commenced practice at Waterford, N. Y., but soon removed to New York city.
There, besides his professional pursuits, he gave much of his time to literature, writing
101‘ the Knickerbocker, Putnam, International, Continental, and Atlantic Monthly. He has
made twenty-eight voyages across the Atlantic.

His separate publications are the following: St. Ledger, or The Threads of Life ; Romance
of Student Life Abroad; Cuba and the Cubans; Letters from Cuba; Letters from England;

“ Kimball’s style is free and easy. He is always perspicuous, often energetic, and at times
beautiful. His naturalness and freedom from affectation charm the youthful reader, while
to the maturer student they display a degree of artistic skill. Graceful narration and
smooth expression, joined to a just appreciation of human character in its truest aspects,
will ﬁnd for him a multitude of admiring readers.”-—— The I)a7'tm0ul/1.

J. R. Gilrnor°e,—“ Edmund Kirke.”

JAMES R. GILMORE, 1823 ——, under the name of “Edmund Kirke,”
became widelyknown during the war by his novels descriptive of the con-
ﬂict, especially by his book, “Among the Pines,” the sale of which was
Very large.

Mr. Gilmore was born in Boston. He is of Scotch extraction, being lineally descended
from a sturdy Covenanter, Who, taken prisoner while ﬁghting for the Pretender at the
battle of Culloden, escaped from his captors, and ﬂed to this country, where he settled at
Wrenthani, Ma.ss., about twenty-ﬁve miles west of Boston. From the same ancestor have
sprung John A. Gilmer of Georgia, Robert Gilnior of Baltimore, Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore of
Ohio, and Joseph A. Gilmore, late Governor of New Hampshire.

Losing his father at a very early age, Mr. Gilmore was early thrown upon his own resources,
and leaving school at eleven, entered a counting-rooni to ﬁt himself for a commercial life.
A passion for books, which he had early imbibed, did not, however, forsake him. His school
studies were continued of evenings, under the supervision of a wise and accomplished
mother, and his leisure hours during the day always found him with a book in his hand. The
duties of the counting-room were not neglected, but his proﬁciency in study was so great
that, at ﬁfteen, he passed the preliminary examination for admission to Harvard University.
His design of entering college was, however, soon abandoned, from the necessity that now
pressed upon him of providing altogether for his own support and that of his invalid mother.

He early began to write verses, and about this time one of his effusions having attracted
the notice of the editor of the Saturday Evening Gazette (then the leading literary journal
of New England), he was invited to contribute to it regularly. This he did, with more or
less regularity, till the ﬁrm to whom he was apprenticed admitted him, at the age of nine-
teen, a partner in their business. A

The house was largely engaged in the Southern trade, and among Mr. Gilmore’s duties
Was an annual tour among the correspondents of the ﬁrm, who were planters, engaged in
the raising of cotton, turpentine, and grain in the South Atlantic States. Thus he acquired
that knowledge of the South and its people which is shown in his books.

At the age of twenty-ﬁve, Mr. Gilmore left Boston, and in connection with one of the
older members of the ﬁrm to which he was indentured when a boy, established in New York
the house of J. R. Gilmore & Co., which for many years did a leading business with North
and South Carolina. Georgia, and Florida. The ﬁrm was largely engaged in shipping, and

. at this time owned the brig Echo, which, on the breaking out of the war, being caught in’ a

Southern port. was seized upon by the Confederates and made to do service as the ﬁrst pri-
vateer that preyed upon Northern com mercc.

In the spring of 1857, Mr. Gilmore retired from mercantile business with a comfortable
competency, and devoted himself to the management of a large landed property, near New
"York, in New Jersey. He was thus engaged till 1861, when the fall of Fort Sumter took
place. He was on a ﬂying visit to _the South at the time, and actually domiciled in the
house of the Southern gentleman who ﬁgures as Colonel J in his book, “Among the
Pines.” I,I_e left at once for home, but stopped on his way at Washington, to see Robert J.
Walker.

480 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

In connection with Mr. Walker and Charles G. Lela.nd, Mr. Gilmore soon commenced in
Boston the publication of the “ Continental Monthly,” devoted to the doctrine of Emanci-
pation, as distinguished from Ab0ZL'[z‘o72.. For this he wrote the series of papers called
“Among the Pines,” which afterwards, collected into a book, had so wide a circulation.
This was quickly followed by “My Southern Friends,” and “Down in Tennessee,” books of
which, in the short space of one year, there were sold upwards of 100,000 copies. Besides
these, Mr. Gilmore wrote during the. war “On the Border,” a story descriptive of the cani-
paign in East Kentucky; and two books for boys, entitled, “Among the Guerrillas,” and
“Patriot Boys and Prison Pictures; ” together with numerous articles for the Atlantic,
Galaxy, Harper’s, and Lippincott’s magazines. In addition, Mr. Gilmore wrote very many
of the war songs and ballads which appeared in the “Continental.” Some of these, as “The
London Times on American Affairs,” and “ The New Yankee Doodle,” were widely copied.

Since the “gar Mr. Gilmore has published but one book, “The Life of Jesus, according to
his Original Eiographers,” a monotessaron, which blends into one narrative the four his-
tories found in the Gospels.

Of late years he is understood to have altogether laid aside his pen, to devote himself to
the repair of his fortunes, which had been seriously injured by losses occasioned by the war.
He is now residing in Newark, N. J.

THREE DAYS.

So much to do, so little done!

Ah! yesternight I saw the sun

Sink beamless down the vaulted gray,
The ghastly ghost of Yesterday.

So little done, so much to do!

Each morning breaks on conﬂicts new,
But eager, brave, I’ll join the fray,
And ﬁght the battle of To-day.

So much to do, so little done!

But when it’s o’er——the victory won,
Oh, then, my soul! this strife and sorrow
Will end in that great, glad To-morrow.

Henry Morford.

HENRY MORFORD, 1823 , acquired during the War considerable
notoriety by the publication of Shoulder-Straps, The Days of Shoddy, and
other novels, etc., etc., descriptive of the times.

Mr. Morford was born at New Monmouth, Monmouth County, N. J. He is son of Judge
William Morford, of that place. He engaged in mercantile pursuits in early life, though
he contributed to many publications from the age of seventeen. He first entered upon edi-
torial life in 1852, by establishing the New Jersey Standard at Middletown Point. now Mata-
wan. Ile removed to New York in 1856; and between that time and 1868 was connected
with the editorial management of several papers, among others, the New York Courier,
Dispatch, Leader, Atlas, Frank Leslie’s, etc. IIe made a tour in Europe in 1865, with the result
ofa book of travels, called “ Over Sea; ” another in 1867 (Paris Exhibition, etc.), producing
a second volume, “ Paris in ’67 ; ” a third tour in 1868; a fourth andﬁfth in 1870 and 1871;
and a sixth in the summer of 1871, —all the four latter in connection with the authorship
of “ Morford’s Short~Trip Guide to Europe,” now published every year. He is establishing,
for correspondent continental publication, at “ Short-Trip Guide to America,” with others of

the series to follow. He published a volume of Poems in 1859, under the title of “Rhymes
of Twenty Years,” and has another volume ready for the press, to be called “Rhymes of an
Editor.”

Mr. Morford has published the following novels: 1863, Shoulder-Straps; 1864, The Days
of Shoddy, and The Coward; 1866, Utterly Wrecked; 1871, Only a Commoner.

He published a volume of humorous sketches, Sprees and Splashes, 1862. He has written
several plays, with only moderate success; the best known of them being a tragedy, The
Merchant’s Honor, and an Irish drama, The Bells of Shandon.

Mr. l\I01‘fOl‘d was a clerk in the New York Common Pleas from 1861 to 1868.

VVILLIAM HENRY PECK, 1830 , is an exceedingly proliﬁc writer of novels and novelettes.
He was born in Augusta, Ga. He studied for ﬁve years in a boarding-school at New Ilaven,
then entered the Baptist College at Georgetown, Ky., and ﬁnally graduated at Cambridge,
in 1853. In 1856, he was elected Prof:-ssor of Belles Lettres in the University of Louisiana.
In 1860, he became President of the Masonic Female College, Greenville, Ga., which position
he resigned in 1863 for a professorship in Le Vert Female College, at Talbotton, in the
same State.

Prot'.1’eck has published the following: Antoinette de Bordelaire; The Brother‘s Ven-
geance; The Moctoroon, a burlesque on Bourcicault’s Octoroon; Virginia Glencaire; Luke
Hammond; The Renegade; The Conspirators of New Orleans; The Phantom; The Con-
federate Flag of the Ocean; The Maids and Matrons of Virginia; Bertha Seely; Beatrice;
Roderic Harrow; Charles Marion; Marina; The McDonalds, or the Ashes of Southern
Homes; besides “an immense number of minor tales.”

“ Prof. Peck writes with great ease, and great rapidity; and for the millions-—the blood-

 

and-thunder-loving millions —he gives us strong preparations of mingled dangers, dungeons,
and daggers; assassinations and assign-ations; lawsuits. suicides, and seductions; graves,
greed, ghosts, and guilt; skeletons, corpses, and capsules; gorgons, spectres, and chimeras
dire.” —J. Wood Davidson.

W. Gilmore Sirnms.
VVILLIAM GILMORE SIMMS, LL. 1)., 1806—1870, of Charleston, S. C., was

one of the most proliﬁc of American romancers. His novels are mostly

founded on local traditions, giving them an historical character and value,
and have been in good repute.

Mr. Simms was born in Charleston, S. C., and was a resident of that city most of his life.
He did not enjoy the advantage of a college education, but by private study ﬁtted himself for
the-bar, and was admitted in 1828.’ He did not practice, however, but engaged early in lit-
erary pursuits, and gave himself up to authorship almost exclusively for the last forty years
of his life.

His best and best-known poems are, Atlantis, Lays of the Palmetto, a_nd Areytos, or Songs
and Ballads of the South. -

His forte, however, lies in his descriptions of scenes and incidents of the American Revo-
lution. These he has embodied in a series of widely read novels and romances, of which
the. following are the chief: The Partisan; Mellichampe; Katharine Walton; The Scout;
The Black Riders of the Congare_e; The Foragers: Martin Faber; The Book of My Lady;
Carl Werner; Castle Dismal; the Wigwam and the Cabin; Count Julian; The Damsel of
Darien; Eutaw, etc.

The Yemassee is founded upon the writer’s personal knowledge of the Indian character.
The Lily and the Totem is a story of the Huguenots in Florida. Other of Mr. Si1nms’s works
are founded on local and border history, such as Guy Rivers, Border Beagles, the Golden
Christmas, etc. In "addition to these works of ﬁction, he has published A History of South

Carolina, a Geography of the State, and a Controversial pamphlet on South Carolina in the
Revolution, and also biographies of Captain Marion, John Smith, and Nathaniel Greene. Mr.
Simms contributed a number of articles to Appleton’s Encyclopaedia, and many to the
Southern Quarterly, Southern Literary Messenger, and other reviews.

CLIFFORD ANDERSON LANIER, 1844 ————, a native of Georgia, has published two novels,
Thorn-Fruit, and Two Hundred Bales. — SIDNEY LANIER, ———-, brother of the ‘preceding,
and principal of an academy at Prattville, Ala., published in 1867 a novel called Tiger-Lilies.
lie is author also of several occasional poems.

COL. JOHN SAUNDERS HOLT, 1826 ——-, is a native of Mobile, Ala., though sprung from a
well-known family of Bedford County, Va., and though he has lived most of his life, and
still lives, in Woodville, Miss. He was educated partly in New Orleans. and partly at Centre
College, Kentucky. He served in the Mexican war and in the late war. He is a lawyer by
profession. His authorship began since the war. He has written three works of fiction,
all intended to portray certain phases of Southern society, and all showing marked power.
These are: The Life of Abraham Page, Esq.; What I Know about Ben Eccles, by Abraham
Page; The Quines. Though purely ﬁctitious, these stories have so much the form of actual
biography, that the reader at ﬁrst takes them for simple history.

WiLL1AM W. TURNER, 1830 —-—, a native and resident of Eatonton, Ga., published in 1865

REV. F. R. GOULDING, 1810 ——-—, of Georgia, has written a good deal for the young. Mr.
Goulding graduated at the University of Georgia, Athens, 1830, and studied theology at
Columbia, S. 0. His voice failing, he occupied himself a portion of his time in writing juve-
nile books. He has published the following: Robert Harold, or The Young lvlart,-oners on
the Florida Coast; Little Josephine; Maroo1ier’s "Island; Frank Gordon, or When I was a
Little Boy ; Fishing and Fishes ; Life Scenes from the Gospel History. J

Charles Dimitry.

 

CHARLES DIMITRY, 1838 , has risen Within a few years to a high
position, as a novelist of much originality and power.

Mr. Dimitry is a native of Washington, D. C , son of Prof. Alexander Dimitry, formerly of.
New Orleans. Mr. Charles Dimitry is a graduate of Georgetown College. He has published
the following novels: Guilty or Not Guilty, 1864; Anp,ela’s Christmas, 1865; The Alderly
Tragedy, 1866; The House in Balfour Street, 1869. “These are all distinctly able, and all
clearly above the popular novels of the day. There is nothing commonplace, or ﬂimsy, or
feeble, about any of them. As a journalist, also, Mr. Dimitry has been quite successful. He
has been conneetedwith the editorial management of some prominent Southern periodicals,
and he is now among the fraternity in New York.” — J. Wood Dwvitlson.

John Esten Cooke.

JOHN ESTEN COOKE, 1830 ,has. done for the historical traditions
of Virginia what Simms did for those of the Carolinas, and Cooper for those
of the North and West. Some of Mr. Cooke’s historical novels, such as
The Virginia Comedians, and Henry St. John, are the best and truest pic-
tures anywhere to be found of Virginia in the olden time. He has shown
himself an able biographer also by his Lives of Stonewall Jackson and Lee,
and he contributed actively in other ways to the literature of the War.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME 483

Mr. Cooke was born at Winchester, Va., and spent the ﬁrst years of his life at Glengary,
his father’s estate in Frederick County, whence, on the burning of his house there, he re-
moved to Richmond, as the place of session of the higher courts of the Commonwealth.

Ilis father, Jolm R. Cooke, was a lawyer of the highest order of ability, a man of much
sweetness of disposition, elegance of manner, and greatly respected and beloved by his emi-
nent associates, among whom were Chief-Justice Marshall, Judge Tucker, Watkins Leigh,
Judge Stannard. His mother was Maria Pen-dleton, a grandniece ofJudge Edmund Pendleton.

He was educated at an ordinary Virginia school, and ﬁnished at sixteen, under Dr. Burke,
a very excellent teacher of languages, at Richmond. He studied law with his father, be-
ginning the practice at twenty or twenty—one, but discontinuing it three or four years after-
wards, for literary pursuits, writing for the Southern Literary Messenger and the New York
1naga'/.§nes until the war. During the war, he served in the Virginia campaigns, for the
most part on Gen. Stuart’s staff, from April 10, 1861, to April 10. 1865 —-four years to a day.

Since the war he has resided in Clarke County, Va. He was married in 1867 to Miss Page,
and has lived in the county, engaged in literary and other pursuits.

The following are his publications written before the war: Lcatherstocking and Silk;
The Virginia Comedians, 2 vols.; The Youth of Jefferson; The Last of the Foresters; Ellie,
or the Human Comedy; Ilenry St. John, Gentleman; Fairfax.

His war books are the following: Surry of Eagles Nest; Mohun; Hilt to Hilt; I-Iammer.

and Rapier; Wearing of the Gray; A Life of Gen. Lee; Stonewall Jackson, a Biography.

Besides these he has written a volume called Out of the Foam, and three or four other
stories of volume dimensions. with a considerable quantity of miscellaneoiis writing.

Mr. Cooke has a ﬁne imagination, he is exceedingly well read in the old Virginia tradi-
tions, and he knows how to carry his readers with him in the scenes that he creates.

Philip Pendleton Cooke.

PHILIP PENDLETON COOKE, 1816-1850, though known chieﬂy as a poet,
yet Wrote excellent prose. There are, n.(.reover, other reasons, connected
with his name and the family traditions, for not separating him from his
younger brother, J. Esten Cooke. The volume by which Philip Pendleton
Cooke is best known is The F roissart Ballads, containing among other
pieces the exquisite poem of Florence Vane.

31 r. Cooke was born in Berkeley Count Va., and raduated at Princeton, in the class of
. Y, 8

81834. He studied law, and practised for many years. His early life was spent at Glengary,

his father’s country residence, near Winchester. Glengary is a very beautiful country seat,
and the young poet had a little house in a secluded grove where he used to write poetry,
and amuse himself with an aeolian harp. He became, early, an indefatigable hunter, and
before he died became famcus as the greatest huntsman of the. Shenandoah Valley.

His ﬁrst poems, Florence Vane, To Edith, etc., were published in the Southern Literary
Messenger, edited then by Poe, whc had a very high opinion of Mr. Cooke’s productions.
Afterwards he wrote many prose pieces for the Messenger, tales, criticisms, sketches, and a
romance, the Chevalier Merlin, remaining unﬁnished at his death. He published in Phila-
delphia the Froissart Ballads, a return to chivalric poesy.

He was married early to Williann Tayloe Corbin Burwell, a daughter of a gentleman ct’
Clarke County, and through his wife came into possession of the estate of the Vineyard,
where he died in 1850, of pneumonia, caught in riding through the Shenandoah on a hunt-
ing expedition. He left one son, Lieut. N. B. Cooke, and several daughters.

The author of the present volume has a very vivid recollection of the character and the per-
sonal appearance of Mr. Cooke, when a student at Princeton, and bears witness to the truth-
fulness of the following portrait from the pen of the younger brother. Fraternal affection
has barely done justice to one of nature’s noblest gentlemen.

48l AMERICAN LITERATURE.

“ My brother, of whom you so kindly inquire, was a person of marked character, ‘proud.
resolute, but very sweet-tempered, andremarkable for his dignity and personal beauty. His
head was really noble, his eyes dark, his hair curling chestnut, and his person erect and
vigorous. He alternated between the reveries of the poet. and the headlong activity of the
huntsman. No one could be more beloved by his family and friends, and I look back to him
now as a man of real genius, who would have filled a large space in the age of tlie-literary

vworld if he had not died so soon. [His mind_wa_s just opening into full bloom, and had

scarcely shown its full strength. I never saw a son so absolutely devoted to his father and
mother. ‘Love in abundance to all,’ he wrote in one of his letters; ‘I am near them and
_\’()l1 in spirit, if I cannot be in person. Thank God, the affections need no travelling fund
to get to dear friends in distant p1aces—they ﬂy like doves.’ To his father he wrote: ‘ I am
indebted to ‘you for a nature as elastic as a young ash-tree, and it will straighten itself the
moment any load is shaken off.’ ‘

“Poetry and hunting were his passions. He was profoundly read in the English masters
from Chaucer to the present. He was a fair but not a deep scholar in the ancient and modern
languages, and I remember was one of the very ﬁrst persons in this country to recognize the
genius of Tennyson when i-t was laughed at, generally. '

"I can sum up my brother’s character by saying that he was an admirable type of a
sensitive", reﬁned, and highly cultivated gentleman -- manly and healthy in his character;
with a deep respect for religion, an elegant courtesy of bearing, great dignity, and very
warm and earnest affections. I-Iis youth was impulsive and heyday —— he would and did gallop
twenty miles to throw a bouquet into the window of his cousin ‘Florence Vane;’ but in
later life he was quiet, simple in his tastes, not easily aroused to any harsh emotion, and the
most tender of fathers, which his little piece To My Daughter Lily will show.”

FLORENCE VANE.

I loved thee long and dearly,
Florence Vane;

My life's bright dream, and early
Hath come again;

I renew in my fond vision,
My heart’s dear pain,

My hope, and thy derision,
Florence Vane.

The ruin lone and hoary,
The ruin old,

Where thou didst mark my story,
At even told,—-

That spot-—the hues Elysian
Of sky and plain———

I treasure in my vision,
Florence Vane.

Thou wast lovelier than the roses
In their prime;

Thy voice excelled the closes
Of sweetest rhyme;

Thy heart was as a river
Without a main.

Would I had loved thee never,
Florence Vane.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 485

But, fairest, coldest wonder!
Thy glorious clay

Lieth the green sod under——-
Alas the day!

And it boots not to remember
Thy disdain—-

To quicken love’s pale ember,
Florence Vane.

The lilies of the valley
By young graves weep,

The pansies love to dally
Where maidens sleep;

May their bloom in beauty vying
Never wane, ’

Where thine earthly part is lying,
Florence Vane!

R. M. Bird.
ROBERT MONTGOMERY BIRD, M. D., 1805-1854, is favorably known as a

Writer of romantic ﬁction, as Well as joint proprietor and editor of the ,

Philadelphia North American.

Dr. Bird was born in Newcastle, Del., but resided most of his life in Philadelphia. He
studied medicine and practised for one year. Literature, however, had greater attractions
for him. and he gave himself up to its pursuit. He wrote three tragedies, which were played
in 1831-3 with great success, The Gladiator, Oraloosa, and The Broker of Bogota. His chief
works were in the line of romantic ﬁction. The following novels appeared in rapid succes-
sion, between 1884 and 1839: Calavar, or The Knight of the. Conquest, a Romance of Mexico;
The Inﬁdel, or The Fall of Mexico; The Hawks of Hawk Hollow, a Tradition of Pennsyl-

vvania; Sheppard Lee: Nick of the Woods; The Adventures of Robin Day.

“The author (of the Romance of Mexico) has studied with great care the customs, man-
ners, and military usages of the natives, and has done for them what Mr. Cooper has done
for the wild tribes of the North, -— touched their rude features with the bright coloring of a.
poetic fancy. He has been equally fortunate in his delineations of the picturesque scenery
of the land; and if he has been less so in attempting to revive the antique dialogue of the
Spanish cavalier, we must not be surprised; nothing is more diﬁicult than the skilful execu-
tion of a modern antique.” — Prescott.

Besides his novels, Dr. Bird published a book called Peter ‘Pilgrim, or a Rambler’s Recol-
lections, a collection of tales and sketches, including a long account of the Mammoth Cave,
said to be one of the earliest that appeared. .

For the last six or seven years of his life, Dr. Bird was associated with Morton McMichael
as joint proprietor and editor of the North American newspaper of Philadelphia.

Charles J. Peterson.

CHARLES J. PETERsoN, 1818 , proprietor and editor of Peterson’s
Ladies’ Magazine, has written several popular novels, besides some histori-
cal and biographical works of value. '

Mr. Peterson was born and has always lived in Philadelphia. He was partly educated at
the University of Pennsylvania. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1839. 50011

afterwards, he became part proprietor of the Saturday Evening Post, and abandoned law for
literature. He was editor of Graham’s Magazine for some years, afterwards of Peterson’s
Magazine, which he still publishes. He has written the following works: The Military
Heroes of the United States, a work for popular reading, illustrated, in two large volumes,
octavo. He‘ is the author of various tales and romances originally published anonymously.
Cruising in the Last War; Harry Danforth; The Valley Farm; Kate Aylesford; The Old
Stone‘ Mansion; and numerous shorter ones. He was for many years engaged in writing
leading articles for The Evening Bulletin, and afterwards for the Public Ledger of Phila-
delphia.

Henry Peterson.

 

HENRY PETERSON, 1818 , editor of the Saturday Evening Post, is
the author of several entertaining volumes.

Mr. Peterson was born and educated in Philadelphia. He has-lived for the last twenty
years in Germantown. He has been connected with the Saturday Evening Post since 1846.
He has published the following volumes: The Twin Brothers; The Modern Job; Poems.

Herman Melville.

HERMAN MELVILLE, 1819 , is the author of several works of ﬁc-

V tion, describing wild adventures among the islands of the Paciﬁc.

Mr. Melville is a native. of New York. While very. young he displayed a great love for
adventure and went to sea before the mast. On one of his voyages in the Paciﬁc he deserted
the ship, and was taken prisoner and kept for several months in the ’l.‘ypee valley on one

of the Marquesas. He was rescued by a whaling vessel, and ﬁnally returned home in a

United States man-of—war. V

Melville is the author of several exciting works based upon his adventures. The follow-
ing are the principal: Typee, or Four Months in the Marquesas ; Onioo; Mardi, and _a
Voyage Thither; Redburn, orthe Confessions of a Gentleman’s Son in the Merchant Service;
White Jacket, or the World in a Man-of-War; The Piazzi Tales, a series of stories published
in Putnam’s Mega’/.ine; The Conﬁdence Man. His two bestworks are, perhaps, Typee and
Redburn. In the former, life among the savages is described in an almost idyllic style, too
idyllic, it has been observed, to be wholly accurate. At least one may be permitted to doubt
whether the savages of Typee were quite as interesting as Melville has represented them.
The work itself and its successors attracted great attention at the time of their appearance,
and although interest in them has since abated, they are still excellent in point of style.
Melville is a writer of forcible and graceful English, although in some of his works he lapses
into mysticism.

JEDEDIAH VINCENT HUNTINGTON, 1815 -—, is a native of the city of New York. He was
for some time a physician, then a minister in the Episcopal Church, and in 1849 became a
convert to the Catholic faith. He is a brother of Huntington, the well-known artist. lie-
sides contributing to the Knickerbocker and to Blackwood, he has edited several Catholic
periodicals — The Leader, St. Louis, and The Metropolitan Magazine. The following are his
principal volumes : Lady Alice, or the New Una ; Alban, or the History" of a Young Puritan;
The Forest, a Sequel to Alban ; The Pretty Plate; America Discovered, a Poem ; Poems, etc.

“ He [Huntington] is classical and Wordsworthian. He, too, is deeply religious, and his
poems have a sober hue; b11t they are so carefully chiselled as to defy critical censure. A
considerable portion of this volume is occupied with fragments and inscriptions from the
Greek. These are, in general, elegantly and faithfully done.” —London Atheneum.

C. Barnard.

 

CHARLES BARNARD, 1835 , has within the last few years risen sud-
denly to note by a series of musical novels, The Soprano, and The Tone
Masters, and by some equally striking books on gardening, of Which the
most noted is The Strawberry Garden.

Mr. Barnard was born in the rooms of the Warren Street Mission Chapel, Boston, where
his father, Rev. C. F. Barnard, was minister. Charles attended school as far as health per-
mitted, and assisted his father about the chapel, until the age of sixteen. Then he tried a
store, but found that store-keeping was not his vocation. Next he began studying for the
ministry, but ill-health put a stop to that. Then he turned ﬂorist, to save his life. At
twenty-one, ﬁnding himself very ignorant, he set to Work to make up by private studies
the deﬁciencies of his education.

Mr. Barnard’s ﬁrst book appeared in March, 1869, and its reception warranted the issue
of another immediately afterward. The Musical Festival of that year followed soon, and
from the stage of the Coliseum he wrote what is known as the “Jane Kingsford Letters.”
Upon these letters he made his newspaper reputation. Since that time the press has made
incessant demands upon his pen. His own account of his literary labors for the last three
years is as follows: A

“I have nearly lost the run of the short stories, letters, and articles I have written since
I began in 1869. They exceed two hundred in number, and are now being written and

printed as fast as time and the demands of business permit. I have writtenat times for-

the Boston Advertiser, Globe, Transcript, Times, Gazette, Register, Watchman and Reﬂector,
and the Yout~h’s Companion; in New York, for the Evening Post and Independent; in the
West, for the American Farm Journal ; also for Old and New, Oliver Optic’s Merry’s Museum
and the Schoolmate. Why the press is after me so sharply is something past ﬁnding out.
Perhaps it is because I have something to say, and say it. without any fuss. Having nothing
to say, I religiously neversay it.

“ My books were published in the following order: My Ten Rod Farm, or How I became a
Florist, by Mrs. Maria Gilman; Farming by Inches; The Soprano——a musical story by Jane
Kingsford; A Simple Flower Garden, or Every.Lady her own Gardener.

“ The foregoing were published under assumed names. After this I put my own name to
everything. I published in this way three volumes: The Tone Masters—Mozart and Men-
delssohn, Handel and Haydn, Bach and Beethoven, (these are the only books I ever men-
tion; I think them the only ones worth much,) and The Strawberry Garden.

“There is a serial of mine called Happiness in a Flower-Pot, now being published in a.
Toledo paper. I have two new story books in the hands of my publishers. In my desk is
a new musical novel nearly ﬁnished. ‘

“ I do not think I have been very indolent for the last three years, and there seems no
prospect of a let—up in the pressure. All I can say for myself is, that I have endeavored to
pick up facts of value, and tried to present them in anpeasy. natural way. I never make
any pretence to style, or ﬁne writing. I have neither. I merely talk. My aim is to so use
the gift suddenly plumped down in my lap that none may complain, and all perhaps be made
better. I go for the bright side of things, and have a solemn and enduring faith in fun. If
I have any particular forte, it is careful seeing and accurate recording. Beyond this I claim
iiothing.”

T. S. Arthur.
TIMOTHY SHAY ARTHUR, 1809 , is one of the most proliﬁc Writers
that our current literature presents. Nearly all his writings are novels and
tales.

Mr. Arthur was born in Newburgh, N. Y. He lived for several years in Baltimore, but
since 1841 has lived in Philadelphia, and is counted at Philadelphian.

He has made authorship his profession, and has been a most industrious, as well as pro-
liﬁc writer. Most of his works have appeared originally in serial form, either in Arthur’s
Magazine, of which he is the editor and proprietor, or in some similar publication. They
consist almost exclusively of tales, are of a popular character, representing American domes-
tic life, and many of them are intended particularly for the young. Some of his best-written
tales, as 'l‘en Nights in a Bar Room, and Six Nights with the VVashingtonians, are written in
advocacy of the cause of total abstinence. In some, also, as in Agnes or the Possessed, and
The Good Time Coming, he breaches ideas bordering upon spiritualism and upon other systems
of semi-religious belief, with which the Christian public is not in general accord. The moral
tone of Mr. Arthur’s writings is worthy of commendation. His imagination is a stranger to
everything that is impure or thatsavors of licentiousness, and he holds up continually to
the reader’s attention pictures of truth, purity, and uprightness in private life. If he never
rises to the higher regions of creative genius, he has yet great fertility of invention in thr-
lower walks of useful authorship, and he always contrives to make his stories readable and
interesting. The following is a list of his principal works: Sketches of Life and Character;
Lights and Shadows of Real Life; Leaves from the Book of Human Life; Golden Grains from
Life’s Harvest Field; 'l‘he Loftons and the Pinkertons; Heart Histories and Life Pictures;
Tales for Rich and Poor, 6 vols.; Library for the Household, 12 vols.; Arthur’s Juvenile

that we have, of story—bo0ks for boys. His name, “Oliver Optic,” is a key
to one main element of his popularity. He is one who has used his eyes.
He writes of'what he has_ seen. Another source of his popularity is his
warm sympathy with the young. One cannot read a page of his writings

himself really enjoys the boyish scenes which he creates. His long. expe-
rience as a teacher has probably helped him on this point. At all events,
he seems to have an instinctive knowledge of what will interest young
people, and especially boys. As a caterer to boyish tastes, and at the same
time an educator of those tastes to high standards of judging and acting,
Mr. Adams is Without an equal at the present time.

Mr. Adams was born in Medway, Mass. He was educated mainly in the public schools of
Boston. He taught school for three years at Dorchester. He then went into the hotel busi-
ness with his father and brother. He was appointed in 188 Usher in the Boylston School ;
in 1853, Sub-Master; and in 1859, Master. Soon after this he was transferred to the Master-
ship of the Bowditch School, in which position he remained until l86-5, when he resigned

FROM 1850 TO THE PRICSENT TIME. 491

He went to Europe for the purpose of making studies from life for a series of books de-
scriptive of the history, geography, manners and customs of the chief countries of Europe.

His public career as a writer began in 1850. He wrote stories for the newspapers, which
were immediately popular, and brought him under the notice of publishers. His amazing
fertility of invention in this department of periodical literature is seen in the fact that he
has published no less than eight hundred stories in newspapers, exclusive of his books-—-— of
which latter he has written over ﬁfty volumes! His fugitive stories would ﬁll about sixty
volumes as la.rge as his ordinary books! .

He published his ﬁrst book in 1853 —— Ilatchie, the Guardian Slave, or the Heir of Bell»
vue, which had a large sale for those times. His next volume was In-doors and Out, a rol~
lection of newspaper stories. The Riverdale Series, 6 ‘volumes, for boys of eight years of
age, was completed in 1862. He commonly wrote one of these volumes in a couple of even-
ings. Then came the Boat Club Series and the Woodville Series, which were published at
the same time, from 1863-66, at the rate of four volumes a year. During the war, he wrote
a series of six volumes, descriptive of naval and military life. This is known as the Army
and Navy Series.

In 1870 he went a second time to Europe, travelling in the countries not visited on the
former occasion, in order to prepare himself for the second series of The Young American
Abroad. ~

Mr. Adams resides at Dorchester. He has served for six years as a member of the School
Committee of that place, and in 1869 he was a member of the Legislature.

The following is a list of his publications: Boat Club Series, 6 vols.; Woodville Series. 6
vols; Army and Navy Series, 6 vols.; Riverdale Stories, 6 vols. ; Starry Flag Series, 6 vols. ;

VV.-\R.R.EN IVES BRADLEY, 1847-1868, a youngman of brilliant promise, died at the age of
twenty-one, at Bristol, Conn. He had for his age made great progress in litoratureand
science, and had already given to the public thirteen books, one of them Culm Rock, taking
a prize of $350 over seventy—two competitors. He wrote under the name of “Glance Gay-
lord.” His books were of the kind known as juvenile.

PETER CARTER, 182-5 -——, a member of the eminent publishing house of Robert Carter &
Brothers, of New York, has written three admirable Sunday-School books, Bertie Lee, Don~
ald Fraser, and Little Eilie’s Home, all of which are great favorites with the young folks.
Mr. Carter also compiled Scotia‘s Bards, an elegant volume containing choice selections from
the best poets of Scotland, with biographical sketches, and handsome pictorial illustrations.
The work is one showing a ﬁnely cultivated taste, and has been popular. Memorial of
Kate B. Freeman, and Crumbs from the Land of Cakes, are additional evidences of literary
industry on the part of the author. Mr. Carter was born "in Scotland, at Earlston, four
miles from Abbotsford, but came to the United States at the age of seven, and after spend.-
ing eight years on a farm, entered into the bookselling business.

gational ministry, and was ordained over the Orthodox Congregational Church in Ashland, _

Mass, in 1849. During his ministry he wrote some for the press. A bronchial diificiilty

REV. JACOB ABBOTT, 1803 , is a native of Hallowell, Me., and a graduate of Bowdoin,
1820. He is a voluminous and popular writer. His writings are mostly religious, and nearly
all of them for the young. Few writers have excelled him as a caterer for the wants of the

of his which have received the commendation of all parties are The Mother at Home, and
The Child at Home. The former of these especially has been translated into nearly every

Harriet Beecher Stowe.

MRS. HARRIET ELIZABETH BEECHER STOWE, 1812 , is, on the whole,
the ablest and most brilliant of the Beecher family, and clearly the ablest
and most successful living American novelist, since the death of Haw-
thorne. Her best known and most characteristic novels are Uncle Tom’s
Cabin, The Minister’s VVooing, Old Town Folks, and Agnes of Sorrento.
Her stories for children, like those in Queer Little People, are in some re-
spects better even than her novels. The House and Home Papers, and
The Chimney Corner, show her to be possessed of remarkable power as an
essayist. I .

Mrs. Stowe is the daughter of Dr. Lyman Beecher. She was born at Litchﬁeld, Conn.
From the age of ﬁfteen to the age of twenty, she assisted her sister, Catharine Beecher, in
the management of a school at Hartford. In 1832, she went with her father’s family to
Cincinnati. There, in 1836, she was Inarried to Prof. Calvin E. Stowe, of Lane Theological
Seminary. In 1850, Prof. Stowe and his family went to Bowdoin College, Brunswick, He,
and thence, in 1852, to Andover, Mass., where the family have resided ever since.

Mrs. Stowe began pretty early to write occasional pieces, but her ﬁrst volume appeared in
1843, and was called The Mayﬂower. It consisted of short Tales and Sketches. It was not
‘until 1852, when she was already forty years of age, that her ﬁrst really great work appeared.
What she had written before, however, though small in quantity, and on ordinary topics,

had made a profound impression, and had prepared the minds, ofsome at least, for the eXtraor- ‘

dinary developments which have followed. .

Uncle Tom’s Cabin was published in 1852. Its success was unprecedented in the annals
of literature. In less than nine months, the sale had exceeded a million of copies; the
author and the publishers had made fortunes out of it; more than thirty rival editions of it
had been published in London alone, besides numerous other editions in different parts of
Scotland and Ireland; it was translated into every living language that possessed a popular
literature; and Harriet Beecher Stowe, before comparatively unknown, even in her own
country, became as familiar a name, in every part of the civilized world, as Shakespeare or
Homer.

It is absurd to attribute such extraordinary success to the abolition character of the book.
This feature of the work, if it attracted some readers, repelled others. There must have been
some magnetism about it, besides its political bias, which caused it to be translated into

Arabic, Armenian, a.nd Wendish, and the languages of far-off China and Japan. The anti-
slavery sentiment of the book, obtruded by the author in her own person, is in truth its
great blemish as a work of art; and it is a proof of her extraordinary skill in other respects,
that she was able so completely to fascinate millions of readers t.o- whom her political
opinions were either a matter of entire indifference, or of positive offence.

The whole secret of the matter simply is, Mrs. Stowe is a woman of genius, and her book;
was a work of consummate skill. No living writer goes beyond her in ability as a mere
story—teller. She is equally wonderful in the delineation of character. Even those persons
who are introduced incidentally, in a single scene, stand out upon the canvas, clear and
distinct, like the charcoal sketches in the .contours of a great master. Of her dramatic
powers — generally considered the highest mark of genius-—-it is superﬂuous to speak, when
hundreds of theatres, metropolitan and provincial, were kept thronged, for months in suc-
cession, by the exhibition of her story, even in the crude form given to it by some bung-
ling playwright. Her mastery of pathos is apparently unbounded. The springs of emotion
are touched at will ; the heart throbs, the eye swims, without a moment’s notice, and appa-
rently without an effort on the part of the writer.

Blackwood, in an article of more than thirty pages, devoted to the examination of the
literary merits of Uncle 'I‘om’s Cabin, viewing it solely as a work 0: art, thus summed up
its opinion of the author: “ Mrs. Stowe is unquestionably a woman of genius; and that is a
word which we always use charily; regarding genius as a thing per se—different from
talent, in its highest development, altogether, and in kind. Quickness, shrewdness, energy,
intensity, may, and frequently do accompany, but do not constitute genius. Its divine
spark is the direct and special gift of God; we cannot completely analyze it, though we may

, detect its presence, and the nature cf many of its attributes, by its action ; and the skill of

high criticism is requisite in order to distinguish between the feats of genius and the oper-
ation of talent. Now, we imagine that no person of genius can read Uncle Tom’s Cabin,
and not feel in glowing contact with genius —generally gentle and tender, but capable of
rising, with its theme, into very high regions of dramatic power. This Mrs. Stowe has done
several times in the work before us —exhibiting a passion, an intensity, a subtle delicacy of

perception, a melting tenderness, which are as far out of the reach of mere talent, however

well ‘trained and experienced,‘as the prismatic colors are out of the reach of the horn blind.
But the genius of Mrs. Stowe is of that kind which instinctively addresses itself to the affec-
tions; and though most at home with the gentler, it can be yet fearlessly familiar with the
ﬁercest passions which can agitate and rend the human breast. With the one she can ex-
hibit an exquisite tenderness and sympathy ; watching the other, however, with stern but
calm scrutiny, and delineating both with a truth and simplicity, in the one case touching,
in the other really terrible.” _ I

In 1853, “ Uncle Tom,” being then in the acme of his renown, the author visited Europe.
She was received, of course, with distinguished attention, and on her return she published
reminiscences of travel, in 2 vols., called Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands. It had a large
sale. Parts of this work, devoted to the description of philanthropic and religious institu-
tions, are dull and prosaic. But in the parts descriptive of her visits to Melrose Abbey,
Stratford~upon-Avon, Warwick Castle, Abbotsford, and to other places of historical renown,
the imaginative genius of the author asserts itself, and her remarks, often profound as they
are brilliant, seem to gush forth in the simplest and most natural manner, as if from an
overflowing fountain.

Since 1853, Mrs. Stowe has devoted herself to authorship, and has sent forth a large
number of works, of varying degrees of merit; none without marks of genius, yet none equal
to Uncle Tom’s Cabin Dred, a Tale of the Dismal Swamp, a story of the same political bias
as the preceding, sold largely in virtue of the established fame of the author, but it was, in
artistic merit, as nearly a total failure as a woman of so much genius could well make.

Her other principal works have come up more nearly to her ﬁrst standard. They are:
The Minister’s Wooing; The Pearl of Orr‘s Island; Pink and White Tyranny; My Wife and
I; Agnes of Sorrento; and Old Town Folks.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 495

Besides these large works, Mrs. Stowe has published a considerable number of volumes
made up of tales and sketches which had appeared in the Atlantic Monthly and the Young
Folks. These pieces are on almost all sorts of domestic subjects, many of them intended espe-
cially for children, and are among the best things, without exception, tha_t she has writ-
ten. The following are the titles of some of these volumes; House and Home Papers ; Little
Foxes, or‘ the Insigniﬁcant Little Habits which Mar Domestic Happiness; The Chimney
Corner; Stories about our Dogs; Queer Little People; Daisy’s First Winter, etc.

In 1869,in consequence of the publication of the Countess Guiccoli’s Recollections of
Byron, and the attempt in various quarters not only to glorify the poet, but to disparage the
memory of Lady Byron, Mrs. Stowe undertook to vindicate the latter, in a book called The
True Story of Byron’s Life. It led to a ﬁerce and most intemperate discussion.

Mrs. Stowe has published also several volumes of Poems.

The Warners.

The sisters Susan and Anna Warner gained a Wide celebrity by the pub-
lication of a series of semi-religious novels, which had an extraordinary
sale. These best known are The Wide VVide World, and Queeehy, by
Susan; Dollars and Cents, and My Brother’s Keeper, by Anna; and Say and
Seal, the joint production of the two. They have also written, either jointly
or separately, a number of very attractive books for the young. Susan
wrote under the name of “-Elizabeth Wetherell,” and Anna under the name
of “Amy Lothrop.”

SUSAN WARNER, 1818 -———, ﬁrst came before the public with the Wide Wide World, in
1849. This was followed in 1852 by Queechy. The Hills of the Shatelnuck, her third novel,
_appeared in 1856, and was coldly received. Itiwas, in fact, greatly inferior to the ﬁrst two.

Her next and last novel worthy of special notice was The Old Helmet, which appeared in
1863, and which came up nearly if not quite to the original standard. Other books by Susan
are Melbourne House; Daisy ;'_Walks from Eden; House of Israel; What She Could; Oppor-
tunities; House in Town.

ANNA B. WARNER, —— , the younger sister, has written Dollars and Cents; My
Brother’s Keeper; Mr. Rutherford’s Children; Casper; Pond Lily Stories; Hard Maple;
Sunday all the Week; Children of Blackberry Hollow, 6 vols.; Stories of Vinegar Hill, 6
vols.; Star out of Jacob; Melody of the 23d Psalm; Wayfaring Hymns; Three Little
Spades; Little Jack’s Four Lessons; Hymns of the Church Militant, a compilation; The
Other Shore; Gardening by Myself.

The works written by the sisters jointly are Say and Seal, a novel ; Christmas Stocking ;
Books of Blessing, 8 vols. ; The Law and the Testimony, a large work con taining all the verses
of Scripture arranged under different heads and subheads, intended to help the reader in
-ﬁnding texts suited to any particular subject in emergency. _ i

The Misses Warner were both born in New York city, daughters of Henry VV. Warner, of
the New York bar. They live in a romantic island in the Hudson, near West Point.

Mrs. Ann S. Stephens.

 

MRS. ANN Serum (WINTERBOTHAM) STEP}IENS, 1813 , has been in
great demand as a writer of novels and tales for magazines. Her produc-
tions are very numerous, ﬁlling 14 vols. 121110.

496   AMERICAN I.i'rEnATURE.

Mrs. Stephens was born at Derby, Conn. She was married in 1832, and removed to Port-
land, Me. There she came under the notice of John Neal, who early appreciated her abili-
ties. She projected and for some time conducted the Portland Magazine. Subsequently the
family removed to New York. There she gained a prize of $4.00 for a magazine story,
called Mary_Derwent. This gave her eclat, and thenceforward her productions have been
i11 demand. She has written two books on Needlework, and a considerable amount of verse.
The following are her principal novels: Fashion and Famine; The Heiress of Clare Hall;
The OldHomestead; The Heiress; Myra, the Child of Adoption; The Rejected Wife; The
Wiftfs Secret; Mahaska, the Indian Princess; Silent Struggles; Ruby Gr1'ay’s Strategy;
Mabel’s Mistake; The Curse of Gold; Wives and Widows.

Mrs. Southworth.

MRS. EMMA D. E. (NEVITTE) SOUTHWORTH, 1818 , has written a
large number of novels, of the sensational school. Her ﬁrst, Retribution,
appeared in 1849, and since that time she has devoted herself with unﬂag-
ging energy to the work of production.

Mrs. Southworth was born in Washington, D. C., a daughter of Captain Charles Nevitte
of Alexandria, -Va. Like many other authors whose writings have taken a strong hold upon
the public mind, she received in early life the baptism of sorrow. Her childhood, girlhood,
and early womanhood, as described by herself, were little else than one continued scene of
gloom, rivalling in intensity that which hung over the life of Charlotte Bronte.

She became Mrs. Southworth in 1841, and in 1843 was thrown upon her own resources,
“a widow in fact but not in name,” to support herself and her little one. She became a
teacher in the public schools, and a writer for the periodicals, and worked for both at starva-
tion prices.

Her iﬁrst productions were merely short tales and sketches. At length, in 1849, she under-
took a story intended to run through two or three numbers of the National Era, for Wl1icl1-
she was then writing. As the composition of this tale, Retribution, was the turning-point
in her life, the history ofits composition is given in her own words:

“The circumstances under which this, my first novel, was written, and the success that
afterwards attended its publication, are a remarkable instance of ‘ sowing in tears, and reap-
ing in joy ; ’ for, in addition to that bitterest sorrow with which I may not make you
acquainted —that great life-sor_row——I had many minor troubles. My small salary was in-
adequate to our comfortable support. My school numbered eighty pupils, boys and girls,
and I had the whole charge of them myself. Added to this, my little boy fell dangerously
ill and was conﬁned to his bed in perfect helplessness until June. He would suffer no one
to move him but myself— in fact no one else could do so without putting him in pain. Thus
my time was passed between housekeeping, and school-keeping, my child’s sick-bed, and my
literary labors. The time devoted to writing was the hours that should have been given to
sleep or fresh air. It was too much for me. It was too much for any human being. My
health broke down. I was attacked with frequent hemorrhage of the lungs. Still I per-
severed; I did my best t'or my house, my school, my sick child, and my publisher. Yet
neither child, nor school, 1101' publisher received justice. The child suffered and complained
— the patrons of the school grew dissatisﬁed, annoying and sometimes insulting me — and
as for the publisher, he would reject whole pages of that manuscript which was written
amid grief, and pain, and toil that he knew nothing of. It was indeed the very melée of the
‘ Eattle of Life.’ I was forced to keep 11p struggling when I only wished for death andgfor
rest.

“But look how it terminated. That night of storm and darkness came to an end, and
morning broke on me at last —-— a bright glad morning, pioneering a new and happy day of

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 497

life. First of all, it was in this very tempest of trouble that my ‘ life-sorrow ’ was, as it were,

carried away —or I was carried away from brooding over it. Next, my child, contrary to

my own opinion and the doctor’s, got well. Then my book, written in so much pain, p11b-
lished besides in a newspaper, and, withal, being the ﬁrst work of an obscure and penniless
author, was, contrary to all probabilities, accepted by the first publishing house in America,
was published and (subsequently) noticed with high favor even by the cautious English re-
viewers. Friends crowded around me —— offers for contributions poured in upon me. And
I, who six months before had been poor, ill, forsaken, slandered, killed by sorrow, privation,
toil. friendless, found myself born as it were into a new life; found independence, sym-
pathy, friendship, and honor, and an occupation in which I could delight. All this came
very suddenly, as after a terrible storm, a sun burst.”

Mrs. Southworth’s novels are not of the highest class, but they have been popular, and
they have been poured forth from her teeming brain with extraordinary rapidity. The fol-
lowing is the list, as taken from a late uniform edition of her works: The Family Doom, The
Prince of Darkness, The Bride’s Fate, The Changed Brides, How He Won Iler, Fallen Pride,
The Widow’s Son, Bride of Llewellyn, The Fortune Seeker, Allworth Abbey, The Bridal Eve,
The Fatal Marriage, Love’s Labor Won, The Deserted Wife, The Lost Heiress, The Grypsy’s
Prophecy, The Discarded Daughter, The Three Beauties, Vivia or the Secret of Power, The
Two Sisters, The Missing Bride, The Wife’s Victory, The Mother-in-law, The Haunted Home-
stead, The Lady of the Isle, Retribution, The Pearl of Pearl River, The Curse of Clifton.

Mrs. Anna Cora Movvatt Ritchie.

MRS. ANNA CORA Mowmrr RITCHIE, 1820-1870, achieved her chief dis-
tinction as an actress. She Won laurels also as a writer. She Was the
author of Various novels, plays, poems, and sketches, but is best known in
letters by the Autobiography of an Actress.

Mrs. Ritchie was born in Bordeaux, France, where her father, Samuel B. Ogden of New
York, then resided. The ﬁrst six years of her life were spent in a scene of fairy-like beauty,
at a charming chateau in the neighborhood of Bordeaux.

In 1826, the family returned to New York,and her career as a school-girl began. She dis-
tinguished herself by such rapid progress in her studies, that Mr. Mowatt, a laywer who
visited her father’s house, became interested in her, and persuaded her, when only fifteen
years old, to marry him, that he mi-ght enjoy the pleasure of superintending her studies.

The year following she published her ﬁrst work, Don Pelayo, a poem in 5 cantos, remark-
able as the work of a school-girl of sixteen, but not otherwise claiming attention.

In a few years, misfortunes overtook Mr. Mowatt. He lost not only his fortune, but his
sight; and the child-wife whom he had married to educate became now the support of her
blind husband. She first appeared as a Reader, and succeeded so well that she next went
upon the stage in the character of Pauline in the “ Lady of Lyons.” Her careeras an act-
ress was a continued and brilliant success. She gained thereby not only ample support for
herself and her blind husband. but lent to his life a ceaseless interest, as he accompanied
her from place to place in all her varied engagements.

While she was playing i11 England, Mr. Mowatt died. She returned thereupon to America,
after a continued European success of ten years, and renewed her appearance before Ameri-
can audiences, until 1854, when she was married to Mr. Ritchie, then editing the Richmond
Enquirer, and retired from the stage in the acme of her fame.

In 1860 she was called to New York to attend her dying father, and for weeks she devoted
her whole time to nursing him. His death left her in such a prostrate condition that she
went to Europe to regain her health, ﬁrst with a sister living in Paris, then with another
sister in Rome, after that in Florence.

Pecuniary disasters growing out of the war again overtaking her, she resorted to her pen
as a means of support, not only for herself but for others. She wrote several novels, Fairy
Fingers, The Mute Singer, The Twin Roses, The C1ergyman’s Wife, and contributed largely
to the newspapers and magazines. _

In 1860, she left Florence to live in London, and for the last three years of her life she
lived in the classic village of Twickenham, on the Thames, where she died in July, 1:70,
surrounded by a group of chosen and loving friends.

Besides the works already named, Mrs. Ritchie wrote two plays, Fashion, and Arnaud,
which held their place for ﬁfteen years on the London stage; The Fortune—I-Iunter, a novel ;
Evelyn, or the Heart Unmasked, a tale of dramatic life; Mimic Life, or Before and Behind
the Curtain; and The Autobiography of a11 Actress.

Mrs. Sara J. Lippincott,—“Grace Greenwood.”

 

MRS. SARA J ANE (CLARKE) LIPPINCOTT, 1823 , gained much
eclat, under the name of “Grace Greenwood,” as a writer of tales and
sketches for the magazines. She has published several volumes. Her
latest efforts have been directed mainly to writing for the young, and she
edits a juvenile magazine called The Little Pilgrim.

Mrs. Lippincott was born in Pomfrey, Onondago County,  Y. Her early girlhood was
spent in Rochester. At the age of nineteen, she removed to New Brighton, Pa., which was
her home for several years. In 1858, she was married to Mr. Leander K. Lippincott, of Phila-
delphia, and she made that city her home for many years. Of late she has lived chieﬂy in
Washington City.

Iler principal publications are the following: Greenwood Leaves, two series, a collection
of magazine articles; Ilaps and Mishaps ofa Tour in Europe; History of My Pets; Recol-
lections of My Childhood; Merrie England; Stories and Legends of Travel and History, for

Hrs. Prescott was born in Calais, Me., daughter of Joseph W. Prescott. She removed to
Newburyport, Mass., where she was educated, and where she was married to Mr. Richard S.
Spofford, a lawyer doing business in Boston. She began writing early; has contributed to
most of the periodicals; and has published the following works, all of which have been
popular: The Amber Gods; New England Legends; A Thief in the Night; Sir Rohan’s
Ghost; Azarian.

Mrs. Louise Chandler ~Moulton.

MRS. ELLEN LoUIsE CHANDLER MOULTON, 1835 , is a lively, spark-
ling writer, who has acquired considerable celebrity as a writer of tales and
sketches.

Mrs. Moulton was born at Pomfret, Conn., and educated at Mrs. Wil1ard’s Seminary, Troy.

She began contributing to the magazines and other periodicals when only ﬁfteen years old.
Her first volume, published when she, was only eighteen, was called This, That, and the

Other, and consisted, as the name indicates, of miscellaneous essays and sketches. It was
very successful, over 10,000 copies being sold. Her next volume was Jane Clifford, a con-
tinuous novel, published anonymously. Her Third Book was, like the ﬁrst, a collection of
short pieces, and met with excellent success. She has contributed largely to Harper’s
Monthly and Weekly,.to the Galaxy, the Atlantic, the Young Folks, and latterly has become
the regular Boston correspondent of the New York Tribune. She has also written some
sweet poems, which have gone the rounds of the papers extensively. -She left her country
home to become the wife of one of her Boston publishers ; and her authorship, both before
and after this event, has been the fruit solely of love for the work, her circumstances hav-
ing always been those of entire worldly ease and comfort. She is a quick observer, seeing
at a glance whatever she does see, and she writes in a lively, dashing manner, yet often with
singular felicity and daintiness of expression. Her later pieces are a great improvement
upon her ﬁrst, in the important matter of ﬁnish, showing that she is a careful worker. Mrs.
Moulton is described as a woman of great personal attractions. “ Her manner is very lively
and animated, her conversation sparkling and full of vivacity. She ‘almost always smiles
when she speaks; and when she laughs, a whole ocean of mirth and merriment breaks loose
and seems to ripple all around you.”

Miss Alcott.

MISS LOUISA MAY ALCOTT, 1832 , rose suddenly to fame, in 1867,
by the publication of a novel called Little Women. This was followed in
rapid succession by The Old Fashioned Girl, Little Men, and other stories
conceived in the same vein, and all equally popular.

Miss Alcott was born in Germantown, Pa., but has resided chieﬂy in Massachusetts, being
daughter of Mr.” Bronson Alcott, of Concord, a New England transcendent-alist. She was
educated at home, by her father. She was for ten years a teacher. She began to write for
the papers at the age of sixteen, and kept up pretty regularly, but with no marked success
for the first ﬁfteen years. At twenty-nine she managed to support herself by needle and
pen. At thirty-nine, she supported herself and family by the pen alone.

Her ﬁrst work that attracted particular attention was Hospital Sketches, published in
1863. She was one of the army of volunteer nurses who had gone to Washington to labor in
the military hospitals. While so laboring, she Wrote back home to her mother and sisters
letters containing sketches of hospital life and experience. These letters on her return
were revised and published in a book, and attracted much attention.

In 1865 she published her first novel, Moods. The next year she travelled in Europe, en-
deavoring to recuperate her health, which had been seriously impaired by her hospital
work. On coming back to America in 1867, she Wrote the novel, Little Women, which at
once made her famous.

One who is well acquainted with her, writes as follows :'

“Few Women more intensely American than Miss Alcott can be found among the thou-
sands of our countrywomen abroad. The daughter of a New England transcendentalist,
Mr. Bronson Alcott, of Concord, and descended, on her mother’s side, from the Mays, Sew-
ails, and Quincys, of Boston, she is, by birth and training, a Protestant of Protestants, an
enthusiast for freedom, nature, and the ideal life. Her humor. her tastes, her aspirations,
her piety, are all American, as well as her style and her opinions, which her books suffi-
ciently exhibit. It is this which makes their charm; for though she writes admirably, it is
rather for what she says than for her manner of saying it that the world reads her novels.
Little Women is a natural picture of life in Eastern Massachusetts, in Which her own family
and friends appear undera slight disguise. In An Old‘-Fashioned Girl, the same method is
pursued; the characters are drawn from life, and are full of the buoyant, free, hopeful New

England spirit——beyond constraint and above vulgarity — which makes them so fascinat-
ing. They have been received with enthusiasm by the young people of the country, and are
read with toleration, if not with positive delight, in England. The time will come, We
fancy, when her books will be as popular abroad as they are now at home.” .
The sale of these books, up to September, 1871, was as follows; Little Women, 87,000; Old-
Fashioned Girl, 47,000; Little Men, 48,000. It has doubtless largely increased since.

Olive Logan.

OLIVE LOGAN, 1841 , was until recently an actress. In 1868, at the
suggestion originally of “Artemus Ward,” she undertook that species of
public entertainment known as “lecturing.” Succeeding in it, she left the
stage, and since that time has devoted herself to that and other kinds of
literature. A

I-Ier “ Lectures,” so called, have been: Stage-Struck; Paris, the City of Luxury; The Bright
Side; Girls; The Passions; and Nice Young Men. Her income as a lecturer is reputed at
$15,000 a year.

The following is a list of her books: Chateau Frissac; Photographs of Paris Life; John
Morris’s Money; Somebody’s Stocking; The Good Mr. Bagglethorpe; Women and Theatres;
Before the Footlights and Behind the Scenes; The Mimic World; Get Thee Behind Me,
Satan.

She has written the following Plays : Armadale, a dramatization of Wilkie Collins‘s Novel;
The Felon’s Daughter, a drama; Pluck, a comedy; Surf, or Life at Long Branch, a comedy ;
West Point, a comedy. ’

Miss Logan was born in Elmira, N. Y. She is a daughter of Cornelius A. Logan, of Balti-
more, and a sister of the actress, Eliza Logan. Her father was an actor, and at the
same time a poet and scholar. Olive also was bred to the stage, and in her childhood was
often borne upon the mimic scene in the arms of a Forrest or a Booth, as the child of Cora
in Pizarro. At the early age of sixteen, however, Olive was withdrawn from the stage and
sent to Europe to be educated, in Paris and London. She resided abroad seven years, en-
riching her mind, not only by study and observation, but by contact with many of the most
brilliant intellects.

Returning to this country in 1862, Miss Logan resumed her profession for a short time,
and after playing a star engagement at Wallack’s Theatre, in New York, made a tour of the
West, performing only in classic plays. or comedies from her own pen. '

In 1868, as already stated, she left the stage, and since that time has occupied herself with
writing and lecturing.

In 1857, she was married to Mr. Edmund A. Delile, but was divorced in 1865. In 1871, she
was again married to Mr. Wirt Sikes, of New York, but she isknown by her married name
in private only. In public, and as a nom de plume, she retains her maiden name.

Anna Dickinson:

 

ANNA ELIZABETH DICKINSON, 1842 ,is chieﬂy known as a lec~
turer. She has published one book, What Answer, which was well received.

Miss Dickinson was born in Philadelphia. She was educated at Friends’ schools. In
her earlydays she had to contend with poverty. But she had indomitable courage, and
she fought her way through in the face of all obstacles. She had from childhood a special
admiration for oratory, which inﬂuenced and gave direction to her reading and studies.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 50}

Her association with the Friends, among Whom it is customary for women to speak in public,
early raised in her the ambition to excel in oratory. Her ﬁrst attempt at public speaking
was at a meeting of “Progressive Friends,” in January, 1860, when she was barely turned
of seventeen. Her ﬁrst prepared speech was in April of the same year, on Woman’s Work.
She next taught a district school in Bucks County, Pa., at a salary of $25 a month. In 1861,
she had a place in the United States Mint, in Philadelphia. During the war she was in
great demand as a public speaker, and developed brilliant oratorical abilities. She has since
that time made lecturing a profession, her chief topics being woman’s work and her right
to suffrage.

Mrs. E. Oakes Smith.

Mas. ELIZABETH OAKES SMITH, 1806 , is the author of numerous
tales and novels which have given her a deserved celebrity. She has been
conspicuous as a writer for nearly thirty years. During the latter part of
this period she was also engaged to some extent as a public lecturer.

Mrs. Smith was born in Cumberland, then called North Yarmouth, Me., about twelve
miles from the city of Portland, Aug. 12, 1806. Her maiden name was Elizabeth Oakes
Prince. Her parents moved when she was about a year old to the city of Portland, where
she resided till her removal to New York in 1839.

She was descended from Huguenot and Pilgrim ancestors; her mother being a Blanchard,
and her father a Prince; the first governor of the Plymouth Colony being her ancestor, as
was one of the early presidents of Harvard College, Urian Oakes, whence her name of Cakes.
She is from a well-to-do and distinguished ancestry. Prince’s Point in Yarmouth, Me., was
a part of the estate purchased by the Princes in 1680, which place still retains its name, and
the family still live upon land then purchased.

Her mother appears to have been no ordinary woman. She is described as being of great
ﬁrmness and dignity of character, and as having a most remarkable memory. It is said
that she could repeat nearly the whole of the New Testament, all the Psalms, the book of
Job, and the Prophets. ‘Her conversation was rnuch sought after.

Miss Prince was married, in 1823, to Seba Smith, the well—known humorist described else-
where in this volume. They continued to live in Portland until 1839, where pecuniary dis-
aster obliged a change. ‘

Mr. Smith had become involved in the land speculations of his native State, which
ended in the total loss of his property. Mrs. Smith’s courage rose with the emergency.
She spent not an hour in vain regrets or useless repining. Her husband being greatly dis-
heartened, she hent herself resolutely to aid as best she might in the support of the family.

Hitherto she had written anonyn1ously,‘and without any decided plan. She had edited
papers with Mr. Smith; had written tales and poems, toasts and speeches for youth on
Fourths of July, reports for committees, etc.; and enjoyed an acknowledged local reputa-
tion. Indeed, few women have been more petted and admired by their townspeople than
she was; now she abandoned all this‘for the solid, diligent literary toil by which bread was
to be earned. A

At ﬁrst she strongly interceded with her husband to go into the woods, where he had
begun improvements, ﬁfty miles from the settlements, and there build a log hut, and
till the soil, educate the children. and thus secure them a patrimony. Mr. Smith was
totally averse to this plan, and the family removed to New York. Here they met a kind
reception, and both husband and wife found ample employment for the pen.

One of her ﬁrst works was entitled Riches without Wings, a simple story, which is still a
favorite in Sabbath-Schools.

She often wrote columns for newspapers, by request, without name, and contributed

regularly to Godey’s, Snow<len's, and Graham’s Magazines, also, for Annuals, Keepsakes, etc.,
innumerable. These contributions have never been collected, but would fill several volumes.

The Lost Angel is a weird story in which the peculiar mental traits of the author are
strongly exhibited. The Sinless Child and Other Poems, gave her reputation as a poet.
The Western Captive, Bertha and Lily, The Newsboy, all l1ad large sales, and much popu-
larity. To the last work the newsboys of New York owe the establishment of rooms for

their accommodation, and many charitable acts for their relief, as before the appearance of

her work they had been a totally neglected‘ class, and public attention was drawn to them
by the truthfulness and pathos of her delineations of them. —
After these followed The Bald Eagle, The Sagamere of Saco, founded upon historic facts;

Woman and her Needs; Beauty and Dress; Shadow Land; and several small volumes for ,

children. . .
In 1870 she published a serial in the Herald of Health, entitled The Two Wives, and in 1871,
another, entitled Kitty Howard’s Journal.
Mrs. Smith’s works have never been collected. Her Poems are numerous: The Sinless
hild, Roman Tribute, Jacob Leisler, Destiny, three Tragedies, Sonnets, Hymns, and other
Lyrics.

Caroline Chesebro.

CAROLINE CHESEBRO, —— 1873, is the a.uthor of several Well-Written

works of ﬁction, of which the latest and most powerful is The Foe inthe

Household.

Miss Chesebro was a native of Canandaigua, N. Y., where she lived until 1865, when she was
invited to a position in the Packer Institute, Brooklyn. She had the charge of Composition
in the higher departments of the institute, but lived with her brothers and sister at Pier-
mont on the Hudson. I I

Miss Chesebro has been now twenty years before the public as an author, and has been
rising steadily in favor. Her works show care and elaboration, and the improvement per-
ceptible in the later volumes is at once evidence and fruit of honest, painstaking work-
manship.‘ Besides occasional contributions, both in prose and verse, to the magazines and
other periodicals, she has issued the following volumes : Dream of Land by Day Light: Peter
Carradine: Isa, a Pilgrimage; The Children of Light; Getting Along; Victoria; and The
Foe in the Household. The work last named appeared originally as a serial in the Atlantic
Monthly.

“ The essential quality of Miss 'Chesebro’s mind is intuition, rather than imagination ; of
fancy, she makes little use; her style is that of lucid narration, with the transparency of

crystal, and no aim at rhetorical effect; and hence her ﬁctitious writingsh-ave the air of a.

rehearsal of facts, rather than of artistic invention. But her insight into the depths of
human emotion is the faculty from which her productions derive their tone. As a general
rule, she has no sympathy with the darker passions of our nature ; no delight in the delinea-
tion of scenes of‘repulsive wickedness; but she selects her materials from the common
heart of every-day humanity. . . . . Hence the singular reality of all her characters, none
of whom is without a distinct purpose, or fails in the exhibition of consistency and unity,
which, in her writings, produce a more powerful impression than any desire of artificial dra-
matic skill. The record of their experience, which is less startling than natural, reads more
like personal biography than a creation of art, and we become interested in their fortunes as
in the adventures of people whom we have known.” -- Mr. Ripley, in the New York Tvribmze.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 503

Mrs. Mary J. Holmes.

Mas. MARY J. HOLMES, , is the author of a large number of
tales and novels, which have been very popular.
Mrs. Holmes’s maiden name was Hawes. She is a niece of the late Dr. Joel Hawes, of

Hartford, Conn. She was born at Brookﬁeld, Worcester County, Mass., where she spent the
ﬁrst ﬁfteen years of her life.- She received most of her school education there and in Wil-

l braham. She was fond of books, and read whatever came in her way, from Baxter’s Saint’s

Rest to Goethe‘s Sorrows of Werther. She developed very early a taste for ﬁction. When
quite a young girl, she used always to have in her mind some story which she thought out
at night after going to bed, and during the day she lived in a kindof ideal world and talked
with unseen people, whom she knew by name and whose society she preferred to that of her
young companions. She was sent to school "at three years of age; studied English grammar
and arithmetic at six; taught a district school at thirteen; and published her ﬁrst article
at ﬁfteen.

Whenjust ﬁfteen, she left home and came to Richmond, near Canandaigua, western New
York, where she taught for some time, and where she was married to Mr. Daniel Holmes, a
graduate of Yale, and a lawyer by profession. ,

After marriage, she lived for a short time in Versailles, Ky. Here and in the country
around she saw much of Southern life as it then existed, and gathered materials for Tempest
and Sunshine, her first book, which was published in 1854. Another book was brought out
soon after, called English Orphans, the scene of which is laid in her native town, Brookﬁeld.
Neither of these books made much sensation, but they were received with favor as the ﬁrst
efforts of a young author, and both sell better to~day than they did when ﬁrst published.
This is true also of her other works. They never go up like a rocket, but they sell better
a11d better from year to year.

The account which Mrs. Holmes gives of her views and aims as an author, though not
written for publication, is the best commentary upon her works: “ In writing, it is my aim
to be as true to'nature as possible, and I usually try to be very accurate with regard te
locali,ties,——I am even particular about the starting of trains from certain points. This is,
perhaps, one reason why people say of my stories, ‘that they seem so lifelike, and read as if
they must be true.’ I try to avoid the sensational, and never deal in murders or robberies
or ruined young girls; but rather in domestic life as I know it to exist. I never avowedly

attack the evils of the day, or write at some great principle, as some do; but I mean always,

to write a good, pure, and natural story, such as mothers are willing their daughters should
read, and such as will do good instead of harm; and in this I think I have succeeded.”

Mrs. Holmes lives at the pleasant village of Brockport, near Rochester, N. Y.

The following is a list of her publications: Lena Rivers; Darkness and Daylight: Tem-
pest and Sunshine; Marian Grey; Meadow Brook; English Orphans; Dora Deane; Cousin
Maude; Homestead on the Hillside; Hugh Worthington; The Cameron Pride; Rose Mather;
Ethelyn’s Mistake; Millbank. Some of these have reached a sale of 50,000. The aggregate
sale of the fourteen volumes is said to be over 500,000.

Mrs. Terhune,—-“ Marion Harland.”

MARY VIRGINIA TERHUNE, —-——— , in 1854 acquired a high repu-
tation by her ‘novel, Alone, Written under the assumed name of “Marion
Harland.” She has Written many other novels since that time, and with a
uniformity of excellence that is remarkable. I

Mrs. Terhune’s maiden name was llawcs. She was born in Virginia, daughter of Samue

504 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

P. Ilawes, at that time a merchant of Richmond. She was married in 1856 to Rev. E. P.
Terhune, D. D., then a Virginia pastor, but now in charge of the First Reformed Church,
Newark, N. J.

The best evidence of the substantial value of Mrs. Terhune’s works is that they continue’

to be in demand long after the excitement of the first publication is over. Those published
eighteen years ago sell now almost as freely as the new ones.

Hardly one of her books has sold less than ten thousand copies within twelve months after
it was issued. Most of them have been republished in England—tw0 were translated into
French, and two at least received the honor of a Leipsic edition. I

Of her married _life,‘an<l its effect upon her authorship, Mrs. Terhune writes thus: “ With-
out unveiling to the world an inner life, which has been singularly happy, I may say that

to my husband's sympathy and encouragement, to his freedom from the vulgar prejudice .

against literary women and ﬁction; to his wise and loving guardianship of my health, and
judicious supervision of my studies, I owe much of my success in my chosen profession. No
woman ever had a tenderer friend — no author a better adviser. We have worked together,
believing our mission to be the same — to make our kind better and happier.”

The following is a list ofher novels 2 Alone; Hidden Path; Moss Side ; Nemesis; Miriam; ,

At Last; Helen Gardner‘; Sunnybank; Husbands and Homes;'Ruby’s Husband; Phemie’s
Temptation; The Empty Heart. Besides these, she published in 1872, Common Sense in the
Household, a Manual of Practical llousewifery.

,M1ss MARY J. S_. UPSHUR, ——- , of Norfolk, Va., has published a novel, called Confed-
erate Notes, which attra.oted a good deal of attention. She has contributed largely to peri-
odical literature, both in prose a11d verse, generally under the name of “ Fanny Fielding.”
She was born at Rose Cottage, the old Upshur homestead, Accomac County.

MISS 1\I.-my TUCKER MAGILL, —— ———-, of Winchester, Va., has, within the last year, writ-
ten two novels which give evidence of no little creative power. These are, The Holcombes,
and Women. They contain pictures of Virginia social life, and show unusual skill in de-
scription and in delineation of character. Miss Magill was born at the residence of her
grandfather, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, in J eiferson County, Va. She spent much of
her childhood at the University of Virginia, where her father, Dr. A. T. Magill, was Pro-
fessor of Medicine. The rest of her life has been divided between Richmond and \Vinches-
ter. Having lost all her property by the war, she has since that time maintained a school
for young ladiesiat Winchester, and has been successful as a. teacher.

Mrs. Augusta Evans Wilson.

MRS. AUGUSTA EVANS WILSON, , of Mobile, has published
several‘ novels, characterized by great power of originality. These are,
Beulah, Macaria, and St. Elmo. There is much in the vigorous conception
of these works to remind the reader of Jane Eyre and Villette; and the
Writer has been called by her admirers the American Charlotte Bronte.

Mrs. Wilso11’s maiden name was Augusta J. Evans, and by this name she is most known,
as nearly all her books were written before marriage. She was born near Columbus, Ga.,
but removed in infancy with her father’s family to Galveston, and thence to San Antonio,

Ts. The family returned afterward to Georgia, and ﬁnally settled near Mobile, Ala. She

was married in 1868 to Mr. L. M. Wilson, President of the‘Mobile and Montgomery railroad.

Her ﬁrst publication, a novel called Inez, issued in 1855, was a failure. Her second,
Beulah, in 18:39, was i‘m‘mediately and completely successful. “ Everybody read Beulah. It
ran through ten or ﬁfteen editions, possibly more, in a few months. Its fresh, vigorous
style stimulated a lively interest. There was living thought in the book. That was much.
The strong vein of psychological reasoning tasked the enthusiasm of ma.ny readers of love-
stories; but still everybody read it. Those. who did not understand it desired to appear to
do so; while those who did understand it enjoyed it. The many had recently read Jane
Eyre, and Shirley and Villette with admiration. The author of Beulah was styled the Char-
lotte Bronte of America. The compliment had some meaning in it.” —J. Wborl Dcwidson.

".‘..laearia appeared in 186$,‘ and St. Elmo in 1866. Both occasioned discussion and criticism,
but are admitted by all to show remarkable power. The latter has been cleverly travestied
in a story called St. Twelmo.

Mas. E. W. BELLAMY, —— -—, a teacher in a Seminary at Eutaw, Greene County, Ala.,
has published a novel, “Four Oaks,” that is well spoken of by the critics. Mrs. Bellamy

Three Golden Links.

Mrs. Warfield and Mrs. Lee.

MRS. CATHARINE ANNE WARFIELD, 1817 , and Mas. ELEANOR
PERCY LEE, 1820-1850, gained some reputation thirty years ago by a vol-
ume of Poems by Two Sisters. The surviving sister has within a few years
gained a high name as a writer of ﬁction, especially by her novel, The
Household of Bouverie.

These ladies, sisters, were born near Natchez, daughters of Major Nathaniel A. Ware.
Their mother having become hopelessly insane, their father sold out his estates, and re-
moved to Philadelphia, partly for the better care of his wife, and partly for the education
of his daughters. Having ample means and leisure, and being an accomplished scholar,
he took upon himself the task of their principal studies, employing masters to give them
lessons in special branches. The family afterwards lived in Cincinnati, and both daughters
were married there, Catharine to Mr. Elisha Warﬁeld of Lexington, Ky., and Eleanor to
Mr. H. W. Lee of Vi~;':ksburg, Miss.

‘These ladies published jointly two volumes, Poems by Two Sisters of the West, in 1843;
and The Indian Chamber and Other Tales, in 1846. ’

Mrs. Warﬁeld, the surviving sister, lives with her husband on a farm near Louisville, Ky.
She has published, since the death_of her sister, The I-Iousehold of Bouverie; and The Ro-
mance of Beauseincourt. The former of these is commended in high terms by the critics.

Mas. EMMA MOFFETT WYNNE, 1844 ———-, daughter of Major Henry Moffett, was born in
Alabama, but removed earlyto Columbus, Ga. At the age of ﬁve she was placed 11nder the
tuition of Mrs. Caroline Lee Hentz; in her ﬁfteenth year, she went to the Patapsco Insti-
tute, near Baltimore; and in 1860, she entered the Spingler Institute, New York, but re~
turned home in 1801. She was married to Mr. Wynne in 1864. During the war she con-
tributed to the Field and Fireside, and in 1867, she published her only volume, Cragfont, a
novel.

Bins. ELIZA LOFTON PUGH, — , is a native and a resident of Louisiana. Her maiden
name was Philips. She was married at the age of seventeen to the Hon. W. W.Pugh, a
planter of Assumption Parish, where she still lives. She published, in 1867, Not a Hero,
a novel, and has written sketches, literary and political, for the New York World, and for
various New Orleans papers. She writes under the name of Arria.

 

MRS. SARAH A. DORSEY, —+ , is a native of Natchez, Miss., the daughter of Mr.
Thomas G. P. Ellis. She was married, in 1853, to Mr. Samuel W. Dorsey, of Tensas Parish,
La. Being a religious woman, she took great interest in the welfare of the slaves belonging
to her husband’s plantation, and devoted her Sundays to teaching them. This ﬁrst led her
to authorship. She is an earnest Episcopalian, and employing the ritual of that church in
the religious services of the negroes, wrote to the New York Churchman an account of her
experiences, in reply to some queries on the subject in that paper. The editor of the Church-
man gave to her communication the signature of Filia Ecclesiae, which signature she has
since adopted, or rather the first part of it, signing herself usually as Filia.

Mrs. Dorsey has published two works of ﬁction: Lucia Dare. a novel, by Filia; Agnes
Graham, a novel. Both are stories of the war. The work of hers which has won the highest
Commendations is A Life of Governor Allen, of L-.’>11is‘ana. This is regarded as a work of
great historical value, and an admirable specimen of 1.-iographical writing.

Mas. KATE A. DUBOSE, 1828 ———-, a native of England, but a resident of Sparta, Ga., and

wife of Mr. Charles W. Dubose, has published, besides numerous fugitive pieces, a novel
called The Pastor’s Household, or Lessons on the Eleventh Commandment.

Miss Dupuy.

 

ELIZA ANN DUPUY, —, has written a large number of novels
and novelettes, and acquired by them both name and money. She is one
of the regular contributors to the New York Ledger.

Miss Dupuy was born in Petersburg, Va. After the death of her father, the family having
met with reverses, she engaged as governess in the family of Mr. Ellis, in Natchez, Miss.,
where she was thrown much into the society of Catharine and Eleanor Ware (afterwards
lllrs. Warﬁeld and Mrs. Lee). She wrote while at Natchez her first novel, The Conspirator,
a story of Aaron Burr. This proving successful, she gradually gave up teaching,‘ and has
since adilicted herself systematically to authorship as a profession. She writes regularly
four hours every morning, and employs her afternoons in revision. She is under contract
to furnish Mr. Bonner with a thousand pages annually. She lives in Flemingsburg, Ky.

508 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

containing references to the history of her own family, who are of Huguenot stock ; and The
Planter’s Daughter, a Story of Sout_hern life, of which the scene lies near New Orleans.

“The tale is in an eminent degree sensational,—in the style of Mrs. Southworth and
Prof. Peck, with an inclination in the direction of Miss Braddon. It is redolent of murders,
madness, tears, robbery, revolvers, corpses, and confusions; and trips lightly through the
mazes of guilt, blood-and-thunder-ous declamation, travels, stays, love-making, and Italian
gallantry.” — J. Wood Dam'ds0n.

MRS. GEORGIANA A. MCLEOD, —— ——-, of Baltimore, was born at Pensacola, Fla..,
daughter of Isaac Hulse, M. D., then surgeon of the Naval Hospital at that place. She was
married to Alexander W. McLeod, D. D.,of Halifax, N.S.,and lived for a few years in Halifax.
She is at present living in Baltimore, and is principal of The Southern Literary Institution,
a school for young ladies. Mrs. McLeod has paid attention to literature, as well as educa~
tion, and has published the following works: Sunbeams and Shadows, 1851; Ivy Leaves
from the Old Homestead, 1853; Theirs and Mine; Sea-Drifts, 1867 ; Bright Memories.
“These volumes are eminently moral, sometimes religious, and always temperate in being
removed from the sensational and melodramatic. Those who dote on Miss Braddon’s style
of; novel will call Mrs. McLeod tame; but those who enjoy the religio-social style of Miss
Manning will pronounce Mrs. McLeod’s works cliarming.” —-J. lVo0d Davidson.

MRS. ANNE MONCURE SEEMULLER, 1838-1872, originally Miss Crane, was born in Baltimore,
and educated there in the school of Mr. Morrison. She was married in 1869 to Mr. Seemul-
ler, a wealthy gentleman of New York.» She died at Stuttgart, Germany, where she had
gone ten months before for her health. She wrote for various magazines. chieﬂy Putnam
and the Galaxy, and published three novels, Emily Chester, Opportunity, and Reginald
Archer, all of which were well received.

Marshall, of Kentucky. She began writing for the periodicals in 1863. She has published
two volumes: Gleanings from Fireside Fancies, in 1866; As By Fire, a novel, in 1869. The
latter is a tale “ of passion-life, earnest, intense, and full of pathos.” It is admitted on all
hands to be a work of much power, but slightly overwrought.

MRS. SALLIE R. FORD, 1828 ———, is a native of Kentucky, her maiden name being Roches-

ter. ' She was married, in 1855, to Rev. S. H. Ford, a Baptist preacher of Louisville. Soon

May Bunyan, the Dreamer’s Blind Daughter, 1860; Romance of Freemasonry; Raids and
Romance of Morgan and his Men, 1864. Grace Truman, published originally as a serial in
the Repository, made a reputation both for the author and the magazine. The sale of the
work in book form reached thirty thousand in three years.

MRS. JANE T. CROSS, 1817 :, is a native of Harrodsburg, Ky., daughter of Mr. Chinn.
She was educated at Shelbyville, and at eighteen became the wife of Mr. James P. Harding,
of Bardstown. In 1848, she was married to the Rev. Dr. Cross, of the Methodist Church, at
that time Professor in Transylvania University. Since that time she has resided in various

had a prodigious temporary popularity, 70,000 copies having been sold in a single year.
Three years afterward, she published another work of the same sort, Mabel, said by critics
to be superior to the ﬁrst, though it did not make so great a popular sensation.

Mr. and Mrs. Denison.

 

REV. CHARLES WHEELER DENISON, 1809 , and his wife, MARY
ANDREWS DENISON, 1826 ———, have contributed largely to current litera-

ture, in various forms, and have published a number of Volumes, which

have been well received.

Mr. Denison is a native of New London County, Conn. He began his literary career in
his minority, as the editor and publisher of -a paper in his native town. He was soon after
called to New York, where he was engaged by Arthur Tappan to edit the ﬁrst anti-slavery
paper published in that State, The Emancipator. This journal led the way to the American
anti-slavery publications of the last quarter of a century, in the preparation of which Mr.
Denison took his part.

He has been a magazine writer for several years, and a contributor to the columns of
papers in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Washington.

During the war, he wrote a popular life of Gen. Grant. _

While residing in London, Mr. Denison was editor of the American paper in that city,
having previously spent some time among the operatives of Lancashire, presenting the facts
of history supporting the Union cause.

He is the author of a volume of Poems, entitled Out at Sea, published in London; Paul
St. Clair, a story founded on facts, illustrating the necessity of total abstinence from intoxi-
cating drinks; The Frontiersman, composed of incidents in the life of a laborious Western
missionary. _

Mrs. Denison is a native of Cambridge, Mass. On her marriage with Mr. Denison, she
became connected with The Olive Branch, of which he was editor. Her sketches soon
attracted attention, and were extensively copied. Removing to Washington, D. C., she wrote
her ﬁrst articles for leading magazines. These, with others, were collected in book-form,
and published under the title of Home Pictures.

Accompanying her husband to British Guiana, West Indies, where he was United States
consul, her pen was employed on a variety of tropical sketches that appeared in the home
magazines. _ -

While located, subsequently, in Philadelphia, Pa., she wrote several-books that have ob-
tained a wide circulation, mainly in Sunday—School libraries.

When in England, in 1867, she wrote for different periodicals in that country and the
United States. A domestic book, illustrating forest scenes, called Among the Squirrels, was
issued in London.

Her works are mostly of a home character; are all designed to throw a charm around the
hearth-stone, and to give instruction as well as pleasure to the rising generation. She is
the author of over twenty books of this class. The following are the chief: Home Pictures;
Gertrude Russell; Carrie Hamilton; Jennie Boardman; Opposite the Jail; Old Hepsey;

NIARIA J. B. BROWNE, ——-— , is a native of Northampton, Mass, and a resident of New
York city. Educated for the teacher’s profession, she has found in the school-room a sphere
for the successful exercise of her talents, and a ﬁeld of untiring inﬂuence and usefulness.
She has, however, reserved leisure for the indulgence of her literary tastes and abilities,
and has devoted herself with ardor to the study of foreign languages, especially the Span-
ish, in which she has attained unusual culture. Miss Browne has written largely and ac<'ept.-
ably for magazines and newspapers, and published several small volumes : lVIargaret, Laura
Huntley, Story of a Western Sabbath-School, etc.

Through her a.cquaintance with the Spanish language, she has made a translation into
Spanish of three little books: La Rosa y El Trebol, Anita, and La Biblia Prestada. The

last, ’l‘he Borrowed Bible, written by her sister, Miss S. H. Browne, has also been rendered _

into Portuguese. The subject of this notice has translated from the French and Spanish
much miscellaneous matter, and from the latter language A History of Granada, by Jose
Francisco de’ Luque.

SARA H. BROWNE,
part of a quiet and useful life in the lovely and picturesque valley of the Connecticut, and
is a resident of Springﬁeld, Mass.

She has devoted much of her literary leisure to the preparation of pleasant and proﬁtable,
reading for the young. Among the score of little volumes she has written may be namml,
The Book for the Eldest Daughter, The Borrowed Bible, Philip Alderton, Maggie Maneal y, eh-.

Her latest production is a compilation of a great variety and amount of valuable popular
information, in a work for schools and families, entitled A Manual of Commerce. It prom-
ises to supply a need long felt by practical teachers and intelligent students.

Miss Browne has also been a constant contributor to magazine and newspaper literature,
both in graceful poetry and trenchant prose.

———, sister of the preceding, was born and has passed the greater

Mrs. Julia McNair Wright.

MRS. JULIA MCNAIR WRIGHT, 1840 , has been for the last ﬁfteen
years a most proliﬁc writer of tales. Her stories are all argumentative,

 

being directed towards some institution or custom against which she desires
to do battle. She has Written several in the cause of Temperance, and some
against Southern institutions. But her chief assaults, both in number and
ability, have been directed against the Catholics.

Mrs. Wright was born in Oswego, N. Y. She describes herself as having been brought up
among books, and as knowing even in childhood more about authors than about her play-
mates. Among the earliest purposes that she can recollect was that of becoming an author.
Another of her earliest purposes was that of doing battle against the Catholics, and her first
Sunday-School books were written mainly with a view to acquire facility in this kind of
composition, in order that in due time she might use t’..e weapon more effectively in her
chosen arena. »

The number of small volumes that she has produced is very large for so young a writer,
the count already going beyond sixty, although she began no longer ago than l858. She
considers these, however, only as preliminary and preparatory to her main purpose, which
is to produce ﬁrst-class works of ﬁction, especially on such themes as those suggested by her
three latest and largest tales, Almost a Nun, 1868; Almost a Priest, 1870; Priest and Nun,
1871. »

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 511

MISS LUCY LARCOM, 1826 ———-, has not written much, but what she has written has been
of a kind to make the public desirous of more. She is a native and resident of Beverly
Farms, Mass. She was at one time a factory operative at Lowell, and was one of those who
contributed to Harriet Farley’s Lowell Offering. Subsequently she was engaged in teaching,
in Illinois. She is at present associate editor of the Young Folks. She is the author of a
volume of Poems, and of a volume called Breathings of the Better Life, a compilation from
religious writers.

MRS. METTA VICTORIA VICTOR, 1831 ——, daughter of Mr. Fuller, and sister of Mrs. Frances
Fuller Barritt, was born at Erie, Pa. She removed in 1889 to Wooster, 0.; in 1856, she was
married to Mr. O. J. Victor, and in the year following removed to New York city, where she
and her husband pursue a literary life. -She began authorship very young, contributing to
the press tales and poems at the age of thirteen and fourteen ; and at the age of ﬁfteen, she
published, in Boston, a romance, The Last Days of Tull. At the age of sixteen, she was the
“bright particular star” of Willis in the Home Journal, who gave her the name of the
“ Singing Sibyl.” In 1851, Poems of Imagination and Sentiment, by the sisters Frances a11d
Metta Fuller, appeared, edited by Griswold. The same year, another volume, by Metta alone,
was published, called Fresh Leaves from Western Woods. In the following year she pub-
lished The Senator’s Son, a Plea for the Maine Law, of which ten editions were issued in this
country, and 30,000 copies were sold in England. The following are some of her other
numerous publications: Fashionable Dissipation ; The Two Mormon Wives; The Arctic
Queen, a poem; Miss Sli1nmen’s Widow; The Tallow Family in America; Alice Wilde;
The Backwoods Bride; Uncle Ezekiel; Maum Guinea; Unionist’s Daughter; Gold Hunters;
Jo Daviess’ Client; Myrtle ; Emerald Necklace; Laughing Eyes; The Dead Letter, etc. She
has also written The Cook’s Manual, The Housewife’s Manual,and The Recipe Book, and has
contributed to many of the leading periodicals.-——- MRS. FRANCES FULLER BARRITT, 1826 —-—,
sister of the preceding, was born at Rome, N. Y. When she was only four years old, her
father, Mr. Fuller, removed into the “ pinery ” of northern Pennsylvania, and thence in 1839
to Wooster, O. In 1852 she removed to Michigan, and in 1853 she was married to Mr. Jackson
Barritt, of Pontiac, in that State. In 1855, she went still farther west, but afterwards re-
moved to New York city. Her reputation as a writer was chieﬂy before her marriage, while
still a resident of Ohio. She began writing for the press at the age of fourteen. At the age
of twenty-two, she was a favorite contributor of Willis in the Home Journal, and was highly
commended by Poe. Azlea, a Tragedy, was written about that time. In 1851, a volume,
Poems of Imagination and Sentiment, by her and her sister Metta (Mrs. Victor), was pub-
lished, edited by Griswold.

COMPOUND INTEREST.——-By jllrs. Victor.

Ben Adam had a golden coin one day,
Which he put out at ‘interest with a Jew;
Year after year, awaiting him, it lay,
Until the doubled coin two pieces grew,
And these two, four,—-so on, till people said,
“How rich Ben Adam is!” and bowed the servile head.

rs

Ben Selim had a golden coin that day,
Which to a stranger, asking aims, he gave,
Who went, rejoicing, on his unknown way.
Ben Selim died, too poor to own a grave;
But when his soul reached heaven, angels, with pride,
Showed him the wealth to which his coin had multiplied.

e12 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Miss AMANDA M. DOUGLAS, , was born in the city of New York, but removed to
New Jersey when she was six years old. At the age of ten she returned to New York, where
she completed her education, leaving school at the age of ﬁfteen. Soon after, the family re-
moved to Newark, N." J., where she still lives. She manifested even in childhood an inven-
tive faculty, and often had a circle of youthful disteners, while she made up for them imag-
inary narratives. At school, likewise, she had great readiness in composition. After leav-
ing school, though burdened with the usual domestic cares, she kept up her habits of study,
and read largely some of the best English authors. Her ambition was to become an artist.
But as she could not command the means for this, and as, through the sickness and misfoi
t.nr~s of others, the cares of a household devolved upon her, she turned to literature, as
..omcthing which could be cultivated without leaving the seclusion of home, and without
neglecting domestic duties. I

Her published books are the following: In Trust; Stephen Dane; Claudia; Trying the
World; With Fate against Him. Besides these, which are novels, she has written a number
of religious story-books for children.

Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney.

MRS. ADELINE D. T. WHITNEY, 1824 , has made a most favorable
impression as a writer of tales. Faith Grartney’s Girlhood especially has been
a very general favorite.

Mrs. Whitney was born in Boston, daughter of Enoch Train, a merchant of that city. She
was educated in Boston, being one of the pupils of that prince of teachers, George B. Emer-
son. She was married in 1843 to Mr. Seth D. Whitney, of Milton, Mass. All the earlier
years of her married life were too much occupied with domestic cares to afford much leisure
for literary pursuits, although she wrote occasionally for the religious papers and magazines.
Her first venture in the book-line was the Book of Rhymes, in 1859. Her other volumes
since that have been: Mother Goose for Grown Folks; Boys at Chequassett; Faith Gartney’s
Girlhood; The Gayworthys; A Summer in Leslie Goldthwaite’s Life; Patience Strong’s Out-
ings; Hitherto; Real Folks; We Girls. Some of her poems contributed to the Atlantic
Monthly have been of a high order.

ESTELLE ANNA (RoBINsoN) LEWIS, 182; ——, is a native of Baltimore. She was sent at an
early age to the celebrated seminary of Mrs. Willard, at Troy, where for several years she
was an ambitious and successful student in the higher branches of learning taught there.
Edgar A. Poe, a fastidious critic, was much struck with the classical finish displayed in some
of her writings, and expressed a high estimate of her scholarship and her literary abilities.
Besides a familiar acquaintance with Latin and Greek, she speaks and writes ﬂuently
French, Spanish, and Italian. She is known chiefly as a poet. The volumes Records of the
Heart, Child of the Sea, Lo_ver of the Minstrel, etc., give evidence of a cultivated taste and
of no little imagination. She has written a good deal also in prose. Beginning while still
a school-girl, as a contributor to the Family Magazine, of Albany, and continuing, after her
marriage to-J. D. Lewis, Esq., a lawyer of Brooklyn, in the Democratic Review, and other
leading periodicals, she has contributed a large number of essays, romances, and novelettes.

MISS ADELINE TRAFTON, of Charlestown, Mass, has published a. book, the American Girl
Abroad, which was received with great eclat.

MRS. J. E. MCCONAUGHY, 1834 ,has made several valuable contributions to Sunday-
School literature. The maiden name of this lady was Julia E. Loomis. She was born at
Twinsburg, Ohio. Her father, Elisha Loomis, removed from New Haven, Conn., to Ohio, in
1817, being one of the early settlers of the Western Reserve. The first twelve years of her

FROM-1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 513

‘life were spent on a pleasant farm, where she acquired an a.bundant stock of sound health,
which, thus far, has never failed. Her father then removed to Hudson, 0., where she en-
joyed the advantages of an excellent seminary for young ladies, taught by Miss Mary
Strong. This faithful teacher has a monument more lasting than marble, in the souls of
over one hundred pupils hopefully converted through her instrumentality. It was throng".
her inﬂuence that Mrs. McConaughy’s interest in the subject of religion was ﬁrst axvakened.
She united with the Congregational church at Hudson, at the age of fourteen.

She began early to teach in Miss Strong’s school, and was engaged there, and in simifzzr
institutions, for several years. A

She was married to Rev. N. McConaughy, in New York city, June 14, 1868, and soon after
removed to Millville, N. J., which was her home for eight years. She afterwards spent two
years at Swedesboro, N. J., when she removed to her present home at Elwood.

From seven years of age, she was an insatiable reader. A fall from a carriage which broke
her ankle, when but ten years old, imprisoned her in the house for some months, and tended.
still more to develop this taste. The library to which she had access was the garret of a
neighbor, well stocked with ﬁles of old newspapers, a few magazines, and some volumes of
‘Waverley.

Her ﬁrst article for the press was a little one on “Learning Hymns,” published in the New
fork Evangelist in 1855. Since then she has written considerably for the religious news-
papers, for The Ladies’ Repository, and Mother’s Journal, and a few juvenile magazinesanzl
papers ; also regularly for a number of years for the household department in two agricul-
tural papers. , I

The following is a list of her volumes, all Sunday-School story-books: The Widow’s Sew-
ing-Machine; Hours with My Picture’-Book; Archie at the Sea—Side; Respect the Burden;
How to be Beautiful ; The Little Brook and its Travels; Minnie’s Thinking Cap; The Prize
Bible and Other Stories ; Clarence; 100 Gold Dollars; The Hard Master. ‘

Mrs. Baker,—“Made1ine Leslie.”

Mas. HARRIETTE NEWELL Woons BAKER, 1815 , known in letters

almost exclusively by the assumed name of “ Mrs. Madeline Leslie,” is un-
equalled as a Writer of Sunday-School story-books. Her productiveness
has been prodigious. Her books, too, have had a uniformity of excellence
and an unﬂagging popularity as remarkable as their number. She has pub-
lished, up to this time, no less than one hundred and sixty distinct volumes,
and the annual sales Vary from two hundred and ﬁfty thousand to half a
million. '

Mrs. Baker was born i-n Andover, Mass. She is the daughter of the late Rev. Leonard
VVoods, D. D., for many years President and Professor ofCl’11‘istia11 Theology in the Seminary
at Andover. She possessed by nature a nervous temperament, a quick sensibility and per-
ception, and a lively imagination ; and she early displayed remarkable talents for composi-
tion.

While she was a little girl in the nursery she often amused herself for hours with her fan-
cied heroes and heroines in all possibleddilemmas, from which her invention sought to rescue
them. In her eleventh year, she sent a short story to N. P. Willis, then publisher and _pro-
prietor of a small paper called The Youth’s Companion. The article was accepted and
printed in the next issue, a silver dollar being sent the young authoress in payment for it,
with the request that she would become, as she did, and long continued to be, a regular con-
tributor. '

She was educated at the Abbott I‘e1nalo Seminary in Andover, though her ﬁfteenth real‘

was passed in the Academy at Catskill, N. Y. After this she studied, under the instruction

of private tutors, mathematics, history, and philosophy.

In her twentieth year she was married to Rev. A. R. Baker, D. D., who was then a teacher
in the Phillips Academy at Andover. Encouraged by her husband, she wrote and published
early in her wedded life and during her residence in Medford, Mass., where he was settled
in the ministry, three small volumes, The String of Pearls, Louise Merton, a.nd Frank Iler-
bert. Of the second of these the proof-reader in the oﬂice where it was printed, said: “I
cannot read the proofs of that book without ﬁnding myself frequently overcome by the
power of my emotions; and I am obliged ever and anon to reread several pages, because I
become so interested in the story that I forget to make the proper correction of typographi-
cal errors.” These books were so favorably received by the public that their author resolved
to prepare others; but for several years her duties as a c1ergyman’s wife and as the mother
of ﬁve sons, now settled in professional life or engaged in preparation for it, prevented l1er
from realizing her purpose and from writing, except occasional articles for newspapers,
magazines, and reviews.

In 1850, she removed to the city of Lynn, Mass., where her husband was pastor of the
Central Church. There she assisted him several years in editing two monthly journals:
The Mother’s Assistant, and The Happy, Home, which were extensively circulated. Many
of her contributions to these periodicals have subsequently been transferred to her volumes.
From that period she wrote and published constantly, her works being issued by different
ﬁrms in Boston and New York. I -

In 1855, she published under her name of Mrs. Madeline Leslie, The Courtesies of Wedded
Life. About the same time appeared anonymously another large 12mo, entitled Cora and
the Doctor, which was ascribed to many persons of eminence in the republic of letters. In
plot and literary ﬁnish, in power and pathos, this is considered one of her happiest efforts,
and called forth most ﬂattering notices and reviews from VVashington Irving and other dis-
tinguished critics. The name of its author was repeatedly called for, and at length the call
was answered by its issue with other volumes from her pen in a series entitled, Home Life.

Many of her books have been republished in England and other countries. Few, if any
of them, have been more popular and useful than Tim the Scissors-Grinder, now published
in what is called the Tim Series. This volume ﬁrst appeared as a serial in the Boston
Recorder. Long before its completion in that paper numerous applications were received
from different houses for the right to publish it in a book. From all parts of the country
the _most delightful testimonials have been received of its excellence and usefulness in the
conversion and sanctiﬁcation of very many.

Mrs. Leslie’s books are written in good English, and are remarkably free from cant
phrases and barbarisms, from eccen tricities and extravagance, from bad grammar and
rhetorical faults, which depress the standard of literature and corrupt public taste. Her
style is simple, chaste, often elegant; her plan natural and progressive; her characters well
drawn and sustained; many of her scenes, picturesque and impressive ; and the moral tone
and inﬂuence of her writings, as several of her reviewers have said, “above all praise.”
They have compared her books, for literary execution, moral aim, and inﬂuence, with those
of Hannah More, Mrs. Sherwood, and Charlotte Elizabeth. They inculcate high moral and
religious sentiments, but are free from the dialectics of the schools, and from all sectarian-
ism; and therefore they are found in the libraries of all Christian denominations.

Her books, classiﬁed according to the age of the persons for whom they were written, have
been as follows: For adults, Home Life, 4 vols.; Silver Lake Series, 3 vols.; Golden Spring
Series, 3 vols.; The Tim Series, 3 vols.; Leslie Stories, 5 vols.; Brookside Series, 4 vols. ; Mis-
cellaneous Sunday-School Books, 8 vols. For young persons, The Dermott Family, or Illus-
trations of the Shorter Catechism, 5 vols.; Play and Study Series, 4 vols.; Little Agnes’
Library, 4 vols. ; The Good Hope Series, 4 vols. ; ‘Woodbine Series, 4 vols. For children and
youth, Georges Menagerie, 6 vols. ; Minnie and her Pets, 6 vols.; Robin’s Nest, 6 vols.; Little
Irankie Stories, 6 vols.; Rosy Dawn, 6 vols.; Woodlawn, 6 vols.; Corwin’s Nest Series, 6

vols.; Aunt Hattie’s Library, 12 vols.; Sunshine Series, 6 vols.; The Pearl Series, 12 vols.;
The Happy Home Stories, 12 vols.; Sparkling Gems, 12 vo1s., and sundry Miscellaneous Sun-

‘ day-School Books, making in all, at this date, May, 1872, one hundred and sixty vols. Some

of these books are published under her real name, others with her initials, or with Aunt Ilat-
tie, a few with some other or without any name of their author, but most of them under the
name of“ Mrs. Madeline Leslie.”

REV. A. R. BAKER, D. D., husband of the preceding, was born in Franklin, Mass., August
30, 1805. He was the son of Captain David and Mrs. Jemima Richardson Baker. He gradu-
ated from Amherst College, in 1830; taught the High School in Medway one year, from
which he was called to be Principal of the Dorchester Academy; graduated from Andover
Theological Seminary, September, 1835 ; married Harriette Newell Woods, daughter of Rev.
Dr. Leonard and Mrs. Abby Wheeler Woods of Andover,- October 1, 1835 ; was teacher of the
English department of Phillips Academy for two years. There he published The School His-
tory of the United States, which had an extensive sale, and was one of the ﬁrst books in
that department associat.ing chronology and geography with history. A ‘few years later
he was ordained pastor of the Second Congregational Church in Medford, Mass., where
he resided thirteen years. ‘During his ministry in Medford, he prepared and published
two Question Books for Bible classes, youth, and infant classes, on the Westminster Shorter
Catechism. These books, called The Catechism Tested by the Bible, were received with
great favor. Flattering notices, reviews, and letters were published, especially from the
South and West, also from England and Scotland. More than a hundred thousand copies
were published the ﬁrst year. They have been translated into several languages ——-
French, Arabic, Armeno-Turkish, and int.o the language of the Sandwich Islands, where by
order of the government they were studied as a text-book in the day-schools. These volumes
are still in use, and are sold extensively in connection with a child’s exposition of the an-
swers in the Catechism, called the Der111ott Family, in 5 vols., prepared by Mrs. Baker under
the direction of Dr. Baker.

In 1849 he was called to Lynn, and the next year was settled there as pastor of the Con-
tral Church. There, in connection with his ministerial duties, he edited and wrote a con-
siderable part of six volumes of The .\1'other’s Assistant and of The Happy Home, two month-
lies devoted to the domestic relations, duties, and enjoyments of Christian families. lie
was subsequently settled in Wellesley, Mass., and again in South Boston. ’

But the great work of his later years has been an Exposition of the Sermon on the Mount.
Connected with this Exposition is a treatise on Prayer, and another on the traits of Chris-
tian character. These volumes are now ready for the press, and will shortly be given to the
public. Dr. Baker has also published numerous Sunday—School books ; has edited and en-
larged an American edition of Cobbin’s Child’s Commentary, in 4 vols.; has edited all the
works of his wife, and assisted in carrying through the press the works of his father-in-law,
Rev. Leonard Woods, D. D., of Andover. '

MRS. ‘VIENNA G. RAMSAY, 1817 _——~, has published a large number of tales and sketches.
She was born in North Berwick, Me., where her parents, Thaddeus and Susan Morrell, still
reside. She had from childhood a passion for reading. The village library supplied such
books as Rollin’s Ancient History, Josephus, Gibbon, and other works equally voluminous
and solid; and many of these she read before she was twelve years old. As she grew
towards womanhood her love of learning increased. Her advantages for education were
poor, but she possessed the will which makes the acquisition of learning possible under
almost all circumstances. The Latin and French grammars were learned amid the daily
toils in which her hands were necessarily engaged, and while others slept, the problems of
Geometry were solved by the light of the kitchen ﬁre.

In 1840 she was married to Rev. G. P. Ramsay, whose life-work she has cheerfully shared.
Like many other clergymen, his work has been in ﬁelds widely scattered. Seven years

516 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

_ were spent in Epsom, N. H., three in Lawrence, Mass; One year, while failing health com-
pelled him to rest, she taught in llillsdale College, Mich.

The last ﬁfteen years they have resided in the State of New York.

At the age of eighteen she began to write for the press, and from that time, though her
circumstances have not been favorable to literary labor, she has been a pretty constant
contributor.

Mrs. Ramsay has written for a large number of magazines and periodicals ; also the follow-
ing books: Facts on Missions; Evenings with the Children; A Legend of the White Hills,
and other Poems.

MRS. MARY HARRISON SEYMOUR, ————, a native of New York, and a resident at present
of Pawtucket, R. L, has written the following Sunday-School books: Mollie’s Christmas
Stocking; Posy Vint0n’s Picnic; Ned, Nellie, and Amy; also, a devotional manual, for a
month, called Sunshine and Starlight. Mrs. Seymour is a daughter of the late Rev.
Abraham Browne, and the wife of the Rev. Storrs O. Seymour, of Pawtucket.

 

Mrs. Sarah T. Martyn.

 

MRS. SARAH T. MARTYN, 1805 , has written a number of ﬁctions

of a semi-historical character, illustrating important events and personages
in church history, and particularly that part of it connected with the Re-
formation. She seems to have made this portion of history a special study,
and her Writings show more than usual ability in this species of compo-
sition.

Mrs. Martyn was born in llopkinton, N. H., daughter of Rev. Ethan Smith. Her educa-
tion was conducted mostly under the eye of her father, who was a man of much culture and
ripe scholarship. She was married in 1841’ to the Rev. J. H. Martyn, a clergyman of New
York city, where she resided for twenty-ﬁve years. While there she was the editor of a
popular magazine called The Ladies’ Wreath, a charge which she relinquished when Mr.
Martyn was called to become the pastor of a church in W aukesha, Wis.

Upon her return to New York, she commenced writing for the American Tract‘Society,
and during the past few years they have published more than twenty of her works, among
which are The Women of the Bible, Life and Times of William Tyndale. Times of Knox and
Queen Mary Stuart, etc. She has been at times a contributor to most of the leading maga-
zines of the country. She is now engaged in writing another book called Hill-Side Cottage,
or Passages in the Life of Chloe Lankton. Since her husband’s death, which occurred in
1868, she has resided with lfer son, Rev. Wm. Carlos Martyn. The following is a list of her
works: Jesus in Bethany; Our Village in War Time; Allan Cameron; Evelyn Percival;
llverton Rectory; Eﬁie Morrison; Huguenots of France; Sibyl Grey; The Times of Knox
and Queen Mary Stuart; The Life of William Tyndale; Lady Alice Lisle; Phil Kennedy;
Nettie and her Sister; Winnie and her Grandfather; Daughters of the Cross; The Crescent
and the Cross; Wilford Parsonage; Margaret of Navarre; Women of the’ Bible; Dora’s
Mistake.

REV. WILLIAM CARLOS IVIARTYN, 1841 —, son of the preceding, was born in New York city.
He ﬁtted for Yale College. but on account of weakness of the eyes, did not complete the
course. Ile entered New York University Law School, and graduated in 1863. While in the
Law School he was assistant editor of the New York Illustrated News, and then of Miles
O’Rei1ly’s Citizen. After leaving the law school he commenced writing an important series
of biographical and historical books, published by the American Tract Society, viz.: Life and
Times of Milton; Life and Times of Luther; The English Puritans; The Iluguenots; and

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 517

The Dutch Reformation. This labor-covered several years, and appears to have been per-_

formed with thoroughness and care.

Having completed the above series, he was led to enter the Union Theological Seminary,
with a View to the ministry, and was graduated from that institution in 1869._ He at once
accepted a call to the Pilgrim Congregational church in St. Louis, Mo. He labored there
with marked success until Septen1bei', 1871, ‘when he accepted a call to the North Congrega-
tional Church, Portsmouth, N. 11., where he now lives.

Mr. Martyn writes with remarkable ability, and he has the reputation of being an elo-
quent preacher. Ile was married in 1866, to Miss Mercedita Ferrer, daughter of Don Fermin
Ferrer, former President of the Nicaraguan Republic.

Mrs. Sadlier-

MRS. JAMES SADLIER, 1820 ——, of New York, has Written a large num-
ber of attractive Sunday-school books, suited to the use of Catholic Sunday-
schools, and has done in this way effective service to the church of her
affections. She is also a frequent contributor to the Catholic journals, and
one of the editors of the New York Tablet.

Mrs. Sadlier, whose maiden name was Madden, was born in Cootehill, County Cavan, Ire-
land. 1Ier father, a respectable trader, having died in 1844, and her mother some years
earlier, Miss Madden emigrated to America with a. young brother, in August of that year.
In November, 1816, she became the wife of James Sadlier, the junior partner of the well-
known Catholic publishing house of D. & J. Sadlier & Co., of New York.

Previously to her marriage Mrs. Sadlier had contributed to La Belle Assemblée, a London
magazine, edited by Mrs. Cornwell Baron Wilson, and the Literary Garland, published in
Montreal, Canada. Immediately after her marriage she entered upon that career as an author
and translator, which has made her known to the Catholic community on both sides of the
Atlantic.

The following is a list of her principal original works: Alice Riordan. or The Blind Ma.n’s
Daughter; Blakes and Flanagans, a Tale of Irish Life in America; Red Hand of Ulster, or the
Fortunes of Hugh O’Neill ; Willie Burke, or the Irish Orphan in America ; New Lights, or Life

518 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

 

I MISS C. F. ORNE, —— , of Cambridge, Mass., has for a long time contributed to peri-
odical literature, and has published several volumes of tales for the young. Miss Orne was

‘born in Cambridge, and has always lived there. She has been for the last ﬁfteen years libra-

rian of the Dana Library, of that city. The account which Miss Orne gives of her earliest
studies is in itself a curious piece of history :

“ 1 do not remember when I learned to read or spell. I am told that I read the Primer
at eighteen months, and that _I crept up-stairs when my elder brother and sisters were at
their studies, and learned by listening to their teacher. I distinctly remember running
away when I was a fewmonths older to a school kept by a Miss Mason, and creeping under
a low bench, for fear the large girls (who were aged four or five) would tread on me, as they
jumped about at recess. As winter came on, that school was too distant, and I was unwill-
ingly kept at home. _

“ However, the town school was not far, but children under ﬁve were not admitted. I
made a bold effort one cold day, and bareheaded, ran away again to school. On arriving I
found the door closed and locked. I knocked, but my little cold hand made small impres-
sion. I got some stones and knocked with them, but no one came. I heard the inside door
open, and with trembling eagerness repeated as loudly as I could, the Golden Rule, as the
spelIing—book gave it, in four lines of verse. Oh joy! the key turned in the lock, the doo
opened, the master looked out, and said, ‘ What do you want, little girl .7 ’ -

“ I shook my brown curls over my eyes, and said timidly, ‘ I can read.’

“ lie invited me in, and I followed him to a seat near his desk, very proud and very bashful.”

Miss Orne has written for the Knickerbocker, Godey’s Lady’s Book, Graham’s Magazine,
Boston Olive Branch, Odd Fellow, The True Flag, Worcester Spy, and various other news-
papers and magazines, among them The Round Table, of New York. She has published two
small books of stories for children: A Day in the Woodlands, and Lucy’s Party and other
Tales. ’

Miss Orne’s productions have often been confounded with those of Mrs. Caroline Orne.

MRS. CAROLINE ORNE, -—- , began nearly forty years ago Writing tales and sketches
for the literary magazines. She has at different times written for more than twenty maga-
zines and papers, and is the author" of more than two hundred and ﬁfty tales.

Mrs. Orne was born in Georgetown, Mass. Her maiden name is Chaplin, and she is a
niece of the late Jeremiah Chaplin, D. D., President of Waterville College. She taught
school for a time in Salem, Mass. After her Inarriage, she resided at Wolfsboro’, N. H.
Since her husband’s death she has lived at Bellingham, Mass. *

made some very valuable contributions to Sunday-school literature. The

Miss KATE HAMILTON, ——- , of Bloomington, III., has written a goodly number of
Sunday-School story-books. Miss Hamilton was born in Schenectady, N. Y.,resided for a
short time in New Jersey, and afterward in Massachusetts, but was educated chieﬂy at
Steubenville, O. The following is a list of her volumes: Chinks of Clannyford; Greycliffe;
Brave Heart; Blue Umbrella; Old Brown House; The Shadow of the Rock; Norah Neil;
Nina Grey ; andFrederick Gordon. Aside from these, she has contributed to various papers
and magazines: I-I-arper’s Bazar; the Advance, of Chicago; Ladies’ Repository, of Cin-
cinnati, etc.

Many of her publications have appeared under the name of Fleeta.

Mrs. A. K. Dunning,———“Ne1lie Grahame.”

   

MRS. ANNIE K. DUNNING, ,has contributed more than ﬁfty
volumes to Sunday-School literature, many of the-m among the best to be
found in that class of works. Most of her books have been written under
the name of“ Nellie Grahame.”

Mrs. Dunning is the daughter of the late Hon. Hiram Ketchum of New York, and grand-
daughter of the late Rev. Dr. Dow of Thompson, Conn. She wasborn in the city of New
York, and received hereducation in several select schools in her native city. For a number
of years she was a pupil of the Rev. John S. C. Abbott. In the cultivation of her literary
tastes, and for skill» and ease in the use of her intellectual powers, as well as for careful
training in matters of still higher moment, she ‘is largely indebted to evening exercises,
conversations, and discussions which she enjoyed with her distinguished father, during all
the years she remained under his roof.

At the age of twelve years she was hopefully converted to Christ, under the ministry of the
Rev. Dr. Tyng, but did not make a public profession of religion till some years later. A few
years after uniting with the church, she was united in marriage to the Rev. A. Dunning,
successor to her grandfather, Dr. Dow, pastor of the Congregational Church in Thompson,
Conn. '

From childhood Mrs. Dunning had a decided taste for literary composition, but it was not
till some time after her removal to her country home that her thoughts were ﬁrst turned
to authorship; and then, primarily, in the hope of supplementing somewhat her husband’s
inadequate salary. '

Her ﬁrst. literary venture, Clementina’s Mirror, was published in 1859. Encouraged by
the success of this experiment, she soon made a second attempt, The Telescope. Very soon
Mrs. D. became a writer for the Presbyterian Board of Publication, by which house most of
her subsequent volumes have been brought out, perhaps ﬁfty in number. In addition to
these, the names of which are to be found on their catalogue, she has written for other
houses, The First Class of VVine, and Blind Jessie; Mistaken ; Only a Penny; Grace Mans-
f1eld’s Experiment; Mr. VVallingford’s Mistake; Contradictions and Triﬂes: Mary G1'ey’s
Perplexities; Little Robie; and Our Father.

520 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Mrs. Dunning has not written very much for periodicals, although she was a regular
contributor to Mrs. H. W. Beecher’s Mother’s lVIagazine until its suspension; and has been
an occasional contributor to the American Messenger, The Sunday-School Times, The Sab-
bath—School Visitor, and Mrs. Clarke’s Mother’s Journal.

Miss CATHERINE M. TROWBRIDGE, 1818 ,was born in South Mansﬁeld, C0nn., where
she still resides. The love of books and of literary pursuits seems to have been an inherit.-
ance from her maternal grandfather. But another inheritance was also hers, that of a frail
constitution, which has much limited her literary efforts. Owing to this and to some other
causes, all the education ‘she received was obtained in her native town, with the exception
of a few months spent at Norwich, Conn. She was favored in coming under the instruction
of excellent teachers both at Norwich and in her native town. Her publications, all of a
juvenile character, are the following: Dick and his Friend Fidus; Charles Norwood;
George Morton and his Sister ; Frank and Rufus ; The Two Councils; Jennie’s Bible Verses;
The Two Friends; Iloward Ashley; Nettie Wallace; The Gold Dollar; Howito Conquer;

was engaged for thirty—six years in the business of teaching in diﬁ"erent parts of the city.

into the ministry, who received their ﬁrst religious impressions in the infant school of St.
Andrew’s Church, of which she. had the charge for more than thirty years. One female mis-

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT r1ME.

VIII. I-IISTOF{IANS.'

Prescott.

WILLIAM HICKLING PRESCOTT, LL. D., 17 96-1850, stands unchallenged
as a classical historian of the highest order. His chief works, the History
of Ferdinand and Isabella, the History of Philip IL, the Conquest of
Mexico, and the Conquest of Peru, have obtained "universal acceptance as
models of historical composition.

Mr. Prescott was a native of Salem, Mass., and a graduate of Harvard, of the class of 1814-.
He was a grandson of the Colonel Prescott who was in command at Bunker Ilill.

Prescott’s name isthe most eminent in the list of American historians. He owes this dis-
tinction not merely to the intrinsic Worth of his writings, but to the rare and almost unex-
ampled perseverance‘ witlrwhich he produced them in the face of apparently insuperable
difficulties. While in his junior year at Harvard he lost, by accident, the use of one eye
altogether, and subsequently, by over-work, the free use of the other. Indeed, he was
obliged for many years to read exclusively through the eyes of another, and in this way
were accumulated nearly all the material and notes for his_Fer<linand and Isabella. During
the latter part of his life his eyesight improved so that he was able to read for himself a few
hours a day.

In 1837 appeared the History of the Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella. So great was Pres-
cott’s modesty and sense of his deﬁciencies, that no little urging and persuasion were neces-
sary on the part of his friends and his father to induce him to publish this result of so many
years of toil. The success of the work put to shame all such apprehensions in the author’s
mind, and secured him a permanent place among the great historians of his country.

In 1843, six years afterwards, appeared the Conquest of Mexico; in 1847, the Conquest
of Peru; in 1856, his edition of Robertson’s Charles 17., containing, as new matter, the sup-
plement on the cloister-life of Charles V.; in 1855, the ﬁrst two volumes of Philip II.; and
in 1858, the third volume. -

Besides his larger works, Prescott was also the author of several pieces, which appeared
chieﬂy in the North American Review, and which have been collected in one volume under
the title of Biographical and Critical Miscellanies.

In 1850 he visited Europe, travelling principally in England and Scotland. No one, since
the days of Irving, has received so general and so spontaneous a welcome. It was an almost
national ovation made to the man as well as to the historian. Those who wish to learn the
details of Prescott’s life and his method of study and composition should read his Life by
George Ticknor, one of the most interesting and faithful biographies in any language.

As a man Prescott was eminently genial and companionable. Some of the most pleasing
passages in his biography are those which give an account of his struggles with a disposi-
tion to fritter away too much time in social amusement, and of his almost laughable expe-
clients to insure diligence. Few men have had warmer friends and a serener life.

As an historian, Prescott stands in the foremost rank of narrators. He is surpassed by
others in vigor of thought. and in philosophic acumen. It has been justly remarked of him
that he does not always seize the direct connection between effect and cause. But no one
has exceeded him in faithfulness and patience of investigation. and clearness and picturesque-
ness of description, and especially in charity towards the blunders and bigotry of by-gone
generations.

RICHARD HILDRETH, 1807-1865, was born at Deerﬁeld, Mass. He graduated at Harvard, in
1826; he studied law, and was admitted to the bar, but abandoned that profession for jour-
nalism, and became assistant editor of the Boston Atlas.

526 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

In 1836, he wrote an anti-slavery novel, called Archy Moore; in 1837, he wrote for the
Atlas a series of powerful articles against the annexation of Texas. He was an active agent
in the political campaign which resulted in t.he election of Harrison. He published a trea-
tise upon The Theory of Politics and one upon Japan, besides numerous essays and reviews.

Hildreth’s chief work is his Hi_story of the United States, from the discovery of the Conti-
nent to the close of the Sixteenth Congress in 1820, 6 vols., 8vo. This history is so well
known that it need not be discussed at length in this place. In one respect, at least, it
marked a new era in American writing, for it was the ﬁrst great and persistent attempt to
strip historiography of its exaggeration and partiality, and to reduce it to the plain, straight-
f<)1'\VaI‘d statement of truths. Hildreth, perhaps, has erred on the other side, by making his
narrative too dry and cold. He is also wanting in the power of generalization and in the
piiilosophical deduction of great principles. But he has succeeded in producing a history
of the United States that is not only readable, but valuable for its careful accumulation of
facts. His work has lightened immensely the labors of those who come after him.

Bancroft.

GEORGE BANCROFT, LL. D., 1800 ———, has clearly the honor of being
thus far the ablest historian of the affairs of his own country. His History
of the United States has not escaped criticism. Yet no one has hesitated
to accord to it a place among the great historical Works of the age. In
comprehensiveness of plan, in fulness of detail, in accuracy of research, and
elaborateness of finish, and even in the minor graces of style and diction,
Bancroft’s work may be safely quoted as among the standard histories of
the World.

Mr. Bancroft, a native of VVorcester, Mass, and a graduate of Harvard, in the class of
1817, has had a distinguished career, both as a statesman, and as a man of letters. After
graduating at Cambridge, he went to Germany, and studied history and philology in Got-
tingcn, under Heeren, Bunsen, and others, and took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy
there in 1820. On his return, he and Dr. Cogswell, in 1823, established the Round Hill
School, at Northampton, Mass. He published also a volume of poems. While engaged in
the Round Hill School, he translated and published a number of IIeeren’s historical works.

. he publication of the ﬁrst three volumes of his own great historical work, 1834, 1837, and I

1840, gave him immediate and general celebrity. Being an active democrat, he received
from the party several important political appointments. He was made Collector of the
Port of Boston in 1838, Secretary of the Navy in 1845, and Minister Plenipotentiary to Great
Britain in 1846. On his return in 1849, he chose New York for his future residence, devoting
himself to the continuation of his History and to other literary pursuits. In 1867, he was
appointed American Minister at the Court of Berlin, a'nd negotiated there an important
treaty in regard to German emigrants to this country. , _

Mr. Bancroft’s great work, The History of the United States from the Discovery of the
American Continent, has now proceeded to the ninth volume. The first three volumes are
occupied with the settlement of the Colonies, the next three with the estrangement from
the Mother Country, and the next three with the War for Independence. The work as a
whole is undoubtedly the ablest, as it  the most comprehensive work on the subject, and it

is accepted for the most part as the stan<:l-.u'«l autl101‘ity. It is written with great, perhaps‘

excessive care as to the style, the author not having had the skill always to conceal his art.
His delineations of character, his descriptions of scenery, and his artistic grouping of details
are often in the highest style of historical eloquence. But his narrative seldom ﬂows with

V that exquisite simplicity and clearness which are the charm of Prescott’s pages.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 527

HENRY WILSON, 1812-1875, a distinguished American statesman, was born in Farmington,
N. H. He was a self-made man, having had no advantages of early education, except those
of the district school, and having worked his way up by thrift and study from the business
of_ a maker of shoes to a high position as one of the leading public men of the United States.
Mr. Wilson Was a diligent student, and trained himself to be an accomplished speaker and
Writer. Among his publications are: A History of the Anti-Slavery Measures of the
Thirty-seventh and Thirty-eighth Congresses; Military Measures of the United States Con-
gress; Testimonials of American Statesmen and Jurists to the Truths of Christianity; His-
tory of the Reconstruction Measures of the Thirty-nintli and Fortieth Congresses, etc. Mr.
Wilson was a leading member of the United States Senate from 1855 to 1872, and Vice
President of the United States from 1873 to the time of his death.

Ticknor.

GEORGE TICKNOR, LL. D., 1791—l87 1, acquired a permanent and honor-
able place in literature by his History of Spanish Literature, .and his Life
of Prescott.

Mr. Ticknor was educated at Dartmouth, graduating in 1807, at the early age of sixteen.
He studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1813. In 1815, having passed some years in
private study, he went abroad to remain four years. The ﬁrst two were spent in study at
Giittingen, the remainder of the time in travel and laying the foundation of his subsequently
famous library.

In 1819 he returned, and entered upon the discharge of the duties of the recently created
professorship of Modern Languages in Harvard University. This position he retained for
ﬁfteen years, contributing much by his success in teaching to a general awakening of inte-
rest in German, French, Italian, and Spanish liter-atures.

In 1835 he resigned his professorship, t.o go abroad once more. After three years, passed
chieﬂy in Spain, where he completed his library, he returned and began the preparation of
his great work on the History of Spanish Literature. It did not appear until the end of the
year 1849. Its appearance was greeted with the warmest applause by critics and scholars
of every country. In a few years it was translated into Spanish by Gayangos, and into Ger-
man by Julius. A French translation is still incomplete.

It is almost superﬂuous to speak in this place of the merits of a work so well known as
’_I.‘icknor’s Spanish Literature. It instantly acquired and still retains the chief place in its
department, effectually displacing the archaism of Bouterwek and the platitudes of Sis-
mondi. The only fault, perhaps, that may be found with Mr. Ticknor, is, that his estimates
of poetical talent are not always happy. . A

Mr. Ticknor is the author of several minor works and pamphlets, among them the Memoirs
of Nathan Appleton Haven, and Remarks on the Character of Edward Everett. But, next
in merit to his Spanish Literature, and even superior to it in many respects, is his Life
of Prescott, published in 1864. Between the two historians tl1ere_ existed a life-long
intimacy, based upon sympathy of character and community of study. Ticknor’s Life of
Prescott is the production of an author who is thoroughly familiar with every detail of his
subject, and draws from the richest collection of letters and fund of personal reminiscences.
It is, from beginning to end, alive with the warmest glow of friendship, and written in such
a charming style as to make it forever one of the treasures of the English language. It por-
trays to us the pure and happy life of a great American scholar as it unfolded itself day by
day and year by year to one who was himself a great and noble-minded scholar.

After the appearance of the Life of Prescott, Ticknor devoted himself exclusively and
-zealously to the management of the Boston Public Library. Thanks to his contributions
and his counsels, that library has grown to be the largest and best in the country, and is
now enriched by his crowning gift, his unrivalled collection of works on Spanish literature.

528 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

In casting a retrospective glance over the labors of such a man as Ticknor, it is diﬂicuii.
to decide whether he has done himself and his country more honor as an historian, as a biog-
rapher, or as a librarian.

GEN. JAMES GRANT WILSON, 1832 , was born in Edinburgh, but since his ﬁrst year h-at
lived in the United States. The greater part of his life was spent in Poughkeepsie, N. 1’.,
where his father was a bookseller. James, after completing his studies, became partner
with his father in the book—business, and in 1860 they transferred it to Chicago. In 186 ,
when the war broke out, James took an active part in raising volunteers, and afterwards in
service under Grant and Banks, and rose to the rank of General of Volunteers. After the
War he settled in New York city, and engaged actively in the profession of letters, writing
abundantly for encyclopedias, magazines, and other periodicals. Ilis separate publications
have been: Biographical Sketches of Illinois Otﬁcers ; Life and Campaigns of General Grant;
Sketches of Illustrious Soldiers ; Mr. Secretary Pepys and his Diary ; Love in Letters, illus-
trated in the correspondence of eminent persons. He edited the Works of llalleck, etc.

Motley.

JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY, D.C.L., LL.D., 1814 , has followed in
one respect the example of Prescott, and has made a select and important
portion of European history his ‘own. His Rise of the Dutch Republic,
and his History of the United Netherlands, have unquestionably ﬁlled a
great hiatus in the history of the Old VVorld.

Mr. Motley is a native of Dorchester, Mass, and a graduate of Harvard University of the

c class of 1831. After graduation he passed some time in study and travel on the Continent,

and practised law at home, but did not rise to much eminence at the bar. He also published
two unsuccessful romances, Morton’s Hope and Merry Mount, and contributed several arti-
cles to the North American Review. Motley appears to have made extensive researches in
history during all this time. In 1851 he went abroad again to collect still more materials,
and to explore the recently opened government archives. The result of his labors appeared
in 1854, in the celebrated historical work, The Rise of the Dutch Republic. This has been
followed by The Hi.-story of the United Netherlands from the Death of William the Silent to
the Synod of Dort, the last two volumes of which appeared in 1867. '

During the war, and until his quarrel with President Johnson, Mr. Motley was United
States Ambassador at Vienna, and when Grant succeeded to the administration, was appointed
Minister to England.

Motley’s merits as an historian are too Well known to require any extended discussion.
llis Rise of the Dutch Republic was rightly hailed as the dawn of a new star. The work ﬁlled
a h.ia.tus which had been long and keenly felt by both historians and the public. The inter-
est which naturally attaches to the theme itself, the glorious struggles of the Dutch for
independence, was enhanced by the careful researcli of the historian and the spirited style of
the writer. Motley has spared no time or trouble in examining contemporaneous records
which had never before been used by the historians of the Netherlands, and many of
which were still in manuscript in the government archives of Dresden, the Hague, Brussels,
Paris, etc.

The promise given by the Rise of the Dutch Republic has been fulﬁlled by its continua-
tion, the History of the United Netherlands. Throughout we ﬁnd the same careful study
the same use of freshly gathered material, the same graphic description, the same power of
continuous historical narrative.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 529

If we are to ﬁnd any fault with Mr. Motley, it must be with his style and his over-zealous
partisanship. He is apt to use single words and phrases carelessly, or at least not in accord-
ance with their exact ineaning, and is occasionally indiscriminate in his adjectives. His
sympathies are so strong in favor of the Protestant cause, and against the oppressions exer-
cised by the Spaniards, that a thoughtful critic might object that the author wrote rather
as an advocate than as a judge. His description of the revolting death of Philip the Second,
for instance, is too protracted and too bitter, and his preference for William of Orange is too
strong.

Kirk.

JOHN FOSTER KIRK, 1824 , by his History of Charles the Bold,
Duke of Burgundy, has, in like manner With Prescott and Motley, taken
an important topic in European history, and so treated it as to make the
subject henceforth his own.

Mr. Kirk was born at Frederickton, N. B. He received a classical education, chieﬂy in
Nova Scotia, under the private tuition of a graduate of one of the English universities. He
removed to Boston in 1812, and resided there till within the last two years. He assisted Mr.
Prescott in his historical researches and labors during the last eleven years of his life.

Mr. Kirk has twice visited Europe, chieﬂy for the purpose of historical investigation in the
archives and libraries of France and Switzerland. Besides his chief work, a History of
Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, 3 vols., 8vo, he has written historical and critical articles
for the North American Review, Atlantic Monthly, Lippincott’s Magazine, etc. Ile is at
present the editor of Lippincott’s Magazine, and is also preparing for publication a new
edition of Prescott’s works.

GEORGE M. TOWLE, 1840 —, was born in Washington, D. 0. He graduated at Yale Col-
lege in 1861; graduated LL. B. at Howard in 1863; practised law in Boston, 1863-1866;
was appointed U. S. consul at Nantes, France, in 1866; transferred to the consulate at Brad-
ford, England, in 1868 ; returned to Boston in 1870, and became managing editor of the Boston
Commercial Bulletin ; retired from this place in 1871.

Mr. Towle has been a contributor to the North American Review, Fortnightly Review,
New Englander, Atlantic, H-arper’s Monthly, All the Year Round, Temple Bar, London So-
ciety, Once a Week, Gentlem-an’s Magazine, The Graphic, Appleton’s Journal, Hours at
Home, The Galaxy, Lippincott’s Magazine, Putnam’s Magazine, Knickerbocker, Independent,
Golden Age, Harper’s VVeekl_v, and Appleton’s Cyclopedia.

ilis published works are A History of Henry V. of England, large 8vo; Glimpses of
History, 2 vols.

WESTON D. VVILLARD, M.D., 1825 i———, was born at Wilton, Conn., and graduated at the
Albany Medical College in 1848. He has published Biographical Memoirs of Physicians of
Albany County; Annals of the Medical Society of Albany County; Biography of Thomas
Spencer, M.D., etc.

CHARLES CAMrm«‘.LL, 1807 ——-—, is a native of Petersburg, Va., anda graduate of the College
of New Jersey, of the class of 1825. Mr. Campbell was bred to the law, but has devoted
himself to teaching and to literature. Among his publications are the following: An Intro-
duction to the History of the Colony and Ancient Dominion of Virginia, 1849; Some Mate-
rials for a Memoir of John Daly Burk; The Genealogy of the Spotswood Family in Scotland
and Virginia; The Bland Papers. '

COL. JOHN F. H. CLAIBORNE, ——-, is a native of Natchez, Miss. He was bred to the
law, served in the Mississippi Legislature and in Congress, and then removed to New Orleans
and became connected with the press. Col. Claiborne is the author of three historical works,
all written with marked. ability, and valuable for their original materials: Life and Times
of Gen. Sam. Dale, the Mississippi Partisan, 1860; Life and Correspondence of John A. Quit-
man, Major-General U. S. A., 1860; History of the War of Secession.

 

JOHN HENRY LOGAN, M.D., 1823 , was born in Abbeville District, S. C., of Scotch-Irish
lineage, and graduated in South Carolina College in 1844.’ He published, in 1859, A History
of the Upper Country of South Carolina, a work exhibiting “research, care, and thorough-
ness.”

J AMES D. MCCABE, J r., ——, is a native of Richmond, born of old Irish lineage, that
runs back to the time of the crusades. He was educated partly in Richmond, and partly
in the Virginia Military Institute at Lexington. His publication_s, chieﬂy historical, are the
following: Fanaticism and its Results, 1860; The Aid-de~Camp, a War.story,1863; Three
Plays, on war topics, 1863; Life of Lieutenant-General T. J. Jackson, l863—6L ; The Bohemian,
a Christmas book, 1863; A Memoir of Gen. A. Sidney Johnston, 1864; Life’ and Campaigns
of Gen. Robert  Lee, 1867 ; The Gray-Jackets, a compilation of wit and humor, 1867. Be-
sides these, Mr. McCabe has contributed nearly two hundred stories andaconsiderable num-
ber of poems to periodicals, and has done some editorial labor.

His greatest Work is his Life of Gen. Lee, containing over 700 pages. Of this, the follow-
ing critical estimate is quoted by Mr. Davidson : “The author has used care and industry in
collecting his materials. His style is not brilliant or eloquent, but plain, clear, and forcible.
There is no ambitious attempt at ﬁne writing. Most of his estimates of public men, and
his opinions on measures, will be accepted without demur. He seems inclined, however, to
disparage President Davis; thinks his folly and obstinacy contributed largely to the loss of
the Southern cause.”

Edward A. Pollard.

EDWARD A. POLLARD, 1838-1872, has been the ablest, the most indus-
trious, and the most conspicuous historian of the Confederacy. His chief
Work, The Lost Cause, a large octave of 50 pages, is an important part of
the literature of the times.

Mr. Pollard was born in Nelson County, Va. He was educated partly at the University
of Virginia, and partly at William and Mary. After completing his studies, he emigrated
to California, thence to Mexico and Nicaragua, thence back to the United States. He was
employed in a clerkship at Washington during the last two years of Buchanan’s adminis-
tration. On the breaking out of the war, he went to Richmond, and was during the war
the most widely known, and in many respects the ablest journalist in the Confederacy.
Since the war, he has been engaged in literary pursuits.

His p=:;blications are the following: Black Diamonds, 1859; Southern History of the War,
1866; The Lost Cause, 1866 ; Lee and his Lieutenants, 1867 ; Life of Thomas Jeﬂerson, 1868;
Life of Jefferson Davis, 1869. The Lost Cause Regained, 1868, He has also published a
number of small _paper—cover volumes; as, The Southern Spy, The Rival Adnlinistrations,
The Two Nations, A Last Appeal to the People of the South, etc.

JOHN H. WHEELER, -——-, of Murfr<=esl>oro, N C., has written two historical works:
Historical Sketch of North Carolina ;- lllstory of North Carolina.

CoL. WILLIAM ALLAN, ——- ——, of the Confederate army, published, in 1868, The Battle-
ﬁelds of Virginia, giving an account of Lee’s army from the ﬁrst battle of Fredericksburg,
1862, to the death of Stonewall Jackson, 1863.

FRANK H. ALFRIEND, ——- -——, is known chieﬂy by his Life of Jefferson Davis, 1868.
“This book, while purporting to be a biography, is a comprehensive account, from the ex-

treme Southern standpoint, of the causes and merits of the war; so that the life of Mr.

Davis is rather the nucleus than the substantial subject-matter of the text.”—R0tmd Table.

Mrs. J OHN P. MCGUIRE, —— —-—, wife of an Episcopal clergyman of Tappahannock, Va.,
kept during the war, from May, 1861, to May, 1865, an exact diary of what she felt, saw, and
did during all those terrible years. This, not written for publication, and therefore all the
more valuable for historical purposes, was published in 1867, under the title of Diary of a
Southern Refugee during the War, by a Lady of Virginia.

ROBERT R. HOWISTON, 1820 ——-, a native of Virginia, but descended from an old Scotch
family, has been for more than twenty years a leading lawyer in Richmond. In connection
With his professional pursuits, he has cultivated literature, and has produced some historical
works of high value. The following are his publications: A History of Virginia, 2 vols.
8V0, 1847 ; Lives of Generals Morgan, Marion, and Gates, 1848 ; History of the War between
the United States and the Confederate States ; Report of the Joint Committee of the Confed-
erate Congress on the Treatment of Prisoners, 1865.

 

WILLIAM J AMES RIVERS, —— , a native of Charleston, and Professor of Ancient Lan-
guages and Literature in the University of South Carolina, has published A History of South
Carolina to the close of the Proprietary Government. This History is spoken of by compe-
tent critics as a work of careful original research, and a most valuable contribution to our
native historical literature.

FRANCIS VINCENT, 1823 —-—, is a native of Wilmington, Del. He edited for many years
The Blue Hen’s Chicken,at Wilmington, and has written A History of the State of Delaware.

John Gilmary Shea, LL. D.

JOHN GILMARY SHEA, LL. 1)., 1824 , has been a diligent student of
history, and particularly of that relating to Catholic institutions, bibliogra-
phy, and literature in the United States, and has made Valuable contribu-
tions to historical literature, both as anoriginal author, and as a laborious
and critical editor. 1

\

Dr. Shea was born in New York city, and educated at the Grammar School of Columbia
College, in which his father was for many years one of the Principals. He is descended from
N. Upshal, celebrated in Longfel1ow’s New England Tragedies, who was thrown into prison
in New England for counselling toleration, and died there, the ﬁrst martyr to the cause.

Dr. Shea’s attention was ﬁrst called to the romantic interest of the early French colonies
in America by reading Bancroft‘s third volume. Since that time he has cultivated the ﬁeld
with special diligence. llis efforts are all the more praiseworthy from the fact that they
are not the fruits of learned leisure, but of hours snatched from business.

The following are his principal publications: Discovery and Exploration of the Missis-
sippi Valley; History of the Catholic Missions among the Indian Tribes of the United States ;
Early Voyage Up and Down the Mississippi; Perils of the Ocean and Wilderness; The
Fallen Brave, biographies of officers who fell in the war; The Lincoln Memorial; Bibliog-
raphy of American Catholic Bibles and Testaments; The Catholic Church in the United

532, AMERICAN LITERATURE.

States; Life of St. Angela of Merici of Brescia; Legendary History of Ireland; Catholic
Missionaries killed on the Indian Missions in the United States, published in the Catholic
Magazine.

His labors as translator and editor have been as follows: Charlevoix’s New France, trans-
lated and edited, 6 vols.; Memoirs and Relations concerning the French Colonies in North
America, a series of manuscripts collected and edited by him. in 20 \'ols.; Operation of the
French Fleet under De Grrasse ; Washington’s Private Diaries; The Library of American Lin-
guistics, a series of Grammars and Dictionaries of the Indian Languages, 13 vols. He has also
compiled several school-books for Catholic schools, two popular prayer-books (St. John’s
Manual, and the Seraphic Manual), and has edited under the direction of Bishop McClosky an
extremely accurate and valuable edition of Chal1oner’s version of the Douay Bible.

Ile edited the Historical Magazine for seven years (1859-1865).

J OHI-I AUGUSTUS SHEA, 1802-1845, was born in Ireland. He emigrated to the United States
in 1827. IIe contributed to various magazines and newspapers, and published the following
works : Ruddeki, a romance in verse; Adolph and Other Poems; Parnassian Wild Flowers;
Clantarf; Poems.

RICHARD MCSHERRY, M.D., 1817 , Professor in the medical department of the Univer-
sity of Maryland, has found time to diversify his professional engagements by contributing
to popular literature.

Dr. McSherry was born at Martinsburg, W. Va. After receiving a classical education in
that town and at Georgetown College, he engaged in the study of medicine, and graduated
at the University of Pennsylvania in 1841. He entered the medical stalf of the army early,
and served in the ﬁeld, in Indian warfare, for about two years in Florida. Getting tired of
life in the backwoods, he transferred himself to the navy, and made a cruise around the
world in the U. S frigate Constitution, in 1844, ’45, and ’J.6. On his return from the East,
he entered once more the land forces, and was actively engaged in the campaign in Mexico,
under Gen. Scott, and after the capture of the capital, remained there until the declaration
of peace. '

His knowledge of the Spanish language, with other circumstances, gave him, while in
Mexico, access to the houses of many highly intelligent Mexican, Spanish, and foreign fam-
ilies. From these personal associations he derived no little information as to the manners
and customs, as well as the history and traditions, of the Mexican people. He gradually
became interested in the fortunes and misfortunes of these people, and after his return
found that his diary contained a mass of facts not familiar to the American public. This
was the origin of his work called El Puchero, or A Mixed Dish from Mexico, in which mili-
tary sketches of Gen. Scott’s campaign were blended with observations upon the social,
political, and moral condition of a neighboring people, living under a very bad imitation, or
caricature, of a republican government.

Shortly after the Mexican war, he resigned his commission in the navy and entered

“actively upon the practice of medicine in the city of Baltimore. His professional occupations
were much increased by an appointment to a professorship in the Medical Department of
the University of Maryland, which he still holds. Such engagements left little time for
literature, but he has made contributions from time to ‘time to various medical journals, as
well as to some of a purely literary character.

He has published one book since, made up of Essays and Lectures, on the following sub-
jects: The Early History of Maryland; Mexico and Mexican Affairs; A Mexican Campaign;
Homoeopathy; Elements of Hygiene; Health and Happiness.

JAMES MCSHERRY, 1819-1869, was born in the village of Liberty, Frederick County, Md.
In 1838, being then not quite nineteen years of age, he graduated at Mount St. Mary’s Col-
1ege,Mary1and, and at once removed to Frederick City, Md., to begin the study of the law.

FROM 1850 TO ‘THE PRESENT TIME. 1533

After his admission to the bar, in 1840, he removed to Gettysburg, Pa, and entered the law-
oﬂice of the late Thaddeus Stevens. He remained with Mr. Stevens about a year, when
he returned to Frederick, and there continued in his profession until his death in 1869.

Mr. McSherry had always an inclination to literary pursuits, and after his admission to
the bar he became a regular contributor to the United States Catholic Magazine.

In 1846 he published Pere Jean, or The Jesuit Missionary, which was republished in Lon-
don, and afterwards reprinted in Baltimore, under the title of Father Laval.

In 1848 he published McSherry’s History of Maryland, the only work containing the his-
tory of that State from its settlement down to that date. Another and smaller edition, de-
signed for the use of schools, was published in 1852, and adopted in many of the schools of
the State. An abridgment of this is now the text-book used in most of the schools of Mary-
land.

In 1851 he published‘Willitoft, or the Days of James the First, a Tale. Of this work,
Brownson says: “The author has a cultivated mind, a high order of ability, and a dash, at
least, of real genius. His style, though slightly inclining to the ﬂorid, and sometimes deﬁ-
cient in ﬂexibility and naturalness, is that of a practised writer, and not surpassed in force
and beauty by that of any of our popular writers. In its graver parts it is marked by a
calm and subdued strength which is refreshing in these days, when almost every writer
scorns repose and is perpetually striving to appear stronger than he is.” The work was
translated into German.

He occasionally wrote for Catholic magazines, and lectured in Philadelphia, New York,
and Williamsburg, for Catholic charities.

“In religion, Mr. McSherry was born and educated, and lived and died, a Roman Catholic,
and all his writings give evidence of the faith that he professed and practised.”

VYILLIAM HENRY FOOTE, D.D., 1794-1869, one of the Fathers of the Presbyterian Church
in Virginia, did a valuable service to letters by his contributions to local history. His
Sketches of North Carolina, and Sketches of Virginia, contain a vast amount of historical
information derived from original sources, and by means of personal inquiries. Besides
these volumes, he left another work, which was published after his death, called The
Huguenots, or Reformed French Church.

Dr. Foote was born in Colchester, Conn., and educated at Yale, graduating in 1816. He
studied theology at Princeton. All his ministerial life was spent in Virginia, except a part
of one year in North Carolina. He was settled at Romney, W. Va., in 1821, and most of his
time, from that date to the time of his death, was given to labor in that vicinity.

JOHN B. DILLON, 1807 ——, was born in Brooke County, Va. When John was an infant,
his father removed to Ohio. There John learned in the district school “to read, write, and
cipher.” At the age of nine, his father dying, John returned to his native county and ap-
prenticed himself to a printer. AL the age of seventeen, with no capital but his composing-
stick, he went to Cincinnati to seek  fortune. Like many others in his position, while
setting type he courted the muses, contributing poems, in 1826-1829, to the Cincinnati
Gazette, the Cincinnati Mirror, and Flint’s Western Review. In 1834, he went to Logans-
port, Ind., and began editing a paper. His tastes led him to the study of local history, and
i11 1842 he published Historical Notes, as the ﬁrst-fruits of his inquiries. In 1845, he was
elected State Librarian, and ﬁlled the office for a series of years. In 1859, he published A
History of Indiana, a large volume of 636 pages, 8V0, containing a history of the entire
1\'orth-West Territory, as well as of Indiana, and an exceedingly valuable contribution to
local history.

5534 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

GEORGE STILLMAN HILLARD, 1808 -—-—, born at Machias, Me.; graduated at Harvard, 1828:
admitted to the Suffolk bar, where he has practised ever since. Hillard’s life has been a
busy one, he having served in the city government of Boston, and in both branches of the
State legislature; also as editor of the American Jurist, and contributor to the North
American and to various other reviews. He has also delivered a num_ber of choice
orations, of which the most famous,.perhaps, is the Eulogy on Daniel Webster. The hap-
piest of his essays, according to Griswold, is that on The Mission of the Poet. Hillard has
published Six Months in Italy; translated Guizot’s Essay on the Character of Washing-
ton, and edited a valuable edition of the works of Spenser. He has also prepared a series of
Graded Readers, in four parts, which are highly esteemed and widely used throughout the
schools of the country. He published in 1864 a Life of McClellan.

President A. D. White.

ANDREW DICKSON VVHITE, LL.D., 1832 ———-, President of Cornell
University, has given special attention to historical ‘studies, and has made
several valuable contributions to historical literature.

Mr. White is a native of Cortland County, N. Y. He studied one year at Hobart College,
Geneva, and passed the remainder of his collegiate course at Yale, graduating in 1853. In
his Senior year he succeeded in taking the Yale Literary and the De Forest prizes. After
graduation he spent upwards of two years in Europe, chiefly at Berlin and Paris, in the
prosecution of historical studies. He was also Attaché to the American‘ Legation in St.
Petersburg for six months, and travelled on foot through many of the historical grounds of
the Continent, especially in northern and western France. He returned to America in 1856,
and passed one year at Yale,‘as special student of history. During this time he contributed
to the New Englander the article On the Study of History, and to the Atlantic Monthly an
article On Jefferson and Slavery.

In 1857 he was elected to the chair of History and English Literature in Michigan Univer-
sity. This institution was then far from its present ﬂourishing condition, and had in fact
seen hard times. It had suffered much from the jealousy of denominational interests and
of uneducated men, in addition to the trials incident to any attempt at university organi-
zation in a new district of country. Through the able management of President Tappan,
aided by the generous exertions of several of the faculty, —conspicuous among whom was
Mr. White, — the University was fairly set upon its present path of prosperity. While Pro-
fessor in the University, Mr White published a Syllabus of Lectures on Modern History,
contributed to the Atlantic Monthly articles on The Administration of Richelieu, and on
The Growth and Declination of the Serf System in Russia, and delivered throughout‘ the
State numerous lectures on historical subjects. So strenuous were his exertions during this
period that his health became impaired, and he was obliged to resign his professorship in
1862 and travel in Europe for six months. While in London he published A Word from
the Northwest, in reply to certain strictures in Dr. Russell’s Diary.

He returned to Syracuse, N. Y., in the fall of 1862, and was elected to the State Senate,
and re-elected in 1864. During his two terms in the Senate Mr. White devoted his attention
to the relations between the State and the Federal Government, then extremely complicated
by reason of the war, and to the State educational system. He was Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Education, and introduced several important bills, among them those for making
the common schools entirely free, for establishing Normal schools, and forcodifying the
laws relating to public instruction, etc. As member of the Committee on Municipal Affairs
he was appointed one of a commission to investigate certain departments in New York
city. These investigations resulted in the abolishment of the old sanitary board and the
establishment of the present Board of Health, a measure which proved to be the rescue of
the city from threatened attacks of cholera. '

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 535

During Mr. White’s term of otﬁce the question arose as to the acceptance by the State of
the Congressional land endowment for colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts. The
share allotted to New York amounted to nearly a million of acres. There was much differ‘-
ence of opinion as to the proper disposition of this immense gift. Tl1e friends of the already
existing colleges wished to have it parcelled among them, and there seemed no prospect of
a satisfactory.‘adjustment. Mr. White opposed from the first this scheme of division, and
advocated the policy of keeping the endowment as an entirety for founding a new institu-
tion which should be worthy of the country and the State. Mr. Cornell, himself a senator
at the time, then came forward and offered an additional donation of $500,000, provided the
Congressional endowment should be preserved intact and the institution located at Ithaca,
Mr. Cornell’s native town. After further delay and discussion the offer was accepted, and
ﬁnally in 1865 was passed the bill incorporating The Cornell University. This may be re-
garded as a _turning point in Mr. White’s career. . Henceforth he was to serve the interests
of education in a newer and higher sphere than before.

While senator he delivered several important addresses, among them the speech on Gov.
Seymour’s message, on Municipal Affairs in New York city, on the Cornell University Bill,

and the address at the services commemorative of the death of President Lincoln. At the

expiration of his senatorship he was elected to the Professorship of the History of Art and
the Directorship of the Art Department in Yale College, but declined. He was appointed a
Trustee of the newly incorporated Cornell University, and was elected President in 1866.
Since then his time and attention have been devoted to the University. He visited Europe
for the third time, in 1867-1868, for the purpose of examining into the organization of the
leading schools of agriculture and technology, and of purchasing books and apparatus for
the university. He returned in July, 1868.

As might be expected, Mr. White has had but little leisure for authorship. In 1866 he
published the Report of the Trustees on the Organization of the University; in 1867 he de-
livered the 4). /3. K. Oration at Yale on The Greatest Foe to Democracy; in 1868, the inaugural
address at the opening of the University; 1869, an address before the State Agricultural
Society on Scientiﬁc Education, and one before the Cooper Institute on The Battleﬁelds of
Science. In 1870 he was appointed oneuof the United States Commissioners to San to Domingo,
and took a leading share in the preparation of the oﬁicial report of the Commission. His
greatest work, however, is the University itself, a perpetual witness to his zeal and executive

A ability. Mr. White has hitherto sacriﬁced to its interest his chosen studies. But now that

the University is placed upon aﬁrm basis and thoroughly organized, it is to be hoped that
he will henceforth be able to devote himself to those historical studies for which he is so

well qualiﬁed by temperament and special training.

FRANCIS PARKMAN, J n., 1823 , a native of Boston, and a graduate of Harvard, of the
class of 1844, is the author of several valuable contributions to American history: The
California and Oregon Trail, or Sketches of Prairie Life; The Conspiracy of Pontiac; The
Jesuits in North America; The Discovery of the Great iWest ; and The Pioneers of France in
the New World. By these special studies Mr. Parkman has made himself an authority on
all that is connected with the early settlement of the West. His style is admirably clear
and graphic, and his treatment of the subjects is to be commended for its impartiality. The
Conspiracy of Pontiac is the description of one of the most thrilling episodes in American
history, andis told in a manner worthy of the theme.

WINTHROP SARGENT, 1825 ———, is a native of Philadelphia, and a graduate of the Univers-ity
of Pennsylvania, of the class of 1845. He is at present a member of the New York bar. Mr.

-Sargent is the author of several valuable Contributions to American history. These are,

The History of Braddock’s Expedition, The Loyalist Poetry of the Revolution, The Life of
Major Andre, and one or two minor works. He has also contributed to the North American
Review, and other magazines, and has devoted much time to the preparation of a complete

536 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

catalogue of works relating to America. This is not yet ﬁnished. Mr. Sargent’s works are
distinguished by accuracy of research and an impartial spirit.

JOHN DENNISON BALDWIN, A. M., 1809 ————, by his work on Ancient America, and his Pre-
Historic Nations, has made for himself an honored place among the contributors to histor-
ical literature. Mr. Baldwin was born in North Stonington, Conn., and began very early in
life to depend entirely upon himself, his father having inherited a handsome fortune with-
out ability to keep it. When sixteen years old he was found qualiﬁed to become a teacher.
In fact, he was nearly ﬁtted to enter college, having resolved to obtain the best education
possible and to study law. He did not graduate regularly, although he studied at New
llaven ; and he did not become a lawyer, although he read law. He ﬁnally studied theology
and graduated in the theological seminary at New Haven; and in 1839, the College gave him
the honorary degree of Master of Arts.

He did parish service several years, chiefly at North Bradford, Conn., as an Orthodox
Congregationalist. Chronic laryngitis, by disabling his voice, constrained him to become
ajournalist, and he has been more or less closely connectd with newspapers for more than
thirty years.

After being connected with various newspapers, he bought in 1858 the VVorcester Daily
Spy, which he still owns and conducts.

From March 4, 1863, to March 4, 1869, he represented his district in Congress.

Besides writing much for the magazines, he has published three books, as follows: Ray-
mond Hill and Other Poems, 1847; Pre—IIistoric Nations, 1869; Ancient America, in Notes
on American Archaeology, 1872.

The two works last named display great research, as well as great sobriety of judgment,
and are exceedingly interesting.

Henry C. Lea.

 

HENRY CAREY LEA, 1825 , has, while zealously pursuing his pro-
fession as a bookseller, found the leisure to prosecute historical research,
and has given to the public several interesting volumes as the fruit of his
studies.

Mr. Lea was born and has always lived in Philadelphia. He is by profession a bookseller,
and represents the oldest bookselling establishment in the United’ States, that founded in
the last century by Matthew Carey,and continued new in the same family to the third gen-
eration in the person of Mr. Lea. The efforts to keep up the business of the old house have
not left him much leisure for study. He has, however, managed to make several valuable
contributions to literatute.

Besides numerous fugitive writings, political and literary, he has published three vol—.

umes: Superstition and Force : Essays on the Wager of Law, the Wager of Battle, the Ordeal,
and Torture; An llistorical Sketch of Sacerdotal Celibacy in the Christian Church; Studies
in Church History: The Rise of the Temporal Power, Beneﬁt of Clergy, Excommunication.

“ His books have it for the prime element of their value that they contain authentic his-
tory, drawn directly from its sources. The author has, indeed, his historical theories; he
marks with Care the development of ideas and tendencies, and traces with delicate skill the
ﬁlaments that bind seemingly isolated events, and give unity to the collective movement

of a race or an age; yet he never generalizes till he has all the facts within his grasp ; his ~

conclusions never furnish him his premises, he never picks over his materials to select only
such as will sustain his theories. In ﬁne, these essays are models in their kind -— the simple,
orderly presentation of facts, events, and movements in their bearing on their respective sub-

jo.cts—— each a complete and exhaustive monograph, containing, with ample means for veri-
ﬁcation in references and extracts, all that the reader needs to place himself at the point of
view which the author has attained by the most painstaking and elaborate research.”—-

J OHN ROMEYN BRODHEAD, 1814 ———, was born in Philadelphia, but is a resident of New
York. He was graduated at Rutgers College, N. J. He was for several years attached to the
American Legation at the Hague, and while there was employed by the State of New York
as agent to collect information in regard to the early history of that State. He spent three
years exploring the public records in Holland, Paris, and London, and returned in 1844,
bringing with him 80 volumes of documents. The Legislature subsequently authorized the
publication of these in 10 vols. 4to. Mr. Brodhead has commenced a popular History of the
State of New York, which bids fair to become a classic, ranking with the works of Prescott,
Motley, and Irving. Two volumes have already appeared .

WILLIAM ADEE WHITEHEAD, 1810 ---, is a native and resident of Newark, N. J. He was
Collector of Customs at Key West, 1830-38, and afterwards, for a long time, an oﬂicer in the
New Jersey Railroad Company. He is at present connected with a11 Insurance Company in
Newark. He has been for a long time a Trustee of the New Jersey State Normal School, and
became President of the Trustees on the death of Judge Field, in 1871. Mr. Whitehead, though
all his life engaged in active business, has found the leisure to prosecute historical studies,
and has made several contributions to the history of New Jersey. The following are his
principal publications: East Jersey under the Proprietary Government; Biographical
Sketch of William Franklin, Governor of New Jersey; Contributions to the early History
of Perth Amboy; Circumstances leading to the Establishment, in 1769, of the Northern
Boundary Line between New York and New Jersey; The Eastern Boundary of New Jersey ;
A Review of Circumstances connected with the Settlement of Elizabeth, etc.

MANSFIELD TRACY WALWORTH, 1836-1873, was born in Albany, His father, Reuben H.
Walworth, was at that time chief judge of the Court of Chancery of New York State, and is
well known to all jurists as Chancellor Walworth, the last Chancellor of New York State.

Mr. Walworth graduated at Union College at the age of eighteen years, studied law at
the’ Cambridge law school, and was after three years study admitted to practise law in the
courts of New York State and the Supreme Court of the United States. He became imme-
diately connected with the great Spike Case of the Troy Iron and Nail Factory vs. Erastus
Corning of Albany, as clerk of the reference, and remained clerk of that great suit involving
$1,200,000 for ten years.

While acting in this capacity, he wrote Lulu, a Tale of the National Hotel Poisoning, of
which 5,000 copies were sold;—then came Hotspur, a Tale of the Old Dutch Manor, of

538 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

which about the same number were sold. His next work was Stormc1iff',a tale of the
Hudson, of which the sale was still greater.

In 1869, he published the novel, Warwick, or the Lost Nationalities of America. It was
highly praised and vigorously attacked both in America, and England, and in three years
has sold 75,000 copies. In 1871 came out Delaplaine, an historical novel of the Persian and
Russian war of 1826-1828. It also was successful, the sale being 45,000 copies. In 1872
was published Beverley, with like success. '

Mr. Walworth, before his death, had completed a large volume, The Life of Chancellor
Livingston, the ﬁrst Chancellor of New York State. It was intended to be the ﬁrst of six
volumes, to be called the Lives of the Six Chancellors of New York State, one volume to
each chancellor. The work was one requiring great study and research, covering to a
certain extent the history of New York from 1746 to 1868.

REV. B. F. DE COSTA, 1831 —, a clergyman. of the Episcopal Church, has published

THOMAS BUCKINGHAM SMITH, 1810-1871, was born on Cumberland Island, Ga. Business
called his father to Mexico, and an appointment as United States Consul at that city led to
a residence there of several years, whi1e,St. Augustine had become the home of his family.
In, his boyhood young Buckingham was for a time in Mexico, where he acquired great
facility in the Spanish language and a Spanish tone that adhered to him through life. At
the age of fifteen he had the misfortune to lose his father, and was soon after placed at

Washington, now Trinity College, in Hartford, Conn., to pursue the scientiﬁc course in that ,

institution. Having resolved to devote himself to the legal profession, he next entered the
Cambridge Law School, and afterward studied in the oﬂice of Judge Fessenden in Portland,
Me. On completing his studies he commenced the practice of his profession at St. Augus-
tine. As the growth of his business was slow, he was tempted into the avenue of political
life, and was elected to the Assembly of Florida, and promoted to the Speakership.

In 1850, he was appointed Secretary of Legation to Mexico, a position for which his int.i-
mate knowledge of Spanish life and language pre-eminently ﬁtted him. Here he collected a
rich st.ore of documents relating to the history of Florida from the archives and libraries
of that capital. In 1851, he became United States Charge d’Affaires near the Government
of Mexico, and on the appointment of a new minister resumed his duties as Secretary.

From 1855 to 1858, Mr. Smith was employed as Secretary of Legation to Spain, and. dis-
charged with eminent ability the diplomatic duties of that position. During this period he
formed the acquaintance of the distinguished orientalist, Don Pascual de Gayangos, and De
Rios the editor of Oviedo. He also industriously explored the archives at Simancas and at
Seville, collecting documents, portraits, coats of arms, and other objects bearing on his pro-
jected Work—an exhaustive history of Florida. This purpose he did not live to accomplish,
but he left a rich mass of materials to be used by other bands. "In 1865, he spent several
months in Spain, making important additions to the historical matter he had before brought
together.

The following are his principal printed works: Narrative of Alvar N uiiez Cabega de Vaca;
Memoir of Hernando de Esealente Fontaneda; Espiritu Santo Bay; History, Language, and

Joseph Thomas.

J OSEPI-I THOMAS, LL. D., . , of Philadelphia, has made the
reading public of every name his debtors by his Gazetteer and his Bio-
graphical Dictionary. Better Works of the kind have never been published
in English.

Dr. Thomas is a native and resident of Pliiladelphia. He published in 1845, in connection
with Thomas Baldwin, A Pronouncing Gazetteer, afterwards enlarged into A Complete Pro-
nouncing Gazetteer or Geographical Dictionary of the World, 2317 pp. large 8vo. He is the
author also of A Comprehensive Medical Dictionary ; First Book in Etymology; and Travels
in Egypt and Palestine. But his chief work is A Biographical Dictionary in two large vol-
umes, 2345 pp. This work is a marvel of accuracy, and of judicious condensation. Most
large works of this kind being produced by many hands, want uniformity of treatmert, and
are very unequal, —— good on some points, poor on others. Dr. Thomas’s book seems to be
entirely his own, and is remarkably homogeneous. The same careful, conscientious ‘hand
is traceable in every article, big or little. It is, to a most unusual degree, uniform throug‘i-
out, and uniformly good. Dr. Thomas is now engaged in the preparation of A New Illus-
trated American Cyclopaedia, to be completed in 3 vols., imp. 8vo.

REUBEN ALDRIDGE GUILD, 1822 ——, Librarian of Brown University, has made some valu-

Mrs. E. F. Ellet.

MRS. ELIZABETH FRIES ELLET, 1818 —-———-, has contributed largely, in
various ways, to literature, but has achieved her most lasting success in the
line of biographical and historical composition.

Mrs. Ellet is a daughter of Dr. W. N. Lummis. She was born in Sodus, N. Y., and edu-
cated in Geneva and Aurora, on Lake Ontario. Her parents were persons of strict religious
principles, and instructed their children most carefully in the doctrines and practices of
Christianity. Mrs. Ellet, like the other members of her family, has remained steadfast in
the faith in which she was educated. She was married at an early age to Dr. W. Isl. Ellet,
then a Professor in Columbia College, New York. He was elected soon after to a Professor-
ship in South Carolina College, in Columbia, S. C., in which place they lived for thirteen
years. They then returned to New York, where Dr. Ellet died, and where Mrs. Ellet still
resides.

Mrs. Ellet began authorship at an early age, and has been an industrious and highly popu-
lar writer. Besides contributing largely to the magazines and reviews, she has published
numerous books. The following are the chief: Poems, Original and Selected ; Teresa Con-
tarini, a Tragedy; Scenes in the Life of J oanna of Sicily ; The Characters of Schiller; Ram-
bles about the Country ; Evenings at Woodlawn ; Family Pictures from the Bible; Watch-
ing Spirits; Novelettes of the Musicians; Legends and Traditions of European Nations;
Summer Rambles in the West; Pioneer Women of the West; Queens of American Society ;
The Court. Circles of the Republic ; The Domestic History of the American Revolution; The
Women of the American Revolution. The last-named work is the one by which she has won
her highest laurels. Much of the material was collected from private and original sources,
making the work a positive addition to the national history. and the narrative and coloring
are given with rare artistic skill. The work has passed through many editions, aI1d deserves
to become a part of the permanent literary wealth of the nation.

FRANK MOORE, 1828 , is a native of Concord, N. H. Mr. Moore is the author of several
valuable contributions to American history. The ﬁrst was Songs and Ballads of the Ameri-
can Revolution. This was followed by the Cyclopeedia of American Eloquence, a well chosen
compilation from the great Speeches of great American orators, beginning with James Otis
and ﬁnishing with S. S. Prentice. The last work is The Rebellion Record, a collection of

documents, reports, descriptions, and other contemporaneous matter relating to the war,
1861-1865. It has the great merit of preserving in compact form a mass of important
data and incidents which might otherwise have been scattered or even lost.

JAMES O. NOYES, M.D., 1829 , was born at Owasco, Cayuga County, N. Y. He was at
one time surgeon in the Ottoman army. He has been connected, editorially and otherwise,
with the Knickerbocker Magazine, Putnam’s, and The National, and has been Correspon-
dent of the New York Tribune and the London Morning Chronicle. He has written Rou-
menia, the Border Land of the Christian and the Turk ; and The Gypsies, their History, Origin,
and Manner of Life. '

ROBERT TOMES, 1816 ——-—, was born in the city of New York. He was graduated at Trinity
College, Hartford, and afterward studied medicine in Philadelphia and in Edinburgh. He
made several voyages as ship surgeon in the vessels of the. Paciﬁc Steamship Company,
between Panama and San Francisco. His ﬁrst volume, Panama in 1855, contains a graphic
account of an excursion from New York to Panama by the newly completed railroad across
the isthmus. This was followed in 1856 by Lives of Richard Coeur de Lion, and Oliver Croni-
well. He assisted in compiling the Narrative of Perry’s Expedition to Japan, and in pre-
paring Appleton’s Cyclopaedia of Biography. His other works are: Battles of America by
Sea and Land,inc1uding the war of 1812, and the war with Mexico ; The War with the South.
He has contributed also to Harper’s Weekly and Monthly, and to the Evening Post.

J. WATTS DE PEYSTER, 1821 ——-, a descendant of the old De Peyster family of New
York, holds the rank of brigadier-general in the State militia. Gen. De Peyster is the
author of several works, the most important of which are the Life of Leonard Torstenson ;
The Dutch at the North Pole and the Dutch in Maine; Secession in Switzerland and in the
United States compared; and Decisive Conﬂicts of the Late Civil War. The Life of Torsten-
son was honored with a medal from the king of Sweden. Gen. De Peyster has also edited
one or two military journals and contributed largely to the reviews.

Lossing.

BENSON JOHN Lossme, 1813 ,by his pictorial books of Various
kinds, has not only given a special interest to many places memorable for
their historical associations, but he has preserved from destruction many
important facts and traditions connected with the national history.

Mr. Lossing is a native of Dutchess County, N. Y. Before the publication of the works by
which he is chieﬂy known, he was the editor of two papers in Poughkeepsie. His principal
works are: Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution; Life and Times of Philip Schuyler; Life
of Washington; Pictorial History of the Civil War of the United States ; History of the War
of 1812. Mr. Lossing’s works are full of illustrations, nearly all of which are drawn and
engraved by himself. The Pictorial Field Book of the Revolution, for instance, has 1,100
engravings, and the author travelled nine thousand miles in collecting the materials. No
one, probably, has done more than Mr. Lossing to diffuse an accurate knowledge of the
revolutionary period of United States history. His works are a treasure-house of facts and
incidents connected with the leading events and prominent families of those times.

SAMUEL PEN-NIMAN BATES, LL. D., 1827 ——'-, was born in ‘Mendon, Mass. The rudiments of
his education were obtained at a common school in a rural district. At the age of sixteen
he commenced teaching a common school in Milford. His success led him to commence the
study of the ancient languages, with the design of pursuing a course of liberal culture. In

the summer of 1847 he entered Brown University, and graduated in 1851. He- ranked ﬁrst
in his class in mathematics, though history and metaphysics were his favorite studies. For
nearly a year after graduating he pursued a course of English and classical literature. In
the summer of 1852 he was tutor ‘in the family of Edgar Huidekoper, of Meadville, Pa. At
the end of a year. he accepted the principalship of the Meadville Academy. Here he organ-
ized, in 1853, a teachers’ class, before which he delivered a course of lectures on the theory
and practice of teaching, which course was continued until 1857. 7

In 1857 Mr. Bates was chosen superintendent for Crawford County. By a thorough exami-
nation of teachers, a system of school visitation, and a practical course of instruction in the
Teachers’ Institutes, he infused new life into the three or four hundred schools which
came under his charge, and by his labors in institutes in neighboring counties, assisted
materially in establishing the popularity and usefulness of these meetings.

In 1860 Mr. Bates accepted the office of Deputy State Superintendent. The degree of
LL.D. was conferred by Westminster College in 1865. i

In 1865 he was tendered the position of Vice-President of St. John‘s College, Annapolis,
Md., but accepted, instead, that of State Historian, tendered him by Gov. Curtin.

The following is a list of his book publications: History of Pennsylvania Volunteers, 5
vols., super royal octave; History of Pennsylvania in the late War, with Sketches of Oﬂicers ;
History and Present Condition of Colleges in Pennsylvania; History of State Teachers’
Association, and Sketch of Education in Pennsylvania, royal octavo; Exposition of School
Laws in Pennsylvania, 8vo; Institute Lectures, 8vo; Method of Teachers’ Institutes, 8vo;
The Battle of Gettysburg; Martial Deeds of Pennsylvania.

JOSIAH R. SYPHER, 1832 —, is descended from a German family that emigrated to Penn-
sylvania early in the eighteenth century, and settled in the valley of the Susquehanna. He
was born on the homestead of his ancestors, in Perry County. He prepared for college in
the Alford Academy of Western New York, and graduated at Union College in the class of
1858. After leaving college he made a tour of the United States, travelling through all the
States east of the Rocky Mountains. He entered the law oﬂice of Hon’. Thaddeus Stevens,
and was admitted to the bar at Lancaster, Pa., in 1862. During the time he was studying
his profession he was associate editor of the Lancaster Express, at daily and weekly news-

. paper. His articles and letters when travelling, contributed to the Express, attracted the

attention of the publisher and editor of the New York Tribune, and in the summer of 1862
he was engaged as a war correspondent of that paper. In this capacity he was during a
very important period of the war in charge of the correspondence in the Army of the Poto-
mac. In the spring of 1864 he withdrew from the ﬁeld to Washington and served the Tri-
bune there until the winter of 1865, when he became a co-editor of the Tribune and removed
to New York. In 1867 he removed to Philadelphia to establish the Tribune oflice in that
city, and remained in charge of the Tribune’s business there until he resigned in October,
1870, to establish and manage a new paper, The Pennsylvania State Journal, at Harrisburg.
Mr. Sypher and the proprietors of the paper not agreeing as to the policy of exposing certain
political frauds, he left the paper at the end of six months, and returned to the practice of
his profession in Philadelphia.

In the midst of this active life, Mr. Sypher found time to perform no inconsiderable
amount of literary work outside of his regular duties. In 1864: he wrote the History of the
Pennsylvania Reserve Corps, a volume of over 700 octavo pages. He was from his boyhood
an earnest and eﬁicient advocate of public education, and contributed greatly by his labors

to the building up and expanding of the common-school system in his native State. -In 1868
he wrote A History of Pennsylvania, designed for a school-book; and in 1869, in connection
with Ellis A. Apgar, he wrote a similar History of New Jersey. In 1870 he compiled The
American Popular Speaker, and The Young American Speaker. He is now engaged in
writing a History of the United States, which will be published in one large octavo volume.
Mr. Sypher has also contributed many articles‘ over his own signature to the Pennsylvania
School Journal and the National Temperance Advocate, and anonymously to other publi-

cations. He writes in a terse, clear, and forcible style, and is a ﬂuent and graceful speaker.

JOHN JACOB ANDERSON, A. l\I., 1821 , was born in the city of New York, and received
the rudiments of his education in the public schools there. After being prepared for college,
he changed his plan and accepted a position as teacher. His career as an educator covers
a period of more than a quarter of a century, twenty years of which he was at the head of
one of the large public schools of the city of New York. , -

He is the author of several works for schools and colleges, all of them in the direction of
history. They are prepared with great care, and have been received with remarkable favor.

Mr. Anderson received the honorary degree of A. M. from Rutgers College.

The following is a list of his works: Introductory School History of the United States;
Common School History of the United States; Grammar School History of the United
States; Pictorial School History of the United States; A Manual of General History; A
School History of England ; The Historical Reader; The United States Reader.

IX. VVRITERS ON POLITICS AND POLITICAL ECONOMY.

Henry C. Carey.

 

HENRY CHARLES CAREY, 1793 , is the ablest, as Well as the most
voluminous, writer that We have on the subject of political economy. He
is an earnest advocate of a protective tariff, and has devoted his energies to
this cause with unﬂagging zeal for nearly forty years.

Mr. Carey is son of Matthew Carey, and a successor to him in the book business. Mr. Carey
retired from business in 1836, since which time he has devoted his leisure to writing on his
favorite theme, political economy. His writings, which have been numerous, have been in
advocacy of views on that subject, original with himself, and in advance of all that has been
produced by European writers. He is regarded, by those competent to judge, the highest
living authority in that ﬁeld of inquiry. His principal works are the following : The Prin-
ciples of Political Economy; Essay on the Rate of Wages; The Credit System in France,
Great Britain, and the United States; The Past, The Present, and the Future; The Harmony
of Interests, Agricultural, Manufacturing, and Commercial ; The Principles of Social Science;
The Slave-Trade; Letters 011- the Currency; Letters on International Copyright, etc, etc.
“One of the strongest and most original writers of the age.” —-Westimhster Rem'ew. “Mr.
Carey has clearly substantiated his claim to be the leading writer now devoted to the study
of political econoniy.”—]V. ’o7-/c Qucmfm-lg. His writings have been translated into most
of the languages of Europe, and have been made the basis of instruction in many of the
foreign universities.

FURMAN SHEPPARD, 1823 ——-—, an eminent lawyer of Philadelphia, was born in Cumberland
County, N. J. He has written The Constitutional Text-Book; The First Book of the Con-
stitution; and some law books.

EDWARD JOY MORRIS, 1817 , is a native of Phil-adelpliia, and a graduate of Harvard,
1836. He was a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature, and afterwards of the National
Congress. He has spent most time abroad, and in 1861 was sent as United States ambas-
sador to Turkey. He has given much time to literature. His chief publications are the fol-
lowing: Notes of a Tour through Turkey, Germany,Greece, Egypt, Arabia Petrtea, etc.; The
'1‘urkish.Empire, its History, Political and Religious, Conditions, Manners. Customs, etc,
translated from the German; Afraja, or Life and Love in Norway, translated from the Ger-
man; Corsica, Social and Political, translated from the German, etc.

J AMES WATSON WEBB, 1802 ———, was born at Claverack, N. Y. He was an oﬂ‘icer in the
United States Army from 1819 to 1827, and he is generally called “ Col. Webb.” As editor
of the New York Courier and Inquirer, from 1827 to 1861, a period of thirty—four years, he
became widely known. Until the rise of the Herald, Tribune, and other papers of that class,
the Courier and Inquirer was the leadingpaper in New York, probably in the United States,
and wielded a large inﬂuence. Besides his paper, Col. Webb published Slavery and its Ten-
dencies; Altowan, or Incidents of Life and Adventures in the Rocky Mountains. He was
appointed Minister to Brazil in 1861, and returned in 1870.

CHARLES FRANCIS ADAMS, 1807 , son of John Quincy Adams, and graduate of Harvard.
Mr. Adams took a conspicuous part in our foreign diplomacy during the late war, being the
American minister in London at that time, and conducting the correspondence with the British
Government during several very critical years. 'In addition to his labors as a diplomatist,
he has done good service to the cause-of letters by editing The Letters of Mrs. Abigail Ad~
ams, The Life and Works of John Adams, 10 vols.; and Letters of John Adams to his Wife,
2 vols. All these important works have been executed in a manner that has given universal
satisfaction. It is understood that he is preparing in like manner a complete edition of the
works of his father, John Quincy Adams.

Charles Sumner.

CHARLES SUMNER, LL. D., 1811-1874, for many years a leading senator
of the United States, Was distinguished as a political orator. His Orations,
chieﬂy on political topics, ﬁll eight large volumes.

Mr. Sumner was a native of Boston. After passing through the Boston Latin School and

»Harvard University, 1830, he became a pupil of Judge Story in the Law School, and reporter

for the judge in that circuit. From 1837 to 1840 he travelled extensively in Europe. In
1845 he attracted public attention by his celebrated oration on The True Grandeur of Na-
tions. This was the era of the troubles between the United States and Mexico in relation to
Texas, and Sumner’s speech was an argument in favor of peace. From this time Sumner
devoted himself exclusively to politics.

In 1851, he succeeded Daniel Webster as senator from Massachusetts, a position which he
retained till his death. Mr. Sumner soon distinguished himself as an earnest and fearless
opponent of the growing power of the pro-slavery party. In May, 1856, he made his cele-
brated speech‘ on Kansas. Some remarks, bearing rather severely on Senator Butler of
South Carolina, gave offence to Butler’s nephew, Preston S. Brooks, then representative
from that State. Mr. Brooks’s assault upon Sumner in the Senate Chamber, the lat-
ter’s disablement for public service, Brooks’s expulsion from the House and subsequent
re-election, the projected duel between Brooks and Burlingame, are all too well known to
call for repetition here. Sumner himself left the country to travel in Europe in quest of
health. In 1857, on the expiration of his term, he was re-elected by the State Legislature
‘by an almost unanimous vote. His health was not sufﬁciently restored, however, until the

46* 2K

546 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

end of 1859, so that his seat remained unoccupied for three years. “The eloquent vacant
chair ” became proverbial.

In 1860, not long after his return, Sumner delivered his speech, even more bitter and un~~
sparing, on “The Barbarism of Slavery.” But the times had changed. The contest was
coming rapidly to an issue, and evidently would have to be fought out with other weapons
than speeches and canes.

Sumner was active in procuring the election of Lincoln and unwavering in support of the
war. He was the author of many of the most important war and reconstruction measures,
among them the Freedmen’s Bureau Bill. In 1861 he was appointed Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, and retained that important office during the war and up to
1871, when he took issue with President Grant on the San Domingo expedition.

Mr. Sumner was for years the acknowledged leader of the Republican party in the United
States Senate. The energy of his character and the prestige of his learning and eloquence
were largely instrumental in making that party what it was. He was regarded not merely
as Webster’s successor, but as the man upon whom the largest share ofWebster’s mantle
had fallen; and whenever he was announced to deliver a great speech, the galleries and
ﬂoor of the Senate chamber were thronged as they had been in the days of Clay, Webster,
and Calhoun.

Great as Mr. Sumner’s abilities undoubtedly were, it may be questionedwhether a good
share of his reputation was not due to circumstances, whether the senator would have risen
to the first rank but for his temporary martyrdom. His speeches, which have been col-
lected and published, in 1870, in 8 vols., evince great learning and great ﬁdelity in collecting
authorities. Their style is elegant to a fault. But they do not abound in s_ucl1 brilliant,
stirring eloquence as Webster’s, they do not reveal the same depth and grasp of intellect.
But whatever be their defects, they will still remain as a model of good English, nor will it
ever be forgotten by posterity that the orator’s voice was not silent in times when it cost
something to be brave and free of speech.

GEORGE SUMNER, 1817-1863, was a. younger brother of the senator, and, like him, born in
Boston. George Sumner’s education was prosecuted abroad. He resided abroad for many
years, travelling in Europe, Asia, and Africa. His special study was that of international
law and a comparison of the. laws and institutions of different countries. His ability and
research were well known in Europe, better known, in fact, than in his native country. He
was associated with Dr. S. G. Howe, of Boston, in establishing in America the ﬁrst schools
for the training of idiots. He. is the author of numerous contributions scattered over the
pages of The North American Review, Democratic Review, and many German and French
periodicals. In 1845 he published an address delivered at Cambridge entitled Memoirs of
the Pilgrims at Leyden, and, in 1847, a pamphlet on the successful introduction of the
Pennsylvania system of prison discipline into Europe. In the course of the winter of
1860-61, he delivered a course of lecturesin the principal cities of the United States.

Wendell Phillips.

 

WENDELL PHILLIPS, 1811 , has figured largely as an orator, ﬁrst
as an anti—slavery advocate, and since the war as an advocate of labor
reform, and women’s rights. He has also a high reputation as a public
lecturer on topics connected with literature and art.

Mr. Phillips is a native of Boston, and a graduate of Harvard, 1831. He studied law and
was admitted to the bar, but declined practising, because it obliged him as an attorney to
swear to support the Constitution of the United States, which was incompatible with his
extreme anti-slavery views. -

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 53471

Wendell Phillips’s fame is that of an orator rather than that of a writer. At least, his
speeches, able as they are, owe much of their force to his wonderful delivery. As a speaker,
he occupies the very ﬁrst rank. Many judges, indeed, rank him above all other American
orators in voice, delivery, personal magnetism, and all that constitutes the power of a public
speaker. Certainly no one has had more need of his oratorical gifts. Year after year did
he toil on in the cause of emancipation, in the face of unpopularity, abuse, personal vio-
lence, and threats of assassination, yet rarely, if ever, has he failed to hold even the most
anti pathetic audience spell-bound by the charm of his eloquence.

Of late years he has degenerated, it must be confessed, into the ungracious role of a con-
ﬁrmed grumbler. When negro slavery was formally abolished, his occupation, like Othello’s,
was gone, and there was nothing ﬂagrant for him to attack. Yet he appears from time to
time denouncing unsparingly political measures and political men, and alienating from
himself his warmest friends and admirers by his reckless transgression of the bounds of
practical sense. A

It is difficult to express any opinion as to the comparative merits of his numerous speeches.
Perhaps the most famous was_ the one delivered in Faneuil Hall, 1837, at a meeting called to
protest against the murder of Lovejoy in Illinois. Phillips was then only twenty-six years
old. Dr. Channing pronounced the oration “morally sublime.” Besides his Orations, pub-
lished in 1863, he has contributed various articles to the anti-slavery and temperance
journals.

Charles Lanman.

CHARLES LANMAN, 1819 ,has written largely on political and other
topics, his most elaborate Work being a Dictionary of Congress, a very use-
ful book of reference, published by authority of the general government.

Mr. Lanman was born in Monroe, Mich. He received an academical education at Plain-
ﬁeld, Conn.; was a clerk in the famous Indian house of Suydam, Jackson & Co., New York,
from 1835 to 1845, when he revisited his birth-place, and for a few months edited the Monroe
Gazette. In 1846 he became associate editor of the Cincinnati Chronicle; and, after making
a canoe tour up the Mississippi river and through Lake Superior, he returned to New York,
and was associated as a writer with the Daily Express. In 1848 he visited Washington, and
became a writer and travelling correspondent of the National Intelligencer; and while
residing in Georgetown, D. C., continued in the service of that journal, until the death of its
editors, Gales and Seaton.

As an amateur, he paid some attention to landscape painting; was elected an Associate
of _ the National Academy of Design; and he inaugurated the custom, in the New York Ex-
press,'of printing elaborate criticism on art. During his connection with the Intelligencer
he made an annual tour among the wilds of the United States and Canada, for the triple
purpose of hunting the picturesque, gratifying his love of angling, and describing his
adventures.

In 1849 he was appointed Librarian of the War Department, and as such, under President
Fillmore, organized the library in the Executive Mansion; was subsequently appointed
Librarian of Copyrights in the State Department, and Private Secretary of Daniel Webster;
Librarian of the Interior Department; Librarian of the House of Representatives ; and lastly,
was placed in charge of the Returns Oﬂice in the Interior Department.

Besides writing for periodicals at home, he became, in 1857, the American Correspondent
of the Illustrated London News, in which he published many illustrations of American
scenery,.and in 1869 he corresponded for the London Athenaeum. He also furnished Apple-
ton’s Journal with a series of Sketches of American Scenery.

In 1871 he was engaged by the Japanese Government to write a work on Social Life in
America, to be translated by the Resident Minister for publication in Japan; and on sub-

548

Initting his design and the ﬁrst chapter of the work, was invited to become the American
Secretary of the Japanese Legation at Washington, which position he accepted.

Mr. Lanman has published the following volumes: Essays for Summer Hours; A Summer
in the VVilderness; A Tour to the River Saguenay, republished in England; Letters from the
Alleghany Mountains; Occasional Records of a Tourist; Private Life of Daniel Webster,
republished in England; A Tour to the River Restigouche, and a Winter in the South;
Adventures in the Wilds of America; Life of William Woodbridge; the Red Book of L\1ichigan.

It is understood that his uncollected essays will hereafter be published in several volumes,

AMERICAN LI'l‘ERA'l‘URE.

under the titles of Novelties of American Character; Essays of An Angler; Imaginary Let-
ters; and Hap-Hazard Papers. '

Washington Irving designated Mr. Lanman as “the Picturesque Explorer of the Country ; ”
Charles Dickens saidof his writings that their charm was their Tealness, and that he observed
accurately, and ‘described with spirit and intelligence; William Jerdan said that he was one
of the most pleasant sketchers who had followed in the footsteps of The Sketch Book; the
North American Review, that his letters have many graphic touches which show the artist-
eye of their ingenious author, and also that at times a striking poetical expression ﬂashes
out, illuminating the page like a gleam of light; the London Athenaeum, that he painted the
wilderness with vivid colors, but rendered, at the same time, express homage to civilization.

The pictures painted by Mr. Lanman number several hundred, and all of them are illus-
trations of American scenery. 8

Alexander H. Stephens.

ALEXANDER HAMILTON STEPHENS, 1812 , of Georgia, Was Vice-
President of the late Confederacy, and one of its ablest and most persistent
advocates. As a political Writer, Mr. Stephens has always commanded
respect, even from those most opposed to his views. '

Mr. Stephens was born in Taliaferro County, Ga., and graduated at l§‘ranklin College, in
Athens, of the same State, in the class of 1832.
In 1836, he entered political life, being elected to the State Legislature, and from that time
onward his attention has been almost exclusively given to public affairs. He was elected to
Congress in 1843, and tookat once an active part in national questions, until the outbreak
of the Civil War in 1861, when he joined his fortunes to the Southern Confederacy and
became its Vice-President. Mr. Stephens has occupied his leisure, since the downfall of the
Confederacy, in writing its story: A Ilistory of the War between the States, Tracing its
Origin, Causes, and Results, A Constitutional View of the Late War between the States.

He studied law and had a lucrative practice.

   

GEORGE FITZHUGII, , a prominent lawyer of Richmond, has written two remark-
able works on social science : Sociology for the South, or the Failure of Free Society, 1854;
and Cannibals All, or Slaves without Masters. “Sociology is a unique book, sagacious,
but eccentric and discursive, bold and novel, and in an eminent degree suggestive. It is
extremist, but full of original and living thought, — no rehash of former speculations.” —J.
Wood Dcmiclsrm. Mr. Fitzliugli claims that slavery is the natural and rightful condition of
society, and that any system of society not based upon slavery tends to cannibalism. He
does not base his argument upon the inferiority of blacks, but thinks that the laboring
classes of mankind, irrespective of color, should be slaves.

HENRY MIDDLETON, 1797 ——, though born in Paris, is a Charlestonian, son of the late
Governor Middleton, of South Carolina. Henry was educated at West Point, graduating in
1815. He continued his studies afterward in Edinburgh, and was admitted to the bar in
Charleston in 1822, but never practised. He has published the following works: The

Government and the Currency; Economical Causes of Slavery in the United States; The
Government of India, as it Has Been, as it Is, and as it ought to Be; Universal Suffrage.

WILLIAM H. TRESCOTT, l823 , of Charleston, S. C., has made several valuable contribu-=
tions to political history: Diplomacy of the Revolution; Letters on the Diplomatic System
of the United States ; Diplomatic History of the Administration of Washington.

Hinton Rowan Helper.

HINTON ROWAN HELPER, 1829 ———, of North Carolina, acquired a
painful notoriety, before and during the war, by the publication of a book,
called The Impending Crisis of the South, of which more than 140,000
copies were sold. 0

Mr. Helper was born and educated in Rowan County, N. C. His education was limited to
the English branches. In 1851, he went to California by way of Cape llorn, and spent nearly
three years on the Paciﬁc coast, and on his return in 1855 published an account of his
Travels, The Land of Gold. In 1857, he published the work which gave him such notoriety,
The Impending Crisis. In 1861, he was appointed United States Consul to Buenos Ayres,
where, in 1863, he married a Spanish lady, Maria Louisa. Rodriguez, who had been educated
in one of the French-English schools in New York city. In 1867, he resigned his position
and returned home, settling in Asheville, N. C., where he now lives. _

In 1867, Mr. Helper published his third book, Nojoque, a Question for a Continent. The
object of this book was to correct the impression derived from the Impending Crisis, that he
was the friend of the negro. He wishes the world to know that, in Writing against slavery
and slaveholders, he had not written in the interest of the negro race. On the contrary, he
wishes them exterminated. “ Were I to state here, frankly and categorically, that the
primary object of this work is to write the negro out of America, and that the secondary
object is to write him (and manifold millions of other blacks and bi-colored caititfs little
better than himself) out of existence, God’s simple truth would be told.”—— Preface.

In 1868, Mr. Helper published another work in the same vein, The Negroes in N egroland,
the Negroes in America, and Negroes Generally.

Mr. Helper writes with a reckless vigor that insures him readers, though it gives one little
conﬁdence in his opinions. “His views are iconoclastic and his spirit destructive. He
praises and blames without reserve, and without measure. He treads upon ‘toes without
begging pardon. There is, however, a manliness in this outspoken and fearless advocacy,
that entitles the advocate to a measure of respect, even from those who take issue with
every position he ﬁghts for.” —J. Wood Dcw'idso72.

X. SCIENTIFIC WRITERS.
Agassiz.

LOUIS J01-IN RUDOLPH Aeassrz, 1807-1873, though pre-eminent as a
scientist, has not thought it beneath his aim to use the arts of rhetoric in
commending his favorite studies to the attention of unlearned readers. Few
even of our professed literary men excel him in the matter of writing good
English.

Prof. Agassiz was born in Switzerland, and studied at various European universities. He

having placed him in this respect among the foremost men of all time. His publications are
exceedingly numerous, and among them are several of a popular cast, written in the purest
English, and giving him a legitimate and honorable place in the department of literature.
He came to the United States in 1846, and soon after was appointed Professor of Zoology and
Geology in the Lawrence Scientiﬁc School, in Cambridge, Mass., a position which he held
until his death. So far as he has a place in letters, it is as an American, most of his
scientiﬁc and nearly all his literary activity having been put forth in this, the land of his
adoption. His contributions to the Atlantic Monthly, afterwards reprinted in a volume
under the title of Methods of Study in Natural History, are, in mere attractions of style and
language, as fascinating as a work of romance. The same may be said of his volume on
The Structure of Animal Life, being a course of lectures delivered before the Brooklyn Insti-
tute, to illustrate the power, wisdom, and goodness of God, as manifested in his works.

Cruyot.

ARNOLD GUYOT, Ph.D., LL. D., 1807 , who is considered the fore-
most man in the United States in the department of Physical Geography,
has given some of the results of his inquiries in an interesting and popular
Volume, called Earth and Man, which has passed through many editions.

Prof. Guyot is also the author of a large number oflelaborate Wall Maps of Physical
Geography, and of a series of admirable Common School Geographies.

Prof. Guyot was born near Neufchatel, Switzerland, and graduated at the University of
Berlin. His investigations into the geology ot' the Alps were published in Paris in 1848. He
was Professor of Physical Geography in Neufchatel from l839 to l848. Political disturb-
ances caused him to emigrate to the United States. lie delivered courses of scientiﬁc
lectures in Boston and other places, for several years, and in 1854 became Professor of
Geology and'Physica1 Geography in Princeton College, which position he still holds.

ISAAC LEA, LL. D., 1792 -——, is a native of Wilmin;_;ton. Del, but has spent nearly all his

life in Philadelphia. He married a daughter of the celebrated publisher and writer, Matthew
Carey, and in 1821 became a partner of Mr. Carey’s, and retired from it in 1851 and devoted
his time to natural history pursuits. In 1859, he was elected President of the Academy of
Natural Sciences, of Philadelphia. '

Mr. Lea, like Grote the English banker and historian, is an instance in proof that a man
of business need not be out off from the cultivation of letters or of science. During all the
time that Mr. Lea, by a zealous and methodical attention to. business, was accumulating a.

fortune, he maintained his hours of private study, and rose by degrees to be one of the most A

eminent naturalists in the country. Ilis contributions to natural science, beginning as far
back as 1818, and continuing in almost unbroken series down to the present time, and
amounting to more than one hundred and ﬁfty, are found mainlyrin the Transactions of the
American Philosophical Society, and of the Academy of Natural Sciences, of Philadelphia, and

in _Silliman’s Journal. His principal work, Observations on the Family Unionidee, Melanidze,

etc., consists of 1'2. vo1s., 4to, with illustrations of nearly 1500 new species. He is now on-
gaged on the 13th vol. His Contribut-ion_s to Geology has 228 new fossil species. The fourth
edition of his Synopsis of the Family Unionidze, in lto, is a most laborious work, and gives a
history of the whole subject from the time of Pliny to the present period. '

Besides these purely scientiﬁc works, Mr. Lea has published several essays of a more popu-
lar character. Among these, the following may be named: 011 the Pleasure and Adva.nta;_j;e
of Studying Natural History; A Sketch of the History of Mineralogy; An Essay on the
Northwest Passage; On Hibernation, etc.

SAMUEL D. GROSS, LL.D., 1805 —-—, is a native of Pennsylvania, born near Easton. He
has been for many years Professor of Surgery in the Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia,
Besides numerous works of a strictly professional character, he has published An American
Medical Biography, suited to general reading.

ALEXANDER WINoHELL,,LL. D., 1824 ' , President of the Methodist. University at Syra-
cuse, and la.tely Professor of Geology, etc., in’ the University of Michigan, was born in
Dutchess County, N. Y., and graduated at the Wesleyan University, Middletown, Conn., in
the class of 1847. He has published Sketches of Creation, :1. popular view of some of the
grand conclusions of the sciences in reference to the history of matter and life, together
with a statement of the primeval condition and the ultimate destiny of the earth and the
solar system; also several important Reports in regard to the Geology of Michigan.

DP. Dickson.

SAMUEL HENRY DIcKsoN, M. D., 1798-1872, combined in a high degree
literary tastes and culture with eminence in a scientiﬁc profession. His
contributions to popular literature, though not large,.were yet considerable
in amount, and were uniformly of a high order.

Dr. Dickson was a native of Charleston, S. C., and a graduate of the University of Penn-
sylvania. He was Professor, ﬁrst in the Medical Department of the University of New York,
then in the Medical College of South Carolina, and from 1858 to the time of his death, in the

Jefferson ‘Medical College of Philaclelphia. Besides his strictly professional works, which 8

are in high repute, he wrote on literary and current topics, and on several of those subjects
which are on the border-land between the public domain and the domain of pure science.
The following are the chief: Essays on Life, Sleep, Pain, etc.; On the Correlation of Forces ;
On Memory; On Pleasure; Essays on Slavery; Orations and Addresses; The ]Esthetics of
Suicide; Elements of Medicine, etc. ' 4

Dr. Dickson cultivated polite letters far more than is customary with gentlemen of the
medical profession. Few, among those who have devoted themselves exclusively to a liter-
ary life, are so well read in English literature; few hold a more facile or graceful pen. “Dr.
Dickson is one of the most classically elegant writers upon medical sciences in the United
States. He ranks with Chapman and Oliver Wendell Holmes in the grace of his periods, as
well as in the thoroughness of his learning, and the exactness and acuteness of his logic.
Like Holmes, too, he is a poet, and generally a very accomplished lz‘terateur.” — Inte7‘natz'onal
Magazine.

JOHN W. DRAPER, M. D., 1811 , is a native of England, but a resident of the United
States. He graduated at the University of Pennsylvania, and became Professor of Chemistry
in the University of New York. Works: Text-Book on Chemistry; Natural Philosophy;
Human Physiology; History of thelntellectual Condition of Europe; The Future Civil
Policy of America; History of the American Civil War. He has also contributed _to the
journals of science. Dr. Draper’s works are considered of the highest authority on the
several subjects of which he has treated.

ASA GRAY, M D., 1820 -——, the distinguished Professor of Natural llistory at Cambridge,
was born at Paris, Oneida County, N. Y. He has devoted himself almost exclusively to the
science of botany, and while pursuing original investigations, interesting only to men of
science, has not neglected the wants of the common mind. His series of elementary text~
books are of the highest value, and connect him to some extent with popular literature.
The following are the publications named in this connection: How Plants Grow; Lessons
in Botany; Manual of Botany, etc.

‘JAMES DWIGHT DANA, LL. D., 1813, Professor of Geology and Natural History in Yale Col-
lege, was born in Utica, N. Y. He graduated at Yale in 1833, became Assistant Professor in
1836, and succeeded Professor Silliman in 1855. lie was Mineralogist and Geologist to the
United States Exploring Expedition under Wilkes, in 1838, and superintended the scientiﬁc
portion of the reports, ﬁlling four large 4to vols. His contributions to science, which have
been numerous, have been published for the most part in the American Journal of Science
and Arts, of which he is the editor. He has published two works, which have been exten-
sively used as text-books: A Manual of Mineralogy, and A Treatise on Mineralogy.

RAPHAEL PUMPELLY, 1837 ——-,Professor of Mining lngineering in Harvard University,
was born a.t Owego, N. Y. He studied seven years in Europe, viz., three years at the Royal
Mining Academy at Freiburg, Saxony, and_ the rest at Hanover and Paris. In 1860 he began
a journey around the world across the continents of North America, Asia, and Europe,
which Occupied ﬁve years. The ﬁrst year was spent in Arizona and Northern Mexico and
California. Thence he went to Japan, under commission from the Emperor to examine the
island of Yesso, and remained there one and a half years. He then passed one and a half
years in studying the geology of the interior of China and Central Asia, a part of the time
under commission from the Emperor of China. He was thus enabled, among other things,to
be the ﬁrst to bring to the knowledge of the world the fact that China is second to no other
country, except perhaps the United States, in the extent and quality of her vast coal-ﬁelds.
From China he returned through Tartary, Siberia, and Europe, to America.

He was elected Professor of Mining Engineering in Harvard University in 1866, which
chair he still holds. '

He undertook the State Geological Survey of the Copper Districts of Lake Superior in
1870, and was appointed in 1871 Director of the Geological Survey of Missouri.

The following are his two principal publications: Geological Researches in China, Mon-
golia, and Japan, illustrated. Alto; Across America and Asia, Notes ofa Five Years’ Journey
around the World and of Residence in Arizona, Japan, and China, illustrated.

He has contributed several editorials on Asiatic subjects to The Nation; also several
articles of a popular character to the magazines, besides numerous papers to scientiﬁc
journals.

Com. Maury.

MATTHEW FQNTAINE MAURY, LL.D., 1806-1873, an eminent physi-
cist, is known throughout the civilized world by his Wind and Current
Charts, and his Physical Geography of the Sea.

Com. Maury was born in Spottsylvania County, Va. He moved in 1810 to Tennessee;
entered the naval service of the United States in 1825. After ﬁfteen years of active service,
meeting with an accident which disabled him from duty aﬂoat, he was stationed at Wash-
ington and put in charge of the books, charts, and instruments collected by the government.
This depot became in time the Hydrographical Oﬂice, and afterwards was united with the
Naval Observatory, Maury being put in charge of the whole. _

In this position Maury achieved the great work of his life, a work brilliant as a contribu-
tion to science, and valuable beyond computation to the practical necessities of commerce.
He began this Work in 1842. He matured a system of uniform observations of winds, cur-
rents, and other meteorological phenomena at sea. Model log-books were distributed to
commanders of vessels, both in the naval and the merchant marine. System was enforced
in all entries of observations, and abstract returns were forwarded to the department. In nine
years two hundred large manuscript volumes were collected. In 1853, through his exertions,
a general Maritime Conference was held at Brussels, by whose recommendation other nations
were induced to adopt the system. The immense mass of observations thus collected were

FROM 1850 TO THE rnnssrvr 'l‘l)»iii. 553

reduced, and the results formulated into scientiﬁc propositions and practical sailing direc-
tion». The beneﬁts both to science and to commerce have been incalculable.

Com. M:u1r_y's publications have been the following : The Physical Geography of the Sea;
Wind and Current Charts; Sailing Directions ; A Series of School Geographies, consisting of
First Lessons in Geography, A Manual of Geography, and Physical Geography; A Treatise
on Navigation; Scraps from the Lucky Boy; and a large number of addresses and of con-
tributions to periodical literature. ~ ‘ '

When the war broke out, Mr. Maurygentered the service of the Confederacy. At the close
of the war he went to Mexico and took ofﬁce under the Emperor Maximilian. On the down-
fall of the empire he returned to the United States, and became in 1868 Professor in the
Virginia Military Institute, at Lexington.

EPHRAIM GEORGE SQUIER, 1821 ——, is a native of New York State. He began life as a
school-teacher and engineer, and edited several scientiﬁc journals. While living in Ohio his
attention was interested in the Indian remains in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. The
results of his explorations were published in 1818 by the Smithsonian Institution, under the
heading Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley. In 1849 appeared The Aboriginal
Monuments of the State of New York. Since that time Mr. Squier has explored on different
occasions Mexico and Central Asia, and also Peru, and published numerous important
works on the antiquities and physical aspects of those countries. Among these works are,
The Serpent Symbol, Nicaragua, Notes on Central America, Waikna, or Adventures on the
Mosquito Shores, etc. Besides these, Mr. Squier has made numerous contributions to the
magazines and to ethnological journals, and has delivered many lectures upon his travels.
He has also begun a Collection of Rare and Original Documents concerning the Discovery
and Conquest of America, and announced a work on Mexican Hieroglyphics. Mr. Squier
stands in the foremost rank of American travellers. The importance of his discoveries can
be estimated only by archaeologists and ethnologists. The style of his publications, how-
ever, is not so attractive. It is wanting in freshness and vigor.

JOHN BROCKELSBY, 1811 -——, Professor of Mathematics in Trinity College, Hartford, is the
author of several valuable school-books: Elements of Meteorology ; View of the Microscopic
World ; Elements of Astronomy; Common School Astronomy; Elements of Physiology.

WILLIAM JAMES ROLFE, 1827 , was born in Newburyport, Mass, and graduated at
Amherst, 1849. He taught Day’s Academy, V/‘Vrentham, Mass, from 1850 to 1852; was Head-
Master of Dorchester High School (Mass), from 1852 to 1856; of Lawrence High School
(Mass), from 1856 to 1860; of Salem High School (Mass), in 1861; and of Cambridge High
School from 1861 to 1868. Since that time he has been engaged in book-making and editing
(Boston Journal of Chemistry, etc.). He is still a resident of Cambridge, Mass.

The following are his publications: Handbook of Latin Poetry, edited in connection with
J. H. Ilanson; Cambridge Course of Physics (six volumes of Natural Philosophy, Chemis-
try, and Astronomy), edited in connection with J. A. Gillet; Craik’s English of Shakespeare,
edited, with additional notes, etc.; Editions of Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice, The
Tempest, Henry the Eighth, Julius Caesar. (The series to be continued.)

JOHN Jon>:sTo.\*. LL. D., 1806 ——-—, the veteran Professor of Nami-al Philosophy and‘bChen1

County, Me., and began life as a farmer. He graduated at Bowdoin in 1832, and after various
appointments elsewhere, became Professor in the Wesleyan University in 1835, which posi-
tion he has held ever since. Prof. Johnston, besides numerous articles in the scientiﬁc and
the religious journals, has published Elements of Natural Philosophy, and Elements of
Chemistry. He began by editing Turner’s Chemistry, but in the various revisions and addi-
tions, the work became substantially his own.

561 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

LE ROY C. COOLEY, Ph. D., 1833 , was born in the town of Lyme, Jefferson County, N. Y.
His father was a farmer, one of the early settlers of that town. Le Roy had in boyhood the
ordinary advantages of the common school and the more valuable inﬂuences of pious parents.
He began early to love books and study, rather than the implements and labor of the farm.
His parents, unable to help him pecuniarily to the higher education so much desired, bade
him, at the ageof sixteen years, go out into the world and get what he could. By teaching
school in winter he was able to attend the academy in summer. He entered the New York
State Normal School in the autumn of 1854, graduated in 1855, at the end of a single term,
or half year. He immediately began teaching Natural Science in the Lockport Union
School. While in that position, he was able. to pursue by himself his course of study, until
prepared for advanced standing in College. He graduated at Union in 1858, and was called
at once to the department of Mathematics in the Fairﬁeld Seminary, N. Y.; thence, in 1860,
to the department of Natural Sciences in Cooperstown Seminary, N. Y.; and thence, in 1861,
to his present position ——- the chair of Natural Sciences in the New York State Normal School,
at Albany. Prof. Cooley has been for several years a ruling elder in the First Presbyterian
Church of Albany. . 8

Besides contributions to the scientiﬁc journals, Prof. Cooley has published the following
works: Experiments in Physical Science; Elements of Natural Philosophy; Text-Book of
Natural Philosophy; Text-Book of Chemistry; Hand-Book of Apparatus and Experiments.

J. Dorrnan Steele.

PROF. J. DORMAN STEELE, A.M., Ph. D., 1836 , is one of the pro-
gressive men among onr younger class of teachers. He has acquired a high
reputation as a teacher, and his series of Short Courses in several of the
sciences are a marked feature among our latest school—book publications.

 

Prof. Steele was born at Lima, N. Y. He graduated at Genesee College in 1858. After
teaching natural science successfully in various schools, and an honorable service in McClel-
lan’s Peninsular campaign, he became, in 1866, Principal of the Free Academy, at Elmira,
N. Y., which position he still adorns. ,

Prof. Stee1e’s “ Short Courses” grew out of his own Wants in the class-room. The follow-
ing is the list: Fourteen Weeks in Natural Philosophy; dq. in Chemistry; do.in Astron-
omy; do. in Geology; do. in Physiology. .1

Prof. Steele is not a mere compiler; but writes out of the abundant fulncss of his own
mind. He can, too, when occasion calls for it, enliven the most abstrusen speculations with
the graces of rhetoric. Witness the following paragraphs on Force : '

“ Potential force is one that is concealed, lying in wait, and ready toburst forth on the
instant. It is the drop of Water with a thunderbolt hidden in its Womb. It is the loaded
gun in the hand of the marksman. It is the river trembling on the brink of the precipice,
about to take the fearful leap. It is the giant, the Farnese Hercules, leaning on his club,
passive but ready for action, every muscle relaxed, yet only Wanting the word of command.
It is storedup energy; the wheat in the granary waiting the sower; the coal in the mine
abiding the spark. It is the weight wound-up, full of potential power—the strong pull of
the cord, ready but not able to fall.

“ Dynamic force is not latent or concealed, but force in full view, in actual operation. The ‘

thunderbolt is launched, the bullet is ﬂying, the river is tumbling, the giant is striking, the
wheat is growing, the coal is blazing, and the weight is falling. It is heat radiating from
our ﬁres, electricity ﬂashing our messages across the continent, or gravity pulling bodies
headlong to the earth.”

SANBORN TENNEY, A. M., 1°27 —-——, Professor of -Natural History. in Williams College, Mass.,
Was born in Stoddard, N.H., and graduated at Amherst in 1853. Immediately after grad-

uation he became instructor in Natural History in the New England Naval Institution at
Lancaster, Mass. I-Ie afterwards studied under Agassiz, and in 1856 became Lecturer on
Natural History in the Massachusetts State Teachers’ Institutes, which position he held for
nine years. During this time he lectured on his department in many parts of New England
and in Pennsylvania. He was Professor at Vassar College from its organization to 1868. In
1868 he entered the position which he still holds, in Williams College. Professor Tenney
stands among the best writers of text-books on the subjects which he discusses. The
following are his works, all designed as text-books: Geology; Manual of Zoology; Natural
History of Animals, for beginners; Natural History Tablets; Elements of Zoology. Pro-
fessor Tenney is engaged to deliver before the Lowell Institute, in 1873, a course of lec-
tures on Physical Structure and Natural Resources. —-MRS. SANBORN TENNEY, —- ——-, wife
of the preceding, has written Pictures and Stories of Animals for the Little Ones at Home,
6 vols.

SIDNEY A. NQRTON, 1835 , Professor of Chemistry in the Miami Medical College, has
published Elements of Natural Philosophy, and has in preparation a text-book on Chemistry,
and a Manual of Physics. Prof. Norton was born in Bloomﬁeld, 0., and graduated at Union,
in 1856. He taught at various places, — Poughkeepsie, N. Y., and Hamilton, Cleveland, and
Cincinnati, 0., — before taking his present chair. He spent eighteen months in European
study, at Bonn, Leipsic, and Heidelberg.

J OHN C. DALTON, M.D., 1825 _——-, a native of Massachusetts, and a graduate of Harvard,
has distinguished himself as a physiologist. He has published a Treatise on Physiology and
Hygiene for schools, etc.

REV. HENRY J. OSBORN, , was born in Philadelphia, and graduated at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania. IIe pursued scientiﬁc studies at the Polytechnic School in London,
and also in Germany, and made a topographical and geological survey of the Iloly Land.
After preaching in various places, and being connected _as an instructor with various insti-
tutions, among them Lafayette College, at Easton, Pa., he became Professor of the Scientiﬁc
department in Miami University, 0. His published works are the following: Palestine,
Past and Present; Plants of the Holy Land; Little Pilgrims in the Holy Land; A‘ Large
Map of Palestine; The Metallurgy of Iron and Steel.

DAVID AQZVELLS, 1827 -——, was born in Springﬁeld, Mass. He graduated at Williams
College, in the class of 1847 ; ‘studied at the Lawrence Scientiﬁc School at Cambridge, and
afterwards, 1851-52, was Assistant Professor there. From 1866 to 1870, he was Special Com-
missioner of the Revenue, and in that capacity wrote several elaborate Reports. His other
publications are: Annual of Scientiﬁc Discovery, 16 vo.ls.; Familiar Science; Science of
Common Things; Elements of Natural Philosophy ; Principles of Chemistry; Principles of
Geology, ‘etc.

VVILLIAM H. WELLS, A. M.. 1812 ——, was born in Tolland, Conn. He was Principal of the
Putnam Free School, at. Newburyport, Mass., 1848-1854, and of the State Normal School,
Westﬁeld, Mass., 1854-1856, and Superintendent of the public schools ofChicago, 1856-1864.
His services in all these positions were highly esteemed, but the superior emoluments of a
business life called him away, in 1864, from a profession of which he was one of the highest
ornaments. The public authorities, in ﬁxing the rates of compensation for teachers, would
do well to remember that the profession is thus constantly losing the best and most desir-
able men from its ranks, because other walks of life are more remunerative. Mr. Wells is
the author of an excellent work on English Grammar, and of A Graded Course of Instruc-
tion for Public Schools.

BARNAS SEARS, D. D., 1802 , was born in Sandisﬁeld, Mass., and graduated in Brown
University in the class of 1825. He was successively Professor in the Hamilton Theological
Institution; and in the Theological Seminary at Newtown, Mass.; Secretary of the Massa-
chusetts Board of Education ; President of Brown University; and, in 1867, became General
Agent of the Peabody Educational Fund. He has written The Ciceronian, or the Prussian
Mode of Teaching Latin; Life of Martin Luther; and numerous educational reports, etc.
The work in which he is now engaged, as administrator of the Peabody Fund, is probably
the most important of his life, and one for which he has eminent qualiﬁcations.

 

EDWARD AUSTIN SHELDON, 1823 , known all over the land by his successful career as
Principal of the Training School for Teachers, at Oswego, N. Y., Was born in Perry, N. Y.,
and educated at Hamilton College. He was for three’ years Superintendent of Schools at
Syracuse. All the rest of his public life, since leaving college, has been spent in Oswego.
He has published A Manual of Elementary Instruction; Lessons on Objects ; and a series of
School Readers. .

 

D10 LEWIS, M. D., 1823 ———, has become noted by his publications on physical training
and on health. Dr. Lewis is of Welsh extraction. He was born in.Auburn, N. Y.; gradu-
ated at Harvard; and practised medicine at Buffalo, N. Y. Becoming dissatisﬁed with “pill
peddling,” he began about 1856 developing his new system of gymnastics. In 1860 he went
to Boston to establish the Normal Institute for Physical Education, obtained a charter, and
has continued ever since to train ladies and gentlemen in the art of gymnastics. In 1864
he established in Lexington a Young Ladies’ Seminary, which was remarkably successful
until 1867, when the building was burned. Dr. Lewis’s principal publications are the fol-
lowing: The New Gymnastics for l\Ien, Women, and Children; Weak Lungs and how to
make them Strong; Talks about People’s Stomachs; Our Girls, etc.

WILLIAM W. HALL, M. D., 1810-1876, was a native of Kentucky, and a graduate of Centre
College. He studied medicine at the Transylvania University, where he took his Doctor’s
degree in 1836. After practising medicine in the South for ﬁfteen years, he came to New
York, and in 1854 began the publication of Hall’s Journal of Health, a popular periodical,
which is still continued. He did much, both in the Journal and other works, to bring a
knowledge of the laws of health within the popular comprehension. His book on Health
and Good Living had a sale of 15,000 copies the ﬁrst year. A

 

. ELIHU BURRITT, 1811 , “the learned blacksmith,” was born in Connecticut. While

School, graduating in 1850 at the head of his class. He was Professor of Chemistry in the
Philadelphia College of Medicine in 1853-54, and entered the medical staﬁ“ of the navy in 1855.

HANNAH M. BOUVIER, 1811 --—, is a daughter of Judge Bouvier, and a native of Philadelphia.
She is the author of Familiar Astronomy, a work of a popular kind, yet the fruit of high
attainments in astronomy and embodying all the latest results of the science. The work is
commended by the highest astronomical authority in England and America.

Catherine E. Beecher.

CATHERINE ESTHEE BEECHER, 1800 , oldest child of Dr. Lyman
Beecher, has labored and written on a variety of subjects, and with signal
ability in each, but is best known probably by her Works on physical train-
ing, including physiology and calisthenics.

Miss Beecher was born at East Hampton, L. I. On the removal of the family to Litch-
ﬁeld, Conn., in 1810, she_was placed at school there, but she intimates that her “ schooling ”
did not amount to much. “My imagination was teeming with poetry and romance. I had
no taste for study or for anything that demanded close attention. All my acquisitions were
in the line of my tastes, so that at twenty no habits of mental discipline had been formed.”
Her ﬁrst serious discipline, according to_Mrs. Hale, was one that “ withdrew her heart from
the world of woman’s hopes.” “An event occurred that for ever ended all _Miss Beecher’s
youthful dreams of poetry and romance.” Since that time, she has directed her energies
entirely to the subject of education. At the age of twenty-two she opened a girls’ school in
Litchﬁeld, which was eminently successful. Afterwards, on the removal of her father to
Cincinnati, she superintended a seminary for young ladies in that city. She was for many
years engaged with EX-Governor Slade, of Vermont, in a scheme for introducing teachers at
the West. Her writings have been almost entirely in the line of her philanthropic efforts,
being direct ed chieﬂy to the education and the elevation of those of her own sex. Her pub-
lished works are the following: Domestic Service; Duty of American Women to their
Country; The True Remedy for the Wrongs of Women; Treatise on Domestic Economy;
Housekeeper’s Receipt Book; Letters to the People on Health and Happiness; Physiology
and Calisthenics; Truth Stranger than Fiction; Common Sense Applied to Religion; Reli-
gious Training of Children.

MISS ELIZABETH P. PEABODY, 1804 -~—, is celebrated for her writings on educational sub-
jects. She was born in Billerica, Mass., thevdaughter of Dr. N. Peabody. She spent her
earlier years at Salem, but since 1822 has resided chieﬂy at Boston. As a writer on educa-
tion, she is principally noted for her efforts to recommend, explain, and introduce Kinder-
garten schools. In connection with her sister, Mrs. Horace Mann, she has published Moral
Culture of Infancy, and Kinder'garten Guide. She has also written on the subject in the
educational journals. Among her other works are: Chronological History of the United
States, arranged with Plates, on Barr’s principle; First Steps to History; Key to the His-
tory of the Hebrews, and to Grecian History ; Records of a School; ‘and Dick Harbinger, the
Pioneer, etc. She has also translated several useful works: De Grerando’s Moral Self-Educa-
tion, Polish-American System of Chronology, etc.

ELIZABETH BLACKWELL, M. D., 1821 , is a native of England, but a resident of this coun-
try. She is the ﬁrst woman that has received the degree of Doctor of Medicine in the United
States. She afterwards studied midwiferyin the University of Paris. She has published
The Laws of Life, with special reference to the Education of Girls.

BENJAMIN GREENLEAF, 1786-1864, is known all over the land by his series of School Arith-
metics. Mr. Greenleaf was born in Haverhill, Mass., and graduated at Dartmouth, in 1813.
While in college he calculated and projected the Transit of Venus, which is to happen in
December, 1874, so early had he shown that fondness for mathematics which became the
ruling passion of his life. After graduation, he engaged at once in teaching, and was em-
ployed in various places, but the chief scene of his labors as a teacher was as Principal of the
Bradford Academy, Mass., from 1814 to 1836, and of the Bradford Teachers’ Seminary from 1839
to 1848. After that date he devoted his life to revising and completing his series of text-books.
He was noted for his piety and benevolence, for his practical wisdom, and for the singular
purity of his life. He was the idol of the many hundreds of scholars that were successively
under his control. His school-books are too well known to need more than an enumeration.
The following is the list: Primary Arithmetic, Elementary Arithmetic, Intellectual Arith-
metic, Practical Arithmetic, Common School Arithmetic, National Arithmetic, Elementary
Algebra, Higher Algebra, Elements of Geometry, Elements of Trigonometry, Geometry and
Trigonometry.

J AMES B. Donn, 1807 -—-, was Professor of Mathematics in Centenary College, Miss., and
afterwards in Transylvania University, Tenn. Prof. Dodd is the author of a popular series of
mathematical works: Elenientary and Practical Arithmetic; High School Arithmetic; Ele-
mentary and Practical Algebra ; Algebra for High Schools and Colleges ; Elements of Geom-
etry and Mensuration, etc. -

HORATIO N. ROBINSON, LL.D., 1806-1867, a self—taught mathematician, was born in Hart-
wick, Otsego County, N. Y. He is chieﬂy known by his mathematical school-books, forming
a complete series, over twenty in number, -from ﬁrst lessons in Primary Arithmetic up to
Analytical Geometry and the Differential and Integral Calculus. These books have been
received with general favor, and are very largely in use in schools and colleges.

A. SCHUYLER, A. M., 1828 , Professor of Applied Mathematics and Logic in Baldwin Uni-
versity, Berea, Ohio, is the author of a number of valuable text-books in mathematics. Prof.
Schuyler was born in Seneca County, N. Y., studied at the Seneca Academy, 0., and received
the honorary degree of A. M. from the Ohio Wesleyan University. He was for twelve years
Principal of Seneca County Academy, and since that has been Professor in Baldwin Univer-
sity. He has published, besides a pamphlet on the Immortality of the Soul, the following
works: Higher Arithmetic; AComplete Algebra; Logic; Trigonometry; Mensuration; Sur-
veying ; Navigation. He is preparing a work on Geometry.

Edward Brooks.

EDWARD BROOKS, A. M., 1831 , Principal of the State Normal
School at Millersville, Pa., has done an important service to the cause of

popular education by his valuable contributions to educational literature
in the extended series of mathematical text-books which he has put forth.

Prof. Brooks was born at Stony Point, on t-he Hudson, and lived there, attending the pub-
lic school when possible, until fifteen years of age, when he removed with his father to Sul-
livan County, N. Y. Here, having no opportunity to attend school, he learned a trade, but
soon abandoned it for more congenial employment. During all this time, spurred on by his
ambition and drawn by an insatiable desire for knowledge, he read and studied incessantly,
making for himself a school-room of ﬁeld and forest, of shop and ﬁreside, — of every place
to which duty or pleasure called him. Thus he not only obtained a mastery of the branches
he had begun in the common school, but pushed on to higher attainments, while he also
improved his taste and formed his style by an acquaintance with music and with the stand-
ard English authors. He wrote with considerable facility both prose and poetry; and ﬁnd-

ing the free use of the pencil an eﬂicient aid to the memory, he formed and has ever since
adhered to the habit of noting down and classifying every important fact or thought for im-
mediate or future use.

Prof. Brooks’s career as a teacher commenced with a singing-school, held in a barn. He
afterwards taught a common school at Cuddebackville, N. Y., for six months; then, after
an interval of more than a year, in which he attended a normal institute for one session, he
accompanied Prof. John F. Stoddard to Bethany, Pa., Where he taught for three years ; then
taught a year in the Academy at Monticello, N. Y.; and ﬁnally, in 1855, accepted a Profes-
sorship in the Normal School at Millersville, Pa., where he has ever since labored with dis-
tinguished success, and acquired an inﬂuence as an educator second to none in the State.

In 1866, on the resignation of Prof. J. P. Wickersham, Prof. Brooks was elected Principal
of the institution which he had contributed so powerfully to build up; and in this position
he has shown administrative and business abilities of a high order, combined with broad
and comprehensive views of the work of public education and of the adaptation of the normal
schools to that work. Here, amid his arduous labors as a teacher, he has composed the
works that have given him a place among American authors. They are, in fact, an out-
growth of those labors, being a successful attempt to present on paper the philosophical
methods of instruction employed by him in the class-room with such excellent results.

The works published by him to the present time are the following: An arithmetical series,
consisting of six books,—-a Primary, an Elementary (written), a Mental, and aWritten
Arithmetic, together with two Keys, Which, besides the solutions to the problems, contain
many valuable exercises and suggestions; Geometry, and Trigonometry, two Works bound
together or separately, as teachers may prefer; Elementary Algebra, the latest and probably
the best of the author’s Works.‘

The author contemplates the publication, at no very distant day, of several other works,
among which may be mentioned the following: Higher Arithmetic, Higher Algebra, and
the other books needed to complete his series of mathematical text-books; Philosophy of
Mathematics; A series of works on the Science of Education, including Mental Culture,
Moral Culture, and Methods of Teaching the Branches; and ﬁnally, Lectures on Education.

Prof. Brooks’s characteristics, as manifested in his writings and lectures, may be brieﬂy
stated thus: A reﬁned taste; a vivid imagination ; great logical acuteness, enabling him to
detect the truth or falsity of a proposition at a glance, and to trace causes and deduce results
With ease and certainty; a profound and pervading sense of moral obligation; and a style
Which, despite a tendency to indulge too much in epigrammatie and antithetic forms of ex-
pression, is clear, pure, strong, and eminently pleasing and attractive.

HON. E. E. WHITE, 1829 , President of the National Educational Association, and lately
Commissioner of Common Schools for the State of Ohio, was born in Mantua, 0. Without
the advantages of a full college education, he has worked his way up, by perseverance and
pluck, to his present distinguished position as one of our leading American educators. He
became Principal of a Cleveland Grammar School, in 1851; of the Cleveland High School, in
1854; Superintendent of Schools, Portsmouth, 0., 1856; Commissioner of Common Schgols
for Ohio, 1863-1866. He bought the Ohio Educational Monthly in 1861, and has conducted
it ever since, and has made it one of the best organs of public opinion in the cause of popular
education. He has published a Class-Book of Geography; a portion of Bryant & Stratton’s
Commercial Arithmetic; a Series of School Registers; and the Graded School Arithmetics.
The series last named is a work of uncommon excellence, and is admirably suited to the
wants of American common schools as now conducted.

JOSEPH RAY, M. D., 1807-1855, author of a well-known series of mathematical text-books,
was born in Ohio County, Va. His early life was not unlike that of many of the self-made
scholars of the West—-he. taught and Worked his way through College. In 1828, he

came to Cincinnati to study medicine, graduated, after a due course of study, at the Ohio.

Medical College, and soon entered the Commercial Hospital as a surgeon. His practice,
however, was brief. In 1831, he entered the preparatory department of Woodward College
as a. teacher, and, in 1834, was promoted to the position of Professor of Mathematics. In
1851, the College gave place to the present IIigl1-School, and he was elected Principal. He
presided over the school with signal success until his decease, in April, 1855. He was the
author of the Eclectic Series of Arithmetics, which has had such an enormous sale in the
West.

Prof. Whitney.

WILLIAM DWIGHT WHITNEY, Ph. D., LL.D., 1827 —, Professor of
Sanscrit and Modern Languages in Yale College, stands at the head of
American scholarship in the department of letters to which he has devoted

himself. Besides very learned disquisitions which hardly come within the

scope of ordinary readers, his Lectures on Language are a contribution at
once to original science and to popular literature, and are the best presenta-
tion of the subject yet made by any American writer.

Prof. Whitney was born at Northampton, Mass. He graduated at Williams, in 1845, a11d
afterwards studied at Berlin and Tiibingen in Germany. In 1854, he was appointed Pro-
fessor of Sanscrit and Modern Languages in Yale College, which position he still retains.

Prof. Whitney is the most accomplished Sanscrit scholar that America has produced. In
this line he is the author and editor of several works which place him on an equal footing
with the ripest European scholars. These works are the edition of the Atharva-Veda-Sanhita
(in which Professor Whitney was associated with R. Roth); an edition of Burgess’s Transla-
tion of the Surya-Sidhanta; an edition of the Atharva-Veda-Pratigakliya, with a translation
and notes.

Besides these larger Works, Professor Whitney has contributed many valuable articles to
the Journal of the American Oriental Society, the Bibliotheca Sacra, Weber_’s Indische
Studien, Kiihn’s Beitrage zur Vergleichenden Sprachforschung, etc. He has recently re-
ceived from the Royal Academy of Sciences in Berlin a prize for the Taittiriya Pratigziltliya,
with translation and notes.

In addition to these strictly scientiﬁc works, he is the author of a German Grammar,
which is probably the best yet published in America, and a German Reader, containing
notes, vocabularies, etc.

Professor Wl1itney’s most popular work is his Language and the Study of Language, a
collection of twelve lectures, or rather essays, on the general facts and principles of Compara-
tive Philology. It is the companion—piece to Max Miil1er’s Lectures on the Science of Lan-
guage, and is, upon the whole, decidedly its superior. It has not that easy, graceful style
which has contributed-so much to i‘vIiiller’s success in writing for the public. Whitney’s
diction is clear but involved, and not infrequently inelegant. It impresses the reader as
being the production of a scholar who is so absorbed in his recondite researches as to over-

look the signiﬁcance of expression. But in substance it is much sounder and safer in its

statements and inferences than Miiller’s work. It evinces clear insight and a vigorous gr: sp
of the entire rangelof the subject, Without the va'garie"s and the “padding” in which Miiller
occasionally indulges. The merits of VVhitney’s work are so great and so unquestionable,
that they have led to its adoption as a text-book in such of our colleges as pretend to give
instruction in comparative philology.

ginia. His publications have been mostly in the department of linguistics, and have been

of a scholarly, and at the same time of a popular character: Outlines of Comparative Phi-A

lology ; Studies in English, or Glimpses into the Inner Life of our Language; Grammar of
the Spanish Language ; Stray Leaves from the Book of Nature; Wonders of the Deep ; Ameri-
canisms, or The English of the New World.

UORATIO HALE, 1817 —-—-, son of the well-known authoress, Mrs. Sarah J. Hale, was born
at Newport, R. 1. He graduated at Harvard in 1837; was admitted to the bar in Chicago in
185.‘); he resides at present in Clinton, Ontario, Canada. He has written numerous articles
for the periodicals, but his only contribution to letters worthy of special commendation was
that growing out of his connection with Wilkes’s Exploring Expedition. Mr. Hale was
appointed by the Governnient as the Philologist of the Expedition, and in this capacity he
made himself acquainted with a large number of the languages and dialects of the islands
of Polynesia. His published report, ﬁlling the seventh volume of that work, a huge im-
perial 4to, contains an immense mass of linguistic knowledge, carefully sifted and digested,
and in all respects a model for such a work. It is held in great repute among the learned

in both continents, and has received the very highest encomiums from eminent sources.

FRANCIS ANDREW MARCH, LL. D., 1825 , Professor of the English Language and Com-
parative Philology in Lafayette College, was born in Milbury, Mass., and graduated at Ani-
herst with the highest honors in 1815. He taught two years in Leicester Academy, _Mass.,
and two years as Tutor in Amherst. He then studied law and began practice in New York,
but, having hemorrhage of the lungs, abandoned the law and went South in 1851. Having
spent a winter in Cuba and Florida, he taught for three years (1852-1855) in Fredericksburg,
Va. He was appointed Tutor in Lafayette in 1855, Adjunct Professor in 1856, and Professor
in 1858. Prof. March has contributed a number of philological articles to leading reviews in
America, and to the J ahrbuch fur Romanische und Englische Literatur in Berlin. His other
publications have been the following: A Method of Philological Study of the English Lan-
guage; A Parser and Analyzer for Beginners; A Comparative Grammar of the Anglo-Saxr,-n
Language; an Anglo-Saxon Reader. Prof. March is considered one of the most advanced

’ ‘American scholars in the department of study which he has chosen. He has done more

probably than any other man to give to the study of English and Anglo-Saxon its proper
status in the curriculum of the American College.

THOMAS HILL, D. D., LL.D., 1818 —-, was born at New Brunswick, N. J. He was put to
school at the age of nine years, and remained at school about three years. He was then ap-
prenticed to the Fredonian printing oﬂice, where he remained three years. After that he
went to school at Lower Dublin Academy, near Philadelphia, for one year. Next he was
apprenticed to an apothecary in his native city, and remained three and a half years. Feel-
ing constrained to become a preacher of the gospel, he left New Jersey in May, 1838, and
began the study of Latin and Greek with Rev. Dr. R. P. Stebbins, and entered Harvard Col-
lege in 1839 ; graduated in due course, and entered the Divinity School at Cambridge. He
completed his studies in less than the prescribed time, and was settled at Waltham, Mass,
in December, 1845, where he preached for fourteen years.

In January, 1860, he removed to Yellow Springs, 0., and took the Presidency of Antioch
College, made vacant by the death of Horace Mann.

In the fall of 1862, the war having suspended that institution, Dr. Hill took -the Presi-
dency of Harvard College, which he held for six years. Domestic sorrows having greatly
impaired his health, he resigned that oﬁice in September, 1868. Two years of rest at Wal-
tham having restored his health, he consented to serve in 1871 in the Legislature of Massa~
chusetts, and later in the same year went into the Coast Survey service in an expedition
round Cape Horn. Harvard College gave him the Doctorate of Divinity in 1860, and Yale
that of Laws in 1863.

562 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Dr. Hill’s force has been scattered upon too many objects to attain such results as might
be expected from a man of his acknowledged abilities. His parochial duties and the superin-
tendence of the public schools occupied him largely during his fourteen years in Waltham,
and the details of college government took up his attention afterwards. During his residence
in Yellow Springs he was also pastor of the Church of the Redeemer, in Cincinnati, seventy-
ﬁve miles distant.

His publications have been as follows: Poems on Slavery, 1843, pamphlet; Elementary
Treatise on Arithmetic, 1845; Geometry and Faith, 1849; Essay on Curves and Curvature,
1850, pamphlet; Popular Explanation of the Electric Telegraph; pamphlet ; Jesus the Inter-
preter of Nature, 1860; First Lessons in Geometry; A Second Book in Geometry ; Liberal Ed-
ucation, <1), ,8, K, 1859, pamphlet; Integral Education. inaugural, 1860, pamphlet; Religion in
Public Instruction, 1861, pamphlet ; Sermons at various times in pamphlet form (four or ﬁve
in all); Contributions to American Encyclopedia on Mathematics and Astronomy, Mathema-
ticians and Astronomers (about one hundred and ﬁfty articles); Articles in North American
Review, Atlantic Monthly, Putnam’s Magazine, Phonographic Magazine, and four or ﬁve
newspapers, prose and poetry (say twenty articles) ; Articles in Ohio Educational Monthly,

Massachusetts Teacher, Illinois Teacher, Barnard’s Journal of Education, etc. (sixteen or_

eighteen articles); Communications to American Academy of Sciences, American Associa-
tion for Advancement of Science, articles in Gould’s Astronomical Journal, Runkle’s Mathe-
matical Monthly, Sil1iman’s Journal, etc. (twenty-ﬁve articles); Lectures and Addresses
published by American Institute of Instruction, Middlesex Agricultural Society, Ohio
Teachers’ _Association, etc. (ﬁve or six); Communications and articles in the Christian Ex-
aminer,-lllonthly Religious Magazine, and in religious newspapers, in prose and verse (forty
to ﬁfty)-;—making three hundred articles, or thereabouts, without counting numerous
newspaper paragraphs.

Dr. Hill is also the inventor of several machines for mathematical uses; the ‘principal
one being an Occultator, by which occultations visible west of the Mississippi in the years
1865-69 were calculated for publication in the American Nautical Almanac.

JOSHUA H. MCILVAINE, D.D., 1815 —, is a native of Lewes, Del., and a graduate of Prince-
ton, both of the college and the seminary. He had a pastoral charge, ﬁrst in Utica and then
in Rochester, N. Y., and in 1860 he became Professor of Belles Lettres in Princeton College.
This position he held until 1870, when he returned to the pastorate in the city of Newark.
Dr. Mcllvaine, besides being an eloquent preacher, is highly accomplished in various de-
partments of liberal scholarship. He has paid a good deal of attention to Sanskrit and the
afﬁliated studies, and delivered a course of lectures in the Smithsonian Institute on Com-
parative Philology, the Sanskrit Language, and the Arrowhead Inscriptions. Another topic
to which he has given still greater study, and which is more than any other his favorite
branch, is Social Science, or Political Economy. In this he is a disciple of Henry C. Carey.
While a Professor at Princeton he prepared and published, 1870, a work on Elocution, the
Sources and Elements of its Power; and he has since published a work on Rhetoric and
Oratory. “

JOHN BASCOM, D. D., 1832 ——-, Professor of Rhetoric at Geneva College, N. Y., was born
at Geneva, graduated at Williams College in 1849; graduated at Andover Theological Semi-
nary in 1855; and has been Professor of Rhetoric at Geneva since that time. He has pub-
lished the following works: Political Economy; Rhetoric; ]Esthetics; Psychology;
Science, Philosophy, and Religion.

JAMES R. BOYD, D. D., 1804 ——, was born‘ in the town of Hunter, Greene County, N. Y.
He prepared for college at the Albany Academy, and graduated at Union in 1822. He
ﬁnished the theological course at Princeton, N. J., in 1826, and iii the following year spent
a. few weeks at Andover Theological Seminary. In the winter of 1832 he attended the
theological lectures of Dr. Chalmers, in the University of Edinburgh.

After a few years spent in pastoral labors, he was obliged, by loss of health, to discon-
tinue them and to seek continued usefulness in the charge of seminaries of learning, and
in writing educational and other works. He held also the Professorship of Moral Philoso-
phy and the pastorate, in Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y. Upon resigning this position
he went to Geneva, and made it his home.

The following works, some of them compilations, are from his pen: Elements of Rhetoric
and Literary Criticism; Moral Philosophy (an eclectic); Annotated English Classics, viz.,
Milton’s Paradise Lost, Young’s Night Thoughts, Cowper’s Task, Table Talk, eto., Thom-
son’s Seasons, Pollock’s- Course of Time, Lord Bacon’_s Essays; Revised edition of Lord
Kames’ Elements of Criticism; Elements of Logic, on the basis of Prof. Barrow; Composi-
tion and Rhetoric; Walk to the Communion Table; The Westminster Shorter Catechism,
with Analysis, Illustrative Anecdotes, etc.; Child’s Book on Shorter Catechism; Last Days
of a Christian Philosopher; Memoir of Life and Writings of Dr. Philip Doddridge.

‘Professor Bledsoe.

 

ALBERT TAYLOR BLEDsoE, LL. D., —-—— , for some time Professor of
Mathematics in the University of Virginia, has written with great ability
on the Philosophy of Mathematics, and on some of the most abstruse points
of metaphysical inquiry.

Professor Bledsoe is a native of Kentucky, and a graduate of West Point, of the class of
1830. He was for a while Professor of the University of Mississippi, and then in the Uni-
versity of Virginia. His department is that of mathematics, though his mind seems to have
an instinctive leaning towards metaphysical inquiry. Since 1867, he has been engaged in
editing The Southern Review. “The Review is, like its chief editor, fearless, able, bold,
gloveless, scholarly, and distinctively Southern, though not belligerently sectional. The
tone and manner are sometimes felt to be severe, and those features are hardly accidental.”
J. Wood Dccvidson.

Professor Bledsoe is the author of the following works : An Examination of Edwards on
the VVill; A Theodicy, or Vindication of the Divine Glory as Manifested in the Constitution
and Government of the Moral VVor1d; An Essay on Liberty and Slavery; The Philosophy
of Mathematics, with special reference to the elements of geometry and the inﬁnitesimal
method. ’

PROF. HENRY NOBLE DAY, 1808 —, nephew of the late President Day, was born in New
Preston, Conn. He graduated at Yale in 1828. After teaching in the Seminary of John Gum-
mere of Burlington, N. J., for three years, he was Tutor in Yale College from 1831 to 1834.
He then travelled for ﬁfteen months in Europe. In 1836 he was ordained pastor of the First
Congregational Church, in Waterbury, Conn. In 1840 he became Professor of Sacred Rheto-
ric in Western Reserve College, Ohio. In order to make the college more acceptable, he, at
the advice of his friends, engaged in the management of the Cleveland and Pittsburg Rail-
road; a11d for ten years that, with three other important connecting railroads, of two of
which he was the President, made many demands upon his active life. In 1858 he became
the President of the Ohio Female College. This position he held till 1864, when he resigned
his trust and removed to New Haven, where he has since resided. _

The following is a list of his works: The Art of Elocution; Fundamental Philosophy,
translated from Krug; The Art of Rhetoric: Rhetorical Praxis; The Art of Book-Keeping;
The Logic of Sir William Hamilton, reduced from his Lectures for use as a text-book; Ele-
ments of Logic; The Art of Discourse, a reconstruction of the Art of Rhetoric; The Art of
Composition; The American Speller; Introduction to the Study of English Literature; The
Young Composer; Logical Praxis; The Science of fﬁsthetics.

RANSOM HERBERT TYLER, A. M., —— ———, wasborn in Leyden, Mass, but, when a lad, moved
with his parents to Oswego County, N. Y., where he has resided to the present time. His early
common-school advantages were good, and he was enabled to obtain a fair classical educa-

tion at the Mexico Academy, located in this county. He never entered college, although.

Hamilton College gave him the honorary degree of Master of Arts. He adopted the legal
profession as a calling, and has been engaged in the practice of the law the most of his life.
He has held various professional appointments, the latest being that of Judge of Oswego
County. Although his life has been devoted principally to the practice of his profession,
he has always retained a taste for literature. His books already published are the follow-
ing.: The Bible‘ and Social Reform, or the Scriptures as A Means of Civilization; The
Law of Religious Societies, Church Government and Creeds, Disturbing Religious Meetings,
and the Law of Burial Grounds in the United States; The Law of Infancy, inclmliiig
Guardianship and" Custody of Infants, and of the Law of Coverture, embracing Dower, Mar-
riage and Divorce, and the Statutory Policy of the several States, in respect to Husband
and Wife ; A Treatise on the Remedy by Ejectment and the Law of Adverse Enjoyment in

Judge Tyler has written a good deal on miscellaneous subjects for the newspaper press.

WILLIAM ADOLPHUS WHEELER, 1833 —, Assistant Librarian of the Boston Public Library,
was born at Leicester, Mass, and graduated at Bowdoin College, in 1853. He assisted Dr.
Worcester in the ‘preparation of his Quarto Dictionary, from 1856 to 1860, and was joint
author, with Mr. Rd. Soule, of the Spelling-Book known as Worcester’s ; also joint author
with the same gentleman of “ A Manual of English Spelling and Pronunciation,” published

Names of Fiction which had previously appeared in Webster’s larger Dictionary. In 1866
he revised and enlarged Ilale’s Brief Biographical Dictionary. In 1866, he prepared, in con-
junction with Mr. Richard Soule, a little work entitled First Lessons in Reading, which
aims to secure all the advantages of the phonetic system without altering either the forms
of the letters or the orthography of words. In 1868, he became assistant superintendent
of the Boston Public Library, and head of its cataloguing department. In 1869, he issued
a sumptuous edition of Mother Goose’s Melodies, which is chieﬂy noteworthy as a contri-
bution to the literary history of the country, and of Boston in particular, Mother Goose
being not only a veritable personage, but a Bostonian. And lastly, he edited, in 1872, a
Dickens Dictionary. He has in preparation a manual entitled Who Wrote It? an Index
to the authorship of the more Noted Works in Ancient and Modern Literature.

Professors Chase and Stuart.

THOMAS CHASE, A. M., Professor of Philology in Haverford College,
near Philadelphia, and George Stuart, A. M., Professor of Latin in the
Philadelphia High—Sehoo1, have made a valuable addition to our educa-
tional literature in the preparation of an extended series of classical
text-books.

Prof. Chase, 1827 -—-, was born in Worcester, Mass. He was educated at the Worcester
Latin School and at Harvard College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1848 with great
distinction, especially in Classics, Metaphysics, and English and Latin Composition. In
1851-53 he was Tutor and for one year Professor pro tem. of Latin at Harvard. In 1853-55
he made the tour of Europe, exploring with particular thoroughness the classic sites of
Italy and Greece, and the monuments of ancient art. In 1854 he was matriculated at the
University of Berlin, where he studied 11nder Boeekh, Curtius, Trendelenburg, and other
illustrious scholars. Returning, he accepted, in 1855, the chair of Philology in Haverford
College, near Philadelphia, which position he still holds. 5 ,

Prof. Chase published in 1862 Hellas, her Monuments and Scenery, a graceful and schol-

- arly account of some of his travels and researches in Greece. In 1851 he published an edition

of the First Book of Cicero’s Tusculan Disputations, the Dream of Scipio, and other Writings
of Cicero on the Immortality of the Soul.

As senior editor of Chase and Stuart’s Classical Series, he has prepared the following: The
]Eneid of Virgil; Horace; Six Books of the £Eneid, with a Vocabulary; and a school
edition of Livy.

566 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

After graduating, mathematics and languages became his favorite studies, the latter
claiming the larger share of his time; during the last six years, they have occupied all his
time. How diligently he has maintained his habits of study is evident from the fact that

Prof. N. C. Brooks.

NATHAN COVINGTON BROOKS, LL. D., 1809 ——-, the veteran educator,
besides the large work which he has done as a teacher, has made numerous
and valuable contributions to educational literature.

Prof. Brooks was born in Cecil County, Md., and graduated at St. J ohn’s College, Annap-
olis. He entered at once upon his career as a teacher, and has followed it Without inter-
ruption to the present time. He was Principal of the Baltimore High School, 1839-1848;
and President of the Baltimore Female College, 1848-1872. He was the ﬁrst head of each
of these important institutions, and gave to each its tone and character. Prof. 'Brooks’s
publications have been numerous and varied. Those by which he is best known are his
classical series, growing out of his Wants and profession as a teacher. They are the follow.-
ing: }Eneid of Virgil; Ovid’s Metamorphoses; Ceesar’s Commentaries; Historia Sacra; Viri
Illustres Americani; First Latin Lessons; First Greek Lessons ; Greek Collectanea Evange-
lica; Scripture Manual, containing Religious Exercises for Morning and Evening, for Schools
and Families. While all of these books are admirable in design and execution, that which
has gained the greatest credit for the richness and variety of its scholarship, and for its
abundant helps in the way of illustrations, is his edition of Ovid. Besides these works in
the line of his profession, Dr. Brooks published in 1865 A Complete History of the Mexican
War, a stately octavo of 558 pages. Prof. Brooks has written a good deal of miscellaneous
matter, and in 1840 issued a neat volume, The Literary Amaranth, a collection of pieces in
prose and poetry.

COL. WILLIAM BINGHAM, 1835 , belongs to a family celebrated all through the Southern
States, and not unknown in those farther North, for their skill and steadfastness in the
business of teaching. Their school, a classical. academy at Mebaneville, N. C., has been
maintained in unbroken succession for three generations,—grandiather, father, and son.
Col. Bingham, the present proprietor, graduated at the University of North Carolina in
1856, and has been teaching ever since. He has published several excellent school-books:
A Gra.mmar of the Latin Language; A Grammar of the English Language; and Ca-esar’s
Commentaries, with Notes and a Vocabulary.

MAROIUS WILLSON, A. M., 1813 ——, has been one of the most laborious a.nd successful
workers in the ﬁeld of school-book literature. His Readers and his Histories are known to
teachers all over the land.

M1‘. Willson was born in West Stockbridge, Mass. but spent most of his youth and early
manhood at Allen’s Hill, Ontario County, N. Y. He ﬁtted for college at Canandaigua Aca-
demy, and graduated at Union, in 1836, with high honors. After graduating, he taught
under Charles Bartlett at Fishkill Landing and at Poughkeepsie, 1836-1842, meanwhile study-
ing law outside of the school-house, and being admitted to the bar in 1839. It was his inten-
tion to make law his profession, but bringing on a severe attack of bronchitis by some im-

prudence in speaking, he was obliged to forego his intentions, and also to give up teaching.
From 1842 onward, with the exception of four years, 1849-1853, when he had charge of the
Canandaigua Academy. his main energies for about twenty years were given to the prepara-
tion and perfecting of his series of books. In 1866, his work being substantially ﬁnished,
he removed with his family to Vineland, N. J., where he still resides.

The following is a list of Mr. Willson’s principal publications: Civil Polity and Political
Economy; Perspective, Architectural and Landscape Drawing; Chart of American History;
History of the United States; Primary American History; American History, School and
University Editions; Outlines of General History, School and University Editions; School
and Family Primer; The First Reader of the School and Family Series; The Second Reader;

of Instruction in Object Lessons; The Intermediate Third Reader; The Intermediate Fourth
Reader; The Intermediate Fifth Reader; The Industrial Drawing Series, 5 numbers; The

Mr. Willson has been successful with his publications. But he has earned success by an
amount of care and toil and skill that would have insured success in almost any other walk
of literary labor.

Professor McGuffey.

VVILLIAM H. MCGUFFEY, D. D., LL. D., 1800-187 3, Professor of Moral
Philosophy and Political Economy i.n the University of Virginia, is widely

570 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

XII. THEOLOGICAL AND RELIGIOUS.

Charles Hodge.

CHARLES Honen, D. D., LL. D., 1797
Theological Seminary at Princeton, has been for many years the acknowl-
edged leader in theology of the Presbyterian Church in the United States.
His great work on Systematic Theology is the most elaborate and exhaus-
tive treatise on that subject which American literature has yet produced.

, Senior Professor in the

Dr. Hodge was born in Philadelphia, of Scotch-Irish descent. He prepared for college at
the Academy in Somerville, N. J., and entered the Sophomore class at Princeton in 1812, at
the age of ﬁfteen, during the ﬁrst year of the Presidency of Dr. Ashbel Green. He took a
high standing in college, and on graduating delivered the Valedictory Oration. During the
memorable revival of religion in college, in 1815, he with several of his associates, (among
them Bishop Mcllvaine, of Ohio, and Bishop Johns, of Virginia,) made a profession of reli-
gion. The three friends entered the Seminary together, and have maintained a cordial inti-
macy ever since, though separated in their ecclesiastical connections.

The superiority of his intellectual abilities soon became discernible, and led to his appoint-
ment. ﬁrst as assistant teacher, and then, in 1822, as Professor, of Oriental and Biblical Litera-
ture in the Seminary. After this appointment, helspent parts of three years abroad, in
Paris, Halle, and Berlin, pursuing his studies, and resumed the duties of his Professorship
on his return in'1828. After ﬁlling the chair more than twenty years, he was, at the request
of Dr. Archibald Alexander, then in declining health, transferred to the chair of Exegetical
and Didactic Theology, and on the death of Dr. Alexander, was made Professor also of
Polemic Theology; and since that time, he has been the Senior Professor in the Seminary.

A continuous Professorship of ﬁfty years in one institution is a noteworthy fact in the
history of American institutions, and the alumni of the Seminary celebrated the event with
great ceremony in April, 1872, on which occasion they endowed the chair of Theology by a.
donation of $50,000, besides a gift of $15,000 to Dr. Hodge himself.

Dr. Hodge has published the following works: Systematic Theology, 3 vols., 8vo; The
Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States; The Way of Life;
Commentaries on the Epistles to the Romans, First and Second Corinthians, and Ephesians.
All these are held in the highest estimation, and are standard Works on the subjects treated.

His other great work, beyond even that of training successive generations of ministers for
fifty years in the leading theological seminary of the country, has been his service in found-
ing, editing, and writing for the Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review. This work was
begun by him in 1825, and for the ﬁrst four years was, as its name imports, simply a Reper-
tary of _valuable articles, chieﬂy German, translated and reprinted. But after 1828, its title and
scope were changed, and it became a Review. During the forty years ensuing, ending with
1868, Dr. Hodge was the animating and guiding soul of this chief organ of American Pres-
byterianism, Writing for it more than any other contributor, more even than any of the
Alexanders, his articles amounting to one—ﬁfth of the entire forty volumes, and taking the
brunt always of the hardest and most perplexing subjects.

Dr. Hodge’s style as a writer partakes of the character of his thought. As a thinker.
he is noted pre-eminently for clearness, and whatever he writes stands before the reader
as if in the open sunlight. His meaning is so plain, there seems no possibility of mis-
taking it. Though habitually calm and moderate in expression, as i-n his opinions, he
sometimes in the discussion of a great question becomes energetic and vehement, and
rises at times to a high degree of argumentative eloquence.

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIMF. 571

ARCHIBALD ALEXANDER Hones, D.D.. 1823 ————, the oldest son of Dr. Charles Hodge, was
born and educated at Princeton. After leaving the seminary, in 1817, he spent three
years as a missionary in India. On retu-rning to America he was settled successively in
West Nottingham, Md., in Fredericksburg, Va.,'and in Wilkesbarre, Pa. In 1862 he was
elected Professor of Theology in the Western Theological Seminary, at Alleghany, where
he still remains. He has published Outlines of Theology, The Atonement, and Commentary
on the Confession of Faith, all of which have been received with the highest commen-
dations.

WILLIAM HENRY GREEN, D. D., 1825 -—-, Professor of Oriental Literature in the Theo-
logical Seminary at Princeton, was born at Groveville, near Bordentown, N. J. He graduated
at Lafayette in 1840; studied theology at Princeton; preached for a while in Philadelphia;
and in 1851 was appointed to the chair which he now holds. Dr. Green has published the
following ‘works; A Hebrew Grammar; An Elementary Hebrew Grammar; A Hebrew
Chrestomathy; The Pentateuch Vindicated from the Aspersion of Colenso. He has also
been, since his appointment to his professorship, one of the largest contributors to the
Princeton Review, his articles already numbering over ﬁfty.

JAMES CLEMENT MOFFAT, D. D., 1811 ——-, Professor of Church History in the Theological
Seminary in Princeton, was born in the South of Scotland, where in his youth he was a
shepherd’s boy. Having no advantages of education, but an insatiable thirst for knowl-
edge," he apprenticed himself in 1827 to a printer, with a view of getting access to books.
Here, while working at his trade ten hours a day, he taught himself Latin, Greek, He-
brew, something of Persian and of several European languages. In 1833 he came to the
United States to pursue his trade as a printer, but through the advice and assistance of
friends entered Princeton College, where he graduated in 1835. He was Tutor in the
College, 1837-1839; Professor in Lafayette, 1839-1841; Professor in Miami University,
1841—1853; Professor in the College at Princeton, 1853-1861; and since 1861 has been Pro-
fessor in the Theological Seminary at Princeton. Dr. Moifat has published the following
works: A Life of Dr. Chalmers; Introduction to the Study of ]Esthetics; A Comparative
View of Religions. He has also contributed about thirty articles to the Princeton Review,
and published several addresses.

John Maclean.

JOHN MACLEAN, D. D., LL. D_., 1.800 —, tenth President of the College
of New Jersey, has made several valuable contributions to religious and
theological literature.

Dr. Maclean is a native of Princeton and a graduate of the college, in which he was
an oﬂicer continuously for ﬁfty years, being successively Tutor, Professor, Vice President,
and President. Dr. Maclean, though pressed with the executive duties connected with
his oﬂice, has yet always kept himself abreast with the great moral, theological, and edu-
cational issues of the day, and has occasionally employed his pen in their discussion.
His chief publications are the following: A Review of the Action of the General Assem-
bly, in 1837, defending the act of separation; The Quorum or Elder Question, in 1844; The
True Relations of the Church and State to Common Schools; A Review of Prof. Stuart’s
Prize Essay on Temperance, entering largely into what was called the “wine question,”
in 1831; A Review of “Bacchus” and “Anti-Bacchus,” involving some of the same ques-
tions as the review of Stuart; also, occasional Sermons. Since his retirement, he has been
engaged in writing a History of the College.

572 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

James McCosh.

JAMES MCCOSH, D. D., LL.D., 1811 , eleventh President of the
College of New Jersey, has greatly distinguished himself as a Writer on
Metaphysics.

Dr. McCosh was born i11 Scotland, in a country parish on the banks of “Bonnie Doon."
He was educated at the parochial school, and at the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh.
While a student at Edinburgh, he gained his ﬁrst academical distinction by an essay on
the Stoic Philosophy, for which the University, on motion of Sir William Hamilton, went

out of its usual course and conferred on him the honorary degree of A. M. He was or-

dained minister of Arbroal, 1835; removed to Breechin, 1839; took an active and leading
part in his district, in 1843, in the Free Church movement, and went out with the others
from the establishment; became Professor in Queen’s College, Belfast, in_1852; and Presi-
dent at Princeton, in 1868. .

His work on The Method of the Divine Government, published in 1850, made a profound
impression. It showed the author to be a man capable of dealing with the very highest
questions of mental and spiritual science,- on equal terms with the great thinkers of the
race, ancient or modern,—- Aristotle, Plato, Edwards, Kant, and Sir William Hamilton. A.
visit which Dr. McCosh paid to the United States a few years later, brought him into
acquaintance with many of the leading men of the country, and produced a most favorable
impression in regard to his personal character and his probable abilities as an administrator
of affairs. Accordingly, when the Presidency of Princeton College became vacant by the
resignation of Dr. liflaclean, the oﬁice was tendered to Dr. McCosh, and he entered upon its
duties in 1868. The extraordinary executive ability which he has there displayed abun-
dantly jusitiﬁed the choice.

Dr. McCosh’s other works are the following: The lntuitions of the Mind Inductively
Investigated; Mr. J. S. Mill’s Philosophy; Typical Forms and Special Ends in the Creation
(in connection with George Dickie, of Belfast); The Supernatural in Relation to the
Natural ; Logic; Christianity and Positivism.

, The two works last named were written in this country. All of them have been printed
here. “As a thinker, Dr. McCosh has the rare and inestimable faculty of constructive
thought ; not con tenting himself with taking the dimensions, or even repairing the ﬂaws of
other men’s ‘building, but raising tier after tier of solid masonry on his own account. His
work on The In tuitions of the Mind seems to us the noblest contribution made to the specu-
lative philosophy of Scotland since the days of Reid. We have not forgotten what is due
to Sir William Hamilton. As a metaphysical critic and logician Sir William stands facile
princeps among Scottish philosophers of the nineteenth century. But if he deﬁned and de-
fended the philosophy of consciousness, Sir William did little to extend its domain; and
only in the book we have mentioned do we ﬁnd the work commenced by Reid carried posi-

tively forward.” —— Peter Bayne.

While a professor in Queen’s College, Dr. McCosl1 took an active part in advocating the
disestablishment of the Church of Ireland. He wrote many pamphlets on Disestablishment,
and on National, nnsectarian Schools for Ireland.

LYMAN II. ATWATI-IR, D. D., 1813 ———-—, was born in New Haven, Conn., and graduated at Yale
in 1831, in the same class with President Porter. He studied theology at Yale, and was fora
time Tutor in the college. He became pastor of the First Congregational Church of Fairﬁeld
in 1835. He was one of those who opposed the theological views of Taylor and Bushnell.
He began writing for the Princeton Review in 1840, and since that time he has been without
interruption one of its leading and most able contributors. In 1854 he was elected Professor
of Mental and Moral Philosophy in the College at Princeton. which chair, with some modiﬁ-
cations, he still holds. He also lectures in the Theological Seminary. Dr. Atwater published,

FROM’1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 573

in 1867, a Manual of Logic, which has been well received. But his chief literary work has
been in the Princeton Review, to which he has contributed between seventy and eighty
articles, and of which he has been for some time one of the editors."

CHARLES VV. SHIELDS, D. D., 1825 , Professor in Princeton College, was born at New
Albany, Ind., and educated at Princeton, both in the College and the Seminary. He has pub-
lished A Funeral Eulogy at the Obsequies of Dr. E. K. Kane; Philosophia Ultima; A Manual
of Worship ; The Directory for Public Worship and the Book of Common Prayer, considered
with reference to the question of a Presbyterian liturgy ; Liturgia Expurgata, or the Prayer-
Book Amended according to the Presbyterian Revision of 1661; The Book of Remembrance,
a New-Year’s Book, etc. Dr. Shields has made a special study of liturgical literature, and
has shown marked ability and taste in that line of composition. He has been for some years
engaged upon an elaborate work on The Harmony ofiScience and Revealed Religion, in
which he purposes to develop the views put forth brieﬂy in his essay entitled Philosophia
Ultima.

 

Dr. Boarolman.

HENRY AUGUSTUS BOABDMAN, D. D., 1808 —, long the most con-
spicuous ornament of the Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, has made
many valuable contributions to religious literature, among which may be
named especially two admirable Volumes, The Bible in the Family, and
The Bible in the‘Counting-House.

Dr. Boardman is a native of Troy, and a graduate of Yale,of the class of 1829. He studied
theology at Princeton, and he became pastor of the Tenth Presbyterian church in Philadel-
phia in 1833, immediately after leaving the Seminary, and has continued in that position
ever since.

His publications have been numerous, and have all been marked by signal ability. Both
as a writer and a thinker, Dr. Boardinan has few equals and still fewer superiors among
the many distinguished Presbyterian divines who have been his contemporaries. His chief
published works are the following: The Bible in the Family; The Bible in the Counting-
House; The Great Question; The Apostolical Succession; Letters to Bishop Deane on the
Oxford Tracts; The Scripture Doctrine of Original Sin; The Society of Friends and the
Two Sacraments; The Christian Ministry not a Priesthood ; A l’astor’s Counsels.

Dr. Boardman has been in the habit, on the occasion of the annual Tlianksgiving, of
preaching sermons on subjects of a public and semi-political character. Many of them
have been printed, and have received great applause both for their digniﬁed eloquence, and
for the grave and statesmanlike views which they contained. Of these may be named, A
Discourse on the American Union; On the Federal Judiciary ; On Daniel Webster, etc.

“ Dr. Boardman’s style reﬂects his own mental vigor, clearness, vivacity, industry, ﬁnish,
and taste. It abounds in apt illustrations, puts abstract principles in concrete living forms,
is relieved by salient points and sparkling jets; it often rings with the notes of a genuine

this important Board, particularly to its juvenile books, that sound and healthy literary
character which marks a large portion of them. Besides this general editorial work, Dr.

Dr. J acolous.

MELANCTHON WILLIAMs- J ACOBUS, D. D., LL. D., 1816_ ——, Professor
of Oriental and Biblical Literature in the Presbyterian Theological Semi-
nary at Alleghany, Pa., is the author of a valuable series of Commentaries.

Dr. Jacobus is a native of Newark, N. J., and a graduate of Princeton, both of the College
and the Seminary. While a student in the College, he took the highest honors of his class
for scholarship, and he has distinguished himself since to a degree fully equal to the high
expectations formed from the brilliant success of his early career. On ﬁnishing his course
in the Seminary, he remained for one year as assistant to Prof. J . Addison Alexander in the
department of Hebrew. From 1838 to 1850 he ministered very successfully to the First
Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn. In 1850, he spent a year in foreign travel, chieﬂy in clas-
sic and Bible lands, and in 1851, being then thirty-six years old, he was elected by the Gen-
eral Assembly Professor of Oriental and Biblical Literature in the Theological Seminary at
Alleghany, Pa. The latter position he has held ever since. A

Dr. Jacobus has written Letters to Governor Bigler on the Common School System, a
tract on Universal Salvation, and a series of Notes or Commentaries on portions of the
Scriptures. These have extended to Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, and Genesis. They
belong to the same class as Barnes’s Notes, being intended mainly for the use of Sunday-
School teachers, though having some marked peculiarities of their own. They have been
very popular, and constitute the author’s chief claim to literary distinction. They are dis-
tinguished at once by learning’ and critical ability, by sound judgment, and by remarkable
clearness and grace of expression.

Tayler Lewis.

TAYLER LEWIS, D. D., LL. D., 1802 ———, Professor of Greek in Union
College, Schenectady, is by general consent the foremost man in his depart-
ment, in the United States. In the extent and thoroughness of his attain-
ments in Greek, he ranks with the ﬁrst scholars of the great European
Universities. At the same time, While making these special acquisitions,
he has not lived the life of a recluse, but has managed to keep himself
abreast With general scholarship, and has contributed largely to current
literature.

Prof. Lewis was born in N orthumberland, Saratoga County, N. Y. He graduated at Union
in 1820, studied law, and commenced practice. While waiting for clients, he obtained the
loan of a Hebrew Grammar and Bible, and became so absorbed in the study that he read the
entire Hebrew Bible through the ﬁrst year. The new realm of thought thus opened led
him to read over with fresh interest all his college text-books, and thence to a general read-
ing of Greek and Latin authors. For nine years he continued this mode of life, studying by
day and by night, and frequently all night. The amount of classical reading that he did
in those years is almost incredible. At length, abandoning law altogether, he took charge
of a classical school, and taught at Waterford and at Ogdensburg, N. Y., from 1833 to 1838.
In 1838 he received from the author of the present volume an invitation to take part in the
instruction of the Edgehill School, at Princeton, and had made an arrangement to that
effect. But receiving about the same time the appointment of Professor of Greek in the
New York University, he accepted the position and remained there from 1838 to 1849. Since
1849 he has occupied the corresponding chair at Schenectady. ,

Of the extent of Dr. Lewis’s classical reading, ajudgment may be formed from the follow-
ing statement: During those secluded years, before the call to the New York University, he
read the Hebrew Bible through aimuallg/, for fourteen years; the Iliad and Odyssey, entire,
almost as often ; the whole of the Greek drama, i'orty~ﬁve extant Plays, twice over, and many

of them oftener; all the Dialogues of Plato, some of them frequently; nearly all of Aristotle,
-his Physica, Metaphysica, and his more special physical treatises, andralso his Ethical
and Political Writings; a large part of the lesser Hexameter poets, such as Appollonius
Rhodius, and Aratus; also Pindar and the pastoral poets; all of Thucydides; all of Hero-
dotus; all of Xenophon ; nearly all of Plutarch, Longinus, Lucian, Diodorus Siculus, and the
Gnomic and Epic poetry; all of Virgil, Horace, and Ovid; and all of Cicero, except his
Orations. ,

Prof. Lewis’s reading has been carried much further since. But the foregoing statement,
giving an enumeration of his preparatory course, is suﬁicient to show his character for
thoroughness and enthusiasm in his department. « He has added Arabic and Syriac to his

other acquisitions, and has read largely, not only in the Koran but in other Arabic theo-

logical lore, as well as in the later Hebrew rabbinical writings.

One peculiarity of his scholarship is that he has read the ancient authors themselves,
instead of reading about them. This shows itself also in his writings. His quotations and
references are not those obtained from Lexicons and Indexes, but the spontaneous sugges-
tions of his own mind, or the recollections of what he has himself read.

He wrote nothing before coming to New York in 1838. Since then his pen has been busy.
The following are his principal works: The Platonic Theology, or Plato contra Atheos;
The Six Days of Creation ;. The World Problem, or the Bible and Science; The Divine-Human
in the Scriptures; State Rights, a Photograph from the Ruins of Ancient Greece; Capital
Punishment. He has by him, ready for publication, the Bible Language of the Heart; Reli-
gion and the State; and ﬁve manuscript volumes of Biblical Criticism. He translated and
edited Ecclesiastes, in Lange’s Commentary, with a new metrical version, and, in connection
with Dr. Gosman, Genesis, of the same series.

His articles for the leading journals and reviews, and his other papers, literary and educa-
tional, are greater in amount than his published volumes.

1836; President, 1836-1858; Professor of Christian Theology since 1858. His labors in the

HENRY RUFFNER, D. D., LL.D., 1790-1861, was born on a part of the original Ruﬂ'ner estate,
in Page County, Va. While he was quite young, his father, David Ruffner, changed his
residence to the valley of the Great Kanawha, where he purchased large tracts of land,
which proved very valuable for farming, coal, and salt, - which lands are still owned by his
descendants. David was the discoverer of salt-water by boring, and was the ﬁrst salt-maker
in Kanawha. Henry received the chief L " ' f lrie classical education at the long celebrated
school of Dr. McElhenny, at Lewisburg, Gleenbrier County, Va. In 1812 he became a stu-
dent, and at the same time a Tutor, in Washington College, Lexington, Va. In 1814 he
received the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Soon after, he entered the Christian ministry, and
returning to Kanawha, founded the Presbyterian church of Charleston, the ﬁrst in that
region of country. He was Professor in Washington College, Lexington, 1819-1837, and
President, 1837-1848. After his resignation, in 1848, he retired to his Kanawha estate,
where he spent the remainder of his life in farming, preaching, and writing.

His publications were_the following: The Fathers of the Desert, being a History of Mon-
achism; The Predestinarian; Methodism; also, a considerable number of pamphlet Ser-
mons, Lectures, Addresses, etc. Among these was his famous Address on Slavery, known
as the “ Ruffner Pamphlet,” and containing an elaborate argument against the institution
of slavery. It was written while he was President of the College, and caused great excite-
ment. Dr. Ruffner wrote much and constantly for the magazines, especially for the South-
ern Literary Messenger, Richmond. '

REV. WILLIAM HENRY RUFFNER, 1824 —-, son of the preceding, and State Superintendent
of Public Instruction in Virginia, was born in Lexington, Va.. and graduated at Washing-
ton College, in that place, in 1842. He studied a year longer, as resident graduate; made
salt in Kanawha from July, 1843, to January, 1845; studied theology at both Union and
Princeton Seminaries, one year at each ; was Chaplain at the University of Virginia, 1849-
1851; Pastor of the Seventh Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, 1851-1853. Broken in
health, he then returned to Virginia, and engaged in farming, but preached occasionally.
In 1870, he was elected ﬁrst State Superintendent of Public Instruction in Virginia.

Mr. Ruifner, while a pastor in Philadelphia, published a book called Charity and the
Clergy, in continuation of a subject broached by Stephen Colwell, New Themes for the Prot-
estant Clergy. Both books indulged rather freely and sharply in criticism upon the profes-
sion, and led to a warm discussion not yet forgotten. Mr. Ruffner was one of the leading
Writers in Stuart Robinson’s Presbyterial Critic. Of late years he has written a good deal

on social and political subjects. In the work in which he is now engaged, as Superintendent
of Public Instruction, he has shown remarkable soundness of judgment and executive
ability. His success in this department has been little less. than wonderful.

he has continued ever since.

His earliest writings Were for the Southern Literary Messenger, and Ruiﬁn’s Farmer’s
Register, to both of which magazines he was for a time a large contributor, and he has con-
tinued to write more or less for reviews, magazines, and papers ever since. His first publi-

Dr. Scott.

WILLIAM ANDERSON Scorr, D. D., 1813 , pastor of the St. J ohn’s
Presbyterian Church, San Francisco, Widely known as an eloquent preacher,
has gained equal reputation as a Writer, his contributions to religious litera-
ture being both numerous and valuable. 1

Dr. Scott was born in Bedford County, Tenn., of Scotch-Irish parentage. He was educated
among the Cumberland Presbyterians, and licensed by them to preach at the age of seven-
teen. He spent one year in missionary work, after the manner of the early circuit-riders in
the Methodist Church. Feeling keenly the want of education, he relinquished preaching
and went to Cumberland College, Kentucky, where he graduated in 1833. He then studied
theology regularly at Princeton. On leaving the Seminary he spent two years in Louisiana,
preaching in different places. In 1836-37 he had a large Female Seminary in Winchester,
Tenn.; in 1838-40, he was President of the Nashville Female Academy, having at the same
time pastoral care of the Presbyterian church at the Hermitage, which was supported mainly
by Andrew Jackson and his family, and of which Jackson himself became a conimunicant.
Dr. Scott succeeded Daniel Baker in Tuscaloosa, Ala., in 1840, and John Breckinridge in
New Orleans, in 1842. In 1854 he went to San Francisco and organized the Calvary Presby-
terian Church, of which he was pastor until 1861. On account of troubles growing out of
the war, he resigned his position and went to Europe, where he resided two years, travel-
ling, attending theological lectures, and preaching. In 1863 he became pastor of the Forty-
Second Street Presbyterian Church, New York city, but in 1870 returned to his chosen home
in San Francisco, where he is again engaged in the work of building up a large and power-
ful church.

During his former pastorate there, he aided largely, with Dr. Burrows, in establishing
the University of San Francisco, and he is now, in connection with his present pastorate,
Professor of Moral and Mental Philosophy in the Theological Seminary under the care of the
Synod of the Pacific.

Dr. Scott has travelled extensively in Europe, at different times, in 1846, 1850-51, 1861-63,
and 1868, and he has spent a year in Egypt, Arabia, Holy Land, Turkey, and Greece. He
has been a diligent student as well as a hard worker, and he uses with ease eleven different
languages.

Dr. Charles Porterfield Krauth,

CHARLES PORTEREIELD KRAUTH, D.D., 1823 —-—, Professor of Moral
and Intellectual Philosophy in the University of Pennsylvania, is one of
the most learned theologians in the Lutheran Church in the United States.
His latest and largest work, The Conservative Reformation and its The-
ology, is a work of masterly ability and independent research.

Dr. Krauth, son of the Dr. Krauth mentioned in the previous chapter, was born in Martins-
burg, Va., and graduated at Pennsylvania College, Gettysburg, in the class of 1839. He was
ordained in 1842, and was pastor successively in Baltimore, Winchester, and Pittsburg, and
in St.‘Mark’s Lutheran Church, Philadelphia. In 1861, he became editor of The Lutheran
and Missionary, Philadelphia, and in 1864 was elected Professor of Theology and Church
History in the Lutheran Seminary in that city. In 1868, he was appointed Professor of
Moral and Intellectual Philosophy in the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Krauth is a man
of great and varied learning, and his writings have given him a conspicuous position out-
side of the bounds of his own Church. He published a translation of The Augsburg Con-
fession, with Notes; took an active part in the preparation of the Church Book of the
Lutheran Church ; edited for a time the book department of the American Literary Gazette;
and has written Poverty, three essays; The Evangelical Mass and the Romish Mass; The
Two Pageants, on the death of Mr. Lincoln; Sketch of the Thirty Years’ War; and The
Conservative Reformation and its Theology. This last is a large 8V0 of 840 pages. “It is
among the most elaborate and learned works on ecclesiastical or theological topics that
have recently been published in the United States, and is marked by an exceedingly tem-

perate and careful expression of views in respect to the position and tenets of different’

schools, which, after all allowance is made for the peculiar views of the writer, deserves
careful attention on the part of all who care to understand the various aspects of one of the
most important phases in the development of European thought.” — Saturclay Review.

MARTIN L. STOEVER, LL.D., 1820-1870, was born in Germantown, Pa. He was graduated in
Pennsylvania College, Gettysburg, in 1838, and in 1840 was called to a Professorship in the
institution. From that time to the time of his death, Prof. Stoever was intimately asso-
ciated with the College in the minds of all who knew anything of its affairs. He edited and
mainly supported The Evangelical Review, and did noble service, through various channels
of publication, as the Lutheran biographer and the collector of Lutheran statistics. Among
his publications are the following: Life and Times of Henry M. Muhlenberg; Memoir of
Philip P. Mayer; A Brief Sketch of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in the United States;
and numerous contributions to Dr. Sprague’s Annals of the American Pulpit. He has been
called the “Plutarch of the Lutheran Church in America.” A more genial, kindhearted
man probably never lived. The familiar lines of Halleck upon his friend Drake, with
the change of but a word or two, would form an appropriate inscription for this good man :

None knew him but to love him,
None named him but to praise.

Lange’s great Commentary on the Holy Scriptures. This work, in its introduction to
American readers, has been not merely translated, but has been enlarged and modiﬁed to
such an extent as to be almost a new and original work ; and although executed in detail
by numerous fellow-workmen, yet the whole of it has passed through the supervision of Dr.
Schaff as translator and editor in chief. The work when ﬁnished will be the most complete

and thorough commentary in the English language.

Dr. Hallock.

WILLIAM ALLEN HALLOCK, D. D., 17 94 , the veteran Secretary
and chief editor of the American Tract Society, has made some valuable
contributions to literature from his own pen, besides the immense service
that he has done through the publications of the Society of which for nearly
half a century he has been the chief representative.

Dr. Hallock was born in Plainﬁeld, Hampshire County, Mass., and was the oldest son of
Rev. Moses Hallock of that place. In earlier years he made considerable advance in Latin
studies, but thinking that if he obtained a college education it would, if still unconverted,
but aggravate his ﬁnal doom, he aided his father in the conduct of a small farm, where he
acquired habits of industry, economy, toil, and self-denial. At the age of twenty, at his own
request, he resumed study, pursued the whole course of four years in Williams College, and
graduated with the highest honors of his class, September, 1819.

He then took the three years regular course in the Theological Seminary at Andover, soon
after entering which he made a public profession of his faith in Christ, never confident as to
the time of conversion; but acting under the distinct conviction: “I owe the Lord Jesus
ten thousand talents ; yet ever doubting whether I have been truly converted, I am doing
almost nothing for Him— henceforth I will devote myself to his service, a11d if I perish, I
perish.” He felt utterly unworthy to be a missionary, or to take any part in the benevolent

institutions of the day, and made arrangements to go into the Western Reserve, 0., or some ‘

other destitute regions, as a preacher of the gospel.

But a few weeks before his graduation at Andover, the Rev. Dr. Justin Edwards, wl1o1n he
had long venerated as a champion in the gospel ministry, andvwho was the Secretary of the
New England Tract Society, called at his room, saying that there was no paid agent for the
Tract cause in the country, that it was in a languishing state, and that the Professors of
the Seminary had united with l1in1 in the judgment that it was his duty to give at least a
few months to that service. 8

Mr. Hallock consented, and the morning after closing his theological course, Thursday,
September 27, 1822, sat down to examine the history of the Religious ’l‘ract Society in Lon-
don, and of all the tract operations of this country as far as could be ascertai11ed——- the total
donations for the tract cause throughout the country for the preceding year having
scarcely exceeded $2,500. » _

After a month spent in preparation, writing a sermon in behalf of the tract cause, and
some circulars and articles for the newspapers, he took his cane (the expense of procuring a
horse or riding in the stage being deemed quite too great) and visited the small neighbor-
ing churches of New Hampshire. After ﬁve weeks he returned with $419.15 received in

F:aoM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 589

donations, chiefly to constitute pastors life-members; his total expense incurred being
thirty-four cents, the whole of which had been paid for tolls at bridges or turnpike
gates.

Both the receipts and the travelling expenses were deemed satisfactory, and he went on
to prosecute the work for two years, when the question arose, both at Boston and New
York, of forming a National Tract Society; and after written negotiations till February,
1825, Mr. Hallock visited New York, and after many meetings for consultation and prayer,
received from Arthur Tappan his subscription of $5,000 for erecting a tract-house, from Moses
Allen $3,000, from Richard T. Haines and W. W. Chester, $1,000 each, the sum being soon
raised to $20,000, and then increased to $25,000. A public preliminary meeting was also
held, which called a convention of delegates from all the tract societies of the country,
which delegates met in May, 1825, when the National Tract Society was fully organized,
Mr. Hallock being elected the sole Corresponding Secretary, and thenceforward giving it
his undivided anxieties, counsels, toils, and prayers, till the Society’s annual receipts
increased to about $500,000.

The Memoirs of Harlan Page, of Rev. Dr. Justin Edwards, and of Rev. Moses Hallock, ap-
pended to the Memoir of Rev. Jeremiah Hallock, were written by Dr. Hallock; also the tracts

Mountain Miller, Motl1er’s Last Prayer, The Only Son, and Sketches of Rev. Dr. J. C. Bing-

ham and Arthur Tappan. ,

But the main work of Dr. Hallock’s life, exclusive of his labors as Home and Foreign
Corresponding Secretary, has been the preparation and carrying through the press of all
the Society’s issues in English, the total list, at the end of forty-ﬁve years, being, as given by
the Society’s Forty-ﬁfth Annual Report, 4,804, of which 921 are volumes of larger or smaller
size; besides the correspondence and care connected with the issuing of 4,015 publications at
foreign stations, of which 588““are volumes, the missions and institutions aided, to which
about $600,000 had been remitted in cash, having issued publications in 143 languages and
dialects. The Society combining Christians of the various evangelical denominations, the
preparation of its publications has been a work at once arduous and of high responsibility.
As the Sdciety pursued "its steadily advancing course it became evident that practically, ex-
clusive of the questions of the orders of the clergy and the mode and subjects of baptism, the
great body of evangelical Christians are agreed in the soul-saving truths of the LT pel;
and the universal conﬁdence in the Society’s issues, throughout the wide range of its opera-
tions at home and abroad, is a strong testimony to the sound judgment, honesty, practical
good sense, and in some measure also to the sound literary taste of its chief agent am
adviser.

‘ MRS. M. A. HALLOCK, 1810 —-—, Wife of the preceding, was born in Rowe, Mass, of
parents of the old Puritan stock. Her mother, a Foster, was descended in a direct line from
old Miles Standish of the May-Flower. Wliile she was still young, her father, Mr. Levi Ray,
removed with his family to the fertile Valley of the Chenango, in the State of New York,
and settled at Norwich, the county-seat. Her education was there carried forward in such
schools as the place afI"orded till the death of her mother, when circumstances greatly
retarded its thoroughness and completeness.

She early had a fondness for scribbling, and was ever ready to dash off “ compositions” for
the girls of her class, which they gladly received and read as their own. In 1829 she entered
the family-of the Rev. Mr. Rexford, of Sherburne, Chenango County, and was received by
him and his excellent wife as a beloved daughter. For four happy years she remained under
his careful training and teaching. He was an able man —a metaphysical reasoncr, a11d ﬂat-
tered his young protegée by saying that she more readily apprehended his ideas and argu-
ments than some of the clergynien of the neighborhood. ’ A

While in this family she united with the Presbyterian Church, and in 1884 was married
to Mr. Hollister Lathrop, a merchant in Brockport, N. Y. In 1851 Mr. Lathrop died, leaving
the widow and three children with ample means, as they supposed ; but when the estate was

settled, it Was found that some effort was necessary for a support, and Mrs. Lathrop resorted
to teaching and writing. Her ﬁrst book, That Sweet Story of Old, was sent to the American
Tract Society, with hesitation. It is now doing a good work among the children of heathen
lands. Her other publications are: Bethlehem and Her Children; The Life of the Apostle
Paul; The Life of Solomon; The Fall of Jerusalem; The Life of Daniel; and a book on
Natural History—Beasts and Birds. -

The correspondence connected with the publication of these volumes led to her acquaint-
ance with the Secretary of the Society, Dr. Hallock, and to her becoming his wife. Mrs.
Hallock’s publications, though not numerous, are held in high estimation, and are among
the most useful and attractive which the Society has put forth.

Henry Ward Beecher.

REV. HENRY VVARD BEECHER, 1813 , pastor of the Plymouth
Church, Brooklyn, the most popular of American preachers, is also, though

Mr. Beecher is a son of Dr. Lyman Beecher. He was born at Litchﬁeld, Conn., and grad-
uated at Amherst, in the class of 1834. He studied theology under his father, in Lane Sem-
inary, and began his ministerial duties in the West. Since 1847, he has been pastor of the
Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, N . Y., where he has gathered a congregation said to be the
largest in the United States. His success as a popular Lecturer is quite equal to his success
as a preacher, and «his lectures came to be in_ such demand, even at the high rate of $500 a
night, that he was obliged to decline further engagements, as interfering with his minis-
terial duties, and for some time past he has refused all applications for public lectures and
addresses, except for some special occasion. He was engaged at one time in editing'The
Independent. His articles written for that paper were signed with an asterisk (*), and were
republished in book-form under the name of The Star Papers. Among‘ his other publica-
tions are, Lectures to Young Men; Sermons; Plymouth Collection of Hymns; Industry and
Idleness; Eyes and Ears; Freedom and War; Norwood, a Novel written originally for the
New York Ledger; Life Thoughts, consisting of selections from his extemporaneous ser-
mons, made by one of his congregation and revised by himself; Yale Lectures on Preaching.
Of the Life Thoughts, Star Papers, and Norwood, immense numbers have been sold.

years, and during all that time has been absent from his post at the opening of theterrn

Committee of the college, and his counsels have had a controlling inﬂuence in its affairs in
nearly the entire period of its history. His engrossing duties as the chief executive ofﬁcel‘
of so large an institution, have prevented his giving much time to authorship. He has
published, however, a work on Moral Philosophy, which has attracted a good deal of atten-
tion, and a considerable number of pamphlets on questions connected with his college:
Oberlin, its Origin, Progress, and Results; The Joint Education of the Sexes; Co—education

the new society. In 1850, he was sent out as a missionary to Jerusalem by the Missionary
Society of his Church. After laboring in this mission for three years, he returned to
America to complete the education of his children, and then returned to Palestine and re-

where he continued until his death, giving his time to preaching and to literary pursuits.

608 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Dr. Barclay wrote much for the Millennial Harbinger and other periodicals of his
Church, and while in Jerusalem he wrote several pamphlets, both in English and Arabic.
His chief literary work, however, is The City of the Great King, admitted by the most emi-
nent authorities to be one of the best works yet produced in regard to Jerusalem.

SARAH BARCLAY JOHNSON, 1837 —--, only daughter of the preceding, was born in Albe-
marle County, Va., and was educated at home by her father. She accompanied her parents
on their mission to Palestine, and rendered valuable assistance, especially by her pencil and
brush —most of the illustrations in Dr. Barclay’s book being by her hand. She was married
in Washington city, in 1856, to J. Augustus Johnson, Consul-General of Syria, then on a
visit to America, and she has remained in Syria many years, spending her winters in Beirut
and her summers on Mount Lebanon. Mrs. Johnson has published an exceedingly popular
book, The I-Iadji in Syria.

ROBERT RICHARDSON,
vols., 8vo, Memoirs of Alexander Campbell, Embracing a View of the Origin, Progress, and
Principles of the Religious Reformation which he Advocated. Prof. Richardson was a dis-
ciple and associate of Mr. Campbell, and the work gives a clear, well written account of the
topic named in the title. While earnest in the presentation of his own views, the author is

commendably fair and charitable towards others, and gives abundant evidence of being a.
cultivated and scholarly gentleman.

Dr. Stone.

JOHN SEELY STONE, D. D., 17 95 ———-, Senior Professor of the Episcopal
Theological School at Cambridge, Mass., is regarded as the most accom-
plished expounder of Christian doctrine in the American Episcopal Church.
His publications have not been numerous, but have uniformly been of a
high order of merit, and his Sermons, both in matter and style, are Worthy
of being accounted classical.

Dr. Stone was born in West Stockbridge, Mass., the son of a Berkshire farmer. He en-
joyed in early life only such training as is afforded by the district school and the country
fa.rm. Afterpassing his boyhood and early manhood in the ﬁelds and the Workshop, he be-
gan his education in earnest at a time in life when most young men consider theirs already
ﬁnished. He studied at Hudson Academy, and then in Dr. Rudd’s Classical School at Eliza-
beth, N. J. After completing the curriculum at Union College, Schenectady, in 1823, he
pursued his theological studies in The General Theological Seminary of the Episcopal
Church, in New York City, and was ordained January 4, 1826. Previous to his ordination
he had served for a while as Tutor in Geneva (now Hobart) College. 1

Since entering the service of the church, Dr. Stone has ﬁlled many important charges.
His ﬁrst rectorate was that of St. Michael’s Church, Litchﬁeld, Conn. From this he was
called to the charge of All Saints’ Church, Frederick, Md. He then became Associate
Rector of Trinity Church, New Haven, Rector of St.-Paul’s Church, Boston, Christ Church,
Brooklyn, St. Paul’s Church, Brookline, Mass. In 1862 he was chosen Professor and Gris-
wold Lecturer in the Episcopal Divinity School, Philadelphia, and in 1867 made Professor
and Dean of Faculty in the Episcopal Theological School of Massachusetts, at Cambridge.
While rector of Christ Church, Brooklyn, Dr. Stone was also Secretary and General Agent
of the Society for the Promotion of Evangelical Knowledge, and a member of the Publishing
Committee of the American Tract Society.

Dr. Stone’s works are the following: A Life of BishopGriswold; A Life of Dr. Milnor; The
Living Temple; The Christian Sacraments; The Divine Rest (a work on the Sabbath); The
Contrast (between the evangelical and the tractarian systems).

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 61]

In all these works — as well as in his numerous sermons, which have been the spiritual

nourishment and delight of thousands of loving hearers of the VVord——Dr. Stone exhibits ‘

acuteness and learning, and an unusual command of good, sound English. His writings are
at once simple and elegant, the choice fruits of an eminently vigorous and cultured mind.
Dr. Stone is not an orator, in the strict sense of the word, but his sermons, by their sub-
stance and their diction, and also by their true Christian spirit, entitle him to a place among
the foremost divines of the Protestant Episcopal Church. So far as church distinctions are
concerned, Dr. Stone may be classed with the Low-Church or Evangelical party, although
he is in no sense a party-leader, still less an extremist. His work has been in the Church
and with the Church, and he himself is an earnest, whole-souled minister of Divine truth.

abundant in parochial labors, and at the same time has not been idle with his pen. His
principal work is the History of the Episcopal Church in Connecticut, from the ﬁrst settl.e-
ment of the Colony to the present time, in 2 vols., 8vo. He has another historical work of
equal value now nearly ﬁnished, The Life and Correspondence of the Rev. Samuel Johnson

L. D., Missionary of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, at Strat-
ford, Conn., and First President of Columbia College, New York. During a recent visit to
England, Dr. Beardsley added to his valuable original materials for this work. Besides
these two works, he has published a large number of Addresses and Sermons in pamphlet
form. A

Dr. Beardsley’s principal work, The History of the Episcopal Church in Connecticut, is the
fruit of original research, and is a most valuable contribution to the general history of the
country. The historical spirit is manifest also in his occasional addresses and sermons, and it
is very evident that he has a special vocation for the class of works which he has under-
taken.

“Dr. Beardsley possesses the historic temper, the calm and conscientious spirit which
considers facts as sacred, and reverently deals with truth. His work is a true history in its
careful examination of authorities, its clear statements of events, and its lucid and thor-
oughly readable style.” — Amerz'ca.n O'hm'chmcm,.

Dr. Tyng.

in New York, from 1845 to the present time, 1872.

Dr. Tyng early acquired a national reputation by his abilities as a preacher and his ear-
nestness and activity in religious affairs, and he has been constantly adding to it through a long
life of useful labor. I-Iis multiplied parochial duties have not prevented him from making
substantial contributions to the religious literature of the day. The following is a list of

sively of parishes in Columbus, Ohio ; Charlestown, Va., and in Philadelphia. He was killed
by an accident from a threshing-machine. He was a preacher of uncommon ability, and

614 AMERICAN LITERATURE.

Archbishop Kenrick.

THE Mosr REV. FRANCIS PATRICK KENRICI{, D. D., 1797-1863, late
Archbishop of Baltimore, Was esteemed among all denominations, Protes-
tant and Catholic, as an amiable and scholarly man, of great and varied
learning, particularly in the department of dogmatic theology. Though
earnestly devoted to the Work and the interests of his own Church, he was
not Wanting in charity and kindness to men of other creeds, as the Writer
of the present Volume takes pleasure in testifying from his own experience.

Archbishop Kenrick was born in Dublin, and educated in Rome, at the college of tlie Pro-
paganda, where, with his remarkable powers of mind, he became distinguished for his literary
and philological acquisitions and for his mastery of theology. In 1821, having received priest’s
orders, he came to Kentucky, and was made President of the Seminary at Bardstown. He
by no means, however, conﬁned himself to the duties of his professorship, but, from time to
time, took an active part in the trying missionary labors of that new diocese. After eight
ye.ars spent in such labors, he was recommended to Rome by the First Provincial Council
of Baltimore, 1829. as Bishop of Philadelphia, and was consecrated accordingly in June, 1830.
Under circumstances, at first, of peculiar diﬁiculty, he administered his diocese, for twenty-
one years, with a wisdom and ﬁrmness which, associated as they were with a quiet holiness
of life and unique attainments in ecclesiastical learning, gave him, in the hearts of Catholics,
the foremost place in the American episcopate, while his unassuming conduct and the ami-
able courtesy of his manners attracted the respect, and (in many cases) the affection of his
Protestant fellow-citizens.

‘On the death of Archbishop Eecleston, in 1851, Bishop Kenrick was transferred to the
archdiocese of Baltimore, where he remained until his death, in 1863.

In the midst of the toils and cares of the mission and of the episcopate, with an unruﬁied
calmness and self-command, which no interruption could disturb, Archbishop Kenrick
steadily pursued the congenial labors of authorship. To say nothing of his frequent contri-
butions to the weekly organ of his diocese, he produced works of standard value in the
departments of theology, of controversy, and of Biblical literature. His two greatest works
are in Latin : Theologia Dogmatica, in 4 vols., and Theologia Moralis, in 3 vols., Svo (since
reprinted at Mechlin), works in which theological knowledge, soundness of judgment, and
a tendency to a wise moderation, abhorrent of all extremes, were equally conspicuous.

Although by temper disinclined to controversy, he was induced to reply to a popular work
by Bishop Hopkins (of the Protestant Episcopal Church), in a small volume, which, several
times reprinted and enlarged, and stripped withal of every mark of its controversial origin,
has become among Catholics a standard ’_l_‘reatise on the Supremacy of the Pope.

Far more attractive than controversy—more attractive, perhaps, even than theology—-
to the mind of Archbishop Kenrick, was the study of the Holy Scriptures. Having acquired,
at the Propaganda, a competent knowledge of Hebrew and the kindred languages, he pur-
sued the work of Biblical criticism and interpr7etation at the same time with theology. The
ﬁrst fruit of these favorite studies was a new version of the Psalms, with a Commentary
rich in Wisdom and diction, which he kept by him, many years, in manuscript. After his
transfer to the older and Well-organized archiepiscopal see, which much increased his leisure
for study, he completed and published his translation of the New Testament, with a large

jbody of notes, of a practical character, in which vast patristic and biblical learning is kept

modestly in the background. The Archbishop did not rest from his labors until he had
published, with the strongest approbation of the American Episcopate, the whole of the
Bible in a new version, with a full commentary. He was the author, besides, of many volumes

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 615

of more temporary interest, of sermons, and of contributions to the periodical press, which
have not, as yet, been collected.

In a literary point of view, Archbishop Kenrick’s English writings are marked by a ﬂow-
ing sweetness and richness of style (due, in part, to his habit of writing so much in Cicero-
nian Latin), which give better evidence, at ﬁrst sight, of the Fenelon-like gentleness of his
temper and manners, than of the earnestness of his convictions and the strength and sub-
tility of his reasoning powers.

Archbishop Hughes.

THE MOST REV. J OHN HUGHES, D. D., Archbishop of New York, 17 97 —
1864;, Was one of the most conspicuous and energetic of the Catholic prelates
in the United States. His writings were chieﬂy controversial, the most
memorable being the Debates between himself and Dr. John Breckinridge,
carried on in one of the Philadelphia newspapers, and afterwards repub-
lished in book-form.

Archbishop Hughes was born in County Tyrone, Ireland. He emigrated to America in
1817, being then twenty years of age, and was engaged for a time as assistant ﬂorist or gar-
dener. The thirst for knowledge and an almost passionate desire to enter the priesthood
led him to make great labors and self-denials, and secured him at length the needed educa-
tion at Mt. St. Mary’s College, Emmetsburg. He was ordained a priest in 1825, and stationed
in Philadelphia. He became Assistant Bishop of New York in 1838; Acting Bishop, in 1839;
and Archbishop, in 1850. Among his publications is A Lecture on Christianity the Only
Source of Moral, Social, and Political Regeneration, delivered by request of Congress in the
Representatives Hall, at Washington. He had a controversy with Erastus Brooks on The
Church Property Question, and the letters on both sides were collected and published in a
volume. Numerous other pamphlets and addresses were published by him at different times.
His life, however, was one of action rather than of authorship, and the strong impress he
left upon his generation was due mainly to his talents and activity in executive adminis-
tration.

In 1861, at the beginning of the war, he and Thurlow Weed were selected by the Govern-
ment to go abroad on a conﬁdential mission, to counteract the supposed designs of the
Southern agents in Europe.

Archbishop Spalding.

THE Mos'r REV. MARTIN J OHN SPALDING, D. D., l810—18'72, late Arch-
bishop of Baltimore, made several important contributions to theological
literature, mostly of a controversial kind.

Archbishop Spalding was born near Lebanon, Marion County, Ky. He was educated,ﬁrst
at St. Mary’s Seminary, in Marion County, and then at St. Joseph’s, Bardstown, and ﬁnally
at the College of the Propaganda, in Rome, where, at the close of his course, he maintained
for seven hours a public dispute in Latin on certain theses in theology and canon law, and
received by acclamation the degree of Doctor of Divinity. On returning to the United States,
in 1834, he was made pastor of St. Joseph’s Church, and then President of St. Joseph Sem-

inary, in Bardstown; in 1843 he was called to the Cathedral in Louisville' in 1848 he was”
, ,

made titular Bishop of Leugone, as assistant to Bishop Flagct of Louisville- and in 1864 he
succeeded Kenrick as Archbishop of Baltimore. In the administration of his arclidiodese

be displayed great activity, more than twenty new churches having been erected during his
brief administration. The second Plenary Council held in the United States was convened
by him in 1866, containing forty-seven Archbishops and Bishops. In the (Ecumenical Coun-
cil, he was one of the most zealous advocates of the dogma of Papal Infallibility.

The following is a list of his chief publications : Sketches of the Early Catholic Missions of
Kentucky; The Life and Labors of Bishop Flaget; A Review of D’Aubigne’s History of the
Reformation, 1 vol., 12mo, which afterwards swelled into 2 vols., 8vo, of about 1,000 pp.,
embracing the History of the Protestant Reformation in all Countries; Miscellanea, a collec-
tion of Reviews, Essays, and Lectures on about ﬁfty different subjects, 2 vols., 8vo; Lectures
on the Evidences of Catholicity. In addition to these works he has written numerous
pastoral letters and a great number of leading articles in various Catholic newspapers and
periodicals, besides various introductions to works translated and published under his
auspices. In 1860 he delivered, in the Smithsonian Institution, a course of three lectures on
the Origin, Elements and History of Modern Civilization.

MOST REV. JOHN BAPTIST PURCELL, D.D., 1800 —, Archbishop of Cincinnati, was born in
the County of Cork, Ireland. He came to the United States in 1818; entered the Ecclesias-
tical Seminary of Mt. St. Mary’s,Md., in 1820, and the Seminary of St. Sulpice, Paris, in 1824,
and was made a priest in 1827. On returning to America he taught and ministered for a
while at Mt. St. Mary’s, and in 1833 was made Bishop of Cincinnati, where he was afterwards
made Archbishop. He had, in 1837, a seven days’ controversy — an oral discussion -with
Alexander Campbell, which was reported and published in a large volume; had also, in 1868,
a written discussion with Thomas Vickers, entitled The Roman Clergy and Free Thought;
and has issued numerous Pastorals.

Bishop England.

RT. REV. JOHN ENGLAND, DD, 17 86-1842, long Bishop of Charleston,
S. C., was held in high esteem among his fellow-citizens of all denomina-
tions. His writings have been published in eight large volumes, and form
a valuable part of the Catholic theological literature of the United States.

Bishop England was born in the city of Cork, Ireland. His studies were pursued, and
his youth and priesthood passed, in his native land, where, already admired for his elo-

' quence and earnestness of character, he did his part in advancing the piety and promot-

ing the civil and religious liberty of his suifering fellow-countrymen. In 1820, he was ap-
pointed to the See of Charleston, S. C., then constituted a bishopric. He arrived in America
at the close of that year. Here his work was emphatically that of an apostle and evangelist,
and he entered upon it with a zeal proportionate to the task. Characterized by good execu-
tive and ﬁnancial ability, he organized his diocese successfully, building churches, and
inviting various religious orders within its limits. He was conspicuous in his own juris-
diction for what he encouraged throughout the United States, the frequent summoning of
the clergy to conventions for purposes of deliberation and legislative action. He founded a
seminary for the education of ecclesiastics, and incorporated with it a classical and scientiﬁc
academy, in both of which institutions of learning‘ he himself gave instructions. He estab-
lished the United States Catholic Miscellany, a weekly periodical of merit, and supplied its
columns with a large amount of original matter, acute in its reasoning and attractive in
style. Through his inﬂuence over the community of Charleston he awakened fresh interest
in the classics. He infused new life into the Philosophical and Literary Association, of
which he continued an honored and useful member till death. He rallied about him
the chivalry of Carolina in an Anti-duelling Society, of which Gen. Thomas Pinckney, of
revolutionary fame, was the venerated President, and, through his personal activity, pre-

FROM 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. 617

vented several hostile encounters. In his pastoral relations he was kind and intelligent,
liberal of care for the poor and feeble, and, particularly in seasons of yellow fever, always
prompt to assist the sick.

His writings, which have been collected and arranged under the direction of his successor,
Bishop Reynolds, are comprised in eight volumes, royal octavo, published in Baltimore in
1849. Of these some are dogmatic and polemic, others historical, besides sermons and a few
miscellaneous productions of independent literary interest. Their chief excellence, prob-
ably, is a singular directness and clearness of statement, combined with an Irish intensity
of feeling and quickness of wit that is likely to carry the sympathies of the reader with
much that is said. Certain controversial passages are remarkable for clearness of argument
and shrewdness of thought. In places where there is room for calmer eloquence, the Bishops
breadth of mind and correctness of judgment are suﬂiciently discerned. On topics which
admit of rhetorical display ﬂights of imagination not seldom occur. As a11 orator and
public speaker Bishop England is described, by those who had the happiness to hear him,
as very effective, his delivery not falling short of his disposition of the matter of the
discourse.

Archbishop Bayley.

THE Mosr REV. J AMES RoosEvELT BAYLEY, D. D., 1814 :, Arch-
bishop of Baltimore, has long been known as one of "the most scholarly
prelates in the Catholic Episcopate in the United States.

Archbishop Bayley was born in New York city, and graduated at Trinity College, Hart-
ford, 1835. On becoming afterwards a Catholic, he pursued his theological studies at Paris
and Rome. He was ordained Priest in 1844; was Vice-President and then President of St.
John’s College, at I<‘ordha.m; became Bishop of Newark in 1853; and Archbishop of Balti-
more in 1872. -

Archbishop Bayley’s publications have been as follows : Brief Sketch of the Early History
of the Catholic Church on the Island of New York; Memoirs of Rt. Rev. S. G. Bruté,
Bishop of Vincennes. He was editor of the New York Freeman’s Journal, 1846-47, and he
has published several Pastorals. '

LEVI SILLIMAN IVES, D.D., LL.D., 1797 -—--, was born at Meriden, Conn. He became an
Episcopal clergyman in 1824, and Bishop of North Carolina in 1831. In 1852, he became a
Catholic, and soon after wrote a work, The Trials of a Mind in its Progress to Catholicism.
In addition to the work named, he has written A Manual of Devotion; The Apostles’ Doc-
trine of Fellowship; The Obedience of Faith; Humility a Ministerial Qualiﬁcation, etc.

XAVIER DONALD MCLEOD, 1821-1865, was the author of several works, historical and reli-
gious, showing scholarship and literary ability of no common order.

Mr. McLeod was born in the city of New York. He was educated an Episcopalian, and in
1845 took orders in that Church. He preached for a time in his native State, and afterwards
in North Carolina, under Bishop Ives. He left the ministry of the Episcopal Church at the
same time with his diocesan, and became a Catholic. After this he spent some years in
literaryulife, and ﬁnally, in .1860, he was admitted to the priesthood of the Catholic Church
by Bishop Purcell of Cincinnati. He was accidentally killed by the passing of a railway
train, at Sedansville, near Cincinnati, while on an errand of mercy to a poor sick woman of
his charge.

The following are Mr. McLeod’s principal publications : Pynnshurst, His Wanderings and
Way's of Thinking; The Bloodstone; Lescure, or The Last Marquis; Life of Sir Walter
Scott; Life of Mary Queen of Scots; Biography of Fernando Wood; Devotion to the Blessed.

the Catholic Church. It is a work showing much historical research.

REV. THOMAS S. PRESTON, 1824 ——, was born in Hartford, Conn., and graduated in 1843,
in Trinity College, of that place. He entered the Episcopal ministry in 1846, changed to
the Catholic Church in 1849, and became priest in 1850. He is pastor of St. Ann’s church,
New York, and Chancellor of the New York Diocese. He has published the following: Ark

Unity; Reason and Revelation ; Christ and the Church.

REV. ISAAC THOMAS HECKER, 1819 ——-, popularly known as Father Hecker, and founder of
the Society of the Paulists in New York, was born and educated in that city, and entered into
business there with his brothers, in the milling and baking establishment of Hecker &
Brothers. In 1843 he joined the Brook Farm Association, in West Roxbury, Mass., and after-
wards spent some time with the Consociate Family, at Fruitlands, Worcester County, Mass.
Returning thence to New York, he was in 1845 received into the Catholic Church, and desir-
ing to join the Redemptionists, he passed his noviti-ate in St. Trond, Belgium, and was ad-
mitted to the order in 1847. In 1849 he was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Wiseman,
in London. In 1851 he returned to New York, and for the next seven years was employed
in missionary labors in various parts of the United States. In 1858, he and several of his
associates were released by tl1e Pope from their connection with the Redemptionists, and
were authorized to form the new association of the Paulists, which has been very active as
a publication society.

FRO?» 1850 TO THE PRESENT TIME. G19

CHARLES CONSTANTINE PISE, D.D., 1802-1866, was born in Annapolis, Md., educated at
Georgetown College, and ordained to the Catholic priesthood. He was a scholarly man, and
gave much time to literary pursuits. He Wrote_A History of the Church from its Establish-
ment to the Reformation, 5 vols., 8vo; Aletheia, or Letters on the Truth of Catholic Doc-
trines; The Acts of the Apostles, done into Blank Verse; Pleasures of Religion and Other
Poems ; Father Rowland ; Indian College; Letters to Ada; Christianity and the Church, etc.

PETER FREDET, D. D., 1801-1856, was born at Cabazat, France, and educated, ﬁrst at the
Theological Seminary of Clermont-Ferrand, and then at Sulpice, Paris, and taught theology
in France. He came to America in 1831, and was Professor of Theology, Holy Scripture,
and Ecclesiastical History, in St. Mary’s College, Baltimore, until his death. He published
the following: A Treatise on the Eucharistic Mystery ; Ancient History ; Modern History.
Of the last two, many editions have been printed.

Brownson.

ORESTES AUGUSTUS BRowNsoN, LL. D., 1803—18’7 6, editor of Brownson’s
Review, was the ablest and the best known lay Writer among American
Catholics.

Dr. Brownson probably gained in celebrity and lost in inﬂuence by his frequent changes
of opinion on cardinal points of doctrine,——having been successively a Calvinistic divine,
a Universalist, a Deist, again a Calvinist, and lastly a Catholic, and having at each stage
of belief been a loud and earnest advocate of whatever were his opinions for the time.
Dr. Brownson never entered the priesthood of the Catholic Church, but advocated its prin-
ciples in his capacity as a layman. His ability as a writer and thinker has never been
called in question. He thinks boldly, and expresses himself with remarkable clcarness and
vigor. ' His writings have appeared chieﬂy in the Christian Examiner, the Boston Quarterly
Review (begun by himself), the Democratic Review (in which the preceding was merged),
and Brownson’s Quarterly, conducted by himself.

Charles Elwood, or the Inﬁdel Converted, is a novel describing his own religious expe-
rience. The Covenant, or Leaves from my Experience, is another work of the same character.
Dr. Brownson supported his Review almost single-handed for a long series of years, devoting
himself chieﬂy- to the advocacy and defence of the doctrines of the Catholic Church, but
discussing also questions of politics and literature.

RT. REV. JOHN MCGILL, D. D., 1809 ——, Bishop of Richmond, was ordained a priest in the
Catholic Church, in 1885. After ministering in Lexington and Louisville, Ky., he was in
1850 made Bishop ofrRichmond. Bishop McGill has published the following works: The Life
of John Calvin, translated from the French: The Origin of the Church of England, as repre-
sented in Macaulay’s History ; The True Church Indicated to the Inquirer; Our Faith the
Victory.

RICHARD H. CLARKE, LL. D., 1827 -:,‘was born in Washington, D. 0., and graduated at
Georgetown College, in 1846, where also he took, in 1872, the honorary degree of Doctorof
Laws. Mr. Clarke practised law in Washington, 1848-1864; and in New York since 1864.
He has published Memoirs of a large number of eminent Americans belonging to the
Catholic Church, and many articles and addresses which have received attention. But his
crowning work is a publication just completed, in 1872, in two large 8vo volumes, The Lives
of the Deceased Bishops of the Catholic Church in the United States.

REV. JOSEPH M. FINOTTI, —— —-—, of Brookline, Mass., has in press an important work,
Bibliographia Catholica Americana.
