INTRODUCTION.
GEOGRAPHY is a lescription of the world, with its inhabitants and
productions. It is not only an entertaining and curious, but highly
useful study. It opens and enlarges the mind; gives a true knowledge
of the various situations of countries, with their rivers, mountains, &amp;c.;
and is of such importance in history, that withlout it, nothing can be
understood with either satisfaction or correctness.
It must have attracted the attention of mankind at a very early period. The desire to become acquainted withi the country they lived in,
and to determine and establish its boundaries, would naturally direct
their attention to it.
The study of Geography will enable young persons, when they hlear
of distant countries, to tell whlere they are situated-what are their productions-how they are governed, and what kind of people live there.
To know these tilings is very important; and will give all who are
acquainted with them an advantage over those who possess not such
knowledge: it will be a satisfaction to themselves and to their parents;
and will be a proof that they have attended well to their studies.
TO THE PUPIL
The engraving on the opposite page is a picture of one side of our
earth, as it would appear if seen firom a great distance. It rolls like an
imrnmense ball through the heavens, surrounded on every side by the
planets and the countless myriads of stars, all performing their stated
motions under the guidance of the great Creator who first called them
into existence.
Men live on, and are constantly walking about, this great ball, the
earth. Cities and towns are built on it; trees and plants grow on it;
and ships sail on the sea: yet the earth is all the time turning round
and round, as if you rolled a ball or an apple on the floor, or threw it from
you into the air. All this is trae; but it is hard -to understand. It is
done by the power of God, who made us, and all thiings on the earth'
with the sun, the moon, and the vast multitude of stars we see in the
sky. "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth; the
heavens, and all the bost of them." Gen. I. II.

NOVA SCOTIA.
1. NOVA SCOTIA was first settled by the French, and named
by them Acadia.     In 1763 it was conquered by Great Britain, and since that time has been called by its present name.
2. It is a large peninsula, 280 miles long, and from 50 to
100 broad.    On the coast the soil is generallv poor, but in the
interior and northern parts it is well adapted to cultivation.
3. Wheat and other grains, withl potatoes of the finest quality, are
raised to some extent. Coal, and gypsum, or plaster of paris, are found
in vast quantities, and are largely exported: copper, iron, and various
other minerals, also abound.
4. Halifax, the capital, is situated on one of the finest harbours in the
world, and conttains the roost extensive dock-yard ill British Amnerica.
Lunenburg, Liverpool, Yarmouth, and Pictou, are all places of some
trade; firom the latter, coal is shipped to thae United States in considerable quantities.
5. CAPE B RETON IsLAND.-Cape Breton is a large Island,
separated from Nova Scotia by the Gut or Strait of Canseau; *
it is about 100 miles in length, and from 30 to 80 in breadth,
and is divided into two nearly equal portions by an arm of' the
sea called the Bras d'Or.
6. Agriculture is in a backward state, the Cod Fishery attracting the
chief inrdustry of the people. This island was in 1820 politically attached'to Nova Scotia, and sends two members to the louse of Assembly.
7. Louisburg, which the French carefillly fortified, was once a place
of great importance, but it is now entirely deserted; and Sidney, a village of about 800 inhabitants, is all the capital Cape Bretonll possesses.

9. PRINCE EDwVARD'S ISLANtD.-Prince Edward's is a fine
fertile island in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, lying nearly parallel
to the coasts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
10. Thie soil is good and well adapted to agriculture, which is in a
more improved state than in any of the neihlbouring colonies. Charlotte Tl'own is the capital, withl 3,500 inhabitants. T'here are several othier
small towns.
NEWFOUNDLAND.
1. NEWvFOUINDLAND is a large island, situated at the mouth
of the GuLlf of St. Lawrence, and forming the most eastern part
of British.America.   The soil is mostly barren, and the timber
scanty and of small size.
2. It owes its importance to its Cod fisheries, which are the
most valuable in the world.     The fish are caught in vast
numbers upon certain shallow places in the sea in the vicinity
of the island, called the Banks of Newfoundland.
3. A great numnber of vessels and menl (chiefly American and French)
here find emrnployment, while the inhabitants of the island carry on their
fislheries alonog the shore.
4.'I'he fishiing business is dangerous, but profitable; it is an admiiriable
nursery for the hardy seamnen of thle New England states, and furnishes
us withi an imnportant article of export to othler counjtries.
5. St. Johl's is the principal place in the island; the houses are all
built of wood, and the townr has in consequence suffered severely from
fires. HarbouLr Grace is, next to St. Johln's, the mnost important town.

UNITED STATES.
1. THE UNITED STATES form one government, comprising
twenty-six states, six territories, and one federal district. They
occupy the most valuable and productive part of Northl America, and rank amongst the most powerful, commercial, and
wealthy nations of the globe.
2. They are distinguished for the freedom and excellence
of their political institutions, the rapid increase of the population, and for the intelligence, industry, and enterprise of the
inhabitants.
3. The teiritory of the United States is very extensive; it
ranges through 29 degrees of latitude, and 58 degrees of
longitude.  The frontier outline has an extent of 10,000 miles,
and a line drawn from north-west to south-east would measure 3,200 miles.
4. In so vast a region there is of course included a great
variety of surface, soil, and climate. It is well watered by
noble streams, which not only give fertility to their borders,

but are ready to carry the gifts of the earth to the ocean, and
to bring back to the inhlabitants the products of other climes.
5. The soil returns an ample harvest for all that is planted
in it, and the climate is favourable to nearly every production
of the earth, that can sustain life or increase its luxuries.
6. Agriculture is the leading pursuit in this country. Thle eastern
states are devoted to grazing, aid tihe dairy; the middle and western to
the raising of wlieat, indian corny, &amp;c.; and the southernl states, to cotton, tobacco, sugar, and rice. Slve labour is chiefly employed in thle
southern and sonne of the western states.
7. The United Stats  are ricly supplied with valuable minerals.
Gold, the mnost piecious, and iron, the niost useful of imetals, with lead,
coal, salt, and litune, all exist, miiost of tlhem in great abundance; while
beauti[ul and durable building nmaterials are firnished by the extensive
quarries of tllhe different sectionIs of the Union.
S. The ruanufltures are already. extensive, and are rapidly increasing: they amount iri vllue, annually, to about 320 miillionls of' dollars,
and the capital invested in all the manufactures in the Uiiion, is supposed
not to be less than 1,000 millions of dollars.
9. The cornmmerce is, next to thlat of Great Britain, the largest in the
world; it extends to all parts of the earthl, and embrbaces the products
anid manufactures of all nations. The nurnmber of vessels thlat enter and
depart from the ports of thle United States, a-mounts from 20,000 to
23,000 every year.
74
10. The Fisheries are highly important, and are carried on mostly
by the New England states: they embrace chiefly the whale, cod, and
niackerel fisheries, time products of whliicli amount to from 6 to 9 millions
of dollars, annually.
11. The whale fishery alone employs inmore than 140,000 tons of shipping, and 10,000 men. The ships employed in this business, are absent
frequently two and three years.
12. No part of the world presents such an extensive inland commerce
as that of the United States. Steam vessels navigate all the principal
rivers. lakes, bays, &amp;ec. The Mississippi River and its tributaries alone
are traversed by near 300 steamboats, all of which make several voyages
every year.

cipal elements of American prosperity. 1300 steamboats have been
buLilt since the year 1807, of whilch 800 now exist; and the lnumnber of
steam-engines in the United States employed in steamboats, locomotive
rail-road cars, and for various manufacturing purposes, is not less than
3,000.
-14. The Amnericanls have surpassed all other' nations in the numnber
and extent of their canals and rail-roads; the unrited length of the former
is not less than 3,600 miles, the whlole of which, with one or two exceptions, have been executed in less than twenty years.
15. The rail-roads, all constructed within the last ten years, amount
to an aggregate of 1,500 miles, over which carriages are propelled by
locomotive steam-engines at the rate of from 20 to 30 miles an hour.
16. The United States are more distinguished for tile general diffusion of knowledge, than for eminence in literature and science. TI'he
means of common school education are more widely extended than in
any other part of the world, and there are numnerous seminaries of Clearning throughout the country, thoulgh there are no universities and colleges
on so large a scale as some in Europe.
17. The general government of the United States has done but little.
for the promotion of public instruction; but most of the states have made
legislative provision, and some have large funds set apart, for that purpose. The first settlers of New England paid a very laudatble attention to this important subject; and so early as the year 1628, a law was
passed for the education of every child in the colonies.

18. There is no established church in the IJUnited States, religion being
left to the voluntary chloice of the people; yet jn all the well-settled parts
of the UtJnion, religious instruction ansd observLnces are as faithfully dis- 5
pensed and performed as in any other country in the world.
19. Thie great body of }he people are attached to the various sects  
belonging to the Protestaht faith: of these the Baptists, Methodists, /~
Presbyterian~, an  Lutherd'nAs, staid first as to numrbers. There are
also mnany CathOlics, Episcopaliaiis, Universalists, Unlitarianis, and
Friends, or Quakers. v
20. The United States is a Federal Republic.  Each state is inde-  
pendent in its local affairs; but the defence of the country, the regulation  
of cormmierce, and all the general concerns of the Union, are committed
by the Constitutioni to a general govenrnment.
21.  e government omprises three distinct powers, the Legislative,
Judicial and ExecuivS braniches: the first named power nmakes the
laws, the second expounds, and the last execedtes them.
22. Thie Legislative power is vested in a Congress consisting of a
Senate and House of Representatives. The Senate consists of two
niembers from each state, whlo are elected for six years, one-third of the
iiurriber being changed every two years. The members of the House
of Representatives are elected by the people for two years; their number
is, at present, 240.                       A
23. The Judicial power is composed of a Supremne Court of onre chief
and eighlt associate Judges, who are appointed by the President, with the
advice and consent of the Senate, and hold their offices during life or
good behaviour.  7
24. The Executive power is vested in a President, lho, together with
the Vice-Presiderit, is choserncfor four years by electors from  all the
states.  I'Thle principal subordinate officers of the executive department
are the Secre ary of State, of the TrealirEy, of War, and of the Navy,
the Post-Ma/s- r General, and the Attorrry-General. They are all removable at the will of the President, and, with the Vice President, form
the Cabinet. 4  
25. The inhabitants of the United States may be esti,nated at about
sixteen'and a half millions, of which the black or coloured races form
one-sixth part. The Indians numnber about 300,000, but are miot usually
considered as forming a part of the population of the Union.

26. This allmount, in proportion to the vast territory over which it is
spread, is snmall, compared with the dense population of some of the
European states; but when it is considered that the inhabitants of the
colonies 100 years ago numbered but 1,000,000, it presents the most
striking instance of national growth to be found in the history of mankind.
76
27. The United States were formerly colonies or provinces of Great
Britain. In the year 1775 there,were thirteen colonies, with a polpulation of nearly tlhree millions of people. At thlat time they took up arms
for the putrpose of separating themnselves fiom the mother country.
28. They were incited to this by thie injustice of Great Britain, who
taxed the people of the colonies without tlheir consent, and passed various
oppressive laws, to which they would not submit.
Battle of Lexington.
29. The first battle between the Colonists and the British troops, took
place at Lexington, Massachusetts, April 19th, 1775. On the 4th of
July, 1776, they declared theisselves inrdependent, under the title of the
United States of America.

Resignation of General Washington
31. At the close of the Revolutionary War, the American Army,
though suffering great privations, disbanded, without violence or disorder; and the Comniander in Chief, General Washington, resigned the
almost absolute power he possessed to the authority that conferred it,
thus presenting to the world the rare example of a great military chlief
descending voluntarily to the rankl of a private citizen.
32. The Constitution of thle United States was framed and adopted
ill 1789, and has since been amended. It secures to the people the
grand principles of freedom, liberty of conscience in matters of religioln,
liberty of the press, trial by jury, and the right of choosing and of being
chosen to office. The Presidents of the United States since the adoption of the Constitution, are as follows:
33.     1. George Washington, of Vir. from 1789 to 1797-8 years.
2. John Adamn,            Mass.     1797 to 1801-4

2. The surface of New England is greatly varied; much
of the soil is good, yet, in general, it requires diligent cultivation, and comnpels the farmer to utse considerable industry to
procure good crops.
3. Horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs, are reared in great
numbers; and grass, Indian corn, wheat, r-ye, oats, barley,
flax, and hemp, are extenrsively cultivated.  The principal
fruits are apples, pears, peaches, plums, &amp;c.

carried on chiefly through the cities of New York and Phila.
delphia.  The internal trade is greatly facilitated by the
ltnumerous canals and rail-roads which extend through the
different parts of the country.
7. The manufactures are important and various; a vast
amount of capital and labour is employed in their fabrication,
and thousands of both sexes are supported by them.
S. In the Middle States common-school education is not so
general as in most parts of New England, except in the state
of New York, where great attention has been paid to the
subject.
9. In Pennsylvania a system has been lately adopted that will afford
the means of education to all classes of the people; but in New Jersey
and Delaware, the plans pursued for that purpose have not as yet proved
very efficient.
91
10. The great body of the people in the Middle States are of British
descent; but in some parts of Pennsylvania there are many Germans,
who speak only their own language, and are often ignorant of the
English tongue. In New York and New Jersey, there are a number
of the descendants of the original Dutch settlers of New York, and in
some sections that language is partially spoken.
11. At the close of the revolutionary war, so many emigrants from
the eastern states settled in New York, that a majority of the present
population of that state are natives of New England, or their descendants. These, by their industrious habits, their enterprise and general
intelligence, have contributed much to the prosperity of that section of
the Union.

NEW YORK.
View of the lower part of the City of New York.
1. NEw YORK is the most flourishing, wealthy, and popu.
lous state in the Union. It exhibits one of those amazing examples of growth and prosperity that are no where seen on
the globe beyond our own borders.
New. York. Q. -1. What is New York? What does it exhibit?126             DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY.
2. The northern portion of the state is, in part, mountainious, and but thinly settled; the eastern is hilly, and tolerably
productive; while the western part is level, remarkably fertile, and increasing rapidly in population.
3. The agriculture is well conducted.  Wheat is the chief
staple; but corn, rye, and other grains, are extensively cultivated. The flour is of excellent quality; and, with other provisions, is largely exported.
4. The manufactures are extensive and flourishing, and the
commerce of the state is on a great scale.  Near three-fifths
of the imports, and more than one-fburth of the exports of the
Union, are made by New York alone.
-   5. Iron ore is found in great abundance, and lead, gypsum,
and limestone, also abound. There are numerous and important salt springs at various places. -The principal are at
Salina and Syracuse, where more than two million bushels of
salt are made annually.
6. The mineral springs of Ballston and Saratoga are well
known thiroughout the Union for their medicinal qualities, and
are much visited from  all quarters.  The waters are largely
exported to the other states, and even to foreign countries.
7. This state shares with Upper Canada the Falls of Niagara, one Qf
the greatest wonders of the western continent. TI'he widest and most
imposing part of this cataract is on the Canadian side; while that on
thie New York side, though narrower, is several feet higher than the
other.
S. New York is distinguished for its magnificent public
works, of which the Erie, or Great Western Canal, is the
largest in the state, and one of the principal works of the
kiind in the world.
9. The success attending its completion and use, fully convinced the
people of the United States of the advantages of works of internal improvement. There are, likewise, a number of other canals, and also
rail-roads, in successful operation, besides some that are partially coin
pleted.

children are taught annually in the common schools; and
there are, also, 200 academies, 5 colleges and a university.
11. The people of New York, during the revolutionary war, strenuously opposed the arbitrary measures of the British government. The

with other memorable events, took place within its limits.
12. The city of New Yorkli is situated on the southern end of Manhattan island, at the junlction of the Hudson and East rivers. It is the
great,commercial emporium of America; and is, next to London, the
greatest in the world. Its progress in population has never been surpassed. Since 1796, it has, including Brooklyn, increased nearly ten-fold.
13. The foreign, coasting, and inland trade of this city is imnmense:
regular packets are constanltly trading with various ports in Europe, the
West Indies, South America, and all the important sea-ports in the
United States.
The successful steam voyages across the Atlantic Ocean lately performed by the Great
Western, and other
vessels of the same
kind, form an era
in commercial intercourse that will
tend greatly to the
advantage of New
York.
15. Its public
buildings are numerous, and mnany of
them elegant. The
City Hall, new Custom House, MerCity Hall. New York.

Union, and are rapidly increasing the trade and commerce
of the state.
6. No general system of education was adopted in Pennsylvania till 1834. Since that period, the numrber of schools
and scholars has greatly increased. Besides more than five
thousand common schools, there are two Universities, nine
Colleges, and a number of respectable academies in the state.
Girard College.
7. The Girard College, for orphans, near Philadelphia, was endowed
by the munificence of a private individual, Stephen Girard, who died in
1832, and left two millions of dollars for the purpose of erecting and
supporting the institution.

deep; carries 140 guns, and is 3,306 tons in burthlen.
17. Pittsburg, situated at the head of the Ohlio river, is greatly distinguished for its numerous manufactories, and its extensive inland
trade. Thle surrounding country abounds in bituminous coal, and the
constant use of that fuel causes a perpetual cloud of smoke to hang over
the town. Alleghany and Birmingham are considered suburbs of Pittsburg, and are connected with it by bridges.
18. Lancaster is a flourishing city, and is situated in the midst of a
rich and fertile country. Reading, Easton, Lebanon, Carlisle, Pottsville,

DELAWARE.
1. DELAWARE is the smallest in population, and, except
Rhode Island, the least in extent, of any state in the Union.
Its general aspect is that of an extended plain mostly favourable for cultivation.
2. The chief products are wheat and Indian corn, of
which the former is generally of excellent quality. Brandywine creek, in the upper part of the state, supplies extensive
water-power for a number of large manufacturing establisihmnents. The principal articles furnished by these, are flour,
corn-meal, cotton and woollen goods, paper, and gunpowder.

facilitated by the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, and two
rail-roads which extend across it.
4. Near Lewistown, an important national work, the Delaware Breakwater, has been erected, for thle purpose of affording a shelter to vessels
in stormy weather. The work consists of two piers, an ice-breaker
1700 feet, and a break-water 2800 feet long. The cost of the whole is
estimated at three millions of dollars.
5. Wilmington is the largest and most important place in the state.
It is a well-built and growing town, and contains a United States'
arsenal, several banks, a number of churches, &amp;c., and is supplied with
water by works on the Brandywine. It has considerable trade, with
some manufactures, and sends several ships to the whale fishery.
6. Dover, the seat of government, is situated on Jones's creek, and
contains a handsome State House. New Castle, Georgetown, and
Smyrna, are places of some note. Lewistovwn, near the entrance to
Delaware Bay, is the oldest town in the state, being originally settled
by the Swedes and Finns.

States is raised here; which, with sugar and rice, is confined
to its southern section.  In the northern, the principal productions are tobacco, wheat, and corn.
7. Gold abounds in nearly all the Atlantic States of this
region; but is almost exclusively confined to the upper and
middle portions of the country. This metal is now so extensively found, as to have become an object of national importance.
8. The gold region embraces a great extent of country, and reaches
from Virginia, through North and South Carolina, and Georgia, to
Alabama.

Indian corn is raised to some extent; but, in general, the
quantity is not sufficient to supply the state.
3. Some sugar has been produced in the southern counties,
but the cane does not appear to thrive.  Sweet potatoes, with
the peach, fig, and other fruits, grow in abundance.  Several
important rail.roads have been projected, and some of them
are in progress.
4. Mississippi is now entirely under the control of a white population. The northern and central parts of the state were lately occupied
by the Choctaw and Chickasaw Indians; but these have nearly all
removed to the Indian territory.

2. The climate is said to be more mild than in the same
latitude on the eastern side of the continent.  In many parts
the soil is fertile, and well adapted to farming.  WVheat, corn,
fruits, and vegetables, are raised of excellent quality. Pine
trees of enormous bulk grow on the banks of the Columbia
river, and many of themn attainr a height of 250 feet.

present actually inr possession of Great Britain. The traders
of the "Hudson's Bay Company" have established forts at
various points, and exercise an almost urnlimited control over
the natives.  Forts Vancouver, Wallah-Wallah, and Colville,
are thie chl-ief trading stations.
4. At Fort Vancouver is a village containing, fifty houLses, with 800

REPUBLIC OF TEXAS.
I 1. TEXAS formed, in conjunction with Coahuila, one of the
states of the Mexican Republic. In 1836, the people declared themselves independent, and adopted a form of government, with a President and Congress, similar to that of the
United States.
2. The climate is mild and healthful.    The face of the
country consists chiefly of vast prairies, the soil of which is
exceedingly fertile, and produces in abundance cotton, tobacco,
sugar, rice, wheat, &amp;c.
3. Texas is one of the finest countries in the world for
raising cattle. Pasturage being, very plentiful, they increase
rapidly, and great numbers of them   are driven every year
into the United States, for sale.
4. Vast herds of buffalo, deer, and mustangs or wild horses, roam
over the unsettled prairies of the interior. Numbers of the latter are
taken with a leather thong or rope, with a running noose at the end of'
it, and being properly broke are rendered serviceable, either as draught
or saddle horses.

have emigrated from the United States. There are, also, some Mexican
Creoles, Negro slaves, and Indians. The whole amounts, probably, to
100,000; of which the first named constitute about two-thirds of the
number.
6. The principal towns are Brazoria, Matagorda, San Felipe, Nacogdoches, San Augustine, and Galveston. Houston was lately the capital;
but Austin is now the seat of government.
7. The commerce of this youthful state is already sufficient to employ, to advantage, a number of trading vessels between her principal
comrnmercial towns and New Orleans; and foreign vessels are beginning
to carry the products of tllhe republic to European ports.

MEXICO.
I. Mrl xIco is an extensive territory, comprising a number
of divisions called states or departments.    Previous to the
year.-1835, it was a Federal government, somewhat similar
to that of the United States; but it is noow a central or consolidated republic.
2. Most of the surface of the country is elevated; a great
part of it forming a high table-land of from   6000 to 8000
feet in height. From this elevated plain, a few volcanic peaks
shoot up to a still greater height.   The chief of these,are
Popocatapetl, Orizava, Toluca, &amp;c.

4. Indian-corn is the staple article; of which, two and
sometimes three crops are gathered in the couLrse of the year.
Wheat, rice, and barley, are also cultivated; and sugar, col
fee, tobacco, vanilla, cochineal, &amp;c., are raised chiefly for
internal consumption.
5. The American Aloe, or Maguey plant, is extensively cultivated
for the sake of its juice, of which the liquor called pulque the favourite
drinkli of the lower order of Mexicans, is made.
6. The manufactures of Mexico are in a rude state, and
are chiefly confined to coarse pottery, with glass-ware, and
cotton and woollen goods. Silver plate and jewellery are,
howvever, well and skilfully made.
7. The commerce has never corresponded with the extent
and resources of the country. The mines of gold and silver
have always been the chief object of attention.
8. Many of these are at present in a ruinous state, and those that are
worked do not yield more than half their former amount. From 20 to
25 millions of dollars were once obtained firom the mines of Mexico
annually, which is now reduced to 10 or 12 mnillions.

9. There are three classes of inhabitants in Mexico; the Whites or
Creoles, the Indians, and the mixed races. The latter comprise
Mestizoes, or the descendants of whites and Indians; 11ulattoes, of white
and negroes; and Zamvboes, of Indians and nregroes. These races were
once as distincet from each other as if they had belonged to different
nations-but the Ptevolution has placed all classes on an equal footing,
and men of all complexions,are alike free.
10. The Catholic religion is established by law, and is the only system
tolerated in Mexico. The number of the clergy, including all belonging to the church, amounts to about 14,000 persons. The amusements
of the people are chiefly those of Old Spain; bull-fighlts, and religious
processions.
11. At the time of the discovery of America, Mexico formed the
most powerful of the native empires. Being conquered by Spain, it
remained for 300 years the most important colony belonging to that
crown. In the year 1821, the people declared themselves independent,
and established a republican form of government; but like all the
Spanish American States, this country has been, since the revolution,
mnuch distracted by civil war.
City of Mexico.
12. The city of Mexico, the capital, is situated in a delightful valley,
which is elevated 7000 feet above the sea, and in the vicinity of several
of the highest mountains in North America. It is distinguished for the
beauty of its architecture, the regularity of its streets, and the extent
of the squares and public places. The market is well supplied with
all the animal and vegetable productions of the country; many of the
latter are raised on floating gardens in the neighbouring lakes.
13. La Puebla is next to the capital in importance, and is noted for
its manufactures of glass and earthenware. Guanaxuato, Zacatecas,
and San Luis Potosi, are all connected with rich silver mines. Near
the first are the great mines of Valenciana, which in 37 years yielded
165 millionis of dollars.

14. Cholula, the ancient capital of a great independent republic, has
declined into an unimportant town, containing 6,000 souls. The pyramnid of Cholula is the work of art, which, next to the pyramids of Egypt,
approaches nearest in magnitude and vastness to those of nature. It is
composed of brick, and though only about one-third as high as the Great
Pyramid, is nearly double the length.
15. The chief sea-ports are, Vera Cruz and Tampico, on the Gulf of
Mexico; Acapulco and San-Bias, on the west coast; and Guyamas, on the
Gulf of California. Monterey is the principal place in Upper California,
and is often visited by American whale-ships.  Santa F6, in New
Mlexico, is the centre of the trade withl Missouri.
16. BALIZE SETTLEMENT.-ON the east side of the Peninsula of Yucatan is the Balize Settlement, which, though within
the limits of Mexico, belongs to Great Britain.
17. It extends along the Bay of Honduras about 150 miles; and was
founded for the purpose of cutting logwood and mahogany, which form
its chief products. The inhabitants are mostly Indians and Negroes,
with a few whites. The town of Balize, the capital, is situated on the
river of the same name. The exports from this place in 1830, were of
the value of a million and a half of dollars.

GUATIMALA, OR CENTRAL AMERICA.
1. GtJAT   ALA  occupies the narrow    tr4ct betwveen the
norlthern and southern divisions of the' Western Continenat;
and has,,j consequence of its position, assumed the title of
the United States of Central America.
2. It became independent in 1824, and adopted a fobrm of
government modclelled after that of the United States; but
instead of acquiring the order and prosperity of that repub.
lic, it is the seat of anar7chy and civil war.
3. The country is traversed on the western coast by lofty ranges of
mountains, which contain many volcan4es, one of which, the Water
Volc no, is remalrklable for throwing out vast quantities of water; wili]e
the eruptions of another, the volcano of Cosiguina, were, in 1834, heard
1000 miles distant, and the ashes thrown by it were carried to Jamaica,

WEST INDIES.
1. TiE West Indies consist of a large collection of islands,
situated between North and South America. They are all,
with the exception of Hayti, subject to different European
powers.
2. These Islands comprise four great divisions: the Bahama Islands, the Great Antilles, the Little Antilles, and the
Caribbee Islands. The latter are divided into two groups,
the Wintdward and Leeward Islands.
3. The climate is mild anid pleasant in winter, which lasts

from December to May; but the remainder of the year is hot
and unhealthy for strangers.  Between August and October,
tremendous hurricanes or storms sometimes occur, which often
do great injury to towns, houses, and shipping.
4. The West Indies abound in nearly all the productions
of warm climates, and are rich in a variety of articles of
great importance in commerce; while the forests furnish
mnahogany and several other woods useful in the arts.
5. The principal fruits are, oranges, lemons, pine-apples, papaws,
bananas, plantains, &amp;c. The two last afford a supply of excellent
food, with but little attention to their cultivation. A great variety
of birds is found in the West Indies, nearly all of which are, however,
common to the neighbouring continents.
6. The green turtle and guana lizard are both highly prized, as affording delicious food. The former are sent in considerable numbers to
Europe and the United States. They come on shore in the night, when
the fishermeni turn them oni their backs, and collect them at leisure.
The guana is from four to five feet long; it is very nimble, anld is hunted with dogs. The flesh is tender, sweet, and delicate.
7. Commerce is carried on from the West India Islands
with great activity, and to a larger amount than in any other
country of the same extent and population.
8. The chief articles of export are, coffee, sugar, rum, cotton, cocoa, pimento, mahogany, logwood, &amp;c. The imports
are, manufactured goods of alt kinds from Europe, with flour,
lumber, fish, and salted provisions from    the United States
and British America.

10. The inhabitants of the West Indies consist of whites,
free blacks, and slaves, of whom not more than 500,000 are
whites.  The remainder are of Negro origin; and, except in

13. Cuba, the largest 6f the West India Islands, is niearly equal in
extent to all the rest of the islands taken together. Porto Rico contains
about one-tenth the area of Cuba. They are both fertile islands, and
carry on an extensive trade, chiefly with the United States.
14. Havannah, the capital of Cuba, is the largest and most flourishing place in the West Indies. Matanzas, Puerto Principe, and St.
Jago de Cuba, are, after the capital, the most important towns. St.
John's is the chief town in Porto Rico. It has a safe and capacious
harbour, and is strongly fortified.

25. Hayti was formerly called Ilispaniola, and also St.
Domingo. It is one of the finest of the West India Islands,
and once belonged jointly to France and Spain.      The French
portion was uncommonly flourishing, and the exports were
nearly equal to that of all the other West India Islands united.
In 1791, an insurrection of the negroes broke out in the French part
of the island. In 1793, the slaves were emancipated by a decree of the
French National Assembly. In 1801, the independence of Hayti was
declared; and in 1822, the Spaniards were expelled fromll the island:
since which time, it has been entirely under the control of the coloured
population.

fact, a military despotism. The President holds his office for life. The
regular army amounts to 45,000 men, besides which there is a large
militia force.
28. The annual exports are about 4,000,000 dollars, or one-sixth of
the value of those sent from the French part of the island only, previous
to the year 1791.

vegetable productions are numerous and valuable, and comprise the chief articles raised in tropical and temperate regions.
4. The principal mountains are the Andes, which range
along the whole extent of the western shores of the continent,
from north to south. The highest peak, Mount Sorata, is almost five miles high. The mountains of Brazil extend along
a great part of the eastern coast, and are in height from 8,000
to 6,000 feet.
5. The Andes contain numerous volcanoes, many of which
are constantly burning: the most considerable of these, Cotopaxi, near Quito, is one of the loftiest volcanoes in the vworld;
the noise of its eruptions has been heard six hundred miles,
and the flamnes fromn its mouth have been kInown to ascend
more than half a mile high.

South American Forest.
T.he forests of many parts of South America exhibit a luxuriance
and diversity of aspect different from those of most other parts of the
world. They ale cnlivened by a great variety of birds of singular 2orms
and superb plumage, which flutter through the brancies-- and troops
of monkeolys and squirrels, that leap from bo,g.h to bough; while the
occasional appearance of the anlligat,r, ivith numerous serpents and
5zards, presents a, singular and,;atried scene.
Lama.                            Tapir.
8. Among the most remarkable animals of this continent, are the
jaguar, puma and ocelot, the lama or South American camel, the tapir,
peccary, sloth, ant-eater, armadillo, and chinchilla. The horse, ox, ass,
and hog, were all strangers to the New World, and were brought from
Europe by the first settlers: these have increased prodigiously, and have
an some instances regaiined their original wild state.
9. The birds are numerous and of various kinds; thle largest are the
rhea or American ostrich, and the condor or vulture of the Andes, which
is the largest bird of flight known. There are also toucans, orioles or

-... The inhabitants of South America amount to about 14
millions, asfc,t_tsist of nearly the same classes as those of
the northern division ofl the continent-Whites, Indians, Negroes, and the mixed races: the latter comprise Mulattoes,
Mestizoes, and Zamboes..11. The whites are cliefly Spaniards anld YPortuguese, and
their descendants: of these, many of the wealthy classes are
well educated and intelligent; but the great majority of the
people are ignorant, indolent, and often vicious in their habits.
12. Considerable attention has been lately paid in some of the South
American States to education. Schools and universities have been established in several places, and knowledge is beginning to dispel part
of the ignorance whlich prevailed.
13. Nearly the whole of Soothl America was, for three hundred years
subject to Spain and Portugal: it is now, with the exception of Guiana,
entirely independent of European control. The Spanish part is divided,
with one exception, into a number of distinct republics, whose govern
ments are similar to that of the United States; while Brazil, the part
settled by the Portuguese, is a limited monarchy.
14. The Catholic is the establishled religion in all the South American

COLOMBIA.
1. TiHE late Republic of Colombia occupied an extensive
region stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. It
was the most powerful of the South American States that
threw off the yoke of Spain, and was divided in the year 1831
into the republics of New Grenada, Venezutela, and Ecuador,
or Qulito.
2. The western part of this territory is traversed by some
of the loftiest ranges of the Andes.   In the east it consists
of extensive plains (called llanos by the inhabitants) which
form a part of the vast level region that spreads from  north
to south over the whole interior part of the continent.
3. The climate changes according to the elevation, hence
the vegetable productions are various.    On the high tablelands, among the mountains, are raised the wheat, rye, barley,
oats, and fruits of temperate climates, while the low country
is prolific in the most valuable products of the Torrid Zone.
41. Manufactures are but little attended to in Colombia, but commerce
is carried on to some extent, chiefly witli tle Unlited States and GIreat
Britain. The exports are mostly inrl the tropical productions of the
country, and consist of sugar, coiffee, cacao, indigo, hides, sarsaparilla, &amp;e.

tin; and diamonds, emeralds, and other precious stones, are found. The
Pearl fishery amounts in value to about $100,000 every year.
NEW GRENADA.
6. NEW   GRENADA is the most powerful and populous of
the Colombian States. Its. coast is washed on the west side
by the Pacific Ocean, and on the north by the Caribbean sea.
Part of this territory extends into North America westward
from the Isthmus of Darien.
7. Roads hardly exist in the mountainous districts of New Grenada
and the other parts of Colombia. Travellers are often carried in a kind
of chair, placed on the backs of persons called silleros, hired for the
purpose.
8. The bridges across the rapid torrents of thle Andes are frequentlyv
formed of a single rope, and a hammock or basket made to run fromn
one end to the other, in which the Colormbian passes secure.
9. Bogota, the Capital of New Grenada, is situated on a fertile plain,
8000 feet above the sea. It contains a number of handsome churches
and convents, and a university. The surrounding country yields two
crops of grain annually.

VENEZUELA.
1. VENEZUELA comprises the most eastern part of Colorm.
bia.  A  range of mountains, the north-east branch of the
Andes, extends along nearly the whole of the northern coast.
The remainder of the republic consists of a vast plain, forming part of the great Llanos of Colombia.
2. Like the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, and the Sertam of
Brazil, it is covered with tall herbage, on which graze vast
herds of horses, oxen, and mules.     Of these, many of the
inhabitants possess from 10,000 to 20,000 head.
3. The people of the plains are called Llaneros. They are all excel,
lent horsemen; and particularly distinguished themselves, in the con.
test with Spain, for their patriotism and bravery.
4. Caraccas, the capital, is situated about 12 miles firom the coast.
Previous to 1812 it was a large city with more than 40,000 inhabitants.
In that year it was destroyed by one of the most dreadful earthquakes
on record, and 10,000 persons perished on the spot. Thie city is revivinlg,
and now contains about one-hlalf of its former population.
5. La Guayra is the chief port of this republic. Maracaybo, Coro,
and Valencia, are all considerable towns. The isiand of Margarita, one
of the lesser Antilles, belongs to Venezuela.

ECUADOR,* OR QUITO. t
6. THE Republic of Ecuador, or Quito, lies on both sides
of the equator. The civilized part of the population is confined to the western coast and the valleys of the Andes;
while the eastern portion of the territory is occupied by independent tribes of Indians.
7. The climate, especially of Quito, is that of perpetual
spring. Vegetation never ceases, and the trees and meadows
are crowned with constant verdure. The country is delightful, and is called the evergreen Quito.  It is, however, subject
to dreadfild earthquakles and violent tempests.
8. The Gallapagos, or Turtle Islands are claimed by the Republic of
Ecuador. They lie on both sides of the equator, about 650 mrniles westward from Southl America. These islands, which enjoy a delightful
climnate, and a fertile soil, are occupied by a colony from Guayaquil.
9. Quito, the capital, is situated on Mt. Pichincha, 9,000 feet above
the sea. It contains handsome streets and squares, anid many churches
and convents, built witli magnificence and taste. It has two universities,
which are well attended.

Ascent of Mont Blanc.
Some mountains are so steep and rugged, that it is difficult to ascend
to the top of them. The picture represents a party of men going up
Mont Blanc, the highest mountain in Europe. They were more than

GUIANA.
1. GUIANA extends from the Orinoco to the Oyapock river,
a distance of seven hundred miles. Along the sea-shore the
country presents the appearance of a low extensive plain; but
in the interior, near the sources of the rivers, it is elevated and
mounltainous.
2. The soil is exceedingly fertile, producing sugar, coffee,
cayenne pepper, and cloves, with a great variety of tropical
fruits, in abundance.
3. This regioni is divided between the British, Dutch, and French.
British Guiana comprises the colonies of Essequibo,t Demerara, and Berbice. The capital is Georgetown, a place of considerable trade. Dutch
Guiana, or Surinam, has for its capital Paramaribo, the miost important
place in this quarter. French Guiana, or Cayenne, has a capital of the
same namlne.
4. The mass of the population of Guiana is composed of negroes.
Those in the Britishl colonies have been lately set at liberty; but in Surinarn and Cayenne, they are still held as slaves. The interior of the
country is irinhabited by Maroons, or runaway negroes, and independent
lribes of Indians.
PERU.
5. PERu comprises the states now called North Peru and
South Peru.   When first discovered by the Spaniards, it was
inhabited by a race of Indians much more civilized than any
of the other nations of South America.
6. This country has been always proverbial for the great
wealth furnished by its mines of gold, silver, and mercury.

Mules and lamas carrying produce.
It was long the most valuable of the South American colonies,
and the last territory in the western continent from which the
Spaniards were driven.
7. The Andes range through the whole extent of Peru. On the coast
the climnate is hot. Rain seldom falls, and much of the surface is sandy
and arid. On the high table-land, between the ridges of the mnountains, the climate is various, and the products of thlle soil are chiefly
those of temperate regions.
8. Along thle sea-coast the agriculture is confined to the banks of the
various streams which descend from the Andes. Where the soil can
be watered, the vegetation is most luxuriant, and surprises the traveller
by the pleasing change from the sterility of the desert to the bright verdure that prevails.
9. The chief products are Indian-corn, sugar-cane, and cotton, withl
the fruits of almost every climate. Some valuable dye-woods and medicinal plants are als-o produced, particularly the Peruvian bark or Cascarilla. Wine and brandy are made to some extent, but wheat and flour
are imported from Chili.
10. The silver-mines of Cerro Pasco are the most important now
worked in Peru. There are also some valuable mines of gold and imercury. The commerce consists, for the most part, in the interchange
of the precious metals for foreign products and manufactures, of which
considerable quantities are imported.

PERU-BOLIVIAN CONFEDERATION.
1. THE States of North Peru, South Peru, and Bolivia, form
the lately created republic styled the Peru-Bolivian Confederation.
2. Each of these is independent in its local affairs, and is governed
by its 9wn president; but for general purposes the confederationl is under
the control of a chief called the Supreme Protector, and a general Congress of plenipotentiaries from the three states.
NORTH PERU.
3. THE republic of North Peru comprises the northern division of the ancient country of that name.   A large part of
the eastern section of this state is still in the possession of the
Indians, of whom many of the tribes are exceedingly savage,
and some of them are said to be cannibals.

vents, though robbed of a great part of their wealth during the revolution, still present a handsome appearance.
5. Callao, the sea-port of Lima, is strongly fortified. It was the last
place held by the Spaniards in South America. At Cerro Pasco, among
the Andes, are the richest mines now worked in Peru: the town is elevated 13,000 feet above the level of the sea. Truxillo is a handsome
town; Piura is famious for its fine breed of mules; Caxamnarca, Huaura,
and Caxatambo, all in the interior, are places of some note. Payta, one
of the most northern ports, is much frequented by American whale-ships.
SOUTH PERU.
6. The republic of South Perut declared its independence
in March, 1836. It is the least extensive of the Peruvian
States, but comprises some of the best cultivated and most
populous districts in this part of South America.
7. Cuzco, the capital, is situated far in the interior, on one of the head
branches of the Amazon river; though much decayed, it is still a handsomrne place. At the time of the Spanish conquest, it was the mnetropolis
of the ancient empire of Peru, and was at that period a splendid city.
Arequipa is the chief place of trade in this state. It is situated in the
midst of one of the most fertile districts of Peru. Ilay, its sea-port, is
a small village.
8. Guamanga contains a university richly endowed, and Guancavelica
is celebrated for its mines of mercury or quicksilver. Puno and Tacna
are important towns. Arica is the port through which the chief part
of the trade of Bolivia is carried on. The other sea-ports, called the
Intermedios, have some comnmerce.

BOLIVIA.
1. BOLIVIA, formerly called Upper Peru, is the most popu.
lous and important of the South American states that threw
off the yoke of Spain. It established its independence in
1825, and was named after General Bolivar, the liberatorof
South America.
2. It lies chiefly in the interior, and consists, for the most
part, of a high fertile plain on the east side of the Andes,
elevated firom 8,000 to 14,000 feet above the level of the
ocean.
3. This lofty territory yields copious harvests of Indiancorn, rye, barley, and potatoes, and, also, some whieat. It
has cities above the region of the clouds, and cottages situated
as high as the top of Mont Blanc.
4. Lake Titicaca forms
part of the western boundary of Bolivia. It has no
visible outlet, and is raised
12,500 feet above the sea.
This lake is navigated by
boats made of rushies closely
plaited together; the mast
and rudder alone are made of
wood, which, owing to tlhe
scarcity of that article in this
region, forms the most valuable part of the vessel.
5. The condor, the largest
of the vulture kind, is found
in Bolivia and other parts
of the continent.  Inhabiting the loftiest surnmmits
of tbe Andes, ie descends

La Paz is the largest city in Bolivia, and, though situtated in a deep
valley, stands at the height of 12,400 feet above the ocean. It contains a cathedral, and several convents and churches.
7. Potosi, the best known city in Bolivia, is elevated 13,000 feet above
tie sea. It is but indifferently built, and is not so flourishing as it once
was. The mnountain on whichi it is situated is oeie huge silver mnine.
It yielded in 258 years the vast sum of sixteen hundred mnillions of
dollars; buLt is now less productive than formerly.
8. Cochabambat lies in a fertile and well-cultivated district, and the
city carries on a considerable trade in grain, fruits, and vegetables.
Cobija, or Puerto de la Mar, is thlle only sea-port Bolivia possesses. It
is a smnall village, and being situated in a desert country, is of but little

CHILI.:
1. CHILI consists of a long, narrow tract of country, situ.
ated between the Andes and the Pacific Ocean.      The climate
is remarkably fine and healthy, and many parts of the country present such romantic scenes, that Chili has been called
the Italy, and from its fertility, the garden of South America.
2. Its chief misfortune is that earthquakes are commnon,
and often lay the cities and towns in ruins.    Volcanoes are
also numerous: among the Andes, fourteen are said to be
constantly burning.

fertile, and produces the finest wheat and other grains, besides fruits
of various kinds, in abundance. Wine is made to some extent, and
agriculture and the raising of cattle are actively pursued.
4. The Chilese are a courteous and polite people, and appear to be
more industrious and enterprising than most of the other inhabitants
of South America. Mines of gold, silver, and copper, are numerous.
The latter are the most abundant and profitable.
5. Chili exports to
Europe and the United
States gold, silver, and
copper, and to Peru
grain and flour.  A
considerable trade is
carried on with Buenos Ayres across the
Andes by troops of
mules, which convey
merchandise, money,

often slip from the narrow, steep roads, which wind among the snountaints, and are dashed to pieces on the rocks beneatlh.
6. The southern part of this territory is inhabited by the Aricaunian
Indians, a brave and warlike race, who have defended their liberties
against the encroachments of the Spaniards ever sinilce their first entrance into the country.
7. Chiloe and thle islands in its vicinity belong to this state; also the
Juan Fernandez islands. The most eastern of these is noted for being
the solitary residence for several years of Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch
sailor, whose adventures gave rise to the well-known story of Robinson
Crusoe.
8. Santiago, the capital of Chili, is situated nlinety miles from the
coast, in a country that furnishes the most sublime and beautifiil prospects. The houses are mostly of one story, and surrounded with gardens. The streets are regularly laid out, and mnany of the public
buildings are handsome.

BRAZIL.
BRAZIL is the only portion of the new world ever governed
by an European sovereign in person; the King of Portugal
having reigned here, under the title of Emperor, from the year
1808 until the year 1821, at which time the country was
declared independent of Portugal.
2. This is an extensive region, being twenty-five times the
size of the British Islands; rather larger than the whole of
the United States, and comprising almost one-half the area
of South America.
3. Brazil is one of the finest countries in the world, and
enjoys great natural advantages, in the fertility of its soil, the
variety of its vegetable productions, and the value of its minerals.

4. The interior is very thinly settled, and much of it is vet covered wifth
dense forests. Roads are rare; and the numerous streams are destitute
of bridges, and, in many cases, of ferry-boats. The rivers are generally
crossed on rafts, moved by poles; while the horse, held by the head, is
made to swim.
5. Thle mnass of the people are very ignorant and indolent. Nearly
all the labour is performed by Negro slaves, who constitute about threefifths of thle whole population.
6. Agriculture is in a backward      state.   Manufactures
searcely exist; but commerce is actively carried on. Sugar,
cotton, coffee, hides, and other products of the country, are
exported chiefly to the United States, Great Britain, and Portuogal.
7. Brazil is rich in gold and precious stones. The diamond
mines are worked on accounlt of the government, and furnish
nearly all the diamonds of commerce.
8. Cattle mnultiply to an immnense extent, especially in the region
called the Sertam; and in the extensive plains in the south, near Rio
Grande, some of the large farms have from 20,000 to 40,000 hlead.
9. The western part of Brazil is called Amazonia; although not a
political division, the name has been long in use, and originated from
the reports of the early-explorers of a nation of Amazons, or femalewarriors, sesiding on the banks of thlle Amazon river.
10. Rio Janeiro is the most populous and flourishing city in Southl
America. Its harbour is among the finest in the world, and is visited

built, much in the European style, though the streets are rather narrow.
The country palace-of the Emperor, near the city, called San Christ
tovao, being of a light and rural style of architecture, has a very
pleasing effect.
11. Bahlia, Pernambuco, Maranham, Para, and Rio Grande, are all
important sea-ports. Tejuco, in tihe interior, is the chief town, and
centre of the diamond district. Villa Rica, Villa Boa, and Cuyaba, arc
each surrounded by mnining districts.

BUENOS AYRES.
1. TiHE states comprising the Republic of Buenos Ayres
were the first in South America that threw off the yoke of
Spain.   At their declaration of independence, in 1816, they
were, including the Banda Oriental, called the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata; afterwards the Argentine
Republic, and, finally, the present name was adopted.
2. The surface of the country consists of vast plains, called pampas, which stretch from the Atlantic ocean to the
Andes, and from   north to south through the whole extent of
the territory.

73. What are these called?
A. They are called Oases: they are all inhabited, and serve
as resting places for travellers.
The Great Desert.
The Great Desert is firequently crossed by parties of travellers, with
camels; these are called caravans; both men and beasts often suffer
greatly from want of water, and somnetimes perish from thirst. The
picture represents a small caravan crossing the desert, one of the people
of which appears to have just expired.
74. What are Caves or Caverns?
A. They    are openings in the earth, often wonderful on
account of their great size and extent.208             DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY.
Gauchos catching Cattle with the Lasso.
3. They are chiefly destitute of trees, and covered with
high grass.   Numerous herds of horses, mules, and cattle,
graze and range over them. The rhea, or American ostrich,
with the jaguar, and several kinds of deer, also, abound on
these plains.
4. The Gauchos, or inhabitants of the pampas, lead a life of rude
independence. They have no care in rearing or feeding cattle; but
have only to catch themi with the lasso, or long leathernoose, to kill, or
drive them to Buenos Ayres; and, in thle case of horses, to break and
mark themr, that they mnay be afterwards known.
5. Beef is the principal food used on the pampas; neither grain nor
vegetables are cultivated; nor is the cow often made to give milk.
Horses are so numerous and cheap, that every one rides; even the beg.

8. Cordova and Mendoza, in the interior, are noted, the first for its
iniversity, the only one in this region, and the last for its wine and
brandy, and its trade with Chili, which is carried on across the Andes
by means of vast droves of mules.

PARAGUAY.
1. PARAGUAY is a fine fertile district, situated between tne
Paraguay and Parana rivers.      The population is composed
chiefly of Indians and Mestizoes, not more than one-twentieth
part being whites. Vast herds of cattle and horses feed on
its rich plains.

Every one is obliged to work at some occupation, and idleness and beggary are unknown.
4. Mate, or Paraguay tea, is the most celebrated production of this
region, and has been long used in a manner somewhat similal to the
tea of China over a great part of South America.
5. Assumpcion, the capital, is an irregularly built town, on the east
bank of the Paraguay river.  Itapua, Curuguaty, and Villa Rica, appear to be the next important towns.
URUGUAY.
6. The Republic of Uruguay was formerly called the
Banda Oriental, and attached to the United Provinces of the
Rio de la Plata.  It was afterwards, for a time, claimed by
Brazil; but in 1828, at the close of a bloody war between
the Brazilians and the Buenos Ayreans, the two parties agreed
to its becoming an independent state.
7. Montevideo, the capital, stands on the north bank of the Rio de
la Plata, and has the best harbour on that river. It exports great quantities of hides, &amp;c. The country around this city is fertile, though but
poorly cultivated. Maldonado and ColonIia are smlall townson the Rio
de la Plata.
8. On the upper part of the Uruguay river are the remains of the
Missions formed by the Jesuits. These contained at one time thirty
towns, and 100,000 Indians, who were converted from idolatry, instruct.
ed in farming and some of the useful arts, and disciplined as soldiers
after the European manner. But the towns are now decayed, and the
inhabitants reduced to less than one-tenrth of their former numnbers.

PATAGONIA.
1. PATAGONIA, the southern division of South America,
has never been explored except along the coast. The chief
part of it appears to be a cold, barren, and desert region.
i. It is very thinly inhabited by various tribes of Indians, who are
said to be excellent horsemen, and are usually described as a nation of
giants. They hunt the Rhea, or Amnerican Ostrich, which abounds in
the northern part of their country.

SOUTH AMIERICAN ISLANDS.
4. SOUTHFR-EAST from Patagonia are several groups of
islands, scattered at various distances from the continent.
They comprise the Falkland       Islands, South Georgia, and
Sandwich Land.
5. The climiate of these islands is cold and severe, and their shores
are rugged and barren. They are all uninhabited; and, except the Falkland group, are very seldom visited. The latter contains many good
barbours, which afford shlelter to the whale and seal ships which navigate the southern seas. They are claimed both by Great Britain and
Buenos Ayres.
6. Farther to the south, are the islands of South Shetland, Soutla
Orkney, Palmer's Land, and Graham's Land. These have all been
discovered since the year 1819.
7. They are derolate, sterile regions, covered even in mid-summer
with ice and snow, and are untenanted by a single humnan being.
Their shiores abound with the fur-seal, sea-elephant, and vast numbers
of penguins.
8. Vessels from Stonington and other ports in New England fiequent
these islands for the purpose of procuring seals, the furs of which are
very fine and valuable.

EUROPE.
1. EuizoPE, though the smallest of the three great divisions
of the eastern continent, is the first in importance, the most
thickly peopled, and the best cultivated.
2. In modern- times it has been the point from which civilization and knowvledge have been extended to other nationrs,
and its emigranrts have peopled all the civilized countries of
the other parts of the world.
3. Europe is deeply penetrated by large inland seas, and
numerous gulfs, which afford great natural advantages for
commercial pursuits. Its interior regions are well watered,
though none of the rivers are of the first magnitude. The
principal of them  are theA Volga, Don, Dnieper, Danube,
Tagus, Loire, Rhine, Rhone, Elbe, and Vistula.
4. Though the surface of Europe is greatly diversified, yet
the mountains are inferior in extent and elevation to those of
Asia and America. The principal ranges are the Dofrafields,
Alps, Carpathians, Apennines, and Pyrenees.

Wild Scottish Ox.               WVild Musmon Sheep.
5. The native animals of Europe are less in number than those of
some of the othler quarters of the earth. The horse, ass, dog, and cat,
came originally from Asia; but the ox and the sheep are, probably, of
native origin. A few of the wild Scottish oxen are still preserved in
parks in the north of England; and the musmon, or wild sheep, is
found in Sardinia and Corsica.
Bearded Vulture.                    Golden Eagle.
6. The birds of Europe comiprise a number of different kinds, many
of whlich also abound in the neighbouring regions. The bearded vulture is the largest of the European birds of prey. It is found amnong
the highest summits of the Alps, and destroys sheep, lambs, goats, alnd
other animrnals. The golden eagle frequents the British isles, and tilhe
adjacent parts; while, the bustard, crane, stork, flamingo, spoonbill, and
pelican, are met with in various quarters. The turkey was brought
firom America, the peacock and common fowl from Asia, and the
guinea-fowl from Africa.
7. The. cultivation of the soil has been carried, in many
piarts of Europe, to great perfection, and has been rendered
highly productive in all the necessaries, and most of the

9. Though EuLrope was the latest portion of the eastern
continentL that received the light of civilization, yet it must
rnow be considered as the centre of refinenent and learning.
The most usefil inventions, the finest productions of genius,'
and the improvemient of all the sciences, belong to the people
of this region.
10. Universities and colleges are numerous in almost all
European countries. These provide for the higher branches
of learning, and are ienerally on a larger scale than any in
America. Some of them are bhdowed with ex,-nsive funds,
valuable libraries, and botanic gardens; and attrat many
students from various quarters, of whom, some are from our
own country, and other parts of the new world.
11. In several parts of Europe, the common branches of
school education are much neglected, and the lower orders of
the people are not so well instructed as in the United States.'
Numbers of them are irnable to read or write; and in some
countries they are extremely ignorant and bigoted. il

num-erous in Prussia, Switzerland, Holland, Belgmum, and
Scotland. 4 In the latter country, mp re of the people receive

to these reside in splendid mansions, and enjoy every luxury
which money can procure; whilst the poorer classes lodge in
mean cottages, and earn a very scanty subsistence by the
labour of their hands.
14. The religion of Europe is almost entirely Christian, except in Turkey, where the Mahomedan system is established.
The Christian church comprises three great divisions; the
Catholic, the Protestant, and the Greek church. The adherents of the first named amount, probably, to about 120 millions, the second to 52 millions, and the last 50 millions.
l'There are also about 5' millions of Mahomedans, and 2millions of Jews.
15. Europe comprises 61 independent states. Of these, three are
styled Empires, 16 Kingdoms, 7 Grand Ducllies, 1 Electorate, 11
Ducleies, 1 Landgraviate, 11 Principalities, 1 Lordshlip, 1 Ecclesiastical
State, and 9 Republics. The population of thlle whlole is estimated at
230 nmillions.
16. The states which rank highest in the scale of national importance
are, Great Britain, France, Russia, Austria, anid Prussia. These are
called the five Great Powers. They direct and control the affairs of
the whole continent, and, more or less, influence the destinies of every
civilized nation.

DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY.
2. This region forms a vast peninsula, bounded on the one
side by the Atlantic ocean, and on the other by the Baltic sea.
The climate, though severe in winter, is healthful; and many
of the inhabitants, especially of Norway, live! to a great age.
Extensive forests cover a large part of the country, and
but a small portion of it is suited to agriculture.
3. Grain is seldom raised in sufficient quantities to supply
the wants of the people; and in the northern districts, pine
bark or mnoss, is often mixed with flour, to make bread. The
southern sections are the most fertile, and produce potatoes,
barley, oats, rye, and some tobacco.
4. Sweden has but few manufactures, and Norway still less. The
working of the mines, ship-building, the cutting of timber, and the
fisheries, form the chief branches of industry.  The commerce is
active and extensive. The chief exports are iron, steel, copper, timber,
and fish.
5. The habits, manners, and characters of the Swedes and Norwegians have much resemblance. They are lively and cheerful in disposition, polite and hospitable to strangers, and are strongly attached to
their respective countries.
6. Thle religion of both hations is the Lutheran. Education is general, and the chief part of the lower orders of the people are able to
read and write. Amongst the peasantry, every man is his own carpenter, shoemaker, blacksmithl, &amp;c.

7. NoRwAY was united to Denmark in 1380, and contin
ued to form  part of the Danish monarchy until 1814, when
it was annexed to Sweden. It is one of the most mountainous countries in Europe; and abounds in sublime and romantic
scenery.
8. Near the Loffoden islands there is a terrific whirlpool, called the
Malstromn, which sometimes draws in ships, and dashes them on the

SWEDEN.
1. SWEDEN, though enclosed by high mountains on the
north and west, is, in general, a flat country, much diversified
by lakes and rivers.   The northern part of the kingdom is
barren, and very thinly peopled; while the southern is much
more fertile, containing some thickly settled and well.culti.
vated districts.,
2. In science, the Swedes have attained considerable distinction.
They have cultivated, with great ardour, botany, chemistry, and mincralogy; and their learned men are particularly well versed in the
languages of other nations. They have also, at different periods, been
noted for their martial spirit, and, under some of their kings, have
acquired great military renown.

4. Gottenburg is the second town in Sweden, in trade and population.
Carlscrona is the station of the Swedish navy. Upsal is noted for its
university, and Fahlun for its copper-mines.  Several islands in the
Baltic sea belong to Sweden, as does also the island of St. Bartholomew
in the West Indies.
Laplanders Travelling.
LAPLAND.
5. Lapland is a cold, desolate region, lying to the north
of the Arctic circle.  It belongs, nominally, to Sweden and
Russia; but such are the sterility of the soil and the poverty
of the people, that they are left to themselves, and are not
under the cognizance of any general government.
6. The Laplanders are of short stature, being generally
under five feet in height.  They are a simple, harmless
people; greatly attached to their native country, and are
never known to leave it. War is their aversion, and no
instance has ever occurred of any of them becoming soldiers.

7. The swift-footed reindeer, which they train to draw them in
sledges over the snow, form their riches. The flesh and milkl of these
animals comprise their food, and the skins their furniture and clothing.
The Laplanders move about from place to place, withl their herds of
reiiideer, and seldom reside in towns.
8. In summer, they live in
tents, and in winter, in low,
rude hilts, formed of stones
and earth, and covered with
turf. The few villages found
in this country are very small,
seldom containing more than
one or two lhundred inhabitants; and the whole nation,
though occupying a country
nearly equal in extent to
France, is supposed not to exceed 30,000 individuals.

seventy years, by the annexation of Finland, a great part of
Poland, and various districts of Turkey and Persia.  Its
population, which, 100 years ago, was estimated at only 15
millions, now numbers four times that amount.
3. The inhabitants consist of a greater variety of different
nations, than is to be found under any other government in
the world. The chief races in European Russia are Russians,
Poles, Finns, Tartars, and Cossacks. The latter form, in
time of war, a most efficient part of the Russian army.
4. The established religion is that of the Greek church,
but all others are tolerated; and there are to be found in
Russia, Catholics, Protestants, Mahomedans, Jews, and Pagans, of various kinds.
The government is an absolute monarchy. The Emperor
is the head of church and state, and is styled the Autocrat of
all the Russias.  All power emanates from him, and he is
considered to derive his authority from God alone.
5. The military force of this, empire is the largest in
Europe, and is a source of anxiety to the neighbouring states.
The regular army amounts to 700,000 men. The naval
force, on the Black and Baltic seas, consists of between 200

and 300 vessels of various kinds, and is considered to be, at
present, in a very efficient condition.
6. The commerce is extensive, and is annually increasing,
having doubled in amount in about twenty-five years. The
exports are tallow, hemp, sail-cloth, iron, timber, and grain.
The manufactures have hitherto been rude, and chiefly confined to fabrics of hemp and flax; but of late years, cotton,
silk, and woollen go6ds of various kinds, have been made to
some extent, as well as glass-ware, porcelain, paper, &amp;c.
7. Great fairs are held in different places, which attract vast crowds
of merchants and traders from all parts. The inland commerce is
mnuch facilitated by the numerous rivers, canals, and lakes; and by the
snow, in thle winter season, over which sleighs travel with great rapidity. The chiqf internal trade is with China, Persia, Tartary, Turkey
&amp;c.
8. The seal and sturgeon fisheries of the river Volga, and
of the Caspian and Black seas, are extensive and very productive. Upwards of 10,000 fishing-boats are employed on
the Volga alone. A Steam Navigation Company has been
formed, for the.purpose of introducing steam-vessels upon the
various seas, lakes, and rivers of this empire.
9. The great body of the Russian people is divided into
two classes, nobles and slaves. The former are often enormously wealthy, and live in great luxury and splendour; the
latter are the property of the nobles, who reckon the value of
their estates, not by the number of acres, but of slaves.
10. The slaves, or boors, are, generally, in a state of abject poverty
and ignorance. They are rude in their manners, filthy in their habits,
and much addicted to intoxication. Yet some of them possess great
facility of imitation, and have been found capable of copying some of
the finest works of art.
11. The condition of Russia, as to education and refinement, though greatly behind the rest of Europe, is believed to
be advancing.   Considerable exertions have been made by
the government, to introduce schools, and instruct the lower
orders of the people.    There are seven universities, and
numerous seminaries of the higher class.

RUSSIA IN EUROPE.
1. THis is the most extensive region in Europe., It comprises more than one-half of the area of that division of the
continent, and stretches from the Baltic sea to the Ural
mountains. The surface is generally level; its chief features
being vast plains and large rivers, with numerous lakes in
the north-western quarter.
2. In the northern parts of the country, it is intensely cold
in winter, and mostly barren; while in the southern districts
the climate is mild and pleasant, and the soil is, in general,
fertile and highly productive, yielding large crops of wheat,
rye, oats, &amp;c.
3. The cold and dreary islands of Nova Zembla and
Spitsbergen, belong to Russia; they lie to the northward of
the Arctic circle, and are not inhabited by man. These
islands abound with white bears, reindeer, seals, whales, &amp;c.,
and are resorted to by hunters and fishermen. The islands
of Aland, Dago, and Oesel, in the Baltic sea, also form part
of this empire.

The habitations of the lower orders of the people, especially in the
villages, are formed of the rough trunks of trees, the interstices between
which are filled with moss and clay, and the light admitted by square
openings. They thus resemble piles of logs, rather than human habitations.
5. St. Petersburg, the capital of Russia, is situated at the confluence
of the river Neva with the Gulf of Finland. It was founded in 1703,
by Peter the Great, and is now a magnificent city, with numerous
p,alaces, churches, and other edifices. It is the principal place of commuerce for the empire, and the seat of its learning and science.
6. Moscow, the old capital, was one of the largest
cities in Europe. It' was
deserted by the whole pop.
ulation in 1812, and almost
destroyed by fire, to prevent
its affording an asylum to
the army of the emperor
Napoleon, who had invaded
the country.  It is now

POLAND.
1. POLAND, once an important state, was conquered and
divided, in the year 1795, between Russia, Prussiaf and
Austria. In 1815, part of ancient Poland was erected into
a kingdom, subject to the control of the Emperor of Russia,
who, in consequence, added to his title, that of King of
Poland.
2. The tyranny of the Russians proving insupportable to
the Poles, they, in the year 1830, attempted a revolution; but,
after defeating their oppressors in several bloody battles, were
at length overpowered by superior numbers, and forced to
submit. Poland is now incorporated with Russia, and no
longer exists as a separate state.
3. Many of the Polish patriots, preferring exile and poverty
abroad, to oppression at home, have emigrated to other parts
of the world, and some of them now reside in the United
States. During the war of the American Revolution, two
Polish generals of distinction, Kosciusko and Pulaski, came
to this country, and took part with the Americans in the contest with Great Britain.
4. The'people, as in Russia, are divided into two great classes, nobles
and slaves. The nobles, who are more numerous than in any other
country in Europe, have always, in the eye of the world, formed the
people of Poland. They are brave, frank, and hospitable, and so gay

-and lively in their manners, that they have been compared to the

5. Some of the nobles possess vast estates, and live in great splendour;
while the peasants inhabit wretched hovels, and are ignorant, bigoted,
and extremely dirty. The Jews are more numerous in this country
than in any other part of the continent. They are industrious, but
crafty, and carry on all the trade and commerce of the country. These
people enjoy more political freedom here, than in any of the neighbouring states.
6. The climate of Poland is cold and moist, yet the soil is so productive inr grain, that the annual export has been estimated at sixteen
million bushels. Cattle, hemp, flax, wax, and honey, are also exported.
7. Warsaw was the capital of Poland. It has suffered greatly from
the sieges and bombardments it has sustained. This place presents
the same contrast, common in the cities of Poland and Russia, of
splendid palaces and mean hovels, adjoining each other. Lublin is
-noted for its fairs, to which traders resort from all quarters.
8. REPUBLIC OF CRACOW.- This little republic was formed in 1815,
and consists of the city of Cracow. with a small surrounding territory,
of about 500 square miles, and 124,000 inhabitants. Though the
freedom it enjoys is only by sufferance, yet it has sufficed to render its
soil more fertile, and better cultivated, than that of aniy other part of
Poland.
9. The city of Cracow was once the capital of Poland. It has a
cathedral noted for its 50 altars and 16 chapels, and, also, a number of
churches, monlasteries, and convenrts. The city contains a remarkable
monument, erected to the memory of the patriotic Kosciusko, 300 feet
in height, and 275 feet in diameter at the base.

DENMARK.
1. DENMARK was formerly a powerful state, and exercised an extensive control over the adjacent countries; but it
is now reduced in wealth and population, and ranks only as
a third or fourth-rate kingdom. It comprises the peninsula
of Jutland, the duchy of Sleswick, and several islands lying
in the entrance of the Baltic sea, with the duchies of Holstein
and Lauenburg, in Germany.

Copenhagen.
The soil is generally fertile, and well adapted to the raising
of grain and cattle. Manufactures are not muchl attended to;
but commerce and the fisheries are carried on with some
activity.
3. The Danes are an honest, industrious people, but are not remarkable for enterprise or improvement. Literature and science are on a
respectable footing, being patronized by the government. There are
universities at Copenhagen and Kiel, andcommon schools are numerous
in almnost all parts of the kingdom.'4. The established religion of this country is the Lutheran, but all
other sects are tolerated. The government is an absolute monarchly,
but it is administered with, perhaps, more mildness, than any similar
government in Europe. The king of Denmark is a member of the
German Confederation, as sovereign of Holstein and Lauenberg.
5. The foreign possessions of this kingdom are Greenland, Iceland,
and the Faroe isles, the islands of St. Thomas and Santa Cruz, in the
West Indies, some factories on the gold coast of Africa, with Tranquebar and Serampore, in Hindoostan.
6. Iceland is a cold and dreary region, inhabited by a simple, moral,
and industrious race, who are better educated thlan the common people
of almost any other country in Europe. It is celebrated for its volcano,
its caldrons of boiling mud, and its hot-springs, called geysers, which
spout up boiling water to the heighlt of 100 feet.
7. Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark, is one of the most handsome
cities of northern Europe. It has a good harbour, with considerable
commerce, and is noted for its vast docks, and extensive fortifications.

1. TarE   late kingdom   of the Netherlands, comprising
Holland and Belgium, was formed in 1814, and abolished in
1830, by a revolt of the people of the latter state, and the
erection of their country into a separate kingdom.
HOLLAND.
2. HOILAND is the most level country in EuLrope, and much
of its surface is helow the level of the sea, which is prevented
from  overflowing the land by extensive dikes, or embankments.
3. The climate is cold, moist, and unfavourable to agriculture; yet the industry of the inhabitants has converted their
marshy soil into one of the richest spots in Europe. The cattle,
butter, and cheese, are excellent; and the gardens and orchards are cultivated with uncommon care.  
4. In commerce, manufactutres, and the fisheries, the Dutch formerly
excelled all other European nations. These branches are still considerable, but are now much surpassed by those of Great Britain. Canals
are more numnerous in this country, than in any other part of the world.
In summer, all the travelling is performed in canal-boats; and in winter,
when frozen, the canals are travelled over by sleighs, and by the people
on skates.

religion is the Presbyterian, but all others are tolerated, and the ministers of all sects are supported by the government.
6. Amsterdam, the principal city of the kingdom, is still a place of
great commerce, although much declined from its former wealth and
importance. The city is intersected by numerous canals, over which
there are near 300 bridges. The houses and streets are- kiept remarkably clean.
7. The Stadt-House is the most splendid building in Holland. It
rests upon a foundation of 13,659 piles, or long timbers, driven into the
ground. It is built of freestone, with a front of 282 feet. It contains
numnerous paintings, statues, &amp;c., and cost nine million dollars. Rotterdam is next to Amsterdam in commerce.

BELGIUM.
1. BELGIUM, or Flanders, is, in proportion to its extent, the
most thickly-peopled kingdom in Europe. It is filled with
populous cities, and covered with places remarkable in history, as the scenes of great victories and defeats, among
which are Waterloo, Charleroi, Fleurus, &amp;c.
2. The country is extremely beautiful, being mostly level
with a fertile soil, and so highly cultivated, that it has been
called the garden of Europe. The productions are grain,
flax, madder, hops, tobacco, &amp;c. The canals in Belgium are
spacious and commodious, connecting all the great cities,
though they are not so numerous as in Holland.
3. The Belgians, formerly called Flemings, have long excelled in manufactures and the arts.  They are no less
industrious and persevering than the Dutch, but are more
lively in their manners, and approach nearer the French,
whom they prefer.
4. They are principally Catholics; but free toleration is allowed to

all other denominations. There are a few Protestants in Belgium, and
their ministers, as well as those of the other sects, are all paid out of the
public treasury.
5. The universities of Brussels, Louvain, Liege, and Ghent, are all in
a flourishing condition, and are attended by a considerable number of
pupils. The provision made for general instruction in this country is
extensive; there are schools in every village, and the lower orders are
amongst the best educated in Europe.
6. Brussels, the capital of this kiingdom, is one of the finest cities in
Ellrope; it is distinguished for its public walks and fountains, and for
its extensive mnanufactures of carpets and lace. Ten mniles south of
this city, is the little village of Waterloo, celebrated for the important
battle fought there in 1815.
Antwerp.
7. Antwerp is the most commercial city in Belgium, and, in the
height of its prosperity, was one of the most wealthy and flourishing
cities in Europe. Its commerce has greatly declined, and the population, once 200,000 in number, is not at present more than one-tlhird
that amount; the city is surrounded by a wall, with carriag e roads on
the top, planted with rows of trees the Cathledral is one of the finest
Gothic structures in the world, and is 441 feet high.
8. Ghent and Liege have both considerable manufactures. At the
formnr city, the treaty of peace between the United States and Great
Britain, was signed in 1814. Bruges was once famous for its commerce, but has greatly declined. Tournay is noted for its manufactures of carpets and porcelain; MAons for its coal-mines; Louvain for
its university, and Namur for its fire-armns and cutlery..Map No. 11.-What bounds Belgium    on the north? Hd., N.-Sa.

Asia, Africa, America, and Oceanica, which, with the European part, form the British Empire. The population of the
whole is estimated at more than 150 millions of people, comprising, with the exception of China, the greatest number
of subjects under the control of any one sovereign in the
world.
3. Great Britain is one of the most influential states in
the World, and surpasses every other for the extent and variety
of its manufactures, and for its commercial and naval importance. The intelligence, enterprise, and industry of its
inhabitants are no where equalled, except in the United
States.

The sovereign power is vested in a king or queen, lords, and
commons.    The two last form the parliament, or great council of the nation, a body to w-hich the Congress of the United
States bears a strong resemblance.
5. The nation is divided into three great classes, the nobility, gentry, and commonaity.     The first comprises dukes,
marquises, earls, viscounts, and barons. The gentry includes
all those who are distinguished for wealth, education, talents,
or office; and the commonalty comprises tradesmen, artificers,
and labourers.
6. The principal national force is the navy, which, in time of war,
has numbered 1000 vessels, manned by 170,000 sailors and marines.
The armxiy amounted, at the same time, to upwards of 300,000 men;
but is now reduced to about one-thlird that anmount. The present naval
force, in actual service, is near 200 sail. The national debt, contracted in about 150 years, is 3,500 million dollars, to pay the interest of
which, requires three-fifths of the annual income of the state.
7. The manufactures of this country are immense, and have raised
Great Britain to a decided superiority over all other nations. Cotton,
woollen and silk goods, with the manufacture of metals of various
kinds, are the most important. The produce of the fisheries and the
mines is very great; and the coal trade, alone, is estimated to employ
160,000 persons.
8. The commerce of Great Britain is superior to that of any other
nation, and extends to all quarters of the world. The merchant-vessels,
including those of the colonies, amount to upwards of 27,000 in number, and are navigated by 180,000'men. One-sixth of the shipping
belongs to the port of London, and two-thirds of the commerce is carried on at that city. From 35,000 to 38,000 vessels enter and depart
frorm the ports of Great Britain every year.

ENGLAND.
1. ENGLAND embraces the southern part of Great Britain,
and is the largest and most populous division of the island.
It has great variety of surface, but is chiefly level or gently
undulating, and abounds in beautiful and interesting scenery.
2. The climate, though moist and cool, is healthfhl, and less
subject to the extremes of heat and cold than most other
countries in the same latitudes.
3. The soil of England is not naturally rich, yet the agri.
culture is superior to that of any other country in Europe.
The chief products are wheat, barley, oats, hops, &amp;c.
4. In no part of the world, perhaps, is wealth more unequally distributed than in England, and seldom do the cottages
of the poor contrast so strongly with the mansions of the rich.
Costly and splendid buildings are spread over various parts
of the kingdom, and many of the parks and country-seats of
the nobility and gentry, display a princely magnificence.
5. Thoughl luxury and corruption exist to a considerable extent iln
certain portions of English society, yet the great mass of the people is
distinguished by sound morals. Benevolence may be considered a
striking feature in the national character; and in no country are there
England. Q.- 1. What does England embrace? What is said of

so many associations for charitable, benevolent, and religious purposes.
6. The literary institutions, and learned men of this country, are
highly distinguished; and no language excels the English, in all the
treasures of poetry, eloquence, philosophly, and science.  Great exertions are made by various religio'us associations, to spread the Christian
religion and civilization among the heathen; and numerous missionaries have been sent to various parts of the earth, for that purpose.
7. No general provision has been devised for the education of the
poorer classes, but special efforts are now making for that purpose.
Many of the people are extremely ignorant, and numbers are wholly
dependent on Sunday schools for instruction. The high6r seminaries
of learning are very numerous, and furnish great facilities for obtaining
a superior cducation.
8. The Episcopal is the established religion, and the sovereign is the
supreme head of the church, which is governed by two archbishops
and twenty-five bishops. The mnembers of other churches are called
dissenters: they comprise Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, &amp;c., and,
with Roman Catholics, constitute about one-half of the population.
9. This country is noted for its excellent roads and substantial
bridges. Canals are numerous, and cross the island,in every direction,
and, with well-constructed rail-roads, greatly facilitate the vast inland
trade of the kingdom. The former are near 300 in number, and extend
about 2800 miles in length. The most important rail-roads are those
which connect London with Liverpool, Bristol, and Southampton, and
Liverpool with Manchester.
160
10. London, the capital of the British Empire, is built on
both sides of the river Thames. It covers a vast extent of
ground, being about 8 miles in length, and firom 3 to 5 in
breadth.   It is admirably situated    for trade, and is the
richest, most populous, and most comhnercial city in the
world.
11. It contains a great number of public buildings, of which St.
Paul's Cathedral, the Tower, Westminster Abbey, and the Bank of
England, are the chief. The bridges of London attract attention, by
their beauty and utility: they are six in number, all built of stone,
except one, which is constructed of iron.
12. London presents a striking contrast of wealth, intelligence, and
morality, with ignorance, poverty, and vice. No city in the world has
so great a number of learned societies, and literary and scientific estabstitutions, &amp;c. 7. Education? Highest seminaries of-learning, &amp;c.?

lishments; and none can compare with it in its charities for the poor,
the sick, and the ignorant.
13. Five miles below London, on the Thames, is Greenwich, famous
for its naval hospital for infirm seamrnen, and its observatory, from which
longitude is reckoned. Above London is Chelsea, containing the great
national asylumn for invalid soldiers. Windsor, 22 miles from London,
is celebrated for its castle, which has been the summer residence of the
sovereigns of England, for upwards of 700 years.
14. Liverpool is next to London in commerce. It is the principal
seat of thle trade with America. Bristol is the third commercial town
in England. Hull is noted for its' trade to the Baltic and the whale
fishery.: New Castle, Sunderland, and Whitby, are largely engaged in
the exportation of coals. Portsmouth and Plymouth are great naval
stations.
15. Manchester is the second place in England in population, and is
famous for its extensive cotton manaufactures; Leeds, Bradford, and
Norwich, for woollen goods; Birmingham, for hardware; Sheffield, for
cutlery; Kidderminister, for carpets; Worcester, for porcelain; Coventry, for watches and ribbons; and Gloucester, for pins.
16. Oxford and Cambridge are celebrated for their universities: Eton
and Winchester, for their colleges. Bath and Cheltenham are noted for
mineral waters, and are muchl visited by persons in quest of health or
pleasure.  Tunbridge, Scarborough, &amp;c., are well-known watering

places, and Brighton, Margate, &amp;c., are much resorted to for seabathing.
17. Hastings is renowned for a great victory gained by William the
Conqueror. At Bosworth, Richard the Third was defeated and killed.
The battles of North Allerton, Durham or St. Nevil's Cross, Otterburn
and Flodden Field, were fought between the English and Scots. At
Newbury, Edge Hill, Marston Moor, Naseby, and Worcester, inmportant
actions took place between the forces of the king and the parliament.

Menai Bridge.
WALES.
18. WALES is a mountainous and rugged region, situated
to the westward of England. The soil is less fertile and
cultivated than in that kingdom, but the products are the
same.
19. The manufactures are chiefly of flannel, in which the Welsh
excel. The minerals are abundant, and consist of iron, lead, copper,
and coal. Vast quantities of iron, chiefly for rail-roads, are imported
into the United States from Wales.
20. This country, previous to the year 1283, was governed by its
own kings; but since that time it has been united to England, and the
oldest son of the King of England is styled Prince of Wales.
21. Thle Strait, whlich separates Wales firom the island of Anglesea,
is crossed by the Menai bridge, one of the most remarkable works of
the kind in the world: it consists of immense iron chains, which connect arches of mnasonry, 560 feet apart; thus forming a safe and useful
structure.
22. Merthyr Tydvil is the largest town in Wales. It is situated in
the midst of numerous iron founderies and furnaces. Swansea is a
noted resort for sea-bathing. Caermarthen, and Caernarvon, are both
places of importance. The chief ornament of the latter is its castle
once a stately edifice, but now in ruins.

SCOTLAND.
1. SCOTLAND is situated to the north of England, and is
celebrated for the grandeur and wildness of its scenery. It
is divided by the Grampian hills into two sections, the Highlands and the Lowlands.
2. The Highlands is a cold, hilly region, well adapted for
pasturage; but the Lowlands is an agreeably diversified
country, with a tolerable soil, which is well cultivated, and
produces oats, wheat, rye, barley, and potatoes, to a considerable extent.
3. The manufactures are flourishing and important, especially those of cotton.   The principal minerals are coal,
iron, and lead, of which the two first are very abunaant.
The commerce and the fisheries are valuable, and give employment to a great number of the inhabitants.
4. The Scotch, as a nation, are grave, serious, and reflecting; but, at
the same time, enterprisinrg. They are, in general, better instructed,
and more mnoral and religious in their habits, than any other people in
Europe. Many of the natives of this country have distinguished themselves in various branches of literature, and some of them have been
amongst the most celebrated philosophers, historians, and poets, of
Great Britain.
5. The Hebrides, Orkney, and Shetland isles, belong to Scotland.
These are the resort of an immense number of sea-fowl, which the
islanders catch by swinging with ropes from the high perpendicular
cliffs to which they resort.
6. Edinburg is the metropolis of Scotland, and has long been distinguished as the seat of science and literature. Its university is particularly noted, and contains a greater numnber of students than any
other in Europe. The city has fbw manufactures; it carries on, however, a considerable trade through Leith, which, though formerly about
two miles distant, is now conrnected with it by continuous ranges of
buildings.
7. Glasgow is the largest city in Scotland, and owes its prosperity
chiefly to manufactures. It contains a large number of handsome
buildings, mostly of mnodern construction. Its university is celebrated,
and the cathedral is the best-preserved specimen of Gothic architecture
in Scotland.

Aberdeen are the principal sea-ports.
9. Stirling is celebrated for its castle, Melrose and Kelso for their
ancient abbeys, Ayr as the scene of somne of the exploits of the famous
Bruce and Wallace, and Gretna Green for the mnarriages of fugitive
lovers from England.
10. Bannockburn is famied for the decisive victory gained by king
Robert Bruce over Edward II. of England, and Dunbar for that
achieved by Oliver Cromwell over the Covenanters. At Preston Pans

IRELAND.
1. IRELAND is a fine fertile island, lying west of Great
Britain.  The climate is mild and moist, which produces a
beautifiul arnd continued verdure, and has led to its poetical
appellations of the Emerald Isle, and Green Erin.
2. The surface of the country is moderately uneven, with
few mountains. There are many peat bogs, which supply
fuel, but are useless for other purposes.
3. Agriculture is in a less improved state than in Englanrd or Scotland.  Barley, oats, wheat, and flax, are extenIreland. Q.- 1. What is Ireland?  What is said of the climate?

sively cultivated; but potatoes are the chief product, and
form the principal food of the poor.
4. Grazing, and the dairy, are the best-managed parts of Irish husbandry, and produce the best beef, and buttter, in Europe. Linen is
manufactured to some extent, and formrs, with the products of the soil,
the chief exports of the country.
5. The people of Ireland are generous, quick-witted, and, hospitable;
they are, however, easily offended, and prone to resentment. TI'lough
the Episcopal is the established religion, yet four-fifths of the inhabitants
are Romnan Catholics. Many of themrn are ignorant of the English
tongue, and use the Irish only, a language simnilar to that spoken by
the Scotch flighlanders.                        a  
6. The great mass of the peasantry live in a state of abject poverty
and wretchedness. They are degraded by the oppression of the great
landlords, and their agents. The payment of church tithes, and numerous taxes, swallows up their earnings, and discourages the spirit of
industry. Beggars are numerous, and, notwithstanding thle natural
fertility of Ireland, many of the poor have perished with hunger.
7. The Giant's Causeway, which is situated on the northl coast of
the island, is an astonishing work of nature. It consists of vast nuImbers of perpendicular columns of basaltic rock, rising fromn 200 to 400
feet above the surface of the water.
8. Dublin is the chief city of Irelaind: some of its streets are truly
magnificent, and its public edifices are numerous and beautiful. Amonur
the latter, St. Patrick's Cathiedral, the

9. Corkli is the second city in Ireland.  Its harbour, called the Cove,
is capacious and strongly fortified. The trade of this place in salted
pr6visions, &amp;c., is very great. Limerick is famous for the sieges it has
sustained: it exports vast quantities of grain. Belfast has an extensive

is much resorted to by thlose who visit the adjacent lake.
10. Waterford has an extensive intercourse with England and Wales.
Galway, Sligo, Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry, and Londonderry, are all
considerable sea-port towns. The last is celebrated for its siege by the
forces of Jamrnes II., in 1691. Near Drogheda on the river Boyne, and
also at Aghrimn, William III. defeated the army of James II.

2. The country is beautiful and fertile, and the climate
temperate, dry, and salubrious.   The chief part of France is
one widely extended plain, a large portion of which is well
adapted to cultivation.

PORTUGAL.
1. TaIs kingdom, like Spain, has declined fromn its former

valour of its soldiers, and the skill of its sailors.  It took a
distinguished lead in modern discoveries, and was for a time
the first comnmercial nation in Europe.
2. The surface of the country is agreeably diversified with
mountains, hills, and plains. The climate is mild, pleasant,
and healthful; and the soil is rich in the fruits and products

and revengetul; but, on many occasions, -during the1 late war with
France, they displayed qualities not unwort'y their gallant a~cestors.
7. Lisbon, the capital, is a place of co siderable commerce, ]nd has one
of the finest harbours in the world. it was destroyed by an'arthquake
in 1755, and 30,000 of the inhabitaits perished. It is an ill-built and
dirty place, but contains somne handsome public buildings and squares.
8. Oporto, the second city in the Yirgdomn, is famous for its port-wine,
of which about 75,000 pipes are annually exported. St. Ubes is noted

of Europe. It once contained upwards of 300 separate
divisions; but now comprises the Emrnpire of Austria, the
kingdomicf Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, and Wirtem
burg, with 29 smaller states and four republics or free cities.

but for general purposes the whole is governed by the Diet of
Germany, a bodyicomposed of plenipotentiaries and deputies
from the differentrstates.
3. This region is traversed by numerous rivers and extensive ranges of mountains. Agriculture is carried on with
great diligence, and mining is one of the chief sources of
wealth. The inland trade is very considerable, but the manufactures, though important and various, are not so flourishing
as formerly.

Mount Vesuvius, and surpasses every city in Europe for the beauty of
its situation and appearance. Naples is remarkable for the number of
its nobles and lazzaroni, or vagabonds.
7. Taranto, Bari, Cava, Foggio, and Salerno, are all considerable
towns. Palermo is the chief city of Sicily. It has a university, and
considerable commerce. Catania, Messina, Trapani, and Syracuse, are
among the chief towns.
8. THE IONAN RArEPUBLIC.-This republic comprises the islands of
Corfu, Cephlalonia, Zante, St. Maura, Paxu, Ithaca, and Cerigo. It is
under thle protection of Great Britain, whose sovereign appoints the
lord high commissioner, or head of the government.
9. The inhabitants are chiefly Greeks and Italians. They are an
industrious, enterprising people, and carry on a considerable commerce
in wine, olive-oil, and currants. The population of the islands amnounts
to 192,000. The largest town is Zante, with 18,000 inhabitants; but
Corft, on the island of the same name, is the capital.  Population
16,000.
10. MALTA.-Malta is a small but celebrated island in the Mediterranean sea, lying south of Sicily, containing 80,000 inhabitants; and
is noted for the strength of its fortifications. It formerly belonged to
the kniights of St. John, a rich and powerful military order; but is now
in thile possession of Great Britain. La Valetta, the capital and port,
has a population of 32,000.

GREECE.
1. GREECE is one of the most celebrated countries in the
world. Two thousand years ago, it excelled all others in
civilization, learning, and the arts. It was for nearly four
centuries subject to Turkish bondage; but has lately, after a
bloody and protracted warfare, become independent.
2. Modern Greece comprises a portion of the southern
part of the ancient country of the same name, together with
a number of islands in the Archipelago, of which Negropont
is the chief.
3. The interior of the country is finely diyersified with
rugged mountains, and beautiful and fertile valleys. The
climate is mild and pleasant; and the soil, though badly
cultivated, produces to some extent, cotton, oil, wine, silk, &amp;c.,
with fruits of various kinds.

4. The Greeks are an active, vigorous race of people, and are gen.
erally distinguished for personal beauty. In their late contest with the
Turks, they displayed a courage and bravery not unworthy their heroic
ancestors. The employment of fire-ships was with them a favourite
mode of warfare, by which they destroyed some of the largest vessels
of their enemies.
5 The great body of the people of Greece are destitute of education
and klnowledge; but they are anxious for improvemrnent, and are eager
to rise from the degradation consequent upon their long political servitude. Considerable exertions are making to introduce schools and
colleges amongst them, arid to dissemninate learning, good morals, and
religion.  The establishled religion is that of the Greek church.
6. The government chlosen for this country by the great European
powers, is a limited monarchy: the selected sovereign is Otlho, son of
Louis Charles of Bavaria. He bears the title of king of Gieece. Tlhe
administration of the national affairs has not as yet realized the expectations of the friends of Grecian liberty.
7. Athens, the capital of Modern Greece, was one of the rost celebrated cities of antiquity, and the birth-place of the most renowned
orators, philosophers, and artists of ancient times. It is now reduced
to a town of moderate dimensions, whose meanly-built houses contrast
strangely with the remaining relics of its ancient splendour.
8. Tripolizza, Napoli, and Navarino, are among the chief towns of
Greece. The last is celebrated for the destruction of the T'urkish
naval power by thle combined fleets of England, France, and Russia
on the 20th October, 1828;-an event which secured the independence
of Greece.
9. Hydra anld Spezzia, two small islands on the coast of the Morea
were famous for their commerce before the Revolution; and their merchant-ships formed, during the war, nearly the whole of the Greek
naval force.

TURKEY.
1 TURKEY, or the Ottoman empire, comprises two great
divisions, Turkey in Europe and'rurkey in Asia. It was
once a pQwerful and influential state; but has within the last
hundred years greatly declined in strength and importance.
2. Its territory has been of late much diminished. Greece
has become independent; while Egypt, Syria, the fine islands
of Cyprus and Candia, with the whole of the western part of
Arabia, have fallen into the hands of Mahomet Ali, the
Pacha of Egypt.
3. The governmenrt is thoroughly despotic. The Sultan,
or Grand Signior, is considered as reigning by divine commission; and as uniting in himself all the powers of the
state. He is sometimes profanely called the shadow of God,
brother to the suin and moon, anid refuge of the world.
4. The court is called the Ottoman Porte, or Sublime
Porte, and the Divan is the great coluncil of the nation. It

5. The Turks are grave and sedate in their manners, but ignorant
and bigoted  and so indolent, that nothing short of the str-ongest excitement will rouse them to activity. They are temnperate in both
eating and drinking. Porkli and wine are prohibited by the Koran.
Coffee is the principal beverage; thlough ardent spirits and opium are
used to some extent.
6. Ill religion they are strict Mahomedans. They call those who do
not believe their creed infidels, an( formerly esteemed it lawful to reduce to subjection all who refibsed to be converted to their faith.
Smoking the pipe, lounging for hours cross-legged upon a cushion or
sofa, and bathing, are the principal occupations of tl-le better class.
7. Important chlanges have lately taken place in thle character and
policy of the Turkish government. The present Sultan has organized
his army and navy after those of the other European nations; and is
endeavouring to introduce their arts and sciences into his ernpire.
8. The Turks, or, as they call themselves, Osmanlis, are the ruling
race in this empire; but thiey constitute less than one-hlalf of the population. The rest of the inrhabitants consist of Greeks, Albanians,
Armenians, Turcomans, Arabs, Kurds, Jews, and Gypsies. There is
no hlereditary nobility in Turkey; the only difference of rank being
thatb of office.

2. In soii and climate, this country is highly favoured; and
under a liberal government it would doubtless become one
of the most flourishing countries of Europe. The products
are corn, wheat, rice, cotton, silk, wine, oil, fruits, &amp;c.
3. The operations of agriculture and manufactures are but
negligently conducted. The commerce is chiefly carried on
by foreigners, and is mostly confined to the port of Constantinople. The inland trade is considerable, and is in the
hands of Greeks, Jews, Armenians, &amp;c.
4. The horses and cattle of this region are generally large and fine:
the former are from the Arabian stock. The Wallachian sheep are

remarkable for the singularity of their horns and wool: the latter is
long and straight, but rather coarse. The birds, particularly the waterfowl, are numerous, and of various kinds, among which the pelican
and flamingo are conspicuous.
5. The provinces of Wallachia, Moldavia, and Servia, usually included in European Turkey, are governed by their own princes, and are
in all respects independent, except that they pay a fixed tribute to the
Porte. The people of these provinces are much oppressed by their
rulers. They belong mostly to the Greek church.
6. Constantinople is the capital of the Ottoman Empire, and the
third city in Europe in population. Its situation is beautifuil, and its
harbour extensive and commodious. It presents a handsome appearance at a distance, but is found on examination to colsist of narrow,
crooked streets, with low, gloomy-looking houses, built of wood.

mosque of St. Sophia, once a christian church, is accounted the finest
In the world. Thle /Mosques of Sultan Achmet and of Suleyman are
large and splendid, but are not marked by the samne classic taste.
S. Adrianople is the second city in European Turkliey. It was long
the residence of the Sultans. Bucharest, the capital of Wallachia, is
a large dirty city, built in a swamp: the streets, instead of being paved
ill the usual way, are covered with planks. Belgrade, Widin, Silistria,
and Shlumla, are t all strongly-fortified towns. Serajevo, Salonica,
Sophia, and Joannina, are all places of some note.

ASIA.
1. Asrt is the largest and most populous of the great
divisions of the globe. It has been the seat of some of the
most powerful empires of ancient times, and the theatre of
many of the most interesting events recorded in history.
2. It was here our first parents were created, and from
this quarter the descendants of Noah peopled the world after
the flood. It was also the birth-place of our Saviour, the
scene of his miracles and death, and the field on which the
apostles first published salvation to man.
3. The vast expanse of Asia stretching through     almost
80 degrees of latitude, presents every variety of soil and climnate.  Its Iarge rivers are inferior only to the great streams
of the Western Continent, and its mountain chains are
among the most extensive in the world, and attain to a greater
height thanr those of any other region.

Asia.
4. Asia is distinguished for the great variety of its rich
productions.   It supplies the other parts of the world with
tea, with some of the finest spices and perfimes, and also
with silk, diamonds, and( precious stones of various kinds.
5. The institutions, manners and customs of the people
are the same at the present, as in the earliest tirnmes; and no
advance appears to have been made for a long period in arts,
sciences, or learning.
6. In disposition and temper, the people are grave, serious, and
recluse. The women are generally kept in ignorance, and are -not
taught reading or writing; they are also, in many parts of Asia,
regarded almost as slaves, live in strict retirement, and do not go abroad
without being closely veiled.
7. The governments of Asia are generally despotic, and their administration is frequently arbitrary and tyrannical. Robbery is often
practised as a regular'trade, even by chiefs and princes, and as a calling that they consider honourable and honest.
8. Agriculture is pursued in many parts of Asia, with great industry and care, but not with the same skill as in Europe. Many of the
manufactures, though conducted with the most simple tools and
machinery, are not surpassed in richness and beauty by those of any
other part of the world.

nd every degree into 60 geographical miles or minutes.
128. What is the length of a degree of a great circle?
A. It is 69~ common miles.
129. How will you find the number of miles in any given number
of degrees?
A. By multiplying the degrees by 69~.

LATITUDE.
130. What is latitude?
A. It is distance from the Equator either north or south.
131. How is latitude divided?
A. Into nlorth and south latitulde.  All countries situated
north of the equator, are in north latitude; and those south
of it, are in south latitude.
132. How is latitude represented on maps?
A. By lines drawn across the map from side to side.
Thlese are called parallels.
133. How is latitude numbered?
A. The numbers are marked on the sides of the map, at
the ends of the lines of latitude.
134. How is latitude counted?
A. In degrees from the Equator towards the poles, from 1
to 90.
135. How can you dietinguish between north and south latitude?
A. If the numbers increase from the bottom towards the278             DESCRIPTIVE       GEOGRAPHY.
9. A lucrative commerce has been carried on in this quarter, from
the earliest times. The internal trade by caravans, though not so important as that by sea, is yet very considerable. The foreign trade,
particularly that with China and India, is chiefly in the hands of the
English and Americans, and is extensive and valuable.
10. Some of the most remarkable animals of Asia, are the Elephant,
ore-hlorned Rhinoceros, Tiger, Leopard, and Musk Deer. The Horse,
Camel, Ass, Sheep, and Goat, are supposed to have had their origin in
this quarter, and with the Peacock, common Fowl, and Pheasant, have
been spread from'hence over other parts of the world. Gigantic Cranes,
as tall as a man, and the Cassowary, similar to the Ostrich, with an
infinite number of birds of brilliant and varied plumage, abound.
11. Crocodiles, different however from those of Africa, are found in
all the large rivers of the south; and Serpents exist in great variety,
from the gigantic Python and Anaconda, measuring from 12 to 20 feet
in length, to a species of only an inch and a half long, whose venom
causes the person bitten by it to fall into a deadly sleep.
12. Asia comprises a greater variety of different races of men, than
any other quarter of the world. The chief part of the inhabitants are
Pagans, whose modes of worship embrace various forms of idolatry.
Brahmins, Buddhists, worshippers of the Grand Lama, of Confucius,
and of spirits or genii, are the most prevalent: they number probably
360 mnillions; Mahometans, 80 millions; Christians, Jews, &amp;c., 10 millions: total, 450 millions.
13. Though nearly the whole of this vast multitude is involved in
heathen darkness, yet the exertions of Christian missionaries and the
distribution of the Scriptures in various Asiatic languages, will no doubt
in time enlighten the nations, and lead to the spiritual redemption of
this great continent.

ASIATIC RUSSIA.
1. ASIATIC RussIA is an immense region stretching from
the Ural Mountains to the Pacific Ocean. It comprises
Siberia, the countries situated between the Ural, and the Volga
rivers, and the Caspian and Black Seas; the last of which
is called Caucasian Russia.
SIBERIA.
2. SIBERIA contains nearly a third part of Asia, and is
mostly a cold, dreary region, occupied by wide and extensive
plains called steppes.   Some of its southern districts are
however rich and fertile.
3. Siberia serves as a place of banishment for convicts and
prisoner3 of state. -Some of these have been men of superior
talents, and have been banished only for their virtues and
adhlerence to liberal principles.
4. The Ural and Altay Mountains contain numerous mines, which
furnishl gold, silver, platina, and different kinds of precious stones.
Fur-bearing animals abound in Siberia, the skins of which form one
of the chief articles of its trade.
Its original inhabitants are composed of various ignorant and barbarous tribes, who live by hunting and fishing.
5. Tobolsk is the capital of Siberia: all the commerce of the country
passes thirough this city, and large caravans of mrnerchants trade between it and Khokan in Tartary. Irkoutsk, T'omsk, Yakoutsk, and
Ochotsk, are the next important towns. Kiachta is the only place at
which the trade with China is permitted.
6. The country lying between the Volga and Ural rivers contains the cities of Astrachan and Orenburg: the former derives its chief
wealth from its sturgeon fisheries; it has also an extensive trade with
the interior of Russia. Orenburg carries on a great trade by caravans
with Khokan, Bucharia, Khiva, and other Tartar-cities.

traces of its former civilizatj4n remain, except ruins.
2. Theislands of the Archil!elago, once celebrated for their wealth
and prosp rity, are now reduced to a more complete state of haarism
than even the continent.,4The principal of those, still under the control of the-Turks, are Rhodes, S?amnos, Scio, and Metelin.

of the Turklsh Empire.     It is, now under the control of the
ruler of Egypt; having,been conquered by him from the
Sultan, his former master, in the war of 1832.
6. No country was anciently m9e celebrated than,_Svria. In the

9. The surface is greatly diversified with mountains and valleys.
Of the former, Lebanon has been long noted for its tall cedars; Pisgah,
for the view it gave Moses of the Promised Land; Tabor, for the
transfiguration of Christ; and the Mount of Olives, for being the scene
of the ascension of the Saviour to heaven.
10. JeruLsalem, the once famous capital of the Jewish nation, where
David and Solomlon reigned, and which was so often the resort of
Christ anld his disciples, is now a gloomy, mean town, owing its chief
support to the veneration in which it is held by Christians, Jews, and
Mahomedans, which still procures it the visits of many pious pilgrims.
11. Bethlehern, six miles south ofJerusalem, is remarkable for being
the birth-place of our Saviour. Nazareth, where he resided until he
comnmenced his ministry, is, next to Jerusalem, the mnost holy place in
Palestine. Gaza, Joppa, and Acre, are the principal towns on the coast.

PERSIA.
1. PERSIA was, in early times, one of the most powerful
empires in Asia; but its ancient splendour is abridged, and it
presents scarcely a shadow of its former greatness.
2. Its mnountains and deserts are peopled by hordes of
robbers, who plunder the fertile and cultivated tracts.  Agriculture is discouraged by their incursions; and places forinerly well settled, are now, in a measure, deserted.
3. Silk is the staple produce of this country. Other productions are
wheat, rice,,cotton, tobacco, rhubarb, assafcetida, &amp;c. The Persians
manufacture beautiful carpets, shawls, silk, tapestry, arms, porcelain,
&amp;c. The foreign commerce is inconsiderable, and is now in the hands
of Europeans.
4. The people of Persia are the most learned and polite of the Eastern nations. They are lively and fond of show; skliilled in the use of
flattery and compliment; but are accused of dissimulation and insincerity.
5. Teheran, the capital of Persia, is a modern-built city, inhabited
by thle king, his court, and army, only during the winter months.
The population, in consequence, fluctuates from 10,000 to 60,000.
6. Ispahan, the ancient capital, ranked once among the most splendid
cities in the east. Though a great part of it is in ruins, it is still a
place of importance, with ail extensive trade, and considerable manuPersia. Q. - 1. What is said of Persia?  2. Mountains, &amp;c.?

environs. Reshld is the chief port on the Caspian Sea, and Bushire on
the Persian Gulf. Tabreez, Meshid, Yezd, Balfrush, and Kermnan, are
imrnportant cities.
AFGHANISTAN.
7. THE country lying between Persia and Hindoostan was
once a part of the Persian Empire. It is now divided into the
separate territories of Afghanistan and Beloochistan.
8. The inhabitants, called Afghans, are a bold and warlike race, simple in their manners, and of unbounded hospitality. There are schools
in every town and village, and in the encampments of the pastoral
tribes, so that a limited degree of educationl is very generally diffused.
9. Cabul, the capital of Afghanistan, enjoys a delightful climnate;
and is surrounded by a fertile, well-cultivated country. The next important towns are Peshawur and Candahar.
Herat is a very ancient city. It is the capital of a small independent
state; and is also imnportant on account of its manufactures and commerce.
BELOOCHISTAN.
10. BELOOCHISTAN is divided among a number of small
independent tribes, of whom the Beloochees are the chief.
They are mostly of warlike habits, and often make plundering incursions upon each other.
11. The Brahoos, unlike the other tribes, are peaceable, mild, and
industrious. They follow a pastoral life; and live in little villages
among the mountains.
This country has but few towns. Kelat, the principal, is the residence of a chief; or Khan, to whom some of the tribes are subject.

TARTARY.
1. TARTARY comrprehends all the central part of Asia,
stretching from the Caspian Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Its
great divisions are Independent Tartary, and Chinese Tartary.
2. Independent Tartary comnprises a number of small states
professing the Mahomedan faith, and governed by princes
called Khans. Chinese Tartary is under the control of the
Chinese government, and has for the most part adopted the
worship of the Grand Lama.
3. The inhabitants of this great region comprise several distinct
races. Those resident in Independent Tartary and Little Bucharia are
simnilar to thie Turks. The people of Soongaria or the Kalmucks, and
those of Mongolia called Mongols, are the true Tartars. The Mantchoos or people of Mantchooria, now the ruling race in China, differ in
some respects from all the others.

5. The four last are all fertile districts, inhabited by an inidustrious
people, who are chiefly engaged in agriculture and trade. The Usbecks
are the predominant race, hence this country is sometimes called
Usbeck Tartary.
6. An extensive commerce is carried on between these states and
Persia, H-indoostan, China, and Russia. The caravans proceed in large
bodies, and are well armed; consisting sometimes of several thousand
men, horses, and camels.
7. The principal cities are Bucharia, Khokan, Tashkent, Khiva, and
Samarcand. Bucharia, the capital of the territory of the same nlame,
contains numnerous mosques and colleges. It is the chief seat of
M/ahomedan learning in thllis quarter, and is visited by a great number
of students. Khiva is rather a fixed encamipment, than a regular
town; it is the principal slave.market in Tartary. Samarcand, onced
the most renowned city in Asia, is now nearly all in ruins.
8. The KIrGuis and TURCOMANS raise large numbers of horses and
camels, and wander about from place to place. The Turcomans often
carry away the inhabitants from the frontier Persian villages, and sell
ithem for slaves in the markets of Khiva and Bucharia.
CHINESE TARTARY.
9. C -HIN'ES, TARTARY    comprises Little Bucharia, Soongarla, Mongolia, and Mantchooria.      The chief part of this
region is an extensive elevated plain, bounded by ranges of
some of the most lofty mountains in Asia.
10. The whole territory, except that part of it occupied by the Great
Desert of Cobi,,appears to be better suited to grazing than agriculture,
and is inhabitedd principally by various roving tribes, who live in tents,
and raise great numbers of horses.
11. LITTLE BUCHARIA and SOONGARIA are the best-settled and most
frtile divisions of this territory: they contain several populous cities,
of which Goulja, Yarkand, and Cashgar, appear to be the chief.
12. MANTCHOORIA is watered by the great river Amoor; it contains
several cities and towns, and a stationary population in some parts.
Chin Yang is said to be the chief city in that district of it adjoining to
China.

INDIA.
1. INDIA has been always celebrated for its great fertility,
and the profusion of its rich and valuable products. It cornmprises two large peninsulas, situated betweeh the seas of
Arabia and China.    The western division is called HIindoostan, and the other Chin-India, or Fartlher India.
2. Both the peninsulas of lndia are remarkable for the
number and size of their rivers, whose waters and inundations,
united with the heat of the climate, make themn tlhe mnost
productive countries on earth.  The term East Indies is also
used very frequently for the whole of south-eastern Asia and
China.                                                    f

phanats, though sometimnes met witl, are rare. In Birmah anld Siam
they are believed to contain the spirit of some departed monarch, and,
as such, have the title of a king; and when taken abroad, the people
are obliged to prostrate themselves as before their actual sovereign.
HINDOOSTAN.
4. HINDOOSTAN is one of the most remarkable countries
in the east.  Its singular customs, and rich products, have
attracted the attention of the surrounding nations from    the
earliest period of history.
5.'I'he climate of the chief part of Hindoostan is that of
the torrid zone, which among the mountains is rendered temperate by elevation.   With the exception of a few     desert.
sandy tracks, the soil of this country is generally very fertile.
6. The agriculture is imperfect, though the produce is abundant.   Rice is the chief article of food, but other grains are
cultivated.  Cotton, silk, sugar, opium, tobacco, and indigo,
are all extensively prodLuced; also, coffee, pepper, cinnamon, &amp;c.
7. The cotton manufactures have been long celebrated for their fineness and beauty. Silk is an important maniufacture; and the shawls
of'Cashmere are unrivalled. The Hindoos excel in working gold and
silver; and in cutting, polishing, and setting precious stones.
8. The inland trade of Hindoostan is carried on by Banians, or
Hindoo merchants, Armenians, and Parsees. The foreign commerce
is in the hands of the English, Americans, &amp;c. This country produces
the fincst diamonds in the world; for, though those of Brazil are of
greater size, the diamonds of Golconda are superior in hardness and
brilliancy. Gold, iron, tin, and zinc, are amonog the minerals.
9. The Hindoos are in complexion almost black, with long hlair, straight
limbs, and pleasing countenances. They are an indolent and spiritless
race, excessively superstitious; and are described as being nearly destitute of moral honesty.
10. They are divided into four castes, or classes:-1. The Bramiins
ar priests. 2. The Rajah-pootras, or soldiers. 3. Vaisyas, or merchants
and farmers. 4. The Sudras, or labourers. These castes never intermarry, and do not evenl eat or drink together; and every succeeding
generation must belong to the same class as their parents.
11. The religion of the Hinidoos is a degrading systemn of paganism.
Bramah is the supreme deity, and there are many millions of inferior
divinities. They also worship the RPiver Ganges, the cow, ape, and

edans, with some Christians, both native and European, and Jews.
12. The chief part of Hindoostan is under the control of the British
East India companly. Their territory contains a population of about 85
millions; the tributary states 38 millions, total of the company's subjects
123 millions. To this must be added one million for the Island of
Ceylon, which is a colonly belonging to the crown. Total of British
India, 124 millions. Of this great multitude, the Europeans do not,
probably, exceed 50,000 inidividuals. The independent states contain
about 16 million inhabitants.
13. Great efforts are now making by various mnissionary societies for
introducing Christianity into India. Many of the natives have renounced their false gods; and some of them have even become missionaries.
191
View in Calcutta.
14. Calcutta, the capital of British India, is the largest city in Hindoostan. It is situated about 100 miles from the sea, on the Hoogly
branlch of the Ganges; and, properly, comprises two divisions. Chouringee, the part inhabited by the English, is a city of palaces; while
the Black Town, inhabited by the Hindoos, is an assemlblage of
thatched mud huts.
15. Bombay, the capital of Western British India, is noted for its cominmerce and ship-building. Madras, the capital of Southern British
India, is situated on a flat sandy shore, and has no harbour. It presents

CHIN-INDIA.
1. CHIN-INDIA, or Farther India, is situated between Hin-i
doostan and China. It comprises the empires of Birmah and
Anam, the kingdom of Siam, the British territories, and the
petty states of Malacca. It is a well-watered, fertile region,
and is prolific in various tropical products.
Chin.India. Q. -1. Describe Chin-India. 2. The inhabitants. The294              DESCRIPTIVE GEOGRAPHY.
2. Nearly all the inhabitants of this region profess the
religion of Buddha, or Guadama. Great attention is paid by
them to the building of costly temples, which are very gaudily ornamented with gilding, painting, and varnishing. The
war-boats of these nations, especially of the Birmans, are
often 10t feet long, but very narrow.     They carry from 80
to 1 00t) men, with a small cannon at the prow.
3. The governments of Chin-India are completely despotic. The
nobles show the most profound submission to their sovereign, lying
prostrate on their faces, and creeping on the ground befbre him; and
every male subject above 20 years of age, excepting the priests and
public officers, mnust serve the government three years, either as a soldier or a labourer.
4. In all these countries, the morals of the people are in a low state;
and the women, in general, are Jittle better than slaves, being obliged
to performn the principal part of the hard labour; and, in Anam, they
likewise conduct all the operations of buying and selling.

only from the beginning of the present century. It cornprises Tonquin, CQchin-China, and Cambodia, with part of
Laos.
9. The late Enlperor Caung Shung, organized his armny and navy,
conrstructed fortresses, and establislled armories after the European
nimanner; he thus acquired a formidable military force, and was enrabled
to add to his original possessions the important territories of Tonqluin
and Cambodia.
10. Hue, the capital, is an immense fortification, built in the European
style; 100,000 men were employed on the works during the period of
their construction, and 1,200 cannon were mounted on the walls.
Saigon, in Cambodia, is the chief sea-port of the emnpire: it contains a
royal arsenal, and catrries onan extensive comrnmerce.
SIAM.
11. Siam   is a considerable kingdom, situated       between
Birmah and Anam; its territory, watered by the Meinam
river, is fertile and highly prolific in various tropical productions. The people are mild and courteous, but cunning
and avaricious.
12. Bankok, the capital, is situated on the river Meinam, and may be
regarded almost as a city floating on the water; many of the houses
are built upon rafts moored in the river, and call be easily moved from
place to place; these are inhabited chiefly by Chinese, who constitute
a large portion of the population.
BRITISHI POSSESSIONS.
13. The British possessions in Chin-India, comprise a strip
of territory lying south of the Burrampooter river, and another south of the Salwen; these were both acquired at the
close of the late war with Birmah.
14. Arracan and Amnherst are the chief towns: to these may be
added the town and territory of Malacca, Pulo Pinang, or Prince of
Wales Island, and the city of Singapore; the latter was founded in
1820, and declared a free port. It has in consequence acquired an
extensive commerce. Its population has'doubled in amount since 1828

CHINESE EMPIRE.
1. THE Chinese empire contains the greatest number of
inhabitants subject to anyone government in the world.  It
embraces China, Chinese Tartary, Corea, and Thibet. The
population of the whole is supposed to be 230 millions. The
great mass of the people are Chinese; but the ruling race, to
which the Emperor belongs, is the Mantchoo, by whom China
was conquered, in 1644.

CHINA.
2. CHINA    comprises a territory about three-fourths the
size of the United States.  It is noted for the great antiquity
of its government; the singularity of its mnanners and customs; and for its jealous and reserved policy towards other
nations.
3. The soil and climate, from the great extent of country,
are extremely various. The former is cultivated with the
greatest care, in every part: even the mountains and rocks
are made to yield some useful product.
4. Manufactures are numerous; and many of them have been carried, by the Chinese, to a state of considerable perfection.  Foreign
commerce is carried on at Canton, chiefly with the English and Americans, in tea, silks, cotton, and china.-ware.
5. The export of tea alone to Great Britain and the United States is
about 60 millions of pounds, annually. The inland trade of China, by
means of the numerous rivers and canals, is very extensive. The
Grand, or Imperial canal is the largest in the world, being 600 miles
in length.&gt; It is said to have employed' 30,000 men upwards of 40
years in its construction.
6. The great wall which bounds China on the north is, probably, the
greatest work ever accomplished by man. It is 1,500 miles in length,
24 feet in height, and of such thickness, that six horsemen can easily
ride abreast upon it. It was built 2,000 years ago, as a defence against
the Tartars.

each way; therefore the longitude of a place cannot be more
than 180 degrees east or west.
150. How is it marked?
A. It is generally marked in numbers on the top and bot.
tom of the mnap, at the end of the meridians.
On map of the world, No. 1, the longitude is marked on the Equator,
in consequence of a want of room at the ends of the lines; but Onl maps
Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. it is marked at the top and bottom of the maps.
151. How can you distinguish between east and west longitude?
A. If the numbers increase towards the right hand, it is
east longitude; but if they increase towards the left hand, it
is west longitude.
152. Are the degrees of longitude, like those of latitude, all of the
same length?
A. T'hey are of the same length as those of latitude at the
Equator only.
153. How do they differ from those of latitude?
A. They constantly decrease as we go either north or
south from the equator towards the poles, where the meridians
all meet, and the longitude ceases.
14
154. What is the meaning of thlle word longitude?
A. It signifies length.  It was used for this purpose because
formerly the earth was supposed to be much longer from East
to West than from North to South.
155. On some of the maps the longitude is markled on the top from
Greenwich, and on the bottom from Washington, the difference being
77 degrees. The same lines serve to express the longitude of both
piaces, and are numbered accordinrgly.
156. How do nations generally reckon longitude?
A. From the capital of their own country.
157. We reckon ours from the city of Washington;-the English from
Greenwich; the French from Paris; and the Spaniards from Madrid.
158. On the Equator a degree of longitude is 691- miles in length; at
24 degrees of latitude it is only three-fourths of that extent; at 60 degrees
it is one half; at 75 degrees one quarter; and at the poles it is nothing.
159. Places on the Equator have no latitude, and those on the first me.
ridian no longitude; therefore, at the point where the first meridian
crosses the Equator, there is neithler latitude nor longitude.

7. The chief beauty of the women, in this country, is thought to be
the smallness of their feet, which are bound up from infancy in order
to prevent their growing to the natural size. The shoes of a Chinese
lady are about four inches in length, and two in breadth.
8. Thie principal food used is rice; but the poorer classes eat rats,
mice, and puppies; and often suffer from famine. Soups made of
edible birds'-nests, sea-slug, and othler gummy substances, are among
the luxuries of the rich.
9. Learnisig is highly esteemed in China. They have many books,
on various subjects, yet are very deficient in true literature and science.
The Mandarins, or great officers, employed in the administration of the
government, owe their rank and title entirely to their skill in letters.
Chinese Military.
10. The army of China is said to amount to 800,000 men; but,
compared with European soldiers, their appearance is most unmilitary.
Their paper helmets, wadded gowns, quilted petticoats, and clumsy
satin boots, present nothing of the aspect of war. Th''ere are a few
small armed vessels to suppress smuggling and piracy, but nothing that
can be called a navy.
11. The Chinese are, in many respects, a civilized people, and are
distinguished for order, industry, and regularity; but their treatmnent of
females, exposing of infants, and general disregard of truth, are circumstances which lower them in the scale of nations, and rank them
below the least civilized of anly of the Christian communities.
12. The religion of Fo and Buddha is professed by the chief part
of the people; but the learned men worship the spirit of their great
philosopher, Confucius. There are also some Mahomedans and Roman
Catholics in China. The government is desp'otic, and is conducted
with great form and ceremony. The Emnperor is styled the Soni of
Heaven; and when he goes abroad, the houses and shops must be shut,
and all that he meets must prostrate themselves on the ground.

13. Pekin, the capital of China, is one of the largest cities in the
world. It contains two distinct towns, the Chinese and Tartar, of
which the former is the most elegant and populous; but the latter is
adorned by the imperial palace and gardens. The shops are very
numnerous, and principally only one story high: they are adorned withl
flags, varnish, paintings, and lanterns. The streets are immensely
crowded, for the Chinese spend mnuch of their timrne in the open air.
14. Nankin, the ancient capital, is mnuch larger than Pekin; but it
is now greatly decayed, and is noted for its porcelain tower, and its
manufactures of nankeen.
Canton is the only port at which Europeans are allowed to trade and
reside. Its commerce is very great, and it is said that 5000 vessels are
often seen lying before the city at once. Shanghlae is, next to Canton,
the greatest commiercial city of China. Teentsin is the port of Pekin,
and a great emporium for salt; its inhabitants have more resemblance
to Europeans, than those of any other part of the empire. Sootchow,
Hangtchow, Kingteching, and Voutchang, are all populous cities, and
situated in the midst of rich and fertile districts.

THI B ET.
1. TIiIBET is a cold elevated region, bounded by ranges
of the highest mountains on the globe; and some of the
largest rivers on the eastern continent takle their rise within
its territory.  This country, together with Bootan and Little
Thibet, all belong to China.
2. The soil is sterile, and vegetation is scanty; but the people possess
large herds of cattle. The musk deer, broad-tailed sheep, and shawl
goat, are soeie of the chief anlimals of this country; the latter furnishes
the fine wool, of which the valuable shawls of Cashmere are made.
3. Thibet is the chlief seat of the religion of Buddha, called Fo in
China, and Shamnanism in Tartary. The Grand Lama is the head of
this system, and is considered as the Creator himself, dwelling in a
human form; and when he dies, the divine spirit is supposed to pass
into another body, known by certain signs to the priests only.
4. Lassa is the religious capital of Central Asia, and the residcnce
of the Chinese governor. Not far from the city, is the temple or palace
of the Grand Lama; it is said to contain ten thousand rooms: the
towers and obelisks of the building are covered withi gold and silver,
and there are innumerable imnages of Buddha of gold, silver, and other
metals.

COREA.
1. CGREA is a large peninsula, situated between China and
Japan. The people have no intercourse with any nation, except the Chinese and Japanese, and are consequently but
little known.
2. This kingdom is ruled by a sovereign, who pays homage and
tribute to China. The arts, learning, and writtei language of that
country are in use in Corea; but the spoken language is entirely different. Kingkitao, the capital, is situated nearly in the centre of the
country.

EMPIRE OF JAPAN.
3. THE empire of Japan comprises the islands of Niphon,
Kiusiu, and'Sikoke, with the southernmost of the Kurile islands.
The people, like the Chinese, are very jealous of Europeans;
so that our knowledge of the country is rather limited.
4. The agriculture is in a highly improved state.     Rice,
wheat, sugar, cotton, and tobacco, are extensively cultivated,
and the tea-plant grows wild in the hedges.     The manufactures are numerous, and include silk, cotton, porcelain, and
lackered or Japan ware, in which, and the working of metals,
the Japanese excel. Gold, silver, and copper, are the principal minerals found in this country.
5. Japan is one of the most civilized nations in Eastern Asia. The
people pay great attention to the educationi of their children, and females
are irsstructed with the same care as the other sex. They rigorously
exclude foreigners from the empire, and permit none but the Chinese,
Coreans, and Dutch, to have intercourse with themi. The latter are
subject to much indignity, yet they submit to it for the sake of the
profits of the trade.
6. The worship of Buddha, of Confucius, and of spirits, or genii,
prevails in Japan. The last is called the, religion of Sinto.  The
government is absolute; and there are two monarchs: the Kubo, or
commander in chief of the army, is the real sovereign; while the
Dairi is the spiritual head of the empire. He lives retired, in his palace
at Miaco, and seldom ventures abroad, cxcept on a visit to some of the
great temples.
7. The laws are extremely severe, and are rigorously executed.
The security of person and property is, in consequence, rendered very
complete. Great crimes and capital punishmnents are, perhaps, more
rare here than in almost any other nation. Cutting to pieces, and immersion inl boiling oil, are commnon modes of punishing the guilty.
The parent is made to suffer for the crimes of the child, and the child
for those of the parent.
8. Jedo, the capital, is one of the largest cities in the world. It is
seven miles, long, and five broad; and contains many palaces of the
great lords, who must reside here part of the year. The buildings, on
account of the frequency of earthquakes, are built of one story only.
The city is subject to dreadful fires, one of which, in the year 1701,
consumed 100,000 houses.

an image of Buddha, 83 feet high. Osaca is a large city in Niphlon.
It is, like Venice, intersected by nunmerous canals. Nangasaki, in
liusiu, is the only port at whicli foreigners are allowed to trade. The
Dutch are here restricted to a small island, where they are allowed a
space of only 600 feet long, by 120 wide, in which to carry on their

AFR ICA.
1. AFRICA is the third in size among the great divisions
of the globe, being about one-third less than Asia, and three
times larger than Europe.    It is a vast peninsula, joined to
Asia by the Isthmus of Suez.
2. This quarter of the world is almost wholly in a state
of barbarism; yet, in ancient times its northern countries
were among the most enlightened in the world, and still have
written languages.   They are now, however, among the
lowest of the half-civilized nations.
3. Africa is the hottest region of the globe; and lies mostly
within the tropics; and the influence of a tropical climate extends even to those portions which are in the temnperate zones.
The most striking natural feature is the great desert, which
extends 3,000 miles in length, and 1,000 in breadth.     It is
covered with sand and gravel; and appears like the bottom of
a dried-up sea.

Africa.
4. The rivers of Africa are but few in number; and none
of them are navigable, to any extent, for large vessels. The
principal streams are the Niger and the Nile.    The latter is
remarkable for flowing sixteen hundred     miles without receiving a single tributary.
5. The mountains are, generally, more distinguislhed for
their extent than their elevation.   The Atlas Mountains in
Barbary, the Mountains of the Moon in central, and the Snow
Mountains in southern     Africa, are the principal.    Other
ranges, as the Crystal Mountains in Congo, and the Lupata
Mountains on the east coast, are so little known, that even
their very existence is doubted.
~ 6. The principal Afi'icaen animals are the elephant, hippopotamnus,
camelopard or giraffe, and the two-horned rhinoceros, withl the lion,
leopard, zebra, &amp;c. TI'he African lion is the noblest animal of his race;
those found elsewherc being much inferior in size and strengthl. The
antelopes comprise not less than sixty different species: of these, the
springbok is found in troops of' several thousands.'Thie camiel in nortlhern, and the ass in western Afirica, are the chief beasts of burden, and
are often employed in lorng and painful journeys.

eater is remarkable for devouring the most noxious of the serpent tribe.
The sociable vulture, as large as thl-e condor, and simnilar in its habits,
is found among all the high mountains of the interior. The bustard
and guinea-fowl, with grouse, partridges, and water-fowl of various
kinds, are numerous.
8. Crocodiles are found in all the rivers of the tropical parts of
Africa; and serpents, scorpions, and lizards of various kinads, abound.
The white ants are singular insects. They build nests 10 or 12 feet
high, which are divided into-apartmrnents with magazines for provisions,
arched chambers, and galleries of communication.
9. Africa has fewer great kingdoms than Asia or Europe. It is
chiefly divided into a number of petty states, whose governments are
rude and despotic. The operations of agriculture and manufactures
are very imperfectly performed; yet, owing to the fertility of the soil,
the products of the former are in many places very abundant.
10. The chief trade of the interior is carried on by caravans, consisting of numbers of camels, which cross the desert in various directions; and perform, on this sea of sand, the business accomplished by
ships on the ocean. Commerce, on the northern and western coasts, is
carried on mostly by Europeans, and on the east by the Arabs.
11. Africa has furnished slaves to Christian and other nations for
hlundreds of years; and the traffic, though somewhat checked of late,
is still actively carried on.
Great Britain and the United States were formerly deeply engaged
in it; but both nations have forbidden it; and it is punished as piracy
by the latter power. The French, Spanish, and Portuguese, still pursue
the trade on certain parts of the African coast.

belong to the Caucasian race. T'hey are chiefly Mahomedans; and
though superior in knowledge to the African races, are still rude and
barbarous.

BARBARY.
1. BARBARY is that part of northern Africa which includes
Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, together with the interior region called Beled el Jerid, or Land of Dates.
2. It is traversed some distance inland by the Atlas Mountains, between which and the sea-coast the clirnate is mild,
and the soil is, generally, fertile, but l)oorly cultivated. Wheat
and barley are the principal products; but grapes, olives,
almonds, dates, and other fruits, are raised in great perfection.
3. The foreign commerce of the Barbary states is extremely
limited, and much burthened with arbitrary exactions. The
exports consist principally of the raw produce of the soil.
The most active traffic is that carried on by the caravans
with the interior country south of the Great Desert.;
4. Piracy was once the chief employment of the people of
this, region.  Many vessels were captured, and numbers of
European and American sailors were enslaved by them; but
this practice, so long a disgrace to Christendom, rio longer
exists.
5. Barbary is inhabited by several distinct races. The Moors, who
are the ruling people, inhabit the towns. The Arabs, originally from
the Great Desert, live in tents; and raise cattle and grain. In reBarbary. Q. -1. What does Barbary include? 2. By what is it

6. The Shelluhs inhabit the Atlas Mountains, and live chiefly by
hunting and cultivating the ground.   They belong to the Berber race,
supposed to have been the first inhabitants of this part of the continent.
The Kabyles of Algiers, the Tuaricks and Tibboos of the Great
Desert, and part of the inhabitants of Nubia, all appear to be the same
people. There are also numbers of Jews in Barbary, who are much
oppressed, and heavily taxed; but, being allowed to engage in trade, often
becomre wealthy. Besides these races, there are mnany negroes, brought
originally from  Soudan, who in Morocco form     the chief part of the
mnilitary force of the empire.

once considerable, is now almost destroyed. The only important manufacture is that of Morocco leather, which is superior to any made
elsewhere.
10. The city of Morocco, the capital, is situated in a fertile, thicklywooded plain, near the foot of the Atlas Mountains. It is enclosed by
a wall, and is surrounded by numerous gardens. Fez was, for a long
time, the most splendid city of western Africa. It is now much decayed, and a great portion of it is in ruins.
11. Mequinez is sometimes the residence of the emperor. Its inhabitants are more civilized and humane than those of any other city
of Morocco. Mogadore is the chief sea-port. Rabat is one of the
most important towns on the coast. Sallee, almost adjoining it, was
long noted for its piracies, but is now nearly deserted.

ALGIERS.
1. ALGIERS occupies the territory of the ancient Numidia.
The people of this state were the most enterprising and
daring pirates in Barbary, and formerly maintained a naval
force which rendered the name of Algerines a terror to the
people of southernl- Europe.  It was conquered by France in
1830, and is now held as a colonial territory.
2. The city of Algiers is strongly fortified. It has a good harbour,
and carries on a considerable trade. It is now a half French and half
Moorish town. The invading army captured in this city 10 million
dollars in money, besides an ample supply of ships, stores, and ammunition.
3. Constantine, Mascara, and Tlemsen, are the most important towns
in the interior. Oran in the west and Bona in the eastern part of the
territory, are the most considerable sea-ports; the latter is the seat of

TUNIS.
4. TUNIS is the most fertile and best cultivated of the
Barbary States, and the people are at the same time the most
civilized and industrious in this quarter.
5. Of the products of the country, grain, dates, olive-oil, and wool,
are exported to some extent. There is a considerable traffic also carried
on with interior Africa.
6. The city of Tunis is the largest and most flourishing place in
Barbary, and being no longer engaged in piracy, has applied itself to
manufactures and commerce; of the former, silk stuffs and velvets are
the most considerable. Kairwan, Moniaster, and Cabes, are important
towns.
TRIPOLI.
7. TRIPOLI is the most eastern, and is also the least fertile and populous part of Barbary. Its sovereign is more
friendly to Christians, and has shown a greater desire to
introduce the improvements of civilized life into his dominions,
than any other prince in this part of the world.
8. The territory of Tripoli is nearly all a desert, but contains some
fertile districts along the sea-coast, in which agriculture is actively
pursued. An extensive commrerce by means of caravans is carried on
with the countries of interior Africa. Fezzan, the great emporiumn of
the caravan trade, is tributary to this state. Barca and Augela, also,
belong to it.

Mesurata is, next to the capital, the most important town.
BARCA.
10. B  RCA, the ancient Libya, is separated from Tripoli
by an extensive desert. It was in ancient times noted for its
productiveness, but hardly any part of its soil is niow cultivated. The inhabitants are chiefly Arabs, who wander about
the country with their flocks and herds.

BELED EL JERID.
1. TaHE Beled el Jerid, or Land of Dates, stretches along
the northern edge of the Great Desert, from the Atlas Mountains on the west, to the firontiers of Tripoli on the east.
2. The soil, though dry and arid, produces dates in great abundance,
which form the chief food of the inhabitants. This region comprises
several petty states, which are peopled by various tribes of Berbers and
Arabs.
Beled el Jerid. Q.- 1. What is said of tlhe Beled el Jerid?!2. Soil?THE   GREAT     AFRICAN     DESERT.           311
3. Nearly all the towns are surrounded by walls, and are inhabited
some by tNwo and others by three different tribes. They are in consequence divided into corresponding sections. Furious contests often
occur between the tribes in these towns, in which event the gates connecting the different quarters are closed, until peace is restored..Eg,hwaat, Tuggurt, and Gadames, are the principal towns.
THE GREAT DESERT.
4. THE Great Desert stretches with but little interruption
from the Atlantic ocean to the river Nile. It is composed
of vast sandy plains, swept by hot winds and parchled by a
burning sun.
5. The Desert is here and there diversified wi'lh watered
and fertile spots, called oases; of these, Fezzan, -Tibesty,
Bilmah, Agdass, and Tuat, appe'ar to be the principal. That
part of the Great Desert extending from Fezzan to theAtlan.
tic ocean, is called by the Arabs the Sahara, while the eastern and smaller section is most usually termed the Libyan
Desert.
6. Fezzan is the largest of the oases, and is tributary to Tripoli.
Its people, reckoned at 70,000, possess but little energy of character,
and' are imperfectly acquainted with the alts. It is principally important as the centre of the caravan trade. Mourzulk, the capital, is a
small mud-walled town.

7. Thle central part of the Desert is occupied by the Tibboos and
the Tuaricks. The former are as black as negroes, buLtof a different
aspect. Bilmah appears to be their principal district. The Tuaricliks
are a tall handsome race, with bright sparkling eyes and complexions,
but little darker than southern Europeans. Agdass and T'imbuctoo
are said to be in their possession.
8. In crossing the Great Desert, travellers are often plundered by the
barbarous inhabitants; their lives are also endangered by the sand
blown up by tempests, which fills and darkens the air, and threatens to
suffocate and overwhelm themn. The occasional failures of water at
the usual stopping-places, is likewise often attended with fatal consequences; from the latter cause in the year 1805, a caravan of 1,800
camels, and 2,000 men, perished with thirst.'
9. On the sea-coast of the descrt are various wandering and predatory tribes, who often meet with a rich booty in the vessels shipwrecked
on their shores, and which are always plundered with,the greatest
avidity. In different parts of the desert, there are minres of rock salt;
the extensive demand for which in Soudan causes the surface of this
dreary region to be often enlivened by the passage of numerous caravans.

THE REGION OF THE NILE.
1. THE Region of the Nile comrnprehends all that part
of Africa watered by the river Nile and its tributaries.       It
comprises Egypt, Nubia, Abyssinia, Kordofan, Darfur,
Fertit, &amp;c.
EGYPT.
2. EGYPT is celebrated for its great antiquity, and the early
civilization of its inhabitants. Its mighty pyramids, splendid
obelisks, and the ruins of its ancient cities, all attest its former
magnificence.

313
3. It was, until lately, a Turkish province; but the present
ruler has rendered liimself independent of his former mnaster;
and is introducing into Egypt the arts, learning, and civilization of European nations. The great mass of the people are
however, much oppressed by heavy exactions; and are frequently torn from   their families, and compelled to serve in
the armies or fleets of their military ruler.
4. The soil of Egyp' is naturally biarren, and owes all its'fertility to
the overflowing of the rivcs Nile, which enrichles thle country instead
of rain. Agriculture is diligently pursued; and in many parts of the
country three crops of somne products are raised, annually.  Indiancorn, rice, wheat, sugar-cane, indigo, tobacco, cotton, &amp;c., are the chief
productions.
5. The inhabitants are of various races. The Arabs are the most
numerous. The Turks are the ruling people; and the Cop)ts are the
descendants of the ancient Egyptians. There are also a numrnber of
Jews, and a few Europeans. The latter are chiefly in the service of
the government.
6. The foreign pssessions of Egypt are Nubia and Kordofan in
Africa; Syria, Mecca, Yemen, and the Island of Cyprus, in Asia, with,
the Island -of Canadia in Europe. The population of this new empire
is, probably, not less than 8 millions.

largest is 500 feet high, and its base covers 11 acres of ground. Ancient historians state that 100,000 men were employed in this work for
20 years.
8. At Thebes, in Upper Egypt, are remains which are calculated to
fill the beholder with astonishment. Almost the whole extent of eight
mniles along the river is covered with magnificent portals, decorated
with sculpture, forests of columns, andlong avenues of colossal statues.
Cairo.
9. Cairo, the capital of Egypt, is the most populous city in Africa;
and carries on a considerable trade with the interior of the continent
by caravans. This place is beginning to imbibe some of the elements
of European civilization. A scientific society, and various schools have
been lately established. Hotels are kept on the plan of those in Paris;
and steam-boats navigate the Nile from Alexandria to some distance
above Cairo.
10. Alexandria was one of the most celebrated cities of ancient times;
and long the seat of the arts and sciences. After being for ages in a
state of decay, it is at length reviving.  It is now the chief sea-port
and naval station of Egypt. Vessels of nearly every European nation
are to be found in its harbour; and steam-boats run to all the principal
ports and islands in the Mediterranean. Damietta and Rosetta are the
chief towns in Lower, and Siout and Girge in Upper Egypt. Suez and
Cosseir, on the Red Sea, possess some trade.

9. The people are in some respects superior to the nations arpund
thlem, and have some knowledge of the arts; yet their manners are
extremely cruel and licentious. At their feasts, they eat raw flesh cut
from the animnal while yet warm. Intoxication is fiequent, a plurality
of wives is common, and great depravity of manners prevails.
10. The religion of Abyssinia is a corrupt kind of Chlristianity, intermixed with Jewish rites and ceremonies. Circumcision is practised.
Baptismn and the Lord's Supper are administered, and Saturday and
Sunday are both observed as a sabbath. The churches are numerous,
and are much adorned with paintings. Learning is extremely limited,
being confined to the priests, and is connected principally with their
system of religion.
11. This coulntry was formerly under one government, but now comprises three divisions-Tigre, Amhara, and Shoa arnd Efat. Some of
the provinces have been conquered by the Galla, a most ferocious and
brutal people, who in their incursions spare neither age nor sex. They
perform immense marchles, swim rivers, and endure incredible fatigue.
12. Gondar, the capital of Amhara, is the largest city in Abyssinia,
and is said to be eight or ten miles in circuit. Antalo and Adowa are
the other principal towns. Axum, the ancient capital of Abyssinia, is
now in ruins, but is remarkable for its antiquities. Massuah, a port
belonging to Egypt, is the only place through which the trifling foreign
trade of this country is carried on.

2.'Thle inhabitants are rude, ignorant, and barbarous. Their chiefs
are cruel and despotic, and in some parts are regarded by their subjects
as a sacred race. Mahomedanism is the religion of many tribes; but
Fetechlism, or the wqrship of snakes, lizards, and other disgusting objccts,
prevails to a great extent.
3. The slave-trade has been carried on by Europeans firom this region
to a greater extent than from any other part of Africa; and, notwithstandinlg the exertions madeto suppress it, numbers of slaves are still
carried off.
SENEGAMBIA.
4. SENEGAMLBIA stretches from       the Great Desert to the
colony of Liberia. It contains a number of different states,
of which Foota Jallon, Bambouk, and Soolimana, all in the
interior, appear to be the principal.
5. The inhabitants of FOOTA JALnON belong to the Foulah nation, who
are widely dispersed over Western and Central Africa. They are the
most civilized people of this region, and have dark olive complexions,
with high and often pleasing features. The Jaloffs and Mandingocs are
also importanrt races, but differ from the Foulahs in their complexion
and general appearance.
6. The French, English, and Portuguese, have settlements established on various parts of the coast, for the purpose of trading with the
natives for slaves, ivory, gum-arabic, and gold-dust.

SIERRA LEONE.
7. THE British Colony of Sierra Leone was established in
1787, for the purpose of introducing the Christian religion
and civilization into Africa.
8. The bulklof the inhabitants are liberated slaves, taken from captured slave-ships. The population of the colony is about 30,000, of
whom not more than 100 are whites; the extreme unhealthiness of the
climate rendering it almost impossible for them to reside here with
safety. Freetowvn is the capital of Sierra Leone, besides which there
are 8 or 10 villages.  
LIBERIA.
9. LIBERIA, now the most interesting country in Africa, is
an American colony, founded in 1821, by the American
Colonization Society, as a place of refuge for the free negroes
and emancipated slaves of the United States.
10. Many have emigrated thither, and the colony is in a flourishing
condition. Several of the neighbouring tribes have put themselves
under its protection, and are endeavouring to imitate its customs and
learn its arts. The slave-trade has been abolished within the\ limits of
Liberia. Several vessels, built at Monrovia, trade along the coast with
the native tribes, for gold, ivory, palm-oil, &amp;c., in exchange for American and European manufactures.
11. The first settled and chief town is Monrovia; it contains upwards of 500 houses, including churches, schools, a public library, &amp;c.
There are ten other towns and villages which are situated at various
points on the coast, from the St. Paul's river to Cape Palmas. The
territory of Liberia extends along the sea-shore about 300 miles: it
contains 5,000 colonists, and 20,000 natives.

UPPER GUINEA.
1. UPPER GUINEA extends from       Seaegambia to Biafra.
The coast is -divided by navigators into the Grain, Ivory,
Gold, and Slave Coasts: these are so named from the chief
objects of trade at the respective places.
2. Besides part of the colony of Liberia, this region contains the native kingdoms of Ashantee, Dahomey, Benin, &amp;c.
also some English, Dutch, and Danish settlements.
3. The kingdom of ASHANTEE is situated to the north of the Gold
Coast, and is the most important native state in Western Africa. The
inhabitants possess some of the comforts of civilization, but live notwithstanding, in a state of shocking barbarity.
4. The horrid custom of sacrificing human beings at the decease of
the sovereign, or any of the royal famnily, prevails to a great extent,
and three thousand victims are said to have been immolated on the
grave of the king's mother, on one occasion only.
The houses in Coomassie, the capital, are neat and well-built. The
streets are all named, and are each under the charge of a captain.
5. The GOLD COAST contains a number of European settlements or
factories, founded for the purpose of trading with the natives for gold
dust, the most valuable product of the country. Cape Coast Castle is
the principal of the British factories, Elmina of the Dutch, and Christiansburg of the Danes; these are all fortified and have small garrisons.
6. DAHOMEY, on the Slave Coast, is a fertile country: it is inhabited
by a warlike and ferocious people, whose manners and customs are
even more cruel and barbarous than those of the Ashantees. Abomey is
the capital.
BENIN is but little known: the king is not only absolute, but is considered a god in the eyes of his subjects, and all crimes against him
are punished both as treason and impiety.
LOWER GUINEA.
7. THE principal countries comprised in Lower Guinea,
are Loango, Congo, Angola, and Benguela. The sea-coast
of these countries is known to navigators by the name of
the Coast of Angola, or simply the Coast.
8. BIAFRA, CALBONGAS, and GABooN, lying south of the Niger river,
are reported to be fertile and populous countries, but are seldom visited.

]~OANGO possesses a fine climate and a fertile soil; the slave trade is
carried on to some extent from its chief ports, Cabenda and Loango.
9. CoNGo, ANGOLA, BENGUELA, and MATEMBA, are situated to the
southward of the river Congo. The whole region is said to be fertile,
though in some parts but thinly peopled. These territories were discovered by the Portuguese in 1487, and ever since that time have been
under their control; but their authority in the interior is supposed to be
only nomrinal.
10. CASSANGE and M,OOLOOA are countries reported to be far inland.
The inhabitants of the latter are more civilized and industrious thani
thlose on the coast, yet the atrocious custom of humlan sacrifice prevails. St. Salvador is the principal town of Congo. St. Paul de Loando
and St. Felipe de Benguela, ait the chief sea-ports: from these the
slave-trade is carried on to some extent.
11. The CIMBEBAS COUNTRY extends five hundred miles southward
firom Benguela. The whlole coast appears to be a desert, but tlec
interior of the country is wvell fitted for pasturage. The inhabitants
are a simple and inoffensive race; they are clothed in ox-hides and
possess large herds of cattle.

SOUTHERN AFRICA.
1. SOUTHERN AFRICA comprises nearly all that part of
the continent which lies south of the tropic of Capricorn. Its
subdivisions are the Cape Colony, Caffraria, the country of
the Hottentots, and the country of the Boshuanas.
2. The CAPE COLONY was settled by the Dutch in 1615. It was
twice conquered by Great Britain, and was finally confirmed to that
power in 1815.

the great Karroo, a dry plain, destitute, for the most part, of vegetationo
The farmers of the Colony, called Boors, occupy very extensive iarms;
and raise large herds of cattle.
4. Cape Town is an imnportant station, being the only place of re.
freshment for vessels between Europe and America on the one side,
and the East Indies, Chlina, and Australasia, on the other, Graham's
Town is the next most im-portant place.
CAFFRARIA.
5. CAFFRARIA extends eastward from the Cape Colony to St. Lucia
River. The inhabitants, called Caffres, are divided into several tribes.'They are an athletic vigorous people, of a deep-brown colour, and with
frizzled, thoughl not woolly hair.
6. War, hunting, and tending their cattle, of which they have large
herds, are the employment of the men. The women cultivate the soil
build the huts, cut wood, and make baskets of reeds so closely woven
as to hold milk.
7. The missioinaYies had made a favourable impression on some of
the Caffres; but the recent war with the British colonists has destroyed,
in a great measure, the good effects of these labours, and forced the
missionaries to leave the country.

quiet, inoffensive, ignorant race; but are very filthy in their habits,
and uncomnmonly ugly in person. Some of them have been taught by
the missionaries to cultivate the ground, raise cattle, and work at a
few of the most common trades.
9. The Bushmen, or Wild Hottentots, go almost naked, and reside in
holes made in the ground, or clefts in thie rocks. They use poisoned
arrows in war, or in destroying wild beasts. They display some ingenuity in disguising themrselves in imitation of the ostrich, and thus
are enabled to approach that shy animal sufficiently near to destroy it.
Kurreechane.
10. COUNTRY 0F THE BosIUANAs.-The Boshuanas appear to be of
the same race as the Caffres; but have made more progress in industry
and the arts. They dwell in towns of some magnitude; and cultivate
the ground, raising millet, beans, water-melons, &amp;c.
They have large iherds of cattle, the robbing of which fromn each
other is the cause of frequent wvars among the different tribes. Lattakoo, Mashow, and Kurreechane, are their chlief towns.

Scarcely any part of the world is so imperfectly known, as
the interior of this region, or opposes so many obstacles to
the investigations of the traveller.
2. The states of this territory are generally occupied by
dark brown or black nations, who, however, bear but little resemblance to negroes except in colour. In some of them, the
inhabitants are not entirely destitute of arts and industry.
3. The COUNTRY OF TIIE SOMAUI.ES extends from Abyssinia to Cape
Gardafhi. The people are an active industrious race, who trade with
the Arabs, Hlindoos, and the interior tribes. The country is hilly and
beautiful, and may be considered as the native region of incense, my rrh,
and sweet..smelling gums.
4. Berbora and Adel are the chief states on the coast, of which the
principal towns are Berbora and Zeyla; Hurrur, in the interior, is the
residence of the Sultan of the Somaulies., The inland country is scarcely
known, but appears to be occupied by thle savage Galla, and by the kingdom of Gingiro, whose inhabitants are equally barbarous.
5. XJArN, or AZANIA, stretching southward from Cape Gardufui, is
sandy, hilly, and, except in the northern parts, barren. The want of
harbours, and the fierce character of the inhabitants, have prevented it
from being much frequented by traders.
6. ZANGUEBAR extends from Cape Bassas to Cape Delgado. It containrs several states, of which Magadoxa, Mombas, and Quiloa, appear to
be the chief: the latter is under the control of the Arabs of Muscat.
The city of Melinda, once a handsome and important place, is now in
ruins, having been, with the whole of its territory, desolated by the
savage Galla.. The commerce of this region is carried on principally by the Arabs
of Muscat, who navigate vessels called dows, the planks of which, instead
of being fastened in the usual manner, are sewed together. The ports
of Mombas, Lamoo, and Brava, are sometimes visited by American ves.

is now little more than nominal. Mozambique, the residence of the
Governor General, Quilimane at the mouth of the Zambeze river, and
Sofala and Inhambane, are the chief stations on the coast; those in the
interior are Sena, Tcte, and Manica. The trade, now greatly reduced,
is chiefly in slaves, gold, and ivory.

CENTRAL AFRICA.
1. CENTRAL AFRICA     comprises all the interior of the
continent lying south of the Great Desert. Its northern division, Soudan, or Nigritia, has been partially explored by
Europeans; but the southern, called Ethiopia,. has never
been visited by white men, and is, consequently, unknown.
2. The principal river of this region, thle Niger, tcalled by the natives

Joliba, or Quorra) was long a subject of intense interest to the civilized
world, in conlsequence of the various opinions entertained concerning it.
Mr. Park, in 1795, determnined the upper part of its course; and the
lower part, and termination in the Gulf of Guinea, were ascertained by
the brothers Landers, in 1830. It was ascended, a few years since, by
two steanm-boats, for a distance of 400 miles.
3. Soudan is, in most parts, fertile and populous; and the
inhabitants generally excel those of the coast in industry and
intelligence. It contains a great number of states, various in
extent and character.
4. KAARTA, the mnost western state in Soudan, is a considerable kingdom, of moderate fertility; the capital of which is Kernmoo. Boua,
and WASSELA on the Niger, and KONG extending along the mountains
of thle same name, are all imrperfectly known. The first abounds in
gold. BEEaOO and MASSINA on the w estern, and BAmDOO on the east side
of the Niger, are countries with which the civilized world is acquainted
only by name. Walet, the capital of Beeroo, is reported to carry on a
great trade in salt.
5. BAsIBaaRRA was, until lately, the mnost important state in this quarter; but it is now divided into two distinct kingdoms. Lower Bmbarra, the last formed of the two, is the most powerfol state; and is
governed by a Foulah, or Fellata chief: Jenne, the capital, is one of
the most commercial towns in this part of Africa. Sego, the capital of
Upper or Old Bambarra, is enclosed by a wall. The houses are built
of clay, and whitewashed.
6. TIMBUCTOO is thle-centre of the trade for Western Soudan. It has
for a long time excited great attention, fiom its supposed riches; and
is the point at which most European travellers have aimed to arrive.
M. Caillie, who visited it in 1828, has dispelled, in a measure, the
reputation it enjoyed fo.r wealth and importance.
7. The FELLATAS are the most powerful nation in the interior of
Africa. They are simrnilar to the Foulahs; but are more warlike. They
have conquered Houssa, the most civilized country in this quarter; also
several small states on the Niger. Soccatoo is their capital. Kano and
Cashna are important cities in Houssa. Zegzeg is a fine fertile district,
the capital of which is Zaria.
8. BoussA and YouaI are considerable towns on the Niger. The
formner is the capital of Borgoo, a confederacy of states on the same
river; and Youri is the place at which Mr. Park lost his life. NYFFE
and YARRImA are fertile and populous countries; the people of which
are the most improved and industrious of all the Negro nations. Eyeo,
the capital of Yarriba, is said to be 15 miles in circuit.

siderable trade is carried on across the Great Desert with Tripoli, in
slaves, ivory, and ostrich feathers. KANEM, lying north of Lake Tchad,
is a district dependent on Bornou; and furnishes to that country its
bravest and most effective soldiers. Bornou is the capital, and Angornou
is the largest town.
10. BEGIIARMI, lying south-east of Lake Tchad, is almost always at
war witht Bornou. The cavalry of both these nations cover themselves,
and even their horses, with iron armrour, and fight with long spears.
DARKULLA is inhabited by a fierce Pagan race, called El Fellati, who
fight with poisoped arrows.- MANDARA occupies a fine fertile valley containing several populous towns, of which Mora is the chief.

AFRICAN ISLANDS.
1. ON both sides of the African continent are to be found
a number of single islands and groups of islands, belonging
principally to different European powers; most of them are
populous, fertile, and productive in a variety of valuable
commodrties.
2. The AZORtES, or WESTERN ISLES, have a fine climate and fertile
soil, which produces abundantly grain, wine, and fruits of various
kinds. The chief towns are Porto Delgado, in St. Michae's, and Angra, in Terceira: the latter is the capital of the whole group.
3. MADEIRA is a beautiful, healthful, and fertile island, long celebrated for its excellent wines, the trade in which is less important than
formerly. Funchal is the capital.
The CANARY ISLANDS are noted for their wines, fruits, and Canary
birds. These islands contain numerous mountains, of which the most
celebrated is the Peak of Teneriffe. Santa Cruz, in the island of
T'eneriffe, is the capital. Orotava is the largest town.
4. The CAPE VERDE ISLANDs.. The climate of these islands is hot
and unhealthful, and the soil is mostly dry and arid. Many of the
inhabitants died of famine in 1831, from the effects of a long-continued
drought. Fogo, one of the islands, contains an active volcano. Salt,
goat-skins, and some cotton, are the chief articles of trade. The capital is Porto Praya.

5. ASCENSION ISLAND, now garrisoned by a small military force, was
long uninhabited and famous for its turtle. St. Helena is a small rocky
island: it has but one harbour and town (Jamestown), and is noted for
having been the residence of Napoleon Buonaparte for six years: he
died there in May, 1821.
6. The ETHIOPIAN ARCHIPELAGO, situated on the eastern
side of Africa, comprises Madagascar, the Mascarenha, Seychelle, Almirante, Comoro, and sonme other islands.
7. MADAGASCAR is the largest of the Afi'ican islands. It has a
healthful climtate, a fertile soil, and is said to be rich in minerals. The
inhabitants conrsist of Arabs, Malays, and Negroes. Some of these cultivate the ground, and are not destitute of arts: othlers are pirates, and
commit depredations on the neighbouring islands.
8. IMEaRNA, or the kingdom of the Ovahs, the most important state
in this island, was founded by Radama.'I'his prince received Christian
missionaries, and endeavoured to civilize his subjects by introducing
among them European arts and sciences. He was poisoned by his wife
in 1828. Since his death, the kingdom has been the scene of anarchy
and confusion. Tananarivou is the capital. Bombetok Bay, and the
other bays and ports, are somnetimes visited by American vessels.
9. Eastward from Madagascar are the MASCARENHA ISLANDS. These
are BCURBON, and MAURITIUS or the Isle of France: they are both wellsettled, fertile islands, and produce coffee and sugar to a great extent.
Bourbon contains a volcano constantly burning, which serves at night
as a light-house to mariners.
10. The SEYCHELLE and ALAIIRANTE ISLANDS are a dependency of
Mauritius: they produce cotton and cocoa-nuts. The COMORO ISLES are
mountainous but fertile. The inhabitants have been nearly all extirpated by the ravages of the Madagascar pirates; MONFIA, ZANZIBAR,
and PEMBA, are fertile, well-settled islands, and belong to Muscat. The
town of Zanzibar, on the island of the same name, contains about
10,000 inhabitants. SOCOTRA is subject to Keshin in Arabia, and is
chiefly noted for the superior quality of its aloes.

Inhabitants of Oceanica.
OCEANICA.
1. OcEANICA comprises the islands lying immediately
south of Asia, together with the greater part of those in the
Pacific Ocean, situated between Asia and America. They
form three great divisions: Malaysia, Australasia, and Polynesia.
2. This region extends from north to south abouLt 6200
miles, and from east to west 11,000 miles. It comrnprises
almost a third part of the superficies of the globe, and its
land area is about one-eleventh part of the land surface of
thlle earth.
3. The discovery of this quarter of the world commenced soon after
America was known to Europeans. Magellanr, the first navigator who
sailed round the globe, passed through the strait which bears his name,
nmore than 300 years ago, and crossed the Pacific Ocean in a direction
fromn south-east to north-west.  
4. After Magellan, the Spaniards, Dutch, and English, continued the
progress of discovery. Of the latter, Captain James Cook contributed
more to our knowledge of the islands in this quarter, than any other
Occanica. Q.-1. Describe Oceanica. 2. Its extent. 3. What is

individual. Since his time, numerous navigators and whalers, principally English, French, and Americans, have traversed the Pacific Ocean
in every direction, and have probably left but little to be explored.
5. The islands of Oceanica are situated principally withinthe tropics,
and are exposed to a considerable degree of heat. The temperature,
however, is various. Some of them enjoy a delightful climate, and are
among the most favoured and fertile countries on the globe.
6. Nearly'all the large islands are elevated. Some contain mountains
of great altitude. Volcanoes are numerous, and occasionally cause
dreadful ravages. The smaller islands are low, many of them scarcely
rising above the surface of the water, and are often destitute of vegetation and inhabitants: some again are covered with groves of cocoanut and other trees, and are well peopled.
7. Most of the animals found in these islands are similar to those of
the southl of Asia; but there are several varieties peculiar to this quarter. The orang-outang abounds in Borneo, and the Malay tapir in
Java and other islands. The kangaroo, emeu, duckbill, and black
swan, exist only in Australia. In Polynesia, a species of dog is fattened and eaten, being considered a great delicacy.
8. The natives of Oceanica are various in manners, customs, and
condition. They consist, for the most part, of two distinct races, the
Malays, or brown variety of the human family, and the Papuan, Oriental, or Melansian Negroes.
9. The Malays are found in different stages of civilization, and comprise two distinct classes, nobles and slaves. Some of them are comparatively improved; others are extremely barbarous, and in many instances they are cannibals. The people of Polynesia are principally
pagans; those of Malaysia are partly Mahommedans and partly pagans.
10. The Papuans constitute a variety of the black race. They are,
for the most part, smaller in person, and not so dark in complexion, as
the African negroes. They are generally destitute of clothing or dwellings, often live on the most disgustinrg food, and are supposed to have
no definite ideas of a Supreme Being.
210
MALAYSIA.
1. MALAYSIA derives its name from the Malays, the most
nutmerous people in this region.    It is also called the East
India Archipelago; and contains the islands of Sumatra,

with Celebes, the Moluccas, or Spice Islands, the Philippine,'and some smaller groups.
2 The climate of Malaysia is that of the torrid zone. The soil is
highly prolific, and yields in abunldance the most exquisite spices and
fruits. The clove, nutmeg, mnace, cinnamon, and pepper, abounld; also
sugar, coffee, cotton, rice, tobacco, and indigo.
3. The cornmmerce is extensive, and is carried' on mostly by Europeans and Chinese. The latter, in their uncouth vessels, called junks,
trade in great numbers to the different islands. Tripang, sea-slug,,and
edible birds'-nests, luxuries not in use among Europeans, form important articles of the traffic with China, where they bear a high price.
Malays capturing a Europeall Vessel.
4. The Malays, the prevalent race in this region, are, generally, of
a deep-yellow complexion. Tlhey are dhiefly Mahomedans. Many of
them are pirates; and the most daring attempts are often made by
them to capture vessels of superior force. A number of Chinese emigrants have settled in some of the islands of this region, and are noted
for their industrious and quiet habits.
5. SUMATRA, the most western of the Sunda Islands, is nearly equlal.
in extent to our Middle and Easterin States united. It is divided into
several petty native kingdums; and is partly under the dominion of
Holland. Some of the interior- tribes are cannibals. Among the Battas, the punishment of several crimes, by their laws, is to be eaten alive.
They also eat the prisoners they take in war.
6. JAVA is a finre fertile island, principally under the control of the
Dutch. The natives are well acquainlted with many arts. They carry
on a lucerative trade with the Chinese, and profess the HIindoo religion.

7. Batavia, the capital of Java, and of the Dutch possessions in this
quarter, is less important thanl formerly; but still carries on an extensive commer-ce. Cheribon, Samarang, and Sourabrya, are thle other
most imnportant towus. Eastw ard from Java are the Islands of Bally,
Sumbawa, Floris, and Tirnor. The last is hield jointly by the Dutch
and Portuguese.
8. BORNEO is one of the largest islands in the world. Its area is
rather less than that of the Southern States, includingo Florida. The
interior is occupied by a number of rude, ferocious tribes, betweenl
whom and the people of the coast there is constant war. Amon3g the
Dyaks, one of the inland tribes, an individual cannot obtain a wife, or
aspire to the distinction of mianhood, until -le can show the head of; at
least, one enemry, as a proof of his prowess. Gold and diamonds are
found in considerable quantities. The principal trade is at Benjarmassin.
9. Immediately eastward of Borneo are the Sooloo Islands. The
inhabitants, all pirates, are the Algerines of the eastern seas. Celebes
is a large fertile island. The inhabitants, called Macassars, and.Bugis,
are madly devoted to gaines of chance. T'he women mingle freely in
all the affairs of life; and are even sometimes elevated to high political
stations.
10 The SPicE ISLANDS, or MoLuccAs, produce the precious spices,
cloves, nutmnegs, and mace. Gilolo, Ceram, Bouro, Banda, and Arnboyna, are the principal islands. Nassau, a small town onl the island of
Neira, is the residence of the Dutch governor.
11. THE PEILIPPiNE ISLANDS form an extensive group of two large
and a numrber of small islands. They are very rich in natural resources, and furnish many valuable articles of commnerce.   They
belong to Spain; but the inhabitants are chiefly of the native races,
Tagalas, Bisayas, &amp;c. Among some of these are several small independent states. Manilla, the capital of all the Spanish colonies in the
east, is a large and flourishing city. It is the centre of an extensive
commerce, and its harbour is thronged with European, American, and
Chinese vessels.

AUSTRALASIA.
1. A-JSTRALASTA    comprises a number of islands lying
south-eastward from   Malaysia: of these, Australia or New
H-olland, New Guinea, and New Zealand, are the most extensive.  The inhabitants belong chiefly to the black race called
Papuan Negroes, and are among the most degraded of the
human family.
2. AUSTRALIA, formerly called New Holland, is the largest island in
the world. It is claimed by the British government, who have laid it
off into two great divisions: the western is called New Holland, and the
eastern New South Wales. The Blue Mountains are the highest range,
arid the Murray the largest river, yet discovered.
3. The aborigines of
Australia are very rude
and degraded: those in

some are merely a large pieceof bark folded and tied up at each end,
and some only a log on which they sit andt guide with their hands.
4. In the south-east part of Australia is the BOTANY BAY COLONY,
founded in 1787: to this place many thousands of criminals have been
banished from Great Britain. The bulk of the population is, however,
forrmed of fred settlers: to these, the convicts, as they arrive from Britain,
are apportioned as labourers during the period for which they were
sentenced.
5. The Colony extends along the coast about three hundred miles: it
is divided into a number of counties, and contains several towns: Sydney, thle capital, has a good harbour, with considerable commerce.
The country is in general better adapted for grazing than tillage,
sheep are abundant, and their wool forms a large part of the exports:
wheat, Indian-corn, and potatoes, are the principal crops raised in New
Soutth Wales.
6. On the west side of Australia is the SWAN RIVEa COLONY:
several towns have been laid out, but no great improvement hlas yet

AT tio former period, has the science of Geography been considered of
more importance, as a branch of elementary educationt, than at the present
time; and its value and utility are so obvious as to require butlittle illustratlon. Perhaps no study is belter calculated to awaken and cherish that spirit
of curiosity and inlquiry whlich is so natural to the youthfil mind; and none,
under proper regulation and tuition, affords a better prospect of leading to
tisefi and importaint results.
Within the last twelve or fifieen years, the great attention paid to geography in our principal schools and seminaries, has been the means of prdducing
several mneritorious works on this sLbject. They have each their respective
peculiarities and excellencies; and are generally well calculated to aid the
scholar in his progress towards acquiring a considerable knowledge of that
interesting science. They ought not, however, to be regarded as superseding
all fiurthier endeavours in this departmenet of usefulness, or as discouraging
any well inten~ded effbrts of others to do good in a similar way.
Geography is, more than san  olier science, in its nature constantly progressive; and hiene, deiuands unceasing diligence on the part of those whose
attentioa is dire(ted to the publication of works connected with it. A considerable deficiency, in this respect, is observable in some of the most popular
school geagraphies now ii use in this country.
Several fil in representicng various parts of the world, according to their
actual subdivisions at the present day. Even the divisions of our own country are not accurately laid down; and, in the exhibition of the South American
States, there is a general deficiency.  Australia, or New HIolland, though
divided by the British government, a number of years ago, into two great
sections, is neither described isor represented in that way in any school geography extant.
Important misstatements have been also observed in some of the works
alluded to, which have doubtless escaped the observationl of their authors;
and, though they do not essentially detract from the mnerits of their respective
works, must still be regarded as mnaterial blemishes. In one work, (edition
of 1838,) it is asserted, that the western part of the State of Tennessee is inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians-that wild horses and buffloees abound in
Arklansas-tthat the greatest part of the State of&gt;Alabama is inhabited by the
Choctaw, Cherokee, and Creek Indians; and that the interior of Newfoundland is inhabited by the Red Indians. All these statements were true, a numher of years ago; but are not so at the present day.
The Mississippi Valley, or the couiirltry extending from fhe Rocliy to tha
Allegheny Mounrtains, is described, in the same wvork, as being more than
3,000 miles wide. Yet the whole continent, fiom ocean to ocean, measured
across the centre of the valley inr question, is only 2,600 miles in extent.
The Boa Constrictor is enuLmerated as one of the animals found in Africa.
It is stated, that the largest are about 80 feet long; and besides deer, dogs,
and bullocklis, even horses with their riders are said to be destroyed by this
enormous serpent; hboth expiring together in the same fatal fold of the monster! This is a m'ere popular fallacy, unsupported by any authenItic testimony;
and certainly ought inot to be inserted in A WORK ON ELEMiENTARY EDUC,ATiON.
In another work, the population of the Ionian Islands is stated to be 800,000;
while, in fact, it is less than one-Iburth of that amounrt. Another seihool geography describes the island of Teneriffe as one of the Cape Verd islands;
wthile, in tfact, it is one of the Canaries. Nor are thie atlases less erroneous

1. The Earth is a vast globe or spherical body similar to a
solid ball. Its entire surface is about 200 millions of square

land, and the remaining three-fourths are covered with water.

all sides by the sea.and skly. More attentive observers were, however,
long ago persuaded that it is a globe or sphere, similar in form to a

than the descriptive geography h as been shown to be. The m aps of South
America, in two of them, represent the river Amazon as flowi ng from Lake
Titicaca: this is a positive error; it being well know-n that the h ead waters
of the Amazon river are entirely separated from the lake above-mentioned,
by ranges of the h ighest mountains in South America.
The population of the cities and towns, in several maps, is assumed, in some
cases, as double, andt in others, only one-half the amount stated by the most
authentic writers: some places, of which we know nothing certain, and others
whose very existence is problematical, are exhibited as containing a definite
number of inhabitants.
A very great disproportion is likewise observed in the lengths of the courses
given to many of the rivers; -some stated as 500 or 600 miles long, are represented as absolutely shorter than others of 300 or 400 miles in their immediate proximity.
The above-mentioned errprs and misstatements, although among th e most
prominent that have been detected, fbrm but a tithe of what really exist in
the very popular works in which they have been found.
In this exposition, the author trusts he is not actuated by an invidious or
malignant spirit; for, while he exhibits fieely the incorrectness of some works,
he willingly bears testinony to the general accuracy and excellence of otllers.
He believes that he has gone far to establishl his position, that a want of attention is observable in the compilation of some of the most popular school
geographies extant, and that improvements may still be made in works of this
kind. Hie does not by any m eans expect to escape errors himself; but hopes,
by a close attention to the revision of his work, as it comes from the press, to
avoid any so far removed from the truth as those above stated.
Essential errors or misstatements, in works on elementary education, can
hardly be compensated by any excellencies they may possess; and, when it
is considered that the ideas impressed on the mind of youth, in the study an(l
perusal of these works, will undoubtedly, in numerous instances, be retained
in after-life, the importance of accurate statements becomes apparent.
The introduction of a great variety of books into schools, in the same departinent of knowledge, by rendlering the information uncertain, the expense
greater, and the progress less rapid, is an evil of which many have complained.
T'o obviate this, the author has resolved to give his work a periodical revision, commencing with the next census of the United States; which will be
repeated, and continued regularly once in five years thereafter, for the purpose of embodying all the facts that the most recent discoveries or political
changes may develope, and all well-settled improvements in teaching.
The present forni of the work will be preserved as nearly as possible'; so
that its improvement shall afford no impediment to the progress of the pupil.
The author has endeavonsred, as far as the limits prescribed for his work
would permit, to describe the various political divisions of the earth, according
to the views exhibited in the latest and most authentic works on the subject.
The maps, comprising the atlas, are all from original drawings, and are
especially adapted to the work. They are carefully engraved, in a neat and
distinct manner. Those illustrating Palestine and Liberia are not usually
found in atlases of this kind; and, from the interesting associations connected
with the countries they repiesent, will, no doubt, be found useful. The mniap
of Oceanica is compiled with direct reference to the important religious and
moral changes which have taken place in the principal islands of that interesting region within the last twenty years. This map has not been introduced
into any school atlas extant in accordance with those remarkable circumstances.
The pictorial illustrations are chiefly from original drawings, and are engraved by the best artists in the country. Many of these embrace a numnber~78         DESCRIPTIVE      GEOGiAPHY.

most striking proofs is that furnished by an eclipse of the:
mnoon, which takes place in consequence of the earth coming
between the sun and the moon,j and causing the circular
shadow of the earth to be thrownYon the latter body.
4. If the carth, instead of being round in all directions, was/merely
a ci~5ular flat body like the top of a round table, the shadowthrown
fiom it on the moon would at one time or other present the appearance
of an dv'al, of a straight line, or some other figure different from that
which it has always been found to assume.  
5. Sailing round the world is,another proof of its globular:,form.  It is well known that navigators, by leaving any seaport, Philadelphia for instance, and sailing as nearly east or
west from it as the form  of the different continents will permit, may go round the world anld return to the place they left
in a direction opposite to that from which they started.
6. To sail round the world is called circunhfiavigating it, and was
first accomplished by MAellan, a Portugfi&amp;ese navigator, more than
three hundred years ago. It was for a long time considered a great
undertaking, but it has been-of late years so often performed, that it isnot now thought to be an efierprise of any importance.

7. When a ship comes from sea towards the land, we first
get sight of the tops of the masts and rigging; as she,advances nearer, the lower parts are seen; and at last the hull, or
body'of the vessel, comes distinctly into.view.  If the earth
7waa not sphdi/ical, the hull would be the first part seen.
8. A person sailing to the southern parts of the earth, perceives that
thle sun appears:more and nmore to come directly over him at npon, which
at length actually happens; and,fter he has passed the Equator, the
sun begins to appear to the northward, and will go farther and farther
in that direction as he advances south.
9. New stars will also come into view in the southern horizon, while
those in the northerr, parts will gradually disappear. These circumstances could not possi'bly happen if the earth were a flat body, ~vhereas
every direction? 4. If the earth was a circular flat body what appearance would its shadow present? 5. What is another proof of its:globular form?  How must navigators sail to go round the world?

for a long time considered? 7. What do we first get sight of when a

on the supposition that it is spherical, they all appear simple and probable.
10. The inhabitants ot the earth amount to about eight hundred millions, and if they were equally distributed, every
square mile of land would contain 16 human beings.
11. On an average, a generation of men is supposed to exist about
33 years. Some individuals live more than twice, and a very few three
times that period; but the estimate is that 800 millions of human beings
are-born and die every 33 years; being at the rate of almost 25 millions a year, 66,000 every day, 2700 every hour, and 45 every minute.
12. T'he creation of the world, according to the book of
Genesis, took place near 6,000 years ago, so that supposing
the average duration of life to have been always the same,
about 175 generations of men would have existed since that
time.
13. In the early ages of the earth, however, the duration of life was
greater than at present; therefore, it is probable that a smaller number
of generations of mrnen must have existed than according to the above
calculations.

1. AMERICA is an extensive continent, comprising one of
the grand divisions of the globe.  It contains about threetenths of the dry land on the surface of the earth, and is
washed on all sides by vast oceans.
2. Its climate is various, embracing that of every Zone;
the torrid, the temperate on both sides of the equator, and
part of the frigidcl. It is said to be colder, generally, than in
places in the same latitude in other parts of the world.
3. This continent is distinguished for the variety and
richness of its vegetable productions, the number of its mines
of gold, silver, and precious stohes, and for the freedom of
its political institutions.
4. The inhabitants are supposed to amounlt to about 45
millions, of whom 19 millions are white, 10 millions of Indians, 8 millions of negroes, and 8 millions of the mixed
races.
5. The whites are chiefly English in the North, and Spaniards in
America. Q.-- 1. What does America contain?  2. What is said

thle South, with some Frenchl, Portuguese, Germans, Dutchl, &amp;c. The
negroes are Africans and their descendants,who werec purchased as
slaves irl their native country and brought hithier from time to time.
6. The aboriginal population consists of two distinct races; the
Esquimaux* inhabiting the shlores and Islands of tile Arctic regions,
and the copper-coloured Indians whlo are spread over the rest of the
conltinent.
7. America is frequently called the Western continent,
from its extent, and also the Newv World from its recent discovery.   It was unknown to the rest of mankind until the
year 1492.    It was at that time discovered by Ci--istopher
Columbus, a native of Genoa, in Italy, who was' the mnost
sklilful navigator of his age.
S. The great object whlichl engaged the attention of the maritime
nations of Europe, at that period, was a passage by sea to the East
Indies.
9. The spherical figure of the earth, which Columbus understood,
made him conceive tlhe idea that the eastern parts of the world stretchled
so far towards Europe, that they miight be reachled in a moderate space
of time by sailing westward.
10. The project of Columrnbus was generally regarded as so visionary,
that it was only after many years of ardent solicitation, thlat Ferdinand
and Isabella, King and Queen of Spain, were at last induced to patronize
his enterprise.

11. He was furnished by tliem withl three small vessels and ninety
men, and left Palos, a port on the southl of Spain, August 3d, 1492.
On the 12th of October following, he discovered Guanahlani Island,
which he namned St. Salvador.
12. He visited at that time several of the adjacent Islands, aand returned to Spain, where hle was received witl the greatest honours. He
made three other successfutl voyages of discovery, but was, notwithstanding, treated with gross injustice by tlhose who were envious of the
fame he had acquired.

13. The discovery of Columbus excited a spirit of enterprise unknown
and unfelt at any time before, and drew numerous adventurers from
all parts of Europe.
14. In 1497, John Cabot, and his son Sebastian, natives of Venice,
in the service of Henry VII. of England, discovered North America,
and explored the coast from Newfoundland to Florida.
15. In 1499, Americus Vespucius, a native, of Florence, visited South
America. On his return to Europe, he published the first account of
the New World, of whichl he claimed the original discovery, and thereby
gave lhis name to the Western Continent. This however does not lessen
the glory whiich crowns the discovery of Columbus, and which will descend with his memory to the, most distant ages.
16. It was at first supposed that America was a part of the Eastern
Continent; thle Islands first discovered received therefore the name of
the West Indies, and the inhabitants that of Indians, which was afterwards extended to the natives of the whole country.
17. Muchl controversy has taken place on the origin of the inhabitants
of thle New World: they were found in various stages of society, from
the lowest savage state to that of a half-civilized people. The conclu,
sion is, that they emigrated from the Eastern Continent, and that they
reaclhed America fromrn the nearest points of North-Western Europe and
North-Eastern Asia, but at what period is entirely unknown.
18. Several years elapsed before America was klinown to be a separate continent; at length Balbao, a Spanishl adventurer, ascended the
mlountains in the isthmus of Darien,-and first saw the Pacific Ocean.
19. The Western Continent is generally described under
two grand divisions, viz: North America, and South America;
these are joined together by the isthmus of Darien. There
is also a great collection of islands lying between the two
continents, usually called the West Indies; but by some it is
also termed the Columbian Archipelago.

1. NORTH AIERICA comprises the northern division of the
lVestern Continent.  It extends from the Arctic Ocean to the
Isthmus of Darien, a distance of 4800 miles in length, and
from 3200 to 2600 in breadth.
2. The Rivers, Lakes, Plains, and Mountains, of this
continent, are all on a grand scale, and are among the most
remarkable in the world.
3. The Mississippi and Missouri far surpasses, in length ofcourse,
the principal rivers of the eastern continent; and Lake Sutiperior is the
largest body of fresh water known. It forms, with the great lakes
with whichl- it is connected, a vast interior sea, affording a continuous
navigation many hundreds of miles in extent.
4. The precious and useful metals and minerals, exist in
North America in great abundance. Gold, silver, copper, and
tin, are found in Mexico; and gold, iron, lead, and coal, in the
North Amnerica. Q.- 1. What is North America?  What is its

5. Among the animals of North America, there are several species
not found in any other part of the world. The grizzly and barren ground
bears are peculiar; also the moose or elk, the wapiti, antd the caribou or
rein-deer. The buffalo, musk-ox, and rocky mountain sheep and goat.
all differ firomi animrals of tihe same kind found elsewhere.
Buffalo.                  Rocky Mountain Sheep.
6. Various species of birds abound; of the rapacious kind, there are
eagles, vultures, hawks, falcons, &amp;c. The bald-headed eagle is well
known as being the chosen emblem of our own republic. The wild
turkey is a native of this continent, and was introduced into Europe
about 30 years after the discovery of America.

all confined to this continent; while grouse, pheasants, &amp;c., of different
kinds. are found in variouis parts, and are highly esteemed for food.
Alligator.                      Rattle Snake.
S. The alligator exists only in the southern section of the continent,
being seldom seen north of Louisiana and the Carolinas. The rattlesnake is peculiar to the New World; it is formidable for the deadly
venom of its bite, and comprises five or six different varieties.
9. The Indians and Esquimaux conistitute the original inhabitants
of the country. The Indians are usually tall, straight, and erect in
form, of a dark copper-colour, with high cheek-bones and long coarse
black hair; while the Esquimaux are short and stout in person, and of
a dirty reddish yellow complexion. The latter are lively and cheerful
in disposition, and appear to be more social and domestic in their habits
than savages usually are.
10. North America is politically divided into the Republics of the
United States, Texas, Mexico, and Guatimala; these occupy the continent south and west of the great lakes, while the northern parts comprise the colonial territories of Great Britain and Russia.
OBSERVATIONS ON              THE- QUESTIONS.
In bounding any country or state, let the learner tell what is on the
north, what on the south, on the east, and on the west.
To the first question on the following page-How is Russian America
bounded? the answer will be, on the north by the Polar Sea, south by the
Pacific Ocean, east by British America, and west by Bhlering's Strait.
In telling of Gulfs, Bays, or Sounds, say what countries they are in,
or are surrounded by, and what Oceans they are connected with, thus:
Baffin's Bay is bounded east by Greenland, west by Prince William's
Land, and leads into the Atlantic Ocean.

the country?  What is said of the Indians?  Of the Esquimaux?
10. How is North America politically divided?NORTH AMERICA.
87
Tell what countries, or divisions, Straits separate, and what Oceans,
Bays, &amp;c. they connect: thus, Bhering's Strait separates America friom
Asia, and connects the Pacific and the Arctic Oceans.
Tell where Lakes are situated, and with what Rivers they are connected: thus, Lakes Superior, Huron, Erie, and Ontario, are between
Canada and the United States, and flow into the St. Lawrence River.
Tell where Peninsulas are situated, to what countries they belong,
and what waters surround them: thus, Nova Scotia is in the soulthern
part of British America; it has the Bay of Fundy and the Gulf of St.
Lawrence on the north, and thle Atlantic Ocean on the south.
Tell where Islands are situated, and their direction from the nearest
Continent or other Islands: thus, Cuba is in the West Indies; it is south
of the United State., ast of Mexico, and north of Jamaica.
Tell wbc'ev Mountains are situated, how they extend, what countries
they separate, and what their length is: thus, the Rocky Mountains are
in the western part of North America; they extend through Russian
America, British America, the United States, and Mexico; they separate in part the United States and British America, and are 4,000 miles
in length.
Tell where Rivers rise, in what direction they flow, and where they
empty: thus, the Mississippi River rises west of Lake Superior; it flows
southward through the United States, and empties into the Gulf of
Mexico.
USE OF THE SCALES.
By means of the Scales of Miles, which are attached to nearly all tlhe
Maps, the learner may measure. thelength and breadth of Continents,
Seas, Gulfs, &amp;c. Thus, for example, take with a pair of compasses, or
the edge of a slip of paper, the length of the Scale of Miles of Map
No. 3, and measure with it from. Smith's Sound to the southern extremity of North America; it will be found to extend nearly.five times
the length of the scale, or about 4,800 miles. On north latitude 40 degrees, the breadth of the Continent is 2,600 miles; on latitude 52 degrees,
3,000 miles, and from Nova Scotia to Porto Rico 1,800. These exercises
will give variety to the studies, and impress on the mind of the pupil
the length and breadth of countries and their distances from each other,
&amp;c., in a more decided mnanner than by any other method.
By studying the Explanation on the Maps, the learner will understand how the Capitals of Countries, the population of the cities and
towns, and the lengths of the rivers, are represented.

of leading objects in nature and art, and othes elucidate important fhcts
stated in the body of the work. A few, it will be perceived, are o'f a national
character: these illustrate some of the most important incidents in the history
of our country, and will associate, in the mind of the pupil, in a striking anid
impressive manner, with the characteristic features of the states to which
they are attached.
Teachers xvill observe that the work throughout is divided into short
sections, such as are considered sufficient fbr one lesson, whichi aremarkedfor
the purpose of saving the teacher the trouble of designating thlem. They
are gradually enlarged during the progress of the work, so as to correspond
with the increased capacity of the pupil.
Those who may conceive a single section insuflicienrt for a lesson, may
give two or more at once. The plan has been adopted at the suggestion of
several experienced teachers, and wili rio doubt be found usefill.
Nearly all the maps belonging to the atlas have scales of miles attached to
them, by the aid of which, with a pair of compasses, or the edge of a slip
of paper, the learner may measure the length and breadth of countries,
islands, seas, gulfs, &amp;c. This will give variety to the exercises, and impress
on the mind of the pupil in a more decided maimner than by any other method,
many valuable particulars that, if inserted in the geography, would increase
its dimensions mLuch beyond its prescribed limits.
Considerable care has been bestowed on the construction and execution
of the Atlas. The geographical features of the mrnaps have been obtained
iiom the latest authorities, and those who are critically acquainted with
modern rnaps, will perceive manynew items of information elucidating important facts not to be ifunrd in any other school geography extant.
The engraving has been executed by the best artists in that line in the
country, xvho have used every endeavour to render the lettering clear, distinct, and easily u.nderstood, a matter of some mooment to the pupil, who is
frequentlfy much perplexed in ascertaining the names of places, when inserted
among the dark and obscure shading so common in lthe maps of many school
geographies.
The chlaracters designating the location of some of the most important
events connected with the history of our country, are new in works of this
kind; arid with the annexed dates, will render the maps useful to those pupils studyin, the hlistory of the Uriited States.
The disfances fiom the countries on one continent to those on others, in
the saine parallels of latitude, are interesting as pointing out the width of the
oceans, seas, &amp;c., that separate the cliief divisions of the earth.
The population of cities and towns, the length of rivers, the heights and
extent of mountains, &amp;c., are all derived from the most authentic sources;
and the plan adopted to illustrate these various particulars, is probably as
simple and easily understood as can well be devised.
The authlor has omitted to mention the number of the counties into which
the several states, &amp;c., are divided, or asking the learner that question; as the
number, particularly in the Southern and Western States, is continually increasing. In a very popular school geography, (edition of 1838,) the counties
in Mississippi are stated as amounting to 26, Alabamia 36, Georgia 76, and Arkansas 30; while in the Map of the Southern States accompanying this work,
the numbers are respectively 56, 48. 90, and 35,-thus making an increase
of 61 counties in Ibur states only.88

It is a cold, dreary, and almost unknown region, inhabited
chiefly by Indians and Esquimaux.
2. The Russians have established a number of trading factories
along the coast, the principal of which is New Archangel. Here they
barter fire-arms, beads, tobacco, and other articles, for the furs obtained by the natives in hunting.
Subterraneous Mansion of the Aleutian Islanders.
3. The Aleutian* or Fox Islands extend to a great distance westward from the Peninsula of Alaska: they are inhabited by a race of
savages who live in houses under ground, which contain each from 50
to 150 inhabitants, and are divided into numerous apartments, which,
though dark and dirty, protect their inmates effectually from the weather.

duration.  The whole region is claimed by- Denmark, which
has formned some small settlements along the western coast.
2. Several of these are also Moravian missionary stations, where the
inhabitants have been in some measure converted from their ignorance
and superstition, and partly enlightened by the doctrines of Christianity
3. In the Northern part of Greenland, Captain Ross discovered a
district which he named the Arctic Highlands. The inhabitants, who
had never before seen an European, were seized with the utmost astonishment, especially at the ships, which they at first imagined to be
huge birds with wings.
4. The cliffs on the coast present the remarkable phenomenon of red
snow, the nature and origin of which has excited much controversy
among the learned in Europe.

BRITISH    AMERICA.
1. BRITISH AMaERICA comprises the whole of the American
continent lying north of the United States, with the exception
of the extreme north-western portion, which is claimed by
Russia.  It is a region of vast extent, being equal in area to
the whole of the former country., 2. Its divisions are New Britain, Upper Canada, Lower
Canada, New     Brunswick, Prince Edward's Island, Nova
Scotia, and Cape Breton, together with the Island of Newfoundland.. About one-tenth part only of these territories is
as yet settled by a civilized population.
3. The climate of British America is very severe, much
exceeding what is felt under the same latitude in the Old Continent.  Even the southern sections are covered with ice and
snow for five or six months in the year; and in the northern
parts of the country the winter is almost perpetual.

this territory and the United Stales, are on a greater scale than in any
other part of the world. These form a vast inland sea of fresh water,
which is navigable for vessels of the largest burthen, and is traversed
by a nlumber of steam-boats, ships, &amp;c., in almost every direction.
The White or Great Polar Bear.            Musk Ox.
5. The White Bear, Musk Ox, Caribou or American Rein-Deer, and
other animals, abound in all the northern parts of this region, and supply the inhabitants with the chief part of thleir clothing and food, besides
furnishling the skins whlich are bartered with the traders of the Hudson's'
Bay Company for the various manufactured articles which have become
essential to the comfort and even existence of the ITdians.
6. Each province of British America has a governor and council,
appointed by the Sovereign of Great Britain, and a h-ouse of Commons
or Representatives chosen by the people. The whole territory, however,
is under the control of a Governor General, who resides at QuLebec.
7. Canada was originally settled by the French, but fell into the
hands of the English in consequence of the victory gained near Quebec,
in 1759, by General Wolfe.
S. Since that period the trade and population of these provinces have
greatly increased, and they have likewise enjoyed a considerable degree
of prosperity, but owing to various unpopular acts of government, much
discontent has been of late evinced by the people, especially in Canada..Map No. 3.--What bounds British America on the North? P.-Sa.

NEW BRITAIN.
1. New Britain comprises that part of British America
situated north of the Canadlas and the United States. It contains more than tlhree-fourthis of thle whole of the British possessions, and is divided by Hudson's Bay into two unequal
portions.
2. The only trade in this region is that offurs, to facilitate
which, the Hu[dson's Bay Company hlave established forts and
trading-houses in various quarters, extending from Hudson's
Bay westward, to the shores of the Pacific, and to the northward almost to the Arctic Ocean. The whole region is in
consequence often called the Hudson's Bay Company T'lerritory.
Beaver                          Raccoon.
3. The Beaver, Raccoon, Muskrat, and other animals, are eagerly
hunted for their furs; the exports ofwhichhaveamounted in some years
to upwards of a million of dollars fromn the port of Quebec alone.
4. The coast of Labrador, and the whlole of the northern shores of
this region, firom Greenland westward to Bhering's Strait, is inhabited
by the Esquimaux, a race of savages differing essentially from the
Indians, in fornm, disposition, and complexion.
5. Among these people on the coast of Labrador, the Moravian
Missionaries have established the settlements of Nain, Okkak, Hopedale,
&amp;c., and have partially improved their habits and condition.

UPPER CANADA.
1. UPPER CANADA extends along the whole chain of the
great lakes almost to the western extremity of Lake Superior. The climate is generally healthy and salubrious. The
summer heats are more moderate, and the winters shorter and
less rigorous than in the Lower Provinces.
2. The soil in the settled parts of the couLntry is mostly very
fertile, and yields abundant crops of grain, wheat, Indian
corn, flax, &amp;c. Tobacco is also cultivated in the south-western
districts.
3. The most important canals in British America are in
Upper Canada; these are the Rideau and the Welland canals;
the first extends from the Utawas river to Kingston. The
Welland canal unites Lake Erie with Lake Ontario; both these
works allow vessels of 125 tons bturthen to pass through.
4. In this province, on the Niagara river, which connects Lake Erie
with Lake Ontario, is the Falls of Niagara, 165 feet high. This is one
of the m1ost magnificent of Nature's works. The noise of the cataract
is heard, and the cloud of vapour which rises fromn it is seen, at the
distance of several mniles.
5. Toronto and Kingston, on the northern slhore of Lake Ontario, are
the two principal towns of Upper Canada. Toronto, the capital, is
pleasantly situated on a bay of the samre name; it is regularly laid out,
and has a number of handsonme buildings.

LOWER CANADA.
1. LoWER CANADA extends on both sides of the St. Lawrence river, from its mouth to the river Utawas.  The lower
part of the province is rugged, cold and sterile; but the upper
portion is fertile, well watered, and more moderate in temperature. All sections have, however, the climate of Sweden,
though in the latitude of France.
2. More than three-fourths of the inhabitants are of French
origin; they speak the Frenchl language, and are all CathoLower Canada. Q.-1. How far does Lower Canada extend? 2. Hcw

lies. The remjainder are mostly natives of Great Britain and
their descendants, who are principally Protestants.
3. Education is much neglected,
and the chief part of the people are
very ignorant. The native French
Canadians are called habitans. They
are gay in their dispositior s, courteous and polite in their manners,
and strongly attached to their religion and native country.
4. Lower Canada produces wheat,

NEW BRUNSWICK.
1. NEw B    urNswv-ci is situated to the east of the State.of
Maine, and to the north-west of Nova Scotia. Until the year
1784 it was included within the limits of the latter, which at
that period was dcivided into two separate provinces.
2. This colony is but partially cleared, and contains extensive forests which furnish large quantities of e.xcellent timber.
The soil is generally of good quality, especially along the
banks of the St. John's and other rivers.
3. T'hle fisheries are a source of considerablc weaith, and emnploy
many of the inhabitants, the produce being with lutmber the chief articles of export. Slhip-building is an important branchl of industry, and
is carried on to a considerable extent.
4. The Bay of Fundy, which separates this province from Nova
Scotia, is remarkable for the great and rapid rise of its tides, whichl often
attain the height of 70 feet.
5. Frederickton, the seat of government, is situated some distancee up
the river St. Johln's. It is rather regularly built, chiefly of wood, and
contains the government offices, several churches, and a college.
6. The town of St. John's is the most considerable place in NewN
Brunswick, anid has an extensive commerce. St. Andrew's, at the head
of Passamaquoddy Bay, is the next town to St. Jolin's in trade and
population.
