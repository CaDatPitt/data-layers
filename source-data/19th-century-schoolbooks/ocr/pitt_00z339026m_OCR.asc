8 THE WESTERN GONTINENT.

the United States contains 2,983,153 square miles,--“more
than one third of the surface of North America.

i America is bounded on each side by a great ocean. On
the east, the Atlantic, 3,000 miles broad,‘separates it from
Europe and Africa; on the West, it is separated from Asia
by the Paciﬁc, the greatest width of which is about 10,000
miles. This ocean gradually narrows towards the north, till
it terminates in Behring’s [pronounced beer’-dngz] Strait,
where the extreme points of the two continents are only 36
miles apart. =

2. The American Continent is distinguished for the grand»
ness of its natural features. It is intersected by’ large rivers,
which afford every facility for commerce. The Mississippi,

the Missouri, and the Amazon, surpass in length every other

river on the earth. Lakes equal in size to seas are scattered
over. its surface. Its valleys and plains, its volcanoes and
mountain ranges, are all on the grandest scale. Its mineral
resources are inexhaustible. The silver and diamond mines
sf South America, and, in the United States, the -gold placers
of California, and the vast subterranean treasures of lead, iron,
and coal, which elsewhere abound, are of inestimable value.
’3. The temperature of any given locality in America is

much colder than that of a place in the same latitude on the

Eastern Continent. New York is on nearly the same par»

allel as Naples; yet in the latter snow is rarely seen, and
ﬁres are. hardly ever required. There is no city in America
as far north as Paris; and Stockholm, transported to the
same latitude in the Weste1*n Continent, would be in a re.«

gion of perpetual snow. , - _
4. The animals originally found in America were, as_ a
general thing, neither so large nor so strong as those of the

old world. Instead of the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopota-

globe do they comprise? How much of this belongs to the United States? By what
is America bounded? How wide is the Atlantic? the Paciﬁc? In what does the
Paciﬁc terminate towards the north? How wide is Behring’s Strait? 2. For what is
the American Continent distinguished? By what is it intersected? What is said of
its valleys, plains, &c.? What, of its mineral resources? 3. How does the .Western
Continent compare in temperature with the Eastern? What two cities are mentioned
in illustration of this fact?. What is the temperature of America in the latitude of

sant conquered New Sweden, since called Delaware. Dur-—
ing his absence, sixty-four canoes full of Indians appeared
before New Amsterdam, and did considerable damage. His
return restored peace._ The colony from time to time re-
ceived large additions, many victims of persecution in differ-
ent parts of Europe seeking it as a home.

147. An earnest desire for greater freedom had for some
years shown itself in the people ; but Stuyvesant, accus-
tomed to strict military discipline, would make no conces-
sions. The principles of liberty continued to spread; and
at last a general assembly of deputies from the Dutch vil-
lages was held for the purpose of asserting the rights of the
people. Little was then gained, but the spirit displayed was
not to be mistaken.

148. The English had long coveted the ﬂourishing settle-»
ment on Manhattan Island; and in 1664, Charles II., who
cared little for the rights of others, granted the whole tract
from the Connecticut to the Delaware to his brother James,
Duke of York, afterwards James II. A powerful ﬂeet was
fitted out to take possession of the Dutch settlements. Stuy-
vesant, however, was too old a soldier to be frightened; and
had he been supported by the people, he would have made a
brave and perhaps successful defence. But the colonists re-
membered how their recent appeals had been met; and,
thinking they would enjoy greater freedom and happiness
under English rule, they turned a deaf ear to Stuyvesant’s
stirring appeals, and refused to fight. Thus left without
means of resistance, the brave old governor had to surrender,
and all the possessions of the Dutch passed without blood=»
shed into the hands of the English (1664). The inhabitants
were not disturbed, and even Stuyvesant himself passed the
rest of his days under the sway of the conquerors. The

the» duke to whom it had been granted. The valley of the
Hudson quietly submitted; and Fort Orange was named
Albany, to commemorate the duke’s Scottish title. All the

_Atlantic coast, from Maine to Georgia inclusive, was now in

possession of the English.

149. The region between the Hudson and the Delaware
was made over by the Duke of York to Berkeley, who had
been governor of the Isle of Jersey, and gave the name of
NEW JERSEY to the tract thus received. With the view of
attracting settlers, freedom of worship was guarantied, and
the right of taxation was conﬁned to a colonial Assembly.
In consequence of these advantages, New Jersey became
rapidly peopled.

CHAPTER XI.
VIRGINIA FROM 1620 TO 1660.

150. SLAVERY commenced in the new world with Spanish
discoveries and conquests. In 1495, Columbus sent 500 In-
dians to Spain, where they were publicly sold.‘ In 1501,
negro slavery was recognized by law in the Spanish colonies,-
and introduced on a large scale into the West Indies, where
the natives were rapidly perishing under the tasks imposed
by their conquerors. Sir John Hawkins, an English adven-
turer, engaged in the trafﬁc, and Queen Elizabeth shared in
the proﬁts. Negro slaves were first brought to Virginia in
a Dutch man-of-war. They were soon after introduced into
all the other colonies. The price of a negro in New Am»
sterdam ranged between $125 and $150.

100 VIRGINIA FROM 1620 TO 1660. [1622

151. In 1622, the white population of Virginia amounted
to about 4,000. English settlements had been planted on both
sides of the J ames-River for nearly 150 miles, and all fear
of the Indians was laid aside. Powhatan was dead, and his
younger brother Opechancanough [op-e-com’-ca-no] had suc-
ceeded to his power. The new chief was far from sharing
his brother’s friendly feelings towards the whites ; and, jeal-

ous of their increasing strength, he planned a general rising I

among the Red Men. The various settlements were at-
tacked at the same time, and 847 of the colonists were mas-
sacred within a single hour. The rest were saved by the
warning of a friendly native.

War followed. The Indians were driven back from the
river, and killed in great numbers. Yet the colony suifered
much from, the unexpected blow. Sickness set in ; many of
the settlers returned to Europe ; and in 1624 there were only
1,800 souls in the colony" of Virginia.

152. Meanwhile, King James, offended by some plain=
spoken members of the London company, sent over commiso
sioners, who tried to frighten the colonists into surrendering
their charter. In this they did not succeed; whereupon,
with. the aid of corrupt judges, the king dissolved the com-
pany.

153. In 1625, James I. was succeeded by his son Charles I.
This king conﬁrmed the privileges already granted, and rec»
ognized the authority of the Assembly, in the hope that they
would consign to him all the tobacco raised in the colony
and thus give him a monopoly of the article. But the As-
sembly, while it was glad to have its rights conﬁrmed, de-
clined the king’s proposals. Various salutary laws were
passed about this time. Profanity and drunkenness were
prohibited; military exercises were required ; emigration
without the governor’s permission was forbidden; and a cer-

tain part of the soil was set apart for the cultivation of corn.
The Puritans were invited from the _less.genial-climate of the
North, and some accepted the invitation.

154. Sir William Berkeley became governor in 1641,‘ and
the colony continued to ﬂourish. During the struggle be-
tween the Parliament and Charles I., which resulted in the"
execution of the latter, Virginia adhered to the king, and,
to show its loyalty, banished those who would not use the
liturgy of the English Church.

In 1644, another Indian war ravaged the frontier. At last
Cpechancanough, the untiring enemy of the colonists, was
made prisoner, and the power of the Powhatans was de=
stroyed. The old chief died from a wound cruelly inﬂicted
after his capture. The Indians obtained peace only by the
surrender of large tracts of land.

155. The Parliament and Cromwell, everywhere triumph-
ant, sent over a strong force to Virginia in 1652, to establish
their authority. The colonists agreed to recognize it on
condition of not being disturbed. Still they sympathized
with the royal party, and, on the restoration of Charles II.
to his father’s throne, gladly acknowledged him as their king.
Gratitude, however, had no place in the nature of Charles;
and, when he was ﬁrmly seated on the throne, he rewarded
his faithful subjects in Virginia by encroaching on their
rights and giving his proﬂigate favorites large tracts of their
choicest land.

Assembly? How did the Assembly meet his advances? What laws were passed about
this time? What invitation was given and accepted? 154. Who became governor in
1641? What side did Virginia take in the struggle between Charles I. and his Parliae

CHAPTER XII.

ELIOT’S PREAC‘HING.—-UNION OF THE NEW ENGLAND
COLONIES.

156. A DESIRE to convert the Indians to Christianity at-1
tracted many good men to America during the seventeenth
century. Among those Who engaged most zealously in the
Work Was John Eliot. He Was born in England in 1604,
and, emigrating to Massachusetts at the age of twenty-seven,
became Warmly interested in the natives. After some efforts
to enlighten them, he collected as many as he could at Na’-
tick [see Map, p. 84], and there established an Indian school.
Becoming acquainted With their language, he Wrote an Al-
gonquin grammar and translated the Scripture-s into that

tongue. This translation was printed at Cambridge in 1663,

and Was the ﬁrst Bible ever published in America.

When he spoke to the Red Men of God, he found that
they already believed in a Supreme Being; his other cloc-
trines they Were not so ready to receive. They asked a
thousand perplexing questions; but, though his teachings
Were not always understood or believed, yet his simplicity
and kindness Won their hearts. In the children he found his
most attentive listeners. One Indian youth, We are told,
having seen the ceremony of baptism performed by the mis-
sionary, persuaded his parents to unite With the church, and
then joined it himself, declaring that he Was ready to die.
Shortly after he was attacked by consumption, and died the
death of a Christian.

Money Was raised in England, to aid Eliot in his benevo-
lent scheme. He Was of service to the Indians in various
Ways, not only instructing them in their religious duties, but
teaching the men to dig and the Women to spin. His heart

in this Work? Give some account of his early efforts. When and where Was the ﬁrst
Bible. printed in America? In What language? [See Map, p. 84.—Whe1‘e is Natick?
In what direction from Boston ?] How did the Indians receive Eliot’s teachings? Who
were his most attentive listeners? What story is told of an Indian boy? What besides

overﬂowed with kindness; he would never see his fellow-
creatures suﬂer when he had the means. of relieving them.
On one occasion carrying home part of his salary, tied up in
his handkerchieﬂ he called by the way on a destitute family.
Moved by their distress, he tried to untie his handkerchief,
that he might give them some money; but the knot resisted
his eﬁ”o1'ts,and he handed the whole to the mother of the
family, saying, “ Take it., for I believe the Lord designs it all
for you”.

Eliot wrote several books,'in one of which he expressed
sentiments so liberal that he was censured by the Boston
court and required to take them back. He died at a good
old age, loved by all Who knew him.

Others besides Eliot took up the good work, and many of
the Indians learned to read and write. One of their num-
ber even took a college degree. But these advances to-
Wards civilization were conﬁned to the tribes on the eastern
coast of Massachusetts. The Narragansetts, as well as the
more distant nations, refused all instruction and proudly ad-
hered to the faith. of their fathers.

157. Charles 1., whose tyrannical conduct was at last the
cause of his dethronement and execution, strove to oppress
the New England colonies equally with the Puritans at
home. In 1634, he empowered a commission, consisting of
Archbishop Land and others, to revoke charters, inflict pen-
alties, and establish a new government in the American
plantations. This news soon reached Boston, and with it
the rumor that a governor appointed by the crown was
on his way to Massachusetts. A council was called, and
it was resolved that the colony should resist as far as it
was able. In 1635, the Plymouth company surrendered

their patents to the king; and soon afterwards the Massa-=

religious truths did Eliot teach the Indians? Wliat instance of his generosity is related?
Wliat kind of sentiments did Eliot express in one of his works? Under Eliot and his
companions, what did many of the Indians learn to do ? To whom were these advances
conﬁned? How was it with the Narragansetts? 157. How did Charles I. treat the
New England Puritans? Wliat power did he give to Laud? Wliat rumor soon
reached Boston? On what course did the colonists determine? In 1685, what did the
Plymouth company do? What soon after happened to the Massachusetts Bay com-

104 UN1oN on THE NEW ENGLAND OOLONIES. [1633

chusetts Bay company was deprived of its privileges by pro-
cess of law. a

The entire‘ control of both the Massachusetts colonies thus
rested with the crown ; and measures were promptly taken
to suppress freedom of thought and action. Puritans were
forbidden to emigrate to America; and it is said that thus
the king, unfortunately for himself, prevented Cromwell,
Hampden, and other friends of liberty from leaving Eng-
land. The colonists would no doubt have been cruelly per-
secuted, had not diﬁiculties soon arisen at home which en-
grossed the king’s attention.

158. The New England colonies, having the same origin,
views, and interests, began about this time to feel the neces-

sity of union. In 1643, they were threatened by the Indians

on one side, and the Dutch and French on the other; and
accordingly Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and

,New Haven, formed a league oﬂensive and defensive, under

the ‘name of “the United Colonies of New England”. At
this time, they contained a population of about 20,000, scat-
tered through 50 villages.

Each colony retained the control of its own territory; but
questions of war and peace, and all matters of common in-
terest, were decided by a council of two commissioners from
each. In case of war, the colonies were to furnish men and
money in proportion to their population. This confederacy
was the germ of the American Union. -It was of great ad-
vantage to the colonies, and lasted more than forty years,
till the New England charters were revoked by James II.

159. The people of Massachusetts had early provided for
the education of the young. A sum of money was appro-
priated by the General Court for the establishment of a school
at Cambridge; and the Rev. John Harvard having left it
nearly $4,000 and his library, it was made a university and
called by his name. Such was the origin of Harvard Uni-

pany? What measures were now taken by the king? What prevented him from
cruelly persecuting the colonists? 158..What did the New England colonies begin to
feel necessary? When was the union effected, and what led to it? What was the
population of New England at this time? ‘What were the terms of the union? 0?

a school-house and hire a teacher.

CHAPTER XIII.

DOMESTIC LIFE, CHARACTER, AND LAWS OF THE PURITANS.

160. LET us glance at the state of society among the Pu-
ritans. Their condition, of course, was like that of the Eng-
lish people at this time. Many improvements connected
with domestic life were_ yet unknown, while others had just
been introduced. The use of chimneys was becoming com-»
mon, though opposed by some, who said that smoke im-
proved their health and hardened the timbers of their
houses. Wooden dishes and spoons were giving way to
pewter ones.. Houses of brick and stone were not unfre-v
quent in ‘the old country; but in America boards and un-
hewn logs were mostly used in building. A poor man in
England received but half what he now gets for a day’s la-
bor. Rye, barley, and cats, were the common food; and
thousands of families hardly knew the taste of meat. The
condition of the people in Massachusetts was considerably
better than this. After the first few years of scarcity, ordi-»
nary industry supplied their wants; and they lived more
comfortably and independently than the same class in the
old world."

161. The Puritans of New England had naturally imbibed
a strong aversion to the manners and practices of those who
had persecuted them. They were opposed to veils, wigs,
and long hair, condemned silken hoods and scarfs, required
women to restrict the size of their sleeves, and discounte-
nanced all frivolous fashions in dress. They disliked the

Averse to form, the Quakers believed that God communi-
cated directly with the spirits of men, moving them accord-
ing to His will. They would neither bear arms nor take an
oath; they condemned pleasures, forms, and show 3? they de-
nounced tyranny and abhorred titles. Anxious to propa-
gate their doctrines and ready to seal their opinions with
their blood, they had turned their eyes to America as a
promising ﬁeld for effort. '

164. In 1656, two Quakeresses arrived at Boston. They
were immediately arrested, and after an imprisonment of
five weeks expelled from the colony. Laws were passed,
forbidding under heavy penalties the introducing or harbor-
ing of Quakers in Massachusetts. If one of “the accursed
sect” Was found within the colony, he was to lose an ear ; if
he returned, the other ear was forfeited; and for a third
offence his tongue "was to be pierced with a red-hot iron.

But the persecuted Quakers gloried in bearing witness to
their faith. The severer the laws against them, the more
they were attracted to Boston. Fines, whippings, and tor-
tures could not keep them away: and ﬁnally the authorities
declared that all Quakers found a second time in the colony
should be punished with death. Three men and one woman
suffered on the scaffold under this law, declaring that they
died for conscience’ sake. Such horror, however, was ex-
cited by these executions, that the cruel law was repealed.
After this, Quakers were whipped out of the colony, and the
excitement gradually died away.

165. It seems strange in this more liberalage that the
Puritans should so soon have forgotten their own sufferings
and displayed the same persecuting spirit from which they

and ofa still larger quadruped known as the mastodon, now

Europe. Horses are now found wild in great numbers, but »

America is not their native land. They havesprung from

with the wild cattle that traverse in myriads the plains of
Buenos Ayres [bw&’-nos 73’7'es]. Our varieties of native birds
are numerous; we have many not found in“ the Eastern
Continent, of which the turkey is the most important.

we proceed-to treat of its history. The part now constitu-

108 KING rHIL1P’s WAR. [1660

existed in every 6 Christian country. In Spain, multitudes
had perished at the stake and on the rack. Under Charles
V., 50,000 persons had been burned, hanged, buried alive,
or beheaded, in the Netherlands. Even in England, num-
bers had suffered under Bloody Mary and some of her suc-
cessors. The Puritans were only carrying out the same in-
tolerant prinoiples. To Roger Williains and his Providence
Plantations, to Lord Baltimore and his happy colony on the
Chesapeake, belongs the honor of first rising superior to the
bigotry of their age.

CHAPTER XIV.

KING PHILIP’S WAR.

166. UNLIKE the Virginians, the Puritans of New Eng»
land, during the long struggle between Charles I. and his
Parliament,‘ sided against the king; and when the latter was
dethroned and Cromwell assumed the government, they were
treated with great liberality and favor. The population in»
creased; commerce extended; the ﬁsheries ﬂourished; and
ship-building and other trades were pursued with proﬁt.

167. In 1658, Cromwell died; and, his son having abdi-4
eated, Charles II. was restored to the throne of England
in 1660. The ﬁrst vessel that left for the colonies after this
event brought over Whalley [w/’wZ’—Ze] and Groﬁe [gof], two
of the regicide judges who had condemned Charles I., now
compelled to ﬂy from the vengeance of his son. They were
well received in Boston by Gov. Endicott. The next year,
an order came for their arrest; but the authorities allowed
them to escape to Connecticut. E

bigotry of their age?

England Puritans take? What was their condition during Cromwe1l’s administration ?
167. What took place in 1660? Soon after, who arrived at Boston? How were they
treated? How did the colonists attempt to make their peace with the king? With

1662] CAUSES or HOSTILITY. 109

the colonists were obliged to acknowledge his authority.
Commissioners were sent to England by the people of Mas-
sachusetts to make their peace with the king for having sided
against his father, and to procure from him a conﬁrmation of
their charter. The king complied with their wishes so far
as to conﬁrm the charter, and grant pardon for past oifences;
but- in turn required the Puritans to take an oath of alle»
giance, to tolerate the Church of England, and to extend the
right of voting to those who were not church members. To
these demands the colonists returned an evasive answer ; and
four commissioners were sent over by the king, whose report
might have led him to punish by force of arms the indepen
dent spirit of New England, had not '.he great plague and
the ﬁre of London called off his attention. At this time
New England contained 120 villages and about 60,000 in-
habitants.

168. Scarcely had these troubles ended, when the New
England colonies became involved in a long and bloody In-
dian war. It is known as Ifing P/zilz'p’s l7Vcw°, and broke
out in 1675. The faithful Massassoit had died some years
before, leaving two sons, Alexander and Philip. Alexander
succeeded his father, but shortly afterwards died of a fever
brought on by mortiﬁcation at being arrested and impris-2
oned by the English.’ His death left Philip chief of the Wam-
panoags, who now numbered about 700 warriors.

The English settlements having extended on all sides, the
Wampanoag's at last found themselves conﬁned to two small
peninsulas. They had sold a great part of their land, and
could no longer enjoy the forest freedom which was neces-
sary to their happiness. They now began’ to understand the
meaning of those mysterious marks which they had made
from time to time on deeds conveying their possessions away
forever. The white men were daily increasing in number,
and the natives became alarmed lest they should be driven

out even from the little that remained to them of the land

. of their fathers.

Several unfortunate occurrences increased the suspicion
and hostility of the‘ natives. In 1674, a chief who had been
required for some offence to give up his arms, was again
summoned to Boston for examination. Instead of obeying
the order, he, With some others, killed the informer; and
the murderers, having been arrested and found guilty, were
publicly hanged. The Indians immediately revenged them-
selves by attacking Swanzey, a settlement near Mount Hope,
and killing eight or nine of the inhabitants.

169. Philip wept when he heard that the war had begun,
nor was he ever afterwards seen to smile. He felt that it

niust result in the destruction of his tribe. The English far
outnumbered the Red Men, and were Well provided with

arms, ammunition, and the necessaries of life. The Indians,
though they had learned the use of ﬁre-arms, were poorly
supplied with them, and lacked the discipline and conﬁdence

of their enemies. Yet Philip resolved to do all that could

be done by a great warrior. He would at least leave his

enemies a victory which they would have cause to mourn.
Withiri a week after the attack on Swanzey, a body of

troops from Boston reached the vicinity. The Indians were

obliged to retreat. Their route was traced by’ burning

houses, and poles ﬁxed in the earth bearing the scalps and
heads of their unfortunate victims. Great consternation
prevailed; but volunteers continued to take the ﬁeld, and
the Wampanoags were soon driven’ from Mount Hope [see

.Map, p. 84].

170. Philip was now a fugitive, but he was more terrible
than ever. Moving rapidly among the neighboring tribes,
he exhorted them, with burning eloquence, to join the com-
mon cause of their race. His appeals were successful. From

suddenly as he had appeared, and for some time the people
attributed their deliverance to an angel. It Was afterwards
found that this mysterious personage was no other than Groffe,
the regicide, Who had been a general in C1'omWell’s army.
Seeing the danger of his countrymen from his place of con-
cealment, he had come forth for their rescue.

determined to invade the country of the Narragansetts. A

thousand men were raised. Josiah Winslow was placed at
their head; and in December, 1675, the expedition was com-
menced. The ground was covered with snow, through which
the invaders painfully forced their way. They found the en-
emy strongly intrenched in a swamp and defended by pal-
isades. As they approached, a destructive ﬁre was opened
by the savages; but the place of those who fell was ﬁlled by
others, and after a severe struggle of two hours the fort was
taken. The victors ﬁred the cabins of the Indians, and de-
stroyed their winter stores. Many old men, women, and
children, perished in the ﬂames. A thousand warriors fell,
the settlers showing as little mercy as they had received.
The power of the Narragansetts was thus utterly broken.
The few survivors wandered through the cedar-swamps, with
no shelter but the evergreens and no food save the ground-
nuts which they dug from under the snow. Still the proud
chief Ca-non’-chet declared, “ We will ﬁght to the last man”.
The following April (1676), he was taken captive; but his
spirit was still unsubdued. When interrogated by a young
man, he refused to answer “ a child”, but said he would talk
with a chief. On being told that death awaited him, he ex-
claimed, “ I like it well! I shall die before I speak any thing
unworthy of myself.”  
172. In February, 1676, Philip assailed Lancaster. Forty-
two persons took refuge in the house of Mary Rowlandson,
who describes that day as the “ dolefulest” she ever saw.
Some were ﬁghting for their lives, others weltering in blood,
the house on ﬁre, and the savages ready to massacre those
whom the ﬂames drove forth from its shelter. Attempting
to escape, Mrs. Rowlandson received a bullet in her side, and
her child was wounded in her arms. Grro’-ton, Medﬁeld,
Weymouth, and Marlborough [ma7'Z’-bur-0], were burned.

were unfortunate enough to be taken, were cruelly tortured.

The Indians, says the quaint Cotton Math’-er, deliberately
roasted their prisoners out of the world. .

Philip allowed himself no rest. He was everywhere pres-
ent, yet seen by no one. Whe1'eve1' an unprotected village
invited attack, wherever a well-planned ambuscade could cut
off an inexperienced enemy, there at the right moment was
the watchful chief. It became necessary to trace him to his
secret hiding-places. Captain Turner started in his pursuit,
and came upon him at the Falls of the Connecticut. A night
attack was made, and most of the Indian braves were killed
on the spot or driven down the cataract. I

173. The New Hampshire tribes having abandoned the
war, Philip now found his forces reduced to a feeble rem-
nant. Driven from place to place, they often suffered the
greatest extremities for food. On one occasion, 300 of his
men had to go many miles to the coast, to sustain life on the
clams it afforded. Still the brave chief kept the ﬁeld. He
even struck dead one of his followers for proposing peace.

In June, 1676, a strong force, raised with the view of ex-
terminating the savage foe, was placed under command of
the celebrated Captain Church. In the ‘course of the sum-
mer, he killed and captured many of the dispersed Wampa-
noags. Among others, the wife and child of Philip were
taken. “My heart breaks”, cried the chieftain; “now I
am ready to die I” The child alluded to was a boy of nine
years, the last of the family of Massassoit. Forgetting all
they owed his grandfather, the Puritans sold him as a slave
in Bermuda.

174. The condition of Philip was now indeed hopeless.
Deserted, betrayed, hunted down, he could hope for relief
only in death. With his few remaining followers he took
refuge in a swamp, in the broad hunting-grounds which had

belonged to his fathers. Here, while trying to obtain rest,
he was disturbed by gloomy dreams. Impressed with a
foreboding of evil, he bade his men save themselves and

leave" him to his fate. It was time. Capt. Church was
upon him. An Englishman aimed at the chief, but his mus-

ket missed ﬁre, and a friendly Indian in the company seized
the moment to shoot Philip through the heart. Chu.rch’s
army raised three cheers, and treated the fallen king with
savage indignity. His body was quartered. The head was
cut off and carried to Plymouth, whence it was borne round
the colony in triumph. The Indian who killed him received
one of his hands as a reward. _

Thus ended King Philip’s war, to the great joy of the
colonists. It had cost the lives of some of their best men,
and destroyed a vast amount of property, including six hun-
dred houses. It had obliged the colonists to contract a
heavy debt ; but this, with honest pride, they determined to
discharge Without aid from the mother country,

CHAPTER XV.

BACON’S REBELLION.

175. THOUGH the Virginians loved liberty, they still re-
tained some of the old forms and customs of the English
aristocracy. The eldest son inherited the whole of his fa-
ther’s estate; and, as the inﬂuence and wealth of the land-
owners increased, the dividing line between the higher and
lower classes became more distinct. The Virginians were
mostly royalists, and but few republicans were elected to
the new legislature formed a.fter the restoration of Charles II.

The loyal colonists, however, were not treated with the
favor which they had a right to expect from the home gov-

chief and his few followers ﬁnally take refuge? Describe Philip’s death scene. How
was his body treated? What did King Philip’s war cost the colonists? What resolu-
tion did they form respecting the debt they had contracted?

ernment. Parliament soon ordered that the imports and
exports of the colonies should be carried in English vessels
alone, and that their chief productions should be shipped
only to the mother country. A proﬁtable trade which had
sprung up with the West Indies was thus entirely out off.
The measures of their own legislature were hardly less
offensive than those of Parliament. The right of voting was

restricted to householders. The forms of the English Church ,

were enforced on all, and a ﬁne of £20 was laid on those who
absented themselves from public worship. A special law was
passed against Quakers; and Baptists were denounced as
“ﬁlled with new-fangled conceits of their V‘ own heretical in-
vention”. The members of this legislature had been elected
for two years; but they continued in session without regard
to the expiration of their term, and ﬁxed their own salary at
250 pounds of tobacco a day. No public improvements were
attempted. Neither roads nor bridges were constructed.
Governor Berkeley, whom the long possession of power had
made a tyrant, expressed the common sentiment of this roy-
alist legislature, when he said, “ I thank God that there are
no free schools nor printing, and I hope that we shall not
have them these hundred years”.

176. With such a government the people were justly dis-
satisﬁed, and, to add to their troubles, in 1675 an Indian War
broke out. The Susquehannas, driven from their abodes by
the Senecas, had fallen back on the Potomac and commenced
pdepredations in Maryland. John Washington, great-grand-
father of the ﬁrst president of the United States, hastened to

the aid of the settlers. The India.ns sent to propose peace;

but their ambassadors, in violation of law and . justice, were
put to death. The savages retaliated by devastating the
frontier from the Potomac to the James, and murdering
without mercy all who fell in their power.

The people solicited Gov. Berkeley to take measures for the

protection of their lives and property; but he paid no atten-
tion to their requests, and the work of death Went on un-
checked. In 167 6, Nathaniel Bacon, who had but recently
arrived from England, was urged by the people to lead them
against the enemy. The governor would not commission
him; but Bacon, moved by the solicitations of his friends,
declared that if he heard of another murder he would take
the ﬁeld with no commission but his sword. He was shortly
afterwards informed that several men had been killed on his
own plantation. The brave young leader no longer hes-
itated. At the head of 57 men, he defeated the Indians,
and then turned to meet the tyrannical Berkeley, who was
already marching against him. So strongly, however, did
the people express their disapprobation of the .governor’s
cour_se, that he concluded to abandon it. Concessions were
made by Bacon, and he was reinstated in his former position.
The old legislature was dissolved, and a new one of totally
diﬁerent principles was elected. A
177. Peace was thus restored,but only for a short time.
Bacon and his adherents were still resolved on obtaining the
commission which Berkeley had promised but seemed deter-
mined to withhold. At last the republican leader appeared
before Jamestown with nearly 500 followers, and obtained
the governor’s signature by force. But no sooner had he
marched with his little army against the Indians, than Berke-
ley, dissolving the legislature, again raised his standard, and
proclaimed Bacon a rebel. This proceeding gave general

‘ offence. Bacon returned and appealed to the Viginians to

overthrow a tyrannical government. The people rose in a
body to support their leader, and Berkeley was compelled to
ﬂee beyond the Chesapeake.

During the temporary absence of Bacon on an expedition
against the Indians, Berkeley once more got possession of

it from again falling into his hands, Bacon, before retiring,
burned it to the ground. Several of the patriots applied the
torch to their own dwellings. A new state—house and the
oldest church in the Dominion were consumed by the ﬂames.

as the leader- of the popular party. Berkeley was restored,
and with his return began all series of ﬁnes, conﬁscations,
and executions. All that had sided with “the rebels” were
cruelly persecuted. Hansford, the ﬁrst partisan leader that
was taken, was condemned to death. The vindictive gover-
nor refused his request to be shot like a soldier; and he was
hanged—the first white native of America that perished by
the gibbet. “ Take notice,” said he on coming to the gale
lows, “I die a loyal subject and a lover of my country”.
Drummond, another republican, was soon after taken. “ You
are very welcome,” said Berkeley on beholding him; “ I am
more glad to see you than any man in Virginia. You shall
be hanged in half an hour.” Twenty-two persons were exe-
cuted before the vengeance of the implacable governor was
satiated. The Assembly at last begged him to abstain from
further bloodshed, and he reluctantly yielded to their re-
quest.

Berkeley soon after returned to England, where his con-
duct was severely censured. “ The old fool,” said the king,
“has taken away more lives in that naked country, than I
for the murder of myfather.”

179. The avaricious Culpepper succeeded as governor in
1680. He enriched himself by taxing and impoverishing the
colony. The king after a time recalled him, and, annulling
the unjust grants he had himself made to unworthy favorites,

declared Virginia once more a royal province.

SETTLEMENT or CAROLINA.

of Charles IX., of France, but was ﬁrst successfully colonized

forcl? How, Drummond? How many were executed? Who at last interfered? What

180. From whom was Carolina so called? Under whose auspices was it first settled

under the auspices of Charles II. of England. In 1663, this
monarch, in deﬁance of former charters and the counter
claims of France and Spain, bestowed the territory in ques-
tion on Edward Clar’-en-don, Lord Al’—be—marle, the Earl of
Shaftesbury [3/ac/fts’-667'-Ty], and others.

Clarendon and his associates contemplated founding a

lgreat empire. Shaftesbury was appointed to draw up a

constitution. He called to his aid the philosopher Locke,
who constructed a “ Grand Model”, Which gave almost un-
limited power to a body of nobles and entirely overlooked"
the rights of the people. This constitution was signed in
1670. There was then neither church, court-house, nor
printing-press, in Carolina. But it was the land of peace
and plenty, and its great natural advantages had already
attracted settlers. Some had ﬁxed their abodes near Albe-
marle Sound. Others had purchased a tract on the Cape
Fear River, and established a ﬂourishing trade in staves and
shingles. The intermediate country was mostly a wilderness.

Such was the condition of Carolina, when Locke’s “ Grand
Model” of a constitution arrived. Nothing could have been
less adapted ‘to the people. There Was no room for a grand
series of lords among men who dressed in deer-skins and
homespun. The hardy people of Carolina, “ the freest of the
free”, had learned to govern themselves, and every effort to
enforce the new constitution utterly failed.

181. The same year in which this instrument was signed,
a company of emigrants sailed for Carolina under V\7illiam
Sayle [sale], and landed near the mouth of the Ashley River.
Though they established a republican government and rep-
resentative Assembly, they tried to carry out Locl<e’s absurd
constitution, but found it impossible. As they were at some
distance from the Albemarle and Cape Fear settlements, they
thought it best to form an entirely distinct government; and

On whom did Charles II. bestow the territory in question? What did Clarendon and
his associates contemplate? Who was appointed to draw up a constitution? Whom
did he summon to his aid‘? What was the instrument thus constructed called? What
was its character? When was it signed? What was the state of things in Carolina at
this time? W-here had settlements been made? What was the result of the efforts

hence the division into NORTH and SOUTH CAROLINA. The
Indians, inﬂuenced by the Spaniards of Florida, displayed
an unfriendly disposition ; and the new colonists, when gath-
ering oysters on the coast, or engaged in other work, carried
guns for their protection.

In 167 2, a few graziers erected their cabins on the spot
where Charleston now stands [see Map, p. 151], and eight
years later the town was formally founded. The surround-
ing country was a paradise. The river’s banks were lined
with stately. pines, up which the yellow jasmine climbed,
loading the air with the perfume of its ﬂowers. Immigrants
arrived from the northern colonies as well as England, and
among the rest ﬁfty. families sent over by Charles II. to in-
troduce the culture of grapes, almonds, olives, and the silk»
worm. The attempt failed, but a valuable addition in the
form of thrifty and industrious laborers was thus made to
the colony. The population was further increased in 1685
by the arrival of many Hu’-gue-nots, or French Protestants,
driven from their country by persecution, among the descend-

ants of whom were some of the bravest heroes of the Rev-=«

olution. ,

182. The same fondness for selilgovernment that prevailed
in North Carolina was also rife in the Southern colony; and
Governor Col’;-le-ton, sent over by the proprietors with en~
larged powers to awe the people into submission, was met
with open resistance. The Assembly boldly asserted its
rights, deﬁed the governor, and imprisoned his secretary.
In vain he called out the militia; the people triumphed.
When the news of the revolution which placed William and
Mary on the throne of England was received, Colleton was
banished from the province. Similar measures were taken

CHAPTER XVII.

SETTLEMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA.

188. CRUELLY persecuted in New England and the mother
country, a number of Quakers in 1675 took refuge in New
Jersey. Witliin a year, one of the proprietors sold out his
interest to several persons, among whom was Wiﬂiam Penn.
Longing to provide a happy home for the people of his
creed, Penn resolved to try his “holy experiment” on a
larger scale. In 1681, he obtained from Charles II. an ex-
tensive tract west of the Delaware, in payment of a claim
against the government for £16,000, left him ' by his father.
The king himself gave it the name of Pennsylvania, “the
woody land of Penn”.

184. This eminent man was a son of Admiral Penn, who
had won distinction by his conquest of Jamaica “and brilliant
achievements during the war With Holland. He was born
in 1644, and at the age of sixteen was expelled from Oxford
University for embracing the doctrines of the Quakers. In-
censed at his expulsion, his father beat him. and turned him
out of ‘doors, but afterwards sent him to travel on the conti-
nent, in the hope that his opinions would be changed by
intercourse with the world. On his return to England, he
commenced the study of law; but, on again listening. to a
Quaker preacher, he became so ﬁrm a convert that all his
father’s reproaches, and even a second expulsion from home,
could not turn him from his faith.

The young Quaker was several times imprisoned for plead-

king that “ the Tower (the building in which he was con-
ﬁned) Was to him the Worst argument in the World”. On

one occasion, a jury Was starved two days and nights, to,

force them to convict him, but insisted on returning a ver-

dict of acquittal, for which they were ﬁned. At last,’ Weary

of persecution, Penn, with several others of his persuasion,
embarked for Holland, that they might extend their doc—
trines on the continent. On this mission, Penn made the
tour of Germany, preaching in palace a11d cottage. Return»
ing to England and ﬁnding all other eiforts in behalf of his
oppressed breth1‘en useless, he became interested in the new
world in the Way that We have seen.

185. Withiri the domain granted to Penn a number or
Swedes and Dutch had alreadysettled. These he had no
desire to remove; and, soon after obtaining the grant, he
sent over a copy of it with a message to_ the residents that
he Wished not to usurp their rights, but intended that they
should still be governed by laws of their own making.
Three vessels full of emigrants soon after set sail, with in-
structions for building a city. Each house Was to have a
large garden attached, so that it might be °~‘ a greene coun=
try town”.

In 1682,»Penn himself sailed for the new World with a

‘hundred settlers. He had a long and melancholy voyage

of nine Weeks, during which thirty of his companions died

T of small-pox. He was Warmly Welcomed on his arrival, and,

sailing up the Delaware, soon reached a place fringed With
pine trees, Where he determined to locate his city. The pre-
cise spot was fixed in February, 1683. The ground vvas

which, it was hoped, would prevail among the inhabitants.

arrange themselves behind in a similar form. The new gov-
ernor, whose friendly messages and letters have inspired
them with conﬁdence, comes in the central space before
them, distinguished from his companions only by the blue
sash around his waist. “ We meet,” he says, “ on the broad
pathway of truth and good will. No advantage shall be

their children too severely; nor brothers only, for brothers

differ. The friendship between me and you I will not com-‘

The Indians trusted his words, and received his presents,
giving him in return a belt of Wampum, the emblem of
friendship. “We will live,” said they, “ with Wilhain Penn
and his children in love so long as the moon and the sun
shall endure.” This treaty was never broken. The Red
Men handed down the words of Penn from generation to
generation; and, while other white settlements suffered se-
verely from Indian Wars, not a single Quaker is known to
havenbeen molested by the natives. Penn often visited their
Wigwams, and took part in their sports and exercises.

187. The only diﬁiculty that disturbed the peace of Penn-
sylvania was the settlement of the line that separated it from
Maryland. Penn and Baltimore could not agree :.n a boun-
dary. The quarrel was carried to England, and there set-
tled by a grant of half the land between Chesapeake Bay
and the Delaware to Penn. The present boundary was
ﬁxed by two surveyors, Mason and Dixon, in 1761, and is
often referred to as Mason and Dixon’s line. The territory
now called Delaware was thus at ﬁrst included in Pennsyl-
vania,'und'er the name of “the three ‘lower counties”; but
afterwards, in consequence of the dissatisfaction of the peo-
ple, it was made a separate colony. P

188. The government established by Penn was strictly re-
publican. An Assembly was formed of six members from
each county, who held ofﬁce for a year. All sects were tol-
erated. Every freeman who believed in God and abstained
from labor on the Lord’s day, could vote and hold oﬁice.
Parents were required to bring up their children to some
useful trade. The only crime punishable with death was
murder. ‘

Emigrants arrived in great numbers from Holland, Ger-
many, and Great Britain». The peaceful colony grew and
prospered. In August, 1688, Philadelphia consisted of three

the surveyor had “blazed out” the courses of the streets.
In 1685, it contained 600 houses. It grew more in three
years than New York did in half a century. ‘

In 1684, Penn left his colony, now ﬁrmly established and
containing a population of 7,000, for the mother country.
During his absence difficulties arose. The Assembly en-
croached on his rights; and the rents, which were his only
remuneration for the expense of planting the colony, were
appropriated in part to the public service. After trying for
a time to enforce his authority, Penn yielded to the Assem-
bly, reserving to himself only the right of veto.

189. With the fall of '.I ames II., who both as Duke of
York and as king had been a firm friend to Penn, ended the
favor which the pure and peaceful Quaker had enjoyed. He
was charged With abandoning his principles and favoring the
cause of the deposed king. His proprietary rights in Penn-
sylvania were taken from him ; and, while the colony which
owed every thing to his wisdo.m and integrity was growing
in power and importance, he closed his life in obscurity and
gloom. He died encumbered with debt in 1718; at which
time, the population of Philadelphia amounted to about
10,000.

they had once lived far off in the northwest, and had united
with the Iroquois in driving out the mound-builders from the
valley of the Mississippi. In the fertile region thus acquired
they lived for a time in peace ; till their hunters, having as-
cended the mountains on the east, announced that great

streams ﬂowed down from them into a vast salt lake beyond,

watering a pleasant and unoccupied land. "On this,_part of
the Lenapees migrated" eastward‘, and took possession of the

I region traversed by the Susquehanna, the Delaware, and the
Potomac. Those who remained in the west became known’

at a later day as Illinois. a
Shortly before their interview with Penn, the Delawares
had been defeated by their former allies, the Iroquois, and
reduced to so powerless a state that they Were called “wo-
men” by their conquerors. But they had never acknow-
ledged the Iroquois as masters. The renowned Tam’-a-
nend, the greatest of their warriors and statesmen, was still
living at this time. He’ was afterwards known as St. Tam’-

‘ma-ny, and diﬁerent associations have since been called by

his name.

191. During the establishment of the various European
settlements, important events were transpiring among the
Indians of America. The chief of these was the formation
of the Iroquois confederacy, about the year 1539. It em-
braced ﬁve nations, the Mo’-hawks, Oneidas [0-ml’-claw], On-
ondagas [on-on-dam’-gctz], Cay-u’-gas, and Sen’-e-cas. With
these the Tuscaroras afterwards united, when they were
known by the name of “the Six Nations”. This confeder-
acy was the work of a great and wise chief, Hiawatha [hea-
wah’-t/za]. The Indians regarded him as the special favorite
of the Great Spirit, and believed that he was taken up to
heaven in a snow-white canoe amid strains of celestial music.

The original seat of the Five Nations was in what isnow
the central part of New York. But, after a series of bril-

lia.nt conquests towards the close-of the seventeenth century,
they claimed the Whole country from the St.Lavvrence to
the mouth of the Ohio. Their victorious career Was for a
time stopped by the Miamis and Illinois, who with savage
ferocity drank from the skulls of their slaughtered chiefs,
and ate the still quivering hearts of their tortured Warriors.
But at lastthese also Were vanquished. Such was the suc-
cess of the Iroquois that even to remote tribes their very
name became a terror.

192. We have described the efforts of Eliot to convert
the Indians of Massachusetts. Some time before, Jesuit mis-
sionaries had taken the ﬁeld among the northern and West-
ern tribes. The Mohawks had been visited in 1617, a mis-
sion had been established among the Hurons, a college and
convent had been founded at Quebec, and the standards of
the Roman Catholic Church and of France had been set up
at various points from Maine to Lake Huron.

193. Passing over several Who perished in the Wilderness,

from accident and hardship, and others who suffered martyr-
dom in the War between the I-Iurons and Iroquois, We come
to Allouez [al-Zoo-Z/]. In 1665, he explored the country about
Lake Superior, and discovered the Pictured. Rocks on the
southern shore, Where the sandstone, 300 feet high, is Worn
into forms resembling the hoary Walls and broken columns
of an ancient ruin. Here he taught the Chippeways and
Sioux, and was told by the latter of the Mississippi, or “great
river”. .

next took the ﬁeld. After establishing the important station

CHAPTERI.

ORIGIN OF THE AMERICAN INDIANS.

6. WHEN America was discovered by Europeans, it Was
occupied by tribes differing in many respects from the na-
tions of the old World. Their manners, customs, languages,
and personal appearance, all proclaimed them a distinct race.
From their color, they Were by some styled RED MEN; While
the erroneous idea of early adventurers that America formed
part of the East Indies, led to their being called INDIANS,
and by this name they have generally been known. As these
native tribes play a prominent part in our early history, it
is important to consider their origin and peculiarities, their
territorial limits and mutual relations.

7. We must first ask Whence and how America was peo-
pled. It is separated from the Eastern Continent, on one

i side by three thousand miles. of ocean, and on the other by

an expanse of Water for the most part three times as bread.

6. When discovered, by whom was America occupied? In what did they differ from
the nations of the old World? What names were given them, and why? 7. What would
seem to render it impossible for America to have been peopled from the Eastern Conti-

The Indians they met advised them to give up the journey,
declaring that they Would have to encounter not onlyhos
tile nations and intense heats, but monsters and demons that
Would certainly destroy them. The zealous Frenchmen,
however, Were not discouraged.’ Passing through Green
Bay, they found a village Where Allouez had been before.
The cross he had erected Was loaded With bows and arrows,
skins and belts, hung there as offerings to the Great Spirit.
They soon struck the Wisconsin, and ﬁnally, to their inex-
pressible joy, reached the Mississippi. Descending the river,
they held intercourse from time to time With the Indians on
its banks, Whom they found gentle and friendly, though
brave, and already supplied With arms from the European
settlements. After reaching the mouth of the Arkansas,
feasted by the natives at different points With hominy and
dog-ﬂesh, they retraced their course in safety to Green Bay.

The zealous Marquette soon after undertook another expe-
dition, to the Indians of Illinois, Whose hearts Were Won by
his gentleness and love. While sailing along the eastern
coast of Lake Michigan, on his return, he Went ashore to
perform a religious ceremony. His men Waited long for his
reappearance; and, on going to seek him, found that he had
died during his prayers. They buried him near the mouth
of a stream called from him the Marquette. Years after,
when the Indian Was tossed on the boisterous surface of the
lake, he Would seek to calm the tempest and still the Waves
by calling on the name of the pious missionary.

195. La Salle [la]; Sal] next engaged in explorations in
the West, under a commission from Louis XIV., of France.
Though possessed of limited means, La Salle Was a man of

ﬁrst sail boat that ever crossed Lake Ontario. After losing
his vessel, performing a long journey partly overland and
partly with canoes, building forts and trading-houses, and
meeting with a variety of romantic adventures, La. Salle
ﬁnally returned to Canada. A portion of his company,
among whom was Hennepin, reached the Mississippi, and
gave the name of St. Anthony to the falls in the upper par‘:
of that river. In 1681, he again started, and this time
reached the Mississippi himself. After sailing down it to the
Gulf of Mexico (1682) and taking possession of the country
for his king, in whose honor he named it Louisiana, he re-
turned, and crossed the ocean to France for further means.

He was there intrusted with the command of an expedi-
tion ﬁtted out for the purpose of colonizing Louisiana. At-
tempting to reach the scene of his former discoveries from
the south, he was unable to ﬁnd the great river he had de-
scended. In the effort his store-ship was wrecked, and there
was no alternative but to seek the desired spot by land. At
one time we read of him in Texas, at another in northern
Mexico. His men sunk under their hardships, and La Salle
himself became soured and discouraged. “ The hidden
river” was nowhere to be found, and at last he resolved to
traverse the continent in search of it as far as Canada, and if
still unsuccessful to returnto France for a new outﬁt. He
had’ reached a branch of the Trinity River, in Texas, when
he was murdered by some of his men, whom repeated disap-
pointments incited to the crime. But few of La Sa1le’s com-
pany survived the hardships of this ourney to Canada.
They had left a colony on the Colorado [col-0-m/z’-do]; but
it was soon destroyed by the Spaniards, who based on this
conquest a claim to Texas.

NEW YORK, TO 1689.--FRENCH AND IROQUOIS WAR.

196. NIoHoLs, who took New York from the Dutch in
1664, acted as governor for three years. Contenting himself
with extortinglarge sums of money from the land-owners,
he neither attempted reforms, nor grantedthe people any
greater liberty than they had before enjoyed. In 1667,
Nichols was succeeded by Lovelace. War soon after broke
out between England and Holland. An attack was expected
by the authorities of New York, and the city was put in a
state of defence. The Dutch made their appearance in the
harbor, as had been anticipated; but, instead of attempting
an assault, they bribed the officer in command of the fort,
and thus quietly obtained possession of the city and the
whole province.

197. By a treaty made in 1674, New York was ‘restored
to the English, and Sir Edmund An’-dros became its governor
under a new patent granted to James, Duke of York. One
of his ﬁrst acts was to punish the traitor who had admitted
the Dutch into the city, by having his sword broken over his
head in front of -the City Hall. The new governor tried to
extend his authority over Connecticut and New Jersey, but
was ﬁrmly resisted and failed in both attempts. The people
of New York, also, complained loudly of his encroachments
on their rights and demanded a voice in their own govern-
ment. The Duke of York, whose instructions had been
faithfully followed by Andros, at a loss what course to pur-
sue,‘ applied to William Penn for counsel. This friend of
popular liberty advised him to abandon his arbitrary meas-
ures; and without delay Andros was recalled, and Thomas

Dongan was sent over as governor, with directions to recog-
nize the authority of the Assembly (1683).

198. The most important act of Dongan’s administration
was the conclusion of a treaty with the Iroquois. Anticipa-
ting an invasion by the French, the chiefs of the Mohawks
and other tribes imet the governors of New York and Vir-
ginia at Albany, and interchanged pledges of friendship.
They were none too soon; for the next month [August,

1684], De la Barre [bar], governor of Canada, made a de- ,

scent upon their hunting-grounds. Before he encountered
the Indians, sickness prostrated most of his soldiers. The
cimning Frenchman then sought to make. the Iroquois be-»
lieve that he had come ‘merely to smoke the pipe of peace.
Though they understood the state of the case, theRed Men
allowed their enemies to depart, and the invaders returned
in disgrace to Canada. A

De la Barre was superseded by Denonville [die-nong-veel’].
The latter proceeded to establish a fort at Niagara, despite
the remonstrances of the governor of New York. At this
time (1686), began the conflict between French and English
claims which afterwards led to a destructive war. .

199. Instructions were received by the new governor to
capture as many Indians as he could and send them to
France. Accordingly a number of Iroquois were_ enticed
into a French fort, under pretence that a treaty was to be
made, and were there seized. They were afterwards sent to
Marseilles [mcw'—sciZz’] a11d consigned to the galleys. A large
army of Indians immediately assembled to attack Montreal.
Denonville appeased their fury by complying, with their de-
mands; and the war would probably have ended had it not
been for the machinations of a Huron chief. Fearing an
attack from the Five Nations, if peace should be made, he
craftily led them to believe that the French were dealing
treacherously, and had invited him to aid in their destruc-

Montreal, laid waste the city, massacred a thousand of the
inhabitants, and overran a great part of Canada. The French
in despair blew up Forts Frontenac and Niagara. Their
power was now nearly extinguished, not a single town re-

maining in their possession between the St. Lawrence and T

Mackinaw’.

CHAPTER XX.

NEW ENGLAND UNDER ANDROS AND PHIPPS..

200. WHEN the Duke of York became King of England
under the title of James II. [1685], he revoked the charters
of the northern colonies and made Sir Edmund Andros gov-=
ernor of all New England. _ Remembering how he had been
treated a few years before in New York, Andros determined
to carry out to the letter the principles of his despotic master.
Every right that the people had enjoyed, was now denied
them, while their taxes were largely increased. The Church
of England was established contrary to their wishes, and

, meetings of the people, except for the choice of town oﬁicers,

were prohibited. .
201. After dissolving the Assembly of Rhode island, An-=

dros proceeded to Connecticut and demanded the surrender

of its charter. Governor Treat remonstrated with him, but

- in Vain. The Assembly, then in session at Hartford, engaged

in an earnest debate on the subject, which was protracted
till evening; and the people crowded into the hall to hear

until overthrown by “Q x‘\?‘c\"\‘ 1 a violent storm in
the year 1856. Though the instrument on which their
liberties were founded was thus saved, Andros assumed
the government. His next step was to supersede Dongan
in New York. Thus, in 1688, all the English possessions
north of Pennsylvania were united under one despotic gov-

ernment. ‘

This state of things, however, did not last long. i In the -

spring of 1689, news reached Boston, where Androslhad
ﬁxed his headquarters, that James II. was no longer king,
but had been displaced by Wiﬂiam of Orange. The people
immediately rose in open revolt. Their former magistrates
were restored. Andros was arrested, and sent to England
for trial. Representatives were elected, and it was voted
that the rights before enjoyed should be resumed. Similar
movements were made in the other colonies; and inCon-
necticut the Venerable parchment was drawn uninjured from
the hollow oak. T

III. They ﬁnally succeeded, -though the instrument was of
a totally different character from what they had expected.
Many of their privileges were taken away, including the
election of officers, who were thenceforth to be appointed
by the governor or the crown. The boundaries of the col-
ony were extended to the St. Lawrence, and an exposed
frontier was thus added, which it cost much to defend. To
reconcile the people to these changes, a native of New Eng-
land, Sir William Phipps, was appointed governor of Mas-
sachusetts. He had acquired a large fortune by raising plate,
jewels, and treasure from the wreck of a Spanish vessel in
Hispaniola, but, being ignorant and bigoted, he did little to
advance the interests of the colony.‘

KING wILLrAM’s WAR.

203. A MUTUAL jealousy had long existed between the
French and English in America. The former were far infe-
rior to the latter in number and strength, particularly after
their disastrous war with the Iroquois. But they had some
strong posts left, and claimed a vast tract, including Nova

- Scotia, Newfoundland, Labrador, Hudson’s Bay, Canada,

the valley of the Mississippi, and Texas. Their title to these
extensive regions rested on the explorations of French Jes-
uits, who had set up the arms of France in various parts of
the wilderness, and acquired great inﬂuence with the native
tribes.

of his countrymen, he found it necessary to alter his plans;
and, sending out emissaries, he excited the tribes  alliance

The Abenakis [ab-6-no;lc’—eea], a branch of the Lenni Lenapees
living in Maine [see Map, p. 10], were the iirst to commence
hostilities. They had been treacherously dealt with by Eng-
lish settlers thirteen years before, and rejoiced at this op-
portunity of revenge.   y

Two of their squaws were sent to the house of an aged
English magistrate named Wald1‘on, and, pleading fatigue,
obtained" permission to lodge there for the night. Rising
after the family had retired, they opened the doors to their
confederates. The savages placed Mr. Waldroii on a chair
on his own table, and bade him “judge Indians” now, as he
had done before. A number of them owed him money for
goods. Each, drawing his knife with inhuman barbarity
across the old man’s breast, cried in turn, “Thus I cross out
my account”. At last fainting from loss of blood, the unfor-
tunate man fell to the ﬂoor. The Indians, after burning his
house and others in the neighborhood, returned to their vil-
lages with 29 captives. The English settlements on the Pe-
nobscot and St. John’s were attacked in like manner, and in
a short time the Abenakis recovered the whole of their for-
mer hunting-grounds. I

205. Frontenac now resolved to strike a bold blow, in the
hope of inspiring the Iroquois, the old enemies of his nation,
with respect for French prowess, and winning them over from
the side of the English. Accordingly, in 1690, he ﬁtted out

a force of French and Indians for an attack on the New York
frontier. v A rapid march of twenty-two days brought them
to the neighborhood of Schenectady [sIce—ncc’-ta-dc]. About
an hour before midnight, they entered one of the gates in
the palisade wall that surrounded the village, and found all
the inhabitants asleep, even to the sentinel at his post. The
terrible war-whoop was raised, and the work of massacre
went on for two hours. Completely taken by surprise, the
settlers hardly attempted resistance. Some were butchered
in their beds; others hid themselves till the ﬂames of their
burning dwellings drove them on the tomahawks of their
foes; a few escaped half dressed into the woods  the hope
of reaching Albany, but were either lost amid the snow or
suffered incredible hardships. At sunset there had been
forty well-built houses in this thriving village; the next
morning hardly one was standing. About sixty of the in-
habitants had fallen. '

2.06. At last the English were roused to a sense of their

danger; and in 1690, at the suggestion of Massachusetts,
delegates from all the colonies as far south as Maryland
assembled in New York. They resolved to ﬁt out two ex~
peditions for the conquest of Canada,—a land force to invade
the country by way of Lake Champlain, and a ﬂeet to operate
against Quebec. The command of the latter was given to
Sir VVillia1n Phipps. After taking Port Royal, Phipps sailed
leisurely up the St. Lawrence. But meanwhile Frontenac
had received intelligence of his approach through an Indian
runner. When Phipps, therefore, arrived before Quebec’, he
found it prepared for the attack. His summons to surrender
was treated with contempt; and, as the land force which he
expected had not arrived, without attempting an assault, he
reémbarked his troops and sailed for home. Violent storms
shattered his ships; and, when Phipps returned to Boston, it
was found that nothing had been gained by the expedition
but an exhausted treasury.

207. King William’s War continued to aﬂiict the colonies

of the French were directed principally against the Iroquois,
who still remained faithful to the English. Frontenac in-»
vaded their country several times, burned their crops, de-
stroyed their castles, and took a number of prisoners, who
were cruelly tortured by the “Christian Indians” in his em-
ploy. The latter, also, made descents from time to time on
the frontier settlements of the English. One of these fur-
nishes a remarkable instance of courage in a feeble woman.
In March, 1697, a party of Indians attacked a house in
Haverhill [h&’-oer-il], Mass. [see Map, p. 84]. Its owner,
Mr. Dustin, was at work in a neighboring ﬁeld, and before
he could get home the Indians had dragged his sick wife
from her bed and dashed out the brains of her newly born
infant. Mr. Dustin tried to defend his seven remaining
children, bidding them run to the Woods while he kept the
Indians of with his gun. The party that had taken Mrs.
Dustin drove her and her nurse, almost overcome by fatigue
and cold, several miles beyond Concord, N. H. Here they
stopped for a time; but Mrs. Dustin, hearing that she was
to be taken to a distant village, resolved to escape or die.
There was a boy in the family of her captor, who had been
a prisoner for a year. This boy, at her request, asked his
master the proper mode of striking a blow so as to cause in-»
stant death. The Indian willingly gave the desired informa-
tion, and also showed him how to take off a scalp. These
instructions being communicated to Mrs. Dustin, shortly be-
fore dawn she silently awoke the boy and her nurse, and as-
signed their respective parts. The work was ‘quickly done.
Ten of the sleeping Indians were killed, one woman escaped,
and a child was spared. After scalping the savages that she

12 ORIGIN on THE AMERICAN INDIANS.

Hence it seems, at ﬁrst glance, almost impossible that it

should have been reached, in an age when ships Were small‘

and frail, when the mariner’s compass was unknown and the
sailordared not trust himself out of sight of land. This led
men to suppose that the inhabitants of America did not de-
scend from Adam and Eve, but from a race previously cre-
ated. Such a theory’ is plainly contrary to the Bible record,
nor is it needed to account for the settlement of America.
.8. Later discoveries have brought to light a fact unknown
to geographers three hundred years ago, that America wi-
dens rapidly in the north, and there juts out into the ocean
till it comes within thirty-six ‘miles of Asia. , As a current
sets -towards the American shore, the passage thither can be
readily made even in rude vessels. Boats may have been
driven over by stress of weather, and the continent thus

have been discovered without design. But there was a still‘

easier means of communication. In severe seasons, ,Behring’s
Strait is frozen over. , ‘Many varieties of animals have passed
on the ice from one continent to the other; and the ﬁrst oc-

cupants of America, led by curiosity, or driven by violence,-

may have reached the newiworld in the same manner.

9. At what time this event took place, we are not in-
formed. History makes no mention of it. It is probable
that it occurred at an early date, not many centuries after
the dispersion at Babel and the consequent emigration from
the plain of Shi’nar. Mankind soon spread out from the
limited district to which they were at ﬁrst conﬁned, and took

a possession of the vacant lands around them, which, as their
numbers increased, became necessary to their comfort. Thus

they gradually found theirway to Northeastern Asia; and
at length adventure or accident made them acquainted with
the existence of a new continent.

CHAPTER XXII.

VVITCHCRAFT IN NEW ENGLAND.

208. IN 1692, while King William’s War‘ was still at its
height, New England suifered from a strange delusion, which
originated with a few superstitious ministers and magistrates.
Some ch_ildren of Mr. Parris, who was settled over the church
of Salem (now Danvers), Mass, being affected in an unusual
manner, their father fancied that they were bewitched, and
scourged an Indian servant till she confessed that she was a
witch, and had caused their illness. Cotton Mather, an ec-
centric but inﬂuential minister, took the matter up, and great
excitement spread through the colony. Public prosecutions
Were commenced, and a gallows was erected for the -guilty
at the end of the town. In June, a poor and friendless old
woman was tried. Convicted on the evidence of her neigh-

bors, who charged her with being the cause of various mis-

fortunes thatlhad befallen them, she was forthwith hanged.
The wildest assertions were blindly credited. Mather him-
self tells us that the old woman only looked at the spacious
meeting-house of Salem, and an invisible demon tore down
a part of it. .

209. Five women, “all of blameless lives,” were convicted
at the next session of the court; and these, with ﬁve others
afterwards found guilty, were hanged. The officer ordered
to arrest them refused to assist in what he considered mura
der, and was himself seized and executed. The excitement
became intense. People actually fancied themselves be-

on for the guilty? What took place in June? What does Mather tell us about this
old woman? 209. Soon after this, how many were hanged on the charge of witchcraft ?'

witched, and gave evidence against their relations and
friends. Testimony that would have been excluded in other

cases was received and acted on. Weak-minded fanatics,

children, and even those who were known to have perjured
themselves, were admitted as witnesses. When other means
failed, the accused were tortured until they acknowledged
themselves guilty. One young woman Was so wrought upon
as to give evidence against her grandf'atheIf,_but afterwards
took back what she had said. The judges, while they ac-
cepted her testimony,'rejected her recantation, and sent the
old man to the gallows, , I .

Among those hanged in August, was a minister named
Burroughs [bm*’-rose], who had denounced the proceedings
of Mather and his associates, and declared that there was no
such thing as witchcraft. He made a speech on the scaffold,
and repeated the _Lord’s Prayer ‘so affectingly as to draw
tears from the spectators. At this moment Mather appeared
among the crowd on horseback, and quieted the people with
quotations from Scripture. An old man of eighty, refusing
to plead because he saw that every trial resulted in convic«
tion, was barbarously pressed to death. This was followed
by the execution of eight more unfortunate victims on the
gallows. Twenty in all had now become martyrs to the
delusion, while upwards of ﬁfty had been frightened or tor-
tured into confession. ’

210. At last, the people began to awake to the horror of
such scenes. When the legislature of Massachusetts assem-
bled in October, 1692, numerous petitions for protection
were presented. Mather, who gloried in these judicial mur-
ders, had feared this ; and, in a work entitled “ The Wonders
of the Invisible World,” he sought to prove that the heinous
sin of witchcraft really existed among them, and that the
proper course had been taken to root it out. Notwithstand-
ing this, the legislature promptly abolished the Special court

were opened, and the accused were acquitted as fast as they
were tried. The despotic power of a few fanatics was
broken; there was no more hanging or torturino‘. Most of
those who had participated in the bloody work afterwards
confessed their error, but Mather defended his course to the
last.

CHAPTER XXIII.

NEW YORK UNDER ; LEISLER, SLOUGHTER, FLETCHER, AND
BELLAMONT.-—CAPTAIN KIDD.

211. WHEN news of the fall of James II. was received in
New York, a committee of safety, formed of ten’ citizens,
took possession of the fort, and intrusted the government to
Jacob Leisler [Zz'ce’-Zer]. His authority was denied by Col.
Bayard [bi-carol] and the magistrates of Albany, who held
commissions from James II. Having forwarded to King

1 William a candid statement of what had been done, Leisler

sent his son-in-law to demand the submission ofAlbany. This
was refused with an open deﬁance of his power. Bayard
continued his opposition; but in a few weeks he fell into
Leisler’s hands, and was consigned to prison.

Meanwhile the king had appointed Sloughter [slcm0'—te7~]
governor, and in 1691 he arrived. Leisler immediately sur-
rendered the fort, but had no sooner done so than he was
arrested on a charge of treason. He had ruled nearly two
years by the authority of the people, and with the silent
consent of the king; but he was now in the power of the
governor’s council, of which Bayard was a member, and his
fate was sealed. A court composed of persons whose opin-

LEISLER ON THE GALL()‘WS.

in the presence of an immense crowd, Who, though over-
awed by English soldiers, testiﬁed with groans and shrieks

their abhorrence of the execution. Leisler in his dying

speech maintained that his course had been that of a sincere
patriot. The people regarded him as a martyrto their cause,
and saved pieces of his garments as precious relics. During
the execution, his enemies were drowning the rebukes of
conscience in wine and revelry.

After making a treaty with the Iroquois at Albany, Slough-
ter died. He Was succeeded by an intemperate tyrant named
Fletcher. Fletcher employed himself mainly in quarrelling

his arrival, what did Leisler do? What charge was brought against him? By Whose
authority had he held the government? Give an account of his trial. Describe his

charter had been sadly curtailed. In 1698, he gave place to
the Earl of Bel’-la-mont, a man of enlightened and liberal
views. Bellamont’s commission gave him authority over
New York, and the whole of New England except Rhode
Island and Connecticut.

212. About this time, a person named William Kidd gain-
ed a wide notoriety. Having proved himself an able naval
oﬁicer in the war with France, he was appointed commander
of a vessel ﬁtted out by private enterprise in England to
cruise against the pirates in the eastern seas. Not ﬁnding
the voyage as proﬁtable as was expected, Kidd and his men
turned pirates themselves. After taking many vessels and
accumulating a large amount of treasure, Kidd ran for the
West Indies, and there learned that a proclamation had been

issued against him in England. In spite of this, he ventured"

to return to New York. Fletcher, the old patron of pirates,
was no longer governor; and Kidd, after secretly depositing
part of his treasure and distributing the balance among his
crew, proceeded to Boston to meet Bellamont, who was one
of the projectors of the enterprise. The latter, not satisﬁed
with his statements, arrested him, and sent him to London
for trial. Here, after some delay, granted him in the hope
that he would implicate those who had sent him out, Kidd
was convicted. He was hanged in chains in May, 1701, pro-
testing his innocence to the last, and declaring that he had
attacked none but French vessels, and consequently violated
no law, France and England being then at war.

213. Repeated attempts have been made to ﬁnd the treas-

ure supposed to have been buried by Captain Kidd. One I

tradition says that his vessel was taken up the Hudson and
sunk with its valuable cargo at the foot of the Highlands.
The general opinion, however, points to Long Island Sound

execution. With whom did Sloughter make a treaty? By whom was he succeeded?
What was Fletcher’s character? In what did be mainly employ himself? To whom
did Fletcher give place? What was included in Bellamont’s charter? 212. Shortly
before this, who had become notorious? What was Kidd’s early history? VVl1at led
him and his men to turn pirates? After accumulating a large amount of treasure, what
islands did Kidd make for? Where did he then go? What action was taken by Bella—
mont? What became of Kidd? What did he declare to the last? 213. What attempts

rates was actually found on Grardiner’s Island, containing 750
ounces of gold and 847 ounces of silver, besides other valu-
ables. The balance of Kidd’s ill-gotten gains have been
diligently sought for by treasure-hunters, but in vain. A
small island in the Sound, visible from the Connecticut shore,

is still known as “K,idd’s Island”. A cave is shown where

the pirates are said to have slept, and a deep hollow in a
rock is called “ Kidd’s punch-bowl”. Throughout the whole
neighborhood, according to the old song,

i*“Ever since the days of Captain Kidd,
The Yankees think there’s money hid,”

SOUTH CAROLINA FROM 1690 TO 1700..

214. AFTER Colleton was deposed in South Carolina, Soth’-
el, one of the proprietaries and a man of the people’s choice,
was appointed governor, Though his administration was

r distinguished by some wise measures, such as the admission

of Huguenots tothe privileges of citizens, it was on the whole
unsatisfactory; and, threatened with legal proceedings, Soth-A
el deemed it best to withdraw. His successors tried in vain
to reconcile the differences between the people and the pro-
prietaries, It was not till 1695, when the government fell
into the hands of an honest Quaker named Archdale, in
whom all parties had confidence, that harmony was restored
and prosperity revived, Archdale made a treaty with the
Spaniards of St. Augustine, the sincerity of which was proved
by mutual acts of kindness. There was now nothing to check

found on Grardineﬁs Island? Where is “ Kidd’s Island”? What are still shown? What
does an old song say?’

the growth of the colony. Scotland and New England both
contributed emigrants, who found in the rich soil and genial
climate of Carolina all they desired. The Church of England
was established by law, but other sects were tolerated.

215. Rice was ﬁrst raised in 1696, from seed sent to Arch-
dale from Madagascar. The attempt had been previously
made, but without success. In 1698, it was ﬁrst exported,
16 casks being sent to’England.

The cultivation of cotton in America commenced at J ames—
town, in 1621 ; but, not proving proﬁtable, it was abandoned.
In 1702, both cotton and silk were produced in South Caro-
lina. The importance of the former Was hardly appreciated
till a century later.

CHAPTER XXV.

FRENCH SETTLEMENTS IN THE SOUTHVVEST.-"—CHICKASAW WAR.

216. THOUGH La Salle had takenpossession of Louisiana
in behalf of France, the Spanish also claimed it under the
discoveries of Ponce de Leon and De Soto. Resolved to
secure a region whose future importance he foresaw, the
French king, immediately after the peace of Ryswick, sent
out a company under I)’Iberville [dc-bare-veeZ’] to colonize
the country. They entered “the hidden river” in 1699.
Disappointed in what he saw, D’Iberville thought he was
mistaken in the place, till the Indians brought him a letter
that had been written to La Salle by his lieutenant, which
they had kept with superstitious awe for thirteen years. He
founded Biloxi [be-Zulc’-se], and in 1700, ascending the river
to where Natchez now stands, selected a site for a military

D’Iberville having died, the king of France in 1712 grant-
ed Crozat [cm-za»/1'] a monopoly of Louisiana for ﬁfteen
years. Finding no Inines and disappointed in the hope

of increasing his wealth, in ﬁve years he surrendered:
the colony to the king, leaving in it only seven hundred

souls.

217. The next thing tried for the advancement of French
interests in Louisiana‘ was the grand Mississippi ‘ Scheme.
John Law, a ruined gambler from Scotland, devised a plan
for enriching himself and his ‘ partners by an indeﬁnite issue
of paper Inoney. A company was formed in Paris, which
obtained the sole right of coining money, and of trading with
Asia, Canada, and the Mississippi valley. When the paper
circulation was over $200,000,000,-Law was made Minister
of Finance. He kept up the value of his bills by ordering

that any one who sought to exchange Mississippi money for

silver should forfeit both. It Was thought that untold wealth
would be amassed, and the stock rose to nearly twenty times
its nominal value. But soon the bubble burst; in May,
1720, the notes were worth only ten cents on a dollar and
the company. was bankrupt. Thousands were ruined, and
Louisiana gained nothing from this grand delusion.

L 218. In 1718, more French colonistswere sent over; a
city was laid out with much ceremony and named New Or~
leans after the Duke of Orleans, then regent. -For several
years it grew but little; huts were put up without order

and the people who had been sent to build a city encampecil

on its borders, as an old historian tells us, “waiting for
houses”. The proprietors of the colony introduced the cul-
ture of tobacco, indigo-, rice, and silk, and opened the‘ lead
mines of Missouri in their search for silver; but, ﬁnding that

they were losing money, they surrendered their privileges
to the crown. ‘

Meanwhile the Frenchmen at Fort Rosalie had required
the high-spirited Natchez, “the children of the sun,” to give
up their ancient city, that it might be turned into a planta~
tion. Fired by this injustice, and incited by the Chickasaws,
the Natchez, in 1729, fell on the fort, and put" to death all it
contained, except the women and children, and two me-
chanics. Early in the following year, a party of French
from New Orleans revenged this massacre. The Natchez
were almost exterminated. Such of the survivors as were
not soldiinto slavery in St. Domingo, sought refuge with
other tribes, and lost their very name.

219. The French did not forget the .part the Chickasaws
had acted, and in 17 36 the forces of New France were or-
dered to. concentrate in the Chickasaw country. D’Arta-
guette [dar-ta-get’], governor of Illinois, with the young and
accomplished Vincennes [vim-senz’], descended the river at
the head of a few French and about a thousand Indians.
Not daring to wait for the army from New Orleans, on "ac-

count of the impatience of his redallies, D’Artaguette at-

tacked the foe; but, after carrying two -of their posts, he fell
mortally wounded in storming a third. The Indians ﬂed,
leaving the two French leaders in the enemies’ hands. Five
days afterwards, Bienville [be-cmg-veeZ’] made his appearance

from below; but the Chickasaws were now strongly fortiﬁed

by the aid of English traders, and his assaults were repulsed.
Within three days a retreat was ordered. The invaders
threw their cannon into the river, and started for home;
and the Red Men celebrated their victory by burning D’Ar-
taguette, Vincennes, and the rest of their prisoners, at the
stake. _ I I

220. THE peace of Ryswick did not remain long in force.
Jealous of the increasing power of the Bourbon family, Wil~
liam III., early in the eighteenth century, declared war
against France and Spain, which were both at the time
under:Bourbon princes. Dying soon after, William was sue.
ceeded by Queen Anne, whose name has been given to the
war which followed. In the new world, hostilities were
commenced in South Carolina. Gov. Moore attacked the
Spanish at St. Augustine [see Map, p. 151], in the autumn
of 1702. He took the town without difficulty, but the
Spanish bravely ‘defended the castle, and sent a messenger

to the French commander at Mobile to come to their aid.

Two Spanish vessels soon appeared on the Florida coast, and
Moore was obliged to abandon his stores and retreat. Un-
able to pay the expenses thus incurred, the authorities of
South Carolina issued bills of credit, or paper money.

221. Another expedition, undertaken soon after against
the Indian allies of the Spanish and French on Ap-a-lach’-ee
Bay [see Map, p. 10], was more successful. St. Marks and
other villages were burned, a number of prisoners were taken,
and several tribes submitted, and were received under the
jurisdiction of Carolina.

could thus have been easily crossed; but some think that
ancient navigators ﬁrst reached the new world by way of the
Atlantic. As early as the days of Solomon, the Phoenician
seamen made voyages to O’-phir. At a later date, Hanno,
the Carthaginian, is said to have sailed thirty days southwest
from the Strait of Gibraltar. The early Egyptian navigators
were particularly distinguished for their skill. and daring;
and we are told that during the reign of Pharaoh Necho
[f&’-ro ne'-kc], about 600 B. 0., a company of explorers started
from the Isthmus
of Suez [300-ez’],
on the Red Sea,
and sailed com-
pletely round Af-

America may have been reached. Plato and several other
ancient Writers appear to have been aware that there was a
large body of land in the west, and speak of an island in that
direction more extensive than Europe and Africa. ,
11. Some historians have tried to trace the American In-
dians to the ten “ lost tribes” of Israel, who were conquered
by Shalmaneser [shal-ma,-ne’-269"], king of Assyria, about 700
B. 0. Many of the vanquished were carried into captivity,
and uniting with their conquerors lost all separate existence

on Charleston, which wassuccessﬁilly resisted by the people,
without aid from the proprietaries. Three hundred French-
men were killed or taken prisoners in trying to effect a land-:
ing, and one of their ships was captured.

223. In the mean time, the Indians of Maine and New
Hampshire, who were in the interest of the French, after
lulling thefears of the English by declaring that ‘ the sun
was not more distant from the earth than their thoughts
from war’, suddenly fell upon the frontier settlements, made
a general massacre, and retired beyond the reach of pursuit.
In the course of the winter, they assailed Deerﬁeld, in north-
ern Massachusetts [see Map, p. 111]. This place was sur-
rounded by palisades, and guarded nightly by sentinels. On
the last day of February, 1704, a party of French and In-
dians, after a toilsome march from Canada on the crust of
the snow, approached the town. Just before dawn, while
the sentinels were absent from their posts, they effected an
entrance, the snow having drifted against the palisades, and
rendered «them useless as a defence. The town was soon in
ﬂames. Forty—seven of the inhabitants were killed, and 112
made prisoners. The latter, during the march to Canada,
suffered intensely from cold and hunger. Not a few sunk
by the wayside under the accumulated horrors of the jour-
ney, and welcomed the savage tomahawk which ended their
sorrows.

part, of America a colony for the poor and helpless. In

presented Oglethorpe a buffalo skin adorned on the inside
Withlthe head and feathers of an eagle. “ The feathers of

riors hastened to Welcome the English.” “ The Great Spirit,”
said one, “Who dwells everywhere and gives breath to _all
men, has sent the English to instruct us.” Oglethorpe Was
not insensible to their kindness, and sought to repay it by
sending Moravian missionaries among them.

225. Early in 1733, the city of Savannah Was founded.
The streets Were regularly laid out; the houses were built
of uniform size, and surrounded with gardens of fruit and
vegetables. Encouraged even beyond his expectations, Ogle-
thorpe returned to England for more emigrants. E A com»
pany of Scottish mountaineers Were sent over under his
auspices, and made a‘ settlement at Darien. -The governor
himself returned in 17 36, accompanied by John and Charles
Wes’-ley. The former came with the determination to con»
vert the Indians and make Georgia a religious colony; but
Within two years the returned to England, and subsequently
became distinguished as one of the founders of the Methodist
church. Another noted divine,’ the eloquent ‘ Wlﬁteﬁeld
[w/zz't’;ﬁ‘eZ’cZ], passed some years in the colony, an_d established
an orphan asylum at Savannah, Where he preached With great
success. '  

226. Feeling the necessity of defences on the south,
Oglethorpe built a fort on ‘St. Simon’s Island, at the mouth
of the~Altamaha [al-ta-ma-/La/2,’], and ﬁxed on the St. John’s
River as the southern boundary of the English possessions.
The Spanish regarded this as an encroachment on their
territory, and detained the messengers of the English gov»
ernor as prisoners. Oglethorpe at once prepared for War.
His Indian friends hastened to his aid. The Uchees marched
to Savannah in their proudest War-paint, and joined the
no less valiant bands of Muscogees that had there assem-

cogee chiefs? How did Oglethorpe seek to repay their kindness? 225. In what year

Notwithstanding his efforts, the colony had hardly yet be-
gun to prosper. Except in the Moravian settlements, where
indigo was raised and 10,000 pounds of silk Were produced
annually, but little attention was paid to agriculture. The
settlers complained of "a clause in their charter which pro-
hibited slavery, and the trustees at length found it expedient
to disregard the regulations on this subject. Slave labor
became common, and agriculture began to ﬂourish. In 17 5 2,
the trustees resigned their charter to the king. The liber-
ties of the people were extended; and, when the cession of
Florida to the English rendered the frontier secure, nothing
remained to interfere with the prosperity of Georgia.

228. As the new World increased in population, it became
evident that the conflicting claims of France and England
would have to be settled by force of arms. N o boundary
line had. yet been drawn between their possessions on the
north or west. The English based their claim chieﬂy on the
Indian titles which they had purchased. To secure such fur»
ther rights to the soil as the Indians retained, commissioners

from Virginia and Maryland, with the governor of Pennsyl-

vania, met the Iroquois chiefs in 17 44 ; and bought, for.£200

and they were soon playing upon their former masters. The
efforts of the New Englanders Were next directed against
the fort, which well deserved -its_ reputation for strength.
Its massive walls were forty feet thick at the base and about
twenty-ﬁve feet high. They were surrounded by a deep
ditch, eighty feet in width, and were defendednby nearly 200
cannon and a garrison of 1,600 men. After a siege of about
six weeks, the French surrendered.

229. The news of this victory was received at Boston with
public rejoicings. Thepeople felt proud of having struck so
important a blow without the aid of the mother country.
They even proposed to follow up their success with an inva~
sion of Canada; but the British Ministry, unwilling to en-
.courage the military power’ of the colonies, would not co-
operate with them, and the scheme was abandoned. The
treaty of Aix la Chapelle [Ewe la/z s/La-]9eZ’] put an end to the
War in 1748. According to its provisions, Louisburg was
restored to the French, and the brave men of New England
were thus deprived. of the fruits of their valor.

While the states of Europe were discussingthe terms of this

land County, Virginia, on the 11th of February (the 22d ac-
cording to the New Style*), 1732. He sprung. from an an—
cient family, whose original name was Wes’-syng-ton. Seve-
ral of his ancestors were prominent at different periods of
English history, and his great-grandfather, who emigrated to
America in 1657, had led. the forces of Virginia against the
Indians. His father, Augustine Washington, died when he
was eleven years old; his mother lived to see him the head
of a nation. She was a woman of extraordinary powers, and
to her wise and high-toned instructions her distinguished son
owed much of that intellectual and moral excellence which
has immortalized his name. A

At school, the young George was a general favorite. He
is described as having an expressive face, a rich complexion,
a clear blue eye, a winning smile, and an erect, athletic

ﬁgure. His mind was as vigorous as his frame; and in all

sports and exercises, as well as the mimic military manoeuvres
which the young mountaineers made a part of their educa-
tion, he was an acknowledged leader. So, in his studies he
was surpassed by none. Books, containing his sums and ex-
ercises, still preserved, show that care and precision were
even at this early period marked traits of his character.

At sixteen, Washington was a proﬁcient in geometry and
trigonometry. Surveying he had practically applied in the

* Washington was born on the 11th of February. His birthday is
celebrated on the 22d, because the datehas been reduced to the New
Style of chronology. To correct an error occasioned by the imperfect
calendar then prevalent, and make the months correspond- with the
seasons, the British Parliament, in 17 51, retrenched eleven days in Sep-
tember, ordering that the 3d of that month should pass for the 14th.
Historians, in giving the dates of events prior to that time, have in some
cases, as in that of Washington’s birthday, conformed them to the New
Style. ’ .

that name. Here George became acquainted with Lord
Fairfax, an extensive land proprietor, who employed him to
survey a large tract on the south branch of the Potomac.
The opportunity thus afforded of perfecting himself in the
art was not neglected. In this romantic region, the luxuri-
ance of nature yielded him abundant food» for admiration,
while the wild beast that crossedhis path, and the wander-
ing savage, with his proud paint and girdle of scalps, proved
the depth of the solitude. A little straw, or a heap of dry
leaves, by the camp.-ﬁre, was his bed at night. He Was
“ himself his own cook, having no spit but a forked stick, no
plate’ but a large chip”.

232. In 1749, a company, which included Lawrence and
Augustine Washington. among its members, obtained from
the English crown a grant of 500,000 acres on the Ohio. It
was called the Ohio Company, andits objects were to trade
with A the Indians, and settle the country west of the Alle-

taken possession of it in thename of their country, and
sought to make friend's"'and allies of its Indian occupants.
They had built a fort at Presq" Ile [pres keel], now Erie,
and in 1752 showed what course they intended to pursue by
breaking up a British post on the Miami, and carrying off its
occupants to Canada. The chief of the Miami confederacy,
who had bravely defended the English, was taken prisoner,
and inhumanlykilled and eaten by the savage allies of the
French. ~

Alarmedby these movements, the Shawnees, Delawares,
and other Ohio Indians, sent the brave Half King to Erie to
remonstrate with the French commissioners. “ You and the
English are white,” said he, “and we live in a country be-
tween you. The land belongs to neither of you. The Great
Being above allowed it to be a dwelling—place for us.” “ It
is my land,” answered the haughty Frenchman; “ and Iwill
have it, let who will stand up against it.” On hearing that
the Half King’s,__ mission had been unsuccessful, the western
tribes quickly sent ambassadors to the English at Carlisle
[car-ZiZe’], Pennsylvania. ,They were met by the wise
Franklin, who conciliated them with gifts and promises of
protection.

233. The French had now established posts at Wate1'ford
and Venango, in northwestern Pennsylvania ; and Governor
Din-wid’-die, of Virginia, determined -to send a trusty mes-
senger to the commander to demand the reason of his intru-
sion on English territory. Washington was selected, at the
age of twenty-one, for this important mission. Two years
before, through the inﬂuence of Fairfax, he had been appoint-
ed Adjutant-general.

On the 31st of October, 1753, Washington left Willianis-’
burg, the capital of Virginia. After twenty-four days of
diligent and fatiguing travel, he reached the place where
Pittsburg now stands, and was struck with the military and

matter? Where had the French builta fort? What course did they pursue? What

would leave the multitude of the heathen, and go forth into
a further country where never mankind dwelt”. These un-
fortunate remnants of the ten tribes are thought by some to
have carried out their design by crossing into America, and
there to have become the progenitors of the Indian race.

History tells us that they advanced as far as Media.» Be-
yond this, we know nothing of their travels; nor is there
any evidence of their having ﬁnally settled in America except
a fancied resemblance between the customs and religious
ceremonies of the Indians and those of theancient Israelites.
Both had their priests and prophets, their washings and
anointings, their fasts, feasts, and sacriﬁces. But neither
these, nor other alleged points of resemblance, are suﬂicient
to prove the theory.

12. It seems far more probable that the ﬁrst settlers of
America were from Egypt. Their taste and ‘skill in build-
ing would indicate this, as well as the fact that in different
caves in the West bodies ‘have been found, preserved some-
what in the style of Egyptian mummies. A

The history of these early immigrants seems to be as fol-
lows :—Soon after the Confusion of Languages, a large body
of men, after a temporary residence" in Central India, driving
their ﬂocks before them, moved to Egypt, and conquered its
original settlers, the descendants of Miz’-ra-im. Under the
name of Shepherd Kings, they there founded a noble empire,
built large cities, and erected massive pyramids which still
remain as monuments of their power. The Mizraimites,
however, roused by their tyranny, ﬁnally rose against them,
and after a long contest drove them from the land. The de-
feated Shepherds, in quest of a new home, turned their course
to the northeast, and left, numerous traces of their passage
through Central Asia and Siberia in the form of well-built
walls and mounds. They are supposed at last to have crossed
into America in the manner before described, to have erected

to go on to Waterford; and this he did throughmire and
swamp, and across rivers rendered almost impassable by the

rains and snows of December. He found the fort strongly
defended. Many pine boats and bark canoes were in readi-=
ness for the contemplated expedition in the spring. St.
Pierre [peer], the commandant of the post, sought not to

disguise his intentions. He was there, he said, by the orders a

of his general, and according to those orders he should de-
stroy every English post on the Ohio. Unable to shake his
resolution, Washington prepared to go back; ‘but his Indian
companions had been so wrought upon with threats, ‘ﬂatter-»

St. Pierre tried every means to detain the Red Men and win
them over from the English; it was only by skilful manage-
ment that Washington bafﬂed his efforts. ,

The home journey was -full of dangers and diﬁiculties.

Intense cold and violent storms set in. The horses having _

become disabled, it was found necessary to go afoot, while
the labor of walking was greatly increased by the deep snow
with which the ground was covered. The streams were
swollen, and to cross them amid the drifting ice was toilsome
and perilous. The life of the youthful hero seems to have
been preserved almost miraculously. At one time, he was
ﬁred upon at a distance of ﬁfteen paces by an Indian in am-»
bush; at another, he was jerked from arude raft into the
angry waters of the Alleghany; Yet amid these dangers, he
was saved for greater things.  

Seldom has so important a mission been intrusted to one
so young, and never was mission more faithfully performed.
Washington could not induce the French to abandon their
claim to the Ohio valley; but he learned all that his gov-
ernment wanted to know respecting their designs and the
strength of the forts he visited. Through deserters from

COMMENCEMENT on THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR.

234. THE report of »Washington roused the colonists to

action. In accordance with his recommendation, the Ohio

company commenced the construction of .a fort at the junc-
tion of the Alleghany and the Monongahela, on the present
site of Pittsburg; and Gov. Dinwiddie dispatched a body of
men to protect the laborers. . The death of their colonel on
the march threw the command into the hands of Washing-
ton. The progress of the party through the heavy roads of

. the wilderness was necessarily slow; ‘and, before they had

performed half the journey, the unﬁnished work, together
with thirty-three men engaged on it, was taken by the
French. The latter went on with the building, and speedily
erected a strong ‘fortress, which they called Du Quesne [du
lccme’] after the new governor of Canada. b

This placed the Indian allies of the English in a critical
position. The Half King sent an express to Washington,

imploring him to come to their aid. This he was doing, as  

fast as he could cut roads and drag over them the cannon
and powder that had been designed for the new fort. On
some parts of the route, a day’s march carried him no more
than a couple of miles.’ When within a short distance of the
French, he hastily constructeda stockade, to which he gave
the appropriate name of Fort Necessity, throwing up with

continued his march, and soon had the pleasure of meeting
the faithful Half King. A council isvheld. Thechief an-
nounces that the French are near at hand in strong force,
lying in Wait for the wearied Virginians. A night attack is
forthwith concerted. The trail of the enemy is found, and
leads Washington and his companions, in-Indian ﬁle, through
the impenetrable darkness of a rainy night, to a camp con-
cealed among the roeks, where they are resting in fancied
security. Suddenly alarmed, the French rush to their guns;
but at the instant Washington orders his men to “ Fire!”
-and discharges his own musket. Hardly fo-r ﬁfteen minutes
is the contest protracted. Jumonville [zhoo-many-beef], the
French leader, is slain, with nine of his comrades, and twenty-
one prisoners fall into the hands of the English.

Washington had expected reinforcements, as well from
the colonies as from the friendly Indians of Ohio. Messen-
gers were sent to hasten their arrival; but only one company
came, and they proved rather an incumbranee than an aid,
their commander foolishly claiming precedence of the colonial
leader because he held his commission from the king. With
anxiety Washington heard that the French were concen-
trating around him, and at last he fell back on Fort Neces-
sity. Here his little band was besieged by 600 Frenchmen
and 100 Indians. After a severe fight, which lasted nine
hours, the French, though they had gained decided advan-
tages, proposed a parley, and agreed that Washington and
his men should march out with the honors of war, retaining
their stores and baggage. On the evacuation of this post
(1754), no English ﬂa.g waved west of the Alleghanies.

I62 FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR. [1754

Potomac was held at Albany in June, 1754; Oneof the
leading objects proposed was to“ conciliate the Iroquois, who
had been invited to the council. Many of their chiefs ap-
peared, including the great Mohawk, Hendrick. While they
accepted the proffered pledge of peace, the Iroquois braves
warned the English of impending dangers, and complained
of their tardiness in erecting fortiﬁcations. The delegates
promised more vigorous action, and the Indians departed,

-apparently satisﬁed, but really discouraged by the Want of

energy and promptness displayed by their allies.

The council 11ow had leisure to discuss the proposed union.
A plan brought forward by Benjamin Franklin was after
some debate adopted. By its provisions, a congress was to
assemble annually at Philadelphia, composed of from two
to seven delegates from each colony, according to its size.
This congress was to originate all laws and appoint civil
oﬂicers, to issue money, deal with the Indians, regulate trade,
govern new settlements, raise soldiers, and levy taXes,—all
its acts being subject to the veto of a governor—general ap-
pointedby the crown. Each colony was to have its own
legislature, and to be independent in its internal affairs.
Such was thenplan of union to be laid before the individual
colonies for their adoption. T

236. As the author of this important measure comes
prominently before us, it will be well to glance at his previ-
ous history. Benjamin Franklin was born at Boston, J anu-

ary 17th, 1706. His father, a manufacturer of soap and

candles, wished to give the young Benjamin a liberal educa-
tion with the View of preparing him for the ministry; but his
means failed, and he took his son, at the age of ten, into his
own establishment, where he employed him in cutting wicks
and filling candle-moulds. An ardent thirst for knowledge led

our hero to spend every leisure moment in reading, and even A

to rob himself of sleep that he might con such volumes oftrave

els and history as fell in his way.’ At twelve, he was appren-
ticed to an elder brother, to learn the art of printing ; but,
aggrieved by the harsh treatment of _ the latter, he resolved
to leave his native city without the knowledge of his friends,
and try his fortune among strangers. The sale of his little
stock of books furnished him with the means of travelling.
His ﬁrst stopping-place was New York. Here there was no
encouragement to remain, and he continued his journey to
Philadelphia, which he reached with a single dollar in his
pocket. Refreshing himself with a penny roll and a draught
of water from the Delaware, his ﬁrst care was to seek em-
ployment. ’ '

Our oun adventurer now seventeen succeeded in et-'
7 9 . g

ting a situation in one of the two printing-oﬂices in Philadel-
phia, and from this time steadily and rapidly advanced. He
perfected his knowledge of printing, and learned much of
the world, by a residence of eighteen months in London;
after which he returned to Philadelphia, gained many new

friends, and set up a printing-ofﬁce of his own. We ﬁnd

him every succeeding year extending his inﬂuence and trying
to disseminate information among the people. A He founded
the ﬁrst circulating library in America, about 1730-. In 1782,
he commenced his celebrated ‘-‘ Poor Ptichard’s Almanac”,
which he continued for twenty-ﬁve years. In 1736, he origin.
nated the American Philosophical Society, and became clerk
of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania.

The fame of Franklin was not conﬁned to America. His.

discoveries in electricity gained him the highest respect
among the scientiﬁc men of Europe. He introduced various
improvements in the Leyden jar, and was the. ﬁrst to mag-
netize steel needles and ﬁre gunpowder by electricity. A
series of observations led him to believe that thunder and

lightning were nothing more than the report and spark of a
grand electr-ic discharge from cloud to cloud. Experiment

only could determine Whether he was right. He had often"

‘amused himself in childhood with paper kites; he now made
one of silk and resolved to raise it to the clouds. If the ﬂuid
passed down the string to his ﬁngers, his theory would be
correct; if not, the speculations of years were groundless.
.With his son, to whom alone he intrusted his secret, he
went out into the ﬁelds, in June, 1752, to try the experi-
ment. The kitelwas raised, and as it reached a threatening
cloud the philosopher with anxiety awaited the result. There
was no sensation. Another cloud came. Franklin present-

ed his knuckle, and to his unspeakable joy received a spark.
1 When the string Was wet, the electric ﬂuid gathered in abun-

dance." His theory was thus established beyond doubt or
cavil. The news created a great sensation throughout Eu-

rope, and the name of Franklin was everywhere spoken with

admiration. The lightning-rod was the immediate result of

this discovery; and who can calculate the disasters this sim-

ple instrument has averted? The poet Barlow did not ex-
aggerate the achievements of Franklin, when he said,

“ See the descending streams around him burn,
Glance on his rod, and with his guidance turn!
He bids conflicting heavens their blasts expire,
Curbs the ﬁerce blaze, and holds the imprisoned ﬁre.”

colonies, and early in 1755 sent over General Brad’-dock
and a detachment from the army in Ireland, for that pur-
pose. Four expeditions were planned; the most important
of which, that against the French in the Ohio valley, the
commander-in-chief undertook in person. Fort Du Quesne
was the ﬁrst post to be reduced; thence he would direct his
victorious arms against Niagara and Frontenac. Conceited
and obstinate as he was brave, Braddock would listen to no
Warnings of danger from Indian ambuscades. The savages
might be formidable, he said, to raw American militia, but
could ‘make no impression on the king’s regulars. Fort
Cumberland, at Will’s Creek [see Map, p. 158], was soon
reached; and here Washington joined the army as aid-de-
camp [az'd’ 6 ,7ccwmg’] to the general. Horatio Gates also
arrived with two companies from New York. The whole
force now amounted to over 2,000 men. A detachment was
sent forward to open the roads, and early in J une, 1755, the
commander-in-chief started with the main body. A march
of 130 miles was before them, and they advanced but slowly,
levelling the hills and bridging the streams that lay in their
path. The French commandant at the fort received tidings

of Braddock’s ‘advance, and would have retreated had it not "

been for the urgent advice of a single officer.

238. On the 9th of July, the English army was within
seven miles of Fort Du Quesne, moving in perfectmilitary
order along the bank of the Mo-non-gaéhe’-la. Washington
declares that he never saw any thing more imposing than
the march of the army on that bright summer morning. All
were dressed in full uniform; their polished arms glanced in

r the sun-light ; every movement was made with perfect pre-

cision; and the full strains of martial music, startling the

on tl1e solitude of the forest. The road led up a gradual
ascent; and near it, on each side, was a ravine ten feet deep,

. concealed by thick woods and underbrush. The army moved

slowly forward through a path about twelve feet wide. In
front was a detachment of 350 men under Lieutenant-colonel
Gage ‘(afterwards General), and a working body 250 strong.

-Braddock was behind with the main body.

Twice had the French proposed to the Indians to attack
the invading army on its march, and twice had they refused.
The commandant was in despair, but one of his officers made
a ﬁnal effort. “ I shall go,” saidhe to the chiefs, “and will
you suffer your father to go alone?” The Red Men were at
last persuaded, and early that same morning on which their
enemies were deploying, in military splendor on the bank of

the Monongahela, a body of 230 Frenchmen and 637 Indians .

started from the fort, both full of conﬁdence, and the latter
declaring that they would shoot down all the English like a
single pigeon. T

239. The two ravines described above, after running

‘parallel with the road for some distance, converged till they

met, and at this point the French encountered the advanced

guard of the English. Commencing the attack without de-

lay, they extended their lines down the ravines, and thus
commanded both ﬂanks of the enemy. Had Colonel Gage
promptly sent aid to the division ﬁrst attacked, and repelled
the foe in front, the -issue of the battle might have been dif-
ferent; but, while he hesitated, the critical moment passed.
The advanced body and ﬂank guards were simultaneously

, driven back, and fell in confusion on a regiment that had just

come up and was endeavoring toform. The appalling war-
whoop was heard on r_ight and left; and the well trained
troops of Britain, who had‘ seen much service elsewhere but
none like this, beheld with consternation their brave men
fall thick and fast by shots from an invisible foe. In vain

they returned the ﬁre, at trees and rocks. ‘In vain their
gallant ofﬁcers exhorted them to follow, and clear the adja-

cent ravines and hills of the lurking enemy. The bewildered .

men would not obey. They ﬁred wildly, and even shot their
own comrades in mistake. T

The Virginia.Rangers alone retained their presence of

mind. Familiar with Indian Warfare, each selected a tree
and fought the savage in his own style. Washington seemed
everywhere present. The other aids had been early disabled,
and he alone was left to transmit the orders of his general to
the different parts of the ﬁeld. Four balls passed through
his coat, and two horses were shot under him. The Indians
singled him out specially for death, but in vain. “Some
mighty Manitoui protects him,” said a disappointed chief,
Who, with his braves, repeatedly covered him with his mus-
ket,——and it was even so.

Braddock had ﬁve horses wounded under him, but was
still too proud to retreat before the savages. At last a mus-.
ket-ball passed through his lungs. As he was placed on a
cart, sinking from loss of blood, he faintly asked Washington,
“What is to be done?” “We must retreat,” was the an-
swer; “the regulars will not ﬁght, and the rangers are nearly

all killed.” The order was given. Frightened, and deaf

alike to commands and threats, the regulars broke from their
ranks and disgracefully ﬂed, leaving their stores and artillery,
and even the private papers of their general, in the handsof
the enemy. Never was rout more disastrous. On the side
of the English, 26 oﬂicers fell and 37 were wounded; the
loss among the privates amounted to 714. The enemy had
only three oﬂicers and 30 men killed, and an equal number
wounded. A ._

the mounds and ancient works whose remains are still visible
in the.valley of the Mississippi, and ultimately to have made
their way to Mexico, and built the city of that name early in
the fourteenth century.

13. The Indians of _A‘inerica must have sprung from later
bodies of Asiatic adventurers than the Mexicans. Behring’s
Strait, or the ocean near it, may often have been crossed du-
ring the lapse of ages; and, judging from the diiference of
character and language in the various tribes, it is highly
probable that the passage was made a number of times at
different eras. Curious aboriginal remains are still to be
seen in various parts of our country, which show that the
ﬁrst settlers arrived there at a very early period, before they
had forgotten the mechanical arts through the allurements
of forest life. They were probably followed by less civilized
bands, who drove them from their original seats. Thus suc-
cessive immigrations may have taken place, each party of
new-comers pushing its predecessors further east and south,
and being themselves afterwards driven in these directions,
until the whole continent was peopled.

14. The traditions current among the Indians throw but
little light on their origin. They have a general belief that
they are aborigines, or, in other words, that they sprung from
the earth and are not connected with any other people. By
one account they are represented as having climbed up the
roots of a large vine from the interior of the globe. V Accord-
ing to another, their ancestors, while living as they had
done for ages under ground, accidentally espied the light of

day through the opening of a cavern, and by dint of great

efforts scaled the walls of their subterranean prison and came
out upon the surface.

tion of having crossed a tract of water to reach their present
habitations. The.Ath-a-pas'—cas, who bear a? striking resem-

in complete disorder, and ﬁlledthe garrison with conster-
nation. Dunbar, who was in command of the camp, de-
stroyed the remaining stores and artillery, worth not less
than £100,000, to facilitate the evacuation of the place.
Braddock died the fourth day after his defeat. The destruc-
tion of an army from which so much had been expected ex-
cited universal horror throughout America. Attempts to
raise new forces for the defence of the border met, for a
time, with little success. The French and Indians ravaged
the Virginia frontier, and escaped beyond the mountains
before the colony had recovered from its alarm.

241. The expedition against Niagara under Gov. Shir’-ley,
of Massachusetts, accomplished nothing- Braddock was to
have aided in this enterprise, and the news of his defeat,
added to a series of obstacles, disheartened the army. They
advanced no further than Oswego, at the southeastern ex-
tremity of Lake Ontario. After rebuilding the fort at this
place and garrisoning it with 700 men, Shirley returned to
Massachusetts (Oct. 24, 1755).

242.. The third expedition, directed "against the French
fort at Crown Point, had been intrusted to Williain J ohnson.

With 3,400 men, mostly New England militia, Johnson ad-'

vanced to the southern shore of the beautiful sheet called
by the Indians Her’-i-con, by the French St. Sacrament
[sang sac-re-mong’], and named by him, after his king, Lake
George’. Here he waited for stores and artillery, apparently
in no hurry to prosecute the enterprise. Meanwhile the
brave Dieskau [dc-es-00”] was descending Lake Champlain,-
with about 1,400 Canadians and Indians, for the purpose of
striking an unexpected blow. He intended to surprise Fort

Edward, which had been recently erected, but, misled by his '

guides, found himself on the way to J ohnson’s encampment.

garrisoned this post with 600 men, and disbanded the rest of

243. The fourth expedition projected by Braddock had in
view the extension of the British possessions on the north-
east, and was undertaken by the people of Massachusetts.
In May, 1755, a strong force sailed from Boston against the
French forts near the Bay of Fundy. These were speedily
taken, and their reduction was followed by the subjugation

session of the British for some’ years. It was called A-ca’-
di-a, and was inhabited chieﬂy by a simple and happy race
descended from the original French settlers, few English col-
onists having found their way to this northern region. Left
to themselves, the Acadians had prospered greatly, and Were
now in possession of ﬁne farms and abundant ﬂocks. Cov-
eting these, the British authorities, made secure by the con-
quest of New Brunswick, proceeded to deprive the inhabit-
ants of the fruits of their frugality and industry. The
Acadians were cruelly ordered to leave the province. Seven
thousand of them were driven on board of ships, and taken
to the southern colonies. Wherever‘ they went they were
maltreated and oppressed. “ Iknow not”, says Bancroft, “if
the annals of the human race keep the record of sorrows so
wantonly inﬂicted, so bitter and perennial, as fell upon the
French inhabitants of Acadia.”

arrived shortly before, but he attempted nothing for the re-
lief of Oswego. The season having been wasted, it soon
became necessary to provide winter-quarters for his troops ;
and the colonists, to their chagrin, found themselves obliged
to support thousands of British soldiers who had not as yet
struck a blow in their behalf.

1757-1758.

245. DURING the winter of 1756-57, Fort Wﬂliam Henry
was occupied by a band of hardy American rangers, who
deﬁed cold and storms. Among them was John Stark, aftere
wards a successful general in the Revolution. With the aid
of skates and snow-shoes, several expeditions were under-
taken against the enemy. An army of 1,500 French and
Indians from Canada, with dogs to draw their sleighs, and
bear-skins for their only protection at night, marched 180
miles for the purpose of surprising the fort, but found the
vigilant garrison on their guard, and returned as they
came. 7

246, In January, 1757, the northern governors met at
Boston, and determined to raise 4,000 men. Meanwhile
Loudoun complained to the ministry at home that the colo-
nies would not tax themselves, and that he could not coerce
them. This was untrue. The colonies were Willing to be
taxed, but wanted, as was natural, to spend the money them-

In June, 1757, Loudoun went to Halifax, and collected
there an army of 10,000 men. 7 He spent most of the sum~
mer in drilling them, and then was deterred from attacking
Louisburg, as he had intended, by the intelligence that the
French ﬂeet contained one more ship than his own. He
soon left his parade-ground, and 1'etr.rned to New York.

247. While the English commander was thus triﬂing, the
governor of Canada was drawing the Iroquois and other
northern Indians into an alliance. A grand army of French
and savages, with Montcalm at its head, advancedtowards
the forts on the English frontier. Several minor successes
were gained, and the Indians, always desirous of making
good their escape when they have struck a blow, were eager
to return. Montcalm remonstrated with them," and, produ-
cing the great warabelt of 6,000 shells, which bound them to
remain till the expedition was completed, declared that his
great object, the reduction of Fort William Henry, was still
unaccomplished. The Red Men were at last persuaded;
and on the 2d of August, 1757, 6,000 Frenchmen and 1,700
Indians invested the fort. It was defended by the intrepid
Col. Monro, with 2,200 men.

To Montcalm’s summons to surrender, Monro returned
an answer of deﬁance, hoping for aid from Gen. Webb, who
lay encamped at Fort Edward, only 14 miles off", with 4,000
men. Instead of advancing to the rescue, Webb wrote
Monro a letter advising him to surrender. Still the gallant
veteran held out, till his ammunition was nearly exhausted,
and half his guns had burst. He then felt it his duty to
capitulate on the honorable terms proposed by the French
commander. One of the conditions was a safe escort to Fort
Edward. But, when the retreat commenced, the faithless
Indians, incited by the hope of plunder, fell on the ille-fated

English. Despite the eiforts of Montcalm and his oﬁicers, a
general massacre ensued. Only a part of the army reached
"Fort Edward in safety. Webb, as long as he was secure in
his camp, cared little for the honor of his country or the
safety of his comrades. Loudoun proposed ﬁxing his quar-=
ters on Long Island, and thought that would be a suﬁicient
defence for the continent. At the close of 17 5 7, the French
possessions in America exceeded in extent those of the Eng-
iish as twenty to one.

248. In the summer of 17 5 7, the weakness of the English
ministry had become apparent, and Pitt, a man of the peo»
ple. and the wisest of modern statesmen. was intrusted with
the management of aﬂhirs. America was his first care. The
imbecile Loudoun was recalled. The colonies were request=
ed to raise troops, with the promise that the expense would
be refunded ;. and their oﬁicers were allowed the same rank
as British officers of their respective grades. New life was
infused into every branch of the service. The American
people had the highest conﬁdence in Pitt, and new armies
were soon enlisted. .

Three expeditions were projected by the English. Am-
herst and Wolfe were to besiege Louisburg; Lord Howe
and Ab-er-crom'—bie, to attack Crown Point and Ticondero~
ga ; and Gem Forbes was to advance upon Fort Du Quesne
and the Ohio Valley.

On the 5th of July, 1758, 9,000 provincial troops and 6,000 0

British regulars embarked in a thousand boats on the shore
of Lake George, for the strong French fort at Ticonderoga,
held by Montcalm with about 3,600 men. The young and
popular Howe was unfortunately killed in an encounter with
a party of French just as he reached the scene of action, and
the sole command thus devolved on the incompetent Aber»
crombie. An attack on the French lines was unwisely or»
dered before the artillery had been brought into action. It
was conducted with unsurpassed intrepidity, but as bravely
repulsed by Montcalm, who had every advantage of position.
The English army lost nearly 2,000 in killed and Wounded ;
and Abercrombie, who had taken care to keep out of danger
during the assault, retreated to the head of the lake, and
sent hi_s artillery and stores to Albany. Nothing was effect-
ed during the remainder of the campaign but the capture

and destruction of Fort Frontenac and some armed vessels

on Lake Ontario, by a detachment under Gen. Bradstreet.
251. The third expedition owed its success solely to Wash~
ington. Contrary to his advice, General Forbes, instead of
following Braddock’s route, commenced a new road to Fort
Du Quesne. His progress was slow, and 300 of his men
were cut off by an ambuscade. On this, it was resolved to
abandon the expedition for the season; but Washington,
having satisﬁed himself of the weakness of the fort by the
accounts of deserters, obtained the general’s permission to
proceed against it alone with his Virginia Rangers. The
French, on his approach, set ﬁre to the works, and ﬂed down
the Ohio. Washington raised his country’s flag over the

smoking ruins (Nov. 25, 1758), and changed the name of the a

place to Pittsburg, i11 honor of the great Pitt. Intrusting
its defence to a company of his rangers, he returned to his

252. ALIVE to the importance of prosecuting the war in
the new world with vigor, Pitt zealously prepared for the
campaign of 1759. A well-digested plan of operations was
arranged, which there seemed little prospe'ct that Montcalm,
left unsupported by the French government, his province
already exhausted of men and resources, could successfully
‘oppose. Gen. Stanwix was ordered to reduce the country
between Pittsburg and Lake Erie; Prideaux [gore-0Z0’], to
take Niagara. Ticonderoga was assigned to Gen. Amherst;
and Wolfe [wooéf] was to attack Quebec. The ﬁrst two of
these expeditions were successful, though at the siege of Ni-»
agara Prideaux was killed. On the approach of Amherst,
the French abandoned Ticonderoga and descended Lake
Champlain. It was expected that the commander would
then march to the north and aid in reducing Canada; but,
delaying, unnecessarily, he left this diﬂicult enterprise en-
tirely to the intrepid Wolfe. 1‘ A

253. The strength of Quebec was well known, and a
powerful armament assembled at Louisburg for its attack.

and ammunition, reached the Isle of Orleans, opposite Que»

bec, on the 26th of June, 1759 [see Map, p. 216]. Opposed
to this powerful array was the renowned Montcalm, in a
fortress deemed impregnable, with a force superior in num-
ber to‘ the English, though no match for them in spirit or
discipline.

After reconnoitring the harbor, and erecting a battery at
Point Levi, opposite the city, which destroyed the lower
town, though unable to reach the citadel, Wolfe chose and
fortiﬁed a position on the east bank of the Montmorenci
[mom-mo-rem’-Se]. A continuous ledge of rocks, defended
by batteries on every side, guarded Montcalm’s intrench-
ments. The only practicable point of attack appeared to be
the French camp on the opposite side of the Montmorenci.
A violent assault was made, but the English were repulsed
with the loss of 400 men. A

The months of July and August passed, and still nothing
Was accomplished. Left unsupported through the culpable
inactivity of Amherst, Wolfe found his most strenuous efforts
baffled by the strength of the fortress and the vigilance of
its commander. Aware that the eyes of the whole English
people were upon him, and thirsting for military glory, he
resolved that the season should not pass without a decisive
conflict. Three desperate plans of assault he submitted to

his council of oﬂicers, but all were rejected. As a last re--

sort, it was proposed to effect a landing above the city, and

M by ascending to the Plains of Abraham to force Montcalm

to an engagement. A close inspection of the side of the
cliff revealed a narrow path, which seemed, from the tents
on the top, to be guarded by no more than a hundred men.
If these could be surprised, the whole army might ascend in
safety. The undertaking was desperate; but there was a

,THE GREAT INDIAN FAMILIES.’

15.. THE various Indian tribes that occupied America on
the ﬁrst arrival of Europeans closely resembled each other in
customs, complexion, and general ‘appearance. There were

minor points of difference, but these were hardly sufficient‘

for grouping ‘them into great families. This could not be
done till theirlanguages were compared; and it was then
found that the numerous tribes east of the Mississippi and

south of the St. Lawrence sprung from eight parent stocks,

Little was then known respecting those west of the Missis-
sippi, nor have we yet suﬁicient acquaintance with them for
a proper classiﬁcation. '

16. These eight great families are known by the following
names: Algonquin [al-zhon’-kwin], Huron-Iroquois [In/-ran
e’-7'0-kwah], Dah-ko’-tah or Sioux [.900], Ca-taw’-ba, Cher-o-
kee’, U’-chee, Nat’-chez, and Mo-bil’-i-an. The Map on
page 10 shows their respective locations in the year 1650, be-:
fore which the interior of the continent was but little known.

dawned, Wolfe and his army, inspirited by their success,
stood on the Plains of Abraham. _ ,
254. Montcalm could hardly believe the tidings, yet has-
tened to meet the enemy, summoning to his support the de-
tachments stationed at different points to guard the heights.
He had but 2,000. regulars; the rest of his army consisted of
brave but inexperienced Canadians. The French general
began the attack. His charge was gallantly received by the
English, who reserved their ﬁre till his men were within 40
yards. Before their deadly discharge, the undisciplined
Canadians gave way in confusion, and all Montcalm’s efforts
could not rally them. At this critical point, Wolfe decided
the fortune of the day by a well-timed charge with the bay-
onet. The French on all sides ﬂed. At the moment of vic—
tory, Wolfe, already twice wounded, received a third ball in
his breast. An officer stood near. “Support me,” cried
Wolfe, “ let not my brave fellows see me drop.” He was
carried to the rear; it was plain that his last hour had come.
“They run! they run I” exclaimed the officer who support-
ed him. “Who run?” asked VVolfe, awaking from the leth-
argy of death. “ The French—they give way everywhere.”
The spirit of the hero was roused as he gave his last com-
mands; then sinking back, he exclaimed, “Now, God be
praised, I die happy!” And so he perished, having gained
the proudest victory yet won by English arms‘ in the new
world. i
Montcalm, who had conducted himself with equal gallan-
try, met with a fate hardly less glorious. Everywhere present
in the thickest of the ﬁght, he did all that mortal could do to
redeem the day; but for once fortune deserted him. Twice
he was wounded, the last time mortally. “Death is certain,”
said the surgeon, “you have but ten or twelve hours to
live.” “I am glad to hear it,” gasped Montcalm; “I shall
not live to see the surrender of Quebec.” He died the

his clemency towards the
French prisoners. A mon-=
ument raised by the Eng-

scribed with the names

the scene of this great
battle.

255. Montcalm in his
last hours suggested to
his successor the concen-
tration of the French forces and a vigorous attack on the
English before they -should intrenoh themselves. But
h-e left behind him no one able or willing to make the at-
tempt. On the 17th of September, Quebec surrendered.
The news was received with exultation throughout England

and America. The remains of the French army assembled

at Montreal. Early in the following year they attempted to
recapture Quebec; but, after gaining some advantages, they
were obliged to retire before a British ﬂeet sent by Pitt to
the relief of the city.

256. On the 7th of September, 1760, Amherst, having
united his forces to complete the reduction of New France,
appeared before Montreal. The oﬂicer in command imme-
diately surrendered net only the city itself, but the whole of
Canada, together with Detroit and Mackinaw.

I Carolina. By unjustly imprisoning some of their chiefs, who

had come at his own invitation to explain misunderstandings
and ratify a ﬁrmer friendship, he excited the indignation of
the outraged Red Men, and brought on an Indian war with
all its horrors.

In April, 1760, Colonel Montgomery, with 1,900 men,

among whom were those gallant sons of Carolina, Moultrie

[m0Ze’-try], and Mar’-i-on, was sent against the Cherokees.
After pillaging and burning a number of their villages,
Montgomery was led into an ambuscade, by which twenty
of his men were cut oif, and he himself was so alarmed that
he beat a ‘precipitate retreat. Fort Loudoun, a, frontier
stronghold, which was besieged by the Indians but had held
out inthe hope of relief from Montgomery, soon capitulated.
Twenty-threeprivates and four officers were killed, in retali-
ation for a similar number of murders by the English; and
the rest, nearly two hundred in number, were distributed as
slaves among the various tribes.

An anecdote illustrating the strength of Indian friendship
is worthy of relation here. Among the prisoners taken at
Fort Loudoun, was a trader named Stuart, to whom a chief
called Little Carpenter was strongly attached. After giving
all he possessed to ransom his friend and ﬁnding there was
still danger, the faithful Cherokee took Stuart into the woods
as if for_the purpose of hunting, and led him for nine days
through mountain forests till he found Englishmen to whom
he could deliver him in safety.

Montgomery had seen enough of Indian warfare; and,
despite the remonstrances of the Carolinians, he set sail for
the nor_th,and thence for England. He afterwards had a
seat in Parliament, where he showed himself an enemy to
b0th‘liberty and America.

CHAPTER XXXIV.
PoNT1Ac’s WAR.

258. ENGLAND and France, having exhausted their re»
sources, concluded a peace at Paris, February 10, 1768.
England had lost thousands of brave men and added
£50,000,000 to her national debt; but she had gained much
in the new world. Nearly the whole of North America was
now in her possession. Her sway extended from the frozen
north to Florida, and from’ ocean to ocean. ,

25 9. When the English began to follow up their victories
in Canada by taking possession of the French posts in the
west, the Indians regarded them with aversion and alarm.
These feelings were heightened by the injustice and contempt
with which they were too often treated. At last Pontiac, a
brave and eloquent Ottawa, Who, with his northern braves,
had contributed to the defeat of Braddock, effected in,,1'i‘7 63
a union between his own people, the Chippeways, Miamis,
Shawnees, Delawares, and other tribes, for the extermination
of the English throughout the whole western country. The
plot was kept secret, and no suspicion of danger was enter-
tained. Trader, farmer, and soldier had alike laid aside their
arms, in the fond belief that war had ceased. Their security
proved fatal. Prowling savages gathered round the forts and
settlements. A simultaneous attack was made, and nine
British garrisons were surprised in a single day. More than
a hundred traders were massacred, and 20,000 persons in
western Virginia were driven from their homes by fear of
the scalping-knife. ‘

exciting game of ball, while the garrison lounged about wit-

nessing the sport. Suddenly the commander was seized; a
rush was made for the fort, where hatchets and other weap-
ons had been concealed by treacherous squaws, and in an
instant seventeen persons were cut down. The rest were
made prisoners. The French traders alone escaped.‘ Pitts-
burg was besieged, but saved by the timely arrival of aid.
261. Pontiac undertook the capture of Detroit in person.
At this spot a ﬂourishing settlement had grown up, consist-
ing chieﬂy of French families occupied in tilling the ground
a11d trading with the surrounding Indians. To obtain en-

trance into the fort for himself and his warriors, the Ottawa’

chief suggested a council for “brightening the chain of
friendship”. Unsuspicious of treason, Major Grladwin, the
commandant, agreed to his proposal. At a given signal the
chiefs were to fall o11 him and hisiattendants, while a general
attack was to be made by their confederates on such of the
towns-people as might resist. Fortunately, the night before
the intended massacre, an Indian woman brought Gladwin a
pair of elk-skin moccasins, which she had made for him.
Pleased with their appearance, the major ordered another
pair; but the Woman Was unwilling to deceive him by prom-
ising what she supposed could not be performed. Her hesi-
tation attracted attention, and, on being questioned, she dis-
closed the plot. Accordingly, at the council Grladwin and
his men were on their guard. Pontiac saw that his intended
treachery was known, and dared not give the signal. He
was allowed to depart with an indignant rebuke from the
commander; and the next day but "one (May 9, 1763), he
returned the favor by laying siege to the fort.

For months the garrison suffered. Their provisions ran
out, and their sentinels were in constant danger of being
cut off by Indian cunning. It is said that the savages
boiled and ate some of their victims. No quarter was
shown on either side. But the Indians were unused to the

labor involved in a siege, and before the close of the summer
Pontiac found his forces diminishing. Jealousies broke out
among the different nations, and ﬁnally the desertion of all
but his own tribe compelled the great emperor of the west
to give up the undertaking. He had shown extraordinary
ability in the management of the war, and had even estab-
lished a bank,——the ﬁrst known among the aborigines. His
notes, which were always punctually paid, consisted of pieces
of bark containing the ﬁgure of what he wanted to buy, and
the picture of an otter, which he had adopted as his hiero-
glyphic signature. N 0 Chief before him had possessed such
inﬂuence with the western tribes or succeeded so well in se-
curing their united action.

262. The Indians were now for the most part tired of war,
and willingly listened to the proposals of General Bradstreet,
who ‘had been sent to the west with 1,100 men, to attack
them or treat with them, as might be required. In June,
1764, he made a treaty with twenty-two tribes at Niagara.
The following August he reached Detroit, and concluded a
peace with all the hostile nations except the Delawares and
Shawnees. Pontiac, to avoid signing the treaty, retired to
the hunting-grounds of the Illinois. There he attempted to
raise another Confederacy for the same purpose as before.
He was at last stabbed at a council, amid a crowd of chief-
tains whom he was trying to excite to war, by a Peoria In-
dian in the interest of the English.

CHAPTER XXXV.

STATE OF SOCIETY IN THE COLONIES.

263. THE English colonies in America were originally con-
ﬁned to the region east of the Alleghanies. At the close of
the “French and Indian Wa1"’, a few adventurous pioneers
pushed across the mountains and commenced settling in the
rich valleys of the great western. rivers. Educated in the
school of hardship and accustomed to rely upon themselves,
they were well ﬁtted to struggle With the difficulties encoun-
tered in the wilderness, and to make it blossom like the rose.
Active, enterprising, and industrious, they were not long in
spreading out over the fruitful region whose vast extent and
exhaustless resources were even yet hardly appreciated. ,

The whole population of the thirteen colonies in 1760 is
estimated at 1,700,000. Massachusetts and Pennsylvania
were the most populous. There were nearly 300,000 negroes
in the colonies. They were for the most part slaves, and
were distributed about as follows: in New England, 15,000;
in the Middle Colonies, 80,000; in the Southern Colonies,
210,000. .

264.‘ The most populous cities in America at this time were
Boston and Philadelphia, each of which, in 1753, contained
not far from 18,000 inhabitants. The population of New
York was about 12,000. The ﬁrst church in the latter city
had been erected by the Dutch inside of the fort. Trinity
Church was built in 1696 on its present site. The houses
were not numbered before the Revolution. The price of
articles of food was regulated by law, that of beef being ﬁxed
at 4% pence a pound. The great coal mines of America had

Albany was occupied by the descendants of old Dutch
settlers, who were noted for their hospitality. A Swedish
traveller tells us that the people had seats on the stoops of
their dwellings, which in the evening were ﬁlled with young
people, and that passers by were “obliged to greet every--
body unless they wou the politeness of this town”.

265. Previous to the Revolution, nine colleges had been
established in the colonies, in the following order : Harvard,
Wﬂliam and Mary, Yale, Princeton, Columbia (originally
called King’s), Brown, Rutgers (then Queen’s), Dartmouth,
Harnpden and Sydney. The ﬁrst Inedical college was founded
at Philadelphia in 1764. The young people of these early times
were far from having the educational advantages enjoyed at
the present day. There were no public schools, and often
in large districts no schools of any kind for the greater part

of the year. Public libraries were almost unknown. There _

was a small collection of books in the City Hall of New York,
which were lent out to readers at 4% pence a week. In 1754,
a subscription was started, which resulted in the establish-
ment of the New York Society Library.

In 1Z_Q_Q, there were but four printing—presses in the colo-

,,nies. The ﬁrst American newspaper, the Boston News Let-

ter, was issued in 1704. In 1741, Franklin published the
ﬁrst magazine, at Philadelphia. In.1750, there Were only
seven newspapers in circulation, and no daily was attempted
till 42 years afterwards, when the Federal Orrery was com-
menced at Boston. Few books were published before the
Revolution, and these were principally histories, religious
treatises, or political‘ essays. No great poem or work of ﬁc-
tion had yet been produced in America.

266. Manufactures at an early period engaged the atten-
tion of the colonists, especially at the north. What they
needed for their own comfort was readily supplied, and they
soon commenced producing different articles for export.
Iron, hides, leather, and hats, were sent _over to the old world,
with considerable proﬁt, till the government, fearing the ef-
fect of this competition on manufacturing industry at home,
discouraged their exportation. This was the case particu-
larly with hats, which the people of New England produced
in such quantities, that we are told, if not restrained, they
would soon have supplied the world with them.

With equal disregard for the interests of the colonies, the
British government had sought to stifle with various restric-
tions the spirit of commercial enterprise in America. A
brisk coast trade, however, was carried on. The ﬁsheries
were not neglected; and the bold seamen of New England

had even. vied with the Dutch in pushing out into the frozen
seas of the north in search of whales. At ﬁrst they conﬁned
their efforts to the smaller kinds; but in 1712, one of the
adventurous whalemen of Nantucket met, far out at sea, one
of the largest species, and after a terrible battle succeeded
in bringing it into port. Thus was a new impulse given to
the whale ﬁshery in New England.

267. Agriculture, however, was the main reliance of the
great body of the people. The richness of theprimeval soil
well repaid the husbandman for his labor. Maize, tobacco,
and the potato were extensively cultivated in the sunny ﬁelds
of Virginia and the adjacent colonies. Rice and indigo were
raised abundantly in South Carolina. Cotton received atten-
tion in the south, and began to be spun and woven. Fifteen
years before the Revolution, the wife of Washington kept
sixteen spinning-wheels running, and wore the fabrics made
in her house under her own direction. The people of North
Carolina lived in ease and plenty, relying much on hunting
and ﬁshing. Maize, tar, and turpentine were the principal
products of their domain. In the north, foreign as well as
native grains and vegetables were everywhere raised. Bar-
ley was cultivated in New England from the time of its ﬁrst
settlement. Grosnold sowed it in Martha’s Vineyard in 1602.

268. Travelling facilities at the time we are speaking of
were exceedingly limited. Railroads, steamboats, and even
stage-coaches were unknown. Passengers were conveyed
from point to point on the coast in small sloops navigated by
a man and a boy. They engaged to run from New York to
Philadelphia in three days, unless in passing through the
Narrows they were driven too far out to sea, in which case
the voyage might take a week or more. New Jersey was
crossed by land in wagons, which started twice a week from

CHAPTER XXXVI.

CAUSES OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION.

269. THE people of America were descendants of men who
had ﬂed from oppression, and braved the hardships of the
wilderness for the blessings of civil and religious liberty.
They had endured incredible sufferings, and through their
own unaided industry had at last prospered and grown
strong. When poor and feeble, they had been neglected
by the mother country ; as soon as they became worth gov-
erning, Britain had sent them governors ; and now that they
were growing rich, she sought to increase her revenue by
taxing them. A pretext was not wantinox Heavy expenses
had been incurred by the home government for the protec-
tion of the colonies in the French and Indian war; and these,
it was claimed, should be reimbursed. The commanders

' sent over had been generally incompetent, and much of their

success was due to the colonial troops and oﬂicers who served
under them ; yet the Americans would not have objected to
contributing their share, had they been allowed a voice in
laying the tax or directing how it should be -appropriated.
Having no representatives in Parliament, however, they

adelphia? Give an account of the diﬁerent lines that ran across New Jersey. When

269. From whom were the people of America descended? How were they treated
by the mother country? Whzxt pretext was assigned for taxing them? Why did the
Americans object to contributing their share of the expense? How had the ministers

1760] WRITS or ASSISTANCE. 189

claimed that Parliament had no right to tax them. The
ministers of George II. had not only asserted the right, but
exercised it by laying duties on Various imported articles.
The question was freely. discussed throughout America,‘ and
everywhere a unanimous voice" rose from the people that
taxation without representation was unjust and intolerable.
The law imposing the obnoxious duties was declared uncon-
stitutional and oppressive. In New England it was con-
stantly evaded by secretly conveying the taxable articles
ashore and concealing them from the collectors. To put a
stop to this practice, on the accession of George III. in 1760,
edicts were issued commanding all sheriffs and constables? to
aid the collectors, when called upon, in breaking open and
searching cellars, houses, or vessels, that were suspected oi:
containing concealed goods.

Salem was the first place at which it was-attempted to
enforce this law. The inhabitants denied the right of oﬁ‘i-
cers to force their dwellings, and the Supreme Court directed
that the question should be argued at Boston. The people
were represented by James O’-tis, an eloquent and able law-
yer, who had been Advocate-general for the crown, but re-
signed his office rather than enforce an unconstitutional law.
Otis’ speech on this question produced a thrilling effect on
the vast concourse that heard it. It was the ablest defence
of popular rights yet put forth, and conﬁrmed the patriots
of Massachusetts in their resolution to resist even by force of
arms.

270. At the south, too, the same spirit was rife. In Vir-
ginia, the Ohurch of England was established by law, and
its ministers had been voted an annual salary of 16,000 pounds
of tobacco each. In 1758, a year of scarcity, with the view
of relieving the people, it was enacted by the colonial legis-
lature that the salaries of the clergy, as well as other public

of George II. exercised this alleged right? What position was maintained by the colo-

the accession of George III.? Where was the ﬁrst attempt made to enforce this law?

dues, might be paid in cash, each pound of tobacco being

rated at two pence, which was below its real value. The

clergy resisted, and the king refused to sign the act. Sev-
eral years passed, and in 1768 the clergy brought a suit for
damages. The causes of the people was in the hands of Pat-
rick Henry.

This distinguished man was born in Virginia, in 1736. A
lover of nature, he had preferred rural pleasures and solitary
forest rambles to his books, and had grown up with a mind
strong but not cultivated, and an education varied rather
than profound. He had tried mercantile pursuits and farm-.
ing without success, and at last, turning his attention to the
law, was licensed after six weeks’ study. He had reached
the age of twenty—seven without distinction; and now he
stood in the old Hanover court-house, before the most learns
ed of the colony, the triumphant clergy smiling at his awk-

wardness, and many an anxious eye bent on him in the.

crowded audience .

The commencement of his speech made little impression;
but as the young orator warmed with his subject, his eye
lighted up with genius, his ﬁgure became erect, his expres.
sion grand, his action bold, his voice commanding, his words
impassioned, his arguments irresistible. Men looked at each
other in surprise, then fascinated drank in with eyes and ears,
in deathlike silence, the eloquence of the gifted speaker. The
clergy shrank in alarm from his scathing sarcasm; and the
jury, under the spell of his glowing appeals, returned a V81‘-.2
diet of one penny damages. The people shouted with ,de-
light at their unexpected triumph, and bore their gallant
champion from the court-house on their shoulders.

271. Meanwhile the British ministry, no longer guided by
the liberal councils of Pitt, pushed through Parliainent a
bill, which laid an impost on wines, increased the duty on
sugar, and provided for the more rigid enforcement of the

regulations for collecting the revenue. Even before the pas-
sage of this bill was announced, the principle it involved was
condemned in the strongest terms in a town-meeting at
Boston. Samuel Adams, a stout—hearted patriot, who had
already proved that taxation and representation were insep-
arable, protested in the name of the people against th_e.as-
sumption by Parliament of powers fatal_ to liberty and incon-
sistent with the rights to which every Briton was born.

27 2. In 17 65, the famous Stamp Act was passed. It had
long been contemplated by the enemies of America, but no
British statesman up to this time had ventured to urge its
passage. According to its provisions, no deed, bond, note,
lease, contract, or other legal document, was valid, without
a stamp, costing, according to the nature of the instrument,
from 3 pence to £4. Every newspaper, pamphlet, almanac,
&c., was also required to bear a stamp, costing from a half-
penny to 4 pence; and on each advertisement they contained
a duty of two shillings was imposed. The passage of this act
seemed to sound the knell of freedom in America. “The
sun of liberty is set,” wrote Franklin to Charles Thompson,
the future secretary of Congress; “ the Americans must light
the lamps of industry and economy.” “Be assured,” was
his friend’s answer, “ we shall light torches of a very differc

i ent character.” Such was the general feeling of the colo-

nists———war, rather than submission to injustice.

The House of Burgesses of Virginia was in session when
the news arrived. Odious as the measure was, there was
danger in opposing it, and no one dared to introduce the
subject. Patrick Henry was the youngest member. After
waiting in vain for older men to lead the way, he hastily
drew up 011 the blank leaf of an old law-book ﬁve resolutions,
which in strong terms asserted the rights of the colonies and
denied the authority of Parliament to impose taxes upon
them. The reading of these resolutions produced unbounded

consternation in the House. The Speaker and many of the
members were royalists, and a protracted and violent debate
followed.

But the eloquence of Henry bore down all oppo-

sition. Indignant at the attempt to enthral his country, the
fearless orator, in the midst of an impassioned harangue,

nies, and everywhere excited the same determined spirit
that they breathed. Y . '

Among those who listened to the inspiring words of Pat-
rick Henry on this occasion, was a young Virginian, destined
to play no unimportant part in his country’s history. It was
Thomas Jefferson, then a student twenty-two years old.
Standing in the lobby, he heard the whole discussion. The
words of the eloquent patriot found an abiding echo in his
heart, and awakened there the sentiment which directed all
his T future'conduct———that “resistance to tyrants is obedience
to God”.

273. The indignation of the people at the passage of the
Stamp Act was not conﬁned to Virginia. Similar resolutions
to those of Patrick Henry Were passedin New York, Massa-
chusetts, and elsewhere. Early in October, 1765, delegates
from nine colonies assembled at New York, and drew up a
declaration of their grievances and rights. A petition em-
bodying their views was forwarded -to both king and Par-
liament. ‘ T

The Act was to go into effect on the ﬁrst of-November‘,
and the excitementébecame intense as the day approached.
Those who were appointed to sell the stamps were burned
in efﬁgy, and compelled to resign or quit the country. On

the arrival of stampsat the seaport towns, the ﬂags were

placed atvhalf-mast, muﬂied bells were tolled,and the citizens
walked the streets attired in mourning. In New York, ten
boxes of stamps were destroyed by the people, and the mer-
chants resolved to import nothing from the mother country
till the offensive act was repealed. The. business men of
Philadelphia and Boston followed this example. In the latter
city, a handbill was posted at the corners, warning the person
who should ﬁrst distribute or use stamped sheets to take care
of his property and person.‘ A paper was issued, bearing for

its device a snake, on the head of which were the letters
N. E. [New England], while the body was divided into sevg
eral pieces, markedwith the initials of the other colonies.
The motto, Join or die, explained its meaning. In New
Hampshire, on the morning of the eventful day, the bells
tolled, and. the people assembled as if for a funeral procession.
A coﬂﬁn bearing the name of LIBERTY was borne to a grave
on the shoulders of eight persons, to the sound of minute-—
guns. A funeral oration was pronounced, and the cofﬁn was
lowered into the grave. Suddenly signs of life appeared.
It was raised to the surface, and now bore the inscription
LIBERTY REVIVED. Enthusiastic shouts from the multitude
and the triumphant sound of drums and trumpets greeted
the resurrection.

The meaning of these demonstrations was not to be mise
understood. It was evident that the Stamp Act could be
enforced only by a resort to. arms, and from this Parliament
shrunk. The wiserpart began to urge its repeal, and Frank-
lin, the agent for Pennsylvania, was brought before the House
of Commons (February 13, 1766), and examined on the va-
rious points involved in the controversy. His bold and can-
did answers increased the high reputation he already enjoyed,
and called forth the lasting gratitude of his countrymen. In
March, Parliament gave way to the determined spirit of the
Americans by repealing the odious act, though it reasserted
its right “ to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever”.- :_

274. Harmony might now have been restored, had not the
enemies of America, mortiﬁed at their recent defeat, suc-
ceeded in passing through Parliament an act for imposing a
duty on all tea, glass, paper, and painters’ colors, imported
into the colonies. At the same time, officers were appointed
to enforce the Acts of Navigation and Trade, and the au-=
thority of the Assembly of New York, which had refused to

"This injudicious course again roused the indignation of the
colonists, Which was increased in the fall of 1768 by the an»
nouncement that Parliament had determined to send several
regiments to Boston, to reduce the people to submission. A
day of fasting and prayer Was appointed. Town-meetings

were procured for them, even at the expense of the crown.
When the next General Court met, an armed force was
found stationed in the hall. Otis and others protested
against so tyrannical an attempt to overawe the members;
and, when the governor called on the House to pay for the
quartering of the troops, they ﬁrmly refused to do so.

275. The governors of the colonies at this time were in
the interest of the king, and constantly tried to extend their
authority at the expense of the people; Their subordinates
followed their example, and sought to enrich themselves by
all kinds of extortion. in North Carolina, this was done by
sheriffs, constables, and other oﬁicers, to such an extent, that
the people in some of the southern settlements, unable to
bear the burdens thus unjustly imposed, rose in their own
defence. They assumed the name of Regulators, and deter-
mined to resist the payment of all taxes that Were not au-
thorized bylaw and honestly appropriated. Governor Tryon
chose to regard this movement as an insurrection; and, a
corrupt grand-jury supporting his views, he proceeded against
them with the militia of the colony. The Regulators assem-
bled in alarm when they heard that their ﬁelds were being
devastated by Tryon’s forces; but, lacking arms and ammu-=
nition,-they were easily defeated. A number of the prisoners
were hanged. Some of the best estates in the country were
conﬁscated to the governor and his satellites; and the perse-
cuted Regulators, though convicted of nothing more than a
desire to have existing laws honestly executed, were obliged
to submit or ﬂee to the west. Not a few chose the latter
alternative. The Cherokees granted them land, and they
founded a republic which afterwards became the state of
Tennessee. Tryon soon went to New York, of which he had
been appointed governor, leaving North Carolina to discharge
a debt of $200,000 contracted by his reckless proceedings.

erty, imbibing the spirit of their masters, conducted‘ them-
selves so offensively that difficulties with the inhabitants con-
stantly, occurred. In New York, early in 17 7 0, they cut
down a liberty pole which had stood three years in the Park.
An affray followed, in which the people had the advantage,
and a new pole was erected in the upper part of the city.
In Boston, the excesses of the soldiers, and the injustice of
their ofﬁcers in screening them from punishment, gave the
people just grounds for complaint. A collision between the
troops and the citizens [in March, 1770] was the natural re»
sult. Three of the latter were killed, and several wounded.
This event was called “ the Boston Massacre”. It produced
the deepest excitement and fatally widened the existing
breach. The townsmen, with Samuel Adams at their head,
insisted on the immediate withdrawal of the troops, and their
commander was obliged to remove them to the neighbor-
ing fort. _

An occurrence at Providence also showed the temper of
the times. A royal schooner, the Gaspee, cruising near that
place, kept annoying the inhabitants by taking their prop-
erty, ﬁring at market-boats, and illegally seizing the cargoes
of such vessels as it overhauled. Whﬂe chasing a packet, in
June, 17 7 2, the Graspee ran aground. This opportunity was
not to be lost. The next night, a party from Providence
boarded the stranded vessel, and set ﬁre to it, after putting

the crew ashore. Every effort to punish the perpetrators of

the act failed.

2'7 7. The merchants of America adhered to their resolution
not to import British commodities, and the effect began to be
felt across the Atlantic. An appeal was made to Parliament
by London merchants; and, in 1770, Lord North having
become prime minister, the offensive duty was removed from
every article except tea, on which it was retained, to show
that Parliament still claimed the right. It was against this

To this family belonged the Hurons or Wy’-an-dots, the
E’-ries, and the formidable confederated tribes generally
known as the Five Nations, who were afterwards joined by
the Tus-ca-ro’-ras, a kindred tribe from Carolina. The Iro-
quois proper, or Five Nations, were as distinguished" for
their intelligence as for their superior skill and courage in
war. They displayed greatwisdom in the management of
their domestic affairs, and advanced further in the arts of
Indian life than the rest of their race. Conscious that they
owed their strength to union, they maintained their confed-
eracy with the utmost care, and thus were more than a
match for enemies that met them singly. Their position, as
may be seen from the Map, was highly favorable. Lake
Ontario on the north, and an extensive mountain range on
the southeast, served as bulwarks against their enemies;
while their intercourse with the Dutch settlements kept
them well supplied with arms and ammunition. I

19. The Dahkotahs, or Sioux, a Widely extended family,
lived mostly west of the Mississippi. Hence little was known
about them by early settlers. One Dahkotah tribe, the
Win-ne-ba’-goes, migrated eastward, at what period we are
not informed, and settled on the western coast of Lake
Michigan [mz'sh—e—gan’] among the Algonquins. ‘ The prom-
inent members of the Dahkotah family were the Man’«-dans,
I’-o-was, Mis-sou’-ries, O-sa’-ges, Arkansas [ahﬂkanwsaw],
and Kan’-sas.

20. The Ca-taw’-bas, living in the interior of Carolina,
south of the original seat of the Tuscaroras, were once a
powerful people. Becoming engaged in war with the Iro-
quois, they were vanquished and nearly destroyed. Hardly
a hundred now survive. ,

alleged right, however, and not the tax itself, that the Amer-
icans had contended; and they were by no means satisﬁed
With‘ such tardy and partial concession. The use of tea was
voluntarily laid aside ; and, to insure united action, the
friends of liberty (now known as Wliigs, in contradistinction
to the Tories, or advocates of Parliamentary taxation) estab-
lished committees of correspondence in the various colonies.

No orders being received from America, tea rapidly accu-
mulated in the English warehouses. The duty before laid
on its exportation was now removed, with the view of lower-
ing the price, and thus inducing the colonists to purchase it
in spite of the import tax. Cargoes were sent- to different
American ports, but the result showed that the spirit of the
colonies was not yet understood. At New York and Phila-
delphia, the ships, prevented from landing their cargoes, were
sent back as they came. ‘At Charleston, the tea was stored
in damp cellars, where it was spoiled. At Boston, the cap»
tains would have complied with the demands of the-citizens
and returned to London, but the governor and custom-house
oﬁicers withheld their permission. Finding the authorities
determined to force the tea upon them, the people settled
the question for themselves. Seven thousand men assembled
in town-meeting on the 16th of December, 17 7 3, a day meme
orable in history. Fearless speeches were made by Adams,
Quincy, and others ; at the close of which, an hour after
dark, a war-whoop was raised, and about ﬁfty persons dis-
guised as Indians were seen to pass the door in the direction
of the wharf Where the three tea-ships were moored. The
vessels were boarded; and the contents of 340 chests of tea
were emptied into the water. No resistance was oﬁ"ered,
and all the proceedings were conducted in the most orderly
manner, in the presence of a vast concourse.

As the party were returning, they passed a house at which
Admiral Montague was spending the evening. Raising the

, window, the admiral cried, “ Well, boys, you’ve had a fine

night for your Indian caper. But mind, you’ve got to pay
the ﬁddler yet.” “ Oh! never mind,” replied one of the
leaders, “ never mind, squire ! just come out here, if you
please, and we’ll settle the bill in two minutes!” The ad-
miral preferred letting the bill stand, and quickly shut down
the Window.

278. This bold act provoked Parliament to pass the “ Bos-
ton Port Bill”, which forbade the masters of vessels to take
in or discharge cargoes in that harbor. The Virginia House
of Burgesses was in session when the news of this retaliatory
measure was received; a protest against it was at once en-
tered on their journal. Governor Dunmore, to show his dis-
approval of their action, the next day dissolved the House.
They separated, but only to meet elsewhere and pass strong
resolutions, declaring an attack on one colony an attack on
all, and recommending a general congress for the purpose of
deciding on some common course. Similar resolutions were

‘passed in Massachusetts, and by common consent itwas or-
dered that a congress of delegates from all the colonies should

meet atPhiladelphia in September.
27 9. Meanwhile General Gage (unfavorably known in
connection with Braddock’s defeat) had been appointed gov-

iernor of Massachusetts. His rash measures hastened the

approaching crisis, ’He tried to weaken the cause of free-
dom by buying over Samuel Adams with a high oﬁice. But
this "true-hearted man, justly regarded as the leader of the
patriotic movements in Boston, Whom Jefferson afterwards
pronounced “wise in council, fertile in resources, and im-
movable in his purposes”, was as incorruptible a.s he was
brave. “ I trust,” replied he to Gage’s messenger, “I have
long since made my peace with the King of kings, and no

advice of Samuel Adams to him, no longer to insult the feele-

280. On the 5th of September, 1774, the Continental Con-
gress met at Carpenter’s Hall, Philadelphia. Fifty-three
delegates appeared, the ablest men of America, representing
every colony but Georgia. It was a solemn meeting, for it
involvedfthe destiny of America. Adams was there, and
Washington, Richard ‘Henry Lee,of Virginia, and Patrick
Henry, never deaf to his country’s call. There was but one
voice in the Assembly, one feeling—-—never to submit. 
petition was addressed to _the obstinate king, whose infatu-
ated course was flinging the brightest jewel from his crown;
an appeal was made to the people of Great Britain; but
preparations for the worst were not forgotten.

T 281. Despite the eﬁbrts of Gage, the Assembly of Massa-

chusetts met in October, 17 7 4. John Hancock, a graduate

of Harvard and one of the ablest statesmen of the Revolu-
tion, was elected president. Active preparations were made
for the war, which it now required little sagacity to foresee.
Measures were taken for organizing the militia. Officers
were appointed, and a committee of safety was empowered
to call the citizens together whenever circumstances required.
The people, too, did their part. Therewas no shrinking from
the impending struggle. The anniversary of “ the Boston
massacre” was solemnly celebrated in that city; on which
occasion, Dr. Joseph “Warren, afterwards a martyr to liberty
at Bunker Hill, setting the threats of British ofﬁcials at de-
ﬁance, stirred the deepest sympathies and strongest passions
of an immense audience.

“ N obodysent us,” answered the leader, With ﬂashing eye.
“ We have never injured your troops ; but they have tram-

and told us to help ourselves if We could. We told the cap-
tain, and he laughed at us. Yesterday our Works Were de-
stroyed for the third time, and We Will bear it no longer.”
The British general could not restrain his admiration.‘ “ The

erty With the air they breathe. Go, my brave boys, and be
assured if my troops trouble you again they shall be pun-
ished.”

sembled.‘ Patrick Henry, the great orator of the Revolution,
was a member. Believing war inevitable, he introduced
resolutions providing for the organization of a republican
army, and in their support delivered a memorable speech
whose electrical effect can now hardly be imagined, though

, it will never be read without emotion. “ I know not what

course others may take,” said he, after kindling the spirits of
those who listened with his burning eloquence, “ but for me,
give me liberty or give me death.” S

The struggle was at hand. An appeal to the God of bat-
tles alone was left.

284. Before entering on the history of the contest, it is
necessary to glance at_an important event in the southwest.
The treaty of Paris had transferred Louisiana‘ from France
to Spain, contrary to the wishes of its people. Their re-

pugnance to the change was heightened in 1768 by the ar-

rival of a Spanish governor of haughty manners and arbitrary
principles, who enforced the restrictive system of his country,
to the great injury of their commerce. Attached to the
French crown, and feeling that they ought not to be trans-9
ferred from one king to another without their own consent,
the people of New Orleans, supported by those of the coun»
try parishes, established an independent republic, and the
Spanish governor, unable to exercise his authority, retired to
Havana. The new government lasted not long. General
O’Reilly [m"-lg/], sent over with an army for that purpose,
restored Spanish authority, and the leaders of the liberal
movement expiated their offence in dungeons or on the gal
lows. ‘ i

CHAPTER I.

BATTLE OF LEXINGTON.

285. AN act of Parliament, passed in February, 17 7 5, de-
clared that a rebellion existed in Massachusetts, and that an
additional force should be sent over to Boston. About
3,000 British troops were already there. Boston Neck,
which connected the peninsula on which the rebellious town
was built with the main land, had been fortiﬁed by Gage,
and a line of sentinels stationed there cut off the inhabitants
from communication with the surrounding country. The
patriots, however, had secretly conveyed their cannon, as
well as a quantity of powder and cartridges, out of the city,
concealing them in loads of manure with which they passed
the guard unsuspected. Their principal depot was at Con-
cord, about eighteen miles northwest of Boston. Of this
Gage was aware; and he resolved to send a strong detach-
ment thither, to destroy their stores and secure the persons

of Hancock and'Samuel Adams, whom he supposed to be in

that vicinity. Arrangements were made with’ the greatest
secrecy; and on the 18th of April, 1775, ‘an hour before

204: n BATTLE or LEXINGTON‘. [1775

midnight, 800 men under Lieutenant-colonel Smith set out
for Concord. '
Notwithstanding the precautions of the British general,
the vigilant VVarren had penetrated his designs ; and hardly
had the expedition started when messengers were dispatched

by diﬁerent routes to give the alarm. ‘A lantern was hung C

from an upper window of the North Church, which was seen
by the people of Charlestown, and they also sent trusty men
to alarm the country. ‘Smith had not advanced far before he
heard the sound of musketry and the ringing of bells; and,
apprehending danger, he sent back for reinforcements, and
threw out detachments in advance to secure the bridges.
Before ﬁve the next morning, the British advanced guard,
commanded by Maj or Pitcairn, reached Lexington [see Map,
p. 84], ten miles from Boston, on the Concord road. On
the green, a body of minute-men, hastily gathered and poor-
ly equipped, were ready to receive them. “ Disperse, ye
rebels,” cried the British leader. The Americans stood their
ground: Pitcairn discharged his pistol at them, and ﬁring

‘commenced on both sides. It Was continued till the Amer-

icans gave way, with a-loss of 8 men. The main body now
came up, and the march was resumed for Concord. They
arrived there at seven. The inhabitants had received news
of theintended movement about midnight, and had con-
veyed part of the arms and ammunition to a place of safety.
The rest was destroyed. Meantime a large body of minute-
men had assembled, and a skirmish took place, which result-
ed in the loss of several on both sides, and theretreatof
the British from a bridge which they had seized.

286. The Work of destruction having been completed, the
British began to return. This was the signal for the brave
yeomanry of the surrounding country. Posting themselves

retreating army. Even boys and old men hastened to strike

‘a blow for their country.‘ Thus for miles the British march-

ed, their officers falling and their ranks thinning under a con-
tinuous ﬁre which they were unable to return with eﬁ'ect.
Colonel Smith was severely wounded, and his men, sinking
under fatigue and discouraged by their losses,‘were in dan-
ger of being entirely cut off, when they were met, eleven
miles from Boston, by a timely reinforcement of 1,000 men
under Lord Percy. Received by their comrades in a hollow
square, they threw themselves on the ground, and were al-
lowed a short rest to ﬁt them for the balance of the march.

The patriots, notwithstanding Lord Percy’s ﬁeld-pieces,
continued the pursuit to Charlestown. Here the disastrous
retreat terminated, the British having lost 65 killed, 180
wounded, and 28 taken prisoners. On the opposite side, 59
were killed, 39 Wounded, and 5 missing. The first battle of
the Revolution was fought, and its result was not such as to
discourage the colonists.‘ ‘ '

287. At this early period were commenced those acts of
savage cruelty which too often disgraced the British troops
in the course of the War. Percy allowed his men to plunder
and ﬁre a number of houses on the route. In one of these a
woman was lying sick, and her child had taken refuge under
the bed. The former was barbarously dragged -out of the
house, and one of the marauders, seeing the boy’s foot pro-=
trude, Wantonly pinned it to the floor with his bayonet. ~No

groan escaped the little hero; but the merciless soldiers re-» -

duced the house to ashes and hurried on to other outrages.

CHAPTER II.

CAPTURE OF TICONDEROGrA.--VVASHINGTONA ELECTED COM-
MANDER-IN-CHIEF.

288. IT was felt that the war had begun in earnest, and
20,000 patriots soon assembled‘ in the vicinity of Boston, sure
rounded the city, and threatened to cut off the British army
from provisions. Meanwhile the legislature of Connecticut
resolved to strike a blow. A committee was sent to the
frontier With $1,000, to ﬁt out an expedition against Ticon-
deroga. The command was given to Colonel E’-than Allen,
already distinguished as a. leader of the “Green Mountain
Boys”. The company so called had been organized three
years before, to prevent New York from extending her juris-

diction over the region they occupied, now known as Ver-V

mont. Colonel Allen was assisted by Benedict Arnold, after-
wards a traitor, but then a brave and esteemed patriot. An
army 270 strong was soon collected on the east side of Lake
Champlain [see Map, p. .169], opposite Ticonderoga. It was
intended to cross in the night, but so few boats were at hand
that at daylight on the 10th of May (17 75) only the oﬂicers
and 83 men had landed on the western shore.

Not daring to wait for more, lest he should be discovered
and cut off by the garrison, Allen addressed his little band
and marched directly to the fort. The surprise was com-
plete. As Allen entered the sally-port at the head of his
men, a sentinel snapped his gun at him, and ran to raise the
alarm. The Americans followed, and the garrison were
roused from sleep only to ﬁnd themselves prisoners. Colonel
Allen made his way to the commander’s apartment and or-
dered him to surrender. “By what authority?” demanded

288. What immediately followed the battle of Lexington? What was done by the
legislature of Connecticut? To whom was the command of the expedition against Ti-
conderoga given? As what was Ethan Allen already distinguished? For what had the
company called “the Green Mountain Boys” been organized? By whom was Allen
assisted? ‘How large a force was raised? Where did they rendezvous? What difficulty
did they experience in crossing the lake? What was the consequence? What was
Allen now obliged to do? Give an account of the surprise of the fort. What was sur-

the astonished « oﬁicer. Raising his sword. as if to strike,
Allen replied, “In the name of the great Jehovah and the
Continental Congress.” Resistance was vain, and the British
commander was obliged to surrender the post, together with

48‘men, 122 cannon, several vessels, abundant stores, and a .

large supply of powder, which was much needed in the camp
at Boston. Two days afterwards Crown Point was taken
without resistance. These achievements, performed without
the loss of a single man, greatly encouraged the colonists.
289. The subsequent career of the brave but eccentric

Allen is worthy of relation. In the autumn of 1775, he at-.

tempted the capture of Montreal, but after a, desperate
struggle was -made a prisoner. He was sent to England,
and suffered much on the voyage from being conﬁned with
34 others in a room about 20 feet square. This was all for»
gotten, however, on the return voyage, when an opportunity
for ample revenge occurred. A conspiracy was formed for
killing the captain and taking possession of the vessel, but
Allen, though on his way to a prison-ship and aware of the
suﬁ"erings -in store for him, refused to take part in it. EX-
changed at last for a British officer, he was made commander
of the Vermont militia. The British tried to buy him over,
but in vain. , E
  290. Love of country was the ruling passion in Ethan
Allen’_s breast. ‘His brother favored the British, aiding them
withhis means, and sending them, from time to time such in-
formation as he thought would be of service. When Ethan
ascertained this, he at once laid the fact before the authori-
ties, advising them-to conﬁscate his brother’s property and
apply it to the defence of the country.——His eventful life ter-

mg the fastnesses of the Blue Ridge‘ andthe Alleghanies,
they were the mountaineers of eastern America. In spite
of long and bloody wars with their hereditary foes, the
Shawnees, and other nations, they now constitute one of the
largest, as well as the most civilized and prosperous, Indian
tribes within the limits of the United States. They number
about 15,000 souls, having, unlike most of their race, become
more.numerous since exchanging savage for civilized life.
22. The Uchees, a small tribe little known in history, were
the sixth of the great families. They Were never known to
change their location, and boasted that they were the oldest
inhabitants of the region in which they were found. This
was the northern part of Georgia. Their language was pe-
culiarly harsh and guttural. —
23. On the east bank of the Mississippi, in the neighbor-
hood of the city now called by their name, lived the Natchez;
a tribe said to have been connections of the Mexicans, and to
have possessed at one time an extended dominion. They
probably settled in this locality early in the sixteenth century,
as they retained a tradition of having seen, far in the south-

west where they formerly lived, “ warriors of ﬁre,” by which

name they no doubt designated the soldiers of Cortez. The
Natchez were nearly destroyed by the French in 1730.
From a few survivors, who crossed the Mississippi into
Louisiana, the Ten’-sas Indians are supposed to have sprung.

24. The Mobilian family, otherwise called the Mus-co’-gee»
Choc’-taw, remains to be noticed. This group of tribes ex-»
tended over the region which now forms the southern part of
the United Statesgebeing bounded on the northeast by the

the Tennessee. It included many powerful ‘nations, the most
important of which was the Greek, or Muscogee. Though

whom we have met before listening to the eloquence of
‘Henry, and John Adams, a native of Massachusetts, now in
his fortieth year. Distinguished for his industry and business
habits, Adams was one of the most useful members of the
House. He had constantly opposed the encroachments of
Parliament, yet had shown his independence by defending
the British soldiers concerned in “the Boston Massacre”, on
their trial for that offence.

Though still hoping for concessions from the mother coun-
try, Congress vigorously prepared for war. Bills of credit
were issued to the amount of $3,000,000. The appointment
of a commander-in-chief next engaged attention. John Ad-
ams in a powerful speech set forth the high qualities which
should be possessed by the person selected for this oﬂice, and
concluded by nominating one of their own body, in whom
they were all combined—George Wasliington, of Virginia.-
The House was taken by surprise, for but few had known
the speaker’s intention. No one was more surprised than
Washington himself, who immediately left the room. The
next day, he was unanimously elected.

292. The news of the stand taken at Lexington rapidly 1

spread throughout the country, and was everywhere received
with enthusiasm. In a remote part of Virginia, a tall young
man hastened to bear the news to a company in the woods.
He expressed his feelings in a fervid speech, and they lost no
time in arming for liberty. This youth was John Marshall,
the future chief-justice. Just a month after the battle, the
news reached Charlotte, N. C. The people immediately
met, declared themselves freed from allegiance to the king,
and promised to defend the independence thus asserted with
their lives and fortunes. This was the first proposal to throw
of the British yoke. Their countrymen at the north were

believed themselves entitled. The people of Charlotte were
the ﬁrst to declare in favor of complete independence.

293. The governors of the colonies had received orders to
secure all arms and military stores collected‘ by the people.
According to these instructions, Lord Dunmore, on the 20th
of April, seized on the powder in the magazine at VVilliams—
burg, Va. The people, with Patrick Henry at their head,
demanded restitution, and the governor had to pay for the
powder in full. The amount (about $1,500) was transmitted
to Congress. After fortifying his residence, the mortiﬁed
Dunmore issued a proclamation against Henry and his asso-
ciates. This incensed the people, and some intercepted
letters written by the governor, in which he grossly misrep»
resented the colonists, added to their indignation. J ustly
alarmed for his safety, Dunmore took refuge on board of a
British vessel. About the same time, the governors of North
and South Carolina were obliged to pursue a similar course

17 7 5, to 10,000 men, by reinforcements from England and
Ireland, commanded by Generals Howe, Clinton, and Bur-
goyne. On the 12th of June, Gage issued a proclamation
offering pardon to all who would abandon the cause of the
colonies, except Samuel Adams and John Hancock, who were
declared outlaws.

however, were men Who had seen service. Ar’-te-mas Ward,
of Massachusetts, held the chief comma.nd. On the 16th of
June, it was ascertained that Gren.Gage intended to seize
and fortify Bunker Hill. At nine o’clock at night, Colonel
Prescott was dispatched from Cambridge with a thousand
men to anticipate the movement. Mistaking Breed’s Hill
for Bunker’s in the darkness, they commenced intrenching
themselves on the former eminence, which was nearer to
Boston and more exposed to the Tﬁre of the British ships.
The name of Bunker Hill, however, is universally given to
the engagement-‘that followed. The men worked with the
utmost diligence, and so noiselessly that they were not dis-
covered till dawn, either by the ships, or the British sentinels
on Copp’s Hill, Boston, whose “All’s well!” they distinctly
heard at intervals through the night.  

— The surprise of the British may be imagined, when, at day-
break on the 17th, they beheld a strong intrenchment, six
feet high, commanding their camp. : A strong battery planted
there would force them to evacuate the city. Gage called a
council of war, and it was agreed that the Americans ‘must
be driven from their position. Three thousand veterans were
detached for this duty, under Generals Howe and Pig’-ot.
The Americans ceased working as they saw their enemies
land at Morton’s Point, and hoisted the ﬂag of New Eng-
land. They were but 1,500 in number, deﬁcient in ammu-
nition, exhausted by labor, and suffering from hunger and
thirst; yet they were sustained by an undaunted spirit. Gren-
erals Putnam and Wa1'ren had now joined their ranks. The
latter, though only 35 years of age, was distinguished no less
as a physician than as president of the Provincial Congress of
Massachusetts. He had no military experience, and was
urged not to expose himself in battle; but the sound of the
cannon wooed him to the ﬁeld. On his arrival, Col. Prescott
offered him the command, as his superior officer; but War-

At three o’clock, the British ships and batteries poured
in a terrible ﬁre on the redoubt. The ﬁrst American that
fell was horribly mutilated, and his comrades, unaccustomed
to such sights, crowded around. Fearful of the eﬁ'ect, Col-
onel Prescott ordered that he should be instantly buried.
‘He is the ﬁrst man that has been killed,” said he, “and
he is the last that will be buried to-day. To your posts, my
gallant fellows, and let every man do his duty.” And every
man did his duty.

up the hill. The Americans awaited their approach in silence.
They had been ordered to reserve their ﬁre till they saw the
whites of the enemies’ eyes, and Gen. Putnam aided in re-
straining their impatience. Wlien the British had reached
the prescribed point, Prescott waved his sword above his
head and shouted FIRE! A deadly discharge was poured
upon the advancing columns. Platoon after platoon wan.
swept down ; the rank.s were broken, and the survivors hast

ily retired. They were rallied for a second charge under
cover of a smoke produced by the burning of several hun

dred wooden houses in Charlestown, which the British had

wantonly set on ﬁre. Again the Americans lay perfectly‘

quiet, till the enemy were within ten rods of the redoubt.
Again they swept down ofﬁcers and men, and again the
British veterans retreated. Gen. Clinton now crossed with
1,000 fresh troops. It was resolved to make another at-
tack, though some of the oﬁicers declared that it was leading
their men to certain death. After a few moments’ rest, du-
ring which, in the face of a destructive ﬁre, a small party of
Americans crossed Charlestown Neck and joined their counu
trymen, the British troops a third time commenced the
ascent.

The patriots, as before, poured in a galling ﬁre ; they shot
down a number of oﬁicers, and wounded Howe himself.
Unfortunately, however, their ammunition gave out. The
British rushed up to the parapet, and, as they mounted it,
were received with stones and clubbed muskets. Resistance
being hopeless, Prescott ordered a retreat. He himself and
VVarren were the last to leave the redoubt. The latter, hav-
ing done good service, was aboutjoining his companions,

ly killed. . In him America lost one of her truest friends.

297. The retreat of the provincials was bravely covered
by detachments of their countrymen who had occupied a
position in the rear during the engagement. Evening found
them safely encamped at Prospect Hill, a mile from the bat—
tle ground. They had lost 115 killed, 305 wounded, and 353
prisoners. On the British side 226 were killed, 828 wound-=
ed and missing. The battle had taken place in sight of the
whole people of Boston. The roofs and steeples, as well as
the surrounding hills, were ﬁlled with anxious Women and
children, whose destinies depended on the issue of the day.
The Americans had the decided advantage, though the Brit=
ish, remaining masters of the ﬁeld, claimed the victory. '

298. Israel Putnam, familiarly known as “ Old Put”, one
of the heroes whose name is embalmed in the glories of Bun-
ker Hill, was born in Salem, Massachusetts, 1718. He emi-
grated to Connecticut, and his life from early youth was full
of romantic adventures. At one time we see him descend-=
ing into the Wolf’s den and shooting her by the light of her
own glaring eyes ; at another, actively engaged in the French
and Indian War‘, now saving a comrade’s life at Crown Point
by killing a French sentinel, and anon escaping from his en-
emies with twelve bullet-holes in his blanket. In 1756, he
found himself the prisoner of a party of savages, who,,after
driving him for miles under a heavy load, bound him to a
stake, and prepared to burn him to death. Already had the
ﬂames scorched his skin, when. a French oﬂicer burst through
thelcrowd, scattered the brands, and saved his life. Shortly
afterwards, Putnam Was surprised by Indians just above the
rapids in the Hudson. A glance showed him that his only
chance of escape lay in threading the channel of the boister-
ous passage. With amazement his pursuers saw his boat
leap into the seething waters, shoot through yawning whirl»
pools, dash past hidden rocks, and at last dart out into the
placid waters far below.

Putnam’s remarkable presence of mind was again displayed
at Fort Edward. The barracks ‘caught ﬁre; and, separated
from them only by a thin partition, was a magazine contain-,
ing 300 barrels of gunpowder. The men ﬂed in alarm from
the scene of danger ; but Putnam persisted in pouring water
on the ﬂames, put out the ﬁre, and at the expense of some
severe burns saved the fort. He was in the ﬁeld ploughing,
when he heard of the battle of Lexington. Leaving his
plough where it was, without even changing his clothes, he
hastened to Cambridge. The British offered him the rank
of major-general and a large sum of money if he would de-
sert the American cause; but the sturdy patriot scornfully
refused, and paid them for the insult on the bloody ﬁeld of
Bunker Hill. '

INVASIONWOF CANADA.

299. THE day before the battle of Bunker Hill, Washing-
ton accepted the office of commander-in-chief, expressing his
sense of the high responsibilities it involved, and declining
to receive any remuneration except the payment of his ex-
penses. After removing his mother to a place of safety, he
set out ‘at once for Cambridge, where he arrived July 2d,
.1775. He found an army of 14,500 men, with little or no
knowledge of military‘ manoeuvres. Months of constant
drilling werespent in making them effective soldiers. There
were no engineers ; and almost every diﬁiculty that can be
conceived had to be encountered in "conducting the siege.
Evenpowder was wanting ; and it was with great diﬂiculty
that a small supply was obtained.

300. On the 6th of July, Congress in an able manifesto set
forth its reasons for taking up arms. It also established a
line of posts for the communication of intelligence, under the
superintendence of Franklin. This same month, Georgia,
which had not before taken part in the movement, joined
her sister colonies, and chose delegates to Congress.

301. Knowing that large stores Were collected at Quebec,
and believing that the people would join in the Revolution
if opportunity offered, Congress determined on an expedi-
tion against Canada, and placed General Montgomery at its
head. St. J ohn’s surrendered to the invaders on the 3d of
November; the country was overrun, and Montreal was
taken. The time for which many of the American soldiers
had enlisted now ran out; and, as they insisted on returning,
Montgomery was left with no more than 300 followers to
advance upon Quebec. ,

Meanwhile, 1,100 Americans, under Benedict Arnold, now
raised to the rank of colonel, were marching through the
northern wilderness of Maine to the succor of their couns-
trymen. No one at the present day can estimate the hard-»
ships which that devoted band were called on to endure; now
forcing their way through tangled thickets and over path-
less mountains; and now wading through swollen rivers,
pushing their boats before them, or borne away by rapids
and struggling for life amid the waves;——worn out, sick, cold,
hungry, disheartened. Not a few gave up the expedition,
and returned to Massachusetts. With some of his bravest
men, Arnold pushed on to a French village for supplies, leav-
ing the rest of his force in a most critical position. The last
ox was killed and distributed; the last dog was eaten with
avidity; then roots and moose-skin moccasins were their
only resource. When the‘ aid sent back by Arnold-reached
the famished band, they had eaten nothing for two days.

Even such suffering, however, could not discourage these
brave hearts. Among them were not a few noted in later
times—Morgan, Greene, and Meigs [mega], all benefactors
of their country,——and Aaron Burr, then a youth of 20, after-
wards Vice-President of the United States. a
At last, surmounting incredible obstacles, the heroic band
stood before Quebec," and eﬁected a junction with the army
of Montgomery, who took command of the whole. Together
they numbered but. 900 effective men. A commander less
brave and energetic would have shrunk from attacking those
smassive walls with so insigniﬁcant a force. Montgomery
hesitated not; he had been there before under Wolfe, and
remembered his glorious example. After besieging the place
three weeks, and ﬁnding that his few small cannon ‘could
make no impression on its defences, on the last day of the
year 177 5, with the approval of his officers and men, he pre-
pared for an assault.

ing snow Which nearly blinded him, saw a rude blockhouse
defended by a battery of three-pounders. “Men of New
York,” he cried, “ you will not fear to follow Where your
general leads! March on.” Rushing at the head of his
troops to the assault, he Was almost immediately swept down,
with both his aids and a number of privates, by a discharge
of grape-shot. Disheartened by the loss of their leader, the
rest of the division retreated to Wolfe’s Cove.

Arnold’s narrovvipath to the lower city was commanded
by muskets and cannon- Advancing at the head of his divi-
sion, he received a ball in the leg, Which obliged him to leave
the ﬁeld and give up the command to Captain Morgan. The
ﬁrst barrier was carried, and the city entered. But. with
only 200 men, most of Whose muskets Were rendered useless
by the snow, it Was impossible for Morgan either to carry
the defences before him or to make good a retreat. Over-
powering forces gathered around, and he Was compelled to
surrender. In this assault 160 Americans Were killed and
426 made prisoners. The British loss was only 20.

303. The death of Montgomery Was regarded as a na-
tionalcalamity. Even in Britain eulogies on his character
‘Were delivered. Arnold with his remaining force encamped
about three miles from the city, and continued the blockade.
He Was superseded in April, 17 76, by Gen.tWooste1°, Who,
the following month, gave Way to Gen. Thomas. Quebec
still maintained a successful resistance; and rumors of Carle-
ton’s approach with a powerful army soon reached the Amer-
ican camp. A hasty retreat Was made, and the Whole of
Canada Was recovered by the British.

fond of war, they paid considerable attention to agriculture;
and in the intervals between their military expeditions their
warriors assisted the women in tilling the soil. Like the Iro-
quois in the north, the Greeks united the neighboringtribes
with themselves in a confederacy, which greatly increased

their power. Among the nations thus allied to them at a’

later day, were the Sem’-i-noles, who have long troubled our
government in Florida. ~ i H

The brave Chick’-a-saws, also members of the Mobilian
group, dwelt on the banks of the great “ Father of Waters”
(the Mississippi), north of the Natchez. On the other side
of the latter, towards the Tom-big’=-bee, lived the Choctaws,
in a delightful country, which yieldedrich crops almost with-
out cultivation. 0 l

25. Besides the tribes mentioned above, there were many
others of less importance.‘ nYet at no time, before or after its
discovery, was there a dense Indian population in America.
Most of the minor tribes were small; and from all that can
be gathered, it would seem as if the aborigines south of the
St. Lawrence and east of the Mississippi were not, when dis-
covered by Columbus, more than 200,000 in number.

SIEGE AND EVACUATION OF BOSTON.

304. THE idea of a complete separation from Britain, origin
nated, as we have seen, in North Carolina, began to gain
ground in the colonies; but Congress still determined on a
last appeal. A petition for redress was sent to England, but
received no attention from either king or Parliament. On
the contrary, actswere passed prohibiting trade with the

colonies, and authorizing the capture of American vessels, the‘

hiring of German soldiers, and the transportation of 25,000
additional English troops to the new world. On this, Con-
gress gave up all hope of reconciliation, and prepared for a
vigorous defence. Military stores were collected. Powder
was bought in foreign ports, and its manufacture was com»
menced at home. Privateers were commissioned, from the
bold attacks of which British commerce suﬁered much till
the termination of the war. T . .

305. Inthe fall of 1775, Gen. Gage was superseded by
Sir William Howe, after having sent British ‘G men—of—war to
ravage different parts of the coast. Falmouth [faZ’-muzi/z_'|,
now Portland, Maine, was levelled to the ground. Other
places were threatened. Newport escaped only by contrib...
uting a weekly supply for the fleet.‘ »

306, The British still had hopes of deterring New York
from taking part against the king, and Governor Tryon was
authorized to use persuasion, threats, and even bribery, with
its citizens for that purpose. Congress, however, baffled his
efforts by ordering that all persons dangerous to the liberties
of America should be seized; for on this, the governor took
refuge on a British ship.——Lord Dunmore was still giving

inthe face of the battery on the "heights, Howe was obliged
to evacuate Boston; and, on the 17th of March, the whole
land and naval force of Britain, with about 1,500 loyalists,
left the harbor. This event was hailed with joy by the de-
fenders of America, particularlyby‘ those patriots who had
been shut up in the besieged city. They had hardly been
able to obtainthe necessaries of ‘life. Provisions had risen
to four times their usual value. Wood had become so scarce
that the pews of churches, the counters of stores, and the
timber of unoccupied buildings, had been used for fuel. The
thanks of Congress were voted to the besieging army, and
a gold medal was struck in commemoration of the event.

CHAPTER VI.

BRITISH ATTACK ON CHARLESTON.--DECLARATION OF INDE-
PENDENCE.

308. THE British directed their ﬁrst active operations in
17 '7 6 against the south. On the 4th of June, Admiral
Parker appeared off Charleston with a strong ﬂeet direct
from England, conveying 2,500 troops, of WhichGren. Clinton
took the command. The ‘people of Carolina, having received
intelligence of the intended attack, were not unprepared for
it. Six thousandmen had collected iii and about the "city.
A fort of palmetto-Wood and earth, hastily erected on Sulli-
van’s Island, and defended by 26 cannon and 500 brave men
under Col. Moultrie, commanded the channel. Another fort
on the opposite side of the island Was held by Col. Thomp-
son. Gen. Lee had hastened from the north, to conduct the
defence. 1

it to a‘ staﬂ’, and again set ‘it up, amid ashower of balls from

senting him hisown sword and a lieutenant’s. commission.

Late in the action, Admiral Parker ordered the crew of
one of his vessels, which was disabled, to set her on ﬁre and
abandon her. The ship Was left with guns loaded and colors
ﬂying. No sooner had her crew departed than she was
boarded by the Americans, who carried off her ﬂags and
bells, ﬁred her guns at Parker’s ship, and bore away three
boatloads of stores. a T '

For more than nine hours the British kept up the attack,
but without making any ‘impression on the fort. ‘ Only ten
Americans were killed, and 22 wounded. The enemy’s loss

‘in killed and wounded amounted to 225. After lying to a

few days to reﬁt, the ﬂeet sailed for the north.

309. On the evacuation of Boston by the British, Wash-
ington set out with most of his army for New York, now
threatened by the enemy. He arrived there April 14th,
1776. Feeling that nothing could be done with men whose
terms of service were constantly expiring, he, prevailed on
Congress to provide fora three years’ enlistment and to offer
a bounty of $10 to each recruit. The army at New York
was thus in a few months increased to 27,000 men ;’ but
nearly half of them were unﬁt for duty from sickness or a
lack of arms. Even had this whole force consisted of eﬂ'ec-=
tive men, it would have been insufficient for the defence of a
line 15 miles long, any point of which was liable to attack.

Island, opposite New York, and there also defensive works
were constructed. a .

310. The Virginia Legislature had recommended Congress
to declare the colonies absolved from their allegiance to the
crown; and similar requests were made from various quar-
ters. On the 7th of June, 1776, Richard Henry Lee, of Va.,
moved that these United Colonies are and of right ought to
be f7"ee and independent states. Thomas Jefferson, of Va.,
John Adams, of Mass, Benjamin Franklin, of Penn, Roger
Sherman, of Conn., and Robert R. Livingston, of New York,
were appointed a committee to draft a Declaration of Inde-
pendence. Jefferson, as chairman, prepared the important
document. It was reported’ to Congress, and after being
discussed several days and slightly amended, was adopted at
two o’clock on the 4th of July, 17 7 6.. ' T

On this eventful d.ay, the streets of Philadelphia were
crowded with excited citizens, anxious to learn the decision
of Congress. The bell-ringer of the old state-house had taken
his post in the steeple at an early hour, that he might lose no
time in announcing to the people that their independence
was formally declared. The old man had grown impatient
at the delay, when suddenly he heard the jo_yfu.l shout
“Ring! Ring!” from his boy, whom he had stationed to
give him notice of the anticipated event. Loudly pealed the
old bell, and as loudly were its tones greeted by the delight-
ed citizens. The glorious declaration was signed by all the
members present, and the thirteen colonies were thenceforth
known as “the Thirteen United States of America”.

The news was everywhere hailed with joy. Washington,
on receiving a copy of the document, caused the troops to be
paraded and the Declaration to he read to each brigade.

CHAPTER VII.
BATTLE or LONG ISLAND.

311. On evacuating Boston, General Howe went to Hali»
fax, whence, he soon after set sail for New York. By the
8th of July, he had landed 9,000 men on Staten Island, and
four days afterwards his brother, Admiral Howe, arrived
with reinforcements from England. These, with 'Clinton’s
detachment and subsequent arrivals, swelled the British army
to 30,000 men. Of these, a large part were_ Germans, gener—
ally known as Hessians, because most of them were furnished
by the Landgrave of Hes’-se Cas’-sel. The British govern-
ment paid the princes from whom they hired these mercena-
ries $36 for each man, and guaranteed to protect their do»
"minions from attack.

312. Gen. Howe had been instructed to try conciliatory
measures with the Americans. Accordingly he issued a
proclamation, offering pardon to all who would return to
their allegiance. Congress caused this document to be pub-
lished in the papers of the day, to show the people that the
king would still be satisﬁed with nothing but their absolute
submission. Howe next sent an oflicer to the American
camp with a letter addressed to George "Washington, Esq.

recognize his public position. The address was then altered
to George Washington, 850., &c.; and the oﬂicer who brought
the. letter tried to satisfy the commander that these 0md-so-
f'07"t/as bore any meaning he might wish to give them. Washu
ington still declined. He would receive no letters, he in-
formed the British oﬂicer, that were not directed to him as
commander of the American army. He had heard that Lord
Howe was empowered to grant pardons; but, as those who
were guilty of no fault needed no pardon, he did not see the
necessity for any communication.

313. These attempts having failed, Howe determined to
assume the offensive without further delay. On the 22d of
August (1776), General Clinton crossed from Staten Island
to the southwest point of Long Island-with 10,000 men and
40 cannon. Nine thousand Americans had been stationed in
and about Brooklyn under Generals Sullivan and Stirling,
and Putnam was hastily sent over from New York, to take
the chief command. The British landed without opposition,
and advanced in three divisions, by three different roads,
crossing the thickly-wooded heights that ran across the island
and separated them from the Americans. Gen. Grant took
the direct left-hand route along New York Bay. The Brit-
ish centre, consisting of Hessians under Gen. Heister [/zise’-=
tar], advanced by the Flatbush road. Clinton, who com-
manded on the right, was to take a circuitous route and fall
on Sullivan’s rear. The attack A was skilfully planned and
well carried out.

On the morning of the 27th, Grant advanced as far as the
hills now embraced in Greenwood Cemetery. Here he was
met by Stirling with 1,500 men, and an engagement ensued
without any positive advantage on either side. Heister pushed
on to within a short distance of Gen. Sullivan,’ and kept up a
brisk cannonade on his front. It was answered with spirit
by the Americans, till, to their dismay, they heard a distant

and was rapidly advancing on their rear. Almost surround-
ed, they could hope for safety only in a hasty retreat.   This
Sullivan attempted ; but it was too late. The British already
held the road, and drove his men back on the Hessians. Only
a few forced their way through Olinton’s ranks. After a
desperate struggle," Sullivan, with many of his officers and
men, was obliged to surrender. W '
Cornwallis [com-wol’-Zis] hastened on towards the Bay, to
cut off Stirling’s division. A sharp conﬂict ensued, and the
Americans, driving the . enemy back, reached Gro-wan’-us
Creek. In trying to cross this stream, a 4 number were

tively few of his men reached Fort Putnam in safety. The
British were completely victorious. Their loss was but 367
in killed and wounded; that of the Americans amounted to
1,650, 1,1.00 of whom were prisoners. The latter, doomed

to suffer in loathsome prison-ships, almost regretted that they

had not fallen on the ﬁeld.

314. While the battle was still raging, Washington crossed
from New York. With anguish he beheld the slaughter of
his best troops ; nor could he attempt their relief with men
from the fort, for already the garrison was too "small for its
defence. All he could hope to do was to save the remnant
of the army. Fortunately Howe did not attack the fort,
but, encamping about a third of a mile from it, waited for
the ﬂeet to come up. The next morning (August 28th), the
British commenced ﬁring on the fort. At midnight a heavy
fog arose, which hid the armies from each other throughout
thefollowing day. On the evening of the 29th, the men
were silently paraded, and about midnight they commenced
embarking from the point now occupied by the Fulton Ferry.
The boats moved noiselessly with muﬂied oars; and in the
course of six hours, the whole army, with their baggage and
munitions, the heavy artillery alone excepted, crossed in
safety to New York. Washington‘ remained till the last
company had embarked- He had not slept for two days, so
great was his anxiety to save his men.

315*. Secure of his prey, Howe had no suspicion of what

the movement, and sent a negro to the British general with

. the intelligence. But providentially falling into the hands of

There is a wild grandeur about them, yet less irregularity
than marks more cultivated tongues. Acquainted only With
nature, a total stranger to art, science, commerce, and me»
chanical industry, the India.n needed but few words: yet, as

a human being, subject to the same passions, as others, he «

required a language capable of expressing his thoughts and
feelings; and this we ﬁnd him possessing in all parts of the
continent.

27. The organs of the Indian were the same as those of
the European... In speaking, both used the tongue, palate,
lips, and throat; and therefore the sounds produced by both
were in a great measure the same. Certain tribes, however,
had certain peculiarities. The Algonquins had no f; the
Iroquois had no 7%, 6, p, f, or 2), and, except the Oneidas,
no Z. Some of the Algonquin dialects were harsh from the
frequent recurrence of consonants; but most of the Indian
tongues were remarkable for their softness and music. Par-
ticularly was this the case with Cherokee, every syllable of
which ended with a vowel. 7

28. The Indian had a name for whatever he could see,
hear, or feel; but he had few words to express abstract ideas.
Thus in none of the American dialects was there any single
term for justice, temperance, ‘or,vi7~zfue. The difference be-
tween savage and civilized life was so great that a vast num»
ber of words necessary in the latter were wholly unknown to
the Red Man. When introduced into his language, they had
to be expressed by long compounds describing the object or
action by means of words already existing. The Indian, for
example, never kneels ; when, therefore, the missionary Eliot
wished to use this term in translating the Bible, he had to
form an uncouth word of eleven syllables,——wutajo]0esittule-

of the retreating Americans was beyond their reach. Mort-
tiﬁed that he had allowed the enemy to escape, Howe took
possession of Fort Putnam, and allowed his men a few days’
rest. A -
The overthrow on Long Island was every way disastrous
to the Americans. ' Besides their actual loss, it deprived the
army of their self-conﬁdence, led to the desertion of hun-
dreds, and prevented many from espousing the republican
cause. The defeat of the Americans is attributable in part
to their total want of cavalry, but principally to. their neg—
lecting to have a sufﬁcient guard on the Jamaica road. It
is said that a single regiment at the proper point could have
prevented Clinton’s advance. ,
316. Supposing that the Americans might now incline to
peace, Howe sent Sullivan on parole with a proposition to
Congress. A committee was appointed by that body to

confer with the British general; but, as neither party would
_make concessions, nothing was effected. Franklin was on

this committee ; and, when Howe spoke of England’s being
ready to protect the colonies, he begged to assure his lord-
ship that the colonies felt fully able to protect themselves.
317. The British army was soon ready to attack New
York, and Washington felt that with the means at hiscom~
mand he could not successfully oppose them. Accordingly,
he removed his stores to the forts above the city, and coin-
menced retreating to the north. It being highly important
to gain some knowledge of Howe’s movements, Captain
Nathan Hale, of Connecticut, undertook to visit the British
camp as a spy. He reached the English lines in safety, and
obtained the desired information. On his way back, how-
ever, he was recognized by a tory relative, who arrested him
and took him to Howe’s headquarters. He was executed

CHAPTER VIII.

WASHINGTON’S RETREAT.--BATTLE OF WI-IITE PLAINS.

318. ON the 15th of September, a large detachment of
the ‘British army crossed the East River, three miles above
the city, and spread out across the island. Most of the
American army had made good their retreat towards the
Harlem River; but the rear-guard, consisting of 4,000 men
under Putnam, would have been cut off, had not a Whig

"lady, at whose house the British, generals called for refresh-

ments, managedto detain them with her hospitalities till the

danger was past. Putnam’s men had been ﬁfteen hours _

under arms, and not a few fell before reaching camp from

the effects of fatigue and excessive heat.

319. So discouraged were the Americans by their recent

disasters that Wasliington found some vigorous movement .

necessary to restore their conﬁdence. The morning after the
British landed, an opportunity occurred. Several parties of
the enemy approached the American camp. Engaging their
attention by an attack in front, Washington .sent Colonel
Knowltonand Major Leitch to fall upon their rear. The
British, though reinforced, were driven from the ﬁeld with
the loss of more than 100 men. The Americans lost about
half that number, among whom were the two brave oﬁicers
just mentioned. I I I

city, which was not arrested . till 493 buildings, including
Trinity Church, were consumed. Meanwhile the Americans
were strengthening their position on the upper part of the
island. ‘-A double line of intrenchments was hastily thrown
up, and Fort VVashington was erected on a ro_cky height
overlooking the Hudson. Among those who distinguished
themselves by their skill in the construction of ‘these de-
fences was Alexander Hamilton, now about 20 years of age.
The mathematical perfection of his work elicited the admi-
ration of Washington, who invited him to his quarters, and

"soon made him his chief aid-de-camp and counsellor.

321. Deeming the American works too strong to be at~
tacked in front, Howe determined to gain their rear; and,
having sent part of his ﬂeet up the Hudson to prevent
communication with the west and south, he_ moved up the
Sound with the greater part of his army, and took a posi-
tion n.ortheast of Washington’s camp. To avoid an engage-
ment, the American commander, after leaving a garrison of
about 8,000 men in Fort Washington, which it was resolved
to hold to the last extremity, withdrew his main body from
Manhattan Island, and after a trying march ﬁxed his head-
quarters at“VVhite’ Plains. On the 28th of October, Howe
came up, and a furious cannonade commenced. The Amer-
icans, having been driven from one of their positions, fell
back a short distance, and intrenched themselves so strongly
during the ensuing night that Howe deemed it prudent to
wait for reinforcements. Before he was ready to renew the
attack, Washington withdrew to North Castle, among the
hills south of the Oroton River. Howe did not follow, but,
after remaining several days at White Plains, retired to-
wards New York. . ’

army and the ultimate establishment of American liberty.
324. On the 19th of November, the British crossed the
Hudson. After taking Fort Lee, which was abandoned on
their approach, they started in pursuit of Washington’s army,
now reduced to 3,000 men. Orders had been sent to ‘Lee,

~ to bring on his detachment from North Castle, but they

were disobeyed on various pretexts. A rapid and melan-
choly retreat across New Jersey was conducted by Wash-
ington in his usual masterly manner, the British ‘pressing
closely on his rear. The Americanitroops suffered much,
many of them being without shoes, and leaving blood-stained
tracks on the frozen ground. At last they reached the Del-
aware at Trenton, and, the boats having been secured for a
distance of 70 miles, crossed to Pennsylvania. ‘Cornwallis
came up soon after; but, instead of bridging the river or
building boats, he preferred waiting till the ice should enable
him to cross, stationing detachments in Princeton, New
Brunswick, and various points on the Jersey shore of the
Delaware.

fence. Philadelphia was in danger, and Congress deemed it
prudent to remove to Baltimore. General Lee, advancing
leisurely in spite of ‘VVashington’s commands, and taking;
quarters at a distance from his troops, was captured by a
scouting party of the enemy. But Sullivan, who had been
exchanged for a British general, succeeded to his command,
and speedily effected a union With Washington. About the
same time, some recruits from Pennsylvania reached the
American camp, and the commander-in-chief thus found him

self at the head of about 5,000 men.

326. To revive the spirits of his countrymen, Washingtoii
resolved on a bold enterprise. Trenton Was occupied by
1,500 Hessians under Col.‘ Rahl, and a troop of British horse.
Supposing that the Germans, according to their custom, would
spend Christmas in revelry, and rest soundly after their ca-
rousals, he determined to attempt a surprise. The night of
December 25tI; was starless and stormy. The Delaware ‘Was
full of ice. Two divisions of the American army were unable
to cross ; but the third, under Washing‘ton and Sullivan,
made the passage, and at four on the morning of the 26th com-
menced their march for Trenton.

The surprise was suc- -

with the British horse, had made good their escape. Aware-
that he could not hold Trenton against the superior force
which could be concentrated there in a few hours, ‘Washington
recrossed the Delaware with his prisoners and spoils. He had

lost but four men, two of whom were frozen to death. This

brilliant achievement restored the courage of his men and
the conﬁdence of the people. Howe, in alarm,.ordered Corn-
wallis, who was on the point of embarking for England, back
to New Jersey. Congress invested Washington with extra-
ordinary powers, gave him the absolute control of the war,
and endeavored to carry out the. measures he suggested.

were induced to remain six weeks longer by a bounty of $10

ed the Delaware, and took post at Trenton. On the 2d of
January, 1777, news was received that Cornwallis was ap-
proaching with a powerful force. After some skirmishing.
the Americans fell back, and, night coming on, both parties
rested on their arms [see Map, p. 233]. Washington did not
like either to hazard an engagement, or, by a retreat, to leave
Philadelphia exposed to the enemy. He ‘therefore conceived
the bold design of marching by a circuitous route to Prince-

ton and surprising the British force stationed at that place.

Leaving his ﬁres burning, he silently withdrew his men, and
early on the morning of the 3d of January reached Princeton.

The surprise would have been complete, had not the Amer-
icans met a brigade of the enemy already on the march for

Trenton. An engagement took place, and "the American van,

under Gen. Mercer, having no bayonets, were driven back.
The British pursued, but at this moment Washington came
up and placed himself between his ﬂying troops and the ad-
vancing enemy. Col. Fitzgerald, his aid, thinking that the

general’s death was certain, drew his hat over his face that
he might not see him fall. A roar of musketry followed, and
Fitzgerald’s heart almost ceased to beat as he looked up to
ascertain the fate of his commander. To his joy, his beloved
chief was uninjured. The British were repulsed, but the
Americans sustained a heavy loss in the fall of Gen. Mercer.
He was trying to rally his men on foot, when he was struck
to the ground and surrounded by the enemy. Refusing to
ask for quarter, he defended himself with his sword, till he
received a mortal wound from a British bayonet. ,

The ﬁrst intimation received by Cornwallis of his adver-
sary’s successful manoeuvre, was the distant roar of cannon.
Mortiﬁed at having been out-generalled, he hastened to the
ﬁeld of battle, but arrived too late. Washington had
achieved a victory, and retired. The Americans, completely

exhausted by want of sleep and their late exertions, at length

reached Morristown in safety, and there Wasliingtoii estab-
lished his winter-quarters. The British lost about 400, killed,
wounded, and captured, in the battle of Princeton; the Amer-
icans, one-fourth of that number. A _

assailed on the route by hostile parties, who hung on his rear,
cut off stragglers, and embarrassed’ his movements. The
brutal outrages of the invaders, particularly the Hessians,
from which not even the loyalists were exempt, awakened
general indignation and led many to take arms against them.
Several expeditions were sent out by Washington, which»re—
sulted in the recovery of the greater part of New Jersey,

New Brunswick and Amboy being at last the only posts held '

by the British. A scarcity of tents and blankets occasioned
for a time great distress in the American camp; but this was

CHAPTER X.

LA FAYETTE’S ARRIVAL.-'—TRYON IN CONNECTICUT.---CAPTURE
OF GEN. PRESCOTT.

329. IN March, 17 76, Congress had sent Silas Deane, of
Connecticut, to solicit the aid of France. ‘He was joined by
Benjamin Franklin and Arthur Lee. The French court, al-
ways hostile "to England, listened to the American commis-
sioners with respectful attention, but hesitated to lend any
open assistance to a cause whose chance of success seemed so
slender. Aid, however, was secretly furnished. More than
20,000 stands of arms and 1,000 barrels of powder reached
America in the course of the ensuing year.

The nobility of France generally looked on the movements
of the American people as a rebellion against their lawful
sovereign ; and, though they heartily disliked England, they
felt little sympathy with the republican cause. There was
one among them, however, a young captain of dragoons,
who believed the people right in_ resisting ‘oppression and
viewed their struggles with admiration. This was the Mar-
quis de La Fayette [chi la/L fa-617]. At an entertainment
given to a brother of the English king, he first heard of - the
Declaration of Independence. Its arguments carried con-
viction to his heart; and, though allured by brilliant pros-
pects at home and just married to a woman whom be ten-
derly loved, he devoted himself to a cause which he felt to
be as just as it seemed hopeless. Promised by Mr. Deane a
commission as major-general in the United States army, La
Fayette determined to set out at once. ' But there. were dif-
ﬁculties in the way. His family objected to his going; the
British minister opposed it; and the king withheld his per-
mission. The young marquis, however, was not to be de-
terred by such obstacles. Purchasing a vessel, he escaped

the oﬁicers sent to detain him, and, with De Kalb and a few
others who sympathized with America, arrived at Charleston.
He received the promised. commission in July, 17 7 7, before
completing his twentieth year. His acquaintance with Wash-
ington commenced a few ‘days after, and ripened into a ﬁrm
and uninterrupted friendship.-

330. Towards the close of April, 1777, Gov. Tryon was _

sent from New York with 2,000 men to destroy some Ameri-
can stores collected at Danbury, Conn. He accomplished the
Work, and, on his return to the coast, gratiﬁed his malice by
plundering the inhabitants and devastating the country. A

body of militia hastily assembled under Generals Wooste1', ,

Arnold, and Silliman, and handled the marauders so roughly
that they were glad to reach their boats. Tryon lost about
300 men; the Americans one-ﬁfth as many. Gen. Wooster‘,
though a man of seventy, fought with all the vigor of youth,
and was mortally wounded. Arnold received the ﬁre of a
whole platoon at a distance of thirty yards, but escaped un-
injured. B _ '

'331. Soon after this, Colonel Meigs retaliated, by crossing

from Connecticut and burning 12 Britishvessels and a large '

quantity of stores at Sag Harbor, near the eastern extremity
of Long" Island. He brought back ninety prisoners, without
the loss of a single man. '

332.'Another exploit, in Rhode Island, showed no little
daring. The command of the British forces in that quarter

. devolved on Gen. Prescott, whose tyranny excited the indig-

nation of the inhabitants. Feeling secure in the presence of
a large naval force in the bay, he ﬁxed his quarters, with a
small guard, about ﬁve miles from Newport. Lieutenant-
colonel Barton, of Providence, having received from a de-
serter at full description of the place,‘ set out with 40 brave
men, on the night of July 10th,’ 17 7 7, to capture the British

22 I INDIAN LANGUAGES.

29. In all the American languages, objects and actions
Were seldom expressed apart from their relations. Nouns
rarely appeared without adjectives or limiting terms, and the
pronoun was incorporated with the verb. A complete sen-
tence, which Would require ten or a dozen words in English,
was often expressed by a single compound embodying in it-»
self subject, adjective, verb, and object. When any of these
was changed, a new form became necessary, so that some
verbs had more than ﬁve thousandvariations. This mode of
expression prevailed, because the Indian naturally represented
an object just as it appeared to his senses, that is with all its
associations. I

30. Languages that combine the powers of different parts
of speech in a single word are called synthetic. Such are
all the Indian tongues; and in this they somewhat resem-=
ble Hebrew. Synthetic ‘languages are diﬁicult to learn, and
do not aﬁ“ord the same facility of expression as those in
which each object and action has a name that can be used
independently of its relations. Nor are they as capable of
improvement; the Indian, instead of simplifying his syntax,
adds syllable to syllable, till his Words become of great length,
While the learner is embarrassed by the numerous changes of
form required by different modiﬁcations of the idea.

31. None of the Indian languages were written ; they
had no letters with which their words could be represented.
Sincewhite men, however, have become acquainted with the
aboriginal tongues, they have taken the letters of the English
alphabetto denote their sounds, and have thus been able to
Write as well as speak them. The Cherokees alone have an
alphabet devised by one of their own number. The name of

that they heard the call of the guard, they landed about a
mile from Prescott’s lodgings, and proc_eeded thither with
all speed. A British sentinel demanded the countersign.
“We have none,” replied Barton, “but have you seen any
deserters here to-night ?” The sentinel supposed the party
to be friends, and before he perceived his mistake, was seized,
disarmed, and threatened with instant death if he made any
noise. The Americans soon reached the house. Prescott’s

CHAPTER XI.

BURGrOYNE’S CAMPAIGN AND SURRENDER.

-334.. WHILE Howe was endeavoring to bring VVashington
to an engagement, Gren.iB.urgoyne, who had concentrated
an army of 10,000 men in Canada, was advancing towards
the. head-waters of the Hudson. His object was to effect a
junction with the southern army,’ after garrisoning the im-

, portant ‘posts on his route and thus cutting off Washington’s

communication with the eastern states. On the 21st of June
he gave a war-feast, on the west bank of Lake Champlain, to
400 Indians, among whom was Little Turtle, afterwards the
leader of a powerful confederacy. The chiefs promised their
aid,_ and, as they looked on his splendid array, believed his

«boastful promise of a speedy triumph over the “ rebels”,

The invading host soon reached Ticonderoga, which was
commanded by Gen. St. Clair and‘ garrisoned by about 3,000

334. Meanwhile, who had succeeded to the command in Canada? Give an account
of Burgoyne’s movements and object. On the 21st of June, what took place? What

Americans. St. Clair had determined to hold out to the last

extremity; but, to his dismay, he soon saw the British erect-

ing batteries on Mount Deﬁance [see Map. p.169], a rocky
height commanding the fort, which he had deemed inacces-
sible. A speedy retreat was necessary. Before daylight on
the 6th of July, the ammunition and stores were on the way
to Skenesborough [s7ceens’-bur-r0], now Whitehall, at the
head of the Lake. At the same time the army silently
crossed and took the road forHFort Edward, to join Gen.
Schuyler [s]cz"-Zer] and the rest of the northern army. The
British, after pursuing St. Clair and defeating his rear-guard,
took Skenesborough and the valuable stores there collected.
Early in July, Burgoyne had issued a proclamation offering
pardon and protection to all who would abandon the rebel
cause, and threatening those who adhered to it with the seve-
rest punishment. This was met by Schuyler with a counter-
proclamation in which he reminded his countrymen of the
protection that had been extended to the people of New Jer-
sey, and warned them against listening to the deceitful prom-
ises of the enemy.

335. The loss of so many strongholds in the north, with-
out a blow in their defence, produced general alarm, and led
many to charge Schuyler and St. Clair with inefficiency; but
an investigation instituted by Congress proved that they had
done all that the means at their command allowed. Some
of the ablest oﬂicers  the American service were ordered
to the north, to aid in arresting Burgoyne’s advance: among
these were Lincoln, to whom the Massachusetts troops were
intrusted; Arnold, noted for his ﬁery courage; and Morgan
with his famous corps of riﬂemen. s Burgoyne’s advance was
slow, forit was necessaryto remove the obstructions which
the Americans had placed in his way. On the 30th of July,
he reached Fort Edward, which Schuyler was compelled to

atoga, Stillwater, and the Mohawk, near its junction with
the Hudson,

336. The Indians Who had promised Burgoyne their friend-
ship, accompanied his army, committing their usual barbar-
ities Whenever opportunity oﬁered. One of their ‘bloody
acts at this time excited universal abhorrence. Near Fort
Edward, in the family of her brother, lived Jane M’Crea
[ma-c9°c'i’], Who Was engaged to Lieutenant Jones, of the
British army. Wlien Burgoyne’s approach Was announced,
Mr. M’Crea, being a Whig, started for Albany; but Jane, in
the hope of meeting her lover, ventured to remain With a
Mrs. McNeil lneel], a neighbor and friend, Who, being a
loy_a.list and cousin of the British General Frazer, apprehend-
ed no danger from the approaching army. On the 27th of
July, hoWever, the house Was surrounded by Indians, and
Mrs. McNeil and Jane Were seized and hurried off by differ-
ent parties. A.n alarm having been raised in the American
camp, they Were pursued and ﬁred upon. Mrs. McNeil Was
forced to the ground by her captors that the bullets might
pass over her, and reached the British camp in safety. Soon
after, another party of Indians came in, and Mrs. McNeil to
her horror recognized among the scalps in their possession
the long glossy hair of her friend. The Indians Were charged
With having murdered her on the road. They asserted, how-
ever, that she Was killed by an American ball, While they
Were trying to bring her off, and that they had then scalped
her to obtain the bounty Which the British Were in the habit
of paying. Lieutenant Jones secured this sad memento of
his betrothed, and resigned his command. His resignation
not being accepted, he deserted. More than ﬁfty years, We
are told, he lived remote from society, a heart-broken man,
observing each anniversary of the day that proved fatal to
his happiness.

Mohawk. His force being doubled by Indians and tories,
who joined him as he advanced from Oswego, he devastated
the country, and laid siege to Fort Schuyler, previously
called Fort Stanwix, on the site of the present village of
Rome, N. Y. This post was bravely defended by Col. Gan’-=
se-voort, but the ammunition and supplies of the garrison
were insufﬁcient for a siege. Gen. Her’-ki-mer, while ad-
Vancing to their relief with a body of militia, fell into an
ambuscade at O-ris’ -ka-ny, was defeated and mortally wound-
ed. The only hope of aid now rested on Gen. Schuyler.
Two ofﬁcers of the garrison undertook to inform him of their
critical situation, Leaving the fort at night, during a vio-
lent storm, they crept to the Mohawk, crossed it on a log,
threaded their way through hostile Indians, and at last
reached Schuyler’s camp. Arnold and 800 men volunteered
to relieve the beleaguered fort. Unwilling to risk an en—
gagement with a superior force if it could be avoided, Ar»
nold had recourse to stratagem. A tory prisoner under
sentence of death was pardoned on condition that he would
go to St. Leger’s camp and spread the report that a large
American army was within a few hours’ march. A His state»
ments, conﬁrmed by a scout also sent by Arnold, produced
such a panic among the Indians and British, already discour-—
aged by the brave resistance of the garrison, that they pree
cipitately ﬂed, leaving their tents, baggage, provisions, and
artillery behind them. St. Leger’s force was completely
dispersed.

ments, and strengthening his position at the mouth of the

with 500 regulars and tories and a number of Indians to
seize on whatever he could ﬁnd. A few miles from Ben-
nington, Baum was met by Gen. Stark with a body of New
Hampshire militia and such volunteers as could be hastily
raised. The two armies came in sight of each other on the
15th of August, but a violent rain" prevented them from en-
gaging. A minister who had come with part of his ﬂock to
strike a blow for his country, was impatient at the delay;
but Stark comforted him with the promise, that, if the next
day was clear, he should have ﬁghting enough. And he
kept his word. ‘ ‘

Early on the 16th, Stark prepared for the attack. As he
beheld the enemy’s columns forming, he exclaimed, “ See,
men! There are the red-coats. We must beat to-day, or
Molly Stark’s a widow.” For two hours the battle raged
furiously. At last the British were driven from the ﬁeld
with the loss of their artillery and baggage. A few hours
after, a detachment which had been sent to the aid of Baum
shared the same fate. In these engagements, the British
had 207 killed and about 600 taken prisoners; the American
loss amounted to 200 in killed and wounded. Four brass
cannon and ammunition wagons, 900 swords, and 1,000 stands
ofarms, were secured by the victors.

~ 339. The patriotism which actuated the Americans at this
time is illustrated in the case of an old man who had ﬁve
sons at the battle of Bennington. A neighbor who had just
come from the ﬁeld told him that one of them had been un-=
fortunate. “Has he proved a coward or traitor?” anxiously
asked the father. “ Wo1‘se than that,” was the answer; “he
has fallen, but while ﬁghting bravely.” “ Then,” said the
father, “I am satisﬁed.” The true-hearted patriot afterwards
declared it was the happiest day of his life, to know that his
ﬁve sons had fought nobly for freedom, though one had fallen
in the conflict.

244 BURG-oYNE’s CAMPAIGN. [1777

340. The defeat of St. Leger and Baum was a severe blow
to Burgoyne’s prospects. It deterred the loyalists from join-
ing his ranks, discouraged him from sending out other expe-
ditions, and showed him that the “rebels” were not as con-
temptible as he had supposed. The courage of the Ameri-
cans was raised in proportion. The outrages of the Indians

excited universal abhorrence, and fears for their own safety‘

led many to oppose the invading force.

341. Three days after the battle of Bennington, Horatio
Grates superseded General Schuyler in the command of the
northern army. Born in England in 1728, Gates had served
in the French and Indian War, and was wounded at Brad-
dock’s defeat. Having taken up his abode in Virginia, he
early embraced the republican cause, and aided VVashington
in the siege of Boston. The 11oble-minded Schuyler keenly
felt the injustice of Congress in depriving him, almost at the
moment of victory, of the glory due to his labors; yet, with
the devotion of a true patriot, he gave Gen. Grates all the in-
formation he possessed, and assisted him to the best of his
ability. ‘ 7

342. The American army having been increased by the
arrival of both regulars and militia, it was resolved to move
sixteen miles up the river in the direction of the enemy, and
arrest Burgoyne’s progress at Bem’-is’s Heights on the West
bank of the Hudson. Fortiﬁcations wer_e erected there un-
der the superintendence of Kosciusko [ices-/Ge-us’-loo], a Polish
officer, now twenty-one yearsof age, who, on Dr.‘ Franklin’s
recommendation, had been commissioned as an engineer in
the American army. The British commander, whose diffi-
culties increased as he advanced, moved slowly along the
bank of the Hudson, and at length halted within two miles
of the American camp.‘

but encamped on the west bank of the Hudson at WilbL1r’s
Basin." Gates was soon reinforced by 2,000 New England
troops under Gen. Lincoln, who, hanging on Burgoyne’s
rear, had surprised several of his garrisons, and cut off his
line of communication. The armies thus remained in sight
of each other for more than two weeks, the Americans be-
ing constantly strengthened by accessions from the neigh-
borhood, and the British as constantly weakened by the de-
fection of loyalists and Indians.‘ Frequent skirmishes took
place, and Burgoyne’s army was kept in constant alarm.
Among the incidents Worthy of relation was a daring at-
tempt on the part of twenty young farmers to take an ad-
vanced British picket. Moving noiselessly to within a few
yards of the post, the leader suddenly sounded an old trum-
pet, and with a tremendous yell his men rushed on the ene-’
my, whosupposed that Gates and his whole army were upon
them. “Ground your arms, or you are dead men I” cried
the captain, and the frightened guard were not slow in obey-
ing. Wlien it was too late to resist, they found, to their
mortiﬁcation, that they were prisoners to a party inferior in
number to themselves.

344. Burgoyne’s position was now critical in the extreme.
His men" were put on short allowance, and even then his
stock of provisions threatened to give out in a few days. The
vigilance of the Americans prevented supplies from reaching
him. Urgent messages for aid had been sent to Gen. Olin-
ton, at New York; but nothing had been heard from him
in reply. It was clear that the only hope for the British
army was in ﬁghting its way through the American ranks.

On the 7th of October, the British drew up in line of bat-
tle. After some skirmishing, the Americans commenced
the action by charging the enemy’s front. The British at
ﬁrst could not withstand their impetuous attack, but soon
rallied, and in turn drove back their assailants. So close

was the struggle that a single cannon was five times taken
and retaken by the contending parties. At length the pa
triots succeeded in retaining it; and Colonel Cilley [s7,'Z’-Z6],
after having leaped upon it and dedicated it to the Ameri-

can cause, wheeled it round upon the enemy and ﬁred on

them with their own ammunition. Not till their best ofﬁcers
had fallen, were the British ﬁnally driven back.

Meanwhile Gen. Frazer’s division had fallen on the Amer-
ican ﬂank. They were repelled by Morgan’s corps, which
then furiously charged the British right. At this point, Ar-
nold, who had been unjustly’ deprived of his command, and
was impatiently watching the progress of the battle, could
restrain himself no longer. Hastily mounting his large brown
horse, he spurred towards the hottest of the ﬁght. Gates,
fearing that» he would gain fresh laurels, sent Major Arm-
strong after him with orders to return. But Arnold was
already out of reach. He was received with shouts of ex-
ultation by the men whom he had before led to victory.
Witli a desperation akin to madness, he charged Frazer’s bri-
gade, now rallying under its intrepid commander. Perceiv-
ing that Frazer was the soul of the British army, Morgan
directed several of his riﬁemen to make him the special ob-
ject of their aim,  ball soon struck the general’s saddle;
another wounded his horse in the neck. Despite these warn-
ings, he refused to retire, and in a few moments fell, mortal-
ly wounded. ,

Frazer’s fall decided the battle. Burgoyne in vain tried
to rally his men. Driven from their intrenchments by Ar-
nold’s impetucus attack, they left the Germans at their side
unsupported. The latter gave one volley and fled. Arnold
received a ball in the same leg which had been mangled at
Quebec, and was here at last overtaken by  or Armstrong,
with Gates’ order to return. He did return, but not till he

called, George Guess. Seeing the books used by the mission-
aries, and being told that the characters they contained rep-
resented the sounds used in speaking, he set about making
an alphabet for his own tongue. Strange to say, without any
knowledge of other languages, he succeeded. Instead of
analyzing words into letters, he Went no further than sylla-
bles, and found that by eighty-ﬁve characters every Word in
his language could be represented. In European tongues, so
great is the variety of syllables that an alphabet of this kind
Would be next to useless; but in Cherokee, since there are
only eighty-ﬁve syllables used, it answers the purpose better

than an alphabet of letters. Printed. Cherokee words are

very short, for they contain only as many characters as there
are syllables in each; and a few days’ study will enable one
to read and write the language with ease. Syllabic alphabets
have since been invented for other Indian tongues.

32. _The Indian could not write, but he could convey his
thoughts imperfectly by hieroglyphics, like the Egyptians
and other ancient nations. Certain symbols were taken to
denote certain ideas; and these were" drawn or painted on
prepared skins or the inner bark of the white-birch, in a rude
manner, but still accurately enough to be understood by those
acquainted with the system. Hieroglyphics of this kind have
been found chiselled on rocks in different parts of the country.

38. The plate given below will serve as a specimen of In-»
dian picture-writing. Schoolcraft presents it as a copy of a
drawing made by two Indians whom he employed as guides,

when travelling from the St. Louis River to the Mississippi.

The bark containing these symbols was found attached to a
pole about nine feet high. It had been placed there by the
guides, for the purpose of informing any of their comrades
into whose hands it might fall that a party of fourteen white
men and two Indians had passed the night at that place.

who had kept himself all day in the camp. Night set in, and
the contest ceased. The Americans kept possession of the
ﬁeld, and Burgoyne fell back, with the intention of retreating
by way of Fort Edward. In this second battle of Stillwater,
he lost 700 men; the Americans, about 150.

345. Burgoyne soon found that retreat was impossible.
He was hemmed in on all sides; provisions were failing him;
and there was no prospect of assistance from New York.
A council of war held October 13th decided to capitulate.
While the officers were deliberating, grape-shot swept across
the table at which they were seated. On the 16th, the terms
were settled. The whole British army, consisting of 5,791
men, surrendered, With their arms and baggage, 42 cannon,
and a large quantity of ammunition. The news of this bril-
liant victory awakened fresh hope and courage in every
patriot breast.

took a circuitous route, crossed the creek higher up without

Stirling endeavored to stem the tide. La Fayette was
wounded and narrowly escaped capture. The timely arrival

of Grreene’s division (which made a memorable march of four.

miles in forty-two minutes) saved this part of the American
army from entire destruction. Wayne, who opposed the
British in front, was also driven back. The battle-of Bran-

Count Pulaski [pu-Zcts’-ice], a Polish noble, who had tried to
liberate his country from the Russian yoke. Failing in the
attempt, he had sought a new field on which to battle for
freedom. For his gallantry in this action Congress made
him a brigadier-general.

347. His defeat at Brandywine, did not prevent Washing-
ton from resolving on another battle; but a violent and pro-
tracted storm so injured his arms and ammunition that he
was obliged to give up the idea and retreat. Slowly and
wearily his men toiled over the miry roads, man-y of them

-having no shoes to protect their feet. A movement on the

part of the British, which threatened Reading [re0Z’-ding],
where the American stores were deposited, forced Washing-
ton to take a new position and leave the road to Philadelphia
open to the enemy. Gen. Wayne was stationed with 1,500
men to check their advance, but he was surprised by a mid-
night attack and driven back with the loss of nearly 300 men.
Philadelphia was thus left at the mercy of the British, and on
the 26th they entered the city in triumph. Eight days be-
fore, Congress had adjourned to meet at Lancaster. They
soon after removed to York, where they continued to hold
their sessions till the recovery of Philadelphia the following
year.

The British were now in pleasant quarters; but otherwise
they gained little by the capture of Philadelphia. The coun-
try was still unsubdued, and, as long as Howe was stationary,
was likely so to remain. Franklin in his usual witty way re-
marked, that instead of Howe’s having taken Philadelphia,
Philadelphia had taken Howe.

348. In the mean time, Washington was not idle. Having
received a reinforcement of 2,500 men, on the 4th of October

miles from Philadelphia [see Map, p. 249]. The Americans at

ﬁrst gained important advantages, and would have achieved
a victory had not some of the militia failed to perform the
part assigned them. A thick fog arose; the British rallied,

and ﬁnally repelled the assault. The American loss was es-

timated at 1,000 men, including Gen. Nash, of North Caro-
lina; that of the British was not far from 600. Shortly after
this repulse, Washington retired with his army to _White
Marsh, 14 miles from Philadelphia [see Map, p. 249]. The
sufferings of his men increased with the coldness of the
weather. .

349. The navigation of the Delaware was still in the hands
of the patriots. Several miles below Philadelphia, Fort Mifl
ﬂin, on Mud Island [see Map], commanded the channel;
and opposite to it, on the Jersey shore, was a strong fort at
Red Bank. Heavy timbers armed with iron bars pointing
down the river had been sunk near Fort Mifﬂin, to prevent
the passage of vessels. To open communication between his
army and ﬂeet, it was necessary for Howe to destroy these
defences. Batteries were erected on the Pennsylvania shore
opposite Mud Island, and a party was sent down on the Jer-
sey side to storm the works at Red Bank. They entered
the fort without opposition, and supposed that it was theirs,
but were soon apprised of their mistake by a well-directed
ﬁre, which mortally wounded their leader and disabled 400
of his men. The American commandant, unable to defend
the whole of the extensive works, had abandoned part of
them, and with this warm reception repulsed the A enemy.
The attack on Fort Miﬂin was at ﬁrst equally unsuccessful.
Two British vessels ran aground, one of which was aban-
doned by its crew, while the other was set on ﬁre by the
Americans. At length, however, the enemy reached such a
position that both garrisons were obliged to retire and ‘relin-
quish to them the command of the river.

350. The joyful news of Burgoyne’s surrender, received
about this time, served to relieve the depression occasioned
by Washington’s reverses. It roused Howe to additional
exertion. At midnight, December 2d, 1777, he held a coun-
cil of war at a house occupied by a Quaker named Darrah.
Mrs. Darrah, who Was a true friend of her country, suspected
that something important was going on ; and, silently rising
after retiring to bed, she overheard an order for the British
troops to start the following night for the purpose of surpri-
sing Washingtoii at W/Vhite Marsh. Returning to her room,
she feigned sleep, but spent the rest of the night in medita-
ting how she could save her countrymen. Not daring to
trust any one with her secret, she obtained a permit to pass
the British lines, on pretence of having to go to mill for a
bag of flour. The ground was covered with snow, but she
heeded it not, and hastening on met an American officer to
whom she delivered the important information. The next
night she observed the British marching forth on their expe-
dition. They silently approached the camp ofWashi11gton,
but to their astonishment found the whole American army
drawn up in readiness to receive them. For three days
Howe remained in the neighborhood, but Washiiigton would
not leave his intrenchments to give him battle. On Howe,’s
return to Philadelphia, Mrs. Darrah was closely examined,
as to whether any member of her family had been awake on
the night in question, but nothing was discovered.

351. The weather now rendered it necessary for Washing-
ton to withdraw ‘his army from the ﬁeld to permanent winter-
quarters. Thesehe ﬁxed at Valley Forge, on the southwest
side of the Schuylkill [sls00Z’-kill], 22 miles from Philadelphia.

want of proper food brought on putrid fevers and other fatal
disorders. The officers fared but little better than their
men. The paper money issued by Congress had depreciated
so much that the pay of a general Was hardly suiﬁcient to
keep him in clothes.

This lamentable state of things ﬁlled the breast ofWasl1-
ington with inexpressible anguish, which was increased by
the injustice of some of C his countrymen. The Pennsylvania
Legislature censured him for withdrawing his troops to win.~
ter-quarters. Congress wavered in its conﬁdence, and in
appointing a new board" of war gave a prominent place to
Gates, Conway, Mifﬂin, and others, known to be hostile to the
commander. Some even demanded that he should be super-
seded by Grates or Lee. Washington bore these unjust com-
plaints with patience, knowing that time would place things
in their true light. He was not wrong. The proposition to
remove him was met with indignant remonstrances from all
parts of the country; and Congress, ﬁnally convinced that
the blame rested with themselves for not making suitable
provisions, took measures for the proper equipment of an
efficient army.

353. Unbounded joy was soon diifused through America
by the news that France had at length (February 6, 177 8)
recognized the independence of the United States, and en»
tered into a treaty of alliance with its commissioners. This
was brought about by the unremitting labors of Franklin.
A general favorite at the French court, he hadembraced
every opportunity of proving to the king and ministry the
certainty of his country’s ultimate triumph in the struggle
with England. Burgoyne’s surrender furnished him with
an irresistible argument, and the long desired treaty wa
obtained. . '

854. The arrival of Baron Steuben threw another ray of
light on the gloom which overshadowed the patriot army at
Valley Forge. Steuben had served as aid-de-camp and
lieutenant-general under Frederick the Great, king of Prus-
sia. Congress gladly accepted his services, and found them
of immense value in organizing and disciplining the army.
In May, 1778, at Washington’s request, he was appointed
inspector-general, and the results of his experience were
soon apparent.

355. Washington attempted little during his melancholy
sojourn at Valley Forge. Towards the close of spring, 1778,
La Fayette was sent with 2,100 men to Barren Hill, on the
Schuylkill, twelve miles from Valley Forge, to keep the
foraging parties of the enemy in check, and to be ready for
action in case of any decided movement. With the conni-
vance of a tory, at whose house the marquis lodged, Howe
forthwith laid a plan to cut off the detachment. Fortu-

nately La Fayette discovered the scheme in time to defeat
it by a skilful retreat. Washington, who had observed
through a spy-glass the threatening movements of the ene-
my, could hardly restrain his joy when his beloved brother-
in—arms reached the camp in safety.  

356. The British ministry began to perceive, that, though
victories had been gained, little was really done_towards re-
ducing America, and the alliance with France rendered their
prospects for the future still worse. Accordingly commis-
sioners were sent over with liberal proposals, which would
have been accepted before the war commenced, but which
now came too late. Bribery was freely tried, but in vain.
Among those whom the commissioners ventured to approach
in this way was Gen. Reed, of Pennsylvania. Ten thousand
guineas and a proﬁtable post were offered him, if he would
use his inﬂuence to bring about a reconciliation. “ I am not
worth purchasing,” was the reply of the honest patriot ;
“but, such as I am, the king of Great Britain is not rich
enough to buy me.”

357. In March, 1778, the country received a severe blow
in the loss of Captain Nicholas Biddle, one of its ablest na-
val officers. After capturing a number of prizes in the U. S.
frigate Randolph, he encountered the Yarmouth [3/arm’-mut/L],
a British ship of 64 guns, and in the midst of the engage-
ment his vessel blew up. Captain Biddle and all his men,

358. ON the 24th of May, 1778, Gen. Howe, who had re»
quested the home government to recall him, left Philadel-
phia, after a splendid tournament given by his ofﬁcers in his
honor. About a month afterwards, Sir Henry Clinton, on
whom the chief command now devolved, evacuated the city
with the whole British army. Washington followed the
enemy across New Jersey. Contrary to the advice of some
of his oﬁicers, he resolved on a general engagement; and,
on the 28th of June, when the British were about leav-
ing Monmouth [mo77/-muzfh], they found the Americans
drawn up for b-attle. The attack was conducted by Lee,
who had been released by the British in exchange for Gen.
Prescott. After a series of mistakes, Lee, without any ap-
parent reason, began to fall back. The retreat soon turned
into a ﬂight. The Americans were hurrying over a morass,
sinking iii the mire, and falling before their pursuers, when
they were met by Washington at the head of the rear line.
Angrily rebuking Lee, the American commander arrested
the flight of his broken regiments, and led them back against
the enemy. _

The British were stopped in their successful career. Lee
fought throughout the rest of the action with desperate cour-»
age, and many deeds of valor were performed on both sides.
The gallant conduct of Mary Pitcher, the wife of an American
artillery-man, must not be forgotten. While bringing water
to her husband from a spring, she saw him fall, and heard,
an order given for withdrawing his gun, as there was no one
to manage it. The heroic woman immediately took her

communicated vvith each other. They also sometimes re-
corded important public events for the beneﬁt of future ages
by engraving symbolic characters on rocks and trees. But

since, with their imperfect tools, this was a laborious process,

it was seldom done; and, therefore, the Indians knew little

of their past history except What Was learned from oral tradi-

husband’s place, and discharged his duty in a way that elicit-
ed the warmest admiration. Washington afterwards ap-
pointed her a sergeant in the army, and she was well known
by both French and Americans, who honored her with the
appellation of “Captain Molly”. ,

After a severe contest, in which now one party and now
the other had the advantage, the Americans remained mas-
ters of the ﬁeld. They passed the night on it with the in-
tention of renewing the battle in the morning, Washington
resting among his men with no other bed than his cloak;
but Clinton silently departed three hours before dawn. The
total loss of the British was about 500, 59 of whom fell from
the excessive heat; that of the Americans Was 229. Clin-
ton’s army proceeded to Sandy Hook, and was thence con-
veyed by the ﬂeet to New York. Washington crossed the
Hudson, and ﬁxed his quarters at White Plains.

Oifended by the rebuke he had received, Lee, the day
after the battle, sent an insulting letter to Washington. The
latter had him arrested for disobeying orders, and disgrace-
fully retreating. A court-martial, of which Lord Stirling
was president, found him guilty, and suspended him from
his command for a year. His interest in the cause of lib-
erty was thus ‘abated, and he never rejoined the army.

' 359. In July [1778], a French ﬂeet, conveying a strong
land force, under Count D’Estaing [ales-zfct-cm-g’], arrived off
the coast of Virginia. Measures were concerted for besieg-
ing the British at Newport, R. I., and D’Estaing entered
the harbor early in August. Before operations had fairly
commenced, Admiral Byron approached Newport with a
British ﬂeet. D’Estaing sailed forth to meet the enemy, but
a terriﬁc storm separated the combatants. Byron made for
New York, and the French returned to Newport. Mean-

ated the ﬂeets, swept the shore in all its fury. It is still
remembered in Rhode Island as “the great storm”. Tents
Were blown down, stores destroyed, and the works damaged.
On the return of the French ﬂeet, Sullivan recommenced
operations ; but his hopes were soon blasted by an announce-
ment from D’Estaing that he was going to Boston to reﬁt
his vessels. The remonstrances of La Fayette and Greene
were ineffectual; and Sullivan, thus deserted, was compelled
to raise the siege. On the 29th of August, he repelled with
intrepidity an attack of the British; but, finding himself in
danger of being cut off, he eifected a masterly retreat by
night, without the knowledge of the enemy. The close of
the eastern campaign thus left both parties in the same con-
dition in which they were at its beginning.

360. The frontier of New York and Pennsylvania, since
the dispersion of the Indians at Fort Schuyler, had been
comparatively secure from their depredations; but in 17 7 8,
it was again ravaged. At the solicitation of British agents,
a body of Iroquois joined a band of tories under Col. John
Butler, and advanced towards Wy-o’-ming. This settlement
lay in the beautiful valley of the Susquehannah. It contained
a population of several thousand, but had contributed so
largely to the patriot army that few able-bodied men were
left for its defence. As the ruthless invaders approached,
fearful accounts of their barbarity were received. The wo-
men and children ﬂocked from the surrounding region to a
fort near the present site of VVilkesbarre [wiZlcs’-biir-re], and
300 men with a few boys, under Zebulon Butler (no relation
of the British colonel’s), advanced to meet the enemy.

was misunderstood, and the unfortunate word “ retreat” wa.s
passed along the lines. T Panic seized the soldiers, and a gen-
eral ﬂight ensued. Many were shot and tomahawked as
they ran; some threw themselves into the river; a few es»
caped to the fort, where the helpless women Were screaming
with terror. That night the Indians held possession of the
battle-ﬁeld, and tortured their prisoners with all the cruel-
ties that savage cunning could invent. Captain Bidlack was
thrown alive on burning-coals, and kept there with pitch-
forks till he expired. Six prisoners were ranged near a stone
on the river bank, and held by savages, while Queen Esther,
an old Seneca half-breed, walked round them in a circle,
singing the death-song like aninfuriated demon, and striking
them with her club and hatchet till every man was killed.
The stone is still called Queen Esther’s rock. i

The next day the fort was invested. It was surrendered

to the British leader on his promise to protect its defenceless

occupants; but no sooner were the savages admitted than
they glutted their thirst for blood by tomahawking and
scalping all whom they met. The unfortunate people of
VVyoming were compelled to ﬂee from their once happy val-
ley to distant and securer settlements. Few survived the
horrors of the ﬂight. Some escaped the Red Man’s knife,
only to find a slower death ,, from exposure and fatigue.
Others, dragging their weary limbs they knew not Whither,
lost their way on the mountains or hid in caverns till star-
vation ended their sufferings. Distracted mothers hurried
their children through the wilderness, and, when their little
ones fainted on the way and died, folded the li_feless bodies
to their hearts, and bore them many a toilsome mile to
save them from the hungry wolves. Lovely Wyoming was
desolate.

tion with a band of tories, suddenly fell upon the settlement,
and killed or carried off most of its inhabitants. The country
around was ravaged for miles, and the tories vied with their
savage allies in cold-blooded ferocity towards their unfortu-
nate victims. .

861. In November, 1778, Clinton determined to change
the scene of his operations to the south, and dispatched 2,000
men under Lieutenant—colonel Campbell [cam/-el] and a fleet
under Admiral Hyde Parker against Savannah. The city
was held by Gen. Robert Howe, with 900 men, who, though
ill prepared for battle, made a brave resistance. The appear:
ance on their rear of a body of New York tories, guided by
a negro, obliged them to retreat; and during this movement
100 men fell and 453 were taken. Admiral Parker crowded
the latter, with others who refused to join the royal army,
on board of ‘prison-ships; many of them perished and became
the food of crows and buzzards. The whole of Eastern
Georgia was speedily subdued.

862. About the time of the massacre at Wyoming an ex-
pedition was undertaken against the western tribes by Gen.
Clarke, of Virginia. Having seized Kaskaskia,,l1e induced
the Indians to take an oath of allegiance to Virginia, and the
county of Illinois was organized as part of that state. The

British governor of Detroit, hearing of this, invaded the

country in December, 1778. Appearing before the Ameri-
can post at Vincennes, he demanded its surrender. Captain
Helm, who commanded the station, holding a smoking match
over his single cannon, demanded that the garrison should
have the most favorable terms. The British commander as-
sented, but was somewhat mortiﬁed to ﬁnd, on entering the
fort, that he had granted the honors of war to two men, who
were its only occupants. I

363. AT the commencement of the year 17 7 9, the British
army in the south consisted of 3,000 effective men, under the
command of Gen. Pre-vost’. They Were opposed by Lincoln,
with a force smaller than the enemy’s and far inferior to them
in discipline and equipments. Prevost began the campaign
by attempting the conquest of South Carolina. A body of
regulars Was sent to take possession of Port Royal Island,
but Was driven back by Gen. Moultrie. Soon after, a party
of 700 tories on their march to the British army were de-
feated by Col. Pickens; and some of their leaders, Who fell
into the hands of the Americans, were tried and executed
as traitors. ’

Encouraged by this success, Lincoln sent Gen. Ashe to
take a favorable position at the conﬂuence of Briar Creek
and the Savannah. Shortly after his arrival, a party of Brit-
ish crossed the creek some miles above and surprised the

American camp. Most of the militia threw down their arms
and ﬂed. Some escaped by swimming, but over 300 were
killed and taken. The British commander now regarded
Georgia as completely subdued, and ﬁlled the various state
ofﬁces with partisans of the king. Gen. Lincoln was trying
to recover the ground thus unfortunately lost, when a move-
ment of the enemy towards Charleston obliged him to march
hastily in that direction. Pulaski’s “American legion”, and
Governor Rutledge with a strong body of militia threw
themselves into the city, and held it till Lincoln’s approach
forced the besieging army to retire. The heat soon became
so intense that both parties gave up active operations till
October. _

364. ‘During Prevost’s incursion, the whig families in the
neighborhood of Charleston suffered much from the brutality
and rapacity of his soldiers. Plantations were devastated.
Money, jewels, and plate were carried off; slaves were stolen,
to be sold in the West Indies; and what could not be taken
away was destroyed. On St. John’s Island, the family of a
Mr. Gibbs were driven from their house. In the midst of
rain and ﬂying bullets, they made their way to some negro»
cabins, where it was discovered that a little boy had been
forgotten. A girl of thirteen years offered to return for the
child. Obtaining entrance with difficulty, she found the ob—
ject of her search in the third story, bore him off through a
shower of balls, and reached her friends uninjured. The boy
thus saved was known in the war of 1812 as Gren. Fenwick.

Mrs. Willzinson has left us an’ account of a visit made to
her house on Young’s Island, 30 miles from Charleston, by a
band of the enemy. They plundered the estate, drove away
the horses, tore the buckles worn by the ladies of the house
from their shoes, and rudely plucked the rings from their
ﬁngers. Mrs. ‘Wilkinson begged them to leave her a few in-
dispensable articles of clothing, but received only curses in

365. The Winter of 17 78-7 9 was passed by the northern
American army at Middlebrook, N. J. In preparing for the
spring campaign, VVashington found both the men and offi-
cers of the New Jersey brigade disposed to abandon the
service in consequence of the backwardness of Congress in
paying them and providing for their Wants. Their beloved

can messengers had to take a circuit of many miles in bearing
communications between the east and south; Washington,
therefore, determined to recover them, and intrusted the
difficult enterprise to Gen. Wayne. On the 15th of July,
Wayne’s detachment of light infantry mustered 14 miles be-
low Stony Point. The day was spent in marching through
narrow deﬁles and over ragged rocks. At eight in the even-
ing, they halted about a mile from the fort. From this point
they were guided by a negro named Pompey, who was in the
habit of visiting the garrison after his day’s work to sell them
strawberries. Accompanied by one or two of Wayne’s ad-
vanced guards, Pompey boldly approached the outposts, and
gave the countersign, while his companions, watching their
opportunity, seized and gagged the sentinels.

Thus the Americans reached the base of the bluff undis-
covered. The fort, as they gazed up at it, seemed almost
impregnable. It lay on a rocky height, accessible only by a
steep and narrow path. At half past eleven Wayne’s army
commenced the ascent. They were not observed till within
a few feet of the pickets. Here they received several shots,

but pressed forward with the bayonet. The roll of the

drum roused the sleeping garrison, and quick discharges of
cannon and musketry met the advancing columns. Wayne
was wounded, and bade his aids carry him forward that he
might die at the head of his men. He soon found, however,
that his injury was not mortal. His comrades pressed gal-
lantly on, and the British were obliged to surrender. Their
loss amounted to 63 killed and 543 made prisoners. Wayne
had but 15 killed and 83 wounded. The next morning, the
cannon were turned on the works at Verplanck’s Point. But
before any impression was made on them, Wayne, fearing
an attack from New York, destroyed the fort and beat a
retreat. Congress had a gold medal struck in honor of this
brilliant achievement.

367. About this time, the merciless Tryon was sent to New
Haven, with 2,500 men, to burn the shipping in that port.
The militia rallied in its defence, but were driven back, and
several vessels, together with large quantities of. military and
naval stores, were destroyed. Tryon then visited Fairﬂeld,
Norwalk, and Greenwich, all of which he reduced to ashes.

368. The massacres of VVyoming and Cherry Valley were
still fresh in the memory of the Americans; and in August
Gen. Sullivan was sent, With nearly 5,000 men, to punish the
Iroquois by destroying their villages and devastating their
country. On the Ti-o’-ga River he was met by the Indians
in full force under Brant, and a band of tories headed by Sir
John Johnson. They had thrown up works in European
style, and bravely defended them till the Americans gained
some high ground on their ﬂank, when they gave way in
confusion. Fleeing to swamps and forests, the Red Men left
their pleasant villages and luxuriant corn-ﬁelds, from the Sus-
quehannah to the Genesee, entirely at the mercy of the in-
vaders. Fearful was the vengeance inﬂicted. Whole villa-
ges were given to the ﬂames. AtIVyoming, no mercy was
shown but the hatchet; here, none but the ﬂrebrand. On
the 14th of September Sullivan reached the metropolis of the
Genesee valley; 128 buildings and 160,000 bushels of corn
were there destroyed. The whole region was swept as
by a tornado; and the terrible vengeance of “the Town-
destroyer”, as they called Washington, was never forgotten.

369. On the 1st of September, Count D’Estaing, who had
gained some victories in the West Indies, appeared off Sa~
vannah with his ﬂeet. The British under Prevost were still
in possession of the city, and Gen. Lincoln hastened to co-
operate with the French against them. Prevost was sum-
moned to surrender by the French admiral, but was unwise~

strengthening his defences, the British commandant ﬁna.lly
announced his determination to hold the city. A heavy
cannonade was opened by the besiegersf The town suffered
severely. The inhabitants were driven to their cellars, and
ventured in the streets only at the peril of their lives. Pre-
vost could not have held out more than ten days; but the

restless D’Estaing was in a hurry to leave, and gave the  

Americans their choice, either to raise the siege or carry the
place by storm. Though it was risking a victory already
certain, Lincoln would not allow his‘ allies to depart, but de-
clared himself ready for the attack.

On the 9th of October, the French and Americans ad-
vanced against the British works in three divisions. r They
were received with a heavy ﬁre, which mowed down whole
platoons, and wounded the French leader. Still they pressed
on, and the ﬂags of France and South Carolina were soon
waving from the parapet. In a moment the men who placed
them there fell by a discharge of musketry. Sergeant Jas-
per, the hero of Fort Moultrie, beheld the ﬂag of his state
in the act of falling; springing forward, he ﬁxed it securely
on the parapet, and fell, mortally wounded, in the act. Just
then a charge of fresh troops from the garrison swept the
assailants from the works.

In other parts the attack was equally unsuccessful. The
gallant Pulaski, one of America’s noblest defenders, rushing
forward with the consecrated banner placed in his hand by
Moravian nuns, was struck down by a cannon-ball, to rise
no more. His followers were driven from the ﬁeld; and the

"British obtained a complete victory. Lincoln wished to re-
new the attack; but D’Estaing refused to do so, and with-»

drew his ﬂeet. The American general, mortiﬁed at the fail-
ure of an enterprise, which nothing but the caprice of his
ally had defeated, led his diminished army to Charleston.

then truth, the Red Man relied implicitly on Whatever he
had thus received. _

The Muscogee account of the Deluge may be taken as an
example of the mixture of truth and error in Indian tradi-
tions. It places that event before the creation of man, and
represents two pigeons as having been sent forth in search of
land while most of the earth was still covered with water.
At ﬁrst they were unsuccessful; but, on having gone forth
again, they brought back a blade of grass, and soon after the
waters subsided, and land appeared. This tribe believe that
their ancestors always lived in some part of North America.
They deny that any nation more civilized than themselves
ever occupied the country before them. According to their
traditions, they conquered a people who Were journeying to
the south, but were never themselves conquered until their
conflicts with the whites. Before the arrival of the latter,
they enjoyed ‘a greater degree of peace than ever afterwards,
and were less afflicted with disease. Such traditions, it will
be seen, tell us little about the history of the country before
its discovery by_Columbus, I

85. The language of the Indian, in ordinary conversation
as well as formal speeches, was liighlyﬁgurative and often
sublime. Familiar with nature in all her variety and majesty,
the Red Man delighted in drawing his ‘ﬁgures from the ob»
jects which she presented. If he wished to express the idea
of . prosperity, he would speak of a brilliant sun; adversity
he would represent by lowering clouds; to proclaim war was

to dig up the tomahawk ; to make peace was to smoke the

calumet. Many Indian chiefs were as distinguished for their
eloquence as for their courage. Their delivery was anima-
ted, digniﬁed, and forcible; their gesticulation, graceful and
natural. Some of their speeches have scarcely been surpassed
by the greatest efforts of civilized orators.

land, he early embarked in the naval service of tlie United
States, and was the ﬁrst to unfurl the banner of the Republic
on the Delaware. The capture of 16 prizes in little more
than six weeks proved his activity and prowess. In 17 7 8,
he enlarged his sphere of operations, and kept the coast of
Scotland and England in constant alarm. Boldly entering

the harbor of Wliiteliaven, he took two forts, and ﬁred the ,

shipping they protected. Hurrying from point to point,
wherever a prize was to be taken, or a daring deed to be
achieved, he seemed everywhere present and always invin-
cible. In September, 1779, in the Bon Homme Richard
[60-mom’ re-3/LCM] (good mom Ric/lard), of 40 guns, accom-
panied by the Alliance and several smaller vessels, Jones en-
countered, off the coast of Scotland, a British merchant ﬂeet
returning from the Baltic under convoy of two frigates.
The commander of the Serapis, a 44-gun frigate, bore down
on the Americans, and one of the most terrible actions re-
corded in naval history followed. Jones, that the enemy
might have no advantage from the superior size of their guns,
brought his vessel so close to the Serapis that their sides
touched. Broadside after broadside was poured in by both
parties. The Serapis was soon in ﬂames, and the Bon

after first giving her consort a broadside by mistake, turned
her guns on the enemy. The Serapis struck. Her ﬂames were
arrested, and Jones, ﬁnding that his own vessel was sinking,
hastily transferred his crew to the captured frigate. Of 37 5
men, with whom he had begun the action, 300 were either

hold out as long as possible. A destructive ﬁre was at once
commenced by the enemy.

General Hu’-ger had been stationed near the head of Ash-
ley River with a body of cavalry. On the 14th of April
his detachment was surprised and dispersed by Tarleton.
Four days after, Cornwallis arrived from New York with
3,000 additional men. An incessant cannonade was main-
tained, and the condition of the inhabitants was deplorable
in the extreme. Cannon balls were continually ﬂying through
the air, shells exploding, buildings falling, and flames crack-
ling. It was impossible to hold out longer. On the 12th
of May, articles of capitulation Were signed. Four frigates,
400 pieces of artillery, and 5,000 Americans, of whom the
garrison constituted about one-half, thus fell into the hands
of the enemy. ~

372. The British followed up their success at Charleston
with active measures for completing the subjugation of South
Carolina. Crarrisons were stationed at different points, and
2,000 men were dispatched towards North Carolina to over-
awe the Whigs in that direction. Tarleton, with 700 horse-
men, overtook a party of retreating Americans under Col.

Bu’ -ford at Waxhaws, and put them to the sword while ask-

ing quarter. For a time the patriots of Carolina seemed
paralyzed. Many consented to recognize the kings author-
ity, on condition that they would not be required to serve
in the war; and Clinton, believing that South Carolina was
“ again entirely English”, left Cornwallis in command of the
southern army, and returned to New York. .
373. ‘Soon after his departure, the overbearing conduct of
the British, and their violation of the terms of the surrender,
opened the eyes of the people, and awakened a determined
spirit of resistance. Some of the principal citizens of Charles-
ton were seized and imprisoned. More than a thousand per-

sons were deprived of their property and driven from their
homes. Reports of these outrages were not long in spread-
ing over the state, and no stronger argument against ma-

king terms with the enemy was needed. Sumter, Wynn, .

and others, organized parties, with the determination of keep-
ing the ﬁeld till their country was free. Living in the woods
on the precarious food they afforded, ready for march or
battle at a moment’s notice, these brave hearts were the
scourge of the British and tories,-—appearing when least ex-
pected, cutting off straggling parties, swooping down on the
rear of their armies, always fearless and generally victorious.
Sometimes they met the enemy with but three rounds of am-
munition to each man ; and often part of a company took
the ﬁeld unprovided with arms, waiting to obtain those of
their companions who should fall.

374. In June, 17 80, Cornwallis dispatched a party of cav-
alry and tories to crush some of these troublesome rebels.
On the way, they stopped at the house of a Mrs. Bratton, and
asked where her husband was. “In Sumter’s army,” was
the reply. Incensed at this avowal, the commander was
prevented from killing her only by the solicitation of a bro-
ther officer. During the night, the patriots in the neighbor-
hood learned of the arrival of the enemy. A small force assem-
bled, and the British were captured. Among the prisoners
was an officer, on whom, for previous offences, sentence of
death was pronounced. As a last favor, he begged to be
led into the presence of Mrs. Bratton. Recognizing him as
her preserver, she interceded in his behalf, and his life was
granted to her prayers.

cis Marion, a descendant of the Huguenots of South Carolina,
who had served in early life against the Cherokees, and sub-
sequently at Fort Sullivan and Charleston. While hastening

and boys, some white and others black. Their wretched
clothing gained for them the name of “the ragged regi-
ment”, and led the proud Gates, who had just been appoint-
ed to the command of the southern department, to dispense
with their services in the regular army, and send them to the
interior of Carolina. Though Gates was ashamed of “the
ragged regiment”, their gallant leader was not. Increasing
their number from time to time, as circumstances allowed,
he achieved with their aid a series of minor though brilliant
victories. .

Still Cornwallis remained master of South Carolina.
Camden [see Map, p. 286] was his principal rendezvous in
the upper country, and thither the tories ﬂocked. Mean-
while the American army just alluded to was slowly ap-
proaching. Its command had been intrusted to the veteran
De Kalb; but, towards the end of July, Gen. Gates super-
seded De Kalb by the appointment of Congress. Elated by
his former success, Gates resolved to strike a decisive blow,
and pushed rapidly on, though his men were suffering much
from sickness and scarcity of food. As he advanced, the
British outposts fell back on Camden ; and by the middle of
August the two armies lay encamped within a short distance
of each other, ready for battle. H

376. The hopes of southern patriots were revived by the
news of Gates’ approach. A number of farmers, hunters,
and others, who were tired of the British yoke, quickly ap-

peared in the ﬁeld; and Sumter, who was called to their

command, soon found himself at the head of 600 men. With
these he dispersed several bodies of the enemy near the Great
Pe-dee’. On the 6th of August, he attacked a large detach-
ment at Hanging Rock. The powder used on this occasion
was saved by the heroism of two women. It had been

stored in a house occupied by Mrs. Thomas with her daugh-
ter and son-in-law, which was attacked by a party of the en-
emy. Aware that Sumter’s army would be powerless if the
ammunition were taken, they determined to defend it to the
last extremity. The doors were barricaded. The two wo-
men loaded guns, and the son-in—law discharged them with
such rapidity and effect, that the British supposed a body of
men to be posted there, and gave up the attack. The pow-
der was saved, but there was only enough to afford each
man two charges. With this small allowance, the battle of
Hanging Rock was commenced. Fortunately the tories ﬂed
early in the action, and the ammunition they left behind en-
abled Sumter’s men to repel the bayonets of the British.
Nothing but the arrival of reinforcements saved the latter
from total defeat.

Among the boys who began a brave career under Sum-
ter in the battle of Hanging Rock, was Andrew Jackson, not
yet fourteen years of age. He and his brother were soon
afterwards captured, but in the spring of 1781 they were set
free by an exchange of prisoners. Both were sick with small-
pox at the time; Andrew survived, his brother died. The

- account they gave of the sufferings of their countrymen on

the prison-ships in Charleston harbor induced their widowed
mother, with a few other intrepid women, to visit them, at
the risk of insult and danger, with food, clothing, and medi-
cine. Having contracted the fatal prison fever on board one
of the ships, Mrs. Jackson died on her return, a short dis-

. tance from Charleston, a martyr to the heroic spirit which

animated the daughters of Carolina in “ the times that tried
men’s souls”. The young Andrew, thus left without a single
relative in the land of his birth, devoted much of his life
from this time to the service of his country, who afterwards
rewarded his fidelity with the highest ofiice in her gift.

Charleston to Camden to take command of the army, which
had been left under Lord Rawdon. Eight hundred men
were too sick to take the ﬁeld. A still larger number in the
American ranks were unﬁt for service from the same cause;

. so that, after sending the sick with his extra stores and lug-

gage to Waxliaws, Gates found he had but 8,663 men in his
camp. With this force drawn up in order of battle, at ten

o’clocl< on the night of August 15 [1 7 80], he set out in pro-

found silence, in the hope of surprising the enemy.

By a singular coincidence, Cornwallis had formed the same
design; and about the time that Grates marched for Camden,
he left his quarters to surprise the American camp. Neither
party was aware of the other’s movements; and, at two on
the morning of the 16th, much to their surprise, the hostile
forces met. The discovery was made on both sides at the
same moment, and ﬁring immediately commenced. The in-
terval till daylight was employed in preparing for a general
engagement. Hardly had the battle begun, when part of the
American militia, quailing before the terrible ﬁre to which
they were exposed, threw down their arms and ﬂed. In vain
the regulars nobly seconded the efforts of the intrepid De
Kalb; they were forced to give way before the superior dis-
cipline of the British regiments. Tarleton’s cavalry com-

pleted the rout, and strewed the road for miles with dying

and dead. The defeat at Camden cost the Americans great
quantities of stores, and nearly 2,000 men, killed, wounded,
and captured. De Kalb, the friend of La Fayette and fellow-
suﬁ"erer with Washiiigton at Valley Forge, fell in the battle,
pierced with eleven wounds, and died a prisoner three days
afterwards. A lieutenant, who threw his arms round his
commander to save him from the bayonets ‘of the foe," was
himself mortally wounded. Forty-ﬁve years after the death
of De Kalb, a’ monument was erected to his memory at Cam-
den, the corner-stone of which was la.id by La Fayette.

Gates was unable to rally his men. Over dreary miles of
swamp and pine-barrens they held their ﬂight. Many who
had before been wavering, now hastened to show their devo-
tion to the king and secure a share of the spoils by joining
in the pursuit. At last, harassed and exhausted, the rem-
nants of the defeated army found refuge in Charlotte, N. C.;
and there, after a time, Gates was superseded by Gen. Greene.

37 8. Carolina was now completely at the mercy of the
British. Sumter, after capturing some stores at Wa-te1'—ee’
Ford, was surprised by the active Tarleton, and lost most of
his men. Marion retired to his forest fastnesses, but was still
the scourge of hostile parties, on whom he fell when they
deemed themselves most secure. For a timethis gallant
partisan and 0 his men were the only active defenders of
American liberty in the south.

379. During the year 1780, Congress was continually ha1n-
pered in its action by a want of money. At the commence-
ment‘ of the war, the feeble colonies, having no funds at
command, had been obliged to issue bills of credit, for the
payment of which they pledged the public faith. The cause
of liberty required constant -advances; and in 1780 it was
found that no less than $200,000,000 of continental money
(as it was called) was in circulation. .

At first the bills passed at par, that is for the full sum
which they promised to pay; but, as Congress kept issuing
large amounts, which they could not‘ redeem with gold or
silver, people would not take them, except at a great discount,
or allowance. Thus, in "April, 1780, one silver dollar was
worth forty in continental bills; and soon afterwards no less
than $7 5 in bills was given for one in specie. A pair of boots
at this time sold for $600 continental money. To injure still
more the credit of Congress, the British ﬂooded the country

with counterfeit bills, which it was impossible to distinguish
from those that were genuine. At last no one would take
continental money on any terms; those who had it on hand
were plunged in the greatest distress, and all business was
paralyzed. In this desperate state of affairs, a few noble-
hearted patriots stepped forward to the relief of their suffer-
ing country. Robert Morris, with the aid of some inﬂuential

fellow-citizens, established a bank in Philadelphia, which was ’

found so useful that Congress pledged the faith of the United
States to sustain it, and in 1781 established the bank of North
America on the same basis, intrusting Mr. Morris with its
management. , I

380. The noble efforts of the women of our country must
not be forgotten. Wishing to do all in their power for the
holy cause, they organized societies and made up large quan-
tities of clothing with their _own hands for the suffering sol-
diers. Particularly was this done in Philadelphia, where Dr.
Franklin’s daughter and the wife of Gen. Joseph Reed took
a prominent part in the movement. No less than $7,500
worth of clothing was thus contributed; and many a needy
and ragged soldier invoked a blessing on the tender-hearted
Women of the Clear land for Which he fought, when he was
enabled, through their labors, to exchange his tattered gar-
ments for a warm and comfortable suit.

lief afforded from time to time by public-spirited men, it was
found diﬂicult to provide food for the soldiers; and, as their
terms expired, they withdrew from the service. When,
therefore, a French ﬂeet, which had been sent to the aid of
America through the inﬂuence of La Fayette, arrived at‘
Newport, on the 13th of July, Washington had neither the
men nor the supplies necessary for cooperating with it. Be-
fore he was ready to take the ﬁeld, the arrival of a strong
British ﬂeet at New York made the enemy once more mas-
ters of the sea, and kept the Americans and their allies from
active operations.

382. Hardly had the hopes of Washington been thus‘ dis-=
appointed when a blow was struck at the cause of liberty in
a quarter where it was least expected. Gen. Arnold, whose
services at Quebec, Stillwater, and elsewhere, we have men-
tioned in high terms, had been placed in command at Phila-»
delphia after its evacuation by the British, but had there
been guilty of dishonesty and made himself generally offen-
sive to the inhabitants. By order of Congress, he was tried
before a court-martial, and, in compliance with its verdict,
was reprimanded by Washington. This punishment, though
well deserved, excited in Arnold’s soul a ﬁerce thirst for venz»
geance, and left him no rest till he had devised a plan for
betraying his country to the enemy. Professing unaltered.
attachment to the cause he had defended with his blood, he
solicited the command of West Point, at that time the most
important post in the hands of the Americans. Having re-
ceived the desired appointment in consideration of his pre-
vious services, he forthwith proposed to Gen. Clinton to
betray the fortress into his hands. Clinton, who believed
that the loss of this post would put an end to “the rebellion”,
gladly listened to the offer, and sent Major Andre to confer
with the traitor on the conditions of the surrender.

26 ABORIGINAL REMAINS.

CHAPTER IV.
ABORIGINAL REMAINS.

36. ALLUsIoN has been made to relics of the aborigines,
found in different parts of the country. These may be di-
vided into two classes :—ﬁrst, those of more recent origin,
evidently the work of an uncivilized people, such as orna-
ments, rude weapons, and imperfect utensils; and secondly,
those which, from their ingenious design and superior ﬁnish,
must be attributed to a race far above the savage state.
These consist chieﬂy of stone and metallic implements, ﬁnely
wrought pottery, mounds, and the remains of walls andfor-
tiﬁcations,—-all showing a high degree of mechanical skill,
of which the Indian, as long as he has been known to Euro-
peans, has never proved himself capable.

37. Most of the metallic remains are of copper, well plated,
in a few instances, with silver. . Bracelets, medals, arrow-
heads, and pipe—bowls, of the former metal, have been found
at great depths below the surface of the earth. At Marietta,
Ohio, in’ a mound which had become. partly undermined by
a stream, a silver cup was discovered, with a regular and

polished surface, ﬁnely gilt on the inside. Isinglass mirrors"

have also been dug up in various places.
38. Numerous remains of ancient pottery have been

brought to light, which equal the best specimens of modern

manufacture. They are tastefully moulded, ﬁnely glazed,
and colored in a superior manner. Entire vessels, as well as
numerous fragments, have been discovered many feet be-
neath the surface, where they must have lain for centuries.
At Nashville, Tennessee, a circular vessel was found by some
workmen, resting on a rock at a depth of twenty feet. The
bottom rounded upwards, and terminated at the summit in

sloop-of-war, landed in the evening a few miles below West
Point, and shortly after midnight was met by Arnold in a
thicket near the shore. Here the details of their scheme
were discussed in whispers ; but morning dawned before
theyihad ﬁnished, and they withdrew to a house within the
American lines. In the course of the morning [September
22nd] the terms were settled. Arnold was to receive £10,000
and the rank of brigadier-general in the British army. Clin-
ton was to ascend the river and appear before West Point,
which would be given up after a show of resistance. Plans
of the work and a statement of its condition were given to
Andre, who concealed them in his stockings. The bargain

reached the neighborhood of Tarrytown in safety [see Map,

he was stopped by three patriots, John Paulding, Isaac Van

already mentioned. Refusing to release him, even for ten
thousand guineas, they bore him to the nearest American
post. The officer there in command, not suspecting Arnold,
sent Andre to his quarters with a letter explaining why he
was detained; but, on consultation with others, the order
was countermanded. Andre was taken to North Salem,
whence he wrote to Washington, informing him of his name
and rank, and the circumstances in which he was placed.
On the morning of Andre’s arrest, Arnold expected Wash-
ington at his quarters; but, as the latter did not arrive, he
sat down to breakfast with his family. While there, a letter
was placed in hishands, announcing Andre’s capture. Call-
ing his wife up-stairs, he told her that they must part at
once, perhaps forever, and bade her a hasty adieu. Mrs.
Arnold, who was unacquainted with her husband’s treacher-
ous designs, dismayed "at his words, fell fainting to the floor.
Hastily kissing his infant boy, who lay asleep in the cradle,

the traitor left the house by an unfrequented «path, and es»-

caped in his barge to the Vulture, which lay a few miles be-
low. Here he not only refused to give the boatmen their
fee, but even oifered to surrender them as prisoners to the
British. The captain of the Vulture, however, despising his
meanness, paid the men and let them go.

Washington presently arrived at the Robinson house, and,

not ﬁnding Arnold, crossed to West Point. Here he was

equally unsuccessful. Returning to Robinson’s, he soon had
an explanation of Arnold’s absence in the news of Andre’s
capture and the papers found on his person. Unfortunately,
it was too late to arrest the traitor. A letter was shortly
after received from him, soliciting protection for his wife.
It found her frantic with despair at her husband’s disgrace.
She was treated kindly by the American oflicers, and allowed
to rejoin the unworthy object of her affection.

ing that he was a spy, inasmuch as he had entered the Amer-

court, however, after long deliberation, pronounced him a
spy, and sentenced him to death-. Andre was a brave, amia-
ble, and accomplished man; and his sentence, though just,
excited the sympathies of Americans as well as British. Clin-
ton tried every means to effect his release. Washington pro-
posed to exchange him for Arnold ; but, gladly as the British
general would have done this, he felt that he could not hon-
orably break his faith even with a traitor, and reluctantly
declined the offer. The sentence was carried into effect on
the 2nd of October. Andre showed no fear of death, but

, asked to be shot, instead of hanged. Even this last request

Wasliiiigton felt compelled to refuse. The remains of the

with a silver medal and a pension of $200 a year. A

884. Washiiigton could not give up the hope of punishing
Arnold for his perﬁdy, and with the aid of Maj or Lee laid a
plan to capture him. A Virginian named John Champe un-
dertook the dangerous enterprise, which Was kept a profound
secret. Champe left the American camp late at night. An
alarm was given; but Lee, aware of the cause, managed" to
give the pretended deserter sufficient time to make good his
escape to a British boat. He played his part so well that he
was received without the least suspicion into Arnold’s legion
of loyalists and deserters. The traitor’s quarters were in
the lower part "of Broadway, New York. Champe’s plan
was to seize him in the garden back of his house, gag him,
and convey him in a boat across the river. He was prevent»
ed from executing it by Arnold’s accidentally changing his
quarters. Compelled to accompany his regiment to Vir-
ginia, he at last found an opportunity of rejoining his old
companions, among whom the story of his risks awakened
no little interest. Arnold received the promised reward,
and wreaked his malice on America by devastating different
parts of the country ; but, on his arrival in England, he was
treated with universal contempt. In his native country, his
name was always mentioned with detestation. “ I was born
in America,” said Arnold years afterwards to a French states-
man, “I lived there to the prime of my life; but, alas! I
can call no man in America my friend.”

385. After his success at Camden, Cornwallis proceeded
to overrun North. Carolina. Advancing as far as Charlotte,
he waited for Major ‘Ferguson, who had been sent to the
mountain-region to enrol the loyalists, and overawe those
that favored the patriot cause. Ferguson met with more
resistance than he anticipated. At one place, a lady at whose

so short a time that she escaped suspicion; and, when the
British attempted to surprise the Americans shortly before
daylight, they found the latter ready to receive them with
loaded riﬂes. In the battle Which ensued, the British were

By this time the mountaineers Were collecting in numbers
under Colonels Campbell and Shelby and other distinguished
ofﬁcers. Even the Want of ammunition did not keep them
from the ﬁeld. They made their own powder, from nitre
found in the mountain caverns and charcoal burned by the
Women on their own hearths. A thousand of these deter-
mined men gave chase to Ferguson’s detachment, and over-
took it at Kings Mountain on the 7th of October. En-
camped on the top, the British felt secure; but with such

1781] _ MUTINIES IN THE AMERICAN CAMP. 283

Congress had resolved to have an efficient army in the ﬁeld
by the 1st of January. But men would not enlist whe11 the
sufferings of those already in the service were known through-
out the land; and it was even feared that the few before
enrolled, would have to be disbanded for want of food. On
the night of January 1st, 1781, the Pennsylvania regiments
broke out into open mutiny, declaring that they would march
to Philadelphia, and compel Congress to redress their wrongs.
Gen. Wayne, who was a great favorite with his men, tried
to no purpose to restrain them. They presented their bay-
onets to his breast, and 1,300 strong commenced their march
to Philadelphia. Washington was at New Windsor; and,
not feeling sure of the disposition of the other troops, he
thought it best to let Congress settle the difficulty. A com-
mittee of that body met the disaffected men, and succeed-
ed in satisfying them. While still insisting on their rights,
they were as staunch patriots as ever ; not only had they no
idea of joining the royal army, but they even handed over
to Gen. Wayne, as spies, several emissaries, who had come to
seduce them into the British service.

The example of the Pennsylvanians was soon followed by
the New Jersey brigade; and Washington found it neces-
sary to put down the mutiny by force, and execute its lead-
ers on the spot. These demonstrations showed Congress
the necessity of more earnest efforts for obtaining funds and
properly supporting the army. As the resources of America
seemed to be exhausted, an agent was sent to France for the
purpose of obtaining a loan. In February, 1781, Robert
Morris was appointed superintendent of finance. By using
his private credit for the government, he restored conﬁdence
in the honesty of Congress and its ability to pay its debts.
The Bank of North America was established by his recom-

mendation and placed under his direction. Securing all the
gold that he could obtain in the United States, he redeemed
the bills of the bank as they were presented, and then pri-
vately sending round agents, again got possession of the
gold, and was ready to redeem more. It was out of his
power to make good the $200,000,000 of continental money
already issued; but the engagements entered into from this
time were promptly met, and the army was kept from dis-
banding. A '

387. Congress, in 1777, had agreed upon certain “Articles
of Confederation”, to serve as a basis of union for the states.
Several years elapsed before these articles were ratiﬁed by
all the members of the confederacy. Maryland was the last
to accept them, March 1, 1781.

388. On his appointment to the command of the southern
department, General Greene reorganized the army, and sta-
tioned detachments at various exposed points. A division
of 1,000 men under Gen. Morgan, one of the heroes of Still-
water, wasposted at the junction of the Bread and Pac-o-let’
Rivers [see Map, p. 286]. Tarleton, with a superior force,
was dispatched against them. The Americans fell back to
a favorable position at the Cowpens ; and there, on the 17th
of January, 1 7 81, an obstinate engagement took place. Ta.rle-
ton’s men charged with that ﬁerce impetuosity, which in for-
mer battles had at once insured victory by throwing the
American militia into confusion; but on this occasion they
Were received with a firmness they had not expected, and
the deadly aim of men used to the riﬂe. This brave resist-
ance made the British veterans waver, and a vigorous charge
of Col. Washington’s cavalry, supported by the infantry un-
der Col. Howard, decided the fortune of the day in favor of
the patriots. The Americans lost about 70 men, of whom
but 12 Were killed. The British loss amounted to 100 killed
and 533 captured. xaluable spoils, including 35 baggage-

wagons and 100 dragoon horses, fell into the hands of the
victors. »

Tarleton, who had been Wounded by Col. Washingtoii in
a personal encounter during the battle, could not forgive his
antagonist. Some time afterwards he remarked in company
that he had heard Col. Wasliiiigton was so ignorant he could
not write his own name. “ Ah! colonel,” replied a whig
lady who Was present, “ you should know better; for you
bear evidence that he com make his metric.”

389. Cornwallis was much chagrined at Tarleton’s defeat.

~Destroying his heavy baggage, he set out with all speed in

pursuit of Morgan, who, after the victory at the Cowpens,
had made for Virginia. By rapid marches the Americans
reached the Catawba, and crossed it just two hours before
the British army arrived at the bank. As the day was near-=
ly spent, Cornwallis concluded to wait till morning; but
during the night a heavy rain set in, and the river was so
swollen that for three days it was impassable. At the expia
ration of that time, the pursuit was resumed.

Meanwhile Gen. Greene, who had hastened to Morgan’s
aid, assumed command of the retreating army. VVhile Corn-
wallis was crossing the Catawba, the American general en-a
tered the town of Salisbury [sctwZz’—Z)e9"-ry], drenched with
rain and overcome with fatigue. . The hostess of the inn
at which he put up, hearing him say that he was “hungry,
alone, and penniless,” after preparing his dinner, brought
him allthe money she had, and bade him take it, at the
same time assuring him that the people were still devoted to
the cause of liberty. _ _

390. Encouraged and refreshed, Gen. Greene continued
the retreat with all possible haste. That same evening he
reached the Yad’-kin, a few miles north of Salisbury, and
Cornwallis passed the night at the latter place. Before
dawn, the whole American army‘ had crossed the river.

Hardly were they safe on the other side, when another heavy
rain commenced; and by the time the British came up they
found a swelling ﬂood which it was impossible to cross.
Cornwallis marched up the west side of the river to Hunts—
ville, effected the passage at that place, and pressed on to
intercept the weary Americans before they should reach the
fords of the Dan.

On the 7th of February, Greene and his men reached
Gruilford Court House, 150 miles from the Cowpens. A short
rest was here allowed them, and a junction was effected with
the remainder of the army. Still they were too weak to face
the enemy, and the retreat was continued. C Cornwallis, who
had crossed higher up, moved by forced marches in a parallel
direction, and both armies advanced at the rate of 30 miles
a day. Greene reached the ford ﬁrst, and on the 14th the

whole army got over in safety. Cornwallis here gave up the
pursuit, and retired to Hillsborough. Both Morgan and
Greene displayed great ability in conducting this memorable
retreat. The men bore their hardships with the most praise-
worthy fortitude. Their clothing was wretched; their shoes
were completely worn out. During most of the march they
had eaten but one meal a day, and had slept in the open air,
there being no time to pitch their tents.

391. As soon as his army had recovered from its fatigue,
Greene again took the ﬁeld, with the View of harassing the
enemy. He avoided a general action by constantly changing
his position, but sent out detachments which encountered the
enemy with success. On one occasion, a band of tories mis-
took Col. Lee’s troop for a company of their own men, and
were cut down by the Americans, while exclaiming “God
save the king 1” For three weeks this kind of war was con-
tinued, and so scarce were provisions that the American gen-
eral was often obliged to ask his soldiers for a piece of bread.

On the 15th of March, Greene determined to hazard an
engagement. His army had been increased by reinforce-
ments to 4,400 men, more than half of whom were militia,

‘ and at Guilford Court House [see Map, p. 286] he offered

battle to the enemy. Hardly had the action commenced,
when the American militia, seized with a panic, gave way.
The regulars allowed the retreating militia to pass through
their ranks, and maintained the conﬂict for an hour and a
half. The superior discipline of the British, however, ﬁnally
prevailed. Gen. Greene, seeing his men forced back, and
apprehending. a failure of ammunition, drew off his army in
good order, but was obliged to leave his artillery inthe
hands of the enemy. By the latter this victory was dearly
bought. They had lost 600 men and many valuable officers.
Four hundred and nineteen Americans were killed and

nity to desert. A dark, rainy night. succeeded this day of
slaughter. The dead and wounded were left on the ﬁeld,
and many perished for want of shelter.

392. Though a victor, Cornwallis deemed it prudent to
retreat ; and Greene, who had retired a short distance, was
soon on his track. The British reached Wﬂmiiigton early
in April. Greene passed on with the view of recovering‘
South Carolina. Cornwallis left the defence of that state to
Lord Rawdonis division, which was already there, and to-
wards the close of April set out with his army for Virginia.
We must go back a few months, to note what was there
transpiring.

398. On the 4th of January, Arnold, who had sailed from
New York with instructions to devastate southern Virginia,
landed near Richmond with 1,600 men and destroyed a

quantity of stores. Burning with hate against the patriots,

whom he had tried to betray, he sent out detachments in
different directions, whose course was marked with blood
and ﬂames. With malignant pleasure he set ﬁfe to private
as well as public property, and laid waste many a happy
home and thriving plantation. ’

To stop these outrages, La Fayette was sent to Virginia
with 1,200 men, and the French ﬂeet was dispatched from
Rhode Island to prevent Arnold’s escape by sea. A British
squadron started in pursuit of the French; and an engage-
ment took place of Cape Henlopen, which rendered it neces-
sary for the latter to return. Clinton then sent a reinforce-
ment of 2,000 men to the aid of Arnold, and the work of
devastation was carried on more vigorously than ever. La
Fayette exerted himself to the utmost to protect the country,
but his force was inadequate to the purpose. His men were
chieﬂy from the north; and fears of the climate and the su-
perior numbers of the enemy, led many to desert. La Fay-

ette set forth the baseness of such conduct to his soldiers,
and told them that if those who wished to abandon their
comrades would make known their desire, he would give

them a permit to leave. Not a man accepted the offer, nor

were there any more desertions. General enthusiasm pre-
vailed; a sergeant who was unable to walk even hired a
place in a cart that he might keep up with the army. The
generous Frenchman rewarded the devotion of his followers
by supplying them withshoes, linen, and other necessaries,
at his own expense. 7

394. On his arrival from North Carolina, Cornwallis took
command of the army in Virginia, and continued to ravage

the country. The tobacco warehouses and shipping of Pe-

tersburg were destroyed. Wherexrer there was a ﬁne plan-
tation, the British made a descent, and the royal cavalry
obtained a new supply of horses at the expense of the Whig
farmers. Tarleton captured several members of the Legis-
lature at Charlottesville, and burned part of the stores there
collected, the rest having been saved by J eﬁ"erson. After
spending most. of the summer in these operations, and de-
stroying property to the value of $10,000,000, Cornwallis
collected his forces, and retired to Yorktown, which he pro-
ceeded to fortify.

395. We left Gen. Greene in April, 1781, on the march for
South Carolina. Lord Rawdon, the British commander, lay
at Camden; and thither Greene marched with his main body.

‘He encamped at Hobkirk’s Hill, a mile from the enemy’s lines.

On the 25th of April, a British prisoner escaped a.nd bore
such information to Lord Rawdon as induced him to make
an immediate -attack on the Americans. For a time the
latter had the advantage; but at the moment of victory a

triumphs on the Congaree. Among the points which they
attacked Was Fort Motte, the residence of a Whig lady, Which
the enemy had taken and fortiﬁed. The garrison refused to

surrender; and, as Rawdon had destroyed his Works at Cam-

den and Was on his Way down the river, there Was no time
for a siege. Mrs. Motte insisted that the assailants should
ﬁre her house to dislodge the enemy. She produced a large
bow, and burning arrows soon set the shingled roof in ﬂames.
The occupants tried to put out the ﬁre; but, as often as they
appeared, Marion’s’ riﬂemen drove them back. At length,
to save their lives, they surrendered. The ﬂames Were ex-
tinguished; and Mrs. Motte, restored to her home, sump-
tuously entertained the oﬂicers of both armies.

397 . One after another, the posts of the British Were, taken,
and at last only Ninety-Six, Augusta, and Charleston remained
in their possession. The ﬁrst of these Was strongly fortiﬁed,
and garrisoned by 550 tories, under Col. Cru’-ger. On the
22nd of May, Gen. Greene appeared before it, and with the
aid of Kosciusko commenced a regular siege. The tories
made a gallant resistance, in the hope of relief; and, though

Greene pushed the Work With unremitting energy, the ap-

proach of the British commander compelled himtoraise the
siege, after an unsuccessful assault. At Augusta the Ameri-
cans Were more successful; the garrison at that place capitu-
lated, on the 5th of June, to C01. Pickens.

Soon after leaving Ninety-Six, it. became important for
Greene to communicate with Sumter; but, as the surround-
ing. country Was ﬁlled with British and tories, no one offered
to undertake the dangerous mission. In this emergency, a
girl of eighteen years, named Emily Geiger [gi’;je9“], volun-

found upon her, she Was allowed to proceed. Sumter’s camp
was reached. The message was delivered, and With such
effect that Grreene’s army Was soon strong enough to assume
the offensive. Rawdon Was obliged to retreat, and Greene
sought amid the hills on the Santee to restore the health and
energies of his men.

398. Gen. Greene next moved towards Charleston, and
various brilliant achievements were performed in the vicinity
of that city by Sumter, Marion, Lee, Horry, Taylor, Hamp»
ton, and James. Several detachments of the enemy were

stores Were burned. Alarmed for the safety of the city,

. Rawdon called upon those who had taken an oath of alle-

giance to the king, to come forward for its defence. Among
these was Col. Isaac Hayne, who, on the capture of the city
by the British, to obtain his liberty and a last interview With
his dying wife, had promised to support the royal govern-
ment, on the assurance that he would not l1ave to take up
arms in its behalf. After receiving the last sigh of his wife,
and following one of his children to the grave, Col. Hayne
had remained at home, taking no part in the conflict, till he
received Lord Rawdon’s summons to repair to his standard.
As by this act the British violated their agreement, Colonel
Hayne felt that he was absolved from his part of the con-
tract. Collecting a troop of horse, he ranged the country;
but, after gaining some advantages, was defeated and cap-
tured. He was sentenced to death. In vain his fellow-
citizens, in vain the ladies of. Charleston, in vai11 the sister
of the prisoner and his orphan children, implored Lord Raw-
don’s mercy. On the 4th of August, Col. Hayne was hanged
like a common criminal. ,
399. -At thisijuncture Lord Rawdon returned to England,
leaving Col. Stuart in commandof the British army in South
Carolina. Stuart took a position at Eutaw Springs; and
Greene, whose army had been increased by reinforcements
to 2,600 men, attacked him at that place. The battle was
fought on both sides with desperate courage. At last the
British ranks were broken. As they gave way, Col. Camp-
bell, who had contributed much to the success of the Amer-
icans, fell mortally wounded; his last words were, “ I die
contented”. Col. VVashington received a bayonet wound,
and was taken, while half his troop of cavalry fell on the
ﬁeld. Still the rout of the British was general, and the

engagement. The vigilance of Greene. saved his men from
a surprise, and With some loss he drew them off’. Though
the British remained masters of the ﬁeld, the Americans had
the decided advantage in this battle. The former lost in
killed, wounded, and prisoners, not far from 700 men; the
American loss was 555. The next day, Stuart destroyed his
stores, and retreated towards Charleston, leaving 1,000 stands
of arms behind him.

This battle closed the long contest in the Carolinas. The
patriot cause was once more triumphant. Congress voted
the highest honors to General Greene and his oﬂicers, who
throughout the whole campaign had conducted themselves
with distinguished ability and valor.

it was agreed between the French and the American com»

his army from the Hudson, marched rapidly towards Vir-=

it was too late to prevent them ; but he tried to recall Wash-
ington by sending Arnold to devastate Connecticut. Used
to this business, and glad to have an opportunity of glutting

batteries. Four British vessels were set on ﬁre in the har-
bor by a ﬁerce discharge of red-hot balls. Two redoubts of
the enemy, so situated as to harass the besiegers, were storm-
ed and carried, one by the Americans, the other by the
French, with a steady courage which assured Washington
of success. The best feelings prevailed between the allied

armies. The American soldiers cheerfully sacriﬁced their .

own comfort to increase that of their comrades, sleeping
without complaint in the open air that their allies might be
provided with tents. r
401. Breaches were soon made in the British works. A
desperate sally, at ﬁrst successful, proved of no ultimate ad-
vantage ; and, as the batteries of the besiegers were brought
nearer and nearer, all hope gradually disappeared. Corn-
wallis could see but one chance of escape, and, slender as it

was, he resolved to try it. On the opposite bank of the York -

River was Gloucester [,6/Z03’-tar] Point [see Map, p. 294],
where 2,000 Frenchmen lay intrenched. The plan of the
British commander was to destroy his baggage, to abandon
his sick and wounded, to transport his efﬁcient men in the
silence of night across the river, to force a passage ‘through
the French lines, to mount as many of his men as possible,
and make his way by forced marches to Clinton.

The night of October 16th was selected for this desperate
attempt. The ﬁrst detachment landed on the Gloucester
shore in safety; but a storm set in with such fury that the
boats bearing the second di-vision were driven down the
river. The wind and rain continued, till daylight, and it
was found impossible to get the remainder of the army
across. Those who had landed, after being exposed to the
storm for hours, were brought back in the morning, and all
expectation of escape was thenceforth abandoned.

The scene of the surrender Was imposing. Thousands of
patriots assembled from the surrounding country to Witness
the humiliation of that ruthless army and its detested com-2
mander. The British came forth gayly dressed, but Without
ﬂying colors, since that honor had been denied the American
army on its surrender at Charleston. Cornwallis Would not
appear, but sent his sword by Gen. C’Hara. Lincoln Was
selected by Washington to receive this token of submission,
as a solace for the mortiﬁcation he had experienced in sur.-
rendering Charleston the preceding year. Twenty-eight
standards were presented to American sergeants by as many

British captains. The soldiers then laid down their arms,_

Notwithstanding the excesses of which Cornwallis and
many of his ofﬁcers had been guilty, they were treated with
great consideration by their conquerors. The British leader,
however, could not forget his humiliation. On one occasion,
when he was standing before Washington with his hat off,
the latter remarked, “ My lord, you had better be covered
from the cold.” “It matters not, sir,” replied Cornwallis,
raising his hand to his brow, “ it matters not what becomes
of this head now.”

403. On the very day of the surrender, Clinton set out
from New York for the relief of Cornwallis, with 25 ships-
of-the-line and 7,000 of his best men. Off the coast of Vir-
ginia, he learned to his dismay that he was too late, and he
could only retrace his course.

404. News of the success at Yorktown rapidly spread
through the country. One of Washingto11’s aids bore the
glad tidings to Philadelphia. Arriving at night, he proceed-
ed at once to the house of the president of Congress, and
knocked, so loudly that a watchman was on the point of ar-
resting him for disturbing the peace. He was forgiven,
however, on announcing his oyful news. The bell of the old
state-house soon pealed forth in exulting tones. Some were
speechless with delight, while others wept; and the aged
door-keeper of Congress died from excessive joy. Congress
voted the highest honors to all who had aided in gaining
this important victory. VVashington celebrated the occasion
by releasing those who were under military arrest. Reli-
gious services were performed in the several brigades, and

with success.

the surface, beneath trees that have stood for centuries.

39. The number of mounds erected by the early and civ-
ilized inhabitants of this continent is variously estimated at
from ﬁve to ten thousand. ‘Scattered throughout the whole
region now occupied by the United -States, Mexico, and
Central America, they are most numerous in the two last
named countries, and on the banks of the Mississippi and
the Missouri. Some of them seem to have been erected for
religious purposes, others as means of defence, and a third
class as buria.l places for the dead. The last are the most
frequent, and have furnished the greater part of the orna-=
ments and urns mentioned above. A mound of this class,
150 feet around and 15 feet high, was recently opened near
Lancaster, Ohio." On a level with the surrounding surface
was found a furnace of unhewn stone eighteen feet long, on
which rested a well-moulded earthen vessel, containing twelve
skeletons of men, women, and children. Around the neck
of one of the small skeletons was a string of beads, shells,
and arrow-heads. The bottom of the vessel bore marks
of the action of ﬁre, and beneath it was a great quantity of
charcoal and ashes.

Eleven ‘miles from Natchez, Mississippi, was a group of
mounds erected for defensive purposes. One of these was
thirty-ﬁve feet high, and contained an area of four acres on
its top, from which rose several smaller mounds. In the
middle of the summit was the mouth of a subterranean pas-=
sage leading to a spring. The remains of a ditch are still to
be seen around the base of the large mound; while its steep
sides are marked with indentations and projections like those
in modern works of the same kind. Ancient roads leading
to this great work may still be traced ; and many weapons,
implements, and human bones, have been dug up in the
neighborhood.

arm of her illustrious son, her dignity of mien deeply im-
pressed all who were present; and La Fayette, on the ter-
mination of the war, would not leave the country without
bidding a last adieu to the mother of Wasliington.

406. The days of trouble were not yet over. Notwith-
standing their losses in America, the British ministry showed
no disposition to give up the war; and it was indispensable
for Congress, if it would maintain the advantages already
gained, to raise and support an army. ‘How could this be
done with an empty treasury? It was only by unceasing
exertions that Mr. Morris had thus far maintained the credit
of the nation and met the expenses of the last southern cam»
paigns. To eke out his scanty means, he had employed an

agent to accompany Greene’s army, Without the general’s
knowledge. Aware of the suiferings of the soldiers from
want of food and clothing, he knew that Greene would at
once spend in their behalf whatever was placed in his hands,
without retaining aught for future emergencies. He directed
his agent, therefore, to relieve Greene only in small amounts
and when his diﬁiculties seemed insurmountable. Several
times was the army thus saved from dissolution, the myste-
rious agent disappearing as soon as he had placed the money
on the table. At the commencement of 1782, not a dollar
remained in the trea.sury. The states were called upon by
Congress to contribute $2,000,000, but made no response.
Mr. Morris had exhausted all the means at his command, and
was so discouraged that he was tempted to resign his office.

407. Lord North, George Third’s prime minister, received
the news of Cornwallis’ surrender “ as he would have received
a cannon-ball in his breast”; yet both he and the king obsti-
nately determined to continue the war. The English peo-
ple, however, heavily taxed for its support, felt diﬁerently.
Burke, Fox, and other Parliamentary leaders vehemently
opposed any further efforts to reduce America; and early in
March,_1782, the House of Commons passed strong resolu-
tions against the war. Lord North resigned, and a ministry
favorable to peace succeeded. Sir Guy Carleton was sent to
take command of the British forces. He reached New York

in May, and made propositions to the American authorities; .

but Wasliington, ﬁnding that he would not recognize the in-
dependence of the United States and was prepared to treat
with them only as revolted colonies, warned the people
against listening to his oifers. Not till Grenville was sent
to Paris with full powers to treat with France and America,
was any well-grounded hope of peace entertained.

408. As soon as the people of the United States thought

that the War was likely to end, they began to relax their ex:-A

ertions and to demand of Congressthe pay justly due them
for past services. While Vlfashington did all he could to
soothe their discontent, he urged upon Congress the neces-
sity of meeting their engagements to those Who had served
them faithfully in the hour of need. The British, to be sure,
had ceased offensive operations ; but they might resume
them at any moment, and with an army on the point of mu.
tiny there could be little hope of successful resistance. The
discontent rose to its greatest height in the spring of 17 82.,
in the camp at Newburg. Nothing but their love of VVash-
ington restrained the army from asserting their _rights by
Violence; and never did Washington display more judgment
than in dealing With the disaffected at thiscritical period.

In May, 1782, Washington received from_ Col. N ic’-o-la
through Whom the discontented troops generally made their
complaints, a letter setting forth the belief. of the army that
Congress Was neither Willing nor able to redress their
Wrongs, and expressing a desire to place their beloved chief,
as king, at the head of the nation. This offer ﬁlled Wash-
ington With grief and alarm. He rejected it ‘Without hesita-
tion; solemnly declaring that the reéstablishment of royalty
would be fatal to those liberties which were morevprecious
than life. - ‘

Winter found the American army still unemployed at
Nevvburg and New Windsor. . In February, 1783, they

again sent a petition to Congress, which had as yet, done

nothing for their relief. An indeﬁnite answer Was returned.
Groaded by poverty, the oﬁicers,.Who‘ Were almost as great
sufferers as their men, authorized one -of th‘eir[numbe'r to

action. Before the appointed day, Washington ‘convened

his officers. In vivid colors he depicted the impropriety and
danger of the steps they proposed, andcalled upon them to
forbear from involving him, themselves, and their country,
in one common ruin. The sympathizing leader who had
shared all their hardships, spoke with deep feeling and was
listened to in silence. At the close of his remarks he retired;
and the assembled. officers, after a short consultation, decided
to follow his advice.

409. Meanwhile the negotiations for peace were progress-
ing at Paris. John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay,
and Henry Laurens, acted in behalf of the United States.
They obtained from Great Britain an acknowledgment of
the independence of their country, and articles of peace Were
signed on the 20th of January, 17 83. Intelligence of the fact
was received by Congress in March, and was hailed with re-
joicings. ' The suiferings of self-denying patriots during eight
years of hardship Were thus at. last rewarded with that price-
less freedom for which they had sighed, struggled, and bled.

410. Washington still labored to relieve the immediate
necessities of the troops, and discharged all who could ﬁnd
the means of returning home. Many thus left Without tu-

mult, although their claims were unsettled and they had not .

a penny in their pockets. Only one company, formed of re-
cent levies from Pennsylvania, created any serious diﬂiculty.
Entering Philadelphia, they marched to the state-house, and
threatened summary vengeance if they were not immediately
paid. After a few hours they retired, and Washiiigton pre-
vented a repetition of the violence by promptly sending a
detachment to disperse the mutineers and arrest their ring-
leaders. Notwithstanding this warning, Congress left Mr.
Morris almost entirely to his own resources. Four months’
pay for the army was all that his utmost exertions could raise.

possession of the city for seven years; and during that time
had made it the principal receptacle for the unfortunate

Such a diet, added to foul air and want of exercise, brought-
on a variety of diseases which swept them oﬁ“ by hundreds.
Every morning the command was heard, “ Rebels, bring out
your dead.” The bodies of the deceased were carried ashore
and buried near the bay, in graves so shallow that they were
often washed bare by the waves. Twenty-ﬁve years after
the’ close of the war, some patriotic citizens proposed to
gather up the remains of the prison-ship martyrs, and have
them suitably interred. The bones of 11,000 men were col-
lected, and followed-by a large procession to a vault pre-
pared for their reception near the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

York; and, as they departed, the American army, with Gen.

amid the roaring of artillery and the cheers ofa delighted
people, the ensign of Britain gave place to the stars and
stripes of the young republic.

412. On the 4th of December, Washingtoii took leave of
his oﬂicers, who assembled at his quarters to hear his parting
words. It was an affecting scene. All that they had done
and suffered together, all that they had hoped andfeared,
rushed before their minds. “ With a heart full of love and
gratitude,” said Wasliingtoii, “I now take leave of ‘you. I
most devoutly wish that your latter days may be prosperous
and happy, as your former ones have been glorious and hon-
orable. I can not come to each of you to take my leave, but
shall be obliged if each of you will come a11d take me by the
hand.” Gen. Knox stood nearest, and turned to grasp the
hand of his commander. Their emotions were too deep for
utterance; not a word was spoken. The rest followed, with
full hearts and moistened cheeks. This trying scene over,
VVashington crossed to the Jersey shore, and thence pro-
ceeded to Annapolis, where Congress was in session.

413. At Philadelphia Washingtoii stopped long enough to
submit to the comptroller an account of his expenses during
the war. They amounted to £11,311, every item‘ being dis-
tinctly entered by his own hand. On the 19th of December

replied in a touching and aifectionate manner, offering the

CHAPTER XXI.

FORMATION OF A FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.

414. THE independence of the United States was now_

acknowledged by Great Britain, France, Russia, Sweden,
Spain, and Denmark; but it was still questionable whether
it could be maintained amid the formidable difﬁculties with

' which Congress was beset.‘ The war had cost $135,000,000;

dollars a year.

and debts were still outstanding, to foreign governments and
unpaid soldiers and oﬂcers, to the amount of $40,000,000,
on which Congress was not even able to meet the interest.
The states refused to act in concert, and no revenue could
be collected without their cooperation. Unsupported, bail
ﬂed, and even censured, Mr. Morris resigned the oﬂice of
superintendent of ﬁnance, but was induced to continue in
the discharge of its duties till November 1, 1784, when a
board of three commissioners was appointed to succeed him.
Seldom has an abler ﬁnancier appeared for the relief of a
distressed country. Under his management, the expenses
of the war were reduced from eighteen to four millions of

415. During the war most of the states had remodelled
their constitutions. Their forms of government were now
strictly republican, and bore a general resemblance to each
other. The privilege of voting was extended to every citi-=

certain amount of property. The common law of England
prevailed, except when modiﬁed by special enactments. As
a general thing, religious liberty was allowed. The affairs
of each state were regulated by a governor and two houses
of delegates, chosen by the people. The different members
of the confederacy were thus entirely ,/independent of each
other; and now, that the war was over, jealousies began
unfortunately to arise between them. A want of union at
home prevented the nation from being respected abroad.
It was obvious that the power of Congress was but nominal.

416. Hardly had the war terminated when complaints were
made in England that debts due from American citizens could
not be collected. Congress, having no power to enforce
their payment, could only refer the claimants to the indi-
vidual states. The latter alleged that the British armies had
carried off many slaves from the American people, and that
not until these were restored could the debts in question be
justly claimed. There were also other causes of diﬁiculty,
which threatened to lead to a renewal of the war. The
whole western frontier. suffered much from the incursions of
Indians, instigated, it was believed, by the British, and fur»
nished witharms and ammunition at the posts still remain-
ing in their hands in the west.

In 1785, John Adams was appointed minister plenipoten-=
tiary to the court of Great Britain (or St. James, as it is
called), and was there introduced to the king whom he had
so long and successfully opposed. George III. received him
kindly, and assured him that though he had been the last to
agree to the separation of the United States, he would be
among the first to meet their friendship as an independent
power. Mr. Adams labored hard at London to obtain a fair
commercial treaty for his country, but without success. The

America kept them comparatively out of market, to the great
injury of its merchants and farmers.

417. Various causes combined to render the condition of
the Americans distressing in the extreme. They had hoped
for an immediate immigration from Europe, and a proper-
tionate increase in the value of their lands ; but in this they
were disappointed. All kinds of business were in a state of
depression, and the energies as well as the resources of the
country seemed exhausted. In the midst of these embarrass-
ments, the people Were loaded with heavy taxes for the sup-
port of government. Open threats of rebellion were the
consequence ; and in Massachusetts, 1,500 men took up arms.
In December, 1786, while the Supreme Court was in session
at Springﬁeld, Daniel Shays, who had been a captain in the
Revolution, took command of the insurgents, seized on the
court-house, and compelled the judges to retire. Gov. Bow-
doin [bo’-den] called out the militia, and intrusted their com-

was suppressed. Fourteen of the ringleaders were taken
and condemned to death, but afterwards pardoned. Quiet
was thus restored, but all true friends of their country were
ﬁlled With gloomy apprehensions.‘ The need of a stronger
government wa.s now more than ever apparent.

418. Even before these dangerous movements, the defects
of the “articles of confederation” had been generally felt.
In January, 1786, the legislature of Virginia had proposed a
convention of delegates from the several states to regulate
the commercial relations of the country. In the following
September, delegates from ﬁve states met at Annapolis; but,
feeling that in so important a work every state should be
represented, they adjourned after recommending Congress
to call a general convention. Their suggestion was acted
on, and representatives from every state except Rhode Isl-

members generally were men of distinguished ability and
patriotism. This body remained in session with closed doors
nearly three months, and produced that glorious Constitu-
tion, which was the origin of our prosperity, and is still our
pride as a nation.

419. N O sooner was the constitution presented to the peo-
ple than it was severely criticized, and in some quarters op-
posed. It was impossible to suit all: here one point was
denounced, and there another. Every Objection, however,
was ably answered‘ by Madison, Jay, and Hamilton, who
maintained that local interests should give way to the great-
est good of the greatest number. Their arguments pre-
vailed. Within a year the instrument was ratiﬁed by a ma-
jority of the states. In New York it met with little favor,
Alexander Hamilton being almost its only advocate in the
convention with which its adoption or rejection rested. But

_Hamilton was a host, and he threw himself into the cause

with all his powers. Just before the vote was to be taken,
he rose, and in a speech of three hours pleaded most forcibly

ANCIENT WALLS, FORTIFIOATIONS, ETC. 29

40. In the numerous remains of walls, fortiﬁcations, and
cities, scattered throughout North America, we have still

imore remarkable ‘evidence of mechanical skill in the early

inhabitants. At least a hundred of these works have been
discovered in the State of New York; but they are yet
more numerous throughout our Western and Southern coun-
try, as well as in Central America and Mexico. They dis-
‘play no little knowledge of engineering and architecture;
while the size of some of them proves that multitudes of men
must have united in their construction. _

In Gasconade County, Missouri, under a tract covered with
large cotton-trees and full—grown poplars, are still to be seen
stone foundations, the remains of houses, and other ruins of
an ancient town regularly laid out in squares and streets.

for its adoption. His opponents objected to the quest-ion’s
being put immediately after such a speech. The House ad-
journed till the following day; but that burning eloquence

was not forgotten, and New York pronounced in. favor of y

the constitution, July 26, 1788. North Carolina and Rhode
Island remained for a time undecided, but they also ﬁnally
accepted it.

420. The constitution thus originally adopted has received
some few additions and amendments. Its chief points should
be familiar to every student of his country’s history. They
are as follows :— A v

THE LEGISLATIVE POWER of the government is vested in
a Congress consisting of two houses, known as the Senate
and the House of Representatives. The senate is composed
of two members from each state, elected by the respective
legislatures for a term of six years. Vacancies occasioned
by death or resignation during the recess of the legislature
of any state, are temporarily ﬁlled by the governor till the
legislature reassembles. The terms are so arranged that

but one-third of them expire at the same time, so that two-‘

thirds of the body are always experienced members. No
person can be a senator that has _not attained the age of
thirty, and been nine years a citizen of the United States.
The vice—president of the United States is president of the
senate, but has only a casting vote. All impeachments are
tried before this body. _

The house of representatives is composed of members
chosen- by the people every second year. Each state has a
certain number proportioned to its population; the territories
have one delegate each. A representative must have attain-
ed theage of twenty-ﬁve, and been seven years a citizen of

the United States. When a vacancy occurs, a new election

by the people takes place on the governor’s call. The house
chooses its own Speaker, and has the sole power of ﬁnding

English House of . Commons ; and the presiding oﬁicer is so
called because it is through him that the house speaks, or
communicates with the other branches of the legislature]

Congress meets every year at the national capital on the
ﬁrst Monday in December. The members are paid from the
public treasury [$3,000 a year], and are privileged from
arrest for all offences except treason, felony, and breach of
the peace, While attending a session of their respective houses,
or, on their Way to or from such a session. No person can
at the same time be a member of either House and hold
office under the United States. Congress haslpower to col-
lect taxes and duties ; to borrow money on the credit of the
United States; to regulate foreign commercial relations ; to
establish laws respecting naturalization and bankruptcy; to
coin money and provide a punishment for counterfeiting; to
ﬁx the standard of weights a.nd measures; to establish post-
oﬂices; to grant authors and inventors exclusive privileges
by copyrights and patents; to declare War ; to raise armies
and .maintain a navy ; to provide for organizing the militia;
to make laws for the District ofColu_n1bia, or any other tract
that may become the seat of government; &c., &c. ~Bills
for appropriating money must originate in the house of rep»
resentatives, but may be amended or rejected by the senate.
A bill passed by a concurrent vote of the two houses of Con;
gress, before it can become a law, must be signed by the
president of the United States; if he vetoes it (that is, re»
turns it unsigned With his objections), it is null and void une
less passed by two-thirds of both houses.

as they have senators and representatives in Congress. These
electors meet in their respective states, and ballot for a
president and vice-president. A record of the votes is made
and transmitted sealed to the seat of government; where
they are opened in the presence of the senate and the house
of representatives. The person Who has a majority of the
electoral votes becomes president. 0 If there is no majority,
the election goes to the house of representatives; in that
case, the members from each state cast one vote, and a ma-
jority of the states elects. The president of the United
States must be a native citizen and thirty-ﬁve years of age,
and must have resided in the country for at least fourteen
years. .

In case of the president’s death, resignation, removal from
oﬁice, or inability to "discharge its duties, the vice-president
takeshis place; and, in case of the vice-president’s disabil-
ity, the president of the senate pro t677'l]90’I“6 oﬁiciates as pres-
ident. The president is commander-in-chief of the army and
navy, and With the consent of the senate makes treaties, and
appoints ministers, consuls, judges of the supreme court, and
other oflicers. [The salary of the president is $25,000 a year;
that of the vice-president, $6,000.] -

THE JUDICIAL POWER of the United States is vested in
“ one supreme court, and in such inferior courts as Congress
may from time to time order and establish”. The judges

CHAPTER I.

wAsHINGTON’s ADMINISTRATION, 1 7 8 9-=1 '7 97 .

422. ON the 14th of April, 1789, VVashington received an
official announcement that he had been unanimously elected
president of the United States under the new constitution.
Two days afterwards he bade adieu to Mount Vernon
and set out for New York, where Congress was in session.
Oﬂicial receptions, addresses, and triumphal arches awaited
him everywhere on the route. On reaching the city, he
was received by Gov. Clinton and conducted with military
honors, in the midst of a vast concourse, to a residence which
was placed at his disposal. On the 30th of April, he was
inaugurated, at Federal Hall, on the site of the present Cus-
tom House. The oath of oﬁice was administered by Chan-
cellor Livingston, on the balcony in front of the Hall, in the
presence of a great multitude. Immediately after the cere-
mony, Washington proceeded to the senateechamber, and
delivered an address replete with exalted sentiments.

;_guration, proceeded to busi-
‘ _ .3 iiess. They found many dif-
 il ﬁculties to contend with. A
strong party was opposed to the consti-
tution and the new government formed
under it. The Spanish authorities had
prohibited Americans from navigating
the Mississippi. The people of the West
naturally looked to this river as their
only means of reaching a market; and, that they Inight not
lose the advantages it offered, some of the frontier settlers
proposed to separate from the republic and unite With the
Spanish territory of which New Orleans Was the metropolis.
The hostility of the Indians, Who had not as yet laid aside
the tomahawk, was a fruitful source of anxiety. These were

many? 423. Who had been elected vice-president? Enumerate the diﬁiculties by

a few of the subjects that required the immediate attention
of government, added to which was the ever-pressing want
of money. After long deliberation, Congress determined to
raise a revenue by laying. duties on the tonnage of vessels
and all imported articles.

424. One of the ﬁrst acts of Congress was to create three

departments, the heads of which were known as the Secre-e

tary of Foreign Affairs (afterwards_ Secretary of State), the
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of War‘. These,
together with the Attorney-General, were to act as advisers
of the president, constituting what was called his Cabinet.
Two new departments have since been created (the Navy
and the Interior), the heads of which, with the Postmaster-
General, have seats in the cabinet. The secretaryship of state
is the highest cabinet office; this Washiiigtoii bestowed on
Thomas J eﬁerson, who had been governor of Virginia for
two years, and had represented his country at the French
court from 1784 to 1789, {Alexander Hamilton was made
secretary of the t1'easL11‘y:% (Gen. KnoX,_who had been at the
head of the artillery dépa1'tn1ent throughout the revolution,
was appointed secretary of war, and Edmund Randolph, of
Virginia, attorney—gene1fal,_}‘

425. Having directed the secretary of the treasury to pre-
sent at the next session some plan for restoring the national
credit, Congress adjourned on the 29thof September. North
Carolina accepted the constitution in November.

426. The president was at first overrun with visitors, who
made serious inroads on his time. He soon found it neces-
sary to appoint a ﬁxed, hour for their reception, and conﬁne
himself at other times to his oﬁicial duties. Notwithstanding
this precaution, he was compelled to labor incessantly, and
during the ﬁrst year of his presidency was twice prostrated
by excessive toil. Soon after the adjournment of Congress,

he set out on a visit to New England, and was received by
the people with every mark of affection. On his return to
New York he learned that Gen. Lincoln, who had been sent
to treat with the Creeks of Georgia, had failed in his at-
tempts. The Creek chief, at the head of 2,000 warriors, had
met the American commissioner; but suddenly broke oﬁ
negotiations and refused to sign a treaty. About a year
afterwards, the attempt was repeated with success.

427. Congress had imposed "upon Hamilton a diﬁicult task.
Amid ﬁnancial embarrassments of every kind, it was required
of him to provide a revenue for the government and to revive
its credit. But his genius was equal to the work. He took
the true ground, that, to maintain its credit, the country must
pay its honest debts. This principle fortunately prevailed in
Congress, and provision was made for the gradual payment
of $54,000,000. From this time conﬁdence was entertained
in the integrity of the government, and with conﬁdence pros-
perity returned. Too much credit cannot be given to the
far-seeing policy of Hamilton. In the eloquent language of
Webste1', “ He smote the rock of the national resources and
abundant streams of revenue burst forth. He touched the
dead corpse of, public credit and it sprang upon its feet.”

428. In May, 1790, Rhode Island adopted the constitution,
and the confederacy then embraced all of the thirteen origi-
nal colonies.

429. The insecurity of the settlers on the western frontier
early engaged the attention of Congress. Emigrants from
the Atlantic states had already penetrated to various points
in the valleys of the Ohio and the Mississippi. In 1769,
Daniel Boone, a bold hunter of North Carolina with ﬁve
enterprising men like himself, explored the wilds of what is
now called Kentucky. Boone afterwards returned and led
a larger party to the fruitful region where he had determined

to spend the remainder of his life. Hunting and trapping in
luxuriant forests, living on What their riﬂes afforded, sleeping
in cane-brakes, fighting and flying from the Indians by turns,
now captured and anon escaping, this little band, increased
from time to time by new-comers, underwent a _variety of
adventures that seem more like the ﬁctions of romance than
the truths of history. The natives, ever averse to encroach-
ments on their domains, maintained a perpetual Warfare,
which required untiring vigilance on the part of the Whites.
The great chief Pontiac had fallen; but Little T111'tle,’afz-
inous Miami Warrior, Was ever ready when a blow‘ Was to be
struck at the hated pale-face.

430. VVhen Great Britain gave up the War in 1783, the
Western tribes under Little Turtle resolved to continue it.
A party of unprincipled men had shortly before murdered
some Indians who had been converted by Moravian missiona

aries and had taken no part in the War. Thirsting for ven— I
tgeance, the Ohio tribes carried devastation far and Wide,

putting to death their prisoners with cruel tortures. The
Whites, though they had now become n1ore numerous and
powerful, Were hardly strong enough to repel the ﬁerce Alc-
gonquins. In August, 1782, a party of savages appeared be«
fore Bryan Station, five miles from Lexington, Kentucky, and
tried to draw the garrison out from their log defences. Faila
ing in this, they pretended to depart; but the old hunters,
skilled in all the artiﬁces of Indian warfare, felt sure that they
Were lying in ambush near the fort. At this critical time
their Water gave out, and it was necessary to obtain a fresh
supply. The spring was a short distance of, near a thicket
of trees and bushes in which it Was supposed the savages
were concealed. — If the men went out, it Was almost certain
they would be shot down and a rush made for the fort; but
it was thought, if the Women Went to the spring, the enemy

‘ilous task. Going carelessly to the spring, as if they suspected

nothing? they ﬁlled their vessels and bore them back to the
fort. Five hundred riﬂes were aimed at them while they
were dipping up the water, but not one was ﬁred. The
shrewd pioneer's of the wilderness had judged Indian char-
a-cter aright. The next day the surrender of the fort was
demanded; but a spirited refusal was returned, and no fur-
ther attempts were made on its brave defenders.

431. Congress having purchased of the Indians a large
tract north of the Ohio, a new impetus was given to emi-
gration. In 1788, a party of New Englanders commenced
the ﬁrst permanent settlement in Ohio at Marietta. In the
same year, Matthias Denman bought the land on which the
city of Cincinnati stands. With the aid of a school-master
he laid out a town there, the ﬁrst log hut being built in
December, 1789, on what is now the corner of Main and
Front streets.

fort. Another pair of walls, running west, joins these forts
with two others, four miles distant from them. One of
these is circular; the other, octagonal. The former contains
an observatory, of earth and stone; and from the latter
parallel walls are traceable several miles southward into the
country. From the occurrence of similar remains at inter-
vals, it is supposed that these works were connected with
others thirty miles distant.

41. Mexico and Central America abound in extensive
ruins, the remains of pyramids, temples, and cities, equal in
magniﬁcence to the grandest of the old world. The city of
Mexico alone contained two thousand py-ram’-id-al mounds,
the largest of which, 121 feet high, was built but a short
time before the country was explored by Cor’-tez. Many of
these works, however, like the ruined walls discovered in the
United States, are evidently centuries old. Among them
are ﬁnely sculptured columns, statues of idols, vast altars, im-
mense ediﬁces, massive aqueducts, and roads said to have
been the best in the world. The pyramid of Tezcuco [Mafia-
Icoo’-lco] is a specimen of the most delicate workmanship. It
was built of large blocks of basalt, highly polished and beau-
tifully sculptured. The largest Mexican pyramid is that of
Cholula [c/to-Z00’-la/L], built of alternate layers of clay and
unburnt bricks. It is 1,423 feet long, and 17 7 feet high.
Like nearly all the other works of this class, it was devoted
to religious purposes. . o

4-2. Both Mexico and Peru, when ﬁrst explored by Span-
iards, were the seatsof powerful nations, possessing regular
systems of government andreligion, acquainted with the arts
and sciences, and widely different from the savage tribes of
the North. The soil was well cultivated and checkered with
numerous cities, some of which are said to have contained
several hundred thousand inhabitants. Indeed, the great

The exposed condition of these important settlements in
the Ohio valley, as well as the" intrigues of the Spaniards,
who were trying to detach the ‘West from the Union, was a
source of great anxiety to both Wasliington and Congress.
Gen. St. Clair, a Revolutionary officer of high character, was
appointed ﬁrst governor of the Territory; and a fort (named
after Wasliington) was erected within the present limits of
Cincinnati, on a spot where the aboriginal mound-builders
had constructed one of their vast works. In purchasing the
tract referred to, great care had been taken to get thesanc-
tion of all the tribes supposed to have an interest in it; but
others who had not signed the treaty afterwards claimed to
be part owners of the land, and assumed so threatening a
tone that Congress had no alternative but war. In the fall
of 17 90, 1,400 men, ill disciplined and poorly equipped, were
sent under Gen. Harmer against the Miami villages, on the
present site of Fort Wayiie, Ind. They reached their desti-
nation in safety, and the ﬁelds of the Miamis were devastated.
Harmer then divided his army into detachments, for the pur-
suit of the scattered Indians. One of these was soon defeated
by Captain I/Vells, a Kentuckian, who had been carried off by
the savages when a boy and was now one of their chiefs;
another was led into a.n ambuscade by Little Turtle, and cut
to pieces. The remains of the unfortunate army with chili-
culty made their way back to Fort Washington.

432. The news of Harmer’s reverses produced general dis-
satisfaction ; and the president hastened to send a more effi-
cient army into the wilderness. Gen. St. Clair was selected
as its leader. Advancing gradually into the enemy’s coun—
try, he found himself on the 3d of November, 17 91, encamped
with 1,400 men near a branch of the Wabash at a place after»
wards called Fort Recovery. The Indians were in strong
force near at hand, and that very night held a council to de-
cide upon their course. Their leading spirit was Little Turtle,

the American army, and with ﬁery eloquence persuaded his
brother chieftains to adopt it.

Three hours before daylight on the 4th of November the

_ American army was paraded under arms, and about sunrise

it was dismissed to make preparations for an immediate march
against the Indian villages. While the men were thus en-
gaged, a single riﬂe was heard in front, and the next moment
a deadly ﬁre was poured in on all sides. The militia, Who
were posted in front, rushed through the ranks of the regu-
lars; but the latter kept their ground and returned as well
as they could, yet with little effect, the ﬁre of their unseen
enemies. St. Clair, though enfeebled by disease, madeevery
effort to save his men. Borne hither and thither on his lit-
ter, wherever the contest raged mostﬁercely, he gave his
orders with coolness andjudgment, and directed vigorous
charges to be made at different points. For a moment, suc-
cess followed these efforts; but the whoop of the fearless
chief would beheard,:.echoed by a thousand voices, and the
Red Men would press on more ﬁercely than before. Terri-
ble havoc was made, andit became evident that a timely
retreat alone could save the army from total destruction.
An impetuous charge‘ was made by Col. Darke, with such
spirit that the Indians were obliged to fall back, and through
the open space thus "gained the sad remnant of the devoted
army rushed in a hasty retreat. Gen. St. Clair was assisted
to mount one of theifew remaining horses, and followed his
flying regiments. The news of this disastrous overthrow

appalled the whole nation, and called forth again loud clam-
ors fromthose who opposed the government. A third ‘ex-
pedition became necessary; and, determined that it should
have a capable leader, Washington gave the command to
Gen. Wayiie, the “ mad Anthony” of the Revolution.

483. Meantime Congress was still occupied with ﬁnancial
matters. The business community labored under discour-
aging embarrassments, for which a uniform currency, enjoy-
ing the conﬁdence of the people, seemed to promise the only
remedy. To create this, Hamilton projected a national bank,
which Was chartered by Congress in March, 17 91, under the
name of the Bank of the United States. It was located at
Philadelphia, which had become the seat of government, had
a capital of $10,000,000, and was empowered to issue bills,
discount notes, and receive deposits. The beneﬁcial effects
of this institution on all kinds of business were immediately
felt. .

434. As we have seen, a strong party had from the out-
set opposed the constitution. Their chief argument against
it was that it gave too much power to the general govern-
ment, and limited that of the individual states. This party,
which embraced Jefferson and other distinguished patriots,
soon became known as “Republicans”, “Democrats”, or
“ States’ Rights Men”, in opposition to the “Federalists”,
as those Were called Who approved of a strong central gov-
ernment. Hamilton was one of the strongest federalist lead-
ers, and his measures, particularly those relating to the bank
and the collection of the revenue, Were severely denounced
by his opponents. The duty, or excise, laid on domestic
spirits was peculiarly unpopular in VVestern Pennsylvania;

Notwithstanding the warmth of party feeling, however,
Washington, whose ﬁrst term expired March 4th, 1793, was
unanimously reelected. Adams was also rechosen to the
vice-presidency. Meanwhile, New York having surrendered
her claims in consideration of éiB30,000,Ve1‘n1ont was received
into the Union in 1791 ; and the following year Kentucky
became a member of the confederacy.

485. In August, 1793, the American people were visited
by a calamity to which up to this time they had been stran-
gers. The yellow fever broke out in Philadelphia with such
virulence that in three months out of a population of 60,000
no less than 4,000 perished. The terror of the people was
unprecedented, and all who could deserted the city. Among
those who remained to minister to the sick, was Dr. Benja-
min Rush, whose treatment of the disease was eminently
successful. This illustrious man was a native of Pennsylva-
nia, and a graduate of Edinburgh University, whence he
returned to practise in Philadelphia. A signer of the Decla-
ration of Independence and a medical writer whose works
are still studied with proﬁt, Dr. Rush was distinguished alike
as a patriot and a man of letters. He died in 1813, at the
age of 72.

436. Hardly had the country recovered from the alarm
created by the pestilence, when a renewal of difficulties in

Weste1‘n Pennsylvania produced fresh consternation. The

people, there, had been encouraged to open insurrection
by the course of Mr. Ge-net’, the agent of the revolution-
ary party in France, whose arrival in America had been
the signal for the organization of democratic societies hostile
to government, on the plan of the J acobin clubs of Paris.

paid on whiskey. The U. S. Marshal was ﬁred upon, the

Inspector ﬂed, and his guard was forced to surrender to a
company of insurgents. The “ whiskey rebellion” having
assumed this dangerous aspect, Washiiigton issued a requi-
sition for a force sufﬁcient to suppress it. Gen. Henry Lee,
then governor of Virginia, was placed in command, and

,Hamilton accompanied the army. On reaching the seat of

the rebellion [October, 1794], it was found that the insur-=
gents had dispersed. Gen. Morgan, with a considerable
force, was left west of the mountains during the winter, and
no further trouble from this cause was experienced.

437. Meantime Gen. ‘Wayne was cautiously advancing,
with over three thousand men, on his expedition against the
western Indians. On the 13th of August, 1794, having
reached the neighborhood of the Mauniee'Rapids, where the

‘enemy had assembled, heidispatched a messenger to their

camp with propositions of peace. Ten days were asked for
consideration; but VVayne still advanced, and on the 19th
the hostile tribes met in council. Elated by their former
success, most of the chiefs ﬁercely pronounced for War. Lit-
tle Turtle alone dissented. Twice, he said, they had defeated
the Americans ; they could not always expect the same good
fortune. The pale-faces were now led by a chief who never
slept, and something told him that they should listen to his
offers of peace. The counsels of the wise Miami were disre-
garded. War was decided upon, and Blue Jacket, a Shaw-=
nee warrior, was elected commander—in-chief.

At a late hour that night two of Wayne’s soldiers entered
the Red Men’s camp, to discover their decision. The war-
riors slept ; a.nd the two spies stealthily advanced over their
prostrate bodies until they found an Indian girl awake. Pre-
senting their arms, they compelled her to follow, and, on
reaching a safe distance from the camp, obtained from her
the desired information. Never was a daring deed more
gallantly or successfully performed.

V-'AYNl<l’S SCOUTS IN THE INDIAN OAMI’.

The following morning, Wayne marched without delay
towards the Indian town. He was received with a warm
ﬁre; but an intrepid charge drove the Indians from their
cover, and put them completely to rout. The pursuit was
continued for several miles, and over two hundred of the
enemy were slain. All the Indian villages for a distance of
ﬁfty miles were destroyed, and one of the most beautiful
valleys of the West was reduced to desolation. So hum-»
bled were the Red Men of the North West Territory by this
defeat, that they expressed a general desire for peace. Wayne
invited them to a council in July, 1795, and offered to make
a treaty with them on condition that they would surrender
all the land east of a line drawn from Fort Recovery to the
mouth of the Kentucky River, embracing almost the whole of
what is now Ohio and part of Indiana. Some of the chiefs
objected to giving up so large a tract. An express was sent

of Wayne’s scouts. What did Wayne do the following morning? How was he re-
ceived? Give an account of the battle that followed. [See Map, p. 845.-—Where did

to consult the government on the subject, and instructions
were returned to Gen. Wayne not to insist on the line he
had proposed, but to accept that offered by the Indians,
Before these orders arrived, however, he had extorted from
some of the chiefs a reluctant assent to his terms, and, throw-
ing the instructions just received upon the table, he declared
that the treaty should be signed as it then stood. He car-
ried his point. The treaty was signed, and the contest of
years was ended.

“ Mad Anthony Wayne” was long remembered by the
Indians of the West. He is said to have told them, that,
if ever they violated their treaty, he would rise from his
grave to ﬁght them. VVhether this threat kept them faith-
ful to their agreement or not, it is certain that for years the
frontier enjoyed a security which it had never before known.
Having thus creditably performed his task, Wayne embarked
on Lake Erie, on his way to Philadelphia. VVhile the blasts
of December [1796] were tossing his vessel on the boisterous
waves, his spirit took its ﬂight from earth. The hero was
buried at Presq’ Ile, now Erie.

438. The Indian ‘War having been brought to a successful
close, the republicans next seized on the foreign policy of
Washington as a subject for the most violent condemnation.
On the breaking out of the French Revolution, it was thought
in this country that the people were honestly struggling for
liberty ; and many, gratefully remembering the aid extended
to America in her hour of need, proposed engaging actively
on the side of France in the wars that followed. Washing-
ton immediately issued a proclamation to the effect that strict
neutrality must be maintained. Genet, the French minister,
finding the government ﬁrm, threatened to appeal to the
people. This Washington regarded as an insult to the na-
tion, and at his request the obnoxious minister was recalled.

A storm of abuse from the opposite party followed. The

president was unjustly accused of a criminal regard for Brit-‘

ish interests, and even of drawing money from the treasury
without due authority. ' _

When the news arrived that John Jay, a.fter long negotia-
tions, had concluded a treaty with the English government,
Which provided for the surrender of the posts in the west,
and established more friendly relations between. the two coun-
tries, the excitement was increased. Mr. Jay was burned
in effigy, a copy of the treaty was consigned to the ﬂames
before his house in New York by a large_ concourse, and
Hamilton who attempted to address them, was driven from
the ground with stones. The republicans had a majority in
the house of representatives ; and the violent language used
by their leaders before that body convulsed the whole coun-
try. The people at last became alarmed for the consequences,’
and the opposition gradually became less violent. Washing-
ton, though urged to serve for a third term, declined a re-
election. In 17 97, he withdrew to private life, having pre-
viously in a Farewell Address laid before the nation his views
respecting their true policy. This parting advice has ever
been regarded by the people of the United States as one of
the most valuable treasures left them by the father of his
country.

439. In 1796, a third new state, Tennessee, was admitted
into the confederacy. It was originally a part of North
Carolina, and its pioneer settlers had gone through their
share of trial and suffering. In 1790, North Carolina relin-
quished its claim to the country, and it had been organized
by Congress as “ the Territory southwest of the Ohio”. In
1795, Tennessee had a population of 77,000. ~

olution, and was now one of the six captains of the infant
navy of the United States. In February, 1799, while cruisv
ing in the frigate Constellation, he fell in with the French
vessel ' L’Insurgente [lamp/-soar-2/’L0nt’], which surrendered
after a spirited action. The next year, he encountered an-
other French _frigate, La Vengeance [laIz-v07z§/-z/Lo7zs’ ]. Ail
ter an action of ﬁve hours the enemy was silenced; but a
gale separated the combatants, and the French vessel escaped.
She afterwards entered port in a shattered condition, with
160 men killed or wounded.

442. Gen. Washiiigton did not live to see peace restored.
Exposure to a slight rain brought on inﬂammation and fever,
which proved fatal on the 14th of December, 1'7 99. Wlien

he found that death was approaching, he said to his physi- ,

cian, “I am dying—-—but I am not afraid to die.” Calmly
the good and great man met his end. The death of Wash»
ington was regarded as a national bereavement. Due hon-
ors were paid to his memory in Congress. Party spirit was
for a time forgotten, and the whole country mourned its
illustrious father. '
443. Alarmed at the bold appeals of the partisans of France
and their violent denunciations of the government, the fed-
eralists succeeded in passing through Congress two bills,
known as the Alien and the Sedition Law. The former au-
thorized the president to require all aliens, or foreigners,
whom he considered dangerous to the peace of the country,
to depart within such a time as he should specify. The latter
forbade, under certain penalties, conspiracies against govern»
ment, and all publications designed to bring it into disre~
pute. The passing of these bills awakened more violent
opposition than ever. The legislatures of Virginia and Ken-
tucky declared them unconstitutional and void. Happily
the conclusion of peace, in 1800, with Napoleon, who had
become First Consul of France, allayed the excitement, and

43. The Mexicans and Peruvians were no doubt descend-
ants of the earliest settlers of the continent, who, as before
described, emigrated to it at so early a period that they still
retained the arts known in the East. They originally occu-
pied the fertile valleys of our great North American rivers,
and left in them numerous monuments of their industry and
skill. Allured by the more genial climate or driven out by

later emigrants from Asia, they afterwards found their way A

southward, and ﬁnally settled in the fertile plains of Central
America a.nd Peru. There, leading an agricultural life, they
retained their knowledge of art for many generations; while

the northern tribes, neglecting tillage and giving themselves‘

up to the chase, sunk deeper and deeper in barbarism. That
such is their history we have additional proof in the resem-
blance between the skulls of the ancient mound-builders, as
found in their burial-places, and ‘those of the Mexican In-
dians, both strikingly diﬁerent from the skulls of the northern
tribes. The National Annals of the Mexicans, moreover,
state that they originally dwelt in the North, whence they
commenced A ‘in”ig1'atin g in the sixth century under their illus-

444. In December, 1800, Congress met for the ﬁrst time
at the city of Wasliiiigton, which has ever since been the
national capital. It is situated in the District of Columbia,
a tract originally ten miles square, presented to the general
government by Maryland and Virginia. The portion given
by Virginia was afterwards ceded back to that state, so that
the District is now conﬁned to the Maryland side of the Po-
tomac. The city was laid out in 1792; and its population
in 1800 amounted to over 8,000. It lay in the midst of a
wilderness, described as containing“ here and there a small
cottage, without a glass window, interspersed among the
forests, through which you travel without seeing any human
being”.

Thomas Jefferson, and Aaron Burr, of New York. Wlien

the electoral votes were counted, it was found that J e1"lE‘erson,

In 1802, the eastern

448. One of the most important acts of J eﬁ'erson’s admiri-
istration was the purcha.se of Louisiana. Napoleon had in
1800 compelled the Spanish government to cede this exten-
sive tract to France, and had made every preparation for
establishing at the mouth of the Mississippi a strong military
colony, conveniently situated for encroaching on the neigh-
boring territories of Great Britain, Spain, and the United
States, as his ambition might dictate. Notwithstanding the
protest of the American minister, 20,000 men under Berna-

to sail for the new world., when a fresh quarrel with England
changed the plans of the French emperor. Heinow resolved
to concentrate all his forces for an-invasion of the British
Isles, and oﬁered to sell Louisiana to the U. S. The Ameri-
can ministers, James Monroe and Robert R. Livingston,
though unauthorized to make so extensive a purchase, took
the responsibility of closing with B.onaparte’s offer. The
advantages of the arrangement were so obvious that it was
promptly ratiﬁed by the home government. Fifteen millions
of ‘dollars were paid for this valuable territory, about one-
ﬁfth of which was allowed as an indemnity for injuries com-
mitted by the French on the commerce of the United States.

449. The American government, following the example of
the maritime powers of Europe, had sought to protect its
commerce in the Mediterranean from the depredations of
piratical craft by paying tribute to the Barbary States (as
the countries on the northern coast of Africa are called).
When Capt. Bainbridge visited Algiers in 1800, with a na-
tional frigate, to make the annual payment, the dey, or gov-
ernor, wishing to send an ambassador to Constantinople,
demanded the use of his vessel for that purpose. To Bain-
bridge’s remonstrances the dey insolently replied, “ You pay
me tribute, by which you become my slaves, and therefore I
have a right to order you as I think proper.” As the guns
of the fort bore directly upon his vessel, the American captain
was obliged to submit. He borethe dey’s agent to Constan-
tinople, and was the first tounfurl the banner of his country
in that harbor. The Turks had never heard of the United
States; but on learning that their visitors were from the
new world discovered by Columbus, they treated them with
marked courtesy.

Subjected to such annoyances and ﬁnding that American
commerce still suffered, the U. S. government remonstrated
in such strong terms as to provoke a declaration of war on

plans? What did he then propose? How did the American ministers receive his offer?

[tm'p’-o-Z6]. In October, 1803, Commodore Preble [g0re'6’—Z)eZj
arrived before Tripoli with a naval force; still the bashaw
refused to treat. While reconnoitring the harbor, the Phil—-

. adelphia, an American vessel, had struck on a rock, and fallen

a prey to the Tripolitans, who consigned its crew to slavery.
Lieutenant Decatur undertook to destroy this ship in the
enemy’s harbor. Followed by seventy volunteers, he board-
ed her, drove the enemy from -her deck, and made good his
retreat in the face of the Tripolitan batteries, Without losing
a single man.

In August, 1804, the American commodore commenced
bombarding the city. The ﬁre was continued for ﬁve hours,
during which several gun-boats of the enemy were destroyed
and their fort received serious injury. Alarmed by this, as
well as by the news that Eaton, the American consul, was
approaching overland with an army, in conjunction with the
rightful bashaw, Yusef at length‘ came to terms, and the
American ﬂag was for some years treated with respect by
the Barbary powers.

450. Hamilton, on leaving the cabinet, had ﬁxed his resi»
dence atNew York, where he devoted himself to the practice
of law, and obtained the highest eminence in that profession.
His chief rival, both in law and politics, was Aaron Burr, a
man of great talents but little principle, whom We have
already mentioned as having been elected to the vice-presi-
dency. While still holding that oﬁice, Burr ran for governor
of the state of New York, but was defeated by a large ma-
jority, owing in a measure to Hamilton’s inﬂuence. This,
added to other causes, led Burr to challenge his illustrious
rival. Unhappily, the latter accepted, and the duel was
fought at VVeehawken,‘July 11, 1804. Hamilton fell mora

in a duel. The death of Hamilton from such a cause pro-
duced a profound sensation. Men of all parties had regarded
him as the most brilliant ornament of the nation. They had
felt that “whoever was second, Hamilton must be ﬁrst”. '

451. From this time Burr was loathed by his countrymen.
George Clinton, of New York, superseded him in the vice-
presidency, while Jefferson was reelected president by a large
majority, and entered on his second term March 4, 1805.
After bidding adieu to the senate in an eloquent valedictory,
Burr took a tour through the West, visiting the principal
towns, and everywhere leaving the impression that he con-
templated some grand scheme not yet to be disclosed. His
design seems to have been either to wrest Mexico from Spain,
or to detach the West from the Union and erect it into a
separate government with himself at its head. In July, 1806,
in a letter to Gen. Wilkinson, whom he desired to interest in
his enterprise, he partially unfolded his plans, and announced
that seven thousand “choice spirits” were pledged to their
support. Wilkinson communicated this information to the
president, and Burr’s movements were thenceforth narrowly
watched.

452. On a beautiful island in the Ohio, near Marietta, an
Irish exile named Blen-ner-has’-set had erected an elegant
mansion, which he and his accomplished wife had rendered a
centre of attraction to people of reﬁnement throughout the
neighboring country. Burr, who was a man of fascinating
manners, gained admission to this paradise and induced its
owner to participate in his schemes. The lovely island soon
became the chief resort of the conspirators, and Burr re-
mained there till he had completed his plan of operations.
After his departure, the authorities of Virginia sent an officer
to arrest Blennerhasset. He was received by the high-
spirited mistress of the island, who, with a pistol in each

hand, ordered him to depart on pain of instant death. The
officer deemed it prudent to retire, and Blennerhasset made
good his escape. He reached Bermuda, and was there known
as a lawyer as late as 1887.

4.53. Meanwhile Burr’s operations were so openly carried
on that the government could no longer hesitate. Instruc-
tions were issued to suppress the expedition, and early in
1807 its leader Was arrested and taken to Richmond for trial.
Two indictments were found against him, one for treason,
the other for organizing an expedition against a country with
which the U. S. was at peace. While awaiting trial, Burr
was committed to the common jail, where criminals of every
grade were conﬁned. A blanket was given him for a bed,
and marking out a space for himself he lay down to rest.
The wretched inmates of the place wondered as they beheld
a man who had wanted but one vote to make him president
of the U. S. reduced to their own level——and wondered still
more to see him sleeping calmly after such a reverse of for-
tune. His trial excited intense interest. The jury returned
a verdict of “ not guilty”, a result to which Mr. Burr’s able
defence and unsurpassed powers of persuasion no doubt con—
tributed much. Though he escaped the penalty of treason,
his public career was at an end. . He returned to the practice
of law, but, all conﬁdence i11 his integrity being lost, the re-

’ mainder of his life was passed in obscurity. He died in 1836,

at the age of 80.

454. The territory now called Oregon was little known to
the world even two centuries after other parts of the Paciﬁc
coast had been explored. Navigators, in quest of a northern
passage between the oceans, had sought a harbor on its in-
hospitable shore, but without success till May, 1792, when
Captain Gray, of Boston, entered the mouth of a noble river,
which he called “Columbia”’from the name of his vessel.

The United States immediately laid claim to the region
drained by this river and its tributaries. In 1804, at Jeffer-
son’s suggestion, a party of thirty-ﬁve soldiers and hunters
Was sent out under Captain Lewis and Lieutenant Clarke, to
cross the Rocky Mountains and explore the continent as far
as the mouth of the Columbia. They spent the Winter of
1804-5 among the Mandan Indians at the Falls of the Mis—
souri. In the spring they resumed their journey, and No-
vember brought them to their point of destination.

The adventures of the explorers Were embodied in a nar-
rative Which was read With avidity by thousands. They had
passed more than two years at a distance from civilized so-
ciety, had travelled 6,000 miles among savage tribes, and
returned with the loss of but a single man. Hair-breadth
escapes often saved them from the ferocious beasts of the
forest and Indians’ hardly less ferocious. One night some of
the party espied a huge grizzly bear near a river by which

towards them, and on the way received another volley from
two of the hunters who had prudently reserved their ﬁre.
Before they could reload, the angry beast was upon them, and
they ﬂed to the river. Two found refuge in a boat, and the
others, hiding in a clump of willows, wounded him again a.nd
again till they also were forced into the water. The bear
pursued, and had almost overtaken one of the hunters when
hekreceived a bullet in his brain and fell.

’ 455. In 1805 and the two following years, American com-
merce suifered much from British aggressions. The United
States maintained a strict neutrality in the Wars that were

- convulsing Europe, but their rights as a neutraltnation were
 disregarded. Vessels sailing under their flag on the high

‘t 3:

 seas were subjected to frequent and ﬂagrant injuries. Eng-
 land authorized her oﬂicers to stop them, to examine their
 crews, and impress for their own ships whatever seamen they
-chose to regard as British subjects. These outrages Ameri-
can vessels were often too weak to ‘resist. The frigate Ches-
 apeake, when starting on a distant voyage, was unexpectedly
 attacked by the British’ ship Leopard, which had been en-

 joying the hospitality of an American port. Several of her
 a’*?:§;1'exv were killed, and four men were impressed and carri_ed on
 board of the Leopard, 011 the plea that they were deserters.

in relation to the aggressions "of England, all respected him
as a man of high talents and stern integrity, who had labored
honorably and successfully for his country. An epitaph
placed on his monument by his own direction tells us that
he was the “ Author of the Declaration of Independence;
of the statute for religious freedom in Virginia; and the
father of the University of Virginia”.

457. Before leaving this period, We must notice one of
those great inventions that mark an epoch in the World’s his-
tory. Its projector Was Robert Fulton, a native of Penn-
sylvania, at this time about forty years of age. His educa-
tion Was imperfect, and he had ﬁgured in early life as a
sketcher of landscapes and portraits. During a visit to Eng-
land, he learned What Was then known respecting the powers
and applications of steam, and conceived the idea of employ-
ing it in navigation. The poet Darwin, shortly before, in
the spirit of prophecy, had Written,

“Soon shall thy arm, unconquered steam, afar
Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car,”——-
and Fulton resolved to bring the prophecy to pass.

l Full of the thought, Fulton Went to Paris, and there-, amid
discouragements of various kinds, devised an engine adapted
to the purpose. In 1806, he returned to New York; and,
aided by Mr. Livingston, Whom he had met in France, he
commenced on the East River the construction of the first
steamboat. It was 100 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 7 feet
deep. The Work Went on, though it was prophesied on all
sides that it would  7
be a failure. At

steamboat in the World.

Their constant exercise kept them healthy. Deformity Was

almost unknown. among them 3 and they Were exempt from

many of the diseases of civilized life.

Descriptions of the Indians, as they originally appeared,
have been left by many of the early adventurers; among
others by Verrazzani [mi-mt-tscth’-me], Who ﬁrst saw them on
the coast of New Jersey and Staten Island, eighty-ﬁve years
before the discovery of the Hudson River, He Was there
visited by an Indian chief, Whom he describes asarrayed in

a robe of deer-skins skilfully Wrought With embroidery. His‘

hair Was ‘gracefully tied behind, and his neck Was adorned
With a large chain set oﬁ‘ With various stones. According to
this author, the people generally had regular features, Clark
expressive eyes, and long locks Which they dressed With
care. The Women Were attired in ornamented skins; their
hair Was tastefully braided and ﬂowed over the breast. The
southern Indians Wore head-dresses of feathers. As the heat
increased towards the-south, the clothing of the natives be-
came lighter and scantier ; and in the Warmest regions much
of the body Was left bare.

obliged to change his residence. Wigwains Were generally
found grouped together in villages.

458. In the summer of 1809, Thomas Paine, whose wri-
tings had been of great service to the patriot cause in the
Revolution, died in his 7 3rd year. He was born in Norfolk,
England, received an imperfect education, and in early life
followed his father’s vocation, which was that of a stay-maker.
A political pamphlet, of which he was the author, introduced
him to the notice of Franklin, by Whose advice he Went to
America. He arrived on the eve of the Revolutionary strug—
gle, and, by his famous pamphlet entitled “ Common Sense”
and other publications, helped to impress on the minds. of
the people the necessity of an entire separation from the T110.‘
ther country. The legislature of Pennsylvania recognized
his services by presenting him £500. Congress voted him
$3,000; and from New York he received 500 acres of land.
Paine subsequently took part in the French Revolution, but
was arrested and imprisoned, and narrowly escaped with his
life. At the age of 65, he returned to America; but his at»
tacks on religion, added to his intemperate habits, prevented
him from being treated with the consideration which he
would otherwise have received, and his life closed in obscua
rity and wretchedness.

gotiations, left London on the 1st of March, 1811 ; and short-
ly afterwards Mr. Madison dismissed the British minister.

460. While affairs were in this position, Captain Bingham,
of the British sloop-of-war Little Belt, discovered at a dis-
tance the American ship President, under Commodore Rod»-
gers, and gave chase. As he neared the President, Captain
Bingham began to doubt whether he was authorized in ma-
king an attack, and: ﬁnally altered his course. The Ameri-

gun was ﬁred from the Little Belt, and an engagement fol-

of her men were disabled. On the President, but one was

462. The rapid strides with which the western Indians
beheld civilization advancing upon them once more awakened
their hostility, and made them ready, despite their fears of
Wayne’s threat, to unite under the ﬂrst shrewd leader that
should present himself. Such a leader was found in the
Shawnee chief Tecumseh. This famous “ king of the woods”
was born on the Mad River, Ohio, in 1768. He was distin-
guished in childhood for bravery and endurance, and, when
he grew up, took part in the various battles fought by his
people in defence of their hunting-grounds. He had uni-
formly opposed the cession of territory to the United States,
and had refused his signature to the treaty made with Wayne.
Finding it for the time useless to resist, he had then tried to
wean his countrymen from their intemperate habits, and to
form such a combination among all the Indian tribes as would
prevent any further sale of their lands. Partial success in
these efforts encouraged Tecumseh to assume a bolder tone.
He denied the validity of existing treaties; and, when the
U. S. agent remonstrated with him for transgressing the
bounds settled by Wayne, he replied that “the Great Spirit

above knew no bounds, neither would his red children ac- .

knowledge any”. ,

The eiforts of the Shawnee chief were seconded by his
brother, who pretended to be a prophet sent by the Great
Spirit to reform his countrymen. While Tecumseh was en-
gaged in visiting the frontier tribes for a distance of 1,000
miles, the Prophet was acquiring great inﬂuence among the
adjacent nations. Crowds ﬂocked to hear the new doctrines
which he preached. He ﬁnally ﬁxed his head-quarters at the
mouth of the Tippecanoe (in the western part of Indiana),
where he built a town for his followers. Supported by his
brother"s inﬂuence and encouraged by British agents, Te»

cumseh in 1810 felt that the time for action had arrived. A
messenger was sent to Gov. Harrison to ask for a conference,‘
and the wily chief received permission to visit Vincennes
with a small party of warriors. He came with 400. The
suspicions of the ‘general were awakened, and in making ar-

rangements for the council, which was held in a grove near V

the town, he took care to provide against treachery. It was
well he did so. While he was speaking in reply to Tecum-
seh, the latter insolently interrupted him, and the other Red
Men made hostile movements as if for an attack. The de-
cisive measures of Gov. Harrison, however, overawed them,
and Tecumseh was allowed to depart with a rebuke for his
perﬁdy.

463. In 1811, after paying Grov. Harrison another visit,
and disavowing all hostile purposes, Tecumseh went to the
South, to bring over the Greeks to his league. Some of the
tribes willingly listened to his ﬁery harangues, and accepted
the bundle of red sticks, which was the emblem of their
union for a bloody war; but one of the Georgia chiefs ‘re-
ceived the sticks in such a way that Tecumseh distrusted his
sincerity. Sternly eyeing the suspected warrior, he threat-
ened the whole tribe with the vengeance of Heaven, and
declared that when he reached Detroit he would stamp on
the ground and shake down every house in their village.
The Creeks counted the days; and by a strange coincidence,
when the predicted time had about arrived, the whole south-
ern country was visited by an earthquake. Trees that had
borne the gales of centuries trembled and fell; the waters of
the Mississippi were convulsed; and the town of New Ma»
drid was swallowed up by its boiling waves. As the terri-»
ﬂed Creeks beheld the earth shake and their wigwams totter
and fall, they remembered the vengeful words of the Shaw-
nee, and cried in consternation, “Tecumseh has reached
Detroit!”

rison hastened from point to point, exhorting his men to keep

The wounds inflicted by the Indians were unusually pain-
ful, in consequence, as it was afterwards found, of their hav-
ing chewed their bullets, and thus given them a rough sur«;
face, which tore the ﬂesh and caused poignant torture. Every
charge of the savages was followedby fearful screams from

‘the wounded. Still the troops maintained their line. Gen.

Harrison, though marked for special aim, escaped With no
further injury than the loss of a lock of hair, cut off by a
bullet. At last the wished-for dawn appeared. The assail~
ants were soon dislodged from their cover, and pursued to
a neighboring swamp. They left 40 dead upon the ﬁeld;
the Americans lost 62 killed, and 126 more or less ‘injured.
Gren. Harrison, as tender-hearted as he was prudent and
brave‘, carefully ministered to the wounded, and shared his
stores with his men, who for a time had no food but horse-
ﬂesh. The Prophet’s town was destroyed, and the victorious
army returned to Vincennes. ' The defeat of Tippecanoe was
a severe blow to Tecumseh. In hazarding a battle during
his absence, the Prophet disobeyed his direct commands, and
thus forfeited his conﬁdence ; nor did the Indians any longer
believe inthe sacred character of one whose predictions and
promises had proved utterly false.

to arm? and equip their proportion of 100,000 militia for the
defence of the coast and frontier. Import duties generally

were doubled, and a loan-of $11,000,000 was authorized.

While the country was anxiously waiting for Great Brit-
ain’s ﬁnal response, Louisiana was admitted as the seven—
teenth state of the Union [April 8, 1812], and the Territory
of Missouri was organized, with St. Louis as its capital.
Soon after the answer of the British ministry arrived. They
would abandon no measures, however injurious or oﬁensive
to the United States, which the War with -France made it
their interest to employ. All hope of peace was now laid
aside. Clay, Calhoun, and others, tool; the ground that fun-
ther submission would be incompatible with the honor of
America. Accordingly, war was declared by a vote of 7 9
to 49 in the house, and 19 to 13 in the senate. On the 18th
of June, 1812, President Madison signed the bill, and war
Was formally proclaimed the following day.

MADISON’S ADMINISTRATION (CONTINUED), 1812.

466. ON the declaration of war, Gen. Dearborn, of Massa»
chusetts, was appointed commander-in-chief of the American
army. His force consisted mostly of New York militia, sta-
tioned at Plattsburg and on the Niagara frontier. Twelve
hundred Ohio volunteers, raised while the question of war
was still under discussion, together with 300 regulars, were
placed under the command of Gen. William Hull, whose reve
olutionary services entitled him to the confidence of his
countrymen. Gen. Hull had been governor of Michigan

from the time of its organization as a territory in 1805 ; and
his representations, as well as the hope. of stopping the
machinations of British agents and the Indian outrages
which they had caused, led the U. S. government to project 
an invasion of Canada as the first step in the campaign.
Hull hastened to Dayton, Ohio, to take command of his men,
and led them by slow and laborious marches through the
wilderness towards Detroit. He soon realized‘ that this
small force was totally inadequate to the object proposed;
and the men, on their side, became equally convinced of the
inefﬁciency of their commander.

46 7. Gen. Hull had expected that war would be declared,
but by some mismanagement no news of that event reached

‘him till some time after it was known to the British. The

very day he received the intelligence, a boat containing his
baggage, stores, oiiicial papers, 850., was captured by the en-
emy. On the 9th of July, Hull received instructions to pro-
ceed with the invasion of Canada; and three days afterwards
he crossed to Sandwich, on the British side of the Detroit
River. With an

characterized by -indecision and ‘delay. By the time the
American general was ready to attack Malden,_the ﬁrst Brit-
ish fort that lay before him, it was strongly garrisonedlwith
regulars and militia. New difﬁculties now arose. Tecumseh
called his warriors to. the ﬁeld, and joined. the British army.
Supplies were cut oﬁ", and the invaders suffered for food.
An intercepted letter stated that all the Indians of the North
were preparing for a descent on the United States. Gen.
Dearborn had agreed with the governor of Canada to sus-
pend hostilities except on that part of the frontier occupied
by Hull; and Gen. Brock, thus released from the necessity
of defending Niagara, was hastening with reinforcements to
the relief of Malden. Hull was not the man to hazard an
attack with all these dangers before him. Hastily retreating,
heabandoned the Canada shore and returned to Detroit. . T
468. Mackinaw was at this time one of the most exposed
posts belonging to the United States. It was a great empo-
rium for furs, traders from Albany and Montreal resorting
thither at certain seasons to buy from the Indians the prod-
ucts of their traps and riﬂes. Before the feeble garrison at
this place had heard that war was declared, theywere at-
tacked by a force of British and Indians, and obliged to
surrender. J   A ~ I a
469. No sooner had Gen. Brock reached Malden and as-
sumed command of the whole British army, than he led
his forces to Sandwich, and prepared to attack ,Detroit.
Tecumseh was the only one acquainted with the surrounding
country, and the British commander called on him for infor-
mation. Spreading a piece ofelm bark on the ground, he
drew his knife and without hesitation sketched an accurate
plan of the .whole region, with its hills, rivers, roads, and
marshes. Brock was so pleased with this ready display of
talent that _he took a sash from his person and bound it
round the waist of his ally. About this time, Tecumseh was
made a general in the British army. ' ‘

B On the 16th of August, 300 British regulars, 450 Canadians,
and 600; Indians, crossed the river a short distance below
Detroit, under cover of several armed vessels. No attempt
was made to prevent them from landing; but,.on.their march
to the fort, they were annoyed by parties of Americans. The
latter, also, stoodready to receive them at their advanced
battery, which was favorably planted, in such a way as to
sweep with grape-shot the approaching columns of the en-
emy. .There was every prospect of a’ successful resistance;
but, at the critical moment when the order to ﬁre was ex-
pected, Hull, unable to repress his fears, seemed to lose all
presence of mind. Hardly had shots ‘been interchanged,
when, to the chagrin of his men, who are said to have wept
when they beheld the disgraceihl. signal, he raised a white
ﬂag over the fort. No stipulations were made for the honors
of war. Not only Detroit, with its garrison, stores, and pub-
lic property of every kind, but the whole of Michigan, was
surrendered to the British.

"470. Gen. Hull was afterwards exchanged for thirty British
prisoners, and tried by a court-martial for treason and cow-
ardice. Col. Cass (now U. S.‘ senator from Michigan) and
other oﬁficers who had served under him condemned him in
unmeasured terms; at the same time, it was clear that gov-
ernment had ordered the invasion to be made with a very
inadequate force, and hadnot properly supported the army
of the Northwest or attended to the suggestions of its gen-
eral. Hull was found guilty of cowardice and sentenced to
be shot; but, in consideration of his Revolutionary services,
he was pardoned by the president.

It was characteristic of the Indians never to provide much
food ata time, and therefore they often suffered from hun-

Without a murmur. When food was plenty, theymade up
for their privations by eating as much and as often as they
could. ‘

good a defence with his small garrison, proposed to surreno
der the post on condition that he and his men should be
allowed to retire in safety. The Indians assented; but,
learning that a quantity of powder and whiskey had been
destroyed to prevent its falling into their hands, they at-
tacked the retreating soldiers on their march, killed some,
and distributed the survivors among the neighboring tribes.
The next day they burned Fort Dearborn to the ground.

47 2. The mortiﬁcation of the American people at the loss
of Detroit was relieved by the triumphs of their brave sailors.

The whole efficient naval force of the country consisted of 8

frigates, 8 sloops and brigs, and 170 small gunboats. With
these was to be encountered the proud mistress of the ocean,
with her thousand vessels. About the middle of July, Cap-
tain Isaac Hull, in the American frigate Constitution, fell in
with a British squadron and was chased by ﬁve vessels, but

'managed to escape by superior seamanship. On the 19th of

August, while cruising near the Gulf of St. Lawrence, he en-
countered the Gruerriere [gcire-e-&ire'] one of the ﬁnest frigates
in the British navy. She had for some time been on the
lookout for Yankee craft, as her oﬁcers contemptuously
called them, and carried at her mast-heads two ﬂags, one
with her name, the other bearing the inscription “ Not the
Little Belt,” alluding to the vessel which had been roughly
handled by the President before the war. The Constitution
made ready for action, and approached the enemy. Broad-
sides were received from the Guerriere, and several men fell
at the guns. Thecrew burned with impatience to return
the ﬁre; still no order was given. At last the experienced
eye of Hull told him that he had reached the right position,
and in a voice of thunder he gave the word. Broadside
after broadside was poured in. The decks of the Guerriere
were swept; her masts fell; she became unmanageable and

struck her colors. Fifteen of her men Were killed and sixty-
three Wounded. She had received such injuries that it Was
impossible to bring her into port, and the next day she Was
blown up. The Constitution had but seven men killed and
seven Wounded. '

47 3. Capt. Porter, of the Essex, soon afterWards separated
’a British brig from her convoy, and found on board $14,000
in specie and 150 soldiers. He next captured the Alert after
an action of eight minutes. The frigate President had the
good fortune to overhaul an English packet With $200,000
on board; and the Argus took several valuable prizes Which
she brought safely into the port of New York. Lieutenant
Elliott (since Commodore) made an important capture on
Lake Erie in October, taking the Caledonia as she lay in
fancied security under the guns of a British fort, and bring-
ing her off With a cargo of furs Worth $200,000. Commo-
dore Chauncey also operated With success on the same lake,
having got together a few vessels mounting in all 32 guns,
With Which he kept in check a British ﬂeet bearing six times
that number.

474. Capt. Jacob Jones, in the sloop Wasp, also sustained
the honor of the American arms. On the 13th of October,
he met the British brig Frolic, convoying a ﬂeet of mer-
chantmen, and an action ensued. The Frolic ﬁred as she
rose on the Waves, and only injured the rigging of her antag-
onist. The Wasp poured in her broadside as she descended,
and nearly every shottold on the hull of the enemy. Have
ing approached the Frolic so near that his rammers While
he Was loading touched her side, Capt. Jones ordered his
men to board. A melancholy scene of destruction lay before
them. The decks Were covered With dead and dying. The
colors Were left ﬂying, only because there Was no one to
haul them down. But three oﬂicers and a private at the
helm Were left alive on deck. Unfortunately the Americans

could not secure their prize. The British seventy-four,
Poictiers, [pwa/z-zfe-c2’], coming along before the Wasp could
make sail, captured both vessels and took them into Bermuda.

4'7 5. The frigate United States was commanded by Capt.
Decatur, one of the heroes of the Tripolitan Wa1'.i On the
25th of -October, 1812, he encountered the British frigate
Macedonian off I the Azores. After an action of an hour and
a half, the Macedonian surrendered. Decatur was as distin-
guished for courtesy as courage. When Capt. Carden: ten-
dered his sword to him, he replied that he could not think
of taking the sword of an oﬂicer’ who had defended himself
so gallantly, but would be happy to grasp his hand.

47 6. Commodore Bainbridge, in the Constitution, on the
29th of December, added another to the brilliant triumphs
of the American navy. Running along the coast of Brazil,
he ‘descried a British frigate, and gave chase. After a spir-
ited action, which lasted an hour, the enemy struck. The
captured vessel was found to be the Java. She carried fewer
guns than the Constitution, but a larger force; having, be-
sides her regular crew, 100 men designed for the East India
service. , C .

The news of these achievements raisedthe national en-
thusiasm to the highest pitch. Those hearts of oak who
had thus -won gloryfor America on a ﬁeld where it was least
expected, received the grateful homage of the nation. Con-
gress rewarded them with complimentary resolutions as well
as something more substantial. Fifty thousand dollars was
appropriated as prize money to the Constitution for the cap-
tureof the Guerriere, and a like amount for the Java. The
crew of the Wasp received $25,000 ; and $100,000 went to
the captors of the Macedonian. Besides those mentioned,

there was immediate necessity for reinforcements to meet
the fresh columns of British and Indians, advancing under
Gen. Sheaffe [shefe], Van Rensselaer returned to Lewiston
to hasten the embarkation of his remaining troops. The
men stood ready on the shore ; but the sight of their wound-
ed comrades brought back to camp had suddenly dampened
their ardor. They denied the constitutional right of the
general to lead them out of their own state, and refused to
embark. Meanwhile those on the Canada side, thus basely
abandoned to the enemy, after maintaining for a while an
unequal struggle, at length had to surrender. Sixty were
killed, 100 wounded, and the rest were taken prisoners. Van
Rensselaer resigned his command in disgust, and was suc-
ceeded by Gen. Smyth, who was a good tactician, but had
seen little service. Afterprojecting two invasions of Can;
ada, both of which were unsuccessful, Smyth also resigned.

4'7 8. Thus far the reverses of the Americans on land had
been as decided as theirtriumphs on the ocean. Twice
they repulsed the enemy at Ogdensburg, and these suc-
cesses, with the defeat of a party of British and Indians by
Col. Pike during a rapid incursion into Canada, were the
only victories of which they could boast. Nothing more
was attempted during the remainder of the season. The
presidential election engrossed the attention of the people
during the fall, Madison being warmly opposed by those who
condemned the war. He was chosen, however, for another
term, and the vice-presidency was conferred on Elbridge
Gerry, of Massachusetts. ‘ y

CHAPTER VI.

MADISON’S ADMINISTRATION (CONTINUED), 1813.

480. EARLY in 1813, in deference to public sentiment,
Madison made some changes in his cabinet; appointing

William Jones, of Pennsylvania, head of the navy depart»,

ment, and Gen. Armstrong secretary of war. James Mon»
roe, who had been secretary of state ever since the com-
mencement of the war, continued at the head of the cabinet.
The thirteenth Congress commenced an extra session on the
24th of May. Daniel Webster‘ took his seat for the ﬁrst
time in the house of representatives, and Henry Clay was
reelected speaker. The federalists, as a body, constantly
voted against the measures proposed by government. Some
of them, however, including Rufus King, senator from New
York, supported the president on the ground, that, though
unwisely commenced, the war should be vigorously prose»
cuted.

‘481. The only force in the ﬁeld for the protection of the
Western frontier, after the fall of Detroit, was a body of Ken-»
tucky volunteers, who had promptly responded to the call
of the executive, before the news of Hull’s surrender was
received. In accordance with the universal wish, the gov-
ernor 0“' Kentucky had appointed Gen. Harrison to the com-
mand of this force, though he was not a resident of the state.
Hardly had Harrison joined his men, and inspired them with

reiissembling of Congress? Of what did the opponents of the war complain? What
measures were taken by Congress?

480. Early in 1813, what changes were made in the cabinet? Who remained secre-
tary of state? When did Congress meet? Who appeared in the lower house for the
first time? Who was elected speaker? What was the course of most of the federalists ?

conﬁdence and enthusiasm, when he was obliged to give way
to Gren.iWinchester, whomrthe national government had ap-
pointed to the command" of the ‘northwestern. army; The
volunteers expressed their dissatisfaction freely 3 and it was
found expedient to yield to their wishes, and supersede Win-
chester with the veteran who more than all others enjoyed
the conﬁdence of the West. With his commission Harrison
received extraordinary powers, which no ofﬁcer before him
had enjolyed except Washington and Greene in the Revolu-
tion. He was required to defend the whole frontier from

1 Pennsylvania to Missouri, and immediately began to reor-

ganize the army.
, October, 1812, found Harrison and his men on the march
for Detroit, which post it was resolved to recover. Their
route lay through a swamp that seemed interminable, and
the soldiers suffered much. Their officers, however, bore
every hardship with them, and they continued to advance.
Their progress was necessarily slow, and the approach of
winter obliged Gen. Harrison to defer the attack on Detroit
till spring. He ﬁxed his headquarters at Franklinton, Ohio,
and stationed a division of his army, under Gen. Winchester,
at Fort Deﬁance, on the Maumee. , A .
r 482. Early in January, 1813, Winchester received inf'or-=
rnation that the inhabitants of Frenchtown, on the Raisin
River, were in danger of attack; and, though he thereby
ran the risk of disconcerting the plans of his commander, he
marched forth to their help. The enemy were found and dis»
persed. Shortly afterwards, Winchester’s camp was attacked
by an army of 1,500 British and Indians, from Malden, under
Proctor. After a struggle, which cost each party not far
from 800 men, the surviving Americans surrendered on the

command by the governor of Kentucky? Who, by the national government? What

' change did the administration soon ﬁnd it expedient to make? What powers were in-

trusted to Gen. Harrison? What was he required to do? Where were Harrison and
his men in October, 1812? What post was it proposed to recover? Give an account
of their march. What did the approach of winter compel Harrison to do? Where did
he fix his headquarters? Where was Gen. Winchester stationed? 482. What infor-

gave.free vent to their passions, robbing, torturing, and scalp-
ing their defenceless victims. The British oﬁicer left in com-
mand made‘ no attempt to save the suﬁerers. To revenge
the losses they had sustained in the battle, the Indians ﬁnally
set ﬁre to two houses in which most of the Wounded Were
crowded, driving back into_ the ﬂames those Who attempted
to escape. Such of the Americans as survived these atroci-
ties vvere taken to Detroit, Where they Were dragged
through the streets and olfered for sale. The people of the
place sacriﬁced every thing they could spare to ransom them,
and remonstrated with Proctor for allowing such barbarities,
but Without effect. c

483. The loss of this important division deranged General
Harrison’s plans. He was too Weak to attack Detroit, and
could only hope to hold the ground already occupied. Fort

.Meigs [mega] Was commenced at the Rapids of the. Maumee;

and the Whole American force, 1,200 strong, labored day
and nightto complete it before the enemy should gather for
its attack. They needed all their haste. Hardly had they
completed their Works, and surrounded them With a ditch
dug in the frozen ground, When Proctor with his British, and
Tecumseh With 600 Warriors from the Wabash, appeared
before the fort. Their batteries opened on the 1st of May,
but a high breastvvork of earth protected the Americans, and
little impression was made on their defences. The Indians
ﬁred into the fort from trees, ivhich they climbed for the pur-

pose. On one occasion, a soldier Was mortally Wounded at

on which the general was sitting. Still he escaped, though
constantly employed in directing the defences. His exam-
ple made every man a hero. ‘ ‘ .
On the 4th of May, news reached the beleaguered garri-
son that Gen. Clay, who had come by rapid marches with a
reinforcement of 1,200 Kentuckians, was within a few miles
of the fort. Harrison sent orders that a detachment from

-this force should land on the left side of the river and de-

stroy the British batteries, While a sortie was made from the
fort against those on the right side. The latter movement
succeeded, and 45 prisoners Were taken. On the left side,
Col. Dudley was less fortunate. His men gallantly drove
the British from their batteries; but the joy of Gen. Harri-

son, who was watching them with his glass, was turned into

consternation, when, instead of retreating to their boats, ac-
cording to his orders, he saw them preparing to maintain

their position. Already the main body of the enemy was

in motion to intercept them. Foreseeing their fate unless
they saved themselves by an immediate retreat, Harrison
oifered $1,000 to any one who would cross the river and

warn Col. Dudley of his danger. The mission was under-_

taken; but, before the messenger could get across, the Amer-
icans were cut oﬂi About 80 were killed, and 550 taken
prisoners; 150 escaped to their boats.

The prisoners were treated with the usual barbarity. Gen.
Proctor took no pains to save them. The savages, while
glutting their thirst for blood, were suddenly startled by ter-
rible shouts in their own tongue, and the next moment Te—
cumseh dashed into the circle. Two Indians were in the act
of killing a helpless American who had surrendered. -Hurl-
ing the murderers to the earth, he drew his knife and tom-
ahawk, and dared any of the aﬂrighted throng to take the
life of an unresisting prisoner. Even Proctor escaped not

the rebuke of the indignant chief, who on various occasions
displayed a more Christian spirit than his Christian ally‘.
“Your Indians can not be restrained,” was Proctor’s answer.
“ Go put on petticoats,” indignantly interrupted Tecumseh;
“ you are not ﬁt to command men.” Finding that he could
neither frighten Harrison into a surrender, nor make any
impression on his defences, the British general soon aban-
doned the siege.

484. The gallantry ofA1nerican seamen, though not mark»
ed by the same uniform success as in the preceding year,
continued to be the theme of admiration. On the 23rd of
February, Capt. James Lawrence, in the Hornet, after hav-
ing shortly before captured a brig containing $20,000, en-=
countered oﬁithe coast of South America the Peacock, a
vessel about equal in size to his own. After an action of ﬁf=-
teen minutes, the Peacock struck, and raised signals of dis-
tress. She was found to be sinking rapidly, and, despite the
efforts of both victors and vanquished, went down, carrying
some of her own crew, and three of the Hornet’s. Captain
Lawrence, on his return to port, was greeted with the usual
honors, and appointed to the command of the frigate Chesa-
peake. Sailing out" of Boston, with imperfect equipments
and an ill-assorted crew, he met the British frigate Shannon,
Early in the action, the brave Lawrence was wounded. "His
last order as he was carried below, “D0786 give up the shijo./”
has ever since served as a watchword for American sailors.

. In a few moments, a hand grenade thrown from the deck of

the Shannon fell in the Chesapeake’s arm-chest and exploded

with disastrous effect. The enemy immediately boarded,’

and the Chesapeake was soon theirs. In killed and wound-
ed she had lost nearly 150 men, to 79 on the part of the
British. Capt. Lawrence expired after four days’ suffering
(at the age of 31), and was buried at Halifax with the hon—
ors of war. His remains were afterwards removed to New
York.

ginia, by whose supplies the ﬁrst settlers were kept from
starvation for a considerable time. Yet little advancewas
made in agriculture or a11y other branch of industry. There
were two reasons for this, besidesthe natural aversion of the
Indian to labor. First, he was dependent entirely on him-
self, having never tamed the animals around him or taught
them to labor in his behalf. In this he was behind the
rudest nations of the old world. The Tartar had his horse,
the Arabian his ca.mel, the Laplander his reindeer; but the
native American had no domestic animals, and was obliged
to rely entirely on his own strength. Moreover, the Indians
knew little of the useful metals. Gold, silver, and copper,
circulated among them to a certain extent, but of iron they
weretotally ignorant. With their awkward tools, the ‘sim-
plest tasks were performed with great difficulty. To fell a
tree with their stone hatchets Would cost a month; and to
turn up the ground with blunt and heavy hoes of the same
material, was a labor from which it is not strange that they
shrunk.

47. Hoqaitcaliz,‘-2J.——Tl1e hospitality of the Indian was one
of his greatest virtues. Among all the tribes, a stranger on
his arrival was treated with the utmost respect and atten-
tion. The best the Wigwam afforded was always placed
before him, and his hosts were displeased if he did not eat,
whether he needed food or not. However scanty their sup—
ply, they withheld nothing from their guest.

had cruised in the British Channel, committing great havoc
among the enemy’s shipping. Several vessels started in pur-
suit, one of which discovered her by the light of a ship that

that theycould not -draw them down ; but, after -an engage—

ment of more than half an hour, in which both commanders
were "mortally, ‘wounded, they cried for quarter and surren-

the sword of his vanquished adversary was presented to him,
he pressed it to his heart, and said, “ I die contented”. The
two commanders were buried side by side with military hone
ors at Portland.

485. In the spring of 1813, the British government, feeling
assured that the war with Napoleon would soon terminate,

‘sent over additional forces for the defence of their possessions

in the new world. . The Americans, not discouraged by the
last campaign, still contemplated an invasion of Canada; and
the brave Pike, now raised to the rank of brigadier-general,
was laboriously drilling 2,000 of his countrymen at Sackett.’s
Harbor, to prepare them fora descent as soon as the season
would allow. On the 25th of April, 1,700 picked men em‘;
barked ; and, crossing Lake Ontario, they landed on the 27th,
in face of a severe ﬁre from the enemy, two miles from To»
ronto (then called York), the capital of Upper Canada. Two
redoubts having been taken, Gen. Pike halted his columns
within 300 yards of the British barracks, which seemed to
be abandoned. An officer was sent forward to reconnoitre,
Suddenly the air was rent by a deafening explosion. The
earth shook. Huge logs and heavy masses of stones were
scattered in all directions. The British had connected a
slow match with their magazine, and lighted it as they re?
tired. .

Had the Americans not halted as they did, few would have
survived to tell the sad story; as it was, 200 of their number
were instantly killed or wounded. Pike was felled to the

mutilated frame, he cried out to his men, “Move on, my
brave fellows, and revenge your general!” And they did
move on, with three loud huzzas. The British gave way.
Gen. Sheaffe, with a portion of his regulars, escaped; the
rest surrendered. York, together with public property to the
amount of half a million of dollars, fell into the hands of the
victors. Among the trophies transmitted to the War De-
partment was the mace used by the speaker of the provincial
legislature, above which a human scalp was found. suspended.
Gen. Pike lived long enough to hear the victorious shouts of
his men and to have the captured ﬂag of the enemy placed
under his head; then the light gradually faded from his eye,
and he expired without a groan. This brave man had pre-
viously distinguished himself by his explorations in the ser-
vice of government, having been the first to penetrate the
wilds of Kansas and the valley of the Upper Mississippi.
486. After their victory at York, the American army, re-
inforced to 6,000 men, and led by Generals Dearborn and
Lewis, proceeded to Fort George near the mouth of the
Niagara River [see Map, p. 351]. This post was taken with-
out difﬁculty, and along with it a number of prisoners, though
most of the garrison made good their escape. The enemy,
in alarm, blew up their remaining posts on the Niagara River,
and retreated to Burlington Heights, at the western extrem-
ity of Lake Ontario. A superior force of Americans set out
in their pursuit, but were attacked at night by the British,
While encamped a few miles from their lines. The enemy
were so warmly received that they beat a retreat, but they

attack on the British could hardly have failed of success, for
their general also had been separated from his army in the
darkness, and was found the next day several miles from
camp with neither hat nor sword.-—During the absence of
the American troops on this expedition, a thousand of the
enemy made a descent on Sackett’s Harbor; after destroying
some of the stores there collected, they were repulsed by the
militia under Gen. Brown, with considerable loss.

487. After his unsuccessful siege of Fort Meigs, Proctor
had returned to Malden, where he remained several months
inactive. In the latter part of July, he again approached
Fort Meigs. Sending Tecumseh with his Indians into the
neighboring woods, to make a noise as if a battle were raging
there, he tried to draw the garrison out from their defences.
But Gen. Clay, who was in command, was not to be thus
deceived; and Proctor proceeded to attack Fort Stephenson
at Lower Sandusky [see Map, p. 345], commanded by Major
Croghan [c7°og"-am], a youth of twenty-one. Gen. Harrison,
on hearing of the threatened attack, sent word to Croghan
to retire with his garrison if artillery was brought against
the fort, unless such a force of Indians should be collected as
would render retreat dangerous. Before the order arrived,‘
the woods around the fort were already ﬁlled. The young
commander had no alternative but to hold out to the last
extremity, and he sent one of his runners to inform Harrison
of the fact. Supposing that his messenger might fall into
the hands of the enemy, and wishing to mislead them, he
closed his dispatch with these words, “ We have determined
to hold this place, and by heavens we can!” Contrary to
his expectation, the runner reached Gen. Harrison. The
dispatch was not -explained; and Harrison, thinking that
Croghan was wilfully disobeying orders, suspended him from

command. But the siege had alrea.dy commenced; no one
could reach the fort, and Croghan remained happily ignoran_t
of his general’s displeasure.

Five hundred British regulars and eight hundred Indians
appeared before the fort on the 1st of August. Proctor
called on the garrison to surrender, as the only means of es-
caping massacre when the fort should be taken. The heroic
Croghan answered, that, when the fort was taken, avmassacre
would do no harm, for none of its defenders would be left
alive. A brisk cannonade Was at once commenced by Proc-
tor. Croghan had nothing with which to reply except one
six-pounder; but, by ﬁring it from different points, he tried
to— make the enemy believe that he was well provided with
artillery. At length he judged from appearances that the
besiegers Would concentrate their forces on the northwest
angle of the fort; and here, having loaded his piece heavily

with slugs and grape-shot, he placed it in an embrasure care-

fully concealed from the enemy.
‘As he supposed, the British soon prepared to storm the
fort, and a column of 350 men approached the northwest

ﬂame burst from the masked cannon. Fearful was its exe-
cution. The ditch was ﬁlled with dead and dying. A gall-
ing ﬁre of musketry from the walls completed the discom-
ﬁture of the enemy. A retreat was ordered, and before
dawn the following day the whole army had disappeared.
Their loss was estimatedat 150, while the Americans had
but one killed and seven wounded. The conduct of Croghan
was readily explained to Harrison’s satisfaction, and loudly
applauded by his admiring countrymen. ‘

488; Commodore Chauncey’s victorious pennon now ﬂoat-
ed over the broad waters of Ontario, but the enemy were
still masters of Lake Erie; to Oliver H. Perry (a native of
Rhode Island, then in his 28th year) was assigned the diffi-
cult task of wresting it from them. The U. S. had no effi-
cient naval force on the lake; and Perry was obliged to
build his own brigs from the trees that fringed its shores.

:Wo1‘king with unremitting diligence, he soon had nine ves-

sels, carrying in all 54 guns, ready for action. With this
little ﬂeet, early in August, he stood boldly out into the lake;

and the British slowly retired before him. Their force, con-

sisting of six vessels, mounting 68 guns, was commanded by
Commodore Barclay, a veteran who had fought with Nelson
at the Nile and Traf-al-gar’, and had already lost an arm in

-the service of his country. Perry had never seen a naval

battle.

After proceeding to Sandusky Bay, where he Was fur-
nished with men by Gen. Harrison, Commodore Perry made
for Malden, and displayed the American ﬂag before the

stronghold of the enemy. The British ﬂeet seemed in no

hurry to meet him. On an island in the Detroit River sev-
eral thousand Indians had assembled, to Witness the expected
engagement. ’Mortiﬁed at the backwardness of his allies,
Tecumseh rowed over to Malden in his canoe to see What
was the matter. “ You told us,” said he to Proctor, “that
you commanded the Waters. Why do you not go out to
ﬁght the Americans? There they are, daring you to meet
them.” Proctor could hardly satisfy the impatient chief by
telling him that ‘the big canoes of his great father, King

~ George, were not quite ready’.

down towards the American ﬂeet with his vessels arrayed
in order of battle. Perry had longed for that " hour. His
ﬂag-ship, the Lawrence, engaged the two largest vessels of
the enemy and promptly returned their ﬁre for more than
two hours, till every man on board was killed or Wounded
except eight, who could manage but one gun and ﬁred it the
last time only with the aid of Perry himself. Finding he
could do nothing more in the Lawrence, the American com-i
mander leaped ina boat and transferred to the Niagara his
ﬂag, which bore the immortal words-of the dying Lawrence,
Don’t give up the ship.’ In performing this manceuvre, he
had to pass within pistol-shot of the British line; and, though
he stood proudly erect in his boat, a conspicuous mark for
the sharp-shooters of the enemy, heescaped uninjured. The
few survivors on the Lawrence gave three cheersas they saw
him mount the deck of the Niagara, and the battle was re-
newed more ﬁercely than ever. A c -»

if The smaller vessels came up and seconded the movement.

Numerous acts of heroism were performed, which will be
long remembered by a grateful nation. From one of the
vessels the last remaining sponge of the longest cannon fell
over into the lake. A gunner, seeing that without it the
best piece on board would become useless, coolly plunged
into the waves,_ recovered the important sponge, was drawn
up by his comrades, and was soon loading and ﬁring as
calmly as if nothing had happened. A seaman on board of
the Lawrence was struck by a cannon-ball in the shoulder,
but refused to be carried below, and with his remaining
hand rendered all the assistance in his power.

  .Within ﬁfteen minutes after Perry reached the Niagara,
the issue of the battle was decided. Commodore Barclay,
wounded and fainting from loss of blood, felt that there was
no alternative but surrender. His colors were hauled down;
and 600 men, »more. than the whole number of surviving
Americans, fell into ‘therhands of the victors. They were
treated with a kindness which was in marked contrast with
the barbarity of Proctor. Barclay always characterized his
conqueror as “ a gallant and generous enemy,” and declared
that his conduct to his prisoners was alone suﬂicient to im-=
mortalize him. About four hours after the action com-
menced, Perry sent the following’ expressive dispatch‘ to
Gen. Harrison :-—“ We have met the enemy and they are
ours———two ships, two brigs, one schooner, and a sloop.”
When the Americans took possession of Barclay’s ﬂag-
vessel, they found three Indians skulking in the cabin. Be-«
fore the engagement commenced, these- sharp-shooters, who
were eager to distinguish themselves in naval conflict, had
been placed in the round-tops, to pick off the American ofﬁa
cers with their riﬂes. Before they had a chance to display
their skill, however, the cannon-balls came whistling through
the rigging too close to be pleasant, and the heroes of the
round-top made the best of their way to the deck. As the
vessels closed, the deck became still moreuncomfortable;
and, leaving the American officers to ‘take care of themselves,
they got as far below as theyiecould, and there remained till

the vessel was taken. A pet bear, more courageous than

the savages, was found enjoying itself on deck, lapping up

“ don’t return till you bring metidings of victory.”

Just at the critical moment when the Kentuckians reached
their foes and the battle raged 'most ﬁercely, a bullet, said
to have been ﬁred by Col. Johnson himself, struck Tecum-
seh in the breast. He shouted his last word of command,
stepped forward, and then calmly sunk at the foot of an
oak and expired. A sudden terror seized the Red Men.
The voice of their beloved leader was silent. The Great
Spirit was angry. Ferocity gave way to despair, and the
defeated warriors were soon ﬂying through the wilderness.
Witli the fall of Tecumseh terminated the battle of the
Thames. Michigan was recovered; Upper Canada was
conquered; the honor of American arms was vindicated.

General Harrison, after descending the lakes, proceeded to",

Washington, his countrymen vying with each other in doing
him honor. - 7

492. Tecumseh was the most formidable of all the Indian
warriors that ever fought against the United States. He
was nearly six feet high ; his frame was muscular, and capaa
ble of great endurance. A high forehead, piercing eyes, and
gravity of expression, gave an air of command to his whole
person. Strict morality and adherence to truth from his
earliest years, added to talents of a high order and eloquence
rarely equalled, made him not only a ruling spirit among the
tribes of the wilderness, but also an object of respect to the
nation whom he opposed with undying hatred. , ' »

man would often let his friends select a wife for him. He
or his relations then made presents to the parents of the in-
tended bride, which were accepted if the offer was approved;
otherwise they were returned. In the former case, the pa-
rents dressed their daughter in her best clothes, and con-
ducted her to the bridegroom’s residence. The ceremony
was then complete.

49. Family ReZati0ns.——The Indian wife, or squaw, had
a hard lot. Besides being compelled to do all the drudgery,
she was generally treated by her husband with indifference,
and often with cruelty. For his children, particularly dur-
ing infancy, the warrior entertained a stronger affection.
He could endure pain without a groan; but, when misfor-
tune overtook his oifspring, he gave way to the most violent
grief. The loss of a promising son was regarded as the great-
est possible calamity ; and often, to redeem a child from the
enemy, a father has surrendered himself, and been burned
at the stake in his stead.

50. EcZuccwz'0n.——The education of theyoung Indian con-
sisted chiefly of athletic exercises and such training as would
enable him.to endure hunger and fatigue. At the age of
eight years, he was required from time to time to fast half a
day, and at twelve often passed a whole day without food
or drink, his ‘ face being blackened during the fast. At
eighteen, he underwent his ﬁnal trial. His face was now
blackened for the last time, and he was led far into the
woods, where he was left without food as long as life could
be so supported. His’ guardians then came for him, praised
his endurance, took him home, and after various ceremonies
informed him that he was now a man. No instancehas
ever been known of an Indian boy’s eating or drinking
while undergoing the trial of the blackened face.

493. The efforts made in 1811 by Tecumseh to enlist the
Greeks in a war with the United States, resulted, in the sum-
mer of 1813, in the formation of a hostile league among the
tribes of the region now known as Georgia, Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, and Florida. Such signs of hostility were shown
that the people in southwestern Alabama ﬂocked for safety
to the military posts scattered through the country. In
Fort Mim:rns, which was defended by a body of volunteers,
several hundred had taken refuge. While the gates were
standing. open at noonday, 700 Creeks, under Wethei'foi'd,
stealthily approached, and before the garrison were aware
of their presence made a rush for the fort. An entrance
was effected; the buildings were ﬁred; and between three
and four hundred men,'women, and children were massacred.

lus-hat’-chee was the first village attacked. The Red Men»

resisted, till nearly their whole number were killed or wound-
ed. A severe struggle soon after took place at Tal-la-de’-ga,
where a thousand Greeks were besieging some friendly In-
dians. Forced marches brought Jackson, with 1200 men,
within 80 yards of their camp. The Creeks, taken at disad-
vantage, tried to ﬂy, but found themselves nearly surround-
ed. Between two and three hundred were killed, with tri-
ﬂing loss on the part of the Americans; the rest made good
their escape to the mountains.

The invading army now began to suifer from hunger.

.Supplies failed to arrive, and no food could be procured in

the wilderness. A famishing soldier approached his general,
and asked for something to eat. “ I will divide with‘_you,”
said Jackson, and drew from his pocket a handful of acorns.
“Then it was seen that their officers fared no better than
themselves, the troops bore their hardships with all possible
patience. But at last extreme suffering led them to open
mutiny,‘ and in deﬁance of orders they prepared to march
to their homes. Then was exhibited the iron will of Gen.
Jackson. He took post on horseback before the rebellious
army, which had already begun to move. His left arm,
shortly before shattered by a ball, was still disabled, but his
right grasped a musket, which he rested on his horse’s neck,
declaring that he would shoot down the ﬁrst who advanced.
The brave men, who had not feared a thousand Creeks, were
awed by the determined front of their intrepid commander.
No one offered to advance, and after a short consultation
they agreed to postpone their departure. _

of the month, Gen. Floyd, advancing from the east with his
Georgia division, reached that part of the enemy’s country
called “the Beloved Ground”. Here the Indians rallied,
inspired by their prophet with the belief that on “the Be-
loved Ground” no foe could injure them. After obstinately
maintaining the conflict for three hours, they gave way,
leaving two of their principal chiefs and nearly 200 men
upon the ﬁeld. ,

Jackson was for a time prevented from active operations
by the return of most of his companies, who claimed that
their time of enlistment had expired; but by vigorous efforts
he was reinforced in time to recommence the campaign With
the opening of spring [1814]. A thousand warriors, with
their Women and children, had congregated at the Horse-
shoe Bend of the Tallapoosa, where they were nearly encir-
cled by the river, the narrow isthmus in front being defended
by a breastwork of logs; and on the 27th of March, the
American army appeared before their encampment. A strong
detachment was stationed around the Bend to prevent the
escape of the Indians, while a heavy cannonade was com-
menced in front. The order to storm was soon given. The
log defences were scattered, and the encampment became a
scene of terrible carnage. Hemmed in on all sides and dis-
daining to surrender, the doomed Creeks fought with the
energy of despair. Not till 557 of their number, including
many noted chiefs, and Man-a-hoe’, their great prophet, were
stretched in death upon the ﬁeld, did the battle cease. Be-
sides a few friendly Indians,” Jackson lost 26 men killed and
106 wounded. This decisive victory ended the Creek War.
The power of the Muscogees was broken. A peace was soon
after concluded with their few surviving chiefs, on terms
dictated by the United States.

495. The reverses already experienced did not deter the
Americans from again attempting the invasion of Canada.
In the fall of 1813, Gen.Will:inson, who had succeeded Dear-
born in the chief command, undertook an expedition against
Montreal, in conjunction with Gen. Hampton, who was to

advance with the army of the north from Plattsburg. Hamp- ,

ton’s men penetrated into the enemy’s country; and Will{in-
son’s division descended the St. Lawrence some distance,
under cover of a detachment which bravely met the enemy
at Chrysler’s Field; but mutual jealousy, difficulties of trans-
portation, and the lateness of the season, ﬁnally led to the
abandonment of the enterprise. The force left meanwhile
on the Niagara frontier was so inadequate to its defence that
it was deemed prudent to evacuate Fort George [Dec. 12].
Before this was done, the ,town of Newark was reduced to
ashes ; an act which the British soon after retaliated by
burning Youngstown, Lewiston, Black Rock, and Buffalo.
In March, 1814,Wilkinson attempted a second invasion with
4,000 men; but he was repulsed at the first point which he
attacked, and obliged hastily to retreat. Though acquitted
by a court-martial, he was shortly afterwards superseded by
Gen. Iz’ard.

sent over 14,000 veterans, to aid in the defence of Canada.
497. The naval operations of the United States during
1814 were neither so extensive nor so successful as in the
two previous years. In consequence of the close blockade
of the coast by British cruisers, it was diﬂicult for American
vessels to leave port or bring in theirprizes. The Essex, in

even Porter’s skill and bravery Were unavailing; and, after
a gallant ﬁght and a vain "attempt to run his vessel ashore,
he had to surrender. “ We have been unfortunate, but not

V 498. On the 3d of J uly, 1814, Gen. Brown, Who had march-
ed from Sackett’s Harbo1',.crossed the Niagara River With
3,500 men. Fort Erie surrendered, and the Americans moved
on to Chippewa [see Map, p. 351]. Here the main body of
the enemy Was posted, and a general action‘ commenced.
Both parties displayed great gallantry; but the unerring
ﬁre of Gen. Scott’s and Major J essup’s men drove the vet
erans Whom Wellington had often led to victory, behind
their Works, and the Whole force of the enemy fell back on
Fort George, abandoning their intermediate posts. General
Brown, after pursuing them as far as Queenstown Heights,
encamped at Chippewa. The American loss in this battle
Was about 300 ; that of the British Was nearly tWice as great.

499. On the 25th of July, Scott’s brigade Was detailed to
Watch the movements of a division of the enemy. On ap-
proaching r the Falls of Niagara, the Americans suddenly
found themselves in the presence of the Whole British army,
which Was advantageously posted for a pitched battle. Has-
tily sending Word to Gen. Brown, Scott soon had his artillery
at Work, and maintained his ground in the most heroic man-
ner. He Was ably seconded by J essup, Who, by a’ masterly
movement, gained the British rear, and made prisoners of
Gen. Riall and his suite. Soon after dark, Ripley’s brigade.
arrived on the ﬁeld, affording timely relief to Sc0tt’s exhaust-
ed troops. A tremendous ﬁre Was still kept up by the ene-
my from a commanding height defended by a battery. Un-
less this height was carried, Gen. ‘Ripley could see no chance
of victory. The effort Was almost hopeless, but he resolved
that it should be made. Col. Miller Was selected to lead the
desperate charge. ‘ “ Can you take that battery ?” asked the

commander. “ I Will try, sir,” Was the reply. Steadily up .

A hot ﬁre was poured upon them; but they closed their
ranks, and gallantly moved on. In a few moments the bat-
tery wasin their hands, and the retreating enemy were ﬁred
upon with their own guns. Three times the British rallied
for their recapture, and three times were they repulsed. At
midnight they gave up their efforts, and left the Americans
in possession of the ﬁeld. This battle of Lundy’s Lane, or
Bridgewater, was one of the most hotly contested actions
ever fought in the new world. Three thousand Americans,
and 4,500 British took part in it. The former lost 743 in
killed and wounded ; the latter, 87 8.

Fort Erie, Where in a few days they were besieged by the
British army, now reinforced to 4,000 men. A heavy bom-

Prevost, taking advantage of the absence of Gen. Izard and
his army, who had moved towards Sackett’s Harbor, crossed
the northern boundary of the state of New York, with the
view of penetrating to the Hudson by way of Lake Cham-
plain. Gen. Macomb [ma-lc00m’], who was in command at
Plattsburg, hastily collected the militia of the vicinity, en-
rolling even boys Who were large enough to handle a musket.
He was too weak, however, to prevent the advance of the
enemy; and, as they approached, he crossed the Sar’-a-nac,
taking up the planks of the bridges behind him. Prevost
entered Plattsburg on the 10th, and there waited to be
joined by a naval force under Commodore Down’-ie, consist-
ing of 17 vessels carrying 95 guns, which was advancing into
the lake by the So-rel’ River.

with spectators, who awaited with palpitating hearts the
issue of the engagement. McDonough, who had drawn up
his little ﬂeet in a favorable position across the mouth of the
harbor and had publiclyasked the blessing of God on his
efforts in defence of his country, opened a ﬁre as the enemy
approached. The British had heavier cannon than the
Americans; but their gunners, though taken in part from
men-of-war at Quebec, were neither as quick in their move-
ments nor as accurate in theireaim as McDonough’s. The
hottest ﬁre was maintained between the vessels which bore
thetwo commanders; and the American ﬂag-ship, the Sara-
toga, was at length completely disabled on the side presented
to the enemy. McDonough then had recourse to the inge-
nious expedient of wearing his vessel round, to bring’ the
other side into play. The enemy, who had also suffered se-
verely, attempted the same movement, but without success;
and within two hours and a half after the action commenced,
the Whole British ﬂeet struck. The American loss was 158
in killed and Wounded; that of the British, about 200, inclu-
ding Downie himselﬂ '

During the battle on the lake, Prevost’s army attempted
to cross the Saranac at several diﬂerent points, but Were re-
pulsed by the Americans. On the surrender of the ﬂeet,
they gave up all further efforts. Prevost _was seized with
terror; and that same night, in the midst of a heavy rain,
he made a hasty retreat, leaving his sick and Wounded behind
him, together with large quantities of military stores. Many
of his troops deserted. One company of 400 men marched
to the American camp, preceded by a band of music. It is
computed that the loss of the enemy in this expedition was
not far short. of 3,000 men.

36 DESCRIPTION OF THE INDIANS.

Volved on the old, who had themselves received their knowl-
edge from chiefs that had preceded them. A venerable
Warrior once said that his father had labored day and night
to teach him the laws, ceremonies, and history of his nation,
“ that he might one day beneﬁt his people by his counsel”.
The necessity of fortitude and self-restraint was also im-
pressed upon the mind from an early period. ;_ _

51. Wars.-—Indian wars usually consisted of expeditions
carried on by small parties, Whose object was to surprise the
enemy, to kill as. many as possible, and to return home in
safety with the scalps of their victims. To be complete in
their eyes, a victory had to be obtained by stratagem, and
without any loss of their own number. There was little glory
in gaining a battle by open force; and to fall on the ﬁeld,
instead of being thought honorable, was rather regarded as
a proof of rashness or unskilfulness. In large bodies, from a
Want of discipline, they could not act with much success.

Their armies were not encumbered with baggage or mili-
tary stores, but depended, for the small amount of food they
needed, on the game they might meet with in the forest. To
provide against emergencies, however, each warrior carried
a bag of pounded maize; and, this with his arms being his
only burden, he marched with great rapidity. On a warlike
expedition, the chief led the way, and each of his followers
trod noiselessly in his tracks, leaving as small a trail as pos«
sible. Wheii there was danger of pursuit, the last warrior
concealed the footsteps of the party by covering them with
leaves and branches. The senses of the Indian were wonder-
fully acute, and“ great ingenuity was often shown in discov-
ering the trail of a cunning enemy who had left little or no
clue to his course.

Consternation seized on the inhabitants; and the enemy,
cautiously advancing, found the whole line of their route
deserted. The first resistance they encountered "was [Au-
gust 24] at Bla’-dens-burg, six miles northeast of Washing-
ton, Where their passage was disputed by an American army
consisting mostly of militia hastily collected. The British
soldiers were almost overcome by the intense‘ heat; they
charged with vigor, however, and at the ﬁrst onset the
American militia gave way in disorder, some without even
discharging their muskets. Commodore Barney, with his
eighteen-pounders, and Captain Miller’s guns, double-loaded
with canister, checked the enemy for a time; but their men,
exposed on the ﬂank by the ﬂight of the militia, were driven
back, and both of these brave oﬂﬁcers fell into the hands of
the enemy. The routed army carried terror with it to the
capital. The city at this time contained 10,000 inhabitants,
most of whom, including the president and his. cabinet, has?
tily retired. " 0 t ‘-

503. On the evening after the battle, Gen. Ross entered
Washiiigton. By the order of his government, he set ﬁre
to the capitol, the president’s house, and other public build-
ings. Private property also suﬂered to a considerable ex-
tent. Gn the evening of the 25th the British left the city,
and two days afterwards they reached their shipping in
safety. Meanwhile the division of their ﬂeet which had as»
cended the Potomac passed Fort Washington,’ which was
abandoned by its garrison and blown up, and appeared be:
fore Alexandria. To escape bombardment, the people of
this place surrendered to the enemy 21 merchant-vessels,
16,000 barrels of ﬂour, 1,000 hogsheads of tobacco, and other
articles.

ican people, and brought down heavy censure on the admin-'
istration. Qien. Armstrong, the secretary of war, indignant
at the charges of ineﬁiciency .brought against him, resigned ;
andthe duties of his ofﬁce Were assumed by Monroe, the
secretary of state. Great alarm prevailed in the seaboard
cities. The militia were organized; and defensive works
were thrown up, on which ‘citizens of all ranks, now for the
ﬁI'Sl) time laying party-spirit aside, labored with their own
hands. At New York, $500,000;was needed to put the city
in a state of defence. The_money could not be procured on
the public credit; and Gov. Tompkins was called upon by
Senator King to raise it on his -personal responsibility. The
governor hesitated, on the ground that it might ruin him.
“ Then,” said Mr. King, “ruin yourself, if it becomes neces-
sary, to save the country, and I pledge my honor that I will
support you in whatever you do.” Through the eiforts of
these two patriotic men, the necessary sum was obtained,
and the city was made ready to receive the enemy. . . .

505. Encouraged by his success at Washington, Ross next
proceeded against Baltimore, where a body of 10,000 militia-
men had assembled. Gen. Smith,noted for his brave defence
of Fort Mifﬂin in the Revolution, held the chief command,
On the 12th .of September, the British troops landed at
North Point, 14 miles from the city, while part of the ﬂeet
moved up the bay, to attack Fort McHenry, which coma
manded the channel. Soon after commencing their march
towards Baltimore, they encountered some American sharp»
shooters, and Gen. Ross with several ofﬁcers rode in front of
his line to reconnoitre. Two mechanics of the city, belong-
ing to one of the militia companies, immediately discharged
their muskets at the party. Ross fell mortally wounded into
the arms of an aid-de-camp; and his horse, galloping wildly
to the rear with his empty saddle wet with blood, told the

melancholy story to hismen. The two brave Americans fell
amid a shower of balls.

Ross’s fall did not put a stop to the attack. a The British
continued to advance, but, on coming Within reach of the
Arnerican artillery, Were met with a destructive ﬁre. After
maintaining their advanced position for more than an hour,
the Americans fell back to high grounds in their rear, and
there -prepared for another encounter. ,The next day, the
British again approached : but the resolute front of the
Americans, added to the intelligence that their ﬂeet could
make no impression on Fort McHenry, deterred them from
further attempts on the city; and, taking advantage of the
darkness of a stormy night, they retreated to their boats.
During a bombardment of twenty-ﬁve hours, 1,500 shells had
exploded around the fort, but only four of its defenders Were
killed. In the midst of the ﬁre, the national’ song entitled
“The Star-spangled Banner” Was composed by Francis Keys,
an American Who Was detained on board of one of the British
ships. The people of Baltimore have since raised a marble
monument to the memory of those who fell in their defence,
which, with another erected in honor of Washington, has
procured for that place the name of “ the Monumental City”.

506. The people of New England, most of Whom had op"-
posed the War in consequence of its injurious effects on their
commerce, in the summer of 1814 proposed holding a con—
vention, to discuss the subj ect and agree upon such a course
as their interests required; The bombardment. of Stoning-
ton, Connecticut, by a British ﬂeet [August, 1814], and the
danger of other places on the coast, 1 gave Weight to the sug-

507. An invasion of the Southwest formed a prominent
part of the plan which the British had marked out for their
campaign. Jackson, who had been appointed to the com-
mand in that quarter with the rank of major-general, heard
towards the close of the summer that several British vessels
had arrived at Pensacola, that the troops they conveyed had
been allowed to land there by the Spanish authorities, and
that the Oreeks had been invited to join in an attack on the
American posts in the vicinity. Hastening to Mobile, he
found these statements true. On the 15th‘of September, an
attack was made by a party of British andlndians from
Pensacola on Fort Bowyer [b0'-3/er], which commanded the
approaches to Mobile. With the loss of only eight men,
Major Lawrence repulsed the enemy, destroying one of their
ships and disabling 234 men. Jackson now felt justiﬁed in
assuming the offensive. Reinforced by some mounted Ten-
nesseeans, he marched into Florida and took Pensacola, the
British blowing up the fort which they had occupied, and
retreating to their vessels. Having thus accomplished the

‘object of his enterprise, Jackson forthwith proceeded to New

Orleans, now threatened by a formidable armament of the
enemy. .,

On arriving at New Orleans [December 2nd], Jackson
-found the people in great alarm. Some, believing it impos-
sible to make good a defence, were even in favor of surren-
dering. After J ackson-’s appearance, however, no such idea
was entertained. He assumed the entire control of public

time 47 years of age, and is described as “ a tall gaunt man,
of very erect carriage, with a countenance full of stern de-
cision and fearless energy, but furrowed with care and anxi-
ety. His complexion was sallow, and unhealthy; his hair
was iron-gray, and his body thin and emaciated. But the
ﬁerce glare of his bright hawk-like gray eye betrayed a soul
which triumphed over the inﬁrmities of the body.” He

508. Information respecting the designs of the British, had
been obtained, among other sources, from Laﬁtte [la/z_-ﬁt’],
the chief of several hundred adventurers, charged with be-
ing pirates and smugglers, who occupied the Bay of Bar-a-
ta’-ri-a, an, inlet from the Gulf of Mexico just west of the
Mississippi. Plundering Spanish merchant-vessels, through
the connivance or indifference of the authorities of New
Orleans they sold in that port the products of their bucca-
neering voyages. Early in September, the British com-
mander at Pensacola, with the View of securing the aid of
this company, had oifered to receive them into his country’s
service, and unfolded to their leader the details of the in-
tended attack. The latter sumptuously entertained the Brit-
ish messenger at his luxurious home on one of the islands in
the bay, but declined his offers. Though an adventurer,

-Laﬁtte was no traitor. He had lived among the citizens of

New Orleans; and he resolved not to desert them in the
hour of need. Laying before the authorities the information

he had received, he offered, on condition of pardon for past

offences, to leadhis men to the defence of the city. After
the invasion of his stronghold and the seizure of papers

-which conﬁrmed his statements, his proposal was accepted,

and the Baratarians did good service in the hard-fought bat
tles that followed.

509. On the 24th of November, the army destined for the
invasion of Louisiana was reviewed at Jamaica. It consist-

ed of the force that had been serving in the Chesapeake, and

strong reinforcements from Europe, making in all 50 vessels,
carrying 1,000 guns, and, including some subsequent addi-»
tions, 12,000 troops, the ﬂower of the British army. The
chief command was intrusted to Sir Edward Packenham, a
brother-in-law of the Duke of Wellington, and next to him
the most distinguished of English military leaders. The in»
vaders had no doubt of their success. They had already
organized a government for Louisiana, and carried with them
a printing-press to announce the proclamations of the new
authorities. Boldly entering Lake Borgne [born], the ene-
my, on the 14_:th of December, captured a ﬂotilla of gun»
boats, which had been stationed there for the defence of the

city. A_n-unfrequented bayou, the guards of which, With a

single exception, were captured, brought them to within a
few miles of the Mississippi, and on the 22nd, their advanced
guard reached the bank of that river nine miles from New
Orleans. /7 i
510. Within a few hours after Jackson received this in»
telligence, he had 2,000 men in motion. Many of them
were from Tennessee, unerring marksmen, arrayed in home»
spun, with slouched hats of wool or fur, and tomahawks in
their deerskin belts. Shortly after dark [December 23rd],
the Carolina, a schooner of 14 guns, dropped down the river,
and opened a destructive ﬁre on the British camp. W Generals
Jackson and Coffee followed up the attack in front. The
darkness rendered it almost impossible to distinguish friend
from foe, but both parties fought with the greatest bravery.
At length, Jackson, ﬁnding himself unable to drive the en-
emy from their position, withdrew his men, having lost 213,
to over 300 killed and wounded on the part of the enemy.

left, he threw up strong intrenchments, sent for the rest of
his men from New Orleans, and ordered a detachment across
the Mississippi, to prevent the enemy from reaching the city
in that direction.

Packenham having joined the army, and his preparations
being completed, the invaders, on the 28th of December,
made a vigorous attack on the American lines, but were re-
pulsed With a loss of nearly 200 men. A supply of heavy
cannon was sent for from the ﬂeet; and on the 1st of Janu-
ary, 1815, having the night before planted batteries within
400 yards of the American works, they opened a tremen-
dous cannonade. A thick fog concealed their movements,
till a terriﬁc crash of balls from thirty guns of heavy calibre,
together with hissing shells and glaring rockets, announced

an account of Gen. Jackson’s attack. What was the result? What position did Jack-
son take the next day? [See Map.——What was on J ackson’s left? Who commanded

that a severe struggle was at hand. The Americans had
only ten cannon; but these were handled With such spirit
that they were more than a match for those of the enemy.
Both parties had made a mistake in constructing their works.
The British had used hogsheads full of sugar, supposing that
they would act like sand-bags; but the well-aimed balls of
the Americans shattered them to fragments, and spread de-
struction around and behind. Jackson, in his breastwork,
had used cotton bales, which seemed to answer the purpose,
till a red-hot shot from the British set one of them on ﬁre
and scattered its blazing fragments among the barrels of pow-
der which stood ready for use. The ﬂames were extin-
guished Without accident; but the cotton bales were taken
out, and a breastwork of earth about ﬁve feet high, with
trusty riﬂes behind it, was the only defence employed in the
conﬂicts that followed. The British, after a loss of 70 men
to 34 on the part of the Americans, drew off their guns and
fell back.

511. Preparations were now made on both sides for a de-
cisive battle. Gen. Lambert brought up a fresh division of
British troops, which increased their number to 10,000;
while Jackson, also reinforced, found himself in command of
6,000 men, 3,200 of whom defended the breastwork. Before
daylight on the 8th of January, a detachment was sent
against the Americans on the right bank of the Mississippi,
while the main body, led by Packenham in person, advanced
to storm J ackson’s position. As soon as they came within
reach of the American cannon, a terrible ﬁre thinned their
ranks, but still they moved on in good order. “Stand to
your guns,” shouted Jackson, as they approached; “don’t
waste your ammunition, see that every shot tells.” In an-
other moment, the order to ﬁre was given. Under the
murderous discharge that followed, the advancing column
wavered. A fresh regiment, with Packenham at its head,

riﬂes no foe could stand. Packenham had his right arm
shattered, and his horse killed under him; his broken ranks
retired in confusion.

Though nearly every officer was disabled, the troops still
pressed on. A few crossed the canal and ascended the par-
apet, but fell before its vigilant defenders, most of them
to rise no more. Gen. Lambert, Who succeeded to the
command, ﬁnding his army hopelessly defeated with the loss
of more than 2,000 men, hastened to retreat. He recalled
the detachment on the opposite side of the Mississippi,
which had driven back the Americans, and gained a position
that would have been of great service in dislodging Jackson.-
The whole enterprise was abandoned, and the invading host
returned to their shipping by a road which they out along
the Bayou to Lake Borgne. On both sides of the river, the
American loss was but 27 in killed and wounded. On the
20th of ‘January, Jackson returned to New Orleans in tri-
umph‘,.where he was received with every possible demon-
stration of joy and gratitude.

are mentioned, the intrepid conduct of a young British bu-
gler should not be forgotten. The enemy’s left, at the com-
mencement of the engagement, advanced along the river,
captured a redoubt, and moved steadily on towards the
canal. Their bugler, a boy of only fourteen years, preceding
the line to within 200 yards of the breastwork, climbed a
tree and sounded “the charge” while his comrades stormed
the intrenchments. _ A sheet of ﬂame drove back the assail-
ants. Men were mowed down; bullets and cannon-balls
rained around, tearing off the branches of the very tree on
which the ‘young musician was seated; yet, paying no at-
tention to the messengers of death, he continued to cheer on
his countrymen with his wild music as calmly as if he were
in camp. After they had retreated, an American soldier
came forth from the lines and captured the boy, whose in-
trepidity had attracted general attention. Officers and men
crowded around him to express their hearty admiration.

gium, between John Quincy Adams [son of John Adams],
Bayard, Russell, Clay, and Grallatin, on the part of the Uni-
ted States, and commissioners appointed by Great Britain;
but the latter were so extravagant in their demands that for
some time little progress Was made. News of the defeats at
Plattsburg and Baltimore at length altered their tone; and
on the 24th of December a satisfactory treaty of peace was
signed. It said nothing about the aggressions on American
commerce and impressment of sailors on the high seas, which
had caused the war; but it was tacitly understood that there
would be no further diﬂiculty on these points. The news
reached America on the 11th of February, 1815; had it come
a little sooner, it would have saved the British the disastrous
repulse at New Orleans. On the day the intelligence ar-
rived at Washiiigton, Madison and his cabinet had separated
in great despondency, unable to devise any effective meas-
ures for the relief of their country,———no money in the treas-
ury, a debt of $100,000,000, commerce destroyed, all kinds
of industry depressed. Late at night a horseman Was heard
galloping through the streets of Washington, and the joy-
ful cry of “Peace! peace!” resounded on all sides. The
treaty had been brought by a British vessel to New York,
and the joyful news was soon circulated throughout the
country. It was everywhere hailed with delight. Bells were
rung, ﬂags were hoisted, schools had holiday, and towns
were illuminated. On the 18th of February, the treaty was
ratiﬁed by the U. S. senate, and peace was proclaimed.

tional bank with $80,000,000 capital. This was vetoed by the
president; but at the next session of Congress an institution
was chartered with a capital of $35,000,000. It commenced
operations at Philadelphia, on the 4th of March, 1817, and
with its branches in other cities supplied the country with a
uniform currency, redeemable at all times with gold and silver.

515. In May, 1815, Decatur was sent with a squadron to
punish the Algerines, who had taken advantage of the War
with England to renew their depredations on American com-
merce. On the 17th of June, he encountered, in the Medi-
terranean, the largest vessel in the Algerine navy, and cap-
tured her after a running ﬁght of 25 minutes. He soon
after appeared before Algiers, when the dey at once agreed
to liberate the American prisoners in his hands, to make full
indemniﬁcation for the losses he had occasioned, and to re.»
linquish all claims to tribute for the future. Decatur next
proceeded to Tunis and Tripoli, where he obtained similar
concessions and exacted pay for American vessels which the
English had been allowed to take in their harbors. Since
pursuing this decided course, the United States have had no
difficulty with the pirates of Barbary.

516. Nothing remains to be noticed in Madison’s eventful
administration, except the admission of Indiana as a member
of the confederacy in December, 1816, and the formation of
the Colonization Society about the same time. The object
of this association, which embraced among its members
many distinguished statesmen, was to provide a happy home
for free persons of color, where they could enjoy the right
of self-government. A favorable position was ﬁnally select-=
ed on the coast of Africa. The name of Liberia was given
to the colony, and its capital was called Monrovia, after
President Monroe. To this place many emigrants have from

CHAPTER VIII.

MONROE’S ADMINISTRATION, 1817 TO 1825.

517. ON the 4th of March, 1817, James Monroe became
president of the United States, and Daniel D. Tompkins, of
New York, vice-president. Born in Virginia in 1759, Mon-
roe served in the Revolutionary War‘, and after its termina-
tion was successively a member of both houses of Congress,
governor of Virginia, and minister to France and England.
The new president followed the same general policy as his
predecessor. He called John Quincy Adams from the Brit-
ish court, where he had resided as minister since the war, to
become his secretary of state, and Win. H. Crawford, of
Georgia, was placed at the head of the treasury department.
In December, 1817, John C. Calhoun, of South Carolina, was

appointed secretary of war, and Williani ‘Wirt, of Maryland,

attorney-general. Early in his term, Monroe made a tour
through New England and the northwest, and was well re-
ceived by the people. The violence of party-spirit had now
subsided, and the federalists no longer opposed the measures
of the administration. A plan was devised in Congress for
paying the public debt, which in a few years accomplished
that important object. Towards the close of 1817, the atten-
tion of government was called to Amelia Island, on the Flor-
ida coast, a rendezvous for buccaneers, who, pretending to
sail under the ﬂag of the South American republics, made
free with whatever they found on the ocean. In November,
a body of U. S. troops took possession of their haunts; and
soon after a similar establishment on Galveston Island, Texas,
was also broken up.

518. The public mind began about this time to realize the
necessity of internal improvements. It was obvious that

roads and canals, connecting distant portions of the Union,
and bringing its remoter parts within reach of a market,
would greatly augment the wealth: and strength of the coun—
try. To the importance of these, works Monroe was fully
alive ; but, like Jefferson and Madison, he believed that the
constitution gave the general government no authority to
engage in them, Congress after some discussion agreed
with him, but made appropriations 8-for a great national road
across the Alleghanies, from Cumberland to Wlieeling, this
having been promised by the‘United States at the time that
Ohio came into the Union. Several military roads Were also
opened. 1 ‘

This constitutional diﬂiculty, however, did not apply to the
individual states, which vigorously undertook the work of
improvement. Surveys were made, roads were constructed
in all directions, and facilities for travel and transportation
were increased. In carrying on these enterprises, New York
was among the foremost. Under the auspices of De Witt

, Clintonland other public-spirited men, a bill was passed by

the legislature of that state authorizing the construction of a
canal, 863imiles long, to connect Lake Erie, at Buffalo, with
the Hudson, at Albany. The workwas commenced in July,
1817, and was not completed till the summer of 1825. The
Erie Canal was 40 feet wide, contained 83 locks built’ of solid
masonry, to raise or lower the boats as required by the face
of the country, crossed the Genesee once and the Mohawk
twice by means of aqueducts, and originally cost $7,602,000.
About the same time, a canal, connecting Lake Champlain
with the Hudson, was ﬁnished; andin November, 1825, the
completion of these works was celebrated by the ﬁring of
cannon and public rejoicings. They. gave an impetus to
trade which was felt throughout the whole northern and

519. In the summer of 1817, the Seminoles, a powerful
tribe living within the Spanish territory on the borders of
Georgia and Alabama, joined by some runaway negroes and
refugee Creeks, commenced a series of depredations on the
frontier settlements. Gen. Gaines, who commanded a post
on the Flint River, destroyed several of their villages; but
he encountered so ﬁerce a resistance that Jackson was or-
dered into service, with volunteers from Tennessee, who
were always ready to follow this favorite leader. In March,
1818, having spent several ‘months in organizing his forces
and securing provisions, Jackson took the ﬁeld with his
brave Tennesseeans, some friendly Greeks, and the regulars
already at the seat of war. He burned a number of Semi-
nole towns, drove the enemy before him, and seized on their
corn and cattle. It was obvious to Jackson that the Indians
had been instigated by the Spaniards of Florida, and two
British subjects who had supplied them with arms and am-
munition. The former he punished by seizing their forts at
St. Marks and Pensacola, and sending the oﬂicers in com-
mand to Havana. The latter were tried by a court-martial,
found guilty, and executed. Two refugee Creek chiefs and
a pretended prophet, who had helped to stir up the war,
were also-taken and hanged. Though the American army
was unable to penetrate to themore southerly villages, hos-
tilities were for a time suppressed.

The course of Gen. Jackson in invading the territory of a
nation with which the United States was at peace, was con-
demned by some, and at ﬁrst even the cabinet were disposed
to pronounce it arbitrary and unauthorized. The secretary
of state, however, convinced them that Jackson had done
no more than was necessary to carry out the orders of gov-
ernment. A committee of Congress, which investigated the
transactions in question, absolved the hero of New Orleans
from all blame. The British government, on hearing of the

summary execution of two of their subjects, were at ﬁrst
loud in their demands for satisfaction; but Mr. Adams’ argu-
ments convinced them also of the propriety of what had
been done. On the close of the Oongressional investigation,
Jackson visited the principal cities of the Union, and was
received with an enthusiasm which showed that the people
heartily approved of his conduct.

520. Two important treaties were made in the early part
of Monroe’s administration: one with England (Oct. 1818),
which settled part of the boundary between the British Pos-
sessions and the U. S., and secured to the citizens of the latter
the privilege of taking ﬁsh on the coast of Newfoundland;
the other with Spain (February 22, 1819), which disposed
of still more important questions. Difficulties had been an-
ticipated in this quarter, in consequence of the seizure of the
posts in Florida; but, through the skilful management of the
secretary of state, not only was good feeling restored, but the
Spanish government was induced to cede East and West
Florida to the U. S., the latter, on its part, relinquishing all
claim to Texas and agreeing to meet the demands of Amer-
ican citizens on Spain, for commercial depredations, to the
amount of $5,000,000. This treaty was considered highly
advantageous and unanimously ratiﬁed by the senate. F

521. During Monroe’s administration, five new states were
admitted into the Union: Mississippi, in 1817 ; Illinois, which
since the war had become rapidly settled, in 1818; Alabama,
originally embraced in Mississippi Territory, in 1819; Maine,
before included in the commonwealth of Massachusetts, in
1820 3’ and Missouri, part of the territory of Lousiana pur-
chased from Napoleon, in 1821. The admission of Missouri
was preceded by violent debates‘ in Congress, which agitated

very within its limits as a condition of entrance into the con-
federacy; while others maintained that it was the right of
every state to “determine for itself, on coming into the Union,
Whether it would be slave or free. A bill, known as the _7l1z's-
scum’ Compromise, was at length introduced by Mr. Clay, to
the effect that slavery should be allowed in Missouri, and all
states that might be formed south-of latitude 36 degrees 30
minutes, which parallel forms its southern boundary,——but
should be forbidden in the territory north of this line and
west of Missouri. This compromise was generally acceptable;
it was passed by Congress, and remained in force till 1856.

522. At the commencement of Monroe’s term, the country
had just begun to rally from the depression occasioned by
the war; and, during the three years that followed, it en-
joyed uninterrupted prosperity. As a natural consequence,
the president stood high in the affections of the people. His
popularity was increased by his endeavors to harmonize op-
posing parties, as well as by his urgent recommendation,
promptly acted on by Congress, that provision should be
made for the surviving patriots who had served in the Revo-
lutionary Wa1'. He was accordingly reelected almost unan-
imously, and commenced his second term on the 5th of
March, 1821. The seventeenth Congress, which assembled
in the following December, contained several new members
who afterwards became distinguished; among these were
Martin Van Buren, of New York, and Thomas H. Benton,
of Missouri. Florida was organized as a territory, and An?
drew Jackson was appointed its first governor.

523. The South American provinces, which from the time
of Pizarro had remained subject to the Spanish crown, early
in the present century followed the example of the North

American colonies, asserting their independence and ﬁnally
establishing it by force of arms. While the struggle was

pending, Clay, Who sympathized deeply with the oppressed
provinces, strove With his transcendent eloquence to induce
Congress to recognize their independence. His efforts at
first failed, as Congress distrusted their success; but his
speeches Were read at the head of the patriotiarmies, and
encouraged them to persevere in their struggle for liberty.
At length, in March, 1822, the bill -Was passed With but one
dissenting voice. The president heartily joined in the rec-
ognition of their independence, and the following year Went
so far as to declare in his message that ‘ the American con-
tinents Were thenceforth not to be considered as subjects for
future colonization by any European poWer’._ This is the
famous Monroe doctrine, which has since been advocated by
many of our countrymen. 1

524. About the year 1820, American commerce suffered
much from pirates, who infested the southern Waters and
made their haunts on the coast of Cuba. As the Spanish
authorities made no effort to disperse them, the U. S. gov-
ernment took the matter in hand. The frigate Congress and
eight smaller vessels Were stationed about Florida, and in
the course of 1822 about 20 piratical vessels were captured
and destroyed. The Peacock and some more small vessels
were dispatched to the scene of action in December, 1822,
the Whole being placed under the command of Commodore
Porter. With his usual energy, Porterscoured the infested
Waters, till he assured himself that not a single piratical craft
Was left aﬂoat. A

and prosperity of a country which he had left struggling for
its very existence. The battle-ﬁelds hallowed by patriot-
blood were to him objects of peculiar interest; and on Bun-
ker Hill, just ﬁfty years after the conﬂict that made it memo-

rable, he laid the corner-stone of the monument which still

rears its head to mark that glorious spot. Everywhere the
illustrious visitor received the homage of a grateful nation.
Congress voted him $200,000 and a township of land in
Florida, in token that his services were not forgotten.

After spending several weeks with President Adams, La
Fayette, in September, 1825, bade a mournful adieu to the
nation, and set sail in the frigate Brandywine, which had
been so named in honor of his ﬁrst battle for freedom and
Was now placed at his disposal to convey him to France.
Before leaving, he paid a parting visit to Mount Vernon, and

526. The close of Monroe’s second term found the country
still more prosperous than its commencement. Military and
naval defences had been constructed; the rights and charac-
ter of the nation had been sustained abroad; the dominion
of the U. S. had extended on the south and west; civilization
had spread. among the Indians, and $60,000,000 of the na-A
tional debt ‘had been paid. It now became necessaryto
choose a successor to the presidency. Four candidates ap-
peared in the ﬁeld: Gen. Jackson, of Tenn.; John Quincy

Adams, of Mass; William H. Crawford, of Ga; and Henry .

Clay, of Kentucky. The ﬁrst received 99 electoral votes;
but, this not being a majority, the choice devolved on the
house of representatives. This body conferred the presi-
dency on Mr. Adams, who was inaugurated March 4th, 1825.
John C. Calhoun, of S. C., had been chosen vice-president by
the electoral college.

JOHN QUINCY ADAMS’ ADMINISTRATION, 1825-9.

527. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS was born at Braintree, Mass.,
on ‘the 11th of July, 1767. pAt the age of nine, he heard
the Declaration of Independence read from, the state-house
in Boston. Two years afterwards he started for the old
world with his father, John Adams, whose patriotic career
we have already traced. Accompanying his father to France
and Holland, thence traversing the continent to St. Peters-

tives Whom he had slain. He reminded his persecutors oi
the terrible vengeance his people would inﬂict. He excited
their fury by calling them cowards and Women, and even
derided them for their "ignorance of the art of torturing,
telling how on such occasions he had made the ﬂesh of their
kinsmen quiver at the stake, At last his taunts provoked
some furious enemy to inﬂict the death-bloW, or ‘else the
ﬂames did their Work and the unsubdued spirit of the Warrior
Was free forever.

53. G0vemmen25.—The Indians Were divided into diﬁ"erent
tribes, each of Which had its sa’-chem, or chief, though in
most cases his power Was little more than nominal. Whe11-
ever a chief obtained ahigh degree of authority, it Was be-
cause he excelled in eloquence, cunning, or bravery. When
a tribe Was called into the ﬁeld, it Was of course necessary
that there should be some ‘leader; but both on the march
and in the engagementmuch more freedom Wasallowed to
individuals than among civilized nations. There Were no
laws, and in time of peace the chief exercised little or no au-
thority. If a Wrong Was committed, its punishment Was left
to those Who suifered it. To settle important matters, coun-
cils Were held, at Which all Who had killed an enemy in War
Were present. After smoking round the council-ﬁre a long
time in silence, the chief or the oldest Warrior present deliv-
ered his opinion, and then the other old men in succession.
Perfect order reigned in these assemblies, and every speaker
Was listened to in silence. The chief, being generally the
Inost sagacious and eloquent of his tribe, had little trouble in
convincing the others and deciding the matter according to
his oWn vieWs. ‘Among some of the southern nations, the
chiefs are said to have possessed greater poWer, to have been
distinguished by a peculiar dress, and at death to have trans-
mitted their authority to their sons.

and on his return passing through Sweden and Denmark, the
young Adams, though his education was thus irregular, en-
joyed unusual opportunities of becoming acquainted with
men and manners, and learning the routine of diplomatic
business. On the appointment of his father as minister to
England, he returned to his native country, and entered
Harvard University, where he was graduated with distinc-
tion in 1787. The study and practice of law next engaged
his attention; but, improving his leisure to publish some
political papers, he became known as a statesman, Was ap-
pointed by VVashington< minister to Netherlands and Portu-
gal, Was transferred by his father toPrussia, was sent to the
senate of Massachusetts and afterwards to the U. S. senate,
was made minister to Russia by Madison, and afterwards, as
we have seen, served as minister at the court of St. James,
and secretary of state under Monroe. By this extended ex-
perience was Mr. Adams qualiﬁed for the high oﬁiceto which
he was called; and though, soonafter his inauguration, the
friends of Crawford and Jackson combined to oppose the
administration and party-spirit‘ once more became violent,
yet the country enjoyed undiminished prosperity. Henry
Clay served as secretary of state throughout the whole of
Mr. Adams’ term. - .

528. On the 4th of July, 1826, the ﬁftieth anniversary of
the declaration of that independence which they had helped
to establish, among the rejoicings of their countrymen, and
while their own names were on every tongue, expired two of
the truest benefactors of America, John Adams and Thomas
J eﬁ‘erson,——the former at the age of 90; the latter, 82. Ad-
ams had been invited to participate in the celebration at
Quincy; but his weakness would not permit, and he could
only send as a toast his own words uttered half a century
before, “Independence forever!” Before the day was over,
he had ceased to breathe, his last words being “Jefferson
survives I” J

Jefferson did live, but it was beyond the grave; he had
died at an earlier hour the same day. For some time before,
his strength had been failing, but the wish which he had
earnestly expressed to see another 4th of July was gratiﬁed.
His last words were, “ I resign my soul to my God and my
daughter to my country.” A bereaved nation received the
tidings of these blows with every evidence of sorrow. Tears
fell in all parts of the Union. “It is right,” said Webster,
“that it should be thus; the tears which ﬂow, and the honors
that are paid, when the friends of the Republic die, give hope
that the Republic itself may be immortal.”

529. Adams renewed a proposition which had been made
by his predecessor, to purchase the lands of the Indians still
left in the several states, and remove them west of the Mis-
sissippi. Some of the tribes objected to parting with their
territory; but in February, 1826, a deputation from the
Creeks ceded all their lands in Georgia to the U. S. except
a million of acres; and these also were afterwards purchased.

530. A new element was introduced into the political con-
tests of the country by an occurrence which took place about
this time in the state of New York. Free-masonry, an an-
cient institution of Europe, originating with architects and
builders, but afterwards extended to all and supported by
many of high rank, found its way to America in 17 30.
Lodges were multiplied ;-and Washington, De Witt Clin-
ton, and other distinguished men became “ free and accepted
masons”. In September, 1826, William Morgan, a member
of the fraternity residing in western New York, having
threatened to publish a work which would reveal the secrets
of the order, was suddenly abducted from home, and never
afterwards seen by his friends. A He was traced to Lewiston,
and thence to Fort Niagara ; but no further clew to his fate
could be obtained. A committee of the legislature, appoint-

ed to investigate the matter, reported that he had been mur-

evidence to that eﬁ’ect could ever be obtained. An intense

. excitement arose against the masons, on whom the crime was

charged; and a party was formed with the avowed object
of suppressing their secret organization in the United States,
as dangerous to freedom of government and the safety of
the community. Masonry was too strong to be thus put
down; but feeling ran high against it, and for several years
at the North the Anti-masons exercised a powerful inﬂuence,
which they used freely for political purpose

and canals, improving harbors and the channels of rivers,
erecting light-houses, and making other provision for the
safety of coast navigation. To advance the manufacturing
interests, which had become important in the northern and
eastern states, he recommended increasing the duties on im-
ported goods. The necessity of such duties had been gener-
ally acknowledged, and in 1816, Lowndes and Calhoun, both
of South Carolina, advocated a high protective tariff, or list
of imposts. In 1828, in accordance With the views of the
president, increased duties were laid on cotton, woollen, and
linen fabrics, silks, iron, lead, (350. The North, largely engaged
in the manufacture of some of these articles, was of course
beneﬁted by this new tariff, because it prevented foreign
goods from selling lower than those at home ; but southern
statesmen, including Calhoun, violently opposed it, inasmuch
as the South, an agricultural and not a manufacturing coun-
try, had to pay higher prices for articles it was obliged to
use. Especially in South Carolina was this feeling exhibited;
and the people of Charleston showed their disapprobation by
placing their ﬂags at half-mast. V

533. Mr. Adams ran a second time for the presidency,
but was defeated by Gen. Jackson. Calhoun was reelected
vice-president. On the 4th of March, 1829, Adams resigned
the country, at peace with all the world, and still blessed
with internal prosperity, into the hands of his successor.

Jackson was a man of determined will, and his administra-
tion of the government was marked by the same energy and
self-reliance that humbled the Greeks and drove the ﬂower
of the‘British army from New Orleans.

535. In 1832, the United States was devastated by the
Asiatic cholera, a destructive epidemic which originated in
1817‘ in the marshes at the mouth of the Ganges. After
conﬁning its ravages for some years to India, it gradually
spread, till it reached London in 1831, creating a conster-
nation like that occasioned by the plague. Crossing the
Atlantic the following year, it appeared ﬁrst in Canada, and
thence quickly traversed the Union in a southwesterly direc-
tion, setting medical skill at deﬁance, and hurrying thou-
sands into eternity. Since then, a few cases of cholera have
occurred every summer, and the disease seems to have lost
much of its original virulence.

536. About this time, the northwestern frontier suffered from

1832] BLACK HAwK’s WAR. 403

what is known in history as Black Hawks Wa1'. The Sacs
and Foxes, occupying the Rock River country in Illinois, a
quarter of a century before had sold their lands to the United
States, but continued to inhabit them; and now that the
march of civilization had reached their borders, and govern-
ment was disposing of their territory to settlers, they re-
fused to leave it, on the ground that the original sale was
illegal. The governor of Illinois took the ﬁeld with 1,600
mounted men, and induced some of the chiefs to sign a new
treaty and cross the Mississippi ; but Black Hawk still held
out, and with such of his countrymen as he could raise de-
termined to defend ‘the graves of his fathers. Several skir-
mishes took place, and the war ﬁnally assumed so dangerous
an aspect that Gren. Scott was sent from the Atlantic coast
with nine companies of artillery. Moving with his usual dis-
patch, Scott reached Chicago, a distance of 1,800 miles, in
18 days; but there his force was overtaken by the cholera,
and before he could proceed on his march he lost more men
by the epidemic than all that were killed in the war. Thus
detained, and exposed to greater danger and suffering than
he had ever encountered on the ﬁeld of battle, Scott was un-
able to reach the scene of action; and Gen. Atkinson, in
several decisive battles, the last of which took place August
2nd, 1832, defeated the Sac chief,_and gained possession of
his person. After being conﬁned for a time in one of the
western forts, Black Hawk was taken to the Atlantic
cities, where he was well received, and saw much that ex-
cited his curiosity. Convinced by his tour that resistance
against so powerful a nation was useless, he was at length
allowed to rejoin his people. With regret he abandoned to
the pale-faces the ancient hunting-grounds of his tribe, and
retired to Iowa, where he died in 1838.

537. Diﬂiculties also arose with the Cherokees. This nation
now numbered 15,000 souls, and had made no_little advance

of its successive ravages. What is said of this disease since 1832? 536. From what
did the northwestern frontier suffer about this time? Relate the circumstances that
led to Black Hawk’s War. What was effected by the governor of Illinois? Who was

result of the War? What became of Black Hawk? 537. With what other tribe did

in the arts of civilized life. They had a republican govern-
ment, a printing-press, churches, and missionary schools in
which 500 children were receiving instruction. Tired. of
Waiting for the general government to remove them, ac-
cording to its engagement, the legislature of Georgia passed
laws abolishing the Cherokee republic, and extending the
jurisdiction of the state over their country. The Indians
claimed that the protection of the United States had been
guarantied them by numerous treaties, and appealed to the
Supreme Court, beforewhich their case Was argued by Mr.
Wi1't. Though the court declared the acts of Georgia un-
constitutional and void, the president favored the removal
of the Cherokees beyond the Mississippi; and Congress in

«I834 organized ‘‘ the Indian Territory”, part of which was

appropriated to their use. But the Cherokees refused to
leave their pleasant farms and the scenes of their childhood,
and at one time war was apprehended. At length, however,
in consideration of a little over $5,-000,000, they agreed to
cede their territory and remove t-o the West. Even after
this, obstacles were interposed; and it was not till 1837 that
they were induced by the conciliatory but determined meas-
ures of Gen. Scott, who was authorized to effect their re-
moval by force, if necessary, to commence their march to the
region assigned them on the bank of the Arkansas.

538. The dissatisfaction of South Carolina and other south-
ern states with the tariff of 1828 was greatly increased in
1832 by the passage of a law laying additional duties on for-
eign manufactures. The federal government was violently
denounced, and a party was formed in South Carolina, which
determined to nullify its action by preventing the collection
of the obnoxious duties in southern ports. They were known
as N ulliﬁers, and were led by Calhoun and Hayne. The
former resigned the vice-presidency that he might be elected

to the-senate, and there with his clear and logical reasoning
defend what he conceived to be the rights of his state; and
Hayne measured his eloquence against that of Webster in a
debate which has become celebrated in the parliamentary
history of America. The president issued a proclamation
against the nulliﬁers, Which was met by a counter-proclama-
tion from the governor of South Carolina. Both parties
prepared to support their views with arms; but J ackson’s
prompt measures determined the nulliﬁcation leaders to post-
pone their forcible opposition to the collection of duties till
March 1st, 1833. In the mean time, Clay, ever the friend
of the Union, appeared With a compromise which provided
for the gradual reduction of the duties in question, until in
ten years they should reach the low point demanded by
South Carolina. This bill was passed by Congress, and re-
ceived the president’s signature, March 3d, 1833. It restored
peace and averted evils which at one time threatened the
very existence of the Union. >

 539. J ackson’s energetic administration of the government
.:3’gave general satisfaction, and he was reelected, with Martin
Van Buren as vice—president. He entered on his second
term, March 4th, 1833.

540. Opposed to the United States Bank, and apprehend-
ing an abuse of the great power it wielded, the president in
1832 vetoed a bill passed by Congress, providing for a re-
newal of its charter in 1836. In October, 1833, he went so
far as to remove from it the public funds, then amounting to
about $10,000,000, and deposit them in certain state banks
selected for that purpose. So closely connected was the na-
tional bank with the commercia1.interests of the country,
that this act, cutting it off from the support of government,
created a panic, and plunged the mercantile community in
distress. Numerous failures followed; the president was

violently condemned, and was even censured by a resolution
of the senate. Jackson, however, conﬁrmed in his apprehen-
sions by this revulsion, and supported by the house of repre-
sentatives, stood ﬁrm, and, despite petitions and remonstran-
ces, refused to restore the deposits. The state banks enlarged
their operations; conﬁdence was gradually restored, and
commercial prosperity revived. “

541. In 1834, Jackson was compelled to take a decided
course with France. By a treaty made in 1831, the French
government had agreed to pay about $5,000,000 for injuries
done to American commerce during the wars of Napoleon.
The Chamber of Deputies having refused for several years
to appropriate the money, Jackson, in December, 1834, rec-

  ommended Congress to authorize reprisals on French com-

merce, and directed the American minister to demand his
passports and leave Paris. These peremptory measures had
the desired effect, and the money was promptly paid. Por-
tugal was made to pay a similar indemnity; treaties were
concluded with Russia and Belgium; and the United States
rapidly rose in the estimation of ‘European powers.

542. A war with the Seminoles, which was attended with
much danger and suffering to the troops and oﬂicers engaged
in it, broke out in 1835. It originated in an attempt to re-
move the Seminoles from their seats in Florida to lands pro-
vided for them West of the Mississippi, to which a delegation
of their chiefs had agreed to emigrate. Osceola [os-e-0’-la],
otherwise known as Powell, a half-breed of superior cunning
and bravery, was the leading spirit among the Red Men.
Preparing his people for a war of extermination on the white
settlers, he deluded the U. S. agents with fair promises till
he was ready to strike the intended blow. The murder of a
chief who had signed the treaty and the ﬂight of some friend-
ly Seminoles to the U, S. post at Tampa Bay, ﬁrst revealed
his purposes. -

1835] THE SEMINOLE WAR. 407

Troops were immediately ordered to Florida; and Major
Dade set out from Tampa with 117 men, to join Gen. Olinch
at Camp King, in the interior of the country. Dade’s force
fell into an ambuscade, and, though they defended the.m-
selves bravely, were all killed except one man, who, feigning
death, was thrown on a pile of bodies. When the enemy had
departed, he crept out and made his way through the woods
to his countrymen, after incredible sufferings, which, with
his wounds, soon proved fatal. General Thompson, while
dining with some friends within sight of the garrison at Camp
King, was massacredai-the same day that Dad_e’s detachment
was cut off. On the 31st of December, Gen. Clinch, having
marched against one of the Seminole settlements, was at-
tacked at disadvantage by Osceola, and, after a severe battle
in which the Indians were three times repulsed, returned to
Fort Drane, where he had ﬁxed his head-quarters. The
whole country was now ravaged by the Indians. Plantations
were devastated, houses burned, negroes carried off, families
murdered. The settlers ﬂed to the forts for refuge, but many
were cut off on the way.

; On the 7th of February, 1836, Gen. Scott, who had been
appointed to the command in Florida, reached St. Augustine,
Learning that Clinch was hard pressed at Fort Drane, he set
out as soon as possible for his relief. Gen. Gaines had also
taken the field from the west, with about a thousand men,
An action took place with the savages near the scene of

much from their depredations, the Creeks were ﬁnally sub-
dued and compelled to move west of the Mississippi.

The remaining history of the Seminole War, though it
belongsto Van Buren’s administration, will be given here.
Gen. Jessup succeeded Scott in the command of the army in
Florida. In October, 1837, Osceola presented himself with
a flag of truce at the American camp. Jessup, suspecting a
repetition of treachery and desiring to save unnecessary
bloodshed, disregarded the ﬂag, seized the chief, and sent
him to Fort Moultrie, near Charleston, where he died the
following year. The Seminoles, notwithstanding, continued
hostilities. In December, 1838, Col. Taylor (afterwards a
distinguished general in the Mexican War‘ and president of
the U.  set out with over a thousand men for the almost
inaccessible haunts to which the enemy had retreated. The
sufferings this army encountered from fatiguing marches
through tangled deserts and swamps ﬁlled with poisonous
insects and reptiles, can hardly be conceived. On the 25th
of December, 1838, they found the enemy prepared to re-
ceive them near O-kee-cho’-bee [Big Wate9'] Lake. After a
hard-fought battle, in which Taylor lost 139 men, the enemy,
who had also suﬁered severely, were obliged to retreat. For
more than a year longer the U. S. army underwent terrible
privations in their endeavors to bring this harassing war to
an end. A treaty was signedin 1839; but the Seminoles
did not entirely desist from their ravages till 1842, when
peace was ﬁrmly established. Since then, numbers of them
have been removed to the West.

543. Two destructive c0n_ﬂagrations, which were regarded
as national calamities, occurred about this time. On the 16th
of December, 1835, a fire broke out in the lower part of the
city of New York, which was occupied by large mercantile
houses. The night ‘being so cold that the water froze as
it was drawn from the hydrants, over thirty acres were

$18,000,000 Worth of property were consumed. It was
feared that so serious aloss would embarrass the business
community; a few failures occurred, but “the burnt district”
was speedily covered with magniﬁcent warehouses, which
greatly improved that section of the city. The other ﬁre
alluded to took place at Washington, Dec. 15, 1836, destroy-
ing the U. S. Post Ofﬁce, and the Patent Oﬁice, with 7,000
models and 10,000 designs of inventions. _

544. The great men who died during J ackson’s adminis-
tration must not be forgotten. On the 4th of July, 1831,
Monroe breathed his last at the residence’ of his son-in-law in
New York, in his 72nd year. He died, like Jeﬁerson and
Adams, amid national rejoicings for blessings which he had
helped to secure. Monroe was a native of Westmo1'eland
County, Virginia.» He shed his blood at Trenton in the
Revolutionary War, served with gallantry at Brandywine,
Grermantown, and Monmouth, and was eminently successful

‘as a diplomatist and statesman.

The year 1832 witnessed the departure of Charles Carroll,
of Carrollton, the last surviving signer of the Declaration of
Independence, at the advanced age of 96. He had served
his country in various public stations with ﬁdelity and suc—
cess, and had seen it increase in population from two to thir-=
teen millions. The _same year died Philip Freneau [fre-n0’],
one of the poets of the Revolution, whose patriotic verses
had done much towards rousing his countrymen for that
great struggle. He died at the age of 80, near Freehold,
New Jersey.

On the 24th of May, 1833, J ohn. Randolph, of Roanoke,
Va., a descendant of Pocahontas, died at the age of 60. He
commenced public life in 1799, and served thirty years in
Congress, where he became distinguished for his eccentric
conduct, his sharpness of wit, and his tremendous powers of
sarcasm which made him feared by all parties. In 1830,

C H A P T E R X I .
VAN IsUREN’s ADMINISTRATION, 183 7-1 841.

547. MARTIN VAN BUREN was ‘born at Kinderhook, New
York, on the 5th of December, 1782. He left school at 14;
was admitted to the bar at 21; was elected to the ‘N. Y.
senate in his 30th year; was sent to the U. S. senate in 1821 ;
was chosen governor of N. Y. in 1828; became J ackson’s
secretary of state the following year; was appointed min-
ister to Great Britain, and then received in succession the
two highest oﬂices in the gift of his countrymen.

548. Hardly was Van Buren seated in the presidential
chair, when the business community were paralyzed by a
revulsion in their monetary affairs. The last year of J ack-
son’s administration had been one of great apparent pros-
perity. The national debt was extinguished, and a surplus
of nearly $40,000,000 had accumulated in the treasury, which
Congress ordered to be distributed among the several states.
Banks had multiplied to such an extent that there were com-
puted to be no less than 677 in the Union, with 146 branches;
most of which had issued notes to a large amount beyond
what they were able to redeem. Business men traded ex-
tensively on credit, and in many cases gave up honest indus-
try for wild speculation. This unhealthy state of things was
necessarily followed by a revulsion, and the crisis occurred
in the spring of 1837. The banks of New York and New
Orleans suspended specie payments, that is, refused to re-
deem their notes with gold or silver; and their example was
followed throughout the country. Several hundred mercan-
tile houses immediately stopped payment, and in New Or-
leans alone failures to the amount of $27,000,000 took place
within two days.

An order known as “ the specie circular” had been issued

by Jackson, requiring all payments to the government to be
made in gold and silver, a.nd thus, it was claimed, large quan-
tities of specie were kept out of circulation. A committee of
N. Y. merchants petitioned the president to rescind the cir-
cular. Van Buren refused their request, but called an extra
session of Congress. That body took measures to protect
the government from embarrassment, but could do little to
relieve the prevalent distress. The return of conﬁdence and
prosperity was necessarily slow. The New York banks re-
sumed specie payments in May, 1838, as did those in other
places shortly after. ’

At this extra session Van Buren submitted his famous
Sub-treasury Scheme, for the safe keeping of the public funds.
It was at ﬁrst violently opposed and failed to pass ; but, pre-
sented at a subsequent session, it became a law in 1840.
The Sub-treasury Bill provided that all government dues
should be paid in gold or silver, Which should not, as before,
be deposited in banks, but should be kept in certain offices
in the chief cities of the Union, under the care of persons
appointed for the purpose, called sub-treasurers, Who should
give security for the proper discharge of their duty. The
sub-treasury bill Was the great measure of Van Buren’s ad-
ministration, and called forth violent denunciations from his
opponents. Keeping a large amount of specie in the vaults
of government, it compelled the banks to limit their opera-
tions, and through them acted on the community. With
such effect Was this argument used ‘in the election of 1840,
that Van Buren, who Was running for a second term, Was
defeated by a large majority. ' 1

crossed the border to render them assistance. A party of
700 men took possession of Navy Island, a British depen-
dency in the Niagara River [see Map, p. 351], and fortiﬁed
it so strongly as to resist an attack from the loyalists. The
steamer Caroline was employed to bring them munitions
from Schlosser on the American side. Late, at night, near
the close of December, 1837, a party of loyalists crossed
from Canada, set ﬁre to the Caroline, cut her from her moor-
ings, and allowed her to drift over the falls. By these pro-
ceedings the peaceful relations between Great Britain and
the U. S. were endangered; but Van Buren promptly issued
a proclamation forbidding interference in the affairs of Can-
ada, and sent Gen. Wool to the frontier. The force on Navy
Island surrendered their arms and dispersed; and, not long
after, another body which had assembled in N. Y. near the
Canada line, with hostile intentions, followed their example.
The insurrection was soon suppressed, and harmony between
the two countries was once more restored.

CHAPTER XII.

ADMINISTRATION on HARRISON AND TYLER, 1841-1845.

550. VAN BUREN was succeeded by William Henry Har-
rison, of Ohio, who was inaugurated March 4th, 1841.
Harrison was born on the James River, Virginia, in 1773,
and on the death of his father was placed under the guar-
dianship of Robert Morris, the great ﬁnancier of the Revo-
lution. Having graduated at Hampden Sidney College, he
applied himself to the study of medicine; but, before the
completion of his course, the news of Indian aggressions in
the West led him to join the army then about to take the

men? [See Map, p. 351.——What place in New York near Navy Island? What other

ﬁeld, and he received from Washington a commission as
ensign. Bearing himself gallantly in the armies of St. Clair
and Wayne, he was rapidly promoted, and ﬁnally became
lieutenant-governor of the North-west Territory. In 17 99,
he was sent to Congress as its ﬁrst delegate; and soon after
he was appointed governor of Indiana,which then included,
not only the region now so called, but also Illinois, Michigan,
and Wisconsin. His services in this capacity, and his victo-
ries at Tippecanoe and the Thames, gained for him the
hearty gratitude of the West, as well as the unreserved con-
ﬁdence of the whole Union.

John Tyler was the new vice-president. Born in 17 90 in
Virginia, the was graduated at 17 at William and Mary Col-
lege, was admitted to the bar two years afterwards, and soon
became distinguished in his profession. Tyler was not long
in attaining political prominence. After serving successively
in the legislature and in Congress, he was in 1825 elected
governor of Virginia. Called to the U. S. senate, he ran an
honorable career in that body, consistently carrying out state
rights principles and generally voting with the democratic
party. Differing from Jackson on some points, and an ar-
dent friend of Clay, though known to be opposed to the U. S.
Bank, he was placed on the same ticket with Gen. Harrison.

551. Harrison appointed Daniel Webster, of Massachu-
setts, secretary of state, and soon after his inauguration
called an extra session of Congress, to consider “ sundry im-
portant matters connected with the ﬁnances of the country”.
When Congress met, the president was no more. He died
on the 4th of April, 1841, from disease brought on by fatigue

and exposure. Tyler thus became president, and on the 6th-

of April he took the oathof oﬁice.

Congress, at its extra session, occupied itself chieﬂy with
the ﬁnancial interests of the country. The Sub-treasury Act
was repealed, and a Bankrupt Law was passed, which freed

countrymen? Who was the new vice-president? Where was John Tyler born? Give
an account of his early life. What course did he pursue in the senate? How did he

those who had failed from their obligations, and enabled

them to recommence business. The great question before
Congress, however, was the establishment of a national bank.
A bill providing for such an institution was framed by Clay
and passed both houses; but, to the indignation of the Whigs
throughout the country, it was vetoed by the president. An-
other bill, similar in substance but modiﬁedin some of its
details, was passed the following September; but this also
received Mr. Tyler’s veto. Violent abuse was lavished on the
president for thusdefeating the favorite measure of the party
that elected him; yet he was merely carrying out the prin-
ciples which he had always. held on this subject. The cabi-
net showedtheir disapproval of his course by resigning, Mr.
Webster‘ alone retaining his seat on account of several im-
portant public interests which would have suffered from his
resignation. , S

7 552. One of these was the settlement of a boundary line
on the northeast, between the possessions of Great Britain

and the United States. War was at one time threatened;
-but the excitement that pervaded the country, particularly

those parts of Maine and New Brunswick which bordered
on the disputed line, was laid at rest by a treaty made by
Lord Ashburton and Daniel Webste1' on the part of their
respective countries, and ratiﬁed by thesenate August 20th,
1842.

553. The charter of the U. S. Bank expired by limitation
in 1836. President Jackson’s veto, as we have seen, pre«»
vented it from receiving a new charter from the general
government; _but.it succeeded in obtaining one from Penn-
sylvania, and continued its operations under the management
of Nicholas Biddle. Its directors, however, abandoning the

ventured into the same wild system of speculation that was
ruining other institutions, and, like ‘them, it was compelled
to suspend in 1837. It resumed payrnen.t,.but again specu-
lated beyond its means; and, notwithstanding the exertions
of its friends, it ﬁnally failed in October, 1841, involving
many in ruin.

554. The summer of 1842 was signalized by the return of
an exploring expedition which had been sent out four years
before by the government,under the command of Lieutenant
Charles Wilkes, of the U. S. navy. Accompanied by a large_
corps of scientiﬁc men, and well provided with every thing
that could assist them in their researches, Lieut. Wilkes had
traversed the Paciﬁc, visited various ~ groups of islands be-
fore but little known, surveyed different parts of the western
coast of America, and made many important. discoveries in the
far south, which was the particular scene of his explorations.
Among other things, he discovered and coasted for a dis-
tance of 1 700 miles what is known as the Antarctic Continent.
The whole distance traversed was 90,000 miles. .

555. Rhode Island and New York were each the seat of
internal disturbances during Tyler’s administration. In
Rhode Island, the difﬁculties originated in attempts to change
the constitution granted by Charles II., under which the gov-
ernment had been administered for nearly two hundred years.
According to this instrument, no citizencould vote unless he
had a certain amount of property. This provision and others
it was deemed best to alter; but a difference of opinion on
some of the points involved gave rise to two parties, known
as the “ suf’I'rage”»and the “ law and order” party, each of
which elected a governor, and prepared to support its claims
with arms. The suffrage party, whose proceedings had not
beenin accordance with existing laws, elected Thomas W.
Dorr. He took possession of the state arsenal, May 18th,
1843, but was soon compelledto ﬂee before the militia, who

was it compelled to do? What was its ﬁnal fate? 554. What signalized the summer of

were called out by his opponents. A second attempt of the
suffrage men was defeated by the troops of the United
States. Dorr was apprehended, convicted of treason, and
sentenced to imprisonment for life; but he was afterwards
pardoned. A new constitution, formed according to pro»
visions of the legislature, went into effect in May, 1843.

The disturbances in New York originated in Rensselaer
county. In the early history of this state, as we have seen,
large tracts were granted to certain persons called patroons,
for their services in bringing over colonists from the old
world. Among these was Van Rensselaer, whose successors

divided the land thus obtained into farms, and invited. settlers s

by leasing them out on very favorable terms. This arrange-

ment had been in force for generations; but in 1840, the

farms having by this time increased greatly in value, Van

Rensselaer’s tenants began to murmur, and even refused to

pay their rent, which was in most cases but a few bushels of
wheat, three or four fat fowls, and a day’s service with wag-

on and horses, each year. The legislature having tried in
vain to settle the diﬂiculty, in 184.-4, the Anti-renters, as they
were called, assumed a bolder tone; disguised as Indians,
they tarred and feathered such of their fellow-tenants as
paid their rent, and resisted and even killed the ofﬁcers sent
to serve‘ warrants on them. Similar disturbances broke out
in Columbia and Delaware counties, where lands were held
on a like tenure. In 1846, Silas W1'ight, governor of New

York, declared Delaware county in a state of insurrection,
and supported the civil ofﬁcers with a military force. The
leading Anti-renters were taken, tried, condemned, and sen-
tenced to imprisonment, some of them for life.‘ Peace was

thus restored; but in 1847 Governor Young pardoned the
offenders, and the anti-rent difficulties do not yet seem to be
permanently settled.

thing they wanted, for health, for courage, and for success
in hunting and war.

The American Indians had no _idols or temples. These
Were probably devised after their fathers had separated from
the rest of mankind and emigrated to America. They spoke
of certain natural objects as inferior divinities, but regarded
them_merely as symbols or representatives of the Manitou
[mom/-e-too], or Great Spirit.

With this general idea of the Deity different tribes blend-
ed various traditions of their own. The Shawnees, for in-
stance, believed that the Great Spirit was an Indian, and
that he made all the races of men, not out of nothing, but
out of himself. The Delawares, and indeed Indians gener-
ally, thought that the Deity possessed a human form, and
was in all respects a man.

56. "There were various traditions concerning the Crea-
tion, of which that of the Chip’-pe-ways may be mentioned.
When the first man came into the world they did not pre-»
tend to say, but they believed that he appeared in the sum-
mer months, and subsisted on berries. In the winter he
lived by hunting; but when a deep snow came, ﬁnding it
difficult to walk, he tried to make a snow-shoe. He formed
the frame of the shoe without difficulty, but when it came
to weaving in the web he succeeded poorly, an.d at last aban-»
cloned the work. On returning from hunting, however,
every evening, he found that the work had progressed, and
ﬁnally saw a bird ﬂy away, which he supposed had been en-
gaged upon it. At last he captured the bird by stratagem,
and it immediately turned into a beautiful woman.

57. The Red Men generally believed in the existence oi
good and bad spirits; the former of whom held intercourse

perior power. Those who were thus favored were known
as “ medicine-men”, and to them resort was had for advice

consequence of the proceedings of a body of men calling
themselves Mormons, or Latter-Day Saints. This sect was
founded by Joseph Smith, a native of Vermont. Having
removed. to l central New York, and received an imperfect
education, Smith, at the age of 15, asserted that he saw
visions; and, seven years afterwards, he declared that he
had received a revelation froms on high in the form of rec-
ords, which had rbeenburied in the earth for centuries, They
were engraved, according to the . account of a Mormon wri-
ter, on plates having the appearance of gold and the thick-
ness of tin, which were covered with Egyptian characters,
andunited by means of rings. Smith pretended to under-
stand and translate this famous “Book of Mormon”, and
set it forth as a new gospel; for men.‘ It_ contains sundry
wonderful stories about events in America over 2,000 years
ago; and it is said to have been written by a man named
Spaulding as a romance. ' r

The immorality of the Mormon doctrines, among which
that of polygamy, or the allowing of a plurality of wives,Was
prominent, recommended them to some ; and in 1833 Smith
found ‘himself at the head of 1 200 followers. Jackson county,
Missouri, became their head-.quarte_rs_; but, as they declared
that the whole western country was destined for their‘inher—
itance, and as various thefts were committed in their neigh-
borhood, the Missourians naturally desired to get rid of them.
The ﬁrst opportunity was seized to call out the militia ; and
the Mormons, offeringnoresistance, were driven from the
state. They crossed to Illinois, and in the spring of 1840,
founded, on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi, the city of
Nauvoo (a word which they saylsigniﬁes lbeavmgful). Here
they erected a magniﬁcent temple, and received a large ad»-
dition of members,_ some of whom were men of property;

At length the Mormons passed ordinances which set the
laws of Illinois at deﬁance. Great excitement spread through-
out the state,and some of the “Saints” left Nauvoo inalarm.
Several robberies and murders committed near their city
were attributed to the followers of the prophet; and popu-
lar fury was increased by the. belief that the Mormons con-
trolled the county courts, and could set at deﬁance all at-
tempts to bring them to justice. At last Joseph Smith,
still the leading spirit among the Mormons, was arrested,
and, With his brother, lodged in jail at Carthage. Here, on
the 7th of July, 1844, they were killed by a mob, which
broke into the prison. The Mormons continued to be the
objects of popular» suspicion and odium; and so violently
werethese feelings displayed that the next year they sold

their possessions in Illinois, deserted their beautiful city,

which then contained 10,000 inhabitants, and emigrated to
the wilderness beyond the Rocky Mountains, where we shall
again have occasion to notice them.

557. Serious riots occurred in May and June, 1844, at
Philadelphia, growing out of differences between a party
known as Native Americans and the Irish inhabitants of that
city. Fire-arms were used, and over a hundred persons were
killed or wounded. Thirty dwelling-houses, a seminary, and
three churches, were burned. Quiet was not restored till
the governor had taken the ﬁeld with 5,000 men. »

T 558. Acts admitting Florida and Iowa into the Union were
passed March 3, 1845 ; but Iowa did not enter till 1846.

559. Towards the close of this administration, the new
republic of Texas became an object of general attention and
interest. This extensive tract, lying west and southwest of
Louisiana, had been early explored by Ponce de Leon and La
Salle. Claimed by both Spanish and French, it was held
and governed by the former, who in 1692 established a set-
tlement at San Antonio de Bexar [sum cm-to’-ne-0 dc? bé’-haw].

Colonization, however, was discouraged by the authorities,
who desired to keep an’ impassable wilderness between them-
selves and their enterprising neighbors. on the north. For-

and so strong was the aversion entertained towards the peo-=
ple of the United States that a Spanish captain-general de-
clared, if he had the power, he would not even allow a bird.
to ﬂy over‘ the boundary. For years, therefore, did Texas
remain uninhabited except by roving Indians, a few fortiﬁed
inclosures being the only evidences of European settlement.

‘In 1800 but three of these stations remained,—San Antonio,

Groliad [g0’-le-ad], and Nae-og—do’-ches. I
From the time of its conquest by Cortez, Mexico was
governed by Spanishviceroys, who aimed, not to improve
the country, but simply to make it proﬁtable to the crown.
Mining, therefore, became the chief branch of industry, to
the exclusion of agriculture and commerce. The people,
shut out from the rest of the world, became imbued with a
servile spirit ; and it was not till Spain herself fell under the
power of Napoleon "in 1808 that they thought of asserting
their right to selflgovernment. In 1810, a revolutionary
movement commenced; but, after a struggle continued at
intervals for seven years, it was ﬁnally put down by the
Spanish authorities. A second attempt in 1821, under Gen.
Iturbide [6-toor’-be-dd] was more successful, and Mexican in-
dependence was established on a ﬁrm basis. Iturbide, how-
ever, having proclaimed himself emperor, oifended the people,

the United States.

560. Meanwhile Spain had changed her policy with re’-
spect to the colonization of Texas, and granted Moses Aus-
tin, a native of Connecticut, a large tract in that province,
on condition that he would settle it with three hundred fam-
ilies. This grant, conﬁrmed by the new government of
Mexico, was transferred by Moses'Austin, at his death, to
his son Stephen. The three hundred families having been
introduced from the United States according to agreement,
Austin obtained a further grant for ﬁve hundred more.
Other emigrants naturally followed; and in 1830 there were
not far from 20,000 Americans in Texas. -

The prosperity of these settlers awakened the .jealousy of
the Mexicans, and an unjust and oppressive policy was pur-
sued towards them. Their remonstrances being dirsegarded,
they declared their independence of Mexico, and made ready
to support it by force of arms. Volunteers from America
hastened to their aid. In 1835, the revolution began with
the battle of Gonzales [gbn-zoo/L’-lcis], in which 1,000 Mexi-
cans were defeated by 500 Texans. Goliad, andthe strong
citadel of Bexar, known as the Alamo [ah-Zcth’-mo], were
soon after taken, and the whole Mexican army was dispersed.

On the 6th of March, 1836, however, Santa Anna, having ,

raised a new force of 8,000 men, attacked the Alamo, which
had been left in charge of a small but gallant garrison. All
night they fought, but superior numbers triumphed. Every
man fell at his post but seven, and these were killed while
asking quarter. i Here died David Crocket, the famous hunt-
er. Crocket had enjoyed but two months’ instruction at a
country ‘school; but his strong common sense and indomi-
table courage made him very popular among the people of
Tennessee, who three times elected him to Congress. In
1.834 he went to Texas, to strike a blow for freedom. The

FALL OF CROGKET IN THE ALAMO

561. On the 21st of April was fought the decisive battle
of San J a-cin’-to, in which Santa Anna, with 1,500 men, was
defeated by 800 Texans under Gen. Samuel Houston [/zew’-
stzm] (since a member of the U. S. senate). The Mexican
leader, taken the next day in the woods, was compelled to
acknowledge the independence of Texas, but the legislature
refused to ratify his act. Hostilities, however, were virtu-
ally abandoned by Mexico; and the independence of the new
republic was soon acknowledged by the United States, by
France, Great Britain, and other European powers. In 183 7,
Texas asked to be admitted into the Union ; but the propo-
sal was declined by Van Buren through fear of’ a War with
Mexico. In the spring of 1844, the American population of
Texas having increased to over 200,000, the question was re-

of Crocket. [See Map, p. 426.—How is San Antonio situated ?] 561. What took place

of the United States on the subject at the next presidential
election. The Whigs, who were opposed to the admission of
Texas, nominated Henry Clay; the democrats, who were in
favor of its admission, ‘supported James Knox Polk, of Ten-
nessee. Mr. Polk was elected, and with him George M.
Dallas, of Pennsylvania, as vice-president.

562. The news ofMr. Poll_;’s nomination and other pro-
ceedings of the democratic convention were transmitted from
Baltimore to Washington, May 29, 1844, by the Magnetic
Telegraph, being the ﬁrst dispatches’ ever so communicated.
The principle involved in the Telegraph was known as ‘early
as 1774, but Samuel F. B. Morse, a native of Massachusetts,
was the ﬁrst. to applyiit practically. I He received apatent
for his invention in 1837, and after long and discouraging
delay obtained from Congress an appropriation of $30,000
for the purpose of testing its utility. r The. ﬁrst telegraphic
line inthe world was thus ‘established between Baltimore
and Washington; and the importance of the invention, as-
one of the greatest triumphs yet achieved by human inge-
nuity, was demonstrated to the world. Telegraph wires soon
threaded the country, and there are now in the United States
and Canada over 40,000 miles in operation.

governor of Tennessee. From that post he retired to private

come its chief He had been seated in the presidential chair
but about three months, when his esteemed friend and coun-
sellor, Gen. Jackson, died at the advanced age of 7 8, respect-
ed and lamented even by his political opponents. Mr. Polk
made James Buchanan, of Pennsylvania, his secretary of state.
564. The success of the democratic party having shown
that a majority of the people were in favor of annexing
Texas, Congress had passed a bill providingfor that measure
a few days before the close of Tyler’s term. r On the 4th of
July, 1845, the Texas legislature having approved of the bill,
the union was consummated. Shortly afterwards, at the
request of this same body, a small force of U. S. troops
was dispatched to the frontier, under Gen. Zachary Taylor,
who had won distinction in the Seminole Wai’. The boun-
dary between Texas and Mexico was still unsettled; the for-
mer looked upon the Rio Grande [re’-0 gm/m’-dd], the latter
on the ueces [nwo'/-3&3], as the separating line [see Map, p.
.426], the region between these two rivers being claimed by
both. To prevent difficulties, the..U. S. government proposed
to ﬁx on a line by negotiation, but Mexico scornfully refused
all overtures. The annexation of Texas was the signal for
her minister to leave Washington with threats of war. Pa
redes [goa/2.-re?’-dais], a well-known enemy of the United States,
was elected president. The hostility of the Mexicans, which
had been displayed for years in petty insults and injuries to
American citizens, was now openly and ﬁercely avowed.
Strong forces were said to be gathering for the invasion of
Texas. Under these circumstances, the U. S. government
felt ustiﬁed in assuming that the boundary claimed by Texas
was correct; and Taylor was instructed to take a position as

is told of his previous history? Who died three months after his inauguration? Whom
did Polk make secretary of state ? 564. Relate the circumstances under which Texas was
admitted. What precautionary measure was taken by the United States? What con-

proposal was made by the United States? How was it received? Give an account of

near the Rio Grande as prudence would allow. According-
ly, he encamped at Corpus Christi User’-10003 lore’-ste], at the
mouth of the Nueces, and there remained till the following
spring. .

565. While these difficulties were pending, a rupture with
Great Britain was seriously threatened. A boundary line
between the U. S. and the British Possessions on the north-
west never having been settled, both laid claim to an exten
sive region between the Rocky Mountains and the Paciﬁc,
known as Oregon, which was now becoming gradually set-
tled. The democratic party were for accepting nothing
short of parallel 54° 40’ as the northern boundary of the U.
S. west of the mountains; but in June, 1846, a treaty nego-4
tiated in Washingtoii established parallel 49° and the Strait
of San Juan de Fuca [scm wha/m dc? foo’-ccth] as the separa-
ting line. The white population of this region was then
about 4,000. Oregon was organized into a territory in 1848.
In 1853, it was divided, and the northern part was _formed
into a new territory named Washington.

566. Mexico still refusing the overtures of the United
States for a peaceable settlement, Gen. Taylor, early in 1846,
was ordered to advance to the Rio Grande and occupy the
disputed territory. This he proceeded to do, in spite of the
protest of the Mexican authorities. Near the end of March,
he reached the river, and commenced the erection of a fort
on its eastern side. About the middle of April, Gei1.Am-
pudia [ahm-poo’-de-a] arrived at Mat-a-mo’-ras, opposite
Taylor’s position, and informed the American commander,
that, unless he retired beyond the Nueces, Mexico would
accept the war thus forced upon her. Taylor, of course,
did not retire, and skirmishes with the enemy‘ immediately
followed.

horseback, this brave oﬂicer was struck by a shell, which tore.

the ﬂesh from his limbs. “Leave me alone,” said he to the
brother officers who gathered round him as he fell; “ you
are wanted forward.” The shades of night put an end to
the battle, and the Americans remained masters of the ﬁeld.
n Resuming their march the following day, the American
army at three in the afternoon found the Mexicans in full
force at Resaca de la Palma [9”€3—86Z/2/—kC6 dd lair pcthl’-ma/L],
a ravine supposed to have been formerly the bed of a river,
about three miles from Fort Brown. Again the action was
commenced by artillery; and the Mexican’ guns, well aimed
and rapidly discharged, for a time held the Americans in
check. It was necessary to silence them, and the desperate
task was intrusted to Capt. May and his bold dragoons..
Right upon the batteries, still thundering forth death, rode
the fearless band. Half of them fell, but the guns were.cap-
tured, and with them Gen. La Vega [la/L mi’-gait], in the act
of applying a lighted match. The Mexicans were a second
time defeated, and so hopelessly that they halted not till they

had placed the Rio Grande between them and their victors..-

The American loss was 122 in killed and wounded. Of the
Mexicans, 200 were found dead on the ﬁeld, their total loss
being not far from 1,000 men. The next day the American
army reached Fort Brown. During their absence, it had
sustained analmost incessant bombardment from the enemy.
The garrison with much labor and suffering had made good
their defence, though their commander, a much valued offi-
cer, was mortally wounded by a shell.

No sooner had the news that hostilities with Mexico
had actually commenced reached the United States, than it
set the whole country ina blaze. Congress declared [May
11th, 1846] that war existed by the act of Mexico. Ten

when an important enterprise was about to be undertaken.
Besides the herbs Whose use he was taught by experience,
the medicine-man employed various incantations and magi-
cal ceremonies : if successful, he was thought to have gained
a victory over the evil spirit; and, if the patient died, this
same evil spirit bore the blame.

58. The Indians believed that the soul, freed from the body
at death, hastened to the happy hunting-grounds. Before it
could reach this blissful region, they thought it had to pass
some ordeal by which its worthiness was tested. This was
generally represented as a bridge over a dark river. The
wicked fell into the stream, and either remained there for-
ever, struggling with the waves, or were borne. oﬁ° to a place
of perpetual torture. The good, on the other hand, crossed
in safety, and reached the happy hunting-grounds, which were
stocked with the choicest game and abounded in all that
could render the warrior happy. I

markable want of foresight. This was seen in his neglect to

‘provide food beyond what was needed for the moment.

What he suffered one year did not increase his industry the
next, or make him more careful to provide against similar
distress for the future. The greatest warriors were unable
to carry out any far-reaching policy.

Another prominent trait of the Red Men was sleepless
caution. Whether‘ among friends or foes, they watched ev-
ery movement around them with suspicion. They spoke
little, and weighed well every Word. They showed great
ﬁrmness in trial, and rarely gave way to their feelings. For
the most part, they were true-hearted patriots. The graves
of their fathers they defended with the greatest bravery;
and, if they displayed cruelty towards their foes, it must be
remembered that they were so taught from infancy.

millions of dollars were immediately appropriated for its
prosecution, and the president was authorized to accept the
services of 50,000 volunteers. Public meetings were held in
all parts of the country, and within a few weeks 200,000 men
volunteered for the war. A magniﬁcent plan of invasion
was devised by government, with the aid of Gen. Scott.
The Paciﬁc coast of Mexico was to be attacked by a power-
ful ﬂeet, aided by a land force, to be designated “the Army
of the West”, which was to make its way across the Rocky
Mountains, reducing in succession the northern provinces of
the enemy. Another body, called “the Arm.y of the Centre”,
was to march into the heart of Mexico and cooperate with
Gen. Taylor’s’ force, which was known as “the Army of
Occupation”. Gen. Wool, one of the heroes of Queenstown,
was intrusted with the duty of mustéring the volunteers.
Before the close of July, he inspected and received into the
service 12,000 men, 9,000 ofqwhom were dispatched to the
aid of Gen. Taylor, while the rest Were sent to San Antonio,
in Texas, to be disciplined and prepared for the ﬁeld by Gen.
Wool himself. ‘ A

568. Onthe 18th of May, Gen. Taylor crossed the Rio
Grande and took possession of Matamoras, which was aban-
doned by the enemy’s troops. Moving along the south side
of the river, he captured several other towns with little or
no opposition; but it was not till the end of August that he
found himself strong enough to advance against Monterey
[man-ta’?-ré’], whose massive walls of stone were defended by
42 pieces of artillery. This city was prepared for either
storm or siege. The houses were fortiﬁed, the streets barri-
caded; and 10,000 Mexicans, most of them regulars, had
assembled for its defence. On the 19th of September, 1846,
Gen. Taylor with a little over 6,000 Americans encamped
within three miles of Monterey. ‘

1846] CAPTURE or MONTEREY. 429

Embosomed in mountains, Monterey was inaccessible, ex-
cept from the northeast, in which direction Taylor was ap-
proaching, and from the west by a road through a rocky
gorge, connecting it with Saltillo [scthl-zfeelﬁyo]. That he
might cut off the supplies of the city and attack it on both
sides at once, Taylor dispatched Gen. Wo1'th with 650 men
to gain the Saltillo road in the rear of the city. With great
difficulty and not without loss this was effected, by opening
a new road over the mountains. Two batt.eries were gal-
lantly carried ;, the Bishop’s Palace, an unﬁnished but
strongly fortiﬁed stone building, waspnext taken; and thus,
after two days of suﬁ"ering, Wo1'th’s command, considerably
reduced in number, reached the walls of the city.

, Meanwhile the Americans on the other side were not idle.
Under Generals Quitman, Butler, and Taylor himself, they
fought their way past one obstacle after another till’ they ef-
fected a lodgment in the city. The grand assault was made
September 23rd. A deadly ﬁre was poured on the assaila
ants from the houses and barricades which commanded the
streets; but," moving on unﬂinchingly through it, they at
length planted their victorious ﬂag in the Plaza, or public
square. Here entering the buildings on both sides of the
streets, they forced their way through the walls from one to
another by means of crowbars, and ascending to the roofs

‘ met the enemy hand to hand. Success crowned their exer-

tions, though many fell. On the morning of the 24th, the
city capitulated. The Mexicans were allowed to march out
with the honors of war; and Gen. Taylor, being short of
provisions and assured that the Mexican government was
about making proposals for peace, agreed to an armistice for
eight weeks.

of the war was living as an exile at Havana, had returned to
Mexico, President Polk, who believed that he would favor

the reestablishment of peace, having di-rected the American
commodore in the Gulf to let him pass Without molestation.

‘On the arrival of this distinguished general, the spirits of the

Mexicans revived. They deposed Paredes and elected Santa
Anna president. Laying aside all thoughts of peace if he
had ever entertained any, Santa Anna immediately set about
raising a powerful army, and by December he had 20,000
men concentrated at San Louis Potosi [190-to’-se].

570. Gen. Wool, having drilled his men into an effective
army, set out from San Antonio on the 20th of September.
After traversing a desert for miles Without ﬁnding Water or
any trace of man, making their road as they advanced and
suffering incredibly, this little force, on the last day of Octo-
ber, reached Mon-clo’-va, 70 miles from Monterey. Here
they Were informed of the capture of the latter city; and
Wool, by Taylor’s advice abandoning the idea of a separate
invasion, advanced to a point from Which he could keep the
army at Monterey supplied with provisions. These Were
cheerfully furnished by the inhabitants, Who found them-
selves safer under American rule than they had been under
their own government. Gren. Wool kept his men under rigid
discipline, and studiously protected the persons and property
of the Mexicans from injury. ‘

571. The armistice having terminated, Gen. VVortl1 was
sent to take possession of Salti-llo; and Taylor, leaving Gen.
Butler as governor of Monterey, advanced to Victoria, with
the intention of attacking Tampico [mm-106'-00]. At Victoria
he learned that Tampico had been already taken, and that
he Was superseded in the chief command by Gen. Scott, who
had" arrived at the seat of War. Though chagrined at the
latter. intelligence, yet when ordered to send the ﬂower of
his army to Scott, to fall back on Monterey, and act only on
the defensive, Taylor promptly obeyed. Generals Wo1'th

dered to join the commander-in-chief. Taylor and Wool
were thus left with a very small force to face an overwhelme
ing army with which Santa Anna was advancing to crush
them. Reinforcements, however, arriving during the month
of February, swelled the American army to 6,000 men. Gar-
risoning Monterey and Saltillo, Taylor boldly advanced with
about 4,700 men, to meet four times that number of Mexicans
now on their march from San Louis Potosi. Selecting a favor-
able position at Buena Vista [bwc"z’-not/L vees’-tah], where the
road passed through a narrow deﬁle, the American general
awaited the enemy. They were not long in arriving. On
the 22nd of February, Santa Anna sent, word to Gen. Taylor
that he was surrounded by 20,000 men, and summoned him
to surrender. Taylor declined the invitation, and made
ready for an encounter which he felt would be the most try-
ing in which he had yet engaged.

At sunrise on the 23rd, the Mexicans commenced the
battle of Buena Vista by trying to outﬂank the Americans
with a body of light troops which had pushed forward along
the heights during the night; but the riﬂes of Illinois drove
them back. At 8 o’clock, a tremendous charge was made
on the American centre; but before its solid front and the
deadly aim of Capt. VVashington’s artillery the enemy re-
coiled in disorder. Their next attempt was on the left ﬂank
of the Americans, where an exposed position was held by an
Indiana regiment. Here the enemy obtained a temporary

; advantage; and, rushing in overwhelming numbers along

the mountain, they prepared to form in the _rear of the
Americans. At this critical moment, when the hearts of the
bravest trembled for the result, Gen Taylor arrived at the
threatened point, and ordered a Mississippi and a Kentucky
regiment to keep the enemy in check. On their success de-
pended the issue of the battle; and well did they deserve

- the city and the surrounding plains with rows of frowning

cannon. Scott’s summons to surrender having been declined
by the Mexican commander, atremend_ous ﬁre Was opened
from Well—planted land batteries, as Well as from an Ameri-
can vﬂeet under Commodore Conner. The bombardment

‘Was continued with effect till March 26th, when the castle

and city surrendered, with 5,000 men, 400 pieces of artillery,
and avast quantity of public stores. Appointing Wo1't.l1
governor of Vera Cruz, Gen. Scott prepared to march into
the interior of the country. The American ﬂeet proceeded
to take possession of ‘several neighboring ports on the Gulf.
No injury to the person or property of private citizens was
allowed. The harbors Were opened to the commerce of all
nations, and a tariff’ of duties on imports was established for
the beneﬁt of the American government. '

573. On the 8th of April, the advanced guard of the inva-
ding army, under Gen. Twiggs, set out from Vera Cruz in
the direction of the Mexican capital ; the commander—in-
chief soon follovvedvvith his main body. In both divisions
there were about 8,500 men. For ﬁfteen miles on the road
to J alapa [/act/blah’-pa/L], they encountered no resistance;
but as. they ‘approached the Cordilleras [cor-deal-yii’-ras], they
learned that the rocky pass of Cerro Gordo [thc‘z7"—7‘0‘ gar’-do]
had been strongly fortiﬁed, and was held by Santa Anna
with 12,000 men. To dislodge an enemy superior in num-

‘ bers from the commanding heights of this mountain-pass,

required the best efforts of courage, energy, and military
science. But one of the great captains of the age Was be-=
fore it, to Whom no enterprise that promised glory and
proﬁt to his country seemed impossible. Constructing a new
road over steep ascents and rocky chasms, he fell upon the

enemy in an unexpected quarter. Their determined resist-

ance availed nothing before the bayonets of their assailants,
and soon the flag of Mexico gave place to the stars and

the castle of San Juan de Ulloa. Give an account of the bombardment of Vera Cruz.

stripes. The rout was complete. Santa Anna, who had
shortly before declared that he would die ﬁghting rather than
that the Americans should tread the imperial city of the
Aztecs (Mexico), attempted to escape in his travelling car»
riage, but ﬁnally, for the sake of greater speed, took to a
mule, leaving to his pursuers his private papers and wooden
leg. This latter trophy, dressed in a boot of exquisite work-
manship, was afterwards exhibited in the United States. The
Mexican loss at Oerro Gordo Was 1,000 men in killed and
wounded, 3,000 prisoners (including ﬁve generals), and 43
pieces of artillery. The total loss on the part of the Ameri-
cans was 431. p A

574. The day after the battle (April 19th), the-victorious
army entered Jalapa. Continuing their march with all haste,
they took without resistance the strong castle of Perote [pd-
7'0’-td] on a peak of the Cordilleras. On the 15th of May,
they entered the ancient city of Puebla [1900-ci’-blah], inhabit-
ed by 80,000 souls. As the triumphant army marched into
the city, the people with eager curiosity gazed upon them
from windows and house-tops; but no showy uniform, like
that of their own troops, adorned the Americans, and they
turned awayin disappointment, declaring that it must be
their “ gray-headed leaders” that had gained their victories.
At Puebla Gen. Scott remained till further attempts at" ne~
gotiation were made ; but the Mexicans were not yet satis-
ﬁed ; and, having received reinforcements, he garrisoned the
city, and on the 7th of August resumed his march for the
capital with upwards of 10,000 men.

575. The route of the Americans lay through an elevated
table-land, described as one of the most delightful regions in
the world. It led them at length by successive ascents to

adventurous army of Cortez three centuries before, they
looked down upon a magniﬁcent landscape of mountains and
valleys, lakes and cities, embosoming in the far distance the
proud city of the Montezumas. Without resistance, they
continued their advance‘ to within ﬁfteen miles of the capital.

- There, and in strong advanced forts, which defended it on

all sides, the Mexicans had rallied for a ﬁnal stand. The
city itself was favorably situated for defence, in the midst of
a marsh (in Cortez’ time a lake), connected with the adjacent
land by long causeways commanded by artillery. But Gen.
Scott was now, as he‘ had proved himself at all other times,
equal to the occasion.

Leaving the Vera Cruz road, Scott turned to the south;
and, with the aid of skilful engineers, leading his army over
rocks and chasms which the enemy had considered impassa-
ble, he reached San Antonio, on the Acapulco [ah-kah-p00l’-
co] road, eight miles from Mexico. Against this strong and
Well-garrisoned place Gen. Worth was sent, while the divi-
sions of Generals Pillow and Twiggs, embracing the brigades
of Pierce (since president of the United States), Cadwalla-

. Churubusco [choc-740-boos’-co] still lay between the invading

army and the capital. Towards sunset on the 19th of Au-
gust, Gen. Shields succeeded in taking the village of Ansalda
[aim-sahl’-dab], and thus cut off communication between the
camp at Contreras and Santa Anna’s army. A rainy night
rendered the condition of the American soldiers comfortless
in the extreme. About midnight they were summoned to
arms, Gen. Persifer F. Smith having conceived the bold de-

” sign of surprising Contreras. The darkness was so intense

that the men had to touch each other as they marched, to

avoid being separated. They reached the ground by sun»
rise, stormed the Mexican camp, and took it in a quarter of
an hour, making prisoners of 818 men.

This was the ﬁrst ‘victory gained on the memorable 20th
of August, 1847. The same day, Gen. Worth drove the
garrison of San Antonio from their defences, and then, oined
by Pillow, with equal success stormed a stronghold on the
heights of Churubusco. Gen. Twiggs captured another of
the defences on the heights, and Churubusco surrendered.
Meanwhile Shields and Pierce had kept Santa Anna and his
reserve from coming to the aid of their countrymen, and
ﬁnally, _after maintaining their ground for hours With steady
cdu1'age against overwhelming numbers, drove them from
the ﬁeld. Thus were ﬁve separate victories gained in a
single, day. A force of 82,000 Mexicans was completely
broken up, with the loss of 7,000 men, by an army of not
much more than one-fourth of their number. The Ameri-
cans during this trying day had 139 killed and 876 wounded.

576. Before humbling the Mexicans by entering their cap-=
ital as a victor, Gren. Scott gave them an opportunityof treat-
ing, but his overtures were again rejected. On the 8th of
September, Gen. Wo1'th was ordered to storm Molino del
Rey [mo-Ze’-no del M] (the king’s mill),-the site of a large
foundry, at which the church-bells of the city were being
cast into cannon, Wo1*th encountered an army of nearly
14,000 Mexicans, whom he defeated after a hard-fought bat-
tle. This position being carried, the precipitous heights of
Chapultepec [chem-pool’-tr?-pelt], crowned by an almost im-
pregnable castle, lay next in the path of the invading army;

but the indomitable valor of the Americans, led on one side .

by Pillow and Cadwallader and on the other by Quitman,
again proved triumphant, and on the 13th of September the
American flag was planted on “the monarch fortiﬁcation of

Scott at Puebla, under the charge of Col. Childs and a small
garrison. The Mexicans embraced the opportunity to be»

adequate means of defence, made a most gallant resistance;
and, by dint of almost superhuman exertions on the part of

after they were joined by Santa Anna with several thousands
of his fugitive troops from the capital. Fortunately, Gen.

. 578. In June, 1846, Col. Kearney [lccoﬂ-726] (soon made
general) started from Fort‘ Leavenworth with 1,000 men,
constituting “the army of the west”, to reduce the northern
provinces of the enemy, and make his way to the Paciﬁc.
A march of 900 miles brought him to Santa Fe [fit], the
capital of New Mexico, the army that had occupied it ﬂeeing

_on his approach. Having organized a government and gar-

risoned Santa Fé, Kearney continued his march. He had
not gone far when he was met byiKit Carson, the famous
hunter and guide of the Rocky Mountains, with the intelli-
gence that California, which constituted the northwestern
part of Mexico, was already conquered by Commodore
Stockton and Col. Fre’-mont. We must go back, to relate
the circumstances. , . _  ,

Fremont had been sent..o11t by government in 1842 with a
small party to explore the Rocky Mountain region. _ On the
15th of August, he reached the highest ridge of that great
chain, and beheld before him a snow-crowned -peakswhich
towered high above the surroundinglieminences. It was de-
termined to ascend to its summit and plant the,American
ﬂag higher than it had ever waved before. Leaving their
mules, the little party clambered up the precipitous side of
the mountain, holding on by its jagged projections. At
length their leader reached the top. He stood on adizzy
crest but three feet wide, a sheer precipice of 500 feet yawn-
ing before him. Each man having ascended in turn, the
American ﬂag was fastened to a ramrod ﬁxed in a crevice
of the summit, and_ left unfurled to the mountain breeze.

Fremont, having accomplished the object of his ‘mission,
was again sent out in 1845, to explore the great basin of the

‘Salt Lake, California, and Oregon. Having passed the win-

solved to erect California into a_separate government. Call-
ing together the people, pa1'tic'ularly the American settlers in
the valleyof the Sacramento, he set before them the condi-
tion of the country, and recommended them to declare their
independence. This was done on the 5th of July, 1846. Skir-
mishes ensued with} different bodies of S Mexicans. While
. pursuing one of i these, Fremont was informed that Commo-
dore Stockton had taken Monterey, on the Paciﬁc coast, with
a U.'S. ﬂeet. Immediately laying aside the flag of independ-
ent California, which bore a bear for its device, he raised the
colors of the United States in its stead, and joined Commo-
dore Stockton. By their united forces the seat of govern-
ment and other places were soon afterwards taken. 6

men, and took part in the battle of San Gabriel [ga/2’-bra-el]
(January 8th, 1847), Which completed the establishment of
American power in California. Never before was so exten-
sive a country subjugated by so small a force.

580. Soon after Kearney left Santa Fe, Col. Doniphan by
his command set out with nearly 1,000 Missourians for the
country of the Navajo [nah-vctw’-/to] Indians, from whom.
hostilities Were apprehended. They were induced to make
a treaty of peace; and Doniphan then turned to the south-
east, traversed extensive deserts, in which his men nearly
sunk from want of food and Water, defeated an army of
Mexicans more than four times aslarge as his own, entered
the city of Chihuahua [c/Le-who;/L’_-w/m/L], and took formal
possession of the province of which it was the capital, in the
name of the United States. Towards the close of May, he
effected a’ junction with Gen. Wool at Saltillo; and shortly
afterwards, the time of his men having expired, he led them
back to New Orleans. They had marched 5,000 miles, and

encountered adventures and hardships which seemed almost

like the inventions of romance.

581. After his defeat by Gen. Lane, Santa Anna, deserted_
by his troops, ﬂed to the coast and thence to the West In-

dies. The Americans being everywhere victorious, the Mex-
ican government no longer refused to come to terms. On
the 2nd of February, 1848, a treaty was signed at Guada-
loupe Hidalgo [gwa/L-olah-loo.’-pd lie-dct/Ll’-go]; by which
Mexico relinquished to the United States the territory be-
tween the Nueces and Rio Grande, together with the whole
of New Mexico and California; the United States agree-
ing on its part to pay for this extensive region $15,000,000,
and to assume debtsdue from Mexico to American citizens

‘ to'the amount of $3,500,000. This treatyhaving been rati-

ﬁed by both governments, peace was proclaimed by Presi-

582. California, from the time of its conquest, increased
rapidly in population, numerous emigrants ﬁnding their way
thither from the other side of the Rocky Mountains. In
March, 1848, when it Was formally ceded to the U. S.-, it was
estimated to contain 33,000 inhabitants. The following June,
a discovery was made, which produced momentous changes
in the condition of California, and made itself felt through-
out the world. A laborer in the employ of Captain Sutter,
a Swiss who had settled in the valley of the Sacramento,
found in the sand some glittering particles, which turned out
to be gold. Similar discoveries were soon made in other
places in the neighborhood. An excitement which trans-
cends description seized on the inhabitants ; forsaking their
farms and shutting up their houses, they ﬂocked to the for-
tunate spot. The news soon reached the Atlantic States.
Hundreds at once set out for the land of gold ; and not from
the United States only, but from all parts of Europe, and

even from far-distant China, did the tide of immigration ﬂow,
men of every grade in society giving themselves up to its
current. Within two years from the date of the discovery,
San Francisco -had grown from an insigniﬁcant village of a
few miserable huts to a flourishing city containing 15,000
souls. Hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of the pre-
cious metal have been dug from the earth, nor is the hidden
treasure yet exhausted. ,

e 583. On the 23rd of February, 1848, ex-president John
Quincy Adams, who from 1831 had served his native state
in the house of representatives, died of paralysis, with which
he had been struck two days before while in his seat attend-
ing to his oﬂicial duties. His dying words were, “ This is the
last of earth! I am content I” A life devoted almost wholly
to the service of his country gave him strong claims on her
gratitude, and the highest honors were paid to his memory.

584. Wisconsin, which had been formed into .a territory

in 1836, was admitted into the Union as a state in 1848.
In March, 1849, Minnesota Territory was organized.

585. The probability that the war with Mexico would re-

sult in ‘the acquisition of extensive territory on the south-.

west, early led to a re-agitation of the slavery question. In
1846, David Wilinot, of Pennsylvania, introduced ‘into Con-
gress a proposition, called-from him the Wilinot Proviso,
that slavery should be prohibited in all territory that might
be acquired by treaty. This proviso failed to receive the

sanction of Congress; and, the question being thrown be-.

fore the country for discussion, a party holding the views

~ advocated by Mr. Wilmot was organized. They took the

name of Free Soilers, and in June, 1848, nominated Martin

.Van Buren as their candidate for the presidency. The dem-

CHAPTER XIV.

ADMINISTRATION on TAYLOR AND FILLMORE, 1849-1853.‘

586. ZACHARY TAYLOR was born in Virginia on the 24th
of November, 17 84. The followingyear his father emigra-

ted to Kentucky, and his youth Was passed amid the dan-

gers an_d privations of frontier life. He Was brought up a
farmer, but in 1808 gave up this vocation for a military life,
having received a commission in the army from President
Jefferson. The war of 1812 brought him into active service,
and he distinguished himself in the northwest, particularly
in the defence of Fort Harrison against the Indians. His
services in the Seminole War and subsequently in Mexico
have been already noticed. . '

_ Millard Fillmore was born in 1800 in Cayuga county,
N. Y. He Was apprenticed in early life to a Wool-carder;
but _his superior talents attracted the attention of a promi-
nent lawyer of Cayuga, in whose oﬂice he commenced in
1819 a course of legal study. On being admitted to the
practice of law, he rapidly rose to distinction. After serv-
ing in the legislature and in Congress, he ran in 1844 for the
office of governor of New York, but Was defeated. Stand-
ing high in the conﬁdence of the Whigs, he Was placed _on
the same ticket with Taylor, and with him took the oath of

587. Gen. Taylor appointed John M. Clayton, of Dela-
ware, "secretary of state. Hewas the first president Whose
cabinet contained a -Secretary of the Interior. This new
department was created just before the close of Polk’s term,
to relieve the secretary of the treasury and his subordinates
of some of their multifarious duties.

588. So rapidly did California increase in population that
in 1849 its people took measures for admission into the Union
as a state, and adopted a constitution with a clause prohibit-
ing slavery. The introduction of their petition into the
thirty-ﬁrst Congress kindled an intense excitement and con—
vulsed the Whole country. Part of the territory in question
was south of the dividing line established by the Missouri
Compromise, and southern senators declared that the pro-
hibition of slavery therewould be followed by the immedi-
ate dissolution of the Union. Other questions arose to ,
complicate this main issue, and it seemed as if human wi’s—
dom would be incompetent to settle the momentous points
in dispute satisfactorily to the conﬂicting interests concerned.
Never since its formation was the Union in such danger.
At this crisis, When every friend of his country trembled for
the result, Henry Clay, again appearing. as a peacemaker
between excited -sections, brought before the senate a series
of resolutions covering the Whole ground at issue. With all
that glowing eloquence which placed him among the great-
est of modern orators, he urged the necessity of mutual con-
cession and compromise, and called on extreme men on both
sides to forbear from overthrowing the glorious fabric which
had been cemented by the blood of their fathers.

A committee of thirteen, of which Mr. Clay was chairman,
was ﬁnally appointed to consider the Whole subject. In May,
1850, this committee presented an elaborate report, which, in
the spirit of Clay’s resolutions, recommended anact that set--

Omnibus Bill, as it was called, were as follows :-1. That,
according to agreement made when Texas Was annexed, new
states not exceeding four should be formed out of her terri-
tory, to be admitted with or Without slavery as they might
choose. 2. That California should be admitted as a free
state. 3. That territorial governments should be established
for New Mexico and Utah, Without any stipulation on the
subject of slavery. 4. That Texas should give up its claim to
the territory of New Mexico, in consideration of $10,000,000
to be paid her from the federal treasury. 5. That a more
efficient law should be passed for the recovery of fugitive
slaves. 6. That the slave-trade should be prohibited in the
District of Columbia under heavy penalties. Such was the
bill Which as a Whole Was urged upon Congress by the united
voice of the committee. To its discussion the summer of
1850 was mainly devoted.

589. In the midst of the excitement just described died
one of the great men of the nation, John C. Calhoun. ‘Born
in South Carolina in 17 82, he was sent to Congress in 1811,
and from that time till his decease served in various public

stations, distinguished no less for his unselﬁsh and incorrupt-'

ible patriotism than for his close and lucid reasoning. _From
the close of Tyler’s term he had represented his native state
in the senate, Where he was regarded as the most formidable
champion of state rights and southern interests. His death,
Which took place at Washington on the 31st of March, 1850,

 60. THE discovery of America, the most important event
of modern times, next demands our attention. On this
subject we have conﬂicting and uncertain accounts. Ac
cording to Welsli historians, the Atlantic was ﬁrst crossed
in 1170, A. D., by Ma’-doc, a prince and hero of Wales; but
the Norwegians, on stronger evidence, claim this honor for
oI1e of their adventurous sea-kings. In the ninth century,
both Iceland and Greenland were discovered and colonized
by Scandinavian navigators; and about the year 1000 A. 1).,
if we may believe Ice-land’-ic manuscripts, a vessel driven by
storms southwest of Greenland arrived at the continent of
America. If this be true, it was no doubtthe barren shore
of Labrador that was reached; and so unimportant Was the
discovery considered that it was soon forgotten.

61. In -the ﬁfteenth century, nothing was known in Europe
of a continent beyond the ocean. The mariner’s compass,
invented in 1302, had enabled the sailor to push out more
boldly from land; yet even the Por’-tu-guese, then the most

people claim it on better grounds? What discoveries did the Norwegians make in the
ninth century? What do the Icelandic manuscripts say? If this be true, what part of
the coast was probably reached ? 61. What is said of navigation in the ﬁfteenth century?

Public business was suspended, and eulogies were pronounced
upon him by leading statesmen of all parties. By his decease
Fillmore became president; and,the former cabinet having
resigned, Daniel Webster was appointed secretary of state.

-S ’ 591. The Omnibus Bill having been thoroughly discussed,
its provisions Were separately agreed to, the Fugitive Slave
Law, which was the last to receive the assent of Congress,
passing on the 18th of September. Mr. Fillmore, who had
earnestly striven to restore harmony, gladly afﬁxed his signa-
ture to the bill. The countryrwas once more at peace. Clay
had achieved his last and greatest triumph.

592. California thus entered the Union as the thirty-ﬁrst
state. Of the new territories organized by the Omnibus Bill,
New Mexico, which was inhabited chieﬂy by Spaniards and
Indians, contained at this time 61,525 free whites. Utah
embraced a vast region between the Rocky Mountains and
California, extending from New Mexico on the south to Or-
egon on the north. The Mormons, on leaving Illinois, select-
ed it as the seat of the empire to which they believed them-
selves destined. Near the G1'e,at Salt Lake, at an elevation
of 4,300 feet above the leveliliof the sea, they founded a
magniﬁcent capital, with streets eight rods in width and
ﬁne dwellings surrounded by delightful gardens. Brigham
Young, one of their elders, was appointed governor of Utah
by Mr. Fillmore. i i ‘

593. About the commencement of Gen. Taylor’s term, the
island of'Cuba became an object of general interest. Some
adventurous spirits", believing that its annexation would be
advantageous to the U. S. and that its inhabitants only wait-
ed for an opportunity to throw off the Spanish yoke, pre-
pared to make an armed descent on this lovely “queen of the
Antilles,” now nearly all that remained to Spain of her. grand

armed expedition was secretly organized under General
Lo’-pez. Six hundred men, havingjeluded the U. S. author-=
ities, sailed for the island and effected a landing at Cardenas
[car’-dd-nus] on the 19th of May, 1850. They took the
place, but ﬁnding that neither the Cubans nor any of ‘ the
Spanish troops were disposed to join them, as had been rep-.

resented, they deemed it best to reembark, and made their

way to Key West, Florida, closely pursued by a Spanish
war-steamer. The following year, the excitement was re-
newed. Lopez organized another company of 480 men,
with which he succeeded in getting off from New Orleans
and landed on the northern coast of Cuba. The Spanish
authorities were not unprepared to receive him, 40,000
troops having been concentrated on the island. Lopez was
attacked and defeated; his army was dispersed, and he
himself, with a numberof his followers, was executed at Ha-
vana. . , ~

, 594. Great anxiety was felt at this time, both in England

r and the United States, respecting the fate of Sir John Frank-

lin, an English navigator who had sailed in the spring of 1845

to explore the Arctic seas and ﬁnd a northern passage to the

Paciﬁc. No tidings having been received of his party, it was
feared that they might be suffering for want of succor. Sev-+
eral expeditions were sent in search of the missing navigators,
one of which, ﬁtted out by Henry Grrinnell, a N. Y. merchant,
at his own-expense, started for the North in May, 1850, un-
der- Lieut. De Haven, of the U. S. navy. The search was
prosecuted for more than a year, but neither Sir John Frank-
lin nor the long-sought passage round America on the North
was discovered. Another expedition, undertaken for the
same humane purpose bythe U. S. government in connec-
tion with Mr. Grrinnell, left New York in May, 1853, under

595. In 185 2,iAmierica was bereaved of two of her greatest
men, Henry Clay and Daniel Webster‘. Clay was born in
1777 in Virginia, near a region known as the Slashes, whence
in political campaigns he was often called ‘fthe mill-boy of
the Slashes”. He was admitted to the Richmond bar at the
age of twenty, and soon afterwards removed to Lexington,
Kentucky, Where he practiced with eminent success. In
1806, he was sent to the U. S. senate; and both in that body
and inall the public stations he was called to occupy, he
proved himself a practical statesman of liberal views and far-
reaching sagacity. On three separate occasions he was the
means of settling complicated questions which threatened
the very existence of the Union. In private life no man was
more beloved; and when on the 28th of June, 1852, it was
announced that Henry Clay was no more, tears burst from
many an eye unused to weeping.—Webste1', another man of
giant intellect and the author of some of the ﬁnest state pa»
pers on record, died at Marshﬁeld, Mass, on the 24th of Oc-
tober, in the same year. Born in New Hampshire in 17 82,
he was sent to Congress at the age of thirty-one ;. and from
that time much of his life was devoted to the public service.
“I still live,” he said, as anxious friends pressed round his
dying bed: they were his last words. His memory, with
that of his illustrious compeers Clay and Calhoun, will ever
be kept green. A -

ited by Louis Kossuth [760-shoot’], who arrived at New York
in the preceding December. Kossuth had attempted, with
many of his countrymen, to establishthe independence of
Hungary; but, defeated in his efforts by the combined ar-
mies of Austria and Russia, he had been compelled to seek.

safety in ﬂight. His object in visiting the United States
was to obtain aid for further eiforts in behalf of Hungarian
independence. This he succeeded in obtaining to a consid-
erable extent from private individuals; but ‘government,
though it sympathizedwith his cause, refused to depart from
its long-established policy of not interfering in the affairs of
foreign nations. ‘

597. A temporary difficulty with Great Britain occurred
in the summer of 1852. American citizens enjoyed, by trea-
ty, the right of ﬁshing on the Banks of Newfoundland, ex-
cept within three miles of shore. In the caseof bays, the
British cons’trued this clause to mean within three miles of a
line drawn from headland to headland ; while the Americans
claimed the right of entering within headlands provided they
kept three miles from shore. Both parties sent ships of-war
tothe Banks to enforce their views, but happily the question
was soon settled by negotiation. ‘

598. The attempts that had been made on Cuba rendered
France and England anxious lest the United States should
seek to annex that island to her domain. They accordingly
asked her to unite with them in a “tripartite treaty”, by
which each power should disclaim all intention of seizing
upon Cuba, and guarantee its possession to Spain. This
called forth a masterly reply from Edward Everett, of Mas»
sachusetts, who since Webste1"s decease had held the office
of secretary of state. In rejecting the proposal, Mr’. Everett
took occasion to set forth the Monroe doctrinein the strong-
est terms, declaring that, while the United States had no
intention of violating her good faith towards Spain, she did
not recognize in any European power the right of interfering
in questions that were purely American. .

CHAPTER xv.

,PIERCE’S ADMINISTRATION, 1 85 3-1 85 7.

600. A NATIVE of Hillsborough, New Hampshire, and a
graduate of Bowdoin College, Franklin Pierce commenced
life as a lawyer. ‘Having become a successful practitioner,
he was sent to the legislature of his native state, and thence
to the lower house of Congress. In 1837, he was elected
to the U. S. senate, being then but thirty—three years of age.
After ﬁve years’ service in this body, he returned to private
life. The commencement of hostilities in Mexico called him
into the field as a volunteer. He received from President
Polk a commission as brigadier-general, and conducted him-
self creditably in several of the most trying battles fought
during . the advance upon Mexico.—-Mr. King, the vice-
president, was one of the senators ﬁrst elected by Alabama
in 1819, and had retained his seat ever since by successive
elections except for four years, during which he had been
U. S. minister at the French court. Declining health led
him to visit Cuba «early in 1853, and on that island he took
the oath of oiﬁce as vice-president. , His recovery proving
hopeless, he returned to Alabama, where he died April 18th,
1853.—William L. Marcy, of New York, became secretary
of state under the new administration. P

601. Shortiy after his inauguration, Gen. Pierce was called
to take part in the opening ceremonies of an “ exhibition of
the industry of all nations”, or Wo1'ld’s Fair. England had
set the example in 1851 by erecting a magnificent building,
and inviting the different nations to contribute specimens of

their inventions, manufactures, agricultural products, and
works of art. A similar enterprise was projected in the
United States. ‘A Crystal Palace, the frame of which was
composed exclusively of iron and glass, was constructed by
a stock company in the city of New York, ﬁlled with the

choicest products of foreign and domestic labor, and opened’
to the public on the 14th of July, 1853. Thousands visited
it, from all parts of the country; and, though in a pecuniary a

point of view the enterprise was unsuccessful, it had a most
happy effect on the industrial interests of the new world, by

, producing a spirit of generous emulation, and diffusing cora-

rect‘ ideas" of the advance of art and industry abroad.
602. Difficulties with several foreign nations occurred early
in Pierce’s administration. The first of these was with Mex-

ico, and grew out of the incorrectness of the ma.ps on which

the treaty with that country had been based. The boundary
of the territory ceded to the United States thus became a
matter of -“question ; and Santa Anna, whom another revolu-4
tion had placed at the head of affairs, proceeded to occupy
the disputed district. ‘Nar was averted by negotiation, and
the separating line between the two countries was clearly
deﬁned.——About the same time, a diplomatic question arose
with Austria. Martin Koszta [k0z’-tab], a Hungarian who
had been concerned in the revolution of 1848, had taken
refuge in the United States, and formally declared his inten-=
tion of becoming an American citizen. Having occasion to
‘visit Smyrna, on the Mediterranean coast, he placed himself
under the protection of the U. S. consul, but was seized by
a lawless band and carried on board of an Austrian ship to
answer for his previous conduct. Just at this time, Captain
Ingraham, of the Americansloop-of-war St. Louis, fortunate-
ly arrived in port. After investigating the case, and satisfy--
ing himself that Koszta was entitled to the protection of his
government, he demanded his surrender, which was obtained,

but not till he had threatened the Austrian Vessel with at-
tack. Koszta was placed under the care of the French con-
sul, till the United States and Austria should dispose of the
question. A correspondence ensued, which resulted in the
release of Koszta and his return to the United States. His
life was probably saved by the decided course of Capt. In-
graham, to whom a sword wasvoted by Congress in ac-
knowledgment of his gallantry. '

603. During Pierce’s administration, important commer-
cial relations were opened with Japan. An, expedition to
this distant empire, whose jealousy of foreigners had kept it
comparatively shut out from all nations, had been projected
by Fillmore; and a squadron was sent thither under Com-
modore Perry, a son of the honored naval hero before men-
tioned. In the summer of 1853, Perry entered the Bay of
J eddo, his steamers being the ﬁrst that ever ﬂoated on the
waters of Japan. The authorities, amazed at such boldness,
warned the Americans to depart, but their order was disre-
garded. A Japanese oﬂicer then made his appearance; to
whom the desire of the United States to make a treaty with

I hisgovernment for purposes of traffic, was duly unfolded.

The subject was referred to the emperor, who appointed the
14th of July for a further conference. On that day, the com-
modore, with an imposing company of ofﬁcers and marines,
landed and delivered the letter of the president. He was
received with great -pomp, and informed that an answer
would bereturned the following spring. In March, 1854,
the desired treaty was signed. The ‘privilege of trading
with Japan was secured to the merchants of the United
States, and two ports of entry were appropriated totheir use.

604.’ The most exciting question that arose during Pierce’s
term related to the territorial organization of an extensive
tract reaching from the western boundary of Missouri, Iowa,
and Minnesota, to the Rocky Mountains, and from below the

‘Arkansas River to British America. Though assigned in

part to the Indianswho had been removed from the other
side of the Mississippi, this tract had not escaped the tide of
civilized emigration from the east; and the thirty-third
Congress, which commenced its first session in December,
1853, was called upon to provide a government for the thou-
sands of pioneers who were clearing its forests and settling
its fertile plains. The whole of this region had been ob—
tained from France in 1808, as part of the Louisiana pur-
chase; and, lying north of latitude 369 30’, it was cut oﬁ°
from slavery by the Missouri Compromise. In January,
1854, Senator Douglas presented a bill for the organization
of this region into. two new territories to be known as Kan-
sas and Nebraska, with the proviso that the Missouri Com-
promise should not apply to them, inasmuch as it had been
superseded by the compromise measures of 1850. The ques-

did an exciting question arise during Pierce‘s term? To whom had this district been
in part assigned? Who had found their Way thither? What was the thirty-third Con-
gress called on to do? How had this region been obtained? How was it cut oﬁ‘ from
slavery? What was the substance of a bill presented by Senator Douglas in January,

tion of slavery or freedom Mr. Douglas proposed to leave
its occupants to decide, when they should seek admission into
the Union as sovereign states. No sooner was this bill
brought forward than all the stormy scenes of former years
of agitation were renewed. The country was again rent,
and sections were arrayed against each other with embit-
teredfeelings. The doctrine of “Popular Sovereignty”, as
it is called, was violently denounced, particularly in the
Eastern States; but all efforts to defeat Mr. Douglas’s bill
failed ; and in May, 1854, having passed both houses of Con—
gress and received the president’s signature, it became a law.

605. The doctrine of “popular sovereignty” having been
thus endorsed and settled, the men of the,East and of the
South both strove to encourage emigration, that, when ad-»
mitted as a state, Kansas might have a majority of settlers
in favor of their respective views. The —Massachusetts»legis-
lature incorporated a company called “ The Emigrants’—Aid
Society”, which during 1855 sent out 1300 persons. Slavery
men also hastened thither; and between these two classes of
immigrants conﬂicting opinions soon engendered bitter hos-=
tility. The ﬁrst election in Kansas was held in November,
1854, for a delegate to Congress; it resulted, like others,
held in 1855, in the triumph of the pro-slavery party. A
legislature elected by the latter proceeded to draw up a code
of laws for the government of the territory; but the free-
state men, declaring that the election had been controlled by
parties who had crossed from Missouri for the purpose and
were not residents of the state, called a new convention.
This body assembled at To-pe’-ka, and drew up a constitu-

tion under which state oﬂicers and a new legislature were

elected. Thus there were two sets of authorities, each claim»
ing to be lawfully chosen. Civil war was the result. Out-
rages of every kind were committed, and neither life nor
property was safe. Peace was not restored till the president,

on the 3rd of September, 1856, issued an order for the sup-
pression of disturbances, and appointed John W. Geary, of
Pennsylvania, governor of Kansas, with full military powers
for the accomplishment of this object. With Grov.'Geary’s
arrival the war ceased, and order was gradually restored.
606. In the summer of 1856, it was proposed by an enter-
prising company to connect Europe and America with a sub-
marine telegraph, by means of a wire sunk in the ocean.
Communication having been thus established between New
foundland and Nova,Scotia, surveys were made with the
view of extending the line to the southwestern point of Ire-
land. The scheme was reported perfectlypracticable, the
line proposed being 1,600 miles long, and extending over a
comparatively level surface at the bottom of the sea, in no
part more than 2% miles in depth. In November, a contract
was made for the necessary quantity of gutta-percha cable
inclosing the telegraph wire ; and it is supposed that this vast
enterprise, the latest and crowning triumph of human inge-
nuity, will be successfully carried through before the close
of 1857. ' ~
A 607. After the death of the great party leaders already
noticed, the old dividing line between whigs and democrats
gradually became less and less distinct; and, as new issues
arose, new parties were formed. In, 1853, the “ Know-
nothings”, or “ Americans”, ﬁrst appeared in the ﬁeld, their
cardinal principle being opposition to foreign influence, and
their motto that America should be ruled by Americans.
This order rapidly spread, and in 1854 they were successful
in most of the state elections. »Many of the whigs joined
them ; while others, uniting with the free-soil democrats, or-
ganized a new party under the name of “Republicans”. Three
candidates thus appeared in the ﬁeld at the presidential elec-
tion of 1856. The democrats, who were in favor of letting
slavery extend wherever it found its wayby the voice of the

enterprising navigators in the world, had gone no further
than the A-zores’ on the west, and the equator on the south.
It was reserved for the great genius of Christopher Colum-
bus, amid discouragements of every kind, to add a new con-
tinent to the civilized world.

62. Columbus was born at Genoa jen’-0-a] about 1435.
His father was a wool-comber, but gave his son advantages
of education, particularly in geography, mathematics, and
astronomy, for which he early displayed a decided taste. At
fourteen, he went to sea. A few years later, in the service
of a kinsman who commanded a small Grenoese squadron, he
took part in an engagement with some Venetian [ve-ne’-shcm]
vessels off the coast of Portugal. His ship caught ﬁre, and
Columbus, leaping into the waves, barely saved his life by
swimming ashore. The fame that Portugal had won by her
maritime enterprise attracted him to Lisbon [Ziz’-6072]; and
there he married the daughter of an eminent navigator,
whose charts and journals awakened within him an ardent
thirst for discovery. ’ From this time to 1477, we ﬁnd him
engaged in various voyages to Madeira [ma-dd’-m], the Ca-
na’-ries, the Azores, the coast of Guinea and Iceland.

63. The geographical researches of Columbus had con-
vinced him that the earth was round, and that land would
be found in the west to counterbalance the eastern conti-
nent. The maps of the day gave little information respect-
ing the extent of Asia; and Columbus imagined that it
stretched much further east than it really did, or that large
islands lined its coast, but a few hundred leagues west of
Europe. Many circumstances conﬁrmed him in this belief.
Pieces of wood strangely carved had been picked up by
those who had ventured into the unknown ocean. Trees
torn up by the roots were often driven by West winds on
the Azores; and upon one island of this group had been

people, nominated James Buchanan, of Pennsylvania; the
republicans and a section of the American party supported
John C. Fremont, of California; the rest of the Americans
voted for ex-president Fillmore, of New York. The cam-
paign, which was a most exciting one, resulted in the election
of Mr. Buchanan to the presidency, and John C. Brecken»
ridge, of Kentucky, his fellow-candidate on the democratic
ticket, as vice-president.

608. Mr. Buchanan Was born April 13th, 1791, in Frank-
lin County, Pennsylvania. He was educated for the law, and
began his public career in the legislature of his native state
at the age of’ twenty-three. In 1821 he Was elected to the
house of representatives. He continued a member of that
body till 1831, when he Was appointed minister to Russia by
President Jackson. , On his return, he was sent to the U. S.
senate, Where he retained his seat till President Polk invited
him into his cabinet as secretary of state. In 1853, he was

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES.

IT may not be uninteresting in conclusion to glance at the
present condition of our country, its growth in population,
and its advance in art, science, and internal improvements.

The ﬁrst census was taken in 1790; at which time the
whole population was found to be 3,929,827. In 1850 it had
increased to 23,191,876. Our commerce has expanded at a
still more surprising rate, our exports in the same space of
time having increased from twenty to two hundred millions
of dollars. In 1855, 2,030 vessels were built inthe U. S.,
being double the number constructed in 1845.

To the United States belongs the honor not only of ﬁrst
employing steam as a motive-powier in boats, but also of ﬁrst
using it in ships for ocean navigation. The ﬁrst steamer
that ever crossed the Atlantic was the Savannah, launched
at New York in 1818. She proceeded to Savannah, made
her way safely to Europe in 1819, and visited various ports,
in all of which she was an object of general interest. N ot-

»withstanding the success of this experiment, it was not till

1838 that a regular line of steamers commenced crossing the
Atlantic. Previous to that time, sailing packets alone were
used, and the average length of a trip from Liverpool to
New York was thirty-three days, the shortest time ever
made being twenty-two. The ﬁrst trip of the British steamer
Great Western (April, 1838) was performed in fourteen days;
and since then, by successive improvements, the running time
in favorable weather has been reduced to eleven, and even
less than ten, days. U. S. ship-builders have produced some
of the ﬁnest models aﬂoat ; in no department of industry have
our enterprising mechanics been more successful. A

The first railroad in the United States was completed in
1827. ‘Since then, the work of internal improvement has
been prosecuted so vigorously that iron roads thread the
Union in every. direction and bind together its principal
cities and towns. In 1854, over 21,000 miles of railroad

were in operation, and 17,000 were in process of construc-
tion. A company has been formed for the purpose of build-
ing a road from the Atlantic to the Paciﬁc; and there is no
doubt, that, in spite of the vast difﬁculties to be encoun-

’ tered, this gigantic enterprise will ﬁnally be carried through.

In no country is labor so highly respected and so well re-
munerated as in the U. S.; and in none, therefore, are the
working classes so happy, and we may add enlightened. , No
restrictions are laid on industry; political privileges are ex-
tended to all; and the humblest citizen may raiseihimself to
the proudest position in the republic. A ,Our mechanics have
brought a high degree of ingenuityras well as skill to their
work; and through their means America has become justly
famous for her inventions and improvements. Among a host
of things that might be mentioned, it is undeniable that the
best locks, life—boats, printing-presses, and agricultural imple-

nunciations of religion, against immorality and crime”. That
she may succeed in thus making her institutions eternal is

the rank of a science. The proper'and thorough use of these books
places it in the power of every pupil to become an accomplished reader.

The selections Will be found to contain some of the ﬁnest gems in the

language, which cannot ‘fail of interesting the pupil, and cultivate 9
literary taste. ‘ ’ ‘

THE FIRST AND SECOND ‘READERS introduce successively the different
parts of speech, and are designed to combine a knowledge of their
grammatical functions With the meaning and pronunciation of Words.

THE THIRD AND FOURTH READERS commence With a series of exercises
on articulation and modulation, containing numerous examples for
practice on the elementary sounds (including errors to be corrected)
and on the different movements of the voice produced by sentential
structure, by emphasis, and by the passions. y

THE COURSE OE READING comprises three parts: the ﬁrst part. con-

taining a more elaborate description of elementary sounds and of the T

parts of speech grammatically considered, than Was deemed necessary
in the preceding Works; part second, a complete classiﬁcationand
description of every sentence to be found in the English, or in any
other language; part tkircl, paragraphs; or sentences in their conneo
tion unfolding general thoughts, as in the common reading-books.

The ELEMENTs OF READING AND ORATORY closes the series with an
exhibition of the Whole theory and art of Elocution exclusive of ges-
ture. It contains, besides the classiﬁcation of sentences, the laws oi
punctuation and delivery deduced f1,-omviit,Athe.Whole followed by
aarefullv’ selected pieces for sentential analysis and vocal practice.

RECOMMENDATIONS OF MANDEVILLE’S SERIES OF READERS

That the series is eminently practical and highly approved is shown.
by the following testimonials, selected from the thousands that have
been received from public educators, who have. -tested them by thorough
examination or actual use.

From WALTER BAILEY, Supt. Public Schools, Fowrth District, New Orleans,
May 24th, 1852.

“I have examined, with much care and interest, Professor Mandeville’s series oi
Readers, and am much gratiﬁed to observe that he has reduced‘ the subject of punctua-
tion and delivery to a complete system; and they possess such superior advantages
over any others that I have ever examined, that I have adopted them as text-books in
the public schools under my supervision."

*,,,* In July, 1852, Mandevil1e’s Reading books were adopted and introduced in all

the Public Schools of New Orleans.

The ’ following Resolution was unanimously adopted by the Board of Education
of St. Louis, October, 1‘lth, 1852.

Resolved, That Professor Mandeville’s Series of Readers be substitutedas textbooks

for Swan°s Readers in the Public Schools of this city.”
From the late S. L. HOLMES, City Superintendent of Schools, Broohlg/n.
“Mandeville’s Reading Books are used in all of the Public Schools of Brooklyn, and
with great satisfaction and proﬁt, both to teacher and pupil. As mere reading books
they are probably unsurpassed either in matter or system; but as a means of disclosing

the true structure of our language, and pointing out the proper mode of parsing it, this

series is believed to be altogether unequalled”

Puor. MANDnvILLn’s Lnc'rUnEs.—“ The Committee to whom was intrusted the
preparation of an expression of the sentiments of the Teachers of the Public, Ward,
Corporate‘ and Private Schools of the City of New York, who have attended Prof.

Mandevi1le’s Lectures *" his course on Elocution, respectfully report the following

resolutions :

“Resolved, That _..e course of Lectures on Elocution, by Prof. Mandeville, which '

we have attended, has been to us a source of much gratiﬁcation and proﬁt.

“Resolved, That his system, based upon sound Philosophical principles, is an easy,
progressive, natural, and eminently original method of attaining a knowledge of the
classiﬁcation and structure of every kind of sentence in the English language, with it
appropriate punctuation and delivery; and we are happy to say unhesitatingly, that
our opinion, his course, if faithfully carriedout by teachers as he recommends, is better

calculated to make good readers than any other with which we have been acquainted.” _

Zhefollowiug is signed by all the Principles of the Syracuse Public Schools,
ewcept one.

“ We, the undersigned, Principals of Public Schools in the City of Syracuse, having
formed some acquaintance with Mandeville’s System of Reading and Oratory, take
occasion cheerfully to express our unfeigned approval and admiration of the same, as
the only truly Scientiﬁc System known to us, and our belief that its universal introduc
tie into the Public Schools of our country, would prove a very valuable accession to
it present educational facilities.”

“ In no Way is a graceful and reﬁned style of speech so naturally
formed as by poetic language made thoroughly familiar to the young.
‘I do not like poetry; I cannot ‘understand it,’ often say half-taught
children. Give them the poetry of good Writers, With a litt.e necessary
comment, and you will remove all obscurity from the most instructive

this in the following collection,and I trust that While it exhibits ‘ only

In the preparation of this Work for the use of children, the authoresa
has drawn her materials from the most reliable sources, and incorporated
them into a narrative at once unostentatious, perspicuous, and graphic,
aiming to be understood by those for Whom shewrote, and to impress
deeply and permanently on their minds the liistorical facts contained
in the book. The entire Work is clothed in a style at once pleasing and

comprehensible to the juvenile mind.

-' The author of’ this work has been very successful in her style of narration, as Well

. as gone to the best sources accessible for her facts. While there is nothing light and

trivial inher manner, there is all the vivacity of the most lively ﬁreside story-teller;
and those things, “of which it is .a shame to speak,” she gets over with great judgment,
delicacy and tact. V While it is eminently a child’s book, We greatly misjudge if it
should not prove a favorite with adults, especially that class who cannot command time
to read protracted histories.”—0hm3stian Mirror. —

' This Work is designed to impart to young people a more clear and
understandable knowledge of Grecian history than is attainable through
any of the numerous Works on that subject that have been accumulate
ing during the last century. By selecting and presenting clearly and
concisely only prominent characters and events, and not overloading
and rendering their perusal irksome by a mass of minor details, the
authoress has rendered an essential service to the youth of our country;

4 “ Miss Sewell is eminently successful in this attempt to set forth the history of Greece
in a manner suited to the instructlon of the young. The chronology is lucid, the events
are well selected, and the narrative is perspicuous and simple. The facts and the me
thod of presenting them are taken mainly from the Work of Bishop Thirlwall, an ex-
cellent authority, and the Work as a whole is the best with which We are acquainted
for the use of children in their lessons of Grecian History, Whether in the school-room

The ‘present Manuals of Greek and Roman Antiquities are far supe-

public. A principal Review of Germany says of the Roman Manual:
‘Small as the compass of it is, we may conﬁdentlyaﬂirm that it is a
great improvement on all preceding works of the kind. We no longer
meet with the wretched old method, in which subjects essentially dis-
tinct are herded together, and connected subjects disconnected, but
have a simple, systematic arrangement, by which the reader readily
receives a clear representation of Roman life. We no longer stumble
against countless errors in detail, which, though long ago assailed and
extirpated by Neibuhr and others, have found their last place of refuge
in our manuals.” A

1484] HIS APPLICATIONS FOR AID. 45

Washed the bodies of two men, totally different in appear-
ance from the natives of Europe and Africa.

64. Firm in his opinion, Columbus nextsought the means
of testing its truth. He must have men and ships. His first
proposals, made to the senate of his ‘native city, were reject-
ed. His next application was to John II., of Portugal;
who, after drawing out his plans, treacherously sent ‘a vessel
on the proposed course under another commander, but hap-
pily gained nothing by his baseness. Disgusted with this
treatment, Columbus sent his brother Bartholomew to Hen-
ry VII., of England. Bartholomew was captured by pirates,
and it was years before he reached London. The English
monarch listened to him with favor, and would probably
have become the patron of Columbus had he not previously
found one in another quarter.

65. After his disappointment in Portugal, 1484, Columbus
went to Spain. Destitute and friendless, he obtained an
humble living for himself and his son Diego [dc-Ea’-go] by
making charts and maps. At last he succeeded in procuring
an interview with Ferdinand, king of Ar’-ra-gon. This cau-
tious monarch, after listening to his projects, submitted them
to the learned men of the University of Sal-a—man’-ca, by
whom they were once more condemned.

66. After years of trial, Columbus ﬁnally obtained an in-
terview with Isabella, the wife of Ferdinand and queen of
Castile [cas-teel’] and Leon [ld’-on]. To enable him to ap-
pear at court, she sent him a_small sum of money (about
$70), with which he procured a mule and suitable clothing.
The queen, though moved by his arguments, was dissuaded
from furnishing the required aid." More disheartened than
ever, Columbus was on the point of abandoning Spain, When

this belief? 64. To test this opinion, what did he need? To Whom were his first pro-
posals made? With what success? To Whom did he next apply? What was there-
sult? To whom did he then send his brother? What happened to Bartholomew?
65. After his disappointment in Portugal, where did Columbus go? How did he sup-
port himself? With whom did he ﬁnally obtain an interview ? What was the result?
66. After years of trial, who manifested an interest in the plans of Columbus? How
was be enabled to appear at court? What was the result of this interview? What
prevented Columbus from abandoning Spain? What dignity was conferred on him?

A. DIGESTOF THE LAWS, CUSTOMS, MANNERS AND

. BY THOMAS DEW.
Late Presiclent of the College of William and Mary.

1 Vol. 8vo. 662 pages. Price $2 00.

On examination, it Will be found that more than ordinary labor has
been expended upon this Work, and that the author has proceeded upon
higher principles, and has had higher aims in view than historical com-
pilers ordinarily propose to themselves. "Instead of being a mere cata-
logue of events. chronologically arranged, it is a careful, laborious, and
instructive digest of the laws, customs, manners, institutions, and civi
lization of the ancient and modern nations. -

The department of modern history in parti-e1ila1° has been prepared
with unusual care and industry.
From J our: J. OWEN, Professor in New York Free Academy.

“ I have examined with much pleasure Prof. DeW’s ‘Digest of the Laws, Manners,
Customs, disc, of Ancient and Modern Nations.’ ‘It furnishes a desideratum in the
study of history Which I have long desired to see. The manner in which history is
generally studied in our institutions of learning, is, in myjudgment, very defective.
The great central points or epochs of history are not made to stand ‘out with sufficient
prominence. Events oi‘ minor importance are made to embarrass the memory by the
confused method of their presentationto the mind; history is studied by pages and not
by subjects. In the Wilderness of events through which the student is groping his Way,
he soon becomes lost and perplexed. The past is as obscure as the future. His lesson
soon becomes an irksome task. The memory is Wearied with the monotonous task oi
striving to retain the multitudinous events of each daily lesson. A

“This evil appears to be remedied in a great degree by Prof. Dew‘s admirable ar-
rangement. Around the great points of history he has grouped those of subordinate
importance. Each section is introduced by a caption, in vvhichthe subject is brieﬂy
stated, and so as to be easily remembered. Thus the student having mastered the lead-
ing events, will ﬁnd little or no difficulty in treasuring up the minor points in their
order and connection. I trust the book will be adopted in our higher institutions of
learning. I greatly prefer it to any history for the use of schools which I have seen.”

“With the severest logic, and a power of analysis that is Well nigh matchless, he
unites the most perspicuous and exact style, expressing the nicest shades of thought,
with undeviating accuracy. And his Writings display remarkable erudition as well as
discrimination; he shows himself perfectly familiar with the theories and arguments of
all who have gone before him, whether in earlier or later days; and while he renders
due honor to each, he knows no such thing as being in bondage to a great name.”-—»

A rules, arranged on a new and simple plan. ’Directions for the use of

capital letters follow. Next come rules, explanations and examples,
for the purpose of enabling the pupil to form and spell correctly such
derivative Words as /caving, debarring, pinning, and the like, Which are
not to be found in ordinary dictionaries, and regarding which the pupil
is apt to be led astray by the fact that a change is made in the primi-
tive Word before the addition of the suffix. This done, the scholar is
prepared to express thoughts in his own language, and is now re-
quired to Write sentences of every kind, a Word being given to suggest

an idea for each ; he is taught to vary them by means of different ara ~

rangements and modes of expression; to analyze compound sentences
into simple ones, and to combine simple ones into compound. Several
lessons are then devoted to Style. The essential properties, purity,
propriety, precision, clearness, strength, harmony, and unity, arenext
treated, examples for correction being presented under each. The
diﬁ'erent kinds of composition follow; and, specimens having been
ﬁrst given, the pupil is required to compose successively letters, de-
scriptions, narrations, biographical sketches, essays, and argumenta-
tive. discourses. After this, the principal ﬁgures receive attention;
and the Work closes With a list of subjects carefully selected, arranged
under their proper heads, and in such a Way that the increase in dif=-
ficulty is very gradual. The Work has received the universal app1°civ_el
of Teachers and the Press throughout the Union.

of _an eminently successful Teacher, and will be found to possess many
peculiar merits. '

it a regular meetinglof the Board of Education of Roc7zester,helol June 18, 1858,
the following resolution was unanimously adopted .'

“Resolved, That Oove‘ll’s Digest of English Grammar be substituted for Wells’
Grammar, as a Text-Book in the public schools of this city, to take effect at the com-
mencement of the next school year.”

Esctract from the Minutes of a Regular Meeting of the Board of Education of
Troy, May 31st, 1853. ’

“Mr. Jones, from Committee on text-books, and school libraries, moved, that Bul-
Eien’s English Grammar be stricken from the list of text-books, and Covel1’s be substi-
tuted. -—Passed.”

From fo-rty--fear Teachers of Public Schools, Pittsbu/rg, Pa.

‘ “The undersigned have examined ‘ Covell’s Digest of English Grammar,’ and are 0:
opinion that in the justness of its general views, the excellence of its style, the brevity, ac-
curacy, and perspicuity of its deﬁnitions and rules, the numerous examples and illustra-
tions, the adaption of its synthetical exercises, the simplicity of its method of analysis,
and in the plan of its arrangement, this Work surpasses any other grammar now before
the public; and that in all respects it is most admirably adapted to the use of schools
and academics.”

Wrom all the Teachers of Public Schools of the iC’ity of Alleghauy, Pa.

We, the undersigned, Teachers of Allegheny city, having carefully examined Mr.
G: .ell’s Digest of English Grammar,’ and impartially compared it With other gram-
me’ A new in use, are fully satisﬁed that, While it is in no respect inferior to others, it is
in very many respects much superior. While it possesses all that is necessary for the ad-
” snced student, and much that is not found in other grammars, it is so simpliﬁed as to
- dept it to the capacity of the youngest learner. We are conﬁdent that much time and
eibor will be saved, and greater improvement secured to our pupils in the study of this
eience, by its introduction into our schools; nence we earnestly recommend to the Board:
>2? Directors of this city, its adoption as a uniform text-book upon this science in the
schools under their direction.”

From JOHN _J. WOLCOTT,  M., Pr. a/nolp Supt. 9th Ward School, Pittsburg, Pa.

“ ‘ Covell’s Digest of English Grammar’ not only evinces the most unceasing labor, the
most extensive research, the most unrelaxing effort, and the most devoted self-sacriﬁcing
study of its author, but it is the most complete, the most perfect, and, to me, the most
satisfactory exposition of English Grammar that has come to my notice. It appears to

- me that every youth aspiring to become master of the English language, from the rudi-

mental principles to the full, round, beautiful, faultless, perfect period. will make this vol

came his ‘ vade mecum.’ "

EXPOSITION OF THE GRAMMATICAL STRUCJTURE OF

THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
BY-JOHN MULLIGAN,7 A. M.
Large 12mo. 574 pages. $1 50

This work is a comprehensive and complete system 0 English
Grammar, embracing not only all that has been developed by the later
philologists, but also the results of ‘years of study and research on the
part of its author. One great advantage of this book is its admirable
arrangement.’ ‘ Instead of proceeding at once to the dry detailswhich
are distasteful and discouraging to the pupil, Mr. M. commences by
viewing the sentence as a whole, analyzing it into its proper parts, and
exhibiting their connection; and, after having thus parsed the sentence
logically, proceeds to consider the individual words that compose it, in
all their grammatical relations. This is the natural order; and expe
rie.nce proves that the arrangement here _followed not only imparts
additional interest to the subject, but gives the pupil a much clearer
insight into it, and greatly facilitates his progress.

From Da. JAMES W. Axatsrznnn.

‘ “I thank you for the opportunity of perusing your work on the structure of tne.

English language. It strikes me as being one of the most valuable contributions to this
important branch of literature. The mode of investigation is so unlike what appears
in our ordinary compilations, the reasoning is so sound, and the results are so satisfac-
tory and so conformable to the genius and great authorities of our mother tongue, that
I propose to recur to it again and again.”

Ewmact from aletterfrom E. O. BENEDICT, Esq., iPreaz'dent of the Board ofEduca-
-tion of the 0z'tg/ of New York. '

“I have often thought our language needed some war}: in which the principles of _

. grammatical science and of the structure of the language, philosophically considered,‘

were developed and appli_ed.to inﬂuence and control the aims and consuedo of Horace
and Quintilian, which seem to me to have been too often the principal source of sole«
eisms, irregularity and corruption. In this point of view, 1 consider your work a valu~
able and appropriate addition to the works’ on the language."

From WM. Henson Wnnsrnn, President of the Free Academy, New York. V

"The exposition of the grammatical structure of the English language by Professor
Mulligan, of this city, is a work, in my opinion, of great merit, and well calculated to
impart a thorough and critical knowledge of the grammar of the English lsngnage.

“No earnest English student can fail to profit by the study or this treatise, yea it it

as to introduce the reader gradually and easily to studies of this kind.
Comparatively little speculation is presented, and those literary monu-

manner. In the subsequent pages, more frequent and sustained efforts
are made to arouse reﬂection, both by occasional remarks on the rela-

founded. The characteristics of the most celebrated modern Works are

analyzed at considerable length..

at last, by the advice of Wiser counsellors, Isabella deter-
mined to embark in the enterprise, even if she had to pledge
her jewels to raise the necessary funds. Columbus was com-
missioned as High Admiral and Viceroy of all the countries
he might discover, and hastened to Palos [pa/L’-'Z0s] to ﬁt
out the expedition.

There Was great diﬁiculty in ﬁnding sailors for such a voy-
age ; but, With the aid of the queen, three vessels and ninety
men were obtained." The ships Were very small, none of
them being over 100 tons burden. The Santa Maria 
7'6’-co], Which bore the flag of Columbus, was the only one
that had a deck. Two brothers by the name of Pin’—zon
commanded the Pin’-ta and the Nina [ne’-mt]. Provisions
Were laid in for a year. The Whole expense of the outﬁt

BY EDWARD D. YOUMANS.
12mo. 840 Pages. Price '7 5 Cents.

Every pagevof this book bears evidence of the author’s superiel
ability of perfectly conforming his style to the capacity of youth; This
is a merit rarely possessed by the authors of scientiﬁc school-books,
and will be appreciated by every discriminating teacher. It is espe
cially commended by the eminently practical manner in which each

subject is presented. Its illustrations are drawn largely from the phca

nomena of daily experience, and the interest of the pupil is speedily
awakened by the consideration that Chemistry is not a matter belong-
ing exclusively to physicians" and professors.

From Paor. WM. H. BIGELOW, Princvipal of Olinton Street Acaelemy.

“The emincntlypractical character of the Class-Book treating of the familiar ap-
plications of the science, is in my opinion its chief excellence, and giveslt a value far
superior to any other work now before the public.”

From DAVID SYME, A. M;, formerly Principal of the .ZlIathematz'cal Department,
and Lecturer in Natural Philosophy, Ohemistry and Physiology, in Oolumbia C’ol.

“ MR. YoUMANs: DEAR SIR,—I have carefully examined your Class-Book on Chem-
istry, and, in my opinion, it is better adapted for use in schools and academics than any
other work on the subject that has fallen under my observation. e _

“I hope that the success of your Class-Book will be proportionate to its merits, and
that your efforts to diffuse the knowledge of Chemistry will be duly appreciated by the
friends of education.”

Chemistry which in every respect pleases us so much as thls.”——C'om. Ad/cert/leer. _

This volume,-Which is Well adapted to the Wants of schools and
academics, has been prepared from the “Principles of Physiology,
by Comings and Comstock, and is brought out in its present form at
the urgent request , of numerous friends of education who have highly
commended that Work, which was found too expensive for general use
in the school-room.

It Will be found to explain and illustrate fully and clearly as many
principles of physiology as can be expected in a Work of its limit.
That human physiology can be made more easy of comprehension, more

- proﬁtable, and more attractive to the beginner of the study, by appro~

priat_e references to the comparative physiology of the inferior animals,
than by any other method, is an established fact in the mind of the
author, which he has made eminently available in the preparation oi
this Work, thus giving to this Work peculiar claims to the attention of
teachers.

‘ counter seized on the sailors; and their fears gradually in-

creased, till, on the expiration of twenty days without any
signs of land, they began to talk of throwing their com-
mander overboard and returning home. The variation of
the compass had not yet been discovered, and their alarm
was therefore greatly heightened when they observed that
the magnetic needle no longer pointed directly north. It
was a trying hour for Columbus, but his great mind was
equal to the crisis. Explaining the variation of the compass
in a manner satisfactory to his followers though not to him-
self, he used every means to induce them to prosecute the

voyage, now picturing to their minds the riches they would
obtain. and now threatening them with the anger of their

sovereign. At length both oﬂficers and men insisted on re-
turning, and Columbus was obliged to promise that unless
land appeared within three days he would comply with their
demand. The shallowness of the water, the numerous birds
in the air, the grass and weeds ﬂoating by, a branch that
was picked up with berries still fresh upon -it, all made him
sure that he could give this promise with safety. ‘

68. on the evening of October 11th, the sails were furled,
and a close watch was kept. At ten o’clock, a moving light
was discerned in the distance by Columbus and several
others. At two in the morning, a shout from the Pinta an-
nounced the discovery of land. Dawn displayed to the over—
joyed adventurers a scene of Strange beauty. The land was
covered with forests, and gay with the foliage and ﬂowers
of ‘a’ tropical clime. The natives thronged from the woods
to gaze at the ships, which with their white sails they re-
garded as huge birds hovering over the sea.

aimed to be simple, that youth of lower aswell as advanced classes may
understand him ; clear, that no indistinct or erroneous impressions may
be conveyed; accurate in the recital of facts; and .z'nte7_-estz'ng as regards
both matter and style. Avoiding fragmentary statements, he has gone
into detail sufﬁciently to show events in their connections, convinced K,
that a fairer idea of them is thus imparted, and that facts otherwise dryfy 
may in this way be made attractive and indelibly impressed‘ on the mindf; ' 
He ‘has tried throughout to be fair and national. He has neither intro-

the country in the name of the king and queen of Spain,
his followers rendered him homage as viceroy, and the in-
habitants, regarding the Spaniards as a superior race, pros-
trated themselves at his feet. The land thus reached was
one of the Bahama [ba-lac?’-ma] Islands; It was called by the
Indians Cruanahani [gwa/L-nah-ha/z’-me], but received from
Columbus the name of San Salvador, by which it is still
known.

Learning from the natives that gold was found further to
the south, Columbus soon sailed in that direction, and dis-
covered Cu’ -ba, and His—pan-i-o’—la, since called by its original
Indian name Haiti [77-ta]. One of his vessels having been
wrecked, he left 35 of his men as a colony on Hispaniola,
and on the 1st of January, 1493, set sail for Spain. A vio»
lent storm on the return voyage threatened his frail vessels
with destruction; and Columbus, fearing that his discoveries
would be lost to the world, wrote an account of them on
parchment, secured it in a cask, and threw it into the sea, in
the hope that it would reach the shore in safety. The storm,
however, abated; and, after being ﬁrst driven to Lisbon,
the shattered vessels ﬁnally entered the port "of Palos, amid
the acclamations of the people and the thunder of cannon.
Columbus hastened to the king and queen, la.id before them
the history of his discoveries, presented specimen products
of the new world, showed them the natives whom he had
brought with him, and in return was loaded with the high»
est honors. C

70. On the 25th of September, 1493, Columbus sailed

 again, from Ca’-diz, with 17 vessels and 1,500 men. On ar~

riving at Hispaniola, he found thathis colony had been cut
off. The injustice and cruelty with which they had treated
the unoffending natives had provoked the latter, gentle and
friendly as they Were, .to summary vengeance. After pro-
viding for the erection of a fort, Columbus proceeded to

Soon after. completing this work, he was . ﬁlled with delight
by the arrival of his brother Bartholomew, whom he had not
seen for 13 years, and whom, returning from his mission to
England after his brother had sailed the second time, Isa-
bella had sent to the new world with supplies.

Tired of hardship and disappointed in the hope of obtain-
ing gold, the followers of Columbus now began to murmur.
I-Iis management of aﬁ'airs was complained of, and an e1nis-
sary of his enemies was sent out to examine into it. Colum-
bus deemed it proper to return to Spain and plead his own
cause before the throne. He established his innocence be-
yond dispute, and was once more received into favor.

71. In 1498, Columbus undertook a third voyage. Di-
recting his course more towards the equator than he had
previously done, he discovered Trin-i-dad’ and the South
American coast near the mouth of the O-ri-no’-co. He was
for a time in great danger on account of the rush of waters
from the mouth of this great. river, _and judged aright that
so mighty a stream could belong only to a continent. On his
return to Hispaiiiola, he set about regulating the affairs of
the colony, but was interrupted in the work by the arrival
of Bovadilla [60-vcacleel’-3/ca], whom, at the instigation of ene-
mies, the Spanish sovereigns had invested with powers to
examine into his conduct, and, if needful, supersede him in
the command. Columbus was sent back to Spain in chains.
The master of the vessel, indignant that the great discoverer
should be treated so unworthily, offered to take off his fet-
ters; but Columbus, grieved at the ingratitude of those he
had faithfully served, refused to have them removed, took
them with him wherever he went, and ordered that they
should be placed with him in his cofﬁn. He triumphantly
repelled every charge, but his sovereigns never had the jus-

tice to restore him to his station. They put him off on dif
ferent pretextsg and, when it became necessary to remove
Bovadilla on account of his mismanagement, O-van’-do was
appointed his successor.

7 2. Though cut to the heart by this ingratitude, and be-
ginning to feel the inﬁrmities of age, Columbus in 1502 set
out on a fourth voyage. He still believed that the land he
had discovered formed part of Asia, and did not live to have
the delusion dispelled. The object of this last voyage was
to ﬁnd a passage to India by pushing further westward than
he had yet been. He explored the coast for a considerable
distance along the Gulf of Darien; but at last, after a suc-
cession of disasters, in the attempt to return to Hispaniola
he was wrecked on the coast of Jamaica. ' Reduced to the

verge of starvation, and in danger of attack from the In»-

dians, Columbus saved himself and his men by an ingenious
device. From his acquaintance with astronomy, he knew
that an eclipse of the moon was about to take place; and,
on the morning of the day, summoning the natives around
him, he informed them that the Great Spirit Was displeased
because they had not treated the Spaniards better, and that
he would shroud his face from them that night. When the
moon became dark, the Indians, convinced of the truth of
his words, hastened to him with plentiful supplies, praying
that he would beseech the Great Spirit to receive them again
into favor. After undergoing extraordinary hardships, Co-
lumbus ﬁnally succeeded in reaching Hispaniola, and in the
summer of 1504 he landed once more in Spain. I

Columbus was tall, well-formed, and muscular. His coun-
tenance bore an ‘air of authority, and his demeanor was
grave and digniﬁed. He was distinguished by a vivid im-
agination, lofty enthusiasm, high moral worth, great inven-
tive genius, and a steadfastness of purpose which overcame
all difﬁculties. ' i

74. Meanwhile, encouraged by the success of Columbus,
other Spanish navigators had found their way to the new
world. Among these was Ojeda [0-/zé’-clcth]. Following the
course taken by Columbus in his second voyage, he touched
on the South American coast, without, however, making any
important discovery. In Ojeda’s company was a well-edu-
cated Florentine gentleman named Amerigo Vespucci [0c—mci’-
re-go ves-19006’-she], who published an interesting description
of the lands he had visited. This was the ﬁrst written ac-
count of the new world; and, as it left Columbus out of
view, the Weste1'n Continent, instead of being called after its
real discoverer, was unjustly styled, from the name of this
Florentine, AMERICA.

7 5. English Dz'sc0vem'es.———In the latter part of the ﬁfteenth
century, England was laid waste by civil wars, known in his-
tory as the Wa.1's of the Roses. As soon as they ended,
commerce began to receive attention. Adventures to the
new world promised large proﬁts; and Henry VII., wishing
to secure his share, commissioned John Ca-bot’, a Venetian
merchant of Bristol, to sail on a voyage of discovery and take
possession of all new lands in the name of England. On the
24th of June, 1497, before Columbus had yet seen the main-

enterprise, he brought back to King Henry three savages,
and two turkeys, the first specimens of this bird ever seen in
Europe.

Soon after the return of John Cabot, Sebastian, his son,
set sail with 300 men, for the purpose of discovering a north-
west passage to China. The icebergs of the northern ocean
compelled him to turn from 
his course; and visiting various
points as far south as Albemarle
Sound, he took possession of the

crossed the Atlantic to avoid the delays of the coast voyage,

and thus by accident discovered Brazil in the year 1500. .

He took possession of it in behalf of Portugal, and erected a
cross which is still preserved. The next ‘year, Cortereal
coasted Labrador with the View of ﬁnding a northwest pas-

at discovery till 1524. In that year, Verrazzani, a Floren-

tine commissioned by the enterprising Francis I., explored

the coast of North Carolina, Delaware, New Jersey, and
Rhode Island, and opened a trafﬁc with the Indians, who
showed a friendly disposition. He called the whole country
New France, a name afterwards conﬁned to Can’-a-da.

78. James Cartier [car-te-c3’], in 1534, 1535, made two
voyages to the northern part of the continent under a com-
mission from the French government. In the former of these
he explored the Gulf, and in the latter the River, St. Law-
rence, which received their names from him. Passing up
the river to the principal Indian settlement, Hochelaga [ho-
s/ze-lah’-gct], he was struck with the ﬁneness of the situation,
and gave the place the name of Mont Réal [mong_7~ci’-al]
royal moemtomz, afterwards written as one word, Montreal
[mom-ﬁre-cm0l’]. Most of his men died of scurvy. The In-
dians treated him kindly, but he repaid them by carrying
their chief a prisoner to France.

79. In 1540, Lord Roberval [ro-bare-val’] was appointed
viceroy of New France, and sailed thither for the purpose of
colonizing the country; but the severity of the climate and
other difficulties led him to abandon the idea. A body of
Hu'—gue-nots, or French Protestants, subsequently settled on
Port Royal, an island off the coast of South Carolina, and
another party ﬁxed their abode on the St. John’s River, in
Florida [see Map, p. 151]. The former, after suffering much
from hunger and disease, returned to France. The latter
were attacked by the Spaniards of St. Augustine [aw-gua
teen’] and mostly massacred, the few survivors being incor-
porated among their conquerors. I y

Bay of Fun’-dy. De Monts [dz] m0ng’], who planted this
colony, explored the coast as far south as Cape God. In
1608, the ﬁrst permanent settlement in Canada was made by
Champlain [sham-pZcme’], who founded Que-bec’ and after-
wards discovered the lake still called by his name. Wliile
exploring the country, he defeated the Iroquois, who then
for the ﬁrst time heard the thunder and saw the strange ﬁre
of the Frenchmen’s guns. Nor were the French, in turn,
less dismayed by the barbarity with which the savages L01‘-=
tured their prisoners and tore the scalps from dying and dead.

81. Spanish Discovem'es.—To Spain belongs the honor,
not only of discovering America, but also of penetrating to
the Paciﬁc, and thus proving that the new world formed a
separate and independent continent.

After the death of Columbus, Ferdinand divided the
Spanish possessions in America into two governments, one
of which extended to the Gulf of Darien. Ojeda Was sent
out to colonize this southern region, to convert the natives,
and extend the dominion of Spain.’ The Indians resisted;
the diseases of the climate proved fatal to the Spaniards;
and most of the colonists perished. The few that survived
founded a feeble settlement at Santa Maria el Antigua [el
om-te’-goo-a/L], and chose Vasco Nunez de.Balboa [valﬁ-slco
noon’-3/cith dd bal-60’-ah] for their commander. Among
these colonists was Pizarro [foe-2&7“-ro], afterwards cele-
brated as the conqueror of Peru.

In 1513, Balboa subdued some of the neighboring tribes
and required them to pay a tribute. One day two of his
officers quarrelled about the division of some gold dust they
had received. A native chief, who was present, threw the
dust from the scales in derision, and told them that if they
were so fond of gold he could conduct them to a country

where the commonest vessels were made of it. At the
same time he informed them of a great ocean, which lay at
a distance of six days’ journey towards the south. Balboa’s
curiosity was excited, and he determined to test the truth
of these statements. To encourage adventurers to join him,
he sent presents of gold to Cuba; but only 190 men could
be raised- A perilous march was commenced. Instead of
six days, they. wandered for twenty-ﬁve days through woods
and over mountains. Heat and disease had almost over-
come the weary and discouraged party, when the Indian
guides announced that from the top of the next mountain
the great ocean could be seen. When most of the ascent
was completed, Balboa ordered his men to halt, and toiled
on to the summit alone. Reaching the top, he beheld the
mighty Paciﬁc, and falling on his knees thanked God for
leading him safely to this great discovery. He went down
to the shore, and, advancing with sword and buckler till the
water reached his waist, took possession of the ocean in the
name of the king his master, and vowed to defend it with
his arms. Four years afterwards, Balboa was executed by

, order of Pedrarias [pd-clmh’-rre—cts], who had superseded

him as governor of Darien, professedly for treason, but real-
ly" on account of the jealousy inspired by his success.

82. Florida was ﬁrst visited by Ponce de Leon [pan/-25/ad
dd Z55’-on] in 1512, and received its name from the day on
which it was discovered, Easter Sunday, called in Spanish
pascua ﬂoricla [pa/L’-scoo-a/z ﬂow’-e-cla/L]. Delighted with
its profusion of foliage and ﬂowers, he thought that its luxu-
riant woods must contain the fabled fountain which would
restore old age to the vigor of youth. After vainly trying
to discover these precious waters, he attempted to plant a
colony, but was attacked by Indians, lost a number of his
men, and was himself mortally wounded with an arrow.

ited the coast of South Carolina in search of slaves. Hav-
ing enticed a crowd of natives on board l1is ships, he sailed
for Haiti. One of his vessels foundered at sea, and on the
other so many died that the adventure was unproﬁtable.
Five years afterwards, under a commission from Charles V.,,
Vasquez attempted to conquer the country. His largest
shipwas stranded, and his men were killed by the natives
near the place where their former treachery had been com»
mitted.

84. In 1528, De Narvaez [clfz mar"-not/"L—dzf/z] landed in Flor-
ida under a commission to conquer the country. ,The na-=
tives allured him into the interior with stories of gold, but
he found nothing to reward his trouble. After wandering
nearly six months to no purpose, he returned to the sea,
constructed some rude barks, and sailed for Cuba. A storm
wrecked his boats near the mouth of the Mississippi, and
only four of the party, after incredible hardships, succeeded
in reaching their countrymen. , ,

85.» Ferdinand de Soto [dd so’-to], who had distinguished

himself in the invasion of Peru, next attempted the conquest-

of Florida and the exploration of the interior. Landing at
Tam’-pa Bay with 600 chosen men clad in complete armor,
he marched boldly into the wilderness, in search of gold and
slaves. The little army tool: with them a forge with which
to make new weapons when they were needed, and a drove
of hogs which supported themselves by feedingin the woods,
Though avarice was their ruling passion, De Soto and his
men carefully observed every ceremony of their church.
For sixteen months, they wandered over the territory now
comprised in Alabama and Greorgia, misled by their captive
guides, worn out with hardships, and disappointed in their
hopes. The Indians whom they met were generally peace-
able and unoﬁbnding. Without any provocation, the Span»
iards treated them with the greatest cruelty, exacting what»

ever they wanted, requiring them to carry their baggage,
and on the slightest suspicion setting ﬁre to their villages,
cutting off their hands, throwing them to bloodhounds, or

burning them alive. In the fall of 1540, the invaders found .

themselves on the site now occupied by the city of Mobile

[mo-?)eel’]. Extravagant demands were here made upon the

Indians; they resisted, and a battle ensued in which 2,500
natives and 18 Spaniards were killed.

Making his way northward, De Soto, with his men now
reduced to 56, spent a cheerless winter on the Yaz’-oo River.
Wishing to continue his march in the spring, he demanded
of the Chickasaws 20 men to carry his baggage ; but, in»
stead of complying, they set ﬁre by night to their wigwams,
which the Spaniards had seized upon and occupied. Eleven
of their party were thus burned alive. Most of the baggage
was consumed, and many horses and hogs perished in the
ﬂames.

Their iosses having been repaired as far as possible, the
Spanish army moved to the west. Seven days brought them
to the Mississippi, then (1541) y for the ﬁrst time seen by Eu-
ropeans. They were kindly received by the Indians, who
crossed the river in multitudes, bringing their visitors ﬁsh
and loaves made of persimmons. A month was spent in
crossing, and then De Soto, hearing of a rich. country in the
northwest, started in that direction. On the route, a tribe
of Indians offered to worship the Spaniards as “children of
the sun”, and brought them those that were blind to be re-
stored to sight. “ Pray only to God" who is in Heaven, for
what ye need”, was De Soto’s reply.

There was yet no gold, and not only the men but their
leader were breaking down under long continued fatigue. At
length they found their way to the country of the Natchez.
This warlike tribe they tried to frighten into supplying what
they needed. The Natchez chief, however, questioned the

In these they descended the Mississippi, and about half the
original number finally reached the MeX__ican coast in safety.

86. It has been mentioned that a party of French Hugue-
nots had settled in Florida. Philip II., remembering that
possession had been taken of the country in the name of the
Spanish crown, resolved to drive them out, and in 1565 com-
missioned Melendez [md-Zcn’-ddth] for that purpose. Me-
lendez undertook to subjugate the country in three years, to
plant a colony, and to introduce the sugar-cane. He reached
Florida o11 St. Augustine’s [aw-,6/us-tecnz’] day, and gave the
name of that saint to the river up which he sailed, and the
town that he founded on its bank [see Map,p. 151]. This
Was the ﬁrst permanent settlement Within the present limits
of the United States, being more than forty years older than
-any other. _

Ribeault [re-60'], the , French commander, immediately
prepared to attack the Spaniards, but a storm Wrecked his
vessels and left him entirely at their mercy. Melendez was
not long in taking advantage of his helplessness. Leading
a strong force by land against the French fort, he took it,
and caused a general massacre of all it contained, including
even Women and children, old and sick, declaring that he
killed them, “ not as Frenchmen but as Lutherans”.

This Wanton cruelty Was not to go unavenged. _ De
Grourgues [old g007"g’], a brave adventurer of Grascony, ﬁtted
out three ships with the aid of his friends, for the express
purpose of punishing the murderers. He succeeded in sur-
prising the Spanish settlement, and ‘hanged his prisoners on

trees, placing over them the inscription, “I do not this as

unto Spaniards or mariners, but as unto traitors, robbers, and
murderers”. A
Too weak to maintain his position, De Grourgues returned

to France, and the Whole country Was left under the domin-

CONQUEST _OF MEXICO AND PERU.—-‘VOYAGE OF MAGELLAN.

87. GRIJALVA [gm-hahl’-ow], on a visit to the Mexican
coast in 1517, ﬁrst heard of a‘ rich empire in the interior
under the dominion of Montezuma [mom-56-200’-ma], Vela»
squez [ed-la/2,’-skdth], then governor of Cuba, resolved to at»
tempt its conquest, and selected Fernando Oortez as com»
mander of the expedition. W Cortez was a man of great energy
and courage, though unprincipled, rapacious, and cruel.
Devoting all his powers to the enterprise, he soon raised 61’?
men, 16 of whom were mounted. Fire-arms had not at this
period come into general use, and only thirteen muskets and
ten small ﬁeld-pieces could be procured. The arms of the
greater part consisted of cross—bows, swords, and spears.
Thus prepared, Oortez landed where Vera Cruz [c-Ez’-7°65
crooth] now stands in April, 1519. s

88. The natives had never before seen horses, and thought
that the horse and rider. were one and the same animal.
When they looked at these formidable creatures and the
ﬂoating fortresses in which the Spaniards had come, when
they heard the thunder of the muskets and cannon and wit”
nessed the terrible eﬁ'ects of their discharge, they thought
the strangers must indeed be the children of the gods. News

a of their arrival was soon conveyed to the emperor, who sent

back orders that they should leave the country. But to these

With rich presents Which allured him onward.

Having suppressed a threatened mutiny and destroyed
his ships that there might be no temptation to return, Cor.
tez advanced into the country. He met With little opposition
on his march, induced the Tlascalans [tlah-slcah’-Zane], a tribe
hostile to Mexico, to join him, and at last came in sight of
the great Az’-tec city. With rapture he beheld evidences
of civilization that he had found in no other part of the con-
tinent. Temples and palaces, stately structures and gilded
domes, glittered in the sunlight. A populous and magniﬁ-
cent city lay before him on a picturesque island, surrounded
by a region teeming With the richest vegetation.

89. Montezuma, alarmed by What he had heard respecting
the invaders, received them hospitably. Grorgeously attired
and borne in a chair on the shoulders of four men, he Wel-
comed them to his capital. There Was a_belief among his

people, he told the Spanish leader, that strangers from the ,

east Would at some time visit them. The great chief Who
had brought the Aztecs to that spot had gone to adistant
land, but promised that he or his descendants Would return.
“As you come,” continued the emperor, “from that region
Where the sun rises, I doubt not that the king Who sends you
is the royal master of the Mexicans.” A

Cortez took advantage of this superstitious feeling, and,
not contented With the rich presents he had received, re»
solved to gain possession of the Whole country. He formed
alliances With several neighboring caciques [lea-sieelcs’], or
chiefs, Who Were enemies to Montezuma, and soon began to
meddle With the aifairs of the empire. Destroying the idols
to Which human sacriﬁces Were offered in their temples, he
placed in their stead images of the Virgin Mary and the
saints. At last, Montezuma, though afraid of the Spaniards,
secretly ordered one of his generals to attack them. Cortez

was not unprepared. Marching to the palace, he seized the
general and fifty of his men, and burned them alive, after
carrying off Montezuma in irons to his camp. The promise
of liberty induced the captive emperor to give large sums of
gold to the perﬁdious Cortez, who receivedthem but under
various pretexts refused to release his prisoner.

The Mexicans at length took up arms in a body against
their oppressors ; and, With the view of appeasing them,
Cortez compelled Montezuma to appear before them, and
urge them to submission. When he showed himself on the
battlements in his royal robes, the multitude bowed in re-
spectful silence. But when they heard him argue for peace
with the perﬁdious foe, violent reproaches and threats burst
forth on every side. In a moment, a shower of arrows and
stones fell round the unfortunate monarch. A blow from
a heavy stone prostrated him, and he died soon after from
its effects.

 90. A ﬁerce and sudden attack enabled the Mexicans to

nfdrive the Spaniards from their capital. Gruatimozin [grow];-

te-mo’-zin] was placed on the throne, and proved a brave
and skilful leader; but he was no match for Cortez, with
his horses and artillery. Having received a reinforcement
of his countrymen and induced a native tribe to join his
standard, the Spanish chief laid siege to the city, and after
75 days’ hard ﬁghting succeeded in taking it, August 13,
1521. The royal family and the chief personages ofthe em
pire thus fellinto his hands.

Gruatimozin was treated with the greatest barbarity. To
compel him to tell into what part of the lake he had thrown
the royal treasure, Cortez ordered him to be stretched on a
bed of burning coals; but he bore his sufferings with the
fortitude of an American warrior. One of his favorites who

turned a dejected eye on his master, which seemed to im-
plore permission to reveal the secret. . The monarch with a
look of authority and scorn replied, “Am I reposing on a
bed of ﬂowers ?” No further complaint escaped the faithful
attendant, whosoon died under the torture. The emperor
was spared, only to suffer death shortly afterwards with the
princes and chief nobles of his country. This was a fatal
blow to Mexican power, and henceforth the supremacy of
the Spanish was acknowledged.

91. The king of Spain had by this time become jealous of
the renown of Cortez- Commissioners were sent to inquire
into his conduct, who seized his property and imprisoned his
oﬁicers. Cortez made his way to ‘Spain and was received
with honor, though not restored to his former position. He
made another expedition to the new world, and explored
Lower California. Returning a second time to Spain, he
was treated with coldness and neglect. On one occasion

desiring an audience with the king, he was obliged to force

his Way through the crowd and place his foot on the step of
the carriage before he could gain attention. “ Who are
you ?” said the king. “I am a man,” answered Oortez,

“ who has gained you more provinces than your father left _

you towns.” Cortez passed the rest of his life in solitude,
and died at the age of sixty-two.

92. Among the bravest and most distinguished Spanish
adventurers of this period, was Pizarro. Rumors of its
wealth and splendor attracted his attention to the Peruvian
empire. He started from Panama on his ﬁrst expedition in
1524, but effected nothing more than the discovery of some
islands on the coast. a

terior of the country was visited, but with incredible labor
and suffering. On one occasion, worn out by fatigue and

disease, many of the Spaniards Wished to give up the entera
prise. Pizarro called them together, drew a line ‘on the sand
With his sword from east to West, and thus addressed them :
-——-“ Comrades, on that side are toil, hunger, nakedness, the
drenching storm, battle, and death ; on this side are ease and
safety. But on that side lies Peru with its Wealth ; on this
is Panama with its poverty. Choose, each man, What best
becomes a brave Oastilian. For my part, I go to the south.”
With these Words Pizarro crossed the line, and thirteen of
his company followed. With this small but determined
band Pizarro persevered. Succor reached him, and he was
enabled to penetrate to the city of Tumbez [t00m’-béth], and
see with his own eyes the riches of which he had heard. s

horsemen, and two pieces of artillery, he overthrew the em-

by millions of wealthy and civilized natives, and defended
by large and well-disciplined armies. It was only by con-
summate skill and bravery, and too often by brutality and
fraud, that he succeeded in this vast enterprise. The coun-
try. being subdued, Pizarro ruled it with royal power, and
cruelly oppressed the natives. He founded Lima [le'-ma],
and made it his capital, planted various colonies, and worked
the mines with which the land abounded. I A conspiracy was
formed against him in 1541, to which he fell a victim. I

95. About the time that Cortez was engaged in conquer-
ing Mexico, Magellan, [ma;7'eZ’—Zcm], a Portuguese navigator
in the service of Spain, was trying to ﬁnd the southern ex-
tremity of America, and to reach the East Indies by sailing
around it. In 1520, he entered the strait since called by his
name‘. Clearing it in safety, he saw the great ocean spread
out before him. With tears of joy, he returned thanks to
Heaven for having crowned his labors with success. He
pursued his way westward as far as the Philippine [fa-Zip“-
pm] Islands, and called the ocean the Pcacéﬁc, on account of
its tranquillity during his voyage. The king of Ze-bu’, one
ofthe Philippines, promised to embrace Christianity with
his subjects, on condition that the Spaniards would aid him
against the inhabitants of a neighboring island. Magellan
accepted the offer, but was killed in the engagement that
followed. The expedition was carried on under another
commander. One of the ships ﬁnally reached home by way
of the Cape of Good Hope, after an absence of a little over
three years. ~ This was the ﬁrst vessel that ever sailed round

ENGIJISH EXPLORATIONS AND SETTLEMENTS. .

96. DURING the reigns of Edward VI. and Mary, no at-‘

tempts were made by England to explore or colonize Amer-S
ica; but with the accession of Elizabeth the spirit of adven-
ture revived. Sir Francis Drake made several voyages to
the new world, during which he suffered much from the
Spaniards; but in 157 2 he avenged his injuries, by landing
on the Isthmus of Panama and capturing a large amount of
treasure thatwas about to be shipped for Spain. On this
expedition, one of the native guides showed Drake “ a good-
lie and great high tree”, from the top of which the Paciﬁc
Ocean could be seen. Drake climbed it; and gazing out on
that broad expanse whose shores were thought to teem with
riches, he solemnly “besought God to give him health and
life once to sail an English ship in those seas”.

and ten months. p

he might settle with an English colony. He made two voy-
ages, but accomplished little more than the erection of a pil-
lar bearing the arms of England. On his last return voyage
in a very small vessel, he was overtaken by a violent storm.
The lights of -his ship suddenly disappeared in the night,
and he was never seen again.

98. Sir VValter Raleigh, [9“cm>’—Ze], not discouraged bythe
fate of Gilbert, who was his brother-in-law, next carried on
the Work of discovery under an ample charter from Elizabeth.
Two of his vessels under Am’-i-das and Bar’-low reached the
coast of Carolina in 1584. The new land seemed to the ad-=
venturers a delightful paradise. Luxuriant vines twined
round the “ sweete smelling timber trees” 3 grapes hung in
abundance from the branches ; and shady bowers echoed on
all sides the music of beautiful wild birds. The natives
seemed to be gentle and conﬁding, and to live “after the
manner of the golden age”. The voyagers were hospitably
entertained by an Indian queen on Roanoke Island; but,
without waiting to see much of the country, they returned
home, accompanied by two of the natives. The virgin queen
of England was so pleased with their description of this en-
chanting region that she named it Virginia in honor of herself.

99. Thus encouraged, Raleigh, in 1585, sent out a ﬂeet
under Sir Richard Grenville, for the purpose of making a
permanent settlement. Grenville was brave, but hasty, and,

while exploring the coast, he burned a village of the Indians
in revenge for their having stolen a silver cup from his party
Having, landed the colonists on the Island of Roanoke, Gren-
ville returned to England, leaving Ralph Lane in command
as governor. The Indians, meanwhile, had not forgotten
the wanton destruction of their property ; and with glowing
stories respecting the i_nterior of the country they lured the
English on a disastrous expedition up the Roanoke. It was
with great difficulty that the adventurers made their way
back to thecoast, sassafras tea and dog—ﬂesh being all’ that
saved them from starvation during part of the journey.

Soon after" this, Sir Francis Drake touched at Roanoke,
and allowed the colonists, who longed once more for their
native land, to return in his vessel. They had learned from
the Indians the use of tobacco and the potato, and introduced
both into England. The Indians were in the habit of smoking
tobacco, but the practices of chewing and snufﬁng it origina-
ted among civilized Europeans.

A few days after they had sailed, Grenville arrived with
reinforcements and supplies. He left ﬁfteen men to keep
possession of the country for England, but the following year
their bones alone could be found.

100. In 1587, Raleigh sent out another party, who arrived
at Roanoke and commenced building “the City of Raleigh”,
for which they had received a charter. White, the governor
of the little settlement, soon returned to England for further
supplies, leaving on the island 89 men, 17 women, and 2 chil-
dren, one of whom, Virginia Dare, was the ﬁrst child born
of English parents in America. He found his countrymen in
a state of great excitement on account of a threatened inva-
sion by the Spanish; and no relief could be sent to the infant
colony till 1590. In that year, White returned to seek his
family and settlement, but found only a heap of ruins. VVhat

became of the colonists was never ascertained, but it is sup-
posed that they were killed by the Indians. -
Raleigh had spent nearly $200,000 in these attempts to settle
Virginia; and, having exhausted his means, he made over
his charter to a company of merchants. He was afterwards
unj ustiy condemned on a charge of plotting against James 1.,
and after a long imprisonment, which he employed in writing
a history of the world", he was at length beheaded, under a
sentence which had for years been forgotten. Thus perished

one of the wisest men and most skilful navigators of the age. ‘p
101. The attempts made up to this time to colonize Amer?“

ica had been signally unsuccessful. Adventurers, however,
were not discouraged. In 1602, Bartholomew Gros’-nold
crossed the Atlantic by a new a-nd direct route in seven
Weeks, and reached the coast of Massachusetts. He discov-=

the colony, and awed the rebellious into obedience. Several
voyages of discovery were also undertaken, during one of
which his companions, in consequence of leaving their boat
contrary to orders, were captured by the Indians and put to
death. Smith himself, after killing three of his enemies,
sunk in amarsh and was obliged to surrender. He saved
himself from immediate death by awakening the curiosity of
the savages, showing them his pocket compass, and telling
them the wonders of astronomy. Wishing to propitiate the

Indians with presents, he wrote to his countrymen at J ames- I

town to deposit certain articles in a place in the forest which
he mentioned, and then told his captors when and where
they would be found. The colonists complied with his di-
rections ; and, when the Indians found every thing as Smith
hadpredicted, they reverenced him as a superior being. IIe
was led in triumph through various villages of wondering
natives, and thus became acquainted with their character
and customs. At one place where they stopped, the simple

inhabitants brought him the gunpowder they had taken

from the captured party, and told him that they intended to
plant it in orderto discover “ the nature of the seede”.

At last they arrived at the residence of Powhatan, to
whom the fate of the captive was referred. The Indian
king condemned Smith to death, and the brave adventurer
bowed his head on a large stone to receive the fatal blow.

He was rescued in an unexpected manner. Po-ca-hon’-tas,
Powhatan’s daughter and the favorite of the whole tribe,
had become warmly attached to the kind and friendly
prisoner, who had amused his leisure hours by making toys
for the beautiful child and setting the Wonders of nature be-
fore her inquiring mind. Though only twelve years old,
Pocahontas was distinguished for ready wit and generosity
of spirit. As the savage executioner lifted his war-club, she
threw herself between it and the prisoner, placed her head
upon his, and, entreating her father to spare the life of her
friend, declared that she would save him or perish. Pow-»
hatan’s heart relented ; and Smith was not only spared, but
allowed to return to Jamestown with assurances of friend-
ship on the part of the Indians. From this time Pocahon-
tas was the devoted friend of the colonists. She often visit-
ed them and relieved their distress with presents of corn.
104-. On his return from captivity, Smith found the colony

fdreduced to forty men, the strongest of whom were preparing

to desert their companions and embark in a career of piracy.
This desperate act was prevented by the return of the com-
mander; and soon after Newport arrived with 120 immi=
grants. Some of these were goldsmiths; who, ﬁnding what
they took for an ore of gold, quickly enkindled among the
colonists an insane passion for that precious metal. New»
port returned to England with a cargo of the new-found
treasure, which proved to be but glittering sand.

, Three months of the year 1608 were spent by Smith in
exploring Chesapeake Bay and the Susquehanna. Herehe
ﬁrst heard of the Mo’-hawks, who “dwelt upon a great wa
ter, had many boats and many men, and made war on all
the world”. He discovered the harbor of Baltimore, passed
up the Potomac above Mount Vernon, met the natives,
whether friendly or hostile, in a way that commanded their

respect, and made an accurate_map of the whole region.
Three thousand miles were thus traversed in an open boat.

Smith’s superiority as a leader was now so evident that he
was elected president of the council; and the colony was
soon increased by the arrival -of3Newport with 70 immi-
grants. The new comers, however, were not accustomed to
labor or hardship, and Smith wrote home, “ When you send
again, I entreat you rather send but thirty carpenters, hus-
bandmen, gardeners, ﬁshermen, blacksmiths, masons, and
diggers up of trees’ roots, Well ‘provided, than a thousand of
such as we have.” _» T .

105. In 1609, a new charter was granted to the company,
which extended the limits of the colony and endowed the
council and governor with fuller powers than they had be.-
fore enjoyed. Lord Del’-a-ware was appointed governor,
and nine vessels containing supplies and 500 men were sent
out under Gates, Newport, and Somers [sum’-ere], who were
to manage affairs till Delaware should arrive. A violent
storm, oﬁ” the Ber.-mu’-das stranded the vessel that bore the
three leaders; but the rest of the ﬂeet for the most part
reached Jamestown in safety. It was seven months before
Gates and his shipwrecked companions joined their country-
men; andin the mean time it required all Smith’s genius
to suppress dissensions and prevent the dissolution of the
colony.‘ Many of those who had recently arrived were loose
in their habits and averse to toil; they refused to comply
with Smith’s regulations and denied his authority. The In-
dians, too, began to be jealous of the growing numbers of

the English, and formed a plot for surprising and murdering-

them. This was defeated by Pocahontas; who, at the risk
of her own life, came through the woods atmidnight, and
with tears warned the colonists to be on their guard.

couraged ; ‘ and it is probable that he would have triumphed
over every difﬁculty had he not been wounded by an acci-
dental explosion of powder, which rendered his return to
Englandnecessary. Though he was several times after this
in New England, Capt. Smith never‘ revisited Jamestown;
and,_notwithstan'ding his services, he received no reward
from the home ‘government. . He died in -1631, leaving a

name as honorable as any that the history of his age prev-

seiits.

106. With Smith’s departure began a series of disasters.
for the colonists. They were now 490 in number 5 and, too "

indolent to raise their own supplies, they made extravagant
demands of the Indians, while their overbearing conduct
added insult to injury. Open quarrels arose. Small parties
of whites were cut off, and a plan was laid by the Indians
for a, general massacre. Famine ensued. Thirty of the set»
tlers seized a ship and sailed away as pirates; and, in six
months from Smith’s departure, the colony was reduced to a
feeble remnant of 60, and these were on the point of perish-=
ing. This period of s'uff'ering was long remembered as “the
starving time”. I I

On the arrival of Gates from Bermuda, so discouraging
was the state of affairs that it was resolved to abandon the
settlement. They had nearly reached the mouth of the
river, when Lord Delaware’s boat came in sight with abuna
dant reinforcements and supplies. The sufferers were per»
suaded to return, and prosperity once more smiled on the
little colony. Labor was required of all, and new fortswere
erected as a defence against the Indians. But hardly were
the good effects‘ of Lord Delaware’s wise and energetic
measures beginning to be felt, when ill health obliged him
to return to England.

arrivals added much to the size and strength of the colony.

‘ Several new settlements were made higher up the river. In

1611, cattle and hogs were introduced from Europe. _

' 108. In 1613, Pocahontas, the ever true and affectionate
friend of‘ the English, was purchased by Capt. Argall, from
a tribe that she was visiting, fo_r a copper kettle. Her fat-her
refused to’ ransom her on the terms proposed, and prepared
for war. This was averted by J ohn Rolfe. [roéf], an Eng-
lish planter, who offered to marry the gentle Indian’ girl, and
instruct her in the doctrinesof Christianity. The proposal
was gladly accepted by Powhatan, who was ever afterwards
a ﬁrm friend and ally of the English. Pocahontas, having

renounced‘ the religion of her fathers, was baptized as a Chris-» »

tian believer and married to Rolfe. Three years afterwards
he ‘took her to England. In. London, she was an object of
general interest. An apartment was allotted her in the pal-
ace, where she was visited by crowds. Among others came

her old friend, Captain Smith. She had heard that he was
dead; and, on seeing so unexpectedly a man bound to her

heartby tender recollections, she was overcome with emo-=
tion, and buried her face in her hands to conceal her tears.
When about to return to America with her husband and in-
fant son, she suddenly died, at the age of 22. This son,
Thomas, was educated by his uncle, and became a man of

‘wealth and distinction. From him some of the leading‘ fam-

ilies of Virginia derive their descent.

, 109. An attempt was made by the colonists in 1614 to
obtain aid from Parliament, but without success; and Vir-=
ginia had to rely on the exportation of tobacco as a source
of revenue: even‘ the streets of Jamestown were planted
with it. Tobacco thus became the staple ; and, as coin was
scarce, it even passed for money. _

In 1619, after several years of mismanagement and tyranu.
ny, George Yeardley [3/Wcl’-.Ze] became governor of Virginia.

._VVithin a“ few months after his appointment, a colonial as-

sembly was established. It was known as “the House of
Burgesses”, and convened at Jamestown. This was the ﬁrst
representative body in America. It consisted of two mem-
bers from each of the eleven boroughs into which the colony
was divided. . 7

110. Hitherto there had been but few women in the col-
ony ; but Sir Edward San’ -dys, convinced that pleasant homes
were necessary to give permanence to the settlement, in-
duced ninety young women to cross the ocean at the expense
of the company; and they were soon disposed of as wives
to the settl_ers, at the rate of 100 pounds of tobacco (worth
about $7 5) each. The next year, sixty more were sent over,
and the price of a wife rose to 150 pounds of tobacco. From
1619 to 1621, 3,500 persons found their way to Virginia. A
written constitution was obtained, -and trial by jury and a
representative government became acknowledged rights.

Up to this time, the company had expended about $400,000
on the colony; and the result was thus far unsatisfactory,
though there was a good promise for the future.

the noble harbor at its mouth was reserved for the Dutch,
eighty-ﬁve years later. i

This enterprising people, having thrown off the Spanish
yoke, established a commercial republic. Though their coun-=
try contained not a single forest, they built more ships than
all the rest of Europe; and, while yet battling for liberty,
they traded With the most distant parts of the world. An
association for traffic and colonization was formed in 1608,
under the name of the East India Company; and Henry
Hudson, who had previously made two voyages to the new
world in behalf of English merchants, was taken into their
employ. He embarked in 1609; and, after following the
coast from Maine to Virginia, and discovering Delaware Bay,
he turned to the north, and entered the passage between
Long Island and Sandy Hook, the northeastern extremity of
New.Jersey. On the 11th of September, he sailed through
the Narrows, and found himself in one of the ﬁnest harbors
in the world. He entered the river since called by his name,
and ascended it a few miles beyond where Albany now
stands.

The natives, as elsewhere, were struck with amazement at
sight of the new comers. ’ When theybeheld Hudson’s ship,
the Half-moon, approaching from the sea, they knew not
what to make of the monster. As it came nearer, it seemed
to be a ﬂoating house; and at last they found it to be an im-
mense canoe ﬁlled with beings of a different race, whose com-
mander, dressed in scarlet, they took to be the Manitou
himself. Runners were sent with the news to all the sur-
rounding tribes.

The Indians awaited the approach of the strangers on the
southern point of the island now occupied by New York city,
and" received them with ‘respect and friendship. Hudson
landed with his crew, and ordered a calabash of rum to be
brought. After drinking himself, he offered it to the chiefs.

The ﬁrst smelled the liquor, but passed it on; so did the

next; and it went untasted till it reached the last of the
party. Unwilling to oﬁ”end the —Manitou, he drank it off.
His wondering companionsgbeheld him reel and fall to the
earth; but when they-saw that herecovered without injury

and heard him describe his sensations, they all desired to:

feel the same excitement. Drinking of the “ ﬁre-water”,
they also became intoxicated; and in this state Hudson .left
them. The spot was afterwards called bythe'Indians Man-
hattan, or “ the place of drunkenness”.

At this time, Manhattan Island and the valley of the Hud-».

son were covered with giant trees draped with luxuriant

grape-vines. Reptiles. crawled amid the decayed boughs ,

and foliage of former centuries. The spotted deer laved his
sides in the noble river, or hid in dense thickets which the
sun-light never penetrated. .The ﬁercer inhabitants of ‘the
forest made their lairs in unexplored recesses, undisturbed
save by the proud Algonquin, sole lord of these vast solitudes.

age he discovered the bay that bears his name. In vain he

the existence of Which he ﬁrmly believed. Continuing the
search too long, he found himself compelled to winter in this
frozen region. Their severe hardships led his men to revolt;
and Hudson, with his son and eight others, Was put in a
small boat and left to perish on the vast body of water which
his ‘enterprise had discovered.

113., In 1610 and the following years, a number of trading ,

vessels were sent. out by Dutch merchants. Valuable furs
were obtained from the Indians, and the traﬁic proved highly
proﬁtable. Some huts were soon erected on the lower part
of Manhattan Island, and in 1614 a fort was built for their
defence. The settlement was called New Amsterdam, and
the name of New Netherlands was given to the surrounding
region. In the year last mentioned, Adrian Block sailed up
the East River into the Sound and circumnavigated Long
island, This same discoverer, having lost his ship by ﬁre at
New Amsterdam, built the ﬁrst vessel ever constructed at
that port. A settlement was commenced at Albany, then,
called Fort Grange, in 1615.6

mouth of the Kennebec, but suffered so much from cold that
they were glad to return in the spring. In 1614, Capt. John
Smith, the illustrious founder of Jamestown, explored the
coast from the Penobscot to Cape God, made a map of the
country, and gave it the name of New England. .

116. In 1620, James I. granted an immense tract, extend-
ing from 40 to 48 degrees north latitude and ﬁ'om ocean to
ocean, to a commercial company consisting of forty persons."
So great were the privileges thus granted that the English
parliament questioned the king’s right to give them; and,
while they were warmly debating the subject and the mo-.
nopolists were quarrelling .among themselves, the ﬁrst per-
manent settlement in NewvEngland was made, without any
charter, by the Puritans or “Pilgrim Fathers”. 

 117. The Puritans were ﬁrst known in England as .a sep-
arate sect about 1550. They were distinguished by a stern
abhorrence of gayety and amusements, a profound love of
civil and religious liberty, and ﬁrmness in adhering to what
they conceived to be the teachings of Scripture. Persecution
drove them from their country‘; and, among those who sought
in Holland the right of worshipping God according to their
own conscience, was a congregation under John Robinson-. “
1 In 1617, part of Robinson’s ﬂock, after living eight years
in Leyden [li’-den], formed the design of emigrating to Amer-
ica. Two vessels, the Mayﬂower and Speedwell, were in 1620
got ready for the voyage ; but the‘ commander of the latter,
declaring it unﬁt for crossing the ocean, returned to port,
leaving the Mayﬂower to go on alone with 100 emigrants.
They intended to settle near the Hudson River, but were
‘carried to the coast of Massachusetts after a long voyage of
sixty—three days. A party was sent out in a small boat to

ous dangers, losing their rudder and sail, and suffering from"

the extr_eI_ne cold, which froze the spray upon their persons,

they at last reached a harbor on the eastern coast of Massa-
chusetts, which they called Plymouth Uolim’-ut/L], after the
port from which they had sailed, [see Map, p. 84]. On the

11th of December (the 22d according to the New Style,——-
see note, p. 155), 1620, the whole party" landed on Plymouth

rock, and near the shore was commenced the first town in

-New England..

118. Days of suﬂering came; but the Pilgrims met every
hardship with a ﬁrm trust in God, thinking the civil and
religious liberty they enjoyed a Suﬂicient recompense. Du-
ring the month of December, six of the colonists died from
exposure, and many others fell sick. John Carver, who had
been chosen governor before they landed, lost his son ; short-
ly afterwards he himself slept in the same grave, and his
widow was soon laid beside her husband and child. At one
time, every person in the settlement except seven, was on a
sick-bed. '

'Towards the end of March, when hope began to revive
with the milder weather, Sam’-o-set, a Wampanoag Indian,
entered the village of huts, exclaiming, “Welcome, English-
men !” He had learned a little English from previous voy-
agers,and told the colonists that they might occupy the land
where they had settled, as a pestilence had recently destroyed
its former inhabitants. In a few days Mas-sas’-so-it, a Wam-
panoag chief, visited Plymouth. By the aid of an Indian
who had been to England, and was able to act as‘ interpreter,
a treaty was made with the VVampanoags, who promised not
to molest the whites, and acknowledged the supremacy of
King James. ’ '

Puritans. In 1622, their chief Ca-non’-i-cus, to show his hos-
tility, sent Governor Bradford (who had succeeded Carver)
a bundle of arrows wrapped in the skin of a rattlesnake.
The brave governor ﬁlled the skin with powder and shot and
sent it back. Finding that the colonists were not frightened,
the chief thought it best to let them alone; but that they
might be prepared for the worst, they surrounded their set-
tlement with a palisade of stakes a mile in circuit. »
120. During the year 1622, thirty-ﬁve trading vessels vis-=
ited New England, and some provisions were bought by the
colonists at exorbitant prices, for as yet they had not raised
sufﬁcient for their support. Their agricultural implements
were imperfect; they had no domestic cattle, and were so
destitute of boats and tackle that the ﬁsh which swarmed in
the harbor availed them little. The following year, they
were so far reduced that at one time they had but a pint of
corn to divide, and at another not a single kernel. Hitherto
they had cultivated the land in common ; but it was thought
that the inducement to labor would be greater if the land
were divided and each planted for himself. Accordingly in

1624 every colonist received a small tract. After this, corn

was abundant. Other settlers of the same religious views
came over, and in 1680 the population was about 300.

121. The aﬁfairs of the colony were managed by a gov-
ernor and council of ﬁve, afterwards increased to seven. At
ﬁrst the whole body of citizens assembled in town meeting,

and decided all questions that arose. In 1639, their num-‘

ber had so increased that a representative system of govern»
ment was introduced. The people made their own laws, and
punished criminalsas they chose, even_with death, indepen-»
dently of the home government. The Plymouth settlers
were never incorporated by royal charter, and it was not till

"122. Massassoit and his tribe remained faithful to the colo-
nists, and were of service to them in various ways. The
chief never forgot that not long after the arrival of the Pil-
grims he was cured of a severe illness by one of their num-
ber, named Winslow, who turned the medicine-men out of
his Wigwam in the midst of their noisyceremonies, and re-
stored their patient with a few simple remedies. Massassoit,
in his gratitude, disclosed to Winslow a plot that had been
formed by some neighboring Indians for cutting off a party
of settlers at Weymoiith [see Map, p. 84]. Miles Standish,
a very brave man though small in stature, was the military
leader of the Puritans; and he was immediately sent with
eight men to the aid of the Weymoiith settlers. The In-
dians were put to ﬂight with the "loss of ~ three men, including
their chief, whose head Standish brought back in triumph
on a pole to Plymouth. When the news reached Robinson,
who, though still in Leyden, felt a deep interest in his for-
mer people, he wrote back to them, “ Oh, how happy a thing
had it been, had you converted some before you killed any 3.”

a fourth of the adult population were church-members. The

dissatisfaction of the people with this enactment led to earn-

est discussion and the extension of popular rights. ‘Winthrop

was governor for four years, during which the colony became

ﬁrmly established. A fort was built at Boston; mills were

 introduced; a coast trade with Virginia and New Amster-
dam sprung up; and a ferry was established between Boston

and Charlestown.
126. Though the Puritans had left England to secure reli-
gious liberty, they were unwilling to grant itto others, and

required every one by law to attend their churches and con»

form to their opinions. Roger Wﬂliams, a young preacher

'who had come over. in 1631 and "settled. at Salem, was the

ﬁrst to teach that every man had a right to worship God as

-he saw ﬁt, and that bigotry, whether in New England or old

England, was contrary to reason and the Bible. The stern
Puritan leaders did not relish such opposition to their au--
thority. Roger Williams was censured and pronounced un—
sound in judgment; and,on his election by the people of
Salemas their pastor, a ‘tract of land was withheld from them
by the Boston council by way of punishing their contumacy.
A spirited remonstrance from Williams and his congregation

followed; in consequence of which the town of Salem was
disfranchised by the next General Court. Frightened at

these measures, the supporters of Wﬂliams at last submitted,

and their minister was left to advocate his cause alone. To

summer he obtained from the Narragansetts a tract of land

SETTLEMIENT on CONNECTICUT.-—PEQUOD WAR.

( 130. THE Connecticut, so called from its -Indian name,
which means long river, was discovered in 1614 by the
Dutch. They established a trading-post near the place
where Hartford now stands, and for a time enjoyed undis-
puted possession of the country. At length, reports of the
fruitfulness and beauty-of this inviting region reached Eng-
land; and in 1630,it was granted to the Earl of Warvvicli
[wow-rile], Who transferred it to Lord Say—and-Seal and Lord
Brooke. In their honor the name of Saybrook was given to
a fort erected at the mouth of the river in 1635. [See Map,
p. 91.] 3 y  

131. Meanwhile, settlements had been made from bo_th of
the Massachusetts colonies. The Dutch had tried to prevent
the ﬁrst comers from sailing up the Connecticut, but Without
success. In the autumn of 1635, a company from Massa-
chusetts Bay made the journey by land ; but when they ar-
rived the river Was frozen, their cattle perished, and they
"Were reduced to the greatest extremities for food.   Another
party started from Boston the following summer. Travers-
ing the Wilderness with theaid of the compass and driving
their cattle before them, they ﬁnally reached the site of Hart-
ford, and settled on 1-ands bought from the Indians. 1
I 132. Diﬂiculties with the natives soon arose. The Pe-
quods, a warlike ‘tribe east of the Connecticut, regarded the
Whites with distrust; and the latter, apprehensive of attack,
only Waited for an opportunity» to inﬂict such vengeance
on the savages as would forever prevent their aggressions.

This opportunity’ soon occurred. - The captain of a trading
vessel, named Oldham, Was murdered. without provocation
by the natives of Block Island. As soon as the news reached
Boston, Endicott, With a suitable force, set out to avenge the
injury. The Indians had abandoned the island, but he de-
stroyed their Wigvvams and crops. Crossing to the main
land, he demanded from the Pequods damages for various
injuries sustained at their hands, and some of their children‘
as hostages. These being refused, he laid Waste part of their
country. The ﬂame of revenge was thus kindled in the

breasts of the Pequods. All the Wiles and cruelties of In-T

dian Warfare were now experienced on the frontier. Soli-
tary houses Were attacked; stragglers were surprised and
scalped; men Were shot down While Workingin the ﬁelds;
women and children were murdered round the ﬁreside.
Messengers Were sent by the Pequods to the neighboring
tribes, urging them tounite in exterminating the Connecti-
cut settlers. A - ' ‘ '

133. Roger Williams learned that proposals of this kind
were being made to the Narragansetts; and, in order to
save some of those very men who had banished him from
Massachusetts, he resolved to defeat thelplans of the Pe-
quods. Setting out alone in a fearful storm, he paddled
many a Weary mile to the Narragansett village. The Pe-

quod ambassadors were there, and Wﬂliamsi nearly lost his

life by interferin ‘; but he pleaded his cause boldly, and
after four days’ hesitation the Narragansetts refused to join
the Pequod league. - V

134. On the 1st of May, 1637, the authorities of Connec-
ticut declared War against the Pequods ; and, in a few days,
about 80 settlers, and 60 Mohegans under the friendly Uncas,
started against the foe. Captain" John Mason, Who had
served as a soldier in Flanders, commanded the expedition ;

ly for their villages. . The Narragansetts received him as a
friend, but Were discouraged from accompanying him by the
smallness of his force. “Your design is good,” said the
chief; “but your numbers are too Weak to brave tl1e’Pe-
quods, Who have mighty chieftains and are skilful in battle.”
. Though disappointed, Mason resolved to car.ry out the en-
terprise alone. The‘ Pequod confederacy consisted of 26
tribes, numbering over 2,000 men. Their principal villages
Were on What is.noW called the Thames [tame] River [see

Map, p."91.] Wlien they saw the English sail past on their ,

Way to Narragansett Bay, they supposed that the attack was
given up through fear, and uttered cries of deﬁance and ex-
ultation that Were plainly heard by their enemies. On the
26th of May, just before sunrise, Mason’s party, Who had
landed a little -east of their village, cautiously approached
the huts of the sleeping savages. An Indian dog gave the
alarm ; and the Pequods, though thus taken by surprise, de-
fended themselves With great bravery. The battle Was still-
doubtful, When Mason, crying “ We must burn them I”,

the Wigvvams Was covered, and thus decided the fortunes of
the day. The English and their red allies formed a circle
round the burning huts, and slew their enemies Without
mercy as the ﬁre drove them into sight.   Six hundred Pe-
quods, men, Women, and children, perished in an hour, While

, but two of the English were lost.

The next morning, a body of 300 Pequods arrived from
another village; and, though they fought. With desperation
on seeing the destruction of their homes and relatives, they
too Were defeated. The remnants of the tribe Were driven,
from place to place, and butchered by their Indian enemies

92 FOUNDING OF MARYLAND. [1609

CHAPTER IX.
FOUNDING OF MARYLAND AND DELAWARE.

. .187. THE territory now called Maryland was included in
the charter granted to the London company in 1609. Wil-
liam Clayborne, a surveyor, was sent out to make a mapof
the country, and was allowed a patent for trading with the
Indians. 1 I

In 1632,’ George Calvert, Lord Baltimore, obtained from
King James a charterfor a large tract on the Potomac, which
had reverted to the crown. _This enterprising man had ex-
pended a large sum without success in an attempt to plant

I a‘ colony on Newfoundland. He had then turned his atten-,

tion to Virginia, but was there met with a religious test in
the form of an oath, which, as a Roman Catholic, he could
not take. 1 3 f

138. As truly democratic in politics as he was liberal in
his religious views, Lord Baltimore determined to provide
an asylum where men of all creeds might enjoy liberty in its

perfection. He tookicare to have this guarantied in his

charter. Amajority of the freemen, or their representatives,
were to make the laws. The colony was to be entirely free
from English taxation, and from all interference on the part
of the king. Christianity was to be the basis of the laws,
but all sects were to be treated alike. Lord Baltimore agreed
to pay the king a yearly rent of two Indian arrows and one-
ﬁfth of whatever gold and silver he should ﬁnd, and named
his new territory MARYLAND, in honor of Queen Henrietta
Maria.

139. Lord Baltimore did not live to plant a colony under
this admirable charter ; but his son Cecil [se’-sil] Calvert
succeeded to his rights, and sent out his brother Leonard

with about 200 emigrants, mostly Roman Catholics and men
of stan.ding. They entered Chesapeake Bay early in 1634,
sailed up the Potomac, and, having bought some land from
the Indians, built the little village of St. Mary’s.

The infant colony ﬂourished, as it deserved to do‘ by the
freedom of its institutions and the justice with which its
founders treated the natives. Its sole enemy was Clayborne,
who had established two independent trading-posts, and re»
fused to acknowledge Lord Baltimore’s authority. A colli»
sion ensued, which resulted in the defeat of Clayborne, who

ﬂed to Virginia and was thence sent to England. Assem-Q

blies were held, which enacted various wholesome laws in
harmony with the liberal character of the charter. At ﬁrst
every freeman had the right to attend and vote ;’ but when
this was found inconvenient, the Assembly was made to con‘
sist of representatives chosen by the people.

Peace and prosperity_ reigned till 1642, when a short In»
dian war occurred. Hardly had it terminated, when Claya
borne, who hadfound his way back to the new world, exe-
cited a rebellion, and drove. Gov. Calvert from the province.’

suppressed the insurrection. A general pardon was pros-

the powerwas divided between two opposing sets of author?

a company in 1626, and a few Swedes came over the follow-
ing year. A war, however, arose, which engrossed the at-
tention of Gustavus, and he fell on the ﬁeld of Lutzen [l00t’-
zen] without carrying his scheme into execution. Yet it
was not forgotten. Through the efforts of the wise statesman
Oxenstiern [0m’-672-steam], a companyof Swedes and Finns
was sent over in 1638, under Peter Min’-u-its, who had pre-
viously been in the service of the Dutch. They arrived in
Delaware Bay, bought a tract from the natives, to which
they gave the name’ of New Sweden, and built Fort Chris-
tiana, near the present site of Wﬂmingtoii, calling it in honor

of the young queen of Sweden. The colony ﬂourished, re—

inforcementscame over, and another settlement was made
on a spot now embraced in the suburbs of Philadelphia.

ous eyes. Some years before its arrival, a body of men had
been sent out from New Amsterdam to settle. this region;
but quarrels arose, and the whole party was cut off by In-
dians. On this the Dutch founded a claim to the country;
and in 1651 they built a fort at Newcastle [new’-cas-sel],
within five miles of Christiana. Resolved to prevent such
encroachments, the settlers of New Sweden attacked and
destroyed the fort. In revenge forthis injury, Stuyvesant
[sti’-ve-sant],_ then governor of New Netherlands, with more
than 600 men, invaded their country, subjected it to Hol-
land, and put an end to Swedish power in America. New

from the government of Holland a grant of nearly the whole
African coast and all the countries they might conquer in
America, for the purposes of trade and colonization. Of
this extensive _territory, New Netherlands, embracing the
valley of the Mauritius [mam-7'63/L’-us] River (as the Hudson
was then called), seemed the most important, and to it the
company gave their chief attention.

Peter Minuits was the ﬁrst governor. He came over in
1625, and bought the whole island of Manhattan from the
Indians for $24. Friendly’ courtesies were interchanged
with the Plymouth Colony. AA brisk trade in furs was car-
ried on, and the capture of such Spanish vessels as approach»
ed the harbor was a further source of proﬁt. New Amster‘-»

‘dam (such, it will be remembered, was then the name of

New York) grew apa'ce._ Thiswas the ‘day of “hunters and
traders, otter and beaver skins, straw roofs, wooden chim;
neys, and windmills”. The Dutch spread out over Long
Island, Staten Island, and New Jersey. VVherever the soil
was good or beaver were abundant, thrifty Hollanders set»
tled, buying their land honorably’ from the Indians for

‘knives, -beads, or Wampum.’ To encourage immigration,

the company offered every man who in four years would
plant a colony of ﬁfty souls, a tract sixteen miles in length,

of Which, after buying the right of the Indians, he should be

“ patroon,” or lord. Grodyn [go-=cZ€ne,’], Van Rensselaer [mm
wen’-se-ler], and others availed themselves of this offer.

from white traders, committed varioustrespasses, which the
Dutch in turn punished severely. This roused the Indians
to vengeance, and 5111640 they attacked a settlement on
Staten; Island, The next year, a Hollander was killed at
Manhattan, by an Indian who had vowed to revenge the
murder of his uncle‘ ten years before. In 1642, a Hacken-
sack Warrior who had been made drunk and then robbed
by the colonists, on returning to a sense of his injury, killed

. two of the Dutch, When satisfaction was demanded, the

natives offered to pay 200 fathoms of wampum, but refused
to give up the guilty party, on the ground that the. Dutch
had themselves provoked the act. Just at this time a band
of river Indians, driven by the Mohawks, took refuge on the
bank of the Hudson opposite Manhattan, and solicited the
aid of the Dutch. Instead of granting the desired assist-
ance, Kieft [Iceeﬂ], who was then governor, sent a party of
his countrymen across the river at the dead of night, to
butcher the helpless and ‘unsuspecting savages. »Mothers
and children, old and sick, shared the same cruel fate. Such
as escaped the knife were driven from the cliffs and perished
in the freezing river. Nearly a hundred fell by this wicked
attack, T V

A desperate and bloody war was the result. The Red
Men cried for vengeance from the Jersey shore to the Con-
necticut, and many a pale-face suffered for the doings of that
night. The Indians drew no distinction between innocent
and guilty; and among other victims of their revenge was
Mrs.°Hutohinson, who,as we have seen, had ﬂed from the
Massachusetts Colony and found refuge in Rhode Island. ,

In this war several powerful tribes united, an_d it was
feared at one time that every Hollander would be swept
from the country. . But Roger Williams, whose great inﬂu-
ence with the Indians was always exerted in behalf of peace,
succeeded in persuading the exasperated warriors to bury

the tomahawk. The war was afterwards renewed; and the
Dutch escaped utter destruction only by appointing John
Underhill, who had won renown in the Pequod war, to the
command of their forces. His courage and management
were ﬁnally successful.

145. The people were tired of Kieft, whose cruelty had
provoked this disastrous war, and procured his recall. Pe-
ter Stuyvesant, a veteran who had served with distinction
in the West Indies, succeeded. Stuyvesant cultivated the
friendship of the Indians, settled boundary disputes, granted
the colony a more liberal system of trade, and promoted its
interest in various ways.

At this time, the island on which the great city of New
York stands was occupied mostly by farmers. The tract
nowxknown as “the Park” was covered with a forest, in
which boys ‘ gathered chestnuts, and tanners procured their
bark. Land was very cheap, and Stuyvesant bought for a
mere triﬂe that “Bowerie” beyond the town from which
one of the principal streets of the city is named. A wall
was run across the island, at what is now Wall-st1'eet, to
keep off the Indians. Here is a view of New York, as it
appeared from the Bay about 1650..
