and heard words that twenty
years after, slxe told me, seemed
still freesh in her mind.

The ship from America. had
been wrecked off the Needles
in a, fog, and all but three sailors
perished!

For a moment, little Lydia

stantly into the parlor; her
mother was quietly at work by
the ﬁreside. At sight of that
clear pale face, the little girl
gave 8 wild cry, ran to her, laid
her head upon her lap, and wept
bitterly. The poor mother
hardly needed to be told the
dismal news; her heart felt the
cause of her child’s grief al-
most before the words were
spoken that told her she was :1
widow. Yes! that was indeed
a. night of woe in the old farm-
house. Lydia, as was her cus-
tom, knelt down at her weeping

mother's knee, and between her

she had said from her infancy.
She came to the familiar words,
“ God bless my dear father,”
when her mother gasped out,
“O child, not that, not that;
you have no father! my poor
Lydia, you are fatherlees, my
darling.” The child paused;
she was put out of her usual
form, and knew not what to
say ; but as she always con»
cluded with the Lord’s prayer,
she left the other unﬁnished,
and began with the tender,

Again with streaming tears the

her heart was too full to add
any more ; she and her mother
wept in silence and were com-

child, and made her speak,
came like a voice from heaven
to the poor xxirlow. Neither
ever forgot the sweet con’s:~o!a-

When labor was done in

once said, he “put the book

for himself only that he learned
so much of the word of God;
but it was also that he might
speak about it to the other
hegroes, as they were at work
in the sugar house or in the
ﬁeld.

But Bibles will wear out;
and the rough ﬁngers of a. hard-
working negro, to whom the
book \vas a constant companion,
made poor Sambds wear very
quickly. The cover came oﬁ‘;

and, after many stitchings, it
could hold together no longer.
Leaf after leaf got torn; in
short,, it beczmie less and less,
until it was nearly all gone.
Time rolled on, and Szzixibo

when his master gave him his
freedom, and a little cottage to
live in. The old mzin now
loved more than ever to speak
to the black people whom he
met. He could call to mind
very well what he had once
read in the torn Testament;

Now, Sambo for some time

that a. large stock of Bibles had

town in J zunaica, and that they
were to be sold to any who

left their work. They soon
caught sight of him, and called
aloud, “ Sarnbo! well, Sambo 1 ”

“ Joy, joy I ” shouted Samba,
as he held up the book above

around him, and cried, “Now,
Sambo, read, read it.” The old
negro, tired as he was, set down

As they found they could get

You have now seen how poor
