THE COMING MAN.
A pair ofvery chubby legs,

Incased in scarlet hose;
A pair of little stubby boots,
With rather doubtful toes ;o
A little kilt, a little coat,
Out as a mother can—-
And lo! before us strides, in state,
The future’s “coming man.”

His eyes, perchance, will read the stars,
And search their unknown Ways ;

Perchance the human heart and soul
Will open to their gaze; p

Perchance their keen and ﬂashing glance
Will be a nation’s light——~—

Those eyes that now are wistful bent
On some “big felloW’s kite.”

Jeannette takes brightly every day,

And J o dreads each to-morrow.

there was no one in the room, I climbed up on
the table. It was the tenderest piece of steak
I ever tasted. I felt that it was not quite right,
but you see I was almost starved, and then all
the family had eaten their breakfast and did not
need it, so I helped myself.

How dare you be so cruel?” she asked, her blue
eyes blazing with anger. Then she called to me,
“ Poor kitty! Come here! How hungry you
must be! You look so thin. Give me that
steak, Bettie.”

dropped and said, as she handed it to her, “I
never did see such a chile for cats as you is, Miss
Flossie. Ef you had yo’ Way you Would have
the Whole house full of ’em.”

19. Ah, there it is! We are all looking for
some “great thing” to do, and neglecting the
little things which lie at our feet. Just to “bor-

and patience; and the good it may do, we may
not know now, but we shall know hereafter.

THE TINY MAN.

1. Bebe is supposed to have been thesmallest
man that ever lived. His mother was a peasant
Woman in Lorraine. He was called Bebe, be-
cause the ﬁrst few years of his life he could say
only “b-b.” When a Week old, Bebe ‘Was smaller
than his mother’s hand.

2. Ten days afterwards he Was taken in his
mother’s Wooden shoe to the village church, to
be baptized._ He ‘Was too tiny to be car-
ried safely in her arms. During the next six
months, the same Wooden shoe served as Bebe’s
crib. -    
V 3. When Bebe Was about seven years old,
the King of Poland, who was then living in

Lorraine, heard What a Wonderful little fellow

he was. So he ordered the child’s father to bring
him to court. So “Mr.” Bebe carried his son to
the royal palace in a small basket.

4. The King said, at once, that Bebe must
become his court dwarf. Bebe’s father was in-
duced to agree to this for a large sum of gold,
and Bebe was made a regular follower of the
King’s court.

5. At this time, Bebe was just twenty inches
tall and weighed eight pounds. He never grew
larger. H

6. He had a sweet little Voice, a good ear for

 music, and nimble legs. He could dance and

sing with the best of the King’s courtiers. He
was useful as a table ornament at all the King’s
great banquets. Once the King gave a grand
dinner to some of his friends. In the middle of
the table was an immense sugar-castle.

* 7. Shortly before the guests rose to leave, the
door of the castle opened and a knight, in full
armor, stepped out with a drawn sword in his
right hand. . All the guests thought the knight
must be some wonderful wooden or wax ﬁgure
which the King had obtained from the skilled
workmen across the Rhine. -

I26 POLLARDS SYNTHI./‘TIC SERIES.

8 He was not, however. He was none other
than little‘ Bebe. .He walked around the table,
shook the sword in the face of every guest,
saluted the King, and then turned back to the
castle entrance, where he took the position of
sentry. p

9. .At a signal from the King, every one at
the table began to bombard him with small sugar-
balls. Bebe hurried at once into the castle,
locked the door, mounted the tower, and pre-
tendedito return the ﬁre by setting off a lot of
perfumed powder-balls.   B

10. In 1758 the Empress of Russia sent a

‘ man to the court of the Polish King. Late one

evening, when the royal palace was almost de-
serted, this man snatched Bebe up and stuﬁed
him into the pocket of his great coat. Bebe
screamed so lustily that he revealed the plot to

the guard at the door. The man was arrested

and Bebe was rescued. .

11. Not long afterward Bebe went with the
King to the court of Louis XV., in Versailles,  
where he again narrowly escaped being stolen.

A lady   of the French court had been holding him

in her lap between the courses of a state dinner’."‘7

THE THIRD READER.’ « I27

Suddenly she rose to leave the room. At her

  ﬁrst step, a shrill cry came from the folds of her

gown: +‘Your.Majesty, your ‘Majesty, this lady
has stuck me in her pocket and is running‘ away
with me.” i V
12. The Voice was Bebe’s. He was quickly
dragged from the court lady’s pocket and placed
under the guard of two pages, who were in-
structed loy the King to watch him day and night.

13. The perils through which he had passed  

and the strict watch, under which he was now
placed, depressed Bebe’s spirits. He became
sad, morose, round-shouldered and pale.   T
14; The King thought he needed some one to
cheer him up. He, therefore, married him, with
great pomp to Therese Souvray, a dwarf of
about his own age and slightly greater stature.
That was the last drop in Beloe’s cup. Two
weeks after his marriage he lost his mind. He

‘ceased to talk entirely, ate little, and spent

mostyof his time in his crib.

15. His honey-moon was hardly over when he i

died, at the age of _twenty-one. His wife,

Therese, lived forty-two years after Bebe’s death.  

THE THIRD READER. I 1

The good people listenedto his story and prom-
ised to do all they could to aid him. For this
he was very grateful, because it is quite hard for
an entire stranger to secure a hearing with a
monarch.

12. The King gave little heed to his story,
but the Queen not only listened, but believed it.
She promised him her help and said he should
have the money to make the search if she had
to sell her jewels to raise it for him.

I think all girls should be proud to know that
a woman helped this brave man to ﬁnd this love-
ly country of ours.

13. Columbus built three ships with the mon-
ey furnished him by the Queen. These were not
large ships like those that cross the ocean now.
When they were ready, he and his sailors sailed

  away, just as he had believed he should do when
a boy. I want you to try to remember when

these ships set sail from Spain. It was on Fri-
day, August 3, 1492.

14. Just think of starting out on such a
voyage! It was not like the trips we make now.

and, as the children went back together to the

the two, though he could not have explained
why. V i
2. And then, just what he expected happened.
The choice between the two kittens was offered
first to the girl; but,instead of accepting it as a
favor, and saying, “ Thank you” for it, and being
pleased, as she ought to have been, she would
say nothing but that she liked both, and it could
not matter which she had. Nay, to look at her as

much better, mother, because she purrs when she

6. And then the little girl took up Puss
Master, and kissed him Very kindly, but went

. away without saying another word. And so a

week passed; and, though the children nursed

their kittens, they never talked about which was  

the nicer again, for a shyness had sprung up

about it ever since the day the choice had been

made.
7. At the end of the week, one sunshiny morn-

ing, the boy was riding his father’s pony, and the

little girl was in the house. Her aunt,'coming ‘

suddenly into the school room, saw her kneeling
by the sofa, weeping a silent rain of tears over
the fur coat of Puss Missy, who was purring
loudly all the time; while her own kitten, Puss

W Master, was lying asleep by the ﬁre.

8. Now, the pale, silent little girl had been
an orphan nearly two years. Her father and

THE THIRD READER. :47

mother had died within a few weeks of each

other; and she had been ever since, until quite _

lately, under the care of a guardian, who had no
children, and was more strict than kind with the
child. So that, between sorrow at ﬁrst and fear
afterwards,she had, without knowing anything
about it, shut herself up in a sort of armor,
which, until now, neither aunt nor uncle nor lov-
ing cousin, had been able to break through.

9. But they had gently waited, and the time
had come at last, and Puss Missy pointed the
moral; for, with her aunt’s arms folded around
her, she owned that she had fretted all the week
in secret because——really because--“It was so
miserable to nurse a kitten who would not purr

A “TRY-SATURDAY.”

1. Somehow, the week had not gone right for
Edna. Twice tardy at school, (from not getting

A out of bed as soon as called), her lessons had
dragged, her teachers had been “cross,” (so she

said), and her mother had found. fault. The
climax was reached the night before, when she
had gone sobbing to bed, after a sharp reproof

B from her father for being saucy and disobedient.

THE THIRD READER. 15 1

2. This morning was Saturday, and, as she
lay in her Warm, little bed and thought the Week
over, her sweet, childish face was Very grave.

3. “I am a Very bad girl!” she thought,
gravely. “I Wish I Was better, but it does not
seem to do much good to try.” a

4. Then away down in some deeper part of
her, a faint little Voice said, “ But  have you
tried?” g

5. Edna ﬂounced over, under the Warm bed-
clothes, and tried to smother the Voice, but she
couldn’t! If “ still and small,” it was Very distinct.

.6. “If you had really tried--tried hard,”
said this annoying little Voice, “you might have
done better. ‘Why don’t you begin now, by get-
ting up, and being ready for breakfast When the
bell rings, and so start the day right?”

7. “ Dear me?” said Edna, at length, speak-
ing aloud in her earnestness, “ l‘Wish the inside

  A of me would not always be bothering!”

8. But she did get up, and taking her clothes
to the Warm register, was ready for breakfast
When her mother came to her door.

9. “Up already, Edna, and dressed? Why,
how nice!” she cried brightly. “Let me fasten

And, as she ﬁnished, and bent to kiss her little
daughter, Edna felt glad the “inside of her” had
“bothered” to some purpose! E

10. It  a Wonderful help to start the day

’aright, and when Edna Went down stairs, Warm

from her mother’s kiss,.it Was not so Very hard
to slip her little face in between papa and his
morning paper, and say, softly,—-—- _

11. I arnso sorry I was naughty, papa, and
I shall try—-—”  

12. But his hearty kiss stopped her, and he
said, as he lifted her to his knee, quite forgetting
about his paper;——

13. “ That is my own, good, little Edna!”

14. Truly the little Voice was not so bad,
after all! s

15. It was .Edna’s Work to dust the sitting-
room While mamma bathed the baby, but it Was

such fun to Watch the little fellow that she some- A
\ times either neglected it entirely or   hurried

through so fast it was not half done. But, to-
day, she really tried, and the result almost sur-
prised herself. Everything looked so neat.

16. “I believe,” she said, slowly looking

THE THIRD READER. 1 53

about her, “ I believe to-day I am really going to
be good!”

17. It certainly seemed so, and mamma was
so impressed by it, that when baby went into the

_ crib for his nap, she put aside the usual mend-

ing-basket, and took out some dainty bits of silk
and muslin, saying, pleasantly,——- ‘

18. “Now, Edna, I will make that new dress
I’ve been promising your dolly as soon as I could
ﬁnd time.” And the happy hour that followed, as
Edna watched her dear Flora measured, ﬁtted,
and ﬁnally clothed in the daintiest of robes, cer-
tainly paid for the morning’s “trying.” I

19. Edna quietly made up her mind to go and
show her to her little friend, Rena Lee, after
dinner; but her plans were overthrown, and—
almost——her good resolves, also, when her mother
said :-——-

, help watch baby, I believe I will run out and do a

little shopping. Nurse is obliged to do some
ironing to-day; but it will not take long, and
you can stay with him awhile, I’m sure.”

good and sweet she hardly knew herself.

24. So she Went to the nursery and had a
nice frolic with her dear little brother, after

which, seeing he was amused with rolling his
ball about the floor, she picked up a picture book
and looked it over, sighing a little that the day
was all going without seeing Rena.
25. Just at this minute nurse opened the
door.   I
26. “ What a good child you’ve been, Edna,”
she said, gratefully, “to keep baby so quiet!

.The ironing is all done, and I’ll stay with him

now.’ Oh———and, by the way, your mamma told
me to say you were invited to Rena Lee’s to sup-
per; and now you may go, and take your dolly,
if you like.”

27. So the day ended more happily than it
began; and, as Edna again nestled her curly
head in the pillow, she said to her inner-self:—-—

28. “I see I can be good, when I try real
hard, and I am glad you bothered me so, after all.

Around it still the sumachs grow,
And blackberry vines are running.

Shone over it at setting;

And lovv eaves’ icy fretting.

And brown eyes, full of grieving,
Of one who still her steps delayed,
When all the school were leaving.

Her childish favor singled;

W.here pride and shame were mingled.

CHILD— LIFE IN INDIA.

1. Boys and girls in India are not such
merry, noisy little people as their western cousins.

2. They are more serious and quiet; perhaps
this is because they live in a warmer climate.
They are not Very strong, either.

3. I am afraid an Indian boy would be a
poor match in a wrestle with an American boy.

4. But these little Hindoos know how to run;
and, dear me, how nimbly they can turn somer-
saults! I have seen a boy spin over and over as
if he were a rubber-ball, and so fast that it al-
most made me dizzy to watch him. In a twink-
ling, he would be on his feet again, his lithe little
body none the worse for his antics.

5. During all the time I was in India, I
never saw a little girl playing with a doll. Of

THE THIRD READER. 1 59

course many of the children have them, but they
are much. rarer there than with us.

6. All the nice dolls come from England or
America, and are quite costly. One bright little
girl showed me a rag baby she had made herself.
It was very cunning, but she did not seem to
play with it much.

7. If a child has a foreign doll it is kept
carefully laid away in some drawer or chest and
only taken out, once in a long while, to show to her
friends. Indeed, mothers in India do not allow
their children to play Very much, as they think it
makes them lazy. Little boys are often sent to
school when only three or four years old. ,

8. How I wish you could peep into one of
those funny native schools! Think of twenty or
more boys, in caps and white gowns, seated on a
grass mat on the floor of a Veranda facing an

open court. They all rock back and forth and

study their lessons in as loud a Voice as they can.
0, what a noise and jumble of words they make!

9. The teacher looks Very solemn and does
not seem to mind it a bit. If a boy happens to
lower his Voice, the master raps his back, to re-

I ymind  he is not studying hard enough.

I60 POLLARDS SY./VTIJETIC SERIES.

10. In a‘ little niche in the Wall stands a
small brass or mud idol called the god of
Knowledge, to which the boys must bow many
times during the day.

11. School begins at six o’clock in the morn.-
ing, but there is a recess from eight to ten for
the boys to go home and get their breakfast".
Each boy, when he comes to school, must bring
the teacher a present of rice or fruit. This is
his tuition fee.

12. Girls are not sent to school. Even if a

’ father and mother love their little daughter, they

will say, “O, she is only a— girl; she does not need
to learn anything.”

13. But sometimes the little girls are allowed
to go to the mission school. These are Very
much like the boys’ schools, only, besides other
studies, they learn stories out of the Bible and
beautiful songs.

14. I once Visited such a lovely school. All
the children belonged to Very rich and high-
caste families. V’Vhen We Went in, no one Was
there but the Hindoo lady teacher. The child-
ren had not yet come, but the mats Were laid on

15. Pretty soon there was a noise at the
door, and inbustled the strangest looking ﬁgure,
all covered up in a white sheet. The sheet was
thrown off and out stepped a dear, bright-eyed
little maiden, with bells on her ﬁngers and bells
on her toes, bells on her ankles and bells sewed
around the bottom of her cherry—colored skirt.

16. She had bracelets, necklaces, ear-rings, a
great nose-ring, and a quantity of gold pins in
her glossy, black hair. She was a little bundle
of jewels, silks and perfumes. Every time she
moved, her little bells tinkled and she seemed to
enjoy the eﬁect as much as anybody.

17. Other children came, all dressed in the
gayest manner, for they had heard we were com-
ing to visit the school that day, and wanted to
look their prettiest. Each one had a funny
wooden slate, on which she wrote with a reed-

  pen dipped in ink made from white lead.

They are sometimes married when ﬁve or six

years old, and, if they wait till they are over ten,
they feel quite disgraced. They think it great
fun to be married, for then they have so many

19. For a few years after they are married,
they stay at home With their mothers and learn
to bake Indian bread, cook rice and curry, polish

sew a little. These are happy days for them,
but, by and by, when they go to their husbands’
houses, they have to settle down into very demure
little Women. They must never look up or
speak until they are spoken to ; they must never
laugh or play, but do their Work quietly.

are not very kind to her. They may even be‘
very cruel; and you have all heard What be-_

She has shriveled up in her hickory nut.

AUNT MARY WHITE.

1. When I was a child, there lived, next
door to my home, a dear old lady——Aunt Mary
VVhite. She was every one’s aunt; that is,_every
one called her Aunt Mary. She was a poor
widow and lived alone. i

2. There was a factory near by, where the
thread made from cocoons was woven into silk
cloth. Mr. Timothy, the owner of this factory,
used to send Aunt Mary the cocoons that had

holes in them. These could not be used in the S

factory but she could boil them in soap-suds and
spin them on her little wheel.

3. I did not know anything alooutsilk-worms
or cocoons until Aunt Mary taught me. A large
mulberry tree grew in front of her porch, which
made it always shady there; and, every day, she
lo1'ought out her wheel and spun her silk thread.

4. She ﬁrst took the soft, moist cocoon be-

tween her thumb and fore—ﬁnger, pulled oif a  

thread of the ﬂoss and fastened itto the spindle.
Then she turned the wheel with her right foot
and kept on pulling out the silk. She had
learned to do this so well that she could spin

166 P01.LAA’D‘S 5;2:<w/‘HE TIC SERIES.

Very smooth, nice, silk thread. With this she
knit silk stockings and dyed them black. These
were stronger and better than woven stockings

and the ladies who bought them always paid her

a good price. .

5. One spring I was quite sick for a long
time. At last the fever left me, but I was too
weak to walk. I had tosit, propped up with
pillows, while mother read to me.

6. When I grew stronger, Aunt Mary came
over and said she wished to carry me to her
porch. She had pillows in her large rocking
chair and a soft shawl to throw over me and she
said that she knew itwould do me good. This
was just what I needed; a change from the room
where I had lain so long. After that, the dear
old lady came for me each morning until I was
able to walk without her help. Then I went

s over and sat by her while she read to me.
‘ VVhen I grew tired of listening she would place
me in her easy chair so that I might watch her

spin. a

day, as I sat watching the silk thread slip be-

tween her fingers.

11., So I took my first lesson in spinning silk.
I made sad work of it for a while, but I kept on
trying, until Aunt Mary said she was quite
proud of her little spinner. She said I must
spin enough silkto knit a pair of stockings
for myself.

12. I found it quite easy to do, after I learned
how to pull the thread out, and, as I knew how to
knit, Aunt Mary set up the stocking for me.
‘When she grew tired of spinning we would sit
on the porch and knit. It took a long time but
I ﬁnished the stockings. Aunt Mary’s stories

Would say, “Now, Margaret, let us have a little
talk about silk.” She told me first about the
moth, a small, ’€llOWiSl’1iI1S€Ct,Wl1lCl1 looks much
like a butterﬂy. She said the moths laid their
eggs on mulberry leaves; these eggs are about
the size of a mustard seed. When the air is
Warm and dry, they hatch in a few days.

2. The little moths, when first hatched, do

not look at all like the moths that lay the eggs.

They look like small Worms,
and begin, at once, to eat the
leaves. Indeed, they do’noth-
ing but eat until they are full
grown. These are what are
called silk-Worms.

Mary, taking a dry ooooon froin a basket, and
placing it in my hand.

5. “ Very much,” I said. “ But please tell
me Where the silk-Worm is. Is it still inside?”

9. “And do these little spinners
make all the silk of which dresses
and ribbons are made?”

10. “ Yes, dear; every thread is spun by
silk-Worms. As soon as you are strong enough,
I will go with you to the factory. There you
will see a great many girls reeling the silk ﬂoss
from the eoooons.”  

11. “Do they not soften them ﬁrst? ”

12. “Yes, they sometimes throw them into
boiling Water and sometimes they are steamed.
The boiling water kills the ohrysalis ; but When
the eoooons are steamed, the ohrysalis is found
alive after the ﬂoss has been reeled off.”

It was fair and delicate, smooth and white.
3. She built her a dwelling, arched and high;
Then the poor little spinner lay down to die.
4. The magic web was her winding-sheet,
It measured in length, three fairy feet;
5. And the house she had built became her tomb.
She lay all alone in the twilight gloom;
6. But when morning had come and turned to noon
Said the master: “Ah! ’tis a ﬁne cocoon!”
7. Then they stripped from her body the robe so rare,
To deck the form of a princess fair.
8. Now the silk sweeps over the palace ﬂoor,
And no one thinks of the spinner more.

And feels its life in every limb, ,
What should it know of death?

I met a little cottage girl;
She was eight” years old, she said;
Her hair was thick with many a curl
That clustered round her head.

She had a rustic, woodland air,
And she was wildly clad;

Her face was fair, yea, Very fair—
Her beauty made me glad.

. “Sisters and brothers, little maid,
How many may you be ?” S
“How many? seven in all,” she said,
And wondering looked at me.

She answered, “ Seven are we

1. Jack Horner was a little monkey who lived
on ship-board. He wore a sailor’s jacket of
scarlet ﬂannel, and a cap to match. He was very
proud of his ﬁne attire.

2. He looked like a little old man, for he was
brown and wrinkled, and his black eyes peeped
out beneath shaggy eyebrows and crinkly gray
hair- . i

3. Sometimes when the cock was out of sight,
Jack’ would jump up onto the ﬂour—barrel and

horrid——-just horrid! She won’t give up her own
way for anybody, and all the time she seems to
think that she is perfectly lovely.   I dislike that
sort of person; don’t you,Uncle John?”

2. Amy was snugly lying in a beautiful
striped hammock which was hung in the very
cosiest corner of the veranda. Her head rested
on a scarlet pillow, and a light wrap of wool lay
in scarlet meshes over her ﬂeecy white dress.
She made a pretty picture, certainly.

3. “Yes, dear,” said Uncle John, “selﬁsh-

ness is very hateful ; few of us can endure it-—

in other people,” he added, after a pause.

4. “ N ow, Uncle John! that isn’t fair.” Amy’s
tone was a little cross, and a frown came on her
smooth forehead as she returned to her book.

5. Presently Aunt May came out from the

, parlor. She had been ill, and her face was very
pale. It did not enter into Amy’s mind that

auntie would like to lie in the hammock——not

11.” “No, Amy; I want you.”

12. “That is always the way. Just as I get
to the very best part of a story, I always have to
leave it. Nobody else is ever disturbed as I
am,” she grumbled, as she hurried away.

Is it not a pity?”

not think herself selfish.”

who had observed the little scene. “She is
always ready to share a treat with others, and she
is very pleasant as long as she is having a nice

enough to come out of doors,” said he, hardly
turning his head, while his wife sank wearily in-
to the first chair.   W

4. Amy’s eyes opened wide in wonder. This
was strange conduct, indeed! ,

5. “Why, uncle!” she exclaimed, “I should
think you would let Aunt May have the hammock.
It is much the nicest place for a sick person.”

6. “ Oh, is it? I did not notice. Well, I sup-
pose she must have it,” he said, rising, with a
shrug of his shoulders. “I don’t know why I
must always be the person to be disturbed,” he
said, with a frown and a yawn, as he strolled
away. .

7. “What can be the matter with Uncle
John?” exclaimed Amy, “I am always so

* proud of him. He is so kind and good. He
i cannot be well.”

only say that my husband never in his life acted

11. “ If you are going to the village, Will you

. call at Smith’s for me, and leave a message ?”

12. “H—m-ml” replied Uncle John doubt-

fully. “ To call at Smith’s will take me a half- '

mile out of my Way. Cannot Rufus go?”
13. p The manner Was an exact copy of Amy’s
usual tone When her mother proposed an errand

for her. Amy knew it, and colored, but said,

nothing.

14. “For that matter—” began grandpa se-
verely. But Uncle John stopped him:

15. “ Oh, I Will go, of course.” Then, in a low-
er tone, audible to Amy, but not to grandpa: “I
never do plan out a morning for myself that
everybody does not ask me to do things that
somebody else could do just as Well. If I only
could be let alone for once! ” , -

16. “Uncle John ! ” exclaimed Amy, “I never
talk so; I never make myself so hateful. There!”

17. “ Pray, who said you did?” answered
Uncle John, as if in great surprise. “I hear no

p one speak of Amy.” 1

18. Amy Was silent and thoughtful. The day

wore on. At dinner, guests came,‘ and it was
needful for some one to wait. It must be either

Amy or Johnnie. Johnnie had been obliged to

give up his place so often that, to-day, his mother
thought it better that Amy should wait. Amy
was, as usual, beginning, “I think it is really
too. bad, mamma; I always am obliged to--—”
when an odd look in Uncle John’ s eyes stopped her.

19. A week later, in a twilight talk with,

mamma——one of the sweet talks which girls and

mothers sometimes have——Amy confessed that’

she was trying to overcome her fault.

20. “I see how hateful it looks in others,”;

she said. “Truly, mamma, I never thought of it
before; and I did not know that I was so much

like that wretched girl in the story I read, until p

I saw Uncle John acting just as I had been do-
ing. Now, mother dear, will you not give me a
text to help me along?”

21. And her mother gave her this one : “For

evenChrist pleased not Himself.”

“ Search thine own heart. What paineth thee
In others, in thyself may be.

All dust is frail; all ﬂesh is Weak ;

Be thou the true man thou dost seek.”

HELPING MOTHER DOWN THE HILL.

1. A few weeks since, I saw a touching and
beautiful sight. While driving through a rug-
ged part of the country, I observed anfelderly

  lady trying to pick her way over a rough hill-

side. She came Very slowly and carefully.

2. The hill was quite steep, and I was pitying I

her and thinking of offering my help, when I heard
a whistling boy coming up behind the carriage.
He bounded past, and running up the hill put his
arms around the lady and- steadied her steps,
saying pleasant words, I know, for the face in

the warm hood looked beaming and bright with

happiness.
3. As we passed, I heard her say these words:
“It is so nice to have a boy to come and help a

  mother down the hill.” They passed on, and
went into a farm house at the foot of the hill. I

5. Jack went where he pleased about the ship,
but his own corner was a large dry-goods box,
turned on one side, and well ﬁlled with clean
straw for his bed. This was left to his own
care, and Jack was a tidy little creature. He
had watched the steward about his work till he

straw with his tiny forepaws, and arrange his

would drop on the tender little baby just as she

THE EAGLE.

The eagle is a bird of prey. It belongs

202 POLL/i1]x?D’S SYNTHETIC SERIES.

‘birds because of its great strength, its wonderful

ﬂights and the keenness of its sight.  
2. Its beak is strong and curved; its feet fur-

nished with sharp talons and feathered to the toes.  
3. The most notedspecies are the Golden,
the Imperial, the Bald and the Harpy eagle.

s The name of Bald or White-lieaded eagle has .

been given to this bird on account of the snow-
white color of its head and neck. The rest of
its ‘body is a deep chocolate brown, but its tail is
of the same white hue as its head and neck.

4. a The Bald eagle is Very fond of ﬁsh. He
is a clumsy ‘ﬁsher, still he wades into shallow
streams and manages to snatch the ﬁsh that try
to pass him.

5. The Golden eagle is foundin most parts of
Europe. It is not uncommon in Great Britain,
but is more often found in Scotland. The ﬂight

‘ of this bird is Very beautiful, but, when on ~ land,

its walk is quite awkward because its long talons
are greatly in its way. Its food is sea-‘birds,

4 hares and rabbits;and it often selects a young

lamb for its dinner. . p p _.

upon 4young children and try to" carry them oﬁ.

ing from some height While the other courses
along the ground and drives the game from the

8. The eye of this bird, as of most birds of
prey, is so formed as to enable it to see an object
at a great distance. '

9. The eagle lays but two eggs. Her nest is
made of a great mass of sticks, rushes and grass
and her young are ﬂedged about the end of July.
While in the nest, it is dangerous to approach
the spot as the old eagles are Very ﬁerce and
daring. _

_ THE LITTLE CHlCKEN—l.

 In the spring of 1887 Deadwood was
only a rough mining camp of a few hundred
people. George Miller, with his Wife and
children, lived there in a log cabin, chinked With
mud.

2. It was built on the side of one of the

  steep hills that surround the town. -The back

yard ran up to the very top of the hill and the
front yardvsloped down to City Creek.

3. All along the rocky edges of the stream,
the children panned for gold, and played they
found it. Theyalso dug a ditch eighteen feet
long, to carry the Water to their gold diggings;
and there they had built a little ﬂume to Wash
their gold from the gravel. ‘

4. On the side of the hill, they had at leasta
dozen rich quartz claims; but for the Want of
money, as they said in their play, they had not
been able to hire help to dig the gold out.

5. One claim they named Mother Goose, and

another, Jack and the Bean-pole. Above these
stood a tree, and to it they nailed a card on which  

was printed:

7. The children were twins, nine years of
age; but, as Robert was the larger and the
stronger of the two, their mother often told him
to take care of Rosie.

8. He obeyed by taking care that she should
ﬁnd his hat, run his errands, and do everything
he did not want to do himself. But, as his sister
liked to serve him as much as he liked to be
served, they were always happy together.

9.   One fond wish they had in common, and
that was the desire for a pet.

10. When in Montana, they had a dog and a
cat and many chickens; but here, as they often
complained to their father, they had nothing but
their “mining” to think of.

11. So, kind-hearted George Miller took ﬁf-
teen dollars, which he could not well spare, and
bought a rooster and two hens——the ﬁrst that had
ever been brought into Deadwood.

12. “The big brown hen is mine,” cried Rob-
bie, “because I am the biggest.”
13. “And I’ll take the little black and white

chicken,” said Rosie, clapping her hands. “O!

is she not a little love? I guess she is a Muscovy

14. “Pshaw!” he answered, “that is just like
a girl. We will call old cock-a-doodle, Father
Abraham, and his wives, Sarah and Hagar.
Sarah is my hen.”

fully. E

there were any chickens to be had here, I should
prescribe chicken broth.”

3. The children, who were sitting near, play-

4. “We have two hens,” said Mrs. Miller;
“we might take one of those.”

5. ‘Robert bent over as though looking closely

at a hole in his shoe, but Rosie came, at once, to ‘

her father’s bed-side.

6. “You can have Hagar, dear ipapa; you
can have my little chicken.” s

7. Her Voice trembled and the tears came as
she turned away, but no one noticed them in the
faint light of the room. ,

8. “Thank you, dear,” said her father, while
her mother rose, saying she would kill the
chicken at once, as it would be better if hung up

i over night.

9. “Let me hold the lantern,” cried Robert.
10. Rosie (looked out through a crack in the
cabin wall and saw the light of the lantern as

up, Rosie crept softly out of the back door, and,

THE THIRD READER. 213

by the dim daylight, saw a few dull red spots on
a pine log at the wood-pile, and, near by, a few
black and white feathers. '

12. With the tears ﬂowing fast, she picked

 them up, and, placing them together, tied them
a with a little piece of black cambric. Stealing

softly back, into the house, she laid them
between the leaves of her Bible, on a Verse in the
gospel of St. Luke, which her mother had taught
her:  

13. “Are not live sparrows sold for two farth-
ings and not one of them forgotten before God ? ”

14. That was asad day for poor Rosie. She p

stayed away from the cabin all morning and
walked along the creek.
15. At noon she returned to the house.‘ A

pleasant odor was borne to her, and she was sur- »

prised to see her father propped up in a rocking-

R chair, sitting at the table.

16. “I tell you, Mary, this chicken broth is
nice. It has made me strong already. Now I
am going to eat a wing,” he said;

17. A deep sob from the doorway made him
turn his head. There stood. his little daughter,

a with her wide-open eyes, from which the tears

18. “Why, little Rosie,” he said, holding out
his arms, “does it hurt you so ?”

19. “Yes, papa,” she sobbed, “but I am glad,
oh! so glad, that I had something to give that
will make you Well I ”  

20. A year afterward George Miller sold his
claim for a great many thousand dollars. The
man Who bought it asked him Why he called it
“ The Little Chicken.”

21. He answered by telling him about little
Rosie, and said, although it was not much of a
story, it was sweet to remember.

22. The ﬁrst money he spent was for a half
dozen hens and a rooster. These he gave to his
little daughter. VVhen Robert asked to share
them, his father said: “N o, these are all for the
little girl, who was willing to give up What she
loved so much to help heripoor sick papa.”

9. “Take ten minutes to decide, and then all
who Wish to make a happy Christmas for the poor,
this year, may raise their right hands.”

10. But the ten minutes Were too long. Five
had not passed until ten hands were lifted; even
the baby, in his high chair, erowed and raised
his chubby ﬁst, just because the others did.

11. But one child, a boy of ten, held his right

‘hand down. He shook his head and said, when

he saw the sad look on his mother’s face, “I do
not Want my Christmas spoiled. Father says

We can do as We please about it.” .
12. “And so you shall, Edward. If this is

. your Wish, this Christmas shall be to you what

last Christmas Was.”   .

13. “ But We can do as We please, too, can We
not?” asked little eight-year-old Anna, her eyes
ﬁlling with tears, as she thought of the little hun-
gry children whom she so often saw inthe street.

may choose; but do not forget that you must not

15. 1 “ We have made our choice,” said the
nine who had ﬁrst raised their hands. ,

16. “ Made ’toice,” lisped the baby, smiling as
the rest had done.

17. Edward hung his head. Although he
was too selﬁsh to give his money to the poor, he
felt ashamed to look his father in the face.

18. How busy the children were before the
holidays! Mr. Goodrich had given them money
as he always did. But this year it was to buy
gifts for the poor.

19. They were told that they might select the

toys-'———enough for twenty children——¥—_and, on Sat-
urday, their mother would go with them to buy
the clothes. s r

 20. Ida, the eldest daughter, was to buy the

~ . presents which Tot, the baby, was to give, because

he was too young to go shopping. ,

21. Mr. Goodrich said it might be well for
each of his sons to buy suits of clothes for two
poor boys, and each of his daughters to buy

dresses and ﬂannels for two poor girls. This

buy any. He might spend his money as he had
always done.

22. “But may I not go, when ‘mother takes
them to the store?” A .

23. “N o, my son. You can have no share in
this. Your choice has been made.”  

24. It was a happy family that started out
shopping on the Saturday before Christmas. Mrs.
Goodrich went with them to direct and advise.
There were twenty outﬁts to buy, and this could
not be done in less than three hours.

soft, warm stockings and asking mother if these

of twelve, and, with the other, shoes and stockings
to match. .

9. You would never have known those
children as they came into the dining room.
They looked so sweet and clean in their new
clothes. Their eyes danced and their faces
glowed.

10. Mr. Goodrich told them to bow their
heads, as he asked the dear Saviour to bless the
little ones upon this, His birthday, even as He
had blessed those other children while He was
here on earth. ,   v c

11. Then the fresh rolls, hot cakes and broiled
steak were brought in, and the children of the
family took their places with the servants behind
the chairs of their guests.

12. When breakfast was over, Ida carried
Tot over to where a girl of twelve years sat.

Bending her head she whispered, “The baby

has brought you your suit.”

13. “The darling! How I should like to kiss
him,” she said, looking up.

14. “You may. Kiss the little lady, Tot.”
15. “Little lady,” lisped the baby, leaning
over to kiss her.

15. But this was only half their‘Christmas.
VVhen they arose from the table, Mr. Goodrich

led all the children up stairs.

17. He unlocked and threw open the door of
a guest chamber. The shutters were closed to
hide the light of day, but a hundred tapersburned

. upon the large Christmas tree that stood in the

middle of the room.

18. From its branches hung the gifts——the
work-boxes and dolls for the girls; the balls,
drums and tops for the boys; and, between all
these, were candy-bags of pink, blue, red and

yellow.

19. The flood of light and the gay colors
almost dazzled the children’s eyes.

, 20. “Little friends,” said’ Mr. Goodrich, “ten
of my ‘children chose to do without gifts that
they might make you happy. They spent their
Christmas money for the clothes which they have

’v given you and for these toys. As Tot is the

youngest, he may present his gift ﬁrst.”
A ‘21. Ida lifted the baby up and he clasped

his chubby hands around a lovely work-box,
Which she helped him carry to the girl who had
kissed him.

22. Then each child in turn took a gift to
one of the children. Poor Edward! He stood
and Watched it all, but had no gift to offer;
and When one little boy Whispered, “Are you not
sorry that you are not this kind man’s son?”
he almost cried. ‘

23. Oh, but those were happy little hearts

which the ﬂying feet carried to their homes! "

And happy mothers, too, When the toys and
candy-bags Were held up and their children stood
before them dressed in nice,Warm clothes.

24.-. There was still another surprise for the

“VVilling Givers,” as Mr. Goodrich called his
children. When the poor children Were gone,
another guest chamber Was unlocked and the
light streamed out as the door Was thrown
open. .
4 25. “AnotherChristmas tree!” they cried.
What an odd-looking tree it Was! No gifts,
only on one branch; but, instead, small White
notes hidden among the green leaves.

“here are all your gifts. Your books, your skates,

AN UNEXPECTED GUEST.

1. “There 18 alittle girl aboard for Brook’s
f*t.Ltion,” said the gray-bearded oonduotor, nod-
ding his head toward the ladies’ car.

2. The busy brakeman touched his eap. “ All
iight I ” he said; and the ears swung around the
sharpest curve on the road.

3. “Too-oo-oo!” Whistled the engine in one

long Whine. The gray-bearded conductor pulled
the rope three times, which meant to the engineer,
“Stop at this station.” “Too-too!” said the en-
gine then, which meant to the station-master,
“Here comes the four-o’oloek train, and it is go-
ing to stop at Brook’s.”

  business on hand with the bag-

called out, “Braek’s Station.”

6. “ ‘Braok’s’ ” said little Ellen Henry to herself,
moving uneasily in her seat. “I wonder if this

see how anything looks, for the snow. Oh dear!
I Wish I had not agreed to come alone.” ,
7. u If Ellen had asked the old gentleman in
front of her What station this Was, she could still
have hurried out of the car in time, because
he Would have spoken the Word Brock
correctly. But Ellen was a Very shy child, and,
moreover, her papa had charged her not to talk
to strangers on the train.  
#8. Meanwhile, another girl——‘-a ﬁerce-looking,
black-eyed little maid——Was getting off at Brock’s.
“Here!” she called to Nat, “come and take off my
bag, Will you?” So, having dropped girl and bag
out on the snovv-covered platform, the brakeman
thought he had done all his duty, and the train

  Whirled on.

9. Conductor Gray-beard did not seem to have
much faith in N at’s memory, for he put his own
head out of the baggage-car to see if he had re-

imemloered the girl. Yes, there Was a slim ﬁgure,

half White with snow-ﬂakes, hurrying under the
porch of the station-house. “ All right!” said
the conductor to himself. ‘

10. illé dozen more stations had been passed,

242 POLL/1RD’S SYNTHETIC SERIES.

and it was fast getting dark, when the conductor,
passing through the ear, heard an anxious little
Voice addressing him: I

11. “Conductor, are we ’most at Brock’s Sta-
tion? ”

12. “ Broek’s? why, we passed it an hour ago.”

13. “ Oh dear!” said Ellen, beginning to cry;

.“ you promised papa to put me off at Broek’s.”

14. “Bless me!”eried the conductor, “I thought

I had put you oﬁ. Here, N at! did I not tell you to

see that this little lady got off at Brook’s? ”

15. “ You did not,” answered Nat stoutly;
“you said a slip of a girl was aboard for Brac.k’s,
and that’s why I set her off myself bag and
baggage.”  

16. Instead of getting to grandma’s in time
for the New-Year’s-Eve party, here was Ellen
twenty miles away, with no return train on the
road before morning! The handsome old gentle-
man, sitting in front, proved to be deaf and had

she unbuttoned Ellen’s long fur coat and untied
her hat-ribbons. But Ellen was very homesick
and shy among so many strangers, and would
not play at all; she stood off in a corner, looking
just ready to cry.  

20. “What can We do with her?” grumbled

one of the children; “ she will not have any fun

herself, and she spoils ours.”

21. “Let us ask Fred to beg,” proposed Bel-
la; “he can make people do anything.”

22. So the handsome young sailor, Who Was
spending his furlough at home, was found, and
the children told him‘ their trouble.

23. “Very Well! ” said Fred; go on with your
games, and I will coax her out of her corner.”

24. But the young sailor coaxed in Vain;
Ellen Would not speak nor raise her eyes. At
last, taking up an accordion and glancing around
to see that nobody Was near, he began to play a
soft tune in order that his Words might not be
heard in the room.

25. “ Miss Ellen,” he said gently, “ do you
know a Verse that begins ‘God, make my life a
little song’? ” E

26. E “Yes,” said Ellen, Without looking up.

27. “I have been writing those verses in an
album for one of our little guests,” he continued.

“Do you not think it is a good prayer for a

New Year’s Eve?”

28. “Yes,” said Ellen again, looking up at
him this time. A

29. “Then I will write them on this card for
you,” said he, drawing a pretty picture from his
pocket. “ But, ﬁrst, let me tell you that you are
spoiling the evening for these kind-hearted little
folks by refusing to join them. Is that serving
your neighbor best?”

30. Ellen’s tears began to fall in earnest now,
so he took her hand and drew her quickly after

him to the door. “Miss Ellen and I are going‘

to see how deep the snow is,” he called to the
others, “we will be back directly.” p

31. By the time they came back to the merry
party, Ellen’s conscience had been awakened ; she
forced herself to take part in the games for the
sake of others. Soon her bright eyes and laugh-
ing voice proved that trying to please others is
the shortest and straightest road to being pleased
one’s self ;7 and nobody enjoyed the New-Year’s
party more than the little unexpected guest.

THE IRON POT——I.

1. The kitchen was no longer used by the
family, but the pot hung in the great chimney-
place just as it had done for years, and Miss

a Susan Sweetapple, to Whom it belonged, Was Very

proud of it. The Sweetapples had owned that
pot for years and years. c _

2. During the Revolution it had boiled fowls
for many a subject of the king, and there was
even a story of some important papers that
escaped the search of British oﬂicers by b 
hidden in it under a great bunch of golden-ro?i§?'»?7i

3. Miss trSus.an was very fond of telling this

tale and others like it, and the Sweetapple pot
became a great object of interest in the little
village.   It was shown to all strangers, and
spoken of with great respect. i

4. “Susan would rather lose her two eyes, I
really believe, than part with that pot,” said old
Miss Abbie Bates.

5. It did seem too bad, therefore, that a new
little girl, who had no connection whatever with
the Revolution, should be the cause of thedes-
truction of the famous iron pot.  

6. It happened in this way.
One warm summer evening the
old Dillbury stage-coach stopped
at Miss Susan Sweetapple’s front

 .a very small box were set down
H upon the sidewalk.

pantalettes just grazed the ground.

8. Miss Susan used to say afterward, “I do not
know‘ Why it Was, but the moment I set eyes on
Joy Brentwood I just seemed to feel that she
was born to give me trouble.” .

9. It may have been that Miss Susan, being
unused to children, did not know how to amuse

and interest her little visitor; or it may have been

that Joy’s natural turn for mischief was some-
thing uncommon. I cannot tell.

10. At any rate, there Was not a day during
that Visit in Which some accident did not occur.
Cherished household articles Were broken or lost
one after another.

11. She refused. to have anything to do with
her real doll, but would dress up a rolling-pin or
a dust—brush, and enjoy playing with it by the
hour. I

. found her missing dish-mop, attired in one of

Miss Susan’s checked aprons, sitting in state in
a corner of the garret Window.

_ 13. To keep her out in the garden became
the grand object of Miss Susan’s life, for, though

hand that broke the cut-glass pitchers, their loss
was not so hard to bear.

14.. It happened toward the end of this try- «

ing visit, that a number of rainy days kept Joy
conﬁned to the house.

15. The little girl began to feel that her stay
with her aunt had not been altogether successful.
A dim idea came to her in these latter days that
she Would try to be Very good, and keep those
troublesome and meddling ﬁngers from doing
any more damage. T _

16. Picking up her neglected doll, she sought
her aunt in the sitting room, an.d asked permis-

sion to play in the old kitchen.

17. Miss Susan’s heart gave a great bound of
delight. She felt that her small niece was begin-
ing to try to be good, for there Was nothing in
the kitchen but the iron pot, and surely Joy was
too small to break that.

. 18. “ Yes, my dear,” she said, “you may play
in the kitchen, but don’t get into any mischief.”

19. “ No, ma’am,” said Joy, with unusual
meekness, and she departed dragging her doll

ELEPHANTS.

1. There are two species of elephants--the
Indian and the African. These differ in form
and in the markings of their teeth.  

2. The shortness of the elephant’s neck pre-
vents him from putting his head to the ground or
from steeping to the water’s edge; still he has a
wonderful way of drawing up water and pluck-
ing grass.

3. His upper lip and nose are lengthened out
for this purpose; in this trunk there are about
forty thousand muscles;with these he can shorten,
lengthen, coil up or move this wonderful organ
in any direction. —

4. This trunk is pierced throughout its

length, by two canals, through which water can R

be drawn by suction. . M

5. When the elephant wishes to drink, after
drawing the water into his trunk, he inserts the
end in his mouth and discharges the contents
down his throat. But, if he wishes to wash him-
self or play, he throws the water out with great
violence.

6. It is through this trunk that his curious,

260 POLLARD’S SYNTHETIC SERIES.

trumpet-like voice is produced.

7. His skull is formed of a number of bony
cells, leaving but a small cavity for the brain.
This fact will account for the number of bullet
holes which an elephant can endure in his skull.
The ball,’ instead of sinking into the brain, merely
lodges in one of these bony cells and does but
little harm. ,    

8. The elephant’s step is so sure that he is
never known to stumble. His tusks continue
growing to the end of his life.

9. The elephant and the dog are the only
animals which seem able to understand man’s
meaning by his look and the glance of his eye.

10. An amusing story is told of an elephant
and a tailor. A circus had just reached a town
and the animals were paraded through the streets.

11. Just as the elephant was opposite a
tailor-shop, the tailor held up a piece of ginger-
bread. The huge animal saw it and reached out
his long trunk to receive it; but, instead, the cruel

‘man pricked the point of the trunk With a sharp

needle. .
12. He was ~u11feeling enough to laugh hearti-
ly to see it coil up quickly, but was not prepared

Was sitting on his table, sewing busily, the trunk
of the elephant vvas thrust through the open Win-

over him. A

13. What a bath that was I But he had no
right to complain for he deserved it.

14. There had been a hard rain, the night be-
fore, and the elephant had ﬁlled his trunk with
Water from a gutter near by, and hurried back to
give the man a shower bath. This Would not
have happened if he had treated the animal
kindly. ;

15. In India, elephants are trained to pile up
lumber. They pile it up to the height of forty
feet. Every stick is placed in line, each piece
Weighing from two to three tons.

16. They carry the timber on their tusks,
holding it in place with their trunks. When the

a pile is too high for them to build upon, they make

a staging for themselves and do not hesitate to
mount it with their load.

1. When I Was a little girl, I did not care as
much for dolls as my playmates did ; but, one day,
Effie Neal, my dearest friend, came to show me
one Which she had received as a birthday gift.
It was a jointed doll.

2. I had never seen one before, and the mo-
ment I learned that it could be made to stand,
sit, or kneel, as its mamma Wished, I began to
save my pennies, to buy one.

 TH]/ED REA 1)/3/e. 267

8. Efﬁe said that one just like it——her twin
sister, she believed——-was standing in the window
of the toy-shop, where papa bought her darling
Rose; and, if I would get my bonnet and go with
her, she would take me there. ,

4. So we went together; and, sure enough,
the other dolly was so much like Efﬁe’s, you
would have thought it was Rose looking at her-
self in a glass.  

5. As I stood there, trying to think how long
it would take me to save ﬁfteen cents, if I saved
a penny every day, another dolly caught my eye.

6. It was a mother-doll, holding in her
jointed arms a tiny baby, and bending her red
lips until they touched the infant’s cheek.

7. “ O,Eff1e!” I cried,clasping my hands, “I
would give a hundred dollars for that one! ”

8. The shop,-boy, who had come out to
rub the window, smiled as he turned to me and
said: “ You can have her for half as many cents.”

9. “ How many?” I asked, although I should
have known that half a hundred was ﬁfty.

10. “VVhy, for ﬁfty cents, to be sure. Come
in and I will show you what that mother-doll
can do.”

20. “Yes, dear, but it Will come your turn
next. I am convinced of it,” and she vvailed so
long and so loud at the thought that Ned came
out and said, in a harsh, cross tone, “Lie dovvn,
Fanny, and keep still!”
  21. Well, the very next day, a little girl, With
the sweetest face I ever saw, came, With her

Peep. He found her, as usual, chasing the ban-

13. It took me almost a month to save twen-

to play on the pavement with Eﬁie, we would
walk three squares to the corner of Market and
Twelfth Streets, and look in the window of the
toy store, to see if the mother and baby Were still
there.

14. It seemed so strange to me that the very
nicest and sweetest of all the dolls in that win-
dow, had never been chosen by some other little
girl. I did not know that the toy-merchant had
a box full of these dolls, from which the vacant
space was supplied, whenever a sale was made.

The minster clock has just struck two,
And yonder is the moon!”

At this the father raised his hook
And snapp’d a fagot-band;

He plied his Work;--and Lucy took
The lantern in her hand.

Not blither is the mountain roe:
With many a Wanton stroke

Her feet disperse the powdery snow,
That rises up like smoke.

The storm came on before its time:

She Wander’d up and down;  
And many a hill did Lucy climb,
V But never reaoh’d the town.

The wretched parents all that night
Went shouting far and wide;

But there was neither sound nor sight

To serve them for a guide.

At daybreak on a hill they stood
That oVerlook’d the moor;

And thence they saw the bridge of wood,
A furlong from. their door.

They wept; and, turning homeward, cried, R
“In Heaven we all shall meet; ”
When in the snow the mother spied
The print of Lucy’s feet.

Then downwards from the steep hill’s edge ,
They track’d the footmarks small;

And through the broken hawthorn hedge,
And by the long stone-wall;

And then asn~—erpen—e aﬁeld they ~cross’d ;
The marks were still the same;
They track’d them on, nor ever lost;

And to the bridge they came.

They follow’d from the snowy bank
Those footmarks, one by one,

A CHlLD’S= DREAM OF A STAR.

1. There was once a child and he strolled
about a good deal, and thought of a number of
things. He had a sister who was a child, too,
and his constant companion. They wondered at
the beauty of the ﬂowers; they wondered at the
heightand blueness of the sky; they wondered
at the depth of the water; they wondered at the
goodness and power of God, who made them
lovely.

2. They used to say to one another, sometimes:
“Supposing all the children upon earthwere to
die, would the ﬂowers, and the water and the
sky be sorry?” They believed they would be
sorry. “For,” said they, “the buds are the
children of the ﬂowers, and the little playful
streams that gambol down the hillsides are the
children of the water, and the smallest bright

~ specks playing at hide—and-seek in the sky all

night must surely be the children of the stars;
and they would all be grieved to see their play-
mates, the children of men, no more.”

3. There was one clear shining star that used

T to come out in the sky before the rest, near the

church spire, above the graves. It was larger
and more beautiful, they thought, than all the
others, and every night they watched for it, stand-
ing hand-in-hand at a window. Whoever saw
it ﬁrst, cried out, “I see the star.” And after
that, they cried out both together, knowing so
well When it would rise and where. So they
grew to be such friends with it that, before lying
down in their bed, they always looked out
oncevagain to bid it good night; and when they
were turning around to sleep, they used to say,
“God bless the star!” A i

4. But while she was still Very young, oh, Very
young, the sister drooped, and came to be so

weak that she could no longer stand in the win-  

doW at night, and then the child looked sadly
out by himself, and, when he saw the star, turned
’round and said to the patient, pale face on the
bed, “I see the star!” and then a smile would
come upon the face, and a little weak Voice used
to say, “ God bless my brother and the star!”

5. And so the time came, all too soon, when
the child looked out all alone, and when there
was no face on the bed, and when there was a
grave among the graves, not there before, and

1. The honey was in Deacon Bird’s store.
What child, living in the country, has not seen
just such a store? It has barrels of apples,

‘kegs of nails, piles of codﬁsh, and, on the coun-

ters, pieces of pink-and-white stuff for little
folks’ frocks and aprons.

2. There is always a glass show-case in this
kind of a store, where are kept pen-knives and
thimbles and letter-paper and perhaps a little case
of gilt ﬁnger-rings. And behind the show-case
on high shelves there are‘ glass jars full of candy.

3. Tempting sticks, a penny apiece, some white,

some red, some with ribbon-like stripes, are in
these jars, and pink gum-drops, butter-scotch and
nut—candy.
p 4. Besides having all these melt-in-your-
mouths to sell, Deacon Bird dealt in honey. A
few boXes of the sweet golden stuff always stood
at the back of the store, near a window. One

7. All these angels, who were waiting, turned
their beaming eyes upon the people who were
carried up into the star; and some came out from
the long rows in which they stood, and fellupon
the people’s necks, and kissed them tenderly, and
went away with them down avenues of light, and
were so happy in their company that, lying in his
bed, he wept for joy.

8. But there were many angels who did not
go with them, and among them one he knew.
The patient face that once had lain upon the bed
was gloriﬁed and radiant, but his heart found
out his sister among all the host.

9. His sister’s angel lingered near the
entrance of the star, and said to the leader among

those who had brought the people thither:——

10. “Is my brother come?” . And he said,
“N o!” >

11. She was turning sadly away, when the
child stretched out his arms, and cried, “O,
sister, I am here! Take me!” And then she
turned her beaming eyes upon him——and it was
night; and the star was shining into the room,
making long rays down towards him as the saw

12. From that hour forth, the child looked out
uponthe star as the home he Was to go to when
his time should come; and he thought that he
did not belong to the Earth alone, but to the star,
too, because of his sister’s angel gone before. i

13. There Was a baby born to be a brother
to the child, and While he Was so little that he
never yet had spoken. a Word, he stretched out
his tiny form on his bed, and died.

14. Again the child dreamed of the open star,
and of the company of angels, and the train of
people, and the rows of angels, with their beam-
ing eyes all turned upon those people’s faces.

15. Said his sister’s angel to the leader,

16. “ Is my brother come ?”

17. And he   said, “Not that one, but another!”

18. As the child beheld his brother’s angel

  in his arms, he cried, “O, my sister, I am here!
ATake me!” And she turned and smiled upon

hi1n,—and the star Was shining.

19. He grew to be a young man, and was
busy at his books, when an old servant came to
him and said, i

21. Again at night he saw the star, and all
that former company. Said his sister’s angel to
the leader, “Is my brother come?” i

22. And he said, “Thy mother.” .

28. A mighty cry of joy went forth through
all the star, because the mother was re-united to
her two children. And he stretched out his
arms and cried, “O, mother, sister and brother,
I am here! Take me!” And they answered
him, “Not yet,”———and the star was shining.

24. He grew to be a man whose hair was
turning gray, and he was sitting in his chair b y

from her, God be praised ! ”-—And the star Was
shining.

28. Thus the child came to be an old man,
and his once smooth face Was wrinkled, and his
steps Were slow and feeble, and his back was
bent. And one night as he lay upon his bed,
his children standing round, he cried, as he had

WHAT THE BURDOCK WAS GOOD l='OR.

1. “ good for nothing,” the farmer said, _ ~ 
As he made a sweep at the burdock’s head ;i
But then, he thought it Was best, no doubt,  
To come some day and root it out.

So he lowered his scythe, and Went his Way,
To seed his corn; to gather his hay;

And the Weed grew safe and strong a.nd tall,

Close by the side of the garden Wall.

2. “ Good for a home,” cried the little toad,
As he hopped up out of the dusty road.
He had just beenhaving a dreadful fright,———
The boy Who gave it was yet in sight.
Here it was cool and dark and green,
The safest kind of a leafy screen. 1
g The toad Was happy. “For,” said he,
“ The burdock Was plainly meant for me,’,’

THE THIRD READER. i 303

3. “ Good for play,” said a child, perplexed
To know what frolic was coming next.
So she gathered the burrs that all despised,
And her city playmates were quite surprised
To see what a beautiful basket or chair
Could be made with a little time and care.
They ranged their treasures about with pride,
And played all day by the burdock’s side.

4. Nothing is lost in this world of ours;
Honey comes from the idle ﬂowers;
The weed which we pass in utter scorn
May save a life by another morn.
Wonders await us at every turn,
We must be silent, and gladly learn.
No room for recklessness or abuse,
Since even a burdock has its use.

“Are you in earnest? seize this very minute;
What you can do, or dream you can, begin it.
Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.” .

GEORGE WASHINGTON.

1. George Washington Was born on February
22, 1732. At the age of eleven he lost his father

, and the care of his early training fell upon his

Widowed mother. She was a devout Woman of
deep affections but strict in having her commands
obeyed. Under her rule, gentle and yet strong,
George learned obedience and that self-control
which served him so Well in after years.

2. He possessed his mother’s love of command
and with it such a love of justice it seemed im-
possible for him to do or permit aught that Was
unfair.

3. His person was large and powerful. His
face expressed the depth and strength of his char-
acter. He excelled in sports of the play-ground.
The delight he took in out-door games gave him
bodily strength and prepared him to endure the
hardships which lay before him.

4. Boys of his day were not educated‘ as they
now are. The teacher of his early years was the

sexton of his parish. He attempted no higher

study than the keeping of accounts and the
copying of legal papers.

5. The great secret of his success was that he
did nothing by halves. In youth, as in manhood, he
did thoroughly what he had to do. His school
exercise books are models of neatness and correct-
ness. ,  

6. His plans and measurements, When he
studied land surveying, showed the same exactness.
Before the war began he managed his estate,
shipped his own flour and kept his own books.
The duties of his early years prepared him for
the life-work that was to follow. Promptness
energy, bravery, all were needed to carry him.

Well might Columbia’s foemen
Beneath thy death-stroke reel,

For each hand was ﬁrm that held thee
And each heart as true as steel.

2. There’s not a tarnish on thy sheen,

A rust upon thy blade.

Though the noble hands that drew thee
Are in dust and ashes laid,

Thou ’rt still the scourge of tyrants,
The safeguard of the free,

And may God desert our banner
When We surrender thee.

“ Up with our banner bright, sprinkled with starry light ;
Spread its fair emblems from mountain to shore ;
While through the sounding sky, loud rings the nation’s cry-
Union and liberty, one evermore !”

 

DIRECTIONS FOR TEACHERS.

Follow, step by step, the instructions for presenting each lesson as

it occurs. Show that the rules governing the sounds of the short‘

vowels in monosyllables apply, as well, to the ﬁrst syllables of longer
words, and also to accented syllables; that, in ﬁrst syllables ending in
any consonant except 1-, we may expect to mark the vowel short’.

Explain clearly the meaning of the obscure sound of a vowel.
Show, by illustrations, that it is its short sound shortened and spoken
lightly, without emphasis; and, because of this, we may expect to
ﬁnd the “obscure_‘,_vowels” in unaccented syllables. Make this clear
by contrasting accented and unaccented syllables of the same’ orthog-
raphy; as, eiface, furnace; bandage, husband; renting, parent; winning,
bodkin; onset, gallon; button, gamut.

In this way lead pupils to see that it is the accent that determines
the obscure sounds of the vowels in second syllables. A ‘

Do not, however, lead them to think that exceptions will not be
found. As a general rule a, has its obscure sound in unaccented syl-
lables, while e and i are often either short or silent. It will be found
safer to mark e and i short in such words as fuel, poem, moment,
Silence, pupil, civil, curtain, etc., because of the danger of substi-

tuting the sound of u short, for the obscure s_ounds .of e and i. By,

so doing, the common errors in pronunciation, such as poum, mo-
munt, pupul, etc., will be avoided.
ar, er, ir, or and yr obscure. Indicate that these sounds must

be made obscure by placing the inverted breve under each vowelin’

the unaccented syllables of the following words, reminding pupils
that the vowel sound must not be separated from the sound’ of ther
that follows it——tl1at it is the obscure sound of these “pony voWels”
We must give when they are found in unaccented syllables; as, mor-
tar, mother, fakir, odor, murmur. Prove, by pronouncing the
word murmur, that the sound of ur in the last syllable is the same
as in the ﬁrst, except that it is spoken more lightly and rapidly.

Give daily drills, ﬁrst upon the ‘prefixes and afterward upon the
suffixes of classiﬁed Words found in. the lessons. Results will show
that pupils will become so thoroughly familiar with these “begin-
nings” and “endings” they will recognize them readily in longer
words and, by this means, will be able to distinguish the roots of
Words and place the accent correctly. i

A study of the derivation of words belongs, properly, to Fourth
Reader grades, but a rapid recognition of preﬁxes, suiﬁxes and roots
will be the result, if daily drills be given in the correct pronunciation
of classiﬁed Words.

DIRECTIONS FOR TEACIJEIBS‘. 311

LESSON .I.——Explain the meaning of the word preﬁx. Write upon
the board the words around, abstain, account, and show that a,
ab and ac are preﬁxes. Explain that the same rules must be applied
to the marking of preﬁxes as were observed in marking monosyllables:
that the preﬁx a is always obscure, as, amidst; that a, is short in ab
and ac because these preﬁxes do not end in 1-; that, as the accent must
not be placed upon the preﬁx, it must fall upon the second syllable.

Train pupils into a quick perception of the preﬁxes in the same
manner as they were trained to recognize the keys of monosyllahles.
When made perfectly familiar with the preﬁxes used in the classified
words at the beginning of each reading lesson, show them where the
mark of accent must be placed. Require them to copy and mark the
classiﬁed words of this lesson. This will impress upon them the rule

that the accent must not fall upon the preﬁx. If not upon the preﬁx‘

then it must fall upon the second syllable in the words presented.

Present only the classiﬁed words prepared for the purpose of
teaching accent, and thus avoid the confusion that must arise when
pupils attempt to classify words before they are made familiar with
preﬁxes.

They should be required to pronounce these words, rapidly and
distinctly, before the reading is attempted. This drill in marking
and pronouncing is to make them thoroughly acquainted with classi-
ﬁed words, whether found in the reading lesson or elsewhere. It will,
furthermore, teach them where to place the accent when similar words
occur in the reading lessons that follow. '

Pupils may form sentences, using as many as possible of the words
found at the beginning of the lesson. This “sentence building” and
the placing of the accent marks correctly, in_ the classiﬁed words,
should precede the reading lesson. It is this preparation that makes
them familiar with the new words and enables them to spell correctly
when the same words are dictated for that purpose. It will also culti-
vate a proper use of language.

Pupils may try to ﬁnd words, similar to the classiﬁed lists, in the
accompanying reading lesson. ‘

LESSON II.—Make pupils familiar with the preﬁxes ad, af, ag, al,
and an, after which require them to write the classiﬁed words and
place the accent marks correctly. Show that a is short because the
syllables do not end in 1'.

Give daily “talks” upon action words. Prove that the words at the

A beginning of this lesson are action words by preﬁxing the preposition

to to each. Ask the meaning of to admire, to advance. Whenever
it is possible, let pupils “act out” these words. Make this a daily
exercise.

For busy work desire pupils to write sentences, using a different

action word in each. Conﬁne them to the use of the words at the
beginning of the lessons.

Also require that the accent marks be placed correctly, calling
attention to the fact that preﬁxes must not be accented, except when

_ we wish to change verbs of the same orthography into nouns or adjec-

tives; as, preﬁx’, pre’ﬁx, concert’, con’ cert.

312 DIRECTIONS FOR TEACHERS.

LESSON III.—Write upon the board ap, ar, as and at, and train
pupils into a quick perception of these preﬁxes. Referto the change
made in the sound of a when it is followed by 1- and also rr. (Rule
given in the manual.) As, afar,.a1-ray.

LESSON IV.——If the preﬁx contains but one vowel and this is its
ﬁnal letter, mark the latter long (according to rule for monosyllables);
as, begin.

LESSON V.-—Explain that the preﬁxes com and con have the
same meaning; that the consonant following determines which must
be used; that second syllables beginning with b, p and In require the
preﬁx com, while those beginning with c, (1, f, t and v are preceded

Y (3011.

A LESSON VI.—Present the preﬁxes col, cor, de and dis for rapid
recognition and afterward refer to each separately. Require that the
true sound of 0 short be given in the preﬁx col.

Show that the sound of or in correct, corrupt, etc., is neither
short nor circumﬂex, but obscure because found in the zmaccented
syllable.

‘ In teaching the obscure sound of or give its true sound ﬂrst and
afterward explain that it is this sound shortened.

In treating of the preﬁx dis explain that, as a rule, s has the sound
of z when it is followed by a vowel in the second syllable; as, disarm.

LESSON VII.—Keep the thought constantly before pupil s that, except
in nouns and adjectives, the preﬁx must not be accented. As a rule it equals
gz when followed by a vowel or a breath consonant; as, exact,
exhaust; but has its true sound when followed by other consonants;
as, expire, extract.

LESSON VIII.—Explain here that in the preﬁx for, the vowel has
the same sound as in the word for; that the samerule must be applied
to the preﬁx fore as to monosyllables ending in e.

_‘ ,.,In; presenting such words as impart show that a is Italian because
it is found with r in the accented syllable; but in such words as collar,
dollar, it is obscure because found with r in the unaccented syllable.

LESSON IX.~Deﬁne the preﬁx in. Refer to the word indeed to
show that we occasionally ﬁnd a word that is not a verb with the
accent on the second syllable. Pupils will see, at once, that indeed is
not a verb because it does not express an action. Here show again
that a verb can be changed to a noun by placing the accent upon the
preﬁx, as incense’, in’cense. '

LESSON X.——Make pupils familiar with the preﬁxes mis, ob, oc
and‘ of before they place the accent marks in this lesson.

Show that ob, ()0, of and op have the same meaning, and that the
preﬁx ob is used where the consonant is not doubled. ,

LESSON XI.—Make pupils familiar with the preﬁxes per, pro
and pro. Ask if all these words are verbs and why.

LESSON XII.——Re, Sub. Ask, “How many think that all the
words of this lesson are verbs?”

LESSON XIII.——Sur, sus, sue and suf. Ask, “How many and
What words in this lesson are not verbs.”

LESSON XIV.—In this lesson, follow the same plan. Lead pupils

DIRECT/(7/VS F0/9 TEACHERS 313

into the habit of recognizing the verbs in each lesson before placing the
accent. In this way they will learn that the larger proportion of
verbs of two syllables have the accent on the second.

LESSON XV.——In words containing double vowels show that the
accent usually falls upon the syllable containing the double vowel.
Show, by comparing the words of this lesson, that the accent falls
upon the syllable containing ce. Pupils may determine, by placing a
or the in front, which of the words of this lesson are nouns.

LESSON XVI.——Here, also, show that, with the exception of words
with the suffix hood, the accent usually falls upon the syllable con-
taining 00.

Pupils may use these words in sentences to show that they under-
stand their meaning.

LESSON XVII.—-Explain the meaning of sufﬁx. Present the suf-
ﬁxes in the same manner as the preﬁxes were presented. Lead pupils
into a recognition of the general rule that when a is found in the
suffix it has its obscure sound.

Give the same general directions for sufﬁxes as for preﬁxes.

Do not let the accent fall upon the suffix of a word.

After pupils are made familiar with a certain number of suﬂixes,
present classiﬁed words for marking. In this way they will soon
learnto accent the ﬁrst syllables of such words.

Present the suffixes a], as, an and and and show that the
accent must not be placed upon these.

LESSON XVIII.-—Mark e short when ed follows t or cl but silent
when ed follows other consonants; as, acted, added, asked,
reared. Mark e short when es ﬁnal follows (3 g, s or x.

LESSON XIX.—When en ﬁnal does not follow the liquids 1, m, 11,
r, mark e silent. Mark (3 ﬁnal silent in words of the “le family.”

Mark e short in the suffix et.

LESSON XX.—-Show, by illustrations, the different sounds of er.

1st: When found in monosyllables and accented syllables, as fern,
sternly. S

2nd: When they are found in accented syllables which are
immediately followed by a vowel or by 1-; as merit, terror,

3d: When found in unaccented syllables; as, father, lantern.

In this way lead pupils to see that when er is found in the unac-
cented syllable, the vowel has its obscure sound. They can then de-
termine at a glance the sound of er in the words of this lesson.

Compare the words anger and stranger and show the difference
in the sound of 11 when it follows a short and a long vowel and is fol-
lowed, in turn, by ge.

In words where the short vowel is followed by ng we make 11 an
equivalent of ng, and mark g hard although it precedes e. But,
where nge follows a long vowel, the n retains its true sound and the
g remains soft.

Here refer to the rule: Mark 11 equal to ng when it is followed by
c or g hard, k, q, or x. Show, in this connection, that the ng sound
makes g hard in such words as linger, hunger, &c. ‘

LESSON XXI.—-Mark e obscure when the second syllable ends in

3 :4 DIRE CTIONS FOR TEA 0212195.

ess. Require correct pronunciation. Do not accept of luss for less
or nuss f-or ness. As a rule, words ending in less are adjectives;
words ending ness, nounvs.
LESSON XXII.——Dissyllables do not end in ick. With the excep-
tion of derrick, We do not ﬁnd k added.
Mark i short in the sufﬁxes ic, id, it etc. ‘
LESSON XXIII.——Mark i short in the suffixes il, ile, in and ain.
Show that the sufﬁxes i1 and ile are equivalents; also that the suiﬁx
ile is an exception to syllables ending in e silent, its ﬁrst vowel being
short. -
LESSON XXIV.-—I is short’ in the sufﬁxes ing, ish, ist and iff.
Like ile, the sufﬁx ive forms an exception to syllables endingin e.
LESSON XXV.—Mark i short in the suffixes ice, ise, eit and ive.
LESSON XXVI. —In dissyllables ending in y make this vowel an
equivalent of i obscure when it forms a syllable by itself or is found
in the unaccented syllable.
L Require pupils to write the plurals of the words of this lesson
applying the rule.
LESSON XXVII.-—Mark 0 obscure in the suffix or.
Exceptions are found in the words squalor, furor andstupor
where o retains its circumﬂex sound.
Make 0 an equivalent of u short in the suffixes 0111 and ome.
In the word languor show that u has the sound of W (consonant).
Rule: When gu is followed by i or 0 in an unaccented syllable,
make u an equivalent of w.
LESSON XXVIII.—Show that the suffixes tion and sion are equiv-
alents.
Rule: When (3, s, or t is followed by io in an unaccented syllable,
these consonants have the sound of sh.
Mark i silent after a dotted consonant and make 0 equal to u short
when tio or sio is found in the same syllable.

  LESSON XXIX.—ShoW the difference in the pronunciation of

words ending in ous and ious. When the syllable begins with ci or

ti, then the sound of sh must precede ous; but when ous is preceded

by any other consonant this sound is never heard. _
Compare such words as famous and gracious, pompous and

cautious that pupils may recognize the difference in the pronuncia-

tion of the last syllables.
LESSON XXX.—The word full, used as a sufﬁx, always drops one

.1, and its compounds, made by the addition of this suffix, form their

plurals regularly by adding s to the singular; as, handfuls, spoon-
fu . ' .

Give frequent drills in the pronunciation of words ending. in ute,
use and ure. ‘

Rule: When the suffix ure follows (1 t or 1 mark u long and e
ﬁnal silent; as, verdure, feature, culture, failure.

When s has the sound of zh and these consonants are followed by
ure orthoepists differ as to the sound of u.

In pleasure and leisure Webster suggests the obscure sound,
while Worcester makes this vowel obscure in all the words where ure

Write the following stanza upon the blackboard and read, giving
u its correct sound in words ending in ure. ,
‘ I‘ It makes the heart leap but to witness his joy:

Like the rapture that beats in the pulse of a boy
As he gathers his treasure of snow.
Then lay not the trappings of wealth on thine heirs
While health and the riches of nature are theirs.”

follows the sound of zh. Teachers can use their preference in the

LESSON XXXI.——ShoW by the words of this lesson that it is the

positions syllables occupy which determine the sounds of their vow-
els. When ad, al, ac etc., form the _ﬁrst syllables of Words, a must
be marked short; when these letters l°orm or are found in the last syl-
lables, they must be marked with the inverted breve to show they
have the obscure sound. Also when ack, ach, am and as are found
in second syllables, we must mark a obscure. ’

LESSON XXXII.——Present monosyllables ending in ace, age and.

ate to show that here a is long; as, lace, page, mate. Contrast
these with dissyllables ending_ in ace, age and ate, to show that a
has, its obscure sound in these unaccented syllables; as solace, bond-
a e- . . . I .

g_Show, also, that a ﬁnal has its short Italian sound in such words
as drama, polka, &c.; and that such words form exceptions to the
rule for making a obscure in unaccented syllables. . ' '

_  LESSON XXXIII.—In,this lessonfshowy the different sounds of ar.
and war in accented and in unaccented syllables ; as carpet, altar,
warfare, bulwark, ward.en,.t_owa1A-d. . g ‘

Show, also, how the short Italian sound changes to the obscure
sound with they change of acc_e_nt; as,fas_ting, breakfast, passing,
carcass, dancer, nuisance. E. v, . , , . _

3.; LESSON XXXIV.——When en ﬁnal follows. the liquids ,1, m,.n, '1-,
mark eshort; as, sullen, omen, linen, children. 5 Also in _the words
chicken, kitchen, aspen and a few others. In’ other di.ssyllab1es
ending in en mark esil_en_t; as laden, broken, haven. .

, The common error of substituting short 11:; for obscure e has led us
totésugges-t that e be marked, short in the unaccented syllables em,
ent and ment. Guard against impure pronunciation. It is moment,
not momunt; poem,,not_poum ; patient, not patiunt.

_-LESSON XXXV..—-Present words in which per is found both in_ the

accented and unaccented syllable “to show the difference in sound; as,
sternly, govern. E E _ . __ L.   T  
In presenting dissyllables ending in er show how many parts of
speech they represent; as mother, larger. farther.
Pupils may use these words correctly.in“the stories they relate; as,
A number of the larger boyswent over theriver. »
The upper, part of the old bridge began to totter when they had
passed over to the farther end. . _ _
. _ Leteach, in turn, frame a sentence containing one or more words
ending in er.

3 I 6 DIRECTIONS FOR TEA CHERS.

LESSON XXX‘VI.—-Give frequent drills in the pronunciation of

dissyllables ending in est. Remind pupils that the words are forest,
not forust; tempest, not tempust. -

In pronouncing dissyllables ending in le caution pupils against
introducing the sound of u short between the b and 1. Throw the
consonant sounds dl, bl, ﬂ, pl and kl from the lips with a quick,
short sound. Do not say wrinkul nor sparkul, but wrinkle, sparkle.

In Wor_ds ending in ethi require correct pronunciation. Do not
accept lovuth. ,

LESSON XXXVII.——Rule: When the singular number of nouns
ends in f the plural is formed by changing the fto v and adding es.
As, beef, beeves; self, selves. I ~

Give a language lesson on number in connection with this lesson.

, LESSON XXXVIII.—Rule: Nouns in the singular number ending
in y preceded by a consonant,'forIn' their plurals by changing y into
i and adding es; as, daisy, daisies; pansy, pansies.

Rulez‘ Nouns ending in y preceded by a vowel form their plurals
by adding s; as, alley, alleys; valley, valleys.

A Language lesson in number should precede these rules.

LESSON XXXIX.—Compare monosyllables ending in ence, end,
em and el, with the second syllables of the words of this lesson, that
pupils may see that the sound of the vowel is unchanged, as, fence,
silence, end, legend, hem, poem. Guard against such pronun-
ciation as silunce, poum.

LESSON XL.———Show, by illustration, that in monosyllables ending
in 0d, 01, op and 0t, 0 is short; but, in dissyllables, as in the words
presented, 0 has its obscure sound.

LESSON XLI.——When o is the ﬁnal letter of the unaccented sylla-
ble mark it long; as, hero, motto. "

When the unaccented syllable ends in ow, mark w silent and 0
long, as, elbow, arrow. * ' '

When the accented syllable contains ow, give these vowels their
diphthongal sound; as, coward, bowing. Some exceptions are found
in accented syllables in which ow equals o; as below.

LESSON XLII.-——In these lessons show that when the second sylla-
ble forms a word by itself, its vowel should be marked in accordance
with the rules governing monosyllables ; as, cove, alcove, lock,
hillock-.

LESSON XLIII.——As a rule, when on forms the second syllable, or
when these letters follow a consonant in the second syllable, mark o

‘ silent; as, beckon, person, button. But when on is preceded by e or i
in the second syllable, make o an equivalent of u short ; as, pigeon, .

cushion.

LESSON XLIV.——In the unaccented syllables ub, ut and um, '

mark u short; as, hubbub, chestnut, alum.

LESSONS XLV to L.———In these six lessons the words are classiﬁed
by their roots. Lead pupils to see it is the preﬁx that changes the
meaning. In pronouncing these words, be sure that the accent falls
upon the last syllable. It is not attract, extract, subtract, but attract,
extract, subtract.

DIRECTIONS FOR TEACHERS. 3 z 7

LESSON LI, LII, LIII.—NoUNs, ADJECTIVES AND VERBs.—If talks
about language have bern given in connection with the reading les-
sons, pupils will be prepared to distinguish readily the noun, adjec-
tive and verb. , .

The daily drills .given in classiﬁed words will enable them to dis-
tinguish preﬁxes and suﬁixes at sight. Theteacher must refer fre-
quently to the fact that a change of accent often converts a verb into
a noun, or adjective, or the reverse.

Show, by illustrations, that the accent falls upon the ﬁrst syllable
in nouns or adjectives and upon the second in verbs. As, What a
striking contrast we see when we contrast green and" yellow.

A rebel is one who rebels against the laws of his country.

With our increase in population our schools must increase.

If I preﬁx the preﬁx con to. tent I form the word content.

Desire pupils to construct similar sentences, ‘choosing the words
found at the beginning of the lesson_-—making of each a noun, adjec-
tive or verb by merely changing the accent; as, Say to the absent
pupil that he must absent himself no longerfromschool. .

The teacher should write the same word twice, calling pupils up,
in turn, to make of it either a noun, adjective or verb by placing the
accent correctly. _ ' '

Pupils may write two lists of the same words, placing a or -an be-
fore the noun and to before the verb; as, an escort, to escort; an insult,
to insult; a retail store, to retail goods. » _

LESSON LIV.—Explain why e is retained in syllables ending in
ge. (Because it is necessary to show, by this ﬁnal e, that the g pre-
ceding it is soft. Show, however, that, by common‘ consent, the c
has been dropped in many of these words; as fringing.)

LESSON LV.—TRISYLLABfLES.-——A trisyllable is a word of three
syllables. »

Explainthe meaning of the preﬁx dis. '

Pupils may change the words at the beginning of this lesson to
trisyllables by preﬁxing dis to each. ‘

Show that the accent is not changed when a syllable is preﬁxed.
Pronounce, alternately, a dissyllable from the book and a trisyllable
from the slate.

LESSON LVI.——.Show how the preﬁx im changes the meaning of
words. Pupils may preﬁx im when copying the words of this lesson
and pronounce, alternately, from book and slate. Show that the pre-
ﬁxing of this syllable does not change the accent.

LESSON LVII.——After explaining the meaning of in, require pupils;

to make dissyllables of the following words by pr‘:-ﬁxing this syllable
to each, after which pronounce from slate and book.

LESSON LVIII.——PreﬁX mis to each, in writing the words of this
lesson, and show how entirely it changes their meaning.

LESSON LIX.—Preﬁx un to the words of this lesson, the teacher
pointing out the change in the meaning as the words are pronounced.

of this lesson.

LESSON LXII.4Form trisyllables by preﬂxing inter to the words A

and syllables at the beginning of this lesson.

LESSON LXIII.——Form trisyllables by preﬁxing over to the words
of this lesson. ‘

LESSON LXIV.—Form trisyllables by the addition of the suffix
ion. ‘Here remind pupils that t, s and (3 have the sound of sh when
followed by io in an unaccented syllable.

’ Explain that it would be difﬁcult to say com-ect—ion——that euphony
demands that the sound of the ﬁnal consonant of the second syllable
be joined tolthe suffix ion. .

Show that, although the addition of ion takes one letter from the
second syllable, still the same syllable is accented; as, reject, rejec-
tion. ‘ .

LESSON LXV.—-Drop e ﬁnal from the dissyllable uponithe addi-
tion of ion.

Lead "pupils to see that, in words ending in ation, the a is always

' long and the accent always falls upon the syllable containing a. long;
i as, location. '

In such words as locate show that the accent changes when the
sufﬁx ion is added.

LESSON LXVI.——Here show as a general rule that i must be marked
short when it is followed by tion or sion ﬁnal; as, fruition, divi-
sion. '

’ LESSON LXVII.——In this lesson show that trisyllables are formed
by dropping ﬁnal e and changing the (Z preceding it to s when ion is
added; as, evade, evasion.

These exercises in trisyllables ending in ion will help pupils
remember which words take sion and which tion.

The general rule for marking the accent of such words is to place
it upon the syllable preceding the last.

LESSON LXVIII.—-Form trisyllables of the words of this lesson by
the addition of ion. '

Show, by pronouncing the word expression, that one sis silent and
the other is joined to the sufﬁx as a part of the third syllable. ” ’ O

LESSON LXIX.-—RULE: Change y ﬁnal when it follows a conso-
nant, to i or e when the suffix er, est, ly, ness or ous is added; as,
lazy, lazier, laziest, lazily, laziness; pity, piteous; duty,

. duteous. In like manner form trisyllables of the words of this

lesson.

A language lesson upon the degrees of adjectives should precede
the writing, marking and pronouncing of the following words.

LESSON LXX.—Have pupils form trisyllables by adding ance to
the words of this lesson. Mark an obscure in the sufﬁx ance.

LESSON LXXI.——-Add ment to the words of this lesson. Required

syllable ment. A ' '
LESSON LXXII.—-When the verb ends in a single consonant, pre-

‘ ceded by a single vowel, double the ﬁnal letter upon the addition

of ing; as, compelling. When the ﬁnal letter is e, drop the vowel

' LESSON LXXIII.—Illustrate the diphthongal sounds by the Words
of this lesson. Require the unclosing_ and vurving of the lips_in words
containing the diphthongs ow and ou.

Show that the accent falls upon the syllable containing the proper
diphthong.

LESSON LXXIV.—ShoW in this lesson that when the diphthong is
found in the unaccented syllable, w must be marked-silent and 0
long.

If pupils are not sure about the marking of such words, they may
accent both Ways, but if they accent the second syllable, they must
give ow the sound of a proper diphthong; as, allow. If they accent
the ﬁrst, then w is silent and 0 long; as pillow. A few exceptions
are found, as below.

Require distinct articulation in the pronunciation of the syllable
containing the improper diphthongs. The word is morrow, not
morru. .

LESSON LXXV.—Show that the accent falls upon the syllable con-
taining the diphthongs oy and oi. ,

Pupils need be at no loss to determine the sound of these diph-
thongs. They are always the same.

LESSON LXXVI.——As in dissyllables, lead pupils to see that, in tri-
syllables, the accent falls upon the syllable containing ee, as guaran-
tee. »

Also, when i has the sound of e long, the accent must be
placed upon the syllable containing the long vowels; as, magazine.

LESSON LXXVII.—-—Make pupils familiar With the suffix able.
Explain the difference in the sound of a in this suffix and in the Word
able. In the word, a is long because it is found in the accented syl-
lable. In the sufﬁx, it is obscure because found in the unaccented syl-
lable. '

Explain Why the ﬁrst vowels of the ﬁrst six words of this lesson
are long. Show that it is because these Words are derived from
monosyllables from which e ﬁnal has been dropped upon the addition
Of the Suffix; as, sale, note, love, cure, etc.

LESSON LXXVIII.—As a rule Words ending in cc and ge retain

_ the e'when the suffix able is added. This ﬁnal e is retained to show

that the c or g preceding it is soft; as, peaceable, chargeable.
_ Were this vowel not retained, the Words would be peacable,
chargable.

LESSON LXXIX.-——ShoW, by the Words of this lesson, that it is in
the accented syllables the long vowels are found. Desire pupils to
pronounceacross the page, from left to right, that they may realize
this change of accent.

LESSON LXXX.——ShoW, by the Words of this lesson, that, When
the ﬁrst and second syllables form complete Words, the suﬁix ize
must be added ; but when the ﬁrst and second syllables do not form
complete words, the suffix ise must be used.

Exceptions Will, occasionally, be found, but this general rule Will.

assist pupils in determining the correct orthography of many words.

320 DIRECTIONS FOR TEACHERS.

POLYSYLLABLES.———Show that the same general rules that
govern the marking of trisyllables may be applied to polysyllables.
As previous drills have made pupils familiar with preﬁxes and suf-

vﬁxes they will readily recognize these in longer words and refrain

from placing the accent marks over them; as, for instance, in the word
advisable, they will see at a glance that ad is the preﬁx and able
the suffix, and know, at once, that the accent falls upon the second
syllable. , ~
When polysyllables end in ophy, ogy, etry, &c., show that the
accent must fall upon the syllable preceding these ﬁnal syllables.

Also, as in dis- and trisyllables, place the accent upon the syllables ’

which precede such ﬁnal syllables as tion, Sion, tious, cial, &c.
As a general rule when a,‘ e, 0 or u forms a syllable by itself, mark

the vowel long if it does not form a part of such sufﬁxes as, able,‘

ible, acle, &c.; as, recreation, pastrology, impetuous.

When syllables ending in a, e, o and u are followed by the ﬁnal
syllables tion and Sion, mark these vowels long and place-the accent
mark above them; as penetration, locomotion, diminution.

When i forms an unaccented syllable by itself, as a general rule -

mark it short; as, solicitous, political. Exceptions are found
where i forms the ﬁrst syllable of a word as identical.

rolled from the meal-bag to a bag of hazel-y

18. But the deacon Was afraid the rascals
might harm him. So he locked the door of the
back room, shutting Dick in with the robbers, and

ran off after help. He Was back soon with big

Mr. Barrett, who had locked up many a sinner.
Pushing Mr. Barrett ahead, the deacon, Well cov-
ered by his broad shoulders, entered the back
store.

19. “Where are they?” he asked, in great
surprise. .

20. “ Don’t‘ you see them?” asked Dick, point-

A QUARREL.

1- There’s a knowing little saying
From the sunny land of Spain;
But in Northland as in Southland
Is its meaning clear and plain.
Lock it up Within your heart;  
Neither lose nor lend it—-
Two it takes to make a quarrel:
me can always end it.

Still you’ll ﬁnd. it true;
In a- fight Without a foe
Pray What could you do?
If the Wrath is yours alone,
‘Soon you Will expend it--—
Two it takes to make a quarrel;
  One can always and it.

3-   Let’s suppose that both are Wroth,
And the strife begun, 1
If one voice shall cry for “Peace,”
Soon it will be done.
If but one shall span the breach,
He Will quickly mend it———
Two it takes to make a quarrel;
One can always end it.

“ DlDN’T MEAN lT.”

1- “Didn’t mean it.” That was What Freddy
was always saying, and he seemed to think it
quite a proper excuse for anything, for he Was
always in mischief. But, alas, “didn’t mean it”
cannot set things right again.  

2- However we hope that Freddy is going to
improve. He has been Very good for three Whole

days. And the reason is that a very strange
thing happened to him last Week.

3. He had been inmischief, as usual. He
‘y‘didn’t mean” to do any harm, but he had
ruined Lily Grace Maud, his sister’s best doll,
by Washing the paint off her pretty face. Katie
cried and mamma said that Freddy could not
have any jam for tea.

4. Katie Was a loving little thing, and when
Freddy told her at bed-time that he was so sorry,
and that really and truly he “didn’t mean it,”
Katie forgave him at. once, and gave him a very
big kiss. Katie Was tired; she had cried so
much over Lily Grace Maud that she soon fell

asleep. But Freddy lay staring at the moon-

light on the floor, feeling very unhappy; he did
not quite know how or why. ’
5?. Suddenly, he saw something move in the

cornerwhere the poor doll lay in her'cradlei.

It must be a mouse; Freddy thought he

should like to catch that mouse. He would keep
it in a box with holes bored in the lid, as he had
done once before With another mouse. Y%a:t
mouse came to grief, because Freddy forgot to

-feed it. He “didn’t mean” that, either.

Walked straight across the floor to his bed-side.
Freddy tried to call out, for he was frightened,

7. Creak! The door opened, and dolls came
pouring in. Big dolls and little dolls, sailor
dolls, French peasants, babies; all more or less
broken and‘ spoiled dolls.

8. “Once in a hundred years,” said Lily

Grace Maud, “We dolls come alive. To-night it
is our turn, and We have made up our minds to
punish naughty children for the cruel things

gan Freddy, as a long list of his crimes against
poor helpless dolls rose up before him. A

9. “What shall We do to this boy?” aslced T

Lily Grace Maud. T .

10. Then all the dolls shouted, “Put his nose

Where Katie can’t reach him! Throw him out

11. Then a gentle little voice said, “VVould i

12. That was the Voice of Katie’s dear little‘

baby-doll, Alice. Freddy had treated her Worse

' than most of the others, for he had taken out

her eyes to see What the backof a doll’s eye is
like.

14. “Oh! oh! oh!” screamed Freddy, for all
the d.olls made a sudden rush at him; “ it does
matter—-oh! ”

15. “What does matter, Master Freddy?”

16. Freddy looked up. Nurse was standing,
already dressed, beside his bed, and the sun was
shining instead of the moon. Lily Grace Maud
lay quietly in her cradle with her poor smeared
cheeks. Freddy thinks it is very silly of nurse to
say he was only dreaming; and he surely has
been a very good boy ever since.

Bert, Who,sat inside her door binding shoes.

it was hard Work for her dim eyes.

4. “ Why, if there isn’t Work for me!” ex-
claimed Raohie. “I never should have thought
of it, if it had not been for Aunt Amy. Stop,
Mrs. Bert; let me do that for you.”

5. “Thank you, my little lassie. My poor

With the coarse Work yet, but sometimes it takes
me ﬁve minutes to thread my needle. And the
day will come When I oan’t Work, and then
What will become of a poor old Woman? ”

felt, that day, proved a lasting lesson to the lit-

“ Do you know, little maid, when you open your mouth
That away to the east, to the west, north and south,
On the wings of the wind, just like bees or like birds,
Fly the tones of your Voice and the sound of your words ‘P,

“ Do you know, little maid, that your mouth is a door?
All the words you have said in the days gone before
Were imprisoned within. Some were sweet, pleasant words,
Which, when they ﬂew out, sang like glad, happy birds.

“ There are others so cross they provoke and they tease,
And when they get out they will sting just like bees.
Watch them close, little maid; when cross words stir about,
Shut the door right up tight, and don’t let them get out !”

THE FAITHFUL GUARD.

1. i“Dulcie! Where are you? Oh! you are
taking care of baby, and I wanted you to play
With me.” E

- 2. “ I Will play With you, by-and—by,” said gen-I

tle little Dulcie; “but baby is not Very Well, and
Will not lie in his crib. Mother has a letter to
Write, so she has trusted himwith me for a little.
See how good he is now; he likes sister Dulcie!”

3. The baby, soothed by gentle nursing and
sweet, fresh air, forgot his pains and troubles.
Soon he leaned his head on Dulcie and fell asleep.

4. “He is asleep,” said Rupert; “put -him

down, Dulcie, and come play soldiers With me.” ;

5- This Was Very tempting, but Dulcie shook
her head. “He would be sure to wake if I moved;
but, Rupert, play soldiers here. Be «our guard.
Pretend baby is a Prince, and that you will pro-
tect him at the peril of your life.”

6. “Oh, yes, I’ll do that,” said Rupert, pleased
at this warlike game, “and I’ll ask mother if I

may take the Zulu spear out of the hall. It Will
R be more real than this old stick.”
7. He ran indoors and returned with the spear;

54 pom:/419175‘ SYNTHE TIC 5z«:/e/"E5.

but mother said that he must Walk up and down
the road by the gate. She was afraid he. might
hurt baby or Dulcie with the spear if he were Very
near them.

8. So up and down walked Rupert, feeling
Very real, and resolved to die sooner than allow
any foe to molest his “Prince.” But no one
came. It Was a lonely country road, and Rupert
was beginning to feel a little Weary, and to Wish
that Dulciewould come and relieve guard.

9. Suddenly he heard shouts and the tramp of
feet along the lane. In another minute there was

a cry,—-—“ Mad dog! Mad dog!” Then, around 4

thebendof the road, came the poor dog, closely

‘ pursued by men with sticks and stones.

10. “Run I run I ” they cried, as they came in
sight of Rupert, “the dog is mad!” .
11. Rupert heard the words and turned Very

. pale, but he stood quite still. “A guard ‘must
not desert his post,” he said quickly to himself.

He placed himselfright in the middle of the
straight path which led to Dulcie and’ baby, and

  held the Zulu spear ﬁrmly in front ofhim.

12. This took but a few seconds, and now on

came the dog, snapping and foaming as it ran.

7215 rzmep /BEA 125/2.   5 5

It heeded nothing in its path and, in its fury, ran ,

straight upon the spear. The poor beast rolled
on one side with the shock. This gave time for
the men to come up, and in another minute they

had killed the dog.

13. “You are a brave little fellow,” said one of
the men. “ How was it that you did not run
away ?”

14, But now that all was over, Rupert felt
anything but brave, and would have liked to cry.
Just then mother appeared, and when she heard
how Rupert had protected his sister and the baby,
she kissed him as if she could never stop.

15. “But I was on guard, mother,” explained
Rupert, simply, “so you see I was obliged to
stay at my post.”  

16.   Mother could not answer, but though she
did not speak, she could and did pray, that, in the
days to come, Rupert might stand as ﬁrm when
tempted to do wrong as he had stood, to-day,
when facing an earthly foe.

“ Where our duty bids us go
We should never murmur ‘ No.’ ’’

JOTHAM’S MISTAKE.

“Honest Jotham,” he was called.

2. One evening, when the train from S
came rumbling intothe station, and trunks and

boxes and baskets were piled up together in the ,

baggage-room, the strangest thing happened!
Out from the depths of a big basket, on which
was written “ Miss Dora Dane, Ashton, Vt.,”
came a piteous “ Mew I ”

3. “ Of all things !” exclaimed Jotham. “ No

train for Vermont until this afternoon. I’ll just-

let poor puss out awhile.” ,
4. So he undid the fastenings and lifted the

a cover of the basket. ,Out crept a pretty Maltese

pussy. Suddenly,from another huge basket,came
a loud “Mew ! Mew! ” Straightway, Jotham
openedbasﬁket No. 2, on which was printed “ Rev.
John Holmes, Bi .”

5. “ No more trains to B ,until morning,”
said Jotham, as out from the basket bounded a

 

 

i great, sleek black-and-white cat, his eyes glaring

‘ at meek Mistress Tabby Grey.

6. “ VVhat next 3” exclaimed Jotham ; “ I
suppose I’d better feed the poor things.” So he
opened his own modest lunch-basket, and soon
the two strangers were eating together, as if they
had known each other all their lives.

60  POLLARDS SYNTHETIC SERIES.
7. A Wise old mouse, peeping out of his hole,
sniﬁed the cheese, but kept at a safe distance.

“ One cannot be too cautious about making friends
of strangers,” said he to himself.

8. But Jotham had other duties beside feed—.

ing strange oats ; so, when he heard the Whistle

of a oountr train eaoh eat Was whisked into its
  Y »

own basket, as Jotham supposed, in his haste.

9. The next morning, Mrs. John Holmes, of
B ,heard a loud knock at the dining-room
door ; and When Papa Holmes came down stairs,
there was a surprise awaiting him. Mistress
Tabby Grey lay purring, upon a bright rug, in
the sunshine. Now Papa Holmes had not meant
to be surprised himself, but had been planning a
surprise for mamma and the little ones. He had
sent for their own muoh beloved oat, Tiger, left
behind them at S , when they moved, a few

 

 

3 Weeks before.

10. But What could this mean? He took his
glasses from his breast—pooket, put them on, and

stared blankly at “the stranger Within his gates”.

11. An hour later that same morning, Miss

Dora Dane was polishing the breakfast china and .

silver, in her sunny dining-room, at Ashton, Vt.

Her sister, Miss Hannah, sat in the bay-window,
With her basket of mending. Through the open
Window the morning-glories shyly nodded; pretty

sometimes Wish We had brought old Tabby home

peal of the door-bell. Miss Dora dried her
hands, took off her linen apron and Went to the
door. ‘ E

13. Wlhen Miss Hannah stepped into the hall
a little later she saw a boy in a blue suit, Wait-
ing at the door, While Miss Dora Was gazing at
the message in her hand.

14. “Wl1at can it be I ” she exclaimed.

15. “VVhat can it be I” echoed‘ Miss Hannah.

16. Then Miss Dora put on her glasses, out
one end of the envelope with a pair of scissors, and

slowly read: “W1°ong cat sent. Please return i

to express agent A—-, C. O. D.”

17. “ What can it ”—»—

18. “Please sign here, ” said the boy, handing
her a note-book and a pencil. T

19. An hour later the two dear old ladies sat
in the sunny dining-room, still puzzling over
that strange message. As they were sitting
down to supper, there came another surprise.
This time it was a boy with a basket containing
Tiger!   T - _
20. “If it had only been old Tabby,” said
Miss Dora, “I should think brother VVill had
sent her to give us a pleasant surprise.” -

YHE YHIRD READER. 63

21. “ If it had only been old Tabby! ”echoed
Miss Hannah.. Then she laughed such a cheery
laugh that one, hearing it,Would almost expect to
see the Wrinkles fading out and the gray hair
turning brown again, as if by magic. It did seem
as if the years could never make dear Miss Han-

nah really old, her heart was such a fountain of T

youth.

22.   This surely Was “the Wrong cat, ” sent by
some one’s mistake. But where and What was
the right one ? “ Well, he shall stay to-night,”
they said, “ and Well trust to time to make it
clear.” a
23. That evening they sat With folded hand s——-
an almost unheard-of thing except on Sundays
Watching the great stranger who had made him-
selfat home on a big cushion.

24. The next morning Tiger began his trav-
els again on a return trip to A , and in
due time was vvelcomed,With a joyful uproar, by
all the little Holmes children, While the strange
message was made plain to Miss Dora and Miss
Hannah by the safe arrival of Mistress Tabby

awhile. Every time the calf even turned his face

it was fastened. ’ He ran and drove the calf away
from the hole, and then came back to the churn.

churn, Tommy!” But he was so tired waiting
for Billy that he thought he would just step in
where Carlo always stood. The rope which went

around Carlo’s neck was there. He put it around .

off, the tighter he pulled it.

Don’t you see what trouble comes of thinking
wrong?

And can’t you take a warning from their dread-

Who began their thinking when it was too late?

Don’t think there’s always safety where no danger
shows ;  

Don’t suppose that you know more than anybody

But when you’re warn_ed of ruin, pause upon the

And don’t go under, headlong, ’cause you didn’t

JOE’S CONQUEST.  

1. The Sunday-school, of which Joe was a
member, was to collect some money for the suf-
ferers in a great ﬂood. Joe’s tender, boyish
heart had been moved to its very depths when
he read of the suffering among the people in
towns only a few hundred miles away from his
own home. He longed to do something to help
them.

2 ,“I do wish we were rich,” he said over
and over again, “ and "Pd give to everything that
needed help.”

8. But Joe and his mother were poor——very
poor. ,They had only two roomsiin a large
block, and Joe’s mother sewed for a living. Joe
went to school part of the day; the rest of the
time he had to work to help along, for it was
hard to make both ends meet, when the
wages were so small and everything cost so
much.

4. “I shall ask my father for ﬁve dollars,”

said Phil Porter, after Sunday-school. “I am 

sure he will want me to give as much as that,
anyway.”

  SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.

The publication of a Synthetic Third Reader became a
necessity. It is the outgrowth of the increasing popularity of
the Method. Primary teachers begin to realize that it is a mis-
take to burden the child with the memorizing of individual
words when classiﬁcations can be arranged and proﬁtable busy

work provided for the restless ﬁngers; when, in this pleasing

manner, a thorough knowledge of the language may be attained.
The design of this book is to carry on the Synthetic work
begun in the lower grades.
The lessons have been carefully adapted to the comprehen-

‘ sion of Third Reader pupils. A glance through the index will

show that, while these lessons afford a pleasing variety of topics,
we have made careful selection of those calculated to promote
moral growth, patriotism, the cultivation of kindly feelings and
polite manners.

The importance of molding the tastes at an early age has
led us to make selections from some of the best standard poets
without taking the unwarrantable liberty of changing the
authors’ words.  
  With the independence attained through the careful drills
given in our Second Reader, pupils will ﬁnd the new words here

- presented comparatively easy.

5. “Oh yes,” answered Ed Morris; “ we can’t
do any less; that is about what I expect to give;
don’t you, VVill ?”

6. “ I think so. I had not thought, but I’ll do
as you fellows do.”

7. Joe listened to the boys, and then crept
quietly off before they could have achance to ask
what he would do. They were all rich men’s
sons; how could they know «what a fortune ﬁve
dollars was to him?

8. “How much can I give, mother he
asked, when he had reached home and they were
talking it over together.

9. “How much have you in your purse ?” she
said- Mrs. Duncan wanted Joe to learn to be
generous even if he was poor; so she had him

put aside a certain portion of his little earnings A

for such purposes as this.
10. “ Only twenty-ﬁve cents,” answered Joe.
It seemed too small now to mention since he had

heard the boys talking, though, as he had put it

aside, it had seemed much more.
11. “You must give to the ‘fresh air fund,’
you know. Is not ﬁfteen cents about all that you

, can spare now? ”

12. “Oh, mother,” exclaimed Joe, choking
hack the tears, “I coalcl mt go there and give

only that, when all the other boys are giving so
 V / much.”

disappointed in you if you do. I thought my boy
was manly enough to do his duty, no matter what
it cost. The money has been called for, and it is
your duty to give what you can. You say it
is not enough to do any good, but you do not know
about that; the.Lord can use it so that it may do
a great deal, and you may miss a blessing if you
do not give it.” s

18. That was all Mrs. Duncan would say, and
Joe thought about it all the week. Sometimes
he fairly shivered as he thought how the boys
would laugh at him, and he would declare to
himself that he would not go; then he would

  feel ashamed that he was so cowardly.

19. Saturday came, and Joe was still ﬁght-
ing his weary battle, when a talk he overheard

decided him. He was in a store waiting for a

some parcels to be done up which he was to

deliver. Two gentlemen stood beside him talk-

ing of the ﬂood and the money soffreely sent in
for the sufferers. One of the’ gentlemen Joe

knew, by sight, to be the richest man in the city. a

gets the richest blessing. I know it was so with
me. VVhenI was young, and had just started in
business, I was burnt out. We escaped with our
lives, but we lost everything. I was about dis-
couraged, for I had worked hard for the little I
had gathered, and now it was all gone. I had a
family depending upon me, too. My friends and
neighbors made up a purse for me, and one
young fellow came to me and gave me ten cents.

21. “ ‘ I could not put it on the paper,’ he said.

, ‘Id gladly do more for you if I could, but I’ll do

what I can, small as it is, if you’ll take it. It will
buy a drink of milk for the babies, perhaps.’
22. “Well, do you know, that dime did more

for me than all the rest; it warmed my heart and
‘ took away the bitterness, and gave me courage to

start again. I have always felt, since then, that the
Lord bestows a special blessing on the offerings

  of His little ones.”

A 23. Joe took his parcels and went his way,
but the struggle was over.  

24. “I shall go and give what I can, if it
is only a cent,” he said to his mother that night;
“and I don’t believe I shall ever be such a
coward again.”

26. But the boys did not laugh.

I gives; and, my! I never should think I could

give a cent if I had as little as he has. I tell
you, I have a real respect for him.”

THE LION.

1. The lion has been justly called the “King
of the Forest.” His roar sounds like the rolling
of distant thunder. yFearless and stately he
reigns over all the animals as their king and

chief. -How noble he looks as he‘ stands erect

and Watchful.

Her broad chest and strongly built body prove
how great and powerful she is when attacking

i an enemy. Both seem to be on the watch for the

approach of either man or beast. The ‘brave
lion stands ready to defend his partner, the

lioness, from the coming foe.

8. The story of Androcles proves that the
lion is a‘most grateful animal.

4. Androcles was a slave who tried to escape
r from a cruel master. He had wandered all night
and day through a forest before he found the A

cave into which he crawled to rest.
5. He had been there but a short time when

he was startled by a loud roaring outside. Lift-

ing his head, he saw an immense lion standing at
the mouth of the cave. It did not try to enter,
but held up one of its fore paws and roared as if
in great pain.

6. Androcles, made bold by despair, stepped
forward, and, taking the huge paw in his hand,

_ he pulled out the thorn that had caused so much

pain.
7. The moment it was removed, to his great
surprise, the noble animal knelt down, licked his

hands and feet, and tried, in every way, to show
his thanks.
8. The poor outcast was glad to make friends,

even with a wild beast. He felt no fear of him
after he had acted in this loving mannergiso

they both lay down and slept together, the slave
gently resting his hands upon the bruised paw.
9. When the day dawned, the lion went away

‘ in search of food, but the slave, fearing he might

be pursued, remained in the cave.

10. In a few hours the grateful lion returned,
bringing a wild animal he had killed; The slave
understood hismeaning. Taking his knife from
his pocket, he cut slices of raw meat and cooked
them before the ﬁre he had kindled.

11. For many weeks these two lived to-

getheiy the lion going daily in search of food and  

bringing it back for his comrade to share.
~ 12. It was while searching for prey that the

T lion was, at last, trapped. A deep hole had been

dug and, over this, branches of trees and loose
dirt had been thrown. The lion, not thinking of

  danger, walked proudly along, when, all at once,

, the earth gave way and he sank tothe ibottomccofi

As it will be necessary to devote but little time to the pre-
paration of the reading-lessons, the classiﬁed Words found at the
beginning of each will afford most proﬁtable busy Work. Pupils
should be required to Write these Words and place the accent
marks correctly, before their pronunciation is attempted. i

A “ Memory Gem ” will be found at the close of each lesson.
This should be read in connection with the lesson and, afterward,
copied and memorized by the pupils. .

A faithful adherence to the directions given _ in the Manual
and continued in this Reader cannot fail to lead pupils of all
nationalities into accurate pronunciation, which is as necessary
in conversation as in reading.   i

13. ‘ The men who had dug this trap, were
lying in wait to capture him. When the poor
slave came in search of his faithful friend, he, too,
was taken prisoner and borne back to slavery.

14. All this happened many years ago, in an
eastern country, whose people indulged in cruel
sports. They would gather in great crowds,
upon holidays, to see poor slaves tossed out for
hungry lions to tear to pieces.

15. It was at a time like this that the slave,
who had been captured, was to be thrown to the

largest lion that these unfeeling men could pro-  

cure. This wild beast had been kept without
food for many days. Their plan was to make
him very hungry so that he might, the more
eagerly, devour his prey.

16. But, when the poor victim was thrown
close to the hungry lion, great was the surprise of
the people to see that noble animal kneel down,
lick his hands and fondle him just as he used to
do when they lived in the cave together.

17. No danger of harm from him! He

remembered too well and was too grateful for a

past kindness; for they were, indeed, the same
comrades who had shared both couch and food

THE THIRD READER. 89

in their forest home.

18. This strange sight touched the hearts of

those who had gathered for EL wicked purpose.
They not only insisted that the slave should be
set free, but furnished money enough to build
him a house and a splendid cage for the lion.

19. There they spent their remaining days,
dividing their meals in the old,friendly way.

20. It was the man’s turn, now, to provide,
and, you may be sure, he took good care to furnish
just such food as suited the lion’s taste.

21. Thus we see that, by a little act of kind?

ness, the poor slave’s life was twice saved-—once
in the forest and again when he was thrown to
the wild beast to be devoured.

22. If kindness can tame even a ﬁerce lion,

should not children try its power daily among

themselves ?

“ Cast thy bread upon the waters
Thinking not ’tis thrown away;
God Himself hath said ’twil1 prosper,
At some time, some future day.”

WHAT THE CHOIR SANG.

A foolish little ‘maiden bought a foolish
little bonnet,  

With a ribbon and a feather, and a bit of

lace upon it ;

And, that the other maidens of the little
town might know it, ~

She thought she’d go to meeting the next
Sunday, just to show it.  

But though the little bonnet Was scarce
  larger than a dime,
To get it ﬁrmly settled, proved to be a Wor
of time;   '

iSo, When it Was fairly tied, all the bells

had stopped their ringing,
And, when she came to meeting, sure enough
the folks Were singing.

THE THIRD READER. 91

So this foolish little maiden stood and
waited at the door,
And she shook her ruffles out behind and

smoothed them down before.

“Hallelujalil Hallelujah!” sang the choir

above her head.
“Hardly knew you! hardly knew you I ”
were the words she thought they said.

This made the little maiden feel so very,
Very cross, _» .

That she gave her little mouth a twist and
her little head a toss;  

For she thought the Very hymn they sang
was all about her bonnet,

VVith a ribbon and a feather and a bit of
lace upon it.

And she did not wait to listen to the ser-
mon or the prayer,

But pattered down the silent street and E

hurried up the stair,

’Till she’d reached her little bureau, and g

in a band-box on it,
Had hidden, safe from critics’ eyes, her
