Iv RECOMMENDATIONS.

From Mr. ‘Henry Fisk, Instructor of schools in Concord.

I have examined with much attention Pike‘s Arithmctick simplified
by D. Leavitt, and think it the best calculated to facilitate the acqui-
sition of this important branch of literature, of any treatise I have
ever seen. I do cheerfully recommend it to the use ofschools, think-
ing that greater utility may arise from it, than any other Arithmetick
new in use. i HENRY FISK.

O Hopkinton, December 4, 1828.
DEAR Sm,--—-After a careful examination of your improved edition

of Pike‘s Arithmetick,I am decidedly of opinion there is no system,

now in use, betteér arrrauged than this, for an easy acquirement of a

correct and thorough knowledge of the .principles of arithmetick. In

all our schools, Leavitt"s improvements must be convenient for the in-
structor, and useful to the scholar. With great respect, I-am, Sir,
‘ Your obedient servant, MATTHEW HARVEY.

  __ , Fryeburg, Jan. 6, 1827.

DEAR Sm,-—-I have always entertained -a great fondness for the Sys-
tem ofArithmetick, published more than forty years ago by Nicolas
Pike, Esq. It is a work which brings to view great powers ofmind,
and displays deep mathematical research. This work has been abridg.
ed a number of times, and has appeared in different forms, and from
different presses ; yet still it has never in my opinion, promised so
much usefulness to the common school and academy, as it now does
from the hand of.Mr. Dudley Leavitt, “ Teacher ofMathematicks and
Natural Philosophy." The judicious arrangement of the whole, and
the notes and questions at the foot of its pages, much enhance the
value of the publication. , The «paper, the type and the execution
throughout reﬂect credit on the American Press.

1 am, dear sir, aﬁectionately your friend, AMOS J. COOK.

From. Benjamin Doe, Esq. Preceptor of Kingston ./lcademy.

Mr. Jacob B. IVIOOTB,---DEAR S1a,—-—'1‘he copy of your edition of

Pike‘s Arithmetick, which you were pleased to present me,l have
carefully examined. 1 have ever considered Pike‘s large work as the
most complete system ever published. llis abridgment has not, of late
years, been so much used. I think, that the improvements which have
been made in your edition of it, will render it much -more valuable ;
and they will again be the means of bringing the work into more gen-
eral use. The de-meonstrations and illustrations given in it, will make
the science more attrac—tive to the scholar. lwish you success in the
undertaking. Yours respectfully, ~ BENJAMIN LDOE.

When decimals or whole numbers are to be divided by 10, 100-,

separatrix, in the dividend, so many places toward the left hand, as

REDUCTION OF DECIMALS.
CASE 1.
“To reduce a vulgar fraction to its equivalent decimal.
RULE.
Divide the numeratorhy the denominator, as in Division of

Decimals, and the quotient will be the dechnal required. Or,
so many ciphers as you annex to the given numerator, so many

places must be pointed off in the quotient, and if there be not so
many places of ﬁgures in the quotient, the deﬁciency must be

supplied by preﬁxing so many ciphers before the quotient ﬁgures.

No'rn.—-—By annexing one, two, three, &.c. ciphers to the numera-

tor, the value of the fraction is increased ten, a hundred, &c. times.

After dividing, the quotient will of course be ten, a hundred, &c.
times too much; the quotient must therefore be divided by ten, a
hundred, «Sec. to give the true quotient or fraction. In the first exam-
ple, g is made ‘ °,-° °..~:1%5, which, divided by 1000, is -,3,‘-’553=.1£?Ev,

2. Opposite to each dividend, on the left hand, place. such 8.

3. Begin with the highest, and write the quotient of each
division as decimal parts on the right hand of the dividend next
below it, and so on, until they are ail used, and the last quotient
will be the decimal sought.

N o'rn.——The reason of the rule may be explained from the first
example: thus, three ifarthings are 31 of a penny, which, brought to
a decimal, is '75 ; cgseﬂuently, 8§d. may be expressed, 8-75d. but
8'75 is .§-1,7,-50. of a penniy.-:-.;-,-‘igg-5.,,. of a shilling, which, brought to a deci-

we write against 8 in the next line ; this quotient, viz. 8'75, being
pence and decimal parts of a penny, we divide them by 12, which
brings them to shillings and decimal parts ; we therefore divide by
20, and (there being no whole number) the quotient is decimal parts
of a phund. ‘

COMPOUND MULTIPLICATION.

COMPOUND MULTIPLICATION is the multiplying of sums of dif-
ferent denominations ; it is useful in ﬁnding the value of Goods,
&c. And, as in compound Addition, we carry from the lowest
denomination to the next higher, so we begin and carry in Com-
pound Multiplication; one general rule being to multiply the
price by the quantity.  

No'rn.—--The product of a number, consisting of several parts. or
denominations, by any simple numberwhatever, will be expressed by
taking the product of that simple number, and each part by itself, as
so many distinct questions: Thus, 331. 15s. 9d. multiplied by 5, will
be 1651. 75s. 45d.-‘=(by taking the shillings from the pence, and the
pounds from the shillings, and placing them in the shillings and pounds
respectively,) 1681. 18s. 9d. and this will be true when the multipli-

-cand is any compound number whatever.

-—4»0ﬂa«i-

THE SYSTEM or Aarrmnnrrcrc, of which this work is a new
and careful abridgment, has been so long an inmate of our acad~
emies and higher seminaries of learning, that its merits are fa-
miliar to all. Though numerous treatises on the subject have
successively appeared, since the work of PIKE was first publish-
ed,* few have been able to sustain even an ephemeral reputation,
excepting such as were built upon the labours of our author, yet
simpliﬁed in some of the more intricate parts. Excellent as that
work is acknowledged to have been, it had its defects ; espe-
Clally in its want 01 conformity to the federal notation, and 9r§,:m-
plicity, and attraction to the scholar, in a few of therules. An
abridgment was some years since published, in which little else
was done than to change the notation ;——.-and for want of that con.
ciseness in the fundamental rules, which some treatises of less
real merit possesseicli‘,’_”tl*_1'e book was superseded, and has been neg-
lected in this section of the’ country, even by those who ayow
their preference for Pil<e’s as a complete system.

At the suggestion of, several experienced teachers, the Pub-
lisher was induced to put to press a NEW ABRIDGIVIENT of Pike’s
Arithmetick, embracing all such portions of the original work as
should be necessary for the use of common schools, or of private
learners ; containing also, many new and practical illustrations of
the more important rules. For this purpose, several improve-
ments suggested by instructors of schools and academics have been

COMPOUND DIVISION.

COMPOUND Division is the dividing of numbers of diﬂ'erent
denominations : in doing which, always Begin at the highest, and
when you have divided that, if any thing remain, reduce it to
the next lower denomination, and so on, till you have divided the
whole, taking care to set down your quotient ﬁgures under their
respective denominaitionsﬁt

* To divide a number, consisting of several denominations by a simple number, is,
evidently, the same as dividing all the parts of which it is composed by the same simple
number. And this will be true, when any of the parts are not an exact multiple of the
divisor; for if the excess of that multiple has its pieper value in the next less denom-
ination, the dividend will still be divided into parts, and the true quotient will be found as

INTEREST.

INTEREST is a premiumallowed for the loan of money.

It is estimated at a certain number of dollars, pounds. 820. for
each hundred dollars, pounds, &c.for one year}; and in the same
proportion for a greater or less sum, or force longer or shorter
time. Hence, interest is said to be so much per cent.or per
centum, per annum.   E   .  

The terms used in interest are principal, rate, and amount.

The principal is the sum of money lent. V

The rate is the sumsallowegl ferthefuse of one hundred dollars

or pounds for one year.* s " L 
The amount is the sum of the principal and interest.
Interest is of two kinds, Simple and Compound.

V1 PUBLISHER’S NOTICE.

One great object in this abridgment has been to simplify the
general rules, by placing before the scholar their constituent parts
illustrated by plain and easy examples. In executing the work,
nothing superﬂuous has been added, and nothing omitted that
would contribute to perfect its design, and render it serviceable
to youth. Those, however, who are in the habit of teaching su-
perﬁcially, with the view of ﬂattering the pupil and the parent
with the mistaken idea of extraordinary progress, may proba-.
bly raise objections against the work, as containing too many things
to be committed to memory—--that they will burden and confuse the
mind of the scholar. Such persons have yet to learn the capaci-
ty of the young mind. For, though it may be true that a mass
of cmnplea: ideas crowded into the mind of a scholar would em-
barrass and perplex him-—it is equally true, that in proportion to
the number of simple propositions impressed upon the memory of
a child, will be the progress of his understanding in strength and
capacity.

‘Tn the arrangement of the present work, regard has been paid
to the natural dependence of the several parts upon each other.
Though in some instances, it differs from the common method, it
is believed to be the more correct and useful. Some of the old-
and obsolete rules of Tare and Trett, &c.,_ba,ve been omitted, and
the Duties and Custom-House Allowances lof our ownacountry
substituted. Several rules, such as Position, Alligation, Permu-

tation, &c. are inserted in this work, more for the purpose of grat-=.

ifying the curiosity and exercising the mind of the scholar, than
for their utility in business. The practical parts are those upon
which the greatest attention has been and should be bestowed ;
and it is upon the improvements in these generally, as wellias

upon the established character of the author, that the publisher‘:

rests his belief of the merits of this edition.

To ﬁnd the interest on bonds, notes of hand, &e. tvhen partial pay-
ments have been made, or endorsed on them.

RULE 1. Find the interest of the given sum to the ﬁrst pay-
ment, which either alone, or with any preceding payment, if
any, exceeds the interest due at that time, and add that interest
to the given sum.

RULE 2. From this amount subtract .the payment made at
that time with the preceding payments, if any, and the remain-
der will form a new principal ; the interest of which ﬁnd and
subtract as of the first su,hi,~and so on till the last payment.

No'rx~:.——This mode of computing interest, is established by law in
Massachusetts for making "up jiudgments on securities for money draw-
ing interest, and on which partial payments are endorsed. This mode
is the most equitable, because the payments are applied to keep down
the interest, no part of which, in this method of computation, forms
any part of theprincipal, drawing interest.

CoMroUNn INTEREST is that which arises from the interest
being added to the principal at the end of each year, and making
the amount the principal forthe next succeeding year.

' RULE.—--Find the interest of the given sum for one year, and
add it to the principal, the amount is the principal for the second
year ; then ﬁnd the interest of that amount, and add as before,
and thus proceed for any number of years required.

THE rule of Duodecimals is particularly useful to Workman
and Artiﬁcers, in casting up the contents of their Work.

The denominations are feet, inches or primes, seconds, thirds,
fourths, ﬁfths, &c. there being no limit to the division.

12 inches or primes - - 1 foot (ft)

Glaziers’ and Masons’ work is measured by the foot.

Painting, plastering, and paving are done by the yard. T

Partitioning, ﬂooring, slating, rough boarding, by the square of
100 feet.  

Stone and brick work by the rod of 16% feet, whose square is

RULE.

1. Under the multiplicand write the corresponding denomina-
tions of the multiplier.

2. Multiply each term in the multiplicand, beginning at the
lowest, by the feet in the multiplier, and write the result of each
under its respective term, observing to carry an unit for every
12, from each lower denomination to its superior.

3. In the same manner multiply the multiplicand, by the inches
in the multiplier, and write the result of each term in the multi-
plicand, thus multiplied, one place to the right hand in the product.

4. Proceed in the same manner with the other parts in the
multiplier, which if seconds, Write the result two places to the
right hand 3 if thirds, three places, :90. and their sum will be the
answer required. V

No'rn.--Feet multiplied by feet give feet--Feet multiplied by inch-
es give inches--Feet multiplied by seconds give secon.ds——Inches
multiplied by inches give seconds--—"lnches multiplied by seconds give

THE SINGLE RULE OF THREE.

THE Steam flute or THREE teaches how to ﬁnd a fourth num~
her, proportional to three numbers given ; for which reason it is
sometimes called the RULE or PROPORTION. It is called the
Rule of Three, because three terms or numbers are given, to ﬁnd
aqfourth. And because ofjts great and extensive usefulness, it is
often called the GOLDEN RULE. '

This Rule is usually considered as of two kinds, viz. Direct
and Inverse, : a distinction, howeveiywhich is totally useless, and
which has been avoided by some 0f>tl1‘e best writers. It may not
be ramiss, however, tvoexplain the ’il’ifi’eren‘ee usually uhtlersteed
between the two parts of this rule.     t

N The Rule of Three Direct is that in which ‘more requires more,
or less requires less. As in this ; if3 men dig 21 yards of trench
in ‘a certain time, how much will 6 men dig in the same time 3
Here more requires more, that is, 6 men, which are more than 3

992%. l/l;7Iialt are iue to understand by the Single Rule of Three ?--—-2“29. Why is vi‘:
called the Rule of Three, or the Golden Rule ’!-——-—-230. Is it Qfmorc kinds than one '3'

SINGLE RULE OF THREE. 131

men, will also perform more work in the same time. Or, when

it is thus 2. it‘ 6 men dig 42 yards, how much will 3 men dig in the

same time ? Here less requires less, for 3; men will perform
proportionably less work than5 men, in the same time. In hath
these cases, thwithie Rule, or the Proportion. is Direct = andthe
stating must he i
thus,  3 :21 : :6 : 42,
orthus, As 6 :42 : :3 : 21.

But the Rule of Three Inverse, is when more requires less, or

tess requires more. As in this : if 3 men dig a certain quantity
,-of trench in 14 hours, in how many hours will 6 men dig the hire
i,”<,1uantity 7*’ Here it is evident that 6 men, being more than 3, will

% erform an equal quantity of work in less time or fewer hours.-—
 _r thus: if 6'men’ perform a certain piece of work in 7 hours,

in how many hours will 3 men perform the same i? Herc less re»
quires more, for3 men will take more hours than 6 to perform the
same work. In both these cases then the Rule, or the Propor-
-tion, is Inverse  and the stating mustbe  
thus,As6 :14::3 : 7,
orthus,As3: 7 : :6 :14.

And in all these statin-gs, the fourth term is found, by multiply-
ingthe 2d and 3d terms together, and dividing the precinct by the
1st term. *

Of the three given numbers, two of them, contain the supposi-
tion, and the third a demand. And for stating and working ques-
tions of these kinds, observe the following  

GENERAL RULE.

 Write‘ that number which is of the same name or kind with
the answer or number required, for the second term.

2. Then consider whether the answer must be greater or less
than the second term. If the answer must be greater than the

second term, write the greater of the two remaining numbers on

the right for the third term, and the other on the left for the ﬁrs;
term ;——-but if the answer must be less’ than the second term,
write the less of the two remaining numbers on the right for the
tltird term, and the other on the left for the ﬁrst term.

3. Multiply the second  tlierrmsstogether, divide by the
first, and the quotient willbe the‘,s,Lanswer, ,to<”the question, which,

231.‘ i What is the nature 91’ these useless distincféieass ?-—--—-.23£'2. I-Vlzat is the general
rule for stating and pew;/‘arming all questions in simplepropooiiion 2 t

139 SINGLE RULE or THREE’.

(as also the remainder) will be in the same denomination in which
you left the second term, and may be brought into any other de-
nomination required.* ‘ ’

No'rE.---—The chief diﬂiculty that occurs in the Rule of Three, is the
right placing of the numbers, or stating of the question; this being
accomplished, there is nothing to do, but to multiply and divide, and
the work is done. , , K 

To this end the nature of every question must be considered, and
the circumstances on which the proportion depends, observed, and

common sense will direct this if the terms of the question be under--:

stood.

1. The fourth number is always found in the same name in which
the second is given, or reduced to; which, it‘ it be not the highest
denomination of its kind, reduce to the highest, when it can be done.

2. When the second number is of divers denominations, bring it tojf

the lowest mentioned, and the fourth it ill be found in the same name

 
 

..__ _..g

*This rule is founded on the obvious principle, that the magnitude or quantity of any
effect varies constantly in proportion to the varying part of the cause: Thus, the quan-
tity of goods bought, isin proportion to the money laid out ;-—the space gone over by to
uniform motion. is in proportion to the time, Sze.

It has been shewn in Multiplication of Money, that the price of one multiplied by the
quantity, is the price of the whole; and in Division, that the price of the whole divided
by the quantity, is the price of one; Now, in all cases of valuing goods, &c. where one
is the ﬁrst term of the proportion, it is plain, that the answer found by this rule, will be
the same as that found by Multiplication of Money; and where one is the last term of
the proportion, it will be the same as that found by Division of Money.

lnlike manner, if the ﬁrst term be any number whatever, it is plain that the product
ofthe second and third terms will be greater than the true answer required, by as much
as the price in the second term exceeds the price of one, or as the ﬁrst term exceeds» an
unit; consequently this product, divided by‘ the ﬁrst term, will give the true ianslyejr re,-
quired. I «

NOTE I.—- When it can be done, multiply and divide as in Compound Multiplication.
and Compound Division. A

2. If the ﬁrst term, and either the second or third can be divided by any number with—
out a remainder, let them be divided, and the quotient used instead of them.

[[?Thc following methods of operation, when they can be used, perform the work in a
much shorter manner than the general rule. 2

1. Divide the second term by the ﬁrst; multiply the quotient into the third, and the
product will be the ansyy/er. ,

’2. Divide the third term by the ﬁrst; multiply the quotient into the second, and the
product will be the answer.

32 Divide the ﬁrst. term by the second, and the third by that quotient, and the last quo-
tient will he the ansvw-l.‘i47§i~ 0 ‘

4. Divide the ﬁrstiterm by ithe thi*rd,aritl:,tl1e second bypthat quotient, and the last quo~
tient will be the answer’. " i i

terms together, 51:. produce the true answer '3

to which the second is reducednjvhich reduce back to the highest
ossible.

3. It the ﬁrst and third be of different names, or one or both of
divers denominations, reduce them both to the lowest denomination
mentioned in either.

4. When the product of the second and third is divided by the
ﬁrst; if there be a remainder, after the division, and the qnﬁtiexzt he
not the least denomination ofits kind; then multipiy the remainder
by that number, which one of the same denomination with the quo-
tient contains ofthe next less, andjdivide this product again by the
first number; and thus proceed till the least denomination bei found,
or till nothing itemain.

5. If theilirrst number be greater than the product of the second
and third ; then bring tliesecond to a lower denomination.

6. When any number of barrels, bales, packages or pieces are giv-
en, each containing an equal qtiantity, let the contents of one be re-
duced to the lowest’ name, and then multiplied by the given number
of packages or pieces. 

'7. If the given barrels, balesppieces, &.c. be*of unequal contents,
(as it most generally happens) putvthe separate content ofeach prop-
erly under one another, thenadd them together and you will have
the whole quantity.

8. When any of the terms are given in Federal Money, the ope»
ration is conducted in all respects as in simple numbers, observing only
to place the point or separatrix between dollars and cents, to point
off the results according to what has been taught already in Federal
Money, and Decimal Fractions. .

Pnoor.-—The method of proof is by inverting the question.
That is, put the fourth number, or answer, in the first place ; the
third in the second ; and the second in the third ; work as before
directed, and the quotient will be the first number. ‘

Signs.

5:: Two parallel horizontal lines are the sign of equality. It
shows that the number before, is equal in value to the num—
her after it. Example, 1 dollar-..:10O cents, is read thus,
1 dollar is equal to 100 cents.

+ Two short lines, crossing each other at right angles, are the
sign of Addition. It shows that numbers with this sign be-
tween them, are to be added together. Example, 5-1-7212,
is read thus, 5 added to 7, or 5 plus 7, is equal to 12.

~- A short horizontal line is a sign of Subtraction. It shows
that the number after it, is to be taken from the number
before it. Example, 12--J7.-:5, is read thus, 12 less ’7, or
12 minus 7, is equal to 5.

X Two short lines crossing each other in the form of an X, are
the sign of Multiplication. It shows that the number before
it, is to be multiplied by the number after it. Example,
6 X5:-.30, is read thus, 6 multiplied by 5, is equal to 30.

-‘,~ A short horizontal line between two points, is the sign of Di-
vision. It shows that the number heforegit, is to be divided
by the number after it. Example, 30-'.——6:::.5, is read thus,
30 divided by 6, is equal to 5.

' : Four double points or colons are the sign of Proportion-;  

and to show that numbers are proportional, they are Written
thus, 2 :4 1: 8 : 16, which are read, 2 is to 4 as 8 is to 16.

2 This sign signiﬁes the second power or square.
Ml“ This sign signiﬁes the third power or cube.

GENERAL METHOD OF MAKING TAXES.

RULE.——In the ﬁrst place an inventory of the value of all the es-
tates, both real and personal, and the number of polls for which
each person is rateable, must be taken in separate columns : the
most concise Way is then to make the total value of the inventory
the first term, the tax to be assessed the second, and $1 the third,
and the quotient will show the value on the dollar: 2dly, make
a table, by multiplying the value on the dollar by 1, 2, 3, 4,
&c.—-Sdly, From the inventory take the real and personal estates
of each man, and ﬁnd them separately in the table, which will
shew you each man’s proportional share of the tax for real and
personal estates.

N ore. If any part of the tax is averaged on the polls, or otherwise,
before stating, to ﬁnd the value on the dollar, you must deduct the sum
of the average tax from the whole sum to be assessed; for which av-
erage you must have a separate column, as well as for the real and
personal estates.

142 RULE OF THREE .DIREC'.£'.

RULE OF THREE DIRECT-

THE RULE or Tennis Dinner teaches, by having three num»
bers given, to ﬁnd a fourth, which shall have the same ratio to
the second, as the third has to the first.

RULE.

1; State the question by making that number, which asks the
qUBSttOl1,*tlfie‘thi1‘Htél‘fII ; that which is of the same name or
kind, the ﬁrst term ; and that which is of the same name orlrind
with the answer, the second term.

2. Multiply the second and third terms together, and divide the
product by the ﬁrst term, and the quotient will be the fourth
term, or answer. -

The notes under the general rule are applicable to this rule.

EXAMPLES.

1. If 3 bushels of corn be worth $1480, what is the value of 12
bushels ? .

bu.  0., bu.
3 : 1'80 : : 12
12
3)21oo
\ $7-20 Ans.

In this example, 12 bushels asks the question, and is made the
third term ; 3 bushels being of the same name, is made the ﬁrst term;
and $1.80 being of the same name with the answer, is made the se-
cond term. Here the third term is greater than the ﬁr.-st, and the
question evidently requires the fourth term or answerito be greater
than the second; therefore, the question belongs to the Rule of Three
Direct. ‘ i ‘ V

2. If 6 lbs. sugar cost 103., what will 33 lbs. cost at the same rate 2
’ Ans. £2 l’5s.

 

* The term which asks or moves the question has generally some words like these be-
fore it, viz. What will ? What cost ? How many? ‘How far? How much? How
long? écc.

ARITHMETICK.

 

ARITHMETICK is the science of Numbers ;* and comprises the
i‘0llOWi’ng,fpI'l!lClpal rules, viz. I. NOTATION, or NUMERATION;
‘II. ADDITION ; III. SUBTRACTION ; IV. MULTIPLICATION ; and
V. DIVISION. The four last are called simple, when the num-
bers are all of one denomination ; compound, when the numbers
are of different denominations.

These ‘ﬁve rules are called principal or fundamental, because
the whole art of arithmetick is comprehended in their various
operations.

N UMERATION .

1. N UMERATION teaches us to read or write any sum or num~

Cipher. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

 1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

2. The value of a figure, when alone, is called its simple value,
and is invariable. Figures have also a local value, which varies

 

__..—......__. ..._.._..._......_...._...~

4* Number is either a unit, or a collection of units. A single thing is a unit; or one.
One and one are two. One and two are three. And thus, by constant addition, all
numbers are generated. .

-l These figures, which are of Arabic or Indian origin, wereﬁntroduced into Europe ‘.3
the Moors, agent the year 1150; they were formerly all called ciphers, whence it came
to pass that the art of arithmetick was ‘called ciphcring.

RULE.

1. State the question, by placing the three conditional terms
in such order that that number which is the cause of gain, loss, or
action, may possess the first place ; that which denotes space of
time, or distance of place, the second ; and that which is the gain,
loss, or action, the\third

2. Place the other two terms, which move the question, under
those of the same name.

3. Then, if the blank place, or term sought, fall under the
third place, the proportion is direct, therefore, multiply the
three last terms together, for a dividend, and the other two for a
divisor ; then the quotient will be the answer.

4. But if the blank fall under the ﬁrst or second place, the
proportion is inverse, wherefore multiply the first, second and
last terms together, for a dividend, and the other two, for a divi-
sor ; the.quotient will be the answer.*

145 CONJOINED PROPORTION.

CON JOIN ED PROPORTION.

Coruorrmn PROPORTION is when the coins, weights or meas—
ares of several countries are compared in the same question ; or,
in other words, it is joining many proportions together, and by the
relation which several antecedents have to their consequents,
the proportion between the first antecedent and last consequent
is discovered, as well as the proportion between the others in
their several respects.

Nora.---This rule may generally be abridged by cancelling equal
quantities or numbers that happen to be the same in both columns ;
and it may be proved by as many statings in the Single Rule ofThree
as the nature of the question may require.

CASE I.

When it is required to ﬁnd how many of theﬁrsz sort of coin, weight
or measure, mentioned in the question, are equal to a given .quanti+
ty of the last. i

RULE.--—Place the numbers alternately, that is, the antece-—

dents at the l ft hand, and the consequents at the right, and write
the last number on the left hand ; then multiply all the numbers
in the left hand column continually together for a dividend ; and
all the numbers in the right hand column for a divisor ; divide,
and the quotient will be the answer.

154 SINGLE FELLOWSHIP.
FELLOWSHIP.

FELLOWSHIP is a rule by which the accounts of several mer-
chants or other persons, trading in partnership, are so adjusted,
that each may have his share of the gain, or sustain his share of
the loss, in proportion to his share of the joint stock and the time
of its continuance in trade.

N o'rr:.i By this rule, a bankrupt‘s estate may be divided among his
creditors.

SINGLE FELLOWSHIP.

SINGLE Fr.LLowsH1r is, when the stock of each of the several
partners is continued in trade the same length of time.

RULE .

As the whole amount of stock, is to the whole gain or loss, so is
each man’s stock, to his share of the gain or loss.*

PRO~0F.——-Add all the shares of the gain or loss together ; and
if the work be right, the sum will be equal to the whole gain or
loss.

EXAMPLES.

1. A, B. and C traded in partnership. A put into the stock 400
dollars. B put in 300 dollars, and C put in 200 dollars ; they gained
270 dollars : what was each man*s share of the gain in proportion to
what he put in?

* That their gain or loss, in this Rule, is in proportion to their stocks, is evident: For
as the times, in which the stocks are in trade, are equal, if I put in one half of the whole
stock. I ought to have one half of the gain ; if my part of the stock be onefonrth, my
share of the gain or loss ought to he one fourth also. And generally the same ratio that
the whole stock has to the whole gain or loss, must each person’s particular stock have to
his respective gain or loss.

DOUBLE FELLOWSHIP.

DOUBLE FELLOWSHIP, or Fellowship with time, is when the
stocks of partners are continued unequal times.

RULE.-—-—Multiply each man’s stock by the time it was contin-
ued in trade. Then, As the whole sum of the products is to the
whole gain or loss, so is each man’s particular product to his par-
ticular share of the loss or gain.*

EXAMPLES.

”l. A, B, and C traded in company. A put in 400 dollars, for 9

CUSTOM A HOUSE AI..l.O‘&Va.\NCES.

THE only allowances which are made in the weight of‘ goods,
at the Custom-Houses of the United States, are tare, and ciraft or
scalage.

Tare is an allowance made for the weight of the box, bag,
hogshead, cask. &c. whieli contains the goods, and it is either at
so much per cent. or at so much per box, Ste. or the real or ac-
tual tare.

Draft or scalage is an allowance of  per cent. on the whole
gross Weight of all goods, except tea and sugar, which is to be
deducted before casting the tare.

On tea, no draft is allowed. On sugar, there is a deduction to
be made for draft or scalage, before casting the taae, of 7 pounds
on every hogshead, 4 pounds on every tierce, 2 pounds on every
barrel, and 4 pounds on every Havanna box.

Gross weight is the whole weight of any kind of goods, together
with the box, bag, or cask, &e. which contains them.

.Net weight is the weight of the goods after all allowances have
been deducted.

DISCOUNT.

DISCOUNT is an allowance made for the payment of any sum of

money belore it becomes due ; or it is the difference between

any sum due at some future time, and its present worth.

The present worth of any sum, or debt, due at any future time,
is such a sum, as if put at interest, would in that time and at-the
rate per cent. for which the discount is to be made, amount to the
givensum or debt. -

RULE.

1 . As the amount of $100 or £100 at a given rate and time,
is to the interest of 53100 or £100 at the same rate andtime, so is
the given sum to the discount. n

Subtract the discount from the given sum, and the remainder
is the present worth.

2. As the amount of $100 or £100 atthe given rate and time,
is to $100 or £100, so is the given sum to the present worth.

Subtract the present Worth from the given sum, and the re»
mainder is the discount.*

* That an allowance ought to be made for the payment of money before it becomes».-
due, which is supposed to -hear no interest until after it is due, is very reasonable ; and
this allowance ought to be such a sum. as, being put at interestuntilthe tlebtvbecomes due
would amount to the interest of the debtfor the same time.

The reason of the rule is evident from the nature of simple interest; for since the
debt may be considered as the amount of some principal (called here the present worth}
at a certain rate per cent. for thegiven time. that amount must be in the same proportion
either to its principal or interest, as the amount of any other sum at the same rate and
for the same time, is to its principal or interest.

N o'rE.-—The only correct principle of calculating discount is
by the preceding rule ; yet banks and commercial persons, in dis-
counting notes, &c. deduct the interest for the time (including the
days of grace) for the discount. When discount is made for pres-
ent payment without any regard to time, the int-erest of the sum
For one year is the discount.

BARTER.

BARTER is the exchanging of one commodity for another, and
teaches merchants so to proportion» their quantities, that neither
shall sustain loss.*

Pnoor.-—By changing the order of the question.

RULE.

1. When the quantity of ’ one commodity is gioen with its value or
the value of its integer, as also the value of the integer of some other
commodity to be exehawtged for it, to ﬁnd the quantity of this commodity.
Find the value of the commodity of which the quantity is given,
then ﬁnd, how much of the other commodity at the rate proposed
may be had for that sum.

2. When the quantities of two commodities areogii-enyand the rate
of selling them, to ﬁnd, in case of inequality, how muchof some other
commodity must be given.--Find the separate values of the two giv-
en commodities ;__ subtract the less from the greater. and the dif-

EQUATION OF PAYM EN TS.

EQUATION or PAYMENTS is the ﬁnding of a time to pay at once‘,
several debts due at different times, so that neither party shall
sustain loss.

ItUr.E.——Multiply each payment by the time at which it is due ;:
then divide the sum of the products by the sum of the payments,
and the quotient will be the equated time.*

:._='_‘$ 

“ This rule is founded on a supposition, that the sum of the interests of the several
debts which are payable before the equa*etl time. from their terms to that time. is equal
to the sum ofthe interests ofthe debts payable after the t quated time. from that to their
terms ; but this is not correct, for by keeping a debt unpaid after it is due, the interestof
itis gained for that time; but by paying a debt before it is due, the payer does not lose,
the interest for that time. but the discount only, which is less than the interest; there-
fore. the rule is not accurately true; however in most questions which occur in‘ busi-
nels, the errour is do triﬂing, that it wil‘~. generally be made use of as the most eligible
method.

6 months, and of 120 dollars for 22 months, to a fourth number, which
added to the 6 months, will give the time for which the 60 dollars
ought to be retained.

133 INVOLUTIOLUTION.
IN VOLU T ION.

INvoLti"t‘IoN is the method of ﬁndingpthe powers of numbers.

Powers of numbers are the‘ products arising from the continual
multiplication of numbers into themselves. ’

Any numbermay itself be called the root or first power. If the
ﬁrst power be multiplied by itself, the product is called the
second power, or the square ; if the square be multiplied by the
ﬁrst power, the product is called the!/z_’i1‘cl power, or the cube ,-
if the cube be multiplied by the ﬁrst power, the product is called
the fourth power, or the biquadrate, &c. =.

Thus 4 is the root or 1st power of 4.
. 4x4:16 is the 2d power, or the square of 4. :42
4><4><4:64 is the 3d power, or the cube of 4. :43
4x 4x 4)-( 4:-.256 is the 4th power,or the biquadrate of4,&c.:-4‘

The small ﬁgure points out the order, of the power, and is
called the In.de:e,'or Exponent.

Rule for ﬁnding the powers of numbeis.

Multiply the given number, or ﬁrst power, continually by itself‘,
till the ‘number of multiplications be oneless than the index of
the power to be found, and the last product will be the power
required. ,

Nona.--The powers of vulgar fractions are found by raising each
of their terms to the power required. If the power of a mixed
number he required, either reduce it to an improper traction, orare~
duce the vulgar fraction to a decimal.

EVOLUTION.

EvoLU'rroN, or the extraction of roots, is the operation by
which we ﬁnd any root of any given number.

The root is a number Whose continual multiplication into itself
produces the power; and is denominated the square, cube, biquar
drate, or 2d, 3d, ' 4th root, 8Lc. accordingly as it is, when raised
to the 2d, 3d, 4th, &.c. power, equal‘t“b“ that power. Thus, 4‘ is
the square root of 16, because 4x4:-.16. 4 also is the cube

no SQUARE noor.

There is no number of which we cannot ﬁnd any power ex-
actly ; but tlfere are many numbers, of which the exact roots
can never be obtained. Yet, by the help of decimals, we can
obtain these roots to any necessary degree of exactness.

Those roots which cannot be exactly obtained, are called snrd
roots ; and those which can be found exactly, are called rationaf
roots.

Roots are sometimes denoted by writing this character V be-
fore the power, with the index of the power over it ; thus the

cube root of 64 is expressed 53/ 64, and the square root of 64 is

expressed V 64, the index 2 being omitted when the square root
15 required.

-IIIOOO«--

EXTRACTION on THE SQUARE noor.

THE EXTRACTION on THE SQUARE Roor is the method of ﬁnd-

ing a number, which, being multiplied by itself, shall produce the
given number.

RULE.

1. Distinguish the given number into periods of two ﬁgures
each, by putting a point over the place of units, another over
the place of hundreds, and so on, which points show the number
of ﬁgures the root will consist of.

2. Find the greatest square number in the ﬁrst, or left hand
period ; place the root of it at the right hand of the given num-
ber, (after the manner of a quotient in division,) for the‘ﬁrst
ﬁgure of the root, and the square number under the period, then
subtract it therefrom, and to the remainder bring down the next
period for a dividend.

3. Place double of the root, already found, on the left hand
of the dividend for a divisor.

4. Seek how often the divisor is contained in the dividend,
(except the right hand ﬁgure,) and place the answer in the root
‘for the second ﬁgure of it, and likewise on the right hand of the
divisor ; multiply the divisor with the ﬁgure last annexed by the
ﬁgure last placed in the root, and subtract the product from the
dividend : to the remainder join the next period fora new dividend.

5. Double the ﬁgures already found in the root, for a new di-
visor, (or bring down your last divisor for a new one, doubling the
right hand ﬁgure of it.) and from these, ﬁnd the next ﬁgure of the
root as last directed, and continue the operation in the same
manner, till you have brought down all the periods.*'‘

cu-:.—_——

* The rule for the extraction of the square root may be illustrated by attending to the
process by which any number is raised to the square. The several products of the mul-
tiplication are to be kept separate, as in the proof of the rule for multiplication of ‘sim-
ple numbers. Let 37 be the number to be raised to the square.

37X37=l3iS9::'_"-'-_.._37)(37

Now it is evident that 9, in the place of hundredths, is the greatest square in this
product; put its root, 3, in the quotient, and 900 is taken from the product. The next
products are '*Zl+21:'2)(3)(7. for a dividend. Double the root already found, and it is
2X3. for a divisor, which gives '1 for the quotient, which‘*annexed to the divisor, and the
whole then multiplied by it, gives 2)<3X7(:_"42)+7x7(=49) which, placed in their
proper places, completely exhausts the remainder of the square. The same may be
shown inany other case, and the rule becomes obvious.

Perhaps the following method may be considered more simple and plain. Let-
37-_-:30+7, be multiplied as in the demonstration of multiplication of simple numbers,
and the products kept separate.

SQUARE ROOT. 173

,Now, suppose you have 144 square pieces of wood, and wish to
know how many pieces would be on a side, were the whole arranged
into a square form. To determine this, you must extract the square
root, 144; the first step of which is to point off the number into periods
of two ﬁgures each. This shows how many ﬁgures the root will con-
sist of, and is done on this principle, that the product of any two num-
bersbcan have, at most, but as many places of figures, as are in both
the factors, and at least but one less.

The left hand period being 1,

144(1 t the “~*stquare of it will  1, and
1' lilcietvisethe root will be 1. ‘ Biit
.,......; as we have nothingtto do at pres-
44 ent with the right h‘i-and period,

  A we wilr,l,__0mit"it, andconsider only
Fig.’ ,1,_ the left hand period‘, which being

in the‘ place ofhundletisﬁnust be
called? 100; lwence the operation,
at present, will be to find the
square root of 100. ‘ ”’I’he root of
1,  1’,-but as there are «t-w-,0 peri-
ods in 106), there wilt be two ﬁg-
ures in its root, and as the ﬁgure
already obtained in the root is
yeqjualito its period, there is noth-
ing remaining for the next peri-
od; and as the next period con-
sists wholly of ciphers, the next
figure of the root will be as ci-
pher, so that the root of 100 is
10. By this process we have
disposed of 1.00 of the pieces into
the tbrrn represented, by Fig. 1, viz. 10 pieces on a side.

The reason for placing the square number underneath the period,
and subtracting it from the period, as directed in the rule, is as fol-
lows. When We have obtained the root of the left hand period, we‘
have disposed of as many pieces as the greatestsquare ofthe left hand
period represents, and by subtracting the square of the root from
its period, we make it smaller by as many as the square of the root
represents; thus in the example given, 1 in the quotient represents
10, the square of which is 180, which 1, under the left hand period,
represents. This, subtract_ed from the left hand period, leaves 44;
so that 100 pieces have been disposed of as represented by Fig. 1. and
44 pieces are now to be added to it. in such manner that the square
form will be preserved. To (lo tliis, the rule directs to “place the
ﬁliouble o’f’ the root _a.lrc.adyja-and on the left hand‘ of the dividend for a

A block of wood, or any solid body, having six equal sides, all ex»
actly square, isa CUBE; the root of which is the measure in length of
one of its sides.   To gain a distinct understanding of the subject, let
the scholar provide himself with little blocks of wood, and build
them up into a cubick form, according to the rule.

First make a cubick block of any given size, and mark it with the
letter A. Then make three other blocks ofa square form, of an in-
deﬁnite thickness, but all equal to each other, each of which will just
cover one side of the block A, and mark them B, C and D. Place
these blocks on three adjoining sides of the block A, when there will
be deﬁciencies at the three points where the blocks B, C and D meet.
These deﬁciencies must be ﬁlled with three other blocks, each of
which must be just equal in length to one side of the block A, and
mark these blocks with E, F and G. When the blocks E, F, G are
put in their places, there will be a deﬁciency at the place “here
the ends of these blocks meet. This deﬁciency must he ﬁlled with
another block, which mark H. To illustrate the rule, take the fol»-
lowing number. ‘

10648(2

‘In the.. ﬁrst place Iseek the greatest cube in the left hand period,
and place its root, 2, in the quotient. The cube of 2 is 8, whichl
place under the left hand period, and subtract it therefrom, which
leaves a remainder of 2}. Now as there are two periods in the given
number, there must be 2 ﬁgures in the root, consequently, 2, in the
quotient, does not express 2, merely, but 20 ; and the cube of 20 is
8000, which 8, under the period 10, represents ; thus 8000 of the
parts of 10648, are disposed of into acubick body, the length of each
side of which is equal to 20 of those parts, and to render the ex-
planation more plain, we will consider these parts as cubick feet, so
that each side of this body is 20 feet square, and this body we will
have represented by the block A. Now as each side of this block
is 20 feet square, there are 400 feet on each side of it. Now SQOO
feet are disposed of in this block, consequently, there are 2648 cubick
feet to be added to the block A, in such a manner, that its cubick
form will be preserved. To do this, the additions must be made to
three sides of the block, and these additions are represented by the
blocks B, C and D, each of which containing 400 feet, the sum of
the whole is 1200. Thus it is evident, that if there were 1200 feet
more, there would be just enough to cover three sides of the block
A ; and it is to ﬁnd the contents of these three sides, that the rule
directs to '-‘ multiply the square of the quotient by 300." The square
of the quotient shows the superﬁcial contents of one side ofthe block
A. viz 400, for 2 in the quotient is in reality 20, and 20><20=—"400, and

128O divisor.

The rule directs to ‘‘ multiply the quotient by 30.” This is to ob-
tain the con-tertsgof the blocks E, F and G, and the sum of these is
taken thr :2. divisor, because the number of times the divitlend cen-
tuins the divisor, will be equal to the number of feet», the additions
to the block, A. are in thickness.

The rule next directs to “ multiply the triple square by the last quo-
tientjigm'e.” N ow the triple square’ represents the superﬁcial con-
tents of the three blocks B, C and D, and the last quotient ﬁgure
shows the thickness of those blocks, consequently, multiplying the
triple square by the last quotient ﬁgure, gives the cubick contents of
those blocks; Then the rule directs to 7“ m'ultz'-ply the square qf the
last quotient ﬁgure by the triple quot’ientL" Now the triple qtu-otient is
the length of the blocks E, F and G, and the quotient figure shows
their breadth, and their tihickness; hence, multiplying theisquare of
the last quotient ﬁgure by the triple quotient, gives the c"ubi;ck con-
tents of these blocks. Next we are directed to cube the last quotient
ﬁgure. This cube shows the cuhick contents of the block ii, and the’
sum of these is equal to the cuhick contents of the blocks B, C and D ;
and E, F and G.

* The solid. called :1 cube, has its length and breadth ._and height all equal. As the
number of solid feet, inches, &c. in a cube are found by muhiplying theheight and
leng;1’and breadth together; that is, by multiplying. one shit: into itself twice. the thin!
power of a number is called the cube of that number. The solid contents of similar
ﬁgmes are in propouion to each other, as the cubes of their similar sides or diameters.

RULES.

1. The number ofa letter is doubled as often as it is repeated ;
thus, 1, represents one ; II,two 3 X, ten ; XX, twenty ; XXX,
thirty. r
2. A less literal number placed after a greater, augments the
value of the greater 3 it’ put before, it diminishes it. Thus, VI,
is-6 ; IV, is 4; XI, is 11 ; IX, is 9, &c.

ADDITION.

Annirron is the putting together of two or more numbers, or
sums, to make them one total or whole sum.

, SILft"5PLE\\ADDI'[‘ION

Is the adding of several ﬂlll'llii'{‘,l‘S together, which are all of
one sort, or kind ; as, '7 pounds, 12 pounds, and 20 pounds, being
added together, make a sum total, or aggregate, of 39 pounds.

RULE.

Place units under units, tens under tens, &c.: draw a line
underneath, and begin with the units : After adding up every
figure in that column, consider how many tens are contained in
their sum, and placing the excess under the units, carrying so ma~
ny as you have tens to the next column of tens : Proceed in the
same manner through every column or row, and set down the
Whole amount of the last row.*

PROOF.

Begin at the top of each column, and add the ﬁgures downe
wards, in the same manner as they were added upwards, and, if
it be right, this aggregate will be equal to the first amount. Or,
cut off the upper line of figures, and ﬁnd the amount ofthe rest ;
then if this amount and upper line, when added together, be equal
to the sum total, the work is supposed to be right.

 
 

 
 

9* This ruleis founded on the known axiom,that “the whole is equal to the sum of all
its parts ” The method of placing the numbers, and carrying for tens, is evident from
the nature of notation ; for any other disposition ofthe numbers would alterrthcir value;
and carrying 1 for every 10, from an inferior to a superior denomination, is evidently
right ; because one unit in the latter case is equal to the value of ten units inthe former.

A GENERAL RULE FOR EXTRACTING THE ROOTS.
OF ALL POWERS.*

1.; Prepare the given number for extraction, by pointing off
from the units’ place, as the required root directs.

2. Find the first ﬁgure of the root by trial, or by inspection
into a table ofpowers, and subtract its power from the left hand
period of the given number.

3. Tothe remainder bring down the first ﬁgure in the next pe-
riod, ‘and call it the dividend. 4

4. Involve the root to the next inferior power to that which is
given, and multiply it by the number denoting the given power,
for a divisor.   O

5. Find how many times the divisor may be had in the divi-
dend, and the quotient will be another ﬁgure of the root.

6. Involve the whole root to the given power, and subtract it
always from as many periods of the given number as you have

found periods in the root.

* The roots ofmost powers may be found by the square and cube root Only; therefore
when any even power is given, the easiest method wiil be (especially in u very high
power.) to extract the square root of it, which reduces it to half the given power ; then
the square root of that power reduces itto half the same power; and so on till you come
to a square or cube.

For example; suppose a twelfth power be given; extracting the square root of the

twelfth power reduces it to a. sixth power ; and extracting the square root of the sixth
power reduces it to a cube.

ALLIGATION,

ALLIGATION is the method of mixing two or more simples ofdif-n
ferent qualities, so that the composition may be of a mean or mid-
dle quality ; it consists of two kinds, viz. Alligation Medial and
Alligation Alternate.   t

T

ALLIGATION MEDIAL,

Is when the quantities and prices of several things are given, toﬁnd the
mean price of the mixture compounded of those things.

RULE.

As the sum of the quantities, or the whole composition, is to

the whole value ; so is any part of the composition to its mean
price or value.

Ans. 203.33 carats ﬁne.

ALLIGATION AL'I‘l3lRNA'I‘E

Is the method of ﬁnding what quantity of each of the ingredi-
ents, whose rates are given, will compose a mixture of a given
rate : So that it is the reverse of Alligation Medial, and may be
proved by it.

 

* If an ounce or any other quantity of pure gold be divided into 24 equal parts. these
parts are called carats, but gold is often mixed with some baser metal, which is called
the alloy, and the mixture is said to be so many carats fine, according to the proportion
of pure gold contained in it ; thus, if 22 carats of pure gold and 12' of alloy be mixed
together, it is said to be 22 carats ﬁne.----See page 43

300. What is ./Illigation Alternate '3

ALLIGATION ALTERNATE. [37
CASE 1.

When the mean rate of the whole mixture, and the ‘ rates of all the
ingredients are given, and the quantity not limited.

RULE.

1. Place the several rates or prices of the simples, being re-
duced to one denomination, in a column under each other, and the
mean price reduced to the same denomination,,at the left hand.

2. Connect with a continued line the price of each simple or
ingredient, which is less than that of the mean rate, with one. or
any number of those, which are greater than the mean rate ; and
each greater rate or price with one, or any number of the less. A

3. Place the difference between the mean price (or mixture
rate). and that of each of the simples, opposite to the rates with
which they are connected.

4. Then, if only one difference stand against any rate, it will
be the quantity belonging tothat rate ; but if there be several,
their sum will be the quantity.’“‘ i

EXAMPLES.

1. A merchant has spices, some at ls. 6d. a lb. some at 2s. some at.
4s. and some at 5s. a lb. :, How much of each sort must he mix, that

he may sell the mixture at 3s. 4d.ra lb. '2

* By connecting the less rate to the greater,.and« placing the difference between them
and the mean rate alternately, the quantities resulting are such, that there is precisely
as much gained byone quantity as is lost by t-he other, and therefore the gain and loss
upon the whole are equal, and are exactly the proposed rate.

In like manner, let the number of simples be what it may, and with how many so-
ever each one is linked, since it is always a less with a greater than the mean price,
there will be an equal balance of loss and gain between every two, and consequently
an equal balance on the whole.

If any of the simples be of little or no value with respect to the rest, its rate is sup-
posed to be nothing; as water mixed with wine, and alloy with gold or silver.

Dounns POSITION teaches to resolve questions by making two
suppositions of some convenient numbers. >

Those questions, in which the results are not proportional, to
their positions, belong to this rule : such are those, in which the
number sought is increased or diminished by some given number,
which is no known part of the number required.

RULE.*

t ¥ The rule is founded on this supposition, that the first error is to the second, as the
difference between the true and first supposed number is to the diﬁerenee between the
true and second supposed number: When that is not the case, the exact answer to the

great, divide the difference of the products by the difference of
the errours, and the quotient will be the answer.

5. Ifthe errours be unlike; that is, one too small, and the
other too great, divide the sum of the products by the sum of the

GAU GIN G.

GAUGING is the art of measuring all kinds of casks or vessels
used forliquor, and of determining the quantity they will contain.

The instruments used in gauging are the gauging rod, callipers,
the sliding rule, and Gunter’s scale.

RULE.

Take the dimensions of the cask in inches, viz. the diamet  at
the bung and head, and the length of the cask ; subtract the head
diameter from the bung diameter, and note the difference.

If the staves of the cask be much curved or bulging between
the bung and head, multiply the difference between the bung and
head diameter by -'7 5 if not quite so much curved, by -65 ; if
they curve yet less, by -6 ; and if they are almost or quite straight,
by ~55, and add the product to the head diameter, the sum will
be a mean diameter, by which the cask is reduced to a cylinder.

31!. What is Gauging ?— 312. What are the rulesfor measuring casks, a.nd_/ind-.
ing their contents in gallons '2

I 9 6 GAZULHNG“

Square the mean diameter, thus found, then multiply it by the

. length ; divide the product by 294 for wine, or by 359 for ale or
beer, and the quotient will be the content in gallons.  

Nora 1.4--These divisors are found by dividing’231 and 282 by
.’7854.—-If the square of the mean diameter be multiplied by .7854
and the product multiplied by the length, the last product will be the
content in cubic inches, which being divided by 231 for wine, or by
282 for ale or beer, the quotient will be the content in gallons.

,. NOTE 2.--—The length and head diameter are usually taken by cal-
lipers, allowing for the thickness of both heads, 1 inch, 1:} inch, or
2 inches, according to theasize of the cask.

The head diameter must be taken close to its outside,and for small
casks, add 3 tenths of an inch ; for casks of 30, 40, or 50 gallons, 4
tenths ; and for larger casks 5 or~.6 tenths; and the sum will be very
nearly the head diameter within.

The bung diameter is usually talreniby the gauging rod, and in tak-
ing it, observe by moving the rod backward and forward, whether
the stave, opposite the bung, be thicker or thinner than the rest, and
if it be, make allowanceaccordiegly.

EXAMPLE.

What is the content in wine, and ale or beer gallons, of a cask,
whose bung diameter is 35 inches, head diameter 27 inches, and
length 45 inches ?

MECHANICAL POWERS. ,9,-7

MECHANICAL nmwnas.

or THE LEVER on srnnnmun.

It is a principleiin mechanics, that the power is to the weight,
as the velocity of the weight, is to the velocity of the power.

Therefore, to ﬁnd what weight maybe raised or balanced by any
given power, say ; ,

As the distance between the body to be raised or balanced, and
the fulcrum or prop, is to the distance between the prop and the
point where the power is applied ; so is the power to the weight
which it will balance.

If a man weighing 160 lbs. rest on the end ofa lever 10 feet long,
what weight. will he balance on the other end ; supposing the prop
one foot from the weight. _ V

The distance between the weight and the prop being 1 foot, the
distaucefrom the prop to the power is 1G--l===9 feet ; therefore, as
1 foot : 9 feet ,: : 160 lbs. ; 1440 lbs. Ans. .

In giving directions for making a chaise, the length of the shafts
between the axletree and backhand, being settled at 9 feet, a dispute
arose whereabout on the shafts the centre of the body should be ﬁxed.
The chaisemaker advised to place it 30 inches before the axletree’ ;
others supposed 20 inches would be a suﬂicient incumbrance for the
horse: Now supposing two passengers to weigh 33b pounds, and the
body of the chaise 84 pounds more; what will the beast in both these
cases bear more than his harness? K A

or run WHEEL AND AXLE.

The proportion for the wheel and axle (in which the power is
applied to the circumference of the wheel, and the weight is
raised by a rope, which coils about the axle as the wheel turns
round) is as the diameter of the axle is. to the diaineter of the
wheel, so is the power applied to the wheel, to the “Weight sus-

RULE.

Find the circumference of the circle described by the end of
the lever; then, as that circumference is to thefﬁdistance be-
tvteen the spiral threads of the screw ; so is the weight to be
raised. to the power which will raise it, abating the friction
which is not proportional to the quantity of surface, but to the
weight of the incumbent part ; and, at a medium, 1} part of the
effect of the machine is destroyed by it, sometimes more and

[After ‘the scholar, male or female, has acquired a competent knowledge of Arithmetick, or of its:
fundamental rules, instruction inthe mode of keeping accounts should be attended to. By this it
is not meant to recommend that the son or daughter of every farmer, mechanick, or shop keeper
should enter deeply into the science as practised by the merchant, engaged in extensive business,
for such study would engross a great portion of time which might be more usefully employed in
acquiring a proper knowledge of a trade or other employment.

Persons employed in the common business of life, who do not keep regular accounts, are sub-

jected to many losses and inconveniences ; to avoid which, the following simple and correct plan
is recommended for their adoption.

Let a small book be made, or a few sheets of paper sewed together, and ruled after the examples
given in this system. In the book, termed the Day-Book, are duly to be entered, daily, all the
transactions of the master or mistress of the family, which require a charge to be made, or a credit
to be given to any person. No article thus subject to be entered, should on any consideration, be
deferred till another day. Great attention should be given to write the transaction in a plain
hand ; the entry should mention all the particulars necessary to make it fully understood with
the time when they took place; and if an article he delivered, the name of the person to whom
delivered is to be mentioned. No scratching out may be suﬁeretl; because it is sometimes done
for dishonest purposes, and will weaken or destroy the authority of your accounts. But if, through
mistake, any transaction should be wrongly enter ed, the error must be rectified, by a new entry ;
and the wrong one may be cancelled by writing the word Error, in the margin.

_A book, thus fairly kept, will at all times show the exact state of a person’s affairs, and have
great weight. should there at any time be a necessity ofyproducing it in a court ofjustice.

The instructer, who feels a parental solicitude for the permanent welfare of his pupils, cannot in
any way so much contribute to their success in life, with so little trouble, as to teach them to
understand this abridged, complete and simple system of Book-Keeping, It contains all the im-
portant principles of extended and expensive works on the science; all, in fact, that is necessary
to be known by the Farmer, Mechanick and shopkeeper, relating to accounts; and yet with very
little explanation and repeated copying and balancing the accounts, will be so fully understood
and deeply impressed on the memory of scholars of common mind, as ‘never to be forgotten;
while their knowledge of common arithmctick and practical penmanship will thereby be greatly

improved.]

BOOK-KEEPING is the art of recording mercantile transactions
in a regular and systematick manner.

Book-Keeping by SINGLE ENTRY chieﬂy records the transac-

tions on credit, and for this‘ purpose two books are necessary,
called the Day-Book, and the Leger.

THE DAY-BOOK.

Each page of the Day-Book should be ruled with two columns
on the right hand for dollars and cents,‘ and one column on the
left for inserting the page or folio of the Leger on which the ac-
count is posted. ‘

The Day-Book begins with an account of the owner’s proper-
ty, debts, &c. ; then follows a detail of the occurrences of trade.
set down in the order of time in which they take place.

BOOK-KEEPIN G.

The name of the person, or customer, is first Written with the
term Dr. or Cr. annexed, according as he becomes debtor or
creditor by the transaction ; and this may be distinguished by
the following general rule.

The person who receives is Debtor, and the person who gives
or parts with any thing is Creditor.

Thus, if I sell goods on credit, I enter A. B. the buyer, Dr.
to the goods, specifying their quantity and value.

If I buy goods on credit, I enter C. D. the seller, Cr. by the
goods, specifying their quantity and value.

By the same rule, if I pay money, the person to whom I pay
it, is made Dr. to cash for the amount ; and if I receive money,
the person from whom I receive it, is made Cr. by cash for the
amount.

And if debts bexcontracted or discharged by any other means,
the same rule is to be observed ; the person who becomes in-
debted to me, is entered Dr. and the person to whom I become
indebted, Cr. Also, the person whose debt I discharge, is made
Dr. and he that discharges. a debt due by me, is Cr.

THE I-36-‘ER.

Each page of the Leger should.’ be ruled with two columns on
the right hand for dollars and cents, and with one column on the
left, for entering the date o-f the transaction.

Ie the Leger, the dispersed accounts of ’ such Person in the
Day~Book are collected together, and tlw D73» 3113 078- are
placed upon opposite sides of the same page. of book-

. B. It is usual in commencing bu-5111355» to mark the first
Day-Book and Leger with the letter A» and Succeeding books,
with B, C, &c.

The person’s name is written in large characters as a title ;
on the left hand page, he is styled Dr. and on the opposite, or
right hand page Cr. On these pages the transactions are enter-
ed as they stand Drs. or Crs. in the Day Book. For instance,
A. B. is debited for whatever he has bought of me ; and on the
opposite page, he is credited for the payments be has made. In
short. whatever I have given him is on the Dr. side, and what he
has given me on the Cr. ; and the difference between the Dr.
and Cr. sides is called the balance.

The Leger should have an index, in which the titles of the accounts should be arranged under

their initial letters, with the number of the page or folio in the Leger, on which the account
is posted.

BOOK-KEEPING.

it is the practice of some accountants in single entry, to have a
column ruled on the page of the Leger, for the purpose of marking
against each entry the page of-the Day-Book whereon it. is originally
made. But this, in common business, is wholly unnecessary—-the date,
in most cases, being a sufficient guide to any entries in the Day-Book.

When all the transactions are correctly posted into the Leger, each
account is balanced by subtracting the amount of the less side from
the amount ofthe greater, and entering the remainder or balance on
the less side, by which the two sides are made equal.

When the place assigned in the Leger for any person’s account is
tilted with items, the person‘s name must not be entered the second
time, but may be transferred to another page in the following man—
ner,viz. Add up the columns on both sides, and against the sum
write, “ Amount transferred to page -——-” inserting the number of the
page where the new account is opened. After titlirig the new ac-
count and entering the number of the page in the index, write on the
Dr. side of the new account. “ To amount brought from page -——”
inserting the number of the page from which the old account wa3
brought, and on the Cr. side, “ By amount brought from page —--,” in‘
serting also the page where the old account was; and place the sums
in the proper"columns.

When the first Leger is ﬁlled up, a new one may be opened as fol-
lows, viz. At the end of the preceding Leger, draw outa balance ac-
count, entering the debits and credits on their respective Dr. and Cr.
side, and transfer each unbalanced account to its respective Dr. or Cr.
side to the new Leger. The first Leger may be marked A, the se-
cond B, and so on in alphabetical order.

To Find the profit and loss, for any given time, an inventory ofthe
propertyzmd debts must be taken, and the net amount of which, when
compared with the net amount of property at commencing business,
will. show the proﬁt and loss.

in Book—Keepin_g by Double Entry, a variety of books are made
use of, some of which, though not absolutely necessary to the me-
chanick or farmer, would be convenient and useful to him on .many
accounts. 

1. The CASH Boozer; this should be made ot“ a sutiicient quantity
of paper ruled in the Form ofa lager, with columns on each page tor
entries of cash received and cash paid. The practice of entering Sums
as received, and all sums as paid out, may serve on some 000831033 10
correct misunderstandings en settlement of accounts, besides the op-
portunity it aﬁ"et-ds of ascertaining at any time the state of a man’s
money concerns.

2. Accounr or Expenses; this may be kept in a separate book,
ruled like a Day-Book, or it may be entered as an account in the Leg»
er. The prudent farmer or mechanick will ever feel anxious to
know‘the amount of his contingent expenses, the better to ascertain
the exact state of his income.

3. Le'r'r1~;a Boon; As bad consequences frequently result from a neg«
lect to preserve copies. of letters sent on business, a book Sh0\1ld be
kept for the purpose of entering andpreservinga copy of every if3t-
tcr or memsrandunt concerning business which is sent away by an in-

divid ual.

going over the whole operation again, in case of interruptionior
mistake. If you want to keep the account clean, mark down the
sum and ﬁgure you carry on a separate paper, and after revising
them, transcribe the sum only. «After some practice, we ought
to acquire the habit of adding two or more ﬁgures at one glance.
This is particularly useful when two ﬁgures which amount to 10,
as 6 and 4, or '7 and 3, stand together in the column. Every
operation in arithmetick ought to be revised to prevent mistakes ;
and as one is apt to fall into the same mistake if he revise it in
the same manner he performed it, it is proper either to alter the
order, or else to trace back the steps by which the operation
advanced, which will lead us at last to the ‘number we began
with.

~ 

SUBT RACTIO N.

SUr.rnAo'r1oN teaches to take a less numberfrom a greater, to
ﬁnd a third, shewing the inequality, excess or difference between
the given numbers. The greater number is called the Jllimoend ;
the lesser number is called the Subtrahend. The diﬂerence be-
tween them, or What is left after subtraction is made, is called
the Remainder.

SIMPLE SUBTRACTION

Teaches to ﬁnd the difference between any two numbers, which
are of a like kind.

RULE.

Place the larger number uppermost, and the less underneath,
so that units may stand under units, tens under tens, &c. ; then
drawing a line underneath, begin with the units, and subtract the
lower from the upper ﬁgure, and set down“ the remainder ; but
if the lower ﬁgure be greater than the upper, add ten to the up-
per, and subtract the lower ﬁgure therefrom : The difference

being set down, you must add one to the lower ﬁgure of the next
column, for that which you borrowed ; and thus proceed through
the whole.

PROOF.

Add the remainder and the less number together ; if the work
be right, the amount will be equal to the greater number : Or,
subtract the remainder from the greater sum, and the difference,
will be equal to the less.

REMARK.——At every stage of the scholar’s progress, it would
be well for him to review‘ his previous studies-—-to ﬁx in his mem-
ory the most important rules ;' and endeavour to understand tho-
roughly the reasonableness and accuracy of the principles he is
taught. The simple rules of arithmetick are easily acquired;
but if the scholar hurries over them, as is too often the case,
without fully understanding their meaning and application, he will
find his subsequent studies as much retarded, as he would ﬁnd»
them aided, were he to become master of his subject’ as he goes
along:-—-The instructor should question his pupils on every rule,
and explain the principles of the rules, in every case, where a
scholar dhsires it.

go SIMPLE MULTIPLICATEON.
MULTIPLICATION.

MULTIPLICATION teaches how to increase the greater of two
numbers given, asloften as there are units in the less ; performs
the work of many additions in the most compendious manner ;
brings numbers of great denominations into small, as pounds into
shillings, pence, or farthings, &c.; and, by knowing the value of one
thing, we ﬁnd the value of many.

There are three parts in Multiplication, viz.

The sum to be multiplied is called the Multiplicancl.

The sugn by which you multiply is called the .71/Iultiplier.

The result of the operation is called the Product.
'f‘he‘Multiplicand and Multiplier are likewise called both tow

,gether factors, or that by which the operation is performed.

SIMPLE MULTIPLICATION

Is the multiplying of any two. numbers together, Withoutihav-
ing regard to their signiﬁcation ; as, 7 times 8 are 56, &c.

RULE.

1. Place the Multiplier under the Multiplicand, so that units

stand under units, and tens undertens, &c.., and draw a line under
them. '.
2. Beginning at the right hand, multiply each ﬁgure in the mul-
tiplicand by each in the multiplier, placing the first figure of ev-
ery line directly under‘ its respective multiplier, and to the pro-
duct: of the next ﬁgure carry one for every ten, as in addition.

3. Add the several products together, and their sum will be
the total product required.

Pnoo1r..—-~M1sltiply the multiplier by the multiplicancl.""

 

;i:§=- It is indispensably necessary that the Multiplication Table be
cominitted perfectly to memory, before the scholarproceadsﬁo the exam-
ples under the rules.

§ When the multiplier is a number consisting of several ﬁgures,
after we have found the product of the multiplicand by the ﬁrst ﬁgure
of the multiplier, we suppose the multiplier to be divided into parts,
and after the same manner, ﬁnd the product of the multiplicand by
the second ﬁgure of the multiplier; but as the ﬁgure by which we
are multiplying, stands in the place of tens, the product must be ten
times its number; and, therefore, the ﬁrst ﬁgure in this product must
must be written in the place of tens, or, which is the same, directly
under the ﬁgure by which we , are multiplying. And proceeding in
the same manner with all thevlﬁgures of the multiplier, separately, it
is evidnnt, we shall multiply all the parts of the multiplicand by all
the parts of the multiplier; therefore the sum of these several pro:
ducts will be the whole product required.

{ﬁ$= If there are ciphers between the signiﬁcant ﬁgures of the
multiplier, write themin a line with the product of the next signiﬁ-
cant ﬁgure, directly under their places in the multiplier. «M in Ex-

DIVISION.

DIVISION is the method of ﬁnding how many times a.less num-
ber is contained in a greater ; or dividitig a quantity given, into
any number of parts assigned ; and is a concise Way of perform~
ing several subtractions.

There are four parts to be noted in Division ;

1. The Dividend, ornumber given to be divided.

2. The Divisor, or number given to divide by.

3. The Quotient, or answer to the question, which shows how
oftcn the divisor is contained in the dividend.

4. The Remainder (which is always less than the divisor, and
of the same name with the dividend) is very uncertain, as there
is sometimes a remainder, and sometimes none.

SIMPLE DIVISION,

Is the dividing of one number by another, without regard to
their values ; as "56, divided by 8, produces 7 in the quotient :
That is, 8 is contained 7 times in 56.

GENERAL RULE.

1. Draw a curve line on each side of the dividend, and write
the divisor at the left hand.  

2. Take the same number of the first left hand ﬁgures in the
dividend that there are in the divisor, if they be equal to, or
greater than the divisor; butif they be less than the divisor,
take one more ; ﬁnd the number of times the divisor is contained
in them, and write a ﬁgure representing the~number at the right
hand of the dividend, which will be the ﬁrst-‘ﬁgure of the quo-
tient.

3. Multiply the divisor by this quotient ﬁgure, and write the
product under that part of the dividend taken. a

4. Subtract this product from that part of the dividend taken
and bring down the next ﬁgure of the dividend, and place it at
the right hand of the remainder ; then ﬁnd a quotient ﬁgure, mul-
tiply and subtract as before directed ; proceed in the same man-
ner until all the ﬁgures in the dividend are brought down and
divided.

5. When a ﬁgure has been brought down and placed at the
right hand of the remainder, if the number be less thagthe di-

and proceed as at first.

.Note.--Whenthere is no remainder to a division, the quotient is the absolute and per».
fect answer to the question ; but when there is a remainder, it may be observed, that L:
goes so much towards another time as it approaches the divisor; thus, if the remainder
be half the divisor,’ it will go half ofa time more, and so on ; in order, therefore, to com-
plete the quotient, put the last remainder to the end of it. above it line. and the divisor
below it, as in Example 2. Hence the origin of vulgar fractions, which will be treated
of hereafter.

The reason of the proof is plain ; for, since the quotient is the number of times the
dividend contains the divisor, the product of the quotient and divisor must, evidently,
be equal to the dividend. .

As the quotient and divisor are always multiplied during the operation, a simple meth-
od of proof is, by adding the several products and remainder, (if any) together as they
stand. Thus in the above example---- 1 prod. 5. . . . '

ﬁgure representing the number of cents, then write a cipher at the
left hand in the ten"s place. Five cents are written thus—,05.

2. To write any number of mills less than ten, when there are no
cents in the sum—--Write a ﬁgure representing the number of mills,
then write two ciphers at‘ the left hand in the place of cents. Five
mills are written thus——,O05.

 Parts or fractions of a cent are sometimes used instead of mills
and tenths of a mill; as ,123‘, cents for ,125.—,06g- cents ,0625.

COMPOUND ADDITION.

tCom>oUND ADDITION is the adding together of several num-
bers having diﬂerent denominations, as, pounds, shillings, pence,
&c. ; tons, hundreds, quarters, &c.

RULE.

1. Place the numbers, so that those of the same denomina-
tion may stand directly under each other.

2. Add thevlirst column or denomination together as in whole
numbers ; then divide the sum by as many of the same denomin-
ation as make one of the next greater, setting down the remain-
der under the column added ; carry the quotient to the next
superior denomination, continuing the same to the last column,
which add as in simple addition.* J

3‘ The reason of this rule is evident from what has been said in addition of simpie
numhers: for in addition of money, as 1 in the pence is equal to 4 in the farthings ; I in
the shillings, to 12in the pence; and 1 in the pounds, to 20 in the shillings ;--t'nerefore,
carrying as directed, is arranging the money arising from each column, properly, in the
scale of denominations: and this reasoning will hold good in the addition of compound

-numbers of any denomination whatever.

No'rm.-—The civil Solar year of 365 days being short of the true,
by 5h. 48m. 573“ occasioned the beginning of the year to run forward
through the season nearly one day in four years ; on this account,
Julius Caesar ordained that one day should be added to February
every fourth year, by causing the 24th day to be reckoned twice ;
and because this 24th day was the sixth, (sextilis) before the kalends
of March, there were in this year two of these sextiles, which gave
the name of Bissextile to this year, which being thus corrected, was,
from thence, called the Julian year.

5;; COMPOUND SUBTRACTION.
COMPOUND SUBTRACTION.

COMPOUND SUBTRACTION teaches to ﬁnd the diﬂ"erence bc«
tween any two sums of divers denominations.

RULE.

Place the numbers under each other, which are of the same
denomination. the less being below the greater ; begin with the
least denomination, and if it exceed the figure over it, borrow
as many units as make one of the next greater ; subtract it
therefrom ; and to the difference add the upper ﬁgure, remember-
ing always, to add one to the next superior denomination, for
that which you borrovved.*

Pnoor.——-The same as in simple subtraction.

PROBLEMS,

£531?’ By a due consideration and application of these Problems, many questions may
be solved in a short and easy manner. although some of them are generally supposed
to belong to higher rules.]

REMARK.—-The scholar, having now surveyed the ground-work
of his studies, begins to see their application to the common con-
cerns of life ;-—- and it is important, vvhile proceeding in the higher
rules, that his memory be strengthened by repeated. examinations
in the previous studies. The instructor is advised, therefore, to
state questions of his own, promiscuously under the several rules,
that the good scholar may have an opportunity of proving to his
teacher and friends, by prompt and ready answers to difficult ques-
tions, that he thoroughly understauds the subject before him.——
This hint, improved now, may be of essential service heieafter.

REDUCTION. 59
REDUCTION.

REDUCTION is the method of changing numbers of one denorn-s
ination into others of different denominations, Without altering
their value.

It is of two sorts, viz. Descending and Ascending.

REDUCTION DESCENDING

Teaches to change numbers from a higher denomination tova
lower ; and is performed by multiplication.

iRULE.

Multiply the highest denomination; given, by so many of the

next less, as make one of that greater, and thus continue, till’

you have brought it down as low as your question requiresﬁl‘

PROOF;

Change the order of the question, and divide your last product
by the last multiplier, and so on.

N o'rE.—-From this rule and Case II. of Simple Multiplication, it ap-
pears that Federal Money is reduced from higher to lower denomin-s
ations, by annexing as many ciphers as there are places from the de-
nomination given to that required; or, if the given sum be of £llff~:I'-
cut denominations, by annexing the several ﬁgures of all the denom-

inations in their order, and continuing with ciphers, if necessary, to’

the denomination required ; or, what amounts to the same thing, by

reading the whole numberfrom the left to the required denomination,

as one number in the required denomination.
EXAMPLES.

1. In 3 eagles 2 dollars, how many mills ?
Ans. 32000 no.

' **_
.....______._............._

 

* The reason. of this rule is obyious; for pounds are brought into shillings by multis
plying them by 20; shillings into pence by multiplying them by 12; and pence into far-
things by multiplying them by 4 ; and this will be true in the reduction of numbers con-
sisting of any denomination whatever. The reasonof: the rule in Reduction Ascending,
is equally evident ; for farthings are brought into pence by dividing them by 4; pence
into shillings by dividing them by 12 ; and shillings into pounds by dividing them by 20_

REDUCTION ASCENDING,

Teaches how to change numbers from a lower to a higher de—
nomination 3 and is performed by division.

RULE.

Divide the lowest denomination given, by so many of that name,
as make one of the next higher, and thus continue, till a on have
brought it into that denomination, which your question requires.

NoT1«j.——From this rule and the note under Case 11. of Simple Di-
vision, it appears, that FEDERAL MONEY is reduced from lower to higher
denominations by cutting oi? as many places as the given denomina-
tion stands to the right of that required ; the ﬁgures cut off belonging
to their respective denominations.

REMARK.---It is thought unnecessary to give exaniijnles of re-
duction under all the tables of Weights, Measures, &c. ; as the
attentive scholar will readily understand the correct process,
from the exercises he has already had. The learner may, hoW—
ever, ﬁnd it useful to turn to those tables under which no exam-
ple is here given———state questions of his own accorde--and, hav-
ing found their true answers, write them down with theiother
examples in his CIPHERING-BOOK.

79 FRACTIONS.
FRACTIONS.*“

FRACTIONS are parts of an unit, or whole number. When a
whole is expressed by ﬁgures, the number is called an integer :-—+-
hut when a part, or some parts, of a thing are denoted by ﬁgures,
as,  one fourth, if; two thirds, 737,- three tenths, &c. of a thing, these
ﬁgures are called fractions.

Fractions are divided into two kinds, VULGAR and DECIMAL.

VULGAR FRACTIONS.

A VULGAR FRACTION is that which can have any denominator ;
and is expressed by two numbers written one above the other,
thus-----%, with a line between.

The ﬁgure above the line is called the numerator, {ta

The ﬁgure below the line is called the denominator, 8

The denominator (which is the divisor in division) shows how‘
many parts the integer is divided into ;_--and the numerator
(which is the remainder after division) shows how many of those
parts are meant by the fraction.

Fractions are either proper, improper, single, compound, or
mixed. Any whole number may he made an improper fraction,
by drawing a line under it,tand putting unity, or 1, for a denomi-
nator; as, 9 may be expressed, fractiomvise, thus--=‘,’., and I2
thus, ‘,3, &c.

1. A single, or simple fraction, is a fraction expressed in a simple
form; as, 31:,  —,I’—,,—, 830.

2. A compound fraction is a fraction expressed in a compound form,
being a fraction of afraction, or. two or more fractions connected
together ; as, g of -3;, 3;, of—,~5-,~ 9f »,_‘;9- ; which are read thus-——one half
of three fourths, two sevenths of ﬁve elevenths of nineteen twen-
tieths, &r:..

.....—.——.—..-—._.«—..—.-—-—...—....—_.-....-...~

* The tern), xgaorrom, signiﬁes a broken part or parts of any thing or number ; and

these parts caifhe fepresented by ﬁgures, as well as whole things or numbers. It was

shown on page 29, that fractions arise from the operations of division ; and hence we
may see the necessity of understanding something of the arithmetick of Vulgar Frac-
tions, even though it he in some respects “ a tedious and intricate rule.”

‘VULGAR FRACTIONS“. 71»

 A proper fraction is a fraction, whose numerator is less than its
denominator ; as, 7}, 23-, 381, «Sec.

4. An improper fraction is a fraction, whose numerator is larger
than its denominator ; as, 73-, g, 9;, &c.

5. A mixed number is composed of a whole number and a fraction;
as, 7-3, 355%, &c., that is, seven and three ﬁfths, &c.

6. ‘The common measure of two or more numbers, is that number,

'WlllCl't will divide each of them without a remainder: Thus, 5 is the

common t measure (or divisor) of 10, 20, and 30; and the greatest
number which will do this is called the greatest common measure.

7. A number, which can be measured by two, or more, numbers,
is called their common. multiple : And, if it be the least number which
can be so measured, it is called the least common multiple ; thus, 40,
60, 80, 100, are multiples of 4 and 5 ; but their least common multi-
pie is 20.

8. A prime number is that, which can only be measured (that is,
divided) by itself, or an unit; as, 5, Sec.

,9. A perfect number is equal to the sum of all its aliquot parts.*

PROBLEM I.

To ﬁnd the greatest common measure of two or more numbers.

RULE 1.’ If there be two numbers only, divide the greater by
the less, and this divisor by the remainder, and so on, always di-
viding the last divisor by the last remainder, till nothing remain ;
then will the last divisor be the greatest common measure re-

-remainder; as, 3 is an aliquot part of 12. And 2,3, and 6, are aliquot parts of 6. And
Q, 4, 7, 14, and 28, are aliquot parts of 28. Now, if 6 be divided by 2', 3, and 6. the res-
pective quotients will be 3, 2, and 1, whose sum is equal to 6, the original number. And
if 28 be divided by 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28, the several quotients will be 14, 7, 4, 2. and 1,
whose sum is equal to Q8. the given number. 6 and 28 are therefore perfect numbers,
according to the deﬁnition. The sum of all the aliquot parts of any number, which is
not a pc rfect one. will be either less or greater than the given number, and never precise-
ly equal to it ; as may be proved by a similar operation.

PROBLEM II.

To ﬁnd the least common multiple of two or more numbers,

RULE 1. Divide by any number that will divide two or more“
of the given numbers without a remainder, and set the quotients,
together with the undivided numbers, in a line beneath.

2. Divide the second line as before, and so on, till there are
no two numbers that can bedivided ; then the continued product
of the divisors and quotients will give the multiple requiredq‘

’ * The truth of this rule may be shown from the first example ; for since 12 divides 24,

it alsddivides Q4-{-12, or 36. Again, since 12 divides 24 and 36, it also divides 36)<2+‘'24. ’

or 96.

 'l‘The reason of this rule may be shown from thegvﬁrst example, thus : It is evident,
that 3X5X8x10=l200 may be divided by 3, 5, 8, and 10. without a remainder; but
10 is a multiple of 5 ; therefore, 3)<5x8)(2=240 is also divisible by 3. 5, 8. and 10’.--—
Alsc, 8 is a multiple of 2; therefore, 3)(5X4)(2::-.120 is also divisible by 3, 5, 8, and

RULE.

Divide the terms of the given fraction by any number, which
will divide them without a remainder, and the quotients again in
the same manner ;   and so on, till it appears there is no number
greater than 1, vvbich will divide them, and the fraction will be
in its lowest terms. ‘ c

0r, divide both the termsof the fraction by their greatest
common measure, and the quotients will be the terms of the
fraction required.

Nora.-—That‘ dividing both the terms,'that is, both numerator and
-denominator of the fractions, equally by any number, whatever, will
give another fraction, equal to the former, is evident ; and if those

Norm.--1!‘ any part of the compound fraction be a whole or mixed
number, it must first be reduced to an improper fraction.

That a compound fraction may be represented by a single one, is
evident, since a part of a part must be equal to some part of the
whole. The truth of the rule for this reduction may be shewn as fol-

To ﬁnd the value of a fraction in the known parts of the integer, as

RULE.--Multiply the numerator by the parts in the next in-

and if any thing remain, multiply it by the next inferior denom-
ination, and divide by the denominator as before, and so on, as far
as necessary; and the quotients placed «after one another, in
their order, will be the answer required. Or, reduce the nu-
merator, as if it were a whole number, to the lowest denomina-
tion, and divide the result by the denominator ; the quotient will
be the number of the lowest denomination, (which must he
brought into higher denominations as far as it will go,) and the
remainder will be a numerator, to be placed over the given de-
nominator for a fraction of the lowest denomination.

Nora.-—-From this rule, in connexion with what has been said of
Reduction of Federal Money, it appears, that, annexing to the given
numerator as many ciphers, as will ﬁll all the places to the lowest
denomination, and dividing the number so formed by the denomina-
tor, the quotient will be the answer in the several denominations,
and the remainder a numerator to be placed over the given denomi-
nator, forming a fraction of the lowest denomination.

Jacob B. Moore, ,

Sm,-—-1 have examined your edition of Pike’s Arithmetick, and
am favorably impressed with the additions and improvements ; and
am of opinion that the work is as well adapted to use in our primary
schools and academies, as any system of a similar kind that has come
to my knowledge. Yours respectfully,

From Thomas Chadbourne, M. D. of Concord.

Pike’s system of Arithmetick has long been classed among standard
works, not only in primary schools, but in the higher seminaries.——-
The abridgment now published by Mr. Jacob B. Moore, embraces the
most essential parts of the original work, condensed into a more port-
able form; and by the addition of new and. practical illustrations, and
appropriate questions, the present edition will be found eminently
calculated both to lessen the labor of instruction, and facilitate the
progress of the pupil. THO. CHADBOURN E.

To reduce any given quantity to the fraction of any greater denom-»

RULE»-—Reduce the given quantity to the lowest term meus
tioned, for at numerator ; then reduce the integral part to the

Noriz.-——lt appears from this rule, and what has been said before,
that, in Federal Money, where the given quantity contains no frac«
tion of its lowest denomination, the annexing of as many ciphers to
1 of the required denomination, as will extend to the lowest denom-»
ination in the given quantity, will form a denominator, which, placed
under the given quantity used one number for a numerator, will
make the answer, which may be reduced to its lowest terms. Or,
if there be a fraction of the lowest denomination, multiply the given
whole numbers by its denominator, adding its numerator, tor a. numer-
ator ; and let the denominator itself, at the left of as many ciphers as

REDUCE compound fractions to single ones ; mixed. numbers to
improper fractions ; fractions of different integers to those of the
same ; and all of them to acommon denominator ; them the sum
of the numerators written over the common denominator will be
the sum of the fractions required.

Nom.--—Fractions, before they are reduced to :1 common denomina-
tor, are entirely dissimilar, and therefore cannot be incorporated
with one another ; but when they are reduced to a common denom-
inator, and made parts of the same thing, their sum, or difference,
may then be as properly expressetl by the sum or ditl'erence of the
numerators, as the sum or difference of any two quantities whatever,

by the sum or difference of their individuals ; whence the reason of

the rules, both for Addition and Subtraction, is manifest.

A DAECIMALV FRACTION is a fraction &whose_ denominator is aiunit
with so many ciphers annexed as thenumerator has places of
ﬁgures.

As the denominator of a decimal fraction is always 10t,,lOO,
1000, &c.i the denominators need not be expressed:

numerator only maybe made to express the true values»? a 

thisipurpose it’ isonlyfreqiuired to write the numeratorgstklwithfiia
point before it at the left hand,‘ a _o distinguish‘ itnoni   awliole
number, when it consists of so a many ﬁgures, asthe denominator
hath ciphers annexed to unity~,or 1 : So -‘$55 is ‘written .5 ; 3.3.53.5,
.33 ; 953-55, .735, &c. % "  
The pointpreﬁxed is called aiSeparatet§isix,  

t But if the numerator has not  many pFa($‘estri'asi~tliérdehominator
has ciphers, put so many cipheerst befoiire it, viz. at:the left hand,
as will make up the defect: so write -,—~§-5-‘ thus, .05 ; and 7595.5,

90 DECIMAL FRAO'I‘I‘0NS.

All the ﬁgures at the left hand of the decimal point are whole
numbers. The 5 in the lst place at the right hand of the point,
represents 5 tenths ; 5 in the 2nd place, 5 hundredths ; 5 in the 3rd
place, 5 thousandths ; 5 in the 4th place, 5 ten-thousandths; 5 in the
5th place, 5 hundred thousandths ; 5 in the 6th place, 5 millionths ;
5 in the ’7th lace, 5 ten-millionths ; 5 in the 8th place, 5 hundred-
millionths; and all of them ‘taken together, are read thus :-——Fifty-ﬁve
million, ﬁve. hundred ﬁfty-ﬁve thousand, five hundred and ﬁfty-ﬁve
hundred millionths.*

"Cip"hers, placed at the right hand of a decimal fraction, do not al«
ter its value, since every signiﬁcant ﬁgure continues to possess the

same place : So .5, .50, and .500,are all of the same value, and each

equal ‘to a}. .

But ciphers placed at the left ‘hand of a decimal, do alter its value,
every cipher depressing it to —,:‘got' the value it had before, ‘by re-
moving every signiﬁcant ﬁgure one place further from the place of

units. So .5, .05, .005, all express diﬁ"eren,t-decimals, viz. .5, ,5-5 ; .05,

‘ids’ ; -005: I655?’
Decimal fractions of unequal denominators are reduced to one

«common denominator, when there are annexed to the right hand of

those, which ‘have fewer places, so many ciphers as make them

‘equal in places with that which has the most. So these decimals,

.5, 06, .455, may be reduced to the decimals .500, 1060, .455, which
have all 1000 for their denominator.

'-Of decimals, that is the greatest, ‘whose ‘highest ﬁgure is greatest,
Whether they consist of an equal or unequal number ofplaces»: Thus,

.5 is greater than .459, for it it be reduced to the same denominator
with .459, it will be .500.

:-——-——-:-. _——.—toun-

.....-.._——-—

‘*‘It is evident from the Table, that since the decimal parts decrease in a tenfold pro»

portion from the place of units towards the right hand. they must increase in a tenfold

proportionfrom the right hand towards the left, which proves that decimal fractions are
subject to the same law of notation, and consequently of operation, as whole numbers.

To read decrimalﬁgures.--Beg’.-n at the left hand, and read them in the same manner
as we read whole numbers, and add to the whole the nameofthc place of the right
hand ﬁgure.

‘EXAMPLES.

:24 is read 24 hundredths;
.035 is read 35 thousandths ;
.0050 is read 50 ten thousandths ;
0 .000750 is read 750 millionths .; .
.00000099 is read 99 hundred millionths.

ADDITION OF DECIMALS. 9;;

A mixed number, viz. a whole number with a decimal annexed, is
equal to an improper fraction, whose numerator is all the ﬁgures of
the mixed number, taken as one whole number, and the denominator
that of the decimal part. So 45309 is equal to ‘1,—%",,°-0-9, as is evident
from the method given to reduce a mixed number to an improper
fraction : Thus, 45X-10O0+.3O9=4T-‘$55959 as above.

DIVISION or DECIMALS.
RULE.

1. The places of decimal parts in the divisor and quotient,
counted together, mustalways be equal to those in the dividend ;
therefore, divide as in whole numbers, and, from the right hand
of the quotient, point off so many places for decimals, as the de-
cimal places jn the dividend exceed those in the divisor.

2. If the places of the quotient he not so many as the rule
requires, supply the defect by pretixing ciphers to the left hand.

3. If at any time there be a remainder, or the decimal places
in the divisor he more than those in the dividend, ciphers may

be annexed to the dividend or to theremainder, "andthe quotient‘

carried on to any degree of exactness.
