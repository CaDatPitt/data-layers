 in peace their religious principles and Worship.
Mr. Robi,nson and his congregation first left the north.
of ‘England, and tool: up their abode in Amsterdam,
in 1607 and 1608. But on account of some differen-
ces‘ with another congregation under Mr. Smith, they
reinoved in about a year to Leyden, where they lived
 harmony, till they removedto America. These ad-
venturers attemptedto procure a patent under the _Vir-
ginia Company; but they found it very. diﬂicult, on
account of the odiousness of their principles. They
‘ﬁnally obtained one “in the name of John VVincob,   but,
he failing to remoye to ‘America, it was of no use, and
they resolved torsemovie without one.

consisting of a part 'only of Nfr- Robinson,’s congrega—

‘beinglleaky, « they put into Dartmouth, from whence
 in two ships on the 21st of the same month.
.After ' proceeding a hundred leagues, they "were com.-t

ctindeinned, and the other proceeded on her Voyage.

people of the colony were incorporated, with ‘ample

Dutch governor of New Netherlands, and the Swedish
set‘t1ers,,which subsisted many years. In 1641, anom-

be deemed expedient, provided they were not repug-
nant to the laws of England. By the charter ot I‘/Ias-s
sachusetts, the powers of government were lodgecl an
the governor, deputy governor and eighteen assistants,
who were to be chosen by the freernen, and who con-:..
stituted a court to be held monthly—-—-andiin the Whole
body of the ifreemen, who Were to be summoned to hold
a. general court at least once in a year. The first gene»

election the freemen chose the assistants and these chose
the governor and deputy governor from among their
town number; but this was a departure from the char-
ter; and at the general court in May 16,32, it was or.-
dered that the freemen should choose the governor and
assistants annually, and the governor be always selected
from among the assistants. The governor and assist-*
ants at ﬁrst exercised great powers,---even to the laying‘
of taxes, without consulting the freemen. The people
in VVatertoWn opposed this practice, but thecourt of
assistants surnmo.ne,d them to appear before the court
at Boston, and convinced them that the “ goyermnent
was rather in the nature ofya parliament, than of a city
corporation,” The opposers therefore suh nitted and
retracted What was called their error ; but in fact was
a correct opinion.

The assistants and deputies continued to sit in the same
room and voted together about ten years; but not With-
out great discontent on the part of thedeputies, who
conceived themselves abridged of their just rights, by
the negative Vote of the assistants. In hlarch, 1644:,
this dispute gave rise to amotion -on the part " of the
deputies, thatthe assistants and deputies should sepa-
rate and hold their deliberations in difieineiitrooms ;‘
and that the concurrence of both houses. should be ne-
cessary to pass_ a bill into a law or resolve. The motion
prevailed--—and thus was established the distribution of
the legislatixfe power into two houses, which remains to
this day, and has been adopted as‘ a principle in most
of the American Constitutions. In Connecticut how-
ever the practice of theassistants and deputies’ sitting
and voting together continued, until the October ses-
sion in 1698, when the legislature passed an act by‘
which thatbody was divided into two houses.

that great respect should be paid to elderly men, to ma-.
,'gistrates and to ministers. V This opinion was justified
by the scriptures, and productive of Very salutary ef.
fects.i Some persons carried their attempts farther’
than was agreeable to public opinion. Before the gen-

sermon, ‘maintained that ‘a magistrate ought not to be’

Deceinber, 1641, the general court enacted the laws,

of these laws were copied into the ﬁrst code of Con-

4-$8 Primitise ,Gooervrzment of Plymouth Colony“.
The planters at Plymouth were few in number, and
they adopted the laws of England mostly asthe rules
of judging in ‘their own concerns, but, like those of
Dlassachusetts, they annexed to some crimes penalties
far too severe. They at first elected no civil» officer
except a governor and one assistant-—in 1624,‘four
more assistants were added, and in 1633, two more,
making seven in all, which number continued till they
resigned their charter to Andross. They had no depu-
ties from the towns, until ‘the year 1639, when depu-v
ties were chosen and formed one house with the gov-
ernor and assistants. Before that time, the freemen
attended in person.

The supreme power of deciding an cases in law and  

equity, was or?.g*ii1al1y* in the court of assistants in Nlas-4
sachusetts; and in Plymouth, was vested in_the._ gov-
ernor and assistants. by a law in 1634. y The same law
was adopted in Connecticut ; and when  the increase
of people and business, it was found“ inconvenient for
the whole body of assistants to attend, it became acus-V

tom for the general court appoint annually four .

the assistants ’with the deputy governor, to constitute
the superior court. This practice continued till the.May
session 17 84, when the governor, deputy. governor and

assistants were disabled from holding the oﬂice of a

Judge of that court. The practice of the an‘nua}ap-

(I I

pointmcnt 01' Judges, derived from the practice»ofii’tihLt-
«sing the assistants annually, suhsists to this clay.---—-The
judges of the county courts also were primittvely taken

from among the assistants. As the supreme jiid1iei«a1*y  

power, in the infant state of the colonies, was exercised
by the general court, when the assistants and deputies
met in one house, so the legislature of Connecticut, for

y a longltinie after its divisirion into twohouses,. retained

October 1634, it was agreed by the ministers and mag-
istrates, that this number required to much time ; and
therefore they reduced the number to two, which were
to he preached alternately at Boston, Cambridge, Rox-
bury and Dorchester. The number is now reduced to
one, which is preached every Thursday at‘Boston.
453 Days qfFas\té7zg and T/zaﬂ/§59‘i?)i??,g‘. The churches
laid aside the regular festivals of the Church of England,
and appointed days of fasting, on special occasions,
such astimes of severe drouth,great mortality, scarcity
of provisions, danger from the savages and the like.
Days of thanksgiving were appointed on occasions of
great joy, such as the conquest of the Pequots, the ter-
mination of Indian wars, and especially for abundant.
crops. These occasional days were frequent during
the first generation, who suffered peculiar hardships,
and who were exposed to unceasing perils, which im-

pressed their minds deeply with a sense of their depend-  

ence on the Supreme Being. The practice of theﬁrst
settlers has given rise, ‘among their descendants, to a
regular appointment of a clay of humiliation in the
spring, and a day of thanksgiving in autumn.

454: C/mrc/z D2'sc2'pl2‘72. The ﬁrstchurches were very
rigid in their authority over the principles and morals of
their members. The least deviation from what theybe-
lieved to be orthodoxy, and every immorality was sub-

jected to church censures. This narrow inspection of -

every man’s conduct, produced for many years, most
exact morals in life and great uniformity of doctrines.
But it was not possible to prevent differences -of opin-
ion, and when these arose, the severity with which the
persons who avowedthem, were censured, occasioned
many heartburnings and mutual reproaches. Some
persons were banished from Massachusetts, orexcom-T
municatcd by the churches, and leavin the ' colony,
they planted Rhode Island. The same rigid principles,

_ led to many iabstrcjusey in uiries and minute distinctions,
on religious subjects, wp ich divided the opinions of

457 Sujlwort  the C'0n.greg¢;zté,0naZ Clergy. *The ﬁrst
ministers in New England were Inaintaigzecl by weekly
contributions. The famous Nlr. Cotton preached a.
sermon in Boston, in December, 1633, in which he
urged that the scriptures clearly direct the maintenance
of ministers to be d,erfra§,*ed, like other charges of the
church, out of a chest or treasury to be supplied by
contribution ; u.pen which the church  the.prac-..-
tice. But it was laid down as a  in the ﬁrst.
church laws, that ministers Ougllt to be supported by
their hearers, and in case of neglect, that the n1ag,ista1*ate
might be called upon to compel them to make payment.,,
The clergy have now ﬁxed salaries paid by a tai on the
pews of the church or the property of the hearers. T he
first settlers in Rhode Island adopted a diﬁerent prin-
ciple, and a declarationof general toleration, being in-‘
corporatecl into the charter of that colony, the laws,

an episcopal ch.u:rch, consisting of about four lltllldrﬁgclf
persons, met regularly‘ for Worship. The ﬁrst episcopal

experience convinced the people of the absurdity of the
project .; for many persons, expecting to be inaintained
out of the public fund, neglected to labor, and the col-
ony was in dan gerofperishing with hunger. I111 623 , the
company placed every single person in some family,
assigned a portion of land to each, and left every fami-.,

460 Sunzjjtziary and Regzz/atz'n.igr Laws. The planters
of New England, on their arriva in awilderness, where
it was difﬁcult at first to obtain the necessaries of life,

and impossible to enjoy luxuries, attenriptecl by exam»:

ple and law to restrain all excesses in diet or dress. Gov-,
ernor ‘Winthrop, soon after he arrived, laid aside the
practice of drinking healths, at his own table, and re—
commended it’ to others. In 1639, the practice was
forbid by law. In 1634», laws were passed, prohibiting

 the use of tobacco, immodest fashions, and costly appa-Q,

rel. In 1633, a law was made to limit the price of la-

bor; workmen being scarce and demanding high wa-

gee. iMaster workmen Were allowed two shillings, and

i laborers, eighteen pence, a day, money being of sterling

value. Itwas also “ordered that the advance on goods
szirould not exceed four pence on a shilling, beyond the

3sr*iiee in England». These laws had’ no durable effect,
  and the general court in 1640, ﬁnding that laborers
would either transgress the lawsor leave the colony,

repealed the act regulating wages, and left every town
to fix the price of labor iainong its own inhabitants,
which had a better effect. a i i i

planters of N ew England had vested all their property

but having little commerce, their money was,» in a

ample was soon followed by the inhabitants of Boston,
who built one of one hundred an(l.sixtyf tons. Both
were ﬁnished in 1644. That of Boston was called the
I rial. Money was not obtainable topay the carpen.
ters, but they agreed to take the produce of the coun’-»
try. ‘ Thus commenced a spirit of commerce which has
made the northern states rich and respectable.

464: F55‘/ze:t~ées and Trade of the Colonies. ‘Within a
few years after the discovery of North America by Ca-»
hot, the English and French began, to take great quan-
tities of ﬁsh on the American coast, especially on the
banks of Newfoundland. This business had become of
great importance, more than ﬁfty years before the set-
tlement of Plymouth. The ﬁsh were mostly carried to
Spain and Portugal. The ﬁrst planters in New Eng-
larigl found their time and money so much occupied in
procuring the means of subsistence, that for some years,
the;y..:could not carry on the ﬁsheries to algreat extent.
Their principal article of export was peltry ; and most-;

ly beaver skins, Which they purchased of the. Indians

for goods of small value. To procure beaveiywas the

first object of the colonies in establishing trading hou4- ’

ses atKennebs:i»c, Connecticut and other places. In 1639,
at ﬁshing trade was begun at Cape Ann, and the stock

iemployedin it was exempted from taxation for seven

years. This seems to have been the first act of gov-
ernment for encouraging the ﬁshery. In 1641, three
hundred thousand codfish were sent to market.-

,4+6,5 iTmj2o7~tance of the Peltry Trade to t/zeCOIa-mes‘.
Of such value was the trade ’ in peltry to the first plant;
ers, that each colony claimed, and maintained an ex-
salusive right of trading with the ‘Indians, within the
Iimitsgof its own patent. Hence arose serious contests
betwyeen the colonies. In»~1_631,a small pinnace {rem
Saleem, bound to Boston, was driven into Plymouthby
advcttse winds, and the governor of . Plymouth was so

ened to oppose them liycforce. A similar jealousy caus-
ed a. contest between the Plymouth traders at Kenne-
hec and a trading boat from Pascataway, in W'l11Cl‘l two

rnen were killed. This trade also was a principal cause

of the controversy l)etween the Eng,-lisii and Dutch,
concerning the right to Connecticut 1"1\«’€}‘. Anal so’ Va-,-_
lnzthle was the trade, that the linghsli even planted

Inaiz for the Indians,the better to enable them to spend i
V their time in collecting beaver.  

466 Progress of Tracie é22’i'f.éc L'}'2Zmziés. The plant-
ers imported at first much of their provisimqs, andfor
many years, all thein clothing froni l'£ng2:1nc.l. In 1631,

on account of a scarcity in England, theirxvheat, with  

the freight, cost them fourteen shillings sterling al)u.sh-

el, .a.nd,pease, eleven and six pence. From Virginia,

they received small supplies of rnaizz. In 1631, a small‘
pinnace from Virginia, sold her main in Salem for ten‘
shillings sterling the bushel. In the same yea1",an Engw
lish ship, after landing some cattle at Boston, sailed for
St. Kitts, but not to return to New England. In 1;_634=,

a ‘vessel Went to Bermuda, and returned by the Way of

Virginia, with corn and oats. The lﬁ-rst vessel direct-.
ly from the West Indies, was a Dutch shipof 160
tons, which came from St. Kitts, and arrived at M211‘-
blehead, in May, 1635,, laden with salt and tobacco.--—»
St. Kitts had then been settled twelve years, and con-r
tained about four thousand inliahita-nts. In June, the
the same year, arrived two Dutch ships froin the iTex-e

being hi_7gh-—-horses and. mares from thirty. to

38. Summer and I/Véizter. Heat is caused or excited
by the rays of the sun, and when these are greatly ae-

t cumulated or condensed, the heat must be great. Thus

when the sun is nearly vertical, the rays fall directly on
the earth, and being greatly accumulated, ‘cause vio-
lent heat. This is the cause of r the heat of summer.
In Winter, the rays of the sun strike the earth oblikely,
and are so scattered as to make little heat.  

39. Fixeag’ Stars. Most of the Stars which bespan-
gle the l1eavens,l are fixed,» and never alter their places
or relative positions. Of these about two thousand
have been discovered and numbered ; and as men in-
crease the magnifying powers of their glasses, they dis-
cover new stars. The” fixed stars appear to shine. by
their own light, and are supposed to be suns or centers
of other systems of worlds. Their distance from us
exceeds the utmost stretch of the imagination. . 

40. Comets. Comets, vulgarly called blazingisotars,
are bodies that move‘ in very eccentric orbits. They
revolve about the sun, and when they come within the
solar system; become visible. Theythen fit of? into
re1riote~regions of space, and are invisible lie!‘ years.
The periods of some of them are calculated to exceed
three or four. hundred years. How many liéilong to

InoConnecticnt, this provision extended to females

priates, to each town or school district, a. sunti of money

payable out of the treasury of the st;ate,=l-equalto one
five hundredth part of the value of the taxable property

of the inhabitants, as rated in the grand list or public

assessment. In addition to this, each town has the,-

‘and 1‘€S,t1‘aiH6d the trade of the colonies principally to
British ports. By this means the colonies were de-

prived of the beneﬁt of many of the best yymarketsi

fortheir produce ; and the enterprizing spirit of the

inhabitants was checked, or rendered subservient to

the politic views of the parent state. In consequence
of these disadvantages, the-balances of trade was usual-
ly against the colonies ; that is, they imported goods
to a greater value than they exported ; and the differ-

ence was paid in specie, as long‘ as it could/be procured.’

This unproﬁtable, trade exhausted the colonies of men-

ey, to a distressing degree ; and when the public exi-'

gsencies called for extraordinary taxes, the people could
not pay them in cash. For a long period, taxes were
. aid‘in produce, which was deposited in public stores
and sold to raise money. But this was very trouble-
some and expensive ; and the colonies adopted the
plan of issuingubills of credit for as medium of trade, in
lieu of specie.

fray the expenses of another expedition against Quebec
in 1711, Massachusetts issued a large sum in hills of
credit, and in 171/Land 1716 no less than  value of
half a million of dollars. Besides these sums, the col-
ony had, from time to time, issued bills to pay the ex-
penses of government, and neglected to ‘redeem the bills,
until their depreciation, and its consequent evils had
‘alarmed the crown, and a. royal order had been sent to
the governor to restrain all further emissions, until the
billsextant, should be redeemed. Many. schemes were
projected to preserve the value of the bills--some part
‘of them were lent to individuals on security--others
rested on the faith of government, which ‘was pledged

Governor p1VvIop1‘eooi" South Carolina, irashly undertook
an expedition against St. Augustine, a Spanish town
in East Florida .; the plan was disconeerted by the arri-.-
val of two Spanish ships, and abandoned, in a cowardly
manner.  the colony then did not contain more than
seven or eight thousand. white people,‘ theexpenses of
the expedition were too considerable to be defrayed by
an ordinary tax ; and the ‘eolony issued hills of credit
forthe purpose. This was the first experiment. As
the sum was not large, the bills answered a good pur-.
pose, and for some years retained their value. Bnt the
War against the Tuscaroras and other savages in 1712,
Creating another heavy debt, the colony issued forty‘

at security, and made payable into the treasury in ten

 so large that theivalue speedily sunk one half, and

far, as could be recollected. Before that period, the
usual form of disease in the throat, was that of a quin-
cy, which was often nialignant and fatal. F r’om the
year 17 35 to 1800, the malignant sore throat was epi-

We have some imperfect accounts of lights in the sky ;
andsuperstition has represented them as the forerun~
ners of” bloody wars ¢.<?V.]{1 other calamities. Soinetirnes
historians speak of them as troops of men, “armed and
rushing to battle. Such representations are the efl'u-
sions of weak and timid minds; these lights and all

others in the atmosphere proceeding from natural cau- i

see, are no more the harbingers of evil, than a shower
of rain or a blast of wind. For about three hundred
years past, our accounts of the northern lights, are tol-

erably correct. There was acliscontinuance of them-

eighty or ninety years, anterior to 1707, when a small

light was seen by persons in Europe. Buttl1€y"*Cl‘l(l4nO'Ce,

more than a hundred years. The zmtipathy l>etwr:en

524 Efect of Dissension in the Dzgferzse qf tlze Cob-
nées. The ill*e1Te.ct of a want of union was first felt, in
1637, in the Pequot war. Three governments were to
be consulted, and although all agreed in the necessity of
reducing the Pequots, yet for want of -mity of power
and effort, the Connecticut forces arrived first at the
field of action, and to prevent notice of their ar1~ivzt1
from reaching the Indians, they were obliged to attack
the fort alone ; and although they succeeded beyond
expectation, yet it was a desperate attempt, and mi—g«ht.
have been fatal to the assailants. Had the “coloriiesbeern
under the same jurisdiction, the troops might have 
assembled at the same time, and acted with utiited
force. In 1694», the commissioners of the unifietlcolyof-o
nies declared war against Ninigrate, a Nsrrageriset
chief; and theirforces were entrusted to ‘the coimfoand

a unity of councils and designs. I3-iany whole towns
and whole companies of men would probably have
been saved, if one wiil had directed all their opera-
tions‘. Capt. Lathrop and his company, who fell into
am ambuscade, between Deerﬁeid and Hadley, and
were cut to pieces, would have escaped, but for want
of union and concert of measures; for two or three
conipanies were within a few miles, inarching to join
them.

the union of tin? four infant settlements produced very
good efiects, by giving them l'1a.rmony of couneiis,
and strength of action, yet it was not suﬂieient to pre-
yent jealousies, divisions, and the consequent evils.
Springﬁeld,when first settled, was supposed to be under
the jurisdiction of Connecticut, but was afterwards
claiined by ii/Iassachusetts, and until the divisional line
was run, it controversy "isubsisted between the colonies
on that account. . But 9. more serious dispute arose on
account ofa duty which Connecticut imposed on goods,
belonging to Springﬁeld, exported from the river,

lwhieh duty was applied to the maintenance of a fort at
‘Saysbrook, to protect the 1"lV'C1' S€i.ﬂ§Z1‘fl€I1’iS, especially

against the Dutch. The question, C0nCCF11i1'lg‘ the

the comrnissio-ners decided in favor of ‘ Connecticut,
I‘;/I2ts‘s21clit1sie-tts,,by Way of ‘1~et_a1iati,on, laid a similar
duty on goods, passing the fort in Boston harbor. This

England_ and Holland, had attempted to engage the
Indians in a plot to destroythe English. The com-
missioners of Plymouth, Connecticut and New Haven
agreed on the necessity of a war to put a stop‘ to such
outrages and a dangerous conspiracy; but those of
Massachusetts opposed it, and no arguments‘or powers
of persuasionavailed. The legislature of Massachusetts
denied the authority of the commissionerseto declare:
war ; alledging that each colony was a sovereignty, and
could not be subject to another sovereign power; The,
other colonies held this to be a direct.violation,of.,.‘jg’tl:r¢7
‘articles of union---but the confederation was a . 
sand.~ The savages continued to purchase arms 
ammunition of the Dutch; and by the time of Phil’ip’s
war, they were well furnished and well acquainted with
arms. This proved the principal cause of that war ands
its horrors. A

and preserve it in purity. VVater, upon the surface of the
earth, exposed to a hot sun, would often hecome stag-

towering forest and inaccessible roclsts.

   75‘: Smface cma’ .s*trucz?m°e of Zlfa2c2z.'az'ns. If moun-
tains were composed of solid unbroken rocks or hard
clay, almost all the water failing on themwould rush
impetuously from their sides, sweepiiigeway the fruits
of human labor, and leaving the springs unsupplied.
To prevent this effect, the surface of mountains is cov-
ered with trees, shrubs, leaves and rocks, which detain
thevfalelilig showers, and impede the current. And the
better to aid t,l1e_design, the subterranean rocks are cleft
and broken in everyitii1‘ectio11, to furnish inlets for the
Water to penetrate into the bosom of the earth. There
sheltered from the causes which can render it impure,
§=3.?.‘}(l from the solar rays, which might infuse too great
a degree of heat, the water is lodged in suhterraneous
<:ave1‘ns, and preserved cool ; or slowly Winding in ﬁs-

77. Caverns and Clcfts. In large  mountains are
found deep pits, clefts and caverns, formed by nature,
or by streams of Water, or by earthquakes. Madison’s
cave, on the north side of the Blue Ridge in Virginia,
extends into the earth three hundred feet. Another
near the North Motintain extends horizontally four
hundred feet. Another called the Blatvévzg Catxe, emits
a current of air that prostrates Weeds at the distance of
twenty yards. T his current is stronger in dry frosty
Weather, than in long periods of rainy Weather. In
Antiparos, an island in the Grecian sea, is acavierfl,
eighteen hundred feet deep ; e and in Derbyshire, in Etr-
gland, is a gulf or cavern, which has been sounded to
the depth of two thousand eight hundredfeet, Without
reaching the bottom. In 1646, a mountain in Niachi-W3

tical knowledge. In pursuance of this design, it is intended, as
fartas practicable, to separfate the sciences, arts, and ditlerent
branches of knowledge, arranging each, under a distinct head,
and in treating each, to follow,as far as may be convenient,
the order of time and qfnature.

The first volume begins with what is usual in geographical   r
  treatises, a general View of the solar system, of which this

globe‘ is a constituent part. It then explains the general struc-
ture of the globe, the "materials which compose it, and the
distribution of those materialsupon the surface. Next follow
theidivisions of the surface, comprehending a general view of
the land, water, mountains, rivers and lakes. In the geogra-
phical descriptions. a View of the natural is-maczfure of a conti-
nent precedes a consideration of its arzg'ﬁcz'cz! state, arising from
its settlement and improvement by men. "As a knowledge of
ourpown country is most interesting to our own citizens, ade.
scription of the American continent, and especially of that part
which is comprehended within the limits of the United States,
though not falling-within the rule of chronological order, takes
place of all other parts of this system, and forms the substance
of tlietwo first volumes. This description comprehends a
View of the position and general structure of the continent ;

. arsummary history of its aboriginal inhabitants, their settle- =

ment, character andmanners. To this succeeds abrief histo-

wry of the discovery of America, and of the conquest and settle- -

merit of -the several parts of it, by ‘the Spaniards, French,
English and Portuguese--a shgrt account of the several grants,
chalrters and settlement of the several English colonies, and
,the most material occurrences in their political, civil,‘”ec-

ichssiastical and military afl‘ai'rs, from their first settlement to

theformation of thepresent federal constitution. The present
rolnnse brings doivn this historical sketch, to the important

eratofrtlie revolution.
Witli a view, to the utmost practicable degree of correct-~

;ness1,n“"reg‘ai'd to American affairs, the author has consulted
the most authentic liistoriesand ‘documents, which have hi-
therto been published; relying upon his own information,
only in casesgfalling under his own ‘observation. is; It has been
his aim to precludeevery statementor‘ relation of facts not

islands Thera and Therasia arose from the sea,

thirty seven years before Clirist. ’ One of theseislands
now called Santorin, is thirty five miles in A circumfer-

that when the warmer regions of America had he-

over the eastern parts of the continent, following the
course of rivers, antl’the shore of the Atlantic» In
this progress», they would first ﬁnd the rivers that fall
into the Dfissisippi, and pursuing them, would ﬁnd
and plantythe rich intervales on these rivers. Then
continuing their course, they would be led along the
Alabama, the Tennesee, the Ohio and the ‘Waubosh,
to their sources and crossing the mountains and the
lakes,wou'l‘d pursue the streams that fall into the Atlan-
tic. X And hence perhaps the tradition among the In-

that great regard is bad to the convenience of schools.‘ It
seems to_ be agreed that pthecatechetical is the form of writing.
best adapted to the understandings of children ; butithis is not
essential, provided‘ the passages which they are obliged to
learn, are not too long and complex. The work here‘begun,
is intended to be read by children inclasses, or committed to
memory. Those parts which are most proper to be learnt by
heart, are thrown into short passages--and the whole is so
divided that each pupil in reading will have a distinct portion.
At the beginning of each passage, is placed the subject of it,
expressed in fewwords, likethe title to a discourse. The pu-
pil will read this, as a title ortext, to the passage; that when
he commits the passage to memory, the words in Italics will
furnish the teacher with the question proper to be proposed.
This method will probably answer all the purposes of ques-s
tion and answer ;. at the same time, accommodate readers in
classes, and save manypages in avo1ume,which would other-4
ways be occupied with questions and the repetitions that re-
sult from them.

In Writing the names of Americanrivers, mountains, lakes
and places, we are subject to some uncertainty and."confusion.
Some of these names havetbeenhalways written according to
the sounds which the Englishannex to the Roman letters. In
these words therefore, we ﬁnd some degree of regularity. But
-many of the names have beenborrowed from the French who
discovered and settled par‘ticularparts of this continent; and
as the sounds which the French annex to the Roman charac-
ters, are not known to common English readers, sucli names

are liable to be mis-pronounced» The facility:iiitl1.vwhicll.1i

the English, within the“ last century, have adopted French

r words, without accommodating them to the genius of their

own language, is as disreputable to thetaste of the nation, asrit
has been injurious to the language. Whenthe Romans bar»-
rowed and incorporated foreign words into their language,
they gave them a Roman orthography,~and termination  a;s«i“n
Britannia, Gallia, Hispania, Herthus. The French and Spanish
ards do the same; as in Martinique,Dominique, Ameriqne-as
Martinico, Dominico, Ameri,c0--each“nati‘on suiting-theporw
thography to the genius of its own language. But the English,
neglecting the beauty and regularity of their own vlyanguagrgea
adopt foreign _words in their foreign, spelling; thus incommo-s

now used in schools for reading, are composed of solemn div
(lactic discourses, general lessons ofimorality, or detached
passages of liistory. These are indeed useliil ; but why may
not children 1'e2;<l for common lessons, the knofvii and estab-
lished principles in plulosophy, natural history, botany, rhe-
toric, mechanics,and ot‘n<:r sciences ? Many of. these princi-

pies may be made intelligible to youth ; and where this can-V

not be done, the pupil willl become accustomed to the pro‘-
nunciation and use of many terms of art, wl:s~ich otherwise he
would not learn ; and the want of which is discoverable among
many men even ofliberal education. It is a great defect in our
1no_de ‘of education to limit the reading of youth to books on a
few particular subjects ; so that when young men are ushered
into the World. many and even most of them are'unacquaint-
ed with even the appropriate terms used in other sciences.

But the advantages ofa more diffusive system oi'~i:nstruction
will not rest here--By reading frequently and repeatedly,
passages containing just rules and principles, even above the
comprehension of young minds,,the pupilswill learn many of
them by heart,and hear the impressions into future life ;‘ by
which means, when their understandings are more matured,
they willbe enabled todirect,“ to useful purposes, the princi-5
plesiwith which they had stored their minds in school. In
this manner,'useful rules and facts, acquired in oxyoutls, like
seed sown in a ‘good  will, produce their fruit in i+ivp‘e;ri
years, and increase the harvest of knowledge aizgl ig3op,ro,vfes=
ment, to enrich the connnunity. ,

In the language, the author has aimed to use a style, Wlsiclx
is plain without being vulgar; and teclmnical, witltout fheeslis
less obscurity. A

In every partof this work, occasions frequently occur . of
deducingmoral and pious reﬁections from the subjects treated.
On such occasions, special care is taken to lead the mind of
the reader, from a consideration of the order, beauty and lit-'
ness of all parts of nature, to contemplate the necessity and

certainty of the existence of a Creator, of inﬁnite powexywis-l

dam and goodness. This mode of employing natural philo-
sophy in the service of religionancl piety, has been practised
by the ablest authors and best men in all ages»--it furnishes
powerful aids to that firm belief in the being and providence
of God, and that pious vene-ration for Iiiscychai-actergand attri-
butesf, wliicli are the prime ornaments of; a wise man, and as

England, Sir Richard Grenville arrived with provisions
and ‘an additional number of adventurers. Not ﬁnd-
mg the forinei‘ colony, he left a few people and return-
ed to England.--In 1587 a third expedition was pro-
secuted under l\lr. VVh_ite, with threeships, and one.
hundred and ﬁfteen persons were left at "Roanoke. It
was three yearsﬁbefore any supplies were sent to main-
tain this Colony, and when Governor VVhite arrived
in1590, no Englishmen were to be found, and it gas
€‘V,ld,(?11iIiil"1€fy had perished with hunger or been slain: 
 savages. The last adventurers therefore returned,
azgdiall further attempts to establish a colony in Vir-
ginia were postponed.

Capt. Gosnold sailed from iEngl'and with a small num-
ber of adventurers, arrived at Cape Cod and coasting
smlthward landed on Cuttehunk, the most southerly of
the Elizabeth Islands. on a small island, in a fresh
Water pond, vvitliin the large island, he built a hut and
rfeinained about six weeks. But his men not being Wil-
ling to be left there, they all returned and effected
nothing. . Gosnold gave Cape Cod its name, from the
ahundance of Cod Fish about it--He also named the
Elizabeth   Islands, and Martha’s Vineyard. But the
island‘ which he called 'Martha"s Vinyard is a small isl-
and near it, now called No1nan’§ land ;« the name has
since been transferred to the present island of that
name, whieli he called Dover Cliff, from the resem-
blance of the high steep bank, now called Gay Head,
to the cliffs of Dover in England.

304 T/zérd V z',rg‘z'2zia C'/zarteir. , A third charter was
obtained by the London Company, dated March 12,
1612. The chief object of this seems to have been to
obtain an enlargement and an alteration of the powers
of the company, as the first governors of the colony’
found many of the settlers disobedient and refractory ,;
and also to extend the imits of the grant so as to
comprehencl the island of Bermuda, which, by the
shipwreck of Sir George Somers, had been explored,
and was deemed an object of, magnitude to the com-
pany, but did not fall within their patent. In the
third charter, the jurisdiction of the company was ex-
tended over all islands within three hundred leagues of
the boundary of the first patent on the ocean, and be-
tween 30 and 41 degrees of latitude.-—-This included
Bermuda. ~ V ‘

Challons to make .1 urther discoveries and begina plan-
tation in America ;,but steering southward, he was
tal<e11 by a Spanish ﬂeet and carried to Spain. A ship
under Capt. Prinn, arrived, explored the rivers and

‘hays, but not ﬁnding Challons, returned. The next

year, Capt. Popham, with two ships, and one hundred
adventurers, came to America, and began a plantation
on Monhegan, an island near the mouth of Sagadahne,
now called Kennebec, in the monthjof August. But
the following winter proving to be unusually severe,
President Popham dying, and a magazine of their
provisions being burnt, theesettlement Was broke up,
and the survivors returned to England.
