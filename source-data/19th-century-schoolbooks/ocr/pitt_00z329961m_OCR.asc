8        PERIOD I....1492....1607....DISCOVERIES.
terprises of the Portuguese, who were attempting to discover a passage to the East Indies, by doubling the southern extremity of Africa.
Christopher Colutmbus, a native of Genoa, roused by
these enterprises, and persuaded. that a western passage
to the East Indies was practicable, by steering across the
Atlantick, determined to ascertain the point by experi-'ment.
Accordingly, after encountering, various difficulties he
sailed from Spain, Fridclay, Aug. 3d, 1492, with a small
fleet, under the patronage of Ferdinand and Isabella, then
on the united thrones of Castile and Arragon; and on the
12th of Oct. 14927 discovered the Island San Salvador.
This island is three thousand miles xwest of the Canaries
-the most western land known at the time of Columbus'
discovery,-and is now known as one of the Bahamnas.
Columbus, after maturino his plan, first offered to sail under
tle patronage of the Senate of Gen_oa, btt they treated his
project as visionary. Tle next solicited the patronage of the
Portuguese, but w;as denied.
Disappointed in th-ese applications, and despair ing of assistance from Henry VII. of England, to whom he had sent his
brother Bartholornmew, but, who, bei;ag captured, did not reach
England for several vears; Colmnbus next laid his plans before Ferdinand and Isabella.
Ferdinand was long deaf to his application; but through the
favour of Isabella, who listened to his plans, a treaty was made
with him. The queen sold her jewels and defra-ved the expense of his outfit and voyage. His fleet consisted of the
Sa&amp;nta Maria, Piltaa, antd N~gina, with ninety men, victualled Ibr a
year. The whole expense was the small sum of about sixteen
thousand dollars.
Columbus when he sailed expected to land in India; but
Providence was opening his way to an unknown world. IHe
first touched at the Canaries, and thence stretched westward
into seas as yet unexploried.
After sailing about two months, the crew became anxious
and discontented. T'hey wvere appalled at the extent of their
voyage, and despaired of accomplishing the purposes for which
it was undertaken. Columbus, hiowever, in the midst of mutiny, and while every heart around hin sunk under the most
gloomy apprehensions, remained firm and ihflexible. He coned by taxes upon the colonies, imnposed by acts of pcrlia?ment. But to
allow the British government the right of taxation-to lay the
colonies under the obligations of a debt to be thus liquidatedto subject themselves to the rapacity of king's collectors, we
scarcely need say, was a proposal which met with universal
disapprobation.
VI. Early in the spring of 1755, preparations were
made, by the colonies, ior vigorous exertions against the
enemy. Four expeditions were planned.    One against
the French in Nova Scotia; a second against the French
on the Ohio; a thtird against Crown Point; and a fourth
against Niagara.
VII. The expedition against Nova Scotia, consisting of three thousand men, chiefly from Massachusetts,
was led by Gen. Nlonckton and Gen. Winslow.   With
these troops, they sailed fromn Boston, May 20th, and on
the 1st of June, arrived at Chignecto, on the bay'of
Fundy. After being joined by three hundred British
troops and a small train of artillery,.they proceeded
against fort Beau Sejour, which, after four days investment, surrendered.
The name of the fort was now changed to that of
Cumberland. From this place Gen. Monckton proceeded further into the country, took the other forts in possession of the French, and disarmed the inhabitants. By
this successful expedition, the English possessed them.
selves of the whole country of Nova Scotia, a part of
which, as already noticed, the French claimed; its tran
quillity was restored and placed upon a permanent basis.
In this whole expedition, the English took but twenty men.
Large qutantities of provisions and military stores fell into their
hands, with a number of valuable cannon.
The French force in Nova Scotia being subdued, a difficult
question occurred, respecting the disposal to be made of the
inhabitants. Fearing that they mighlt join the French in Canada, whom they had before furnished with intelligence, quarters, and provisions, it wvas determnined to disperse them among
the English colonies. Under this order, one thousand nine
hundred were thus dispersed.  
VIII. The expedition against the French, on the
Ohio, was led by Gen. Braddock, a British officer, who
PERIOD IV....1756.... 17705. /
98             FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR.                   99
commenced his march from Virginia, in June, with about
two thousand men. Apprehensive that Fort du Quesne,
against whichl he was proceeding, might be reinforced,
Braddock, with one thousand two hundred selected troops,
hastened his march, leaving Col. Dunbar to follow more
slowly wth the other troops and th.e heavy baggage.
On the 8th of July, Braddock had advanced sixty miles
forward of Col. Dunbar, and within twelve or fourteen
miles of Fort du Quesne. HIere he was advised by his officers to proceed with caution, and was earnestly entreated by Col. Washington, his aid, to permit him to precede
the army, and guard against surprise. Too haughty and
self-confident to receive advice, Braddock, without any
knowledge of the condition of the enemy, continued to
press towards the fort. About twelve o'clock, July 9th,
when within seven miles of the fort, he was suddenly attacked by a body of French and Indians.
Although the enemy did not exceed five hundred, yet,
after an action of three hours, Braddock, under whom five
horses had been killed, was mortally wounded, and his
troops defeated. The loss of the English army was sixtyfour out of sixty-five officers, and aboutt one half of the privates.
This unfortunate defeat of Gen. Braddock is to be ascribed
to his imprudence and too daring intrepidity. Had he attended
to those precautions which were recommended to him, he would
not have been thus aimbuscaded; or had he wisely retreated
firom a concealed enemyv. and scoured the thicket with his canrnon, the melancholy catastrophe might have been avoided.
3But, obstinately riveted to the spot on which he was first attacked, he vainly continued his attempt to form his men in regular order, although, by this means, a surer prey to the enemy,
until being himself wounded, hlie could no longer be accessary
to the destruction of human life.
A remarkable fact in the history of this affair remains to be
told. Gen. Braddock held the provincial troops in great contempt..Consequently, he kept'the Virginians, and other provincials, who were in the action, in the rear. Yet, although
equally exposed with the rest, far from being affected with the
fears that disordered the regular troops, they stood fiirn andunbroken, and, under Col. Washington, covered the retreat of
the regulars, and saved them f'om total destruction.
The retreat of the army, after' Braddockli was wounded, was
precipitate. No pause was made until the rear division was
met. This division, on its junction with the other, was seized
with the same spirit of flighlt with the retreating, and both divisons proceeded to Fort Cumberland, a distance of nearly one
hundred and twenty miles from the place of action.
HIad the troops, even here, recovered their spirits and re.
turned, success might still have crowned the expedition. At
least, the army might have rendered the most important service to the cause, by preventing the devastations and inhuman
mnurders, perpetrated by7 the French and Indians, during the
summer, on the weste-rn borders of Virginia and Pennsylva
nia. But, instead of adopting a course so salutary and important, Col. Dunbar, leaving the sick and wounded at Cumberland, marched with his troops to Philadelphia.
IX. The expedition against Crown Point was led by
Gen. William Johnson, a member of the council of New.
York, and altihough it failed as to its mrnain object, yet its
results diffused exultat-on thirough the American colonies,
and dispelled the gloom whiich followed Braddock's defeat.
The army, under Johnson, arrived at the south end of
Lake Geor,e the latter part of August.   While here,
intelligence was received that a body of the enemy, two
thousand in number, had landed at Southbay, now Wlite/tall, under command of Baron Dieskau, and were marching towards Fort Edwavrd for the purpose of destroying
the provisions and military stores there.
At a couficil of WVar, hleld on thie morring of Sept. 8th,
it was resolved to detach a party to intercept the French
and save the fort. This party consisted of twelve hlundred men, commanded by Col. Ephraim      Williams of
Deerfield, Massach usetts.  Unfortunately, this detachment
was surprised by Dieskaun, whlo was lying in ambush for
them. After a most signal slaughter, in which Col. Williams and H-endrick, a renowned Mohawk'sachemi, and
many othler officers fell, tihe detachment was obliged to retreat.
The firing was heard in the camp of Johnson, and as
it seemed to approach nearer and nearer, it was natrally.V'.1,RT
I 0 D     I'L'iy.... 1689....1756.FRENCHI AND INDIAN WAR.
conjectured that the English troops were repulsed. The
best preparations which the time allowed, were made to
receive the advancing foe. Dieskau with his troops,
soon appeared and commenced a spirited attack.
They were received, however, with so much intrepidity-the cantnon and musquetry did so much execution
amrnong their ranks, that the enemy retired in great disor
der, having experienced a signal defeat. The loss of the
French was not less than eight hundred, Dieskau estimated them himself at one thousand, and this loss was
rendered still more severe to the French, by a mortal
wound which this distinguished officer himself received,
and in conseqiuence of which he fell into the hands of the
English. The loss of the English did not much exceed
two hundred.
Few events of no greater magnitude leave stronger impressions than resulted from the battle of Lake George.
Following as it did the discomfiture of Braddock, it served to restore the honour of the British arms, and the tone
of the public mind.
At the time it was meditated to send a detachment under
Col. Williams, to intercept Dieskau, the number of men proposed was mentioned to Henidrick, the Mohawk chief, and his
opinion askied. He replied, "If they are to fight, they are
too few: if they are to be killed, they are too many." The
number was accordingly increased. Ger. Johnson proposed
also to divide the detatchment into three parties. Upon this,
Hendrick took three sticks, and putting them together, said to
him, "Put these together, and you cannot break them; take
them one by one, and you will break them easily." The hint
succeeded, and Ilendrick's sticks saved many of the party,
and probably the whole army from destruction.
Early in the action, Gen. Johnson was wounded, and Gen.
Lyman succeeded to the command. which he held through the
day. To this gentleman's gallant exertions, the success of the
da3r, under Providence, was chiefly to be ascribed. Yet it is
remarkable, that Gen. Johnson made no mention of Gen. Lymnan in his official letter, announcing the intelligence of the
victory  The ambition of Johnson was too great, and his avarice too greedy, to acknowledge the merits of a rival. Gen.
Johnson was created a baronet, and parliament voted hiim five
thousand pounds sterling, in consideration of his success. Thie
9a
101102             PERIOD IV....1756....1775
reward of Gen. Lyman was the esteem and honour of the peopie among whom he lived.
Among the wounded of the French, as already stated, was
the Baron Dieskau. He had received a ball through his leg,
and being unable to follow his retreating army, was found by
an English soldier, resting upon the stump of a tree, with
scarcely an attendant. Dieskau, apprehensive for his safety,
was feeling for his watch, in order to give it to the soldier,
when the man, suspecting that he was feeling for a pistol, levelled his glun, and wounded him in the hips. He was carried to
the camp, and treated wvith great kindness. From the camp
he was taken to Albany and Newv-York, whence, some time
after, he sailed for England, where he died. Hle was a superiour officer, possessed of honourable feeling,s, and adorned with
highlly polished manners. One stain, however, attaches to
his character. Before his engagement with Col. Williams'
corps, he gave orders to his troops neither to give nor taKe
quarter.
X. The expedition against NViagara was committed to
Gov. Shirley of MAassachusetts, whose force amounted to
two thousand five hundred men. But the season was too
far advanced, before his preparations were completed, to
effect any thing of importance.-After proceeding to Oswego, on Lake Ontario, the army being poorly supplied
with provisions, and the rainy season approaching, the
expedition was abandoned, and the troops returned to
Albany.  Thus ended the campaign of 1755.
XI. T., the spring of the ensuing year, 1756, Gov.
Shirley was succeeded by Gen. Abercrombie, who was
appointed to command, until the arrival of the earl of
London, commander in chief of all his majesty's forces in
Amnerica.
The hostilities of the two preceding years had been
carried on without any formal proclamation' of war; but
this year, June 9th, as already stated, war was declared
by Great Britain against France, and soon after, by
France against Great Britain, in turn.
The plan of operations for the campaign of 156 embraced the attack of Niagara and Crown Point, whiich
were still in possesion of the French. Both
were of great importance; the former beingFRENCH AND INDIAN WAR.
ing link in the line of fortifications, between Canada ana
Louisiana; and the latter commanding Lake Champlain,
and guarding the only passage, at that time, into Canada.
But important as were these posts, the reduction of
neither was this year accomplished, nor even attempted,
owing, chiefly, to the great delays of those who held the
chief command.
Troops were raised for the expedition against Crown Point,
amounting to seven thousand, the command of whom was assigned to major-general Winslow, of Massachusetts. But his
march was delayed by obstacles ascribed to the improvidence
of Abercrombie.
After the mortal wound received by Dieskau, at the
battle of Lake George, the Marquis de Montcalm, an able
and enterprising officer, succeeded to the command of the
French forces. In the month of August, this officer, with
eight thousand regulars, Canadians and Indians, invested
the fort at Oswego, on the south side of Lake Ontario,one of the most important, posts held by the English in
America,-and in a few days took it. On the receipt of
this intelligence, lord Loudon, who had arrived in Albany,
and entered upon the command, despatched orders to
Gen. Winslow, on his marched towards Crown Point, not
to proceed.
The fall of the fort at Oswego was most unfortunate for the
English, and their loss of men smade prisoners, and munitions of
war, peculiarly severe. By the capture of this post, the enemy obtained the entire command of thb lakes Ontario and Erie,
and of tihe whole country of the Five Nations. Sixteen hundred mnen were made prisoners, and one hundred and twenty
pieces of cannon were taken, with fourteen mortars, two sloops
of war, and two hundred boats and batteaux.
After this disastrous event, all offensive operations were
immediately relinquished, although it was then three
months to the time of the usual decampment ofthe army.
Thus through the inactivity of a man, whose leading trait
was indecision, not one object of the campaign was gained, nor one purpose accomplished, either honourable or
important.
XII. Notwithstanding the failure of the campaign of
A1051U4              PERIOD IV....1756....1775.
this season, the British Parliament made great prepara,
tions to prosecute the war the succeeding year, 1757. In
July, an armaiient of eleven ships of the line and fifty
transports, with more than six thousand troops, arrived at
Halifax, destined for the reduction of Louisburg.-The
colonies had been raising men Ibr an expedition against
Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Great was their mortification and disappointment, when they learned from the
olders of lord Loudon, that these troops were to be em~
ployed against Louisburg. Such inconstancy and fluc
tuation appeared beneath the dignity of the commande1
in chief. But they were obliged to submnit, and lord Lou
don proceeded to join the armament at IHalifax.
So dilatory were their measures, however, that before
they were ready to sail, Louisburg was reinforced by a
fleet of seventeen sail, and with troops to make it nine
thousand strong. On the reception of this intelligence, it
was deemed inexpedient to proceed, and the expedition
was abandoned.
XII1. While weakness and ipdecision were marking
the counsels of the English, the French continued to urge
on their victories. Montcalm, still commander of the
French in the north, finding the troops withdrawn friom
Halifax, for the reduction of Louisburg, seized the occa.
sion to make a descent on Fort William Henry, situated
on the north shore of Lake George.  The garrison of the
fort consisted of three thousand men. With a force of
nine thousand men, Montcalm laid seige to it.-After a
gallant defence of six days, the garrison surrendered, thus
giving to Montcalhn the command of the lake and of the
western frontier.
The spirited and protracted defence of the fort, against such
numbers, reflects the highest hoaoutr' upon its brave commander, Col. Munroe. Six days was the enemy kept at bay, with
anabated resolution, in full expectation of assistance from Gen.
Webb, who lay at Fort Edward, only fifteen miles distant,
with an army of four thousand men.
The character of Gen. Webb continues sullied, by his unpardonable indifference to the perilous situation of his brethrenim arms, at Fort William H-enry. It deserves to be lmkwn
that Sir William Johnson, after very importunate solicitations,
obtained leave of Gen. Webb to march with as many as would
volunteer in the service, to the relief of Munroe.
At the beat of the drums, the provincials, almost to a man,
sallied forth, and were soon ready and eager for the march.
After being under arms almost all day, what were their feelings when Sir William, returning from head-quarters, informed
them that General Webb had forbidden them to march!
The soldiers were inexpressibly mortified and enraged,and their commander did himself no commnon honour in the
tears he shed, as he turned from his troops, and retired to his
tent.
The defence of Fort William Henry was so gallant, that
Col. Munroe, with his troops, was admnitted to an honourable
capitulation. The capitulation, however, was most shamefully
broken. While the troops were marching out at the gate ofthe
fort, the Indians attached to Montcalm's party dragged the men
from their ranks, and with all the inhumanity of savage feeling,
plundered them of their baggage, and butchered them in cold
blood. Out of a New-Hampshire corps of two hundred, eighty
were missing.
It is said that effortswere made by the French to restrain
the barbarians, but the truth of the assertion may wvell be
doubted, when it is considered that Montcalm's force was at
least seven thousand French, and yet these barbarians were
not restrained.
XIV. In 1758, most fortunately for the honour of
the British'arms, and for the salvation of the colonies, a
change took place in the ministry of England. The celebrated Pitt, lord Chatham, now placed at the head of
the administration, breathed a new soul into the British
-ouncils, and revived the energies of the colonies, weakened and exhausted by a series of ill-contrived and unfortunate expeditions.  The tide of success now turned in
favour of the English, whi continued, with some few exceptions, to achieve one victory after another, until the
whole of Canada surrendered to the British arms.
Pitt, upon coming into office, addressed a circular to
the colonial governours, in which he assured them of the
determination of the ministry to send a large force to
America, and called upon them to raise as many troops,
as the number of inhabitants would allow.  The oioi(Snies were prompt and liberal in furnishing the requisite
supplies. Massachusetts, Connecticut and New-Hampshire, unitedly raised fifteen thousand men, who were
ready to take the field in May.
XV. Three expeditions were proposed-the first
against Louisburg; the second against Ticonderoga; the
third against Fort du Quesne.
XVI. On the expedition against Louisburg, admiral
Boscawen sailed from Halifax, May 28th, with a fleet of
twenty ships of the line, eighteen frigates, and an army of
fourteen thousand men, under the command of brigadier
Gen. Amherst, next to whom in comnmand was Gen,
Wolfe. On the 26th of July, after a vigorous resistance,
this fortress was surrendered, and with it five thousand
seven hlundred and thirty-seven prisoners of war, and one
hundred and twenty cannon, besides which the enemy lost
five ships of the line and four frigates. At the same time,
Isle Royal, St. Johns, with Cape Breton, fell into the hands
of the English, who now became masters of the coast
fromn St. Lawrence to Nova Scotia.
The surrender of this fortress was a more signal loss to
France than any which she had sustained since the commencement of the war. It greatly obstructed her communications
with Canada, and was powerfully instrumental in hastening
the subjugation of that country to the Biitish crown.
XVII. The expedition against Ticonderoga was conducted by Gen. Abercrombie, commander in chief in America, lord Loudon having returned to England. An army
of sixteen thousand men, nine thousand of whom were provincials, followed his standard, besides a formidable traini
of artillery.
Having passed Lake George, the army proceeded with
great difficulty towards the fortress.  Unfortunately, Gen.
Abercrombie trusted to others, who were incompetent to
the task, to reconnoitre the ground and entrenchments of
the enemy, and, without a knowledge of the strength of
the places, or of the proper points of attack, issued his
orders to attempt the lines without bringing up a single:piece of artillery.             FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR.
The army advanced to the charge with the greatest intrepidity, and, for more than fbur hours maintained the
attack withl incredible obstinacy.
After the loss of nearly two thousand in killed and
wounded the troops were summoned away. The retreat
was as unhappy as the attack had been precipitate and
ill advised.  Not a doubt can rationally exist, that had
the siege been prosecuted with prudence and vigour, the
reduction of the place would have been easily accomplished, without so great a waste of human life, as the
garrison amounted to but little more than three thousand
men.
The passage of Abercrombie, across lake George on his way
with his army to Ticonderoga, was efiected by means of one thousand and thirty-five boats. Thie splendour of the military parade
on the occasion was eminently imposing, and deserves to be
recorded. A late writer, Dr. Dwight, thus describes it.
"The morning was remnarkably bright and beautiful; and
the fleet moved with exact regularity to the sound of fine
martial musick.'The ensigns waved and glittered in the
sunbeams, and the anticipation of future triumph shone in
every eye.  Above, beneath, around, the scenery was that
of enchantment. Rarely has the sun, since that luminary
was first lighted up in the heavens, dawned on such a complicationl of beauty and magnificence." How greatly did all the
parade which was displayed, and all the anticipation which
was indulged, add to the mortification of the defeat wicta
followed!
After his repulse, Gen. Abercrombie retired to'his
former quarters on Lake George. Here, anxious in any
way to repair the mischief and disgrace of defeat, he
consented, at the solicitation of Col. Bradstreet, to detach him with three thousand men, against Fort Frontenac, on the northwe.st side of the outlet of Lake.Ontario.
With these troops, mostly provincial, Bradstreet sailed
down the Ontario, landed within a mile of the fort, opened
his batteries, and, in two days, forced this important fortress to su render.  Nine armed vessels, sixty cannon,
sixteen mortars, and a vast quantity of ammunition, &amp;c.

trived to pacify the spirit of rebellion, by promising to return,
if land should not be discovered within three days.
The night of the 11th of October, 1492, was memorable to
Columbus, and to the world. Convinced from appearances
that land was near, he ordered the sails furled, and a watch
set. No eye, however, was shut. All on board was suspense
and sleepless expectation.
About midnight, the cry of land! land! was heard on board
the Pinta. The morning came,-October 12th 0. S.-and
realized their anticipations. The island was distinctly in view.
The occasion demanded an acknowledgment to HIM, who had
so auspiciously guided their way. All, therefore, bowed in
humble gratitude, and joined in a hymn of thanks to God.
Columbus, in a rich dress, and with a drawn sword, soon
after landed with his men, with whom having kneeled and
kissed the ground with tears of joy, hie took formal possession
of the Island, in the name of Queen Isabella, his.patron. On
landing, tle Spaniards were surprised to find a race of people,
quite unlike any that they had ever seen before. They were of a
dusky, copper colour-naked-beardless, with long black hair,
floating on their shoulders, or bound in tresses round their
heads. The natives were still more surprised at the sight of
the Spaniards, whom they considered as the children of the sun,
their idol. The ships they looked upon as animals, with eyes
of lightning, and voices of thunder.
Having spent some time in examining the country, and 4n
an amicable traffic with the natives, Columbus set sail on his
return. He was overtaken by a storm which had nearly proved
fatal. During the storm, Colunibus hastily enclosed in a cake
of wax, a short account of his voyage and discovery which he
put into a tight cask, and threw it into the sea. This he did,
hoping that if he perished, it might fall into the hands of some
navigator, or be cast aslhore, and thus the knowledge of his discovery be preserved to the world. But the storm abated, and
he arrived safe in Spain, March 15th, 1493.
For this discovery, it being the first, and having laid the
foundation for all the subsequent discoveries in America, Columbus was doubtless entitled to the honour of giving a name
to the New World. But he was robbed of it by the address of
Americus Vespucius. This adventurer was a Florentine, who
sailed to,the New World in 1499, with one Alonzo Ojeda, a
gallant and active officer, who had accompanied Columbus in
his first voyage. On his return, he published so flattering an
account of his voyage, that his niame was given to the continent
wvith manifest injustice to Columbus.
After this, ColuLnbus made several other voyages, bit did  lO8             PERIOD IV....1756....1775.
the bulwark of their dominion over the western regions,
was a third expedition contenmplated this year. This enterprise was entrusted to Gen. Forbes, who left Philadelphia in July, but did not arrive at Pu Quesne till late in
November. The force collected for the attack amounted
to eight thousand effective men. An attack, however,
was needless, the fort having been deserted by the garrison the evening before the arrival of the army. On taking quiet possession of the place Forbes, in honour of
Mlr. Pitt, called it Pittsburg.
Notwithstanding the defeat of Ticonderoga, the campaign closed withl honour to the colonies, and to the nation in general. The successes of the year prepared the
way for the still greater achievements of the ensuing
year.
XIX. Another event of this year concurred in bringing to pass the fortunate issues of the next. This was a
treaty of peace and friendship with the Indian nations
inhabiting between the Apalachian mountains, the Alleghanies, and the lakes. This treaty was concluded at
Easton, sixty miles from Philadelphia.
The managers of the treaty on the part o0F1 Great Britain,
were the governours of Pennsylvania and New-Jersey, Sir
William Johnson, four members of the council of Pennsylvania, six members of assembly, and two agents from NewvJersey.
JThe tribes represented on this occasion, and with which the
treaty was made, were the Mohawls, Oneidas, Onondagoes,
Cayugas, Senecas, Tuscaroras, Nanticoqpies, and Conays, the
Tuteloes, Chugnuts, Delawares, Unarnies, Minisinks, Mohicans, and Wappingers.  The whole number of Indians,
including women and children, present, amounted to five hundred.
XX. The campaign of 1759 had for its object the
entire conquest of Canada. For this purpose, it was determined that three powerful armies should enter Canada
by different routes, and attack, at nearly the same time,
all the strong holds of the French in that country. These
were Ticonderoga and Crown Point, Niagara      and109
XXI. Gen. Amherst, who had succeeded Abercrom..
bie, as commander in chief, led one division against Ticonderoga, which he reached July 22. This fortress
soon surrendered, the principal part of the garrison hav.
ing retired to Crown Point. Having strengthened Ticonderoga, the armny next proceeded against this latter
place, and took quiet possession of it, thle enemy having
fled before their arrival.
The French retired to the Isle aux Noix, situated at the
northern extremity of Lake Champlain, where they were
strongly encamped with a force of three thousand five hundred
men, and a powerful artillery. Gen. Amheist designed to follow up his successes against them in that quarter, but the want
of a suitable naval armament prevented.
XXII. The second division of the army, commanded
by Gen. Prideaux, was destined against ATiagara, at
which place they arrived July 6thl, without loss or opposition.  The place was inmmediately invested- on the
24th of the month, a general battle took pJace, which decided the fate of Niagara, and placed it in the hands of
the English.
Four days previous to this battle, that able and distinguished
officer, General Prideaux, was killed by the bursting of a coliorn. The command devolved on Sir William Johnson, who
successfully put in execution the plans of his lamented pledecessor.
XXIII. Whlile thle Englishl troops were achieving these
important victories in Upper Canada, Gen. Wolfe was
prosecuting the most important enterprise of the campaign, viz. the reduction of Quebec. Embarking at
Louisburg with eight thousand men, under convoy of Admirals Saunders and Holnes, he landed with his troops
in June on the island of Orleans, a little below Quebec.
After several attempts to reduce the place which prov.
ed unsuccessfuLl, Wolfe conceived the project of ascending with his troops, a precipice of from 150 to 200 feet,
by which he would reach the plains of Abraham. lying
south and west of the city, and thus gailn access to the
enemy, in a less fortified spot.
This ascent he effected with his army, and ere Mont-,
10,110
ralm, the French general, was aware of it, tihe army had
fibrmed on the heights of Abraham, and were prepared for
hattie.
Here, on the morning of the 13 th of September, Wolfe
met the French army under Montcalm, and after a severe
and bloody contest, in which both these brave commnanders fell, victory decided in favour of the English. A
thousand prisoners were taken, and a thousand of the
enemny were killed.  The loss of the English, in killed
and wounded, did not exceed' six hundred. Five days
after, the city capitulated; the inhabitants were to enjoy
their civil and religious rights, and remain neutral during
the war. The city was garrisoned under the command of
Gen. Murray.
Determined from the first io take the place, impregnable
as it was accounted, the measures of Gen. Wolfe were singularly bold, and apparently repugnant to all the maxims of war.
His attention was first drawn to point Levi, on the southerr
bank of the St. ILawrence, upon which after taking possessioc
of it, he erected batteries. By means of these he destroyed
many houses, but from this point it was soon apparent thai
little impression could be made on the fortifications of the
town.
Finding it impracticable thus to accomplish his purpose.
Wolfe next decided on more daring measures. For the purpose of drawing Montcalm to a general battle, Wolfe with his
troops crossed the river Montmorenci, and attacked the enemy
in their entrenchments. Owing, however, to the grounding of
some of the boats which conveyed the troops, a part of the detachmnent did not land so soon as the others. The corps that
first landed, without waiting to form, rushed forward impetuously towards the enemy's entrenchments. But their courage
proved their ruin. A close and wel directed fire fromn tho
enemy cut them down in great numbers.
Montcalm's party had now landed, and were drawn up on
the beach in order. But it was near' night, a thunider storm
was approaching, and the tide was rapidly setting in. Fearirg
the consequences of delay, Wolfe ordered a retreat across the
Montmorenci, and returned to his quarters on the Isle of Or.
leans. In this rencounter, his loss amounted to near six hun.

portance of taking this strongest hold-he knew the expectations of his countrymen,-he well knew that no military conduct could shine that was not gilded with success.
Disappointed tlius far, and worn down with fatigue and
watching, General Wolfe fell violenritly sick. Scarcely had
he recovered, before he proceeded to put in execution a plan
which had been matured on his sick bed. This was to proceed
up the river, gain the heights of Abraham, and draw Montcalm
to a general engagement.
Accordingly, the troops were transported up the river about
nine miles. On the 12th of Sept. one hour after midnight,
Wolfe and his troops left the ships, and in boats silently dropped down the current, intending to land a league above Cape
D)iamond, and there ascend the bank leading to the station he
vished to gain. Owing, however, to the rapidity of the river,
they fell below the intended place, and landed a mile, or a mile
and a half, above the city.
The operation was a critical one, as they had to navigate in
silence down a rapid stream, and to find a righlt place for
landing, which amid surrounding darkness, might be easily
mistaken. Besides this, the shore was shelving, and the bank
so steep and lofty, as scarcely to be ascended, even witho'tt opposition from an enemy. Indeed the attempt was in the treatest danger of being defeated by an occurrence peculiarly interesting, as marking the very great delicacy of the tranaaction.
One of the French sentinels, posted along the shore, as the
English boats were descending, challenged them in the customary military language of the French: "Qui vit?" "who goes
there &gt;?" to which a captain in Frazeris regiment, who had
served in Holland, anld was familiar with the French language
and customs, promptly.replied," 1la France." The next question
was still more embarnkssing, for the centinel demanded," a quel
regiment?" "to what regiment." The captain, who happened
to know the name of a regiment which was up the river with
Bougainville, promptly rejoined, "de la Reine," " the Queen'%."
The soldier immediately replied "passe," for he concluded at
once, that this was a French convoy of provisions, which, as
the English had learned from some deserters, was expected to
pass down the river to Quebec. The other sentinels were deceived in a similiar nannrer; but one, less credulous than thoe
rest, running down to the water's edge, called ouat "Pourquoi~
est ce que vous ne parlez plus haut?"'1 Whiy dont you speak louder?" The same captain, with perfect self-commiand, repiied.,
Tais toi, nous serons -e.tentdu!" "IItrshs we shll be overhleard
1I11-1 2           rIERIOD IV....1756....1775..  
and discovered!" The sentry, satisfied with this caution, re
tired, and and the boats passed in safety.
About an h-our before day, the army began to ascend the
preclpice, the distance of one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet, almost perpendicular ascent, above which spread
the plains of Abraham. By daylight, Sept. 13th, this almost
incredible enterprise had been effected-the desired siation
was attained, the army was formed, and readv to meet tho
enemy.
To Montcalm, the intelligence that the English were occupying the heights of Abraham was most surprising. ThIe im.
possibility of ascending the precipice he considered certain)
and therefore had taken no measures to fbrtify its lino. But,
no sooner was he informed of the position of the English army,
than perceiving, a battle no longer to be avoided, he prepared
to fight. Between nine and ten o'clock, the two armies, about
equal in numbers, met face to face;
The battle now commenced. Inattentive to the fire of a
body of Canadians and Indians, one thousand five htrundred of
whom Montcalm had stationed in the cornfields and bushes,
Wolfe directed his troops to reserve their fire for the main body
of the French, now rapidly advancing. On thieir approach
within-forty yards, the English opened their fire, and the destruction became immense.
The French fought bravely, but their ranks became disordered, and, notwithstanding the repeated effirts of their offi.
cers to form them, and to renew the attack, they were so successfully pushed by the British bayonet, and hewn down by
the higbland broadsword, that their discomfiture was complete.
During the action, Montcalm was on the French left, and
Wolfe on the Englishl right, and here they both fell in the critical moment that decided the victory. Earlv in the battle,
Wolfe received a. ball in his wrist, but binding his handkerchief around it, he continued to encourage his men. Shortly
after, another ball penetrated his groin; but this wound
although much more severe, he concealed, and continued to
urge on the contest, till a third bullet pierced his breast. He
Was now obliged, though reluctantly, to be carried to the rear
of the line.
Gen. Moncton succeeded to the command, but was immediately wounded, and conveyed away. In this critical state of
the action, the conmmand devolvred on Gen. Townshend. Gen.
Mlontcalm, fighting in front of his battalion, received a mortal
wound about the snme time, and Gen. Jennezergus   his
Second in command, fell near his side.Wolfe died in the field, before the battle was ended; but he
lived long enough to kniow that the victory was his.-While
leaning on the shoulder of a lieutenant, who kneeled to support him, he was seized with the agonies of death: at this mo.
ment was heard the distant sound, "They fly"-" they fly."
The hero raised his drooping head, and eagerly asked, "Who
fly?1) Being told that it was the French-". Then," he replied,
" I die happy," and expired.!
"This death," says professor Silliman, "has furnished a
grand and pathetic subject for the painter, the poet, and the
historian, and undoubtedly, considered as a specimen of mere
military glory, it is one of the most sublime that the annals o6'
war afford."1
Montcalmrn was eN ery way worthy of heing the competitor
of Wolfe. In talents-in military skill-in personal courage,
he was not his inferiour. Nor was his death much less slbr
lime. Hle lived to be carried to the city, where his last moments were emiployed in writing, wvith his own hand, a letter
tothe English general, recomrmending the French prisoters
to his care and humanity. When informed that his wound was
mortal, he replied, "I shall not then live to see the surrender
of Quebec."
XXIV. The capture of Quebec, which soon followed,
important as it was, did not immediately terminate the
war.  The French in Canada had still a powerful army,
and some naval force above the city.
XXV. In the ensuing spring, 1760, Monsieur Levi
approached Quebec tiom M1ontreal, assisted by six frigates, for thie purpose of recovering it tfromn the English.
Gen. AlMrray, who commanded the English garrison,
marched out to nmeet him, with only three thousand men,
and ont the 28th of April, after a bloody battle fought at
Sillsery, three miles above the city, the English army was
defeated, with the loss of one thousand men, the French
having lost more than. double that number.
The English retreated to Quebec, to which the French
now laid siege. About the mniddle of May, an English
squadron arrived with reinfoircements soon alter whichs
the French fleet was taken and destroyed, and the siege
was raised.
XXVI. The attention of the English command'r in
chief, Gen. Amherst, was now directed to the re.i.rctiou:10
113114              PERIOD IV....1756....1775.
of Montreal, the last fortress of consequence in the pose
session of the French. To effect this he detached Col.
Haviland, with a well disciplined army, to proceed to
Lake George, Crown Point, and Lake Champlain; Gen
1Murray was ordered from  Quebec, with suchl forces as
could be spared from the garrison, while General Amherst himself proceeded with ten thousand men, by Lake
Ontario down the river St. L,awrence.
Generals Amherst and Murray arrived at Montreal the
same day, Sept. 6th, and were joined by iHaviland, on the
day succeeding. While preparing to lay siege to the
place, the commander of Montreal, M. de Vaudrenil, per~
cieving that resistance would be ineffectual, demanded a
capitulation. On the 8thb, Montreal, Detroit, Michili.
mackinac, anl fall the other places wvithin the government
of Canada, were surrendered to his Britannick Majesty.
XXVII. Thus ended a war which, from the first hos.
tilities, had continued six years, and during which muci
distress hliad been experienced, and many thousand valiua
ble lives lost. Great and universal was the joy that
spread through the colonies, at the successful termination
of a contest, so long and severe,.and publick thanksgivings
were generally appointed to ascribe due honour to HIM
who had preserved to the colonies their existence and li
berties.
XXVIII. While the troops were employed in the
onquest of Canada, the colonies of Virginia and South
"arolina suffered invasion and outrage from the Cherokees, a powerful tribe of savages on the West. But in
176i, they were signally defeated by Col. Grant, and
compelled to sue for peace.
Intelligence being communicated to Gen. Amherst of the
danger of these colonies, he, despatched Gen. Montgomery
with one thousand two hundred men, for their protection and
relief.
Being joined by the forces of the province of Carolina on Ihis
arrival, he immediatelv proceeded into the country of the Cherokees, plundering andl destroying their villages and magazines.0,corn. In revenge, the savages besieged Fort London, onthe confines of Virginia, which was obliged, by reason of famine, to capitulate. The capitulation was, however, broken,
and the troops, while on their march to Virginia, were assaulted-ntinumbers of them killed, and the rest taken.captive.
The next year, 1761, Gen. Montgomery being obliged to return, Col. Grant was sent to continue the war. With an army
of near two thousand six hundred men, he began his march
towards the enemies' country.  On the' foi- rth day the army
fell in with a body of savages, and after a strongly contested
battle, put them to flight. Following up this victory, Col. Grant
proceeded to destroy their magazines, burn their corn fields,
and consume their settlements, until hav.ang effectually routed
them, he returned with his troops. Soon after this, the Cherokee chiefs came in, and a peace was concluded.
XXIX. The conquest of Canada having been achiev
ed in 1763, a definitive treaty, the preliminaries of which
had been settled the year before, was signed at Paris, and
soon after ratified by the kings of Enrigland and France;
by which all Nova-Scotia, Canada, the Isle of Cape Breton, anid all other islands in the gulf and river St. Lawcence, were ceded to the British crown.

XXX.                   jo$t  tjt    3 f            The,hange in respect to manners in the colonies, during this
p1eriod, consisted chiefly in a gradual wearing away of national distinctions and peculiarities, and a tendency to a
still greater unity and assimilation of character. The rapid increase of wealth,, and the frequency of intercourse
with Europe, began to introduce among the colonies the
tastes, and fashions, and luxuries of European countries.
But the introduction of them produced little enervation of
character among the people of Amierica.  Such an effect
was counteracted by the bloody, but successful war with
the French and Indians, and the boundless prosperity
which seemed to open to the country, and call forth its
energies. Instead, therefore of a growing weakness in
the colonies, we perceive a more vigorous spirit of corn
115mnercial enterprise, pervading thle country: a consciosa
ness of political imnportance becoming confirmed; anct a
deep and ardent love of civil liberty - breathing over the
land.
XXXI. liti{ginmA. Tlhe only religious sect introduced into Anmerica, during this period, was that of the
Shakers, or Shakinig Quakers, who arrived froin England in 1774, and settled at Niskayuna, near Albany.
Althoiugh the spirit of religious intolerance had disappeared
from the colonies, and the puritanical severity of the north had
become much softened, yet until the commencement of the
French and Indian war, tile religious character of the colonies
had remained essentially the same. But during this war, izfi-.
dlelity was extensively introduced into the army, by means of
the tbreign English officers and soldiers who wvere sent into the
country. From the alrmy, it spread itself into society, and produced a considerable relaxation of morals, arrd a looser adherence to principles.
XXXII.        a'tt e anJ CoIW ne,rC.During this
period, trade a(nd comm3erce imade great advances; the
anniual amount of imports fronm Great Britailn, was about,
two and a hall' millioils of pounds sterling, frorm L756 to
1771: from 1771 to 1773, it- was three millions and a -
lalf annually, on an average.-The annual amnount of exports of the colonies to Great Britain anid elseVwhere, was
about four million pounds sterling, at the close of this period(. The articles of export, and the nature of the tract;
of tiie colonies, were essentially the samie as statedc in tlhe
notes to period third.
In 1769, thle number of ships employed by Great Britain and
the colonies, in the trade with the colonies, was one thiousand
seventy-eighlt, manned by twenty-eight tnousand nine hundred
and ten seamen.
The whale and other fisheries in the colonies had become of
great imnportance. In 1775, there were--employed in the fishery generally, and in carrying the fish to market fromn NewEngland, ohe thousand four hundred and fifty vessels of all descriptiops, of one hundred thousand tons burthen, and eleven
thousand fishermen and seamen.

mnanufactures in the'dolonies, and, therefore, there was
but a moderate advance of these interests during this
period.
XXXV.       3   0~ tfor.  At the close of this period,
the white and black population of the colonies did no
vary greatly from thIee millions.
XXXVI. _E-UttCffto1,. In the year 1769, the college at Hanover, New- Hampshire, was founded, and
called Dartmouth College, in honour of the earl of Dartmouth, who was one of its principal benefactors.
In 1770, the University in Rhode-Island called Brown
University, was established at Providence. It was incorporated in 1764, and first located at Warren. At this
place the first commencement was held, 1769.
XXXVII. The preceding short period of our history pre,.
sents several interesting subjects of reflection. The AmeriP
can colonies became the theatre of a bloody conflict, attended
by all the appalling features of savage war. Although feebly supported by England, and embarrassed by the want of
political union, they surmounted every obstacle, and compelled the French, their enemiies, to depart from their shores
for ever.
But no sooner was this conflict ended, than they began to
feel, with added weight, the hand of British oppression.-Not
humbled, however, by injustice, nor crushed by severities,
they vigorously put forth their strength in commerce, trade
and agriculture.  They spread innumerable sails upon the
ocean; they converted forests into meadows and wheat fields;
established seminaries of learning; founded cities; and built
churches to God.
Nay, more-we see that those very steps, which were taken
by the mother country to cripple the American colonies, were
so ordered as to add their strength. By leaving them to bear
the war of 1756 almost alone, she showed them that they could
not expect defence from her; she taught them the necessity of
relying upon their own energies; gave them an opportanity to
learn the art of war, and to ascertain their own strength.
The long line of British acts, designed to crush the colonies,

DISTINGUISHED FOR THE. WAR OF THE REVOLUTION.
Battle of Lexington.
Extending from the comnmencement of hostilities by
Great Britain against thle American colonies, in the
battle of Lexington, 1775, to the disbanding of the
Amierican Army at West Point, 1783.
Section I. On the 19th of April, 1775 was shed at
Lexington, Massachusetts the first blood in the war of
the revolat.;n--a war, which terminated in the separationof the American colonies from Great Britain, and in their
change from this humble chlaracter and condition, to that
of free and independent States.
I1. The causes, which led the colonies to take up
arms against the mother country, deserves a distinct recital in this portion of our history, as they will clearly show
the justice, wisdom, and necessity of those acts of resistance, to which, at that trying period, resort was had.
The independence of A   merica," it has been observed,
was found by those who sought it not."  When the Fathers of this country left Great Britain, they had no intention of establishing a governlnent independent of that
of England. On the contrary, they came out as colo.
nists, and expected still to acknowledge allegiance to tlhe
mother country. For many years, when they spoke, or
wrote, or thought of Englalnd, it was under the filial and
affectioniate idea of  hofne.'"  " And even at the commencement of the controversy with Great Britain," if we
credit those who lived at that time, "' there existed no desire, nor intention of becoming independent.."
Testimony with respect to the filial disposition of the colonies towards the mother country abounds.  " I profess," said
Pownal, who had been governour and commander in chief of
Massachusetts Bay-governour of South Carolina, &amp;c. &amp;c.
"I profess," said he, in 1765, "an affection for the colonies,
because, having lived among their people in a private as well
as public character, I know them-I know that in their pri~
vate, social relations, there is not a more friendly, and in thieir
political one, a more zealously loyal people in all his majesty'g
dominions. They would sacrifice their dearest interest for the
honour of their mother country.  I have a right to say this,
because experience has given me a practical knowledge and
this impression of thein.-They have no other idea of this
counitry' than as their' hoime; they have no other word by which
to'express it, anid till of late, it has been constantly expressed
by the name of home."  
The testimonry of Dr. Franklin is to the same effect.'" Scotland," said he, in 1768, " has had its rebellions; Ireland has
had its rebellions; England its plots against the reigning family;
but.lmerica is free from this.eproach;"-"- No people wero
ever known more truly loyal: the protestant succession in the
house of Hanover was their idol."        PERIOD... 1775....17S3....REVOLUTION~  2
For these feelings of affection for the mother country,
the colonies deserve the highest encomium. Causes existed which might have justified a less degree of attachment,
and were calculated to produce it. These were the oppression and losses which they endured; the shackles imposed upon them; the restraints upon their commerce;
the parsimony with which aid was administered by the
mother country; the maleadministration-the peculation
and arbitrary conduct of the royal governours-these
things were sufficient, and more thai' sufficient, to stifle
every feeling of affection, and shake the last remains of
their allegiance.'
Yet, through all this oppressive subordination-through
the calamities of war-through the attemnpt to wrest from
them their charters, and their dearest rights-they could
aay, and did say, "England, with all thy faults, I love
thee still."
Nor is it probable that these friendly dispositions of the
colonies would at this time have been wvithdrawn, had not
Great Britain interrupted them by a grievous change of
policy towards the inhabitants touching the subject of revenue and taxation.
Before the peace of'63, this subject had been wisely let
alone. The colonies had been permitted to tax themselves,
without the interference of the parliament. Till this pe,'iod, it had sufficed for the mother country so to control
their commerce, as to monopolize its benefits to herself.
But from and after this period, the ancient system was set
aside, and a different and oppressive policy adopted.
The first act, the avowed purpose of which vwas a reve.
nue from the colonies, passed the parliament, Sept. 29th,
1764 the preamble to which began thus:-  Whereas it
is just and necessary that a revenue be raised in America,
for defraying the expenses of defending, protecting, and
securing the same, we the commons, &amp;c."  The act then
proceeds to lay a duty on "4 clayed sugar, indigo, coffee
&amp;c. &amp;c. being the produce of a colony not under the do
minion of his majesty."
1:1This act the colonies could not approve. They could
not approve of it, because it recognized the existence. of
a right to tax them-a right not founded in justice, and
which since their existence, nearly one hundred and fifty
years, until now, had seldom been named. But the colo
nies could submit to it, although unpleasant and unjuist,
nor would this act alone have led to permanent disaffection,
had it not been followed by other acts, still more unjust and
oppressive.
On the subject of the right of the British parliament to tax
the colonies, it was asserted in the mother country "to be essential to the unity, and of course to the prosperity, of the em
pire, that the British parliament should have a right of taxation over every part of the royal dominions." In the colonies
it was contended " that taxatiom and representation were insepa.
rable, and that they could not be safe, if their property might
be taken from them, without their consent." This claim of
the right of taxation on the one side, and the denial of it on the
other, was the very hinge on which the revolution tturned.
In accordance with the policy to be observed towards
America, the next year, 1765, the famous stamp acc
passed both houses of parliament.  This ordained that inr
struments of writing, such as deeds, bonds, notes, &amp;c;
among the colonies, should be null and void, unless executed on stamnzped paper, for which a duty should be paid,
to the crown.
When this bill was brought in, the ministers, and particulari
ly Charles Townshend, exclaimed:
"These Americans, our own children, planted by our care
nourished by our indulgence, protected by our arms, until they
are grown to a good degree of strength and opulence; will they
now turn their backs upon us, and grudge to contribute their
mnite to relieve us fromn the heavy load which overwhelms us?"
Col. Barre caught the words, and, with a vehemence becoming a sdldier, rose and said:
" Planted by your care! No! your oppression planted them
in America; they fled from your tyranny into a then uncultivated land, where they were exposed to almost all the hardships to which human nature is liable, and among others, to the
savage cruelty of the enemy of the country, a people, the
most subtle, and, I take upon nie to say, the most truly terrible
of any people that ever inhabited any part of God's earth; and
yet actuated by principles of true English liberty, they mt. allthese hardships with pleasure, compared with those they suffered in their own country, from the hands of those that should
have been their friends.
They nourished by your indulgence! They grew by your
neglect; as soon as you began to care about them, that care
was exercised in sending persons to rule over them, in one department and another, who were, perhaps, the deputies of the
deputies of some members of this house, sent to spy out their
liberty, to misrepresent their actions, and to prey upon them:
men, whose behaviour, on many occasions, had caused the
blood of these sons of liberty to recoil within them: men, promoted to the hi'ghest seats of justice, some of whom, to my
knowledge, were glad, by going to foreign countries, to escape
the vengeance of the laws of their own.
" They protected by your arms l They have nobly taken up
arms in your defence, have exerted their valour amidst their
constant and laborious industry, for the defence of a country
whose frontiers, while drenched in blood, its interior parts have
yielded for your enlargement the little savings of their frugality
and the fruits of their toils. And believe me, remember, I this day
told you so, that -the same spirit which actuated that people at
first, will c0ntinue with them still."
The night after this act passed, Doctor Franklilin, who was
then in London, wrote to Charles Thompson, afterwards secretary of the Continental Congress, "' The sun of liberty is set;
the.Jmericans must light the lamps of industry and, economy." To
which Mr. Thompson answered: "Be assured we shall light
torches of quite another sort"-thus predicting the convulsions
which were about: to follow.
II. On the arrival of the news of the stamp act in
America, a general indignation spread through the country,
and resolutions were passed against the act, by most of the
colonial assemblies.
In these resolutions, Virginia led the way. On the meeting
of the house of burgesses, Patrick Henry presented, among
others, the following resolutions, which were substantially
adopted.
Resolved, That his majesty?s liege people of this his ancient
colony, have enjoyed the rights of being thus governed by their
own assembly, in the article of taxes, and internal police, and
that the same have never oeen forfeited or yielded up, but have
been constantly recognized by the king and people of Britain.
Resolved, thlerefore, That the general assembly of this' colony, together with his majesty, or his substitutes, have, in their
representative capacity, the only exclusive right and power to
$2lay taxes and imposts upon the inhabitants of this colony; and
that every attempt to vest such powier in any other person, or
person:, whatsoever, than the general assembly aforesaid, is ille
gal, unconstitutionral, and unrjust, and hath a manifest tendency
to destroy British as well as A1merican liberty.
Resolved, That his majesty's liege people, the inhabitants of
this colony, are not bounld to yield obedience to any law or ordinance wvhatever, designed to impose any taxation whatever
upon them, other than the laws or ordinances of the general
assembly aforesaid.
Resolved, That any person who shall, by speaking or writing,
assert or maintain that any person, or persons, other than the
general assembly of this colony, have any right or power to impose or lay any tax on the people here, shall be deemed an enemy to this his majesty's colony.
Copies of these resolutions were immediately forwarded to
the other provinces, and served to raise still higher the general
feeling of opposition to the conduct of the mother country.
IV. In June, Massachusetts recommended a colonial
congress to consult for the general safety.  The recommendation was well received by most of the colonries, and
in October, twenty-eight memnbers assembled in New-York,
where they remonstrated against the stamp act, and petitioned its repeal.  Atthe same time, also, they drew up
a bill of rights, in which taxation and representation were
declared to be inseparable.
V. The stamp act came into operation on the first of
Novemnber. In Boston: and in Portsmouth, the day was
ushered in by a funeral tolling of bells. In the latter
place, in the course of the day, a coffin neatly ornamented,
and inscribed with the word Liberty, in large letters, was
carried to the grave. Minute guns were fired during the
mnovement of the procession to the place of interment;
where an oration was offered in favour of the deceased.
Similar expressions of wounded and indignant feeling occurred in various parts of the country.
In some places, the stamap officers were obliged to resign,
or to secrete themselves, to escape the vengeance of the
people. Stamps were not permnitted to be landed, and business, in many places, was conducted without them. At
the same timne, associations were formed in all parts of thePERIOD....1775....17833....REVOLUTION.  12~5
country, by merchants:- not to import goods until this odious act was repealed. Most cheerfully did the people,
women as well as men, enter upon this self-denial.
Luxuries, decorations, elegancies, were universally laid
aside.
The opposition to the stamp act in America was so spirited, so deep laid, so universal, that parliament had only
the alternative, to compel her to submit, or to repeal it.
After a long and angry debate on the quesion, the repeal
was carried; but accompanying the repealing act, was
one called the declaratory act, more hostfle to the American
rights than any which had preceded.- The language ol
the act was,'that parliament have, and of right ought to
iavey power to bind the colonies in all cases whatsoever2.
On the 22d of February, General Conway introduced a motion into parliament to'repeal the starnip act. The debate
lasted until three o'clock in the morning, and never was there
a debate which excited more warmth of interest, or more vehemence of opposition. The lobies of the house were crowded
with manufacturers and traders of the kingdom, whose anxious
countenances plainly showed that their fates hung upon the
issue. A division at length beingcalled for, two hundred and
seventy-five rose in support of the motion, and one hundred
and'sixty-seven against it.
The satisfaction of the colonies on the repeal of the
stamp act was sincere aiud universal.  Elevated with the
idea of having remioved an odious and oppressive buyden,
and believing, notwithstanding the declaratory act of parliament, that the right of taxing the colonies was at length
surrendered, better feelings were indulged; -commercial intercourse was revived, and larger importations of goods
were made than ever.
VI. The colonies, however, mistook the spirit and determination of the ministry.  For, in 1767, a bill passed
thie patrliament, imposing a duty to be collected in the colonies on glass, paper, painter's colours, and tea.
This act, With several others, not less arbitrary and unjust, again spread alarm through the colonies, and revived the fire of opposition which had been smothered by the
repeal of the stamp act. Again were associations formed
1;L126      PERIOD V....1775...1783....REvOLUTION.
to prevent the imnportation of British goods; again were
meetings called to resolve, petition, and remonstrate.
VII. In Feb. 1T69, both houses of parliament went a
step beyond all that had preceded in an address to the
king) requesting him to give orders to the governour of
Massachusetts-the spirited conducet of which province
was particularly obnoxious to the ministry- to take notice
of such as might be guilty of treason, that they might be
sent to England and tried there.
A measure more odious to the people of America, or
more hostile to the British constitution, could not be named, than for a man to be torn from his country, to be tried by a jury of strangers.
The house of burgesses of Virginia met soon after the oflib
cial accounts of this address were received, and, in a few days,
passed several spirited resolutions, expressing "their exclusive right to tax their constituents, and denying the right of
his majesty to remove an offender out of the country for trial."
The next day, the royal governour of that colony sent for the
house of burgesses and addressed them laconically as follows:
"' Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen of the house of burgesses, I
have heard of your resolves, and augur ill of their effects. You
have made it my duty to dissolve you and vou are accordingly
dissolved!" The assembly of North Carolina passed similar
resolutions, and were dissolved by their governour, in a similar
manner.
VIII. While affairs were thus situated, an event occur.
red which produced great excitement in America, particularly in Massachusetts.  This was an affray on the evening
of the fifth of March, 1770, between some of the citizens of
Boston and a number of his majesty's soldiers, who had
been sent from Halifax  and were now stationed at the
custom house. Several of the inhabitants were killed.
and others severely wounded.
The quarrel commenced on the 2d of March, at Gray's rope
walk, between a soldier and a man employed at the rope walk.
The provocation was given by the citizen, and a scuffle ensuied, in which the soldier was beaten. On the 5th of the month,
the soldiers, while under arms, were pressed upon and insulted,
and dared to fire. One of them who had received a blow,
fired at the aggressor, and a singe discharge from six 6thert
succeededo Three of the citizens were killed, and five danPERIO1D, V....r775...1783... REVOLUTION.  12T
gerously mwounded. The town was instantly thrown into the
greatest commotion, the bells were rung, andl the general cry
was " to arms."
In a short time several thousands of the citizens had assem
bled, and a dreadful scene of blood must have ensued, but for
the promise of Governour HIutchinsor, that the affair should
e settled to ther satisfaction in the morning. Captain Presbe sette to.. tPei saif"a Mnttdwt hnit
ton, who commanded the soldiers, was committed with them to
prison. Upon their trial, the captain and six soldiers were acquitted; two were convicted of manslaugrhter.' For several
subsequent years, thd evening of the day on which this outrage
was committed, was commemorated by the citizens of Boston,
and the event gave occasion to addresses the nmost warmn and
oatriotick, whllich served to waklen up, and increase the spirit,of the revolution.
IX. 1773. The recommendations of mrneetiigs and associations to suspend the importation of tea, had been so
strictly complied with, that but little had been brought into
the country. rThe consequence was that vast quantities,
teventeen millions of pounds, had accumnulated upon the
hiands of the East India Company.-For their relief, the
parliament now authorized them to export this tea into any
part of the world, free of duty. By this regulation tea
would come cheaper to the colonies than before it had
been made a source of revenue-parliainent having, in
3167, reduced the duty on it to three pence a p-)und.
Confident of niow finding a market tbr their tea in America the East India Company freighted several shiips with
that article for the different colonies, and appointed agents
to dispose of it. On thile arrival of this tea, however, the
determination of the colonists was formed-they would
iot pay even three pence by way of duty. The consequence was, that cargoes of tea sent to New-York anc
Philadelphia, were returned without being enrtered at the
custoni house; and those sent to Charleston S. C. were
~stored but not offered for sale.
In Massachusetts, a different fate awaited it. Upon its
arrival, the inhabitants endeavoured to procure its return,
ut this being impracticable, the tea having beenconsigned to the relations and friends of the royal governour,
Ilutchinsont they resolved to destroy it. Accordingly, a        PER2IOD i....1L492.... 1607.... DISCOUERIES.  iiL
mouth, England, discovered and gave name to Cape
Cod.
Gosnold, being bound to Virginia, his discovery was accidental. He named Cape Cod, in reference to the abundance
of Codfish about it. Coastinrg south, he discovered Nantucket,
Buzzard's Bay, Martha's Vineyard, and one of the Elizabeth
Islands.
Other expeditions were fitted out and camne to America for
discovery; we have however noticed above the leading adventurers and their discoveries during this period.
VI. As we are now about to enter upon a period whichl
will exhibit our ancestors as inhabitants of this new world,
it will be interesting to know what was its aspect when
they first set their feet upon its shlores.
Statr of tt{j (,UtO*lt,.-O0n the arrival of thie first
settlers, North America was almnost one unbroken wilderness. From the recesses of thse forests were heard the
panther, the catamou.t tthe bear,. the wildcat thle wolf,
and other beasts of prey. From the thickets rushed the
buffalo, the elk, the moose, and the carrabo; and scattered
on the mountains and plains, were seen the stag and fal)w deer.   Numerous flocks of the feathered tribe enlix ened the air, and multitudes of fish filled the rivers, or
eided along the slhores.
The spontaneous productions of the soil, also, were
f und to be various a.nd abundant.  In all parts of the
land grew grapes, which historians have likened to the
ancient grapes of Eshcol. In the south, were found mulberries plums, relons, cucumnbers, tobacco, corn, peas,
beans, potatoes, squashes, pomplons, &amp;c. Acorns, walnuts, chesnmts, wild cherries, currents, strawberries,
whortleberries in the season of them, grew wild in every
(uarte.;`'f the country.
~II:;5,(~[,1fi~g,~,---The country was inhabited by

number of persons, dressed like Indians, repaired to the
ships, and discharged three hundred and forty-two chests
of tea into the water, without, however, doing any other
damage.
X. Intelligence of these proceedings was, on the 7th of
March, 1774, comimunicated in a message from the throne
to both houses of Parliament., The excitement was p,
culiarly strong. In the spirit of revenge against Massachusetts, and particularly against Boston, which was considered as the chief seat of rebellion, a bill was brought
forward, called the "~Boston port bill," by which the
port of Boston was precluded from the privilege of landing and discharging, or of loading and shipping goods.
wares, and merchandise.
A second bill, which passed at this time, essentialiy al.
tered the charter of the province, mraking the appointment
bf the council, justices, jndges, &amp;c. dependent upon the
crown, or its agent. A third soon followed, authorizing
and directing the governour to send any person indicted
for murder, or any other capital offence, to another cor
lony, or to Great Britain for trial.
XI. Oil the arrival of these acts, the town of Boston
passed the following vote: " That it is the opinion of this
town, that, if the other colonies come into a joint resolu.
tioon to stop all importation from Great Britain and the
West Indies, till the act for blocking up this harbour be
repealed, the same will prove the salvation of. America
and her liberties."  Copies of this vote were transmitted
to each of the colonies.
As an expression of their sympathy with the people o'
Boston in their distress, the house of burgesses in Virginia
ordered that the day, on which the Boston port bill was
to take effect, should be observed as a day of fasting and
prayer.
The words Whigs and Tories were, about this time, introdu
ced as the distinguishing names of parties. By the former,
was meant those who favoured the cause of Boston, and were
zealous in supporting the colonies against the parliament; by
te latter, was m eant the faou.rers of Oreat B13itn        PERIOD V....1775....1783....REVOLUTION.  129
XII.   During these transactions in Massachusetts,
measures had been taken to convene a Continental Congress. On the 4th of Sept. 1774, deputies from eleven
colonies met at Philadelphia, and elected Peyton Randolph, the then late speaker of the Virginia Assembly,
president, and Charles Thompson, secretary. After considerable debate, it was agreed that each colony should
have one equal vote.'
Having settled the manner of voting, the congress proceeded to the discharge of the high trust committed to
them. They agreed upon a declaration of their rights,
recommended the non-importation of British goods into
the country, and the non-exportation of American produce to Great Britain, so long as their grievances were
unredressed-voted an address to his Majesty--and likewise one to the people of Great Britain, and another to
the French inhabitants of Canada.
This congress, havingfinished their business in less
than eight weeks, dissolved themselves, after recommending another congress to be convenied on the 10th of May
ensuing, unless the redress of their grievances should be
previously obtained.
Although the power of this congress was only advisory,
their resolutions were approved, not only by the people,
but also by the authorities, whether established, or provincial, and exerted a commanding influence in consummating that union among the colonies,which had been
increasing with their grievances.
The name by which the above congress is generally known
is tlw Continental Congress." It consisted of fifty-five members, one half of whom were lawyers. After the arrival ot the
delegates from North Carolina, twelve colonies were represented.
XIIL   An assembly was ordered by Gov, Gage, of
Massachusetts, to convene Oct. 5th; but before that period arrived, judging their meeting inexpedient, he counteracted the writs of convocation, by a proclamation.
The assembly, however, to the number of in- ty, met at
Salem, where the governor not attending, they adjournedto Concord. Here they chose John Hancock president,
and, after adjourning to Cambridge, drew up a plan for
the immediate defence of the province, by enlisting men,
appointing general officers, &amp;c.
In November, this provincial congress met again, and resolved to get in readiness twelve thousand men, to act in any
emergency; and that one-fourth part of the militia should be
enlisted as minute-men. At the same time, a request was forwarded to Connecticut, New-Hampshlre, and Rhode-Island,
jointly to increase this army to twenty thousand men.
XIV. Early the next year, Jan. 7thl, 1775,Lord
Chatham, Mr. Pitt, after a long retirement, resumed his
seat in the house of Lords, and introduced a conciliatory
bill, the object of which was, to settle the troubles in
America. But the efforts of this venerable and peacemaking man wholly failed, the bill being rejected by a majority of sixty-four to thirty-two, without even the comn
pliment of lying on the table.
The rejection of this bill was, followed the next day by the
introduction of a bill, which finally passed, to' restrain the
trade of the New-England provinces, and to forbid their fishing on the banks of Newfoundland. Soon after, restrictions
were imposed upon the middle and southern colonies, with the.
exception of New-York, Delaware, and North Carolina. This
bill, designed to promote disunion amohg the colonies, happily
fhiled of its object.
Thus we hlave given a succinct account of the system
of measures adopted by the ministry of England toward
the American colonies aftei the peace of'63-measures.
most unfeeling and unjust; but which no petitions, however respectful, and no remonstrances, however loud&gt;
could change. Satisfied: of this, justice permitted the.
people, and self-respect and self-preservation loudly summoned them, to resist by force.
XV. The crisis, therefore, had now arrived, the signal of war was given, and the blood shed at Lexington
opened the scene.
Gen. Gage, the king's governour of Massachusetts,
learning that a large quantity of military stores had been
deposited by the provincials, at Concord, detached Lieuto
Col. Smith, anid Major Pitcairn, with eight hundredgrenadiers, to destroy them. On their arrival at Lexington,
on the morning of the 19th of April, 1775, seventy of
the militia, who had hastily assembled upon an alarm,
were under arms, on the parade.   Eight of these were
without provocation killed, and several wounded.
The greatest precaution was taken by Governour Gage, to
prevent the intelligence of this expedition from reaching the
country. Officers were dispersed along the road to intercept
expresses, who might be sent from Boston. But the precaution proved ineffectual. The alarm was given, and was rapidly spread, by means of church bells, guns, and volleys.
The slaughter of the militia at Lexington was extremely
wanton. Major Pitcairn, on seeing them on the parade, rode
up to them, and, with a loud voice, cried out, "disperse, disperse, you rebels; throw down your arms and disperse." The
sturdy yeomanry not immediately obeying his orders, he approached nearer, discharged his pistol, and ordered his soldiers
to fire.
From Lexington, the detachment proceeded td Concord,
and destroyed the stores. After killingr several of the militia,
who came out to oppose them, they retreated to Lexington
with some loss, the Americans firing upon them from behind
walls, hedges, and buildings.
Fortunately for the British, here Lord Percy met them, with
a reinforcement of nine hundred men, some marines, and two
field-pieces. Still annoyed by the provincials, they continued
their retreat to Bunker's Hill, in Charlestown, and the day following crossed over to Boston. The British lost, in killed and
wounded, during their absence, two hundred and seventythree. The loss of the Ainericans amounted to eighty-eiglit,
killed, wounded, and missing.
XVI. Such was the affair at Lexington, the first action
that opened the war of the revolution.  The issue of it
filled the Enlglish officers Nwith indignation; they could
not endure that an undisciplined multitude, that "a flock
of Yankees," as they contemptuously named the Americans, should have forced them to turn their backs.. On
the contrary, the result of the day immeasurably increased the courage of the Americans.  The tidings spread;
the voice of war rung through the land, and preparations
were every where commenced to carry it forward.
The provincial Congress of Massachusetts, being in
session at this time despatched a minute account of the
1h   I32    PERIOD V....1I775....1783....REVOLUTION.o
affair at Lexington, to Great Britain, with depositions to
prove that the British troops were the aggressors. Iv
conclusion, they used this emphatic language; " Appealing to Heaven for the justice of our cause we determine
to die, or befreeo"
The congress, at the same time, resolved that a levy
should be made in the province of thirteen thousand six
hundred mern   This force being raised, was soon after
joined by troops from New-Hampshire, Connecticut, and
Rhode-Island, and an armny of thirty thousand men assembled in the environs of Boston.
XVII. As the war had now begun, and was likely to
proceed, it was deemed important to secure the fortresses
of Ticonderoga and Crown Point.  Accordingly, a numhler of volunteers from Connecticut and Vermont, under,
command of Col. Ethan Allen, and Col. Benedict Arnold)
miarched against Ticonderoga, and, on the 10th of May,
took it by surprise, the garrison being asleep. The fortress of Crown Pointt surrendered shortly after.o
On the arrival of Allen at Ticonderoga, he demanded the
fort. "' By what authority?" asked the commander. "I demand it," said Allen, "C in the name of the Great Jehovah, and:
of the Continental Congress."1 The suLmmons was instantlyobeyed, and the fort was, with its valuable stores, surrenderedo.
XTI Io The taking of Ticonderoga and Crown Point
was soon followed by the memorable Battle of Bunker'
HIill, as it is usually called, or of Breed's Hill, a high emiience in Charlestown, withlin cannon-shot of Boston,
where the battle was actually fouLght, June 17th.
The evening preceding, a detachment of one thousand Americans were ordered to make an entrenchment on Bunker's
Ilill; but by some mistake, they proceeded to Breed's Hill, and
by the dawn of day, had thrown up a redoubt eight rods square,
and four feet higho
On discovering this redoubt in the morning, the British comnence:&amp; a severe cannonade upon' it, from several ships ane
floating batteries, and from a fortification on Copp's Hill, W
Boston, whlich was continued iuntil afternoon. The Americamn
nowever, tever intermitted their work for a moment, and du
ing the forenoon, lost but a single man.
Between twelve and one o'clock, three thousad WBrtisi Y        PERIOD V..,.1775....1783...B E~  O L UT  I O33
der command of Major General Howe, and Brigadier Gen.
Pigot, crossed Charles river, with ain intention to dislodge the
Americans.
As they advanced, the British commencea firing at some
distance from the redoubt; but thle Americans reserved their
fire, until the enemy were wvithin twelve rods.  They then
opened, and the carnage was terrible. The British retreated
in precipitafe confusion.  They were, however, rallied by
tieir officers, being, in some instances, pushed on by their
swords, and were again led to the attack. The Americans
now suffered them to approach within six rods, when their fire
nmowed them down in heaps, and again they fled.
Unfortunately for the Americans, their ammunition here failed; and, on the third charge of the British, they were obligedl to retire, after having obstinately resisted even longer than
pradence admitted. The British lost in this engagement two
hundred and twenty-six killed, among whom was Major Pitcairn, who first lighted the torch of war at Lexington, and eight
hundred and twenty -eigoht wounded. The Americans lost one
hundred and thirty-nine killed, and of wounded and missing
there were three hundred and fourteen. Among the killed
was the lamented Gen. Warren.
The horrours of this scene were greatly increased by the conflagration of Chariestown, effected, during the heat of the battle, by the orders of Gen. Gage. By this wanton act of barbarity, two thousand people were deprived of their habitations,
and property to the amount of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds sterling perished in the flames.
" Wanton, however, as the burning of Charlestown was, it
wonderfully enhanced the dreadful mnagnificence of the day.
To the volleys of musketry and the roar of cannon; to the
shouts of the fighting and the groans of the dvying; to the dark
and a.wful atmosphere of smoke, enveloping the whole peninsula, and illumined in every quarter by the streams of fire firom
the various instruments of death; the conflagration of six hundred buildings, added a gloomy and amazing grandeur.  In
the midst of this wavingr lake of flame, the lofty steeple, converted into a blazing pyramid, towered and trembled over the
vast pyre, and finished the scene of desolation."
To the Americans, the consequences of this battle were those
of a decided victory. They learned that their enemies were
not invulnerable. At the same time, they learned the importance of stricter discipline, and greater preparations. As the
result of the battle spread, the national pulse beat still higher,
and the arm of opposition was braced still more firmly.
XIX. The second continental congress met at Philadelphia. on the 10th of May. As military opposition
12}to Great Britain was now resolved upon by the colonies,
and had actually commenced, it became necessary to fix
upon a proper person to conduct that opposition. The
person unanimously selected by congress was George
Washington, a member of their body, from Virginia.
General Washington, in his reply to the President of Con
gress, who announced to him his appointment, after consenting
to enter upon the momentous duty assigned him, added; " But
lest some unlucky event shouild happen unfavourable to my reputation, I beg it may be remembered, by every- genitleman in
the room, that I this day declare with the utmost sincerity,
I do not think myself equal to the command I am honoured
witli.
"As to pay, sir, I beg leave to assure the congress, that as
no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept
this arduous employment, at the expense of my domestic ease
and happiness, I do not wish to maklie any profit from it. 1
will keep an exact account of namy expenses. Those I doubt
not they will discharge, and that is all I desire."*   
A special commission was drawn up and.presented to him,
as commander in chief of the American forces; on presenting
it, congress unanimoasly adopted this resolution: "that they
would mnaintain and assist him, and adhiere to him with their
lives and fortunes in the cause of American lihberty."
Following the appointment of General Washington, was the
appointment of four Major-Generals, Artemas Ward, Charles
Lee, Philip Schuyler, and Israel Putnam; and eight BrigadierGenerals, Seth Pomeroy, Richard Montgomery, David Wooster, William Heath, Joseph Spencer, John Thomas, John Sullivan, and Nathaniel Greene.
XX. Gen. Washington, on his arrival at Cambridge,
on the second of July, was received with joyful acclamations by the American army. He found them stretched
from Roxbury to Cambridge, and thence to Mystic river,
The whole sum which, in the course of the war, passed through
his hands, amounted only to fourteen thousand four hundred and
seventy-nine pounds sterling. After Gen. Washington's elevation
to the presidency, he continued to send to the comptrollers of the
treasury an annual account of his expenses, which, in some years,
amnounted to thirty-one thousand dollars. As the salary fixed by
law for that office was no more than twenty-five thousand dollars,
the excess he naid out of hii r;iYate f1,.ds:        PERIOD V....1775....1783....REVOLUTION.  135
a distance of twelve mniles. The British forces occupied
Bunker and Breed's hill, and Boston Neck.
The attention of the commander in chief was immediately
directed to the strength and situation of the enemy, and to the
introduction of system and union into the army, the want of
vwhich pervaded every department.. This was a delicate and
difficult attempt, but the wisdom and firmness of Washington removed every obstacle, and at length brought even independent freemen, in a good degree, to the controul of military
discipline
XXI. While Washington was employed in organizing
his army, and preparing for future operations, an important expedition was planned against Canada, the charge
of which was assigned to Gens. Schuyler and Montgome.
ry. On the 10th of September, one thousand American
troops landed at St. Johns, the first British post in Canada, one hundred and fifteen miles north of Ticonderoga,
but found it advisable to retire to the.Isle aux Noix,
twelve miles south of St. Johns.  Here the health of Gen.
Schuyler obliged him to return to Ticonderoga, and the
command devolved on Gen. Montgomery. This enterprising officer, in a few days, returned to the investment
of St. Johns, and on the 3d of November, received the
surrender of this important post.
On the surrender of St. Johns, five hundred regulars and
one hundred Canadians became prisoners to the provincials.
There were also taken thirty-nine pieces of cannon, seven
rnortars, and five hundred stands of arms.
Gen. Montgomery next proceeded against Montreal,
which without resistance, capitulated. From Montreal
he rapidly proceeded towards Quebec.
Before his arrival, however, Col. Arnold, who had been
despatched by Gen. Washington with one thousand
American troops from Cambridge, had reached Quebec
by the way of the Kennebeck, a river of Maine,-had ascended the heights of Abraham, where the brave Wolfe
ascended before him; but had found it necessary to retire
to a place twenty miles above Quebec, where he wras
waiting for the arrival of MontgomerySeldom was there an expedition attempted during the American war, in which more hardship was endured, or more un
tiring perseverance mnanifested, than in this of Arnold's. Ia
ascending the Kennebeck, his troops were constantly obliged
to work against an impetuous current, and often to haul their
batteaux up rapid currents and over dangerous falls. Nor was
their march through the country, by an uncxplored route of
three hundred miles, less difficult or dangerous. They had
swamps and woods, mountains and precipices, alternately to
surpass. Added to their other trials, their provisions failed,
and, to support life, they were obliged to eat their dogs, cartouch boxes, clothes and shoes.
While at the distance of one hundred miles from human habitations, they divided their whole store, about four pints of
flour to a man. At thirty miles distance, they had baked alnd
eaten their last pitiful morsel. Yet the courage and fortitude
of these men continued unshaken. They were suffering for
their country's cause, were toiling fbr wives and children, were
contending for the rights and hlessings of freedom. After
thirty-one days of incessant toil through a hideous wilderness,
they reached the habitations of men.
Dec. lst, Montgomery having effected a junction with
Arnold, commenced the siege of Quebec. After continu-'
ing the siege nearly a month to little purpose, the bold
plan was adopted of attempting thle place by scaling the
walls. Two attacks were made, at the same time, in different quarters-of the town, by Miontgomery and Arnold.
The attempt, however, proved unsuccessful, and, to the
great loss and grief of America, fatal to the brave Montgomery. He fell whiile attemnpting to force a barrier, and
with him fell two distinguished officers, Capt. M'Pherson,
his aid, and Capt. Cheeseman.
After this repullse, Arnold retired about three miles
fromn Quebec, where he continued encamped through a
rigorous winter.  On the return of spring, 1776, finding
his forces inadequate to the reduction of Quebec, and not
being reinforced, he retired.  By the 18th of June, the
Americans, having been compelled to relinquish one post
after another, had wholly evacuated Canada.
The garrison of Quebec consisted, at the time of the above
attack, of about one thousand five hundred mnen; the American forces wvere near ei,,ht hundred. The Io,s of the Amerlcans in killed and wounded, was about one hundred, and three
hundred were taken prisoners.
The death of General Montgomery was deeply lamented
both in Europe and America. "The most powerful speakers
in the British parliament displayed their eloquence in praising
his virtues and lamnenting his fall." Congress directed a monurment to be erected to his memory. expressive of their sense of
his high patriotism and heroick conduct.
XXII. During this year, 1775, Virginia, throughl the
indiscretion of lord Dunmore, the royal governour, was
involved in difficulties little short of those to which the
inhabitants of Massachusetts were subjected. From the
earliest stages of the controversy with Great Britain, the
Virginians had been in the foremost rankof oppositior,
and, in common with other provinces, had taken measurefor defence.
These measures for defence, the royal governour re
garded with an eye of suspicion, and attempted to thwart
them by the removal of guns and ammunition, which had
been stored by the people in a magazine. The conduct
of the governour roused the inhabitants, and occasioned
intemperate expressions of resentment.
Apprehending personal danger, lord Dunmore retired
on board the Fowey man of war, from which he issued
his proclamations, instituting miartial law, and proffering
freedom to such slaves as would leave their masters, and
repair to the royal standard. Here, also, by degrees, he
equipped and arme I a number of vessels, and upon being refused provisions by the proviicials, fom on shore,
he proceeded to reduce the town of Norfolk to ashes.
The loss was estimated at three huLndred thlousand pounds
sterling. Nearly six thousand persons were deprived of
their habitations.
In like manner, ti.e royal governours of North and South Carolina thought it prudent to retire, and seek safety on board
men of war. Royal government generally terminated this year
throughout the cou,ntry, the king's governours, for the most
part, abdicating their g&amp;overnments, and taking refuge on board
the English shipping
XXIII. Early in the spring of 1776, Gen. Washing12*
13'stilate hias been transmitted to us. They did not probably
much exceed 150,000 withiln the compass of thle thirteen
original states.*
In their physical clareacter, the different Indian tribes,
within the boundaries of the United States, were nearly
the same. Their persons were tall, straight, and well proportioned. Their skins were red, or of a copper brown;
their eyes black, their hair long, black, and coarse. In
constitution they were firm and vilgorous, capable of sustaining great fatigue and-hardship.
As to their general character, they were quick of apprehension, and not wanting in genius.  At times, they
were friendly, and even courteous. In council, they were
distinguished for gravity and eloquence: in war, for
bravery and address.  When provoked to anger, they
were sullen and retired; and when determined upon revenge, no danrger could deter them; neither absence nor
time could cool thenm. If captured by an enemy, they
never asked life nor would they betray emotions of fear,
even in view of the tomahawk, or of the kindling faggot.
They had no books, or written literlture,- except rude hieroglyphics; and education amongD them was confined to the arts
of war, hunting, fishing, and the few manufactures which existed among them, most of which every male was more or less
instructed in. Their language was rude but sonorous, metaphorical, and energetic. It was well suited to the purposes of
public speaking, and, when acoompanied by imnpassioned ges.
tures, and uttered with the de3p guttural tones of the savage,
it is said to have had a singularly wild and impressive effect.
They had some few war songs.. which were little more than an
unmeaning chorus, but it is beiheved, they had no other compositions which were preserved.
Their arts and manufactures, were confined to the construcle
tion of wigwams, bows and arrows, wampum, ornaments, stone
hatchets, mortars for pounding corn, to the dressing of skins,
weaving-of coarse mats from the bark of trees, or a coarse sort
of hemp, &amp;c.
Their agriculture was small in exteiit, and the articles thev
* This is te etmat-. of Dr. Tr'4mbul1Lton contemplated the expulsion of the British army fron
Boston, by direct assault. In a council of war, it was
deemed expedient, however, rather to take possession of
and fortify Dorchester Heights, which commanded the
harbour and British shipping.  The night of the 4th of
Alarch was selected for the attempt. Accordingly, in the
evening a covering party of eight hundred, followed by
a working party of twelve hundred, with entrenching
tools, took possession of the Heights, unobserved by the
enemy.
Itere they set themselves to work with so much activity that, by morning, they had constructed fortifications
which completely sheltered them. The surprise of the
British cannot easily be conceived.  The English admiral, after examining the works, declared that, if the Americans were not dislodged from their position, his vessels
could no longer remain in safeity in the harbour. It was
determined, therefore, by the British, to evacuate Boston,
which they now did, and on the 17th, the British troops,
under command of lord William     Howe, successor of
Gen. Gage, sailed for Halifax.  General Washington, to
the great joy of the inhabitants, arnmy, and nation, immediately marched into the town.
The rear guard of the British was scarcely out of the town,
when Washington entered it on the other side, with coloulrs
displayed, drums beating, and all the forms of victory and triumph. He was received by the inhabitants with demonstrations of joy and gratitude. Sixteen months had fthe people suffered the distresses of hunger, and the outrages of an insolent
soldiery.
The town presented a mrelancholy spectacle, at the time the
army of Wasling'ton ecrtered. One thousand fi,re hundred loyalists, with their families, had just departed oc, board the British
fleet, tearing themselves firom home and frie nds, for the love of
the royal cause. Churches were stripped of pews and benches
for fuel, shops were opened and rifled of goods to clothe the
army, and houses had been pillaged by ars unfeeling soldiery.
XXIV. While affairs were prsceeding thus in tne
north, an attempt was made, in June and July, to destroy
the fort on SuLllivan's Island, near Charleston, S. C. by        PERIOD V....1775....1783....REVOLUTION.  109
Gen. Clinton and Sir Peter Parker. After an action of
upwards of ten hours, the British were obliged to retire,
having their shlips nearly torn to pieces, and with a loss
of two hundred killed and wounded. The loss of the
Americans was but ten killed, and twenty-two wounded.
The fort was commanded by Col. Moultrie, whose garrisou
consisted of but three hundred and seventy-five regulars, and a
Pew militia. On the fort was mounted twenty-six cannon of
eighteen and nine pounders. The British force consisted of two
fifty gun ships, and four frigates, each of twenty-eight guns,
besides several smaller vessels, with three thousand troops on
board. By this repulse of the British, the southern states obtained a respite from the calamities of war for two years and a
half.
XXV. During these transactions in the south) the continental congress was in session, intently observing the
aspect of things, and deeply revolving the probable issue
of the present important contest. The idea of independence had now been broached among the people, and the
way was, in a measure, prepared to-bring tne subject before the congress.
Accordingly, on the 8th of June, Richard Henry Lee
one of the deputies from Virginia, rose and made a motion to declare America free and independent;'The deputies of Pennsylvania and Maryland not being
present, and congress being desirous, by some delay, to
evince the maturity of their deliberations, adjourned the
further consideration of thle subject to the first of July.
On the arrival of the day assigned, the subject was resuimed, and on the 4th of July, 1776, upon the report of
Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Benjamin Franklin,
Roger Sherman, and Philip Livingston, the thirteen confederate colonies dissolved their allegiance to the British
crown, and declared themnselves Free and Independent,
under the name of the Thirteen United States oft America.
After specifically enumerating the wrongs received, and declaring these to be sufficient grounds'for a separation, they solemnly and deliberately proceevit. n,,he act of separation, ia,ieh words followiw:  140      PERIOD V....1775....1783....REVOLUTION' Ve, therefore, the representatives of the United States ol
America, in general congress assembled, appealing to the Suprerne Judge of the world, for the rectitude of our intentions,
and by authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly
publish and declare, That these united colonies are, and of
right ought to be, fiee and independent states; that they are
absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all
political connexion between them and the state of Great
Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as free
and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do
all other acts and things, which independent states may of right
do. And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divrine Providence, we mnutually
pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred
honours."
This declaration was received by the people with transports
of jiy. Public reioicings took place in various parts of the
Union, In New-York, the statue of George IIi. was taken
down, and the lead, of which it was composed, was converted
into musket balls. In Boston, the garrison was drawn up in
King's street, which, from that moment, took the name of State.
street, and thirteen salutes, by thirteen detachments, into which
the troops were formed, were fired; the bells of the town were
i:ung, in token of felicitation, and the evening concluded witli
the tearing in pieces, and burning the ensigns of royaltylions, sceptres, and crowns.
XXVI. Soon after the evacuation of Boston by the
British troops, Washington, believing that the possession
of New-York would be with them a favourite object, determined to make it the head quarters of his army, and
thereby prevent their occupation of it, if such a step had
been contemnplated. Accordingly, he soon removed to
that city with the principal part of his troops.
XXVII. On the 10th of June, Gen. William Howe
with the army which had evacuated Boston, arrived from
Halifax, off Sandy Hook. Here he was soon after joined
by his brother, Admiral Lord Howe, from England, with
a reinforcemnent.  Their combined forces amounted to
twenty-four thousand. On the 2d'of August, they land
ed near the Narrows, nine miles from the city.
XXVIII. Previous to the commencement of hostilitiesy
Admiral and Gen.. Howe communicated to Washlington,       PERIOD V....1775....1783....REVOLUTION.  141
that they were commissioned to settle all difficulties, be.
tween Great Britain and the colonies. But, not addressing Washington by the title due to his rank, he thought
proper to decline receiving their communication. Itappeared, however, that the power of these commissioners
extended little farther than, in. the language of their instructions, " to grant pardons to such as deserve mercy."
XXIX. The American army, in and near New-York
amounted to seventeen thousand two hundred and twentyfive men, a part of whom were encamped near Brooklyn,
on Long-Island. On the 27th of August, this body of
the Americans, under comnmand of Brigadier Gen. Sullivan were attacked by the British, under Sir Henry Clinton, Percy, and Cornwallis, and were defeated with the
loss of upwards of a thoutsand men, whlile the loss of the
British amnounted to less than four hundred. Gen. Sullivan, anrd Brigadier Generals Lord Steiling and Woodhull,
fell into the hands of the British, as prisoners.
In the heat of the engagement, General Washington had
crossed over to Brooklyn friom New-York, and on seeing some
of his best troops slaughtered, or taken, he uttered, it is said,
an exclamation of anguish. But deep as his anguish was, and
much as he wished to succour his troops, prudence forbad the
calling in of his forces from New-York, as they would by no
means have sufficed to render his army equal to t9at of the
English.
XXX. After the repulse at Brooklyn, perceiving the
occupatiow of his position on Long-Island to be of no
probable importance, Washington withdrew his troops to
New-York, and soon after evacuated the city, upon which,
on the 12th of October, the British entered it.
Seldom, if ever, was a retreat conducted with more ability
and prudence, or under more favourable auspices, than that ot
the American troops from Long-Island. The necessary preparations having been made, onr the 29th of August, at eight in
the evening, the troops began to mnove in the greatest silence.
But they were not on board their vessels before eleven. A vio.
lent northeast wind and the ebb tide, which rendered the current very rapid, prevented the passage. The time pressed,
however. Fortunately the wind suddenly veered to the north.
west. They immediately made sail, and landed in New-YorikPlovidence appeared to have watched over the Americans.
About two o'clock in the morning, a thick fog, and at this season of the year extraordinary, covered all Long-Island, whereas
the air was perfectly clear on the side of New-York. Notwith
standing the entreaties of his officers, Washingtoni remained the
last upon the shore. It was not till the next morning, when the
sutn was already high, and the fog dispelled, that the English
perceived the Americans had abandoned their camp, and were
sheltered from pursuit.
WVashington, with a part of his troops, retired to White
Plains, where he entrenched himself with great care.
Here, on the morning of the 28th of September, he was
attacked by Generals Clinton and Hiester. The loss in
the action on each side was several hundred.-But neithex
party could claim any decided advantage.
Whnile Washington was retiring from  New-York, Sir
William  Howe seized the opportunity to reduce Fort
Washington, on the Hudson, then under the command of
Col. Magaw.
Nov. 16th, the English forces invested the fort, and after a
severe contest, which continued nearly all day, Col. Magaw,
finding his ammunition mostly exhausted, surrendered the fort,
and with it about two thousand seven hundred men as prisoners of war. The surrender of fort Washington was followed,
shortly after, by the surrender of Fort Lee, on the Jersey
shore, the garrison abandoning it on the approach of the
enemy.
XXXI. Washington, having crossed the North River,
continued his retreat to Newark, Bruniswick, Princeton,
and Trenton; and thence crossed to the Pennsylvania
side of the Delaware; Lord Cornwallis being close in his
rear. This retreat through New-Jersey was attended by
circumstances of deep depression.  The Americans had
just lost two thousand seven hundred men in Fort Washington; numbers of the militia were daily claiming to be
discharged, and some of the leading characters, both in
New-Jersey and Pennsylvania, were changing sides, and
mnaking peace with the enemy.
In this season of general despondency, congress recommended to each of the States, the observance of a " day of solemn
fhsting and humiliation before God. At the same time they
called upon the States to furnish militia to reinforce the conti        PERIOD V... I7755....1783....iREVOLUTION.  I43
nental army, now so enfeebled as scarcely to amount to thiree
thousand men. Soon after, one thousand five hundred Pennsylvania militia joined the American stanidard.
XXXII. Notwithstanding the general aspect of affairs,
on the part of America, was thus forbidding, the continental congress, so far fromn betraying symptoms of despair, manifested nore confidence than ever; and, as if
success must eventually crown their enterprises, calmly
occutpied themselves in drawing up various articles of
confederation, and perpetual union between the states.
Such articles were obviously necessary, that the line of
distinction between the powers of the respective states,
and of congress, should be exactly defined. In thlis way
only would collisions be avoided, and the peace and harmony of the union be preserved.
Accordingly, stuch articles were now digested, and at
the sitting of congress, Oct. 4th, 1776, were signed by all
the members, and copies immediately sent to the respective assemblies of each State for approbation.
XXXIII. Decemnber 25th, at night, Washington recrossed the Delaware into New-Jersey, and, pushing his way
rapidly to Trenton, surprised and took prisoners, on the
following day, about one thousand Hessians, then in the
service of the Britishl. Having secured these prisoners on
the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware, he marched to
Princeton, and attacked a party of British, who had taken
refuge in the college. About sixty of the enemy were killed, and three hundred made prisoners.
The successes at Trenton and Princeton revived the
desponding friends of independence. During the month of
December a melancholy gloom had overspread the United
States. These successes, however, seemed to brighten the
prospect, and promise better things. Washington now retired to Morristown, where his army were nearly all inoculated with the small pox, that disease having appeared
among the troops, and rendering such a measure necessary. The disease proved mortal but in few instances, nor
was there a day- in which the soldiers could not, if callel:
upon, have fought the enemy.XXXIV. On the opening of the campaign of 1777, the
army of Washington, although congress had offered to
recruits bounties in land, and greater wages, amounted to
little more than seven thousand-men. Towards the latter
end of May, Washington quitted his winter encampment
at Morristown, and, about the same time, the royal army
moved from Brunswick, which thley had occupied during
the winter. Much shifting of the armies followed, but no
definite plan of operation had apparently been settled by
either.
Previouts to this, however, General IHowe sent a detachment
of two thousand men, undior command of Gen. Tryon, Gen.
Agnew, and Sir WVilliarn Erskine, to destroy some stores and
provisions deposited at Danbury, in Connecticut. Meeting
with no resistance, they reached Danbui-; on the 26th of
April, and destroyed one thousand eight h1undred barrels of
beef and pork, and eight hundred of flour, two thousand
bushels of grain, clothing for a regiment, one hundred hogs.
heads of rum, and one thousaud seven hundred and ninety
tents. Besides the destruction of these articles, the enemy
wantonly burned eighteen houses with their furniture, murdered three unoffending inhabitants, and threw them into the
games.
At length, the British General Howe leaving New-Jersey, embarked at Sandy Hook, with sixteen thousand men,
and sailed for the Chesapeake. On the 14th of August,
he landed his troops, at the head of Elk river, in Maryland.
It being now obvious that his design was the occupation
of Philadelphia, Washington immediately put the American army in motion, towards that place, to prevent, if possible, its falling into the hands of the enemy.
The two armies met at Brandywine, Delaware, on the
11th of September, and after an engagenent which continued nearly all day, the Americans were compelled to
retire.
The loss of the Americans in this action was estimated at
three hundred killed, and six hundred wounded.  Between
thiree and four hundred, principally the wounded, were madr
pnfers' The loss of the British was stated at less than or
aItndrtd kille antd four hundred wounded.Not considering the battle of Brandywine as decisive, congress, which was sitting in Philadelphia, recommended to the
commander in chief to'fisk another engagement; preparations
for which were accordingly made. Sept. 16th, the two armies
drew near to each o6ther, and the advance guards began to
skirmish, when they were separated by a heavy rain, which
rendered the musketry and amnmunition of the armies wholly
unfit for action.
XXXV. An easy access to Philadelphia was now presented to the enemy, and on the 26th Howe entered the
place without molestation. The principal part of the
British army was stationed at Germantown six miles
from Philadelphia.  Congress adjourned to Lancaster,
and Washington encamped at eighteen miles distance from
Germantown.
XXXVI. Immediately after the occupation of Philadelphia, the attention of General Howe was drawn to the reduction of some forts on the Delaware, which rendered
the navigation of that river unsafe to the British.-Accord.
ingly, a part of the royal army was detached for that purpose. Washinigton seized the opportunity to attack the
remainder at Germantown.
This attack was mnade Oct. 4thl but, after a severe action, the Americans were repulsed with a loss of double
that of the British. The loss of the Americans was two
hundred killed, six hundred wounded, and four hundred
prisoners; that of the British was about one hundred killed, and five, hundr ed wounded.
After this action, the British removed to Philadelphia,
where they continued long inactive. Washington retreated to Skippack creek, and there encamped.
Great was the chagrin of Washington, on account of the repulse at Germantown, which was much increased by the auspicious commencement of the battle, and the flattering prospect
of a speedy and comnplete victory. The ultimate failure of the
Americans was attributed to the inexperience of a part of the
troops, and to embarrassments arising from a fog which increased the darkness of the night. Congress,'however, expressed
their approbation of Washington's plan of attack, and highly
applauded the courage and firmness of the troops.

14L5XXXVII. While such was the progress of militarV
operations in the middle States, important events vera
taking place in the north.
It has already been noticed, that in May, 1775, Ticon.
deroga and Crown Point had been taken by surprise, by
Colonels Allen and Arnold; that in the ensuing fall, Gen.
MIontgomery had reduced the fort of St. John's, capturedi
Montreal, and made an ineffectual, though desperate am
sault upon Quebec,
On the return of spring, the American army gradual.
ly retired up the St. Lawrence, and after a loss of one
post and another, in June, 1776, entirely evacuated
Canada.
In the spring of 1777, it was settled in England that
an invasion of the States should be attempted from the
north, and a communication formed between Canada andc
New-York. Could such a plan hlave been executed, it
would obviously hlave precluded intercourse between NewEngland and the more scouthern States.
The execution of the plan was committed to Gen. durgoyne, who left Canada with seven thousand troops, besides a powerful train of artillery, and several tribes of
Indians.
XXXVIII. On the lstof July, Burgoyne landed and
invested Ticonderoga.  The American garrison hlere
amounted to three thousand men, under command of Gen.
St. Clair, an officer of high standing.
Deeming this force inadequate to maintain the post,
especially as Burgoyne had taken possession of Mount
Defiance, which commanded Ticonderoga and not having provisions to sustain the army for more than twenty
days, St. Clair perceived no safety for the garrison but in
a precipitate flight. Accordingly, on the night of the 5th
Ticonderoga was abandoned.
By a circuitous march, St. Clair continued to retreat.
first into Vermont, although closely pursued, and thence to
Hudson river, where, after having lost one hundred and
~wenty pieces of artillery, with a great quantity of militarystores, he joined Gen. Schuyler, commanding the maill
army of the north.  After this junction, the whole army
continued to retire to Saratoga and Stillwater, and at length
took post on Van Shaick's Island, in the mouth of the Mohawk, on the 18th of August.
After the taking of Ticonderoga, Gern. Burgoyne, with
the great body of his troops, proceeded up the lake, and
destroyed the American flotilla and a considerable quantity of bagage and stores, which had been deposited at
Skeensborough. Having halted at this place for nearly
three weeks, he proceeded to Fort Edward, on the Hudsorn
where he did not arrive until July 30th, his way having
been obstructed by Schuyler's army, which felled a grat
number of trees across the road, and demolished the bridges,
while on their retreat.
XXXIX. While Gen. Burgoyne lay at Fort Edward,
a detachment of his army of five hundred ELnglish and
one hundred Indians, under Col. Baum, who had been sent
to seize a magazine of stores at Bennington, in Vermontb
was totally defeated, and Col. Baum slain, by a party of
Vermont troops called Green Mountain Boys, and some
New-Hampshire militia, under command of Gen. Stark.
Baum, on his arrival near Bennington, learning that the
Americans were strongly entrenehed at that place, halted, and
despatched a messenger to Gen. Burgovne for s reinforcement.
Gen. Stark now on his march with a body of New-Hlampshire militia, to join Gen. Schluyler, receiving intelligence of
Baums approach, altered his minovement, and coellected his
force at B1ennington.
Before the expected reinforcement could arrive, Gen. Sturk,
having added to his Newv-Hampshire corps a body of Vermont
mnilitia, determained to attack Baumn in his entrenchments.
Accordingly, on the 16th of Augast, an attack was made,
which resulted in the flight of Baum's detachment at the moment in which the reinforcement of troops, despatched by
Gen. Burgoyne, arrived. 5With the assistance of these, the
battle was now rertewed, but ended in the discomfiture of the
British forces, and with a loss, on their part, of about seven
liundred in killed and wounded. The loss of the Americans
was about one hundred.

aturage of the Americans, and as greatly disappointe,

cultivated, were few in number. Corn, beans, peas, potatoes,
melons, and a few others of a similar kind, were all.
Their skill in medicine was confined to a few simple prescriptions and operations. Both the cold and warm bath were often
applied, and a considerable number of plants were used with
success. For some diseases they knew no remedy, in whichl
case they resorted to their Powvow, or priest, who undertook
the removal of the disease by means of sorcery.
It may he remarked, showever, that the diseases to whlich t1he
Indians wdre liable, were few, comnpared with those which prevail in civilized society.
The employments of the men were principally, Ieunting, ftshibig,
and war. The wom0en dressed the food; took charge of the dormestic concerns;- tilled their narrow and scanty fields; and
performed almost all the drudgeir connected with their household affairs.
The amusements of the men were principally leaping, shooting
at marks, dancing, gamining, and hunting, in all of whlich they
made the most violent exertions. Their dances were usually
performed round a large fire. In their war dances they sung,
or recited the feats whichl they or their ancestors had achieved;
represented the manner in which they were performed, and
wrought themselves up to an inexpressible degree of martial
enthusiasm. The females occasionally joined in some of these
sports, but had none peculiar to themselves.
Their dress was various. In summer, they wore little besides
a covering about the waist; but in winter, they clothed themselves in the skins of wild beasts. They were exceedingly fond
of ornaments. On days. of show and festivity, their sachems
wore mantles of deer-s in, embroidered with white beads, or
copper, or they were painted withl various devices, Hideousfiess was the object aimed at in painting themselves. A chain
of fish-bones about the neck, or the skin of a wildcat, was a
sign of royalty.
For habitations the Indians had wcekwamns, or wigwams as pronounced by the Englisb.   These originally consisted of a
strong pole erected in the centre, around which at the distance,
of ten or twelve feet, other poles were driven obliquely into the
ground, and fastened to the centre pole at the top. Their coverings were of miats, or barks of trees, so well adjusted as to
render them dry and comfortable.
Their domestic uteneils e'xtended not beyond a hatchet of stone,.feiw shells and sharp stones which they used for knives: stone

barras3 and retard his movemeni.ts.
The situation of Gen. Burgoyne2 at this tie, was seria
ously perplexhing, being greatly in want of provisions9
and the course of wisdom and' prudence being not a little
difficult to determine. T7o retreat was to abandon the ob.
ject of his expedition  to adv-aace seem ed replete with
difficulty and danger. This latter step, however, at length
appeared the most judicious.

Stillwater. On the 17th9 his'arnrny came nearly in contact with thlat of the American, now commanded by Gen.
Gates, who had succeeded Schuyler, August 21; some
skirmishing ensuIed, without bringing on a general battle.
Two days after, the two armies met, and a most obsti.
nate, though indecisive engagemient ensued, in which the
Americans lost, in killed and wounded, between thiree and
four hundred, and the British about six hundred.
On the 7thl of October, the battle was renewed, by e
movemeait of Gen. Burgoyne towards the left of the Ame
ricans, by which he hoped to effect his retreat to the lakes,
The battle was extrem ely severe'; and darkness only put
an end to thle effusion of blood,
During the ni,ght which succeeded, an attemrpt was made
by the royal army to retreat to Fort Edward. -While
preparing to marcl, intelligence w5s receivedt that this
fort was already in possession of the Americans.  No
avenue to escape now appeared open. WI orn down with
constant toil and watching, and having ascertained that he
had but three days' provisions, a council of war was call
ed, which unanimously resolved to canpituidte to Gen.
Gates. Preliminaries were soon after settled, and the
army, consisting of five thousand seven hundred effective
mnen, surrendered prisoners of war onr the 17th of October.
Gen. Gates, iminediately after the victory, despatchedt
Col. Wilkinson, to carry the happy tidings to Congress.
On being introduced into the hall of congress, he said,        PERIOD V....177... 783....REVOLUTION,    149
The whole British army hias laid down arms at Saratoga:
our sons, full of vigour and courage, expect your orders:
it is for your wisdomt to decide where the cauntry may
stiil have need of their services.2
XLI. It would he difficult to describe the transports of
joy which the news of the surrender of Butrgoyne excited
among the Americans.  They now began to look forward
to the future with sanguine hopes, and eagerly expected
the acknowledgmnent of their country's independence by
France and other European powers. The capitulation of
Gen. Burgoyne, at Saratoga, was soon followed by an acknowledgment of the independence of America at the
coutrt of France* and the conclusion of a formal treadty
of alliance and com-merce between the two countries-anr)
event hiighly auspicious to the interests of America. The
treaty was signed Feb. 6th.-" neither of the conitracting
powers to' make war or peace, without the formal consent
of the other.".
For more tllhan a year, commissioners firom congress, at the
head of whom was Dr. Franklin, had resided at the court of
France, urging the above important steps. But the success of
the American struggle was yet too doubtful for that country
to embroil herself in a war with Great Britain. The capture
of the Britishl army at Saratoga seemed to increase the probability that the American armns wvould finally triumph, and decided France to espouse her caust.
XLII. Upon thie conclusion of the campaign of 1777
the British army retired into winter quarters in Philadelphia, and the American army at Valley Forge, on the
Schuylkill, fifteen miles from Philadelphia.
Scarcely were the American troops established in their
encampment, which, consisted of huts, before they were in danger of a famtine. The adjacent country was nearly exhaustod,
and that which it miglht have spared, the inhabitants concealed
in the woods.  At this time also, bills of credit had fallen to
one fourth of their nominrial value, so that one handred dollarss

Spain in March'; Russia in July.in paper, would command no more than twenty-five dollars, i-t
specie. In addition to these scenes of perplexity and suffering,
the army was nearly destitute of comfortable clothing.
Many, for want of shloes,' walked barefoot on the frozen
ground: few, if as.ny, had blankets for the niight. Great nuni
bers sickened. Near thre thou sand t a time were incaabal
of bearing arms. Whitp the defenters of Vthe country we-a
thus suffering- and perishin,-, the royal ariny was enjoying all
the conveniences wlhich an opulent citv afforded.
YLIIL. On the alliance of Anmerica withl France, it
was resolved in Great Britain inmmediately to evacuate
Philadelphia, and to concentrate the royal fotrce in the
city of New-York.   In pursuance of this resolotin, the
royal army, on the 1 $th of JunLe, passed the Delaware into New-Jersey, and continued their retreat to New-York.
General Washington, penretrating their design, had already
sent forward a detachment to aid tihe New-Jersey militia, in
impeding the progress of the eneiny. With the main body of
his army, he now crossed the Deolaare in pursuit. June 28th,
the two armies were engaged at Monmouth, sixty-four miles
from Philadelphia, anc afer a severe contest in which thi
Americans, upon the whole, obtained the adivantage, were separated only by night.  Ge W- ashiniton and his army reposed on the field of battle, intending to renew the attack in
the morning. But thie British general, during the night, nmade
good his retreat towards N ew -York.
The sufferings of both armies during this engagement, from
the heat of the day, were unparalleled in tic history of the revolutionary war. No less than fifty-nine British soldiers perished from heat, and several of thie.tAmericans died through-!
the same cause. The tongues of mnany of the soldiers were so
6wollen, that it was impossible to retain themn in the mouth.
The loss of the Americans was eight officers and sixty-one
privates killed, and about one hundred and sixty wounded;
that of the British in killed, wounded, and missing, was three
hundred and fifty-eight men, including officers.. One hundred(
were taken prisoners, and one thousand deserted during the
march.
XLIV. On the 1st of July, Count D'Estaing arrived
at Newport, IR. I. fiom France, with twelve ships of the
line and six frigates, to act in concert with the Ameri
cans in an attempt on Rhode-Island, which had been in
possession of the British since December, 1776.

tamg, and arrived in sight of Rhode-Island the day after the
French fleet had entered the harboulr of Newport. On the appearance of Howe, the French Admiral, instead of co-operating with the Amnericans, sailed oult to give him battle. A storm,
however, arising, separated the fleets. D'Estaing entered Boston to repair.  Howe, after the storm, returned to Rhode-Isl
and and landed Sir Henry Clinton, with four thousand troopsbut, fortuniately, the Americans hadc raised the siege of NTewport the day befbre, anl left the island.-Sir Henry Clinton
soon after sailed a'ain for. ew-Yoi.'r
XLV. Hithierto the conquest of the States had been attempted, by proceeding froo,. north to south; but that
order, towards the close of tis year, began to be inverted,
and the southern States became the principal thleatre on
which the British conducted thleir offensive operation,s.
Georgia, being one of th1e weakest of the Southern
States, was marked out as the first object of attack, in
that quarter of the urnion.
In November, Col. Campbell was despatched from
New-York by Coy. Clinton, with a force of two thousand
men, against Savannah, the capital of that State.  Thi
expedition proved surccessfol, and Savannah, and with it
the State of Georgia itself, fell into the power of the English.
On the arrival of Camhbell and his troops at Savannah, he
was opposed by Gei. I owe, the American officer to whomr
was entrusted the defence of Georgia. His force, consisting
of only 600 continentals, aod a few hundred militia, was inadequate, however, to resist the enemy. After an engagement9
in which the Americans killed upwards. of one hundred., lnd
took about four hundred and fifty prisoners, with several cannon, and large quantities of military stores, the capital surrena
dered.
XLVI. The campaign of 1779 was distinguished for
nothing splendid, or decisive, on the part either of America or Enpiland.
T'he British seemed to have aimed at little more than
to distress, plunder, and consume, it having been, early
in the year, adopted as a principle upon which to proceed, "to render the colonies of as little avail as possible
to their new connexiltns."
15;    i2    PERIlOD       7 1....1783....REVOLUTION.
Actuated by these motives, an expedition was fitted out
rorn New-York for Vlirginia, whiclh in a predatory incursion, took possession of l1arge naval stores, magazines
of provisions, and great quantities of tobacco. After en
riching themselves witl various kinds of booty, and burn
ing several places, they returned to New-York.
Soon after this expedition to Virginia, a similar one
nncer tlhe conimmand of the infamous Gov. Tryon, was
projected against the maritimne parts of Connecticut.
During this expedition, New-Hfaven   was plundered;
East-Hlaven, Fairfield, Norwalk, and Green's Farms,
were wantonly burnt.
XLVII. The exertions of the Americans during this
campaign, were still more feeble than those of the enemy.
Scarcely an expedition was planned which merits any
notice, and. with the exception of the reduction of Stoney
Point, forty miles n-orth of New-York, on the Hudson,
scarcely any thinrg was accomplished of importance.  The
reduction of this place, July 15th, was one of the most
bold enterprises which occurred in the history of the
var.
At this time, Stolney Point was in. the condition of a real for..
tress; it was furnishe.d with a select garrison of more than six
hundred men, and had stores in abundance, and defensive preparations which were formid-Lble.
Fortified as it was, Gert. Washington ventured an attempt
to reduce it. The enterprise was committed to Gen. WTayne
who, with a stron- detachment of active infantiy, set out towards the place at noon. H:is march of fourteen miles, over
higih mnounta.ins, through deep mmorasses, and difficult defiles,
vas accomplished by eiglht ocfocl inl the evening.
At the distance ol a mile from the Point, Gen. Wayne halted and forme-d his men into two colunIls, putting himself at the
head of the right. Both columns were directed to march in
order and siletice, with unloaded muskets and fixed bayonets.
At midnight they arrived under the walls of the fort.  "An
unexpected obstacle now presenrted itself: the deep mrorass,
which covered the works, was at this time overflowed by the
tide.
The English opened a tremendous fire of mnusketry -and c.nnon loaded wiith grape slhot: but neithler the inundated morass,         EillOD.... 1775... 1783....REVOLUTION  153
nor a double palisade, nor the storm of fire that was poure&amp;
upon them, could arrest the impetuosity of the Americans;
they opened their way with the bayonet, prostrated whatever
opposed them, scaled the fort, and the two columns met in the
centre of the works. The English lost upwards of six hundred
men in killed anld prisoners. The conquerors abstained from
pi;lage, anrd from all disorder; a conduct the more worthy, as
they had still present in mind the ravages and butcheries, which
their enemies had so recertly committed in Virginia and Connecticut. Humanity impairted new effilgence to the victory
which valour had obtained."
XLVIII. Another expedition, planned and execute&amp;
this year, entitled to some notice, was one under Gen.
Sullivan, against the Six Nations, which, with the excep
tion of the Oneidas hlad been induced, by the English, to
take up arms against America.
At the head of between four and five thousand men,
Gen. Sullivan marched intto the country, up the SuLsquelannah, and attacked the Indians, in well constructed for.
ifications. The resistance of the savages was warlike,
Being overpowered, however, they were obliged to flee
Gen. Sullivan, according to his inrstructions, proceeded
to lay waste their country. Forty villages were consumed, and one hundred and sixty thousand bushels of corn
were destroyed.
XLIX. It has already been stated, that the campaign
of 1779 was remarkable for the feeble exertions of the
Americans. Among the causes wvhich conttributed to
lessen their activity, the failure of tl-he French fleet, in
every scheme undertaken for their benefit, was no inconsiderable one. America had expected much from an allianice with France and looked to the French fleet under
D'Estaing, to hasten the downfall of British power in the
country. Buht when they perceived nothing equal to their
expectation accomplished, they became despondent, and
exertion was enfeebled.
But another and a still more powerful cause of these
feeble exertions, on the part of the Americans, was the
daily depreciation of their bills of credit.As the contest between Eng,land and'America originatedl in
the subject of taxation, it was ear-ly perceived by the continental congress, that the imnposition. of taxes, adequate to the
exigences of war, even if practicable, would be impolitick.
The only expedient, therefo-re, in their power to adopt, was
the emission of bills of credit, r'cprasenting specie, under a
publick engagemenit ultimately to redeem those bills, by an
e-xchange of gold or silver.
Accordingly, in Junae, 177d5, o-n the resolution to raise an
ar-my, congress issned- bill,i' edIt,lo'the amount of two md-il
lions of dollars. This ms,n as tbflowved,~ tbe re t mnonthi,
by the issue of anotlirnnr cii eei.  For t1heir redemption, thl
conifederated colonies wer rc,'ed-each colony to provide
mneanis to pay its             -aic iyb year 1 779.
I'n the early period's of Con vwar, the enthusiasm of the people
for liberty made them  comnarro 2n-.ively findifferent to property.
The cause was popular andl t'oe ps blink credit good. Bills of
credit, therefore, by cerninon consent, rapidly circulated, and
calculations a-bout private interest wvere, in a g-reat mneasure,
suspended.
It was obviouts, how,ever, tibat ther-e was a point, beyondI
which the cr-edit of thesc bills -wouldl not extend. At th-e expirstiois of eighteen i,nontbs fr-P thei-r first emission, whien
about twenty millions lid beeD issued, they began to depreciate. At first the, dim,oni-o-i- of the-ir val-ise was scarcely per..
ceptible, hut from that time. it. dal incenesed.
Desirous of arresti ig the growinc depreciation, co-ngress at
lengthi resorted to loans Mnd tmeacls. B t loans were diflicult to
negotiat'e, and taxes; in seve-ral of' the Sll-ates, could not'be collected. Pressed wito11 the necessities of an arsmy, conigress
found themselves obli -ed to centinue to issue bills., after they
hiad be0un to depreciate, annC to pay th'-a depreci-ation., by in1creasing thec sums emyitted. t y the, year 1780, thle, amount in
circul-atio-n was the overwbelrnrn sufn of two hund.red m-illions.
Thie prog-ress of t-his dpc1- eciation N s orthl of notiee.-ToWards the close of' -117U7, tObe dJepreciatio'n was two or three fox

PERIOD V... 775....783....REVOLUTIOTN     15
Publick agents, who received a commission to the amount of
their purchases, felt it to be their interest to give a high price
for all commodities. These causes co-operating with the decline of public confidence, anJ the return of more selfish feelings, rapidly inc,reased the d3ppreciation, until bills of credit, or
what has been co6mmoly called, " continental'currency," became of little or no value.
The evils which resulted from this system were immense.
Under it, it became extremely difficult to raise an army, and
to provide necessaries for its subsistence. At the'same time, it
originated discontents among- the officers and soldiers, since
their pay, in this depreciated currency, was inadequate to the
support of their families at homne. "Four months pay of a private, would not procure his family a singale bushel of wheat,
and the pay of a colonel would not purchiase oats for his horse."
Under circumnstances like these, it reflects the highest honour
upon Washington, that his wisdom and prudence should have
been able to keep an army together.
In addition to these evils, which fell so heavily upon thle
army, others, not less deplorable, fell upon the community. In
order to prevent the growing depreciation of their bills, congress directed that they should be a legal tender. But this,
while it did not much retard the're,rular diminutiGn of their
value, was the source of immeasuirabole iniustice and distress.
The aged, who had retired to enjoy the fruits of their industry, found their substance but a scvunty pittance. The widow
was compelled to take a shilling, where a pound was her due,
and the orphan was obliged to discharge an executor on the
payment of sixpence on the pouind. In many instances, tihe
earnings of a long life were, in a fewiv years, reduced to a trifling sunm.
Had congress foreseen these evils, they would have guarded
against them. But it was a day of poverty and experiment.
They designed no injustice. They had placed before them the
freedom of the country friom the yoke of British dominion, and
if, in their zeal to effect it, they sometimes erred, the sufferings
which resulted from their ignorance have been a thousand
times comnpensated, by the subsequent enjoyments of a free
and independent people.
L. Towards the close of the year 1779, Sir Henry
Clinton, comn,tting the English garrison of New-York
to Gen. Kniphausen, embarked with a force of between
seven and eight thousand men; for the reduction of Chayleston, South Carolina, which important object he accomp)lishet on tle 12th of:May, 1.7I'     OPERIOD V....1775....1783....REVOLTUION.
After a tempestuours voyage of some weeks, in whlich several
transports were lost, the army arrived at Savannah, whence
tl ey sailed on their destined purpose. On the 2d of April,
1780, Gen. Clinton opened his batteries against Charleston_
Gen. Lincoln at this time commnanded the Amnerican forces of
the south. Urged by the inhabitants, on the approach of the
enemy, to continue in Charleston, and assist in repelling the
attack, he consented to remain, and, with Gov. Rutledge, industriously forwarded preparations for defence.
Notwithfistanding these preparations, the batteries of the enemny soon obtained a decided superiosity over thlose of the town,
and left but little reason to the besieg ed to hope that they shoull
be able to defend the place. A council of war, held on the 21st,
agreed that a retreat woul- probabTly be impracticable, and advised that offers of capitllltiooi should be niade to Gen. Clinton,
which might admnit of the ar.roeys withsdraving, and afoibrd secu.
rity to the persons and pro pertyv of the inhabitants.
On the proposal of these terms, they were rejected. Hostiiities were now renewed by th1e garrison and returned with un.
usual ardour by the British. On the Jl th of May, finding the
longer defence of the place impracticable, a number of citizens
addressed Gen. Lincolnh advi,ing him to capitulate. Acquies~
cing in the measure, painful s it was, CGen. Lincoln again pre.
senated termins of capitulation, whic_ being accepted, the Amerib
can army, amounting to 5000, together with the inhabitants of
the place, and four hundred pieces of artillery, were surren.
dered to the 3British~
The loss on both sides, durinn the siege, was nearly equal. Of
thie royal troops, seventy-uiz were kdiled, and one hundred and
eighty-nine wounded. Of the Ainericauans, eighty-nine were
killed, and one hundred and so'ty wounded. By tht articles of
capitulation, he oairison was to march out of tow-n, and to deposit their arms in front of the eorks, but as a mark of humiliation, which eighteen mionths afer ard.s, was remembered and
retaliated. on Lordl Cornwatllis at Yorktowvn, the drums were
not to beat a Britisl march, nor the coours to be uncased.
LI. Shortly after the surrefler of Charleston, Sir
Henry CiintonC la-vi;g fo,ii tho usanid asniM, for the southern seItvice, under' ord -I      retirned t'o Ne'..'
York.   British garr iso;s wre.' now po:-led in different,

the people, nor was it easy to subdue that spirit how much
soever it might be temporarily repressed by royal and
oppressive tienace.
Notwithstanding the efforts of his majesty's servants
to preserve quietness, tie month of July did not pass by
in peace. General Sumpter, a man ardently attached
to the cause of libertyv in several engagemnents in South
Carolina, with the English and their partizans, gained
great advarntages over them, atnd in one instance, reduced
a regiment-the prince of Wales'-from two hundred and
seventy-eight to nine.
While Sumpter was thus keeping up the spirits of the
people by a succession of gallant exploits, a respectable
force was advancing through thle middle States, for the
relief of their southern brethren.
LII. The southern arnmy, now placed under the command of Gates, the hero of Saratoga-General Lincoln
having been superseded, amounted to four thousand; but
of these scarcely one thousand were regular troops, the
rest consisting of militia, from North Carolina, Maryland,
and Virginia.
As this army approached South Carolina, Lord Rawdon who commanded on the frontier, under Lord Cornwallis, concentrated the royal forces, two thousand in
number, at Camden, one hundred and twenty miles northwest from Charleston. Here Cornwallis, on learning the
movements of the Americans, joined him.
On the mnorning of the 16th of August, the two armies
met, and a severe and general action ensued, in which,
through the unpardonable failure of the militia, the British gained a decided advantage.
At the first onset, a large body of the Virginia militia, under
a charge of the British infantry with fixed bayonets, threw
down their arms, and fled. A considerable part of the NorthCarolina militia followed the;%? unworthy example. But the
continental troops evinced the most unyielding firmness, and
pressed forward with unusual ardour. Never did men acquit
themselves more honourably. They submitted only when forsaken by their brethren in arms, and when overpowered by
uiimbers.t4        PERIOD I....1492....167....DISCOVERIES,
ganme, cut their hair, %c. They made nets of thread, twisted
from the bark of Ind;ian hemp, or of the sinews of the moose
and deer. For fish-hooks they used bones which were bent.
Their food was of the coarsest and simplest kind-the flesh,
and even the entrails of all kinds of wild beasts and birds; and
in their proper season, green corn bleans, peas, &amp;c. &amp;c. which
they cultivated, and other fr its which the country spontaneously produced. FLesh and fish they roa-sted on a stick, or
broiled on the fire. In somne instances they boiled their meat
and corn by,puttillng hot stones in water. Corn they parche,
especially in the winter, and unpon this they lived in the ab
sence of othler food~
The m oney of the Indians called wamnpum, consisted of smat
beadcls wrougoht from sheln.s and strung on belts, and in chains.
The wampum of the New-Enogland indians was black, blue,
and white. That of the'i Natlons was of a purple colour.
Six of the whitle beads, and til-iree of the black, or blue, became
of the value of a penny. A be:I of wampum was given as a
tokeni of friendship, or as a seal or confirmation of a treaty.
There was little amon; therm that could be called society.
Except when roused by some strong excitement, the men were
generally indolent, taciturn, and unsocial. The women were
too degraded and oppressed to thirA of much besides their
toils. Removing too, as the seasons changed, or as the game
grew scarce, or as dan-er from a stronger tribe threatened,
there was little opportunity for fOrrning those local attachments
and those social ties, which spring from a long residence in a
particular spot.
Their language, also- thouo'h energetic, was too barren to
serve the purposes of familiai? conversation.  In order to be
understood and felt, it require 1d  e aid of strong and animated
gesticulation, whichl could ta]kae place only wheil great occasions excited thetm. It seenis, therefore, that they drew no
considerable part of their enjoynents fronm intercourse with
one another. Female beauty had liutle power over the men'.
and all other pleasures ga ve way to the strong impulses of publie festivity, or burning captives, or seekirng mn urderous reveure
or the chase, or war, or glory.
War was the favourite employment of the savages of Nerthia
America. It roused therm fron the lethargy intO which they
fell, when they ceased fionn the chase, and itunished them an
opportunity to distinguishe themselves-to achieve deeds of
glory, and taste the sd;eet5 of revenge. Their weaponts weio,r

In this battle, the brave Baron de Kalb, second in command9
at the head of the Marylanders, fell, covered with wounds9
which he survived only a few days. De Kalb was a German
by birth, and had formerly served in the armies of the French.
In consideration of his distinguished mnerit, as an officer and
soldier, congress resolved that a monulment should be erected
to his memory at Annapolis.
The battle of Camden was exceedingly bloody. The field oe
battle, the road and swamps, for some distance, were covered
with wounded and slain. The number of Americans killed,
although not certain, probably amounted to between six and
seven hundred, anld the wounded and prisoners to one thousand three hundred, or one thousand four hundred. The British
stated their loss to be only three hundred and twenty-four irs
killed and wounded; but it was probably much greater.
LIII. "The disaster of the army, under Gen. Gates,
overspread, at first, the face of American affairs with a
dismal gloom; but the day of prosperity to the United
States began, as will appear in the sequel, from that moo
ment to dawn.
" Their prospects brightened, while those of their ene.
mies were obscured by disgrace, broken by defeat, and,
at last, covered with ruin.  Elated with their victories
the conquerors grew more insolent and rapacious, while
the real friends of independence became resolute and determinedY"
LIV. While the campaign of 1780 was thus filled up
with important events in the southern department, it
passed away in the northern States, in successive disappointments and reiterated distresses.
In June, a body of five thousand of the enemy, under
Gen. Kniphausen, entered New-Jersey, and, in addition to
plundering the country, wantonly burnt several villages.
Besides these predatory incursions, by which the inhabitants suffered alarm, distress, and destruction of property,
they suffered greatly, also, from the constantly diminishing value of their paper currency, and irom unfavourabla
crops.
The situation of Gen. W ashington, often during the war em
barrassing, had been distressing through the winter, in his en.
campment at Morristown. The cold weas more in.rtnse than dhad ever been known to be before in this climate, within the
memory of the oldest inhabitant. The winter to this day bears
the distinctive epithet of the hard winter. The army suffered
extremely, and often had Washington the prospect before him
of being obliged to break up his encampment, and disband his
soldiers.
The return of spring brought little alleviation to their distress. Great disorder pervaded the departments for supplying
the army. Abuses crept in, frauds were practised, and notwithstanding the poverty of the country, economy, on the part
of the commissaries, was exiled.
In May, a committee from congress visited the army, asnd reported to that bodv, an account of the distresses and disorders
conspicuously prevalent. In particular, they stated, that "' the
army was unpaid for five months-that it seldom had snore than
six days' provisions in advance, and was, on several occasions,
for sundry successive days without meat-that the medical department had neither sugar, coffee, tea, chocolate, wine, nor
spirituous liquors of any kind; and that every department of
the army was without money, and had not even the shadow of
credit left."
LV. But under all this tide of evils, there appeared no
disposition, in public bodies, to purchase their relief by
concession.  They seemed, on the contrary, to rise in
the midst of their distresses, and to gain firmness and
strength by the pressure of calamity.
LVI. Fortunately for the Americans, as it seemed, M.
de Ternay arrived at Rhode-Island, July 10th, from
France, with a squadron of seven sail of the line, five frigates, and five smaller armed vessels, with several transports, and six thousand men, all under command of Lieutenant General Count de Rochambeau.    Great was the
joy excited by this event, and high raised expectations
were indulged from the assistance of so powerful a force
against the enemy.  But the British fleet, in our waters,
was still superlour, and that of the French, and the French
army, were, for a considerable time, incapacitated from cooperating with the Americans, by being blocked up at
Rhode-Island.
The arrival of the French fleet at Newport, was greeted by
the citizens with every demonstration of joy. The town was
illuminated, and congratulatory addresses were exchanged.159As a symbol of friendship and affection for the allies, Gendral
Vashington recommiended to the Amnerican officers to wear
black and white cockades, the ground to be of the first colour,
and the relief of the second.
LVII. The fortress of West-Point, on the Hudson, sixty miles northl of New-~pork, and its importance to the
Americans, has already been noticed.  Of this fortress,
Gen. Arnold had solicited and obtained the command.
Soon after assurming the command, Arnold enteced into
negotiations with Sir Henry Ciinton, to make such a disposition of the forces in the fortress, as that the latter
might easily take possession of it by surprise. Fortunately for America, this base plot was seasonably discovered
to prevent the ruinous consequences that must have fol.
lowed.  Arnold, however, escaped to the enemy, loaded
with infamy and disgrace.  Andre, the agent of the British, in this negotiation, was taken, and justly expiated
his crime on the gallows, as a spy.
Major Andre, at this time adjutant-general of the British
army, was an officer extremely young, but high-minded, brave,
and accomnplished. He was transported in a vessel called the
Vulture, up the Nor-th River, as near to West Point as was
practicable, without exciting' suspicion. On the 21st of Sep~
tember, at night,t a boat was sent from the shore to bring him
On its return, reaold met hima at the beach, withoutt the posts
of either army. Their business was not finished till too near
the dawn of day for Andre to return to the Vulture. He,
therefore, lay concealed within the American lines. During
the day, the Vulture iound it iecessary to change her position,
and Andre, not beiin able now to get on board, was compelled
to attempt his returna to INew-Yorki by land.
Having changed his military diess for a plain coat, and re
eeived a passport from Arnold, under the assumed name of
John Anderson, he passed the guards and outposts without
suspicion. On his arrival at Tarrytown, a village thirty miles
north of New-Yorkl, in the vicinity of the first British posts, he
was met by three militia soldiers-John Paulding, David Williams, and Isaac Van WVert. He showed them his passport,
and they suffered him to continue his route. Immediately after
this, one of these three nmen thinking that he perceived something singular in the person of the traveller, called him back.
Andre asked them where they were from? "From down bel'ow," they replied, intendin- to say from New-York. To.frank to suspect a snare, Andre immediately answered, " and
so am I."
Upon this they arrested him, when he declared himself to be
a British officer, and offered them his watch, and all the gold
hie had with him, to be released. These soldiers were poor and
obscure, but they were not to be bribed. Resolutely refusing
his offers, they conducted him to Lieut. Col. Jameson, their
commanding officer.
Jameson injudiciously permitted Andre, still calling himself
Anderson, to write to Arnold, who immediately escaped on
hoard the Vulture, and took refuge in NTew-York.
Washington, on h, way to head-quarters, from Connecticut,
where he had been to confer with Count de Fochambeauprovidentially happened to be at West Point, just at this time.
After taking measures to insure the safety of the fort, he appointed a board, of which Gen. Greene was president, to decide upon the condition and punishment of Andre.
After a patient hearing of the case, September 20th, in which
every feeling of kindness, liberality, and generous syrrpathy
was strongly evinced, the board, upon his own confesslon, unanimously pronounced Andre a spy, and declared, that agreeably to the laws and usages of nations, he ought to suffer death.
Major Andre had many fiiends in the Amnerican army, and
even Washington would have spared him, had duty to his
country permitted. -Every possible effort was made by Sir
Henry Clinton in his favour, but it was deemed important that
the decision of the board of war should be carried into execu
tion.  When MIajor Andre was apprised of the sentence of
death, he mnade a last appeal in a letter to Washington, that
lhe might be shot, rather than die on a gibbet.
"'Buoyed abeve the terrour of death," said he, " by the
consciousness of a life devoted to honourable pursuits, and
stained with n-o action that can Five me remiorse, I trust that
the request I make to your excellency at this serious period,
and which is to soften my last moments, will not be rejected.
Sympathv towards a soldier will surely induce your excellency,
and a military friend, to adapt the mode of my death to the
feelings of a man of honour. Let me hope, sir, that if aught i
my character impresses you with esteemrn towards rne, as the
victim of policy and resentment, I shall experience the on;eration of those feelings in your breast by being infrmed tat 1
am not to die on a gibbet.This letter of Andre rousedl the ssympathies cf Washingtn.

i6feelings should be sacrificed. Upon consulting his officers o,
the propriety of Major Andre's request, to receive the death of
a soldier-to be shot-it was deemed necessary to deny it, and
to make him an example. On the 2d of October, this unfor.'tunate young man expired on the gallows, while foes and friends
universally lamented his untimely end.
As a reward to Paulding, Williamis, and Van Wert, for their
virtuous and patri.tick conduct, Congoress voted to each of thenm
an anluity of two huLndred dollars and a silver lmedal, on ow

Arnold, the miserable wretclh, whose machinations led to the
melanchoel fate Andre experienced, escaped to NewYo'rk
where, as the price of Isis dtishonour, he reeived the commissioni of brigadierg'eneral, and the stiin of ten thaosaid pounds stes,
lii. Tihis last boon was thi grand secret of Arnold's fall from
virtue; his vanity and extravagance had led him into expense,
Vhich it was neitsher in the power nor will of congress to support.  Ie had iivolved hirsself int debt, fromn which he sav no

brinrg himn to the just eward of his treachery; and in so
doing to save the life of Andre.  But the attempt to accomplish -this object failed of success.
Havinig matured the plarn, Washington sent to Major Lee to
repair to head quarters, at Tappanr, on the H-udison. "  have

youll have some one in your cocrps, wtho is willing to undertake

MPJajor Lee named a sergeant-major of his corps, by the name
of Champe-a native of Virgiia, a man full of bone and muscle-with a countenance grave, thougohtful, and taciturn-of
tried courage, and inflexible operseverance.
Champe was sent for by Major Lee, andI the plan proposed
This was for him to desert-to escape to New-York-to appear frienfdly to the enemy-to watch Arnold, and, upon some
fit opportunity, with the assistance of somine one whom Champs
could trust, to seize him, and conduct him to a place on tht         PERIOD Y.. 1775  1783....REVOLUTIO4.    I 63
river, appointed, where boats should be in readiness to bear
them away.
Champe listened to the plan attentively-but, with the spirit
ef a man of honour and integrity,, replied-" that it was not
danger nor difficulty that deterred him from imme-diately accepting the proposal, but the ignominy of desertion, and the hypocrisy- of enlisting with the enemy!"
To these objections Lee replied, that although he would ap.
pear to desert, yet as he obeyed the call of his comrnander-inchief, his departure could not be considered as criminal, and
thiat, if he suffered in reputation for a time, the mnatter would
one day be explained to his credit. As to the second objection,
it was urgeld, that to bring such a man as Arnold to justiceloaded with guilt as he was-and to save Andre-so youngso accomplished-so beloved-to achieve so much good in the
cause of his country-was more than sufficient to balance a
wrong, existing only in appearance.
The objections of Chamnpe were at length surmounted, and
ie accepted the service. It was now eleven o'clock at night.
~.'ith his instructions in his pocket, the sergeant returned to
imp; and, takinr. his cloak, valice, and orderly book, drew
is horse froni the picket, and mounted, putting hnimself upon
)rtune.
Scarcely had half an hour elapsed, before Capt. Carnes, the
fficer of the day, waited uipon Lee, who was vainly attemptAig to rest, and informned him, that one of the patrol had fallen
with a dragoon, who being challenged, put spurs to his horse
nd escaped. Lee, hoping to conceal the flight of Chamnpe, or
t least to delay pursuit, complained of fatigue, and told the
aptain that the patrol had probably  mirstaken a countrymnan; a' dragoon. Carnes, howerver, was not thus to be quieted;
ad he withdrew to assemble his corps. Oa examrnination, it,as found that Champe was absent. The captain now returnd, and acquainted Lee wvith the discovery, adding that he had
etached a party to puLrsue the deserter, and begged the rnaer's written orders.
After mrnaking as much delay as practicable, without exciting.spicion, Lee delivers his orders, in whichi he directed the party
* take Champe if possible. ", Brino him alive," said he, "that
may suffer in the presence of the army; but kill him if he
tsits, or if he esca.pes after beinz taken."
A shower of rain fell soon after Charape's departure, which
a. arbled the pursuing dragoons to take the trail of his horse, his
itoes, in common with those of the horses of the army, being.ade in a peculiar form, and each havi g a private mark, which,1s to be seen mu tne path.Mleton, the leader of the pursuing party, left the camp a
few ininutes past twelve, so that Champe had the start of hut
lttle mnore than an hour-a period by far shorter than had beeni
contemplated. During the night, the dragoons were often delayed in the necessary halts to examine the road; but, on the
coming of morning, the impression of the horse's shoes was so
apparenit, that they pressed on with rapidity.  Some miles
above Bergen, a village three miles north of New-York, on
the opposite side of the HIudson, on ascending a hill, Champe
was descried, not more than half a mile distant. Fortunately,
Champe descried his pursuers at the same moment, and, conjecturing their object, put spurs to his horse, With the hope of
escape.
By taking a different roId., Champe was for a time lost sight
of-but, on approaching the river, he was again descried.Aware of his danger, he now lashed his valice, containing his
clothes and orderly book, to his shoulders, and prepared himself to plunge into the river, if necessary. Swift was his flight,
and swift the pursuit. Middleton and his party were within a
few hundred yards, when Champe threw himself from his horse
and plunged into the river, calling aloud upon some British galleys, at no great distance, for help. A boat was instantly despatched to the sergeant7s assistance, and a fire commenced
upon the pursuers. Champe was taken on board, and soon after carried to New-York, with a letter from the captain of the
galley, stating the past scene, all of whichhe had witnessed.
The pursuers having recovered the sergeant's horse and
cloak, returned to camp, where they arrived about 3 o'clock
the next day. On their appearance with the well known horse,
the soldiers made the air resound with the acclamations that
the scoundrel was killed. The agony of Lee, for a moment,'was
ast description, lest the faithful, honourable, intrepid Champe
had fallen. But the truth soon relieved his fears, and he repaired to WVashington to impart to hin the success thus far of
is plan.
Soon after the arriyal of Champe in New-York, he was sent
to Sir Henry Clinton, who treated him kindly, but detained himn
more than an hour in asking h1im questions, to auswer some of
which, without exciting suspicion, required all the art the sergeant was master of! He succeeded, however, and Sir Henry
gave him a couple of guineas, and recommended him to Arnold,
who was wishing to procure American recruits. Arnold received him kindly, and proposed to him to join his legion;
Champe, however,-expressed his wish to retire from war: but
assured tihe general, that if he should chane his rnind, he would
gnlit.         P RIOD 0 V 77.....775.1783....REVOLUTION.o  16
Champe found means to communicate to Lee an account of
his adventures; but, unfortunately, he could not succeed in ta..king Arnold, as was wished, before the execution of Andre.Ten days before Chainpe brought his project to a conclusion,
Lee received from him his final communication, appointing the
third subsequent night for a party of dragoons to meet him at
Hoboken, opposite New-York, when he hoped to deliver Arnold to the officers.
Champe had enlisted into Arnold's legion, from which time
he had every opportunity he could wish, to attend to the habits
of the general. He discovered that it was his custom to return
home about twelve evbry night, and that, previously to going
to bed, he always visited the garden. During this visit, the
conspirators were to seize him, and, being prepared with a gag,
they were to apply the same instantly.
Adjoining the house in which Arnold resided, and in which
it was designed to seize and gag him, Champe had taken off
several of the pailings and replaced them, so that with ease, and
without noise, he could readily open his way to the adjoining
alley. Into this alley he intended to convey his prisoner, aided
by his companion, one of two associates, who had been introduced by the friend to whom Champe had been originally
mnade known by letter from the commander-in-chief, and witlI
whose aid and counsel he had so far conducted the enterprise.
His other associate was, withl the boat, prepared at one of the
wharves on the Hudson river, to receive the party.
Chamxpe and his friend intended to place themselves each
under Arnold's shoulder, and thus to bear him through the
most unfrequented alleys anaI streets to the boat, representing
Arnold, in case of being questioned, as a drunken soldier,
whoul they were conveying to the guard-house.
When arrived at the boat, the difficulties would be all surmounted, there being no danger nor obstacle in passing to the
Jersey shore. These particulars, as soon as made known to
Lee, were communicated to the commander-in-chief, who was
highly gratified with the much desired intelligence. He de-:sired Major Lee to meet Chamnpe, and to take care that Arnold
should not be hurt.
The day arrived, andtl Lee, withl a party of accoutred horses,
(one for Arnold, one for the sergeant, and the third for his associate, who was to assist in securing Arnold,) left the camp,
niever doubting the success of the enterprise, from the tenour of
the last received communication. The party reached Hoboken about mnidnight, where they were concealed in the adjoin
ing wood--Lee, with three dramgoos, stationing himself neaxthe shore of the river.-Hour after hour passed, but no boat
approached.
At length the day broke, and the major retired to his party,
and, wTith his led horses, returned to the camp, where he proceeded to head-quarters to inform the general of the much lamented disappointment, as naortifying as in6xplicable. Washington, having perused Chamnpehs plan and communication, had
indulged the presumption, that at length the object of his keen
and constant pursuit was sure of execution, and did not dissemble the joy which such a conviction produced. He was
chagr'fined at the issue, and apprehended that his faithful serjeant must have been detected in the last scene of his tedious
and difficult enterprise.
In a few days, Lee received an anonymous letter from
Champe's patron and friend, informing him, that on the day
preceding' the night fixed for the execution of the plot, Arnold
had removed his quarters to another part of the town, to superintend the embarkation of troops, preparing, as was rumouredD
for an expeditiona to be directed by himself; and that the Ame
rican legion, consisting chiefly of American deserters, had been
transferred from their barracks to one of the transports, it being apprehended that if left on shore, until the expedition was
ready, many of them might desert.
Thus it happened that John Champe, instead of crossing the
Hudson that night, was safely deposited on hoard one of the
fleet of transports, from whence he never departed, until the
troops under Arnold landed in Virginia. Nor was he able to
escape from the british army, until after the junction of Lord
Cornwallis at Petersburg, when he deserted; and proceeding
high up intoc Virginia, he passed into North Carolina, near the
Saura towns, and keeping in the friendly districts of that State,'
safely joined the army soon after it hiad passed the Congaree,
in pursuit of Lord Rawdon.
Ils appearance excited extreme surprise among his former
comrades, which was not a little increased, when they saw the
cordial reception he mnet with from the late major, now Lieu
tenant Col. Lee. His whole story wvas soon known to the
corps, which re-produced the love and respect of olfficers and
soldiers, heretofore invariably entertained for the sergeant,
heightened by universal admiration of his late dclaring and arduous attempt
Champe was introduced to Cen. Greene, whlo very cheerfully complied with the preynse e made by the commander in
chief, so far as in his power; and, ihaving provided the sersgeant
with a good horse and nmoney for his journey, sent hirm to Ge.

aergeant, and presented him with a discharge from further ser--
vice, lest he might, in the vicissitudes of war, fall into the hands
of the enemy, when, if recognized, he was sure to die on a
gibbet.
We shall only add, respecting the after life of this interesting
adventurer, that when Gen. Washington was called by President Adams, in 1798, to the command of the army, prepared to
defiend the country, against Frenlch hostility, he sent to Lieutenant Col. Lee, to inquire for Champe; being determined to
bring him into the field at the head of a company of infantry
Lee sent to London county, Virginia, where Champe settled
after his discharge fromn the army; when he learned that the
gallant soldier had removed to Kentucky, where he soon after
died.
LIX. The year 1781 opened with an event extremnely
afflicting to Gen. Washington, and which, for a time seriously endangered the American army. This was the
revolt of the whole Pennsylvania line of troops, at Morristown, to the number of one thousand three hundred.
The cause of this mutiny was want of pay, clothing, and provisions.  Upon examination of the grievances of the
troops, by a committee from congress, their complaints
were considered to be founded in justice. Upon their
being redressed, the troops, whose time of service had
expired, returned hoiie and the rest cheerfully repaired
again to camp.
Gen. Wayne, who comnmanded these troops, and who was
greatly respected by them, used every exertion to quiet them,
but in vain. In the ardour of remonstrance with them, he
cocked his pistol, and turned it towards them. Instantly, an
hundred bayonetg were directed towards him, and the men
cried out, " we love you, we respect you; but you are a dead
man, if you fire. Do not mnistake us; we are not going to the
enemy. On the contrary, were they now to come out, you
should see us fight under your orders, with as much resolution
and alacrity as ever."
Leaving the camp, the mutineers proceeded in a body to
Princeton. Thither, Sir Henry Clinton, who had heard of the
revolt, sent agents to induce them to come over to the British,
with the promise of large rewards.
But these soldiers loved their country's cause too well to
listen to proposals so reproachful. They were suffering privadon, which, 1.d po'longer he sustainpd; but they spurned1selves with skins, as a defence against the arrows of their ene,
mies..
When they fou,rht in th opel field, they rushed to the attack wiVth icredible fury, and, at the same time uttered their
appalling war whoop.  Those whom they had taken captive
they Often tortured with every variety of cruelty, and to their
dying agonies added every species of insult. If peace was concluded on, the chiefs of the hostile tiibes ratified the treaty by
smoking in succession the same pipe, called the cahsmet, or pipe
of peace.
[rhe government of the Indians in general was an absolute
monarchy; though it differed in different tribes.  The will of
the sachem was law. In matders of moment, he consulted, however, his counsellors; but his decisions were final. War and
peace among some tribes, seem to have been determnined on in
a council formned of old men, distinguished by their exploits.
When in council they spoke at pleasure, and always listened
to the speaker witnh profound and respectful silence.
"When propositions for war or peace were ma.de, or treaties
roposed to them, by the colonial goverours, they mret the ambassadors in council, and at the enid of each paragraph, or proposition, the principal sachem delivered a short stick to one of
his council, intimating that it was his peculiar duty to remember that paragraph. This was repeated till every proposal
was finished; they then retired to deliberate among themselves.
After their, deliberations were ended, the sachemr, or sonme
counsellors -to whomin he had delegated this office, replied to
every paragraph in its turn, with an exactness scarcely exceeded in the written correspondence of civilized powers.
Each man actually rememrabered what was committed to him,
and with his assistance the person who replied remembered the
whole."'
The religious notions of the natives consisted of traditions5
mingled with many superstitions. - Like the ancient Greeks,
Romans, Persians, Hindoos, &amp;ce. they believed in the existence
of two gods, the one good, who was the superior, and whom
they styled the Great, or Good Spiit; the other evil. They
worshipped both; and of both formed images of stone, to which
they paid religious homage. Besides these, they worshipped
various other deities-such as fire, water, fthunder-any thing
which they conceived to be superior to themselves, and capable of doing them injury. The manner of worship was to sing
and dance round large fires. Besides dancing, they offered
prayers and sometimes sweet scented powder. In Virginia,
the Indians offered blood, deer's suet, and tobacco. Of the
cseationz-and the deluge they had distinct traditions~

with disdain, the offer of the enemy. They also seized, the
agents of the British, and nobly delivered them up to Gen
Wayne to be treated as spies.
LX. In the midst of these troubles, arising frorn discontents of the troops, news arrived of great depredations
in Virginia, by Arnold, whlo had left New-York ibr the
south, with one thousand six hundred men, and a number of armed vessels. Extensive outrages were committed'by these troops in that part of the country. Large
quantities of tobacco, salt, runl, &amp;c. were destroyed. In
this manner did Arnold show the change of spirit, whiich
had taken place in his breast, and his fidelity to his niew
engagements.
Upon receiving news of these depredations, at the request of Gen. Washington, a French squadron, from
Rhode-..Island, was sent to cutt off Ar rold's retreat. Ten,
of his vessels were destroyed, and a forty-four gun ship
was captured. Shortly after this, an engagement took
place off the Capes of Virginiia, between the French and
English squadrons, which terminated so far to the advan-.
tage of the English, that Arnold was saved from immi
nent danger of falling into the hands of his exasperated.
countrymen.
LXI. After the unfortunate battle at Camden, August
16th, 1780, congress thought proper to remove Gen.
Gates, and to appoint Gen. Greene in his place. In December, 1780, Greene assumed the commarnd. The army
at this time was reduced to two thousand men, more than
half of whom were militia, and all were miserably fed
and clothed.
With this force Gen. Greene took the field against a
superiour regular force; flushed with successive victories
through a whole campaign. Soon after taking the command, he divided his force, and, with-one part, sent Gen.
MVorgan to the western extremity of South Carolina.
At this time, Lord Cornwallis was nearly prepared to
invade North Carolina. Unwilling to leave such an enemy as Morgan in his rear, he despatched Col. Tarleton
to engage Gen. Morgan, and " to push him to the utmos?"        PERIOD g....1775....1783....REVOLUTION.  169
LXII. January 17th    178t, these two detachments
met, when was ifought the spirited battle of the Cowpens,
in which the American arms signally triumphed.
In this memorable battle, the British lost upwards of one
hundred killed, among wvhom were ten commissioned officers,
and two hundred wounded. More than five hundred prisoners
fell into the hands of the Americans, besides two pieces of ar
tillery, twelve standards, eight hundred muskets, thirty-five,
baggage waggons, one hualded dragoon horses; the loss ot
the Americans was no more than twelve killed and sixty
wounded.,The victory of the Cowpens must be reckoned as one of the
most brilliant achieved during the revolutionary war.  The
force of Morgan hardly amoulnted to five hundred, while that
of his adversary exceeded one thousand.  Morgan's brigade
were principally militia, while Tarleton commanded the flower
of the British army.
LXIII. Upon receiving the intelligence of Tarletonls
defeat, Cornwallis abandoned the invasion of North Caro
lina for the presenrt, and  narched in pursuit of Gen.
Morgan.
Greene, suspecting hiis intentions, hastened with his
army to join Morgan.   This junction was at length effected, at Guilford Court-Ilouse, after a fatiguing march,
in which Cornwallis nearly overtook him, and was prevented only by the obstruction of a river.
After his juinction with Morgan, Gen. Greene, with his
troops and baggage, crossed the river Dan, and entered
Virginia, again narrowly escaping the British, who were
in close pursuit.
LXIV. Satisfied with having driven Greene from
North Carolina, Cornwallis retired to Hlillsborough,
where, erecting the roval standard, he issued his proclamation, inviting the loyalists to join him. Many accepted his invitation. At the same time he despatched Tarleton, with four hundred and fifty men, to secure the countenance of a body of loyalists, collected between the
HIawe and Deep rivers.
LXV. Apprehensive of Tarleton's success, Ge  
Greene, on the:18th of February, re-crossed the Dt
1 rinto Carolina, and despatched Generals Pickens and Lee
to watch the movements of the enemy. These officers
were unable to bring Tarleton to an engagement. Gen.
Greene, having now received a reinforcement, making
his army four thousand five hundred strong, concentrated
his forces, and directed his march towards Guilford'CourtHouse, whither Lord Cornwallis had retired.
Here, on the 8th of March, a general engagement took
place, in which victory, after alternately passing to the
banners of each army, finally decided in favoutr of the
British.
The British loss, in this battle, exceeded five hundred in
killed and wounded, among whom were several of the most
distinguished officers.  The American loss was about four
hundred, in killed and wounded, of which more than three
fourths fell upon the continentals. Thouigh the numerical
force of General Greene nearly doubled that of Cornwallis,
yet, when we consider the difference betveen these forces, thi
shameful conducet of the North Carolina mnilitia, who fled at the
first fire, the desertion of the second Maryland regiment, and
that a body of reserve was not brought in.to action, it wvill appear that our numbers actually engaged, but little exceeded
that of the enemy.
LXVI. Notwithstanding the issue of the above battle
Gen. Greene took the bold resolution of leading back his
forces to South Carolina, and of attacking the enemies'
strong post at Camden, in that State. Accordingly, on
the 9th of April, he put his troops in motion, and on the
20th, encamped at Logtown, within sight of the enemies'
works. Lord Rawdon, at this time, held the command
of Camden, and had a force of only nine hundred men.
The army of Gen. Greene-a detachment having been
made for another expedition under Gen. Lee-amounted
scarcely to twelve hundred men of all classes.
On the 25th, Lord Rawdon drew out his forces, and
tne two armies engaged. For a season, victory seemed
inclined to the Americans, but, in the issue, Gen. Greene
found himself obliged to retreat.
The American loss in killed, wounded, and missing, was
two hundred and six.ty-eight; the English loss was nearly equal.the failure of the victory in this battle, was not attributable,
as in some cases, to the flight of the militia, when danger had
scarcely begun-but Gen. Greene experienced the mortifica-,ionr of seeing a regiment of veterans give way to an inferiour
torce, when every circumnstance was in their favour-the very.egiment too, which, at the battle of the Cowpens, behaved
with such heroick bravery.
LXVII. Although the British arms gained the victory
of Camden the result of the whole was favourable to the
American cause. Gen. Lee with a detachment despatched for that purpose, while Greene was marching against
Camden, took possession of an important post at Mottes,
near the confluence of the Congaree and Santee rivers.
This auspicious event was followed by the evacuation of
Camden, by Lord Rawdon, and of the whole line of
British posts, with the exception of Niiety-Six and
Charleston.
LXVIII. Ninety-Six, one hundred and forty-seven miles
north-west from Charleston, was garrisoned by five hundred and sixty men.' Against this post, after the uattle
of Camden, Gen. Greene took up his march, and, mi the
22d of May, sat'down before it. Soon after the siege of
it had been commenced, intelligence arrived that Lord
Rawdon had been reinforced by troops from Irteland? and
was on his march with two thousand men for its relief.
Greene now deterinised upon an assauIlt, but in this tie
failed., with a loss of one hundred and fifty men.
Soon after his arrival at Ninety-Six, Lord Rawdon deemed it expedient to evacuate this post. Retiring himself
to Charleston, his army encamped at the Eutaw Springs,
forty miles from Charleston.
LXIXN. Gen. Greene, having retired to the liglh hills ot
Santee, to spend the hot and sickly season, in Septembert
approached the enemy at the Eutaw Springs. On the
morning of the 8th, he advanced upon him, and the battie
between the two armies became general.  The contest
was sustained with equal bravery on both sides-victor1y
neeming to decide in favour of neither.
The British lost in killed, wounded, and prisoners, about one
17~z  Xo    PERIOD V.... 1775... 1783....REVOLUTI[ONo
thousand one hundred. The loss of the Americans was fve
hundred and fifty-five.
LXX. The battle of the Eutaw Springs was the last
general action that took place in South Carolina, and
nearly finished the war in that quarter. The enemy now
retired to Charleston.
Thus closed the campaign of 1781, in South Carolina. Few
commanders have ever had greater difficulties to encounter
than General Greene; and few have ever, with the saiie
means, accomplished so much. Though never so decisivelyr
victorious, yet the battles which he fought, either from necessity or choice, were always so well managed as to result to his
advantage.
Not unmindful of his eminent services, Congress presented
him with a British stanidard, and a gold medal, emblematical cf
the action at the Eutaw Springs, which restored a sister State
to the American Union.
LXXI. After the battle of Guilford, between Greene;
and Cornwallis, noticed above the latter, leaving South
Carolina in charge of Lord Rawdon, commenced his
march towards Petersburg, in Virginia, where he arrived
on the 20th of May. Having received several reinforcements. he found himself with an army of eight thousand,;
and indulged the pleasing anticipations that Virginia
would soon be made to yield to his arms.
Early in the spring, Gen. Washington had detached
the Marquis de la Fayette, with thr=ee thousand men, to
co-operate with the French fleet, in Virginia, in the capture of Arnold, who was committing depredations in that
State. On the failure of this expedition, La Fayette
marched back as far as the head of Elk river.-Here he
received orders to return to Virginia to oppose the British.
On his return, heari..g of the advance of Cornwallis, towards Petersburg, twenty miles below Richmond, he
hastened his mnarlch to prevent, if possible, the junction
of Cornwallis, with a reinforcement, under Gen. Phillips,
In this, however, he failed.
The junction being effected at Petersburg, Cornwallis
moved towards James' river, which he crossed, with the
aintenaticn of forcing the marquis to a battle.Prudence forbade the marquis risking an engagement,
with an enemy of more than twice his force. He tlherefore retreated, and, notwithstanding the uncommon efforts
of his lordship to prevent it, he effected a junction with
Gen. Wayne, who had been despatchied by Washington,
with eight hundred Pennsylvania militia, to his assistance.
After this reinforcement, the disproportion between himself and his adversary was still too great to permit him to
think of battle. He continued his retreat therefore displaying, in all his manceuvres, the highest prudence.
LXXII. While these things were transpiring in Virginia, matters of high moment seemed to be in agitation
in the north, which, not long afier, were fully developed.
Early in May, 1781, a plan of the whole campaign
had been arranged by Gen. Washington, in consultation
at Wethersfield, Connecticut, with Generals Knox and
Du Portail, on the part of the Americans and Count de
Rochambeau, on the part of France. The grand project
of the season was to lay siege to New-York, in concert
-with a French fleet expected on the coast in August.
In the prosecution of this plan, the French troops were
marched fiom Rhode-Island, anid joined Gen. Washington, whlo had concentrated his forces at Kingsbridge, fifteen miles above New-York. All things were preparing
for a vigorous siege, and, towards thii strongest hold of
the enemy, the eyes of all were intently directed.
In this posture os tlhMrs, letters addressed to Gen.
Washington, informed him that the expected French fleet,
under the Count de Giasse, would soon arrive i,t-4he
Chesapeake, anid that this, instead of NewvYork, was tihe
place of its destination.
Disappointed in not having the co-operation of suchi a
force; disappointed also in not receiving'the full quota of
militia, which had been ordered from New-England and
New-Jersey; and, moreover, learning that Clinton had
been reinforced in TNew-York, by the arrival of thiree
thousand Germans; Washington was induced to culange
the olain of operations, and to direct his attention to
Ii7'sCoriwallis, who, froin pursuing the Marquis de la Fay.
ette, had retired to Yorktown, near the mouth of York
river, and had fortified that place.
LXXIII. saving decided upon this measure, on the
19th of July he drew off his forces, and commenced his
march at the same time strongly impressing Clinton by
every art in his power, that an attack would soon hb made
upon New-York. So successfilly was this deception practised, that Washi'ngton was some distance on his way
towards Virginia, before Clinton sulspected that his object
was arny other thanm to draw him from New-York, to fight
him in the field, with superiour forces.
Having halted at Philadelphia a few days, the army
continued its march to the head of Elk river, whence it
embarked for Williamshurg, then the head quarters of the
Marquis de la Fayette, where it arrived September 25th
Gen. Washington and Count de Rochambeau preceded
the troops ten days, ajnd, to their great joy, found that the
Count de Grasse had entered the Capes on the 30th ol
the preceding month, with twenty-eight sail, and three
thousand troops.
On the arrival of these two generals at Wiiliaiisburg, R

council was held to determnine onT fiture operations.

amounting to twelve thlousand mnen, moved upon Yorktown and Gloucester, Septe mber 30th, and the Count de
Grasse, with his fleet, proceeded up to the mouth of Yorlk
river, to prevent Cornwallis either from retreating, or receiving assistance.
Yorktown is a small village on the south side of York river,
whose southern banks are high, and in whose waters a ship of
the line may ride in safety. Gloucester Point is a piece of land
on the opposite shore, projecting far into the river. Both thlese

on tbn 5th of October, but, for reasons never explained, it did

LXXVI. Nothing could exceed the joy of the Amierican people, at this great and important victory, over
Lord Cornwallis. Exultation broke forth from one ex
tremity of the country to the other. The remembrance
of the past gave place in all minds to the most brilliant
hopes:  It was confidently anticipated, tihat the affair of
Yorktown would rapidly liasten the acknowledgment
of American Independence-an event, for ivhich the peoe
ple had been toiling and bleeding through so mnany cam.,
paigns.
In all parts of thle United States, solemn festivals and rejoic,
ings celebrated the triumph of American fortune. The named
of Washington, Rochambeau, De Grasse, and La Fayette, resounded every where. To the unanimnous acclaim of the people, congress joined the authority of its resolves. It addressed
thanks to tho generals, officers, and soldiers---presented British
colours-ordered the erection of a marble column-and went
in procession to church, to render publick thanklsgiving to God
for the recent victory. The 30th of December was appointed
as a day of national hibanksgiving.
LXXVII. Whlile the combined armies were advancing
to the siege of Yorktown, an excursion was made from
New-York, by Gen. Arnold, against New-London, in his
native state.  The object of this expedition seems to
have been, to draw away a part of the American farses:        PERIOD V....1775....1783....REVOLUTION.  177
Sir Henry Clinton knowing but too well, that if they were
left at liberty to push the siege of Yorktown the block-.
aded army must inevitably surrender.
This expedition was signalized by the greatest atrocities. Fort Trumbull, on the west, and Fort Griswold,
oin the east side of the i-ver Thames, below New-London,
were taken, and the greater part of that town was burnt.
At Fort Trumbull, little or no resistance was made; but
Fort Griswold was defended for a time, with great bravery and:resolution. After the fort was carr ied, a British officer entering, inquired who commanded. Col. Ledyard answered, " I
did, but you do now"-at the same time presenting his sword.
The officer inmmediately plunged the sword into his bosom.
A general massacre now took place, as well of those who surrensdered as of those who resisted, which continued until nearly
all the garrison were either killed or wounded. Sixty dwelling
houses, and eighty-foutr stores in New-London were reduced
to ashes.
LXXVIII. The fall of Cornwallis may be considered
as substantially closing the war. A few posts of importance were still held by the British-New-York, Charleston, and Savannah-but all other parts of the country,
which they had possessed, were recovered into the power
of congress. A few skirmishes alone indicated the continuance of war.
A part of the French army, soon after the capture of
Cornwallis, re-embarked, and Count de Grasse sailed for
the West Indies. Count Rochambeau cantoned his army
for the winter, 1782' in Virginia, and the main body of
the Americans returned, by the way of the Chesapeake,
to their former position on the Hudson.
LXXIX. From the 12th of December, 1781, to the
4th of march, 1782, motion after motion was made in the
*British Parliamtnent for putting an end to the war in America. On this latter day, the commrnons resolved " that the
house would consider as enemies to his mnajesty and to the
country, all those who should advise, or attempt the further prosecution of offensive war, on the continent of
North America.

MYarrage among them was generally a temporary contract.
The men choose their wives agreeable to fancy, and put thens
away at pleasure. Marriage was celebrated, however, with
omle ceremonly, and in many instances was observed with
fidelity: not unfrequently it was as lasting as life. Polyganmy
was common among them.
Their treatumnt of females was cruel and oppressive. They
were conisidered by the men as slaves, and treated as such
Those forms of decoruin between the sexes, which lay the
foundation for the respectful and gallant courtesy, with which
women are treated in ciivilized society, were unknown amongthem. Of course, females were not only required to perform
severe labour, but often felt the full weight of the passionls and
caprices of the men.
T'he rites of burial among the Indians, varied but little throughout the continent. They generally dug holes in the ground,
with sharpened stakes. In the bottom of the grave were laid
sticks, upon which the corpse, wrapped in skins and mats, was
deposited.  The arms, utensils, paints, and ornaments of the
deceased were buried with him, and a miound of earth raised
over his grave.  Among some tribes in New-England, and
among the Five Nations, the dead were buried in a sitting posture, wvith their faces towards the east. During the burial they
uttered the most lamentable cries, and continued their mournian for several days.
The origin of the Indians, inhabitin- the country, on the arrival of the English colonists, is involved in much obscurity,
and several different answers hlave been given by lenied mene
to the inquiry, whence did they come to America? The opinion best supported is, that they originated in Asia, and that at
somne ifortier period, not now to be ascertained, they emigrated
from that country to America, over which, in succeeding years,
their descendants spread. This opinion is rendered the more
probable by the fact, that the figure, complexion, dress, manners, customs, &amp;c. &amp;c. of the nations of both continents are
strik ingly similar. That they migtlt have emigrated from the
eastern continent is evident, since the distance betwen the Easi
(,ape of Asia, and Cape Prince of Wales in America, across
the streights of Bhering, is only about forty miles, a much
shorter distance than savages frequently sail in their caneo

In accordance with these instructions, Sir Guy Carleton
endeavoured to openi a correspondence vwith congress, and
withi this view sent to Gen. Washiington to solicit a passo

of the surrender of Cornwalis, pressed upon congress the

These commissioners met Mr. Fitzherbert and Mr. Oswald, on the part of Great Britain, at PIaris, and pr6visional articles of peace between the two countries were

signed on the 30th of September, 1783,
Altlhough the definitive treaty was not signed until Septenmber, there had been no act of hostility between the
two armies, and a state of peace had actually existed from
the commencement of the year 1783. A formal procla.

the following mnontlh.
LXXXII. The tlird of November was fixed upon by
congress, for disbanding the army of the United States
On the day previous, Washington issued his farewell orders, and bid an affectionate adieu to the soldiers, wht
had foughlt and bled by his side.,
After mentioning ttie trying times thlrouglh whiclh hle had

glorious prospects opening before them, and their countryand then bade them adien in the following words: "Being now

armries.
"May ampl.e justice be done them here, and may the choicest

With thlese wishes, and this benediction, the commander in
chief is about to retire from service. The cutrtain of separation will soonl be drawn, and t!he military scene to himl will
be closed for ever."
LXXXIII. Soon after taking leave of the army, Gen.
Washington was called to the still more painful hour of
separation from his ofifcers, greatly endeared to him by
a long series of common sufferings and dangers.
The officers having previousfy assembled in iNew-York for
the purpose, Gen. Washington now joined them, and calling
for a glass of wine, thus addressed them: "With a heart full
of love and gratitude, I now take my leave of you. I most devoutly wish that your latter days may be as prosperous and
happy, as your former ones have been glorious and honourable."
Having thus affectionately addressed them, he now took
each by the hand and bade him farewell. Followed by them
to the side of the H-udson, he entered a barge, and, while tears
rolled down his cheeks, he turned towards the companions of
his glory, and bade themn a silent adieu.
LXXXIV. December 23, Washington appeared in

After having spoken of the accomplishment of his wishes
and exertions, in the independence of hIis country, and commnended his officers and soldiers to Congress, he concluded as
tollows:
"I consider it ani indispensable duty to close the last solemn
act of my official life, by commending the interests of our dearest country to the protection of Almighty God, and those who

through their president, expressed in glowing language to
WVashington, their high sense of his wisdom and energy,
in oonducting the war to so happy a termination, and in
voked the choicest blessings upon his future life.
President Mifflin concluded as follows: " We join you in

and minds of its citizens to iinprove the opportunity affordec
them of becoming a happy and respectable nation. And for

loved, may be fostered with all His care; that your days miay
be as happy as they have been illustrious; and that HIE wit]
finally give you that seward which this world cannot give."
A profound silence now pervaded the assembly. The
grandeur of the scene, the recollection of the past,
the felicity of the present, and the hopes of the future,
crowded fast upon all, while they united in invoking
blessings upon the man, who, under God, had achieved so
much, and who now, in the character of a mere citizen,
was hastening to a long desired repose at his seat, at
Mount Vernon, in Virginia.
LXXXVI.       -  s- r r. At thle commen ement of
the revolution, the colonists of Amnerica were a mass of
husbandmen, nierchants, mechanicks, and fishermen, who
were occupied in the ordinary avocations of their respective callings, and were entitled to the appellation of a so,
ber, honest, and industrious set of people. Being, how
ever, under the control of a country, whose jealousies
were early and strongly enlisted against them, and which,
ierefore, was eager to repress every attempt, on teir
)art, to rise, they had comparatively little scope or en
t~raement, for exertion and enterpreBut whlen the struggle for independence began, the
case was altered.  New'fields for exertion were opened,
and new and still stronger impulses actuated their bosomls.
A great change was suddclenly wrought in the American
people, and a vast expansiont of character took place.
Tihose who were bef)re only known in the humble
sphere of peacefiul occupation, soon shone forth in the
cabinet or in the field, fully qualified to cope with the
trained generals and statesmnen of Europe.
But although the revolution caused such an expansion
of character in the American people, and called forth the
mnost striking patriotism among all classes, it introduced,
at the samie timne, greater looseness of manners and morals. An armv always carries deep vices in its train and
communicates its corruption to society around it. Besides this, the failure of publick credit so far put it out of
the power of individuals to perform private engagements,
that the breach of them became common, and, at length,
was scarcely disgraceful. That high sense of integrity,
which hlad extensively existed before, was thus exchanged
for more loose and slippery notions of hionesty and honour.
On the whole," says D)r. Ramsay, who wrote soon after the
close of this period, "the literary, political, and military talents
of the United States have been improved by the revolution, but
their ewral character is iniferiour to what it formerly was. So
great is the change for the worse," continues he, " that the
friends of publickl order are loudly called upon to exert their
utmost abilities, in extirpating the vicious principles and habits,
which have taken deep root during the late convulsions."
LXXXVII.;t't.,p        During the revolution, the
colonies being all united in one cause-a congress being
assembled from all parts of America-and more frequent
intercourse between different parts of the country being
promoted byl thie shifting of the armies-local prejudices
and sectarian asperities were obliterated; religious controversy was suspended; and bigotry softened. That
spirit f rintolerance which had marked some portions of
the country, was nearly done away.
But for these advantages, the revolution brought with it
16
PERIOD V....17,76._V733.... EILEVOLUTION.great disadvantages to religion in general.  The atheis.
tical philosophy, whichi lad been spread over France, and
which would involve the whole subject of religion in the
gloomy mists of skepticism-which ack,iowledges no distinction between right and wrong, and considers a future
existence as a dream, that may or may niot be realizedvas thickly sown in the American army, by the French;
and, uniting with the infidelity, which before had taken
root in the country, produced a serious declension in the
tone of religious feelings, among the American people.
In addition to this, religious institutions during the war, were
much neglected; churchies wvere denmolished, or converted into
barracks; publick worship was often suspenrded; and the clergv suflered severely, from the seduction of their salaries, caused
by the depreciation of the circulating mediurAm.
LXXXVIII.      9raZ? at i       a     git.    During
the war of the revolutio-n, the commerce of the United
States was interrupted, not only with Great Britain, but,
in a great mneasure, with the rest of the world.  The greater part of the shipping, belonging to the countryv was destroyed by the enemy, or perished by a natural process of
decay.
Our coasts were so lined with British cruisers, as to render
navigation too hazardous to'be pursued to any considerable extent. Some privateers, however, were fitted out, which succeeded in capturing several valuable prizes, on board of which
were arms, and other munitions of war. During the last three
years of the war, an illicit trade to Spanish America was carried on, but it was extremnely limnited.
LXXXIX. ag0       ttVjttc. Agriculture was greatly
interrupted during this period, by the withdrawing of labourers to the camp-by the want of encouragement furnished by exportation, aiid by the distractions which disturbed all the occupations of society.
The army often suffered for the means of subsistence, and
the officers were sometimes forced to compel the inhabitants to
furnish the soldiers food, in sufficient quantities to prevent their
suffering.
XC.   att'     aul   aqanufaCtuj:rg.       The trade
with Eagland, during this period, being interrupted by the
wa;j tl* people of the United States were compelled temnanufacture for themselves. Encouragemeint was given
to all necessary manufactures, and the zeal, ingenuity, and
industry of the people, furnished thle country with articles
of prime necessity, and, in a measure, supplied the place
of a foreign market. Such was the progress in arts and
manufactures, during the period, that, after the return of
peace, when an uninterrupted intercourse with England
was again opened., some articles, which before were imported altogether, were found so well, and so abundaiitly
manufactured at home, that their impor thtion was stopped.
XCI. VO Ptglti~.      The increase of the people of
the United States, durinrg this period, was small. Few,
if any, emigrants arrived in the country. Mlany of the
inhabitants were slain in battle, and thousands of that
class called tories, left thie land, who never returned.
Perhaps we may fairly estimate the inhabitants of the
country, about the close of this period, 1784, at three
millions two hundred and fifty thousand.
XCII.!lt!;atitag.  The interests of education suffered in common with other kindred interests, during the
war. In several colleges, the course of instruction was,
for a season, suspended; the hall was exchanged by the
students for the camp, and the gown for the sword and
epaulette.
Towards the conclusion of the war, two colleges were founded-one in Maryland, in 1782, by the narme of Washington
college; the other in 1783, in Pennsylvania, which received
the name of Dickinson college. The writer'whom we have
quoted above, estimiates the whole number of c6lleges and
academies in the United States, at the close of this period, at
thiirty-six.
XCIII. The American revolution is doubtless the most interesting event in the pages of modern history.  Changes
equally great, and convulsions equally violent, have often taken
place; and the history of man tells us of mnany instances, in
which oppression, urged beyoindl endurance, has called forth
the spirit of successfUl and trliumrphant resistance. Bnt, in the
P E.'irt I 0 D V.... I 7'i''C",.... 1763.... REVOLUTION.event before us, we see fqeble colonies, with-out an army-with
out a navy-without an[ estahlished government-without a
revenue-without munulitiorns of wasr--without fortiifications,
boldly stepping forth tc) meet the veteranr arrmies of a proud,
powverful, and vindictive enemry.  We see tihese colonies amidst
want, poverty, and misfortiune--supported by the pervading
spirit of liberty. and guided by the good hliand of ilteaven--for
nearly eight years sustainirn the weight of a csuel conflict
upon their own soil. WAVe see themn at lenisgth victorious; their
enemies sullenily retire from tlicir shores, and the,se humble
colonies stan.d forth enrolled on tihe page of history-a free
sovereign, and indepenident nation. Nort is thic all. We see
a wise governmenert springing up from the blood that was spilt
and, down to our owni time, shedding the choicest political
ulessings upon several mililions of people!
Whlat nation can dwell with more just satisfaction upon its
annals, than ours? Almost all others trace their foundation to
some ambitious and bloody conquerer, who sought only, by enslaving otl-hers, to aggrandize himself. Our independence was
wonby the people, whvo fought for the natural rights of man.
Other niations have left their annals stained with the crimes of
their people and princes; ours shines with the glowving traces
of patriotism, constancy and courage, amidst every rank of
life, and every grade of office.
Whenever we advert to this portion of our history, and review it, as we well mnay withi patriotick interest, let us not forget the gratitude we owe, as well to those who " fought, and
bled, and died" for us, as that benignant Providence, who
stayed the proud waves of British tyranny.
Let us also gathier political wisdonl friom thlie American revohition. It has tanug-lit the world, emphatically, that oppression
tends to weaken anid diestroy the power of the oppressor; that
a people united in the causeof liberty are invincible by those
who would enslave them; and that (leacGven will ever frownv

every possible blessing.  A short time was suffieeint, how
ever, to demonstrate that somnething, not yet possessed, was
necessary to realize the private and publick prosperity thai
had been anlticipated.  After a shlort struggle so to administer the existing system of government, as to make it coinpetent to the great objects for which it was insfituted, it
became apparent that somie other svsten must be substi.
tuted, or a general wrecik of all that had been gained would
ellsue.
It. At the close:i,Q the war, the debts* of the Union
were: Computed to aioliunt to soxnfewhat more that forty millions;of dollars.  ByV' the:l ilticles of confederation and
union betweein the S:tates, congress had the power to dec3are war, and borrow moneey, or issue bills of credit to
carry it on; but it had hot the ability to disclarge debts
incurred by the'war.- All that congress could do. was to
recommend to the individuall   States to raise morey tor
that purpose.'Soon after the war, the attention of congress was drawin
to this subject; the payment of the natiomial debt being a
mnatter of justice to crecditors, as well as of vital importance
to the preservation of the UJion. "'It was proposed, therefore,'by congress, to the States, that they should grant to
that body the power of ayinl a CLduty of five per cent. on
all bforeign goods, which' shtiedl be. inmported, and that the
revenue arising thence sIoUt d be appiied to the dimninution
o1 the. publick debt, until it was extinguished.
To this proposal, most of the States assented, and passed an act, granting the power. But Rhode-Island, apprehlensive that suclh at Or.lt would lessen the advantages of
* These debts were of twvo kinds, foreign and domestick. The
foreign debt amounted to near eight millions of d(ollars, and was
due to individuals in France-to the crown of France-to lenders
in Holland and S)ain. The dotmestick debt amounted to some
mnore than thirty-four millions oft dollars, and was due to persons
who held IQan office certificates-to the officers and soldiers of the
vevolutionary arim.y, &amp;C,.              THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION.              187
her trade declined passing an act for that purpose. Subsequently, New-York joined in the onposition, and rendered all prospect of raising a revernue ir. this way, hopeless.
Thle consequence was, that even the interest of the publick debt remained unpaid. Certificates of publick debt
lost their credit, and many of the officers and soldiers of
the late army, who were poor, were compelled to sell these
certificates at excessive reductions.
Ill. While the friends of the national government were
making unavailing eflobrts to fix upon a permanent revenue,
which might enable it to preserve the national faith, other
causes, besides the loss of confidence' in the confederation
concurred to hasten a radical chantge in the political systemn
of the United States.
Among these causes, the principal was the evil resulting from the restrictions of Great Britain, laid on the trade
of the United States with the West Indies; the ports of
those islands being shut against the vessels of the United
States, and enormous duties inposed on our most valuable
exports.
Hlad congress possessed the power, a remedy might have
been fiund, in passing similar acts against Great Britain;
bbut this power had not been delegated by the States to the
congress. That thirteen indepen-dent sovereignties, always jealous of one another, would separately concur in
any proper measures to com pel Great Britain to relax was
not to be expectedt. The imnportance of an enlargement of
the powers of congress was thus rendered still more obvious.
IV. During this enfeebled and disorganized state of tie
general government, attempts were made, in some of the
states, to mnaintain their credit, and to satisfy their creditors.
The attempt of lassacithusetts to effect this, by means of
a heavy tax, produced an open insurrection among the
people. In some parts of the State, the people convened
in tumultuous assemrnblies- obstructed the sitting of courts,
and, finally, took arms in opposition to the lawvs ef thetth 4t iln

In the story of Columbus, we are introduced to a manof genius, energy, and enterprise. We see himn forming a new, and
in that age, a mighty project; and having matured his plan, we
see him set himself vigorously about its execution. For a time,
he is either treated as a visionary, or baffled by opposition.
But, neither discouraged nor deicted, he steadily pursues his
urpose, surmounts every obstacle, and at length spreads his
sails upon the lunknown waters of the Atlantic. A kind Providence auspiciously guides his way, and crowns his enterprise
with the unexpected discovery of a new world.
While we admire the lofty qualities of Columbus, and look
with wonder at the consequences which have resulted from his
discovery, let us emulate his decision, energy, and perseveranlce. Many are the occasions on which it will be important
to summon these to our aid; and by their nmeans, many useful
objects may be acoimplihed, which without theni, would be
unattained.
But, while we thus press forward in the career of usefulness
-while we aim to accomplish for our fellow men all the amount
of good in our power, let us moderate our expectations of reward here, by the consideration that Columbus died thle victimn
of ingratitude and disappointment.
Arnother consideration of still deeo r interest, is sugested
ty the story of Columbus. In his first voyage, he contel-nplated chiefly the discovery of a passare to India. We who
live to mark thle wonderful events which have flowed from his
discoveryv, within the short space of two centuries, cannot but
advert with awe to'it,- who attaches to toe actions of a single
individual, a train of consequences so Stupendous and unexpcte!ed. How lightly soever, then, we may think of our conduct, let us remenmber that the ivisible hiand of Providence
mnay be conjecturing' with our smallest actiorns the  iost momentous results, to ourselves and others.
With respect to Amerious Yespicus, it may be observed,
3that although he deprived Columbus of the merited honour of
giving his narne to the new world, and gained this distinction for;himself-still his name wilH ever remain stigmatized as having
appropriated tha-t to hancel f which fairly belonged to another,

revolutionary stirug~,le should be realized or lost.
In Janua'ry, 1786, t1he legislature'of Virginiia adopted a
resolution to appoiot cosmauisasoners, who were to uiLet
suchb others, as. ight be appointed by the other States, to
tak,e inlflo consideration the suib ject of tlrade, and to provide
f~or a untiform system  of commrercial relations, &amp;c.  Th-is
resolution, ultimately, led to a proposition for a genierall
convention to consider th-e state of the union.
Rut five States were represented in. the COnVentionl, proposed by Viroginin, w,hich m'et at Annapolis. In consideration of the smiall nutmber of States represented, the conivention, without coniniig to any specific resoluitjion on the
plati1-cular subjects referred to them, adjourned to meet in
Philadelphiia, the succeedin-g I'May. Previouisly to adj.1ournmrent, it recomnmended to, thie several States, to appoint
dtelegates for.that m-eeting, and to give thbem vowver to revietk fiederal syjstoz.~Agreeably to the above recommecndation, all the 5tates of
thlle Union, exceptingf.Rhode-Island, appointed cormissioners, who on the 19thl of May, assembled at PhiladelOf this body, Gen. Wrashington, one of the commissioners from  Virginia, was unalnimously elected president.
The convention proceeded, with closed doors, to discuss
the interesting subject submitted to their consideration.
VI. On the great principles which should form    the
basis of the constitution, not mnuch difference of opinionll
prevailed. But, in reducing tlhose principles to practical
details, less harmony was to be expected.  Such, indeed,
was the difference of cpinion, that, more than once, there
was reason to fear, tlhat the convention would rise, without
effecting the object for which it wvas formed. Happily,
however, it was at length agreed to sacrifice local interest
onl thle altar of publick good, and on the 17th of September,
178Z7, the FEDERAL CONSTITUTION was presented to congress wvho, shortly after, secnt it to the several States for
their consideration.
An abstract of this constitution, with its several subseqient
amendments, follows: it is extracted from Mr. Websters Ele.nients of Useful Knowledge.
Of the Legislatsure. " The legislative power of the United
States is vested in a congress, consisting of two houses or
branches, a senate, and a house of represenitatives. The members of the hlouse of representatives are chosen once in two
years, by the persons who are cualified to vote for members
of the most numerous branches of the legislature, in each State.
To be entitled to a seat in this house, a person must have attained to the age oi` twenty-five years, been a citizen of the
United.States for seven years, and be an inhabitant of the state
in which he is chosen.
Ofthe Senate. "' The senate consists of two senators from
each State, chosen by the legislature for six years. The senate
is divided into three classes, the seats of one of which are vacated every second year. If a vacancy happens during the
recess of the legislature, the executive of the state makes a
temporary appointment of a senator, until the next meeting of
the legislature. A senator must have attained to the age of
thirty years, been a citizen of the United States nine year,
axld be an inhabitant of the State for which he is chosen.
1 8 9/Of the powers of the twvo IHouses. " The house of representatives choose their owvn speaker and other officers, and have
the exclusive powver of impeaching public officers, and originating hills for raising a revenue. The vice-president of the
United States is president of the senate; but the other officers
are chosen by the senate. The senate tries all impeachments-;
each house determinet the validity of the elections and qualification of its own members, forms its own rules, and keeps a
journal of its proceedings. The members are privileged from
arrest, while attending on- the session, going to, or returning
from the same, except for treason, felony, or breach of the
peace.
Of the powers of Cong-ess. " The Congress of the United
States have power to make and enforce all laws, which are
necessary for the general welfare-as to lay and collect taxes,
imposts, and excises; horrsow money, regulate commerce, establish uniform rules of naturalization, coin money, establish post
roads and pest offices promote the arts and sciences, institute
tribunals inferioiir to trihe supreme court, define and puislih
piracy, declare war, anid make reprisals raise and support arnuies, provide a navy, re-t.late the militia, and to make all laws
necessary to carry these powers irto efect.
Of Resftrictions.  "No bill of attainder, oi retrospective law,
shall be passed; the vwrit os lhabeas corpus cannot be suspenrided, except in cases of rbel]eion or invasion  no disect tax can
be laid, except accorditg- to a census of thle inhabitants; no
duty can be laid on exports, no mnoney can be drawn from the
treasury, uniless appropriated by la-;,;no title of nobility can
be granted, nso can any publick officer, without the consent of
congress, accept of assy present or title from any foreign prince
or state. Tle States are restrained fromn emitting bills of credit, from mnaking ary thisno  but gold or silver a tender for
debts, and from passio~ aIy b.w  impairunr private contracts.
Of the EXecutive.  T he executisve power of the Unsited
States is vested in a _president, who holds his office for four
years. To qualify a ran for president, he mnust have been a
citizen at the adomtion of the colO,sOit0ll.lon or tonost be a native
of the United States; he mnut }lave attained to the age of thity-five years, ad Oecn /urteen years a iesident w.ithins thli
United States. The pr,mesident and vice- resident are chosen
by electors desgnat-ed in such a manner as tise legislature ot
eabch State shall direct.  The number'of electors in each
State is equal to the wvhole rsnnber of senators and representatives.
Of the powers of thc Premident. c The president of tihe United
J`a.tes is coans,iLnder it chin'f b  lthi ai- mz ny and navy,y anid of tIi.            THE'EDERAL CONSTITUION~                   191

anibassadors, jusdges, and other officers; and with the advice
and consent of the senate, fczmns treaties, provided two thirds

durinlg the recess of the senate. He convenes the congress on
extraordinaiy occasions, receive3 foreign ministers, gives information to congress of the st6ite of publick affairs, and in general, takes care fltat the laws be faithfully execuLted.
Of the Judiiay. "The Judiciary of the United States consists of one supreme court, and such -inferiour courts as the,-ongress shall ordain. The juilges a.re to hold their offices durins good behaviour, and their s \laries cannot be diminished
during their continuance in office. The judicial power of these
coutrts extend to all cases in law aIm: equity, arising under the
constitution, or laws of the United S ates, anld under treaties;
to cases of publick miinisters and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to eantroversies between the
States, and in which the United States qre a party; between
citizens of difiorent States; between a't.ate and a citizen of
aniother State, aind between citizens of tl, samne State, claimin- under gyants of diffterent States; and;o cautses between
one of the States or an Amnerican citizen, a&lt;fd a ibreign State
or citizen.
Of Rights and imu~nities.'s  i aill crimin-- trials, except
impeachment, the trial by jury is guaranteed'o the accused.
Treason is restricted to the simple acts of levyi,g w,i  against
the United States, and adlhering to their enemies, 7iving them
aid and comfort; and no person can be convicted bu, -by two
wi1tnesses to the saine act, or by confession in open cort. A
conviction of treason is not followved by a corruption ot blood,
to disinherit the heirs of the criminal, nor by a forfeitare of
estate, except during the life of the offender. The citizmns of
each State are entitled to all privileges and immunities o citizens in the several States.  Congress may admit new States
into the union, and the national compact guarantees to each
State a republican form of government, together with protection from foreign invasion and domesticlk violence."
VII. By a resolution of the convention, it was recommended that assemblies shoutld be called, in the different
States, to discuss the mnerits of the constitution, aniid either
accept or reject it; and, that as soon as nine States should
have ratified it, it should be carried into operation by congress.To decide the interesting question, respecting the adoption or rejection of the new- constitution, the best talents of
the several States were assembled in their respective con.
ventions.  The fate of the constitution could; for a time be
scarcely conjectured, so equally were the parties balanced.
But, at length, the conventions of eleven States assented to,
and ratified the constitution.
N orth Carolina and Rhode-Island refutsed their assent at this
time, but afterwards acceded to it: thle former, November,
1789; the latter, lMay, 1790.
VIII. Frorm the m oment it was settled that this new arrangemenit in their political system  was to take place, the
attention of all classes of people, as well anti-federalists as
federalists, (for by these names the parties for and against
the new constitutLion were called,) was directed to General Washington, as the first presidentt of the United States.
Accordingly, on the opening of the votes for President, at
New-York, March 3d, 1789, by delegates from eleven
States, it was found that he was unanimously elected to that
office and that John Adams was elected vice-president.

IX.    Uagniti'r.  Thie war of the revolution, as was
observed in our rnotes on the last period, seriously affected
the morals and manners of the people of the United States
The peace of 1783, however, tended, in a measure, to restore things to their former state. Those sober habits, for
which the country was previously distinguished, began to
return; business assumed a more regular and equitable
character; the tumultuous passions, roused by thle war,
subsided; and men of wisdom and worth began to.acquire
their proper influence.
The change wrought in the manners of the people, during the
revolution, began in this period to appear. National peculiarities wore away still more; local prejudices were further
corrected, and a greater assimilation ot the yet discordantn mterials, of whichi the population of the United States was composed, took place.
X.    diCUigO0l. M3ethodisrn was introduced into the
United States, during thiis period, under the direction of
John Wesley, in England.  This denomination increased
rapidly in the Middle States, and, in 1789, they amounted
to about fifty thousand.
During this period, also, thie iafidelity, which we have noticed,
seems tof have lost ground. Publick worship was more punctually attended, than during the war, and the cause of religion
began-again to flourish.
XI. grtttt    it~ C01t              The commerce of
the United States, during the war of the revolutioin, as already stated, was nearly (lestroyed; but, on thle return of
peace, it revived. AAn excessive importation of goods im-n
mediately took place from England. In 1784, the imports,
from England alone, amounted to eighteen miillions of dollars, and in 1785, t(o twvelve millions-nmaking, in those
two years, thirty mrillionls of dollars, whlile the exports of
the United States to England were only between eight andc
nine millions.
On thle averacge of six years posterior to tile war, the extent
of this period, the iminports from Great Britain into the United
States, were two millions, one hundred and nincteen thousand,
eight hundred and thirty-seven pounds sterling; the exports
nine hundred and eight thousand, six hundred and thirty-six
pounds sterling, leaving an annual balance of five millions,
three hundred and twenty-nine thousand, two hundred and
eighty-four dollars in favour of Great Britain.
The commercial intercourse of the United States with other
countries was less extensive than with England, yet it was not
rnconsiderable.  From France and her dependencies, the
United States imported, in 1787, to the amount of about two
nillions, five hundred thousand dollars, and exported to the
tame, to the value of five millions of dollars.
The trade of the United States with China commenced soon,ffter the close of the revolutionary war. The first American
vessel that went on a trading voyage to China, sailed from
New-York, on the 22d of February, 1784, and returned on the
11th of May, 1785. In 17839, there were fifteen American vessels at Canton, being a greater number than from any other
nation, except Great Britain..Dp,1g'tbis Ieriod, alo, the Americtns c,omrrenc.d the long

and hazardous trading voyages to the North West Coast of
America. The first of the kind, undertaken from the United
States, was fromn Boston, in 1788, in a ship commanded by
Capt. Kenidrick. The trade afforded great profits at first, and,
since 1788, ha[; been carried on from the United States to a
considerable extent.
The whale fishery, wvhich, during the war was suspended,
revived on the return of peace. From 1787 to i189, bothl inelusive, ninet)-one vessels wvere emiployed firom the United
States, with one thousand six hundred and eleven seamien,
Nearly eight thiousa.nd barrels of spermaceti oil were annually
taken, and abo thi'~-teen thousan.( barrels ofvw'hale oil.
Small quati'ties of cotton were first exported from the United
States about the year 1784. It wias raised in Georogia.
Xli. fQ&lt;Ci-"it'W. A.'riculture revived at the close
of the vwar. and il a few y7ears, the exports of produce
raised in tne United Stkates were again considerable. Attention began to be paid to the culture of cotton, in the
southern Stat es about the year 1788, and it soon became
a staple of that part of tihe country. Aboutt thle same
time, agricultural societies began to be formned in -ihe
country.

had been extensively begun, during the war of the' revolu,tion. Iron works, however, for thile construction of axes,
ironing of carriages, and the making of machinery, &amp;c,.
&amp;c. were still kept up in all parts of thlle Unitiied StatesO
Some coarse woollen and linen cloths, cabinet furniture,
and the more bulky and simple utensils for domestick Use,
&amp;c. &amp;c. were manufactured in New-England.
XIV.?    Ja.t i.t0,  The population of the United
States, at the close of this period, was nearly four mrrillions.
XV. #';g~ff4    f    Several colleges were established,
during this period-cone in lanryland, at Annapolis, called
St. Johin's college; a second, in 1785, at Abington, in the
same state by the Methlodists, called Cokesbury college;
a third, in the city of New, fYork, and a fourth, in Laneaster. Pennsylvania, in  7827The former, by t he. nanof Columbia college, and the latter, by that of Franklin
college. The North Carolina university was incorporated
in 1789.
The subject of education, during this period, seems to:have attracted publick attention throughout the United
States, and permanent institutions, for the instruction of
youth, were eithler planned or established, in every section
of the country.
XVI. The history of the world famrnishles no parallel to the
hlistory of the United States during this short period. At the
commencement of it, they had but just eme-ged from a long
and distressing war, which had nearly exhausted the country,
and imposed an accumulated debt upon the nation. They were
united by a confederation inadequate to the purposes of governaient; they had just disbanded an army which was unpaid,
and dissatisfied, and more thlan all, they were untried in the art
of self-government.
In circumstances like these, it would not have been strange
had the people fallen into'dissensions and anarchy, or hlad some
bold, ambitious spirit arisen and fastened the yoke of monarchy upon them. But a happier destiny awaited them. ln this
hour of peril, the same Providence, that had guided them thus
far, still watched over them, and, as victory was granted them
in the hour of battle, so wisdom was now vouchsafed in a day
of peace.  Those master spirits of the revolution, some of
whom had recently retired from the camp to the enjoyment
of civil life, were now called to devise the means of securing
the maependence whlich they had wonl. Perhaps they exhibited to the world a no less striking spectacle as the framers of
our excellent constitution, than as victors over the am  of
Briain.

DISTINGUISHED BY WASHINGTON S ADMINISTRATION.
George Washington.
Extending from the inauguration of President Wasa
ington, 1789, to the inauguration of John Adams, as
president of the United States, 17 97.
Section I. On the s30th of April, 1789, Gen. Washington, in thie presence of the first congress, under the
Federal Constitution, and before an immense concourse of
spectators, was induceted into the office of President of the
United States, by taking thle oathi prescibed by thie constitution.i           WASHINGTON'S ADMINISTIRATItPI.            197'
Intelligence of his election was communicated to Washington, while on hisfarm in Virginia. On his way to New-York,
to enter upon the duties of his station, he received, in almost
every place through which he passed, the highest expressions
of affection and respect, that a grateful people could pay.
Soon after his arrival in New-York, a day was assigned for
his taking the oath of office. On the morning of that day,
publick prayers were offered in all the churches. At noon, a
procession was formed, which escorted Washington, dressed on
the occasion wholly in American manufactures, to FederalHall. HIere the oath prescribed by the constitution was administered to himn by the chancel  of the State of New-York.
The ceremonies of the inauguration being concluded, Washington entered the senate chamber, and delivered his first
speech. In this, after expressing the reluctance with which
he obeyed the call of his countrymen, fronm repose and retirement, so ardently coveted, after a series of military toils, and
the diffidence with which he entered upen an office so filll of
responsibility, he proceeded thus:
" It will be peculiarly improper to omit, in this first official
act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being wh(o rules
uver the universe--ho presides sm the councils of nations,9
&amp;c. Thus did Washington, in the commencemnent of his administration, publicl y appear on the side of relig,n; nor was
he asharned to acknowledge, before the nation, his sense of dependence upon God for wisdom and direction.
II. Business of importance, in relation to the organization and support of lthe new government now pressed
upon the attention of tbe president, and of congress. A
revenue was to be provided; the departmlents of governnent were to be arranged and illed; a judiciary was to
be established, and its officers appointed; and provision
w'as to be made for the support of piblick credit.
After a long discussion, congress agreed to raise a revenue for the support of government, by imnpost and toninage duties.  Having next fixed upon, and arranged the
&gt;several departments of the governmernt, the presideit,
whose duty it was, proceeded to nominate the proper per.
sons to fiHl themn.  In performing this service, he appears
to have been actuated, simply, by a regard to the best
good of the country.

ral. At the head of the judiciary was placed John Jay, and
with him were appointed John Rutledge, James Wilson, William Cushing, Robert Harrison, and John Blair.
During this session of congress, several new articles
were proposed to be added to the constitution, by way of
amendment, and to be submitted to the several States for
their approbation.
After a long and alnipated discussion of the subject.
twelve new articles were agreed upon, which, when submitted to the respective State legislatures, were approved
by three-fourths of them, and were thus added-to the constitution.
Congress adjourned on the 29th of September. It was
among their concluding acts, to direct the secretary of
the treasury to prepare a plan for adequately providing
for the support of the publick credit, and tb report the same
at their next meeting.
IIT. During the recess of congress, Washlington made
a tour into New-England.  Passing through Connecticut
and Massachusetts, and into New-Hampshire, as far as
Portsmouth, he returned by a different route to New
York.
With this excursion the president had much reason to be
gratified. To observe the progress of society, the improvements in agriculture, commerce, and manufactures, and the
temper, circumstances, and dispositions of the people-while
it could not fail to please an intelligent and benevolent mind,
was, in all respects, worthy of the chief magistrate of the nation
lIe was every where received with expressions of the purest
affection, and could not fail to rejoice in the virtue, religion,
happiness, and prosperity of the people, at the head of whose
government he was placed.
IV. The second session of the first congress commene
ed, January 8th, 1790. In obedience to the resolution of
the former congress, the secretary of the treasury, Mro
H.amilton, made his report on the subject of maintaining
the publick credit.
In this report, he strongly recommended to congress, as
the only mode, in his opinion, in which the public credit
would be supported:1. That provision be made for the full discharge of
the foreign debt, according to the precise terms of the
contract.
2. That provision be made fob the payment of the
domestick debt, in a similar mranner.
3. That the debts of the several States, created.for the
purpose qf carrying on the war, be assumed by the general government.
Thk  proposal for makling adequate provision for the
foreign debt was met, cordially and unanimously; but,
respecting the full discharge of the domestick debt, and
the assumption of the State debts, much division prevailed
in congress.  After a spirited and protracted debate on
these subjects, the recommendation of thte secretary prevailed, and bills conformable thereto passed, by a small
mnajority.
The division of sentiment a,mong the members of congrless,
in relation to the fiull, or only partial payment of the domes-tick debt, arose from this. A considerable proportion of the
original holders of plublick securities had found it necessary to'sell them, at a reduced price-even as low as two or three shil
lings on the pouind. Thlese securities had been purchased by
speculators, witlh the expectation of ultimately receiving the
full amount. Under thlese citcutmst,ances, it was contended by
tome, that congress would perform their duty, should they pay
to all holders of public securities only the reduced market
price. a Othlers advocated a discrimination between the present,olders of the securites, and those to whom the debt was origina!lv due, &amp;c. &amp;c.
I-n Isis report, Mr. 1aiiiton a,bly examined these sev'eral
eoints, and strongly maintained the'justice of paying to all
solders of securit{es, Without discrimination, the full value of
what appeared on the face of their certificates. This, ie contended, justice demanded, and for this the publictk faith was
Ipledged.o'3By the opposers of tlie bill, wlhicl related to the assumption
of the State debts, he e constitutional authority of the federal
g'overnment for this pupose was questioned; and the policy
and justice of the mneasure controverted.
To cancel the several debts which congress thus undertook to discharge, tlhe proceeds of publick lands, lying in
tie western territory. were directed to be applied, together
i99100             PERIOD VII....1789....1797
with the surplus revenue, and a loan of two millions of
dollars, which the president was authorized to borrow, at
an interest of five per cent.
This measure laid the foundation of publick credit upon
suchl a basis, that government paper soon rose from two
shillings and six-pence to twenty shillings on the pound,
and, indeed, for a short time, was above par. Individuals who had purchased certificates of public debt low,
realized inmmense fortunes.  A general spring was given
to the affairs of the nation. A spirit of enterprise, of
agriculture, and of commerce, universally prevailed, and
the foundation was thus laid for that unrivalled prosperi.ty which the Unit'ed States, in subsequent years, enjoyedo.
V. During this session 9f congress, a bill was passed,
fixing the seat of government for ten years at Philadelphia, and, from and after that timne, permanently at Washi
ington, on the Potomrnac.
VIL On the 4th of     archl, 1791, VElMONT, by conr
sent of congress, becamne one of the Unlited States.
The tract of country, which is now kcnown by the name of
Vermont, was settled at a much later period than any other of
the eastern states. The governmients of New-York and Massachusetts made large grants of territory in the direction of
Vermont; but it was not until 1724, that any actual possession
was taken of land, withini the present boundaries of the State.
In that year Fort Durance was built, by the officers of AMassachusetts, on Connecticut river. On the other side of the state,
the French advanced up lake Charnplain, and, in 1731, built
Crown Point, and began a settlement on the eastern shore of
the lake.
Vermont being supposed to fall within the limits of NewHampshire, that governmnent mnade large grants of land to settlers, even west of Connecticut river. New-York, however,
conceived herself to have a better right to the territory, in consequence of the grant of Charles II. to his brother the duke of
York. These states being thus at issue, the case was submitted
to the English crown, which decided in favour of New-York,
and confirined its jurisdiction, as far as Connecticut river. In
this decision New Hampshire ~cquiesced; but New-York persisting in its claims to land east of the river, actions of ejectlnent were instituted in the courts at Albany, which resulted in
favour of the New-Yorkl title. The settlers, however deteramined to resist the officers of justice, and under Ethan Allen,
associated together to oppose the New-York militia, which
were called out to enforce the laws.
On the commencement of the revolution, the people of Vermont were placed in an embarrassing situation. T'hey had not
even a form of government. The jurisdiction of New-York
being disclaimed, and allegiance to the British crown refused,
every thing was effected by voluntary agreement. In January,
1777, a convention mnet, and proclairrmed that the district before
tinown by the' name of the New--iampsljiire grants, was of right
kt free and independent jurisdiction, and should be henceforth
called JNew Connecticut, atias Vermont.
The convention proceeded to nmake known their proceedings
to congress, and petitioned to be admitted into the confederacy.
To this New-York objected, and for a time prevailed. Other
difficulties arose with New Hampshire and Massachusetts, each
of which laid claim to land within the present boundaries of the
state. At the peace of 1783, Vermont found herself a sovereign
and independent state de facto, united with no confederation, and
theefore unembarrassed by the debts that weighed down the
other states.
New-York still claimed jurisdiction ever thestate, but was
nable to enforce it, and the state govrernment was administered as regularly as in any of the other states. After the formation of the federal constitution, Vermont again requested admission into the Union. The opposition of New-York was
still strong, but in 1789 was finally withdrawn, upon the consent of Vermont to pay her the sum of thirty thousand dollars.
Thus terminated a controversy which had been carried on with
animosity, and with injury to both parties, for twenty-six years.
A convention was immediately called, by which it was resolved
to join the federal union. Upon application to congress, their
consent was readily given, and on the 4th of March, 1791, Vermont was added to the United States.
VII. At the time that congress assumed the State
dlebts, during their second session, the secretary of the
treasury had recommended a tax on domestick spirits, to
enable them to pay the inrterest.  The discussion of the
bill having been postponed to the third session, was early
in that session taken up. The tax, contemnplated by the
bill, was opposed with great vehemence, by a majority of
southern and western members, on the ground that it was
unnecessary and Lnequal, and wouid be particularly burdensome upon those parts of the Union, whlich could not
2011   A. 02PERIOD Vii *..i.789.... 1797.
without very great expense, procure foreign ardent spirits.
Instead of this tax, these members proposed an increased
duty on imnported articles generally, a particular duty on
molasses, a direct tax, or a tax on salaries, &amp;c. &amp;c. After
giving rise to an angry and protracted debate, the bill
passed, by a majority of thirty-five to twenty-one.
VIII. The secretary next appeared with a recommendation for a national bank. A bill, conforming to his
plan, being sent down from the senate, was permitted to
progress, unmolested, in the house of representatives, to
the third reading.  On the final reading, an unexpected opposition appeared against it, on the ground that
banking systems were useless, that the proposed bill was
defective, but, especially, that congresa was not vested by
the constitution, with the comnpetent power to establish a
national bank.
These several objections were met by the supporters of
the bill with much strength of arguTnent. After a debate
of great length, supported, with the ardour excited by the
importance of the subject, the bill was carried in the affirmative, by a majority of nineteen voices.
A bill which had been agitated with so much warmth, in the
house of representatives, the executive was now called upon
to examine with reference to its sanction or rejection. The
president required the opinions of the cabinet in writing. The
secretary of state, Mr. Jefferson, and the attorney general, Mr.
Randolph, considered the bill as decidedly unconstitutional.
The secretary of the treasury, Mr. Hamilton, with equal deci
sion, maintained thlle opposite opinion. A deliberate investiga
tion of the subject satisfied the president, both of the constitutionality and utility of the bill, upon which he gave it his signature.
The bill which had now passed, with those relating to the
finances$of the country, the assumption of thle state debts, the
funding'of the national debt, &amp;c. contributed greatly to the
complete organization of those distinct and visible parties,
which, in their long and ardent conflict for power, have sinrce
shaken the United States to their centre.
IX. While matters of high imrnportance were occupying
the attention, and party strife and conflicting interests
were filling the counsels of congress with agitation, a.n          NVASHINGTON&amp;  S ADMINtSTRATION.          2 0
Indian war opened on the north-western firontier of the
States. Pacifick arrangements had been attempted by
the president with the hostile tribes, without effect. On
the failure of these, an offensive expedition was planned
against the tribes, northwest of the Ohio.
The command of the troops, consisting of three hundred regulars, and about one thousand two hundred Pennsylvania and Kentucky militia, was given to Gen. Har-.
mnar, a veteran officer of the revolution. His instructions
required Eim, if possible, to bring the Indians to an engagement; but, in any event, to destroy their settlements,
onr the waters of the Scioto, a river falling into the Ohio,
and the Wabash, in, the Indiana territory. In this expedition Harmar succeeded in destroying some villages, and
a quantity of grain, beioDging to the Indians; but in an
engagement Wvith them, near Cl]ilicothe, he was routed
with considerable loss.
Upon the failure of Gen. Harmar, Major-General Arthur St. Clair was appointed to succeed him. Under the
authority of an act of congress, tlie president caused a
body of levies to be raised for six nmonths, for the Indian
service.
X. Having arranged the northwestern expedition, di-'meting St. Clair to destroy the Indian villages, on the
Miami, and to drive the savages from the Ohio, the president commenced a tour through the southern States, similar to that which he hlad made through the northern and
central'parts of the union inr 1789.
The same expressions of respect and affection awaited him,
in every stage of his tour, which had been so zealously accorded to him in the north. I-Here, also, he enjoyed the high satisfaction of witnessing the most happy effects, resulting from
the administration of that government over which he presided.
XI. On the 24th of October 1791, the second congress commenced its first session. Among the subjects
that early engaged their attention, was a bill "for apportioning representatives among the people of the several
States, according to the first census.: After much diso.Ijssion,'concerintg the ratio tb.at shrouId be a.dopted, be.tween representation and population, congress finally
fixed it at one representative' to each State for every
thirty-three thousand inhabitants.
The first bill fixed the ratio at one representative for every
thirty thousand inhabitants; but to this bill the senate would
not agree.  A second bill was introduced, providing one representative for every thirty thousanld, and dividing eight representAtives a'nnong those States which had the greatest fractions.  Thss bill the president returned to the house, whence
it originated, as unconstitutional, as by it, eight States would
send more represeintatives than their population allowed.
XII. In Decenimber, intelligece was received by the
president, that the army under Gen. St. Clair, in battle
with the lIndians, near the Miami, in Ohio, had been to.
tally defeated on the 4th of the preceding montlh.
The army of St. Clair amounted to near one thousand five
hundred men. The Indian fbrce consisted of nearly the same
number. Of the loss of the Indians, no estimate could be formed; but the loss of thl6 Americans was unusually severe; thirtyeig-ht commissioned officers were killed in the field, and five
hundred and ninety-three non-commnissioned ofifcers and privates were slain and missing.  Between two and three hun-.
dred officers and privates were wounded, mnany of whom afterwards, died. This result of the expedition was as unexpected;.
as unfortunate; but no want either of ability, zeal, or intre-.
pidity, was ascribed, by a committee of congress, appointed to
examine the causes of its failure, to the commander of the ex.pedition.
XIII. Upon the news of St. Clair's defeat, a bill was
introduced into congress for raising three additional regi
mnents of infantry., and a squadron of cavalry, to serve for
three years, if not sooner discharged. This b1ll, although
finally carried, met with an opposition more warm  and
pointed fromn the opposers of the administration, than an:
whichi had before been agitated in the house.
By those who opposed the bill, it was urged that the war wVit'
the Indians was unjust; that the mrilitia would answer as vwel;
and even better than regular troops, and would be less exliler
sive to support; that: adequate funrds could not be provided
and more than all, that this addition of o'ne regiment to t1
army after another gave fearful intimation of monarchical d&amp;signs, on the part of those who administered tie governmenat
On the other hand, the advo.cates of the bill conteO.nd.;e  ~ s

the war was a war of self-defence; that between the years 1183
and 1790, not less than one thousand five hundred inhabitants
of Kentucky, or emigrants to that country, and probably double that number, had been massacred by the Indians; and that
repeated efforts had been made by the government to obtain a
peace, notwithstanding which, the butcheries of the savages
still continued in their most appalling forms.
XIV. On the 8th of May, 1792, congress adjourned
to the first Monday in Novenmber.  The asperity which,
on more than one occasion, had discovered itself in the
course of debate, was a certain index of the growing exasperation of parties.  Withl their adjournment, the conflicting feelings of members in a measure subsided; the
opposition, however, to the administration, had become
fixed. It was carried into retirement-was infused by
members into tlheir constituents, and a party was thLus
formed throughout the nation, hostil:!tp the plans of gpvernment adopted by Washington, and his friends in the
cabinet.
XV. On the first of JuLne, 1792, KENTUCKY by act of
congress, was admitted into the Union as a State.
The country, now called Kentuckiy, was well known to the
Indian traders, many years before its settlement. By whom it
was first explored, is a mnatter of uncertainty, and has given
rise to controversy. In 1752, a map was published by Lewis
Evans, of the country on tlhe Ohio and Kentucky rivers; and
it seems that one James Macbride, with others, visited this
region in 1754. No further attempt was made to explore the
country until 1767, when John Finley, cf North-Carolina, travelled over the ground on the Kentucky river, called by the
Indians, " the dark and bloody ground."
On returning to Carolinra, Finley communicated his discoveries to Col. Daniel Boone, who in 1769, with some others,
undertook to explore thle country. After a long and fatiguing
march, they discovered thle beautiful valley of Kentucky. Col.
Boone continued an inhabitant of this wilderness until 1771,
when he returned to his family for the purpose of removing
them, and forming a settlement in the new country. In 1773,
having made the necessary preparations, he set out again with
five families and forty men, from Powell's Valley, and after
various impediments, reached the Kentucky river in March,
1775, where he commenced a settlement.
In the years 1778, 1779, and 1780, a conriderable number
I 8of persons emingrated to Kentucky; yet, in this latter year, after an unusually severe winter, the inhabitants were so distressed that they came to the determination of abandoning the
country for ever. They were fortunately diverted from this
step by the arrival of emigrants. During the revolutionary
war, they suffered severely from the Indians, incited by the
British government. In 1778, Gen. Clarke overcame the Indians, and laid waste their villages.
From this time the inhabitants began to feel more secure,
and the settlements were extended. In 1779, the legislature
of Virginia, within whose limits this region lay, erected it into
a county. In 1782, a supreme court, with an attorney-general, was established within the district. In the years 1783,
1784, and 1785, the district was laid out into counties, and a
great part of the country surveyed and patented. In 1785, an
attempt was made to forin an independent State; but a majority ofthe inhabitants being opposed to the measure, it was delayed until December, 1790, when it became a separate state.
In 1792, as stated above, it was admitted into the Union.The growth of Kentucky has been rapid, and she has obtained
a respectable rank and influence among her sister States.
XVI. During the recess of congress, preparations
were hastened by the president, for a vigorous prosecution of the war with the Indians; but such small inducements were presented to engage in the service, that a
sufficient number of recruits could not be raised to authorize an expedition against them the present year. As
the clamour against the war, by the opposers of the administration, was still loud, the president deemed it advisable, while preparations for hostilities were advancing,
to make another effbrt at negociation with the unfriendly
Indians. The charge of this business was committed to
Col. Harden and Maj. Freeman, two brave officers, and
valuable men, who were murdered by the savages.
XVII. On the opening of the next congress, in November, a motion was made to reduce the military establishment, but it did not prevail. The debate on this
subject was peculiarly earnest, and the danger of standing armies was powerfully urged. This motion, designed
as a reflection upon the executive, was followed by several resolutions, introduced by Mr. Giles, tending to crimirlate the secretary of the treasury, Mr. Hamilton, ofmisconduct, in relation to certain loans, negotiated under
his direction.
In three distinct reports, sent to the house, the secretary offered every required explanation, and ably defended himself againist the attacks of the opposition. Mr.
Giles, and some others, however, were not satisfied;
other resolutions were, therelore, offered, which, although
rejected, were designed to fix upon tlhe secretary the reputation of an ambitious man, aiming at the acquisition
of dangerous power.
During these discussions, vehemrnent attacks were made upon
the secretary, in the publick prints. I-Hints also were suggested
against the president himself; and although he was not openly
accused of being the head of the federal party, of favouring their
cause, or designing to subvert the liberties of his country, yet it
was apparent that such suspicions were entertained of him.
On the 3d of March, 1793, a constitutional period was put
to the existence of this congress. The members separated
with obvious symptoms of irritation; and it was not to
be doubted that their efforts xt.uld be exerted to communicate to their constituents the feelings which agitated
their bosoms.
XVIII. The time had now arrived, 1793, when the
electors of the States were again called upon to choose a
chief magistrate of the Union. Washington had determined to withhold himself from being again elected to
the presidency, and to retire from the cares of political
uife. Various considerations, however, prevented the declaration of his wishies, and he was again unanimously
elected to the chair of State. Mr. Adams was re-elected
vice-president.
XIX. Through the unceasing endeavours of the presi.,
dent to terminate the Indian war, a treaty had been negotiated with the Indians on the Wabash; and through the
intervention of the Six Nations, those of the Miamis had
consented to a conference during the ensuing spring. Offensive operations were; thlerefore, suspended, although
the recruiting service was industriously urged and assidu207ERIOD I....1492....1607....SETTLEiMENTS.  19
patent,-an exclusive right, or privilege,-to two companies, called the London and Plymouth Companies: by
whliich they were authorized to possess the lands, in Ame,
rica, lying between the 34th and 45th degrees of north
latitude; the southern part, called South Virginia, to the
London, and the northern, called North Virginia, to the
Plymouth Company..
Under this patent, the London Company sent Capt.
Christopher Newport to Virginia, Dec. 20th, 1606, with
a colony of one hundred and five persons, to commence
a settlement on the island Roanoke -now in North Carolina.-After a tedious voyage of four months, by the
circuitous route ofthe West Indies, he entered the Chesapeake Bay, having been driven north of the place of his
destination.
Here it was concluded to land; and, proceeding up a
river, called by the Indians Powhatan, but, by the colony,
JamesRiver, on a beautiful peninsula, in May, 1607, they
began the first permanent settlement in North Arnerica,
and called it Jaynestown.
The government of this Colony was formed in England, by the London Company. It consisted of a council
of seven persons, appointed by the Company, with a p-re
sident chosen by the council, fromn their numnber, who hadt
two votes. All matters of moment wvere examined by
this council, and determined by a majority. Capt. New.
port brouglht over the names of thlis council, carefullj
sealed in a box, which was opened after their arrival.
Among the most enterprisra and useful memnbers of this coD
lony, and one of its magistrates, was Capt. Johln Smrith.
In an attempt to ascertain the source of Chickahomin, ri,ver, he ascended in a barge as far as the stream was uninterrupted. Designing to proceed still further, he left the barg'e
in the keeping of the crew, with strict injunctions on no account to leave her, and with two Englishmen, and two lndian-s
left the party. But ino sooner was he out of view, than the
r'ew, imipatient of restraint, repaired on board the barge, and
nroceediung some distance down the stream, lanrded at a place

ous attention was paid to the discipline and preparation
of the troops.
XX. The Indian war, though of real importance, was
becoming an object of secondary consideration. The re
volution in France was now progressing, and began so to
affect our relation with that country, as to require an exer
tion of all the wisdom  anid firmntess of the government.
Early in April, also, informnation was received of the declaration of war by France   against England and Holland.
This event excited the deepest interest in the United
States.  A  large majority of the people, grateful for the
aid that France had given us in our revolution, and devoted to the cause of liberty, were united in fervent wishesfor the success of the French republic.*  At the same
time, the prejudices against Great Britain, which had
taken deep root during thie revolution, now sprung forth
afiresh, and the voice of many was heard, urginig the propriety of the United States making a common cause with
France against Great Britain.
A  pressing  occurrence   had called Washington to
* The revolution in France commenced about the year 1789. It
seems to have been hastened, or brought on, by the new ideas of
freedom, which had been imbibed by the French armny in the Uni
ted States, and thence disseminated among the people of France,.
for a long time oppressed and de-'raded by a despotick government.
Unfortunately, the revolution fell ilo the hands of selfish and un
principled men, who in 1793, executed their king, Louis XVI. and
soon after, his family, and murdered or imprisoned those who were
suspected of hostility to their viewvs and involved France in a scene
of guilt and bloodshed whichl cannot be conitenmplated without horrour. In the first stages of this revolution, the friends of liberty
throughlout the world were full of hopes for a melioration of the
political condition of France; buLt these hopes were soon blasted
by the sanguinary steps adopted by the revolutionists. Had they
been men governed by reason and religion, instead of unbridled
ambition; actuated by a philanthropick regard to the good of the
people, instead of a selfish thirst of power, Frantce to this day mibht

between Fraince and England. Hastening his return to
Philadelphlia, he summoned the attention of his cabinet
to several questions respecting the course of conduct proper for the United States to observe in relation to the
belligerents.
Although sc,sible of the prejudices existing in the country against Great Britain, and of the friendly disposition
which prevailed towards France, it was the unanimous
opinion of the cabinet, that a strict neutrality should be
observed by the United States towards the contending
powers. The council was also unanimous that a minister
from the French Republick should be received, should
one be sent.
In accordance with the advice of his cabinet, the president issued his proclamation of neutrality, on the 22d of
April, 1793. This proclamation, being without legislative sanction, soon becaine the subject of loud invective.
The opposition party, through the press, pronounced it a
".royal edict," an assumption of power on the part of the
presldent, and a proof of his monarchical disposition.
They denounced the conduct of the executive as dish0.onourable, and an act of neutrality as high ingratit,de towvards France, the firm and magnanimous ally of the
United States, whichl had assisted in achieving the liberties
of the country.
XXI. In this state of things, the Republick of France
recalled the minister of the crown, and appointed Mr.
Genet to succeed himn. His mission hlad for its object the
enlisting of America in the canse of France, against Great
Britain. Flattered by thie manner in which he was re..
ceived by the people, as well as by their professions of
attachlment to his country, Mr. Genet early anticipated
the accomplishment of his object.
P i-esuming too much upon this attachment, he was led
into a series of acts infringing the neutrality proclaimed
by the president.  He also attempted to rouse the
people against the government, because it did not se1.,.8'                 -.
209cond all his views.  At length, on the advice of his
cabinet, the president solicited of the French Republick
the recall of Mr. Genet, and the appointment of some one
to succeed him. Monsieur Fauchet was appointed, and
was instructed to assure the American government, that
France totally disapproved of the conduct of his predecessor.
Mr. Genet, on his arrival in the country, landed at Chlarleston, S. C. He was received by the governour of that State,
and by the citizens, with a flow of enthusiastick feeling, equalled only by that which had been evinced towards his nation at
the conquest of Yorktown.
Soon after landing at Charleston, he began to authorize the
fitting and arming OQf vessels, in that port, enlisting men, and
giving commissions to druize and commit hostilities against nations with iWhiehi the JUnited States were at peace. Vessels
captured by these clruisers wvre brought inTto port, and the consuls of France, under the authority of Genet, not yet recognized as as a minister by the Aroerican government, assumed the
power of holding courts of admiralty on them, of trying and
condemning them, and of authorizingp their sale. Upon a complaint of the British minister, Mr. Hammond, the American
cabinet unanimously condemned those proceedings, and agreed
that,the efficacy of the laws should be tried against those citizens who had been concerned in them.. Prosecutions were accordingly ordered and actually commenced.
The d.cisions and conduct of the cabinet gave great umbrage
to Genet, -who had now been accredited as the minister of
France. In his comrnmlunications to the secretary of state, h-is
dissatisfaction was expri essed in strong terms, and the executive
charged with holding opimions, and adoptinf a course diametrically opposed to the views an'd  ishes of the American people.
In language hig'hly offensiveand reprehensible, he demanded
that those persons under a,rest, by order of the governrmenrt of
the United States, should be releas ed, "on the ground that they
were actinllg under the auithoritx o(f France, and defending the
glorious cause of liberty ini co-i,ioon with her children." And
at length he incautiously -vov.edl tthe purpose, should his demands not be coipl-ld WilLi of appealing from the president
to the people.
The lanr,uag'e and cono.eut of Genet made a deep impression
on the oefficers of tbhe tP_{ iniitin;,but happily, they preserved, in all their commusication,; wiih-that gentleman, a becoming dignity, and continued to express a high respect and affection for his nation, and an earnest desir e to promote its interests.On the meeting of congress, December, 1793, the proclamation of neutrality was approved by them, as well as the conduct
of the government towards Mr. (enet.
Findling on most qutestions arising between the French minister and the government of the United States, a wide and an irncreasing difference of views, and perceivingnobeneficial effects
resultingl fromi his continuance in that character, the cabinet
unanimously advised his recall.
XXII. 1794. On the last day of December, 1793,
Mr. Jefferson, the secretary of state, resigned his office,
and was succeeded by Edmund Randolph, the then attorney-general, this latter office was filled by William
Bradford, a gentleman of considerable eminence in Pennsylvania.
XXIII.   During the session of congress this year, a
resoluLtion passed to provide a naval force adequate to
the protection of the commerce of the United States,
against the Alge ine corsairs.  The force proposed was
to consist of six frigates, fiour of forty-four, and two of
thlirty-six guns.
This measure wn as fronded upon the communications of the
president, fiom  hlich it, appeared that the prospect of being
able to negotiate a treaty of peace with the dey of Algiers was
doubtful; that eleven American merchant vessels, and upwards
of one hundred citizens had been captured by them; and that
further prQvrations were makirng for a renew{ved attack upon
unprotected vessels belonging to the United States.
XXIV. During thliis session of congress, a law passed,
prohibiting the carrying on of the slave trade fromn the
American ports.
England had been actively engaged in tihe slave'trade nearly
fifty years, when the first settemnent was effected in Virginia.
Slavery wvas early introduced into the American colonies. The
first slaves, about twenty in numnber, were brought to Virginia,
in 1619, by a Dutch ship. The importation of them gradually
increased, and althoughl principally bought by the southern
planters, slaves were soon found in great numbers, in all the
colonies. In 1784, thltey amounted to six hu:ndred thousand. In
1790, to six hundred and ninety-seven thousand six hundred
and ninety-six.
A disgust towards this inhuman traffick appeared very earIv
in the colonies; but it was countenanced and patronized by the
}'nglish government, and thus introduced into' and fastened
21iPERIOD VII....17S9....1797.
upon the country, without thlje power, on the part of the col
fies, to arrest it.
In Massachusetts, in 1645, a law was made,' prohibiting
the buying and selling of slaves, except those taken in lawful
ar, or reduced to servitude by their crimes." In 1703, the
same colony imiposed a heavyduty on every negro imported,
and in a subsequent law on the subject, they called the practice, " the uunnatural end snaccountable cutstom of enslaving mankiend." In Virginia, as early as 1699, attempts were made to
repress the importation of slaves, by heavy duties. These, and
other acts, show that the North American provinces would, if
left to tihemrnselves, have put an end to the importation of slaves
before the era of their indeecndence.
In 1778, Virginia abolished thle trafiick by law; Connecticut,
Rhode-Island, Pennsylvania, and Mlassachusetts, prohibited it
before the year 1789. The conti-nental congress passed a resolution against the purchase of slaves, imported from Africa, and
exhorted the colonies to abandon thle trade altogether. The
third congress of the United States, as stated above, prohibited
the trade, by law. Thus we see, in the.United Sates, a very
early and settled aversion to tihe slave trade manifestiDg itself,
and before European nations had consented to relinquish it,
several of the States had utterliy prohibited it.
XXV. At this session also, several measures were
adopted in anticipation of a Wsar with (Great Britain, growing out of her commuercial restuiction which bore hleavyv,
and operated most uniustly upon the Unitedi States. Bills
were passed tor layil.g an em-bai-go for thirty days-for
erectinlg fortifications-for organizirg the militia, and increasing the standing army. As an adjustment of differ,ences however, seemed desirable, i'i. Jay wvas appointed envoy extraordinary to the coust of St. Jamines, and succeeded in negotiating a treaty with Great Britain the following year.
Among the offensive acts of the government of Great Britain.
was an order of J3une, 1793, prohibiting the exportation of corn
to France, and authorizing the capture of neutral vessels carrying it thither.  Under this order, many American vessels
were captured and carried into England. In November following, additional instrluctions were given by the British cabinet, to.sips of war and privateers. to bring into port, for trial;
all ships laden with goods from France, or her colonies, and
such as were carrying provisions, or other supplies, to either.
To these causes of complaint, GrCat Britain had added ano21.2thler, viz. neglecting'to deliver up the western posts according
to treaty.
Wthiie measures were taking, in anticination of war, the president received advices from England, that the order of November had been considerably modified; that most of the merchant vessels, which had been carried into port for trial, would
be released; and that a disposition for peace with the United
States existed in the British cabinet.
These advices opened to the president a prospect of restoring a good understanding between the two nations, and induced him immediately to nominate an envoy to settle existing
differences, and to negociate commnercial arrangements. Tihe
nomination of Mr. Jay was approved, in the senate, by a majority of ten.
To those opposed to the administration-. no step could have
been more unexpected, or disagreeable, than this decisive measure of the president.  Prejudic.,es against Great Britain had
risen to their height, and hostilities against her were loudly demanded, as both just and necessary.  It was not sinigular,
therefore, that'for this act, the president should receive the severest censures of the opposition party, nor that all who favoure-d his efforts for peace sihould be included in the general denunciation.
XXVI. The sutspension of hostilities against the Indians in the northwest in consequence of their consent,
isng to a conference in the spring of 1794, hlas already
been noticed.  This effort to conclude a treaty with them
failing, Gen. Wayne, who had succeeded Gen. St. Clair,
engaged the Indians, August 20th, 1794, on the banks of
the Miami, and gained a complete victory over them.
The American troops engaged in this battle did not exceed
nine hundred; the Indians amouited to two  thousand. In this'
decisive engageinent, Gen. Wayne lost one }hundred and seven in killed and wounded, includi-ng officeis. After the battle
lie proceeded to lay waste. the whole indian country. By.
means of this victory over the Miamis, a general war with the
Six Nations, and -all the tribes nortlhwest ofthe Ohio, was preVented.
XXVII. This year, 1794, was distinguished by an
insurrection in Pennsylvania, growing out of laws enacted
by congress, in 1791, laying dutties on spirits distilled
within the United States, and upon stills.  In August, the
president issued his proclamation, commanding the insur

gents to disperse.  This not having the desired effect, a
respectable body of militia was ordered out, under Gov.
Lee, of Maryland, on whose approach the insurgents laid
down their armns, solicited the clemency of the government,
and promised future submission to the laws.
From the time that duties were laid upoi spirits distilled
within the United States, &amp;c. combinations were formed, in the
four western counties of Pennsylvania, to prevent their collection. Numerous meetings were held at different times and
places, at which resolutio(ns were passed, and, in several instances, violences were committed upon the officers of the revenue. Eighteen of the insurgents were taken, and tried for
treason, but not convicted.
XXVIII. 1795. January 1st, Col. Hamilton resigned
the office of secretary of the treasury, and was succeeded
by Oliver Wolcott, of Connecticut. Nearly at the saime
time, Timothy Pickering succeeded Gen. Knox in the department of war.
XXIX. In June, Mlr. Jay having succeeded in negdtiating a treaty with Great Britain, the senate was convened
to consider its merits. After an elaborate discussion of it
that body advised to its ratification by a majority of twenty to ten. Notwithstanding the great opposition to it that
prevailed among the enemries of Great Britain, the president gave it his signature.  Contrary to the predictions of
many in the country, the treaty settled existing difficulties
betweeil the two nations, prevented a war, which previously seemed fast approachiing, and proved of great advantage to the United States.
The treaty, when published, found one party prepared for
its condemnation, while the other was not ready for its defence.
Time was necessary for a judicious and careful consideration
of its merits.
In the populous cities, meetings were immediately called,
and resolutions and addresses forwarded to the preslident, requesting him to withhold his assent. Upon the president,
however, these had no other effect, than to induce himn to
weigh still more carefully the merits of the treaty. When, at
length, he was satisfied of its utility, he signed it, although he
thereby incurred the censures of a numerous portion of the ci?
izens.          WASi INtGTON'S ADMINISTRATION.             215
XXX. In the course of the following autumn, treaties
were concluded with the dey of Algiers, and with the
Miamis in the west.  By the former treaty, American
citizens in captivity in Algiers, were liberated, and by the
latter, the western frontiers of the United States were secured from savage invasion. A treaty witht Spain soon
after followed, by which the claims of the United States,
on the important points of boundary, and the nagivation
of the Mississippi, were fully conceded.
XXI. On the 1st of June, 1796, TENNESSEE was admitted, by act of congress, into the Union as a State.
Tennessee,derives its name from its principal river. This
name, in the languagoe of the Indians, signifies a curved spoon,
tile curvature, to their imaginations, esembling that of the
river Tennessee.
The territory of Tennessee was granted in 1664, by Charles
II. to the earl of Clarendon, and others, being included in the
limits of the Carolinas. About the beginning of the next century, Carolina was divided intO two provinces, and Tenessee
fell to the lot of the northern province. Near the year 1754,
fifty families were settled on the'Cumberland riv;er, where
Nashville now stands; but they were dislodged by the savages
soon after. In 1765, a number of emigrants settled themselves
beyond the present limits of North Carolina, and were the first
of the colonists of Tennessee. By the year 1773, the inhabitants had considerably increased. When the constitution of
North Carolina was formed, in 1776, that district sent deputies
to the meeting.  In the year 1780, a small colony of about
forty families, under the direction of James Robertson, crossed
the mountains, and settled on the Cumberland iiver, where
they founded Nashville.
In 1785, the inhabitants of Tennessee, feeling the nconveniencies of a government so remote as that in the capital of
North Carolina, endeavoured to form an independent one, to
which they intended to give the name of the "State of Franklin;" but differing amonf themselves, the scheme for the time
was abandoned.  In 1789, the legisiature of North Carolina
passed an. act ceding the terrritory, on certain conditions, to
the United States. Congress, inthe following year, acceptedthe
cession, and by another act, passed on the twenty-sixth of May,
1790, provided fori its government under the title of " The territory of the United States,'south of the Ohio."~ In 1796, Congress passed an qet enabling the people to form a state' consti216             PERIOD VII..179....179.1791.
tution, which having been adopted and approved, Tennessee
was acknowledged as a sovereign state in the union.
XXXII. On the meeting of congress in 1796, resolu
tions were passed to carry into effect the treaties nego
tiated the preceding year. On the subject of the treaty
with Great 3ritain, tile liveliest sensibility still prevailed:
After a spirited and protracted debate of seven weeks, on
the subject of makinig the necessary arrangements for this
treaty, re6ohltions to that effect passed the house by a
majority of only three.
XXXIII. As the time for a new election of the chief
magistrate of the Union approached, Gen. Washington
signified his intention to retire from publick life. Wishing
to terminate his political course with an act suilable to his
own character, and permanently useful to hlis countrymen,
le published a valedictory address to the people of the
United States, fraught with maxims of the highest politinal importance, and with sentiments of the warmest affection for his country.
In February, 1797, the votes for his successor were
opened, and counted in the presence of bothl houses of
congress. The highest number appearing in favour of
Mr. Adams, hlie was declared to be elected president of
the United States, for the four years ensuing, commencing on the 4th of March. Mr. Jefferson stucceeded Alr.
Adams in the vice-presidency.
XXXIV. SRt.erq. We can remark, d(luring this
period, no very distinct change in the minanners of the people of the United States, except that the introduction of
French philosophy seems to have affected, in some degree, the sober habits and strict morality of the people,.
which, although relaxed by the war, had now begun to
resume their influtence.XXXV.     UCtf&amp;it;. At the close of the preceding
period, we observed that religion had revived, in a de
gree, from the injuries which it suffered during the revolutionary war; and we mighit have expected, that under
the auspices of a wise anJ settled government, conducted
by a practical christian, like WAVashiington, it would have
acquired a still mQre commanding influence.  Such, how.
ever, was not the fact.
As the people of the United States heartily espoused
the cause of the revolution in France, and symnpathized
with that people in their struggle ifor freedomn, it was but
too natural, that the sentiments of the revolutionists on
other than political subjects, should be imbibed. As the
Frenchl revolutionists, were alnost uiidiversaliy deists, or
atheists, these sentiments were extensively spread over.he United States.
For a time, the boldness of the enterprises, the spiendour of
the victories, and the importance of the conquests, achieved
by the French republick, promoted the extension of French
infidelity in the iUnited States. "Most eyes," says Dr. Dwight,
" were disabled from seeing the nature of the purposes, which
the revolutioniists had in view, and of the characters which were
exhibited on this singular stag'e. In the agitation and amazement excited in all men, few retained so steady opticks as to
discern, without confusion, the necessary consequence of this
stupendous shock."
Infidelity was also greatly extended, at this time, by the
writings of Paine, Godwin,-and others; which were industriously circulated through the country.  The perspicuous and
simple style of Paine, his keen po-vers of ridicule, directed
against the Bible, and above all, the gratitude which multitudes felt for the aid his pen had given to our revolution, contributed to impart to him a peculiarly powerful influence. His
vicious life, hlowever, and the horrible enorminities, committed
by the French revolutionists, gave such a fearful comment
upon their princinles, as at length, in a great measure, to bring
them into discredit, and to arrest their growing influence.
XXXVI.       rrti alge 1 (gmilt'Et         These flourish2d, during this period beyond all former example. In
1797, the exports of the United States, of all kinds,
amounted to fifty-six mnillions, eight hundred and fify
thousand, two hundred and six doUars.    The imports:10.

and a party of Indians were imnnediately despatched to take
himn. On coming up with him, they fired, killed the Englishmren, and wo-unded himself. IV ith great presence of mind, he
now tied his Indian guide to his left arm, as a shield from the
enemies' arrows. while withl his musket he despatched three of
the most foirwavad of the assailants.
In this manner he continued to retreat towards his canoe,
while the Indians, struck with admiration of his bravery, followed with respectful caution. Unfortunately coming to a sunken
spot filled with mire, while engrossed with eyeing his pursuers,
he sunk so deep as to be unable to extricate himself, ad was
forced to surrender..
Fruitful in expedients, to avert immediate death,,2e presented an ivory compass to the chief, whose attenrtion was arrested by the vibrations of the needle. Taking advantage of
the impression which he had thus made, partly by signs, and
partly by language, ile excited their wonder still mcre by telling them of its singular powers.
Their wonder however seemed scon to abate, and their attention returned to their prisoner. I-He was now bound, and
tied to a tree, and the savages were preparing to direct their
arrows at his breast. At this instant te chif, holding up the
comnpass, they laid down their arms, and led him in triumph to
Powhattan their king.
Powhattan and his council doomed him to death, as a man
vvwhose courage and genius were peculiarly dange.ro.s to thIndians. Preparations were accordingly made, and whems the
time arrived, Smitli was led out to execution. His head was
laid upon a storne, and a club presented to Powhattan, who himself claimed the honour of becoming the executioner. The
savag-es ii. silence were circling round, and the giant arm of
Powhatan- lhad alre-ady raised th e club to strike the fatal blow,
w7hen to his astonishlmen-t ti;e young and beautiful Pocahontas,
hlis daughter, with a shlriek o ter ror, rushed fromn te throng,
and threw herself upon the body of Sminth. At the same tinie
else cast an imploring look towards h-er furious but astonished
father, and in all the eloquence of mute, but impassioned sorrow, besought his ili".
The remainder of the scene was honourabl-rto Powhatan
The club of the chief was still uplifted, but a fth&amp;r,s pity h-ad
touclhed his heart, and the eye that had at firdt kindled w.itih
wrath was now fast losing its fierceness.'He looked round as
if to collect his fortitude, or perhaps to find an excuse for his
weakness, in the pity of the attendants. A similar sympathvt
lad melted the Eavage throng, and seemed to join in the peti
tion, which the weeping Pocahontas felt, but durst not utter: oay fatiIer let the prisoner i ve." Powhatan raised his daneh.amounted to seventy-five millions, three hundred and st

XXXVI. igV0:itltilttt5. Aside from the importance
of agriculture, as furnishing us withi the greatest portion c f
our food, it began now to derive greater consequence, as
furnishing materials for our mantufatctures, anid, still more,
as contributing largely to our exports. In 1796, it was
estimated that thiree, fourths of the inhabitants of the
United States if not a greater proportion, were employed
in agricuiltlral pursuits.
XXXVII. ar~           n za     tftUrtt. During
this period, mianulfactures attracted the attention of governmenlt. Mr. HIanmilton, secretary of the treasury, made
a report to caongress on thie subject, in which he set forth
their importance to the. country, and urged the policy of
aiding them. Since that time the revenue laws have been
firamed, with a view to the encouragement of manufac-.
tures, and their promotion has been considered as a part
of the settled policy of the United S'tates.. Althoughl the
flourishinr state of'commerce comtianded the attention,
and absorbed the capital of the country in sonme deg6ree
to the exclusion of other objects, still manufactures miade
considerable progress.

about five millions.
XL. MItIZation. The adoption of the federal constitution placed the political affairs of the United States
on a permanent basis, and since that period learning hass
flourished.
In 1 7J 1, the university of Vermont was established at Burlington; Williams' College, Massachusetts, in 1793; Union
College, at Schenectady, New-York, and Greenville College,
Tennessee, in 1794; Bowdoin College, at Brunswick in Maine,
in 1795. An historical society was formed in Massachusetts, in
1791, and incorporated in 1794. It hias published twelve vo1ames of documents, designed to illustrate the past and nresent

XLL. A short time since, we were occupied min considering
the United States struggling for independence, under Washington, as a leaderof their.rnies. Under his guidance, we saw
them triumph and becomne a fiee nation. We have also seien
them, with Washington at the headof lihe convention, forming
our excellent constitution. We novw see them with Washington their chief magistrate, taking their place among the sovereignties of the earth, and launching forth oni the full tide of successful experiment.
Under Washington, as our leader, we vonr our independence;
formed our constitution; established our government. And
what reward does he ask for services like these? Does he ask
n diadem? Does he lay his hand- upon ou'r national treasury?
Does he claim to be emperor of the nation that has risen up
under his auspices? No-although "first in war-first in peace
-first in the hearts of his countrymea,"-he sublirmely retires
to the peaceful occupationrs of rural life, content with the henour of having been instrumental in achieving the independence, and securing the happiness of his country.
There is no parallel in history to this! By the side of Washington, Alexander is degraded to a selfish destroyer of his race;
Caesar.becosnes the dazzled votary of power; and Bonaparte)
a baffled aspirant to universal domiinion.
Washington has been the theme of eulogy in every nation.
"His military successes," it has been well said, "were more
solid than brilliant, and judgment, rather than enthusiasm, segulated his qonduct in battle. In the midst of the inevitable
disorder of camps, and the excesses inseparable from civil war,
numanity always found a refuge in his tent. In the morning of
triumph, and in the darkness of adv ersity, he was alike serene

John Adar.ns.
Extending from the inatguration qf President Adams,
1797, to the inauguration of T'homas Jefferson, as
president of the United States, I 801.
Section T. On the 4th of March, 1797, Mr. Adams,
in the presence of the senate, of the officers of the general
and state governments, and a numerous concouirse of spectators, took the oath of offlce, as president of the United
States.
The condition of the country, at the close of Washing,

Adams', was greatly improved fri-omI that of 1785, the period at which the former entered upon his offiace.
At home, a sound credit had been established; an immense
floating debt had been funded in a mnanner perfectly satisfactory to the creditors, and an ample revenue had been provided.
Those difficulties, which a system of internal taxation, on its
first introduction, is doomedto encounter, were completely
removed; and the authority of the government was firmly established.
Funds for the gradual payment of the debt had been provided; a considerable part of it had actually been discharged;
and that system which is now operating its entire extinction,
lad been matured and adopted. The agricultural and commnercial wealth of the nation had increased -beyond all former
example. The numerous tribes of Indians, on the west, had
been taught by arms and by justice, to respect the United States:
and to continue in peace.
Abroad, the dif erences with Spain had been accommodated.
The free navigation of thle Mississippi had been acquired, with
the use of Nlew-Orleans, as a place of deposit for three years,
and afterwards, unrtil some equivalent place should be designated.
Those causes of mutual exasperation, which had threatened
to involve the Unitedr States in a wvar with the greatest maritime and commercial power in the world, had been removed;
and the military posts which had been occupied within their
territory, from their existence as a nation, had been evacuated.
Treaties had been formed with' Algiers and Tripoli, and no
captures appear to have been nade by Tunis; so that the
Mediterranean was opened to American vessels.
This bright prospect was. indeed, in part, shaded by the discontents of France. But the causesof these discotents, it
ihad been impossible to avoid, without sutrrendering the right of
self-government. Such was the situation of the United States
at the close of Washington's, and- the commencement of Adams'
administration.
II. Just before Washington retired from office, learning
that France meditated hostilities against thie United States,
by way of depredations on her West India co ommerce, 1he
hlad recalled MIr. jonroe, then miiiister to that court, and
despatched Gen. C. C. Pincknevy, milister plenipotentiarY,
to adijust existing differences.
i-fmediately upon succeeding to the presidency  ALr.
Adams received intelihence that the French republitk ha-Iannounced to Gen. Pinckney its determination "not to re,
~eive another minister from the United States until after
the redress of grievances," &amp;c.
On the receipt of this intelligence, the president issued
his proclamation to convene copgress on the 15th of June.
In his speech on that occasion, having stated the indignity
offered the United States by France, in refusing to receive
her minister, the president, in the tone of a high-minded and
independent American, urged congress "to repel this indignity of the French government, by a course which shall
convince that government and the vWorld that we are not a
degraded people, humiliated iunder a colonial spirit of fear
and a sense of intferiority, fitted to be the miserable instruments of foreign influence, and regardless of national honour, character and interest."
Notwithstanding' this language, the president still retained a desire for peace. Upon his recomimendation, three
envoys extraordinary, C. C. Pinckney, Elbridge Gerry,
and John Mlarshall3 were ao-ointed to the French republick, to carry into efdect -the pacifick dispositions of the
United States.
lII. For a considerable time, no certain intelligence
reached the country respecting thle negotiations at Paris.
At lengtli, in tlhe winter of 17981 letters were received fromn
the American envoys, indicatin, an unfavourable state of
things; and in the spring despatchles arrived, wrhich announced the total failure of the mnission.
Before the French government would acknowledgc lthe envoys, money, by way of tribute, was demanaded inrl explicit terms
of the United States. This beinig refused, an attemipt was next
made to excite the fears of the American ministers for their
country and themselves. The immeneise power of France was
painted in glowing colours, the humiliation of the house of
Austria was stated, and the conquest of Britain was confidently anticipated. In th(i friendship of France alone, they were
tld could America look ftr safety.
During these transactions, occasion was repeatedly taken to
msult the American governrent; open wa' was continued to
be urged; by thei cruisers of'France on American coinmmerce;:d the flag of tic Unitedt States was a sufficienrt justificatioa
222for the capture and condemnation of any vessel, over whlich it
waved.
IV. Perceiving further negotiations to be in vain congress now proceeded to the adtoption of vigorous measures
for retaliating injuries which had been sustained, and for
repelling still greater injuriles which were threatened.
Amongst these measures was the augmentation of the regular al'my.
A regiment of artillerist,s and engineers was added to the
permanent establishmenet, and the president was authorized to
raise'twelve additional regiinents of infantry, and one regiment
of cavalry.. He was also authorized to appoint officers for a
provisional army, and to receive and organize, volunteer corps.
By the unanimous consent of the senate, Gen. Washington was appointed lieutejnant-general and commander in
chief of all armies raised, or to be raised, in the United
States.
V. While preparations were thlus making:'or war, in:
direct pacifick overtures were communicated by the French
government to the president, and a willingness expressed
to accommodate existing differences on reasonable terms.
Solicitous to restore that harmony andc good understancld
ing whvlich had formerly existed between thle two'countries,
the president listened to these overtures, and appointed
three envoys, Oliver Ellsworth, chief Justice of the United(
States, Patrick Henry, then late governour of Virginia, and
William Vans Murray, minister at the Hagne, to cdiscuLss
and settle, by treaty, all controversies between the United
States and France.
On the arrival of these envoys at Paris, they found the
government in the hands of Bonaparte, wlho had not beeni
concerned in the transactions which had disturbed the
peace of the two countries. Negotiations were commenced,
whichl terminated in a treaty of peace, September 30th,
1800, soon after whiclh, the provisional armly in America
was, by order of congress, disbanded.
VI. On the 14th of December, 1799, Gen. Washington
expired at his seat, at Mlount Vernon, in Virginia, leaving
a nation to mourn his loss, and to embalm his memory
wittli their tears.
2 21 o,2`4
VII. In 1800, agreeably to a resolution passed in congress in 1790, the seat of government was transferred from
Philadelphia to the city of Washington, in the District of
Columbia.
The District of Coltumbia is a territory of ten miles square.
It is about three hundred mniiles from the sea, at the head of tide
water on the Potomac, which runs through it diagonally, cear
the centre. It was ceded, in 1790, to the United States, by
Maryland and Virginia, and it is underthe immediate governme-rnt of congress.
VIII. On the 4th of March, 1801, Mr. Adams' term of
office as president would expire.  Before the arrival of the
time for a nrew election, it had been pretty certainly predicted that he could not be re-elected.  His administration,
thlrough the whole course of it, had been the subject of
much popular clamour, especially by the democratick
party.  But the measures which nmost excited the opposition of that party, and which were most successfiully employed to destroy the popularity of MAr. Adams' admi
nistration, and to place the governmenti in other hands,
were several laws passed during his presidency, among
which were the " Atien 2 and "Sedition " laws.
By the "alien latw," the president was authorized to order
any alien, whom "he should judge dangerous to the peace
and safety of the United States, &amp;c. to depart out of the territory, witfhin suchl time" as he should judge proper, upon penalty
of being " imprisoned for a termi not exceeding three years,")
&amp;c.l
The design of the "sedition law," so called, was to punish the
abuse of speech, and of the press. It imposed a heavy pecuiiary fine, and imprisonment for a term of years, upon such as
should combine or conspire toaether to oppose any measure of
government; uipon such as should write, print, utter publish
&amp;c. "any false, scandalous, and malicious writing against the
government of the United States, or either house of the congress of the United States, or the president," &amp;c.
These acts, together with others for raising a standing
army, and imrposing a direct tax and internal duties, with
other causes, so increased the opposition to Mr. Adamns'
admcinistration, as to prevent his re-election, and greatly to
weaken the strength of that party to whom he owed his
elevation to the presidency.
PL-1 RICA"),11 17111.... 1797.".1801.IX. The strife of parties, during the terrm of electioneering, was spirited. On canvassing the votes of the electors for president,it was found that Mr. Jefferson, and Mr.
Burr had each seventy-three votes, Mr. Adams sixty-five,
and C. C. Pinckney sixty-fobur. As the constitution provided that the person having the greatest number of votes
should be president, and Mr. Jefierson and Mr. Burr having an equal number, it became the duly of the house of
representatives, voting by States, to decide betwveen these
two gentlemnen.
T'he ballot was taken for several days in succession,
February, 1801, before a choice was made. The federalists generally supported Mir. Burr; the democratick party
MIr. Jefferson. At length, after much political heat and
party animosity, the choice fell upon the latter, who was
declared to be elected president of the United States for
four years, commencing March 4tlb, 1801. Mr. Bturr was
elected vice-president.

have made much progress in the United States, during this
period, it was evident that it biacl taken deep root in many
minds.
Infidels, however, were less confident, and less ready to

at the fairful and blood-chilling horrours which their princi

earth.
Shortly after Powhatan dismissed Capt. Smith with assurances of friendship, and the next morning, accompanied with a
guard of twelve onen, he arrived safely at J amestown, after a
captivity of seven weeks.
In 1609, circumstances having arisen to interrupt the friendly
dispositions of Powhatan towards the colony, he plotted tire'
entire destruction. His design was to attack them unapprised,
and to cut theii olf at a blow.
In a dark and stormy night, the heroic Pocahontas hastened
alone to Jamestown, and disclosed tihe inhumarn plot of her iather. The colony Vwere- thus put on tLhek guard, and their ruin
averted.
It may be interesting to add concerning Pocahontas, that
some time after this she was rnarried to an English gentlernan,
by the name of Rtolfe, with whoin she visited England. She,
embraced the Christian religion, and was baptized. by the name
of Rebecca. She left one son, who had several daughters, the,
descendants of whomin inheritel her lands in Virginia,) and are
among the most respectable fairilies in that State.
II. In the early part oft' this year'1609, the London
Company surrendered their rigilts to the king, a..d obtai:;ed a new charter. Under timis chiarter'I'hulias:West
Lo,d Delaware, was appointed governour lbr lile.
Towards the close of the year, the colony at Jamiestovwn,
amounting to five hundred ilnhlabitants, was reduced in six
months, by pestilence, to sixty.  Disheartened by this feartil
calamity, they resolved to leave the country, and return to England. They therefore embarked on boar-d somne vessels, just
arrived fromn Bermuda; but mneeting lord Delaware, the new
governor, with one hundred and eighty men and provisions,
they returned with thern to ttheir settlemeont, and the affairs of
the colony again began to prosper.
III. In 1614, some Dutch adventurers built a fort at
Albany, on Hudson's river. T'his conimenced the settlemnent, and laid thile toundation of that city.  The next
year a fort was built, and a settlement begun by the Dutch,
on the Island of Manhattan, now New-York.
Hudson's river derived its namrne from Henry I-Iudson, who
entered, and gave name to it, 1608. At this time, or according to others, in 1609, he ascended the river to the place where
Albany now stands. Hudson was in the service of the Dutch
East india Compamy, or soldL hisclaimns to them. The Dutchl
21tive offices, of a great portion of those whose political opib
nions were opposed to his own, on the ground that mtost of
the offices at the disposal of the government, had been exclusively bestowed on the adherents of the opposite party,
In a reply to a remonstrance of merchants of New-Haven,
against the removal from office of a federal collector of that
port, and the appointment of a gentleman of opposite politicks,
the president assigned this as the reason of the. course he
adopted.  
"It would have been to me," said he in that reply, "c a circumstance of great relief, had I found a moderate participation
of office in the hands of the majority (the democratick party.)
I would gladly have left to time and accident to raise themn to
their just share.  But their total exclusion, calls for prompter
correctives. I shall correct the procedure; but, that done, return with joy to that state of things, when the only question
concerning a candidate shall be, Is he honest? Is he capable?
Is he faithful to the constitution?"
III.  Congress meton the 8th of December.     In his
speech at the opei. Ag of the session, the president recommended the abolition of the internal taxes--the repeal of
the act passed towards the close of Mr. Adams' administration, re-organizing the United States' courts, and erecting
sixteen new judges-and an enlargemnent of the rights of
naturalization.  The debates on these several topickls in
both houses of congress were extended to great lengtl, and
displayed much eloquence, argument, and warmth.   The
recommendation of the president, notwithstanding the opposition, prevailed, and bills in accordance therewith were
passed.
The internal taxes, from the time of their establishment, had
been extremely unpopular with the party, which had elevated
Mr. Jefferson to the presidency. It was a favourite: measure,
therefore, of his, to procure their abolition.
The national judicial establishment originally consisted of a
supreme court, with six judges, who twice a year made a tour
of the United States in three circuits. Under this arrangement,
great inconveniences were experienced by the court, the bar,
and the suitors. The new arrangement in the judicial system,
and the increase of judges at the close of Mr. Adams' term,
had excited, in a large portion of the citizens, the hope of a
more prompt and impartial admintistration of justice.  o that
1 q21  portion of the community the repealing act was a painfuil disappointment.
IV. In 1802, OHIo was admitted by act of congress, as
an independent state into the Union.
The state of Ohio derived its name from the river Ohio,
which sweeps the southeastern border of the state.
Until 17837, it' was inlhabited only by Indians, a few Moravians, and trespassers on lands belonging to the publickl. By
virtue of her charter, the territory was claimed by Virginia,
and held by her, although the original charter of Connecticut,
extending west to the Pacific Ocean, included a great part of
it.
In 1781, the legisliture of Virginia ceded to the United
States all her rights to the territory northwest of the river
Ohio, excepting sonme few military tracts. In 1788, the first
settlement was begun at Marietta, under General Rufus Putnam, from New-England. It had been the year before erected into one district, including the present territories of Michigan, Illinois, and Indiana.
Until 1795, the settlement of Ohio was retarded by constant
wars with the Indians. But at that time a general peace with
the different tribes being effected by General Wayne, under
Washington, the population of the territory rapidly increased by
emigrations from Europe, and still more from New-England.
V. The year 1804 was distinguished for an event, which
filled a considerable portion of the American people with
great grief. This was the death of Gen. Hamilton, who
fell in a duel with Col. Burr, the vice-president of the United States.
VI. Mr. Jefferson's first term of office ending this year,
a new election took place, at which he was re-chosen president, and on the 4th of March again took the oath of
office George Clinton, of New-York, was elected vice-president.
VII. During the year which commenced the second of
Mr. Jefferson's presidency, a war, which had been continued for several years between the United States and Tripoli,
was concluded, and a treaty of peace negotiated by Col.
Lear, between the two countries, by which the Tiipolitan
and Ame-rican prisoners were exchanged and the sum of
sixty thousand dollars given to the pacha.

229'J 3s0           PERIOD IX..1501...1809.
The history of this war deserves a place in these pages. The
commerce of the United States had been long annoyed by the
Tripolitan cruisers-ma.y' merchantmen had been taken, and
their crews imtprisoned and cruelly treated.
As early as 1803, a squadron under ('Corn. Preble had been
sent to the Mediterranean, to protect the American comnmerce,
and to bring the corsairs to submission. During the same year,
Captain Bainbridge, in the Philadelphia, joined Commodore
PIreble, and in chasing a cruiser into the harbour of Tripoli,
grounded his vessel, and he and his crew were taken prisoners.
Shortly after the surrender of the Philadelphia, the Tripolitans got her afloat, and warped her inlto the outward harbour.
In this situation, Lieutenant, afterwards Commodore, Decatur,
conceived the bold plan of attempting to set her on fire. {He
had the day before captured a smrall xebec: laden with fruit
and oil, which was bound to Tripoli; and having on board the
Enterprize, which he commanded, ant old pilot, who understood
the Tripolitan language, he suggested his plan to Commodore
Preble, who approved of it. He would accept of only twenty
men, although a much greater number volunteered, and but one
officer, Mr. Morris, a midshipman. With tiese men concealed
in the bottom of the xebec, on the approach of night he sailed
for the Philadelphia, taking with him the old pilot. On approaching the frigate, the xebec was hailed, when the pilot answered that he had lost his cable and anchor, and begged permission to mrake fast to the frig-ate until the morning. This the
crew refused, but said he might make fast to their stern haw~
ser until they sent a boat to the admiral for leave.
As the boat put off for the shore, Lieutenant Decatur with hi's
brave companions leaped on board the frigate, and in a few
minutes swept the deck'of every Tripolitan. Of fifty, not one
reached the shore. The frigate was now set on fire, and while
the flames rose to spread consternation among the Tripolitans,
they served to lighten the'way for the heroick Decatur and his
band to go back in safety to the American squadron. Of the
party, not one was killed, and but one wounded. This was a
seaman who saved the life of his commander. In the first desperate struggle on board the Philadelphia, Decatur was disarmined. and fell. A sabre was already lifted to strike the fatal blow,
when this seaman, observing the perilous situation of his officer,
reached, forward, and received the blow of the sabre on his arm.
In consequence of the burning of the Philadelphia, the sufferings of Commodore Bainbridge and his crew, as well as those
of other Americans in captivity at Tripoli, were greatly increased. The accounts of their sufferings, transmitted to the
United States, excited the sympathy of all classes, and a gene.ral cry for exertions to effect their deliverance was heard from
all parts of the Union.
It happened that some time before this, the then reigning
bashaw of Tripoli, Jussuf, third son of the late hashaw, had
murdered his father and eldest brother, and proposed to murder
the second, in order to possess himself of the throne. But the
latter, Hamnet Caramelli, made his escape, and Jussuf, without
further opposition, usurped the governrment.
Hamet took refuge in Egypt, where he was kindly treated
by the beys. Here he was, on the arrival of an accredited
agent of the United States, General Eaton, who revived his almost expiring hopes of regaining his rightful kingdom.
General Eaton had been consul for the United States u- lhe
Mediterranean, and was r-turning horne when he hleard o&gt;t the
situation of Hlainet. Conceiving a plan of liberating theAmnericans in captivity at Tripoli, by means of the assistance of
Hamet, and, at the same timne, of restoring this exile to his
throne, he advised with Hamet, who readily listened to the project, and gave his co-operation.
A convention was accordingly entered into between General
Eaton on tthe part of the United States, and lanaet, by whiich
the latter stipuiated much in favour of the Amrnericans, and was
promised to be restored to his throne.
With a small force, consisting of seamen from thle A-nerican
squadron, the followers of Hamet, and somne Egyptian troops,
General Eaton and lHamet, with incredible toil and suffering,
passed the desert of Barca, and took possession of Derne, the
capital of a large province belonging to tli kingdom of Tripoli.
The forces of EatLon were now so mnuch increased, and the
cause of Hamet had become so popular, that the prospect was
flattering of his being able to reduce the city of Tripoli, and of
effecting the liberation of the captives without ransom.
The successes of Eaton struck the usurper Jussuf with terrour. Trembling for Yis fate in this juncture, he proposed to
Mr. Lear, the consul-general of Anerica, cthen in the Mediterranean, to enter into negotiation. Mr. Lear, who was authorized to enter ipto egotiation, accepted thle proposal, although,
he knew of the success of Eatonr and Hamet, and a treaty Iensued. Eaton and Hamet were consequently arrested in tte
prosecution of- their our pose, and the untortunrate exile failed
of his promised restoration to the throne.
tIn 1805, Hamet visited the United States with the expectation of obtaining some remruneration for his services, from
America, and for her failure in fuilfilling her stipulations to himn
by General Eaton. A proposition to this effect was brought
before congress, but after muech discussion was rejected.

VIII. During this year, 1805 MICHIGAN became a distinct territorial government of the United States.
The Michigan territory, when first discovered by the whites,
was inhabited by the Hurons, a tribe of Indians, many of whom
were converted to Clhristianity by the Jesuit Missionaries in
1648. About the year 1670, the - Hurons were defeated and
dispersed by the Six Nations, about wh ich time the French took
possession of the territory, and built a fort at Detroit, and another at Michillimackinac. Little, howeve7, was done by the
French to settle t1he couutry.
At the peace of 1763, thle territory was ceded by the French
to Great Britain, and by the latter to the United States in 1783
Until 1787, it remained in the same state of nature, without government, or any considerable settlements; but at this time the
several states who had claims upon it, ceded them to the United
States, and a territorial government was instituted over all tho
territory northwest of the Ohio.
This territory remained under one government until 1800,
when the present state of Ohio was detached,-and made a distinct government. This was followed in 1801, by a further
separation of Indiana and Illinois; and, in 1805, Michigan was
also detached, and was erected into a distinct territorial govern
ment. Gen. Hull was appointed by Mr. Jefferson the first go'ernour.
IX. In the autumn of 1806, a project was detected, at
the head of which was Col. Burr, for revolutionizing the
territory west of the Alleghanies, and of establishing anr
independent empire there, of which New-Orleans was to
be the capital, and himself the chief. Towards the accomplishment of this scheme, which it afterwards appeared
had been some time in contemplation, the skilful cunning
and intrigue of Col. Burr were directed. IHappily, how
ever, government, being apprised of his designs, arrested
him, while as yet he had few adherents, and before his
standard was raised.  H e was brought to trial at Richmond
on a charge of treasoni committed within the district of
Virginia; but no overt act being proved against him in
that State he was releasedl
In addition to this project, Col. Burr had formed another,
which, in case of failure in the first, mnight be carried on inde.pendently of it:-this was an attack on Mexico, and the establishment of an empire tlhere.',A third object was provided,
merely: ostensible, to -wit, the settlement of the pretended pur           IEFFEI SON'S ADMIIgSTIRATION.            3
chase of a tract of country on the Washita, claimed by a Baron
Bastrop. This was to serve as a pretext for all his preparations, an allurement for such followers as really wished to acquire settlements in that country, and a cover under which to
retreat in the event of a final discomfiture of bothi branches of
his real designs.
"He found at once that the attachment of the western country to the present union was not to be shaken; that its dissolution could not be efi'ected with the consent of the inhabitants  
and that his resources were inadequate as yet, to effect it by
furce. He deter,nined, therefore, to seize New-Orleans, plunder the bank there, possess himself of the military and'naval
stores, and proceed on his expedition to Mexico.
"He collected, therefore,fromn all quarters where himself or
his agents possessed influence, all the ardent, restless, desperate, disaffected persons, who were for an enterprise analogous to their characters. He also seduced good, well-meaning
citizens; some by assurances that he possessed the confidence
of the government, and was acting under its secret patronage;
and others by offers of land in Bastrop's claim in the Washita."
X. 1806.   To understand the subsequent political history of the United States, and those measures of government which were taken in relation to foreign powers, it is
necessary to glance at the state of the European nations,
at this period-particularly that of England and France.
These two countries were now at war with each other,
and in their controversies had involved most of continental powers. Towards the belligerents, Amrerica was endeavouring to maintain a neutrality, and peaceably to continue a commerce witth them;  It was hardly to be expected, however, that jealousies would not arise between the
contenrding powers in relation to the conduct of America,
and that evenrts would not occur, calculated to injure hier
commerce, and disturb her peace.
In addition to these circumstances, a controversy had
long existed, and continued to exist, between the United
States and Great Britain, in respect to the right of searching nettral ships, and impressing seamen.  Great Britain
claimed it as amnong her prerogatives to take her native
born sdbjects, wherever found, for her navy and of searching American vessels for that purpose.  A  yet no adjustment. of this controversy hiad been ef;ected. Notwithstand,
2,, 4         P~i'ERIOD IX....80l...1iS09.
ilg the remnonstrances of the American government, tlhe
officers of the British navy not unfrequently seized native
born British subjects, who had voluntarily enlisted on
board our vessels. They also illmpressed into the British
service some thousands of A-merican seamnen.
XI. May 16th, 1806, the British government issued an
order in council, declaring the ports and rivers from the
Elbe, a river in Germany, to Brest, a town of France, to
be in a state of blockade.  By this crder, Americain yes
sels, trading to tliese and intervening ports, were liable to
seizure and condemnation.
XII. In thle ensuing November, 1806, Bonaparte issued his celebrated decree at Berlin, called the "Berli?i
decree" by which all the British Islands were declared to
be in a state of blockade, and all intercourse with them was
prohibited.  This decree violated the treaty between the
United States and France and the law of nations.
The following are the principal articles of that decree, which
related to the obstruction of American commerce.
1. The British Islands are in a state of blockade.
2. All commerce and correspondence with them is prohibited
3. iNo vessel coming directly from England, or her colonies,
or having been there since the publication of this decree, shall
be admitted'ilto any port.
XIII. This decree of Bonapl)arte at Berlin; was in part
retaliated by the British gevernment in an order of council, issued January 7th, 1807, by whichi all coasting trade
with France was prohibited.
XIV. While measures were thus taking by France and
England, whlose tendency was to injure American comn
merce, and to involve her in a controversy with botl, anx
event occurred which filled the American people with i,
dignation, and called for immediate executtive notice.
This was an attack upon the American frigate Chesa
peake, Commodore Barron, off the ca/pes of Virginia, by
the British fiigate Leopard of fifty, gunls. The attack was
occasioned by the refusal of Commiodore Barron to surren
der several seamen, who had deserted from the B3riti.c:
armned ship MAelaitpus,.s hort time previous, and had v           JEFFER lSON'S gADMINISTlRATION.            20-5
luntarily enlisted on board the Chesapeake.  After crippling the American frigate, which made no resistance, the
commander of the Leopard took from her the seamen in
question, two of whoni had been proved to be American
citizens.
The persons who deserted from the Melampus, then lying in
1-lampton Roads, were William Ware, Daniel Martin, Johnr
Strachan, John Little, and Ambrose Watts. Within a month
from their escape fromn the. Melamrpus, the first tLhree of these
deserters offered themselves for enlistrment, and were received
on board the Chesapeake, thon at oiorfolk, Virginia, preparing
for sea.
The British consul at Norfolk, being apprizedl of this circumstance, wrote a letter to the Anerican naval officer, requesting
these men to be returned. With this request the officer refusiag to comply, the British agent lost no time in endeavouring(r to
procure an order from government for their surrender. In consequence of this application, the secretary of the navy ordered
an examination into the characters and claims of the men in
question. The required examination resulted in proof that
Ware, Martin, and Strach-an, were natives of America. The
two formner had protections, or notarial certificates of their being'
American citizens. Strachan had no protection, but asserteti
that he lost it previously to his escape. Such being the circumstances of the men, the government refused to surrender them.
Oa the 22d of June, the Chesapeake weighed anchor and
proceeded to sea. She passed the British ships Bellona and.
Melampus, lying in Lynnhaven hay, whose appearance wa:s
fri-endly. There were twvo other ships that lay off Cape I-lenry;
o1ne of which, the Leopard, Captain IHumphreys, weighed anhor, and in a few hours camne along side the Chesapeake.
A British officer immediately came on board, anid demanaded
ledeserters. To this Capt.. Barroni replied, that he did not
Iklov of any being- there, and thlat his duty forbade himn to
allow of any muster of h~is crew, except by their own officers.
During this interview, Barrot noticed some proceediigs of
a hostile nature on board the adverse ship, but he could not be
persuaded thlat any thing but nenace was intended by them.
Aiter tle British officer departed, he gave orders to clear his
gun deck, and after some time, he directed his men to their
quarters, secretly, and without beat of drumn: still however,
withoiut any serious apprehensions of an attack.
Before tiese orders could be executed, the Leopard cornmenced a heavy fire. This fire unfortunately wvas very destruc-,e. [n about thirty minutes, thle hul, riggin, and snars ofthe Chesapeake were greatly damaged, three men were killed
and sixteen wounded; among Uie latter was the captain himself. Such was the previous disorder, that during this time,
the utmost exertions were insufficient to prepare the ship for
action, and the captain thought proper to strike his colours.
The British captain refused to accept the surrender of the
Chesapeake, but took fiornom her crew, WVare, Miartin, and
Strachan, the three men formerly demanded as deserters, and
a fourth, John Wilson, clainLed as a runaway from a merchant
ship.
XV. Such was the agitation of the publick mind, in
consequence of this outrage committed on the Chesapeake,.
that the president conceived hiinself required to notice the
transaction, and by some decisive publick act, to show how
deeply America conceived herself to be wounded. Accordingly, on the 2d of July, the president issued his proclamation, ordering all British armed vessels to leave the
waters of the United States, and forbidding them to enter,
until satisfaction for the attack on the Chesapeake should
be made by the British government.
Mr. Monroe was at this time the minister of the United
States, at the court of St. James. Early in Septemnber, he
received the instructions of the American government, pertaining to the attack on the Chesapeake, and was required
to demand reparation for that attack, and, as an essential
part of that reparation, security against fiture imrpressments
from American ships. The British mninister, Mr. Canning,
however, protested against conjoininig the general question
concerning the impressment of pezrsons fromn neutral merchant ships, with the particular affray between the Leopard and the Chesapeake.
As Mr. lMonroe was not authorized to treat these subjects separately, further negotiation between these two mninisters was suspended, and Mr. Rose was appointed, by the
British government, as a special minister to the United
States, empowered to treat concerning the particular injury complained of, but not to discuss the general question
of impressing persons from merchant ships.
XVI. While such measures were taking in England, in
relation to the affair of the Chesapeake, congress,.which          JEFFERSON'S ADMINISTRATION.           2
had been summoned before the regular time, by proclama
tion of the president, met oni the 27th of October.
In his message to congress at this time, the president entered
fully into the state of our relationis with Great Britain-informed them of a treaty which had been negotiated with the British
government, by Messrs. Monroe and Pinckney-but which he
had rejected, principally because it made no sufficient provision
on the subject of impressments-stated the affair of the attack
on the Chesapeake- his proclamation to British armed vessels
to quit the waters of the United States-his instructions to the
American ministerI at London, in relation to reparation expected from the Britishl governmrent, and his expectation of
speedily hearing from England the result of the measures
which had been taken.
XVII. On the 1 th of November, were issued at Lon.
don the celebrated British Orders in Council, retaliatory
upon the French government for the Berlin decree of November, 18065. By these orders in council, France and
her allies, all nations at war with Great Britain, and all
places from whlich the Bristish flag is excluded, were declared to be under the same restrictions, in point of trade
and navigation, as if the same were in a state of blockade.
XVIII. Before the arrival of Mr. Rose, congress was
sedulously empioyed in considering the state of the nation,
and in making provision for putting the country in a posture of defence. Acts passed, appropriating one million of
dollars to be employed by the president in equipping one
hundred thousand of the national militia; eight hundred
and fifty-two thousand five hundred dollars for building
one hundred and eighty-eight gun-boats; one million of
dollars for building, repairing, and completing fortifications, and for raising six thousand six hundred men, infantry, riflemen, artillery, and dragoons, as an additionto
the standing army. Oni the 22d of December, an act
passed, laying an embargo on all vessels within the jurisdiction of the United States.
XIX. On the 17th of December, Bonaparte, by way
of retaliating the British orders in council, issued a decree, called "the Milan decree,' declaring every vessel
denationalized which shall have submitted to a searlch by, 2   P:ERIOD... i67&amp;.. S...SETTL1MENTSo
accordg'Iv, took possession of the counth, namin.g it Ne
Netherlands.  New-York, they called New-Ams-terdam.
These names they retained, till the conquest of the country
by the En.lishb in 1664.
IV. In 1614, Capt. John Smith sailed from England,
with two ships, to America.  lie ranged the coast from
Penobscot to Cape Cod. On his returni to England he
presented a Map of the country to Prince Clharles, who
inamed it NEw-EsGLAND.
Six years fromr this, Dec. 22 1620 a colony, commonly
known by the name of Puritans, landed at Plymouth in
Massachusetts and soon after began the frst pe manent
English settlementt in Nes =Engiand.'Ihese colonists
were originally from Enrgland; but were driven thence
by the arm of persecution, for urging a more thorough
reformation in the Church of England.
They fled from England, first to Amsterdam, in L olland in 1607, with their pastor, the Rev. Mr. Robinson.
E'rom Amsterdam they soon after remroved to Leyden,
where they continued until they embarked for America.
Among the motives which influ enced them to remove to
America the prospect of enjoy'i,g "a purer worship and
a greater liberty of conscience," was t?l-e principal. To
secure lthese objects, they w-re willing to. become exiles
from a civilized counitry, and eneounter the dangers and
p.rivations which miglit meet themi in a Wilderness.
PHaving resolved onr a removal to _&amp;mAerica, they concludd
to settle on Hudson's river, and to live in a distinct body, under
the protection of the Lonton, or South Virginia Company~
Having with some diilcalty obtained a grant from the V'irginia Company, they speedily prepared for the voyage, departed
from Leyden in July, touehed at South-1-Hampton, England,
whvience tiev sailecd inti August; but on account of a- leak in one
of their shies, they were twice compelled to put back.
On the sixth of September following, they finally Lid'adieu to
thieir country, and op the ninth of November, discorered Cape
Cod. It is said, that the master of the vessel was a Dutchman,
and was bribed in I-olland, to carry tlhem to the north of the
Hudson, that they might rsot disturb the Dutch thiere; who,
though compelled in 1614, by Capt. Argal fromn Jamestown, "o

a British ship; and every vessel a good prize, which shal
sail to or from Great Britain, or any of its colonies3 or
countries, occupied by British troops.
XX. Mr. Rose arrived in America on the 25th of December. The American minister wassoon after iniformed,
that he, Mr. Rose, was expressly forbidden by his governmnerit to make any proposal, touching the great subject of
complaint, so long as the president's proclamation of July
2d, excluding British armed vessels from the waters of the
United States should be in force.
For a time, the president refused to annul this proclamation till the atonement was not only solemnly offered,
but formally accepted; but in order to elude this difficulty, he finally agreed to revoke his proclamation, on the
day of the date of the act, or treaty., by which reparation
should be miade for the recent violence. This conression,
however, was built on two conditions; first, the terms of,
reparation which the minister was chalrged to offer must
be previously made known; and secondly, they must be
such as by the president should be accounted satisfactory.
But as the British minister declined to offer, or even to
mention, the redress of which he was the bearer, till the
AnAmerican proclamation was recalled, and the president
deeming its recall inexpedient, the controversy, for the
present closed.
The controversy respecting the Chesapeake was finally adijusted i. November, 1811, at whlich time the British minister
communicated to the secretary of state, that the attack on the
Chesapeake was unauthorized by his majesty's governmentthat the officer at that time in ccrmmand on the Amecican coast
had beenrecalled-that the men taken from the Chesapeake
shiould be restored-and thatsuitable pecuniary provision should
be made for those who suffered in the attack, a#d for the families of the seamen that fell. To these propositions the president acceded.
XXI.   The difficulties with France and England, regarding commerce, still continuing, and the existing em
bargo having failed to coerce these powers as was anticipated, into an acknowledgment of our rights-a more           JEFFERSON'S ADMINIST1RAT JLOJ.
complete stop to our intercourse with them was deemed
advisable by congress. Accordingly, on the 1st of March,
congress interdicted, by law, all trade and intercourse with
France and England.'
XXII. Mr. JefiersQn's second term of office expired on
the 3d of March. Having previously declined a re-election, James Madison was chosen president, and George
Clinton vice-president.
XXIII. IalIVI.I The bitterness of party spirit,
wvvhich had now raged in thje United States for some years,
began to have a visible effect upon society. It interrupted
to no small extent, the general harmony, and even restrained the intercourse of friends and neighbourhoods.
The strife for power, also introduced a disposition to intrigue; political cunning became fashionable, and political
duplicity lost much of its deformity. These things necessarily affected thle state of mranners. They withdrew the
finger of derision, which used to point at nmeanness of all
kinds and blunted that love of honour, and manliness of
conduct which existed before. *Cunning began to take
the place of wisdom; professions answered instead of
deeds; and duplicity stalked forth with the boldness of
integrity.
XXIV.     ti-g]tU0lg. Powerful revivalsof religion pervaded the country durintg this pcriod, and tended strongly
to prevent open infidelity, and to check the tide of pollution which was invisibly spread over the land.
XXV.,agbt abl (,gOftlUfltttt. Trade and commerce made great advances about the year 1803. The
European powers being involved in war, and the United
States remaining neutral, our vessels carried to Europe,
not only the produce of our own country, but also theproduce of othler countries.  This is usually called thle
carrying trade, and was very profitable to the country.
In 1805, 6, and, 7, our average annual exports amounted to
one hundred and two mnillions, five hundred and sixty-seven
thousand, four hundred and fifty-four dollars, of which forty
four millions, eight hundred and sixty-three thousand, five hundred and seventeen dollars, were for domestick produce, and
fifty-seven millions, seven hundred, and one thousand, nine hundred and thirty-seven dollars, for foreign produce. The annual
average of imports during these tharee years, amounted to about
one hundred and forty millions of dollars; a large proportion
of the articles, forminr this amount, were re-exported to the
West Indies, South-America, and elsewhere.
After the year 1807, the commercial restrictions laid by
France and England, began to curtail our trade, and the embargo imposed at the close of the same year by our own government, interirupted it more essentially.
XXVI.     gritCUItttrZ,  Agriculture, during a part of
this period, received great enrcouragement from our foreign
trade.  Europe being involved in contentions, the people
had little leisure there to cultivate the soil; they were
therefore supplied from other countries, and the United
States furnished them  with a great amount, and were
thence deriving great profits, when the commercial restrictions interrupted the trade.
The first merino sheep were introduced into the country, in~
1802, by Robert R. Livingston, and the same year, a greater
number, one hundred, by Gen. IHumphreys, then late minister
to Spain. Great attenton, was paid to the breeding ef them,
and they are now numerous in the United States.

A theological seminary was founded at Andover, Massachusetts, in 1808. The amount which has been contributed for
its permanent use, and whlich was given by six families, is more
than three hunildred thousand dollars. This sum includes the
permanent fund, library, and publick buildings. In 1822, the
officers were four professors, and the number of students, one
hundred and thirty-two. The library contains about five thousand volumes. A majority'of the students are supported in
whole, or in part, by charity.

DISTINGUISHED FORL MADISON S ADMINISTRATION AND
THE LATE WAR WITH GREAT BRITAIN.
James Xadison.
Extending from the inauguration of President Madison,
1809, to the inauguration of Jamnes Monroe, as presi.
dent of the United States, 1817.
Section I. On the 4th of March, 1809, Mr. Madison
wvas inducted into the office of president of the United
States, according to the form prescribed by the constitution.
The situation of the United States, on the accession of            MADISONS ADMTINISTRATiON.              243
Mr. Madison to the presidency, was in several respects
gloomy and critical. The two great powers of Europe
France and England, were still at war, and were continu~
ing to array against each other the most violent commercial edicts, oth in contravention of tile laws of nations,
and of their solemn treaties; and calculated to injure and
destroy the commerce of nations desirous of preserving a
neutrality. America was also further suffering under the
restrictions of commerce, imposed by her own government. Every effort to secure the due observance of her
rights, by the contending powers, had hitherto failed, and
the sad alternative was presenting itself to the American
people, either to suffer the evils growing out of foreign and
domestick restrictions, or to take up arms, and risk the
consequence of a war with the belligerents.
II. Previously to the adjournment of the last congress~
under Mr. Jefferson, an act passed, as already noticed,
1st of March, repealing the then existing embargo, and
interdicting commercial intercourse with France and Great
Britain. Should either of these powers, however, revoke
their edicts the president was authorized to renew the
intercourse.
April 18th, the British minister, Mr. Erskine, informed
the secretary of state, Mr. Smith, that his majesty's government considering the nonintercourse act, passed
March ist, as having produced an equality in the relations of the two belligerent powers with respect to the
United States, would be willing to rescind the orders in
council of Januairy and November, 1807', so far as it respected the United States, provided the president would
issue a proclamation for the renewal of intercourse with
Great kritain. This proposal was readily accepted. The
British minister, in consequence of this acceptance, stated
hlimself authorized to declare that the above orders in
touncil would be withdrawn as it respected the United
States, on the succeeding loth of June. A proclamatiorn
by the president, soon after followed, renewing the inter,
course with Great Britain, from and after that time.,This event produced the highest satisfaction throutghout
the country, but was speedily followed by a disappointment as great. The British government denied the authority of Mr. Erskine, to enter into any such stipulations,
and refused its ratification. On learning this refusal, the
president issued his proclamation, August 10th, reviewing
the nonintercourse with Great Britain.
III. Early in September, Mr. Jackson arrived at Washington, as successor of Mr. Erskine. A  correspondence
was soon commenced between this ministersand the secretary of state, which after continuing several weeks,
without adjusting any differences between the two countries, was suddenly closed by the president, on account
of an alleged insult on the part of Mr. Jackson.
In the course of correspondence with the secretary, Mr~
Jackson had repeatedly asserted that the American sxecutive
could not but know, from the powers exhibited by Mr. Erskine,
that in the above stipulations he had transcended those powers,
and was therefore acting without the authority of his. government. This was deemed by the executive equivalent to a declaration, that the American government did know that Mr.
Erskine was exceeding his powers. The British minister denied the legitimacy of such an inference-but the executive,
regarding his language as reflecting upon the honour and integrity of-the American government, closed the correspondence-soon after which, Mr. Jackson was recalled, but without the censure of his government.
IV. 1810. On the 23d of March, Bonaparte issued a
decree, usually called the " Rambouiliet decree," designed
to retaliate the act of congress, passed March 1st, 1809,
which forbade French vessels entering the ports of the
United States. By the above decree, all American vessels and cargoes, arriving in any of the ports of France,
or of countries occupied by French troops, were ordered
to be seized and condemned.
V. On the ist of lMay, congress passed an act, excluding British and Freinch armed vessels from the waters of
the United States; but at the same time providing, that
in case either of the above nations should modify its edicts
before the third of March, 1811, so that they should ceaseto violate neutral commerce, of which fact the president
was to give notice by proclamation, and the other nation
should not, within three months after, pursue a similar
step, cormmercial intercourse with the former might be
renewed, but not with the latter.
VI. In consequence of this act of the American government the French minister, the Duke of Cadore at Paris,
informed the American minister, Mr. Armstrong, then in
France, that the Berlin and Milan decrees were revoked,
and that, from and after the 1st of November, they would
cease to have effect.  But, at the same, it was subjoined, that it was "understood, that, in consequence of
this declaration, the English shall revoke their orders
in council, &amp;c."  About the same time it was announced
that the Ramnbouillet decree had also been rescinded.
Although the condition subjoined to the Duke of Cadore's declaration rendered it doubtful whether the Berlin
and Milan decrees would in fact cease to take effect
after the 1st. of November, the president issued his pro
clamation on the 2d of that month, declaring that those
decrees were revoked, and that intercourse between the
Utnited States and France might be renewed.
VII. While the affairs of America, in relation to the
belligerents, were in this posture, an unhappy engagement
took place, May, 1811, between the American frigate
President commanded by Capt. Rogers, and a B'titish
sloop of war, the Little Belt, commanded by Capt.'Binghlan. The attack was commenced by the latter vessel,
without provocation, and, in the rencontre, suffered greatly
in hler men and rigging.
A court of inquiry was ordered on the conduct of Captain
Rogers, which decided that it had been satisfactorily proved to
the court, that Capt. Rodgers hailed the Little Belt first-that
his hail was not satisfactorily answered--that the Little Belt
fired the first gun-and that it was without previous provocation or justifiable cause, &amp;c. &amp;c.
VIII. Congress was assembled by proclamation on the
5th of November. In his message at the opening of the
session,the president indicated the expectation of hostilities.245.with Great Britain at no distant period, since her orders
in council, instead of being withdrawn, were, when least
to have been expected, put in rigorous execution.
" I must now add," continues the president in his message,
that the period has arrived which claims from the legislative
guardians of the national rights, a system of more ample provision for maintaining them."'-" With" such full" evidence of
the hostile -inflexibility" of Great Britain, "in trampling onrights which no independent nation can relinquish, congress
vill feel the duty of putting the United States into an armour
snd an attitude demanded by the crisis, and corresponding with
the national spirit and expectations."
On the 29th, the committee on foreign relations presented their report, in which, adopting the language of the
president's message, they strongly recommended, "That
the United States be immediately put into an armour and
attitude demanded by the crisis, and corresponding with
the national spirit and expectations."  Bills agreeable to
this recommendation passed congress preparatory to a
state of hostilities, among which was one for raising twen-'
ty-five thousand men.
IX. In December, the president communicated to congress an official account of the battle of " Tippacanoe"
-near a branch of the Wabash-fought November 7th,
between an army under Gen. Harrison, governor of the
Intdiana territory, and a large body of Inrdians, in which
the latter were defeated.
The attack was commenced by the Indians about four oclock
in the morning, while the.army of Harrison were in a measure
unprepared. But notwithstanding this disadvantage, after a
hard fought action, the Indians were repulsed with a loss of
nearly seventy killed, and upwards of a hundred wounded.
The loss of the Americans was severe, being, according to offi
cial return, one hundred and eighty-eightin killed and wounded.
X. During the following year 1812, LOUISIANA was
admitted into the union as a sovereign state.
Until the year 1811, Louisiana comprehended that vast tract
of country which was ceded to the United States by France, in
1803. At that time, however. the Territory of Orleans, which
was then a distinct -erritorial governm-ent, assumed thie name
of Louisiana, and was adwxitted the following year as a stato
-46into the Union; since which time the remaining portion of original Louisiana has received distinct denominations.
Louisiana was first discovered in 1541, by Ferdinand de Soto.
In 1683, Monsieur de la Salle, an enterprising Frenchman,
sailed up the Mississippi a considerable distance, and named
the country Louisiana, in honour of Louis XIV. A French
settlement was begun in 1699, by M. d'Ibberville, in Lower
Louisiana, near the mouth of the river Perdido. The progress
of the colony was slow. In 1712, although twenty-five hundred emigrants had arrived, only four hundred whites and
twenty negroes were Alive.
About this titne, the French government made a grant of the
country to M. de Crozat for a term of ten years; but after
five years he relinquished his patent to the Mississippi company. In the same year, 1717, the city of Orleans was founded.
By 1the treaty of 1763, all Louisiana east of the Mississippi,
was ceded to England, together with Mobile, and all the possessions of France in that quarter. About the same time, the
possessions of France west of the Mississippi were secretly
ceded to Spain. After the cession to Great Britain, that part
of the territory which lay west of the Mississippi, received the
namne of West Florida. On the breaking out of the revolutionary war, Spain, after cmsiderable hesitation, took part with the
United States' incited, probably by the hope of regaining her
possessions east of the Missiszippi. In 1779, Galvoy, the governour of Louisiana, took possessiofl of Baton Rouge; and
the other settlements of the English in Florida surrendered
successively.
By the treaty of 1783, the Mississippi was made the western
boundary of the United Sta.tes fromn its source to the 31st degree of latitude, and followingo thbis line to the St. Mary's. By
a treaty of the same date, the Flori3as were ceded to Spain
without any specifick boundaries. This omission led to a controversy between the United States and Spain, which nearly
terminated in hostilities. By a treaty with Spain, however, in
1795, boundary lines were amicably settled, and New-Orleans
was granted to American citizens as a place of deposit for their
effects for three years and longer, unless some other plade of
equal importance hhould be assigned. No other place being
assigned within that time, New-Orleans continued to be used
as before.
In 1800, a secret treaty was signed at Paris, by the plenipor
tentiaries of France and Spain, by wvhich Louisiana was guaranteed to France, and, in 1801, the cession was actually
made. At the same time, the Spanish intendant of Louisiana
was instructed to riake arrangements to deliver the costmtr, t

a place of settlement where thely were.

provisions of vwhich they were to be governed. Mr. John ( va
~fer was elected governour for one year.
Parties were now despatched to fix upon a spot for their set
tlement. Several days were em-nployed for this purpose, duringl
which, a number of indians were seen, who fled on being ap
proached. They also discovered baskets of corn hid in the
sand, which served for seed the ensuing spring.
At length, a suitable spot was selected for a settlement, and
a house immediately erected. The colony was divided into
nineteen families, each of which built its own cottage. On
Lord's day, Dec. 31, the' at-tended ptublic worship, for the first
time on shore, and named the place PlymoWuth;
V.o The same month, (Nov.) that the Puritans arrived
on the coast from England, king James I. issued a patent
to the dcluke of Lenox, Ferdinando Gorges, and others,
styling t1lemn, " The Council of Plymnouth, in the county
of Devon, for planting and governing New-England in
America." This patent granrited to them the territory between the 40th and 48th degrees of north latitude, and
was the founcation of all the subsequent patents which
divided the country.
VI. In March 1621, the colony of Plymouth, through
Governour Carver, entered into a league of friendship,
commerce, and m.utual defeince wit'lh Miasassoit, the great
sachem of the neighbouring Indians. This treaty, which
was strictly observed until the breakling out of Philip's
war, (a period of more than fifty years,) gave general
peace to thile colony, and laid thte foundation for their intimate and amicable correspond ence with the neighbouring
IIndian tribes.
The person, ch-iefly inastrumental in bringing this event to

the French commissioners, In violation of the treaty of Spain
with the United States, the intendant, by his proclamation of
October, 1802, forbade American citizens any longer to deposit
mnerchandize in the port of New-Orleans.
Upon receiving intelligence of this prohibition, great sensi
bilty prevailed in congress, and a proposition was made to occupy the place by force; but after an animated discussion the
project was relinquishled, and negotiations with Fra'nce were
comm'enced by JVr. Jefferson, for the purchase of the whole
country of Louisiana, which ended in an agreement to that
effect, signed at Paris, April 30th, 1803, by which the United
States were to pay to France fifteen millions of dollars.
Early in December, 1803, the commissioners of Spain delivered possession to France; and on the 20th of the same month
the authorities of France duly transferred the country to the
United States. Congress had provided for this event, and under their act, William C. C. Claiborne was appointed governour. By an act of March, 1804, that part of the ceded country. which lay south of the parallel of thirty-three degress was
separated from the rest, and called the Territory of Orleans. In
1811, this district was erected into a state, and in 1812, was
admitted into the Union bv the namne of Louisiana.
XI On the thlird of April, 181', congress passed an
act laying an embargo fITr ninety days on all vessels within the jurisdiction of the United States, agreeably to a recommendation of the president.  This measure, it was
understood was preparatory to a war with Great Britain,
which the executive would soon urge upon congress to declare,
XII. On the 4th of June, 1812, a bill declaring war
against Great Britain, passed the house of representatives,
by a majority of seventy-nine to forty-nine.  AIter a discussion of this bill in the senate till the l7tlb, it passed that
body also by a majority of nineteen to thirteen, and the
succeeding day, 1 8th,* received the signature of the president.
* The following are the ordes s in council, French decrees, and
the consequent acts of the American government, with their
respective dates, presented in onfie view.
T8062 May 16thi.lBritish blockade from the Elbe to Brest.The principal grounds of war, as set forth in a message
of the president to congress, June ist, and as farther explained by the committee on foreign relations in their report on the subject of the message, were summarily-The
impressment of American seamen by the British; the
blockade of her enemies' ports, supported by no adequate
force, in consequence.of wvhich the American commerce
had been plundered'in every sea, and the great staples of
the country cut off from their legitimate markets, and the
British orders in council.
On these grounds, the president urged the declaration of war.
In unison with the recommnendation of the president, the committee on foreign relations concluded their report as follows:' Yourcommittee, believing that the freeborn sons of America
are worthy to enjoy the liberty which their fathers purchased at
the price of much blood and treasure, and seeing by the measures adopted by Great Britain, a course commenced and persisted in, which might lead to a loss of national character and
independence, feel no hesitation in advising resistance by force,
in which the Americans of the present day will prove to the
enemy, and the world, that we have not only inherited that liberty which our fathers gave us, but also the will and power to

249maintain it. Relying on the patriotism of the nation, and con.
fidently trusting that the Lord of hosts will go with us to battle
in a righteous cause, and crown our efforts with success-your
committee recommend an immediate appeal to arms,"
Against this declaration of war, the minority in the house of
representatives, among which were found the principal part of
the delegation fronm New-England, in an address to their constituents, solemnly protested, on the ground that the wrongs of
which the United States complained, aithough in some respects
grievous, were not of a nature, in the present state of the world,
to justify war, or such as war would be likely to remedy.
On the subject of impressment, they urged thlat the question
between the two countries hlad once been honourably and satisfactorily settled, in the treaty negotiated with the British -court
by Messrs. Monroe and Pinclkney, and although that treaty had
not been ratified by Mr. Jefferson, the arrangements might
probably again be made. In relation to the second cause of
war-the blockade of her enemies' ports without an adequate
force-the minority replied that this was not designed to injure
the commerce of the United States, but was retaliatory upon
France, which had taken the lead in aggressions upon neutral
rights. In addition, it was said, that as the repeal of the French
decrees had been officially announced, it was to be expected
that a revocation of the orders in council would soon follow.
In conclusion of the protest- the minority spoke as follows:
"The undersigned cannot refrain from asking what are the
United States to gain by this war? Will the gratification of
some privateersmen compensate the nation for that sweep of
our legitimate commerce by the extended marine of our enemy, which this desperate act invites? Will Canada compensate the middle States for New-York; or the.western States
for New-Orleans? Let us not be deceived. A war of invasion may invite a retort of invasion. When we visit the peace
able, and to us innocent colonies of Great Britain with the hortours of war, can we be assured that our own coast will not be
visited with like horrours.
" At a crisis of the world, such as the present, and under impressions such as these, the undersiogned could not cpnsider the
war into which the United States have in secret been precipitated, as necessary, or required by any moral duty, or any political expediency."
As a difference of views respecting the war, which had now
been declared, prevailed in congress, so the country generally
was divided into two opposite parties respecting it. The friends
of the administration universally commending, and its opposers
as eteasivelv censuring and condemning the measure. By the            MADISON'S ADMINISTRATION.               25
former, the war was strenuously urged to be unavoidable and
lust; by the latter, with equal decision, it was pronounced to be
inpolitick, unnecessary, and unjust.
XIII. The military establishments of the United States,
upon the declaration of war, were extremely defective,
Acts of congress permitted the enlistment of twenty-five
thousand men, but few enlisted.   The president was
authorized to raise fifty thousand volunteers, and to
call out one hundred thousand militia, for the purpose of defending the sea-coast and the frontiers. But
the want of proper officers was now felt, as the ablest
revolutionary,heroes had paid the debt of nature. Such
was the situation of things at the commencemnent of hostilities.
XIV. August 16th, Gen. llull, governour of Michigan,
who had been sent at the head of about two thousand five
hundred men to Detroit, with a view of putting an end to
Indian hostilities in that country; surrendered his army
to Gen. Brock, without a battle, and with it the fort at
Detroit.
The sensations produced by this occurrence throughout the
United States, and particularly in the western country, can
scarcely be described. So entirely unprepared was the publick mind for his extraordinary event, that no one cbuld believe it to have taken place until communicated from an official
source.
In his official despatch, Hull took great pains to free his conduct from censure. Among the reasons for his surrender, and
those which determined him to that course, he assigned the
want of provision to sustain the siege, the expected reinforcements of the enemy, and the savage ferocity of the Indians,
should lie ultimately be obliged to capitulate.
The govermennt, however, not being satisfied with his excuses, ordered a court martial, before which he was charged
with treason, cowardice, and unofficerlike conduct. On the
first charge the court declined giving an opinion: on the two
last he was sentenced to death; but was recommended to mercy, in consequence of his revolutionary services, and his advanced age. The sentence was remitted by the president;but his name was ordered to be struck from the rolls of the
army.
XV. About the middle of August, that series of splen     11z ~ ~    PERIOD X...1809....1817.
did naval achievements, for whlich this war was distinguishied, was commienced by Capt. Isatac Hull, of the
United States' friigate Constitution, whio captured the
British frigate Guerriere, commanded by Capt. Dacres.
The American frigate was superiour in force only by a few
guns, but the difirence bore no comparison to the disparity oi
the conflict. The loss of the Constitution was seven killed,
and seven wounded, while that on board the Guerriere was fifteen killed, and sixty-three wounded, amrnong the latter was
Capt. Dacres. The Constitution sustained so little injury that
she was ready for action the succeeding day. But the British
frigate was so mnuch damaged that she was set on fire and burnt.
XVI. Upon the declaration of war, the attention of the
American general was turned towardcs the intvasion of
Canada, for which eight or ten thousand men, and considerable military stores were collected at different points
along the Canada line. Skilful officers of the navy were
also despatched for the purpose of arming vessels onl
Lake Erie, Ontario, and Champlain, if possible to gain
the ascendency thlere, and to aid the operations of the
American forces.
The American troops were distributed into three divisions-one under Gen. Harrison, called the Nortlh Western army; a second under Gen. Stephen Van Rensellaer,
at Lewistown, called the army of the Centre; and a third
under the commander in chief, Gen. Dearborn, in the
neighbourhood of Plattsbw g and Greenbush, called the
army of the North.
XVII. Early on the morning of the 13th of Octobert,
1812, a detachment of about one thousand men, from the
army of the Centre, crossed the river Niagara, and attack
ed the British on Queenstown heights. This detachmeint
under the command of Col. Solomon Van Rensellaer
succeeded in dislodging the enemy-but not being reinforced by the militia from the American side, as was expected, they were ultimately repulsed, and were obliged
to surrender. The Pritish Gen. Brock was killed during
the engagement.
The forces designated to storm the heights, were divided into
two columns: one of three hundred militia. under Col, v             MADISON'S ADMINISTRATION~            2
Rensellaer, the other of three hundred regulars, under Col.
Christie. These were to be followed by Col. Fenwick's artillery, and then the other troops in order.
Much embarrassment was experienced by the boats from the
eddies, as well as by the shot of the enemy, in crossing the river. Col. Van Rensellaer led the van, and landed first with
one hundred men. Scarcely had he leaped from the boat, when
he received four severe wounds. Being, however, able to
stand, he ordered his officers to move with rapidity and storm
the fort. This service was gallantly performed, and the enemny were driven down the hill in every direction.
Both parties were now reinforced-the Americans by regulars and militia-the British by the forty-ninth regiment, consisting of six hundred regulars, under Gen. Brock. Upon this
the conflict was renewed, in which Gen. Brock, and his aid,
Captain M'Donald, fell almost in the same moment. After a
desperate engagement, the enemy were repulsed, and the victory was thought complete.
Gen. Van Rensellaer now crossed over, for the purpose of
fortifyiig the heights, preparatory to another attack, should the
repulsed enemy be reinforced. This duty he assigned to Lieut.
Totten, an able engineer.
But the fortune of the day was not yet decided. At three
o'clock in the afternoon, the enemy, being reinforced by several hundred Chippewa Indiaais, rallied, and again advanced,
but were a third time repulsed. At this moment Gen. Van
Renseilaer, perceiving the militia on the opposite side embarking but slowly, hastily recrossed the river, to accelerate their
movements. But what was his chagrin, on reaching the American side, to hear more than twelve hundred of the mrilitia positively refuse to embark.  The sight of the engagement had
cooled that ardour which, previously to tile attack the commander in chief could scarcely restrain. While their countrymen were nobly struggling for victory, they could remain idle
spectators of the scene. All that a brave, resolute, and benevolent commanrder could do, Gen. Van Rensellaer did-he
urged, entreated, commanded, but it was all in vain.- Eight
hundred British soldiers, from Fort George, now hove in sight,
and pressed on to renew the attack. The Americans,' for a
time, continued to struggle against this force, but were finally
obliged to surrender themselves prisoners of war.
The number of Amnerican troops killed, amounted to about
sixty, and about one hundred were wounded. Those that surrendered themselves prisoners of war, including the wounded,
were about seven hundred. The loss of the British is unknowvn
but it mnust have been severe.Although the issue of this battlewas untbrtunate, seldom hs
Aimierican valour shone more conspicuously, or a victory been
relinquished with more reluctance. IHad but a small part of
thile "idle men" passed over at the critical moment, when urged
by their brave commander, revolutionary liistory can tell of
fewv nobler achievements than this would have been.
XVIII. Ont the 1Tth of October, anothier nav`al,victory
was achieved over an enemny decidedly superiour in force,
and under circumnstances the most favourable to him.
This was the Capture of the brig Frolick, of twenty-two
guns, by the sloop of war Wasp.
Captain Jones had retiurned from France two weel:s after
the declaration of war, and on the 13th of October, again put
to sea. On the 17th he fell in with six merchant ships, under
convoy of a brig, and two ships armed with sixteen guns each,
The brig, which proved to be the Frolick, Capt. Whinyates,
dropped behind, while the others made sail. At half past eleyen, the action began by the enemy's cannon and musketry.
In five minutes, the main-top-mast i;as shot away, and falling
down, with the main-top-sail yard across the larboard fore and
fore-top-sail, rendered her head yards unmanageable, during the
rest of the action. In two minutes more, her gaff, and mizen
top-gallant-mast wvere shot away. The sea being exceedingly
roughl, the muzzles of the Wasp9s guns were sometimes ulnder
water.
Trhe English fired as their vessel rose, so that their shot was
either thrown away, or touched only the rigging of the Americans; tle Wasp, on the contrary, fired as she sunk, and ey:ery
timne struck the lull of her antagonist. The fire of the Frolick
was soon slackened, and Capt. Jones determined to board her.
As the crew leaped.on board the enemy's vessel, their surprise
can scarcely be imagined, as they found no person on deck,
except three officers and tihe seaman at the wheel. The dech
was slippery with blood, and presented a scene of havock and
ruin. The officers now threwdown their swords in submission.
and Lieut. Riddle, of the Wasp, leaped into the rigging, tohaul
down the colours, which were still flyiing. Thus, in forty-three
minutes, ended one of the most bloody conflicts recorded. in
naval history. The loss, on board the Frolick, was thirty killed, and fifty wounded; on board the Wasp, five were killed
andfive slightly wounded. The Wasp and Frolick were both
captured the same day, by a British seventy-four, the Poictiers,
Capt. Beresford.
XIX. The above splendclid achievement of Capt. Jones
was followed on the 25th of October by another not much2,54            MADISON'S ADMAINISTRATION.              255
less splendid and decisive, by Commodore Decatur; of
the frigate United States of forty-four guns, who captured
the Macedonian off the Western Isles, a frigate of the largest class, mounting forty-nine guns, and manned with
three hundred men.
In this action, which continued an hour and a half, thie Macedonian lost thirty-six killed, and sixty-eight wounded: on board
the United States, seven only were killed, and five wounded.
The British frigate lost her main-mast, main-top-mast,' and
main-yard, and was injured in her hull. The United States
suffered so little that-a return to port was unnecessary.
An act of generosity and benevolence on the part of our
brave tars, of this victorious frigate, deserves to be hononrably
recorded. The carpenter, who was unfortunrately killed in the
conflict with the Macedonian, had left three small children to
the care of a worthless mother. When the circumstance became known to the brave seamen, they instantly made a Contribution amongst themselves, to the amount of eight hundred
dollars, and placed it in safe hands, to be appropriated to the
education and maintenance of the unhappy'orphans
XX, December the 29th a second naval victorv was
achieved by the Constitution, thlen commanded by Corn.
Bainbridge, over the Java, a British frigate of thirty-eight
guns, but carrying forty-nine, with four hundred men,
commanded by    Capt. Lambert, who was mortally
wounded.
This action was fought off St. Salvador, and continued nearly
two hours, when the Java struck, having lost sixty killed and
one hundred and twenty wounded. The Constitution had nine
men killed and twenty-five wounded. On the 1st of January,
the commander, finding his prize incapable of being brought in,
was obliged to burn her.
XXI. Thus ended the year 1812. With the exception of the naval victories already mentioned, and some
others of the same kind, equally honourable to America,
nothing important was achieved. Neither of the armies
destined for the invasion of Canada had obtained any decisive advantage, or were in possession of any post in
that territory.  Further preparations, however, were
making for its conquest. Naval armaments were collecting on the lhkes; and the soldiers, in their winter quarters,were looking forward to "battles fought and victories
won."
XXII. 1813.    January 22d, a bloody action was
fought at the river Raisin, between a detachment from the
north-western army, exceeding seven hundred and fifty
men, under Gen. Winchester, and a combined force of
British and Indians, amounting to one thousand five hundred men, under Gen. Proctor. Many of the Americans
were killed and wounded. Among the former was Gen.
Winchester. The remnainder, on surrendering themselves
prisoners of war, were nearly all inhumanly massacred
by the Indians, contrary to the express stipulations of
Gen. Proctor.
The station of General Harison, the commander of the northwestern army, was at this time at Franklinton. General Winchester was stationed at Fort Defiance, half way between
Fort Wayne on the Miami, and Lake Erie, with eight hundred
troops, chiefly young men, of the first respectability, from Kentucky. Learning that a body of British and Indians was about
to concentrate at Frenchtown, on the river Raisin, he.sent a
detachment to protect that place. Before the arrival of the
detachment, Frenchtown was occupied by a party of the enemy, but they were dislodged after a severe engagement, in
which the Americans had twelve killed, and fifty-five wounded.
On the 20th, General Winchester joined the detachment at
Frenchtown, with the remainder of his troops, and, on the 22d,.
the battle of Raisin was fought. After a desperate conflict, in
which many on both sides were killed, the Americans surrendered, with the express stipulation'of being protected from the
Indians.
Contrary, however, to these stipulations, the.savages were
permitted to indulge their full thirst for blood. The tomahawk
was mercilessly buried in many a bosom. and the scalping knife
wantonly tore the crown from many a head.
Even the last sad rites of sepulture were forbidden, by their
murderers, and the remains of these brave youth of Kentucky
lay on the ground, beat by the storms of Heaven, and exposed
to the beasts of the forest, until the ensuing autumn, when their
friends and relations ventured to gather up their bleaching
bones, and consigned to thle tomb.
XXIII. During the winter, an engagement took place
between the Hornet,. Captain James Lawrence, and the
British sloop of war Peacock, Captain William Peake of}            MADISON'S ADMINISTRATION,              257
South America. This action lasted but fifteen minutes,
when the Peacock struck.
On her surrendering, a signal of distress wvas discovered, on
board the Peacock. She had been so much damaged, that, already, she had six feet of water in her hold, and was sinking
fast.  Boats were immediately despatched for the wounded,
and every measure taken which was practicable, to keep her
afloat until the crew could be removed. Her guns were thrown
overboard, the shot holes were plugged, and a part of the Hornet's crew, at the imminent hazard of their lives, laboured incessantly to rescue the vanquished. The utmost efforts of these
generous men were, however, in vain; the conquered vessel
sunk in the midst of them, carrying down nine of her own crew,
and three of the Americans. With a generosity becominr
them, the crew of the Horniet divided their clothing with tlhe
prisoners, who were left destitute by the sinking ship. In the
action the Hornet received but a slight iljury. The killcd and
wounded on board the Peacock were supposed to exceed fifty.
XXIV. On the fourth of March, 1813, Mr. Mladison
entered upon his second term of oflice, as president of tlhe
United States; having been re-elected by a considerable
majority, though De Witt Clinton  of New-York, was
supported by the federal electors. George Clinton was
elected vice president  he died, however, soon after, aind
Elbridge Gerry succeeded Ilim.
XXV. It having been cotmmunicated to the American
government that the empercur of Russia was desirouIs of
seeing an end put to the hostilities between Great Britain
and America, arnd had offered to mediate between tlhe
two countires, Messrs. Albert Gallatina James A. Bayard,
and John Quincy Adams, were, early'i, the spring, 1813
appointed commissioners to Rossia, to 1meet such comrmissioners as should be sent by the -3ritish claurt, and were
empowered to negotiate a treaty of peace and conmmerce
with Great Britain.
XXVI. During the winter which had now passed,
Great Britain sent a number of troops to Halifax, and
made considerable preparations for thel delfence of Canada. Simnilar preparations hlad been urgecd by the American governiient, with the hope of completing the conq,le;st
of that territory, before the close of an,lher campaclgn.

by calling out as hle entered their village, "Welcome English.
men! Welcome Englishmen!" He had conversed with the
English fishermen who had come to the eastern coast, and had
learned some of the language. He informed the colony that
the place where they were settled, was called by the Indians
Patuxet; that five years before a plague had swept off all the
natives from the place, so that there was neither man, woman,
nor child remaining. Providence had thus singularly prepared
the way for the colonies to take possession of the land, without
molesting a single owner.
Samoset, having been treated with hospitality by thlese stran
gers, was disposed to cultivate a iurther acquaintance with
them; and on his third visit was accompanied by Squanto, a
native of the countrv, who had been carried away in 1614, by
one Hunt, and sold inato Spain, but had been takein to London
whlence he had returned to America.
They informed the English that lasassoit, the greatest sa
e:c: of the neighbouring Indians, was near with a guard of. - men. Mutual distrust preventhd for some time any ad.
(ances from either side. But Squanto, who was at length sent
to Masassoit, returned, saying that the sachem wished the English to send some one to confer with him. Mr. Edward Win.,
slow was accordingly sent, bearing suitable presents to the
chief. These proving acceptable, Masassoit left Mr. Winslow
in the custody of his men as a hostage, and ventured to the En-,
glish, by whom he was hospitably en tertained, and with whom
he concluded the treaty already noticed.
VII. In 1619, a governour general of the Virginia Co~
iony arrived from England, with instructions to convoke
a colonial legislature.  To this assembly eleven corporations or townrs, sent reprLesentatives who sat with the governour and council, appointed by the Company..'Adis
was the first legislature to which the American people sent
representatives.
In 1621, the London Company established a constitution and form of government for the colony.  The powers
of this government were vested in a governour and two
councils. One of these was called the council of state, to
advise and assist the governour.  This council was to be
appointed and removed by the company.   The other was
called the general I assembly, consisting of the council of
state and two burgesses, or representatives, deputed firom
each toMn-- hunXdred, or plantationm.This assemby n,.,About the middle of April, the commander in chlel,
Gen. Dearborn, determined to attack York, the capital of
Upper Canada, the great depository of British military
stores, whence the western ports were supplied. Accord
ingly, on the 27th, a successful attack was made, and
York fell into the hands of the Americans, with all it#
stores.
The command of the troops, one thousand seven hundred, de
tached for this purpose, was given to Gen. Pike. On the 25th,
the fleet, under CommodQre Chauncey, moved down the lake,
with the troops fromn Sackett's HIarbour, and on the 27th, ar~
rived at the place of debarkation, about two miles westward
from York, and one and a hlalf from the enemies' works. The.i.tisd, consisting of about seven hundred and fifty regulars,
and five hundred Indians, under General Sheaffe, attempted to
oppose the landing, but were thrown into disorder, and fled to
their garrison.
Gen. Pike, having formed his men, proeepded towards the
enemies' fortifications. On their near approach to the barracks,
about sixty rods from the garrison, an explosion of a magazine
took place, pre;viously prepaled for the purpose, which killed
about one bundredd of thle Amihericans, among whom was the
gallant Pikte.
Pike liv ed to direct hIis troops, for a moment thrown into dis.
order, "; to move on." This they now did under Col. Pearce;
and proceeding towards the tows., took possession of the barracks. On approaching it, they v;ere met by the officers of the
Canada militia, with offers of capitulation. At four o'clock the
troops entered the town.
The loss of the Britishl in kfilled, wounded, and prisoners,
amounted to seven hundred and fifty-the Americans lost, in
killed and wounded. a:bout three hundred.
XXVII.'During thie remrnainder of the spring, the war
continued along the Canada line, and on some parts of
the sea board; bur nothing important was achieved by
either power.  The Chlesapeake Bay was blockaded by
the British, antd predatory excursions, by their troops.
were made at Havre De Grace Georgetown, &amp;c. Sevre
ral villages wvere burnt, and much property plundered ana
destroyed.
To the northt of the Chesapeake, the coast was not exempt from the effects of the wiar  A strict blockade waskept up at New-York. The American frigates United
States and Macedonian, and the sloop Hornet, attempted
to sail on a crulse from that port, about the beginning of
May, but were prevented.  In another attempt, they were
chased into New-London harbour where they were blockaded by a fleet under Commodore Hardy, for many
months. Fort George, in Canada, was taken by the
Americans. Sackett's Harbour was attacked by one thousand British, who were repelled with considerable loss.
XXVIII. On the first of June, the American navy experienced no inconsiderable loss, in the capture of the
Chesapeake, by the Britishl frigate Shannon, off Boston
harbour-a loss the more severly felt, as on board of her
fell several brave officers,'among whom was her commander, the distinguished and lamented Capt. Lawrence.
Capt. Lawrence had been but recently promoted to the command of the Chesapeake. On his arrival at Boston to take
charge of her, he was informed that a British frigate was lying
off the harbour, apparently inviting an attack.-Prompted by
the ardour which pervaded the service, he resolved to meet the
enemy, without sufficiently examining his strength. With a
crew, chiefly enlisted for the occasion, as that of the Chlesapeake had mostly been discharged, on the first of June he
sailed out of the harbour.
The Shannon observing the Chesapeake put to sea, immediately followed. At half past five, the two ships engaged. By
the first broadside, the sailing master of thle Chesapeake was
killed, and Lieut. Ballard mortally.wounded: Lieut. Brown
and Capt. Lawrence were severely woufided at the same time.
A second and third broadside, besides adding to the destruction
of her officers, so disabled the Chesapeake in her rigging, that
her quarter fell on the Shannon7s anchor. This accident may
be considered as deciding the contest; an opportunity was
given the enemy to rake the Chesapeake, and, toward the close
of the action, to board hler. Capt. Lawrence, thoughl severely
wounded, still kept the' deck. In the act of summoning' the
boarders, a musket ball entered his body, and brought him
down.:As he was carried below, he issued A last heroick order, "Dot giv.e up the ship;" but it was too late to retrieve what
was lost the British boarders leaped into the vessel, and after
a short, but bloody struggle, hoisted the British flag.
In this sanguinary conflict, twenty-three of tlhe eniemy wera'.g260             PERIOD X.... 1809....:1817.
killed, and ifty wounded; on board the Chesapeake about
seventv were killed, and eighty-three wounded.
XXIX. The tide'of fortune seemed now, for a short
time, to turn in favolur of Great Britain. On the 14th of
August, the Argus, of eighteen guns, another of our national vessels, was captured by the Pelican of twenty~guns.
The Argus had been employed to carry ouat Mr. Crawford,
as minister, to France. After landing him, she proceeded to,
cruise in the Britisl channel, and,Cfor two months, greatly annoyed the British shipping. At length that government was
induced to senrd several vessels in pursuit of her. On the 14th
August, the Pelican, a sloop of war of superior force, discovered her, and btre down to,action. At the first broadside Capt.
Allen fell, severely wounded, but remained on deck for some
time, when it was necessary'to carry him below. After a hard
fought action, the Argus was obliged to surrender, with a loss
of six killed and seventeen wounded. On board the Pelican
there were but three killed anid five wounded. Capt. Allen
died soon after, in England, and was interred with the honours
of war.
XXX. After the loss of the Chesapeake and Argus
victory again returned tothe side of America.  On the 5th
of September following, the British brig Boxer surrendered to the Enterprize, after an engagement of little more
than half an ihoutr.
The Enterprize sailed from Portsmouth on the 1st, and was
on the 5th descried by the Boxer, whichl immediately gave
chase. After the action had continued for fifteen minutes, the
Enterprize ranged ahead, and raked her enemy so powerfully,
that in twenty minutes the firing ceased, and the cry of quarter
was heard;  The Enterprize had one killed and thirteen
wounded; but that one was he) lamented commander, Lieutenant Burrows. He fll at the commnencement of the action,
but continued to cheer his crew, averring that the flag should
never be struck. When the sword of thle enemny was presented
to him, he exclaimed, " 1 die contented." The British loss was
more considerable.  Among their killed was Captain Blytheo
T'hese two commanders, both in the morning of life, were interred beside eachl other at Portland, with military honours.
XXXI. During these occurrentces on the sea board,
important preparations had been made for decisive mea'
sures to the westward, and the general attention was row
turned. with great anxie'ly to th. {e emovements of the northwestern army, and the fleet under command of Commodore Perry, on Lake Erie.
This anxiety, not long after, was, in a measure, dispelled by a decisive victory of the American fleet, over that
of the British, on Lake Erie, achieved, after a' long and
desperate conflict, on the o10th of September.
The American squadron consisted of nine vessels, carrying
fifty-four guns, that of the British, of six vessels and sixty-three
guns. The line of battle was formed at eleven, and at a quarter before twelve, the enemy's flag ship, Queen Charlotte,
opened a tremendous fire upon the Lawrence, the flag ship of
Commodore Perry, which was sustained by the latter, ten min.
utes before she could bring her carronades to bear. At length
she bore up and engaged the enemy, making signals to the remainder of the squadron to hasten to her support. Unfortunately the wind was too light to admit of a compliance with the.order, and she was compelled to contend, for two hours, witli
two ships of equal force. By this time the brig had become
unmanageable, and her crew, excepting four or five, were
either killed or wounded.
While thus surrounded with death,-and destruction still
pouring in upon him, Perry left the brig, now only a wreck, in
an open boat; and heroically waving his sword, passed unhurt
to the Niagara, of twenty guns. The wind now rose. Ordering every canvass to be spread, he bore down upon the enemy
-passing the enemy's vessels, Detroit, Queen Charlotte, and
Lady Prevost, on the one side, and the Chippewa, and Little
Belt, on the other, into each of which, he poured a broadside
he at length engagedthe Lady Prevost, which received so heavy
a fire as to compel her men tco retire below.
The remainder of the American squadron, now, one after another, arrived, and followving the example oftheir intrepidleader,
closed in with the enemry, and the battle became general.
Three hours finished the contest, and enabled, Perry to announce to Gen. Harrison the capture of the whole squadron,
which he did, in this modest. laconick, and emphatick style:
6"We have met the enemy, and they are ours."
The loss in the contest was great in proportion to the numbers
eng'aged' The Americans had twenty-seven killed and ninetysix wounded. But the British loss was still greater, beinig about
two hundred in killed and wounded. The prisoners amounted
to six hundied, exceeding the whole number of Americans engaged in the action.

Erie, but Detroit and Malden were in possession of tile
British (Ge,e- 1 Proctor.  Against thse Gen. IHarrison,
commander of the north-western army, now resolved to
direct his forces.
Col. Johnson, with a body of Kentuckians, was despatched against Detroit.  Gen. Hlarrison with his troops,
repaired on board the fleet, and the same day reached
Malden. The British general, however, destroyed Malden, and retired with his forces.
Finding Malden destroyed, --larrison next determined
to proceed in pursuit of Proctor.  On the 2d of October,
with about two thousand five hundred men, selected for
the pulrpose, he commenced a rapid marchi, and, on the
5thl, reached the place where the enemy had encamped
the night before.  Col. Johnson, who had joined Gen.
Harrison, vas sent forward to reconnoitre the enemy, and
soon returned with the information that they had made a
stand a few mrniles dclistant, and were ready for action.
The American troops. were now' formed in order ot
battle. The armies engaged, and, for a time, the strife
raged with fury. Providence;,however, gave to the Ame
ricans a decisive victorvy and Detroit fell into their hands
In this engagement, the loss of the British was nineteen regu
lars killed, fifty wounded, and about six hundred prisoners
The Indians left one hundred and twenty on the field. The
loss of the Americans did not exceed fifty.
In this battle were enmaged one thousand two hundred, oronD&amp;
thousand five hundred Indians, led on by Tecumseh, a savage
warriour, than whom the annals cf history can searcely boast a
greater. Since tle defeat- of Harrner he had'een in a.lmostevery
engagement with the whites. On the opening of the late war,
he visited various tribes, and, by his eloquence and influence,
roused his countrymen to arms a.-nirst the United States.
XXXIII. Tlhe fall of Detro:it put an end to thle Indian
war in that qu,arter, and gave security to the frontiers.
Gen. Harrison now dismissed a greater part of his volunteers, and having stationed Gen. Cass at Detroit, with
about one thousand men, proceeded.5 according to his instructions, with the remainder of his forces, to Buffllo to
join the army of the centre.XXXIV. The result of the operations of the northwest, and the victory on Lake Erie, prepared the way to
attempt a more effectual invasion of Canada.
Gen. Wilkinson was now commanding the American
forces in the north, Gen. Dearborn having some timne before retired on account of ilidisposition. The force destined for the contemplated invasion of Canada, amounurted
to twelve thousand mnen,-eigi-it thousand of whom were
stationed at Niagara, and four thousand at Plattsburg, un--
der the ccmmand of Gen. Hampton.-In addition to these
forces, those under Gen. I-larrison were expected to arrive in season to fiurnish' important assistance.
The outline of the plan which had been adcopted, was to
descend the St. Lawrence, passing the British forts above
and, after a junction with Gen. Hampton, at some designated point on tl-he river, to proceed to the Island of
Motitreal.  Unexpected difficulties, however, occurred,
which prevented the execution of' this plan, and the American forces retired into winter quarters at St. Regis.
Gen. Wilkinsonconcentrated his forces at Grenadiers'Island,
between Sackett's Harbour and Kingston, one hundred and
eighty miles from Mont5e.l, by the way of the river. This place
the army left, on the 25th of October, on board the fleet, and
descended the St. Lawrence, sanguine in the expectation of
subduing Montreal.
On thearrival of the flotilla at Williamsburg, November 9th,
one thousanrd five hundred men, of Gen. Boyd's brigade, were
lainded with a view to cover the boats in their passage through
the rapids. On the 1 lth ani engagement took place, which continued two hours, between this detachment of the American
army and a detachment of the British under Lieut. Col. Morrison.-Both parties claimed the victory, but it was, properly, a
drawnbattle, the British retiringto thelr encampments, and the
Americans to their boats. The loss of the British is not ascertained, that of the Americans, in killed and wounded, was
three hundred and thirty-nine. Among the latter was Gen.
Carirington, iho died of his wounds.
A few days previous to this battle, as Gen. Harrison had not
P.rrived, Gere. WVilkinson despatched orders to Gen. HIampton
to meet him at St. Regis. To these orders, Gen. Hampton replied, that it was irnpracticable to comnply with themn. On the
receipt of this communlication, a council of officers was called)264             PERIOD X...;$09....1817.
which advised to abandon the project and to retire. Accord5
ingly, Gen. Wilkinson ordered a retreat, and selected French
Mills, as the winter quarters of his army. The troops of Gen
Hampton soon followed this example.
Thus ended a campaign which gave rise to dissatisfac
tion, proportioned to the highl expectations that had beeia
indulged of its success. Publick opinion was much divided
as to the causes of-its fiailure, and as to the parties to whomn
the blame was properly to be attached.
XXXV. The proposal of the eniperor of Russia to
miediate between the United States and Great Britain, with
reference to an amicable adjustmient of their differences,
and the appointment of Messrs. Gallatin, Adams, and Bayard, as commissioners under that proposal, have been mentioned. This proposal, however, Great Britain thought
expedient to decline; but the prince regent offered a direct negotiation, either at London or Gottenburg.
The offer was no sooner communicated to our governrnent, than accepted, and Messrs. Hlenry Clay, Jonathan
Russel, and Albert Gallatin, were appointed in addition to
the commissioners already in Europe, and soon after sailed
for Gottenburg. Lord Gambier, Henry Goulbourn, and
William Adams, were appointed on the part of the court of
St. James, to meet them. The place of their meeting was
first fixed at Gottenburg, hut subsequently was changed to
Ghent, in Flanders, where the commissioners assembled in
August.
XXXVI. The spring of 1814 was distinguished for the
loss of the American frigate Essex, Commodore David
Porter, which was captured on the 28th of March, in the
bay of Valparaiso, South America, by a superioisr Britishi
force.
XXXVII. Towards the close of April, after an action
of forty-two minutes, the British brig Epervier surrendered
to the Peacock. Fort Erie was taken from the British,
early in July, and during the same month, sanguinary bat-,
ties were fought at Chippewa and Bridgewater.
In the battle of Bridgewater, or Niagara, Generals Brown
and Scott commanded the Americans; Generals Drummond
and. Riall the British. The hattle lasted fr'om folr o'clock, P.             MADISON'S ADMINISTRATION.               265
M. till mldnight. The British loss was nine hundred in kdlled,
wounded, and prisoners; the loss of the Americans did not exceed one hundred. The former were obliged to retire.
XXXVIII. While these events were transpiring in the
north, the publick attention was irresistibly drawn to the
movements of the enemy on the sea-board. About the
middle of August, between fifty and sixty sail of the British
arrrived in the Chesapeake, with troops destined for the
attack of Washington, the capital of the United States. On
the 23d of August, six thousand British troops, commnanded by Geni. Ross, forced their way to that place, burnt the
capitol, president's house and executive offices.
Having thus accomplished an object Iiiglily disgraceful
to the Britishl arms, and wantonly burned publick buildings,
the ornament and pride of the nation, the destruction of
which could not hasten the termination of the war-on the
25th they retired, and, by rapid marches, regained their
shipping, having lost, during the expedition, nearly one
thousand men.
The troops, under Gen. Ross, were landed at Benedict, on
the Pawtuxet, forty-seven miles fromn Washington.  On the
21st, they moved toward Nottingham, and, the following day,
reached Marlborough. A British flotilla, commanded by Cockburn, consisting of launches and barges, ascended the river at
the same time, keeping on the right flankl of the army. The
day following, on approaching the American flotilla of Com.
Barney, which had taken refuge high up the river, twelve miles
from Washington, some sailors left on board the flotilla for the
purpose, should it be necessary, set fire to it, and fled.
On the arrival of the British army at Bladensburg, six miles
from Washington, Gen. Winder, comnmander of the American
forces, chiefly mnilitia collected for the occasion, ordered them to
engage the enemy. The principal part of the militia, however,
fled, at the opening of the contest. Commodore Barney, with
a few eighteen pounders, and about four hundred men, made a
gallant resistance; but being overpowered by numbers, and
himself wounded, he and a part of his brave band were compelled to surrender themselves prisoners of war.
From Bladensburg, Gen. Ross urged his march to Washington, where he arrived at about 8 o'clock in the evening. Having
stationed his main body at the distance of a mile and a half
from the capitol, he entered the city, at the head of about seven
hundred men, soon after which, he issued his orders for the con2$11flagration of the publick buildings. Witlh the capitol were consumed its valuable libraries, and all the furniture, and articles of
taste and value in that and in the other buildings. The great
bridge across the Potomack was burnt, together with an elegant
hotel, and other privt.te buildibns.
XXXIX.'The capture of Washington was followed,
September 12thl by an attack on Baltilore, in which the
Americanil forces, militia  and inhabitants of Baltimorep
made a gallant defence.  Being, however, overpowered by
a superiour force, they were compelled to retreat; but they
fought so valiantly, that the attemnpt to gain possession of
the city was abandoned by the enemy, who, during the
nigh't of Tuesday, 1Sth, retired to their shipping, having
lost among their killed, Gen. RGss, the commander in chief
of the British troops.
The British army, after the capture of Washington, having
re-embarked on board tie fleet in the Pawtuxent, Admiral Cochrane mnoved down that river, and proceeded up the Chesapeake.
On the morning of the 1 th of September, he appeared at the
mouth of the Patapsco, fourteen miles fromn Baltimore, with a
fleet of ships of war and transperts, amrnounting to fifty sail.
On the next day, 1 th, lan forces, to th.e number of six thousand, were landed at North Point, and, under the commanid of
Gen. Ross, commenced their mnarch towards the city. ln'anticipation of the landing of the troops, Gen. Stricker was despatched with three thousand two hundred men from Baltimore, to
keep the ene,my in check.
On the 12th, a battle was fought by the two armies. Early
in the engagement, a considerable part of Gen. Stricker's troops
retreated in confusion, leaving him scarcely one thousand four
hundred men, to whom was opposed thle whole body of the
enemy. An incessant fire was continued from half past two
o'clock, till a little before four, when Gen. Stricker, finding the
contest unequal, and that the enemy outflanked him, retreated
upon his rezerve, which was effected in good order.
The loss of thle Americans, in killed and wounided, amounted
to one hundred and sixty-three, airong whom were some of the
most respectable citizens of Baltimore.
The enemy made his appearance, the next mrorning,, in front
of the American entrenchments, at a distance of two miles from
the city, showing an intention of renewing the attack.
In the meantime, an attack was made on fort M'JHenry, from
frigates, bombs, and rocket vessels, which continued through             MIADISON'S ADMIATtSTRATIONo           267
the day, and the greater part of the night, do ng, however, but
liih!e damage.
In the course of the night of Tuesday, Admniral Cochrane
held a communication with the commander of the laud forces,
and the enterprise of taking the city being deemed impracticable, the troops were re-embarked, and the next day the fleet
descended the bay, to the great joy of the released inhabitants.
XL. Du-ilg these troubles in the soith, the enemny were
far from being inactive in other parts of the United States.
August 14th, Fort Erie was attacked by the British, commanded by Lieut. Gen. Drumnmond; but, atter a severe
engagement, they were repulsed, with a loss of six hundred, in killed, and wounded, and prisoners. rThe American loss was two hundred and forty-five.
September 1st, the British took possession of Castine,
in Maine, as some time before they had taken Eastport, a
town situated on one of the islands of thle bay of Passammaqutioddy. About this timne, also, the seaports aloing the
s,hores of New-England being seriously threatened, the
militia were called out by the authorities of the States borderintg on the sound, to repel the expected foe~
XLI. The joy experienced in all parts of the United
States on account of the brave defence of Baltimore, had
scarcely subsided, when intelligence was received of the
signal success of the Americans at Plattsburg, and on Lake
Champlain.  The armyof Sir George Prevost, amounting
to fourteen thousand men, was compelled by General Macomb, to retire fromin the former, and the enreroys squadron,
commanded by Commodore Downie, was captured by
Comnmodore Mlacdonough on the latter.
Towards the close of the winter of 1814, General Wilkinson,
with his armny, removed from tlheir winter quarters at St. Regis,
and took station at Plattsburg. Gen. Wilkinson leaving the
command of the army, Gert. Macomb succeeded him at this
place.  By September, the troops at Plattsburg were diminished by detachments, withdrawn to other stations, to one thousand five hundred men.
In this state of the forces, it was announced that Sir George
Prevost, governour-general of Canada, with an army of fourteen thousand men, completely equipped, and accompanied by       PERIOD IH....1607....I681....SETTLEMENTS.  25
ainually, and were entrusted with the business of framing
laws for the colony, the governour having a negative upon
their proceedings. No laws were valid until ratified by
a court of the company in England.
In 1622, the Virgintia Colony, which for some time had
enjoyed great prosperity, and had received frequent accessions,, experienced a stroke which nearly proved fatal.
The successor of Powhatan, who was of a proud,revengeful spirit, and extremely hostile to the colony, concerted
a plan to cut them off at a blow. On the 22d of March, it
was so far put in execution, that three hundred and fortyseven of the colony, men, women, and children, were
butchered almost in the same instanit.
A war of extermination soon succeeded, which not long
after was followed by a famine. The losses of the colony, however, which these calamities had brought upon
them, were soon in a measure repaired, by the arrival of
new adventurers.
VIII. While the Virginians were morOning their losses,
the Plymouth colony began to experience the distresses
of famine. By the time their planting was finished in
1623, their provisions were so fdr exhausted, that they
had neither bread nor corn for three or four months. A
drought continued from Alay, until some timne in July.
Under these afflictions, however, they appointed a day of
fasting and prayer, to humble themselves, and to seek unto God. Notwithstanding thleir many fears, a plentifil
harvest followed, which was suitably noticed by a day of
thanksgiving and praise.
IX. This year, 1623, a nunmber of persons from England arrived in the river Piscataqun, and began two set.
tlements; olne at the mouth, at a place called Little Harbour, the other at a place now called Dover.-These
were the first settlements in NEw-HAMPsmIIRE.
X. In 1624, the London Company, which had settled
Virginia, was dissolved by an act of king Janmes I. undel
pretext of the calamities which had,befallen the colony,
and the dissensions which hlacl agiated the company
3a numerous train of artillery, was about making a descent on
Plattsburg.
At this time, both the Americans and British had a respecta
ble naval force on lake Champlain; but that of the latter was
considerably the superior, amnounting to ninety-five guns, and
one thousand and fifty men, while the American squadron carried but eighty-six guns, and eight hundred and twenty.six men.
On the 11 th of September, while the Amierican fleet was lying
off Plattsburg, the British squadron was observed bearing
down upon it in order of battle.
Comn. Macdonough, ordering his vessels cleared for action,
gallantly received the enemy. An engagement ensued, which
lasted two hours and twenty minutes. By this time, the enemy
was silenced, and one frigate, one brig, and two sloops of war
fell into the hands of the Americans. Several British galleys
were sunk and a few others escaped. The loss of the Americans was fifty-two killed, and fifty-eight wounded; of the British, eighty-four killed, and one hundred and ten wounded.
Previously to this eventful day, Sir George Prevost, with his
army, arrived in the vicinity of Plattsburg. In anticipation of
this event, Gen. Macomb made every preparation which time
and means allowed, and called in to his assistance considerable
numbers bf the militia.
In the sight of these two armies, the rival squadrons commenced their contest. And, as if their engagement hiad been a preconcerted signal; and as if to raise still higher the solemn grandeur of the scene; Sir George Prevost now,led up his forces
against the American works, and began throwing upon them,
shells, balls, and rockets.
At the same time, the Amnericans opened a severe and destructive fire from their forts. Before sunset, the temporary batteries of Sir George Prevost were all silenced, and every attempt of the enemy to cross from Plattsburg to the American
works was repelled.  At nine o'clock, perceiving the attainment of his object impracticable, the British general hastily
drew off his forces, diminished by killed, wounded and deserted, two thousand five hundred. At the same tinie he abandoned vast quantities of military stores, and left the inhabitants oi
Plattsburgh to take care of the sick and wounded of his army,
and the "star-spangled banner" to wave in triumph, over the
waters of Champlain.
XI,1II. It has been already noticed, that the New-England representatives in congress, as well as a great portion of the people in that section of the country, were early
and strongly opposed to the war with Great Britain. During the progress of the war, this opposition continued, and
became confirmed. Enlistments of troops into the army
from this quarter were, therefore, fewer than undei other
circumstances might have been expected.  Dissensions
also arose between the general and state governments respecting the command of the militia, called out by order
of thie former, to defend the sea-board. Great dissatisfaction prevailed from an apprehensibn that the affairs of the
general government were mismanaged,. and to many, it
appeared that a crisis was forming, which, unless seasonably provided against, mnight involve the country in ruin.
Such apprehensions for the political safety extensively
prevailing throughout New-England, it was deemed inportant, by those who felt for them, to take measures to
remove ublick grievances, and to provide against antici~
pated evils.
Accordingly, on the 8th of October, 1814, at an extra
session of the M'assachusetts Legislature, a committee, to
whom was referred the speech of thle governour, (Strong,)
in the conclusion of their report, recomminended the appointment of" delegates to meet and confer with delegates
trom the States of New-England, or any of them, upon
the subjects of their publick grievances and concerns"
"and also to take measures, if they shall think proper,
for procu?ring a convenrtion of -delegates from all the United
States, in order to revise the constitution thereof, and more
effectually to secuime the support and attachment of all the
people, by placing all upon the basis oCf tfair representa,
tion.:
This resolution met with a spirited opposition from a
iespectable minority, bothl in the senate and house of representatives-but finally passed. Delegates were accordingly chosen. This example was -followed by RhodeIsland and Connecticut.  Vermont refused, and NewHamnpshilre neglected to sen,d.
On the 15th of Decemnber, these delegates, together
withi two elected by counlties in New-Ilampshire, and one
similarly electe'd in Veirnmot, rnet at 91-T1atford. After a..269session of near three weeks, they published a report, irn
which, after dwelling upon the publick grievances felt by
the New-England States-particularly, and by the country
at large in no small degree, they proceeded to suggest several alterations of the federal constitution, with a view to
their adoption by the respective states of the Union.
These alterations consisted of seven articles--first, that re-'
presentatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned to the number of free persons;--secondly, that no new State shall be admitted into the union without the concurrence of two thirds of
both houses;-thirdly, that congress shall not have power to
lay an embargo for mnore than sixty days;-fourthly, that congress shall not interdict commercialintercourse,withoutthe concurrence of two thirds of both houses;-fifthly, that' war shall
not be declared without the concurrence of a similar majority;
sixthly, that no person who shall be hereafter naturalized, shall
be eligible as a member-of the sellate or house cf representatives, or hold any civil office under the authority of the United
States; and seventhly, that no person shall be elected twice to
the presidency, nor the president be elected from the same
State two terms in succession.
The report of the convention concluded with a resolution, providing for the calling of another covention, should
the United States " refuse their consent to some arrangement whereby the N w-England States, separately, or in
concert, might be empowered to assumne upon themselves
the defence of their territory against the enemy/" appropriating a reasonable proportion of the publick taxes bfor
this purpose; or, "should peace not be concluded, and
the defence of the New-England States be neglected as it
has been since the commencement of the war."
The conclusion of a treaty of peace with Great Britain, not
long after being announced, another convention was not called;
and on the submission of the above amendments of the constitution to the several states, they were rejected.
No act of the federal party has been so bitterly reprehended
by their opponents, as the formation of the Hartford Convention.
It is represen ted by them, as a treasonable combination of ambitious individuals, who, taking advantage of the embarrassments of the national administration, arising out of the war,
sought to sever the onion; and were only deterred from anr
open attemlpt to accomplish their purpose by the unexpected
conclulsion of a treaty of peace with Great Britain-which disembarrassed the administration-and swept away all grounds
upon which to prosecute their designs.'
In defence of the convention~ it has been urged, that the in
dividuals who composed it, assembled in obedience to legislative appointment; and be the formation of a convention right
or wrong, they, as individuals, were not responsible for it.
That the calling of the convention was right, is urged on the
following grounds: at the period of its formation, the situation
of the country was such as gave serious grounds of alarm to reflecting men;-the war operations had been singularly disastrous; the recruiting service languished; the national treasury was almost penniless; the national credit was shaken, and
loans were effected at a ruinous discount; the New-England
seaboard was left exposed to the enemy-anld instead of securing the confidence of the people of the eastern states, by filling the military and civil oices under the general government,
with men of known talents and character, the administration
committed the interests of the nation at a critical period to
mnen contemned by a vast majority of the people in those states.
The publick mind, in vie'w of this state of things, was excited to a pitch bordering on insurrection; and as their representation in congress was unheard, they looked with earnest importunity to their state legislatures. W7hat could be done?
From the earliest dates of its history, the legislatures of NewEngland had been accustomed to call conventions, at periods
of common danger, to confer uponD the public welfare. It was
natural at this moment to resort to the same course; and instead of favouring the suspicion of treasonable intentions by
the character of the ineni selected to form this convenition; the
age, gravity, and established reputation of the greater part of
the members of it are a fair refutation of such suspicions.
There are no clear proofs to support the charge of treasonable designs on the part of the convention; on the contrary their
doings, which are the only fair test of their motives, and the
only just grounds upon which to form its character, and which
are before the world in their report, and,their secet journal,
triumphantly refute such a charge. And it is further marintained that the actual operation of the proceedings of the convention, was, instead of rousing opposition to the general governm eBt, to sooth the publick apprehensions, and quiet that rest[ess anxiety which pervaded thex country
XLIII. As early as the mkonth of September, inrdications
of no dubious character were given, tiat notwithstandiing
the negotiations pending between the American and British commissioners at Ghent, serious p'reparations were

making for an invasion of LouLisiana. About December
5th, certain intelligence was received that a British fleet'.
consisting of sixty sail), was off the coast to the east of the
Mississippi.
In the course of the month, fifteen thousand troops were -
Ianded, under the command of Sir Edward Packenham,
and, on the 8th of January, they. attacked the A mericans,
amounting to about six thousand, chiefly mnilitia, in their
intrenchments, before New-Orleans.   After an engagemnent of more than an hiour, the enemy lhaving lost their
commander in chief, and Major-General Gibbs, and having
been cut to pieces in an almost unexampled degree, fled
in confusion, leaving their dead and wounded on the field
of battle.
On the receipt of intelligence that the enemy were off the
coast of the Mississippi, Commodore Patterson despatched-five
gun boats to watch their motions. These boats being unfortunately captured, the enemy were left to choose their
point of attack, entirely unmolested.
A part of the British forces were landed on the 22d of December, and several engagements took place between them
and the Americans, some miles from New-Orleans. but nothindecisive was effected on either side.
During these preliminary engagements, Gen. Jackson, coinmmanding' at New-Orleans, had. been dilir,,ently employed in preparations to defend the place. His front was a straight line of
one thousand yards, defended by upwards of three thousand
infantry and artillerists. The ditch contained five feet of water,
and his front, from having been flooded by opening the levees,
and by frequent rains, was rendered slippery and muddy. Eight
distinct batteries were judiciously disposed, mounting in alt
twelve guns of different calibres. On the opposite side of the
river was a strong battery of fifteen guns.
On the morning of the 8th of January, General Packenhlam
brought up his forces, amountino- to twelve thousand men; to
the attack.  The British del'berately advanced in solid columns, over an even plain, in front of the American intrenchoents, the men carrying, besides their muskets, fascines, and
some of tlhem ladders.
A solemn silence now prevailed through the American lines,
until the enem:y approach)ed within reach of the batteries,
which at thlti moment openedl ain incessant and destructive
cannonade. The enemy, notwitmhstanhi.:,gf, continl,.ed to ad--             MADISON'S ADMINISTR.A&amp;TION              27
vance, closing up their ranks as fast as they were opened by
the fire of the Americans.
A length, they came within reach of the musketry and rifles.
The extended American line now unitedly presented one sheet
of fire, and poured in upon the British columns an unceasing
tide of death. Hundreds fell at every discharge, and by columns were swept away.
Being unable to stand the shock, the British became disordered and fled. In an attempt to rally thlem, Gen. Packenham.
was killed. Gens. Gibbs and Kean succeeded in pushing forward their columns a second tinme, but the second approach
was still more fatal than the first. The fires again rolled from
the American batteries, and from thousands of muskets. The
advancing columns again broke and fled; a few platoons only
reached the edge of the ditch, there to meet a liore certain de-;struction. In a third but unavailing attempDt to lead up their:troops, Generals Gibbs and Kean were severely wounded, the
former mortally.
The field of battle now exhibited a scene of extended carnage. Seven hundred brave soldiers were sleeping in death,
and one thousand four hundred were wounded. Five hundred
were made prisoners--making a loss to Ithe British, on this
memorable day, of near three thousand men. The Americans
lost in the engagement only seven killed, and six wounded.
The enemy now sullenly retired, and on the night of the 18th,
evacuated their camp, and, with great secrecy, embarked on
board their shipping.
XLIV., The news of the victory at New-Orleans spread
with haste through the Unlited States, and soon after was
followed by the still more welcome tidirigs of a treaty of
peace, which was signed at Ghent, on the 24th of December, 1814.  On the 17th of February, this treaty was
gatified by the president and senate.
Upon the subjects for which the war had been professedly
declared, the treaty, thus concluded, was silent. It provided
only for the suspension of hostilities-the exchange of prisoners-the restoration of territories and possessioBns obtained by
the contending powers, duriung the war-the adjustment of unsettled boundaries-and for a combined effort to effect the entire abolition of traffick in slaves.
But whatever diversity of opinion hiad prevailed about the
justice or policy of the war-or now prevailed about the merits of the treaty-all parties welcomed the return of peace.
The soldier gladly exchanged the toils of the camp for the rest
of his home; the mariner once mrnore spread his canvass to thewind, and fearless of molestation, joyfully stretched his way on
the ocean; and the yeomanry of the land, unaccustomed to the
din of arms, gladly returned to their wonted care of the field
and the flock.
XLV. The treaty withi England was followed, on the
30th of Junle, 1815, by a treaty with the dey of Algiers,
concluded at Algiers at thg time, by William Shaler and
Comn. Stephen Decatur, agents for the United States.
The war which thus ended by treaty was commenced by the
dey himself, as early as the yeear 1812. At that time the American consul, Mr. Lear, was suddenly ordered to depart from
Algiers, on account of the arrival of a cargo of naval and mili--
tary stores, for the regency of Algiers, in fulfilmeit of treaty
stipulations, which the dey alleged were not in such quaantity
or quality as he expected. At the same time, depredations
were commenced upon our commerce. Several American ves
sels.were captured and condemned, and their crews subjected
to slavery.
Upon a representation of the case by the president, to congress, that body formally declared wvar against the dey in
March. Soon after, an American squadron sailed for the Mediterranean, captured an Algerine brig, and a forty-four gun
frigate, a,nd at length appeared before Algiers.
The respectability of the American force, added to the two
important victories already achieved, had prepared the way for
the American commissioners to dictate a treaty upon such a
basis as they pleased. Accordingly, the model of a treaty was
sent to the dey, whio signed it. By this treaty, thle United
States were exempted fromn paying tribute in future-captured property was to be restored by the dey-prisoners to be delivered up without ransom, &amp;ec. &amp;c.
XLVI. By the ninth article of the treatvy' between the
United States and Great Britain, it was stipulated by the
former; that measures should be imimediately talken to establish a peace with the several tribes of Indians which
had been engaged in hostilities against the United States.
Such measures were accordingly takeln, and, in hIis message, December, 1815, the president communicated to
congress, that a renewal of treaties had readily been acceded to by several tribes, and that other more distant
tribes would probably follow their example, upon proper
explanations,
XLVII.    The treaty with Great Britain, which ended             MIADISOjNS ABDMINISTriATION.            275
the war, left the subject of commercial intercourse between
the two nations to fu-ture negotiation.  In the summer following the close of the xvar, plenipotentiaries, respectively
appointed by the two countries for that purpose, met at
London, and on the the 3d of July, signed " a convention,
by which to regulate the conmmeree between the territories
-of the United States, and of his 1ritannnick majesty."'.This conve-ntion provided for a reciprocal liberty of comnmerce between the two count-ies-for an equaiization of duties on importations and exportations from either country to
the other-and for the ad nission of American vessels to the
principal settlemernts of the British dominions in the East Indies, viz, Madras, Calcutta, Bombay, 0cS. Of this convention
the presidenrt spolie in terms of appr obation, in his message
to congress; bhit by a large portion of the community it was
received with coldness, frorn an apprehension that it would
operate uniavourably to Aressica, and wotuld seriously abridge
her comrmerce. Tne convention was to be binding only for
four years.
XLVIII. By the second article of the treaty with Great
Britain, it was agreed, that all vessels, takeni by either
power, within twelve days from the eX,ch1ange of ratifica-tions, between twenty-three degrees and fifty degrees of
-north latitude, should be considered lawful prizes.  A
longer period was stipulated for more distant latitudes.
Witlhin the time litnited 1by t'his article7 several actions took
place, and several vessels of various descrip6ons were capAured by eachi of the belligeretnts.  The frigate President
was taken January 15th, I815, by a British squadron;
the British ships Cyane, Levant, and Penguin, were captured by the Americans.
In consequence of the continuied blockade of Commodore
Dec,aturls squadron at New-London, that officer was tranasfer-red to the F1 lesident, then at Ne w-York. Soon after taking
coinmnand of her, a cruise was contemplated by the commodore, in con iurneton wilh ithe Peacock, Hornet, and Tom Bowline.  Thinking it more safe to venture out singly, the commodore appointed a place of rendezvous for the vessels, and set
sail in the President. - Through the carelessness of the pilot,
h1is vessel, in passing out, strucl upon the bar, where she lay
for two hours tossincb about, bv which her ballast was deranged,
and her trim for sailing los,. Trusting to the uexellence ofhmisvessel, however, and not being able to return to port, the come
modore put out to sea.
At daylight, he fell in with a British squadron, consisting of
the Endymion, Tenedos, and Pomone frigates, with the Majestick razee. In spite of every exertion, they gained upon him;
at length the Eindymion came within reach, and opened her
fire. Commodore Decatur determined to engage her before
the other vessels should come up. This he now did, and in a
short time completely silenced her. By this time, the rest of
the squadron had arrived; being unwilling to sacrifice his men
in a. useless contest, on receiving the fire of the nearest frigate,
hle surrendered. Comrrlodore Decatur was taken on board
the Endymnion, and although she was only a wreck, he was required to surrender his sword to the officer of that vessel. To
this the spirit of Decatur could not submit, and he indignantly
refused to relinquish it to any one but to the commander of
the squadron.
The Cyane, a frigate of thirty-four guns, and the Levant, a
sloop of eighteen thirty pound carronades, were taken by th8
Constitution about the same time.
The Peacock, Hornet, and Tom Bowline, left New-York a
few days after the sailing of the Presidenit, without having heard
of her capture. On the 23d of January, the Hornet parted
company, and d(irected her course towards Tristan d'Acuna
the place of rendezvous. Or the 23d of March, she descried
the British brig Penguin, of eighteen guns and a twelve pound
carronade, to the southward and eastward of the Island. Cap.
tain Biddle hove to while the Penguin bore down.
At forty minutes past one, the British brig opened her fire.
After fifteen minutes the Penguin gradually neared the Hornet with an intention to board, the captain having given orders for that purpose. At this time, he was killed by a grape
shot. Her lieutenant then bore her u), and running her boiwsprit between the main and moizzen rigging of the Hornet, gave
prders to board. His men, however, perceiving the crew of
the Hornet ready to receive them, refused to follow him. At
this moment the hieavy swells of the sea lifted the Hornet
ahead. The commander of the Penguin called out that he
had surrendered, and Captain Biddle ordered his men to cease
firing.
Immediately after this, an officer of the Hornet called to
Captain Biddle, that a man in the enemy7's shrouds was taking
aim at him. Before he could change his position, a musket
ball struck him in the neck, and wounded him severely. Two
marines immediately levelled their pieces, and killed the wretch
before he had brought his gun from his shoulder. The crewof the Hornet, indignant at this outrage, demanded to give the
enemy a fresh broadside, and the vessel had nearly wore round
for that purpose, before Captain Biddle could restrain the justly exasperated crew.  The loss of the Penguin was fourteen
in killed, and twenty-eight wounded.'he HIornet had one
killed and eleven wounded. The former vessel was so seriously injured, that Captain Biddle suink her.
XLIX. The attention of congress, during their session
in the year 1815--1816, was called to a bill which had
for its object the incorporation of a National Bank. In
the discussion which followed, much diversity of opinion
was found to prevaiil, not only as to the constitutional.
power of congress to establish such an institution, but also
as to the principles upon which it should be modelled.
After weeks of animaxted debate, a bill incorporating the
" Bank of the United State.s," withl, a capital of thirtyfivel millions of dollars, passed, and on Wednesday, April
o10th, received the signature of the president.
Of the stock of the bauls, seven rmillions were to be subscribed by the United States, tle remaining twenty-eight by
individuals. The affairs of the corporation were to be managed by twenty-five directors, five of wh lom were to be chosen
by the president, withl the advice anld consent of the senate
the remainder to be elected by the stockholers, at the' banking house in Philadelphia.'The charte of the bank is to cointinue in force until the 3d of -March, 1336.
L. The summer of 1816 passed away without being
marked by any events of pecutliar moment. The country
appeared gradually recovering from the embarrassmetts
induced by the war, and that asperity of feeling, which
had agitated the different political parties in the United
States, was visibly wearing away.
LI. In December, 1816, Indiana became an independent state, and was received into the union.
Detached places in Indiana were settled by the French, upWards of a century ago. The exact period, at which the first
settlement was made, is uncertain.
In 1763, the territory was ceded by France to England.
Ev the treaty of Greenville in 1795, the United States obtained of the Indians several sTmall grants of land within tliis territory; and, in subsequent years, still more extensive tracts.
During the war with England, whichi broke out in i 812-, In24
277Their charter was taken away, and the government o'
the colony assumed by the crown. The king himself
appointed a governour, in whom, with twelve counsellors, the powers of government were vested.
The London Company, thus dissolved, consisted of gentiemen of noble and disinterested viewvs, who had expended more
than one hundred thousa,nd pounds of their fortunes, mn this first
attempt to plant an English colony in Ainerica; and more than
nine thousand persons had been sen-t from the mother country
to people this new settlement. At the time of the dissolutLion
of the company scarcely twvo thousand persons survived.
Charles L. succeeding Jamnes I. in 1625, brought the
Virginia Colony mnore immediately under the direction of
the crown. Under this adnministration, the colony suffered much for many years, fomin the severe and arbitrary
restraints imposed upon it by the king, through the governour and council.
XI. It has been stated, that the landls, upon which the
Plymouth colony settled, were granted by the crown to
- the Council of Plymouth," in England, in November,
1620.  This was the sam.e month that the Puritanis hadc
arrived in the country. Being apprized of this grant,9
the colonyv, in 1626, began to take measures to purchase
these lands. The negotiations for tlhis purpose ended
the next year in a patent, wlich the company granted
them for one thoutsand eight hundred pounds sterling, with
ample powers of governslent.
The government of the colony was at first formed and con
ucted according to a voluntary compact, entered into before
landing. Till the year 16S24, it consisted of a governour and
one assistant only.'rom this period five wvere annualy chosen, the governour having a double vote. The number of assistants was afterwards increased to seven.-The lawvs of the
colony were enacted, and the affiairs of government conducted
by these officers for near tventy years. In 1639, the towns in
this colony, for the first tinme, sent deputies. The colony continued distinct near seventy years, until 1691, when, by charter of William and Mary, it was united to the colony of MA[assachusetts, and the Province of Maine.
XII. In 16,8, the fiundation vwas laid for anon:hser co,diana was the scene of many Indian depredations, and of many
unusually severe battles, between the hostile tribes, and the
troops of the United States.
Until 1801, Indiana formed a part of the great north-western
territory, but, at that date, it was erected into a territorial
government, with the usual powers and privileges. In December, 1815, the inhabitants amounting to sixty thousand
the legislature petitioned congress for admrnission into the union,
and the privilege of forming a state constitution. A bill for
this purpose passed congress, in April, 1816; a convention ol
delegates met in conformity to it, by Which a constitution was
adopted, and Indiana became an independent state, and a
member of the union in December following.
LII. 1817. On Wednesday, February 12th, the votes
for Mr. Madison's successor were counted in the presence
of both houses of Congress, when it appeared that James
Monroe was elected president, and Daniel D. Tompkins
vice president of the United States, for thie four years from
and after the 4th.of the ensuing March.
LIII. 4A    flt105.  The only noticeable change ol
manners, which seems to have taken place during this period, arose from the spirit of pecuniary speculation, whvich
pervaded the country during the war. Money was bor
rowed with facility, aud fortunes were often made in a
da y.' Extravagance and profligacy were, to some extent,
the consequence.  The return of peace, and the extensive
misfortunes which fell upon every part of the community,
counteracted these vices, and restored more sober and industrious habits.
LIV. RtglMgo.    Dtring this period, extensive revi.
vals of religion prevailed, and liberal and expanded plans
were devised and commenced for the promotion of chris.
tianity.  Several theological institutions were founded,
missionary and bible societies were established, and a great
call for ministers of the gospel was heard.            MADISON'S ADMINISTRATION,               2 79
LV. Vi~abo   ant( (lJmmrvt.      During this period,
trade and commerce were crippled by foreign restrictions,
our own acts of non-intercourse, and at length by the war
with England.   During this war our carrying trade was
destroyed, nor was it restored by the peace of 1815.
On the return of peace, immense importations were made
from England, the country being destitute of English mnerchandisc. The market was soon glutted, prices fell, aind extensive
bankruptcies were the consequence.
LVI. fgi$UtltJtIC.     Agriculture, during this period,
cannot ne said to have made great advances.
An excessive disposition min thle people, for trade and speculation, drew off the attention of the more intelligent and acLive part of the community, and directed much of the capital
Df the country to other objects. Upon the return of peace,
however, when mercantile distresses overspread the land,
agriculture was again resorted to, as one of the surest means
of obtaining a livelihood. Men of capital, too, turned their
attention to farminig; agricultural societies were established,
in all parts of the country; more enlightened methods of culture were introduced, and agriculture became not only one
of the most profitable, but one of the most popular objects of
pursuit.
LVII.    2rttli auJ  fal;11 ttulttlCr.+  During the
war which occurred in this period, the intercourse with
England and other places being stoppe'd, the country was
soon destitute of those articles which had been supplied by
English manufactories. Accordingly, the people began to
manufacture for themselves.  Extensive manufacturing
establishments were started for almost every sort of mer
chandise.
Such was their success at the outset, that an immense
capital was soonI invested in them, and the country beganto be supplied with almost every species of manufacture
from our own establishments. After the peace, the country being inundated with Britishi goods, these establishments suffered the severest embarrassments, and mrnany of
them were entirely broke down. A considerable portion
of them, however, were maintained, and continued to fiou~

LIX. E       tVca:foll.  The pecuniary embarrassments
experienced throuighout the country, during the latter
part of this period, sensibly affected some institutions devoted to science and benevolence, especially those which';depend, in part, upon the yearly contributions of the patrons of learning and religioxn, for the means of support.
In several of the higher seminaries, the number of students was, for a time, diminished.  Nevertheless, parochial schools, academies, and colleges, upon the whole,
continued to increase, and to qualify many for the common and higlher professions of life.
A theological institution was established at Princeton, NewJersey, in 1812, by the G(e-uneral Assembly of the Presbyterian
Church. In 1821, the theological seminary of the Associate
Reformed Church, in New-York, was united to that of Princeton, and its library, co-.nsistinig of for thousand volumes, which
cost seventeen thousand doll-rs, w.as transferred to the latter
place. This seminary has three professors, and in 1821, had
seventy-three students.

DISTINGUISHED FOR MONROE S ADMINISTRATION
James J.lolr2oc.
dte'ndinzg front the inaug'urdtion of President Mlonroe,
1817, to the close of t71e year 1822.
1. On the 4th of March, 1817, Mr. MAonroe took tn,
oath prescribed by thle constitution, atd entered upoin thl
duties of president of the United Sates.
24*     -~282,     iPERIOD XI..181...1822.
The condition of the country, -on the accession of Mr. Mon.
roe to the presidency, was in several respects more prosperous
and happy, than on the accession of his predecessor. Not only
had war ceased, and the rolitical asperity, excited by it, given
place to better feelings, but efforts were mrade in every section
of the union, to revive those plans of business, whichi the war
had nearly aninihilated.
The country had suffered too much, however, to regain, immediately, its former prosperity. Commerce was far from
being flourishing; a considerable part of the legitimate trade
was in the hands of foreigners; many ships were lying unemployed, and the ship building in many ports had neaiy ceased.
rThe manufacturing establishmrents, which had not been entirely broken down, were sustaining a precarious existence
Foreign mrerchandise was inundating the country; and the
specie, borrowed in Europe for the national bank, at an excessive premium, as well as that whlich was previously in the
country, was rapidly leaving it to pay the balance of trade
against us. In his inaugural address, however, the president
spoke in animating terms of the happy state of the country
and of its prospects of regaining, at no distant period, that
measure of prosperity, which in former years it had enjoyed.
II. In the summer and autumnn, following his inauguration, the president made a tour through the northern and
eastern states of the unioDn.
The objects of this tour were connected with the national interests. Congress had appropriated large sums of money for
the fortification of the seacoast and inland frontiers, for the establi.shment of naval docks, and for iincreasing the navy. The
superintendence of these, works belonged to the president. Solicitous to discharge his duty in reference to themin with judgmnent, fidelity, and econromy, ie was induced to visit the most
impoLrtant points along the saconast, and in the interior, from
a conviction of being bett'er able to direct in reference to
them, with the knowledge derived from personal observation,
than by mneans of information communicated to him by others.
IM. Colngress net ron the I st of December.  In his message at the opening cf the session,I the presidenf stated that
the niational credit was attaining a high elevation; thate
prepar,;a.ions for the defi:nce of the country were progressing, under a   vell digested system; that arrangements had
been made wilih Grteat Brittin to redcluce the naval force of
the two countries on the western lakes, and that it was
agreed t!hti a   ac h country should keep possession of the             AMONRO1L'S ADMiNIlST1A11ON.              2gO$
islands which belonged to it before the war; and that the
Tforeign relations of the country continued to be pacifick.
Trhe message concluded with recommnending the surviving officers and soldiers of the revolutionary army to the
special notice of congress, and the repeal of the internal
duties, on the ground.that thie state of the treasury rendered
their longer continuance unnecessary.
IV. On the 11th, the state of MissisSIPPi was acknow
ledgcd by congress as sovereign and independent, and was
admitted to the union.
The first European, who visited the.present state of Mississippi, appears to have been Ferdinand de Soto, a native of Badajoz, in Spain, who landed on the coast of Florida on the 25th
of May, 1539. I-le spent three years in the country searching
for gold, but at length died, and was buried on the banks of
the Jississippi, May, 15412.
In 1683, M. de Salle descended the Mississippi/and gave the
name of Louisiana to the country. In consequence of this, the
French claimned to hiave jurisdiction over it. In 1716, they
formed a settlement at the Natchez, and built a fort, which they
named Rosalie. Other settlementswere effiected in subsequent
years. The French settlements were, however, seriously disturbed by the Indians, particularly by the Natchez, once the
most powerful of all the southern tribes.
The French retained an acknowledged title to tlie country,
on the east side of the Mississippi, until the treaty of 1763,
when they ceded their possessions, east of that river, to the
English. By the treaty of 1783, CGreat Britain relinquished
the Floridas to Spain, without specifick boundaries; and at the
same time, ceded to the United States all the country north of
the thirty-first degree of latitude. The Spaniards retained possession of the Natchez and the ports inosth of the thirty-iirst
degree, until 1798, when they finaltly abandoned themn to the
United States.
In the year 1800, the territory between the Mississippi and
the westernl boundary of Georgia was erected into a distinct
territorial government. By treaty in 1801, at fort Adamrns, tihe
Choctaw Indians relinquished to the United States a large body
of land, and other cessions have siince been made. On the 1 st
of March, 1817, con.ress authoriized the people of the westerin
part of Mississippi territory to foirmn a constitution and state
government.  A convention met in July, 1817, by which a
constitution was formed, and in December following, Mississippi was admitted into thlle union as a separate state.V. In the course of the month, an expedition whichl had
been set on foot by a niumber of adventurers, from different
zountries, against East and West Florida, was terminated
by the troops of the United States. These adventurers
claimed to be acting under the authority of some of the
South American colonies, and had formed an establishment
at Amelia Island, a Spanishl province, then the subject of
negotiation between the United States and Spain.  Their
avowed object being an inrvasion of the Floridas, and of
course an invasion of a part of the United States, the
American government deemied itself authorized, without
designing any hlostility to Spain, to take possession of Ame.
lia Islaind their head quarters.
VI. Several bills of importance passed congress, during
their session, in tllhe winter of 1817, 1818; a bill allowing
to the memibers of the senate, and house of representatives
the suni of ei'ght dollars per day, during their attendance;
a second, in compliance with the recommendation of the
president, abolishing the internal duties; and a third, providing, upon the same recomimendation, for the indigent of.
ficers and seldliers of the revolutionary army.
VII. In April 1818, ILLINTOIS adopted a state constitutioni and in December Ifollowi.g, was adcmitted as a mereher of the unin.
Illinois derives its name from its principal river, which, in
the lang-age of the Indians, signifies the river of tmen. The first
settlements, like those of Indiana, were made by the French,
and were tie consequence of the adventurous enterprises of M.
de la Salle, in search of thl-e Mississippi.-The first settlements
were the villa-es of Kaskaskia and Cahokia. In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the' settleminents of Illinois
were represented to have been in a flourishinD condition. But
subsequently they inr a great mneasuire declined.
From the beginning to the middle of the eighteenth century,
little was heard of thle settlements of the French, on the banks
of tie Illinois. About 1749, the French began to fortify the
/Vabasih and Illinois, in order to resist the British. In 1762, all
the country to the east of thie Mississippi was ceded to the latter power, and consequently Ili.ncis passed under the British
dominion. At thie peace of 1,78~3, Great Britain renounced its
-laims of sovereignty over this country, as well as over the           MONROE'S ADMiNISTRATION0                   285
United States. Virginia, however, and some other states,
claimed the whole country, north and west of the Ohio; but at
the instance of congress, a cession of these claims was made
to the general government. Illinois remained a part of Indiana until 18309, when a distinct territorial government was
established for it. In 1818, the people formed a constitution,
and it is now one of the United States.
VIII. Early after the conclusion of this session of congress, the president, in pursuance of his determination to
visit such parts of the United States as were most exposed
to the naval and military forces of an enemy, prepared to
survey thle Chesapeake bay, and the country lying on its
extensive shores.
In the month of May, he left XTashington, accompanied by
the secretary of war, and the secretary of the navy, with other
rentlemen of distinction. On his arrival at Annapolis, the president and his suite minutely examined the waters contiguous,
n reference to their fitness for a naval depot. Embarking at
his place on board a vessel, he fuirther examined the coast,
rnd thence proceeded to Norfolk. Having at length accom-'lished the principal object of his tour, in the examination of
Lhe Chesapeake bay, he returned to Washington, June 17th,:hrough the interior of Virginia. The respectful, and affec-:ionate demonstrations of attachment, paid him during his
aortbern tour, were renewed in this.
IX. On the 27th of May, 1818, a treaty, concluded
with Sweden, at Stockholm, on the 4th of September, 1816,
by Mr. Russel mninister plenipotentiary to that court was
oatified by the president and senate on the part of the
[Jnited States.  The same was ratified by the king of
Sweden on the 24th of the following July.
This treaty provided for maintaining peace and friendship
Setween the two countries-reciprocal liberty of commerce-!qualization of duties, &amp;c. &amp;c. The treaty was to continue in.orce for eight years from the exchange of ratifications.
X. During the year 1 818, a war was carried on between'he Seminole Indians and the Untited States, which terminated in the complete discomfitLure of the former.
The history of this war is rendered more interesting by the
"onspicuous part which Gen. Jackson, the hero of New-Or-!eans, bore in it, and the decisive, though novel, measures which
ne adopted in prosecuting it.
XI On the 28th of Januairy, 1819, a convention between Great Britain and the United States, concluded at
London, October 20tl, 1818, and ratified by thie Prince
Regent on the 2d of November fIllowing, was ratified by
the president of the Unrited States.
By the first ar~ticlpe of ti' 3 convention, the citizens of the Uns
ted States hav-e!i~rt~, irn common with the subjects of Great
Britain, to take fi;h on the southern, western, and northern
coast of Newfoundland, &amp;c. The second article establishes
the northern boundaries of the United States from the Lake of
the Woods to the Stoney Mountains. By the fourth article,
the commercial convention between the two countries, concluded at London, in 1815, is extended'for the term of ten
years longer, &amp;c. &amp;c.
XII. On the 22d of February following, a treaty was
concluded at Washington, by John Quincy Adams, and
Louis de Onis, by which East and West Florida, with all
the Islands adjacent, &amp;c. were ceded by Spain to the United
States.
By this treaty, the western boundary between the United
States and Spain was settled. A sum not exceeding five millions of dollars is to be paid by the United States, out of the
proceeds of sales of lands in Florida, or in stock, or money, to
citizens of the United States, on account of Spanish spoliations
and injuries. To liquidate these claims, a board was to be constituted by the government of the United States, of Americanl
citizens, to consist of thlree commissioners, who should report
within three years.
XIII. On the 2d of March, 1819, the government of
the ARKANSAS Territory was orgaiiized by act of congress.
The earliest settlement, within the limits of the territory of
Arkansas, was made by the Chevalier de Tonte, in 1685, at
the Indian village of Arkansas, situated on the river of that
name.   Emigrants fromn Canada afterwards arrived, but the
progress of the settlementwas slow.
Upon the cession of Louisiaina to tlhe United States, the cce
ded territory was divided into two parts, the territory of Orleans,
lying south of latitude thirty degrees, and the district of Louisiania, comprehenlding all the tract of country between the Mississippi and the Pacifick Ocean. In March, 1805, the latter
countrywas denominated theTerritory of Louisiana. In 1812, this
teTrritory was constituted a territorial government, by the name
of the Territory of Missouri. In March, 1819, the inhabitants
of the northern parts were formed into a distinct district, by
the name of Missouri, and soon after the southern was formed             1'MONROE'S ADMAINISTRATION.              2 ST
into a territorial gemernment by the name of Arkansas. In
December, 1819, an election for a delegate to congress was
held fGr the first timne.
XIV. During the followlng summer, 1819, the president visited the southern section of the country, having in
view the same great national interests which had prompted him in his previous tour to the north.
In this tour the president visited Charleston, Savannah, and
Augusta; from this latter place he proceeded to Nashville,
through the Cherokee nation, and thence to Louisville and
LexingtoA, Kentucky, whence he returned to the seat of government, early in August.
XV. On the 14th of December following, a resolution
passed congress admitting ALABAMA into the union, on an
equal footing with the original states.
Alabama, though recently settled, appears to have been visited by Ferdinand de Soto, in 1539. Some scattered settlements were made within the present state of Mississippi before
the American revolution, but Alabama continued the hunting
ground of savages until a much later period.
After the peace of 1783, Georgia laid claim to this territory,
and exercised jurisdiction over it, until the beginning of the
present century.  In 1795, an act passed the legislature of
Georgia, by which twenty-five millions of acres of its western
territory were sold to compaqties for five hundred thousand dollars, and the purchase money was- paid into their treasury.
The purchasers of these lands soon after sold them at advanced prices. The sale of the territoiry excited a warm opposition in Georgia, and at a subsequent mneeting of the legislatu re, the tranrsaction was impeached, on the ground of bribery,
corruption, and uneonstitutionality.  The records, respecting
the sale, were ordered to be burnt, and the five hundred tiousand dollars to be refunded to the pur-chasers. Those who had
acquired titles of the original purchiasers instituted suits in the
federal courts.
In 1802, however, Georgia ceded to the TJUnited States all her
western territory, fbor one million two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.  On this event, the purchasers of the Yazoo
land petitioned congress for-redress and compensation. After
considerable opposition, an act passed for reimbursing them
with,funded stock, called the Mississippi stock. In 1800, the
territory wh!ich now forms the states of Mississippi and Alabama, was erected into a territorial government. In 1817,
Mississippi territory was divided, and the western portion of it
was authorized to form a state constitution. The eastern por       PERIOD Ii....1607....169....SE TTLEMENTS.  
ony, in New-England, by the name of the colony of MASSACHUSETTS B_Y.
The patent of this colony was granted by the Council of Plymouth, or New-England, to Sir Henry Roswell and othors;
and conveyed to them the territory lying between three miles
north of the Merrimiack, and tlihree miles south of Charles River
Sir HenryRoswell and his associates, however, woon sold the
patent to Sir Richard S-altonstall, John Endicott, and others in
Pngland, who were proj ectingr a settlement in New-England,
for the purposes of greater religious freedom.
The same year, John Endicott was sent over, and began the settlement of the colony of 51assachusetts Bay, at
Salent, then called by the Indians Naumkeak. As the
patent granted to thlis. colony conveyed no powers of government, King Charles, in 1629, granted these powers
by charter. Six ships, fhLrnished by the company, brought
over four hundred persons, men, women, and children,
three hundred of whom settled at Salem, the remainder at
Charlesto.wn
During the succeeding summer, 1630, John Winthrop,
who had been appointed governour, and T'rhomas Dudley,
deputy governour, with 0oe thousand five hundred peo-.
ple, arrived at Charlestown; but owing to a mortal sickness, which soon after prevailed in that settlement, the governour and several of the planters removed to Shawmut,
whiich they named Boston.
Governour Winthrop, and his associates, came over under
an arrangement to transferthe government of this colony, from
London to New-England, and to place it iit the hands of officers to be elected by the freemen. This was carried into effect, and tle freemen continued annually to elect their officers
of government.
The colony soon experienced the distresses of mortal sickness
and wasting famine. There was scarcely a family, in which
there had not been a death before spring, and many of the people were obliged to subsist on clamns, muscles, acorns, and nuts.
riday, February 6, was appointed as a day of fasting; but
the day before, a ship arriving laden with provisions, the governour, on the joyful occasion, appointed aday of thanksgiving

tion was then formed into aterritorial government, and received
the name of Alabama. In JulyT, 1819, a convention of delegates
met at Huntsville, and adopted.a state constitution, wvhich
being approved by congress in December following, the state
was declared to be henceforth o-ne of the United States.
XVI. In the ensting year, March 3d, 1820, MAINE became an indepenrdent state, and a mexmber of the federal.union.
The separation of the District of Maine from Massachusetts,
and its erection into an independent state, had been frequently
attempted without success.  in October, 1785, a convention
met at Portland, for the purpose of considering this subject. In
the succeeding vear, the question was submitted to the people
of Maine, to be decided in town meetings, when it was Ibund
that a maj6rity of freemen were against the measure.
The subject was renewed in 1802, when a majority appeared
averse to a separation. In 1819, an act passed the general.
court of Massachusetts for ascertaining the wishes of the people; in conformity to which, a vote was taken in all the towns.
A large majority were found in favour of a separation.' A convention was called, and a constitution adopted, which being approved, Massachusetts and Maine amicably separated, the latter taking her proper rank, as one of the Unfited States.
XVII. On the 3d of March, 1821, the 16th congress
closed its second session. Few subjects of importance
were discussed, and but little done for the advancement of
publick interest, or the, promnotion of private prosperity.
Acts were passed to admnit Missouri into the union conditionally; to reduce the miilitary peace establishment to four
regiments of artillery, and seven regiments of infantry, with
their proper officers; and to carry into further execution
the provisions of treaties with Spain and Great Britain.
XVIII. On the 5thh Mir. Monroe, who had been reelected to the presidency, took the usual oath of office.
The re-election of Monroe was nearly unanimous. Mr
Tompkins was again elected vice-president.
XIX. August 10th, 1821, the president, by his proclamation, declared Missouni to be an independent state, and
that it was admnitted into the federal union.
The first permanent settlements in Missouri, appears to have
been made at St. Genevieve and New-Bourbon, which were
fouinded soon after the peace of 1663. In the succeeding year,St. lIouis, the capital of the state, was commenced. In 1762,
Louisiana, and Missourii of course, were secretly ceded by
rance to Spain; but the latter did not attempt to take possession of the country until some years after.
Missouri remained in possession of Spain, through the war of
the revolution, until the cession of Louisiana to France, in
1801, by which latter power it was ceded to the United States,
in 1803.
Upon the cession of Louisiana to the United States, the district, which now forms the state of Louisiana, was separated
from the territory, and mnade a distinct government, by the
name of the territoka of Orleans. In 1811, the territory of Orleans became a state, by the name of Louistias. rThe remain
ing part of the original province of Louisiana, extending to the
Pacifick, was erected into a territorial government, and called
Mlissouri. In 1818-19, application was made to congress, by
the people of this territory, to form a state constitution. A
bill was accordingly introduced for the purpose, a provision
Sf which forbade slavery or involuntary servitude.
The bill with this provision passed the house of representaLives, but was rejected in the senate; and, in consequence of
this disagreement, the measure, for the time, failed. In the'
session of 1819-20, thle bill was revived; and, after long and
animated debates, a compromise was effected, by which slavery
vas to be tolerated in Mlissouri, and forbidden in all that part:f Louisiana, as ceded by France, lying north of 360 30' north
atitude, except so much as was included within the limits of
he state. In the mean time the people of Missouri had fornmed a state constituition. WThen this constitution was presented:o congress, in 1820-21, a provision in it, which required the
egislature to pass laws "to prevent free regroes and mulattoes
trom coming to, and settling in the state," was strenuously
5pposed, on the ground that it violated the rights of such per-;ons of that description, as were citizens of any of the United
States.
The contest occupied a great part of the session, and it was
inally determined, by a small majority, that Missouri should
be admitted, upon the fundamental condition, that the contested clause should not be construed to authorize the passage
tf any laws, excluding citizens of other states from enjoying
[he privileges to whichl they are entitled by the constitution
ff the United States. It was also provided, that if the legisature of Missouri should, by a solemn publick act, previousy to the 4th Monday of November, 1821, declare the assent
pf the state to this funadamental condition, the president should
ssiue his proclamation, declaring the admission complete. On

the 24th of june, 1821, the legislature of Missouri assenteo
to the fundamental condition; and, on the 10th of August fot
lowing, the president's proclamation was issued, declaring the
admission complete.
XX. The first session of the seventeenth congress comnmenced on the 3d of Deceminber.  The affairs of the niation
were genLerally prosperous, and there seemed to be no obstacle in the way of wise and prudent measures.     A
spirit of jealousy, however, obtruded itself upon their deliberations, by which some beneficial measures were defeated, and the business of the session was iiunnecessarily delayed
and neglected.  Several acts of importance however, were
passed concerning navigation and commerce;--relievvig still
firther the indigent veterans of the revolution;-and fixing
the ratio, between population -and representation at one
representative for every forty thousand inhabitants.
XXI. During the above session of congress, Marchi 31,
1822, a territorial government was established for FLo-'
RIDA.
The name of Florida was formerly given to an immense region of country discovered by Cabot, in 1497. The first visitant to the actual territory of Florida, was Ponce de Leon,
who landed on Easter day, 1512. Navigators firom several
countries visited it, and yarious European soverei.ns attempted to appropriate the country to theirselves.
Spain, however; held possession of it until 1763, when it was
ceded to Great Britain. In May, 1781, Don Galvcz captured Pensacola, and, socon afte.wards, completed the conquest
of the whole of West Florida, which remained in possession of
Spain, until 17o3, whlen Great Biritain relinquished both provinces of Floridia to Spain.
By the treat of FJ rance, in 1803 which ceded Louisiana to
the United States, it xvas declared to be ceded, with the same

By virtue of this declaration the United States claimed the
c6untry wvest of the Perdido river, nd in 181-1 took possession
of it, except the town and fort of Mobile vbwhich were surrendered the following year. In 1814, a Britisbh expedition having
beenfitted out against the United lStatps from  Pensacola, Ge
nieral Jackson took possession of Ihe'own; but, having no au;
thority to hold it, returned to Mobile.

Fort St. Marks and Pelsac$la, which the American troops
held till November, 1 8 8, when they were restored to Spain.
In 1819, a transfer of the whole province was made, by treaty,
to the United States, and, after many vexatious delays, tihe
treaty was ratified by Spain, in October 18y20, and, finally,
by the United States, in the monthof February, 1821. Poso,
session was delivered to General Jackson, as commissioner of
the United States, in July, 1821.
XXII. The second session of the seventeenthl congress
conmmenced at Washington, onl the 2d of December. In
his message at the opening of the session, the president informed congress that, in June, a convention of navigation
and commerce, resting essentially on a basis of reciprocal
and eqLual advantage to the two countries, had been concluded between France and the United States;-that the
prohibition, wh'ich had been imposed on the commerce,
between the United States and the British colonies, in the
West Indies and on this continent, had been removed, and
that the ports of those colonies had been opened to the
vessels of the U. States by an act of the British parliament.
In a second message, a few days subsequently, the president introduced to the notice of congress the interesting subject of the  miultiplied outrages antd depredations, recently
committed on our seamen and commerce by Pirates8, in the
West Indies and Gulf of Mexico" and recommended the
immediate organization of an efficient force to suppress
them.   A bill was accordingly introduced, authorizing
the president to provide such a force, and to despatch it
immediately to the protection of our persecuted seamen.
The president had mentioned the subject of piracy in his
first message; but he was prompted early after to maklie it the
subject of a special conmmunication, in consequence of intelligence that captain Allen, of the Alligrator, a brave and meritorious officer, had fallen in the neighbourhood of Matanzas,
by the hands of these ruthiless barbarians, while attempting, in
discharge of his duty, to rescue an unprotected merchant ship,
which had fallen into their power. Immediately after the passage of the above bill, Commodore Porter was appointed to
this service, and, soon after., hoisting his broad pendant on

to chastise these miscreants, that regard no law, and that feel
no mercy.
)MBRACING A SKETCH OF THE PRESENT CONDITION OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
XXII. ifalltug.        Two ce-nturies have elapsed
since the first settlements were commenced in the United
States by Europeans, yet the people have not acquired
that uniformr character which belongs to ancient nations,
upon whom time, and the stability of institutions have imprinted a particular and individual character. Although
partial changes have occurred, which have been noticed
in the progress of this work, yet so far down as thepresent
time, the essential variations which have taken place are
few.
The physiognomy is nearly as varied as the origin
of the population is different.  English, Irish, German,
Scotch, Frenc'h and Swiss, all retain something of the first
stamp, which belongs to their ancient country. The original roughness and severity of the first settlers are, int
deed lost, and a degree of softness and pliancy, more
congenial with an improved state of society, has generally obtained.
XXIV. g     [gf0     The principal religious dencm)
nations, at present, in the United States, are Presbyteria.s,
and Congregationalists, Baptists, Friends, Episcopalians,
and Methodists. The two first of these, unitedly, have
more than twenty-five hundred c,1ngregations; the number of Baptist congregations exceed two thousand; the
Friends have five hundred, and the Episcopalians about
three hundred. The Methodists also are numerous.
For the effectual emnployment of those *who wish to be en
gaged in the chris'tan runistrv and in missions, peculial facilities have been devised; and the plans of benevolence memntioned under the last period, have been continued and greatly
augmented. The American Board of Commissioners for fo
reign Missions, the American Bible Society, the American
Education Society, together with a Society for the colonization
of free blacks in Africa, have risen in respectability and resources. Missionaries in considerable numbers are sent, not
only into vacant and destitute parts of our own country, to
the South and West, and am-ong the Indians; but also to Southern Asia, to Palestine, and to the Islands of the Pacifick
Ocearn.
XXV.    FrAvc aub (8m~r:tt.: The commerce
of the United States consists, principally, in the exchange
of Agricultural produce for th e manufacturesof other parts
of the world, and thne productions of the tropical climates.
The principal articles of domestick produce, exported, are
cotton, whleat, flour, biscuit, tobacco, lumber, rice pot
and pearl ashes, Indilan corn, and meal, dried and pickled
fish, beef, rye, pork, &amp;c.
XXVI-.    grt;tlg. Until within a few years, agriculture, as a science, received but little attention in the
United States. Few; if any, valuable improvements were
attempted. *Iditlierence and uncomtmon apathy seem to
have pervaded society. A new era, however, has recent
ly comnmenced. and agriculture, both as a science and an
art, is receiving Lmuch of that attention whch its acknowledged importance demands. It is beginning to be regarded
as it should he, not only as the basis of subsistence and
population, but as the parent of individual and national
opulence.'Menr of enlightened minds, and of distinguished wealth, ar,e
in many parts of the country, devoting themselves to tre study
of thle art, and to new and uiseful experiments. Agricultural
societies abound; at the head of which may be seen some of
the- mot scientifick and Dractical mIen, combirinig their powers in sa.vour of agriculture, for the collection and diffusion of,information, and for the excitement of industry and emulation.
The exhibitions whic!m annually take place, in almost every
couinti, of cattle, and of the productions of the soil, the learned and often eloquent addresses, which these exhibitions call
forth, have a trong tendency to awaken the attentioaDf our
2,93294             FER,RIOD XlI.17....1822.
countrymen to a pursuit inore favourable to health, virtue, and
peace, than any other.
The proportion of the inhabitants of the United States, de
voted to agricultural pursuits, is large. By the census of 1 820
it appears that this proportion is more than one fifth of the
whole population, or two millions.
XXVII. (att. watv     4     Ua f 4tUrltti:. The manufacturing establishments in the United States are considerably various and numerous; and though less prosperous
than during the late war, are gradually rising from the depression which they experienced inmmnediately after the
return of peace, in consequence of the excessive importations of foreign goods, vwhich were thien made.
XXVIII. -9te 4Itaf:.d Thle population of the
United. States in 1 820 was.n,ine millioes, six hundred and
thirty-seven thousand, nine hundtred and ninety-nile; of
whoni one million, five h'undred and thirty-one thousand,
four hundred and thirty-six were slaves, and two lhundred
and thirty-three thousand, tlhree hundred and ninlety-eight
were free blacks.

vernment, has rec-eived, as baQ, been noticed in the progress of this work, considerable attention in the United
States, in every period since their settlement. The present
state of our primary and higher schools, of our colleges,
universities, and othler establishmnents of education, is more
flourishing than at any lormner period; their number is
annually increasing, and a mrore liberal spirit, in respect
o their endowment, is prevailing.
XXX. Upon concluding this history of our country, we can
scarcely refrain from asking, who of our ancestors anticipated
results from their toils, so stupendous as those which we behold.?
Who of them predicted, while they were laying up the pines
of the forest for a shelter, that they were commrencing an empire, which,- within two centuries, wvould extend thousands ofmilUes, and embrace, within its bosom, ten millions of the hu.
man race?
Who then thought of cities, withl their busy population, a
thousand miles fromn the wvaters of the Atlantick?-or of fleets,
on the inlantd seas, proceeding to, and returning from distant
voyages? or of navies pouring forth their thunder and their
flame? Such results entered not into sober calculation, and
were beyond even the dreams of fancy. Yet two centuries
have -rought them to pass.
Thle branch which our fathers planted, under the fostering
care of heaven, rose, extended, invigorated. It acquired stability by oppression, and gathered importance from the efforts
wvhich were made to crush it. In the progress of our history,
we have seen the American people, while sustaining only the
character of colonists, and struggling with the discouragements
and difficulties of new settleminents, maintaining at their own expense, and bringing to prosperous conclusion, wars, which a
selfish and jealous mother country, by her pride and imprudence, had occasioned.
We have seen these colonies, amidst all the oppressions
which they experienced, throug-h exactions, and calumnies,
loss of charters, and one abridgment of liberty after another,
still maintaining their loyalty-still indulging the feelings, and
adopting the language of ahection, until justice and patriotism
and religion bid them rise to assert those rights, which the Godt
of nature designed for all his rational offspring.
Through a long and trying war, in which experit nce had to
contend with discipline, and poverty with wealth, we see themn
pledgin. their fortunes, liberties, and lives, to one another, and
to the a-`onishment of the world, accomplishing their emancipation. And when emancipated, and transformed into an in
dependent nation, we see them calmly betaking themselves to
the organization o~ a government, under a constitution as wise
as it was singular, and whose excellency and competency the
experience uf more than thirty years has confirmed.-Simul
tanecous]y with these events, wvhat extensive conquests have
been made on the wilderness! Deserts have put on beaut'r
and fruitfulness, and a way been constantly extending towards
the waters of the Pacifick, for the advance of civilization andc
religion.
Had we the spirit of prophecy, in respect to the future condition of Amn -c,!:- this would not be the place to indulge it. No
nation, how ever, ever possessed, in a higher degree, the means
of national prosperity. Our territory is ample-our soil fertile
-our climate propitious-our citizens enterprising, brave, and
perseverLing. A sea coast of three thousand miles-inland sea.t

numerous canals, facilitate foreign and domestick trade. Being
free and independent of other nations, we can frame our laws,
and fashion our institutions, as experience and an enlightened
policy shall dictate. Our universities and colleges are yearly
qualifying numbers for the higher professions of life, while our
academies and schools are diffusing intelligence to an unparalleled extent, among our virtuLous yeomanry.
The Bible and the institutions of Christianity are with us,
and are presenting to us all the blessings which religion canr
impart. Thus circumstanced, what should prevent our country from advancing to that eminence of national happiness,
beyond which nati~onal happiness cannot extend?-" Manufactutres may here rlse -busy comimerce, inland and foreign,
distribute our sulplus produce, augment our capital, give energy to industry, improvement to roads, patronage to arts and
sciences, vigour to schools, and universality to the institutions
of religion; reconciling civil liberty with efficient govern
ment; extended population withl concentrated action; and unparalleled wealth with sobriety and mrnorality."
Let but the spirit, the practical wisdom, the religiousintegrity
of the first planters of our soil, prevail among rulers and subjects-let God be aclknowledged, by giving that place to his
word and institutions whlich they claim-and all these blessings
are ours. We shall enjoy peace with nations abroad, and tranquillity at home. As years revolve, the tide of our national
prosperity will Ilow broader and deeper. In the beautiful language of inspiration-" our sons will be as plants grown up in
their youth, and our d(aughters as corner stones, polished after
the similitude of a palace. Our garners will be full, including
all manner of stores, our sheep will bring forth bv thousands,
and ten thlousands; our oxen will be strong to labour, and there
will be n) breakingr in, or going out, or complaining in our
streets.-Happy is that people that is in such a case, yea, happy is that people whose God is the Lord.'tO1~'f nZ

of Henry the Great of France, he named MARIYLAND.
The next year, 1633, Lord Baltimore appointed his
brother, Leonard Calvert, goveri'our of the province, who,
with about two hundred planters, chliefly Roman Catholics,
began a settleminent, in 1634, near the mouth of the Potomnac, on the northern side.
Emigrants soon flocked to this province from England and
from the other colonies, on account of the greater religious
freedom eijoyed in it.
By the patent, the proprietor, with the consent of the freemen, or their delegates, was authorized to make all necessary
laws, not opposed to the laws of England; the king did not reserve a right to interfere in the government of the province.*
This was the original government of the colony of Maryland,
which, however, afterwards underweltt various modifications.
XIV. In 1633, the first house was erected in CONNEcTICUT. This was a trading house at Windsor, the materials of which some Plymouth adventurers sent in a vessel up Connecticut river.
On their arrival in the river, they found some Dutch,
from New-Amsterdam, who had previously heard of the
intended settlement at Windsor, occupying a fort, which
they had erected, where Hartfordc now stands. On the
approach of the Plymouth adventuLrers, the Dutch garrison ordered them to stop; but the commander gallantly
disregarded the order, and proceeded to Windsor.
Two years fromn this, 1635, aboutt sixty men, women,
and children, from Newtown and Watertown, in Massachusetts, commenced their journey through the wilderness
to Connecticut river. They settled at Windsor, Wethersfield, and Hartford.
The same year, John Winthrop, son, of the governour
of Massachusetts, arrived from England, with a commission, as governour of Connecticut, under lord Say and
Seal, and lord Brook, to whom the council of Plymouth
had given, in March, 1631, a patent of the territory.
Soon after Winthrop's arrival at Boston, he despatched a
barK of thirty tons with twenty men, to take possession of Connecticut river, and to build a fort at its mouth. This was accordingly erected, and called Saybrook fort. A few days after
their arrival, a Dutch vessel, from New Netherlands, appeared,
to take possession of the river; but, as the English had already
mounted two cannon, their landing was prevented.
The next June, 1 636, the Rev. Messrs. H-looker and Stone,
with a number of settlers, from Dorchester and Watertown,
removed to Connecticut. With no guide but a comnpass, they
made their way, one hundred miles over mountains, through
swamps and rivers. Their journey, whlich was on foot, lasted.fortnight, during which they,)lived upon the milk of their cows.
They drove one hundred and sixty cattle,
XV. This year, 163G, Roger Williams, hlaving been
banished from the colony of Massachusetts in 1634, removed with hiis family to Mooshawsic, and began a plantation, which he called Providence. Fromn thlis we date the
settlement of RsHODEISLAND.x
Wrilliams was a minister of Salem; on account of heretical
opinions, connected perhaps wifh erlrours of conduct, hie was
surmmoned, in 1 6306, to appear before the General Court, and
the ministers of the coleon. Mr. HIooker was appointed to dispute with him; but, beinm unable to reduce himn from his errours, he was sentenced by che coetrt to depart out of the jurisdiction withinii six weeks. All the mlinisters but one approved
the sentence.
In 1638, WViltliam Coddin.n': ton, lho h.as somrnetimes been called
the father of B Ihode Island, with eiohteen others removed fromr
~fia.ssachusetts, alnd havin purchaised of the Indians the Islanm
Aqutneck, bega?n a se4tlement on the northern part of it.
Others followed the next sutniner, and courmenc ed another settlement on the southwestern side,-ividin, the Island into two
townships; Portsmouth and l ewport.  They formed themselves into a body politick, and etlected Mr. Coddington chief
magistrate.
In 1640, the inhabitants of Providence agreed upo: a form
of government. P',oe isa a.d, so cal.led from a fancied resemblance t-, the anaciknt island of bhodes, soon began to be
extensively settled, both on account of its natural fertfility, and
naso on account of.the religious freedom allow ed to all denominations.
In 1644, Roger Williams visited England, as agent of the
settlers, and obtained of the earl of Warwick, one of the Ply
mouth company, a free charter of incorporation for Providence
and Rhode Island Plantations.

from the several towns, all to be chosen by the freemen.
XVI. The year 1637 is remarkable, in the history of
Connecticut, for the war with the Pequots-a tribe of Indians, whose principal settlement was on a hill in the present town of Groton.
Prior to this time, the Pequots had frequently annoyed the
infant colony, and in several instances had killed some of its
inhabitants. In March of this year, the commander of Saybrook fort, with twelve m-en, was attacked by them, and three
of his party killed. In April, another portion of this tribe assaulted the people of Wethersfield, as they were going to their
fields to labour, and killed six men and three wonmen. Two
girls were taken captive by them, and twenty cows were killed.
In this perilous state of the colony, a court was summoned at
Hartford, May l. After mature deliberation, it was determined that war should be cormmenced against the Pequots.
Ninety men, near ly half the fencible men of the colony, were
ordered to be raised-forty-two fi'om ITartford-thirty from
Windsor-and eighteen frorm Wethers field.
With these troops, together with seventy river and Mohe-an
Indians, Capt. Mason, to whom thlle command of the expedition
was given, dropped down the river Connecticut, to Sa-brook.
Here a plan of operations was forrrmed. On the twenty-sikth of
lay, about the dawn of day, cal r. Mason surprisetd M'stic,
one of the prineipal forts of the enemy, in the present towvn of
Stonington. On their near approach to the fort, a dog barked,
and an Indian who now discovered thenm, cried out, " 0 wanux!
O wanux!"7 Englishmen, Englishmnen.
The troops instantly pressed for{vard and fired. Tihe destruction of the enemy soon became terrible, but th-ey rallied at
length, and made a manly resistance. After a severe and pro
tracted conflict, capt. Mason and his troops being nearly ex
hausted, and victory still doubtfutl, he cried out to his men, ae
mtust burn them!
At the same instant, seizing a firebrand, he applied it to a
wigwam. The flames spread rapidly, on every side; and as
the sun r.se upon the scene, it showed the work of destruction
to be complete. Seventy wigwamrs wvere in ruins, and between
five and six hundred Indians lay bleeding on the grounld, or
smoulderiog in the ashes.
But though the victory was complete, the troops were now
in great distress. Besides twvo killed sixteen of their number
were wounded.   Their surgeon, mnedicines, and provisionswere on board some vess els oil tlPhir way to Pequiot hrarbGurt

Soon after, a detachmnent of nearly two hundred mewn, from

Sassacus, the great Bachbem of the Pequots, and his warriours,
were so appalled at the destLructioni of Mystic, tha;t they fled towards Hudson's river. The troops pursued them as far as a
great swamp in Fairfield, where another actiona took place, ini

To this- unioni the coloniies wvere strongly urged by a
sense of comimon d-anger from tI.e Inidianis, (Q general
comibinatioD of whom was expect-ed,) caid by the claims
and encroachments of thie Dutch, at Manhattan, NewYork'.
By these articles of un'ion, each colony retained its disti nc t
and separate government.~.-No two colonies mniigt,'o uinite'i

Upon notice that any colony was invladed., the rest- i-4,er inmme~
liately to despatcb assistance,This union subsisted more than forty years, until the charters
of the colonies were either taken away, or suspended by James
I. and his commissioners.
In 1648, Rhode-Island petitioned to be admitted to this confederacy but was denied, unless she would be incorporated witt
Ply'mouth, and lose her separate existence.-This shie refused,
and was consequently excluded.
The effects of this union onl the New-England colonies were
in a,high degree salutary.  On the completion of it, several
Indian sachems, among whom were tle chliefs of the Narraganset anid Moheagan tribes, came in, and submitted to the Enlish government.  The colonies also bec,ame formidable, by
means of it, to the Dutch. This union was also' made subservient to the civil and religious imiprovement of the Indians.
Prior to this period, Mr. Mayhew and the devoted Elliot had
made considerable progress towards civilizing the Indians, and
converting' them to Christianilty. They had learned the indian
langu,rage, and had preached to the Indians in their own tongue.
Upon a report in England of what these men had done, a society was formned fori propagating the Gospel among the Indians.
whichl sent over books, money, &amp;c. to be distributed by the
Commissioners of the United Colonies.
The Indians at _rst snade great opposition to Christianity;
and such was their aversion to it, that had they not been overawed by the United Colonies, it is probable they would have
put to death those among them who embraced it.-Such, however, were thie ardour, energy, andl ability of Messrs. Mayhew
and Elliot, aided by the countenance and support of government, and blessed by Providence. that in 1660, there were ten
towns of converted Indians in Massachusetts  In 1695, thei-e
were not less than three thousand aaut.ndian converts, in the
islands of Martha's Vineyard aiid Nantucket.
XXII. The colony of Connecticut, having petitioned
king Charles II. in 1662, through goverinour Winthrop,
for a charter of incorporation, his majesty grunted their
request, and issued his letters patent, April 2d, constituting them a body corporate and politick, by the name of
Thie Governour and Company of the English Colony of
Connecticut in iNew-Engla nd' in America.
The territory granted to lord Sav and Seal, and lord Broolc,
in 1631, and confirmed by this charter to Connecticut, was
bounded east by N arraganset river; south by Long-Island
sound; north by Massachusetts; and extended west to the Pap
cifick Ocean.
The charter of Connecticut ordained that there shnilid be a
Q13governour, deputy governour, and twelve assistants tobe chose:e
annually. The charter instituted two general assemblies foreach year, to consist of the above officers and deputies from the
towns; the former to compose the upper, and the deputies the
lower house. The government under the charter was essen
tially the same with that which the people had themselves
adopted, in 1639, and continued to be the constitution of the
colony and State of Connecticut until the year 1818.
This charter included the colony of leow-Haven; btut not
being agreeable to that colony, it did not uDite with Connecticut until two years after. Tlhe grantifng of a charter to Connecticut was followed the next year, 1663, by a similar grant
to Rhode-Island and Pirovidence Plantations, as already noticed,
XXIIIo The settlement of the Dutch at Manhlattan, in
1.615 and their submission to the government of Virginia,
which sent an expedition against them the same year, has
already been mentioned. But the succeeding governour
threw off the English yoke, and from that time they had
remnained independent of the English.-Belonging to a
different nation, and having differeit.+ interests, they availed themselves of every occasion to perplex and annoy
the New-England colonies.  They even laid claim to a
considerable part of Connecticut.
At length, king Charles II. sensible of the evil conse,
quences of having a Dutch colony in the heart of his American domninions determined to dispossess them. Accordingly, in the year 1664, he mnade a grant of the whole
country, including in it the several colonies of New-York,
New-Jersey, and Delaware to liis brother the dukeof York
and Albany.
An expedition was soon fitted out against thte Dutchb
under command of Col. Richard Nichols, who shortly
after appeared at Manhattan, and demanded a surrender~
To this demand, the Dutch governour, Stuyvesant, yield
ed, Aug. 27, being unprepared for defence.--Thus the
whole country passed into the hands of the English~1 inl
honour of the duke, the two principal Dutch settlements
were now namnedu New-York and Albany.

Dlutch, the duke of Yor k conveyed to lord Berkley, and
Sir'George Carteret, the territory of New-Jersey.  This
name was given it in compliment to Carteret, who had
been governour of the Isle of Jersey in the EnglishChannel. Soon after the grant, but before it was known, three
persons from Long-Island purchased of the natives a tract
which was called Elizabethtown grant, and a settlement
was begun at Elizabethltown.  In a few years emigrants
from various parts of Europe settled Newark, Middletowt,
and other places'.
The first settlement in Niew-Jersey was made three or foiir
years after the settlement-of Piymouth in New-England, by
some Dutchmen and Danes. The inhabitants were considerably numerous at the time of the surrender of the province to
the English government.
The next year, 1665, Philip Carteret, who had been
appointed governour by the proprietors, arrived at Elizabethtown, which he made the seat of government.   He
administered the government according to a coinstitution,
whichi the proprietors had formed.
This constitution ordained a free assembly, consisting of a
governour, council, and representatives, the latter to be chosen
by each town. The legislative power resided in the assembly
-the executive in the governour and council.
XXV. DELAWARE' was also included in the grant to
the duke of'Tork. At this time it was in the hands of
the Dutch, but an expedition was sent against it under Sir
Robert Carr, to whom it surrendered Oct. 1I 1664, soon
after w!ich, it was put under the authority of the English
governour 6f New-York.
Delaware was first settled in 167, by a number of Swedes
and Fins, who at the instance of Gustavus Adolphus, king of
Sweden, emigrated to America. They landed at Cape Henlopen, which on account of its beauty, they called Paradise
Point; the Delaware lthey named Swedeland Stream.
The Dutch at New Netherlands laid claim, however, to the
territory, and mutual contests subsisted for a Iong time between
them and the Swedes. After several times changing masters,
the territory finally surrendered to the Dutch, who held possession of it, at the time of hte English expedition against it uita

ard Nichols, Sir Robert Carr, George Cartwright, and
Samuel Maverick, Esqrs. entered upon the duties of a
commission from king Charles, "to hear and determine
complaints and appeals, inl all causes, as well military as
criminal and civil," within New-England, and to proceed
in all things for settling the peace and security of the
country.
The conduct of these cormmissioners was exceedingly
arbitrary and offensive to the colonies. Under pretext of
executing their commrnission, they received compiaints
against the colonies friomi the Indians required persons,
against the consent of the. people, to be admitted to the
privileges of freemen; to church membership, and full
communion; heard and decided in causes which had already been determined by thlle establislhed courts; and
gave protection to criminals. After involving the colonies in great embarrassment and expense, they were at
length recalled, and the country saved'f'om impending

XXVII. In the year 1663, the tract of country, extendAig from the 36th degree of north latitudle to the river
St. Matheo, was erected into a province by the namne of
CAROLINA, So called in honour of Charles IX. king of
France, under'whose patronae the coast hacd been discover'ed in 1563.
This tract was conveyed, by charter of Charles I.
King of England, at this time, to Lord Clarendon, and
seven others, who were made absolute proprietors of the
territory, and invested with ample powers to settle and
govern it. Two years after, the charter was confi-rmed
and enlarged, so as to embrace the whole territory, now
divided into the two Carolinas, Georgia, and the Flori
das.
As ealy as 1650, a settlement was beogun in Albemnarle
county, by planters from Virginria, and emrnigrants fromn other
places. This seattlement was placed by tlhe proprietors, under
Lfe supe ntendeace of Sir William Berkley, governour of Viv        PERIOD iI....1607....1689....SETTLEMENTS.   37
ginia, who was instructed to visit it, and to appoint a governour
and council of six for it.
The attention of the proprietors was next turned to the country south of Cape Fear, which they erected into a county by
the name of Clarendon. Tiis counfty was settled in 1665, by
emigrants from the island of Barbadoes. Sir John Yeamans,
who was from that island, was appointed governour, and a separate government granted, similar to that of Albemarle.
In 1669, another settlement was mnade still further south, at
Port Royal, under tihe direction of William Sayle, who was appointed the first governour. T'he name of this county was Carteret. Thus threedistinct governments were forme,d in Carolina.
In 1671, Gov. Sayle, dissatisfied with the situation of Port
Rcyal, remroved to the northward and took possession of a neck
of land between Ashley and Cooper's river. Here was laid
the foundation of a town called Charlestown. Nine years after,
however, the inhabitants removed to "the Oyster Point, where
C'harleston, the present capital of South Carolina, was begun.
The place which they left went by the name of " the Old
T.own."
In consequence of the unhealthiness of the climate, Governour Sayle died shortly afif&amp; his removal to Old Charleston,
upon which this colony was annexed to the governmentL of that
of Clarendois under governour Yeamans, and the three governments were reduced to two.
During the administration of governour Sayle, a constitution,
prepared at the request of the proprietors, by the celebrated
lVfr. Locke, was attemnpted to be put inll force.
B3y this constitution, a president of a palatine court, to consist of the proprietors, was to be chosen for life. An hereditary nobility was to be established, consisting of landgraves
caciques. A parliament, chosen once in two years, was
to be held, consisting of the proprietors, of the nobility, and of
reoresentatives from each district. All were to meet mn one
apartment, and have an equal voice. No business, however,
could be proposed in parliament, until it had been debated in a
grand council, to consistof the governour, nooility, and deputies of proprietors.
This constitutionit was found impossible to reduce to practice. Great opposition was made to it; and in Albemarle an
insurrection was occasioned by an attempt to enforce it. It
was therefore at lehgth abandoned, and the former proprietary
government restored. This latter sort of government continued from 1669 to 1729, when the proprietors surrendered their
title and int'rest to the King of lEngland. The province wag

now divided into North and South Carolina, and their governours and councils'were appointed by the crown
XXVIII. This year, 1675, began the memorable war
in New-England, with the Indians, called King Philip's
war; by whicht the peace of the colonies was greatly disturbed, and their existence for a time seriously endangered.
For several years previous to the opening of the war, thle Inadians had regarded the English with increasing jealousy. They
saw them growing in numbers, and rapidly extending their
settlements. At the same time their own hunting grounds
were visibly narrowing, and their power and privileges sensibly decreasing. The prospect before them was humbling to
the haughty descendants of the original lords of the soil.
The principal exciter of the Indians at this timne against the
English, was Philip, sachem of the Wampanoags, grandson
and successor of Masassoit, who, fifty years before, had made a
treaty with the colony of Plymouth. Philip's residence was
at Mount HElope, Bristol, Rhode-Island.
- The immediate cause of the war was the execution of three
Indians by the Englislh, whom Philip had excited to murder
one Sausaman, an Indian missiona W;. Sausaman, being friendly
to the English, had informed them that Philip, with several
tribes, was plotting their destruction.
The execution of these Indians roused the anger of Phiiip,
who immediately armed his men, and commenced hostilities
Their first attack was made June 24th, upon the people of
Swanzey. in Plymouth colony, as they were returning home
from public worship, on a day of humiliation and prayer, under
the apprehension of the approaching war. Eight or nine persons were killed.
The country was immediately alarmed, and the troops of the
colony flew to the defence of Swanzev. On the 28th, a company of horse and a company of foot, with one hundred and ten
volunteers from Boston, joined the Plymouth forces at Swan-,ey.  The next morning an attack was made upon somne o'
Philip's men, who were pursued and five or six of them killed
This resolute conduct of the English made a deep impression
on the enemy  Philip with his forces left Mount Ilope the
same night-marking his route, however, with the burning of
houses, and the scalping of the defenceless inhabitants.
Ih It being known that the Narragansets favoured the cause of
Philip, he having sent his women and children to them for protection, the-Massachusetts forces under Capt. Hutchinson proeeded forthwitlh into their countrvy, either to renew'a treaty        PERIOD I....1607....1689....SETTLEMENTS.  3
with them, or to give them battle. Fortunately, a treaty was
concluded, and the troops returned.
On the 17th of July, news arrived that Philip, with his warriours, was in a swamp at Pocasset, now Tiverton. Thtie Massachusetts and Plymouth forces immediately marched to that
place, and the next day resolutely charged thie enemy in their
recesses. As the troops entered the swamp, the Indians continued to retire. The English in vain pursued, till the approach
of night, when the commander ordered a retreat. Mlany of
the English were killed, and the enemy seemed to take courage.
It being impossible to encounter the Indians with advantage
in the swamps, it was determined to starve tthem out; but
Philip apprehending their design, contrived to escape withl his
forces.
Ie now fled to the Nipmucks, a tribe in Worcester county,
Massachusetts, whom he induced to assist him. This tribe had
already commenced hostilities against the English; but, in the
hope of reclaiming them, the governour and council sent Captain Wheeler and Hutchinsonto treat with them. But the Indians, having intimation of their coming, lurked in ambush for
them, fired upon them as they approached, killed eight men,
and mortally wounded eight more, of whoin Capt. Hutchinson
was one.
The remainder of the English fled to Quaboag, Brookfield.
The Indians, however, closely pursued them into the town,
and burnt every house excepting one, in which the inhabitants
had taken refuge.  This house at length they surrounded.
" For two days they continued to pour a stormr of musket balls
upon it, and although countless numbers pierced through the
walls, but one person was killed. With long poles, they next
thrust against it brands, and rags dipped in brimstone; they
shot arrows of fire; they loaded a cart with flax and tow, and
with long poles fastened together, they pushed it against the
house. Destruction seemed inevitable. The house was kindling, and the sava-es stood ready to destroy the first that should
open the door to escape. At this awvful nmoment a torrent of
rain descended, and Suddenlyextinguished thekindling flames."
August 4th, Major Willardcl came to their relief, raised the.
siege, and destrdyed a considerable number of the assailants.
During the month of Septemnber, Hadley, Deerfield, and
Northfield, on Connecticut river, were attacked; several of.
the inhabitants were killed, and many buildings consumed.
On the 18th, Captain Lathrop, with several teams and eighty
young men, the flower of the county of Essex, were sent to
Deerfield to transport a quantity of grain to Hadley. On their
return, stopping to gather grapes at Mtuddc Brook, they, weresuddenly attackled by near eig'ht hundred Indi,ans. Resistance
was in vain, and seventy of these young men fell before the
merciless enemy, and were butried in one grave. Captain
iMosely, who was at Deerfield, hearing the report of the guns,
hastened to the spot, and withl a few men, attacked tlhe Indians,
killed ninety-six, and wounded fbrty, losing himself but two
men.
Early in October, the Springf,eld Indians, who hadl hitherto
been firiendly to the English, concerted a plan, with the hostile
tribes, to burn that town. Having, under cover of night, received two or three hundred of Philip's men into their fort,
with the assistance of these, they set fire to the town. T'he
plot, however, was discovered so seasonably, that troops arrived from Westfield in time to save the town, excepting thirtytwo houses, already consumed.
Soon after hostilities were commenced by Philip, the Tarrenteens began their depredations in New- -Hampshire, and the
Province of Maine. They"robbed the boats and plundered the
lhouses of the English. JIn September they fell on Saco, Scarborough, and Kittery, killed between twenty and thirty of the
inhabitants, and consigned their houses, barns, and mills, to
the flames.
Elated with these successes, tley next advanced towards
Piscataqua, committing the same onti;-ges at Oyster river,
Salmon Falls, Dover and Exeter. Before winter, sixty of the
English in that quarter were killed, and nearly as many
buildings consumed.
The Indians in those parts, however, had real ground of complaint. Some seamen, hearing it reported that lndian children
could swim by instinct, overset the canoe of Squando, sachem
of the Saco Indians, in whiclh were his squaw and infant child.
This act Squando could not overlook, especiaTl.y as some time
after the chiild died, and, as the sacliem believed, on account of
some injuiy that it tlhen received. Besides this, several Indians
had been enticed on board a vessel, carried off, and sold into
slavery. To redress thlese wrongs, the Indians commenced
hostilities.
Notwithstanding thle Narragansets had pledeged thlemselves
by their treaty not to engage in the war against the English,
it was discovered that they were taking part with the enemy.
It was deemed necessary, therefore, for the safety of the colonies, early to check that powverful tribe.
Accordingly, governour Winslow of Plymouth, wiLh about
one thousand eight hundred troops from' Massaclusetts and
Connecticut, and one lhundred and sixty friendly Indians, cornimenced their mnarclI from Petfyquamseot, on tlhe 19th of De.PERIOD II....1607....1689....SETTLEMENTS.  41
cember, 1675, through a deep snow, towards the enemy, who
were in a swamp about fifteen miles distant.
The army arrived at the swaminp at one in the afternoon.
Some Indians at the edge of the swamp were fired upon, but
fled. The whole army now entered and pursued the Indians
to their fortress.
This stood on a rislng ground, in the middle of the swamrnp.
It was a work of great strength and labour being composed of
palisades, and surrounded by a hedge about sixteen feet i
thickness.
One entrance only led to the fort, through the surrounding
thicket. Upon this the English providentially fell; and without waiting to form, rushed iminpetuously towards the fort. The
English captains entered first. The resistance of the Indians
was gallant and warlike. Captains Johnson and Davenport,
with many of their men, fell at the entrance. At length the
Engwlish gave back, and were obliged to retreat out of the fort.
At this crisis, the arI1y being on the point of a fatal repuLse
somne Connecticut men on the opposite side t;f the fort, disco
vered a place destitute of palisades; they insi,ntly sprang into
the fort, fell upon the rear of the Indians, atnd, aided by the
rest of' the army, after a desperate conflict, achieved a complete
victory. Six hundred wigwams were now set on fire. The
scene was awful. Deep volutnmes of smoke rolled up to heaven, mingling with the dyinr shrieks of mothers and infants, whiie the ared and infirm were consuming in the fladmes.
Even at this distant period, we cannot recali this scene without pain,/ anld can justify this severity of our ancestors, only
by -admitting its necessity for self-preservation.
The Indians in the fort were estimiated at four thousand; of
these seven hsundred warriours were killed; and three hundred
died of their wounds; three hundred were taken prisoners, and
as many womzen and children. The rest, except such as wevre
consumed, fled.
The victory of the Engieh, complete as it was, was purchased with blood. Six brave captains fell; eighty of the troOps
were killed or mortally wounded; andl one hundred and fifty
were woimded who recovered.
From this defeat the Indianrs never recovered. They wvere
not yet, however, effectually subdued. During- the-winter they
still continued to murder and burn. The towns of Lancaster,
Medfield, Weymouth, Groton, Springfield, Northampton, S9udbury, and Marlborough, in Massachusetts,and of Warwick and
Provcidence, in Rhode-Island, were assaulted, and soine of th,.em
partly, and others wh6lly destroyed. In March, Capt. Piercewith fifty Englishl, and twent- Xliendly Indians: were M.acked
4,and every Englishman, arnd most of the Indians, were slainr.
In April, Captain Wadsworth, marching- with fifty men to the
relief of Sudbury, was surrounded, and all either killed on the
spot, or reserved for lonrg and distressing tortures.
The success of the Indians, during the winter, hlad been
great; but on the return of spring, the tide turned against
them. The rarraganset country was scoured, and many of
the natives were killed, among wIoi was Canonchlet, their
chief sachem.
On the 12th of ALugust, 16 76, the finishing stroke was given
to the war in the United colonies, by the dceath of Philip. After his flight from Mount Hone, lie had attemnpted to rouze tihe
Mohlawks against the Englisi. T'o effect his purpose, he kill.ed, at several times, some of thlat tribe, and laid it to the
English. B13ut his iniqinty was discovered, and hlie was obligedc
hlastily to flee. He returned at lentlh to Mount Htope.
Tidings of his retirn were brought to Captain Churchi, a
man who had been of eminent serv,ice in this war, and who was
better able,than any other person to provide against the wiles
of the enemy. Capt. Clhurch  immediately pioceeded to the
place of Philip's concealrnent, near iN/ount Hlope, accompanied
by a small body of men. On iis arrivral, wl'fich was in the
night, he placed his men in ambushes roiund the swamip, charging them not to move till dayliglht, that they might distinguish
Philip, should he.attempt to escape. Sncuh wvas hlis confidence
of success, that taking itajor Sandlbrd by the hand, he said,' It is scarcely possible that Philip should escape." At that
instant, a bullet whistled over'Lltheir heads, and a volley followed.
The firing proceeded from Philip, and his men, whlo wlere in
view. Perceiving his peril, the savage chief, desperately
snatched hlis powder horn and gun, and rar fiercely towardcs ilbspot where an Englishman and Indian lay concealed.--The
English soldier levelled his gun, but it missed fire: the Indian
fired, and shot Philip tlhnough the hleart.
Captain Church ordered him to be beheaded, and quartered.
The Indian who executed this order, pronounced the warriotrns epitaph: " You have been one vTery great man. Yoi'have made many a man afraid cf youi. B13ut so big as you b)e, I
will now chop you to pieces."
Thus fell a savage lero and patriot of whose transcendant
abilities our history filrnishles melancholv evidence.-The advantage of civilized education, and a wider theatre of action,
might have made the name of Phlilip of Mount Hope, as memorable as that of Alexander, or Cusar.
After the death pf Philip, the war continu ed in tLhe provinceof Maine, till the spring of 1678. But westward, the Indians
having lost thleir chiefs, wigwams, and provisions, and perceiving further contest vain, came in singly, by tens and hundreds,
and submitted to the Entislh.
Thus closed a melancholy period in the annals of New-Enland history; during which, six hunrdred men, the flower of her
strengthi, had fallen; twelve or thirteen towns had been destroyed, and six hundred dwelling houses consumed. Every
eleventh family was houseless, and every eleventh soldier had,runk to his grave. So costly was the inheritance whicht our fathers liave transmitted to us.
XXIX. The grant of thle territory of New-York, by
Charles I!. to his brother thle duke of York, in 1664, has
already been noticedc, as also its capture from the Dutchi
hlie samne year.  In 1673, a war comnmencing between
England andl Iolland, the latter sent a small fleet to NewYorlk, and the town immediately surrendered.
The following year, 1674, the war terminated, and a
treaty was conclutded between Enogland and IHolland. By
this treaty New-York was restorled to the Englishi.  To
prevnt controversy about Lis title to the territory, the
Duke of York took out a new patent, and appointed Sir
l;Edmunnd Andross governour, wl,ho entered upon the duties
of his appoinfment, in October of the same year.
rThe administration of Andross, however was arbitrary
and severe. IHe admitted the people to noslhare in legislation, btut ruled them by laws to w-hich they had never
given their assent.
Connecticut also experineed the weight of his oppression
and despotism. That part of her territory west of Connecticut
river, although long(r before grantedo to the colony of Connectiwut, was included in the -ant to the duke of York. By virtue
if this grant, Aniross now claimned jurisdiction over the terri
tory, and in J:'.?,r 1675, rondn arn attempt with an armed force,
to talke possession of Saybrook Ftort.
The governour and councl oL Connecticut, having notice of
his comin,, sent Ca.pt. Bul1l to defend thle fort. On the arrival
of Andross at the mouthl of the river, after maling a shlow of
fIorce, he invited Capt. LBull to a conference. This was granted; but no sooner had lhe landed, than hle attempted to read
his commission, and thle duke's patent. This Capt. Bull firmly
and positively forb.id, and Sir Edmuond, finding the colony de4344      PERIOD II....1607....1689....SETTLEMENTS.
termined, at all events, not to submit to his government,'relinquished hiis design, and sailed for Long-Island.
XXX. But the colonies had cther troubles to experience, and other enemies to combat. In 1676, while the
Indian war was still going on, complaints were madle in
England against'thie colonies, for violating the acts of
trade.  These acts imposed oppressive customs upon certain commodities, if imported from any country besides
England., or if transported from one colony to another.
The acts were considered by the colonies as unjust, impolitick, and cruel. For several years they paid little attention to them, and his majesty at length required, that
agents should be sent to.England to answer in behalf of
the colonies for thiese violations.
By the acts of trade none of the colonies suffered more
than Virginia and Maryland, their operation being greatly
to lessen the profits on their tobacco trade, from whlich a
great portion of their wealth was derived. In addition to
these sufferings, the colony of Virginia, in violation of
chartered rights, was divided, and conveyed away in proprietary grants. Not only uncultivated woodlands were
tlh,us conveyed, but also plantations, which had long been
possessed, and improved accordin to law and charter.
The Virginians complained, petitioned, remonstrated-.
but without effect. Agents were sent to England, to lay
their grievances at the foot of the throne, but agents were
unsuccessful. At length their oppression became insupportable, and the discontent of the people broke out into
open insurrection.
At the head of this insurrection was placed one Nathaniel
Bacon, an Englishman, who, soon afte-, his arrival, had been
appointed a mrember of the council. I-e,as a young man of
commanding person, and great enerny and entlerprise.
The colony at this time was engaged in war with the SusouehLannah Indians. Bacon despatched a rnesseng-er to govelrnour
Berkley, requesting a commission to go against the Indians.
This commission the governour refusedQ -rod, at tile same time
ordered Bacon to dismnss his men, and, on penallty of being declaied a rebel, to appear before himnself aAd the couneil. Exasperated by suc  t?etment, Bacon, woithot disbanding the        IPERYOD I....1607.....69...39SETTLEMENTS.  45
rest of his men, proceeded in a sloop with forty of them, to
Jamestown. Here a quarrel ensued, and Berklev illegally suspended him from thle council. Bacon departed in a rage, with
his sloop and men, but the governour pursued hiim, and adopted such measures that lhe was taken, and brought to James,
torwn.
Finding thlat lhe had_ dismissed Bacon from the council illegaily, he now admitted him again and treated him kindly.
Soon after, Bacon renewed his importunity for a comnmission
against the Indians. Beingq unable to effect his purpose he left
Jamestown privately, but soon appeared again with six hundred
volunteers, and demanded of the assembly, then sifting, the required commission. Being overawed, the assembly advised the
governour to grant it. But soon after Bacon had departed,
the governour, by the same advice, issued a proclamation, denouncing him as a rebel.
Hearing what the governour hlad done, Bacon, instead of
marching against thle Indians, returned to Jamestown, wreaking his vengeance upon all who opposed him. Governour Berkley fled across the bay to Accomack, but thle spirit of rebellion
had gone before him. He therefore found himself unable to
resist Bacon, who now ranged the country at pleasure.
At length the governour, with a smrall force, under command
of major Robert Beverly, crossed the bay to oppose the malecontents. Civil war hlad now commenced. Jamestown wa
burnt by Bacon's followvers; va1rious parts of the colony were
pillaged, and the wives of those that adhered to the goverrnour's party were carried to the camp of the insurgents.
In the midst of these commrotions it pleased the Suprenie
vlxei to withdraw Baeon by a natural death. The malecontentss thus left to recover their reason, now began to disperse.
T"o of' B     acon's generais surrendered, and were pardoned, and
th-e people ouietly reftrined to 1lheeir homes.
Upon this Beri;ley resumed the government, and peace w-as
restored. This rebeihon foralnmed an era of some note in the
history of Virginia, and. its unlapey efiects were felt for thirty
years. During its coentinuance, husbandry was almost entirely
neglected, and isuchl havoclk was made among all kinds of cat
tle, that the people were threatened with distressing famine.
Sir William IBerleey, after havTin been forty years governour
of Virginia, returned to England, where he soon after died.
Three years after, 16 79, lord Culpepper was sent over as governour, with certain laws prepared in conformity to the wishes
of the ministry of England, and designed to be enacted by the
assembly in Virginia. One of those lWss provided for raising
a. revenute for the support of government. It mnade the dutiesperpetual, and placed them under the direction of his majesty.
Out of the duties, Culpepper dishonestly took as his salary, two
thousand pounds, and one hundred and sixty more for house
rent.
On presenting these laws to the assembly, Culpepper informed them that in case they were passed, he had instructions
to offer pardon to all who had been concerned in Bacons rebellion; but if not he had commissions to try and hang them as
rebels, and a regimnent ol soldiers on the spot to support him,
The assembly, thus threatened, passed the laws.
XXXI.    In the year 1676, the province of New-Jersey
was divided into East arind West Jersey, and continued
thus divided until 1702, wlhen the proprietors surrendered
the government to the crown under Queen Anne, upon
which the two provinces were united into one.
The two proprietors of New-Jersey were Lord Berkley, and
Sir George Cartaret. In 1674, lord Berkley made a conveyance of his half to John FenWick, in trust for Edward Billinge,
and his assigns. B3illinge, being in debt, presented his interest
in the province to his creditors, William Jones and others being appointed trustees to dispose of the lands.
In the divisioni which thus tookli place, Cartaret took East

of Bellinge, West Jersev. The duke of York, though he had
conveyed away his powvers of government, when he sold the
province to Berkley and Cartareo, in C1664 unjustly clairned
West Jersey, as a dependency of New-York.
Until 1680, this depesidencs was maintained when the duke
of York, after much solicitation, relitquished his claim, and
restored to the proprietors, the rioLt granted by his patent of
1664. In 16832, Cartaret disgusted with the people, sold his
right to East Jersey to VWilliam Penn, and othlers, who inamediately sold one lhalfof it to t,e earl of Perth, a-nd his associateso
PRobert Barclay, the celebrated author of "the Apology for
the Quakers," was tlhe next year made governour of East
Jersey.
In 1666, both the Jerseys ancld New-York, were annexed te
New-England, and continued so till the accession of William
and Mary to the throne of England, in 1689. " A government
under the proprietors of both the Jerseys, had become extremely disagreeable to the inhabitants: who, fiom various caLuses,
become so uneasy, that thie proprietors surrendered the government of East and West Jersey to the crown in 170.2, which

Cornbury was appointed governour over the united colony, and
received his commission and instructions from the queen.
"The freemen chose the house of representatives, consisting
of twenty-four members, but the governour and council, consisting of twelve, members, were appointed by the crown.
New-York and New-Jersey had, till the year 1738, a common
governour; but at this time a separate governour was appointed over the latter province."
XXXII. In 1677, a controversy which had subsisted
for some time between the colony of Massachusetts and
the heirs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, relative to the province of Maine, was settled in England, and the colony
adjudged to Gorges' heirs. Upon this, Massachusetts
Durchased the title for one thousand two hundred pounds
sterling, and the territory, from that time till 1820, was
a part of Massachusetts.
Both the colony of Massachusetts, and the heirs of Gorges
claimed the province of Maine: the former by virtue of her
patent of 1628, which was construed as including that territory; the claim of the latter was founded upon a charter granted to Gorges, in 1639.
XXXIII. Two years after this adjustment, viz. in
1679, a commission was made out, by order of. Charles
II. for the separation of New-anmpshlire from the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, and its erection into a royal province.  The form of government sent over by the king,
ordained a president and council to govern the province,
with an assemnblyv, &amp;c. The assembly to be chosen by
the people; the president and council to be appointed by
the crown.
In 1629, the Plymouth company granted to John Mason the
territory called New-Hampshire. About the year 1640, the
settlements now being conlsiderable, the patent holders agreed
to assign their right of jurisdiction to Massachusetts. The colony of New-Ham:-shime, therefore, remained under the government of Massachusetts,, until it was separated by the king's
commission, in 1679.
The first legislative assembly, under the above commission,
was convened March 16, 1680, when the colony of New-Hampshire was declared to be independent of Massachusetts. This
separation. however, was disagreeable to most of the people;
for near forty years thoy hiad enjoyed under Massachusetts the~ttvoButttiot
What are tike uses and advantages of History  
1. History sets before us striking instances of virtue
enterprise, courage, generosity, patriotism; and, by a
natural principle of emulation, incites us to copy sluch noble examples. History also presents us with pictures of
the vicious ultimately overtaken by misery and shame,
and thus solemnly warns us against vice.
2. History, to use the words of Professor Tytler, is the
school of politics.  That is, it opens the hidden springs
of human affairs the causes of the rise, grandeur, revoiu.
tions and fall of empires; it points out the influence whicil
the manners of a people exert upon a government, and
thie influence which that government reciprocally exerts
upon the manners of a people; it illustrates the blessings
of political union, and the miseries of faction; the dangers of unbridled liberty, and the mischiefs of despotic
plower.
Observation. In a free country, where every man may be
called upon to discharge imnportant duties, either by his vote,
or by the administration of office, it is the business of all to be
more or less acquainted with the science of politics. Nothing
can better instiruct us in this, than the study of history.
3. HIlistory displays the dealings of God with mnankind.,
It calls upon us often to regard with awe, his darker judg'
nients, anid again it awakens the liveliest emotions of gratittde, for his kind and benignant dispensations.  It cultix ates a sense of dependence on him; strengthlens our confidence in his benevolence;- and impresses us with a conviction of his justice.
4. Besides these advantages, thie study of History, if
properly conducted, offers others, of inferior importance,
indeed, but still they are not to be disregarded,  It chastens the imagination: improves the taste; filrnishles matter for reflection; enlarges the range of thought' strengtlhens and disciplines the mindl.48      PERIOD 1..ol..607....1607....SETTLEMENTSo
privilege of choosing their own rulers, and had derived great
peace and-harmony from an impartial government.  Noi did
this province long enjoy tranquility. Mason, grandson of the
Mason to whom New-Hampshire had been originally granted,
came over the next year, and demanded, by virtue of his clailms
to the soil, a seat in the council. This being granted, he soon
after returned to England, and surrendered a parit of his claim.
to the king, and mortgaged the remainder to Edward Cran
field, who was appointed lieutenant governour, and shortly af
ter repaired to New-Hampshire.
It is necessary to add, that the -Rev. Mr. WVheelrighlt a-nd
others in 1629, the same year that the grant was made to MeJa
son by the Plymouth companvy, bought ofL the Indians a large
tract of land in New--Hanpshlire. The same land was, thlerefore, claimed under both these grants, and the foundation thus
laid of serious disputes in the colony.
Cranfield, finding it for his interest to favour the claim of Mason to the province, soon called upon the inhabitants to take
their leases under him  Suits were instituted against all the
landholders who neglected this call, and the jurors being selected by Cranfield, and interesed in the result, uniformly gave
udgmnent against themn.
Under these oppressions, the people despatched an agent,
with comiplaints to his majesty, a,fainst the governour. After
a hearing by the lords of t- ae, ithe iniquitous conduct of Cranfield was represenrted to the kng, who recalled hIim.
It may be proper to add, that the above controversy about
the claims of Mason continued loing to disturb the peace of the
province, and was not finally terminated until the death of
Samuel Allen, in 1715, to whom the heirs of Mason had sold
their claim for seven hundred andi fifty pounds; upon his demise, no one appeared to renevw the claims, and the question
dropped.
XXXIV. Inr 1681, King Charles II. granted to William Penn, son of Admiral Penn, in consideration of debts
due the latter, for sevices done to the crown, the territory
of PENNSXYLVANIA, So0 called after Penn himself.
This patent encroached on the territory of Lord Batimore
in Maryland, one whole degree, or sixty-nine miles and a half;
and on the north, nearly three hundred miles, across the whole
territory conveyed to Connecticut, in 1631,* and confirmed by
* See page 33, where the boundaries of the territory granted to
Connecticut are givesithe royal charter of 1662. Hence arose contentions between
the colonies of Pennsylvania and Connecticut, about boundaries, that were not settled till a century after. WVithin a short
time from the date of the grant by king Charles to Penn, two
other conveyances were made to him by the duke of York.
One was a bill of sale of New-Castle, and a territory of twelve
miles around it. The other was a bill granting a tract soutfh
of the former, as far as Cape Henlopen.  These two deeds
embraced tie whole state of Delaware. At this time Delaware was divided into three counties, which, in 1662, were annexed to Pennsylvania, although they had a separate assembly,
in which the governour of Pennsylvania presided.
The patent of king Charles to Penn provided for the king's
sovereignty, and for obedience to British acts, regarding commerce. It gave power to the proprietor to assemble the freemen, or their delegates, as he should judge most convenient;
for levying monies and enacting laws, not contrary to the laws
of England.
In May, 1631, Penn sent one Markham, wvith a few others,
to take possession and prepare for a settlement. The next
year, Penn published a form of government, by which the supreme power was lodged in a general assemnbly, to consist of a
governour, council, and house of delegates. Tihe council and
hlouse to be chosen by the freemen. The proprietor and governour to preside, and to have a treble voice in the council,
which was to consist of seventy-two members.
It was also agreed, that every person of good moral character, professing his faith in Christ, should be a freeman, and capable of holding any office; and that none who believed in one
God, should be molested in his religion, or be compelled to atlend, or maintain religious worship.
In October, Penn, with two thousand planters, mostly
Quakers, arrived at New-Castle. In December he convoked
an assembly; but so few delegates appearing, he ordered, that
instead of seventy-two, three members only should constitute
the council, and nine the house of assembly.
Penn now ente;ed into a treaty with the Indians, of whom
he purchased large tr_cts of territory; at the same time he
commenced the city of Philadelphia, which, in one tear, increased to a hundred houses and cottages.
Pennsylvania had a more rapid and prosper6us settlement
than any of the other colonies. This was doubtless. owing partl:y to its healthful climnate and fruitful soil, partly to the fact,
that the great obstacles of settlement had been overcomne by the
other colonies, and partly to the religious tolerance, mildness,
49and equity, which characterized its laws, and their administration.
In 1683, Penn, at the request of the freemen, granted them
a new charter, by which eighteen persons were to form the
council, and thirty-six the assembly. The next year, Penn
himself returned to England.
The lasting prosperity of Pennsylvania, the foundation of
which must be traced to his wisdom and benevolence, is an
eloquent eulogium upon his character.
XXXV. In the year 16849 June 18, an event highly
interesting to the colony of Massachusetts took place in
England. This was a decision in the high court of chancery, that she had forfeited her charter, and that henceforth her government should be placed in the hands of
the king.
The person chiefly instiruimental in bringing about this event
was Edmund Randolph, a man who had long been the enemy
ofthe colonies, and who, for several years, had filled the ears
of the king with complaints against them for violating the acts
of trade.
To answer to these complaints, Massachusetts repeatedly incurred the expense of sending agents to England, and of maintaining them there; b,t his majesty would accept of no conditions, short of a surrender of her charter. As she would not
make this surrender voluntarily, it was violently wrested from
her.
XXXVI. Before king Charles had time to adjust the
affairs of the colony he died, and was succeeded by James
II.  Soon after his accession, similar proceedings took
place against the other colonies. Rhode-Island submitted, and gave up her charter.  Plymiouth sent a copy of
her charter to the king, with a humble petition that he
would restore it. Connecticut voted an address to his.
majf.sty, in which she prayed him to recall the writ that
had been filed against her, and requested the continuance
of her charter.
The petitions and rernonstrances of the colonies were
however' of no avail, Both the heart and hand of the
king were manifestly against them. After all their hardships and dangers in settling a wilderness, they had no
other prospect before them than the destruction of thelTdearest rights, and no better security of life, liberty, and
property, than the capricious will of a tyrant.
In pursuance of this cruel policy towards the colonies,
two years after the charter of Massachusetts was vacated,
king James commissioned and sent out Sir Edmund Andross as governour of all New-England, Plymouth excepted. He arrived at Boston, Dec. 20 1686.
The commencement of his administration was comparatively auspicious. In a few months, however, the fair
prospect was changed. Among other arbitrary acts, restraints were laid upon the freedom of the press, and marriage contracts. The liberty to worship in the congregational way was threatened, and the fees of all officers of
government were exorbitantly and oppressively enhanced.
In October, Sir Edmund and suite, with a guard of about
sixty regular troops, went to Hartford, where the assembly of
Connecticut was in session. He entered the house of the assembly, demanded the charter of Connecticut, and declared the
colonial government to be dissolved.
Extremely reluctant to surrender the charter, the assembly
inte-ntionally protracted its debates till evening, when the charter was brought in, and laid on the table.-Upon a preconcerted signal, the lights were at once extinguiished, and a Capt.
Wadsworth seizing the charter, hastened away under cover of
night, and secreted it in the hollow of an oak.  The candles,
which had been extinguished, were soon relighted without disorder; but the charter had disappeared. Sir Edmund, however, assumed the government, and the records of the colony
were closed.
XXXVII. The condition of the New-England colonies was now distressing, and as the administration of
Andross was becoming still mornoe severe and oppressive,
the future seemed not to promise alleviation. But Providence wa`s invisibly preparing the way for their relief.
Nov. 5th, i688, William, Prince of Orange, who married
Mary, daughter of James LI. landed at Torbay, in England, aniid, comnpelling James II. to leave the kingdom, assumed the crown, being proclaimed Feb. 16th, 1689, to
the general joy of ilthe nation.
51XXXVIIL I        annrrv    of tflj  (0Ianitto.      In
the colonies of North America, at the close of this period,
three varieties of character might be distinguished.  In
New-England, the strict puritanical notions of the people
wrought a correspondent austerity upon thte manners of
society. Placing implicit faith in the Scriptures, they
mraoulded their government, and shaped private character
and morals upon a severe and literal construction of
them.   They were devout-patriotic-industrious-and
public spirited; and though of a grave, reflecting exte.
rior, they often showed that shrewd inquisitiveness and
keen relish of a jest, which are still characteristic of the
New-Englanders.
The laws of the colonies throw some light on the views and
nraanners of the people. A1s examples, in 1639, the drinking of
healths was prohibited by law in Miassachusetts. In 1651, the
legislature of that colony prohibited all persons, whose "estate
did not exceed twvo hundred pounds, from wearing any gold o1
silver lace, or any bone lace above two shillings per yard."7
The law authorized the select mnen to take notice of the costliness and fashion of the " apparel of the people, especially in
the wearing of ribands and g-reat boots." The New-Haven
colony, in 1639, resolved that they would be governed by the
rules of Scripture; and that church members only should act
in the civil affairs cf the Plantation.
In 1647, the colony of Connecticut expressed their disap
probation of the use of tobacco, by an act of assemnbly, iv
which it was ordered, "thlat no person under the age of twenty years, nor any other that hath already accustomed himsel
to the use thereof, shall take any tobacco, until he shall have
brought a certificate from under the lhand of some who are
approved for knowledge and skill in physic, that it is useful
for him; and also that he hath received a license from the court
for the same." AUl others, who had addicted themselves to the
use of tobacco, were, by the same court, prohibited taking it in
any company, or at their labours, or on their travels, unless
they were ten miles at least from any house, or more than once
a day, though not in company, on pain of a fine of sixpenc3
for each tine; to be proved by one substantial witness~ Th3        YERIOD 1I... 1607.1689....SETTLEMEi -
constable in eachtown to make presentment of such transgressions to the particular court, and upon conviction, the fine to
be paid without gainsaying."
In the colony of New-York, during this period, the
manners of the colonists were strictly Dutch-with no other
mnodifications than the privations of a new country, and
the few English among thlem, neccessarily effected.
Thie same steadfast pursuIit of wealth; the same plodding industry; the same dress, air, and physiognomny, which are given
as characteristlc of Holland, were equally characteristic of the
inhabitants of New-Amsterdam.
In Vi'ginia, the ma'ners of the colonists were those
of the less rigid Englishl, rendered still more free and voluptuous by thle influence of a softer climate and a mnore
prlolific soil..dtith says of the'first settlers of this colony, that some emigrated "c to escape a worse fate at home;~ others, it is said,
1sought to repair fortunes by emigration, whlich had'been ruined
lby excess. Many perisons, however, of high character, were
among the emigrants, aInd amidst the licentiotsness of the Vir,
ginia' colony'were found, at the close of this period, the seeds
of that frankness, hospitality, taste, and refinement, which distinguish the people of the South.at this day.
Other national peculiarities might be noticed, as those of the
Fins in l)elaware, those of the Quakers in Pennsylvania, &amp;c.
but at this period they were too limited to require a distinct
notice in our work.
XXXIX. X,t 1Rgfti   The colony of Virginia, from
its earliest existence, was exclusively devoted to the
Church of Enoland.
For several veal:s, its unsetled state prevented that attention
to a religions establishment, which afterwards the subject reeeived. At the expiration of thirteein years from the founding
of the colony, there were but eleven pa.rishes, and five mninistels; the inhabitants of the colony did not at this tiune, however, much exceed two thousand persons.
lit 1621, the colony received a large accession to its numbers, and the governour and council were instructed "to take
into special regard the service of Aimighty God, and the ob
servance of his divine laws; and that the people should be
traine.d up in true religion and virtue." At the same time, the
Virginia Company ordered a hundred acres of land, in each of
the boroinghs. to be laid off for a glebe, and twvo hundred pounds
trn  to be raised, as a standing' and certain revenue out of           i.....10i..607....1689...SETTLEME  TS
Lhe profits c' each parish, to make a living: this stipend wag
thus settled-that the minister shall receive yearly five hundred pounds of tobacco, and sixteen barrels of corn; which
were collectively estimated at two hundred pounds sterling
In 1642, the assembly passed a law prohibiting all, but those
who had been ordained by English bishops, from, preaching.
In 1650, during the time of governour Berkley, the parishes
of the colony were furthler regulated tile religion of the chlurch
of England wvas confirmed and established, and provision made
for the support of the ministers. The maintenance of a minister was put at sixteen thousand pound~ of tobacco, which, ay
valued at that time, at ten shilings per hundred, was about
eighty pounds sterling.  But in addition to to this, he had a
dwelling house and glebe; also four hundred pounds of tobacco,
or forty shillings for a funeral sermon, and two hundred pounds
of tobacco, or twenty shillings for performing marriage by lid
cense, or five shillin,s when the banus were proclaimed. The
tobacco destined Ifor the minister was brought to him,'weL
packed in hogsheads, prepared for shipping'. To raise this crotwelve negroes were necessary.
The special object of the New-England planters, iID
settling the cotntty, was the enjoyment of tiheir religious
opinions, anid ihe free exercise of religious worshir, with~
out molestation.  Early attention was, therefore, paid
to the gathesring of dhurches, and the regulation of religion.. They were Calvinists in doctrine, and congregational in discipline.
Eacli church maintained its right to govefn itself.  They
held to the validity of Presbyterian ordinationi and the expediency of synods on great occasions. From the commencemient, they used ecclesiastical councils, convToked by particular
churches for advice, but not for the judicial determination of
controversies.
In each of the churchles there was a pastor, teacher, rulinelder, and deacons. The pastor's oflf:e consisted. principally
in exhortation; upon the teacher devolved the business of explaining and defending the doctrines of' christianity. The business of the ruling elder was to assist the pastor in the govern
mient of the church.
Early provision was made for the sup?ort of the ministry
On the arrival of the colonists of Massachusetts Bay -at Charlestown, before landing. a court of assistants was held, a  n' the
first question proposed was, How shlall the ministers be maintained? The court ordered that hlouses be built and salaries
be raised for them at the ni;h ib. r:'~;:   T -} i'  -inisir. Phillips, and Air. Wilson, were granted a salary-The
former thirty pounds per annum, and the latter twenty poutnds;
until the arrival of his wife.
After the settlemetrt of the several colonies, all persons were
obliged by law to contribute to the support of the church. Special care was taken that all persons should attend public worv
ship. In Connecticut the law obliged them to be present OL
the Lord's day-on all days of public fasting, and thanksgiving
appointed by civil authority, on penalty of five shillings, fo.
every instance of neglect.
By the year 1642, tweny-ty wo years fom  the landinu of then
pilgrims at Plymouth, there had been settled in ivew-Englandseventy-seven ministers, who were driven from the parenm
country, fifty towns and villages had been planted, and thirty
or forty churches gathered.
In 1637, the first synod convened in America, sat at Tewtown, Massachusetts, a-nd wvas composed of all the teachinrg el-,Jrs in the country, and mnesseners of the several churches,

iron, &amp;c. They were at length Ibanished on pain of death, and
four, refusing to go, were executed in 1659.. Without intending to justify these severities towards the
Baptists, Quakers, and other sectaries, it is still proper to state,
as some apology for them, that the conduct of the leaders of
these sects was often calculated, and no doubt designed, to
provoke persecution. They sought improper occasions to in.
culcate their peculiar tenets-departed unnecessarily from the
decencies of social intercourse, and rudely inveighed against
established and cherished opinions. In this way the peace of
the colonies was disturbed, and that unanimity of religious sentiment which had hitherto existed, was broken.  Our forefathers sought to avert these evils by the arm of civil power;.
not yet having learnt that persecution is a ready way to propagate the sentiments of the persecuted.
In the year 1646, a synod met at Cambridge, which, by adjournment, protracted its session to 1648, when it dissolved.
This synod comnposed and adopted the" Cambridge Platform,'
and recommended it, together with the Westminster Confession
of'Faith, to the General Court and to the churches. In this
synod were present the ministers and churches of Connecticut,
and New-Haven, who united in the forin of discipline which it
recommended. This, in connexion with the ecclesiastical
laws, was the religious constitution of Connecticut, until the
compilation of the Saybroolik Platforsn, a period of about sixty
years.
XL.    CM'4      J16 (I0!Mrt g;g     The colonies, during this period, had little other trade than with England,
thiiough the West-India trade had begun, and there. was
some commerce with Canpda, and a few ports on the European continent.  The colonies imported from England
all their merchandise; and exported thithier tobacco, peltry, and at length some beef, pork, grain, and fish.  The
importations fiom England, however, much exceeded the
exports thither.
During the first thirty years of the colony of Virginia, their
exports were confined to tobacco. But the price of i.t fell at
length from three shillings and sixpence per pound, to tventy
shillings per hrundred, in consequence of which, a trade was
opened with the frontier Indians, and the Five Nations. The
skins of the deer, elk, and buffalo, and the furs of the otter,
hare, fox, muslh at, and beaver, were procured for rum, hatchets, blankets. &amp;c_  These skins and furs were exported to        PERIODi L....1607....1689....SETTLEMENTS.  5
england. Engli.h grain and Indian corn were also exported
to a considerable[ extent. Although the Virginians owned a
few vessels, the greater part of the trade was carried on b
English vessels, daring this period. They brought to the colo.
ny English manufactures, and took tobacco, furs, skins, g'rain,
tar, pitch &amp;c. in return. The Virginians also carried on some
trade with Canadi.
The principal article of export from New-England, during
this period, was peltry, which was procured of the Indians for
goods of small value. In 1639. a fishing trade was begun at
Cape Anne, and in 1641, three hundred thousand Codfish wero
sent to market.
The first vess.l directly from the West Indies was a Dutch
ship of 160 tons, which arrived at Marblehead, 1635. The
first American vessel that went to the West Indies was a pinnace of thirty tons, in 1636. The ship Desire of Salem made a
voyage in 1638 to New-Providence and Tortuga, and returned
laden with cotton, tobacco, salt, and negroes.  This was the
first introduction of African slaves illto New-England.  The
first importation of indigo, and sugar, from the West Indies
mentioned in our accounts, was made in 1639.  In 1642, a
Dutch ship exchanged a cargo of salt for plank and pipe staves,
the exports of lumber from New-England. The next year,
eleven ships sailed for the West Indies with lumber.
In 1678, thne annual exports of the New-York colony, be.
sidesbeef, pork, tobacco, and peltry, were about sixty thousand
bushels of wheaLt. Abbut ten or fifteen vessels on an average
of one hundred tons, English and Colonial, traded to this colony in a year.
XLI.     t'grftl;tttU.  Early attention was paid to
agriculture.  The. first business of the settlers was to clear
the forests and supply themselves with food from the
soil.  But the fertility of the earth taught them  soon to
look to agriculture as a source of wealth, as well as subsistence.  It therefore became the leading object of industry in the colonies.
The method adopted by the first settlers to clear the land
was very slow and laborious, compared with the present modes.
They used generally to cut down the trees and dig up the stumps
before tillage.
Tobacco was early cultivated in Virginia, and soon began to
-be exported. The year after the colony landed, the people
gathered corn of their own planting, the seed of which they
received of the Indians. Vineyards were attempted, and ex.3rienced tine-dressers were sent over for the purpose of takGENERAL DIVISION.
THE History of the United States of America may be
divided into Eleven Periods, each distinguished by some
striking characteristic, or remarkable circumstance.
The J,ir, t trJtiov will extend from the Discovery
of Amezrica, by Columbus, 1492, to the first permanent
English settlement in America, at Jamestowni, Virginia,
2607, and is distinguishied for DIscovERIEs.
Obs. Previous to the discovery of America in 1492, the inhabitants of Europe, Asia, and Africa, were of course ignorant
of its existence. But soon after this event, several expeditions.
were fitted out, anrd camne to make discoveries, in what was
then called the " New World."77 Accordingly, between 1492
and 1607, the principal countries lying along the eastern coast
of North America, were discovered, and more or less explored.
As our history, during this period, embraces little more than
accounts of these expeditions, we characterize it as remarkable
for discoveries.
The Ar~0nv ior!:tf       will extend from the Settle
vment of Jamestown, 16o'7. to the accession of William
and Mary to the throne oi England, 1689, and is distinguished for SETTLEMENTS.
Obs., During this period, our history is principally occupied
in detailing the various settlements, whtich were either effected
or attempted, within the boundaries of the United States. It includes indeed, wars with the natives-disputes between proprietors of lands, and colonies-the formation of governments,
&amp;c. &amp;c.; but these are circumstances which pertain to, and
bformn a part of, the settlement of new countries. As this period embraces the settlemient of most of the original States in
the Union, viz. Massachusetts, including Maine, Connecticut,
Rhode-Island, New-Hampshire, New-York, New-Jersey

for settlements.

ing care of them. Flax, hemp, barley, &amp;c. were cultivated toa considerable extent. Rye was first raised imi Massachusetts,
in 1633. Ploughs were early introduced into' the country.
The first neat cattle, ever brought into New-England, were
introduced by Mr. Winslow, in 1624. In 1629, one hundred;
and forty head of cattle, some horses, sheep, and goats, were
brought to Massachusetts Bay.  In a few years they became
so numerous as to supply all the wants of the inhabitants- In
1623, the cattle in Virginia had increased to above one thousand head.  
New-York raised considerable beef and pork for ey.portation, and in 1678,. they exported sixty thousand bushels of
wheat.
XLII. 3rtti     altl b M    ma     tu#      The colonists, during this period, being chiefly occupied in gaining
a subsistence and in protecting thlemselves against their
enemies, had occasion for few articles beyond the necessaries and comforts of life. Arts and manufactures could,
therefore, receive but little encouragement, beyond the
construction of such articles and even those were princ.
pally imported.
In 1620, one hundred and fifty persons came from England
to Virginia to carry on the manufacture of silks, iron, potash,
tar, pitch, glass, salt, &amp;c. but they did not succeed. In 1673,
Chalmner says of New-England, "'There be five iron works
which cast no guns-no house in New-England has above
twenty rooms-not twenty in Boston have ten rooms each-a
dancing school was set up here, but put down-a fencing
school is allowed. There be no musicians by trade. All cordag'e, sail-cloth, and mats, come from England-no cloth made
there worth four shillings per yard-no alum, no copperas, no
salt, made by their sun.'
The filst buildings of the settlers were made of logs and.
thatched, or were built of stone. Brick and framed houses
were soon built in the larger towns, and afterwards in the villages. The frames and brick were, however, in some instances, imported. The first mill in New-England was a windmill, near Watertown, but it was taken down in 1632, and
placed in the vicinity of Boston. Water-mills began to be
erected the next year.
The first attempt to build water-craft, in New-England, was
at Plymouth, in 1626. A house carpenter sawed their largest
boat into two parts, and lengthened it five or six feet, built
a deck, and rigged it into a convenient vessel, which did ser,         PERIOI) I....1607....1689....SETTLEMENTS.  
vice for seven years. The first vessel, built in Massachusetts
was a bark in 1631, called The Blessing of the Bay, In 16339 a
ship of sixty tons was built at Medford. In 1636, one of one
hundred and twenty tons was built at Marblehead., In 1641,
a ship of three hundred tons was launched at Salem, and one
of one hundred and sixty tons at Boston. From this time ship
building rapidly extended in the northern colonies.
The first printin,g in New-England, was done in 1639, by
one Day.   The proprietor of the press was a clergyman, by
the name of Glover, who died on his passage to America. The
first thiing printed was the Freeman's Oath, the second an Almnanack, and the third an edition of the Psalms. No other
pIinting press was established in Amnerica during this period.
John Elliot. the celebrated missionary, having translated the
bible into the Indian language, had it printed at Cambridge in
1864.o
The mode of travelling considerable distances was on foot
or on horseback, their being no carriages for that purpose,
and the roads from one village to another being only narrow
loot-paths, through forests.
XLIII.    ~;f      [   Wenmay estimate thie population of the Englishi Anmerican Colonies at the close of
this period at about 200,000.
XLIV.o T~;U     t.01L   In New-England schools were
foiunded at the outset of the colonies for the education of
all clases: in the southern colonies, provisions for the
education of the ehig'ieer classes onl were attempted dutring this period.
Scarcely had the American colonists openedc the forests, and
constructed habitations, before they directed their attention to
the object of education..Previously to 1619, the king of England authlorized the col
lection of monies throughout the kingdom to erect a college in
Virginia, for the education of Indian children; one thousand
five hundred pormils were collected for this purpose, and Hens
aco was selected as a suitable place for a seminary. The same
year, the Virginia company granted ten thousand acres of land
for the projected university.-This donation, while it embraced
the original obje t, was intended also for the foundation of a
seminairy of learning for English scholars.
In addition to a college, the colonists, in 1621, instituted a
school at Charles' city for the benefit of all the colony, which
they caled the East India School. For the maintenance of the
ma ster and usher, rne thousand.eres of land were appropriated, with five servants and an overseer.-Prom thlis school,
pupils were to be transferred to the college at IH.enrico, when
the latter should be sufficiently endowed.  These establishfnents in Virginia, however, failed of success, and in 1692
their funds were given to Williamn and Mary's college, which
we shall notice hereafter.
Still more attentive to education were the northern colonies.
In 1630 a general court of Massachhusetts Bay appropriated the
sum of four hundred pounds towards the commencement of a
college.  In 1637 the collegre wvas located at Newtown, whl-ich,
not long after, was called Canmbridge, in mem ory of Cambridge
in England, where many of the colonists had received their
education. Mr. John llarvard, a worthy minister, dying at
Charlestown about this time, bequeatihed nearly eight hundrecd
pounds to the college, in consideration of which legacy, it was
called after him.  In 642 was held the first commencement,
at which nine were g rad"uavted.
To this institution, the plantations of Conmnecticut and NewHaven, so long as they remained unable to support a sirLilar
one at home, contrilbuted farads fi om the public purse; and
sent to it suchi of their youth as they wished to be educated.
Private subscriptions were also made from the united colonies,
to aid the institution.
Great attention was also paid by all the norhern colonies to
the subject of common scl-00ols. As a specimeni of the arrangemnents common to the New-England colonies, we may notice
those of ConnIecticut. By her first code in 16o9, onl sin
years from the time the first house was erectede within; the co
lonwy, it was ordered that everv'townv, consiAsti-g of fifty fami-.
lies, should lmaintailn a good sCIIhool in which s eacing ar wv iting should be well taug-hi, andu tiat in evers county town, a
good grammnar schlool should be instituted. Large tracts o`
land were appropriiated by tne lepislautLre as a perimirent sup
port of these schools, and thle selectnen of every town were re*
quired to see that all heads of fanmilses instructed their children
and servants to read the English tongue well.
XLV. At the commencement of this period, our history preo
sentee us withl a continent, over whose surface an interlnina.
ble wilderness lihad for ages cast its deepf) and solemn shade. f
we approach the shore, and look througl the gloom that gat.lers over it, tne scenes wlich strike the eye are Indians attheir war dance, or perhaps flames curling round some expir.
ing captive, or wild beasts mangling their prey.  
Passing fi'om this point of time to the close of our period, a
space of eighty-two years, the prospect is greatly chlanged. We
sotv see smiling fields and[ cheerful villages in ihe piace of disrial forests; instead of beasts of prey,- we see grazing herds;
knstead of the kindling fagot, we witnest- the worship of Jes-us
fhrist; and instead of the appalling war-whoop, we listen to
~he grateful songs of David. In the beautiful words of scrip{ure, the wilderness has be-gan to blossom as the rose, and the
desert is becoming vocal wiithll the praises of God.
But how is it that a change so wornderful has been brouglht
o pass? WVe have indeed seen the hardy spirit of enterprise
leaving the luxuries of Europe, and plunging into the forests
of America. But we have also seen our forefathers struggling
with difficulties, and often trembling on the very brink of ruin~
We have seen themn amidst Indian war, desolating famine, and
pestilence; and we have wondered, after the stormn has passed,
to see them rise withl- renovated strength, and seem to gather
power and advantage from circumn-xaces calculated to over
whelmn them.
Admitting thien, the extaordinary energy, wvisdom, enterprise, and hardihood of the first settlers of Amelica, still ve are
driven to the admission of a benign providence workiing in their
favour, and mysteriously establishi'ng their strength and security, by exercising them for years with danger, trial ancl
misfortune.
Nor are these the onlly considerations which excite our admiration, in regarid to the first settlers of North America. Although, in the eloquentt wvords of Mr. Walsh, " It was their peculiar lot, at one and the same time, to clear and cultivate a
wilderness; to erect habitations and procure sustenianice; to
struggle with a new and rigorous climate; to bear up againist
all the bitter recollections inseparable from distant and lonely
exile; to defend their liberties from the jealous tyrasnly and
bigotry of the mother country; to be perpetually assailed by a
savage foe, the most subtle and the most formidable of any
people on the face of the ea-ih:"-still they looked forward to
the welfare of future genaerations-laid broad and deep foundations for religious intitutions-made thei- most careful p-ovisioris for learning, and enacted wholesome laws, the benefit of
which is distinctly felt to this day.
In outr introduction, we have remarked that history shows
the influence of the manners of a people upon their government, and the reciprocal influence of government upon. the
umnners of a people. Thie history of this period, furnishes

DISTINGUISHED FOR THE WARS OF KING WILLIAM
QUEEN ANNE~ AND GEORGE II.
tVilliam..qnne.
George I.
Extending from the accession of William and Mary to
the throne of England, 1689, to the Declaration of
the WVar by England against France, 1756, called
" the French and Indian War."
Section 1. Tile news of William's accession to thle
Jhrone of England, filled the colonies with ecstasy. Under the sudden impulse of their feelings, the inhabitants
of Boston seized Sir Edmund Andross, withl about fifty
of his associates, and put them in close confinement,
where thley lay, until ordered to England, to answer for
maleadministration. Connecticut and Rhode-Island immediately resumed their charters, and were permitted by
his majesty to re-establish their former governments.
Massachusetts soon after obtained a new charter, in some
respects less favourable, to tile colony, but in others, more
so, than its former one.Andross had formerly been governour of New-York,
under the duke of York,: in which province his administration had been distinguished for measures both arbitrary
and severe.  Subsequent governours, under the duke, andi
after he came to the throne, had generally pursued a
similar course.  The discontents of the people had been
gradually increasing, and they were ready for revolution,
when the above intelligence of the proceedings at Boston
arrived.  A revolution soon commienced, and, although
attended by unhappy events, issued in the restoration of
the rights of the people,, and the formnation of a consititution which laid.the foundation of their provincial code.
From the reduction of New-York, in 1664, to 1683, the people had no share inr the gove rnnent. nh 1681, the council
court of assizes, and corporation, had s1olicited the duke o
York to permit the people to choose their own rulers. Ac`
cordingly, the next year, Thomas Dongan, a papist, was ap
pointed governour, with instructions to call an assembly, to
consi-st of a council of ten, and of eighteen representatives,
elected by the freeholders.
On the accession of the duklie of York to the throne, under
the title of James II. he refused to confirm to the people the
privileges granted them when he was duke. No assembly
was permitted to be.convened; printing presses were prohibited, and the more important provincial offices were conferred
on papists.'              -  
Suich was the state of things, when intelligence of the seizure
of Andross arrived. This gave a spriing to the general dissatisfaction, which burst forlth into open resistance to the exist~ingr administration.
One Jacob Leisler, with several others, immediately took
possession of the fort. Governo-tr Dongan had just embarked
for England, leaving the administration of the government,
during his absence, to Charles Nicholson, at that time hi,
deputy. Nicholson and his officers made what opposition t
Leisler they were able, but he having been joined ~y six mili
tia captains, and'four hundred and seventy men, Nicholso
absconded.'Upon this, Leisler assumed the supreme command
This assumption of Leisler was far from being, pleasant t
the council and magistrates, at the head of whom were Col
Bayard and the mayor. Finding it impossible, hiowever, to
succeed against Leisler in New-York, they retired to Albalny
and there employed their influence to foment opposition

their respective garrisons in the name of William and Mary,
but neither would submit to the authority of the other.
In this state of things, a letter from the Lords Carmathen
and Halifax, arrived, directed "To Francis iNicholson, Esq.
or in his absence, to such as, for the time being, take care for
preserving the peace and administering the laws," &amp;c. Accompanying this letter, was another of a subsequent date, vestngo Nicholson with the chief command.
As Nicholson had absconded, Leisler construed the letter as
directed to himself, and from that time assumed the title and
authority of lieutenant governour. The southern part of NewYork generally submitted to him; but Albany refusing subjection, Milborn, his son-in-law, was serit to reduce them. In
his first attempt he failed; but during the ensuing spring,
1690, he took possession of the fort, and the inhabitants sub.
mitted.
On the 19th of March, 1691, Col. Slaughter arrived at
New-York, in the capacity of the king's governour. Nicholson and Bayard, who had been imprisoned by Leisler, were
released. The latter was obliged to abandon the fort, and
with Milborn, his son-in-law, was apprehended, tried for high
treason, and condemned. Their immediate execution was
urged by the people; but the governour, fearful of consequences, chose to defer it. To effect their purpose, an invitation
was given him by the citizens to a sumptuous feast, and while
his reason was drowned in intoxication, a warrant for thei-r
execution was presented to him and signed. Before he recovrted his senses, the prisoners were no more.
Measures so violent greatly agitated the existing parties.
but in the end, the revolution which had taken place restored
the rights of Englishmen to the colony. Governour Slaughter
convoked an assembly, who formed a constitution. This contitution, among other provisions, secured trials by jury, freedom from taxation, except by the consent of the assembly,
and toleration to all denominations of Christians, excepting
Roman Catholicks.
II. While these troubles were distressing the colonies
of the,north, that of Carolina in the south, was far from
being in a state of tranquillity.  Dissensions early arose
in that colony respecting the proprietary government under which they still continued.  On the one hand a parof the people insisted upon implicit obedience to all the
laws and regulations of the proprietors in England: while
another part contended on the other hand, that no such
6*obedience was due.   Both parties being ardent and de.
termined, the conflict between them  was violent, and
greatly prolonged, to the seriouls injury of the colony.
In addition to these dissensions, others arose betweev
the English settlers, and a colony of French Protestants,
who had planted themselves in the county of Craven; tG
whom   the English denied nearly every civil privilege,
and especially the right of represenitation in the assembly
In view of these accuLniulating troubles, John Archdale,
one cf the proprietors, was sent to America in 1695, withl
full powers to redress' grievances, atnd if possible to adjust existing dif.erences.
Archdale was received with cordiality, and by his singuLlar wisdom and address, was so happy as to accomplis'n
the purposes of his mission, except that he was unable fully to secure the rights and liberties of the Frenchi refugees. Not long afler, however, the prejudices of the
Englishl against themt abated, acnd they became incorporated with the freemen of the colony.
II!. About tis period, 1692 commencedc in Danvers,
then a part of Satlein, Massachusetts, a singular infatuation
on the supposed prevalence of witchcraft. In a short
tim-e, this infittuation pervaded several parts of Tew-England, producing, in its progress, the greatest distress in
private familie;S and disorder and tumult thtiroughout the
country.
The first suspicion of witchcraft in New-England, and in
the United St-ates, began at Springlfield, Massachusetts, as
earyi as 1,645. Several mr,raons, about that timte, were accused, tried, and executed'in Massachusetts  one at Charlestown, one at Dorchester. one at Cambridge, and one at Boston.
For almost thirty years aftervwards the subject rested. But in
1687 or 1688, it was revived inJBoston; four of the children
of John Goodwin uniting in accusing a poore Irish womrnan
with bewitching- them. Unhappily the accusation was regar:ted with attention, and the womani was tried and executed.
N-eai' th'. close of February, 1692, the -subject was again
revived, in consequence of several children in Darnvers, Salem, beginning to act in a peculiar and unaccountable manner.
Their straDge conduct conItinlilng for several days, their
friends betuok themselves to fasting and prayer.  During      THREE WVARIS OF WM. II....ANNE....GEO. IL   67
religiouLs exercises it was found that the children were generally decent and still; but after service was ended, they renewed their former inexplicable conduct. This was deemed;
sufficient evidence that they were labouring under the`influence of witchcraft.
At the expiration of some days, the children began to accuse
several persons in the neighbourhood of bewitching them.
Unfortunately they were credited, and the suspected authors
of the spell were seized and imprisoned.
From this date, the awful mania rapidly spread into the
neighbouring country, and soon appeared in various parts of
Essex, Middlesex, and Suffbollk. Persons at Andover, Ipswich,
Gloucester, Boston, and several other places, were accused
by their neighbours and otl-hers.
For sorrme timne, tihe victims were selected only from the
)ower classes. But at le.ngth the accusationrs fell upon persons
of the nmost respectable rank. In Auoust, Mr. GeOrge Boroughs, some timie minister in Salem, was accused, brought to
trial, and condemned. Accusations were also b:rught against
Mr. English, a respectable merchant in Salem, and his wife;against Messrs. Didley and John Bradstreet, sons of the then
late governour Bracdstreet; ag ainst the wvife of Mvr. JIale, and
the lady of Sir V iliam Phipps.
The evil had nowv become awfully alarming. One man,
named Giles Corey, had been pressed to death for refusing to
put himself on trial by jury; and nineteen persons had been
executed, more than one-third of whom were members of the
church. One hlnIdred andfifty were in prison, and two hundred were accused.
At lenrgth the: inquiry wvas anxiously suggested, where will
this accunmuLlating nmischiief and miserv end? A conviction began to spread thlat tiue proceedings had been rash and indefensible. A special court was held on the subject, and fifty who
were brdught to trial, were acquitted, excepting three, who
were afterwards reprieved bv the governour. These events
were followed by a general release of those who had been'unprisoned. i Thus the cloud," says the late President Dwight,: Which had so long hunf over thie colony, slowly and sullenly
retired; and like the darkness of Egypt, was, to the great joy
of thte distressed inhabitants, succeeded by serenity and sunshine."
WVe, wvho live to look back upon this scene, are wont to contemplate, with woinder, the seeming madness and infatuation,
not of the weak', illiterate, and unprincipled; but of menl of
sense, education, and fervent piety. Let tis con'sider, however, tha,t at this period, tIe actual existence of witch.ciaftwm,mnarkable for the three wars of KING WILLIAM  QIJExN

Obs. So long as the Colonies remained attached to the English crown, they became involved, of course, in fthe wars of the
mother country. Three times during this period, was war proclaimed between England and France, and, as the French ha4
possession of Canada, and were leagued witlh several powerful
tribes of Indians, as often did the colonies become the theatre
of their hostile operations. This period is therefore most remarkable for these three vwars~

little less than heresy. The learned Baxter, who lived at this
time in England, where the same notions on this subject preo
vailed; pronounced the disbeljever in witchcraft, an  obdui
Iate Sadducee;" arid Sir Matthew Hale, one of the brightest
ornaments of the English bench, repeatedly tried and condemned those as criminals, who were accused of witc'lhcraft.
It becomres the present generation to advert with gratitude
to tlieir freedom from those delusions wvhich distressed and agoitated their ancestors, rather than to bestow invectives upon
them, since they could plead in palliation of their error-thspirit of the age in which they lived.
IV. Scarcely were the colonies relieved from lthe op
pression c6  King James, before they were visited with
troubles of a nature still more distressing. rThe revolu.
tion, which-followed:the accession of William and Mary,
had indeed restored their liberties, but it involved them in
a war both with the Frenchl and Indians, wh-ich continled from  1690, to the peace of Ryswick, in 1697, commnonly called " Kintg William'sin   War."
King Jaines, on leaving England, fled to France. Louis
XIV. king of France, attemptin- to su,rt him, kindled the
flame of war between his own country and Engrland. The subjects of Louis, in Canada, of course directed their arms against
the colonies of New-England and New-York, and instirgated
the Indians to join themn ir, their hostilities.
Count Frontenac, a brave anid enterprising officer, was
now the governour of Canada. Inflamed with the resentment which had kinidled in thte bosom of his master, Louis
XIV. of France against William, for his treatnient of
James, he fitted out three expeditions, in the dead of
winter, against the American colonies-one against NewYork, a second against New-Hampshire, and a thiird
against the province of Maine. Each of these parties, in
the execution of their orders, marked their progress with
plunder, firi.;nd' deaCth.
The party destined against New-York, consisting of about
three hundred men, in February fell upon Schenectady, a village on the Mohawk. The season was cold, and the snIow so
deep, that it was deemed impossible for an enemy to approach.
The attack was madein the dead of the night, while the inhabtants were in a profound sleep. Not a- sentinel was awake
PERIOD     THREE WARS' OF WM. III....ANNE....GEO. I.  69
to announce the approaching danger. Care had been taken, by
a division of the enemy, to attack almost every house in the
same moment.
When the preparations were ready, on a preconcerted signal, the apalling war-whoop was begun; houses were broken
spen' and set on fire-men and women were dragged from,
their beds, and with their sleeping infants were inhumanly
murdered.'Sixty persons perished in the massacre, thirty
were made prisoners, while the rest of the inhabitants, mostly
naked, fled thronugh a deep snow, either suffering extremely,
or perishing in the cold.
The second party, directing their course to New-Hampshire; burned Salmon Falls, killing thirty of the bravest men,
and;carrying fifty-four of the inhabitants into a miserable captivity.
Tiie third party, proceeding from Quebec, destroyed tile
settIlement of Casco, in Maine, and killed and captured one
hundred people.
V. Roused by these proceedings of the French, the
colony of'Massachusetts resolved to attack the enemy in
turn. Accordingly an expedition consisting of seven vessels, and eight hundred men, under commnand of Sir William Phipps, sailed for the reduction of Port Royal, in
Nova-Scotia, which was easily and speedily effected.
A second expedition, under the same commander, was
soon after resolved upon by the colonies'of New-York,
Connecticut, and Massachusetts, united, for the reduction
of MIontreal and Quebec. A combination of unfortunate
circumstances, llowever, defeated the design, and the
expedition, after encountering numerous hardships and
disasters, returned.
The plan was for the troops of New-York and Connecticut,
consisting of about two thousand, to penetrate into Canada
by Lake Champlain, and to attack Montreal, at the sarme
time thiat the naval armament, consisting of between thirty
and forty vessels, with a similar number of men, should invest
Quebec. The troops destined for Montreal not being supplied,
either with boats or provisions, sufficient for crossing the lake,
were obliged to return. The naval expedition did not reach
Quebec, until October. After spending several days in consultation, the landing of the troops was effected, and they
began their march for the town. At the same time the ships
were drawn up; but the attack, both by land and water, wasalike unsuccessful. The troops were soon after re-embarlol,
and the weather, proving tempestuous, scattered the fleet, sd
terminated the expedition.
The success of the expedition had been so confidently calculated upon, that provision had not been made for the payment
of the troops; there was danger, therefore, of a mutiny. In
this extremity, Massachusetts issued bills of credit, as a substitute for money; the first cmission of the kind in the Amereican
colonies.                                       A   r
VI. The failure of the expedition to Quebec was
humbling to New-England, and productive of other imnhappy consequences.   The Indian   tribes, Mohawks,
Oneidas Senecas, Onondagas, and Delawares, called the
Five Nations, settled along the banks of the Susquehannabh
and in the adjacent country, who were in alliance with
Great Britain, and had long been a safeguard to the co-,
lonies against the Frenchl, became dissatisfied. They
blamed the English for their inactivity, and manifested a
disposition to make peace withl the French.
To restore the confidence of the Indian allies. Major P.
Schuyler, the next year, 1691, with three thousand men, nearly
half Mohawks and Schakook Indians, made an attack on the
lFrench settlements, north of Lake Champlain. De:Callieres,
governour of Montreal, was waiting to oppose him. After a
severe encounter, Schuyler made good his retreat, having killed thirteen officers and three hundred men.
New-York found great security against the encroachments
of the French, in the Five Nations, who now carried on a vigorous war, along the river St. Lawrence, from Montreal to
Quebec.
But the eastern portion of the countrv, particularly NewTHampshire, suffered exceedingly; the stoim falling with the
greatest severity upon themn.  Both Connecticut and Massa
chusetts raised troops for their defence; but such was the dallger and distress of the colony of New-,Hampshire, that the inhabitants were upon the point of abandoninTg the Province.
The winter of 1696 was unusually severe. Never had the
c,ountry sustained such losses in commerce, nor had provisions,
in any period of the war, been more scarce,' or borne a higher
price.
VII. In the midst of these distresses, the country was
threatened with a blow, which it seemed impossible that it
shouid sustain. The marquis Nesmond, an officer of high     TR-IIEE WVARS OF WM.o II....lANNE....GEOo XL  71/'
reputation, was despatched from France, with ten ships
of the line, a galliot, and two frigates. Count Frontenac,
from  Canada, was expected to join him at Penobscot,
with:one thousand five hundred nien. IWith this force,
they were to make a descent on Boston; to range the
coast of Newfoundland   and burn thle shipping which
should fall in their way. To finish their work'of destruetion, they were to take New-York, wvhence the troops, un
der Frontenac, were toreturn to Canada, through the country, wasting and destroying the regions through which they
should pass. But De Nesmond sailed too late for the accomplishment of his purpose. On his arrival on the coast,
not being able to join Frontenac in season the expedition failed, and the colonies were saved. At length, Dec.
10, 1697, a treaty was concluded between France and
England, at Ryswick, in Germany, by which it was
agreed, in general terms, that a mutual'rrestitution should
be made of all the countries, forts, and colonies, taken by
each party during the war.
King William's war, wvhich was thus terminated, had been
marked by atrocities on the part of the French and Indians,
until then unIknown in the history of the colonies. Infants,
when they became troublesome, were despatched by being
dashed againist a stone or tree. Or, to add to the anguish of a
mother, her babe was sometinmes lacerated with a scourge, or
nearly strangled under water, and then presented to her to
quiet. If unable soon to succeed in this, itwas too effectually
quieted by the hatchet, or left behind to become the prey, of
prowling beasts.  Some of the captives were roasted alive;
others received deep wounds in the fleshy parts of thqir bodies,
into which sticks on fire were thrust, until tormented out of
lfe, they expired.  
The details of individual sufferings, which occurred during
this war, were they faithfully recorded, would excite the sympathies of the most unfeeling bosom. One instance only caa
we relate.
In an attack by a body of Indians on Haverhill, NewHampshire, in the winter of 1097, thei concluding year of the
war, a party of the assailants, burning with savage animosity,
approached the house of a Mr. Dustan. Upon the first alarm.
h- flew from a neighbouring field to his family, with the hope of
hurrying them to a place of safety. Seven of his children h  7.2             PiERIOD II....1689....1756
directed to flee, while hlie himself went to assist his wife who
was confined to the bed with an infant, a week oldO. But be
fore she could leave her bed, the savages arrived.
In despair of.rendering her assistance, Mr. Dustan flew to
the door, mounted his horse, and determined in his own mind,
to snatch up and save the child which he loved the best. H6
followed in pursuit of his little flock, but upon coming up to
tliem, he found it impossible to make a selection. The eye ol
the parent could see no one of the number that he could aban,
don to the knife of the savage. He determined, therefore, t
mneet his fate with them; to defend and save them from theit
pursuers, or-die by their side.
A body of Indians soon camine up with him, and, from short
distances, fired upon him and his little company.  For more
than a mile he continued to retreat, placing, himself betweee
his children and the fire of the savages; and returning theil
shots with great spirit and success. At length he saw them al}
safely lodged from their bloody pursuers, in a distant house.
It is not easy to find a nobler instanice of fortitude and cou
rage, inspired by affection, than is exhibited in this instance
-Let us ever cultivate the influence of those ties of kindred
which are capable of giving so generous and elevated a direc.
tion to our actions.
As Mr. Dustan quitted his house, a party of Indians entered
it. Mrs. Dustan was in bed; but they ordered her to rise,
and, before she could completely dress helrself, obliged her and
the nurse, who had vainly endeavoured to escape with the infant, to quit the house, whichl they plundered and set on fire.
In these distressing circumstances Mrs. Dustan began her
march, with other captives, into the wilderness. The airi was
keen, and their path led alternately through snow and deep
mud; and her savage conductors deliglted rather in the infliction of torment than the alleviation of distress.
The company had proceeded but a short distance, whien an
Indian, thiinking the infant an incumbrance, took it from the
nurse's arms, and violently terminated its life. Such of the
other captives as began to be weary, and incaDable of proceeding, the Indians killed with their tomahawks. Feeble as Mrs.
Dustan was, both she and her nurse sustained, with wonderful
energy, the fatigue and misery attending a journey of one hundred and fifty miles.
On their arrival at the place of their destination, they founi
the wigwamofthe savage, who claimed them as his personal
property, to be inhabited by twelve Indians. In the ensuing
April, this family set out with their captives, for an Indian set.
toelem t t  Meore remote. The captives were informed that     tHREE VARtS OF WN1. III....ANNIE...GEO. IL   S$
On their as rival at the settlement, they must submit to be stripped, scourged, and run the gauntlet, between two files of Inaians. Thfis information carried distress to the minds of the
captive women, and led them promptly to devise some means
of escape.
Early in the morning of the 91st, Mrs. Dustan awaking her
nurse and anothler fellowV-prisoner, they despatched ten of the
twelve Indians while asleep. The othier two escaped. The
women then pursuedtheir difficult andl toilsome journey through
the wilderness, and at lenng`h airived in safety at Haverhill.
Subsequently, thiey visited Boston, and received, at the hand
of the General Coufrt, a handsome consideration for their extraordinary sufferings and conduct.
VIII. Scarcely had the colonies recovered from  the
wounds and nimpoverishmeiiet of King William's war,
which ended in 1697, before they were again involved in
the horrours of' anothier war wi-thl the French, Indians,
and Spaniards, commonly called " Queen Anne's War,"
Wvhich continued firomn 1702, to thie peace of Utrecht,
March 31st, 1713.
By the treaty of Rvswick, it was in general terms,agreed,
that France and IEngland should mutually restore to each other
all conquests made during the wvar. But the rights and pretensions of either monarch to certain places in Iudson's Bay,
&amp;c. were left to be ascertainea and determined at some future
day, by commissioners.'The evil consequenices of leaving boundaries thus unsettled
were soon perceived. Disputes arose, which, mingling with
other differences of still greater importance, led England t~
declare war against France and Spain, Bi:ay 4th, 1702.
IX. The whole weight of the war in Amnerica, unexpectedly fell on New-Enigland. The geographical position of New-York particularly exposed that colony to a
combined attack from the lakes and sea; but just before
the commencement of hostilities, a treaty of neutrality
was concluded between the Five Nations and the French
governour in Canada. The local situation of the Five
Nations, bordering on the frontiers of New-York, prevented the French from molesting that colony; Massachusetts
and New-Hampshire were thus left t@ bear the chief ea,
lumities of the war.
The declaration of war was imnmediately followed by
7ineursions of French and Indians from Canada into the,
colonies, who seized every opportunity for annoying the
inhabitants by depredation and outrage.
On Tuesday, Feb. 29th, 1704, at day break, a party of
Frenchl and Indians, three hundred in number, under command
of the infamous Hextel De Rouville, fell upon Deerfield, Mass.
Unhappily, not only the inhabitants, but even the watch were
asleep. They soon made themselves masters of the house in
which the.garrison was kept.  Proceeding thence to the
house of Mr. Williams, the clergyman, they forced the doors,
and entered the roonm where he was sleeping.
Awaked by the noise, Mr. Williams seized his pistol, and
snapped it at the Indianl who first approached, but it missea
fire. Mr. Williams was now seized, disarmed, bound, an(d
kept standing, without his,clothes, in the intense cold, nearly
an hour.
His house was next plundered, and two of his children, together with a black female servant, were butchered before
his eyes. The savages at length suffered his wife and five chil.
dren to put on their clothes, after which he was himself allowed
to dress, and prepare for a long and melancholy march.
The whole town around themn was now on fire.  Every
house, but the one next to Mr. Williams', was consumed. This
house is still standing; a hole cut by the savages in the door,
and the markls of the bullets in the walls, are visible to this
day.
Having completed their work of destruction, in burning the
town, and killing forty-seven persons, the enemy hastily retreated, taking with them one hundred of the inhabitants,
among whom were Mr. Williams and his family.
The first night after their departure from Deerfield, the savages murdered Mr. Williams' servant, and on, the day sueceeding, finding Mrs. Williams unable to keep pace wvith the
rest, plunged a hatchet into her head. She had recentlyborne
an infant, and was not yet recovered. But her husband was
not permitted to assist her. He himself was lame, bound, insulted, threatened and nearly famished-but what were personal sufferings like these, and even greater than these, to the
sight of a wife, under circumstances so tender, inhumanly
butchered before his eyes! Before the journey was ended, seventeen others sharAd the melancholy fate of Mrs. Williams. -
On their arrival in Canada, it may be added, MIr. Williams
was treated with civility by the French. At the end of two
years lie was redeemed with fifty-seven others, and returned to
74      THREE WARS OF WM. III.ANNE....GEO. 1U.'5
Deerfield, where, after twelve years' labour in the gospel, he
entered into his rest.
X. In the spring of 1707, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island, and New-Hampshire, fitted out an expedition against
Port Royal, in Nova Scotia. The expedition, consisting
of one thousand men, sailed from Nantucket in twentythree transports, under convoy of the Deptford man of
war, and the Province galley. After a short voyage, they
arrived at Port Royal; but March, the commander of the
expedition, though a brave man, being unfit to lead in an
enterprise so difficult, little was done, beyond burning a
few houses, and killing a few cattle.
While this unfortunate expedition was on foot, the frontiers
were kept in constantalarm. Oyster River, Exeter, Kingston,
and Dover, in New-Hampshire, Berwick, York, Wells, and
Casco, in Maine, were attacked, and considerbly damaged by
the enemy.
XI. The colonies were now resolved on another attempt upon Canada. In 1708, Massachusetts petitioned
Queen Anne for assistance, and she promised to send five
regiments of regular troops. These, with twelve hundred
men raised in Massachusetts and Rhode-Island, were to
sail from Boston to Quebec.
A second division of one thousand eight hundred men.,
from colonies south of Rhode-Island, were to march
against Montreal, by way of Champlain; but this project,
also failed, the land troops returning, after penetrating to
Wood Creek, in consequence of learnitng that the naval
armament, promised from England, had beenti directed to
Portugal.
XII. The patience of the colonies was not yet exhausted. Another application was made to the Queen and
in July, 1710, Col. Nicholson came over with five frigates
and a bomb ketch, for the purpose of reducing Port Roy.
al. In this expedition, he was joined by five reglments
of troops from New-England.
The armament, consisting of the above frigates, and
between twenty and thirty transports, belonging to the
colonies, sailed from Boston, Septembe.r 18th. On the     (ttg~ JPERIOD III.... 169.... 17G.
24th, it reacned Port Royal, which surrendered October
5th, and in honour of Queen Anne, was called AnnapoQlis.
Animated with his success, Nicholson soon after sailed for
England, to solicit another expedition against Canada. Contrary to the expectations of the colonies, the ministry acceded
to the proposal, and orders were issued to the northern colonies to get ready their quotas of men.
Sixteen days after these orders arrived, a fleet of men of war
and transports, under command of Sir Hovenden Walker, with
seven regiments of the duke of Marlborough's troops, and a
battalion of marines, under Brigadier Gen. Hill, sailed into
Boston. But the fleet had neither provisions nor pilots. Aided,
however, by the prompt and active exertions of the colonies,
on the 30th of July, the fleet, consisting of fifteen men of war,
forty transports, and six store ships, with nearly seven thousand men, sailed from Boston for Canada.
Shortly after the departure of the fleet, general Nicholson
proceeded from Albany towards Canada, at the head of four
thousand men, from the colonies of Connecticut, New-York,
and New-Jersey.
The fleet arrived in the St. Lawrence, Aug. 14th. In pro
ceeding up the river, through the unskilfulness of the pilots.
and by contrary winds. it was in imminent danger of entirdestruction. On the ~22d, about midnight, the seamen disco
vered that they were driven on the north shore, among islands
and rocks. Eight or ninle of the Britishl transports, on board
of which were about one thousand seven huridred officers and
soldiers, were cast away, and nearly one thousand men were
lost. Upon this disaster, no further attempts were made to
prosecute the expedition. The fleet sailed, directly for Elgland, and the provincial troops returned home. Gen. Nicholson, who had advanced to Lake George, hearing of the miscarriage of the expedition on the St. LaWvrence, returned with
the land forces, and abanrdoned the enterprise.
The failure of this expedition was unjustly imputed, by the
mother country, wholly to New-England; nor did the colonies
receive any credit for their vi-orous eexertions in raising men
and fitting out the fleet. The expedition was not, however,
without a beneficial effect, as it probably prevented Annapolis
from failling into the hands of the enermy.
XIII. The spring of 171.2 opened with new depredatiors of the enemy uLpont the frontier settlements. Oyster River, Exeter, York, Wells, &amp;c. were again attacked       THREE WARS OF WM. III....ANNE....GEO. IL  77'
and plundered. Many inhabitants in different parts of
the country were murdered, although, in some portions
of the colonies, one half of the militia were constantly on
duty.
XIV. The northern colonies were not alone in the
distresses of Queen Anne's war. Carolina, then the
southern frontier of the American colonies, had her full
share in its expenses and sufferings.
Before official intelligence had been received of the
declaration of war by England against France and Spain,
in t702, although war had actually been declared, Gov.
M )ore, of the southern settlements in Carolina, proposed
to the assembly of the colony an expedition against the
Sp nish settlement of St. Augustine, Florida.
Although assured of its easy conquest, and of being
an,ply rewarded by its treasures of gold and silver, num
bers of the more considerate in the assembly were opposed to the expedition. A majority, however, being in fayour of it, two thousand p)ounds were voted and one
thousand two hundred m-en were raised, of whom one halt
were Indians-but the expedition entirely failed.
With the forces above named, and somne merchant vessels,
impressed as transports, Gov. Moore sailed for St. Augustine.
The design was for Col. Daniel, an enterprising officer, to proceed by the inland passage, and to attack the town by land,
with a party of militia and Indians; while Moore was to proceed by sea, and take possession of the harbour. Daniel advanced against the town, entered and plundered it, before the
governour's arrival. The Spaniards, however, retired to the
castle, with their principal riches, and with provisions for four
months.
The governour, on his arrival, cotld effect nothing for want
of artillery. In this emnergency, Daniel was despatched to
Jamaica for cannon, mnortars, &amp;e. During his absence, two
large Spanish ships appearing off tihe harbour, Gov. Moore
hastily raised the siege, abandoned his shipping, and made a
precipitate retreat into Carolina. Col. Daniel, having no intelligence that the siege had been raised, on his return, stood
in for the harbour, and narrowly escaped the ships of the enemy. In consequence of this rash and unfortunate enterprise,
the colony was loaded with a debt of six thousand pouncd

which gave rise to the first paper currency in Carolina, andm]
was the means of filling the colony with dissension and tumult.
XV. The failure of this expedition was soon after, in a
measure, compensated by a successful war with the Apa
lachian Indians, i, ho, in consequence of their connexion
with the Spaniaros became insolent and hostile. Gov.
Moore, with a body of white m3en and Indian allies,
marched into the heart of their country, and compelled
them to submit to the English.
All the towns of the,tribes between the rivers Altamaha
and Savannah were burnt, and betwveen six hundred and eight
hundred Indians were miade prisoners.
XVI Althlough this enterprise was successful, new
dangers soon threatened the colony. Its invasion was
Attempted, 1707, by the French and Spaniards, in order
to annex Carolina to Florida. The expedition, headed
by Le Feboure, consisted of a French frigate, and four
armed sloops, having about eight hundred men on board.
Owing to the prompt and vigorous measures of Johnson,
who had superseded Moore as governour, the enemy were
repulsed, and the threatened calamity averted.,No sooner was the intended invasion rumoured abroad, than
preparations were commenced to repel the enemy. The militia were mnustered and trained, and the fortifications of Charleston and other places repaired.  These preparations were
scarcely completed, before the fleet of the enemy appeared.
Some time elapsed, however, hbefore they crossed the bar,
whiceh enabled tl-he governour to alarIm the surrounding country, and to call in great numbers of th-e militia.
At lengthli, with a fair wind, the enemy passed the bar, and
sent a summons to the governour to surrender. Four hours
were allowed him to return his answver.'But the governour informed the messenger that he did not wish one minute. On
the reception of this answer, the enemy seenied to hesitate,
and attempted nothing that day.
The day succeeding, a party of the enenmy, landing on
James Island, burnt a village by the river's side. Another
party of one hundred and sixty landed at Wando Neck. The
next day both these parties were dislodged-the latter party
being surprised, and nearly all killed or taken prisoners.
This success so animated the Carolinians, that it was determined to attack the etnemy by sea. This was attempted with
a force of six vessels under command of William Rhet; but mn     THREE WARS OF WM. IIl....ANNE....GE0.lI.       7[5
his appearance, the enemy weighed anchor, and precipitately
fled.
Some days succeeding this,. Monsieur Arbuset appeared on
the coast with a ship of force, and landed a number of men at
Sewee Bay. Rhet sailed out against him, and at the same
timre Capt. Fenwick crossed the river, and marched to attack
the enemy by land. After a brisk engagement, F'enwick took
thle enemy on land, prisoners, and thet succeeded in capturing the ship.
YXVIif In 1710, a large number of Palatines, inhabitants of a Palatinate a smnall territory in Germanay, whose
governour or prince is called a Palatine, arrived and settled on the Roanoke, in Albemarle and Bath counties,
within the boundaries of North Carolina.  These were a
great accession to thle strength and nunsbers of the colony, which, although of sixty years stanrding, was exceedingly sm all.
The same year, near thlree thousand of the same people
came to New-York. Somne settled in that city, and built the
old Lutheran church; others settled on Living(rston's manor.
Some went into Penansylvania, and at subsequent periods were
followed by many thousands of their countrymen.
Two years after the above settlers arrived in Carolina,
and during Queen Anne's war, a plot was laid by the
Corees and Tuscaroras, with other Indians tribes ton massacte he whole nunsber. This plot was so far put in
-execution., that one hundred and seven settlers were
butchered in their hou:es3 iin a sugle nighlt. Information
of their distresswas speedily sent to Charleston; soon
after which, Col. Barnwvell, with six hundred militia and
three hundred and fitty frie'ndly Indians, explored their
way through the intervening -vwilderness, and came to their
relief. On his arrival, Col. B. surprised the Tuscaroras
killed three hundred of themn  and made one hundred
prisoners.
The surviving Indmans fled to a town which had been forti
fled by the tribe; but here they were again attacked by Barn
well, who killed great numbers of them, and compelled the
remainder to sue for peace. It is estimated that the Tuscaroras, in' this war, lost one thousand of their number. The
remainrder of the tribe, early after the wvar, abandoned thecountry, and became united with the Five Nations, which,
since that time, have been called the Six.Nations.
XVIII, The next year, March 31st, 1713, a treaty of
peace was concluded at Utrecht, between England and
France.  This relieved the apprehensions of the northern
part of the country, and put a welcome period to an expensive and distressing war. After the peace was known
in America, the Eastern Indians sent in a flag and desired peace. The governour of Massachusetts, with his
council, and with that of New-Hampshire, met them  at
Portsmouth, received their subm-ission, and entered into
terms of pacification.
By the above treaty between England and France, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia were ceded to Great Britain. It
was also stipulated that "; the subjects of France, inhabiting
Canada, and other places, shall hereafter give no hindrance
or molestation to the Five Nations, nor to the other inations of
Indins who are friends to Great Britain." By the treaty also
the French relinquished all claim to the Five Nations, and to
all parts of their territories, and as far as respected themselves,
enrtitled the British crown to the sovereignty of the country.
XIX. The termination of Queen Anne's war gave
peace to the northern colonies, but the the contest with
the Indians for some time continued to distress the Carolinians.
Scarcely had the people recovered from the above war with
the Corees and Tuscaroras, before they-v were threatened withl
a calamity still greater and more general. The Yamosees, a
powerful tribe of Indians, with all the Indian tribes from Florida to Cape Fear river, formed a conspiracy for the total extirpation of the Carolinians. The 15th of April, 1715, was
fixed upon as the day of general destruction.-OwitiF however, to the wisdom, despatch, and firmness of Go-vernour Craven, and the blessing of Providence, the calamity was in a
measure averted, and the colonies saved, though at the expense, during the war, of near four hundred of the inhabitants.
The Yamosees were expelled the province, and took refigb
among the Spaniards in Florida.
XX. In 1719, the government'of Carolina, which till
now had been proprietary, was changed, the charter was
declared by the king's privy council to have been forfeited,
and the colony, fiomn this tinme was taken untder the roy       TIIREL WARS    TWM. II....ANNE....GLO. I.
al protection, under which it continued till the American
revolution.
The people had long been disgusted with the management of
the proprietors, and were resolved at all hazards, to execute
their own laws, and defend the rights of the province. A subscription to this effect was drawn up, and generally signed.
On a meeting of the assembly, a committee wras sent with
this subscription to the governour, Robert Johnson, requesting
him to accept the government of the province, under the king,
insgad of the proprietors.
Rpon his refusal, the asseaibly chose Col. James Moore governour, under the crown, and on the 21st of December, 1719,
the convention and militia marched to Charleston fort, and
proclaimed Moore governour in his Majesty's name.
The Carolinians, having assumed the government, in behalf
of the king, referred their complaints to the royal ear. On a
full hearing ofl the case, the privv council adjudged that the
proprietors had forfeited their charter. From this time, therefore, the colony, as stated above, was taken under the royal
protection, under which it contimned till the American revolum
hon.
This change was followed, in 1729, by another nearly as im.
portant. This was an agreemnent between the proprietors and
the crown, that the former should surrender to the crown their
right and interest both to the government and soil, for the sum
of seventeen thousand five hundred pounds sterling. This
agreemnent bein-g carried into effect, the province was divided
inrto North and South Carolina, each province having a distinct governour under the crown of Engiand.
XXI. Ithas been stated that peace was concluded by
Massachusetts and New-4 ampshire, with the eastern In
dians, soon after the pacification at Utrecht, in 1713
This peace, h1owever, was of short duration, dissatisfaction
arising on the part of the Inrdians, because of the encroachments of the English on their lands, and because
t,ading houses were not erected for the purchase of their
corn mnodities.
rThe governouir of Massachusetts promised them redress;
but the general court not carrying his stipulations into
execution, the Indians became irritated, and, at the same
time, being excited by the French Jesuits, were roused to
war, which, in July, 1722, became general, and C-ontinued to distress the eastern settlements until 17T.The tribes engaged in the war, were the Norridgewocks,
Penobscots, St. Francois, Cape Sable, and St. John Indians.
In June, 1725, hostilities ceased, soon after which a treaty was
signed by the Indians, and was afterwards ratified by commissioners fromMassachusetts. New-Ilampshire, and Nova Scotia.
This treaty was greatly applauded, and under it, owing to the
more pacifick feelings of the Indians, and the more faithful
observance of its stipulations by the English, the colonies ex
perienced unusual tranquillity for a long tirme.
XXII. The settlement 0f GEORGIA was begun in 1733,
and was named after king George-'[. of England, $ho
was then on the throne. In the settlementt of Georgia,
two objects were principally in view-tthe relief of indigent inhabitants "of Great Britain and Ireland, and the
greater security of the Carolinas.
The charter was granted to twenty-one persons, under the
title of trustees, and passed the seals June 9th, 1732. The
first settlers, one hundred and sixteen in number, embarked
from England, in Novemiber of the same year, under General
Oglethorpe.  They landed at Charleston, whence they repaired to Savansnah river, and commenced the town of that
name.
The colony did not flourish for many years. In their regulations for its management, the trustees enacted that all lands
granted by them to settlers should revert back, min case of the
failure of male succession; although certain privileges were
to be allowed to widows and daughters. At the same time all
trade with the Indians was prohibited, unless by virtue of special license. The use of negroes and the imnportation of rum
were absolutely forbidden.
Although the trustees were actuated by the purest motivesby principles of humani ty, and a regard to the health and morals of the inhabitants, thi3 system of regutlations was unfitted
to the condition of the poor settlers, and was highly injurious
to their increase and prosperity.
Emigrants, however, continued to arrive. The first adventurers being poor and unenterprising, a more active and efficient race was desirable. To induce such to settle in the colony, eleven towns were laid out in shares of fift} acies each;
one of which was offered to each new settler. Upon this, large
numbers of Swiss, Scotch, and Germans, became adventurers
to the colony. Within three years from tche first settlement,
one thousand four hundred planters had arrived.
To aid the colony, parliament made several grants of money;
individuals Aso gave considerable sums for the same purpose       THREE WARS OF WM. III....ANNE...GEO. II.   83
owing, however, to the impolitick regulations of the trustees,
the colony maintained only a feeble existence.
XXI1. Upon     the declaration of' war by England
against Spain, Oglethorpe was appointed, 1740, to the
chief comnmand in South Carolina and Georgia.   Soon
after his appointment, he projected an expedition againist
St. Augustine. Aided by Virginia and Carolina, he
marched at the head of mnore than two thousand men, for
Florida, and after taking two small Spanish forts, Diego
and Moosa, he sat down before St. Augustine.   Capt.
Price with several twenty gun ships, assisted by sea; but
after all their exertions, the general was forced to raise
the siege, and return with conisiderable loss.
XXIV. Two years after, 1742, the Spaniards invaded
Georgia in turn.  A  Spanish armament, consisting of
thirty-two sail, with three thousand men, under command
of Don Manuel de Monteano, sailed from St. Augustine,
and arrived in the river Altamaha. The expedition, although fitted out at great expense, failed of accomplishing
its object.
General Oglethorpe was at this time at fort Siinons. Finding
himself unable to retain possession of it, having but about seven
hundred men, he spiked his cannon, and, destroying his military stores, retreated to his head-quarters at Fredrica.
On the fiIrst prospect of an invasion, General Oglethorpe had
applied to the governour of South Carolina for assistance, but
the Carolinians, fearing for the safety of their own territory
and not approving of general Oglethorpe's management in his
late expedition against St. Augustine, declined furnishing
troops, but voted supplies.
In this state of danger and perplexity, the general resorted
to stratagem. A French soldier belonging to his army had demerted to the enemy. Fearing the consequences of their learning his weakness, he devised a plan by which to destroy the
credit of any information that the deserter might give.
With this view, he wrote a let',1;?' to the French deserter in
the Spanish camp, addressing him as if he were a spy of the
English. This letter he bribed a Spanish captive to deliver, in
which he directed the deserter to state to the Spaniards, that he
was in a weak and defenceless condition, and to urge them on
to an attack.:. Should he not be able, however, to persuade them to this, hewished him to induce themto continue three days longer at their
quarters, in which time he expected two thousand men, and
six British men of war, from Carolina. The above letter, as
was intended, was delivered to the Spanish general, instead of
the deserter, who immiediately put the latter in irons.
A council of war was called, and, while deliberating upon the
measures which.h muld be taken, three supply ships, which had
been voted by Carolina, appeared in sight., Imaginring these
to be the men of war alluded to in the letter, thlle Spaniards, in
great haste, fired the fort, and emnbarked, leaving behind themn
several cannon, and a quantity of provisions. By this artfiul,
but unjustifiable expedient, the country was relieved of its inm
vaders, and Georgia, and probably a great part of South Caro.

XXV. In 1752, the colony, continuing in a languishing condition, althouLgh parlianment hlad at different times
given them  nearly one hundred thousand pounds, and
many complaints having been made against the system ol
reguilations adopted by the trustees, they surrendered their
charter to the crownr upon which the government became
regal. In 1755, a general court was established.
XXVI. March, 29th, 1744, Great Britain, under
George II. declared war against F'rance anzd Spain.
The most important event of this war, in Am-erica, was
the capture of Louisburg, finm the French, by the New.
England colonies, under command of Sir William Pepperell.
Louisburg was a town belongin- to the French in the island
of Cape Breton; fortified at the expense of five million and a
half of dollars, and, on account, of its strength wvas sometimes
called " The Gibraltar of America."
The acquisition of this place was deemed eminently important to New-England, since, while in possession of the
French, it had furnished a safe and convenient retreat to
such privateers as disturbed and captured the inhabitants
of the colonies employed in the fisheries.
Of the forces, Massachusetts raised 3250; Connecticut 516;
Rhode-Island and New-Hampshire 300 each. The naval force
consisted of 12 ships and some smaller vessels. OnI the 24th
of March, the fleet, with the troops on board, sailed from Boston,'and arrived at Louisburg the last of April; soon after      THREE V WARS OF WM. I l.-.ANNE....GEO. I    a
which, they were joined by Commodore Warren, in the Superb, of 60 guns, and others of his squadron.
The troops being landed, commenced the siege. For 14
nights the army were occupied in drawing their cannon, shot.
&amp;c. over a deep swamp, two miles.in extent, towards the
place.
In the mean time, Commodore Warren captured the Vigi
lant, a French ship of 74 guni, having on board 560 men, and
great quantities of military stores.
The siege against the town continued till the 15th of June
when the French commander requested that hostilities mighl
cease. On the 17th, the city of Louisburg, and the island of
Cape Breton, were surrendered to his Britannick majesty.
Thus successfully terminated a daring expedition, which
had been undertaken without thle knowledge of the mother
country. The acquisition of the fortress of Louisburg was at
useful and important to the colonies, and to the British empire,
as its reduction was surprising fo that empire, and mortifying
to the court of France.
Besides the stores and prizes which fell into the hands of the
English, which were estimated at little less than a million ster
ling, security was given to the colonies in their fisheries
Nova Scotia was preserved, and the trade and fisheries ol
France nearly ruined.
XXVII. The capture of Louisburg roused the court of
France to seek revenge. Under the duke D'Anville, a
nobleman of great courage, an armament was sent to
America, 1746, consisting of forty ships of war, fifty-six
transports, with th"tee thousand five hundred men, and
forty thousand stands of arms for theise of the French
and Indians in Canada. The object of this expedition
was to recover possession of Cape Breton, and to attack
the colonies. A merciful Providence, however, averted
the blow, and by delaying the fleet, and afterwards disabling it in a storm, blasted the hopes of the enemy.
Great was the consternation of the colonies, when the news
arrived that the French fleet was near the American coast
and greatly increased, on learning that no English fleet was in
quest of it.
Several ships of this formidable French fleet were damaged
by storms; others were lost, and one forced to return to B3reat,
on account of a malignant disease among her crew. Two or
t(iree only of the ships, with a few of the transports arrived a

tification; or, as some say, by poison. The vice-admiral came
to a similar tragical death by running himself through the
body. That part of the fleet that arrived, sailed with a view
to attack Annapolis, but a storm scattered them, and prevented the accomplishment of this object.
XXVIII. In April, 1748, preliminaries of peace were
signed between France and England, at Aix-la-Chapelle,
soon after which, hostilities ceased. The definitive treaty
was signed in October. -Prisoners on all sides were o
be released without ransom, and all conquests made during the war were to-be mutually restored.

colonies were now peopled with inhabitants, by -far the
greater part of whom were born and educated in America. And although the first settlers were collected from
most, or all, the countries of Europe, and emigrants from
various nations continued to flock to America, still we
may observe, during this period, a gradual assimilation of
national manners and character. The peculiarities of
each class became less distinct by intercourse with the
others, and every succeeding generation seemed to exhibit.
less strikingly, tk%se traits which distinguished the pre
ceding.
Although this is true with respect to the American colonies
generally, there were some exceptions. Somd villages, or territories, being settled exclusively by emigrants speaking a dif.
ferent language from that generally spoken-as the Germans,
for example-or entertaining some peculiar religious notions
as the Quakers-still preserved their own peculiar manners.
But in attemnpting to ascribe some general character to the
people of the colonies during this period, we mnight consider
them, as during our second period, on the whole, exhibiting
three varieties; viz. the rigid puritan English of the norththe Dutch in New-York-and the luxurious English of the
south. The austerity of the north was, howevex, much relax.ed. The elegant varieties of life, which before had been pro~
hibited, were tolerated, and the refinements of polished societ     THREE WARS OF WM. II....ANNE....GEO. Ilo     87
appeared among the higher classes. The strong lines of Dutch
manners in New-York were slowly disappearing under an
English government, and by means of the settlement of English among them. The manners of the south were assuming
an aspect of more refinement, particularly among the higher
classes-but showed little other change.
XXX.      gt'tttigi.  During this period, the, spirit of
religious bigotry and intolerance may be observed to have
abated in a very considerable degree.  The conduct of
those sects, which had called forth those severe and unjustifiable restrictions upon the freedom of religious worship, had become less offensive and exceptionable; and
at the close of this period, religious persecution had ceased in all the colonies, and the rights of conscience were
generally recognized.
In 1692, the Mennonites were introduced into Pennsylvania,
and settled at Gelrmantown. Their increase, however, has
been small.
In 1719, the Tunlcers, or General Baptists, arrived at Philadelphia, and dispersed themselves into several parts of Pennsylvania.
In 1741, the Moravians were introduced into America by
Count Zinzendorf, and settled at Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
Regularity, industry, ingenuity, and economy, are characteristick of this people. They have considerably increased, and
are a respectable body of Christians.
The Germnan Lutherans were first introduced into the American colonies during this period, and settled principally in
Pennsylvania and New-York.
Episcopacy was considerably extenr el during this period.
In 1693, it was introduced into New-York; into New-Jersey
and Rhode-Island in 1702; into South Carolina in 1703, by
lawv in Connecticut in 1704.
In 1708, the Saybrook Platform was formed by a Synod,
composed of congregational ministers, under authority of the
legislature of Connecticut.
About the year 1737, a revival of religion very extensively
prevailed in New-England. At this time great numbers' unted themselves to the church, and testified by their conduct
ftlrough life the genuineness of their profession.
The celebrated Whitfield came to Amrnerica about the year
1740, and produced great religious excitenient by his singular
powers of pulpit eloquence. He did not found any peculiar
sect in this country, although he gave rise to that of the Calgisistick lIethodists in EnglandUNITED STATrES

In th,e, the Spaniards took the lead; and have the
honour of first conmmunicating to Europe the intelligence
or a Newi World.
F.r,6wleral years previously to thle discovery f Ane--
niica tie'dt~ention of Europe lhad been drawn to the e-)XXXI. g]agt      aII  eI o1trrttCg. Although the
trade of the colonies began to feel the restrictions imposed
upon it by the mother country, still it steadily increased
luring this period.
From the very commencement of the colonies, the mother
country was not without her jealousies respecting their increase in population, trade, and manufactures. Inquiries on
these points were instituted, and opportunities sought to keep
in check the spirit of colonial enterprise. Laws were enacted
from time to time, designed and calculated not only to make
the colonies depend on the mother country for her manufactures, but also to limit their trade and commerce, and keep
them in safe subjection to England.
As illustrating this course of policy, we may notice several
laws of parliament. In 1732, an act was passed, prohibiting
the exportation of hats out of the plantations of America, and
to restrain the number of apprentices taken by hat makers."
So also the act of 1750, prohibited, on penalty of two hundred
pounds,' the erection of any mill for slitting, or rolling of
iron, or any plating forge to work with a tilt hamrmer; or any
furnace for making steel in any of the colonies." At the same
time, encouragemnent was given to export pig and bar iron tc
England for her manufactories. In like manner was prohlibit
ed the exportation from one province to another by water, and
even the carriage by land, on horseback, or in a cart, of ali
wools and woollen goods of the produce of America. The colonies were also compelled by law to procure many articles
from England, which they could have purchased twenty per
cent. cheaper in other nmarkets.
But notwithstanding these restrictions, trade and commerce
gradually and steadlily increased. To Englaid, the colonies
exported lumber of all sorts, hemp, flax, pitch, tar, oil, rosin,
copper ore, pig and bar iron, whale fins, tobacco, rice, fish, indigo, flax-seed, beeswax, raw silk, &amp;c. They also built many
vessels which were sold in thlie mother country.
Bult the importation of goods from England, in consequence
of the course pursued by the British government, was still much
greater than the amount of exports to Engrland. In 1728, sir
William Keith stated that the colonies then consulmed one sixth
part of all the woolen manufactures exported from Great Britain, and more than double that value in linen and calicoes; also
great quantities of English manufactured silks, small wares,
household furniture, trinkets, and a very con'.siderable value in
East India goods. From )739 to 1756, this impof'tation of      THREE WARS OF WM. Ill....ANNE....GEO. II.   89
goods from England amounted to one million of pounds sterling
hnnually, on an average.
But if the amount of imports from Great Britain was thus
more than the colonies exported thither, they would fall in debt
to England. How did they pay this balance of trade against
them? It was done by gold and silver, obtained chiefly from the
West India settlements, to which they exported lumber, fish of
an inferior quality, beef, pork, butter, horses, poultry, and other live stock, an inferior kind of tobacco, corn, cider, apples,
cabbages, onions, &amp;c.  They built also mnany small vessels,
which found a ready market.
The cod and whale fisheries were becoming considerable;
they were principally carried on by New-England. The codfish were sold in Spain, France, lEngland, the West-Indies, &amp;c.
and the money obtained for them aided the colonies in paying
the balance of trade against them in England.
XXXII.     ltr;U;ItUtr. Agriculture, during    this
period, was greatly improved and extended. Immense
tracts of forests were cleared, and more enlightened modes
of husbandry were intioduced., The number of articles
produced by agriculture was also increased.
The colonies now not only raised a sufficient supply of food
for their own use, but their exports became great. Wheat and
other English grain were the principal products of the middle
colonies; grain, beef) pork, horses, butter, cheese, &amp;c. were the
chief products of the northern colonies; tobacco, wheat, and
xice, were the principal products of the south.
in the south, also, large inumbers of swine ran wild in the
forests, living upon mast. These were taken, salted down, and
exported to a considerable extent.
XXXIII. at"t;      alt'      agltUlf  ttt~'Under

mllanufactures,.Nowithstanding these, however, the coarser kindcls of cutlery, somne coarse cloths, both lin'en and
woolenb hats paper, shoes household furniture farming
Utensils &amp;c. were manufactured to a considlerable extent;
not sufficient, however, to supply the inhabitants. All
these manufactories were on a small scale; cloths were
made, in some families, for their own censumption.
The art of printing made considerable progress, during this
period. A newspaper, the first min North America, called The
Boston Weekly News-Letter, was established in 1704. Before  90              PERIOD III....1689....I756.
the close of this period, ten others were established-four in
New-England; two in New-York; two in Pennsylvania; one
in South Carolina; and one in Maryland. The number of
books published was also considerable, although they were executed in a coarse style, and weIre generally books of devotion,
or for the purposes of education.
XXXIV. ]OVUhItiol 01      At the expiration of our
second period) we estimated the population of the English colonies in America, at 200,000 souls. About the
close of our third period, Franklin calculated that there
were then one million or upwards, and that scarce 80,000
hlad been broughlt over sea.
XXXV.    Ubitf8T.' The southern colonies continued to treat the subject of education differently from
the northern colonies, in this respect; in the north, one
of the first objects of legislation was to provide for the
education of all classes; in the southl, the education o
the higher classes only was an ob,ect of publick attention.
The first publick institution for tie purposes of education)
which succeeded in the south, was that of William and Marr
Collegein Virginia,estabiishedin 1692, bythe sovereignswhos
names it bears.  
Yale College, in Connecticut, was commenced in 1700-.
eleven of the principal ministers of the neighbouring towns
who had been appointed to adopt such measures as they should
deemn expedient, on the subject of a college-agreeing, to found
one in the colony.  The next year, the legislature granteil,hem a charter. The college was begun.t at Saybrook, wher,
was held the first commencement, in 1702. fn 1717, it w;&gt;
removed to New-Haven, where it became permanently established. It was named after the I-Ton. Elihu Yale, governor,
of the East India Company, who was its principal-benefaector.
The College, at Princeton, New-Jersey, calledJ "Nassau
Hall,"7 was first founded by charter from Johln Hamilton, Es
president of the council, about the year 1X738, and was enlar
ed by Gov. Belcher, in 1747.

lation, extending their commerce, forming new settlements,
enlarging the boundaries of their territory, and laying wider
and deeper the foundations of a future nation. An'd, while we
look back, with admiration, upon the hardy spirit which carried our ancestors through scenes so trying, and enabled themn
to rp", -rosperity from the crimsoned fields of battle and bloodshee, let us be thankful that our lot is cast in a happier day;
and that instead of sharing in the perils of feeble colonies, we
enjoy the protection and privileges of a free and powerful nation.
In addition to the reflections subjoined to the a.ccount which
wvve have given of the " Salem witchcraft," we may add another
respecting the danger of poputlar delusion.  In that portion of
our history, we see a kind of madness rising up, and soon
stretching its inafluence over a whole community. And such
too is the pervading power of thie spell, that the wise and ignorant, the good and bad, are alike subject to its control, and for
she time, alike incapable of judging, or reasoning aright.
Now, whenever we see a community divided into parties, and
g;itated by some general excitement-when we feel ourselves
borne along on one side or the other, by the popular tide, let
us inquire whether we are not acting under the influence of a
delusion, which a few years, perhaps a few months, or days,
mnay dispel and expose.--Nor, at such a time, let us regard our
4inceiity, or our conscioisness of integrity, or the- seeming
clearness and certainty of our reasonings, as furnishing an abiolute assurance that, after all, we do not mistake, and that

DISTINGUISHED FOR THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR.
French and Indian War.
Extending from the Declaration of War by England
against France, 1756, to the Commencement of Hostilities by Great Britain against the American Colo.
nies, in the Battle of Lexi?zgton, 1775.
Section 1. The war, which ended in the treaty of Aixla-Chapelle, in 1748, had been highly injurious to the
general prosperity of his Majesty's Colonies in America              ~ENCII AND INDIAN WAR.                 93
and the return of peace found them in a state of impoverishment and distress.  Great losses had been sustained in
their commerce, and many of their vessels had been seized oni the coast by privateers. Bills of credit, to the
amount of several millions, had been issued to carry on the
war, which they were now utinable to redeem, and the
losses of men in various expeditions against the enemy,
had seriously retarded the increase of population.
The expenses of the northern colonies, including New-England and New-York, during the war, were estimated at not less
than one million pounds sterling. Massachusetts alone is said
to have paid half this sum, and to have expended nearly four
hundred thousand pounds, in the expedition against Cape Breton. The expenses of Carolina, for the war in that quarter,
were not less in proportion.
To supply the deficiency of money, bills of credit were issued to the amount of several millions. The bills issued by Massachusetts, during two orthree years of the war, amounted to
between two and three mnillions currency; while at the time of
their emission, five or six hundred pounds were equal to only
one hundred pounds sterling. Before the complete redemption
of these bills, says Dr. Trumbull, in those colonies where their
credit was best supported, the depreciation was nearly twenty
for one.
The losses sustained by the colonies, in the'fall of many of
their bravest me-, during this and the last Indian war, were severely felt. From  1722 to 1749, a period of twenty-seven
ears, the losses of MSassachusetts and New-Hampshire equalled the whole increase of their numbers, whereas, in the natural course of population, their numbers would have more
than doubled.
Such, in few words, was the general state of the colonies
at the close of this war.  The return of peace was hailed(
as the harbinger of better days, and the enterprising spirit
of the people soon exerted itself to repair the losses which
had been sustained. Commerce, therefore, again flourishW
ed; population increased; settlements were extended
and publick credit revived.
II. Scarcely, however, had the colonies time to reap
the benefits of peace, before the prospect was clouded, and
the sound of approaching war filled the land with general
anxiety and distress.  After an interval of only abouteight years, fiom 1748 to May 18th, 1756, Great Britain,
under George II. formally declared war against France,
which declaration was reciprocated on the ninrth of June,
by a similar declaration on the part of France, under
Louis XV. against Great Britain.
The general cause, leading to this war, commonly call
ed the' French and Indian War," was the alleged en
croachments of the French, upon the frontiers of the colonies in America, belonging to the English Crown.
These encroachments were made upon Nova Scotia in the
east, which had been ceded to Great Britain, by the 12th article of the treaty of Utrecht, but to a considerable part of
which the French laid claim, and, in several places, were erecting fortifications. In the north and west, they were se{tling
and fortifying Crown Point, and, in the west, were not only
attempting to complete a line of forts from the head of the St.
Lawrence to the Mississippi, but were encroaching far on
Virginia.
The circumstance which served to open the woar, was
the alleged intrusion of the Ohio Company upon the territory of the French. This company consisted of a number of influential men, from London and Virginia, who
had obtained a charter grant of six hundred thousand
acres of land, on and near the river Ohio, for the purpose
of carrying on the fur trade with the Indians, and of settling the country.
The governour of Canada had early intelligence of the
transactions of this company. Fearing that their plan
would deprive the French of the advantages of the fur
trade, and preventt communications between Canada and
Louisiana, he wrote to the governour of New-York and
Pennsylvania, claimning the country east of the Ohio to the
Alleghanies, and forbidding the further encroachments ot
the English traders.
As yet, the Pennsylvanians had principally managed the
trade with the Indians. But, being now about to be deprived
of it, by the Ohio Company, who were opening a road to the
Potomac, they excited the fears of the Indians, lest their lands
should be taken from them, and gave early intelligence to the
French, of the designs and transactions of the Comrnpany.
The French governour soon manifested his hostile determr             FREN1CH AND INDIAN WAR             9
nation, by seizing several of the English traders, and carryinLg
them to a French port on the south of Lake Erie.-The Twightwees, a tribe of Indians in Ohio, near Miami river, among
whom the English had been trading, resented the seizure, and
by way of retaliation, took several French traders, and sent
them to Pennsylvania.
In the mnean time, a communication was opened along
the French Creek and Alleghany river, between Fort
Presqul I1e, on Lake Erie, and the Ohio; and French
troops were stationed at convenient distances, secured by
temporary fortifications.
The Ohio Company, thus threatened with the destrue
tion of their trade, were now loud in their complaints
Dinwiddie, lieut. governour of Virginia, to whom these
complaints were addressed, laid the subject before the assembiy, which ordered a messenger to be despatched to
the French commandant on the Ohio, to demand the
reasons of his hostile conduct and to -' ummon the French
tt) evacuate their forts in that reglor
III. The person entrusted with this service was George
JYalshington, who, at the early age of twenty-one, thus
itepped forth in the publick cause, and began that line of
tervices, which ended in the indepeydence of his country.
The service to which Washingto. was now appcinted,
was both difficult and dangerous; t,  place of his destination being above four hundred m; s distant, two hundred of which lay through a trackles, desert, inhabited by
Indians.- He arrived in safety, however, and delivered
a letter from Gov. Dinwiddie to the commandant. Hay
ing received a written answer, and secretly taken the
dimensions of the fort, he returned. The reply of the
commandant to Gov. Dinwiddie was, that he had taken
possession of the country, under the direction of the governour-general of Canada, to whomhe would transmit his
letter and whose orders only he would obey.
IV. The British ministry, cn being made acquainted
with the claims, conduct, and determination of the French,
without a formal declaration of war, instructed the Vir-,ginians to resist their encroachments, by force of arms.      n9~6 P~ERIOD          L_oo1TG7.56...775o
Accordingly, a regiment was raised in Virginia, which
was;oined by an independent company from South Carolina7 and with this force, Washington,. who was appointed to command the expedition, and was now iaised
from the rank of major to that of colonel, marched early
in April, 1754, towards the Great Meadows, lying within
the disputed territories, for the purpose of expelling the
French.  The enterprise of Washington and his troops
was tighly creditable to them, but the French forces
being considerably superiour, he was obliged to capitulate
with the privilege, however, of returning with his troops to
Virginia.
On his arrival at the Great Meadows, he learned that the
French hiad dispossessed some Virginians of a fortification,
whici the latter were erecting for the Ohio Company, at the
confluence of the Alieghany and Mlonongahela, and were engaged in comrnpleting it, for tleir own use. He also learned
that a detachmnt from that place, then on its march towards
the Great Meadows, had encamped for the night7 in a low and
retired situation.
Under the guidance of some friendly Indians, and under cover of a dark and rainy night, this party he surprised and cap.
tured. Having erected, at the Great Meadows, a small stockade fort, afterwards called Fort Necessity, he proceeded with
his troops, reinforced by troops from New-York, and others
fiom South Carolina, to nearly four hundred men, towards the
French fort Du Quesne, novw Pittsburg, with the intention o
dislodging the eniemy. H-learing, however, that the enernm
were approaching, he judged it prudent to retire to Fort NS
cessity.
Here the enemy, one thousand five hundred strong, undclthe command of M. de Villiers, soon appeared and commenc(t,
a furious attack on the fort. After an engagement of seve:t
hours, de Villiers demanded a parley, and offered terms of c~
pitulation. These terms were rejected; but during the nigh3t,
July 4th, articles were signed, by which Washington vas
permitted, upon surrendering the fort, to march with ijF
troops, unmolested, to Virginia.
Such was the beginning (ff open hostilities, which w'.rw
succeeded by a series of 6~her hostilities characterize( y
the spirit and manner of war, although the formal di ~A1
ration of war was not made until 1756, two years aft..
already mentioned.                FRZENCH AND INDIAN WAR.                 97
V. The British ministry, perceiving war to be inevitable, recommended to the British colonies in America,
to unite in some scheme for their common defence. Accordingly, a convention of delegates from Massachusetts,
New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, PFennsylvania, Maryland, withll thlae lieut. governour and council of
New-York, was held at Albany, this year, 1754, and a
plan of union adopted, resembling, in several of its features
the present constitution of the United States.
But the plan mnet with the approbation, neither of the
Provincial Assemnblies nor the King's Council.  By the
former it was rejected, because it gave too much power
eo the crown, and by the latter,'because it gave too much
power to the people.
According to this plan, a grand council was to be formed of
members chosen by the provincial assemblies, and sent from all
the colonies; which counicil, with a governour general, appointed by the crown, and having a negativo voice, should be
empowered to make general laws, to raise mnoney in all the
colonies for their defence, to call forth troops, regulate trade,
lay duties, &amp;c. &amp;c.
The plan, thus matured, was approved and signed on the
fourth of July, the day that W-a-'hin}ton surrendered Fort Necessity, and twenty-two years before the declaration of Independence, by all tlhe delegates, excepting those from Connecticut, who objected to the negative voice of the governour
general.
One circumstance, in the history-of this plan, deserves here
to be recorded, as evincing the dawning spirit of the revolution. Although the plan wvas rejected by the provincial as-.
semblies, they declared, without reserve, that if it were adopted, they would undertake to defenJ themselves from the
French, without any assistance from Great Britain. They
required but to be left to employ their supplies in their owu
way, to effect their security and predominance.
The mother country was too jealous to trust such powers
with the Americans; but she proposed another plan, designed
to lay a foundation for the perpetual dependence and slavery
of the colonies. This plan was, that the governours, with
one or more of their council, should form a convention to concert measures for the general defence, to erect fortifications
raise men, &amp;c. &amp;c. with power to draw upon the British treasutry to defray all charges; which charges should be reimbursed by taxes upon tie colonies, imposed by acts of parliament. But to
