PLEA FOR THE MAINE LAW.*J-Mett}a Victoria Tictor.
TIIOUGH I spake with the tongue of a denouncing angel,
from now till the day of retribution, I could not depict all
the evils of the liquor traffic; that though I wrote with a
pen inspired with terror and winged with lightning, I could
never write out the half of its abomninations. I should say
that a poor and virtuous nation was more secure of immortality and dignity than a rich and wicked one; and that if
it was going to impoverish this country to abolish this traffic, it had better be honorably humble, than magnificently
wicked; and I Mwould refer mny hearers to those often quoted
examples of the Cities of the Plain, of Babylon, and Rome.
But I would furtlier affirm, that so far from decreasinlg
agricultural and commelcial prosperity, it would increase
both. just as certain as the wretched inebriates whlo stpport one rummery would invest the money, which tlhey
there throw away, on food, rent, and cloth~ing. I would
say that if there are ten thousand men supported in tlhis
State by the trade, that they are supported by the entire
ruin of thirty thousand, and the injury of three hundred
thousand. I would ask if that was political economy. I
would state a very simple proposition, and let theim [mnultiply the answer by as many drunkards as there are in these
United States. If a man instead of eatiing twelve bushlels
of grain, drinks eight and eats four, Mwill the farnmer have
any larger market for his produce?-and by the loathing
of food which liquor produces, the wasting of strength, and
the shortening of life, will he not lose ten years of that
man's custom? while the producers of clothing lose almost entirely hissupport, his employers lose what mighlt
be a profitable workmnan, and the man himself, and those
whom he would have benefited by it in honlest exchanges,
loses almost the whole of that comfortable income which
his wasted strength and industry would have achieveld!
The farmer sells ten dollars' worth of grain; to support
the distiller and rumseller, both needless and useless
members of society, the consumer pays thirty for itthe tlhirty dollars is all that he could earn under the influence of the distilled grain, where he would otherNwise have

14NOT ON TIIE BATTLE-FIELD.,b,ted niRety-the hatter, and shoemaker, and landlord,
aL.d merchant are robbed of sixty-and the many lose that
the few may gain. Then there is another loss in the diminished demlands of his starving and naked family; anotner
in his requiring a police-officer or sheriff to attend to him,
a prison or workhouse to put him in-a coffin and six feet
of earth, at the expense of the community. Another los
in his premature death. So much for the political economy. Of some other losses I might not have the courage
to speak; the loss of health, of peace of mind, of reason,
of friends, of domestic prosperity, and the loss of future
happiness. I am afraid my voice would fail if it touched
upon such losses. Perhaps I should regain my courage,
however, if I had a drunkard's child by my side, and
could hold up her injured form in my arms and point to
the cruel proceeds of a shlilling's worth of whiskey.
You say, like women, w.e try to prove every thing by an
appeal to our sympathies. Well, what better part of you is
there to appeal to? Reason, of which men are so boastful, forever and forever runs away with itself unless restrained and directed by the heart. Take those greatest
and most subtle reasons, and let them run the rounds of
their mighty intellects, and to what have many of the most
brilliant returned?-to a lower point than the huniblest
lheart could ever fall to-to a belief in their own brutishness and materiality. Is it not a principle in all good governments to adopt those measures which will secure the greatest good to the most people? You know that the Maine
Liquor Law, or even a more stringent one, would do this.
I tel' you a large class of people demand this ltw, who
have vet no voice in the matter. They are the wives,
8isters, and daughters of those who support the distillers
and rumsellers. Not that I wish woman to go to the polls;
but if every man, would ask the female portion of his
house who to vote for, those men would be elected who
would not fail to give us this law. Oh, give us this Saving

THiE ITALLIAN STRUGGLE.--George Sumner, 1S59.
THEI actual war between Italy and France on one
side, and Austria on the other, is but the continuation of
our own struggle on another field,-the struggle for national freedoin, equal rights, and self-government.
How far these mav be secured by the present contest is
still uncertain; but there is no uncertainty in this, that our
warniest sympathies are due to all who strive for them.
In the present case these sympathies are augmented by a
remembrance of all we owe to Italy-that beautiful country which the Apennines divide, the Alps and sea surrouiid
--Italy, which has given us so much, of all that adorns and
elevates life,-the home of art, of science, of medical skill
of political knowledge,-of Galileo, Raffael, Michael Angelo,
of Fallopio, and of Galvani,-the land which in modern
times has given us the earliest epic poet, Dante-the great
lyric poets, Filicaia and Petrarch-the earliest novelist,
IBoccaccio-and the first pliilosophical historian, Vico, whose
great nlind has brought to the development of political
science and the laws of the moral world the same precision
that Galileo had brought to those of the material world.
To Italy we owe the discovery or invention of book-lkeeping, the mariners' compass, the barometer, the telescope
applied to astronomnv, the calculation of longitudes, the
pendulum as a measure of timne, the laws of hydraulIcs, the
rules of navigation; and to Italy we owe both Columbus
who discovered, and Amerigo Vespucci who gave hli
uame to our country.THE ITALIAN STRUGGLE.                  19
To Italy we owe also some of the most important lessons
of political philosophy. Her Republics of the 3middle ages
were based on the three great principles:
1st. That all authority over the people emanates -from
the people.
2d. That power should return at stated intervals to the
people.
3d. That the holder of power should be strictly responuible to the people for its use.
To those Republics we also owe the practical demonstration of the great truth, that no state can long prosper or
exist, where intelligent labor is not held in honor,-and
that labor cannot be honorable where it is not free.
Our sympathies are augmented by a remembrance of all
this-aind by the natural horror inspired by Austria, to
which civilization for three hundred and thirty years owes
nothing,--whose w1iole career, both at home and abroad,
has been a series of blackest crimes against the political
right of States, anid the individual rights of man,-and
which is now under the despotic control of an Emperor,
who is a deplorable example of the union of youth and
cruelty.
But there are some, happily their number is few, whlo,
having no faith in the people, look with indifference upon
their efforts,-and others who try to cloak the selfishness
and imbecility with which Nature has endowed themn,, under an assumed superiority over the people of other countries,-who tell us that other nations are not fitted for free
institutions,-who seem to think that they have a patent
for freedom, and an exclusive right to enjoy it, that they
are God's chosen people, and that all others are made onlly
to be ruled by tyrants.
But we, as Americans, as Freemen, as Christians, would
be untrue to our liberty, to our humanity, to our age, not
to frown down the miserablc plea, that "Italy can not
govern herself-that her people are not ready and fit for
liberty. Be free,', land of the great and good!-be free
O country of the Past! Renew thv ancient glory, and
crown thy old ruins with the halo of the brave and wise,
for ye are worthy, indeed, of freedom and new life. Be
free, 0 Italy!

But, mr dear frieids, this sixpenny patriotism is most
horrible stuff; it is patriotism of the head, an(d n~t of th;e

induces you to filght in times of peace, and takes ali the
starch out of your courage in times of war.  While this
artif;.ial patriotism is etlervescing in your cocoa-rnts, )your
boa.ts of inidependence are loud aind clamorous; but when
its spirit has evaporated, you are the veriest serviles that
ever writlhed under the lash of despotism. If you stppose,

And my gratuitous prayer is, that you may maintain it as

still river of death.  To preserve your collective strength,
your hearts, y3our feelings, and your pure svylpathies mnist
be all joined together, like the linuks of a log-cllain.  You

The bounds of freedom wider yet,"
TILE EQUALITY OF MIAN.-B-  y the same.
THESE sublime ideas of the Declaration of Indepeneence,
express the whole creed of the equality of humanity, the
basis of government, and the rights of the people. They
speak to the universal heart of mankind. They declare to
Kings, and Princes, and Nobles, and Statesmen, " Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed, to secure the inalienable
rights of men to liberty;" they proclaim to toilting milions,
"whenever" any form of government becomes destructive
of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish
it;" they utter in the hungry ears of lowly bondmen, "all
men are created equal," and " endowed with the inalienable
rights of liberty and the pursuit of happiness."  These
"self-evident truths" may be hated and spurned by the
monarch, in the arrogance of unrestricted power; they
may be scoffed at and jeered at by the noble, hedged about
with ancient privileges; they may be limited, qualified, or
denied by the ignoble politician, whose apostasy is revealed
and rebuked by the brilliancy of their steady light; they
may be sneered at as " glittering generalities" by the nerveless conservative, who "has ever opposed every useful
reform and wailed over every rotten institution as it fell,"but they live in the throbbing hearts of the toiling massoe,
and they nurse the wavering hopes of hapless bondmen
amid the thick gloom of rayless oppression. When the
Christian shall erase from the Book of Life the precious
words-- "Do unto others as ye would that others should do

These words, these ideas, -hich underlie the instit,tilions of
the Republic associate the name of AmIerica with the cause
of universal freedom and progress all over the globe. NWe
may be recreant to these ideas, we may ignobly fail, the
government may perish, the country may sink downI beneath the level of the seas so that the waters of the Atlantic
and Pacific shall meet, mingle, and roll over her loftiest
summits, but the incorporation of these sacred ideas into
the charter of National Independence will bear the name
of the Noirth American Republic down to conming ages, and
win for it the grateful homage and lasting remembrance of
mankind.
TRUE CHARACTER OF TIIE REVOLUTION.-By the samr
TuIE great contest which resulted in national independence,
was a contest between power and principle-authority and
liberty. England and America were not alone interested
in its results. It concerned universal man, and upoIl the
character of the contest mankind has pronounced its irreversible verdict for the cause of America. British ministers
and hereditary statesmen, smiled upon by the king and
applauded by the people, flushed with the arrogance of
assured power, regarded with disdainful contempt the humble leaders of popular liberty in America, whose names
were hardly known to the haughty chiefs that wielded the
mighty power, and commanded for the purposes of conquest and subjugation the vast resources of the British
Empire. But with each revolving year the names of these
arrogant British chiefs are passing from the recollection of
mankind, and their fame is growing more dim and obscure;-with each passing year the fame of the leaders of
the cause of popular liberty in America is steadily brightening. The leaders who shaped the policy of America received, while living, the grateful homage of an admiring
country, and a grateful people called them into positiona
of trust and honor under the government they had founded;-the ministers and statesmen of England wore ignobl.

names of Washington and Franklin, Adams and Jefferson,

tionate regard and profound reverence,-England, if she
recalls at all the dimmed names of North, Grenville,
Grafton, Dartmouth, Sandwich, Wedderburn, and their
haughty compeers, she reproaches their memories with the
folly and madiiness which lost America to the British Empire.  America remembers and hallows even the battlefields of defeat, for the blood of her sons, n-ho fell on those
lost fields, was shed for fireedomn and independence; England strives not to remeimber even her battle-fields of
victorv, for they were won in support of a'ost cause, and
brought ne'ther power nor glory.
TIHE FRUITS OF THE WAR.-By the same.
E[GHTY-TLIREE years!  IIow brief a span in the life of
nations,--in the history of the world! And yet, what
mighty changes have these eighty-three years wrought in
the condition of America. VWhen the morn of the 4th of
July, 1776, dawned upon America, thirteen dependent,
disunited, feeble colonies dotted the shores of the Atlanltic
from the St. Johns to the St. Marys; and within these colonies
dwelt less than two and a half millions of freemen, differing
in origin, in race, customs, in imanners and habits; without
money, without arms, iw-ithout a national goverlnment,
name, or character; bound together by a burning sense of
oppression, a coiimmon danger, and an intense, vehement,
andl inextinguishable love of personal freedomi. And these
colonies, menaced by the gigantic power of Elngland, whose
navies rode in haughtv pride upon their seas, and the
battle-fires of whose armies flashed upon their shores,unsupported by any friendly power, with hardly a weapon
for defence, on the 4th of July, 1776, calmly proclaimed
America independent, pronounced the sentence of eternal

separation from the British Empire, and hurled defiance
at that power, which had so often sent confusion into the
councils of princes, and carried terror into the ranks of the
veteran armies of the proudest monarchies of the Eastern
world. On that day these colonies placed themselves front
to front with that power, whose brilliant victories by sea and
by land, in both heniispheres, had filled the whole earth with
her renown,-power, which had recently, under the guidance of the elder Pitt, humbled the proud monarchy of
France, arrested her splendid schemes of empire in the
Western world, and wrested from her possession her mag
nificent colonial empire in North America.
As we-c refiresh our memories with the recollections of tho
deeds of the illustrious men of the Revolutionary era, whlo
carried.merica through years of civil war, from colonial
dependence to national independence, the proud consciousness that they were not only successful beyond the
ordinary lot of mortals, but that they were right, and " had,"
in the words of Camden in the House of Lords, "the natuiral righlts of man, and the immutable laws of nature" on
their side, is a source of profound gratification.  Whenc
the champions of the rights of the colonics resisted the
demands of arbitrary power, when they raised the standar(l
of independence, and rested their cause upon the rights of
human nature and the laws of the living God, they w-ere
scoffed at, and jeered at as "visionary enthusiasts," and
England echoed with the words of scorn, derision, and coiitempt, poured out by king and aristocracy, and the parasites of power, upon noble men, who were contending ill
Anlerica for the principles for which Hlampden and Sidiney
struggled. "Let the Americans," exclaimed Gower, in tiil
House of Lords, with scornful derision " talk about their
natural and divine rights,--their riihts as men and citizen;s
--their rights fi'om God and nature! I am for enforchinif
these measures!"  Sandwich contemptuously declarc i
that the kAmericans were " cowardly,-the very soun(l of.a cannon w-ould send them off as fiast as their feet wouldl
carry them!"  Gr3ant, amidst the loude cheering, asserted
that "Amnericans would not fight, that they were not soldiecs and never could be made so, being naturally pu-illainimous!" British Lords made themselves merry over
these sneering allusions to the descendants of the men whe
swept the fields of Naseby, Worcester, and Marston Moor,THE DIME SPEAKER.
But " the Americans would fight," and " the Americans
did fight," until they wrung from king, ministers, aristocracy, army, and people, from men who had met their just
demands with the arrogance and contemptuous scorn of
assured power, the fullest recognition of the indepeadence
of free aud united America!
THE SEWING MACHINE.-By A#on.
"GoT one? Don't say so! Which did you get?
One of the kind to open and shut?
Own it, or hire it? How much did you pay?
Does it go with a crank, or a treddle? Say,
I'm a single man, and somewhat green,
Tell me about your sewing machine."
Listen, my boy, and hear all about itI don't know what I could do without it;
I've own'd one now for more than a year,
And like it so well, I call it " my dear;"'Tis the cleverest thing that ever was seen,
This wonderful family sewing machine.
It's none of your angular Wheeler things,
With steel-shod beak and cast-iron wings;
Its work would bother a hundred of his,
And worth a thousand! Indeed it is;
And has a way-you needn't stareOf combing and braiding its own back hair!
Mine is not one of those stupid affairs
That stands in a corner, with what-nots and chalrs,
And makes that dismal, head-achy noise,
Which all the comfort of sewing destroys;
Vo rigid contrivance of lumber and steel,
But one with a natural spring in the heel.
Mine is one of the kind to love,
And wear a shawl and a soft kid glove;
Has the merriest eyes, and dainty foot,
And sports the charming gaiter boot,
And a boimet with feathers, and ribbons, and loops,
With any indefinite number of hoops.
26THE SEWING MACHINE.
None of your patent machines for me,
Unless dame Nature is the patentee;
I like the sort that can laugh and talk,
And take my arm for an evening walk;
That will do whatever the owner may choose,
With the slightest perceptible turn of the screws i
One that can dance, and-possibly-flirt;
And make a pudding, as well as a shirtOne that can sing without dropping a stitch,
And play the housewife, lady, or witchReady to give the sagest advice,
Or do up your collars and things so nice.
What do vou think of my machine?
Ain't it the best that ever was seen?
MTisn't a clumsy, mechlanical toy,
But flesh and blood! Ilear that, my boy?
With a turn for gossip, and household affairs,
Which ilnclude, you know, the sewing of tears.
Tut, tut-don't talk. I see it allYouineedn't keep winking so hard at the wall;
I know what -our fidgety fumblings mean,
You would like, yourself, a sewing machine!
Well, get one, then-of the same designThere were plenty left when I got mine!

THE MYSTERY OF LIFE. By Pev. Dr. Ch,apin. 1859.
I REMARK, then, that in all natural ana spiritual operations, so far as they come within the sphere of human
agency, there is a threefold element, or we may say that
there are three distinct elements-there is an element of
~Endeavor, of 3Mystery, and of Result. In other words,
there is something for man to do; there is something
beyond his knowledge and control; there is something achieved by the co-operation of these two.  For
illustration of this take any act-take one of the most
familiar acts, the moving of the fingers, or the arm.
We are conscious of our own will; we know the result;
but we can not tell why that result should follow. We
can not see the subtle connection that runs between the
willing mind and the obedient muscles. Here, now, is a
mystery, and a great mystery, involved with this most familiar performance. You may think of it again and again,
and you will find that middle term of mystery impossible
to explore-w-hy, at the first jet of your thought, there
should be a response at the end of your finger. We are
delighted with the efforts of some great musician-with the
exquisite music which he evokes from the keys of the
piano. But there is something far more wonderful, though
far more common, than the music. It is the priocess by
which that music is created, the means by which the melodies and accordances in the artist's soul are brought out
of the instrument; the way in which every little nerve and
minute fiber of the fingers obeys the artist's will, and makes
a few slips of wire and of cold ivory to throw off jets of
brilliant sound and volleys of human expression, and strike
upon chords of far and mysterious suggestion, and pour
out a stream of harmony that lifts up and floats a thousand
rouls. There, again, is the act of utterance, a condition
that exists between you and myself. I speak, and youl
hear; but how? The words issue from my lips and reach
your cars; but what are those words? Volumes of force
communicated to the atmosphere, whose elastic waves
carry them to fine recipients in your own organism. But
still, I ask, how?  How is it that these volumnes of sound
sliould convey articulate meaning, and carry ideas from
I!nv iind into your own? Man sows the seed-he reaps
the harvest-but between these two points occurs the middlo condition of mystery. lie casts the seed inlto the

the harvest is come. That is all he knows about it. Therm
is something for him to do, something for him to receive,
but, betweea the doing and receiving there is a mystery.
THE UPS AND DOWNS.-By Anon.
A cnpp once told St. Patrick's dean,
While rising from his seat, " I mean
To set up for a wit."
"Ah!' quoth the dean, " if that be true,
The very best thing you can do
Is down again to sit."
Too many, like that would-be wit,
Set up for what they are not fit
And alwavs lose their aim;
Set up for wisdom, wealth, renown,
But end the farce by sitting down,
With poverty and shame.
A middling farmer thinks he can
Set up to be a gentleman,
And then sit down content;
But after many a turn and twist,
Is set down on the pauper list,
A fool, not worth a cent.
When farmers' wives and daughters fair
Set up with silks and bonnets rare,
To look most wondrous winning,
They sit upon a slippery stand,
Till indigence, with iron hand
Upsets their underpining
Some city ladies, too, whose gear
Has made thenl to their husbands dsr,
Set up to lead the ton;
Though thlley it hliigh on fashion's seat,
Age, death, or poverty, albeit

81THE DIME SPEAKER.
Some fools set up to live by law
And though they are " all over jaw,'
Soon fail for lack of brains;
But had the boobies only just
Known where they ought to sit at first,
They'd saved a world of pains.
A quack sets up the doctor's trade,
But could he use the sexton's spade
No better than his pills,
The man might moil froml morn to night,
And find his match with all his might
To bury half he kills.
You may set up for what you choose,
As easily as wear old shoes,
If e'er so low at present;
But when you have set ulp in vain,
And find you must sit down again,
Tis terribly unpleasant.
TIIE TRULY GREATET.*--By Rev. Dr. Acdams. 1T59.
TIEi astronomner who sounds the depths of space with
his telescope, is over-whelmed, not so much by his discoveries as by the thought of the realms which are yet bevond the reach of mortal vision. The contemplation of
great men in this world may properly have the same effect
on, us with regard to intellifent spirits superior to man.
This is God's host! When w-e consider them we may vwell
say, What is man! Reason, as we possess it, which lifts
us above the brutes, shows in a certain sense our inferiority to angels; for the very necessity of reasoning, as vwe
(io, reveals that we are below those in whom processes or
thought are electrified into lightning speed, or are wholly
stlpersede(d by intuitions. Though we stand in aw-e t)efore a great man here, we should cease to do so could we
look upon the unfallen sons of God.    "Strength and
beauty are in his tabernacle."  We trace divine wisdomn

ominnipotence in that direction, how must it be toward tlle

The great niman, as we call himn, dies. WVe will suppose
him to have been a Godless man.    "Ilis breath goetih

of God gave inspiration to the first-born spirits in heaven,
whose words, comiipared with those from the most eloqluent
lips of manai, are like sunbeams on a street lamp which is
left burning after sunrise. He was a great poet; he was a
master of song; "The Creation," "The Messiah," are his.
But there was a " Creation" sung when God laid the foundations of the earth. And when he bringeth in his first
begotten inlto the world, was there not a " Jfessiah;" for,
he saith, And let all the angels of God worship hiim. Tlie
music of heaven for a period beyond our computation,
ascriptions framed bv angelic minds, the learning, the re.
nown, the beauty and majesty of those that excel in
strength, "the helmed cherubim and sworded serapliim,"
and, withal, the accomplishments conferred by divine
knowledge and moral beauty on the very humblest of the
heavenly host, make the spirit of the great man from earth
feel how poor a thing mere human greatness is, and that
nothing is truly great, in heaven, which is not-fiirst, la.t,
midst-good; that the fear of the Lord, that is wisdoml;
that to acquire the spiritual image of the Redeemer ou
earth, is the great end for which life was given. To be
"a great man" in this world is, of itself, and viewed ill
connection with endless life, no more than to be a grleater
worm. A chameleon, or bird of paradise, or peacock, or
a magnolia, or a giraffe, or cedar in Lebanon, are the peers
of "a great Iman" whio does not fear God and keep his
commandments.    "Like sheep they are laid in the grave;CONTENTS.

THE SAMIE.-Idem.
A man of genius is a proper occasion of special pwilse to
God, foZr his sovereign power and goodness. Men seldom
think of this. They worship and serve the creature more
than the Creator, who is over all, God blessed forever.
They should rather feel disposed to address great men in
these words, and for mutual admonition: " And what hast
thou that thou didst not receive? For who maketh thee
to differ from another? Now if thou didst receive it, whv
dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?" Gifts of
genius are as really the special gifts of God as the miraculous gifts which led the two Apostles at the Beautiful gate
of the Temple to say, "Ye men of Israel, why look ye so
earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness
we had made this man to walk?" A wonderful mind is
merely an uncommon efflorescence in one of a number of
parts of tI;e same species, whose structure is ordained by,he a:-w,ise God; and we are to receive the rare product
ike every creature of God, with thanksgivings. It is a
new'ii2usra:ion of that divine benevolence which even in
this world of sin and deserved misery, strives to teach us
that God is love. But we do not find it to be a common
thing for those who read the great poets and prose writers,
and look upon works of art, and listen to eloquence and
music, and reverence statesmanship, and great mfiitary
talent, and medical sagacity, and surgical skill, and the
fruits of mechanical genius, to praise and bless Him who
made heaven, earth, and seas, and the fountains of waters.
Yet the same hearts, many of them, are led to think 61
God by viewing the firmamnent.
Now, when we see the bright hosts which adorn the intellectual and moral firmament, we should give thanks to
Him that made great lights in the moral as well as the natural world. To show his power, God is pleased to adorn
34TIIE TRULY GREAT.                 g
the world of mind, now and then, with galaxies, clusters,but we say, the age produced them; the times made thlem.
Who made the age? Our times-are they not in Hlis
hand? One great man in a century might have sufilced;
but lo! that same divine wisdom and love of excellence,
which everywhere else at times rejoices to overflow all
their banks, makes one land after another the object of
affluent goodness in the bestowment of great men in comlpanlies; so that the constellations themselves are not mole
classified and marshaled than these great lights of their
respective lands and times. " Oh that men would praise the
Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the
children of men." In the realms of thought, where God,
who is a spirit, should specially be recognized and adored,
shall we set up idols? As one of the curses upon idolaters,
it is said, " Then God gave them up to worship the hosts
of heaven." It was a sublime and fascinating kind of
idolatrvy; in the intellectual world it has not ceased. Let
men turn their thoughts to God as often as they contemplate
a great nmind among their fellows. Their worship is due
to Him who made Arcturus, Orion, and the chambers of the
South; to Ilim who made great lights; for his mercy enu.
dureth forever.
THE SAME.--IJsm.
GREAT men are special gitfs of God to a nation, and through
it to the world. They are special efforts of that same divine
benevolence which gives us Apennines, and Alps, and
Lebanons, and Himalayas.  These the utilitarian and materialist will admonish us are needful parts of the world's
mech.: nism. None the less on that account, a devout miind
recognizes them as proofs of goodness in the Deity. The
mechanism of human society, for all the practical purposes
of life, might work well if there had been no IIoimer, no
Shakspeare, no Milton; but the wisdom  and goodness
which ordained that the eye and mind should not be vwearied with uniform dead levels, and therefore set up the corner-stones of the globe with a view to the benevolent effect upon the earth and its inhabitants, of hills and mountains, is pleased here and there to endow men with transcendent genius for the good of the race. They havo an eleva3*'TIlE DIME SPEAKER.
ting effect upon manklind by raising the standard of excellence; they rebuke our groveling thoughts, purify and ennoble our coInceptions, shed a charm over things which
otherwise would be tame and wearisome; they are tlio
wine of life; tlhey are angels on the ladder wit[h God Almighilty above it, filling even our dreams, as well as our
waking hours, with assurances that there is something better in reserve for all who seek it than they have reachied.
But these gifts of God, these men of genius, are capable of
perversion by us, lilie all his gifts. Occasional large crops
miay excite impatience and discontent in the young man,
tllrough his desire for a region where profuse vegetation is
the general rule. Those special seasons in which God is
pleased to turn the attention of men in great numbers to
the subject of religion, tempt some to neglect Christian effort, and to look continually after phenomenal events in
the religious world. Thus the fame of genius awakens in
some the desire to shine in the view of men, to the neglect
of slow, patient industry, as providential success in busi
ness tempts others to nmake adventures at the risk of their
regular calling and their integrity. But these abuses do
not stay the o,rdinances of heaven. In every department
of life, God bestows upon somle men celtain things which,
however cultivated and improved by effort, are, in a special
sense, iative enidowments; they are born in tlhese m1oe,
and with their features aLndi structure, are written in God's
boolk.

TRUE NATIONALITY.-Rufus Choate. 1858.
TnIz Ethics of a true nationality teach the true subordination, and the true reconciliation of apparently incompatible
duties. These only are the casuists, or the safest casuists
for us, Learn from them how to adjust this conflict between patriotism and philanthropy. To us, iudeed, there
seems to be no such conflict, for we are philanthropist,
in proportion as we are unionists. Our philanthropy we
venture to say, is a just philanthropy. That is all. It loves
all men, it helps all men, it respects all rights, keeps all
compacts, recognizes all dangers, pities all suffering, ignor;es
no fact, master and slave it enfolds alike. It happens
thus that it contracts the sphere of our duty somewhat,
and changes not the nature but the time, the place, the
mode of performing them. It does not make our love cold,T4iHL i,:ME  SPEAKZER.
but it makes it safe; it naturalizes it, it baptizes it into our
life; it circumscribes it within our capacities and our necessities; it sets on it the great national public seal. If
you say that thus our patriotism limits our philanthropy,
I answer that ours is American philanthropy. Be this the
virtue we boast, and this the name by which we know it.
In this name, in this quality, find the standard and the utterance of the virtue itself. By this, not by broad phylacteries and chief seats; the keener hate, the gloomier fanaticism, the louder cry, judge, compare, subordinate. Do
they think that nobody is a philanthropist but themselves?
We, too, look up the long vistaand gaze wrapt at the dazzling
ascent; we, too, see towers rising, crowned, imperial, alnd
the tribes coming to bend in the opening of a latter dav.
But we see peace, order, reconciliation of rights along that
brightening future. WVe trace all along that succession of
reform, the presiding instrumentalities of national life.
We see our morality working itself clearer and clearer;
one historical and conventional right or wrong, after another, falling peacefully and still; we hear the chain breakiniig, but there is nlo blood on it, none of his whoim it bound,
none of his who pult it on him; we hear the swelling chorus
of the free, but master and slave unite in that chorus and
there is no disordant shriek above the harmony; we see
and we hail the blending of our own glory with the eternal
light of God, but we see, too, shapes of love and beauty
ascending arnd descending there as in the old vision!
Hold fast this hope; distrust the philanthropy, distrust
the ethics which would, which must, turn it into shame. Do
no evil that evil may come. Perform your share, for you
have a share, in the abolition of slavery; perform your
share, for you have a share, in the noble and generous
strife of the se.ctions-but perform it by keeping, by transmitting, a united, lovinig and Christian America.
But why, at last, do I exhort, and why do I seem to fear,
on such a day as this? Is it not the nation's birthday?
Is it not this country of our love and hopes, which ceiebrates it? This music of the glad march, these banners of
pride and beauty, these iimemlories so fragrant, these resolutions of patriotism, so thloughtful, these hands pressed,
these congratulations and huzzaings and tears, this great
heart throbbing audibly,-are they not hers, and do they
not assure us? These forests of ruasts, these singing
42workshops of labor, these fields and plantations whitening
for the harvest, this peace alnd plenty, this sleeping thunder,
these bolts in the closed, strong talon, do not they tell us
of her health, her strength, and her future?  This shadow
that flits across our grasses and is gone, this shallow ripple
that darkens the surtace of our broad and widening stream,
and passes away, this little perturbation which our telescopes can not find, and which our science caa hardlv find,
but which we know can not change the course or hasten tlhe
doom of one star; have these any terror for us? And he
who slumbers not, nor sleeps, who keeps watchfully the
city of his love, on whose will the life of nations is suspended, and to whom all the shields of the earth belong, our
father's God, is he not our God, and of whom, then, and
of what shall we be afraid?"
OUR NATAL DAY.-Idem.
It is well thait in our year, so busy, so secular, so discordant, there comes one day when the word is, and when
the emotion is, "our country, our whole country, and
nothing but our country." It is well that law-our only
sovereign on earth-duty, not less the daughter of God,
not less within her sphere supreme-custom not old alone,
but honored and useful-memories, our hearts, have set a
time in which--scythe, loom, and anvil stilled, shops shut,
wharves silent, the flag-our flag unrent-the flag of our
glory and commemoration-waving on mast-head, steeple,
and highland, we may come together and walk hand in
hand, thoughtful, admiring, through these galleries of civil
greatness; when we may own together the spell of one
hour of our history upon us all; when faults may be forgotten, kindnesses revived, virtues remembered and
aketched unblamed; when the arrogance of reform, the excesses of reform, the strifes of parties, the rivalries of regions, shall give place to a wider, warmer, and juster sentiment; when turning from the corners and dark places of
offensiveness, if such the candle lighted by malignity or
envy, or censoriousness, or truth has revealed anywhere;
when turning from these, we may go up to the serene and
secret mountain-top, and there pause, and there unite ih
the reverent exclamation, and in the exultant prayer,

INTELLIGENCE THE TRUE BASIS OF LIBERTY.--IZd.
lIow well said Washington-who said all things, as he
did all things, well--" that in proportion as governments
rest on public opinion, that opinion must be enlightened."
There must then be intelligence at the foundation. But
what intelligence? Not that which puffeth up, I fancy,
not flipp;Lncy, not smartness, not sciolisin, whose fruits,
whose expression, are vanity, restlessness, insubordination,
hate, irreverence, unbelief, incapacity to combine ideas,
and great capacity to overwork a single one. Not quite
this. This is that little intelligence and little learning
which are dangerous. These are the characteristics, I
have read, which pave the way for the downfall of States;
not those on which a long glory and a long strength have
towered. These, more than the General of Macedon, gave
the poison to Deimosthenes in the Island Temlple. These,
not the triulnvirate alone, closed the eloquent lips of Cicero.
These, before the populous North had done it, spread beneath Gibraltar tc the Lybian sands in the downward ag e;
these, not Christianity, not Goth, not Lombard, nor Norman, rent that fair one, Italy, asunder, and turned the garden and the mistress of the earth into a school, inlto a
hiding place of assassins--of spies from Austria, of spies
from France, with gold to buy and ears to catch and punish the dreams of liberty whispered in sleep, and shaimed
the memories and hopes of Machiavel and Mazzini, and
gave for that joy and that beauty, mourning and heaviness. This is not the intelligence our Constitution means,
Washington meant, our country needs. It is intelligence
which, however it begins. ends with belief, with humilitv,
with obedience, with 7enieration, with admiration, with
truth; which recognizes and then learns anld then teaches
the duties of a comprehensive citizenship; which hopes
for a future on earth and beyond earth, but turns habitually, reverently, thoughtfully to the old paths, the great mewm
41the hallowed graves of thle fathers; which binds in one
bundle of love the kindred and mighty legend of revolution
and liberty, the life of Christ in the Evangelists, and the
Constitution in its plain text; which canl read with Lord
Chatham, Thucedides anid the stories of master states of
antiquity; yet holds with him that the papers of the Congress of 1776 wvere better; whose patriotism grows warnm,
At Marathon, but warnler at Monmouth, at Yorlitown, at
Bunker Hill, at Saratoga; which reforms by preserving,
serves by standing anid waiting, fears God and honors
America.

And the cry of despair,
As they fall, goes to God

AFTER THE BATTLE.--From Chambers' Journal. 1559.
Tnzr drums are all muffled; the bugles are still;
There's a pause in the valley-a halt on the hill;
AnTd the bearers of standards swerve back with a thrill
Where the sheaves of the dead bar the way;
For a great field is reap'd, heaven's garners to fill,
And stern Death holds his harvest to-day.
There's a voice on the winds lilke a spirit's low cr--'Tis the muster-roll sounding-and w-ho shall reply?
Not those whose wan faces glare w-hite to the sky,
With eves fixed so steadfast and dimly,
As they waitatt last trump which they may not defy,
Whose hands clutch the sword-hilt so grimly.

Shall darken with sorrow the land where they flow
To the eyes of her desolate daughters.
They are fled-they are gone; but oh! not as they came,
In the pride of those numbers they staked on the garle,

Like the giants of Gaza, their strength it was shorn
Ere thbse mists had roll'd up to the sky:
From the flash of our steel a new day-break seem'd born
As we sprang up-to conquer or die.

And the heroes of battle are slumbering their last,
Do ye dream of yon pale form that rode on the blast?
Would ye free it once more, O ye brave?

THIE GLASS RAILROAD.-By George Lippard.
[Thlis fine piece ii to be recited as if the speaker wvere simply telling
his dreaml to a circle of fiiends, with no effort, or oratorical display.]
IT seemed to Ime as though I llad been suddenly aroused
front my slumber. I looked around and found my^self in
the center of a gay crowd. The first sensation I expe'rienced
was that of being borne along, with a peculiar motion.  I
looked around and found that I was in a long train of cars
which were gliding over a railway, and seemed to be many
miles in length. It was composed of many cars. Every
car, open at the top, was filled with men and women, ail
gavly dressed, and happy, and all laughing, talking, and
uinging.  The peculiarly gentle motion of the cars interest.
ed me. There was no grating such as *se usually hear on the
soTIIE GLASS RAILROAD                   01
railroad. They moved along without the least jar or so,ind.
Tais, I say, interested me. I looked over the side, and to
my astonishment found the railroad and cars made of
glass. The glass wheels moved over the glass rails without
the least noise or oscillation. The soft gliding motion produced a feeling of exquisite happiness. I was happy  It
seemed as every thing was at rest within-I was full of
peace.
While I was wondering over this circumstance, a new
sirght attracted my gaze. All along the road on either side,
within a foot of the track, were laid long lines of coffins
on either side of the railroad, and every one contained a
corpse dressed for burial, with its cold white face turned
upward to the light. The sight filled me with horror; I
yelled in agony, but could make no sound. The gay
throng who were around me only redoubled their singing
and laughter at the sight of my agony, and we swept on,
gliding on with glass wheels over the railroad, every moment coming nearer to the bend of the road, which formed
an angle with the road far, far in the distance.
"Who are those?" I cried at last, pointing to the dead
in the coffins.
"These are the persons who made the trip before us,"
was the reply of one of the gayest persons near me.
"What trip?" I asked.
"Why, the trip you are now making; the trip on this
glass railway," was the answer.
"Why do they lie along the road, each one in his coffin?" I was answered with a whisper and a half laugh whlich
froze my blood:
" They were dashed to death at the end of the railroad,"
said the person whom I addressed.
"You know the railroad terminates at an abyss which
is without bottom or measure. It is lined with pointed
rocks. As each car arrives at the end It precipitates its
passengers into the abyss.  They are dashed to pieces
against the rocks, and their bodies are brought here and
placed in the coffiins as a warning to other passengers; but
no one minds it, we are so happy on the glass railroad."
I can never describe the horror with which those words
inspired me.
"What is the name of the glass railroad?" I asked.
The person whom I asked, replied in the same strain:52               TIIE DIME SPEAKER.
"It is very easy to get into the cars, but very hard to
get out. For, once in these, everybody is delighted with
the soft, gliding motion.  The cars move gently.  Yes, thic
is a railroad of habit, and with glass wheels we are whirled
over a glass railroad towards a fathomless abyss. In a
few moments we'll be there, and they'll bring our bodies
and put them in coffins as a warning to others; but nobody
will mind it, will they?"
I was choked with horror. I struggled to breathemade firantic efforts to leap from the cars, and in the struggle I awoke.  I know it was only a dream, and yet whelnever Ithink of it, I can see that long tirain of cars moving,gentlv over the glass railroad. I can see cars far ahead,
is they are turning the bend of the road.  I can see tho
dead in their coffins, clear and distinct on either side of the
road; while the laiughing and singing of the gay and happy
passengers resound in mny ears, I only see the cold faces of
the dead, with their glassy eyes uplifted, and their frozen
hands upon their shrouds.
It was, indeed, a horrible dream. A long train of
glass cars, gliding over a glass railway, freighted with youth,
beauty, and muisic, while on either hand are stretched tlle
victims of vesterdav-gliding over the railway of habit
toward the fathomless abyss.
"There was a moral in that dream."
"Reader, are you addicted to any sinful habit? Break
it off cre you dash against the rocks."
THE CASE OF MR. MACBETI.-By F. 4. D.
IN Macbeth, Shakspeare seems to have desigfned a dis.
play of the disadvantages of being henpecked; for Mrs.
MZiacbeth, though a Scotchwoman, is also a Tartar.  Sho
was the oliginal Mrs. Caudle, and her curtain lectures
changed her husband from a qtiiet performer on the Scottish violin and an ardent lover of rappee, to an ambitious
seeker after royaltv. As there is a long step between his
original positioni and that of the monarch of Scotland, lie
determines to succeed ini hisi, or rather in his wific's object,
by imnitating the Catlholic Priests, and curtting off all the
hairs (heirs) to the Crown. Hence he receives Duncan intoTIlE CASE OF MR. MACBETH.
his castle with the cheerful politeness manifested by the
spider to the fly;
"'Won't you walk into my parlor i'
Said the spider to the fly."
Duncan goes o bed. M5acboth, in what we alwars supposed to be an access of delirium tremens, sees double,
-that is, he sees a dagger in the air and another in his
own hald. IIe walks into his guest's room, the door of
which the latter has forgotten to lock, without stumbling
over his boots in the eintr, and giving him his quietus,
walks out again as if he had pertformed rather a meritorious action. ANWhen the deed is discovered, he lynches a
couple of servants whom lie charges with the crime. MWe
forgot to mention that his success had been predicted to
hini by three old maiden ladies who met him and told his
fortune on what Shakspeare, iwith the reprehensible coarseness of his period, calls a " blasted heath," Macbeth giving
them half a crow-n to insure him a whole one. By force of
habit as well as principle, he next has his friend Banquo
killed-but the latter gentleman amuses himself by rising
fromn the grave and reappearing to Macbeth at the suppertable, w-ith all sorts of unpleasant faces, making himself as
disagreeable as possible, until he disappears under the
stage by means of a trap-door, to wash off the red-ochre
and bury his cares and cotintenance in a pot of porter.
After coming a variety of natiuhty games, and rendering
himself liable to numerous indictments, this "fine old
Scottish gentleman" is driven into a corner by one Mr.
Macduff, a very spunky and wrathy individual, w-ho does
not think the usurper a Ilice man, and declares the means
by which he obtained the gilt-paper coronet that is stuck
on the top of his black wig, " very tolerable and not to
be endured."  To be sure, Macduff is rather prejudiced
against the other Mac, from the fact that the latter has
cllosen to while awav a tedious half hotir by putting, Mrs.
Macduff, and all the little Masters and Misses Macduff' "out
ef their misery;" consequently he flares up and fires away
and bestows many opprobrious epithets upon Mr. Macbeth,
calling him, among other things, a "hell-kite," and using
other expressions unbecoming a gentleman and a scholar.
The upshot of it is, that the two Mr. Me's have a pitched
battle. Some commentators have supposed that previous
to this fight Macbeth had become reduced in his circuln53INTRODUCTORY.
THE great number of " Speakers," "Orators," " Do,

scholar will not object to the introduction of a dime book,
that shall challenge comparison of merit with my offered
at a much greater sum.
This collection embraces specimens of the vplendid
oratory of the late lamented Rufus Choate, of Ilenry Wilson, George Sumner, Dr. Adams, Kossuth, Edward
Everett, Reverends Stowell Brown, Henry WVard Beecher,
and Dr. Chapin, &amp;c., &amp;c. The poemis embrace some of the
finest and most impressive productions of Pierpont, Percival, Poe, Tennyson, Howitt, &amp;c., &amp;c., and a number of
anonymous contributions of singular beauty. In humor,

stances and sought employment as an hostler, from the fact
that he talks about "dying with harness on his back;"but as we have discovered that harness and armor are
synonymous, we have come to the conclusion that he
might more properly be termed a mail-car4ier. Macbeth
lhad relied upon getting the best of it, because the three
maiden ladies above referred to assured him that
" No man of womalU born
Could harm Macbeth."
But Macduff being a self-made man, succeeds in flooring
his ferocious adversary. What became of the bod--

frienlds of the deceased (if he had any-we are inclined to
infer that he had not, from  Macduff's "hitting him"),

very little importance; and the moral the drama teaches,
is the dalnger of. one's permitting his better-half to wear

THE PROFESSOR ON PHIRENOLOGY.*--y Dr ~oltrns.
I SHALL begin, my friends, with the definition of a Pseudoscience. A Pseudo-science consists of a nomenclature,
with a self-adjusting arrangement, by which all positive
evidence, or such as favors its doctrines, is admitted; and
all negative evidence, or such as tells against it, is excluded. It is invariably connected with some lucrative
practical application. Its professors and practitioners are
usually shrewd people; they are very serious with the public, but wink and laugh a good deal among themselves.
ht'i believing multitude consists of women of both sexes,
feeble-minded inquirers, poetical optimists, people who always get cheated in buying horses, philanthropists who ineist on hurrying up the millennium, and others of this
class, with here and there a clergyman, less frequently a
lawyer, very rarely a physician, and almost never a horsejockey or a member of the detective police. I did not
say that Phrenology was one of the Pseudo-sciences.
A Pseudo-science does not necessarily consist wholly of

lies. It mav contain many truths, and even valuable ones.
The rottenest bank starts with a little specie. It puts out
a thousand promises to pay on the strength of a single dollar, but the dollar is very commonly a good one. The
practitioners of the Pseudo-sciences know that common
minds, after they have been baited with a real fact or two,
will jump at the merest rag of a lie, or even at the bare
hook. When we have one fact found us, we are very apt
to supply the next out of our own imagination. (IIow
many persons can read Judges xv. 16, correctly the first
time?) The Pseudo-sciences take advantage of this. I
did not say that it was so with Phrenology.
I have rarely met a sensible man who would not allow
that there was something in Phrenologv. A broad, high
forehead, it is commonly agreed, promises intellect; one
that is " villainous low" and has a huge hind head back of
it, is wi-ont to nmark an animal nature. I llave as rarely
met an unbiased and sensible man who really believed in
the bumps. It is observed, however, that persons with
what the Phrenologists call "good heads" are more prone
than others toward plenary belief in the doctrine.
It is so hard to prove a negative, that, if a man should
assert that the moon was in truth a green cheese, formed
by the coagulable substance of the 3Milky Way, and challenge me to prove the contrary, I might be puzzled. But
if he offer to sell Ine a ton of this lunar cheese, I call on
him to pro-e tlih tiruth of the caseous nature of our satellite, before I purchase.
It is not necessary to prove the falsity of the phrenological statement. It is only necessary to show that its
truth is not proved, and can not be, by the common course
of argument. The walls of the head are double, with a
great air-chamber between them, over the smallest and
most closely crowded "organs."  Can you tell how much
money there is in a safe, which also has thick double walls,
by kneading its knobs with your fingers? So when a man
fumbles about my forehel(ad, and talks about the organls of
Individuality, Size, etc., I trust him as much as I should if
he felt of the outside of my strong-box and told me that
there was a five-dollar, or a ten-dollar bill under this or
that particular rivet. Perhaps there is; only he doesn't
know any thing about it. But this is a point that I, the
Professor, understand, my friends, or ought to, certainly,
5

better than you do. The next argument you will all appreciate.
I proceed, therefore, toexplain, the self-adjusting mechanisin of Phrenology, which is very similar to that of the
Pseudo-sciences. An example will show it most conveniently.
A. is a notorious thief. Messrs. Bumpus and Crane examine him and find a good-sized organ of Acquisitiveniess.
Positive fact for Phrenology. Casts and drawings of A.
are multiplied, and the bump does not lose in the act of
copying. I did not say it gained. What do you look so
for? (to the audience).
Presently B. turns up, a bigger thief than A. But B.
has no bump at all over Acquisitiveness. Negative fact;
goes against Phrenology. Not a bit of it. Don't you see
how small Conscientiousness is? That's the reason B.
stole.
And then comes C., ten times as much a thief as either
A. or B.,-used to steal before he was weaned, and would
pick one of his own pockets and put its contents in another,
if he could find no other way of committing petty larceny.
Unfortunately, C. has a hollow, instead of a bump, over
Acquisitiveness. Ah, but just look and see what a bump
of Alimentiveness! Did not C. buy nuts and gingerbread,
when a boy, with the money he stole?  Of course you see
why he is a thief, and how his example confirms our noble
science.
At last comes along a case which is apparently a settler,
for there is a little brain with vast and varied powers,-a
case like that of Byron, for instance. Then comes out the
grand reserve-reason whieh covers everything and renders
it simply impossible ever to corner a Phrenologist. "It is
not the size alone, but the quality of an organ, which determines its degree of power."
Oh! oh! I see. The argument may be briefly stated
thus by the Phrenologist. "lIeads I win, tails you lose."
Well, that's convenient.
It must be confessed that Phrenology has a certain re,
semblance to the Pseudo-sciences. I did not say it was a
Pseudo-science.
I have often met persons who have been altogether
struck up and amazed at the accuracy with which some
wandering Professor of Phrenlology had read tlleir charac56THi PROFESSOR ON PHRENOLOGY.

acquires his information solely through his cranial inspections and manipulations. What are you laughing at? (to

thing about Phrenology, should open a shop and under.

lar apiece. Let us see how well he could get along without the " organs."
I will suppose myself to set up such a shop. I would
invest one hundred dollars, more or less, in casts of brains,
skulls, charts, and other matters that would make the most
show for the money. That would do to begin with. I
would then advertise myself as the celebrated Professor
Brainev, or whatever name I might choose, and wait for
my first customer. My first customer is a middle-aged
man. I look at him,-ask him a qnestion or two so as to
hear him talk. When I have got the hang of him, I ask
him to sit down, and proceed to fumble his skull, dictating
as follows:

And so of the other faculties.
Of course, you know, that isn't the way the Phrenologists do. They go only by the bumps. What do you
keep laughing so for? (to the audience). I only said that
is the way Ishould practice " Phrenology" for a living.

ANNABEL LEE.-By Edgar A.. Pob
IT was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That maiden there lived whom you may know,
By the name of Annabel Lee.
And this maiden she tived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child,
In a kingdom by the sea;
But we loved with a love that was more than love,
I and my Annabel Lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her high-born kinsman came,
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulcher,
In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
Were envying her and me,
Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea),
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than weOf man far wiser than we;
And neither the angels in heaven above
Nor the demon down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul fromI the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
For the moon never beams without bringing dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyesWASU[INGTON S NAMNB.

And so all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling--my darling-my life and my bride,
In her sepulcher there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea.
WASHINGTON'S NA3IE.-By James G. Percival.
AT the heart of our country the tyrant was leaping,
To dve there the point of his dagger in gore,
When Washington sprang from the watch he was
keeping,
And drove back that tyrant irfthame from our shore:
The cloud that hung o'er us then parted and roll'd
Its wreaths far away, deeply tinctured with flame;
And high on its fold
Was a legend that told
The brightness that circled our Washington's name.
Long years have roll'd on, and the sun still has
brighten'd
Our mountains and fields with its ruddiest glow;
nd the bolt that he wielded so proudly, has lightea'1,
With a flash as intense, in the face of the foe:
On the land and the sea, the wide banner has roli'd
O'er many a chief, on his passage to fame;
And still on its fold
Shine in letters of gold
The glory and worth of our Washington's name.
And so it shall be, while Eternity tarries,
And pauses to tread in the footsteps of Time;
The bird of the tempest, whose quick pinion carriQs
Our arrows of vengeance, shall hover sublime:
Wherever that flag on the wind shall be roll'd,
All hearts shall be kindled with anger and shame,
If e'er they are told
They are careless and cold,
In the glory that circles our Washington's name.

great statesman. Had I lived in the days of HIannibal, I
should have beaten that great chieftain in crossing tile
Alps; and it is a dead certain thing, that I could have distanced Cortez in crossing the Isthmus. He never performed the feats I have did; he never came up the
Chagres River in a canoe, with a deaf and dumb "hombre,"
without a red cent, or change of summer apparel. " But

In ice-water with a juvenile pick-axe and an incipient crowbar, laboring under a sun of one hundred degrees in the

prefer an office, one that is lucrative and not laborious;
what you call a sinecure. And if I can not get one my!self,
I will go in for aay man who will divide on the dead level

PENNY WISE AND POUND FOOLISII.--By Ier. Siotcell
-Brown, of Liveipool.
TEIR " penny wise and pound foolish" principle is often
illustrated by the system onI whichl nmany pIeople act in almost all their purchtases. The rage for cheap things seelMs
to be the order of the day. Under the shelter of tlhis
word " cheap," the vilest trash, in food, inl drink, in clotiling, in furniture, in implements, is sold in enorinous quantities. Perhaps there is not a more delusive word in ourt
language, for, geinerally speaking, the cheapness of a, ai'ticle is the result of deterioration; in proportion to i:s
cheapness, is its nastiness, its worthlessness.  N-11;,t VoU
buy dirt cheap, usually is dirt. I have heard of a ge!il;(man who weniit into a great clothing establishment in I,;iidon, and bought himself a suit, at a remarkably low fiiure.
Ile was delighted with his purcliase, and next mornilg saillied forth for his office in tlle city, dressed in his new' toggery, and pleased to observe lhowy well it fitted him, aiid
how becoming it was in all respects; blut he had not p:moceeded far, when filrst one seain and then aniotlier gave
way; in a few minutes he was in rags, and was colllI)ellcd
to take refuge in a cab, and be driven back in confusion
to his lodgings, convinced that he for onie had been " penny wise and pound foolish.' In one vway or aiiother, I
dare say we have all of us made a discovery of tllhe foll
which prompts people to patronize the dirt-cheap svsteil.
It is always the most expeilsive in the long run-for a good
article will always command a good price; and that which
is very low in figure, proclaims itself low in quality as
well; and many of the things that are paraded befoire tlhe
gaping public as extraordinarily cheap, would really be
very dear at any price. I often see advertisemuents headed
"Great B.argains!"  Whalt ain I to make of such an announcemrent? ior a bargain may be good or bad. Our

one declares that his is the best and cheapest house in the
trade, that his stock is unrivaled in the world, that he is
selliing off to make alterations in the premises, and that
such an opportunity seldom presents itself, &amp;c., it may be
well to reinember our old proverb, lest, enticed and tempted by such promises, and by the fine appearance which,
by various artful dodges, is given to every vile piece of
trumpery, and especially to the vilest, we should discover,
when too late, that we have been "penny wise and pound
foolish."
TRUE CLEANLINESS.-IidJ.
BUT I have said that cleanliness is a word which bears
a moral, as well as a physical signification; and it is its
moral signification chiefly that brings cleanliness up to its
hoiiorable proximity to godliness. One can scarcely walk
far inll the streets without perceiving that there are not
only maIny dirty faces, but also many dirty tongues; how
many there are whose " mouths are full of cursing and bitterness, and under whose lips is the poison of asps." Dirt
neets the eye, dirt meets the nose, and the very foulest
dirt meets the ear. It is bad enough when a violent provocation calls forth a bnrst of angry profanity, but infin-ktelv wor se when blasphemy and filth are uttered in cold
blood, aind constitute the ordinary forms of speech. T'
other sins a man may be incited by temptationI, but I do
not see what can tempt a iman to garnish his speech with
the offal and filth of language; yet it is very conlmmon, and
commlon aniong men, young meni, who prlide thenmselves on
being neat, on being well dressed, who would be ashamed
of a dirty face, who brush their hats and their coats, and
are particular even about the cleanliness of their boots;
thev take a pride in being nice in their personal appeartnce-an equal pride in being as nasty as possible in their
jneech; thus illustrating Swift's rather severe remark"A nice man is a man ot nasty ideas."  My friends, will
tou set yourselves resolutely against this abomination?
You knoN- better than I how prevalent it is, and what a
dirtv tone conversation often assumes when youIng men

67T-E DIME SPEAKER.
he made it a rule that every man guilty of profane language
should be instantly dismissed by the clerk of the works.
I do not appeal to employers in this matter, but to the men
themselves; you know that such language is utterly detestable, and I do not speak merely of protfane expressions,
but of dirty expressions, which are still more comnion.
Do you wish to be regarded, not as fools, but as men of
common-sense?-then give them up. Do you wislh to be
considered, not blackguards, but gentlemen?-then give
them up. Do you wish to have credit, not for a vicious,
but for a highly moral tone of feeling?-then give theni
up and discourage such language in every possible way.
Don't on any occasion allow it to be addressed to you;
consider yourself insulted when any foul-mouthed fool
speaks to you in this the devil's language. If you have
ally right moral sense, to say nothing of religious principle,
such language will be offensive and disgusting; set a good
example yourselves; let the words of your lips be pure
words, and advocate among your companions the total
abolition of all nasty speecll; try to purify the circles in

SATURDAY NIGHT'S ENJOYMENTS.-Ibid.
MY dear young friends, there is something for us to do
In our leisure, wiser, manlier, nobler, in all-espects better,
than to amuse ourselves, and engage in the preposterous
and dreadful work of killing time. There is something
weak, something effeminate, something contemptible, ill
this excessive love of pleasure, though the pleasure loved
be neither expensive nor immoral. If, evening after evening, you crave after the excitements of public amusemeInts
it is very evident that your intellectual and moral nature is
in a deplorable state of weakness and disease. How are
you to becomne intelligent as men of business, how are you
to become wise as citizens of a great and free nation, lhow
is your religious life to be developed, if those golden Ihours

of leisure are to be frittered away in amusements? It is
not a sufficient apology to say that your recreations are
harmless, that there is nothing in them that can shock the
Imost fastidious virtue or offend the most earnest piety.
These amusements do not fulfill the purpose of your life.
When w-e become men, we should put away childish
things, aId bend our energies to earliest pursuits. Let
Satutrday evening, tllerefore, be sometimes spent inl harmless pleasurle, but not alwaNys. Set before yourselves some
hiiiher o1ject than this, and let Saturday evenling be
ofttener devoted to the acquisition of substantial and profit.able knowledge, and the exercise of your mental powers.
Jtead, but do not read solely for amusement, as so many
do; read that y-ou may becomne wiser, abler, better men.
And theire is ainother reason why the Saturday night shlould
niot hle given solely to pleasure, however iniiocent, and it
is tllis, that the Saturday night precedes that day wvhich
ought to be especially consecrated to the service of the
Supreme Being.   In some reflection upon this, and preparation for this, the Saturday evening will be miost rationally and profitably spent. The skeptic may sneer at that
exquisite poem, one of the best that Burns ever wroteThle Cotter's Saturday Night," in which the father of a
fanlily is represented as turning over " the big ha' Bibl,"
anid reading to his assemliled family
" Iow guiltless blood for guilty man was shed,
Ilow he whlo bore in heaven the Second namie.
Itad not on earth wlhereon to lay his head.
Then kneeling dlown, to IIeaven's Eternal King,
The saint, tlle fiather, aind the husband prays:
IIope springs.extlting on triumphant wing,
That thus thev all shtall imeet in future days;
There ever baslk in uncreated rays,
No more to sigh or slhed the bitter tear;
Together singing their Creator's praise,
Tn such society, but still more dear,
Wlhile circling Time moves round in an eternal sphere."

" IN A JUST CA^tUSE."--Louis ossuth.
To prove that Washington never attached to hlis doctrine
of neutrality more than the sense of temporary policy, I refer
to one of his letters, written to Lalhyette, wherein lihe
says: -" Let us only lhave twenty vears of peace, and our
country will come to stch a degree of power and wealth
that we wvill be able, iu a just cause, to defy whlatever
power on earth."
"In a just cause i"  Now in the name of eternal truth,
and by all that is sacred and dear to Inai, since the hlistory
of mankind is recorded, there has been no cause more just
than the cause of Ilungary!  -Never was there a people,
without the slightest reason, more sacrilegiously,  lmore
treacherously, and by fouler means, attacked thain HIungary! Never have crime, cursed amlbition, despotism, and
violence, in a more wicked manner, united to crush down
freedonm, and the verv life, than against Iungary! Never
was a country more mortally outraged than ulngary.
All your sufferings, all your complaints, Awhich, witll so
much right, drove your forefathers to take up arms, are
but slight grievances, compared with those immense, deep
wounds, out of which the heart of Iungary bleeds!  If
the cause of my people is not sufficiently just to insure the
protection of God, and the support of good-willing Lmen,
then there is no just cause, and no justice on earth; thenl
the blood of no new Abel will move towards Heaven; the
genius of charity, Christian love and justice, will imourningly fly the earthl; a heavvy curse will upon Iimortality fall,
oppressed men despair, and only the Cains of huiimaniity
walk proudly, with impious brow, above the ruins of Lil;.
erty on Earth!
Y\ou have attained that degree of strength and consistency, when your less fortunate brethren of mankind may
well claim your brotherly, protecting hand. And here I
stand before you, to plead the cause of these, your less
fortunate brethren-the cause of humanity. I may succeed, or I may fail. But I will go on, pleading with that
fa.ith of martyrs by which mountains were moved; and I
may displease you, perhaps; still I will say, w-ith Luther,;'iMay God help me-I can do no otherwise!"  Woe, a thousandfold woe, to humaniiity, shlould there l,e nobody on earth

should even those who are as mighty as they are free not
feel interested in the maintenance of the laws of mankind,
because they are laws, but only in so far as some scantv
moiney interests would desire it!  Woe to humrnanity, if
every despot of the world may dare trample down the laws
of humanity, and no free Nation arise to make respected
these laws!  People of thle United States, humanity expects that your glorious Republic will prove to the world
that Republics are formlled on virtue. It expects to see

Half roasted, lihalf toiasted, and nearly quite dead,

And( I said to myselt; " There's a mouse in the trap!'
So I jump'd up and lighted my small clihamber lamp,
An-d quicklyv discover'd the precious young scampl).
I held up the box, and a pair of brighlt eyes
Look'd hard in mv face with a midnight surprise,
=And a brief little tail was coil'd up thlere so siing,
I tlloughllt that the mouse was a collllon-sized btuig.
There sat the young sinner, exceedingly slimn,
lie wondering at me, and I wondering at himni
"And don't you consider yourself a great rogue?"
I said, imnitating the mouse-people's blroguie.
"And very great villain, not honest at all?"
Said the mouse with a whine, " I'm exceedingly small!
Just look at imy figure, exaimine my fice,
I am young, my dear sir, to be caught in this case,
And if you'll but let me get out of this'fix,'
With the best of good mlice, sir, in future I'll mix."
"Not so," I replied, " you hlave troublled me sore

You've eaten away all the ends of my toes,
And if on my cheese, sir, unharm'd von should sup,
You'd grow to a giant, and then eat mze up.
The mouse gave a sigh, as I took up the box,
But he felt like a culprit just put in the sockls  
Thlen I went to the window and look'd on the niight,ThIe heat was terrific, the stars were all bright;
I loolk'd down the court and espied a tall cat,

A THIANKSGIVING SERAION.-By Dr. L~ Grald.
MY FRIENDS: Tlianksgiving Day comes, by statute, once
a year; to the honest iIan it comes as frequently as the
heart of gratitude will allow, which may mean every day,
or oince in seven days, at least.
The preachers say we are a poor set of sinnzers at best;
but who believes that? I knowv that occasionally, inl
imeeting perhaps, a layman confesses that be is a poor miserahl)e sinner, but you tell that samne person the same fact,
out of doors, and he will get mad and tear round dreadfully; which proves that after all he is not a sinner. We
are all honest, good, conscientious people, my friends, no
matter what the preachers say.
Now, I propose, my friends, to state a few of the things
for us to be thlankfiul for--when we are in the mood, of
course; for when we are not inclined, who can make us
give thanks for any thing?
We should be thlankful that w-e knew more than anyb)odv else, for, are we not capable of talking and giving
lectures upon every subject ever talked of? I shoulld
like to see the male or feiimale in this audience who didn't
lknow a great deal imiore than any body hlas any idea of!
IWe should be thankful that we are all good looking.
Ain't we? Just loolk aroeind this audience, and see if You
can "spot" the person who is, in their own estimation,
not good lookiiing?  It would be a curious studv, to be
sure, to find in what particular SOM.E PEOPLE are good
looking; but its none of our personal butsiness s if a  n11;

--comparatively, he is good-looking; that is, thelre are.
lhomelier men and animals than he; so everybody is
good lookingi, and has a right to pnt on airs. Let us be
very thankful, my friends, that this is so, for otherwvise

THE UNFINISIiED PROBLEMS OF THE UNIVERSE.
-By Prof. Mlitchell. 1859.
IF we take the telescope and look out upon the universe
by which we are surrounded, we find thema diversified in
every possible way. Our own mighty Stellar System takes
upon itself the form of a flat disk, which may be conipared
to a mighty ring breaking out into two branches, severed
from each other, the interior with stars less densely popuious than upon the exterior. But take the telescope and
go beyond this; and here you find, coming ott froi thb
78UNFINISIIED PRtOBLEAS[ OF TIIR l'U-NIEItI   79
depths of space, universes of every possible shape and
fashion, some of them  assuming a globular form-and
when we apply the highest possible penetrating power of
the telescope-breaking into ten thousand brilliant stars,
all crushed and condensed into one luminous, bright, and
magnificent center. But look yet further. Away yonder,
in the distance, you behold a faint, hazy, nebulous ring of
light, the interior almnost entirely dark, but the exterior
ring shaped and exllibiting to the eye, under the most
powerful telescope, the fact that it may be resolved entirely into stars, piroducing a universe somewhat analogous
to the one we inhliabit. Go yet deeper into space, and
there vou will beliold another universe-voluminous scrolls
of light, glittering with beauty, flashing with splendor, and
sweepiIng a curve of imost extraordinary form and of most
tromenldous ouitlines. What is the meaning of all this??Nothingr but the diversity with which the Almighty Architect has chosen to mark the superstructure by wlich we
are surrounded. So that we may anticipate all the diver.
sity that exists here on the earth and in the heavens beyond us in the systeIm with which we are allied.
TIIIE SAME.
I do not pretend to indorse the theory of Maedler with
reference to his central sun. If I did indorse it, it would
amount simply to nothing at all, for he needs no indorsement of mine. But it is one of the great, unfinished
problems of the universe which remains yet to be solved.
Future generations are to take it up. Materials for its solution are to accumulate from generation to generation.
and possibly from century to century. Nay, I know not
but thousands of years will roll away before the slow
mnovements of these far-distant orbs shall so accumulato as
to give us the data whereby the resolution may be absolutely accomplished. But shlall we fail to work because
the end is far off?  IIad the old astronomer that onice
stood upon the watch-tower in Babylon, and there nmarked
the coning of the dreaded eclipse, said:' I care not for
this- this is the business of posterity; let posterity tal;e
care of itself; I will make no record;" and had, hi succeediilg ages, the sentinel in the watch-tower of the skice80
TIHE DIMJ[E SPEAKEIt
said, "I will tetire from my post; I hare no concern
with these matters, which can do me no good; it is nothing
that I can do for the age in which I live"-where would
we have been to-night! Slhall we not do for those wiio
are to follow us whlat has been done for us by our predecessors? Let us inot shrink from the responsibility which
comes down upon the age in which we live. The great
and mighty problem of the universe has been given to the
whole human falnily for its solution. Not by any clime,
not by any age, not by any nation, not by any individual
man or mind, however great or grand, has this wondrous
solution been accomplished, but it is the problem of
humanity; and it will last as long as hunmanity shall inhabit the globe on which we live and move.
THE SAM E.
We have passed from planet to planet, from sun to sun,
from system to system. We have reached beyond tho
limits of this mighty stellar cluster with which we are
allied. W'e have found other island universes sweeping
throulgh space. The great unfinished problem  still remnains--Whece came this universe? Have all these stars
which glitter in the heavens been shining from all eternity?
HIas our globe been rolling arouind the sun for ceaseless
ages? Whence, whence this magnificent architecture,
whose architraves rise in splendor before us in every direction? Is it all the work of chance! I answer, No. It is
not the work of chance. Who shall reveal to us the true
cosmogony of the universe by which we are surrounided!
Is it the work of an Omnipotent Architect? If so, who is
this August Being? Go with me to-night, in imagination,
and stand with old Paul, the great Apostle, upon Mars'
Hill, and there look aroiunid you as he did. Here rises
that magnificent building, the Parthenon, sacred to
Minerva, the Goddless of WVisdom. There towers her
colossal statue, rising in its majesty above the city of
which she was the guatrdian-the first object to catch the
rays of the rising, and the last to be kissed by the rays of
the setti!ng, sun. There are the temples of all the gods;
and there are the shrines of every divinity. And yet I
tell you these gods and these divinities, though created81
HONOR TO THIE DEAD.
nnder the inspiring fire of poetic fancy and Greek imaglhai
tion, never reared this stupendous Structure by which we.are surrounded. The Olvmpic Jove never built these
heavens. The wisdom of Minerva never organiiized these
magn1ificent systems. I say with St. Paul " Oh, Athenians, in all thimngs I finld von too superstitious; for, ill
passing along youir streets, I find an altar inscribecl To tlhe
Unkuown- G{od--Iim whom   ye ignorantly worslhip; anid
this is the God I declare unto you-the God that made
heaven anId earth, who dwells not in temples made with
hands."
No, here is the temple of our Divinity. Around us an(l
above us rise Sun and System, Cluster and Universe. AInd
I doubt not that in every region of this vast Empire of
God, hymns of praise and anthems of glory are rising and
reverberatiing from sun to sun, and Systeim to Systemheard by Omnipotence alone across immensity and throughll
eternity.

HONOOR TO TII DEAD.
Nor are these beautiful and noble arts, by which tlA
face and the form of the departed are preserved to usq
calling into the highest exercise as they do all the imitative and, idealizing powers of the painter and the sculptor
-the least instructive of our teachers. The portraits and
the statues of the honored dead kindle the generous ambition of the youthful aspirant to fame. Themistocles
could not sleep for the trophies in the Ceramicus; aIld
when the living Demostheles had ceased to speak, the
stony lips remained to rebuke and exhort his degenerate
countrymen. Mlore than a hundred years have elapsed
since tle great Newton passed away; but from age to age
hlis statue by Roubillac, in the ante-chapel of Trinity College, will give distinctness to the conceptions formed of
him by hundreds and thousands of ardent youthful spirits,
filled with reverence for that transcendent intellect, which,
from the phenomena that fall within our limited vision,
deduced the iniperial law by which the Sovereigrn Mind
rules the entire universe. We can never look on the person of Washington, but his serene and noble countenance
perpetuated by the pencil and the chisel, is familiar to far
greater multitudes than ever stood in his livingi presence,

84WEBSTER'S POLITICAL SYSTENI.
WVESTER'S POLITICAL SYSTEM.-By the same.
Led equally by his professional occupations and his political duties to make the Constitutionl the object of his
profoundest study and mneditation, he regarded it with peculiar reverence, as a Covenant of Union between the
members of this great and increasing fiLlnily of States;
and in that respect he considered it as the most important
document ever penned by the hand of uninspired man. I
need not tell you that this reverence for the Constitution
as the covenant of union between the States was the central idea of his political system, which, however, ill this
as in all other respects, aimed at a wise and safe balance
of extreime opinioins. He valued, as much as any man can
possibly value it, the principle of State sovereigntv.  He
looked upon the organization of these separate independent republics-of different sizes, differenit ages and
histories, different geographical positiolns and local interests-as furnishinig a security of inappreciable value for a
wise and beneficent adniinistration of local affairs, andi the
protection of individual and local rights. But he regarded
as an approach to the perfection of political wisdom, the
molding of these separate and independent sovereirnties,
with all their pride of individual right, and all their jealousy of individual consequence, into an harmonious whole.
IHe never weighed the two principles against each other;
lie held themn complemental to each other, equall-y and
supremely vital and essential.
I happened, one bright starry night, to be walking home
with him, at a late houlr, from the Capitol at Washiington,
after a skirnisling debate, in which he had been speaking,
at no great length, but with much earnestness and warmth
on the subject of the Constitution as forming a united government. The planet Jupiter, shining with unusual brilliancy, was in full view. Ile paused as we descended
Capitol Hill, aind unconsciously pursuiig tlle trainl of
thought which he had been enforcing in the Senate, pointed to the planet and said-"' Night unto nlight slhowletlh

from the hand of the Supreme, which impels that planet
onward, and it would plunge in. hideous ruin from those

I stood witlin tlle Forum, and I saw
The great triumphal temples, mlarble white,
Spring into splendor, without stain or flaw,
A world-wide wonder ancd the land's delight.
Then came the great Deliverer, and his way
WVas arched witil banners and o'erstrewn witb

And jubilant clarions proudly seemed to say,
" United Italy once mlore is ours!"
"United Italy!" I cried, and thrust
My voice amid the tumult of tlle rest,
Whlen suddenly pale Brutus from the dust
Arose, and pointed to the blushing West.
The gladness died within me, for behold,
I saw a vision on the sunset shore:
A lovely woman made by anger bold,
In maniac rage her starry mantle tore.
Sweet Peace, affrightedl at her brow of ire,
Sped wildly far, and broke her olive wand,
While Discord entered with her scourge of fire,
And flamin-g War made bare his bloody brand.
And Liberty, with sad, averted head,
Fled from her presence, weeping as she flew;
While crowned Tyranny rushed in instead,
Completing all that Discord left to do I
The trampled nations sunk and wept aloudSunk in despair with sorrow overborne;
While Europe's despots, growing strong and proud,
Laughed at the sight the direful laugh of scorn.

WOMIAN'S RIGIITS.-By Edtllard Everett.
Withl the acknowledged equality of woman in gen
er1al intellectual endowmlents, though tending in eitiel
cx to an appropriate developmnent, witli her admittedl
superiority to iman in tact, sensibility, physical and
moiral endurance, quickness of perception, and power ot
accommodation to circumstances, give her for two or
tlhree generations equal advantage of mental culture,
asid the lords of creation -will have to carry more guns
than they do at present to keep her out of the enjoyiecnt of any-thing which sound reasonin(g and fair experience will sliow to be lier rights. I have, however,
strong doubts whlether, tried by this test, the result
would be a participation in the performance of the
political duties, whllicll tlle experience of the human
race, in all ages, has nearly confined to the coarser sex.
I do not rest this ol)inion solely on the fact, that thlese
duties do not seem coni'eni:dl with the superior delicacy
of woman, or compatible -with the occupations whlich
nature assigns to her in the domestic sphere.
I think it wouldl be found, on trial, that nothing
woulcd be gainedl-nothing changed for the better--by
puttin( the sexes on the same footing, witil respect, for
instance, to the righllt of suffrage. Whether the wiv-es
and( sisters a(reed wvith the lhusbands and brothers, or
differed from  them, as this agreement or difference
would, in the long run, exist principally in all parties,
the result would be the saime as at present. So, too,
whlietlier the wife or husband hald the stroniger will, andl
so dictated the other's vote, as this also wouldl be tl,e
same on all sides, the result would not be affected. So
that it would be likely to turn out that the present arran(rement, by wlhichl the men do the electionecring
and voting, for both sexes, is a species of representation
whlichl promotes the convenience of all and does injustice to none. And then for fa;e, to wlichli, by a natural
instinct, the generous soul aspires:
"-The spur which the clear spirit doth raise
(The last infilmity of noble minds),
To scorn delights, and live laborious days."
The surest path to a rep atation for the mass of I'nan

Andl now the great question which we ha le to settle
is, shall this mighty aggregate of prosperity perish,
or s11all it endure?  Sh1all this imlperial heritage of
blessings descend unimpaired to our posterity, or shall
it be ignominiously, profligately thrown away? Shall
the territory of the Union, late so happy under the control and adjustmlent of the National and State Governments, be broken up into mlliserable fragments,
sure to l)e engagrecl in constanltly recurring border wars,
and all lying at the mercy of otreigcn powers; or shall
it preserve its noble integrity undler the xcgis of the
National Government?
Admit the rigrht of the seceding States to break up
the Union at pleasure, nay, of each and every State to
do so, and allow them to enforce that righllt by a successful war-deny the authority of the Central Government to control its members, andl hlow longf will it

and the continent become a vast theater of civil war,

at once, and settle it forever. For remember, my
friends, that, in this desolating war, the Government and
loyal people of the country are assailed, and that they
are clad in the triple armor of a just cause.
The pretense is set up by the Rebels that they are
contending for the rigllht of self-rovernment; the unfiriendlly press of Europe talks of its being a war of
revenge and subjugation. Consider what makes a just

Withered granny knitting socks sits,
And a palsied old man shakes out
His pipe's ashes on the table.

On each side the fire, stand empty;
On two tables at two bedsides
Labeled vials strewed about lie.

Side by side two graves are sodding;

B3rave, hardy lads for battle, or thle chase;
And thouglh, like peasant, barbarously clad,

Steps for their father's hlonorable years.
One night in Autumn, sat they round the fire,
In tile rudie cabin bountiful of HIome:ALONE.

Bold in the manllood unto mastery come:
Working their tasks o'er huntsman's forest gear,
Loosening the bow and shlarpening the spear.
Lost in his thou-,hts, old Sweyn, the Saxon, stood,
Leaning in silence'gainst the chimnney-stone;
Staring, unconscious, at the blazing woodl,
Steeped in the mlood of mind he oft had known;
As an ol(d tree, whose stoutest branches sllake,
Scarce froim their vigor sign of life will take.
Ethol, the bearded, with his bow had done,
Alfired, the niimble, laid his spear aside:
Edric, the fairest, tiringr of his fun,
Left the old hound to slumber on his hide;
Yet was their sire like one whose features seem
Shladed by sleep, and all their light a dream.
Bold in the ftavor of the eldest born
Atllol lor both Ihis younger brothers spoke:
Fatlier, the fox is prowling in the corn,
And hear the nigllt owl hooting( from the oak:
Let us to couch." But Sweyn had( raised his head,
And thus, uniwitting what had passed, he said:
"See, from my breast, I draw this chain of gold "Fair in the firelight royally it shone,"This for his honor that shall best unfold
Who, of all creatures, is niost Alone:
Take him fiom palace, monast'ry, or cot,
Loving, unloved, forgetting, or forgot."
Then Athol spoke, with thoughtful tone and look;
" He is the loneliest-most alone of all
Who, in a skiff, to the mid-seas forsook,
Finds not an echo, even, to his call:
If Echo lived, not all alone were he:
But there's no echo on the solemn Sea!"
And Alfred next:--" But lonelier, brother, far,
The wretch that flies a just avengingr rod:

All earth he's lost; yet knows no heaven, no God:
Most lonely he, who, making man his foe,

1394'rIIE DIME SPEAKER.
Thus spoke the lads, with wit beyond their years;
And yet the old man held his beard and sighed;
As one who gains the form his wishing wears,
But misses still a something most denied:
Upon his youngest eager looks he turned,
And Edric's cheek, with grace ingenuous burned.
" I think, my father "--and his tones were low,
"That lonelier yet, and most alone, is he,
Scarce taught, though crowds are leading, where to go
And one face missing, can no other see;
Though all the Norman's court around him moves,
lIe is alone apart from her he loves."
A hush fell on them. Then, with loving air,
And all the touching romance of the Old,
The hoary father kissed young Edric's hair,
And o'er his shoulders threw the chain of gold;
Then fell upon his darling's neck and cried,
"I have been Lonely since thy Mother died!"
THE REBELLTON OF 1861.
A rebellion is a state of society in whllich soIni of Nature's noblemen wish to detllrone a sovereign, or sit in
a presidential chair. The wish is fatller to the thought.
The idea soon follows. And then all is anarchy-all is
lost save what remains after this terrible storil of passions. The shocks of battle and the crash of arms rock
the continents, and the shrieks of the dead and dying
resound on every side. Dropping a tear for the shiveralry, let us turn from this well-drawn but terrible picture to the causes of rebellions, including the causes for
their suppression. In our Rebellion the causes are perfectly plain. The Rebellion is the effervescence of the
mysterious outcroppings of the warm love of that which
the insurgents were pursuing, even unto death, and the
determinatioi of the opposite party to see fair play, and
to demonstrate the superiority of mind over matter, especially in those things that can be done as well as
others, thereby producing the warin but not cordial
embrace of civil war, in which colliding interests vaultedTIIE REBELLION OF 1861.
to the acme and went down into the depths, where they

wishing to pull plums out of our political pies. And
still the Rebellion swept on, lifting high its lhorrid ltand
and lhurling the detonating thunder-bolts of Rebe-i(.lI
like-like-like a thunderstorm. And yet it was conducted in an honorable manner. Some old ladies advised the irregular oppositionists to steal-to steal ships,
arsenals, forts, and even thunderbolts from the storehouses of heaven, to repudiate their debts, and issue
" promises to pay;" while others urge the Government
to make peace or violently throw the Northern wing
of the country upon the Southern wing, and compel
every man to sit under his own vine and fig-tree, under
penalty of being driven into the Gulf; but either party
scornfully rejected the advice. The great police-party
of tle North, ever anxious to make peace, thought it
best tllat tlle Southern brethren should take Wasllin(gton; but the plan was rejected as being contrary to the
rules of civilized warfare; and the Rebs, to show that
they could be magnanimous, invited the Washington
people to visit Richmond, which invitation Mwould hlave
been accepted, but for the fact that the roads were
roull, and somevlwhat obstructed. This is really to be
regretted. Itad this visit taken place, it is altogether
probable that the moral an(l physical antecedents of
that which was and is, would lhave gone before that
which is to come of the grand ftture of this nation, and
the cause of humanity would have been advanced.
The people were very much interested in civil war,
but the romance of the thing is about over, and they now
begin to think of the suppression of this Rebellion. To
accomplish this, some advise peace-a draft-a war
with all Europe-the annexation of Canada-or a grand
Strategical Presidential campaign. I cannot indorse
these views. In mily opinion, the only way to suppress
tllis Rebellion is, to crush it. This plan has been
strongly urged upon the Administration, and will probably be accepted when the acquaintance of the coming
man is made. Otherwise, unless something prevents,
affairs will remain as thley are until a chlangre is effected,

novel experiment of a proclamation.
From the foregoing remarks, my hearers, it is proven
that wars are of two kinds: tlnose that are and thcse
that are not. If wars are, then they are not wars that
are not; and if they are not, then they are not wars that
are. When tle people comprehend this extensive truth,
and live 1up to its hligh privileges, then shall the American eagle sing the paeans of victory and the dirge of
Rebellion, and the Union saved; and, conscious of its
strength, shall press on fronm the Atlantic to the Pacific,
according to poetic justice, and dipping its pen in the
sunlight, shall write with tile golden ink on the blue
vault, higher than the name of Toussaint L'Ouverture,
"The Union, now and forever, one and inseparable;"
and Jeff Davis, from  his villa on the MIediterranean
shores, shall curse the day that saw him  try to whitewash out that fiat.
DISUNION.-Albert Pike.*
Ay, shout!'Tis the day of your pride,
Ye despots and tyrants of earth!
Tell your serfs the American name to deride,
And to rattle their fetters in mirth;
Ay, shout! for the league of the free
Is about to be shivered to dust,
And the rent limbs to fall from the vigorous tree,
Where Liberty put her firm trust;
Shout! shout! for more firmly established will be
Your thrones and dominions beyond the blue sea
Laugh on! for such folly supreme
The wc,rld had yet never beheld;
And ages to come will the history- deem
A tale by antiquity swelled;
For nothinog that time has upbuilt
* It will surprise our readers to learn that the man who wrote
this fine piece of anathema grew to be a very malignant disunionist in 1861. He'became a aeneral in the rebel service and was
the first man to bring the Indians into the field to aid the rebel
cause. His poem stands on record his own most blasting witness.
