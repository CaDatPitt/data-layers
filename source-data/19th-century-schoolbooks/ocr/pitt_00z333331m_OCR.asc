use, and fashioning rude personal ornaments.

therefore War was their chief vocation.” They
generally went forth in parties of about forty
bowmen. Sometimes a half-doz-
en, like knights-errant,3 Went out
upon the War path to seek re-
nown in combat. Their weapons

,Were bows and arrows, hatchets
(tomahawks) of stone, and scalp-
ing-knives of bone. Some were

were skilful in stratagem, and sel-

dom met an enemy in open ﬁght. Their close personal encounters
were ﬁerce and bloody. They made prisoners, and tortured
them, and the scalpsiof enemies Were their trophies of War.

about half an inch long, generally disposed in alternate layers of white and bluish black, and valued,
when they become a circulating medium, at about two cents for three of the. black beads, or six of the
white. They were strung in parcels to represent a" penny, three pence, a shilling, and ﬁve shillings of
white ; and double that amount in black. A fathom of white was worth about two dollars and a half,
and black about ﬁve dollars. They were of less value at the time of our war for independence. The
engraving shows a part of a swing and a belt of Wampum. '

1. This is part of a record of a war expedition. The ﬁgures on the right and left—one with a gun,-
and the other with the hatchet——denote prisoners taken by a warrior. The one without a head, and
holding a bow and arrow, denotes that one was killed; and the ﬁgure with a shaded part below the
cross indicates a female prisoner. Then he goes in a war canoe, with nine companions, denoted by the
paddles, after which a council is held by the chiefs of the Bear and Turtle tribes, indicated by rude ﬁg-
ures of these animals on each side of a ﬁre. , i

It was offensive to a chief or warrior to ask him his name, because it implied that his brave deeds
were unknown. Red Jacket, the great Seneca chief was asked his name in court, in compliance with
a legal form. He was very indignant, and replied, “ Iaook at the papers which the white people keep
the most carefully”—(land cession treaties)—“ they will tell you who I am.” ’ He was born near Geneva,
New York, about 1750, and died in 1830. He was the last great chief of the Senecas.

QUEEN ANNE’S WAR.

43. Fortunately for the people of New York, the FIVE NATIONS had made a
treaty of neutrality with the French in Canada [Aug. 4, 1701], and became an
impassable barrier against the savage hordes from the St. Lawrence. The
tribes from the Merrimac to-‘the Penobscot, -hadmade a treaty of peace with
New England [J uly, 1703], but the French induced them to violate it; and
before the close of summer, the hatchet fell upon the
people of the whole frontier from Casco to Wells.
Blood ﬂowed in almost every valley; and early the
next Spring [March, 1704], a large party of French
and Indians, under major Hertel de Rouville, attacked
Deerﬁeld, on the Connecticut river, applied the torch,‘
killed forty of the inhabitants, and carried one hundred
and twelve away to the wilderness. Among these was
. . Rev. John Williams, the minister, whose little daughter,

g,-1LL,,,Msvs HOUsE_ after a long residence with the Indians, became at-

tached to them, and married a Mohawk chief? Similar

scenes occurred at intervals during the whole progress of the war. Remote

settlements were abandoned, and the people on the frontier collected in fortiﬁed
houses,’ and cultivated their ﬁelds in armed parties of half a dozen or more.

42. In the spring of 1707, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire,
determined to chastise the French on their eastern borders. Connecticut refused
to join in the enterprise, and the three colonies alone prepared an armament.
Early in June, a thousand men under colonel Marsh, sailed from Nantucket for
Port Royal,4 in Acadia, conveyed by an English man-of-war.5 The French were
prepared for them, and nothing‘ was effected except the destruction of consider-
able property outside the fort. Three years later, an armament left Boston
[Sept. 1710], and, in connection with a ﬂeet from England under colonel Nichol-
son, demanded and obtained a surrender of . the fort and garrison [Oct. 13], at
Port Royal. The name of the place was changed to Annapolis, in honor of the
Queen,6 and Acadia was annexed to the English realm under the title of Nova
Scotia, or New Scotland.

43. War still continued, and the following Summer, Sir Hovenden Walker
arrived at Boston [J uly, 1711], with a.n English fleet and army, designed for the
conquest of Canada. New England promptly raised additional forces, and on

graving. It stood near the centre of the village, until within a few years. ‘

2. Mrs. Williams, and other captives, who were unable to travel as rapidly as the Indians, were mur-
dered. On his arrival in Canada, Mr. Williams was treated with respect by the French, and after two
%ears of captivity, was ransomed, and returned to Massachusetts. The chief object of the expedition to

eerfield, appears to have been to carry off the bell that hung in Williams’ church. That bell was pur-
chased the year previous for the church of Saut St. Louis, at Caughnawaga, near Montreal. The vessel
in which it was brought from Havre was captured by a New England privateer, and the bell was
purchased for the Deerﬁeld meeting-house. Father Nicolas, of the church at Caughnawaga, accom-
panied the expedition, and the bell was carried in triumph to its original destination, where it still
remains. . ,

the 10th of August, ﬁfteen men-of-war and forty transports, bearing almost seven
thousand troops, departed for the St. Lawrence to attack Quebec. Walker, like
Braddock,1 haughtily refused to listen to experienced subordinates, and lost eight
of his ships, and almost a thousand men, on the rocks at the mouth of the river,
on the night of the 2d of September. Dishea.rtened by this calamity, Walker
returned to England with the remainder of his ﬂeet, and the colonial troops went
back to Boston. ' On hearing of this failure of the naval expedition, a body of
troops marching from Albany to attack Montreal, retraced their steps.‘3 Hostili-
ties were now suspended, and in the Spring of 1713, a treaty of peace was con-

cluded [April 11] at Utrecht. The Eastern Indians sent a ﬂag to Boston, and
sued for peace, and at Portsmouththe governor of Massachusetts and New

I-Iampsliire entered into a paciﬁc compact [July 24] with the chiefs of the tribes.

46. For thirty years succeeding the close of Queen Anne’s War, the colonies
enjoyed comparative repose. Then, again, the selﬁsh strifes of European mon-
archs awakened the demon of discord, and its bloody footsteps were soon-appa-
rent along the northern frontiers of the English colonies in America. The inte-
rim had been a period of much political agitation in Massachusetts, during which
a great stimulus had been given to the growth of ‘republican principles. Dis-
putes, sometimes violent, and sometimes in a conciliatory spirit, had been car-‘
ried on between the royal governors and the representatives of the people; the
former contending for prerogatives and salaries which the people deemed inad-
missible.3 These internal disputes were arrested when they heard that France
had declared hostility to England [March 15, 1744], and the colonists cheerfully
prepared to commence the contest known in America as

KING eEoReE’s WAR.

47. The principal event of this war4 in America, was the capture of the for-
tress of Louisburg, on the island of Cape Breton. It had been constructed by
the French after the treaty at Utrecht, at an expense of ﬁve and a half millions
of dollars, and because of its great strength, was called The Gibm.Ztar.0f Amer-
ica. W'illiam Shirley,-'5 a soldier and energetic statesman, was governor of Mas-
sachusetts when hostilities were proclaimed. He immediately perceived the
importance of Louisburg in the coming contest, and plans for its capture were
speedily perfected by the Legislature of Massachusetts!‘ Rhode Island, New
Hampshire, and Connecticut furnished their proper quota of troops. New York
sent artillery, and Pennsylvania provisions. Thus common danger was extend-

1. ‘Verse 14, p. 142.

2. These were four thousand in number, under the command of General Nicholson. They were fur-
nished by N en?‘ York and Connecticut.

3. The chief topic of controversy was the payment of salaries. Governors Shute, Burnet, and Belcher,
all contended for a permanent salary, but the people claimed the right to vote such salary, each year,’
as the services of the governor appeared justly to demand. A compromise was ﬁnally _et1'ected by an
agreement to vote a certain sum each year. The subject of salaries was a cause of contention with
the royal governors, until the Revolution.

4. The husband of queen Anne died several years previous to her death, which occurred in August,
1704. George, Elector of Hanover, in Germany, was immediately proclaimed king of England, by the
title of George the First. His son George succeeded him in 1727, and also retained the title and privi-
leges of elector of Hanover. A contest arose between Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, and the elector
of Bavaria, for the throne of Austria. The king of England espoused the cause of the empress in 1743,
and the king of France took part with her opponent. This led France to declare war against England,
a contest known in America as King Gem-gc’s War, but in Europe, the War of the Austrmn Succession.

Bahama Islands, and died at Roxbury, near Boston, in 1771.

upon by a majority of only one vote.

sudden appearance of
this formidable arma-
ment was the ﬁrst inti-
mation to the French, ’
that an attack Was meditated, and great consternation prevailed in the fortress
and town. ” ‘

49. A direct approach to the town was difiicult on account of a morass, and a
combined attack by sea and land was carefully arranged. The land forces en-
camped in a curve in rear of the town, and detachments secured the French out-
posts, one "after another. Cannons were dragged on sledges over the fnorass,4
trenches were dug, batteries5 Were erected, and a regular siege was commenced
[May 31]. In the meanwhile, commodore Warren captured a French ship of
seventy-four guns, and secured overﬁve hundred men, with a large quantityxof
military stores. l/Vhile the siege was in progress, other English vessels of War
arrived, and the ﬂeet and army agreed to make a combined attack on the 29th
of June. Despairing of successful resistance, the French surrendered the for-
tress, the city of Louisburg, and the island of Cape Breton, on the 28th of June

France; and the following year [1746] the Duke‘D’Anvi1le was_ sent with a pow-
erful naval armament’ to recover the lost fortress, and to desolate the -English
settlements along the seaboard. Storms wrecked many of his vessels, and dis-
ease swept away hundreds of his men; and D’Anville, thoroughly dispirited,

abandoned the enterprise without strikinga blow.2 Two years afterward a

treaty of peace was concluded at Aix-la-Chapelle, inwestern Germany, when it
was agreed that all prisoners should be released, and all acquisitions of property
or territory, made by either party, were to be restored. Both of the principal
parties were heavy losers by the contest;3 while the strength of the colonists,

,1. Peter Minuit,6 recently appointed governor of New N etherland,7 arrived
at New Amsterdam  the germ of the present city of New York was called),-
in May, 1626. He immediately purchased of the Indians, for about twenty-
four clellars, the whole of the island of Manhattan,3 on which the city of New
York now ‘stands, and began vigorously to perfect the founding of a state
similarto those of Holland. He erected a strong fortiﬁcation near the. site
of the present Battery, and called it Fort AmstercZctm.9 By conciliatory meas-
ureslhe gained the conﬁdence of the Indians; and he also opened a friendly,
correspondence with the Puritans at Plymouth.” The English reciprocated
the friendly expressions of the Dutch; at the same time they requested the
latter not to send their trappers quite so far eastward as Narraga.nset Bay, to
catch otters and beavers“, » V

died, it is believed, by poison. His lieutenant also committed suicide, in consequence of rnortitied
pride. These disasters to the French ﬂeet, were regarded by the people of New‘ England as special
manifestations of Providence in their favor. Public thanksgivings were offered ; and 1.0 one doubted‘

came profitable to the Company. The lirst year’s remittance of furs to Amsterdam was valued at $11,000.
This trade greatly increased ; and before the troubles with the Indians in 1640, the value of furs sent to
Holland annually, was more than $60,000. e '

2. To encourage emigration to New N etherland, the Dutch 'West India Oom-
pcmy’ offered [1629] large tracts of land and certain privileges to- those per-
sons who should lead or send a given number of emigrants to occupy and till
the soil.2 Directors of the company3 availed themselves of the privilege, and
sent Wouter Van Twiller to examine the country and select the lands. I Immi-
grants came; and then were laid the foundations of the most noted of the
manorial estates of New York.4 The proprietors were called patron’/ts (patrons),
and held a high political and social station in the New Worl . ’

3. Van Twiller was appointed governor in 1633. The beginning of his ad-
ministration was marked by difficulties with the English on the Connecticut
river.5 He was more distinguished for his marriage connection with Van Reus-
selaer, one of the Patroons, than for any administrative qualities. -Yet circum-
stances favored the advancement of the colony, and he ruled quite satisfactorily,
especially to the Company, whose interests he faithfully served. Hewas suc-
ceeded in ofﬁce, in May 1638, by Sir William Keift, at the moment when the
Swedish colony‘? were seating themselves upon the banks of the Delaware.

4. Keift, the ﬁfth governor or director-general, was a bold, rapacious, and un-
scrupulous man, and soon brought serious trouble upon the colony. He began

a tyrannous rule by concentrating executive power in his own hands; and his.

administration was a stormy and unfortunate one. The sum of its record is a
tale of continual strife with the Swedes on the Delaware,7 the English on the
Connecticut,3 the Indians all around him, and the colonists at his door.’ His dif-
ﬁculties with the Indians proved the most disastrous of all, and ﬁnally wrought
-his own downfall. Previous to his arrival, the intercourse of the Dutch with
the Indians had been quite friendly.9 The fur trade was extending, and trap-
pers and traders were all abroad among the native tribes. These carried a
demon of discord with them. They furnished the Indians with rum, and quar-
rels and murders ensued. The avaricious Keift also demanded tribute" of Wam-
puml” and beaver-skins from the River tribes ; and in a short time their friend-
ship-for the Dutch became weakened. 5 _

5. Some Raritanll Indians in New Jersey were accused of robbery. _Keift sent
an armed force to punish them [July 1640], and blood ﬂowed. Several Indians
were killed, and their crops were destroyed. Savage vengeance did not slum-
ber long. The Rctrttans murdered four planters on Staten Island [June 1641],
and destroyed considerable property.1'3 An expedition sent to punish the offend-
ers was unsuccessful. Soon afterward, a young Westcliester Indian, whose uncle

Van Rensselaer; Immense tracts of land in Albany and Rensselaer counties, portions of the ﬁrst
Patroons’ estates, are yet (1854) in possession of the family. Since 1840, many scenes of violence and
bloodshed have been witnessed on those lands, growing out of disputes with tenants, when they have
been called upon to pay even the almost nominal rent which is demanded. Social and political ques-
tions have arisen, and produced two strong parties. The defence of the tenantry is termed Antt'—Renti.<mt.

had been murdered by a Hollander, near where’ the Halls of Justice now stand,‘
revenged the murder, according to the customs of his people,'4' by killing an in-
offensive Dutchman living at Turtle Bay.3 His tribe refused to surrender him
on the demand of Keift, and the governor determined to make War upon all the
offending savages.

6. Already the people had begun to murmur at Keift’s course, and charged
the troubles with the Indians directly upon him. Unwilling to assume the entire
responsibility of a War himself, the governor called a meeting [Aug. 23, 1641]
of the heads of families in New Amsterdam, for consultation. _- These promptly
chose “twelve select men” [Aug. 29], with De Vries4 at their head, to act for
them; and this was the ﬁrst representative assembly ever formed among
Europeans on Manhattan Island. They did notagree with the governor’s hos-
tile views; and Kieft ﬁnding them not only opposed to his war designs, but

-that they Were also ta.king cognizance of alleged grievances of the people,

dissolved them [Feb. 1642]. Finally, the commission of other murders by In-
dians, and the presence of a body of ' Mohawks, who had come down to exact
tribute from the River tribes, concurred with the changed opinions of some
leading citizens of ' New Amsterdam, to make Keift resolve to embrace this op-
portunity to chastise the savages.‘ A large number of them had ﬂed before the
11/Iohawks, and sought shelter with the Hackensacks, near Hoboken, and there
craved the protection of the Dutch. Now Was offered an opportunity for a wise
and humane“ governor, to make a covenant of peace and friendship; but Keift
could notrbe satisﬁed Without a ﬂow of blood. At midnight, in February 1643,‘
a body of Hollanders and Mohawks crossed the Hudson, fell upon the unsuspecting
fugitives, and before the dawn, massacred almost a hundred men, women and
children. Many were driven from the cliffs at Hoboken into the freezing ﬂood,
and at sunrise the bloody marauders returned to New Amsterdam with thirty
prisoners, and the heads of several Indians.

7. This massacre aroused the fiery" hatred and vengeance of all the surround-
ing tribes, and a ﬁerce War was soon kindled. Villages and farms were deso-
lated, and White people were butchered Wherever found by" the incensed In-
clians.5 The Long Island tribes,5 hitherto friendly, joined their kindred, and the
very existence of the Dutch colony was menaced. Fortunately for the settlers,
that eminent peace-maker, Roger Williams,7 arrived, to embark for England,3
and he paciﬁed the savages [1643] and secured a brief repose for the colony.
But the war Was soon renewed, and for two years the colony suffered dread-
fully. Having no competent leader, they employed captain John Underhill,9
who successfully beat back and defeated the Indians, and hostilities ceased.‘
The Mohawks came and claimed sovereignty over the River Indians, and made a
treaty of peace with the Dutch. .

8. Keift’s conduct was so offensive tothe colonistsand the Company, that
he was recalled, and he sailed for Europe in 1647, in a richly laden ves-

~ sel. It Was Wrecked on the coast of Wales, and there the governor perished.

. He had alreadybeen succeeded in office [May
27, 1647], by Peter Stuyvesant, lately governor
of Guracoa, a soldier of eminence, and possessed-
of every requisite for an efﬁcent administration
of government. His treatment of the Inclia.ns

hwas very kind and just, and they soon exhibited
such friendship for the Dutch, that Stuyvesant

irritation ‘on his eastern frontier being removed, Stuyvesant turned his at-
tention to the growing power of the Swedes, on the Delaware.

9. In 1651, Stuyvesant built Fort (Jasimer, on the site of the present New
Castle, in Delaware. This was soon seized by the Swedes, and the garrison
made prisoners. The States-Greneral4 resolved to prevent further trouble, and
for this purpose, gave Stuyvesant full liberty to .subjugate the Swedes. At the
head of six hundred men, he sailed for the Delaware in August, 1655,,and by
l3l1G,IIlldClle'Ol‘ October, he had captured all the Swedish fortresses, and sent the
governor (Risingh) and several inﬂuential men, to Europe.‘ Some of the settlers
‘withdrew. to" Maryland and Virginia, but the great body of them quietly sub-
mitted, took an oath of allegiance to the States-General of Holland, and con-
tinued in peaceable possession of their property. Thus, after an existence of
about seventeen’ years [1638-1655], NEW SWEDEN5 disappeared by absorption
into NEW NETHERLAND. 5 ‘ .

. 10. While Stuyvesant and his soldiery were absent on the Delaware, some
Indians, who were not yet reconciled to the Dutch, menaced New Amsterdam.5
The return of the governor produced quiet, and, for. eight years, the colony was
Very little disturbed by external causes. Then the Esopus Indians suddenly
fell upon the Dutch settlements [June, 1663] at Wiltwyck (now Kingston7) and
killed and captured sixty-ﬁve of the. inhabitants. Stuyvesant promptly sent a
sutﬁcient force. to chastise them; and so thoroughlyvvas the errand performed,
that the Indians sued for peace [May, 1664], and made a treaty of friendship.

with his neighbors, there was a power at work within his own domain which
gave him great uneasiness. The democratic seed planted by the Twelve, in
Kieft’s time,‘ had begun to grow vigorously under the fostering care of a few
enlightened Hollanders, and some Puritans who had settled in New Netherland.
The latter, by their applause of English institutions, had diﬁ'used a desire among
the people to partake of the blessings of ‘English’ liberty, as they understood it.
Stuyvesant was an aristocrat by birth, education, and pursuit, and vehemently
opposed every semblance’ofdemocracy.’ At the beginning he found himself at
variance with thepeople. At length an assembly of two deputies from each
village in New Netherland, chosen by the inhabitants, convened at New Am-
sterdam [Dec. 1653], without the approbation of the governor. Their. proceed-
ings displeased him; and ﬁnding argument. of no avail, he exercisedihis official
prerogatives.’ The people grew bolder at every rebutf,‘and ﬁnally they not
only resisted taxation, but openly expressed a willingness to bear English rule
for the sake of enjoying English liberty. The opportunity for change was not
long delayed. ‘

12. Afcrisis in the affairs of New N etherland now approached. Charles the
Second, of England, witlioutany fairpretence to title, gave the whole territory
of New Netherland [March 22, 1664] to his brother James, duke ‘of"York.‘-3
The duke sent an English squadron, under the command of colonel Richard

Nicolls,3 to secure the gift; and on the 3d of September, 1664;, the red cross of‘

St. George’4 ﬂoated in triumph over the Fort, and the name of New Amsterdam
was changed to New York.-5 It was an easy conquest, for, while the fortiﬁca-
tions and other means of defence were very weak, the people were not unwill-
ing to try English rule. Stuyvesant began to make concessions to the people,
when it was too late, and when his real strength, the popular will, had departed
from him. _ [He hesitated long before he would sign the articles of capitulation;
and thus, "until the end, he was faithful to his employers, the Dutch West India
Company/.5 With the capital, the remainder of the province passed into the
hands of the English, and early in October, 1664, New N etherland was acknow-
ledged a part of the British realm, and N icolls, the conqueror, became governor.7

not enhance their prosperity and ‘happiness. They were disappointed in their
hope of having a representative government; and their taxes, to support a

4. The royal standard of England is sometimes so named because it bears a red cross, which is callel
the “ cross of St. George,” the patron saint of Great Britain. After the Union with Scotland [note 1,
p. 46], the cross of St. Andrew (in the form of an X, was added, and is now seen on the British flag.
In the centre are the royal arms. This Union, as the ﬁgure is callec, was borne upon the American
ﬂags, sometimes, until after the Declaration of-Independence, in 1776. It ‘was upon the ﬂag of thirteen
stripes, alternated red and white, which Washington caused to be unfurled at Cambridge, on the ﬁrst
day of that year. See verse 1, p. 182. A . ,

7. We have elsewhere noticed the fact, that before Nicolls was dispatched, the Duke, being certain
of victory, sold that part of N ew Netherlands now» included in New Jersey, to other parties. [Sec V. 7,
p. 69.] Long Island, which had been previously granted to the earl of Stirling, was purchased by the
Dutch, in totaldisregard of the claims of Connecticut. The colonies [verses 4 and 6, p. 68]‘ on the
Delaware remained under the jurisdiction of New York, and were governed by deputies. ~

him, he ordered the paper to be burned by the common hangman. He was a
petty tyrant, and declared that the people should have “ liberty for no thought,
but how to pay their taxes.” But the people did think of something else, and
were on the eve of open rebellion when the clouds of na.tional war over-
shadowed local difficulties. .

14. War again commenced between England and Holland in 1672, and in July
the following year, a Dutch squadron sailed up the Bay of New York, and, in
the absence of the governor, took possession of the fort and town [Aug. 9, 1673]
without giving a shot. The easy conquest was the work of treason; yet, as
the royal libertine (Charles the Second) on the throne of England doubtless
shared in the bribe, the traitor Went unpunished.1 N ew’J ersey, and the Terri-

New York was again New Netherlands. When the two nations madea treaty
of peace, the province was restored to the English, and remained in their pos-
session until our Independence was declared in 17 7 63. These. changes raised
some doubts concerning the validity of the duke’s title, and the "king gave him
another grant in July 1674. Sir Edmond Androst was appointed governor
under the new charter, and continued arbitrary rule, with increased rigor.5

15. Andros returned to England at the close of 1683, when the duke, (who was
a Roman Catholic), appointed Thomas Dongan, of the same faith, to succeed him.
In the meanwhile, the duke had listened to the judicious advice of William Penn,
and ‘instructed Dongan to call an assembly of representatives. They met [Oct. 17,

 

1683], and with the hearty concurrence of the governor, a CHARTER or LIBERTIES.
was established,“ and the permanent foundation of a representative govern-_

ment was laid. The people rejoiced in the change, and were heartily engaged in
efforts to perfect a wise and liberal government, when the duke was elevated to
the throne, as James the Second,7 on the death of Charles, in February, 1685. As
king, he refused to conﬁrm the privileges which, as duke, he had granted; and
having determined to introduce the Roman Catholic religion into the province as
the established church, he commenced by efforts to enslave the people. A direct
tax was ordered; the printing press——the right arm of knowledge and freedom—-

levied without the consent ‘of the people, expressed by their representatives. At this time the colony
was divided into‘ twelve counties. ‘

was forbidden a place _in the colony; and the provincial offices were ﬁlled by
Roman Catholics. Their proceedings gave pain to the liberal-minded Dongan;
and when the king, in his religious zeal, instructed the governor to introduce

French priests among the FIVE N ATIONS,’ he resisted the measure as highly‘

inexpedientﬁ . . p

16. The people were again on the eve of open rebellion, when the intelligence.
of the ﬂight of James, and the accession of William and Mary,3 reached them.
They immediately appointed a committee of safety, and with almost unanimous

' voice, sanctioned the conduct of Jacob Leisler (an inﬂuential merchant, and com-

mander of the militia), who had taken possession of the fort in the name of the
new sovereigns, and by order of the people. Afraid of the people, Nicholson,
the successor of Dongan, ﬂed on board a vessel and departed, and the people
consented to Leisler’s assuming the functions of governor until a new one should
be appointed. The aristocracy and the magistrates were offended, and denoun-
cing Leisler as an usurper, they accused him of treason, when governor Slough-
ter arrived, ‘in 1691.

1'7. In the meanwhile, Liesler conducted affairs with prudence and energy.

Having the sanction of the people, he needed no further authority; and when a

-letter from the British ministers arrived [December, 1689], directed to governor

Nicholson, “or, in his absence, to such as, for the time being,” conducted affairs,
he considered it. as fairly addressed to jhimself. Milborne, his son-in-law, acted
as his deputy, and was included in the accusations of the magistrates, who had
now retiredto Albany. They held Fort Orange4 until the invasion of the
French in February 1690,-5 when they felt the necessity of claiming the protec-
tion of the government at New York. They then yielded, and remained com-
paratively quiet until the arrival of Richard Ingoldsby, Sloughter’s lieutenant,
early in 1691. ' 1 Q

. 18. Ingoldsby announced the appointment of Henry Sloughter asgovernor;
and without producing any credentials of authority, he haughtily demanded of
Leisler [Feb. 9, 1691] the surrender of the fort. Of course Leisler refused.com-
pliance; but as soon as Sloughter arrived March 29], he sent a messenger to
announce his desire to surrender all authority into his hands. Leisler’s enemies
had resolved on his destruction ; and when he came forward to deliver the fort,
in person, he and his son-in-law were seizedyand cast into prison. They were.
tried on a charge of treason, found guilty, and condemned to suffer death. Slough-
ter withheld his signature to their death warrant; but, when made drunk at a
dinner party prepared for the purpose, he put his name to the fatal instrument.

Before he became sober, Leisler and Milborne were suspended upon a gallows , -

on the verge of Beekman’s swamp [May 26, 1691], where Tammany Hall noW_
stands. These were the proto-martyrs of popular liberty in America.6

desire to promote the welfare of the colonists. He convened a popular assem-

THE ABORIGINES. 11

11. Women were degraded to the condition of abject slaves, and they never
engaged with the men in their amusements of leaping, dancing, target-shooting,
ball-playing, and games of chance. They were allowed as spectators, with their
children, at war-dances around ﬁres, when the men recited the feats of their
ancestors and of themselves. Marriage, among them, was only a temporary
contract; the men had the right to take wives, and dismiss them at pleasure.
The affections were ruled by custom,‘ and those decorous endearments and atten-
tions toward woman, which give a charm to civilized society, were wholly un-
known among the Indians. The sentiment of conjugal love was not always
wanting, and attachments for life were frequent. There was no society to call
for woman’s reﬁning qualities to give it beauty, for they had but few local
attachments, except for the burial places of their dead.

g p 12. Their funeral ceremonies and methods of burial were similar throu,<2'~out
the whole continent. ' They laid their dead, wrap- '
ped in skins, upon sticks, in the bottom of a
shallow pit, or placed them in a sitting posture, or
occasionally. folded them in skins, and laid them
upon high scaffolds, out of the reach of wild
beasts. Their arms, utensils, paints and food,
were buried with them, to be used on their long
journey to the spirit-land. Over their graves they
raised mounds, and planted beautiful wild ﬂowers
upon them. Relatives uttered piercing cries and
great lamentations during the burial, and they BURIAL-PLACE.
continued mourning many days. ’

13. Their religion was simple, without many ceremonies, and was universally
embraced. They had no inﬁdels among them. They believed in the existence
of two Great Spirits; the one eminently great was the Good Spirit, and the
interior was an Evil one. They also deiﬁed the sun, moon, stars, meteors, ﬁre,

 

water, thunder, wind, and everything which they held to be superior to them-.

selves, but they never exalted their heroes or prophets above the sphere of
humanity. They also adored an invisible, great Master of life, in different forms,
whichzthey called Manitou, and made it a sort of tutelar deity} They had vague
ideas of the doctrine of atonement for sins, and made propitiatory sacriﬁces with
great solemnity. All of them had dim traditions of the creation, and of a great
deluge which covered the earth. Each nation had crude notions, drawn from
tradition, of their own distinct origin, a.nd all agreed that their ancestors came
from the North.

14. Their government was a mixture of the patriarchal and despotic. All
political power was vested in a sachem or chief; who was sometimes an heredi-
ditary monarch, but frequently owed his elevation to his own merits as a warrior

or orator. Whﬂe in power, he was absolute in the execution of enterprises, if '

1. They believed every animal to have had a great original, or father. The
first buﬁalo, the ﬁrst bear, the ﬁrst beaver, the ﬁrst eagle, &c., was the Mam'to>z.
of the whole race of the different creatures. They chose some one of tliesw
originals as their special Manitou or guardian, and hence arose the custom of
having the ﬁgure of some animal for the arms or symbol of a tribe, called
totum. For example, each of the Five Nations (see Sec. III.) was divided
into several tribes, designated The Wolf, The Bear, The Turtle, &c.. and
their respective totums were rude representations of these animals. When
they signed treaties with the white people, they sometimes sketched outlines
of their totums. ‘ The annexed out represents the totum of Teyendagages, of TOTUM
the Turtle tribe of the Mohawlc nation, as afﬁxed by him to a deed. "

bly, and formed a constitution, which provided for trial by jury, and an exemp-
tion from taxes, except by the consent of the representatives of the people.
Light was thus dawning hopefully upon the province, when delirium zﬁremens, at
the close of a drunken revel, ended the administration and the life of the gov-
ernor [Aug. 2, 1691], in less than three months a.fter the murder of Leisler and
Milborne.

20. Sloughter. was succeeded by Benjamin Fletcher, a man of violent passions,
and quite as weak and dissolute. He became the tool of the aristocracy, and
was hated by the people. Party spirit, engendered by the death of Leisler,
burned intensely during the whole administration of Fletcher; and, at the sa.me
time, the French and Indians, under the guidance of Frontenac, the able governor
of Canada,‘ were traversing the northern frontiers of the province. Fletcher
prudently listened to the advice of major Schuyler} of Albany, respecting the
In<°"ans; and under 1lS leadership, the English, and their unwavering allies, the
FIVE NATIONS, successfully beat back the foe to the St. Lawrence, and so deso-
lated the French settlements [1692] in the vicinity of Lake" Champlainﬁ’ that
Frontenac’ was glad to remain quiet at Montreal. ‘

21. The earl of Bellomont, an honest and energetic Irish peer, succeeded
Fletcher in 1698; and the following year, New Hampshire4 and Massachusetts?
were placed under his jurisdiction. He commenced reform with great earnest-
ness, and made vigorous efforts to suppress piracy,5 which had become a. fearful
scourge to the infant commerce of the colonists. Witli Robert Livingston7 and
others, he ﬁtted out an expedition under the famous captain Kidd, to destroy
the buccaneers. Kidd, himself, was afterward hung for piracy [17 O1], and the
governor and his friends were charged with a participation in his guilt. ‘Kidd
appears to have been a v_ictim of a political conspiracy.3 ' V

22. Death removed Bellomont [March 16, 1701] when his liberal policy was
about to bear fruit. He was succeeded by Edward Hyde, (afterward Lord Corn-
bury,9) a libertine and a knave, who cursed the province with misrule for seven
years. He was a bigot, -too, and persecuted all denominations of Christians,
except those of the Church of England. He embezzled the public monies, in-
volved himself in heavy debts, and on all occasions was the practical enemy of
popular freedom. The peopleﬁnally demanded and obtained his recall, and the
moment his oﬁicial career ceased [I708], his creditors cast him into prison,

regarded as fair plunder. Privateer commissions were readily granted by the English, French and
Dutch governments ; and daring spirits from‘ all countries were found under their flags. The buccaneers,
as they were called, became very numerous and powerful, and at length depredated upon English coni-
merce as well as Spanish. Pm'vatcer.9, or those legally authorized to seize the property of an enemy, be-

-From this period, until the. arrival of William Cosby, as governor [17 32], the

. royal representatives,'3 unable to resist the will of the people, as expressed by

the Assembly, allowed democratic principles to grow and bear fruit.3

23. Rip Van Dam, “ a Inan of the people,” was acting governor when Cosby
came. They soon quarrelled, and two violent parties arose--the Democratic,
which sided with Van Dam, and the Aristocratic, which supported the governor.
Each party had the control of a newspaper,4 and the war of words raged vio-
lently for a long time. The governor, unable to compete withhis opponent,
ﬁnally ordered the arrest of Zenger [N ov. 1734:], the. publisher of the‘ Demo-
cratic paper, on a charge of libel. After an imprisonment of thirty-ﬁve Weeks,
Zenger was tried by a jury, and acquitted [J uly, 1735]. He was defended by
Andrew Hamilton, of Philadelphia, who was presented by the magistrates of
the city of New York with a gold box, as a token of their esteem for his noble
advocacy of popular rights. Then was distinctly drawn. the liner of - demarca-
tion between republicans and royalists (Wings and Tories),5 which continued
prominent until the war of therevolution was endedin 1.7 83. _

incident to asupposed conspiracy of the negroes [1741], to burn and plunder

A the city, murder the inhabitants, and set up a government under a man of their

own color.. Severalincendiary ﬁres had occurred inrapid succession, and a
house had been robbed by some slaves. The idea of a regular and horrid con-
spiracy at once prevailed, and, as in the case of the Salem Witchcraft,7 an in-
tense panic pervaded all classes, and many innocent persons suﬁ’ered.3 This is
known in history as The Negro Plot. ‘ »

112 COLONIES. :

growth began when, in 1639, the more convenient form of representative gov-
ernment was established. It was crude, but it possessed the elements of repub-
licanism. The freemen chose as many representatives as they pleased, and others
were appointed by the proprietor. These, with the, governor and secretary,
composed the legislature. At this ﬁrst session a Declaration of Rights was
adopted; the powers of the governor were deﬁned; and all the privileges en-.
joyed by English subjects were guarantied to the colonists.’ -

-2. The Indians in the vicinity, becoming jealous of the increasing strength
of the White people, began to evince hostility. Frequent collisions occurred;
and in 1642, a general Indian War commenced in the region between the Poto-
mac and the Chesapeake. It was terminated in 1645, but the quiet of the pro-
vince was soon disturbed again. Clayborne had returned from England? [1645],
and speedily fanned embers of discontent into a ﬂame of open rebellion. He
became too powerful for the local authorities, and governor Calvert3 was obliged
to ﬂee to Virginia. During a year and a half, the insurgents held the reins of
government, and the horrors of civil war brooded over the colony. The rebel-

lion was suppressed in the Summer of 1646, and Calvert resumed his office, in .

August. . u

:3. Animportant law was enacted by the Assembly in 1649, known as The
Toleration Act. Religious freedom was guarantied by the Charter,4 yet, as-
much animosity existed between the Protestantsi a.nd Roman Catholics, the As-
sembly3 thought proper to give the principle the solemn sanction of law. By
that act every professed believer in Jesus Christ, was allowed free exercise of
his religious opinions, and no man was permitted to reproach another on account.
of his peculiar doctrines, except under the penalty _of a ﬁne, to be paid to the
person so insulted. Thither persecuted Churchmen of New England, and op-.
pressed Puritans of ,Virginia, ﬂed and found an asylum. This Act is the pride-
and glory of the early legislature of Maryland; yet it was not the ﬁrst instance.
in..America, as is often alleged, when religious toleration received the sanction
of law.7 '

4. Favored by events in the mother country, republicanism grew steadily in
the new State. Royalty was abolished in England [1649], and for more than
ten years the democratic idea was prevalent throughout the realm. Lord Balti-
more, the proprietor of Maryland, professed republicanism on the death of the
king, but he had been too recently a royalist to secure the conﬁdence of Par-
liament. Stone, his lieutenant, was removed from office [April 16, 1651] by
commissioners (of whom Clayborne was one),- who were A sent to administer
the government of the Colony._ He was_ soon afterward [July 8] restored.
On the dissolution‘ of the Long Parliament, [1653]3 Cromwell ‘restored full pow-
ers to the proprietor, but the commissioners, who withdrew to Virginia, returned

6. Bozman, in his History oflllaryland, (II. 350-356) maintains that the majority of the members of ’
ts.

7. In May 1647, the General Assembly of Rhode Island, convened at Portsmouth, adopted a_ code of
laws which closed with the declaration that “ all men might walk as their conscience persuaded them,
without molestation, every one in the name of his God.” This was broader toleration than the,..Maryland
act contemplated, for it did not restrict men to a belief in Jesus Christ.

8. When Charles the First was beheaded [Note 10. p. 78], the Parliament assumed supreme authority,
and remained in permanent session. Cromwell, with an army at his back, entered that assembly in the,
Autumn of 1653, ordered them to disperse, and assumed supreme power himself, under the title of Lord
Protector. That British legislature is known in history as the Long Parliament. ‘

ioonl afterward, and compelled Stone to surrender the government into their
an s.

5. The colonial government had been re-organized in the meanwhile. The
legislative body was divided into an Upper and Lower House [l650]; the
former consisting of the governor and his council, appointed by the proprietor,
and the latter of representatives chosen by the people. At the same session, a
law was passed prohibiting all taxes unless levied with the consent of the free-
men. Political questions were freely discussed by the people; and soon the two
chief religious sects were marshalled in opposition, as prime elements of political
parties. So great had been the inﬂux of Protestants, that they now [1654] out-
numbered the Roman Catholics as voters and in the Assemblv. They acknow -
edged the authority of Cromwell, and boldly questioned the rights and privileges
of an hereditary proprietor.‘ The Roman Catholics adhered to Lord Baltimore,
and bitter religious hatred was fostered. The Protestants ﬁnally disfranchised
their opponents, excluded them from the Assembly, and toward the close of.
1654. [Nov.], passed an act declaring Roman Catholics not entitled to the
protection of the laws of Maryland.

6. Civil war ensued. Stone returned to St. Mary,9 organized an armed force
composed chieﬂy of Roman Catholics, seized the colonial records and assumed
the office of governor. Skirmishes ensued, and ﬁnally a severe battle was
fought [April 4, 1655] not far from the site of Annapolis, in which Stone’s
party was defeated with a loss of about ﬁfty men, killed and wounded. Stone
was made prisoner, but his life was spared. Four other leading supporters of
the proprietor were tried for treason and executed. .

7. Anarchy prevailed in the province for many months, when the discordant
elements were brought into comparative order by the appointment of Josiah
Fend-all [July 20, 1656], as governor. He was suspected of favoring the R0-
man Catholics, and was soon arrested by order of the Protestant Assembly.
For two years bitter strife continued between the people and the agents of the
proprietor, when, after concessions by the latter, Fendall was acknowledged
governor [April 3, 1658]. His prudence secured the conﬁdence of the people,
but the death of Cromwell,‘ [Sept. 1658,] presaging a change in the English
government, gave them uneasiness. After longdeliberation, the Assembly de-
termined to avoid all further trouble with the proprietor, by asserting the
supreme authority of the people. They accordingly dissolved the Upper
House [March 24, 1660],3 and assumed the whole legislative power of the
State. They then gave Fendall a commission as governor for the people.

8. Monarchy was restored in England in June, 1660,4 and the originalorder
of things was re-established in Maryland. Lord Baltimore having assured the
new king that his republican. professions5 were only temporary expedients,
was restored to all his proprietary rights, by Charles. Fendall was tried and
found guilty of treason, because he accepted a commission from the rebellious
Assembly. Baltimore, however, wisely proclaimed a general pardon for all po-
litical offenders in Maryland; and for almost thirty years afterward, the province
enjoyed repose. A law which established absolute political equality among proé
fessed Christians, was enacted; and after the death of the second Lord Balti-
more [Dec. 10, 1675], his son and successor conﬁrmed it. i ‘

9. Maryland was governed mildly and prudently under the new proprietor,
Charles Calvert, and the peoplegwere prospering in their political quietude, when
the Revolution in England‘ shook the colonies. The deputy governor of Mary-
land -hesitated to proclaim William and Mary,9 and this was made a pretense,
by a restless spirit, named Coode,3 for exciting the people. He gave currency
to the absurd report that the local magistrates and the Roman Catholics, had
leagued with the Indians4 for the destruction of all the Protestants in the ‘col-
ony. A similar actual coalition of J esuits5 and savages on the New England
frontiers,5 gave a coloring of truth to the. story, and the old religious feud in-
stantly burned again intensely. The Protestants formed an armed association
[Sept. 1689] and, led on by Coode, they took forcible possession of St. Mary,
and by capitulatibn, received the provincial records and assumed the govern-
ment. They called a Convention, and invested it with legislative powers. -Its
ﬁrst acts Were to depose the third Lord Baltimore, and to re-assert the sovereign
majesty of the people. ' ‘

10. The Convention managed public affairs until 1691, whenthe ‘king
unjustly deprived Baltimore of all his political privileges as proprietor [June 11]‘,
and made Maryland a royal provi_nce.7 Lionel Copley was appointed the .ﬁrst
royal governor in 1692. New laws were instituted—religious toleration’ was
abolished—the Church of England was made the established religion, to be
supported by a tax on the people; and in the State founded by Roman Catho-
lics, the members of that denomination were cruelly disfranchised, with the
consent of their sovereign. 

11. In 1716, the proprietary rights of:Lord Baltimore‘ (now deceased) were
restored to his infant heir, and the originalform of government was re-estab-
lished. Such continued to be the political complexion" of Maryland until the
storm of the Revolution, [17 76] swept away every remnant of royalty and

, feudalism.

2. Many of the New Haven settlers being merchants, they sought to found a
commercial colony, but heavy losses by the wreck of vessels? discouraged them,
and they turned their special attention to agriculture.‘ Prudence marked the
course of the magistrates of the several colonies in the ..Connecticut valley,4
and they were blessed with prosperity- But difficulties with:the' Dutch respect-
ing territorial.boundaries,5 and menaces of the neighboring ‘Indians, gave them
uneasiness, and made them readily join the New: England confederation in
1643.6 The following year the little independent colony- at Saybrook7 pur-
chased the land of one of the proprietors of Connecticut,8:and became‘ perman-

. ently annexed to that at Hartford.9

3. The treaty made with governor Stuyvesant at Hartford in 1650,10 gave

England and Holland drew the sword against each other in-1652; and because"

several weeks at New Amsterdam in the.winter_ of 1652,-’3,"»3 the belief pre-
vailed in New England, that Stuyvesant was leaguing '7Wli3hvtl1e Indians for the
destruction of the English.1.3 V-Great excitement ensued, and a majority of the

Commissioners decided” [1653] upon war-with the Dutch.‘ Immediate hostili-

ties were prevented by- the refusal of Massachusetts to furnish its quota of sup-
plies. The Connecticut colonies (who were more exposed to blows from the
Dutch than any other) applied to Cromwell for aid, a.nd he sent four ships of
war for the purpose. Before their arrival,“ a. treaty of peace was concluded
between the two nations, and blood and treasure were saved. The Assembly
at Hartford took possession of all property then claimed by the Dutch; and
after that the latter abandoned all claims to possessions in the Connecticut

. valley.

4. On the restoration of Charles the‘Second [1660], the Connecticut colony

his majesty with a ring which Charles the First had given to his father, the

heart of the-— king was touched, and he granted a charter [May 30, 1662] which
not only conﬁrmed the popular constitution of the colony, but contained more
liberal provisions than any yet issued from the royal hand.‘ It deﬁned the
Eastern boundary of the province to be N arraganset Bay, and the Western, the
Paciﬁc Ocean. It thus included a portion of Rhode Island, and the whole
New Haven 0020723/.2 The latter gave a reluctant consent to the union in 1665,
but_Rhode Island positively refused the alliance. A charter given to the latter
the year after one was given to Connecticut [1663],3 covered a portion of the
Connecticut grant in N arraganset Bay.- Concerning this boundary the two col-
onies disputed for more than sixty years.

5. * With the exception of some settlements high up on the fresh wa.ter river,4
the colony of Connecticut suffered but little during KING PHILIP’S \VAR,5
which broke out ' in 1675. Yet it furnished its full quota of men and supplies,
and its soldiers bore a conspicuous part in giving the vigorous blows which
broke the power of the New England Indians!‘ At the same time the colonists
were obliged to defend their liberties against the attempted usurpations of An-
dros, then governor of New York.7 He claimed jurisdiction to the mouth of
the Connecticut river, and in July, 1675, he proceeded to Saybrook with a small
naval force, to assert his authority. He was permitted to land; but when he
ordered the garrison in the fort to surrender, and began to read his commission
to the people, captain Bull, the commander, ordered him to be silent. Perceiv-
ing the strength and determination of his adversary, Andros wisely withdrew,
and-grea.tly irritated, returned to New York.

6. Very little occurred to" disturb the quiet and prosperity of Connecticut,
duringrthe next dozen years. Then a most exciting scene took place at Hart-
ford, in which the liberties of the colony were perilled. Edmund Andros again
appeared as-a usurper of authority. He had been appointed governor of New
England [1686],8.and on his arrival, demanded a surrender of all their charters.
They all complied, except Connecticut. She steadily refused to give up the
guaranty of her political rights; and ﬁnally Andros proceeded to Hartford.
with sixty armed men, to enforce obedience. The Assembly were in_ session
when he arrived [N ov. 10, 1687], and received him courteously. »He demand-
ed the surrender of the charter, and declared the colonial government dissolved.

7-. Already a plan had been arranged for securing the safety of the charter,
and at the same time to preserve an appearance of loyalty. The debates were
purposely protracted until the candles were lighted, at evening, when the_char-
ter was brought in and la.id upon the table; Just as Andros stepped forward to
take it, the candles. were suddenly extinguished. Thecharter was seized by
captain Wadswortli of the militia, and under cover of the night it was
effectually concealed in the hollow trunk of a huge oak, standing not far from

the Assembly chamber.” When the candles were relighted, the members were

in perfect order, but the charter could not be found. Andros assumed the gov-'
ernment, and with his own hand wrote the word FINIS, after the last record of

the Charter Assembly. The government was
administered in his own name until he was
driven from Boston in 1689,‘ when the charter
was taken from the oak [May 19, 1689], a popu-
lar Assembly was convened Robert Treat was
chosen governor, and Connecticut again assumed
her position as an independent colony.

8. A little more than four years later, the
Connecticut people were again compelled to as-
sert their chartered liberties. Colonel Fletcher,
then governor of New York} held a commission
which gave him command of the militia of Con-
necticut.3 As that power was reserved to the
colony by the charter, the Legislature refused to
acknowledge Fletcher’s authority. In November, 1693, he repaired to Hart-
ford, and, notwithstanding the legislature was in session, and again promptly
denied his jurisdiction, he ordered the militia to assemble. The Hartford com-
panies, under captain Wadsworth,4 were drawn up in line; but the moment
Fletcher attempted to read his commission, the drums were beaten. His angry
order of “Silence!” was obeyed for a moment; but when he repeated it, Wads-
worth boldly stepped in front of him and said, u “Sir, if they are again interrupt-
ed, .I’ll make the sun shine through you in a moment.” Fletcher perceived the
futility of a pa.rley, or further assumption of authority; and pocketing his com-
mission, he and his attendants returned to New ‘York, greatly chagrined and
irritated.‘ The matter was compromised when referred to the king, who gave
the governor of Connecticut militia jurisdiction in time of peace, but in -the
event of war, colonel Fletcher should have the command of a certain portion of
the troops of that colony.

9. Connecticut had now [17 00], a population of about thirty thousand, which
rapidly increased during the remainder of her colonial career. During Queen
Anne’s Wa7",5 and the stirring events in America from that time until the com-
mencement of the French and Indian War,3 when her people numbered one
hundred thousand, Connecticut went hand in hand with her sister colonies for
mutual welfare; and her history is too closely interwoven with theirs to require
further separate notice.

ern1nent.1 That charter was conﬁrmed by the Long Parliament‘? in October,‘
1652-, and this put an end to the persevering efforts of Massachusetts to absorb
“Williams’s N arraganset Plantations.” That colony had always coveted the
beautiful Aquiday,3 and feared the reaction of Williams’s tolerant -principles
upon the people from whose bosom he had been cruelly eXpelled.4 A dispute
concerning the eastern boundary of Rhode Island was productive of much ill
feeling during the progress of a century, when commissioners decided [1741]
the present line to" be the proper division, and wrangling ceased.

2. Like other colonies, Rhode Island was disturbed by internal commotions,
growing out of religious disputes and personal ambition. These were quieted
toward the close of 1653, when Roger Williams was chosen president. Crom-
well conﬁrmed the royal charter [May 22, 1655] ; and during his administratitin,
the colony prospered. On the accession of Charles the Second,5 Rhode Island
applied for and obtained a new charter [July 8, 1663], highly democratic in its

general features, and‘ similar, in every respect, to the one granted to Connecti-6,

cut.“ The first governor elected under this instrument, was Benedict Arnold; 7
and by a colonial law, enacted during his ﬁrst administration, the privileges of
freemen were granted only to freeholders, and their eldest sons. ‘ '

3. ‘Rhode Island yielded to Andros8 in January, 1687 ; but the moment intel-
ligence reached the people of the accession of William and Mary9 [May 11,
1689], and the imprisonment of Andros at Boston,” they assembled at Newport,
resumed their old charter, and re-adopted their se.l—an anchor, with Hope for
a motto. ‘Under this charter, Rhode Island continued to be governed for one
hundred and fifty-seven years, when the people, in representative convention
[1842], adopted a constitution.“ Newport soon became a thriving commercial
town; and when, in 1732, John I<‘ranklini established there the ﬁrst newspaper
in the‘ colony, it contained ﬁve thousand inhabitants, and the whole province
about eighteen thousand‘? Near Newport the celebrated Dean Berkeley pur-
chased lands [17 29]; and with him came John Smibert, an artist, who intro-
dueed portrait painting into America.” Notwithstanding Rhode Island was ex-
cluded from the New England confederacy,” it always bore its share in defensive

efforts; and its history is identiﬁed with that of New England in general,‘ from '

the commencement of King’William’s War.15 _ »

NEW JERSEY. [1664]

1. We have considered the settlements in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Dela-

ware, in the same section,1 as constituting a series of events having intimate re-I

lations with each other. The history of the colonial organization of the ﬁrst
two, is separate and distinct. Delaware was never a separate colony or state
until after the Declaration of Independence in 17 76.

2. The founding of the New Jersey colony occurred when, in 1664, the duke
of York sold the territory to lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret; 2 and the
new proprietors began the work of erecting a State. They published a form of
agreement, which they called “Concessions,” 3 in which liberal offers were made
to emigrants who might settle within the territory.— Among other provisions,
the people were to be exempt from the payment of quit-rents and other burdens,
for the space of ﬁve years. ,Allured by the liberality of the “Concessions,” as
well as by the salubrity of the climate and the fertility of the soil, many fam-
ilies came from Long Island [1664], and settled at Elizabethtown; 4 and in
August the following year, Philip Carteret (brother of one of the proprietors),
was appointed governor, and arrived at Elizabethtown with a number of
settlers. ‘

3. Nothing disturbed the repose of the colony during the ﬁve years’ exemp-
tion from rents; but when, in 1670, the speciﬁed halfpenny, for the use of each
acre of land, was required, murmurs of discontent were loud and universal.
Those who had purchased land from the Indians, denied the right of the pro-
prietors to demand rent from them; and some of the towns had even denied the
authority of the Assembly, at its ﬁrst sitting in 1668. The whole people com-
bined in resisting the payment of quit-rents; and after disputing with the pro-
prietors almost two years, they revolted, called a new Assembly, appointed a
dissolute, illegitimate son of Sir George Carteret, governor [May 1672], and soon
[July] compelled Philip Carteret to leave the province. Preparations were in
progress to coerce the people into submission, when New Jersey, and all other
portions of the territory claimed by the duke of York, fell [Aug. 1673] into. t_he
hands of the Dutch.5 . _

4. On the restoration of the territory to the Englishb‘ [Nov. 1674:], the duke of
York procured a new charter;7 and then, regardless of the rights of Berkeley
and Carteret, he appointed‘ Edmund Andros, “the tyrant of New England,’’3
governor of the whole domain [July 11, 1674]. Carteret demurred, and the"
duke partially restored his rights; not, however, without leaving Andros a suf-

3. This was a sort of constitution, which provided for a government to be composed of a Governor and
Council appointed by the proprietors, and an Assembly chosen by the freeholders of the province. The
legislative power resided in the Assembly ; the executive in the Governor. The Council and the Assem-

the tribe conﬁded in his wisdom. Public opinion, alone, sustained him. ‘It
elevated him, and it might depose him. Every measure of importance was
matured in council, which was. composed of the elders, with the sachem as
umpire. His decision was ﬁnal, and wherever he led, the whole ‘tribe followed.
The utmost decorum prevailed in the public assemblies, and a speaker ‘was
always listened to with respectful silence.

. 15. Such were the inhabitants of the territory of the United States, when dis-
covered by Europeans. Although inferior in intellectual cultivation and
approaches to the arts of civilization, to the native inhabitants of Mexico‘ and
South America, they possessed greater personal manliness and vigor. They
we-re almost all Wanderers, and roamed over the vast solitudes of a fertile con-
tinent, free as the air, and unmindfulof the wealth in the soil under their feet.
The great garden of the western world needed tillers, and white men came.
They have thoroughly changed the condition of the land and the people. The
light of civilization has revealed, and industry has developed, vast treasures in
the soil, while before its radiance the aboriginals are rapidly melting like snow
in the sunbeams. A few generations’ will pass, and no representative of the

v North American Indian will remain upon the earth.

THE ALGONQUINS.

,1." The French gave the name of ALGONQUIN, to an extensive tribe of Indians’
upon the Ottawa river in Canada, and it was afterward applied to that great

collection of tribes north and south of the lakes,9 who spoke dialects3 of the sa.me V

language. They inhabited the territory now included in all of Canada, New
England, a part of New York and Pennsylvania,'the States of New Jersey,
Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, Eastern North Carolina above Cape Fear, a
large ‘portion of Kentucky and Tennessee, ‘and all north and west of these States,
eastward of the Mississippi. , - V .

2. The ALGONQUIN nation was composed of several powerful tribes, the most
important of which were the Knisteneaax in the fa.r north, the Oiiawas, Chippe-
was, Sacs and Foxes, ll/fenomonees, Jlfiamies, Pianlceshaws, P0zfzfawai0mies,- Kicka-
poos, Illinois, Shawnees, Powhaz.‘-ans, Oorees, Nanticokes, Lenni-Lenapes or Dela-
wares, Jlfoliegans, the New England Indians, and the Abenakes. There were
smaller, independent tribes, the principal of which were Sasqaehannocks, on the
Susquehanna in Pennsylvania; the Mannahoacks, in the hill ‘country between
the York and Potomac rivers, and the Monoeaizs, on the head waters of the
James river in Virginia. All of these tribes‘ were divided into cantons or clans,
sometimes so small as to afford only a war party. ‘

3. The KNIST-ENEAUX yet (1854) inhabit a domain extending across the conti-

' nent from Labrador to the Rocky Mountains, and are the hereditary enemies of

ﬁcient pretence forasserting his authority, and producing annoyances. Berk»
eley had become disgusted, and sold his interest in the province [March 28,
1674] to Edward Byllinge, an English Quaker. Pecuniary embarrassment
caused Byllinge to assign his interest to William Penn [1675] and two others.‘
These purchasers, unwilling to maintain a political union with other parties, suc-
cessfully negotiated with Carteret for a division [July 11, 1676] of the- province.
Carteret received the eastern portion as his share, and the Quakers the Western
part. From that time the divisions were known as EAST and WEST JERSEY.

5. The proprietors of WEST JERSEY gave the people a remarkably liberal con-
stitution of government [March 13, 1677] ; and in 1677, more than four hundred
Quakers came from England and settled below the Raritan. Andros required
them toacknowledge the authority of the duke of York. They refused ; and the
matter was referred to the eminent Sir William Jones for adjudication, who
decided against the claims of the duke. The latter submitted to the decision,
released both provinces from allegiance to him, and the J ERSEYS became inde-
pendent of foreign control. The ﬁrst popular assembly in West Jersey met at
Salem in November, 1681, and adopted a code of laws for the government of the

eop1e.2

6. After the death of Oarteret [Dec. 1679], the trustees of his estate offered
East Jersey for sale. It was purchased by William Penn a.nd eleven of his
brethren [Feb. 11, 1682], who obtained a new charter, and appointed [July
27, 1683] Robert Barclay,3 a very eminent Quaker preacher, from Aberdeen,
governor for life. A large number of his sect came from Scotland and England;
and others from New England a.nd Long Island settled in East Jersey to enjoy
prosperity and repose. But repose, as well as the administration of Barclay, was
of short duration; for when James succeeded Charles,4 he appeared to consider
his contracts made while duke, not binding upon his honor as king. He sought
to annul the American charters, and succeeded, as we ha.ve seen, in subverting
the governments of several,-5 through the instrumentality of Andros. The J ER-
SEYS were sufferers in this respect, a11d were obliged to bow to the tyrant..

7. When Andros was driven from the country in 1689,‘? the Jerseys were
left without regular governments, and for more than twelve years anarchy pre-
vailed in those provinces. The claims of the proprietors to jurisdiction, were
repudiated by the people; and in 1702, they gladly relinquished the govern-
ment by surrendering it [April 25] to the crown.7 The two provinces were
united as a royal domain, and placed under the government of Lord C-ornbury
[July], the‘ licentious ruler of New York.8

8. New Jersey remained a dependency of New York, with a distinct legisla-
tive assembly of its own, until 1738, when, through the efforts of Lewis Morris,9
the connection was forever severed. Morris was appointed the ﬁrst royal gov-

son, murder and theft, the aggrieved party should have power to pardon the offender.

3. He was the author of “An Apology for Quakers,” a work highly esteemed by his sect. It was
written in Latin, and translated into several continental languages. Barclay and Penn were intimate
personal friends, and travelled much together. He died in Ury, in 1690, aged 42 years.

SECTION Vlll.
PENNSYLVANIA. [1682]

1." Pennsylvania began its colonial career when, in the Autumn of 1682,
Vlfilliam Penn arrived,1 and _by a surrender by the agents of the _Duke of York,
and a proclamation in the presence of the popular Assembly, the Territories which
now constitute the State of Delaware, were united with his province? Already
he had proclaimed his intention of being governed by the law of kindness3 in his
treatment of the Indians; and when he came, he proceeded to lay the foundation
of his new State upon Truth and Justice. Where the Kensington portion of
the city of Philadelphia now stands, he met the Delaware chiefs in council,
under the leaﬂess branches of a wide-spreading elm4 [Nov. 4, 1682], and there
made with them a solemn covenant of peace and friendship, and paid them the
stipulatedlprice for their lands. “We meet,” he said, “on the broad pathway
of good faith and good will; no advantage shall be taken on either side, but all
shall be openness and love.” The Indians were delighted, and their hearts
melted with good feeling. Such treatment was an anomaly in the history of the
intercourse of their race with the white people. Even then the ﬁres of a disas-
trous war were smoulderingon the New England frontiers.5 It was wonderful
how the savage heart, so lately the dwelling of deepest hatred toward the white
man, became the shrine of the holiest attribute of our nature. “We will live
in love with William Penn\and his children,” they said, “as long as the moon
and the sun shall endure.” They were true to their promise——not a drop of
Quaker blood was ever shed by an Indian. ’ _ g s

-2. Soon after Penn’s arrival,5 he proceeded to lay out a capital city [Nov. 1682],
upon lands purchased from the Swedes, lying between the Delaware and the
Schuylkill rivers. The boundaries of streets were marked upon the trunks of
the chestnut, walnut, pine, and other forest trees which covered the land,7 and
the city was named Philadelphia, which signiﬁes brotherly love. Within twelve
months almost a hundred houses were erected,8 and the Indians came daily

<tlians,dapﬁ1 Penn himself had addressed a letter to them, assuring them of his love and brotherly feelings

owar em.

4. The Penn Society of Philadelphia erected a monument upon the spot where the venerable elm stood,
near the intersection of Hanover and Beach streets. The tree was blown down in 1810, and was found
to be 288 years old. The monument is near the intersection of Hanover and Beach streets, Kensington.

7. This fact was the origin of the names of Chestnut, Walnut, Pine, Spruce and other streets in Phil-
adelphia. Eor many years after the city was laid out, these street marks remained. and afforded shade
to the inhabitants. , '

3-_ Markham, Penn's agent, erected a house for the proprietor’s use, in 1682. It is yet [1854] standing in
Letitia court, the entrance to which is from Market street, between Front and Second streets. Another, and
ﬁner house was occupied by Penn in 1700. It yet remains on the corner of Norris’s alley and Second
street. It was the residence of General Arnold in 1778. Note 6, p. 209. ‘ ‘

'7 3. Penn convened a second Assembly at Philadel-
- phia, in March, 1683, and then gave the people a
 “ Charter of Liberties,” signed and sealed by his own
hand. It was so ample and just, that the government
was really a representative democracy. Free religious
toleration was ordained, and laws for the promotion
of public and private morality were framed.‘ Unlike
other proprietors, Penn surrendered to the people his rights in the appointment
of ofﬁcers, and until his death, his honest and highest ambition appeared to be
to promote the happiness of the colonists. Because of this happy relation be-
tween the people and the proprietor, and the security againstlndian hostilities,
Pennsylvania outstripped all of its sister colonies in rapidity of settlement and
permanent prosperity. _
4. Penn returned to England in August, 1684, lea.ving ﬁve members of the

     

PENN’S House.

Council, and Thomas Lloyd, as president, to administer the government during 

his absence. Soon afterward, the English Revolution occurred [1688] and king
James was driven into eXile.2 Penn’s personal regard for James continued after
his fall; and for that loyalty, which had a deeper spring than mere political
considerations, he was accused of disaﬁection to the new government,3 and suf-
fered imprisonments. In the meanwhile, discontents had sprung up in Pennsyl-
vania, and the “ three lower counties on the Delaware,”4 offended at the action
of some of the Council, withdrew [April 11,1691] from the Union.5 Penn
yielded to their wishes so far as to appoint a separate deputy governor for them.

5. Penn’s provincial government was taken from him in 1692 [Oct. 31], and
Pennsylvania was placed under the authority of governor Fletcher, of New
York, who reunited the Delaware counties [May, 1693], to the parent province.
All suspicions of Penn’s disloyalty having been removed in 1694, his chartered
rights were restored to him [Aug. 30], and he appointed his original agent, Wil-
liain Markham, deputy governor. He returned to America at the close of 1699
[Dec.], and was pained to ﬁnd his people discontented, and clamorous for greater
political privileges. Considering their demands reasonable, he gave them anew
charter, or frame of -government [Nov. 6, 1701], more liberal in its concessions
than the former. It was cheerfully accepted by the Pennsylvania people, but
those of the Delaware territories, whose delegates had alreadywithdrawn from
the -Assembly, [Oct. 20,] evidently aiming at independence, declined it.‘ Penn
acquiesced in their decision, and allowed them a distinct Assembly. - This satis-
ﬁed them, and their'ﬁrst independent legislature was convened at l,\Iewcastle in
1703. Although Pennsylvania and Delaware ever afterward continued to have
separate legislatures, they were under the same governor until‘ the Revolution
in 1776. -

1. It was ordained “that to prevent lawsuits, three arbitrators, to be called Peace Makers, should be
appointed by the "county courts, to hear and determine small differences between man and man; that
children should be taught some useful trade ; that factors wronging their employers should make satis-
faction and one-third over ; that all causes for irreligion and vulgarity should berepressed, and that no
man should be" molested for his religious opinions.

THE CAROALINAS. 123

6. Soon after adjusting difﬁculties, and granting the new charter, Penn re-
turned to England, Dec. [1'70l], and never visited America again. His depart-
ure was hastened by the ripening of a ministerial project for abolishing all the
proprietary governments in America. His health soon afterwards declined, and
at his death he left his American possessions to his three sons, (Thomas, John,
and Richard,) then minors, who continued to administer the government, chieﬂy
through deputies, until the War for Independence in 1776. Then the common-
wealth of Pennsylvania purchased all the claims of'Penn’s heirs in the province,
for about ﬁve hundred and eighty thousand dollars.

SECTION IX.
THE CAROLINAS. ([1665-_-1680].

1. When settlements within the domain of the Carolinas became permanent,2
and tides of emigration from various sources, ﬂowed thitherward, the propri-
etors began to have gorgeous visions of an empire in America, that should cut-
shine those of the old World. It then became their ﬁrst care to frame a consti-
tution of government with functions adequate to the grand design, and to this
task, the Earl of Shaftesbury, one of the ablest statesmen of his time, and John
Locke, the eminent philosopher, were called. They completed their labors in
March, 1669, and the instrument was called the Fundamental 00nst7}tuti0ns.3
It was in the highest degree monarchical in its character and tendency, and
contemplated the transplantation, in America, of all the ranks and aristocratic
distinctions of European_S0ciety.4 The spirit of the Whole thing was adverse to

the feelings of the people, and its practical. development was an impossibility ;,

so, after a contest between proprietors and colonists, for twenty years, the mag-
niﬁcent scheme was abandoned, and the people were allowed to govern them-
selves, in their own more simple way.5

2. The disorders which prevailed when the ﬁrst attempts were made to impose
Shaftesbury’s scheme of government upon the people, soon ripened into rebel-
lion, especially in the ixllbemarle or northern colony.“ Excessive taxation

1. On account of the expenses incurred in Pennsylvania, Penn was compelled to borrow $30,000, and

_ mortgage his province as security. This was the commencement of the State debt of Pennsylvania,

now (1854) amounting to about $40,000,000.

4. here were to be two orders of nobility ; the higher to consist of landgraves, nr earls, the lower of
caciques or barons. The territory was to be divided into counties, each containing 480,000 acres, with
one landgrave, and two caciques. There were also to be lords of manors, who, like the nobles, might
hold courts and exercise judicial functions. Persons holding 50 acres; were to be freeholders ; the ten-
ants held no political franchise and could never attain to a higher rank. The four estates of Proprietors,
Earls, Barons and Commons, were to sit in one legislative chamber. The Proprietors were always to be
eight in number, to possess the whole judicial power, and have the supreme control of all tribunals. The
Commons were to have four members in the legislature to every three of the nobility. Thus an aristo-
cratic majority was always secured, and the real representatives of the people, had no power. Every.re-

.lig1on was professedly tolerated, but the church of England, only, was declared to be orthodox. Such .

is an outline or the absurd scheme proposed for governing the free colonists of the Carolinas.

and commercial restrictions bore heavily _upon the industry of the people, and

engendered wide-spread discontent. This was fostered by refugees from Vir-
ginia, after Bacon’s rebellion [1676],1 who sought shelter among the people be-
low the Roanoke. They scattered, broad-cast, over a generous soil, vigorous
ideas of popular freedom, and a year after Bacon’s death? the people of the AZ-
beinarle County Oolong/3 revolted. The immediate cause of the the movement
was the attempt of the acting governor to enforce the revenue laws against a
New England vessel. Led on by John Gulpepper, a refugee from the CARTERET
County Colony of South Oarolina,4 the people seized the chief magistrate [Dec.
10, 1677] and the public funds, imprisoned him and six of his council, called a
new Assembly, appointed a new magistrate and judges, and for two years con-
ducted the affairs of government independent of foreign control. .

3. Oulpepper went to England to plead the cause of the people, and was ar-
rested and tried on a charge of treason. Shaftesbury procured his acquittal, and
he returned to the Garolinasﬁ Quiet was restored to the colony, and until the
arrival of the unprincipled Seth Sothel (one of the proprietors), as governor, the
people enjoyed repose. Thus early the inhabitants of that feeble colony practi-
cally asserted the grand political maxiin, that taxation without representation,
is tyranng/,5 for the defense of which our Revolutionary fathers fought, a century
afterward. - ‘

. 4. Sothel arrived in North Carolina in 1683. Martin says that “the dark ‘

shades of his characterwere not relieved by‘ a single ray of virtue;” and Chal-
mers asserts that “the annals of delegated authority included no name so in-
famous as Sothel.” He plundered the people, cheated the proprietors, and on
all occasions prostituted his office to purposes of private gain. After enduring
his oppression almost six years, "the people seized him [1689], and were about
sending him to_England to answer their accusations before the proprietors, when
he asked to betried by the colonial Assembly. The favor was granted, and he
was sentenced to banishment for one year, and a perpetual disqualiﬁcation for
the ofﬁce of governor. He withdrew to the southern colony, where we shall
meet him again.7 His successor, Philip Ludwell, an energetic, incorruptible
man, soon redressed the wrongs of the people, and restored order and good
feelings. Governors Harvey and Walker also maintained quiet and good will
among the people. And the good Quaker, John Archdale, who came to govern
both Carolinas in 1695, placed the colony in a position for attaining future pros-
perity, hitherto unknown. ' ’ ’ l ‘

5. While these events werevtranspiring in the northern colony, the people of
the O'arteret8 or southern colony, were steadily advancing in wealth and numbers.
Their first popular legislature of which we have records, was convened in 1674,9

, 5. Culpepper afterward became surveyor-general of the province, and in 1680, he was employed in
laying out the new city of Charleston [verse.6, p. 125]. His previous expulsion from the southern colony,
was on account of his connection with a rebellious movement in 1672.

9.’ The settlers brouglitwith them an unﬁnished copy of the “Fundamental Constitutions,” but they
at onceperceived the impossibility of ponfoi'mity to that scheme of government. They held a “ parlia-
mentary convention” in 1672, and twenty delegates were elected by the people to act with the governor
and council, as a legislature. Tliusearly, representative government was established, but its operations
seem not to have been very successful, and a legislature proper, of which we have any record_. was not
oi-ganipled until 1674, when an upper and a lower House was established, and laws for the province were
enacte .

cord. For a long time the colony was distracted by quarrels, and anarchy- pre-
vailed. At length the Stone Indians gathered in bands and plundered the
plantations of grain and cattle, and even menaced the settlers with destruction.
The appearance of this common enemy healed their dissensions, and the people
went out as brothers to chastise the plunderers. They completely subdued the
Indians, in 1680. Many of them were made prisoners and sold for slaves in
the'West Indies, and the Stones never afterward had a tribal existence.

6. Whilst thus annoyed by the Indians, many English families crossed the Ash-
ley and seated themselves upon the more eligible locality of Oyster Point, Where
they founded the present city of Charleston,‘ in 1680. There aﬂourishing village

morse in his old age, sought to gain the favor of heaven by bringing his whole people into the bosom of
._the Roman Catholic Church. He revoked the famous edict in 1686, and instantly the ﬁres of persecution
were kindled throughout the empire. Many thousands of the,Protestants left France and found refuge
in other countries. '

the proprietors, was appointed governor in 1686, and was vested with full pow-
ers to bring the colonists into submission. His administration of about four
years was a very turbulent one. He_ was in continual collision with the people,
and at length drove them to open rebellion. They seized the public records, im-
prisoned the secretary of the province, and called a new Assembly. Pleading
the danger of an Indian or a Spanish invasion,1 the governor called out the mi-
litia and proclaimed the province to be under martial law.2 This measure only
increased the exasperation of the people, and he was impeached, and banished
from the province [I690], by the Assembly.

9. It was in the midst of this turbulence and misrule, that Sothel arrived from
North Carolina, pursuant to his sentence of banishment,3 and the people un-
wisely consented to his assumption of the ofﬁce of governorﬂ They soon re-
pented their Want of judgment. For two years he plundered and oppressed
them, and then the Assembly impeached and banished him [1692]. Then came
Philip Ludwell to re-establish the authority of the proprietors, but the people,
thoroughly aroused, resolved not to tolerate even so good a man as he, if his
mission was to enforce obedience to the absurd Fundamental 00nst'o'tutz'ons.5
After a brief and turbulent administration, he gladly withdrew to Virginia, and

soon afterward, the proprietors abandoned Shaftesbury’s scheme [1693], and the

good Quaker, John Archdale, was sent [1695] to administer a more simple and
republican form of government, for both the Carolinas. _

10. Archdale’s administration was short, but highly beneﬁcial}? and the people
of South Carolina always looked back to the efforts of that good man, with
gratitude. He healed dissensions, established equitable laws, and so nea.rly ef-
fected an entire reconciliation of the English to the French settlers, that in the
year succeeding his departure from the province, the Assembly admitted the lat.-
ter [1697] to all the privileges of citizens and freemen. From the close of

Archdale’s administration, the progress of ..the two Carolina colonies should be,
considered as separate and distinct, although they Were not politically separated -

until 1729.7
' NORTH CAROLINA.

11. The permanent prosperity of North Carolina may be dated from the ad-
ministration of Archdale,3 when the colonists began to turn their attention to
the interior of the country, where richer soil invited ,the agriculturist, and the
fur of the beaver and otter allured the adventurous hunter. The Indians along
the sea-coast were melting away like -frost in the sun-beams. The powerful
Hatteras tribe,9 which numbered three thousand in Raleigh’s time, were reduced
to ﬁfteen bownien; another tribe had entirely disappeared, and the remnants of
some others had sold their lands or lost them by fraud, and were driven back to
the deep wilderness. Indulgence in strong drinks and other vices of civilization,

had’ decimated them, and their beautiful land, all the way to the Yadkin and
Catawba, was speedily opened to the sway of the white man.

12. In 1 7 05, religion began to exert an inﬂuence in North Carolina, and the ﬁrst
Anglican‘ church ediﬁce was then built in Chowan county. The Quakers? mul-
tiplied; and in 1707, a company of I—Iuguenots,3 who had settled in Virginia,
came and sat down upon the beautiful banks of the Trent, a tributary of the
Neuse river. Two years later [1709], ahundred German families, driven from
their homes on the Rhine, by persecution, penetrated the interior of North Caro-
lina, and under Count Grraffenried, ‘founded settlements along the .head waters of
the Neuse, and upon the Roanoke.

13. While settlements were expanding, and general prosperity blessed the
province, a fearful calamity fell upon the inhabitants of the interior. The broken
Indian tribes made a last effort, in 1711, to regain the beautiful country they had
lost. The leaders in the conspiracy to crush the white people, were the Tusca-
mmsi of the inland region, and the Comes? farther south and near the sea-board.
They fell like lightning from the clouds upon the scattered German settlements
along the Roanoke and Pamlico Sound. In one night [Oct. 2, 1711,] one hun-
dred and thirty persons perished by the hatchet. Along Albermarle Sound, the
savages swept with the knife of murder in one hand, and the torch of desolation
in the other, and for three days they scourged the white people, until disabled
by fatigue and drunkenness.

14. The people who escaped the massacre, called upon their brethren of the
southern colony for aid, and Colonel Barnwell, with a party of Carolinians and
friendly Indians of the southern nations,5 marched to their relief. He drove the
Tuscamoms to their fortiﬁed town in the present Craven county, and there made
a treaty of peace with them. His troops violated the treaty on their way back,
by outrages upon the Indians, and soon hostilities were renewed. Late in the
year [Dec., 1712], Colonel Moore7 arrived from South Carolina with a few white
men and a large body of Indians, and drove the Tuscaroms to their fort in the
present Grreene county, where he made [March 1713] eight hundred of them pris-
oners. The remainder of the Tuscawoms ﬂed northward in June, and joining
their kindred on the southern borders of Lake Ontario, they formed the sixth
nation of the celebrated IROQUOIS confederacy in the province of New York.8
A treaty of peace was made with the Corees in 1715, and North Carolina never
afterward suffered from Indian hostilities.9 '

SOUTH CAROLIN A.

15. Soon after the commencement of Queen Anne’s War, 10 [May, 1702], gov-
ernor Moore of South Carolina, proposed an expedition against the Spaniards at
St. Augustine.“ The Assembly assented, and appropriated almost ten thousand
dollars for the service. Twelve hundred men, (one half Indians) were raised,
and proceeded, in two divisions, to the attack. The main division under the
governor, went by sea, to blockade the harbor, and the remainder proceeded

along the coast under the command of-Colonel Daniels. The latter arrived ﬁrst,
and attacked and plundered the town. The Spaniards retired within their for-
tress with provisions for four months; and as the Carolinians had no artillery,
their position was impregnable. _

16. Daniels was sent to Jamaica, in the West Indies, to procure battery can-
non, but before his return, two Spanish ships had appeared, and so frightened
governor Moore that he raised the blockade, and ﬂed. Daniels barely escaped
capture, on his return, but he reached Charleston in safety. This ill-advised
expedition burdened the colony with a debt of more than twenty-six thousand
dollars,‘ for the payment of which, bills of credit were issued. This was the
ﬁrst emission of paper money in the Carolinas.

17 . An expedition against the Apalac/w'cm1« Indians (who Were in league with
the Spaniards), undertaken by governor Moore toward the close of the following
year [Dec. 1703], was more successful. Their chief villages were between the
Alatamaha and Savannah rivers. These were desolated. Almost eight hundred
Indians were taken prisoners, and the whole territory of the Apalachicms was
made tributary to the English.

18. The province had scarcely become tranquil after this chastisement of the
Indians, when a new cause for disquietude appeared. Some of the proprie-
tors had long cherished a scheme for establishing the Anglican ‘Church,-‘3 as the
State religion, in the Carolinas. When Nathaniel Johnson succeeded governor

,Moore, he found a majority of churchmen in the Assembly, and by their aid,
, the wishes of the proprietors were gratiﬁed. The Anglican Church was made

the established religion, and Dissenters3 were excluded from all public offices.

This was an usurpation of chartered rights, and the aggrieved party laid the

matter before the imperial ministry. Their cause was sustained; and by order
of Parliament, the colonial Assembly repealed the law of disfranchisement

[Nov. 1706], but the Church maintained its exalted position until the Revolu-

tion. .

19. The attack upon St. Augustine4 excited the ire of the Spaniards, . and an
expedition, composed of ﬁve French and Spanish vessels,5 wi_tl1 a large body of
troops, was sent from Havanna to assail Charleston, take possession of the prov-
ince, and annex it to the Spanish domain of Florida}? The squadron crossed
Charleston bar [May 1706], and about eight hundred troops were landed at dif-
ferent points. The people seized their arms, and led by the governor a.nd colo-
nel Rhett, they drove the invaders back to their vessels, after killing or capturing
almost three hundred men. They also captured a French vessel with its crew.
It was a complete victory. So the storm which appeared so suddenly and
threatening, was dissipated in a day, and the sunshine of peace and prosperity
again gladdened the colony. .

20. A more formidable tempest brooded over the colony a few years later,
when a general Indian confederacy was secretly formed, to exterminate the
whitepeople by a single blow. Within forty days in the spring of 1715, the
Indian tribes from the Cape Fear to the St. Mary’s, and back to the mountains,
had coalesced in the conspiracy; and before the people of Charleston had any

federated with the Oheorokeesﬁ 0atctwbas5 and 00ng0w"ees5 on the west, in all six
thousand strong; while more than a thousand warriors issuedfrom the Neuse
region, to avenge their misfortunes in the wars of 1712—’13.7 It was a cloud of
fearful portent, that hung in the sky; and the people were ﬁlled with terror, for
they knew not at what moment the consuming lightning might leap forth.

21. At this fearful crisis, governor Craven acted with the utmost wisdom and
energy. He took measures to prevent men .from leavingthe colony; to secure
all the arms and ammunition that could be found, and to arm faithful negroes to
assist the white people. He declared the province to be under martial law,8 and
then, at the head of twelve hundred men, black and white, he marched to meet
the foe who were advancing, with the knife, hatchet a.nd torch in fearful activ-
ity. The Indians were at ﬁrst victorious, but after several bloody encounters,
the Yamassees and their southern neighbors were driven across the Savannah
[May 1715], and halted not until they found refuge under Spanish guns at St.
Augustine. A The Oizerokees and their northern neighbors had not yet engaged
in the war, and they returned to their hunting grounds, deeply impressediwith
the strength and greatness of the white people.

22. Theproprietary government was now drawing to aclose. The governors
being independent of the people, were often haughty and exacting, and the in-
habitants had borne the yoke of their rule for many years, with great impa-
tience. While their labor was building up a prosperous state, the proprietors
refused assistance to them in times of danger, or re-imbursement of money ex-
pended in the protection of the province from invasion. The whole burden of
debt incurred in the war with the Yamasses, was left upon the shoulders of the
people. The proprietors not only refused to pay any portion of it, but enforced
their claims for quit-rents, with great severity. The people saw nohope in the
future, but in royal rule and protection. So they met in convention; resolved to
forswear all allegiance to the proprietors ; and on governor J ohnson’s refusal to act
as chief magistrate, under the king, they appointed [Dec. 21, 1719;] colonel
Moore9 governor of the colony. The matter was laid before the imperial gov-
ernment, when the colonists were sustained, and South Carolina became a royal
province.” - _ . . -

23. The people of the northern province“ also resolved on a change of gov-
ernment; and after a continued controversy for ten years, the proprietors sold to
the king [1729] for about eighty thousand dollars, all their claims to the soil
and incomesin both provinces. North and South Carolina were then separated.

Robert Johnson over the latter. From that period until the commencement of

the ESQUIMAUX, their neighbors of the Polar» Circle. The original land of the
OTTAWAS was on the west side of Lake Huron, but they were seated upon the
river bearing their name, when the French discovered them. They claimed
sovereignty over that region, and exacted tribute from those who passed to or
from the domainof the Humans} They‘ assisted» the Huronsin a war with the
FIVE N Angus? in 1650, and suffered much. The Hmfons were almost destroyed,
and the ()1€TAwAs were much reduced in numbers. Some of them, with -the
Huron remnant, joined the Olztppewas, and ﬁnally the whole tribe returned to
their ancient seat [1680] in the northern part of the Michigan peninsula. Under
their greatchief, Pontiac, they were confederated with several other ALGONQUIN
tribes of the_North-west, in an attempt to exterminate the white people, in
1763.3 Within a fortnight, in the Summer of that year, they took possession of
all the English garrisons and trading posts in the West, except Detroit, 1\I1agara,4
and Fort Pitt.-5 Peace was restored in 1764-5, the confederation was dissolved,
and Pontiac took up his abode with the Illinois, where he was murdered. His
broken nation sought refuge with the French, and their descendants may yet
[1854] be found in Canada.

4. The CHIPPEWAS and POTTAWATOMIES, were closely allied by language and
friendship. The former were on the southern shores of Lake Superior; the
latter occupied the islands and main land on the western shores of Green Bay,

when ﬁrst discovered byjthe French in 17 61. They afterwards seated them- ‘

selves on the southern shore of Lake Michigan [17 01], where they remained until
removed, by treaty, to lands upon the Little Osage river, westward of Missouri.
They are now [1854] the most numerous of all the remnants of the ALGONQUIN
tribes. The Oh-ippewcts and the Siouas, west of the Mississippi, are their deadly
enemies. " '

A the French at the southern extremity of Green Bay, in 1680. In .1712 the

French garrison of twenty men at Detroit,“ was attacked by the Foxes. The

, French repulsed them, with the aid of the Ozfzfawas, and

almost destroyed the assailants. They joined the Kicicapoos
in 1722, in driving the I Zlrinois from their lands on the river
of that .name. The .JZZz'ézois took refuge with the French,
and the Kickapoos remained on their lands until 1819, when
they went to the west bank of the Missouri in the vicinity
of Fort Leavenworth. The Sacs and Foxes sold their lands ‘
to the United States in 1830. Black Hawk, a Sac chief,
who, with his people, joined the English in our second war
with Great Britain,7 demurred, and commenced hostilities in _  ‘

SECTION X.
G E o R ex A. [1732].

1. Oglethorpe’s colony on the Savannah1 rapidly increased in numbers, and
within eight years, twenty-ﬁve hundred emigrants were sent over, at an expense
to the Trustees? of four hundred thousand dollars. Yet prosperity did not bless
the enterprise. Many of the settlers were unaccustomed to habits of industry,
and were mere drones; and as the use of slave labor was prohibited, tillage was
neglected. Even the industrious Scotch, German, and Swiss families who came
over previous to 17 40, could not give that vitality to industrial pursuits, which
was necessary to a development of the resources of the county.

2. Oglethorpe Went to England in 1734, and returned in 1736, with about
three hundred immigrants. Among them Were one hundred and ﬁfty Highland-
ers, well skilled in military affairs. These constituted the ﬁrst army of the
colony during its early struggles. John Wesley, founder of the Methodist de-
nomination, also came with Oglethorpe, to make Georgia a religious colony, and
to spread the gospel among the Indians. He was unsuccessful; for his strict
moral doctrines, his fearless denunciations of vice, and his rigid exercise of ec-
clesiastical authority, made him quite unpopular among the great mass of the
colonists, who winced at restraint. The eminent George Whiteﬁeld also visited
Georgia [17 38], when only twenty-three years of age, and succeeded in estab-
lishing an orphan asylum near Savannah, which ﬂourished many years, and was
a real blessing. The Christian efforts of those men, prosecuted with the most
sincere" desire for the good of their fellow-mortals, were not appreciated. Their
seed fell upon stony ground, and after the death of Whiteﬁeld [1 77 0,] his “House
of Mercy” in Georgia, deprived of his sustaining inﬂuence, became a desolation.

3. The rapid increase of the new colony excited the jealousy of the Spaniards
at St. Augustine, and the vigilant Oglethorpe prepared to oppose any hostile
movements against his settlement. He established a fort on the site of Augusta,
as a defence against the Indians, and he erected fortiﬁcations at Darien, on
Cumberland Island, at Frederica, (St. Simon’s Island,) and on the north bank of
the St. John, the southern boundary of the English claims. Spanish commis-
sioners came from St. Augustine to protest against these preparations, and to
demand the immediate evacuation of the whole of Georgia, and of all South
Carolina below Port Royal.3 Oglethorpe, of course, refused compliance, and
the Spaniards threatened him with war.

4. In the winter of 1736—7, Oglethorpe went to England, and returned _the
following Autumn [Oct. 1737], bearing the commission of a brigadier, and lead-

ing a regiment of six hundred well-disciplined troops, for the defence of the
Whole southern frontier of the English possessions.‘ But for two years their
services were not much needed; then war broke out between England and
Spain [Nov. 1739], and Oglethorpe prepared an expedition against St. Augus-
tine. In May, 1740, he entered Florida with four hundred of his best troops,
some volunteers from South Carolina, and alarge body of friendly Greek Indians,9
in all, more than two thousand men.

5. His ﬁrst conquest was fort Diego, twenty miles from St. Augustine. Then

fort Moosa, within two miles of the city, surrendered; but when he appeared _

before the town and fortress, and demanded instant submission, he was answered
by a deﬁant refusal. A small ﬂeetunder captain Price blockaded the harbor, and
for a time cut off supplies from the Spaniards, but swift-winged galleys3 passed
through the blockading ﬂeet, and supplied the garrison with several weeks’ pro-
visions. Oglethorpe had no artillery with which to attack the fortress, and
being warned by the increasing heats of summer, and sickness in his camp, not
to wait for their supplies to become exhausted, he raised the siege and returned
to‘: Savannah.

6. The Spaniards, in turn, prepared to invade Georgia in the summer of 1742.
An armament ﬁtted out at Havana and St. Augustine, consisting of thirty-six
vessels, with more than three thousand troops, entered the harbor of St. Simon’s,
and a little above the town of the same name, landed [July 16, 1742], a.nd erected
a battery4 of twenty guns. Oglethorpe had been apprised of the intentions of
the Spaniards, and after unsuccessfully applying to the governor of South Caro-
lina for troops and supplies, he marched to St. Simon’s, and made his head-quar-
ters at his principal fortress at Frederica. He was at Fort Simons, near the
landing place of the invaders, with less than eight hundred men, exclusive of
Indians, when the enemy appeared. He immediately spiked the guns of the
fort, destroyed his stores, and retreated to Frederica. There he anxiously awaited
hoped-for reinforcements and supplies from Carolina. ‘

7. Oglethorpe successfully repulsed several detachments of the Spaniards, who
attacked him at Frederica,5 and ﬁnally he resolved to make a night assault upon
the enemy’s battery, at St. Simon’s. A deserter (a French soldier) defeated his
plan; but the sagacity of Oglethorpe caused the miscreant to be instrumental in
driving the invaders from the coast. He bribed a Spanish prisoner to carry a
letter to the deserter, which contained information respecting a British ﬂeet that
was about to attack St. Augustineﬁ Of course the letter was handed to the
Spanish commander, and the Frenchman was arrested as a spy. The intelli-
gence in Oglethorpe’s letter alarmed the enemy; and while the ofﬁcers were
holding a council, some Carolina vessels, with supplies for the garrison at Fred-
erica, appeared in the distance. Believing them to be part of the British ﬂeet

4. A raised place on which cannons and mortars are arranged so as to oppose or attack an enemy.
These are frequently raised for the purpose of attacking forts at particular points ; and they sometimes

6. Oglethorpe addressed the Frenchman as if he was a spy of the English. He directed the deserter to
represent the Georgians as in a weak condition, to advise the Spaniards to attack them immediately,
and to persuade the Spaniards to remain three days longer, within which time six British men-of-War,
and two thousand men, from Ca-rolina, would probably enter the harbor of St. Augustine. ’

alluded to, the Spaniards determined to attack the Georgians immediately, and
then hasten to St. Augustine. On their march to assail Frederica,’ they Were
arnbuscaded in a swamp. Great slaughter of the invaders ensued, and the place
is still called Bloody Marsh. The survivors ‘retreated in confusion to their ves-
sels, and sailed immediately to St. Augustine.‘ On their way, they attacked
[July 19] the English fort at the southern extremity of‘ Cumberland Island,2 but
were repulsed with the loss of two galleys. The whole expedition was so dis-
astrous to the Spaniards, that the commander (Don Manuel de Monteano) was
dismissed -from the service. Oglethorpe’s stratagem saved Georgia, and, per-
haps, South Carolina, from utter ruin. ‘

8. Oglethorpe went to England in 1743, and never returned to Georgia, where,
for ten years, he had nobly labored to establish an attractive asylum for the
oppressed.3 He left the province in a tranquil state. The mild military rule
under which the people had lived, was now changed to civil government [17 43],
administered by a president and council,_under the direction of the Trustees,4
yet the colony continued to languish. Several causes combined to produce this
condition. We have already alluded to the inefﬁciency of most of the earlier
settlers, and the prohibition of slave labor.5 They were also deprived of the

. privileges of commerce and of trafﬁc with the Indians; and were not allowed the

ownership, in fee, of the lands which‘ they cultivatedﬁ

9. In consequence of these restrictions, there were no incentives to labor, ex-
cept to supply daily wants. General discontent prevailed. They saw the Car-
olinians growing rich by the use of slaves, and by commerce with the West
Indies. Gradually the restrictive laws were evaded. Slaves were brought from
Carolina, and hired, ﬁrst for a short period, and then for a hundred years,or for
life. The price paid for life-service was the money value of the slave, and the
transaction was, practically, a sale and purchase. Then slave-ships came to
Savannah directly from Africa; slave labor was generally used [1750], and
Georgia became a planting state. At the expiration of the twenty-one years
named in the patent,7 the trustees gladly resigned the charter into the hands‘ of
the king [17 52]; and from that time until the Revolution, Georgia remained a
royal province.

which were commenced within the space of about ﬁfty-six years [1607 to 1673].
By the union of Plymouth and Massachusetts,‘ and Connecticut and New
Haven,2 the number of colonies was reduced to thirteen, and these were they
which went into the revolutionary contest in 1775. -

2. Several European nations contributed vigorous materials for these colonies‘;
and people of opposite liabits,-tastes, and religious faith, became cominingled,
after making impressions of their distinctive characters where their influence
was ﬁrst felt. . England furnished the largest proportion of colonists, and her
children always maintained sway in the government and industry of the whole
country; while Scotland, Ireland, Germany, Holland, France, Sweden, Den-
mark, and the Baltic region, contributed large quotas of people and other colon-
ial instruinentalities. Ghurchmen and Dissenters,3 Roman Catholics and
Quakers,4 came and sat down beside each other. For a while, the dissonance
of nations and creeds prevented entire -harmony, but the freedom enjoyed; the
perilsand hardshipsencountered and endured; the conflicts with pagan sav-
ages on one hand, and‘ of vhierarchal5 and governmental oppression on the
other, which they maintainedl-for generations, shoulder to shoulder, diffused a
brotherhood of feeling throughout the whole social body of the colonists,_and re-
sulted in harmony, sympathy and love. And when, as children of one family,
they loyally-defended the integrity of Great Britain (then become the “mother
country” of nearly all) against the aggressions of the French and Indians‘? [1756
to 1763], and yet were compelled, by the unkindness of that mother, to sever
the ﬁlial bond,7 [1776] their hearts beat as with one pulsation, and they struck
the dismembering blow as with one hand. 1 _

3. The character of the people of the several colonies, differed according to

_ their origin and the influence of climate and pursuits. The Virginians and their .
southern neighbors, enjoying a mild climate, productive of tendencies to volup-

tuousness and ease, were from those classes of English society where a lack of
rigid moral discipline allowed free living and its attendant vices. They gener-
ally exhibited less moral restraint, more hospitality, and greater frankness and
social reﬁnement than the people of New England. The latter were from among
the middle classes, and included a great many religious enthusiasts, possessing
more zeal than knowledge. They were extremely strict in their notions; very
rigid in manners, and jealous of strangers. Their early legislation, recognizing,
as it did, the most minute regulations of social life, often presented food for mer-

»riment.8 Yet their intentions were pure; their design was noble; and in a

5. Hierarchy is, in a general sense, apriestly or ecclesiastical government. Such was the original form
of government of the ancient Jews, when the priesthood held absolute rule. '

6. Chap. IV., Sec. xii., p. 137. . 7. Verse 10, p. 187. .

8. They assumed the right to regulate the expenditures of the people, even for wearing apparel, accord-
ing to their several incomes. The general court of Massachusetts, _on one occasion, required the proper
oliicers to notice the “apparel” of the people, especially their -“ ribands_and great boots.” Drinking
of healths, wearing funeral badges, and many other things that seemed improper, were forbidden. At
Hartford, the general court kept a constant eye upon the morals of the people. Freemen were compelled
to vote under penalty of a fine of sixpence ; the use of tobacco was prohibited to persons under twenty’
years of age, without the certificate of a_ physician, and no others were allowed to use it more than once a.
day, and then they must be ten miles from_any house. The people in Hartford were all obliged to rise
in the morning when the watchman rang his bell. These arebut a few of the hundreds of similar enact-
ments found on the records of the New England courts. In 1646, the legislature of Massachusetts passed
a law, which imposed the penalty of a ﬂogging upon any one who should kiss a woman in the streets.
More than a hundred years afterward, this law was enforced in Boston_. The captain of a British man-oi?
war happened to return from a cruise, on Sunday. His overjoyed wife met him at the wharf, and he
kissed her several times. The magistrates ordered him to be ﬂogged. The punishment incurred no ig-
nominy, and he associated freely with the best citizens. When about to depart, the captain invited the
magistrates and others on board his vessel, to dine. ~ When dinner was over, he caused all the magis-
trates to be ﬂogged, on deck, in sight of the town. Then assuring them that he considered accounts
settled between him and them, he dismissed them, and set sail.

habits frugal. .

4. The manners, customs, and pursuits of the Dutch, prevailed in New York,
and portions of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, even a century after the English
conquest of New Netherland2 [I664], and society had become permeated by
English ideas and customs. They were plodding money-getters; abhorred change
and innovation, and loved ease. They possessed few of the ‘elements of progress,
but many of the substantial.social virtues necessary to the
stabilityof a state, and the health of society.- From these the
Swedes and Fins -upon the Delaware 3._did not diifer much;
but the habits of the Quakers, who ﬁnally predominated in
West J erseyi and Pennsylvania,5 were quite. different. They
always exhibited a reﬁned simplicity andequanimity, without
ostentatious displays of piety, that wonesteem; and they
were governed by a ‘religious sentiment Without fanaticism,
which formed a powerful safeguard against vice and im-
morality. ' ’ .

5. The early settlers of Maryland“ were also less rigid
moralists than the New Englanders, and greater formalists in
in religion. They were more reﬁned, equally industrious, but
lacked the stability of character and perseverance in pur-
suits, of the.people of the East. But at the close of the period
we have been considering [1756], the peculiarities of the in-
habitants of each section, were_ greatly modiﬁed by inter-
migration, and a general conformity to the necessities of their
several conditions, as founders of new States in a wilderness. The tooth of
religious bigotry and intolerance had lost_its keennessand its poison, and when
the representatives of the several colonies met in a general Congress7 [Sept.
1774], for the public good, they stood as brethren before one altar, while the
eloquent Duche laid the fervent petitions of their hearts before the throne of
Omnipotence.8 . _ .

6. _Agriculture was necessarily the chief pursuit of the colonists, yet during
the time we have considered, manufactures and commerce were not wholly ne-
glected. Necessity compelled the people to make many things which their pov-
erty would not allow them to buy; and manual labor, especially-in the New
England provinces, ‘was digniﬁed from the beginning. The settlers came where

a throne and its corrupting inﬂuences were unknown, and where the idleness
and privileges of aristocracy had no abiding. place. In the magniﬁcent forests
of the New World, where a feudal lord‘ had never stood, they began a life full
of youth, vigor, and labor, such as the atmosphere of the elder governments of
the earth could not sustain. They Were compelled to be self reliant, and what
they could not buy from the workshops of England for their simple apparel and
furniture, and implements of culture, they rudely manufactured,2 and were
content.

7. Their commerce, too, had but a feeble infancy, and never, until they Were
politically separated from Great Britain [l7'76], could their interchange of com-
modities be properly digniﬁed with the name of Commerce. England early became
jealous of the independent career of the colonists in respect to manufactured ar-
ticles, and navigation acts 3 and other unwise and unjust restraints upon the ex-
panding industry of the Americans, were brought to bear upon them. As early
as 1636, a Massachusetts vessel of thirty tons made a trading voyage to the West
Indies; and two "years later [1638], another vessel went from Salem to New
Providence, and returned with a cargo of salt, cotton, tobacco, and negroes.4
This was the dawning of commerce in America. The Eastern people also en-
gaged quite extensively in ﬁshing, and all were looking forward to wealth from
ocean traffic, as well as that of the land, when the passage [1660] of the second
Navigation Act5 evinced the jealousy of Great Britain. From that period, the
attention of Parliament was often directed to the trade and commerce of the col-
onies, and in 1719, the House of Commons declared “that erecting any manu-
factories in the colonies, tended to lessen their dependence upon Great Britain.”

8. Paper, woolen goods, hemp and iron were manufactured in Massachusetts
and other parts of New England, as early as 1732, and almost every family made
coarse cloth for domestic use. Hats were manufactured and carried from one
colony to the other in exchange; and at about the same time, brigantines and
small sloops were built in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, and exchanged with
West India merchants for rum, sugar, wines, and silks.

9. Unwisely considering the increase of manufactures in the colonists to be
detrimental to English interests, greater restrictions were ordained. It was
enacted that all manufactories of iron and steel in the colonies, should be con-
sidered a “common nuisance,” to be abated within thirty days after notice being

1. Note'15 p. 45. . .

2. From the beginning of colonization there were shoemakers, tailors, and blacksmiths in the several
colonies. Chalmers says of New England in 1673: “ There be ﬁne iron works which cast no guns ,_no
house in New England has above twenty rooms ; not twenty in Boston have ten rooms each ; a dancing
school was set up here, but put down; a fencing school 1S allowed. There be no musicia.ns_ b_y ti ade.
All cordage sail-cloth, and mats, come from Eng-land° no cloth made there worth foui shillings per
yard 2, no alum, no copperas, no salt, made by their sun. _ I _ _ _

3. The ﬁrst Navigation Act [1651] forbade all iinportations into England, except in English ships, or
those belonging to English colonies. In 1660, this act was conﬁrmed, and unjust additions we}r?e made
to it. The colonies were forbidden to export their chief productions. to any country exceptdtol .ngfl_and
or its dependeréciesﬁ Sipnilarséicts, all bearing heavily upon colonial commeice, weie ma e aw, iom

4. This was the first introduction of slaves into _Ne_w_Ei_igland. The first slaves introduced intoftlie
English colonies, were those landed and sold _in Virginia in 1620, (See Note 6, p. 76). They wprs ii_st
recognized as such, by law, in Massachuset-ts,_in 1641 ; in Connecticut and Rhode Islfand, 1about_ 6.1i)0. in

of Delaware held some at about the same time. The introduction of slaves into the Carolinas, was coeval
with their settlement, and into Georgia about theyear 1750, when the people generally evaded the pro-
hibitory law. Verse 9, p. 132. A

given, or the owner should suffer a ﬁne of a thousand dollars.‘ The eXpOl‘l3-.

ation of hats even from one colony to another was prohibited, and no hatter
was allowed to have more than two apprentices at one time.“ The importation
of sugar, rum, and molasses Was burdened with exorbitant duties; and the Caro-
linians were forbidden to cut down the pine trees of their vast forests, and con-
vert their wood into staves,’ and their juice into turpentine and tar, for commer-
cial purposes.2 These unjust and oppressive enactments formed a part of that
“bill of particulars” which the American colonies presented in their account
with Great Britain, when they gave to the World their reasons for declaring
themselves “free and independent States.” -

10. Education received early and special attention in the colonies, particularly
in New England. Schools for the education of both white and Indian children
‘were formed in Virginia as early as 1621; and in 1692, William and Mary Col-
lege was established at Williamsburg.3 Harvard College, at Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts, was founded in 1637. Yale College, in Connecticut, was established
at Saybrook in 17 01,4 and removed to its present location, in New Haven, in
1717. It was named in honor of Elihu Yale, president of the East India Com-
pany, and one of its most liberal benefactors. The college of New Jersey, at
Princeton, called Nassau Hall, was incorporated in 1738.5

11. But the pride andglory of New England has ever been its ‘common
schools. These received the earliest and most earnest attention. In 1636, the
Connecticut legislature enacted a law which required every town that contained
ﬁfty families, to maintain a good school, and every town containing one hun-
dred householders, to have a grammar school.6 Similar provisions for general
education, soon prevailed throughout New England; and the people became re-
markable for their intelligence. The rigid laws which discouraged all frivolous

amusements, induced active minds, during leisure hours, to engage in readincr.

The subjects contained in booksthen in general circulation, were chieﬂy History
and Theology, and of these a great many were sold. A traveller mentions the
fact that, as early as 1686, several booksellers in Boston had “made fortunes
by their business.”7 - But newspapers, the great vehicle of general intelligence to
the popular mind of our day, were very few and of little worth, before the era
of the Revolution.8

1. A law was enacted in 1750, which prohibited the “ erection or contrivance of any mill or other en-
gine for slitting or rolling i_ron,_or any plating forge to work with a tilt hammer, or any furnace for
making steel in the colonies.” Such was the condition of manufactures in the United States, one hun-
dred years ago. Notwithstanding we are eminently an agricultural people, the census of 1850 shows
that we have in round numbers, $530,000,000 invested in manufactures. The value of raw materialis
estimated at $550,000,000. The amount paid for labor during that year, was $240,000,000, distributed
among 1,050,000 operatives. The value of manufactured articles is estimated at more than a thousand
millions of dollars I

2. For a hundred years the British government attempted to conﬁne the commerce of the colonies to
the interchange of their agricultural products for English manufactures only. The trade of the growing
colonies was certainly worth securing. From 1738 to 1748, the average value of exports from Great

8 Britain to the American colonies, was almost three and a quarter millions of dollars annually.

3. The schools previously established did not ﬂourish, and the funds appropriated for their support
were given to the college. .

4. In 1700, ten ministers of the colony met at Saybrook, and each contributed books for the establish-
ment of a college. It was incorporated in 1701. See note 13, p. 118. .

5. It was a feeble institution at ﬁrst. Iu 1747, governor Belcher became its patron.

6. These townships were, in general, organised religious communities, and had many interests in
common. - «

7. Previous to 1753, there had been seventy booksellers in Massachusetts, two in New Hampshire, two
in Connecticut, one in Rhode Island, two in New York, and seventeen in Pennsylvania."

8. The first newspaper ever printed in America was the Boston News Letter, printed in. 1704. The
next was established in Philadelphia in 1719. The first in New York was in 1725; in Maryland, in
1728 ; in South Carolina, in 1731 ; in Rhode Island, in 1732 ; in Virginia, in 1736 ; in New Hampshire, in
1753; in Connecticut, in 1755.‘, in Delaware, in 1761 ; in North Carolina, in 1763 : in Georgia, in 1763 ;

. and in New Jersey, in 1777. In 1850, there were published in the United States, 2,800 newspapers and

magazines, having a circulation of 5,000,000 of copies. The number of copies printed in that year was
about 423,000,000.

THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR. 137

12. Such were the people, and such their political and social condition, at the
commencement of the last inter-colonial _war, which we are now to consider,
during which they discovered their strength, the importance of a continental
union, and their real independence of Great Britain.‘

SECTION XII.
Frnn FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR. [1756—1'763.]

1. The ﬁrst three inter-colonial wars, or the conﬂicts in America between the
English and French colonies, already noticed,2 originated in hostilities ﬁrst de-
clared by the two governments, and commenced in Europe. The fourth and
last,,which resulted in establishing the supremacy of the English in America,
originated here in disputes concerning territorial claims.

2. For a hundred years, the colonies of the two nations had been gradually ex-
panding and increasing in importance. The English, more than a million in
number, occupied the seaboard from the Penobscot to the St. Mary’s, a thousand
miles in extent, all eastward of the great ranges of the Alleghanies, and far
northward toward the St. Lawrence. The French, not more than a hundred
thousand strong, made settlements along the St. Lawrence, the shores of the
great lakes, on the Mississippi and its tributaries, and upon the borders of the
Gulf of Mexico. They early founded Detroit [i683], Kaskaskia [1684], Vincen-
nes [1690], and_New Orleans [1'?17.] The English planted agricultural colonies;
the French were chieﬂy engaged in trafﬁc with the Indians. This trade, and the
operations of the Jesuit3 missionaries, who were usually the self-denying pion-
eers of commerce in its penetration of the wilderness, gave the French great in-
ﬁuence over the tribes of a vast extent of country lying in the rear of the Eng-
lish settlements.4

3. The ancient quarrel between the two nat.ions, originating far back in feudal
ages, and kept alive by subsequent collisions, burned vigorously in the bosoms
of the respective colonists in America, where it was continually fed by frequent
hostilities on frontier ground. They had ever regarded each other with ex-
treme jealousy, for the prize before them was supreme rule in the New World.
The trading posts and missionary stations of the French, in the far north-west,
and in the bosom of a dark wilderness, several hundred miles distant from the
most remote settlement on the English frontier, attracted very little attention,
until they formed a part of more extensiveoperations. But when, after the cap-

1. We have no exact enumeration of the inhabitants of the colonies ; but Mr. Bancroft, after a careful
examination of many official returns and private computations, estimates the number of white people in
the colonies at the commencement of the French and'Indian war, to have been about 1,165,000, dis-
tributed as ollows :—In New England (N. 13., Mass., R. I., and Conn.), 425,000 ; in the middle colonies
(N. Y., N. J., Penn., Del. and Md.), 457,000; and in the southern colonies (Va., N. and S. Carolina and
Geo.), 283,000. The estimated number of slaves, 260,000, of whom about 11,000 were in New England;
middle colonies, 71,000 ; and the southern colonies, 178,000. Of the 1,165,000 white people, Dr. Franklin
estimated that only about 80,000 were of foreign birth, showing the fact that emigration to America had
almost ceased. At the beginning of the Revolution, in 1775, the estimated population of the thirteen
colonies was 2,803,000. The documents of Congress in 177 5, gives the round number of 3,000,000.

ture of Louisburg‘ 1745], the French adopted vigorous measures for opposing
the extension of British power in America: when they built strong vessels at
the foot of Lake Ontario'2—made treaties of friendship with the _DeZawa7"e3 and
Shommee4 tribes—strengthened Fort N iagara-5——and erected a cordon of fortiﬁca-
tions, more than sixty in number, between Montreal and New Orleans—the
English were aroused to immediate and effective action in defence of the terri-
torial claims given them in their ancient charters. By virtue of these, they
claimed dominion westward to the Paciﬁc Ocean, south of the latitudeof the
north shore of Lake Erie; While the French claimed a title to all the territory
watered by the Mississippi and its tributaries, under the more plausible plea,
that they hadmade the ﬁrst explorations and settlements in that regions‘? The
claims of the real owner, the Indian, were lost sight of in the discussion.7

4. The territorial question was speedily brought to an issue. In 1749, George
the Second granted six hundred thousand acres of land, on the southeast bank
of the Ohio river, to a company composed of London merchants and Virginia
land speculators, with the exclusive privilege of traffic with the Indians. It was
called The Ohio Oompamy. Surveyors were soon sent to explore, and make
boundaries, and prepare for settlements; and English traders went even as far
as the country of the M/o'amz'es8 to trafﬁc with the natives. The French regarded
them as intruders, and seized [1753] and imprisoned some of them. Apprehending
the loss of traffic and inﬂuence among the Indians, and the ultimate destruction
of their line of communication between Canada and Louisiana, the French com-
menced the erection of forts between the Alleghany river and Lake Erie, near
the present western line of Pennsylvania.9 The Ohio Oomgocmy complained of
these hostile movements; and as their grant lay within the chartered limits of
Virginia, the authorities of that colony considered it their duty to interfere.
Robert Diiiwiddie, the lieutenant governor, sent a letter of remonstrance to
M. De St. Pierre, the French commander.” George Washington was chosen to
be the bearer of the despatch. He was a young man, less than twenty-two
years of age, but possessed much experience of forest life. He already held the
commission of adjutant-general of one of the four militia districts of Virginia.
From early youth he had been engaged in land surveying, and had become accus-
tomed to the dangers and hardships of the wilderness, and was acquainted
with the character of the Indians, and of the country he was called upon to
traverse.

5. The mission of young Washington involved much personal peril and hard-
ship. . It required the courage of the soldier and the sagacity of the statesman,
to perform the duty properly. The savage tribes through which he had to pass,
were hostile to the English, and the French he was sent to meet were national
enemies, wily and suspicious. With only two or three attendants,“ Washington

sta.rted from Williamsburgh late in Autumn [Oct. 31, 1753], and after journeying

' full four hundred miles (more than half the distance through a dark wilderness),

encountering almost incredible hardships, amid snow, and icy ﬂoods, and hostile
Indians, he reached the French outpost [Dec. 4] at Venangoﬂ He was politely
received, and his visit was made the occasion of great conviviality by the otﬁ-
cers of the garrison. Wine made the Frenchmen incautious, and they revealed
to the sober Washington their hostile designs against the English, which the
latter had suspected. '
6. After tarrying a day at Venango, Washington pushed forward to the head-
[quarters of St. Pierre, at Le .Boeuf.2 That officer entertained him politely during
four days, and then gave him a written answer to Dinwiddie’s remonstrance, en-
jveloped and sealed. Washington retraced his perilous pathway through the wil-
derness, and after an absence of eleven weeks, he again stood in the presence of
governor Dinwiddie [J an. 16, 1754], his mission fulﬁlled to the satisfaction of all.
His judgment, sagacity, courage, and executive force—qualities which eminently
ﬁtted him for the more important duties as chief of the Revolutionary armies, more
than twenty years afterwards [l775]—were nobly developed in the performance
of his mission, They were publicly acknowledged, and were never forgotten.
'7. During Washington’s absence, the legislature of Virginia had made an ap-
propriation of ﬁfty thousand dollars, for the support of troops to be led against
the French. The revelations made to Washington, and the tenor of St. Pierre’s

reply, conﬁrmed the suspicions of Dinwiddie, and showed the wisdom of the

legislative co-operation. St. Pierre said he was acting in obedience to the orders
of his superior, the Marquis du Quesne,3 at Montreal, and refused to withdraw
his troops from the disputed territory. Dinwiddie immediately prepared an eX-
pedition against the French, and solicited the co-operation of the other colonies.
It was the ﬁrst call for a general co onial union against a common enemy. All
hesitated except North Carolina. Its legislature promptly voted four hundred
men, and they were soon on the march for Winchester, in Virginia. Some vol-

unteers from South , Carolina and New York, also hastened toward the seat of -

future war. The Virginians nobly responded to the call, and a regiment was
soon organized, with 001. Joshua Fry as its commander, and Major Washington
as his lieutenant. The troops rendezvoused at Alexandria, and from that city,
Washington, at the head of the advanced corps, marched [April 2, 1754] toward
the Ohio. ‘

8. In the meanwhile, the Ohio Company had sent thirty men to construct a .

fort at the conﬂuence of the Alleghany and Monongahela rivers, now the site of
Pittsburg. They had just commenced operations [April 18], when a party of
French and Indians attacked and expelled them, completed the fortification, and
named it Du Quesne, in honor of the governor general of Canada.4 When intel-
ligence of this event reached Washington on his march, he hastened forward,
with one hundred and ﬁfty men, to a point on the Monongahela, less than forty
miles from Fort du Quesne. There he was informed that a strong force was
marching to intercept him, and he cautiously ﬂed back to the Great Meadows,
where he erected a stockade,5 and called it Fort Necessityﬁ Before completing

Mississippi.‘

7. The MIAMIES and PIANKESHAWS inhabited that portion of the Ohio lying be-
tween the Maumee river ofLake Erie, and the ridge which separates the head
waters of the Wabash from the Kaskaskias. They were. called Tunighzfwees by
the FIVE NATIONS, and English. Of all the Western tribes, these have ever
been the most active enemies of the United States.9 They have ceded their
lands, and are now [1854] far beyond the Mississippi. 7 .

8. The ILLINOIS formed a numerous tribe, twelve thousand strong, when dis-
covered by the French. They were seated upon the Illinois river, and consisted
of a confederation of ﬁve families, namely, Kaska-skids, Oaho/cias, Tamaronas, Mz'ch2'-
gamias and‘Pe0M'as. Weakened by internal feuds, the confederacy was reduced

to a handful, by their hostile neighbors. They ceded their lands in 1818, when’

they numbered only three hundred souls. A yet smaller remnant are now
[1854] upon lands west of the Mississippi. »

9. The SHAWNEES occupied a vast region west of the Alleghanies,3 and their

‘great council-house was in the basin of the Cumberland River. At about the
time when the English ﬁrst landed at Jamestown4 [I607], they were driven
from their country by more southern tribes. Some crossed the Ohio, and settled
on the Sciota, near the present Chilicothe; others wandered eastward into
Pennsylvania. The Ohio division joined the Ewes and Andaszfes against the
FIVE NATIONS in 1672. Suffering defeat, the Slzawnees ﬂed to the country of the
Catawbas, but were soon driven out, and found shelter with the C’7"eeks.5 They
ﬁnally returned to Ohio, and being joined by their Pennsylvania brethren, they
formed an alliance with the French against the English.5 They were subdued
by Boquet in 17 63,7 and again by Virginians, at Point Pleasant, at the mouth of
the great Kenawha, in 1774.8 They aided the British during the Revolution,
and continued to annoy the Americans until 1795, when‘ permanent peace was
established.9 They were the enemies of the Americans during their second war
with Great Britain. They are now [1854] but a miserable remnant, and occupy
lands south of the Kanzas river. The road from Fort Independence“) to Santa
Fe passes through their territory. , I .

it, a few of his troops attacked an advanced party of the French,,under J umon-
ville. They Were surprised at the dead of night [May 28], and the commander
and nine of his men were slain. Of the ﬁfty Who formed the French detachment,
only about ﬁfteen escaped. This Was the ﬁrst blood-sliedding of that long and

‘eventful conﬂict known as the French and Indian War.‘

9. Two days after this event [May 30], Colonel Fry died, and the Whole com-
mand devolved on Washington. Troops hastened forward to join the young
leader at Fort Necessity, and With about four hundred men ‘he proceeded to Fort
du Quesne. M. de Villiers, brother of the slain J umonville’, had marched at about
the same time, at the head of more than a thousand Indians and some French-
men, to avenge the death of his kinsman. Advised of his approach, Washington
fell back to Fo_rt Necessity, and there, on the 3d of July, he was attacked by al-
most ﬁfteen hundred foes. After a conflict of about ten hours, de Villiers pro-
posed an honorable capitulation.2 Washington signed it on the morning of the
4th, and marching out of the stockade with the honors of War, departed, with his
troops, for Virginia. “ '

10. During this military campaign, a civil_movement of great importance Was
in progress. The English and French governments had listened to the disputes
in America with great interest. At length the British ministry perceiving War
to be inevitable, advised the colonies to secure the continued friendship of the
SIX N A'1‘IONS,3 and to unite in a plan for general defence. All the colonies were
invited to appoint delegates to meet in convention at Albany, in the Summer of
1754. Only seven responded by sending delegates.4 The convention Was or-
ganized on the 19th of J une.5 Having renewed a treaty With the Indians, the

‘subject of colonial union Was brought forward. A plan of confederation, similar

to our Federal Constitution, drawn up by Dr. Franklin, Was submitted.“ It was
adopted on the 4th of July [17 54], and was orderedto be laid before the several
colonial Assemblies, and the imperial Board of Trade,7 for ratiﬁcation.8 Its fate
was singular. The Assemblies considering it too amstocmtzb-—giving the royal

- governor too much power-——refused their assent; and the Board of Trade rejected »

it because it was too dem0craz5tc.9 [Although a legal union Was not consummated,

"the grand idea then began to bud. It blossomed in the midst of the heat of the

Stamp Act excitement“) eleven years later [1765], and its fruit appeared in the

‘great Congress of 17 74.

1. It is known in European history as The Seven Years War‘. '

2. A mutual restoration of prisoners was to take place, and the English were not to erect any estab-

the New Jersey Assembly, advocated it in 1722. N ow it ﬁrst found tangible expression under the sanc-
tion of authority, * ‘

8. It proposed a general government to be administered by one chief magistrate, to be appointed by
the crown, and acouncil of forty-eight members, chosen by the several legislatures. This council, an-
swering to our Senate, was to have power to declare war, levy troops, raise money, regulate trade, con-
clude peace, and many other things necessary for the general good. The delegates from Connecticut
alone, objected to the plan, because it- gave the governor general veto power, or the right to refuse his
signature to laws ordained by the Senate, and thus prevent them becoming statutes. , ‘

9. The Board of Trade had proposed a plan which contained all the elements of a system for the utter
enslavement and dependence of the Americans. They proposed a general government, composed of the
governors of the several colonies, and certain select members of the several Councils. These were to
have power to draw on the British Treasury for money to carry on ‘the impending war : the sum to be
reimbursed by taxes imposed upon the colonists by Parliament. The colonists preferred to do their own
ﬁghting and levy their own taxes, independent of Great‘Britain.

FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR. 141

11. Soon after the close of this convention, the Indians commenced murderous
depredations upon the New England frontiers [August and September, 17 54] _;

and among the tribes west of the Alleghanies, French emissaries were ‘busy

arousing them to engage in a_- wa.r of extermination against the English, and yet
some of the colonies were tardy in preparations to avert the evil. ' Shirley was
putting forth energetic efforts in Massachusetts; New York voted $25,000 for

military service, and Maryland 3B30,000‘for the same. The English government _

sent over $50,000 for the use of the colonists, and with it a commission to gov-
ernor Sharpe, of Maryland, appointing him commander-in-chief of all the colonial
forces. Soon disputes about military rank and precedence, ran high. Wasliing-
ton resigned his commission, and the year [17 54] drew to a close without any
efﬁcient preparations for a conflict with the French.

CAMPAIGN OF 1755.

12. War had not yet been declaredby the two nations; and for more than
a year and a half longer the colonies were in conﬂict, before England and
France formally announced hostility to each other. In the meanwhile the Brit-
ish government extended its aid to its colonies. Early in 1755 [Feb. 20], Ed-
ward Braddock, an Irish officer of distinction, arrived in Chesapeake Bay with
two regiments of his countrymen. He had been appointed commander-in-chief
of all the British and provincial forces in America; and at his request, six colo-
nial governors‘ met in convention at Alexandria [April] to assist in making ar-
rangements for a vigorous campaign. Three separate expeditions were planned;
one against Fort du Quesne,2 to be led by Braddock; a second against Niagara
and Frontenac (Kingston), to be commanded by governor Shirley; and a third
against Crown Point, on Lake Champlain, under general William Johnson,3
then an influential resident among the Mohawk nation of the IROQUOIS confed-
eracy.4 Alreadya fourth expedition had been arranged by Shirley and govern-
or Lawrence of Nova Scotia, designed to drive the French out of that province,
and other portions of ancient Acadie.5- These extensive arrangements, ‘sanc-
tioned by the imperial government, awakened the most zealous patriotism of all
the colonists, and the legislatures of the several provinces, except Pennsylvania
and Georgia, voted men and supplies for the impending war. The Quaker As-
sembly of Pennsylvania was opposed to military movements; the people of
Georgia were too poor to contribute. '

13. The eastern expedition first proceeded to action. Three thousand men,
under general John Winslow“ sailed -from Boston on the 20th of May, 1755, and
landed at the head of the Bay of Fundy. There they were joined by Colonel
Monckton with three hundred British regulars7 from the neighboring garrison,
and that officer, having ofﬁcial precedence of Winslow, took the command.
They captured the forts of the French[June] without difficulty, and placed the

whole region under martial rule.‘ This was the legitimate result of war. But
the cruel sequel deserves universal reprobation. The total "destruction of the
French settlements was decided upon. Under the plea that the Acadians
would aid their French brethren in Canada, ..the innocent and happy people
were seized in their houses, ﬁelds and churches, and conveyed on board the
English vessels. Families were broken, never to be united; and to compel the
surrender of those who ﬂed to the woods, their starvation was insured by a
total destruction of their growing crops. The Acadians were stripped of every-
thing, and those who were carried away, Were scattered among the'English col-
onies, helpless beggars, to die heart-broken, in a strange land. In one short
month, their paradise had become a desolation, and a_happy people were crushed
into the dust.

14. On account of delays in obtaining provisions and wagons, Braddock did
not commence his march from Will’s Creek (Cumberland), until the 10th of
June, 177 5. His force consisted of about two thousand men, British and pro-
vincial. Anxious to reach Fort du Quesne before the garrison should receive
re-inforcements, he made forced marches with twelve hundredmen, leaving col-
onel Dunbar, his second in command, to follow with the
remainder, and the wagons. Colonel--Washington? had
consented to act as Braddock’s aid, and ‘to him was given
the command of the provincials. Knowing, far better
than Braddock, the perils of their march and the kind of
warfare they might expect, he ventured, modestly, to
give advice, founded upon his experience. But the haugh-
 ‘ ty general would listen to no suggestions, especially from
‘<5’ a provincial subordinate. This obstinacy proved his ruin.

15. When within ten miles of Fort du Quesne, and

FORT DU QUESNR marchingat noon-day [July 9], in fancied security on the
- south side of the Monongahela, a volley of bullets and a
cloud of ‘arrows asssailed the advanced guard, under lieutenant-colonel Grage.3
They came from a thicket and ravine close by, where a thousand dusky warriors
lay in ambush. Again Washington asked permission to ‘ﬁght according to the
provincial custom, but was refused. Braddock mustmanoeuvre according to Eu-
ropean tactics, or not at all. For three hours, deadly volley after volley fell
upon the British columns, while Braddock attempted to maintain order, where
all was confusion. The slain soon covered the ground. Every mounted ofﬁcer
but Washington, was killed or maimed, and ﬁnally the brave Braddock himself,
after having several horses shot under him, was mortally wounded.4 Washing-
ton remained unhurt.5 Under his direction the provincials rallied, while the
regulars, seeing their general fall, were ﬂeeing in great confusion. The pro-
vincials covered their retreat so gallantly, that the enemy did not follow. A

4._ Braddock was shot by Thomas Faucett, one of the provincial soldiers. His plea was self-preser-
vation. Braddock had issued a positive order, that none of the English should protect themselves be-
hmd trees as the French and Indians did. Faucett’s brother had taken such position, and when Brad-
dock perce_1ved it, he struck him to the earth with his sword. Thomas on seeing‘ his brother fall, shot
Eraddock 111 the back, and then the provincials, ﬁghting as they please , were saved from utter destruc-

ion. V - « A ‘ '

5. Dr. Craik, who was with Washington at this time, and also attended him in his last illness, says
that while in the Ohio country with him, ﬁfteen years afterward, an old Indian chief came, as he said,
“ a long Way” to see the Virginia colonel at whom he ﬁred his riﬂe ﬁfteen times during the battle on the
Monongahela, without hitting him. Washington was never wounded in battle. 7

week afterward Washington read the impressive funeral
service. of the Anglican Church,‘ over the corpse of
Braddock, by torch light [July 15, 1755]; and he was
buried where "his grave may now [1854] be seen near
the _National road, between the ﬁfty-third and ﬁfty-
fourth mile from Cumberland, in Maryland. Colonel
Dunbar received the ﬂying troops, and marched to Phi-
ladelphia [Aug.] with the broken companies. Washing-
ton, with the southern provincia-ls, went back to Vir-
ginia. Thus ended the second expedition of the cam-
paign of 1.755. .

16. The expedition against Niagara and Frontenac, 
under Shirley, though not so disastrous, was quite as
unsuccessful. It was late in August before Shirley had . -« '
collected the main body of his troops at Oswego, from GENE1W{BRADD00K-
whence he intended to go to Niagara, by water- His
force was twenty-ﬁve hundred strong on the ﬁrst of September, yet circum-
stances compelled him to hesitate. The prevalence of storms, and of sickness
in his camp, and ﬁnally the desertion of the greater part of his Indian.allies,2
made it perilous to proceed, and he relinquished the design. Leaving suﬁEi-
cient men to garrison the forts which he had commenced at Oswego,3 he
marched the remainder to Albany [Oct. 24], and returned to Massachusetts.

17 . General J ohnson’s expedition against Crown Point4 accomplished more
than that of Braddock-5 or Shirley,6 but failed to achieve its main object. In
July [1755] about six thousand troops, drawn from New England, New York,
and New Jersey, had assembled at the head of boat [navigation on the Hudson
(now the village of Fort Edward), ﬁfty miles north of Albany. They were under
the command of General Lyman7 of Connecticut; and before the arrival of gen-
eral Johnson in August, with cannon and stores, they had erected a strong for-
tiﬁcation, which was afterward called Fort Edward.3 On his arrival, John-
son took command, and with the main body of the troops, marched to the head
of Lake George, about ﬁfteen miles distant. ,

18. In the meanwhile, general Baron Dieskau, with about two thousand
men, chieﬂy Canadian militia and Indians, was approaching from Montreal,
by way of Lake Champlain, to meet the English.9 When Johnson arrived at
Lake George [Sept. 7], Indian scouts informed him that Dieskau was disem-
barking at the head of Lake Champlain (now the village of Whitehall),

CAMPAIGN or 1756.

21. The campaign of 1755, having assumed all the es-
sential features of regular war, and there ‘appearing no
prospect of reconciliation of the belligerents, England
formally proclaimed hostilities against France [May 17,

 

roar WILLIAM ‘HENRY.

1756], and the latter soon‘ afterward [June 9] reciprocated the action. Shir- '

ley, who had become commander-in-chief, after
the death of Braddock, was superseded by gen-
eral Abercrombie2 inthe Spring of 1756. He came
as the lieutenant of lord Loudon, whom the
king had appointed to the chief command in
America, and also governor of Virginia. Aber-
crombie arrived with several British regiments,
early in June. The plan of the campaign for
that year had already been arranged by a conven-
tion of colonial governors held at Albany early
in the season. Ten thousand men were to attack
Crown Point ;3 six thousand were to proceed
against"Niagara;4 three thousand against Fort
du Quesne ;5 and two thousand were to cross the
7 country from the Kennebec, to attack the French
Anmzcnomnm. settlements on the Chaudiere river.

. 22. General Winslowﬁ had been appointed to
the command of the expedition against Crpwn Point, and had ‘collected seven
thousand men at Albany, when Abercrombie arrived. Difﬁculties immediately
occurred, respecting military rank, and causeddelay. They were notadjusted
when_the tardy Loudon arrived; and his arrogant assumption of superior rank
for the royal otﬁcers, increased the irritation and discontent of the provincial
troops. When these, matters were ﬁnally adjusted, in August, the French had
gained such positive advantages, that the whole plan of the campaign was dis-
concerted.

23. The Marquis de Montcalm succeeded Baron Dieskau7 in the command of
the French troops in Canada. Perceiving the delay of the English, and count-
ing wisely upon the ineﬁiciency of their commander-in-chief, he collected about
ﬁve thousand Frenchmen, Canadians and" Indians, at Frontenac,8 and crossing
Lake Ontario, landed, with thirty pieces of cannon, a few miles east of Oswego.
Two days afterward, he appeared before Fort Ontario [Aug. 11, 1756], on the

east side of the river, then in command of colonel Mercer. After a short but
brave resistance the garrison abandoned the fort [Aug. J2], and withdrew to an
older fortiﬁcation, on the West side of the river} Their commander was killed,
and they were soon obliged to surrender themselves [A1_1g. 14] prisoners of
war. The spoils of victory for Montcalm, were fourteen hundred prisoners, a
large amount of military stores, consisting of small
arms, ammunition and provisions; one hundred and
thirty‘-four pieces of cannon and several vessels, large
and small, in the harbor. After securing them, he
demolished the forts,«‘3 and returned to Canada. The
whole country of the SIX NATIONS Was now laid op_en
to the incursions of the French. .

London, he re-called the troops then on their way to-
Wa.rd Lake Champlain; and all the other expeditions

borders of the Carolinas several military posts were established as a protection
against the Ohero/cees5 a.nd 0'7'ee7cs,7 whom French emissaries were exciting to
hostilities against_the English. The most important achievement of -the provin-
cials during that year, was the chastisement of the Indians at Kittaning, their
chief town, situated on the Alleghany river. During several months they had
spread terror and.desolation along the western frontiers of Pennsylvania and
Virginia, and almost a thousand white people had been murdered or carried
into captivity. Colonel John ‘Armstrong of 1 Pennsylvania,3 accompanied by
captain Mercer of Virginia, with about three hundred men, attacked them on
the night of the 8th of September [1756], killed their principal chiefs, destroyed
their town, and dispersed and completely humbled them.

 

CAMPAIGN or 1757.

_ 25. At a military council held at Boston early in 1757 [J an. 19], Lord Lou-
don proposed to conﬁne the operations of that year to an expedition against
Louisburg,9 and to the defense of the ‘frontiers.-« Because ‘hewas commander-in-

judgment and executive force. The people of New England, in particular, were
greatly disappointed when they ascertained that the execution of their favorite
scheme of driving the French from Lakeflhamplain, was to be ‘deferred. How-
ever, the general ardor of the colonists was not abated, and the call for troops
was so promptly responded to, that Loudon found himself at the head of six
thousand provincials-on the ﬁrst of June. ' ’

26. The capture of Louisburg was the earl’s ﬁrst care. He sailed from New

' York on the 20th of June, and on arriving at Halifax ten days afterward [June
30], he was joined by Admiral Holbourn, with a powerful naval armament ~

and ﬁve thousand land troops, from England- They were about to proceed to
Cape Breton,‘ when they were informed that six thousand troops were in the
fortress at Louisburg,“ and that a French ﬂeet, larger than Holbourn’s, was lying
in that harbor. The enterprise was abandoned, and London returned to New
York [Aug 31], to hear of defeat and disgrace on the northern frontier, the re-
sult of his ignorance and utter unskilfulness. Montcalm had again carried
away trophies of victory. . ' ‘ _ - - j

27. Toward the close of - July, Montcalm left Ticonderoga with about nine

"thousand" men (of whom two thousand were Indians), and proceeded to besiege

Fort_William Henry, at the head of Lake George.3 The garrison of three thou-
sand ‘men was ‘commanded by colonel Monro, a brave English ofﬁcer, who felt
strengthened in his position by the close ‘proximity of his chief, general Webb,
who’ was at the head of four thousand troops at Fort Edward,4 only ﬁfteen
miles distant. But his conﬁdence in his. commanding general was sadly,mis-
placed. When Montcalm demanded a surrender of the fort and garrison [Aug.
3, 1757], Monro boldly refused, and sent an express to general'Webb, _for aid.
It was not furnished. For six days Montcalm continued the siege, and expresses
Weresent daily to" Webb for reinforcements, but in vain. Even when general
J ohnson,5 with a corps of provincials and Putnam’s Rangers,6 had, on reluctant
per'm'is'sion, marched several miles in the direction of the beleagured fort, Webb
recalled them, and sent a letter to Monro, advising him to surrender.

28. Webb’s letter was intercepted by Montcalm,7 and with a peremptory de- '
mand for capitulation, hersent it to Monro. Perceiving further resistance to be.’
useless, Monro yielded. Montcalm was so pleased with the bravery displayed_j_.

by the garrison, that he agreed upon very honorable terms of surrender, and
promised the troops a safe escort to Fort Edward. Montcalm’s Indians,;__ex,pect-
ing blood ' and booty, were enraged by_the merciful terms, and at the mo-
ment when the English entered the forests a mile from Fort William
Henry,» the savages fell upon them with great fury, slaughtered a large number,

plundered their baggage, and pursued them to within cannon shot of Fort 

Edward. Montcalm declared his inability to restrain tlie Indians, and expressed
his deep sorrow. The fort and all its appendages were burned or otherwise
destroyed}? It was never rebuilt, and now [1854] nothing marks its site but an

been greatly exaggerated, and Montcalm was preparing to ﬂee. ~ -

LAKE GEORGE AND vicmmr. often cooled the zeal of "whole battalions of brave
Americans. Untrammelled by the orders, exactions
and control of imperial power, the Americans would probably have settled
the whole matter in a single campaign; but at the close of the second year of
the war [1756] the result appeared. more uncertain and remote than ever.
The people of England had perceived this clearly, and clamored for the dis-
missal of the weak and corrupt ministry then in power.’ The popular will
prevailed, and William Pitt, by far the ablest statesman England had yet pro-
duced, was calledto the control of ' public aﬂ"airs in June, 1757.
30. Energy and good judgment marked every movement of Pitt’s administra-
tion, especially in measures for prosecuting the war in America. Lord Loudon

was .recalled,2 and general Abercrombie3 was appointed "to succeed him.- A

strong naval‘ armanent was prepared and placed under the command of admiral

-Boscawen; and twelve thousand additional English troops. were allotted to the
-service in America.4 Pitt addressed a circular to the several colonies, asking

them to! raise and clothe twenty thousand men. He promised in the name of
Parliament, to furnish arms, tents, and provisions for them; and also to reim-
burse the several colonies, all the money they should expend in raising and
clothing the levies. These liberal offers had a magical effect, and an excess of
levies soon appeared. New England alone raised ﬁfteen thousand men;5 New
York furnished almost twenty-seven hundred, New Jersey one thousand, Penn-

of dollars‘. The taxes on real estate, in order to raise money, were enormous ; in many instances equal
to two-thirds of the income of the tax payers. Yet it was levied by their own representatives, and they
did not murmur. A few years later, an almost nominal tax in the form of duty upon an article of lux-
ury, levied without their consent, excited the people of that colony to rebellion. See verse 29, p. 169.

from other colonies. Royal American troops organized in the Carolinas, were
ordered to the North; and when Abercrombie took command of the army in the
Springof 17 58 [May], he found ﬁfty thousand. men at his disposal; a number.
greater than the whole male population of the French dominions in America, at
that time.‘

CAMPAIGN or 1758.

31. Louisburg,2 Ticonderoga,3 and Fort du Quesne,4 were the principal points
of operation speciﬁed in the plan of the campaign of 1758. .Boscawen arrived
at Halifax early in May, with (bout forty armed vessels bearing a land force of
‘ twelve thousand men, under General Amherst5 as
chief, and General Wolfeﬁ as his lieutenant. They
left Halifax on the 28th of May, and on the 8th of
June the troops landed, without much opposition,
on the shore of Gabarus Bay, near the city of’Lou-
isburg.7 The French almost immediately deserted
their outposts, and retired within the town and
fortress. After a vigorous resistance for almost
ﬁfty days, and when all their shipping in the har-
bor was destroyed, the French surrendered [July
26, 17 58] the town and fort, together with the
, H _ island of. Cape Breton and that of St. John (now

LORD ,,MEERST_ Prince Edward), and their dependencies, by capit-

ulation. The spoils of victory were more than ﬁve

thousand prisoners, and a large quantity of munitions of war. By this victory,

the English became masters of the coast almost to the mouth of the St. Lawrence.

When Louisburg fell, the power of France in America began to wane, and.from
that time its decline was continual and rapid. ;

32. While Amherst and Wolfe were conquering in
the East, Abercrombie and the young Lord Howe were
leading seven thousand regulars, nine thousand pro-
vincials, and a heavy train of artillery, against Ticon-
deroga, then occupied by Montcalm with about four
thousand men. Abercrombie’s army had rendezvoused
at the head of Lake George, and at the close of a calm
Sabbath evening [July 1758] they went down that
beautiful sheet of water in ﬂat-boats, and at dawn
landed at its northern extremity [July 6]. The whole
country from there to Ticonderoga was covered with TICONDEROGL
a dense forest, and tangled morasses lay in the path-
way of the English army. Led by incompetent guides they were soon bewil-
dered, and while in this condition, they were suddenly attacked by a French

Lower Virginia, it is believed that not one representative on earth remains, or
that one tongue speaks their dialect.

11. South of the Powhatans, on the Atlantic coast, were the Oorees, Ohemws
and other small tribes, occupying the land once inhabited by the powerful Hat-
teras} They were allies of the Tnscaroms in 1711, in an attack upon the
English,2 suffered defeat, and have-now disappeared from the earth. Their dia-
lect is forgotten. * _ '

12. The. N ANTIGOKES occupied the great peninsula between the Chesapeake
a.nd Delaware Bays. They were early made vassals, and ﬁnally allies on com-
pulsion, of the FIVE NATIONS. They left their ancient domain in 1710, occu-

pied lands upon the Susquehanna, in Pennsylvania, until the Revolutionary War .

commenced, when they crossed the Alleghanies, and joined the British in the
west. They are now [1854] scattered among many tribes.

13. The LENNI-LENAPEs,3 who are frequently called Delawares, comprised two
powerful divisions, namely, the Manse’ and the Delawares proper. The former
occupied the northern part of New Jersey, and a portion of Pennsylvania, and
the latter inhabited lower New Jersey, the banks of the Delaware below Tren-
ton, and the whole valley of the Schuylkill. The FIVE NATIONS subjugated
them in 1650, and brought them under degrading vassalage. They gradually
retreated westward before the tide of civilization, and ﬁnally a portion of them
crossed the Alleghanies, and settled in the land of the Hur0ns,4 on the Muskin-
gum, in Ohio. Those who remained in Pennsylvania joined the Shawnees,5 and
aided the French against the. English, during the French and Indian War!‘ In
17 68, they all went over the mountains, and the great body of them became

-friends of the British during the Revolution. They were at the head ofthe

confederacy of Western tribes who were crushed by Wayne in 17 94,7. and the
following year they ceded all their lands on the Muskingum, and seated them-
selves near the Wabash. In 1819, they ceded those lands also, and the remnant
now [1854] occupy a territory north of the Kanzas river, near its mouth.

14. The MOHEGANS were a distinct tribe, on the Hudson river, but the name
was given to the several independent tribes who inhabited Long Island, and the
the country between the Lenni-Lenapes and the New England Indians.“ Of
this family, the Pequods,9 inhabiting Eastern Connecticut, on the shores of Long
Island Sound, were the most powerful. They exercised authority over the
Montauics and twelve other tribes upon Long Island. Their power was broken
by the revolt of Uncas against his chief, Sassacus,1° a short time before the appear-
ance of the white people. The Manhattans were seated upon th&'Hudson, in
lower Westchester, and sold Manhattan Island, whereon New-York now stands,
to the Dutch.“ The latter had frequent conﬂicts with these and other River.

approaching. Deceived concerning the strength of ‘the French lines across the
neck of the peninsula on which the fortress stood,2 he pressed. forward to the
» attack without his artillery, and ordered his troops
to scale the breastworks [July 8], in the face of the
enemy’s'ﬁre. They proved much stronger than he
anticipated,3 and after a bloody conﬂict of four
heurs, Abercrombie fell back to Lake George,
leaving almost two thousand of his men dead or
wounded, in the deep'forest.4 He hastened to
his former camp at the head of the lake, and then,
on the urgent solicit-ation of colonel Bradstreet,
he detached three thousand men under that ofﬁcer,
to attack the French post at Frontenac.5 They
went by way of Oswego and Lake Ontario, and
two days after- landing [Aug 27, 17 58], captured
the fort, garrison, and shipping, without much
- - resistanceﬁ Bradstreet lost only three or four

a strong line of breastworks with batteries. This line was about a mile-north-west of the fortress, which
occupied the point of the peninsula. The ruins of the fort are yet [1854] quite picturesque. See page 157.

road, "farther north, over the mountains, instead of following the one made by
Braddock. I-Iis progress was so slow, that in September, when it was known
that not more than eight hundred men were at Fort du Quesne,1'Forbes, with
six thousand troops, was yet east of the Alleghanies. Major Grant, at the head
of a scouting party of Boquet’s advanced corps, wa-s attacked [Sept; 21], de-
feated, and made prisoner. Still Forbes moved slowly and methodically, and
it was November [N 0v. 8], before he joined Boquet with the main body, ﬁfty
miles from the point of destination. The approach of Winter, and discontent
of the troops, caused a council of war to decide upon abandoning the enterprise,
when three prisoners gave’ information of the extreme weakness of the French
garrison. Washington was immediately sent forward, and the whole army pre-

pared to follow. Indian scouts discovered the Virginians when they were within_

a day’s march of the fort, and their fear greatly magniﬁed the number of the
provincials. The French garrison, reduced to ﬁve hundred men, set ﬁre to the
fort [Nov. 24], and ﬂed down the Ohio in boats, in great confusion, leaving
everything behind them. The Virginians took possession the following day.
Forbes left a detachment of four hundred and ﬁfty men, to repair and garrison
the fort, and then hastened back to go into winter quarters. The name of Fort
du Quesne was changed to Fort Pitt, in honor of the great English statesinanﬁ

35. The campaign of 1758, resulted in great gain to the English. They had
effectually humbled the French, by‘ capturing three of their mostfimportant
posts,3 and by weakening the attachment of their Indian allies. Many of the In-
dians had not only deserted the French, but at a great council held at Easton, on
the Delaware, during the Summer [1758], had, with the SIX NATIoNS,4 made
treaties of friendship or neutrality with the English.5 The right arm of French
success was thus paralyzed, and peace was restored to the frontiers of Pennsyl-
vania and Virginia. .

CAMPAIGN or 1759.

I136. The ﬁnal. struggle was now at hand. Encouraged by the success of the .

campaigns just closed, Pitt conceived the magniﬁcent scheme of conquering all
Canada, and destroying, at one blow, the French dominion in America. That
dominion was now conﬁned to the region of the St. Lawrence, for more distant
settlements in the West and South, were like weak colonies cut oﬁ‘ from the
parent country. Pitt had the rare fortune to possess the entire conﬁdence and
esteem of the Parliament and the colonists. The former was dazzled by his
greatness; the latter were deeply impressed with his justice. He had promptly
reimbursed all the expenses incurred by the provincial Assemblies during the
campaign,5 amounting to almost a million of dollars, and they promptly seconded
his scheme of conquest, which had been communicated to them under an oath
of secrecy. - p

sand provincial troops at his disposal. A coinpeteut land and naval force was
also sent from England to eo-operate with the Americans, and the campaign
opened with brilliant prospects for the colonies. The general plan of operations
against Canada, was similar to that of Phipps and I/Vinthrop in 1690.‘ A strong
land and naval force under general Wolfe, was to ascend the St. Lawrence and

attack Quebec. Another force under Amherst, was to drive the French from

Lake Champlain, seize Montreal, and join Wolfe at Quebec; and a third expe-
dition, commanded by general PrideauX,? was to capture fort Niagara, and then
hasten down lake Ontario to Montreal.

38. General Amherst appeared before Ticonderoga With eleven tliousand
men, on the 22d of July, 1759. The French commander had just heard of the
arrival of Wolfe at Quebec [June 27], and offered no resistance. The garrison left
the lines [July 23], and retired within the fort, and three days afterward [July 26],
they abandoned that also, partially demolished it, and ﬂed to Crown Point.3 Am-
herst pursued them, and on his approach, they took to their boats [Aug 1],
and went down the lake to Isle Aux Noix,4 in the Sorel
river. Amherst remained at Crown Point long enough to
construct a suﬁicient number of rude boats to convey his
troops, artillery, and baggage, and then started to drive his
enemy before him, across the St. Lawrence. It was now mid
autumn. [Oct. 11], and heavy storms compelled him to return
to Crown Point, and place his troops in winter quartersﬁ

Landing without opposition [July 17, 1759], he im-
mediately commenced the siege. He was killed the
same day by the bursting of a gun, and was succeeded
in command by general Johnson. The beleaguered
garrison, in daily expectation of reinforcements which
had been ordered from the southern and western
forts, held out bravely for three weeks, when the
expected troops appeared [July 24]. They were

regulars, and the remainder India.ns, many of them » -  «— .

victorious. They suffered from cold and hunger while on their return, and many were left dead in the

day [July 25], Fort Niagara and its dependencies, and the garrison of seven
hundred men, were surrendered to Johnson. The connecting link of French
military posts between Canada and Louisiana,‘ was effectually broken, never

two line-of-battle ships, and as many frigates and smaller armed vessels, com-—

manded by Admirals Holmes and Saunders, and toward the close of June [June

declivities of a high peninsula; the latter lying
upon a narrow beach at the edge of the water.

dered to force a passage across the Montmorenci, and co-operate with him, but
Monckton was too eager for attack, to await their coming. He‘ unwisely
rushed forward, but was soon repulsed, and compelled to.take shelter behind
a block-house‘ near the beach, just as a heavy thunder-storm, which had been
gathering for several hours, burst upon the combatants. Night ‘came on before it
ceased, and the roar of the rising tide warned the English to take to their boats.
Five hundred of their number had perished.

42. Eight weeks elapsed, and yet the English had gained no important adé.

vantages. Wolfe had received no intelligence from Amherst, and the future
appeared‘ gloomy. The exposure, fatigue, and anxiety which he had endured,
produced a violent fever, and at the beginning of September [1759], he lay pros-
trate in his tent.. He called a council of war at his bedside, and on the sugges-
tion of Townshend, it was resolved to scale the heights of Abraham,9 and assail
the town on its weakest side. Wolfe hear'tily approved of the design. A plan
was speedilymatured, and feeble as he was, the commander-in chief determined
to lead the assault in person. The camp at.the Montmorenci was broken up
[Sept. 8], and the attention of Montcalm was directed from the real designs of
the English, by seeming preparations to again attack his lines. The affair was
managed so secretly and skilfully, that even De Bourgainville, who ‘had been
sent up the St. Lawrence, with_ ﬁfteen hundred men, to watch_the movements of
the English, had no suspicion of their designs.‘ .

43. On the evening of the 12th of September, the attacking party ascended
the river in several vessels of the ﬂeet; and at midnight, they embarked in ﬁat
boats, with muffled cars, and moved silently down to the mouth of a ravine, a
mile and a half from the city, and landed.3 A At dawn [Sept. 13], lieutenant-
colonel Howe4 led the van up the tangled ravine, in the face of a sharp ﬁre from
a guard above.’ He was followed by the generals and the remainder of the

’ troops, ‘with artillery; and at sunrise the whole army stood in battle array upon

the Plains of Abraham.-5 It was an apparition, little anticipated by the vigilant
Montcalm. _ ~

44. The French commander" perceived the peril of the city; and marching
his whole army immediately from his encampment, crossed the St. Charles,‘ and
between nine and ten o’clock in the morning [Sept. 13], confronted the English.
A general, ﬁerce, and bloody battle now ensued.‘ Although twice severely
wounded, Wolfe kept his feet; and as. the two armies closed upon each other,
he placed himself at the head of his grenadiers, and led them to a charge.
At that moment a bullet entered his breast. He was carried to the rear; and a
few moments afterward, Monckton, who took the command, also fell, severely
wounded. Townshend continued the ‘battle. Montcalm soon received a
fatal wound;5‘ and the French, terribly pierced by English bayonets, and

with six frigates and a strong land force. General Murray marched out, and

met him at Sillery, about three miles above Quebec, and there was fought [April
28, 1760] one of the most sanguinary battles of the war. Murray was de-
feated. . He lost all his artillery, and about a thousand men, but succeeded in
retreating to thecity with the remainder. Levi now laid siege to Quebec, and
Murray’s condition was becoming perilous, from the want of" supplies, when

-an" English squadron, with reinforcements and provisions, appeared [May 9] in
the St. Lawrence. Levi supposed it to be the whole British ﬂeet, and at once 7

raised the seige [May 10], and ﬂed to Montreal, after losing most of his shipping.
47. The last stronghold of the French was now to be assailed; and Vaudreuil
gathered all his forces at Montreal for the ﬁnal struggle. Amherst made exten-

-sive preparations during the Summer; and early in September [Sept. 6-7], three

English armies met before the doomed city. Amherst, at the head of ten
thousand troops, and a thousand warriors of the SIx NATIONS, under general
Johnson,9 arrived on the 6th, and was joined, the same day, by general Murray
and four thousand troops, from Quebec. The next day, colonel Haviland ar-
rived, with three thousand troops, from Crown Point,3 having taken possession
of Isle Aux-Noix,4 on the way. Against such a crushing force, resistance would
be vain; and Vaudreuil immediately signed a capitulation [Sept. 8, 1760], sur-
rendering Montreal and all other French posts in Canada, into the hands of the
English.5 The regular troops, made prisoners at Montreal, were tovbe sent to
France; and the Canadians were guarantied perfect security in person, property

10, 1763], by which France ceded to Great Britain all her claimed possessions
in America, eastward of the Mississippi, north of the latitude" of Iberville river.2
At the same time, Spain, with whom the English had been at war for a year
previously, ceded [Feb. 10, 1763] East and West Florida to the British crown.
And now, England held undisputed possession (except by the Indians) of the
whole Continent, from the shores. of the Gulf of Mexico to the frozen North, and
from ocean to ocean.3

49. While‘ the English were crushing the power of _the French on the north,
the frontier settlements" of the Carolinas were suifering dreadfully from .frequent
incursions of Indian war parties. French emissaries were busy among the
Cherokees, hitherto the treaty friends of the English; and their inﬂuence, and
some wrongs inﬂicted upon the Indians by some frontier Virginia rangers, pro-
duced hostilities, and a ﬁerce war was kindled in March of 1760.4 The whole
frontier of the Carolinas was desolated in the course of a few weeks. Amherst
heeded the supplications of the colonists for aid; and in April, colonel Montgom-
ery, with some British regulars and provincial troops, marched from Charles-
ton, South Carolina, and laid waste a portion of the Oherokee country.5 ‘ Yet
those bold aboriginal highlanders were not subdued; but when, the following
year, colonel Grant led a stronger force against them,6 burned theirtowns,
desolated theirﬁelds, and killed many of their warriors, they humbly sued for
peace [J une, 17 61], and ever afterward remained comparatively quiet.

50. Scarcely had the storm ceased in the South, when another, more porten-
tous and alarming, gathered in the North-west. Pontiac, a sagacious chief of
the Otiawasﬂ who had been an early ally of the French, secretly confeder-
ated several of ‘the ALGONQUIN tribes [17 63], for the purpose of expelling the

‘English from the country west of the Allegham'es.8 After the fall of Montreal,9
‘he had professed an attachment to the English; and as there seemed safety for

‘settlers west of the mountains, emigration began to pour its living streams over
those barriers. Like Philip of Mount Hope,” Pontiac saw, in the future, visions
of the displacement, perhaps destruction, of his race, by the pale-faces; and he
determined to strike a blow for life and country. So adroitly were his plans
matured, that the commanders of the-western ‘forts had no suspicions of his con-
spiracy until it was ripe, and the ﬁrst blow had been struck [June 1763].

51. We have now arrived at a point in the _history of the United States, of
great interest and importance. We have traced the growth of the colonies
through infancy and youth, their interests and destinies gradually commingling,
until they really formed one people,4 strong and lusty like the mature man, pre-
pared to vindicate natural rights, and to fashion political and social systems
adapted to their position and wants. We view them now, conscious of their
physical and moral strength, possessing clear views of ‘right and justice, and
prepared to demand and defend both. This is the point in the progress of the

- new and growing nation to which our observation is now directed, when the

great question was to be decided, whether independent self-control should be
enjoyed, or continued vassalage to an ungenerous parent should be endured.
Our next topic will be the events connected with the settlement of that question.

2. An Englishtrader bribed 9. Peoria Indian to murder him, for which he gave him a barrel of rum.
The place of his death was Cahokia, a small village on the east side of «the Mississippi, a little below St.
Louis. Pontiac was one of the greatest of all the Indian chiefs known to the white people, and deserved
a better fate. It is said, that during the war of 1763, he appointed a commissary, and issued bills of
credit. So highly was he esteemed by the French inhabitants, that these were received by them. Mont-
calm thought much of him ; and at the time of his death, Pontiac was dressed in aFrench uniform, pres-
ented to him by that commander. .See verse 3, . 1 ‘

Burnaby, who travelled in America at this period, expressed the opinion, that sectional jealousy and dis-
similarit ‘ would prevent a permanent union; yet he avers that the people were imbued with ideas of
indepen ence, and that it was frequently remarked among them, that “ the tide of dominion was running
westward, and that America was destined to be the mistress of the world.” .

all over the New, wherever English hearts beat, or English tongues gave utter-
ance.

2. Nor did English hearts alone cherish the precious seedling, nor English
tongues alone utter the noble doctrines of popular sovereignty; but in the
homes of all in this beautiful land, whatever country gave the inmates birth, there
was a shrine of freedom, and a refuge for the oppressed. Here king-craft and
priest-craft never had an abiding place, and their ministers were always weak in
the majestic presence of the popular will. . .

3. From the beginning, the colonists had evinced an impatience of arbitrary
rule; and every manifestation of undue control by local magistrates or distant
monarchs—every effort to abridge their liberties or absorb their gains, stimulated
the growth of -democratic principles. These permeated the whole social and po-
litical life in America, and ﬁnally evolved from the. crude’ materials of royal
charters, religiouscovenants and popular axioms, that galaxy of representative
governments which, having the justice of the English Constitution, the truth of
Christian ethics and the wisdom of past experience for their foundction, were
united in’ “the fulness of time,” in that symmetrical combination of free institu-
tions, the REPUBLIC or THE UNITED STATES or AMERICA. .

4. The war of the Revolution was not the violent _ result of recent discon-
tents, but the culmination of a long series of causes tending to such a climax.
The parliamentary enactments which kindled the rebellion, were not oppressive
measures entirely novel. They had their counterparts in the British statute books
even as early as the restoration of monarchy [1660],1 a hundred years before. They
were only re-assertions of tyrannical legislative. power and royal prerogatives, to
which the "colonies, in the weakness of their infancy and early youth, were com-
pelled to submit. Now they hadgrown to maturity, and dared to insist upon
receiving exact justice. They had recently emerged from an exhaustingiwar,
which, instead of weakening them, had taught them their real "moral, political
and physical strength. They had also learned the important lesson of power in
union. T

5. Having acquired a mastery over the savages of the wilderness, and assist-
ed in breaking the French power on their frontiers, into atoms,? the colonists felt
their manhood stirring within them, and theytacitly agreed no longer to submit
to the narrow and oppressive policy of Great Britain. Their‘indu_stry and com-
merce were too expansive to be conﬁned within the narrow limits of ‘those’ re-
strictions which the Board of Trade,3 fromtime to time, had imposed, and they
determined to regard them as mere ropes of sand. For long and gloomy years
they had struggled up, unaided and alone, from feebleness to. strength. j "They had
built fortiﬁcations, raised armies and fought battles for England’s glory and their
own preservation, without England’s aid, and often without, her sympathy.‘-
And it was not until the growing importance of the French settlements excited the
jealousy of Great Britain, that her ministers perceived the expediency of justice
and liberality toward her colonies, in order to secure their loyalty and efﬁcient

1 . 3. Note 6 p. 99.

4. Georgia, alone, received parliamentary aid [verse 3, p. 73], in the establishment of settlements. In
all the other colonies, where vast sums were expended in ﬁtting out expeditions, purchasing the soil of
the Indians, and sustaining the settlers, neither the crown nor parliament ever contributed a farthing of
pecuniar aid. The settling of Massachusetts alone, cost a million of dollars. Lord Baltimore spent
two hun red thousand dollars in colonizing Mar land; and William Penn became deeply involved in
debt, in his elforts to settle and improve Pennsy Vania.

of the Mohegan tribes were reduced to the condition of vassals
of that confederacy. Peace was effected in 1665, by the
English governor at New York. -In the meanwhile, the
English and N aragansets had smitten the Peqaodsﬂ and the
remaining independent Mohegans, reduced to a handful, ﬁnally
took up their abode upon -the west bank of the Thames, ﬁve
miles below N orwich,9 at a place still known as Mohegan
’ --Plain. Their burial place was at Norwich, and there a
granite monument rests upon the grave of Uncas. The tribe
is now almost eXtinct—“the last of the Mohicans” will soon
sleep with his fathers. ’

15. ‘The NEW ENGLAND INDIANS inhabited the country from Connecticut to
the Saoo river. The principal tribes were the Na?"/"agansets in Rhode Island,
and the western shores of N arraganset Bay; the Poiconoicezfs and T/Vampanoags on

UNcA~s’ MONUMENT.

- the eastern shore of the same bay, and in a portion of l\/Ia-ssachusetts; the Nip-

macs in the centre of Massachusetts; the Massachusetts in the vicinity of Boston
and the shores southward; and the Pawtacicezfs in the north-eastern part of Mas-
sachusetts,’ embracing the Permaccoks of New Hampshire. These were divided
into smaller bands, having petty chiefs. They were warlike, and were continu-
ally engaged in hostilities with the FIVE NATIONS, or with the Mohegans. The

, English and Dutch effected a general peace in 1673.3 Two years afterward,

[I 67 5,] Metacomezf (King Philip) aroused most of the New England tribes against
the English. A ﬁerce war ensued, but. ended in the subjugation of the Indians
and the death of 'PiziZz'p in 1676.4 The power of the New England Indians was
completely broken. Some joined the more eastern tribes, and others took refuge
in Canada, from whence they frequently came to the border settlements on

- errands of revenge.5 These incursions ceased when the French dominion in

Canada ended in 17 63.5 When the Puritans came7 [1620], the New -England
Imlians numbered about ten thousand souls; now [1854] probably not three.
hundred representatives remain; and the dialects of all, except of the Narragan-
sets, are forgotten. -

16. The ABENAKES were eastward of the Saco. The chief tribes were the Pe-
nobscozfs, Normblgewocks, Androscoggins, and Pa.9sammaqa0cZdz'es. These, with the
more eastern tribes of the Micmacs and Etchemms, were made nominal Christians
by the French J esuits;3 and they were all ﬁrm allies of the French until the
conquest of Canada by the English, in 1760.9 All of the ABENAKES, except the
Penabscczfs, withdrew to Canada in 1754. A few scattered families of the latter
yet [1854] dwell upon the banks of the Penobscot river, and Wanderers are seen
on- the St. Lawrence.

co-operation.‘ Compelled to be self-reliant from the beginning, the colonists
were made strong by the mother’s neglect; and when to tha.t neglect she add-

ed oppression and scorn, they felt justified in using their developed strength in

\

defence of their rights.

6. The colonists could not complain of the wilful exercise of tyrannical power
on the part of Great Britain. There was no motive for sucha course. They
complained of an unjust and illiberal policy, vvhich accomplished all the pur-
poses of absolute tyranny. The rod of iron was often covered with velvet,
and was wielded, as often, by ignorant rather than wicked hands. Yet the
ignorant hand with the concealed. rod, smote as lustily and offensively, as if it
had been a wicked one, and the‘ rod bare. The first form of governmental and
proprietary oppression? was in the appointment of -local rulers. The people
were not represented in. the appointing power. Then came commercial restric-
tions,3 prohibitions to manufacture,4 imposts upon exchanges,5 and direct tax-
ation,6 by enactments of parliament, in which the colonists were not represented.
At the beginning they had asserted, and during their Whole progress they had
maintained, that important political maxim, that TAXATION without REPRESENTA-
TION, ts tyranny. This was the fundamental doctrine of their political creed-
this was the test of all parliamentary measures—-this was the strong rock upon
Which the patriots of the Revolution anchored their faith and hope.

7. When the treaty of Paris [1763] closed the French and Indian war, the
colonists looked forward to long years of prosperity andrepose. A young mon-
arch,7..virtuous and of upright intentions, was just seated [1761] upon the Brit-
ish throne. Having conﬁdence in his integrity, and having recently felt the jus-
tice of the government, under the direction of Pitt,8 they were disposed to for-
get the past grievances; and being identiﬁed with the glory of England, now
become one of the ﬁrst powers on the earth, they were fond of their connection.
But the serenity of the colonial sky soon disappeared, and it was not long before
violent tempests were raging there. Even before the treaty at Paris, a cloud had
arisen which portended future trouble. The war had exhausted the British
treasury,9. and ministers devised various schemes for replenishing it. ' They had
observed the resources of the colonists, as manifested by their efforts during the
recent struggle,” and as they were relieved from further hostilities by the subju-
gation of Canada“ [1759], the government looked to_them for aid. Instead of
asking it as a favor, it was demanded as a right ; instead of inviting the colonial
assemblies to levy taxes and make appropriations, government assumed the right
to tax their expanding commerce; and then commenced 'a vigorous enforcement
ofexistingrevenue laws, which had hitherto been only nominally oppressive'.12 -

1. Verse 36, p. 151. _ ’

2. Three forms of government had existed, namely, charter, proprietary! andro at. The New Eng-
land governments were based on royal charters ; New Jersey, "Pennsylvania, Mary and, and the Caroli-
nas were owned and governed by individuals or companies, and the remainder were immediately sub-
ject to the crown. Notwithstanding this diversity in the source of government, the anti-monarchical
spirit pervaded the people of all, from the beginning, and gave birth to popular legislative assemblies.

years, and died in 1820. His son was appointed Regent.

10. French and Indian war. See page 137. I

11. Verse 47, p. 155. .

12. Commercial restrictions were imposed upon the colonies as early as 1651 [note 1, p. 80]. In 1660, 1672,
1676, 1691,’ and 1692, attempts were made by parliament to derive a revenue by a -tariif - taxation upon
the colonies. In 1696 a proposition was made to levy a direct tax upon the colonies. Then, not only in
Britain, but in America, the power of parliament (wherein the colonists were not represented), to tax
those colonies, was strenuously denied.

Quest'£ons.—6. Of what did the colonists justly complain? What did a narrow policy accomplish? Of
what rights were the colonists deprived? What was their political maxim? 7. What gave the colonists
promise ofprosperity? In what did they take pride? What caused the government to disappoint them?
What did the government do? ,

PRELIMINARY EVENTS. 161

8. The ﬁrst act which revealed the intentions of Parliament to tax the colo-
nies by enforcing the revenue laws, was the authorization [1761], of Writs of
Assistance. These were general search-warrants, which not only allowed the
king’s officers who held them, to break open‘ any citizen’s store or dwelling to
search for and seize foreign merchandise, on which a duty had not been paid,
butcompelled sheriffs and others to assist in the work. The people could not
brook such a system of petty opression. The sanctities of private life might be
invaded, at any time, by hirelings. . _

9. These Writs were ﬁrst issued in Massachusetts, and immediately great ex-
citement prevailed. Their legality was questioned, and the matter was brought
before a court held in the old town hall in Boston. The advocate for the Crown
(Mr. Gridley) argued, that as Parliament was the supreme legislature for the
whole British nation, and had authorized these writs, no subject had a right to
complain. He was answered by James Otis,‘ the younger, then advocate gen-
eral of the province. On that occasion, the intense ﬁre of his patriotism beamed
forth with inexpressible brilliancy, and his eloquence was like lightning, far-felt
and consuming. On that day the trumpet of the revolution was sounded.
“The seeds of patriots and heroes were then and there sown,” and when the
orator exclaimed, “ To my dying day I will oppose, with all the power and facul-
ties God has given me, all such instruments of slavery on one hand, and villany
on the other,” the independence of the colonies was proclaimed? From that
day began the triumphs of the popular will. Very few writs were issued, a.nd
these were ineffectual. .

10. The-young king unwisely listened to the councils of Bute,3 an unprincipled
Scotch adventurer, who had been his tutor, and turned his back upon Pitt.4 Dis-

‘astrous consequences ensued. Weak and corrupt men controlled his cabinet,

and parliament approved of illiberal and unjust measures toward the colonists.
The Sugar bill5 was re-enacted, and at the same time, George Grenville, then
prime minister, proposed “certain stamp duties on the colonies.” The subject was
left open for consideration almost a year, when, in deﬁance of the universal‘ op-

position of the Americans, the famous Stamp Act, which declared that no legal
instrument of writing .hould be valid, unless it bore a. government stamp, be-

came a law.5 Now was executed without hesitation, a measure which no for-

1. James Otis was born in Barnstablc, Mass, in 17 25. He was the leader of the Revolutionary party
in Massachusetts, at the beginning. He was .vounded by a British oﬂicial in 1769, and never fairly rc-
covered. He was killed by lightning in 1772. See portrait at the head of this chapter. '

2. Later than this [1768], Otis wrote to a friend in London, and said : “ Our fathers were a good
people; we have been a free people, and if you will not let us remain so any longer, we shall be a
great people, and the present measures can have no tendency but to hasten with great rapidity, events
which every good and honest man would wish delayed for ages.” He evidently alluded to the future indo-
pendence of the colonies.  '

3. Bute was a gay Scotch earl, poor and proud. He became afavorite with the mother of George the
Third, was appointed his tutor, and acquired such influence over the mind of the prince, that on his ac-
cession to the throne, he made him his chief minister and adviser. The English people were much in-
censed ; and the unwise measures of the early years of George’s reign, were properly laid to the charge-
of Bute. A placard was put up in London, with the words, “ No Scotch minister—-—no petticoat govern-
ment. ’ ' - i

4. Pitt, disgusted by the ignorance and assurance of Bute and the misplaced conﬁdence of the
king, resigned ofﬁce, and retired to his country seat at Hayes. The king esteemed him highly, but was
too much controlled by Bute to follow his own inclinations.

5. A bill which imposed a duty upon sugar, coffee, indigo, &c., imported into the colonies from the ‘

West Indies. .

6. The stamps were upon blue paper, in the form seen in the engraving on the next page, and were
to be attached to every piece of paper or parchment, on which a legal instrument was written. For these
stamps, government charged speciﬁc prices : for example, for a common property deed, one shilling and
sixpence '; for a diploma or certiﬁcate of a college degree, two pounds, &c., &c. .

enough to attempt} V

11. Intelligence of the passage of the Stamp Act
produced general and intense indignation in Ameri-
ca. ' The hearts of the people were yet thrilled by the
eloquent denunciations of Otis,2 a.nd soon Patrick
Henry sent forth a response equally eloquent, from
the heaving bosom of the Virginia Assembly-*.3 The
people gathered in excited groups, and boldly ex-
pressed their indignation. The pulpit denounced
. the wicked scheme, and associations of Sons ofL7lb-
H  ; e7°ly4 in every colony, put forth their energies in de-
:_;«m1_. l,“,"‘1,m;1{,_,i-ll, fence of popular freedom. The press, then assuming

. great power, spoke out like an oracle of Truth. In

A sum». several cities popular excitement created mobs, and

' ' violence ensued. The Stamps were seized on their

arrival, and secreted or burned. Stamp distributors‘ were insulted and despised,

and on the day when the law Was to take effect [Nov. 1, 1765], there were no
ofﬁcials courageous enough to enforce it. .

12. In the midst of this great excitement, a Congress of Delegates appointed
by several colonies, assembled [Oct. 7] at New York.6 They continued in session
fourteen days, and in three well-written documents,7 they ably set forth the
grievances and the rights of the colonists, and petitioned the king ‘and parlia-
ment for a redress of the former, and acknowledgment of the la.tter. The pro-
ceedings of this Second Colonial Oongresﬁ were applauded by all the provincial
assemblies, and the people of America were as ﬁrmly united i11 heart and pur-
pose then, as they were after the Declaration of Independence, more than ten
years later. '

   
   
 
 

J“

        

 

   

1. DuringWalpole’s administration [1732], a stamp duty was proposed. He said, “I will leave the
taxation of America to some of my successors wl1o have more courage than I have.” Sir William
Keith,’ governor of Pennsylvania, proposed such a tax in 1739. Frankli‘r'rthought it just, when a dele-
gate in the Colonial Congress at Albany, in 1754 [verse 10, p. 140]. But when it was proposed to Pitt in
1759, he said, “ I will never burn my ﬁngers with an American Stamp Act.”

2. Verse 9, p. 161.

3. He introduced a series of resolutions, highly tinctured with rebellious doctrines. I-lo asserted the
general rights of all the colonies ; then the exclusive right of the Virginia Assembly to tax the people
of that province, and boldly declared that the people were not bound to obey ary law relative to taxa-
tion, which did not proceed from their representatives. The last resolution declared that whoever should
dissent from the doctrines inculcated in the others, should be considered an “ enemy of the colonies.”
The introduction of these resolutions produced great excitement and alarm. Henry supported them
with all the power of his wonderful eloquence. Some rose from their seats and others sat in breathless
silence. At length, when alluding to tyrants, he exclaimed, “ Caesar had his Brutus, Charles the First
his Cromwell, and George the Third ”—there was a cry of “ Treason I treason !” He paused a moment,
and said--“ may proﬁt by their example. If that be treason, make the most of it.” [See picture at the

mer ministry had possessed courage or recklessnessk‘

head of this chapter. The head of the speaker is a correct likeness of Patrick Henry.] Apart of his ,

resolutions were adopted, and these formed the ﬁrst gauntlet of deﬁance cast at the feet of the British
monarch. Their power was felt throughout the land.

4. These Associations were composed of popular leaders and others, who leagued with the avowed de-
termination to resist oppression to the uttermost. After their organization in the diﬂ’erent colonies, they
formed a sort of National league, and by continual correspondence, aided effectually in preparing the
way for the Revolution. , .

5. Men appointed by the crown to sell the government stamps, or stamped paper. ‘

6. Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island,‘ New Jersey, Pennsylvania Maryland, and South Caro-.
lina, were represented. The Assemblies of those not represented, declared their readiness to agree to
whatever measures the Congress might adopt. Timothy Ruggles, of Massachusetts (who afterwards
commanded a corps of Tories) [note 3, p. 171], presided. _

7. A Declaration of Rights, written by John Cruger, of New York : a Jlfetnwortal to both Houses of Par-
liament, by Robert R. Livingston, of New York :, and a I-‘et'.'t1'on to the M729, by James Otis, of Massa-
chusetts. ..

PRELIMINARY EVENTS. 168

13. The ﬁrst of November was observed as a day of fasting and mourning.
Funeral processions paraded city streets, and bells tolled funeral knells. The
colors of vessels were placed at half-mast, and the newspapers exhibited the
black-line, tokens of public grief. The courts were now closed, legal marriages
ceased, ships remained in port, and for some time all business was suspended. But
the lullin the storm was of brief duration. The people were only gathering
strength for more vigorous achievements in defense of their rights. The Sons of
Liberty‘ put forth new efforts; mobs began to assail the residences of officials,
and burn distinguished royalists, in effigy? Merchants entered into agreements
not to import goods from Great Britain while the-obnoxious Act remained a
law, and domestic manufactures were commenced in almost every f-.imily.3 The
wealthiest vied with the middling classes in economy,_ and wore clothing of
their own manufacture. That . wool might not become scarce, the use of sheep
ﬂesh for food was discouraged. Soon, from all classes in America, there went to
the ea.rs of the British ministry, a respectful but ﬁrm protest. It was seconded

by the merchants and manufacturers of London, whose American trade was.

prostrated,4 and the voice, thus made potential, was heard and heeded in high
places. -

14. In the meanwhile, Grenville‘-'> had been succeeded in office by the Mar-
quis of Rockingham, a friend of the colonies, and an enlightened statesman.
William Pitt, who had been called from his retire-
ment5 by the voice of the people, hoping much from
the new ministry, appeared in parliament as the
earnest champion of the Americans. Justice and
expediency demanded a repeal of the Stamp Act,7
and early in January 1766, a bill for that pur-
pose was introduced into the House of Commons,
and was warmly supported by Pitt, Barre, and
others. Then Edmund Burke ﬁrst appeared as the
champion of right, and during the stormy debates
on the subject, which ensued, he achieved some of  ,
those earliest and most wonderful triumphs of ora- ' ” .
tory, which established his fame, and endeared him  __
to the American people.8 The obnoxious Act was WILLIAM mm
repealed on the 18th of March, 1766. London ware- 
houses were illuminated, and ﬂags decorated the shipping in the Thames. In
America, public thanksgivings, bonﬁres and illuminations, attested the general

joy, and Pitt,‘ who had boldly declared his conviction that parliament had no
right to tax the colonies without their consent,‘~’ was lauded as a political Messiah.
N on-importation associations were dissolved, business was resumed, and the
Americans conﬁdently expected justice from the mother country, and a speedy
reconciliation. ‘ ,

15. But another storm soon began to lower. Pitt, himself, tenacious of Brit-
ish honor, and doubtful of the passage of the Repeal Bill without some conces-
sions, had appended to it an act, which declared that Parliament possessed the
power “to bind the colonies, in all cases whatsoever.” The egg of tyranny
which lay concealed in this “declaratory act,” as it was called, was not per-
ceived by the colonists, while their eyes were filled with tears of joy; but when
calm reflection came, they saw clearly that germ of future oppressions, and were
uneasy. They perceived the Repeal Bill to be only a truce in the war upon
freedom in America, a.nd they watched every movement of the government
party with suspicion. Within a few months afterward, a brood of obnoxious
measures were hatched from that egg, and aroused the ﬁercest indignation of
the colonists.

16. A large portion of the House of Lords,3 the whole bench of Bishops,4
and many of the Commons, were favorable to coercive measures toward the
Americans. Not doubting the power of Parliament to tax them, they prevailed
on the Ministry to adopt new schemes for replenishing the exhausted treasury-5
from the coffers of the colonists, and urged the justice of employing arms, if ne-
cessary, to enforce obedience. Troops were accordingly sent to America [June
17 .66] ; and a Mutiny Act was passed, which provided for their partial subsist-
ence by the colonies.5 The appearance. of these troops in New York, and the
order for the people to feed and shelter the avowed instruments of their own en-
slavement, produced violent outbreaks in that city, and burning indignation all
over the land. The Assembly of New York arrayed itself against the govern-
ment, and refused compliance with the demands of the obnoxious act.

17. Soon after these troops were sent to America, Pitt was called to the head
of the Ministry, and was created Earl of Chatham [July 30, 1766]. He opposed
the new measures as unjust and unwise. But he could not always prevent
mischief. During his absence from Parliament, by sickness, the chancellor of
the_Exchequer (Charles Townshend) coalesced with Grrenville7 in bringing new

‘ 1. ' See portrait on page 163. William Pitt was born in 1708, and held many high otﬁces. During an
excictling debate in parliament, on American aﬂairs, in 1778, he swooned, and died within a month after-
war s.

2. "‘ Taxation,” said Pitt, “ is no part of the governing or legislative power. Taxes are the voluntary
gift or grant of the commons alone.” ‘ “I rejoice,” he said, “ that America has resisted. Three millions
of people, so dead to all the feelings of liberty, as voluntarily to become slaves, would have been fit in-
struments to make slaves of the rest.” And colonel Barre declared that the colonists were planted by
English oppression, grew by neglect, and in all the essential elements of a free people were perfectly
independent of Great Britain. He then warned the government to act justly, or the colonies would be lost
to Great Britain forever. '

3. Every peer in the British realm is a legislator, by virtue of his title ; and when they are assembled
for legislative duties, they constitute the House of Lords, or upper branch of the legislature, answering,
in some degree, to our Senate. ‘

4. Two archbishops, and twenty-four bishops of England and Wales, have a right to sit and vote in the
House of Lords, and have the same political importance as the peers. By the act of union between Ire-
land and‘ England, four “lords spiritual,” from among the archbishops and bishops of the former coun-
try, have a seat in the House of Lords. The “ lords temporal and lords spiritual” constitute the House
of Lords. The House of Commons is composed of men elected by the people, and answers to the House
of Representomves of our Federal Congress.

6. This act also allowed military oﬁicers, possessing a warrant from a justice of the peace, to break
1' nto any house where he might suspect deserters were concealed. Like the Writs of Assistance [verse
8, p. 161], this power might be used for wicked purposes.

taxation schemes before Parliament. A bill was passed [June 1767] for levying
duties upon tea, glass, paper, painters’ colors, &c., imported into the colonies.
Another_ was passed, in July, for establishing "a Board_ of Trade in the col-
onies, independent of colonial legislation, and for creating resident commission-
ers of custom to enforce the revenue laws} Then another, a few days later,
which forbade the New York Assembly to perform any legislative act whatever,
until it should comply with the requisitions of the Mutiny Act.2,

18. This direct blow at popular liberty, and these new taxation schemes, pro-
duced excitement throughout the colonies, almost as violent as those on account
of the Stamp Act.3 The colonial Assemblies boldly protested; new non-im-
portation associations were formed; pamphlets and newspapers were ﬁlled with
inﬂammatory appeals to the people, deﬁning their rights, and urging them to a
united resistance ;4 and early in 17 68, almost every colonial assembly had
boldly expressed its conyiction, that parliament had no right to tax the colonies.
These expressions were in response to a circular issued by Massachusetts [Feb.
17 68] to the several assemblies, asking their cooperation in obtaining a redress
of grievances. That circular greatly offended the Ministry; and the governor of
Massachusetts was instructed to command the Assembly, in the king’s name, to
rescind the resolution adopting it. The Assembly passed [June 30, 1768] an
almost unanimous vote not to rescind,5 and made this very order an evidence of
the intentions of government to enslave the colonists, by restraining the free
speech and action of their representatives.

19. Ignorant and careless concerning the character and temper of the Amer-
icans, the British Ministry disregarded the portentous warnings which every
vessel from the New World bore to their ears. Having resolved on employing
physical force in the maintenance of obedience, and not doubting its potency,
they became less regardless of even the forms of justice, and began to treat the
colonists as rebellious subjects, rather than as free British brethren. Ministers
sent circulars to the colonial Assemblies, warning them not to imitate the factious

disobedience of Massachusetts; 3 and the royal governors were ordered to en- ’

force submission by all means in their power. The eﬁ"ect of these circulars was
to disgust and irritatethe Assemblies, and to stimulate their sympathy for Mas-
sachusetts, now made the special object of royal displeasure. .

were regarded with as much contempt as were the tax-gatherers in J udea, iii

able portion of the population from committing personal violence. A crisis soon
arrived. In June, 1768, the sloop, Liberty, belonging to John Hancock, one of
the leaders of the popular mind in Boston,9 arrived at that port with a cargo of

4. Among the most powerful of these appeals, were a series of letters written by John Dickinson, of
Philadelphia, and entitled, Letters of ct Pe-nnsylvanict Farmer. Like aine’s Crisis, ten years later
[note 2, p. 187], these Letters produced a wide-spread and powerful effect on the public mind. James
Otis asserted, ina pamphlet, that “taxes on trade [tariffs], if designed to raise a revenue, were just as
much a violation of their rights, as.any other tax.” . ‘

5. James Otis and Samuel Adams were the principal speakers on this occasion. “When Lord Hills-
borough [colonial secretary] knows,” said the former, “ that we will not rescind our acts, he should ap-
ply to parliament to rescind theirs. Let Britons rescind their measures, or the colonies are lost to them

it was refused, they seized [June 10] the vessel. The news spread over the
town, and the people resolved on effectual resistance. The commissioners‘
were assailed by a_mob; their houses were damaged; and they were obliged to
seek safety in Castle Wt'ZZz'am, a small fortress at the entrance to the harbor}

21. Alarmed by these demonstrations of the popular feeling, governor Ber-
nard unwisely invited general Gage,2.‘then in command of British troops at
Halifax, to bring soldiers to Boston to overawe the inhabitants.-‘3 They came in
September [Sept. 27,1768], seven hundred in number, and on a quiet Sabbath
morning, landed under cover of the cannons of the British ships which brought
them, and with drums beating, and colors ﬂying, they marched to the Gommon,4
with all the parade of a victorious army entering a conquered city. Religion,
popular freedom, patriotism, were all outraged, and_ the cup of the peoples in-
dignation was full.5 The colonists were taught the necessary lesson, that
armed resistance must oppose armed oppressi.on.6 ,

22. The Assembly of Massachusetts refused to afford food and shelter for the
royal .tro-ops among them, and for this offence, parliament now became the supple
instrument of the crown, censured their disobedience, approved of coercive
measures, and by resolution, prayed the king to revive a long obsolete statute
of Henry the Eighth, by which the governor of the refractory colony should
be required to arrest and send to England for trial, on a charge of treason, the
ringleaders in the recent tumults.7 The colonial Assembly indignantly respond-‘
ed by re-asserting the chartered privileges of the people, and denying the right
of the king to take an offender from the country, for trial. And in the House of
Commons a powerful minority battled manfully for the Americans. Burke pro-
nounced the idea of reviving that old statute, as “horrible.” “Can you not
trust the juries of that country ?” he asked. “If you have not a party among
two millions of people, you must either change your plans of government, or
renounce the colonies forever.” Even Grenville opposed the measure, yet a
majority voted [J an. 26, 1769] in favor of the resolution. _

23. For more than a year. afterward the colonies were agitated by disputes

with the royal governors, the petty tyranny of lesser officials, and the interference

of theimperial government with colonial legislation. The Assembly "of Massa-
cl1usetts,- encouraged by the expressed sympathy of -the other colonies, ﬁrmly,
refused to appropriate a single dollar for the support of the troops. They even
demanded their withdrawal from the city, and refused to transactany legislative
business while they remained. Daily occurrences exasperated the people
against the troops, and ﬁnally led to bloodshed in the streets of Boston. ' _

portion of the inhabitants. A‘ few evenings afterward [March 5], about seven
hundred of them assembled in the streets, for the avowed purpose of attacking
the troops} A sentinel was assaulted near the custom house, when captain
Preston, commander of the guard, went to his rescue with eight armed men.
The mob dared the soldiers to tire, and attacked them with stones, pieces of
ice, and other missiles. One of the soldiers who received a blow, ﬁred, and
his six companions also discharged their guns. Three of the citizens were
killed and ﬁve were dangerously wounded? The mob instantly retreated, when
al1,_the bells of the city rang analarum, and in less than an hour several thou-
sands of exasperated citizens.were in the streets. A terrible scene of blood
would have ensued, had not governor Hutchinson assured the people that justice
should be vindicated in the morning.

25. The people demanded the instant removal of the troops from Boston, and the
trial of captain Preston and his men, for murder. These demands were complied
with. The troops were removed to Castle W’2.'Zlz'am3 [March 12, 17 70], and Preston,
ably defended by John Adams and Josiah Quincy, two of the popular leaders, was
tried and acquitted, with six of his men, by. a Boston jury. The other two sol-
diers were found guilty of manslaughter. This result was a comment on the
enforcement of the statute of Henry the Eighth, highly favorable to the Amer-
icans.4 It showed that in the midst of popular excitement, the strong conserva-
tive principles of justice, bore rule. The victims of the riot were regarded as
martyrs to liberty,5, and for many years, the memory of the “Boston Massacre,”
as it was called, was kept alive by anniversary orations in the city and vicinity.

26. On the day of the bloody riot in Boston [March 5], lord North, who was
then the English prime minister, proposed to parliament a repeal of all duties
imposed by the act of 1767,“ except that upon tea. An act to that effect was
passed a month afterward [April 12].. This concession was wrung from the
minister by the clamor. of English merchants and manufacturers, who again felt
severely the operations. of the non-importation associations in America. As tea

was a luxury, North supposed the colonists would 11ot object to the small duty»

laid upon that article, and he retained it as a standing assertion of the right of
parliament to impose such duties. The minister entirely mistook the character

of the peoplehe was dealing with. It was not the petty amount of duties of _

which they complained, for allthe taxes ‘yet imposed were not in the least bur-.

densome to them. They were contending for a great principle which lay at the

It was always believed thatthe tall man was Samuel Adams, one
of the most inﬂexible patriots of the Revolution, and at that time
a popular leader. He was a descendant of one of the early pu-
ritans [verse 6, p. 56], andwas born in Boston in 1722. He was
one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence; was after-
ward governor of Massachusetts, and died in 1803.‘ A purer pa-
triot than Samuel Adams, never lived. ‘

The leader of the mob was a powerful mulatto, named At-
tucks: He and Samuel Gray, and James Caldwell, were killed
instantly ; two others received mortal wounds.

one article as much a violation of their sacred rights, as if ten were included.
Tlieyaccepted the ministerial concession, but, asserting their rights, continued
their non-importation league against the purchase and use of tea.‘

27. In 1771., the Carolinas, hitherto exempted from violent outbursts of pop-
ular indignation, although never‘ wanting in zeal in opposing the‘ Stamp Act,‘3
and kindred measures, became the theatre of great excitement. To satisfy the
rapacity and pride of royal governors, the industry of the province of North
Carolina, especially, was enormously taxed.3 The oppression was real, not an

' abstract principle, as at the North. The people in the interior at length formed

associations, designed to resist unjust taxation, and to control public affairs.
They called themselves ReguZazfors,° and in 1771 were too numerous to be over-
awed by local magistrates. Their operations assumed the character of open re-
bellion, and governor Tryon4 marched into that region, with an armed force, to
subdue them. They met him upon the Alamance Creek, in Alamance county
[May 16, 1771], and there a bloody skirmish ensued. The Regulators were
subdued and dispersed, a.nd Tryon marched back in triumph to the sea-board,
after hanging six of the leaders [June 19]. These events aroused throughout
the South, the ﬁercest hatred of British power, and stimulated that earnest pa-
triotism so early displayed by the people below the Roanoke, when the Revolu-
tion broke out.5 .

28. In June the" following year, the upper part of Narraganset Bay exhibited
a scene which produced much excitement, and widened the breach between
Great Britain and her colonies. The commander of the British armed schooner
Gaspé, stationed there to assist the Commissoners of customs‘? in enforcing the
revenue laws, annoyed the American navigators by haughtily commanding them
to lower their colors when they passed his vessel, in token of obedience. The
William Tells of the bay, refused to bow to the cap of this petty Gresler.7 For
such disobedience, a Providence sloop was chased by the schooner. The latter
grounded upon a low sandy point; and on that night [June 9, 17 72], sixty-four
armed men went down from Providence in boats, captured thepeople on board
the Graspe, and burned the vessel. Although a large reward was offered for the
perpetrators (who were well known in Providence),8 they were never betrayed.

1. Even before N orth’s proposition was made to parliament, special agreements concerningthe disuse of
tea, had been made. Already the popular feeling on this subject had been manifested toward a Boston
merchant who continued to sell tea. A company of half-grown boys placed an eiﬁgy near his door, with
a ﬁnger upon it pointing toward his store. While a man was attempting to pull it down, he was pelted

with dirt and stones. He ran into the store, and seizing a gun, discharged its contents among the crowd. ,

A boy named Snyder was killed, and Christopher Gore (afterward governor of Massachusetts), was
wounded. The affair produced great excitement. At about the same time three hundred “mistresses
of families” in Boston, signed a pledge of total abstinence from the use of tea, whilethe duty remained
upon it. A few daysafterward a large number of young ladies signed a similar pledge.

2. Verse 10, p. 161. '

3. Governor Tryon caused a palace to be erected for his residence, at N ewbern, at a cost of $75,000.
for the payment of which the province was taxed. This was in 1768, and was one of the principal
causes of discontent, which produced the outbreak here mentioned. _

7. Gesler was an Austrian governor of one of the cantons of Switzerland. He placed his cap on a pole,
at a gate of the town, and ordered all to bow to it, when they should enter. William Tell, a brave
leader of the people, refused. He was imprisoned for disobedience, escaped, aroused his countrymen
to arms, drove their Austrian masters out of the land, and achieved the independence of Switzerland._

8. One of the leaders was Abraham Whipple, a naval commander during the Revolution [verse2,p.22l].
Several others were afterward distinguished for bravery during that struggle. Four years afterward,
when Sir James Wallace, a British commander was in the vicinity of Ne_wport, Whipple became
known as the leader of the attack on the Gaspe. Wallace sent him the following letter‘: “ You, Abra-
ham Whipple, on the 9th of June, 1772, burned his majesty’-s vessel, the Gaspe, and I will hang you at
the yard arm.” To this Whipple replied : “ To Sir J ames, Wallace ; Sir: Always catch a man before
you hang him. ABRAHAM WHIPPLE.”

29. Early in 1773, a new thought upon taxation entered the brain of Lord
North.‘ The East India Company,2 having lost their valuable tea customers in
America, by the operation of the non-importation associations,3 and having more
than seventeen millions of pounds of the herb in
their warehouses in England, petitioned Parliament ,:-swig
to take off the duty of three pence a pound, lev-
ied upon the importation of the article into Amer-
ica. The company agreed to pay the government
more than an equal amount, in export duty, if
the change should be made. Here was an excel-
lent opportunity for the government to act justly
and wisely, and to produce a perfect reconcilia-
tion; but the stupid ministry, fearing it might be
considered a submission to “rebellious subjects,”
refused the olive branch of peace. But, continu-  .1
ing to misapprehend the real question at issue, ’~
North introduced a bill into Parliament, allowing LORD N0RTH_
the company to export their teas to America, on
their own account, without paying an export duty. As this Would make tea
cheaper in America, than in England, he concluded the Americans would not
object to paying the three pence duty. This concession to a commercial monop-
oly, while spurning the appeals of a great principle, only created contempt and
indignation throughout the colonies. .

market as now open for their tea, and, soon after the passage of the bill [May
10, 1773], geveral large ships, heavily laden with the article, were on their way‘

across the Atlantic. Intelligence of these movements reached America before,
the arrival of any of the ships, and the people in most of the sea-board towns,
where consignments of tea had been made, resolved that it should not even be"

landed. The ships which arrived at New York and Philadelphia’, returned to

England with their cargoes. At Charleston it was landed, but was not allowed
to be sold, while at Boston the attempts of the governor and his friends,4 who
were consignees, to land the tea in deﬁance of the public feeling, resulted in the
destruction of a large quantity of it. On a cold moonlight night [December 16,
1'77 3], at the close of the last of several spirited meetings of the citizens held at
Faneuil Hall,5 a party of about sixty persons, some disguised as Indians, rushed

2. The English East India Company was formed and chartered in 1600, for the purpose of carrying
on a trade by sea, between England and the countries lying east of the Cape of Good Hope [note 1, p.
26]. It continued prosperous ; and about the middle of the last century, the governor of its stations in
India, under the pretense of obtaining security for their trade, subdued small territories, and thus

lanted the foundation of that great British empire in the East, which now comprises the whole of
indostan, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya mountains, with a population of more than one hun-
dred and twenty millions of people. '

4. The public mind in Massachusetts was greatly inﬂamed against governor Hutchinson at this time,
whose letters to a member of Parliament, recommending stringent measures toward the colonies, had
been sent to the speaker of the colonial Assembly, by Dr. Franklin. At about the same time, Parlia-
ment had passed a law, making the governor and judges of Massachusetts independent of the Assembly
for their salaries, these being paid out of the revenues in the hands of the commissioners of "customs.
This removal of these oﬂicials beyond all dependence upon the people, constituted them ﬁt instruments
of the crown for oppressing the inhabitants, and in that aspect the colonists viewed the measure, and
condemned it.

5. Because the Revolutionary meetings in Boston were held in Faneuil Hall, it was (and still is) called
The Cradle of Liberty. It was built and presented to the town by Peter Faneuil, in 1742. The picture

greater portion of the State of New York, and a part of Pennsylvania and Ohio
along_ the southern shores of Lake Erie. V» They were completely surrounded by
the ALGONQUINS, in whose southern border in portions of North Carolina and Vir-
ginia, were the Tusearoras and a few smaller I-roquozs tribes.’ The Hurons oc-
cupied the‘Canadian portions- of the territory, "and the land on the southern
shore of Lake Erie, and_ appeared to be a distinct nation; but their language
was found to be identical with that of the Iroquois. The Hurons consisted
of four smaller tribes, namely, the Wyandots or Hurons proper, the Att7Jouan-
dirons,2 the Erzes, and the Andd8ﬁe.S:.“:;? The two latter tribes Were south. of the
lake, and claimed jurisdiction back to'.the domains of the Shawneesﬁj.

2. The FIVE NATIONS, or IROQUOIS proper, formed a confederacy ‘composed of
the Seneca, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oneida, and Mohawlc tribes, all occupying lands
within the present State of New York. The Great Council fire of the Confeder-
ation was with the Onondagas, and tlieiinetropolis, or chief village, was near the
present city of Syracuse. , The French gave them the name of Iroquo7Js,' the AL-
GONQUINS called them 1lIz'ngoes.4 At what time the confederacy was formed, is
not known.5 It was strong a.nd powerful when the French discovered them,
[1609,] and they Were then engaged in bloody wars with their kinsmen, the
Wyandots. _ . . V .

3. The FIVE NATIONS resolved to strike a ﬁnal a11d decisive blow against their
western neighbors, in 16ét9,‘and, gathering all their warriors, made a successful
invasion of the Wyandot, or Huron country. 3 Great numbers of the VVg/andots
were slain and made prisoners, and the whole tribe was dispersed.§ Some of the
fugitives took refuge with the 0iz7;ppewas,' others ﬂed to Quebec, and a few be-
came a part of the Iroquois confederacy. Yet the spirit of the Wyandozﬁs was not
subdued, and they claimed and exercised sovereignty over almost the whole of
the Ohio country. They had great inﬂuence among the ALGONQUIN tribes,“ and
even as late as the treaty of Urreenville, in 1795, the principal cession of lands in
Ohio to the United States was made by the M/andot chiefs in council.7 They,
too, are reduced to a mere remnant of less than ﬁve hundred souls, and now
[1854] occupy lands upon the Neosho river, a chief tributary of the Arkansas.

4. The FIVE NATIONS were exceedingly warlike, and they made hostile ex-
peditions against the New England Indz'ans,8 in the East, the Erzes, Andaszfes and
Miarnies in the West,9 and penetrated to the domains of the Oatawbasw and
Cherokees“ in the South. S They subjugated the Erzes in 1655, and after a con-
test of twenty years, brought the Andaszfes into vassalage. ‘They conquered the
1l[z'amz'es“3 and 0t25a'was1-3 in 1657, and made incursions as far as the Roanoke and
Cape Fear Rivers to the land of their kindred in dialect, the Tuscaroras, in 170114.
Thirty years afterwards, having been joined by the Tuscaroras, and the name of
the confederacy changed to that of THE SIX NATIONS, they made war upon the

0herolcees15 and Catawbas.‘ They were led on by Hi-o-ka-too, a Seneca chief.

1. The Southern Iroquois were the Tuscaroras, Ohowans, Meherﬁns, and Nottowag/s. The three lat-
ter were upon the rivers in lower Virginia, called by their respective names, and were known undu‘
the general title of Tuscaroras . 7

2. Neutral Nation. When the Hurons and FIVE NATIONS Were at War, the Attiouandirons ﬂed to the
Sandusky, and built a fort for each of the belligerents when in that region. But their neutrality did
not save them from internal feuds which ﬁnally dismembered the tribe. One party joined the Wyom-
dots ; the other the Iroquois. . 3. Verse 9, p. 14. _

on board two vessels in the harbor, laden -with tea,
tore open the hatches, and in the course of two
hours, three hundred and forty-two chests coii-
taining the herb, were broken open, and their
contents cast into the water.
 31. This event produced a powerful sensation
throughout the British realm. ‘ While the Ameri-
" can colonies, and even Canada, Nova Scotia, and
the British West Indies, sympathized with the Bos-
tonians, and could not censure them, the exasper-
_ ated government adopte_d retaliatory measures,
notwithstanding payment for all damage to their

ordered the port of Boston to be closed aga.inst

courts of justice, and other public offices, to Salem. The Salem people patriot-'

ically refused the proffered advantage at the expense of -their neighbors; and
the inhabitants of Marblehead, ﬁfteen miles distant, offered the free use of their
harbor and wharves, to the merchants of Boston. Soon after the passage of
the Boston Port Bill, another act which levelled a blow at the charter of Mas-
sachusetts, was made a. law [March 28, 17 74.-]. It was equivalent to a total
subversion of the charter, inasmuch as it deprived the people of many of the
dearest privileges guarantied by that instrument.1 A third retaliatory act was
passed on the 21st of Apri_l, providing for the trial, in England, of all persons
charged in the colonies with murders committed in support of government,

sions to the Roman Catholics in Canada, known as_the_ Quebec Act. This ex-
cited the animosity of all Protestants. These measures created universal in-
dignation toward the government, and sympathy for the people of Boston.

32. The Port Bill went into operation on the ﬁrst of June, 17 74. It was a
heavy blow for Boston. Business was crushed, and great suffering ensued.

. Everywhere, tokens of the liveliest sympathy were manifested. Flour, rice,

cereal grains, fuel and money were sent to the people from the different colonies,
a.nd sympathizers in London_, subscribed onehundred and ﬁfty thousand dollars
for the poor of Boston. ~ A .

33. To enforce these oppressive laws, general Gage, the commander-in-chief
of the British army in America? was appointed governor of Massachusetts, and
an additional military force was ordered to Boston. These coercive demonstra-
tions greatly increased the public irritation, and diminished the hopes of recon-
ciliation. Slavish subinission or armed resistance,VWas now the alternative pre-

out the country. It consisted of fourteen articles. In addition to the non-intercourse provisions, it
was recommended to abandon the slave trade, to improve the breed of sheep to abstain from all extrav-
agance in living and indulgence in horse-racing, &c., and the appointment of a committee in every town
to promote conformity to the requirements of t11eAssocz'=at'ion. It wassigned by the 52 members present.

2. A Bill of Rights ; An address to the people of Great Britain, written by John Jay; another to the
several Anglo-American colonies, written by William Livingston ; another to the inhabitants of Quebec,

3. He also said in aletter to Stephen Sayre, on the 24th of December, 1774: “I have not Words to
express my satisfaction that the Congress has conducted this most arduous and delicate business, with
such manly wisdom and calm resolution, as do the highest honor to their deliberation.”

4. On the 8th of October, they unanimouslyiﬂesolved, That this Congress approve the opposition of
the inhabitants of the Massachusetts Bay, to the execution of the late acts of Parliament [verse 31, p.
170] and if the same shall be attempted to be carried into execution by force. in such case all America
ought to support them in their opposition.” This resolution, in letter and spirit, was the embodiment
of the Revolutionarysentiment. '

people were enrolled in companies, and prepared to take arms at a moment’s
warning. From this circumstance, they were called qminute-men. At the same
time, the Massachusetts leaders were laboring, with intense zeal, to place the
province in a condition to rise in open and united rebellion, when necessity
should demand. _ And all over the land, the provincial assemblies, public speak-
ers and the press, were boldly proclaiming the right of resistance. These do-
monstrations alarmed general Grage,1 and he commenced fortifying Boston
N eck.2 He also seized and conveyed to the city la.rge quantities of ammunition
found in the neighboring villages, and employed stringent measures for prevent-
ing intercourse between the patriots in the city and in the country. The exas-
perated people were anxious to attack the soldiers in Boston, but they were re-
strained by prudent counsellors?’ .

2. On the 3d of September, a rumor went abroad that British ships were can-
nonading Boston. Within two days, full thirty thousand minute-men were
under arms, and hastening toward that city. ‘ They were met by a contradiction
of the rumor; but the event conveyed such aportentous lesson to Gage, that he
pushed forward his military preparations with as much vigor as the opposition
of the people would allow.4 He thought it expedient to be more conciliatory;
and The summoned the colonial Assembly to meet at Salem on the 5th of
October. Then dreading their presence, he revoked the order. Ninety dele-
gates met, however,and. organized by the appointment of John Hancock-5 pres-
ident. They then went to Cambridge, where they formed a -Provincial Con-
gress, ’ independent of royal authority (the ﬁrst in America), and labored ear-
nestly in preparations for that armed resistance which now appeared inevitable.
They made provisions for an army of twelve thousand men; solicited other New
England colonies to augment it to twenty thousand; and appointed J edediah
Preble and Artemas Ward,5 men of experience in the French and Indian war,7
generals of all the troops that might be raised.

3. Such was the condition of affairs in America, when Parliament assembled
in 1775. , That body presented a scene of great excitement. Dr. Franklin and
others,3 then in England, had given a wide circulation to the Addresses put forth
by the Continenal Congress ;9 and the English mind was already favorably influ-
enced in favor of the Americans. Pitt came on crutches“) from his retirement, to
cast the weight of his mighty inﬂuence into the scale of justice, by action in the
House of Lords. He proposed conciliatory measures [J an. 7, 1775]. They
were rejected, as well as others by Burke, Conway, and Hartly; and in their

in 1775 ; and died in 1787.

2. The peninsula of Boston was originally connected with the main land by a narrow isthmus called the
Neck. It has been greatly widened by ﬁlling in the marginal morasses ; and over it now passes the ﬁne
avenue which connects the city with Roxbury, on the main.

3. Many hundreds of armed men assembled at Cambridge. At Charlestown, the people took possession
of the arsenal, after Gage had carried off the powder. At Portsmouth, N .H., they captured the fort, and
carried oil‘ the ammunition. At Newport, R. I., the people seized the powder, and took possession of
forty pieces of cannon at the entrance of the harbor. In New York, Philadelphia, Annapolis, Williams-
burg, Charleston and Savannah, the people took active defensive measures, and the whole country was
in a blaze of indignation. '

4. Carpenters refused to work on the fortiﬁcations ; and much of the material was destroyed by ﬁre, at
night, in spite of the vigilance of the guards. Gage sent to New York for timber and workmen. The
people there would not permit either to leave their port.

stead, Parliament struck another severe blow at the industry of New England
[March], by prohibiting ﬁshing on the banks of N ewfoundland.’ The Ministers
also endeavored to promote dissensions in America, by crippling the trade of the
southern and middle colonies, but. exempting New York, Delaware, and N orth
Carolina. The bait for these colonies was indignantly spurned. The scheme of
disunion signally failed. Common dangers and common interests drew the
ligaments of fraternity closer than ever. When the trees budded, and the
ﬂowers bloomed inthe Spring of 1775, all hope of reconciliation had vanished».
The people of the colonies, though weak in military resourees,_ were strong in
purpose; and, relying. upon the justice of their cause, and the assistance of the
]ﬁ0_1‘td_G0d Omnipotent, they resolved to defy the ﬂeets and armies of Great

r1 am. . - .

4.. There were three thousand British troops in Boston, on the 1st of April,
1775. Conﬁdent in his strength, Gage felt certain that he could repress insur-
rections, and keep the people quiet.» Yet he felt uneasy concerning the gather-
ingof ammunition and stores,2.by the patriots, at Concord, sixteen miles from
Boston. Toward midnight, on the 18th [April], he secretly despatched eight
hundred men, under lieutenant-colonel Smith and major Pitcairn, to destroy
them. All his precautions were vain. The vigilant Dr. Warren,3 who was
secretly watching all the movements of Gage, became aware of the expedition
early in the evening; and when it moved, Paul Revere4 had landed at Charles-
town, and was on his way to Concord to arouse the inhabitants and the minute-
men.-5 Soon afterward, church-bells, muskets and cannons spread the alarm
over the country; and when, at dawn [April 19, 1775], Pitcairn, with the ad-
vanced guard, reached Lexington, a few miles from Concord, he found seventy
determined minute-men drawn up to oppose him. Pitcairn rode forward, and
shouted, “Disperse! disperse, you rebels! ‘Down with your arms, and dis-
perse! ” They refused obedience, and he ordered his men to ﬁre. That dread-
ful order was obeyed, and the FIRST BLOOD on THE REVOLUTION ﬂowed upon the
tender grass on the Green at Lexington. Eight citizens were killed, and several
were wounded. The last survivor of that noble bandﬁ died in March, 1854, at
the age of almost ninety-six years.

5. The British now pressed forward to Concord, and destroyed the -stores.
They were terribly annoyed by the minute-men7 on their way, who ﬁred upon
them from behind walls, trees and buildings. Having accomplished their pur-
pose, and killed several more patriots in a skirmish there, the royal troops
hastily retreated to Lexington. The country was now thoroughly aroused, and
minute-men were gathering by scores. Nothing but the timely arrival of Lord
Percy with reinforcements, saved the eight hundred from total destruction. The
whole body now retreated. All the way back to Bunker’s 'Hill,8 in Charles-

town, the troops were terribly assailed by the patriots; and when, the follow- _

ing morning, they crossed over to Boston, they ascertailled their 10SS t0 be, in
killed and wounded, two hundred and seventy-three. The loss of the Americans
in killed, wounded and missing, was one hundred and three,‘ _

6. Intelligence of this tragedy spread over the country like a blaze of light-
ning from a midnight cloud, and like the attendant thunder-peal, it aroused all
hearts. From the hills and valleys of New England, the patriots went forth by
hundreds, armed and unarmed; and before the close of the -month [April 1775],
an army of twenty thousand men were forming camps and piling fortiﬁcations
around Boston, from Roxbury to the river Mystic, determined to conﬁne the
ﬁerce tiger of war, which had tasted their blood, upon that little peninsula.
The provincial Congress,‘2 sitting at Watertown, with Dr, Warren at its head,
Worked day and night in consonance with the gathering, army. They ap-
pointed military officers, organized a commissariat for supplies, issued bills of
credit for the payment of troops, for which the province was pledged,3 and de-

clared [May 5] general Gage to be an “inveterate enemy” of the people.

7. And as the intelligence went from colony to colony, the__ people there
were equally aroused. Arms and ammunition were seized by the Sons of
Liberty, provincial Congresses were formed, and before the close of Summer,
the power of every royal governor, from Massachusetts to Georgia, was utterly
destroyed. Everywhere the people armed in defence of their liberties, and
took vigorous measures for future security. Some aggressive enterprises were
undertaken by volunteers. .The most important of these was the seizure of the
strong fortresses of Ticonderoga4 and Crown‘Point,5 by Connecticut and Ver-
mont militia, under the command of colonels Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold.
Ticonderoga and its garrison were taken possession of at dawn, on the 10th of
May 1775; and two days afterward, colonel Seth Warner, of the expedition,
with a few /men, captured Crown Point. The spoils of victory taken at these
two posts, consisting of almost one hundred and ﬁfty pieces of cannon, and a
large quantity of ammunition and stores, were of vast consequence to the
Americans. A few months later [Mar. 177 6], some of these cannons were
hurling death-shots into the midst of the British troo s in Boston.5

8. On the 19th of May [17 75], the Provincial ongress of Massachusetts
clothed the Committee of Safety, sitting at Cambridge, with full powers to ‘regu-
late the ‘operations of the army. Artemas Ward was appointed commander-iii-
chief, Richard Grridley,7 chief engineer, and Putnam, Stark, and other veterans,
who had served bravely in the French and Indian War,8 were appointed to im-
portant commands. The military genius then developed, was now brought into
requisition. Day by day the position of the British army became more perilous.
Fortunately for its safety, large reinforcements, under three experienced com-
manders, generals Howe, Clinton, and Burgoyne, arrived at this juncture [May
25]. The whole British ‘force in Boston now amounted to about twelve thou-
sand men, besides several well-manned vessels of war, under Admiral Graves;

and Gage resolved to attack the Americans and penetrate the country.

9. On the 10th of June, Gage issued a proclamation declaring all Americans
in arms to be rebels and traitors, and offering a free pardonto all Who should
return to their" allegiance, eXcept those arch-oﬁ"enders, John Hancock,‘ and
Samuel Adams? These he intended to seize and send to England to be hanged.
The vigilantpatriots, aware of Gage’s hostile intentions, strengthened their in-
trenchments on Boston N eck,3 and on the evening of the 16th of June, general
Ward sent colonel Prescott4 with a detachment of one thousand men, to take
possession of, and fortify Bunker’s Hill, in Charlestown, which commanded an
important part of Boston, and the surrounding water. By mistake they ascended
Breed’s Hill, Within cannon shot of the city, and laboring with pick and spade
all that night, they had cast up a strong redoubt-5 of earth, on the summit of
that eminence, before the British were aware. of their presence. _Gage and his
officers were greatly astonished at the apparition of this military Work, at the
dawn of the 17th. .

10. The British generals perceived the necessity for
driving the Americans from this commanding position,
before they should plant a heavy battery? there, for in
that event, Boston must be evacuated before sunrise _
[June 17, 1775]. A heavy cannonade was opened upon

5. A redoubt is a small fortiﬁcation, generally composed of earth, and having very few features of a
regular fort, except its arrangement for the use of cannons and muskets. They are often temporary
structures, cast up in the progress of a siege, or a protracted battle. The diagram A, on the map, shows
the form of the redoubt ; at is the entrance. *

-foot of the eastern slope of Breed’s Hill, formed his troops into two columns,

and marched slowly to attack the redoubt. Although the British commenced
ﬁring cannons soon after they began to ascend the hill, and the great guns of
the ships, and the battery on Copp’s Hill, poured an incessant storm upon the
redoubt, the Americans kept perfect silence until they had approached within
close musket shot. Hardly an American could be seen by the slowly approacl1-
ing enemy, yet behind those rude mounds of earth, lay ﬁfteen hundred deter-
mined men,‘ ready to pour deadly vollies of musket balls upon the foe, when their

-commanders should order them. ~

11. When the British column was within ten rods of the redoubt, Pres-

cott shouted Fire.’ and instantly whole platoons of the assailants were prostrat-

ed by well-aimed bullets? The survivors fell back in great confusion, but were
soon rallied for a second attack. They were again repulsed, with heavy loss, and
while scattering in all directions, general Clinton arrived with a few followers,

and joined Howe as a volunteer. The fugitives were rallied, and they rushed up .

to the redoubt in the face of a galling ﬁre. For ten minutes the battle raged fear-

fully, and, in the meanwhile, Cliarlestown, at the foot of the eminence, having

been ﬁred by a carcass3 from Copp’s Hill,4 sent up dense columns of smoke, which
completely enveloped the belligerents. The ﬁring in the redoubt grew weaker,
for the ammunition of the ‘Americans became exhausted. It ceased, and then the
British scaled the bank and compelled the Americans to retreat, while they fought
ﬁercely with clubbed muskets.5 They ﬂed across Charlestown N eck,6 gallantly

covered by Putnam and a few brave men, and under that commander, took po-

sition on Prospect Hill, and-fortiﬁed it. The British took possession of Bunker’s
Hill,7 and erected afortiﬁcation there. There was absolutely no victory in the
case." Completely exhausted, both parties sought rest, and hostilities ceased for
a time. The Americans had lost, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, about four
hundred and ﬁfty men. The loss of the British from like causes, was almost
eleven hundred}? A This was the ﬁrst real ba25tZe9 of the Revolution, and lasted
almost two hours.

12. That beautiful day in June, bright and cloudless, was a terrible one for
Boston and its vicinity. All the morning, and during the ﬁerce conﬂict, roofs,
steeples, and every high place, in and around the city, were ﬁlled with anxious
spectators. Almost every family had a representative among the -combatants;

land in an agony of suspense, mothers, wives, sisters and daughters, gazed upon

the scene. Many a loved one perished; and therethe country lost one of its most
promising children, and freedom a devoted champion. Dr. Warren, who had

is ignited by a slow match when ﬁred, explodes, and its fragments produce terrible destruction.

5. Most of the American muskets were destitute of bayonets, and they used the large end as clubs.

6. Charlestown, like Boston, is on a peninsula, almost surrounded by water_and a marsh. The Neck
was a narrow causeway connecting it with the main. Charlestown was a ﬂourishing rival of Boston, at
the time of the battle. It was then completely destroyed. Six hundred buildings perished in ‘the
ﬂames. Burgoyne, speaking of the battle and conﬂagration, said, it was the most awful and sublime
si ht he had ever witnessed. _ -

%. As the battle took place on Breed’s, and not on Bu'n7rer’s Hill, the former name should have been
given to it, but the name of Bu.n7:er’s Hill is too sacred in the records ofxpatriotism to be changed.

8. The Provincial Congress estimated the loss at about 1,500; general Gage reported 1,054. Of the

Americans, only 115 were killed ; the remainder were wounded or made prisoners.

9. A battle is a conflict carried onby large bodies of troops, according to the rules of military tactics ;

and demanded and received from the royal representative, full restitution. And
before the battle of Bunker’s Hill,4 the exasperated people had driven Dun-
more5 from his palace at Williamsburg [June], and he was a refugee, shorn of
political power, on board a British man of war in the York river. .

14. In the meanwhile, a still bolder step had been taken in the interior of
North Carolina. Aconvention of delegates chosen by the people, assembled at
Charlotte, in Mecklenberg county [May, 1'7 7 5], and by a series of resolutions
virtually declared their constituents absolved from all allegiance to the British
crown,“ organized local government, and made provisions for military defense.

forward in the work of "public security. Having resolved on armed resistance,"

they voted to raise an army of twenty thousand men; and two days before the
battle of Bunker’s Hilll [June 15, 1775], they elected GEORGE WASHINGTON
commander-in-chief of all- the forces raised, or to be raised, for the defense of the
colonies? They adopted the incongruous mass of undisciplined troops at Bos-
ton,3 as a CONTINENTAL ARMY, and appointed general oﬁicers4 to assist Wash-
ington in its organization and future operations.

16. Washington took command of the army at Cambridge,’ on the 3d of July,
and with the efﬁcient aid of general Grates, who was doubtless the best disci-
plined soldier then in the ﬁeld, order was soon brought out of great confusion,
and the Americans were prepared to commence a regular siege of the British
army in Boston.-5 To the capture or expulsion of those troops, the efforts of
Washington were mainly directed during the summer and autumn of 1775.

His army, fourteen thousand strong, extended from Roxbury on the right, to.

Prospect Hill, two miles north-west of Breed’s Hill, on the left." The right was
commanded by general Ward, the left by general Lee. The centre, at Cam-
bridge, was under the immediate control of the commander-in-chief

17. The Canadians had been cordially invited to join their Anglo.-American“
neighbors,7 in efforts to obtain redress of grievances, but having very little sym-
pathy in language, religion or social condition with them, they refused, and were
necessarily considered positive supporters of the royal cause. The capture of
the two fortresses on Lake Champlain8- [May, 1775], having opened the way to
the St. Lawrence, a well-devised plan to take possession of that province and
prevent its becomingla place of rendezvous and supply of invading armies from
Great Britain, was matured by Congress and the commander-in-chief.9 To ac-
complish this, a body of New York and New England troops were placed under
the command of generals Schuyler“) and Montgomery,“ and ordered to proceed
by wayof Lake Champlain to Montreal and Quebec.

1. Verse 11, p. 177.

2. Washington was a delegate in Con gress from Virginia, and his appointment was wholly unexpected to '

him. When the time came to choose a commander-in-chief, John Adams arose, and after a brief speech,
in which he delineated the qualities of the man whom he thought best ﬁtted for the important service,
he nominated Washington. That patriot was gazing intently in the face of Mr. Adams, at the moment,
and when his name fell from the lips of the speaker, he rushed into an adjoining room, utterly abashed.
Congress immediately adjourned, and the next day Washington was elected commander-in-chief. At
the same time Congress resolved that they would “maintain and assist him, and adhere to him, with
their lives and fortunes, in the causeof American liberty.” When President Hancock announced to
Washington his appointment, he modestly and with great dignity, signiﬁed his acceptance in the follow-
ing terms: “ Mr. President,—-Though I am truly sensible of the high honor done me, in this appoint-
ment, yet Ifeel great distress, from a consciousness that my abilities and military experience may not
be equal to the extensive and important trust. However, as the Congress desire it, I will enter upon the
momentous duty, and exert every power I possess in their service, and for the support of the glorious
cause. I beg they will accept my most cordial thanks for this distinguished testimony of their appro-
bation. But lest some unlucky event should happen, unfavorable to my reputation, I beg it may be re-
membered by every gentleman in this room, that I, this day declare with the utmost sincerity, I do not
think myself equal to the command I am honored with. As to pay sir, I beg leave to assure the Con-
gress that, as no pecuniary consideration could have tempted me to accept the arduous employment, at
the expense of my domestic ease and happiness, I do not wish to make any proﬁt from it-. I will
kgepxan exact aclcount of my expenses. Those, I doubt not, they will discharge, and that is all I desire.”

18 THE ABORIGINES.

The (Jatawbas were- almost annihilated by them after a battle of two days. So
determined were the FIVE NATIONS to subdue the southern tribes, that when, in
1744, they ceded a part of their lands to Virginia, they reserved a perpetual
privilege of a war-path through the territory. J

5. After the Tuscaroms were defeated by the Carolinians, in 1712,‘ they came
northward, and in 1714 joined the FIVE NATIONS}; From that time the con-
federacy was known as the SIX NATIONS. They were generally the sure friends
of the English and inveterate foes of the French.9‘1 They were all friends of the
British during the Revolution, except a part of the Onezdas. The Mohawk: were
theimost active enemies of the Americans; and were obliged to leave the State
and take refuge in Canada at the close of the Revolution. The others were al-
lowed to remain, and now [1854] mere fragments of that great confederation
exists, and, in habits and character, they are radically changed. The confederacy
was forever extinguished by the sale of the residue of the Seneca lands in 1838.
In 1715,‘ the confederacy numbered more than forty thousand souls; now [1854]
they are probably less than four thousand, most of whom are upon lands beyond
the Mississippi.

SECTION IV.

THE CATAWBAS.

1. The CATAWBAS occupied lands uponthe Yadkin and Catawba Rivers,
south of the Tuscaroms, on both sides of the line between North and South
Carolina. They were brave but not warlike, and their conﬂicts were usually in
defence of their territory. They expelled the fugitive Shaumees, [1672,]3 but were
overmatched and desolated bythe warriors of_ the FIVE N ATIONS4 [1701]. They
assisted the white people of South Carolina against the Tuscaroms and con-
federates in 1712 ;5 but when, three years afterward, the southern tribes, from
the N e_u_se region to that of the St. Mary’s in Florida, and westward to the Ala-
bama, seven thousand strong, confederated in an attempt to exterminate the
Carolinians,5 the Uatctwbas were among them.

2. In 1760 the CATAWBAS were again the friends of the Carolinians when the
Oizeroicees made war upon them,7 and they remained true friends of the white
people afterward. They joined the Americans during the Revolution, and ha.ve
ever since experienced the fostering care of the State, in some degree.3
Their chief Village was upon the Catawba river near the mouth of the Fishing
Creek,-9 and there the remnant of the nation, numbering less than a hundred
souls, a.re now [1854] living upon a reservation, a few miles square. Their an-
cient language is almost extinct. ' .

ordained me for the forests, and my ambition is the shade, But the. strength of my arm decays, ‘H rl
my feet fail me in the chase. The hand that fought for your liberties, is now open to you for relief.”
Apension was granted.

of August, 1775. Deceived in regard to
the strength of the garrison and the dispo-
sition of the Canadians and the neighbor-
ing Indians, Schuyler fell back to Isle Aux
Noix,1 and after making preparations to for-
tify it, hastened to Ticonderoga to urge for-
ward more troops. Sickness compelled him
to return to Albany, and the whole com-
mand devolved upon Montgomery. That
energetic officer did not remain long within
his island entrenchments, and toward the
close of September, he laid siege to St.
,_ John. The garrison maintained an obsti-
GENERAL SCHUYLER,  nate resistance for more than a month, and

.. ' Montgomery twice _resolved to abandon it.

19. During the siege, small detachments of brave men went out upon daring
enterprises. One of eighty men, under colonel Ethan Allen,2 pushed across the
St. Lawrence, and attacked Montreal [Sept. 25, 1775], then garrisoned by quite
a strong force under general Prescott.3 Allen and his party were defeated, and
he was made prisoner and sent to England in irons. Another expedition under
colonel Bedell, of New Hampshire, was more successful. They captured the
strong fort (but feeble garrison) at Chambly [Oct. 30], a few miles north of St.
John; and at about the same time, Sir Guy Carleton, governor of Canada, with
a reinforcement for the garrison of St. John, was repulsed [N 0v. 1] by a party
under colonel Warner, at Longueuil, nearly opposite Montreal. These events
alarmed Preston, the commander at St. John, and he surrendered that post to
Montgomery, on the 3d of November.

20. The Americans now pressed forward to Montreal. Carleton had escaped
from thence to Quebec, and the city and garrison were surrendered [N ov. 13],
after afeeble resistance. Leaving a garrison there, and at St. John and Cham-
bly, Montgomery, with a little more than three hundred ill-clad troops, hurried

21. While this expedition, so feeble in number and supplies, was on its way"

to achieve a great purpose, another, consisting of a thousand men, under colonel
Benedict Arnold,4 had left Cambridge [Sept. 1775], and was making its way
through the deep wilderness by the Kennebec and Chaudiere5 rivers, to join Mont-
gomery before the walls of Quebec. After enduring incredible toils and hard-
ships in traversing dark forests and tangled morasses ﬁlled with snow and ice,
and exposed to intense cold and biting hunger, they arrived at Point Levi,6 op-

February 1789, and his remains lie in a cemetery two miles from Burlington, near the Winooski.

posite Quebec, on the 9th of November. Four days afterward [Nov. 13], the
intrepid Arnold, with only seven hundred and ﬁfty half naked men, not more

than four hundred muskets, and no‘ artillery, crossed the St. Lawrence to Wolfe’s

Cove,1 ascended to the Plains of Abraham,‘2 and boldly demanded a surrender of
the city and garrison within the massive walls. Soon the icy winds, and intel-
ligenceiof an intended sortie3 from the garrison, drove Arnold from his bleak
encampment, and he ascended the St. Lawrence to Point cm Trembles, twenty
miles above Quebec, and there awaited the arrival of _Montgomery. They
met on the 1st of December [177 5], and -woolen clothes which Montgomery
had captured at Montreal, were placed on the shivering limbs of Arnold’s troops.
The united forces, about nine hundred strong, then marched to Quebec.

22. The Americans reached Quebec on the evening of the 5th, and the next
morning Montgomery sent a letter to Carleton, by a ﬂag,4 demanding an immed-
iate surrender. The flag was ﬁred upon, and the invaders were deﬁed. With a few
‘light cannons and some mortars, and exposed to almost daily snow storms in

the open ﬁelds, the Americans besieged the city for three weeks. Success appear- _

ing only in assault, that measure was agreed upon, and
before dawn, on the morning of the last day of the year
[Dec. 31, 17 75], ‘while snow was falling thickly, the attempt
was made. Montgomery had formed his little army into
four columns, to assail the city at different points. One of
these, under Arnold, was to attack the lower town, and
marchalong the St. Charles to join another division under
Montgomer , who was to approach by way of Cape Dia-
mond,5 and the two were to attempt a forced passage into
the city, ‘through Prescott gateﬁ At the same time the
other two columns, under Majors Livingston and Brown,
were to make a feigned attack upon the upper town, from
the Plains of Abraham.7 . . «- .
23. Montgomery descended Wolfe’s ravine,8 and marched WALLS or QUEBEC,

carefully along the ice-strewn beach, toward a palisade and

battery at Cape Diamond. At the head of his men, in the face of the driving
snow, he had passed the palisade unopposed, when a single discharge of acannon
from the battery,9 loaded with grape-shot, 1” killed him instantly, and slew several
of his officers. His followers instantly retreated. In the meanwhile, Arnold
had been severely wounded, while attacking a barrier on the St. Charles,“
and the command devolved upon Captain Morgan,” whose expert riﬂemen,

their brethren in Virginia were rolling on the car of Revolution with success.
After Dunmore’s escape [June 8, 1775] to the British man-of-war,4 he collected
a force of Tories and negroes, and commenced depreda- 1
tions in lower Virginia. With the aid of some British
vessels, he attacked Hampton [Oct. 24], and was repulsed.
He then declared open war. The Virginia militia ﬂew to
arms,5 and in a severe battle at the Great Bridge, near the
Dismal Swamp, twelve miles from Norfolk, Dunmore was V.  ._ \

the Summer and Autumn of 1775, the continental Con-

I the opening of 17 7 6, many expert privateersmentf were hovering along our coasts,

to the great terrorand annoyance of British merchant vessels.

2. In the meanwhile, Parliament had made extensive arrangements for crush-
ing the rebellion. .An act was passed [Nov., 1775], which declared the revolted
colonists to be rebels ; forbade all intercourse with them; authorized the seizure

volted colonies. In one corner was the device of the British Union Flag namely, the cross of St.
George, composed of ahorizontal and perpendicular bar, and the cross of’ St. Andrew (representing
Scotland), which is in the form of an X. This ﬂag is represented in the sketch. On the 14th of June,
1777, Congress ordered “thirteen stars, white, in a blue ﬁeld,” to be put in the place of the British
union device. Such is the design of our ﬂag at the present day. A star has been added for every new
State admitted into the Union.

1, Verse 11, p. 177. ’
2. At the beginning of. 1780, Congress had issued two hundred millions of dollars in paper money.

After the second year, these bills began to depreciate ; and in 1780, forty paper dollars were worth only
one in specie. At the close of 1781, they were worthless. They had performed a temporary good, but
were ﬁnally ‘productive of great public evil, and much individual suffering. .

4. Private individuals, having a license from government to arm and equip a vessel, and with it, to
depredate upon the commerce of a nation with which that people are then at war, are called privateers.
During the Revolution, a vast number of English vessels were captured by American privateersmen.
It is, after all, only legalized piracy, and enlightened nations begin to view it so.

and destruction or conﬁscation of all American vessels; and placed the colonies
under martial law.‘ An aggregate land and naval force of ﬁfty-ﬁve thousand
men, was voted for the American service, and more than a million of dollars
were appropriated for their pay and sustenance. In addition to these, seven-
teen thousand troops were hired by the British government, from the Landgrave
of Hesse Cassel and other petty German rulers,2 to come hither to butcher loyal

subjects who had petitioned for their rights for ten long years, and now, even

with arms in their hands, were praying for justice and begging for reconciliation.
This last act ﬁlled the cup of government iniquity to the brim. Itwas de-
nounced in Parliament by the true friends of England, as “disgraceful to the
British name;” and it extinguished the last hope of reconciliation. The sword
was now drawn, and the scabbard thrown away. _

3. When intelligence of these parliamentary proceedings reached America
[Jan., 1776], Congress perceived the necessity of immediate and efficient ef-
forts for the defence of the extensive sea-coast of the colonies. Washing-
ton was urged to attack the British in Boston, immediately; and, by great

efforts, the army was augmented to about fourteen thousand men, toward the

close of February. Bills of credit, representing four millions of dollars more,
were issued; and on the ﬁrst of March, Washington felt strong enough to at-
tempt a dislodgement of the enemy from the crushed city.3 _

4. A heavy cannonade was opened upon Boston, from all the American bat-
teries, on the evening of the 2d of March [17 76], and was continued, with brief
intermissions, until the 4th. On the evening of that day, general Thomas,4 With
a strong party,5 proceeded secretly to a high hill, near Dorchester, on the south
side of Boston; and before morning, they cast up a line of strong entrenchments,
and planted heavy cannons there, which completely commanded the city and
harbor. These works greatly astonished and alarmed the British. Perceiving
the imminent peril of both ﬂeet and army, general Howe prepared an expe-
dition to drive the Americans from their vantage ground on Dorchester heights.
A storm suddenly arose, and made the harbor impassable. The delay allowed
the patriots time to make their work almost impregnable, and the British were
compelled to surrender as prisoners of war, or to evacuate the city immediately,
to avoid destruction. As prisoners, they would have been excessively burden-
some to the colonies; so, having informally agreed to allow them to depart
without injury, Washington had the inexpressible pleasure of saying, in a letter
written to the President of Congress, on the 17th of March, “that this morning
the Ministerial troops evacuated the town of Boston, without destroying it, and
that we are now in full possession.” Seven thousand soldiers, four thousand
seamen, and ﬁfteen hundred families of loyalists,5 sailed for Halifax on that day.

. 1. ‘Note 8 p. 129. '

2. The Landgrave (or petty prince) of Hesse Cassel, having furnished the most considerable portion
of these troops, they were called by the general name of Hessians. Ignorant, brutal and bloodthirsty,
they were hated by the patriots, and despised even by the regular English army. They were always
employed in posts of greatest danger, or in expeditions least creditable. These troops cost the British
government almost eight hundred thousand dollars, besides the necessity, according to the contract, of
defending the little principalities thus stripped, against their foes.

5. Twelve hundred men, with intrenching tools, and a guard of eight hundred.

6. It must be remembered that the Americans were by no means unanimous in their opposition to
Great Britain. From the beginning there were many who supported the. crown ; and as the colonists be-
came more and more rebellious, these increased. Some because they believed their brethren to be
wrong ; others through timidity ; and a greater number because they thought it their -interest to adhere
to the king. The loyalists, or Tories, were the worst and most efficient enemies of the Whigs [note 3, p.
171] during the whole war. Those who left Boston at this time, were afraid to encounter the exasperated

The Americans immediately marched into the city, with drums beat_ing and ban-
ners waving, greeted on every side with demonstrations of joy by the redeemed
people. i

5. Washington had been informed, early in
J anuary, that general Sir Henry Clinton had
sailed from Boston with a considerable body
of troops, on a secret expedition. General
Charles Lee was immediately despatched to Con-
necticut to raise troops, and to proceed to New
York to oppose Clinton, if that should be his
place of destination. Six weeks before the evac-
uation of Boston [March 17, 1776], Lee had en-
camped near New York with twelve hundred
militia, Already the Sons of Liberty‘ had seized
the cannons at Fort George,2 and driven Tryon,3
the royal governor, on board a British armed
vessel in the harbor. In March, Clinton arrived
at Sandy Hook, just outside New York harbor, GENERAL LEE- ‘
and on the same day, Lee4 entered the city. The
movement was timely, for Clinton was kept at bay. Foiled in his attempt upon.
New York, that commander sailed southward, where we shall meet him pres-
ently.5 ‘

-6. Washington was ignorant of Howe’s destination; but supposing he would
proceed to New York, he put the main body of his army in motion toward that
city, as soon as he had placed Boston in a state of security. He arrived in New
York about the middle of April [April 14.], and proceeded at once to fortify the
town and vicinity, and also the passes of the Hudson Highlands, ﬁfty miles
above. A‘ In the meanwhile, general Lee, who had been appointed to command
the American forces in the South, had left his troops in the charge of general
Lord Stirling [March 7], and was hastening toward the Carolinas to watch the
movements of Clinton, and gather an army there.

7. A considerable ﬂeet under admiral Sir Peter Parker, was sent from
England in the spring of 1776, to operate against the sea-coast towns of the
southern colonies. A Parker was joined by Clinton, at Cape Fear, in May, when
the latter took the chief command of all ' the land forces. The ﬂeet arrived oﬂ‘

Carolina militia, under colonel Caswell, over ﬁfteen hundred loyalists [Feb. 27,

-177 6], (chieﬂy Scotch Highlanders), on Moore’s Creek,6 the southern patriots
-had cheerfully responded to the call of general Rutledge, and about six thousand

patriots, when they should return to their desolated homes in the city, from which they had been driven

by military persecution. The churches had been stripped of their pulpits and pews, for fuel, ﬁne shade

treiesllriad been burned, and many houses had been pillaged and damaged by the soldiery.

armed men had collected in and near Charleston, when the enemy appeared?
The city and eligible posts near it, had been for-
tiﬁed, and quite a strong fort, composed of pal-
meto logs and sand, and armed with twenty-
six mounted cannons, had been erected upon
Sullivan’s Island, to command the channel

 
    

 

 2, leading to the town. This fort was garrisoned
  by about ﬁve hundred men, chieﬂy militia,

 8. A combined attack, by land ‘and water,
\\  upon Sullivan’s Island, was-commenced by the
/~ British, on the morning of the 28th of June,
“ ' 17 7 6. While the ﬂeet was pouring a terrible
storm of iron balls upon Fort Sullivan, Clinton

. endeavored, but in vain, to force a passage’
G'ENEML MOUL1-Rm, across a narrow creek which divided the two‘
islands in order to attack. the et unﬁnished‘

fortress in the rear. But colonel Thompson, with a small batte§1r*y on the east
end of the island, repelled every forward movement of Clinton, while the can-
nons of the fort were spreading terrible havoc among the British vessels.3 The
conﬂict raged for almost ten hours, and only ceased when night fell upon the
scene. Then the British ﬂeet, almost shattered into fragments, withdrew, and

abandoned the enterprise.4 The slaughter of the British had been frightful-

Two hundred and twenty-ﬁve had been killed or wounded, while only two of -

the garrison were killed, and twenty-two wounded.5 The British departed for,

New York three days afterward‘? [June 31, 17 76], and for‘ more than two years
the din of war was not heard below the Roanoke. This victory had a most
inspiriting effect upon the patriots throughout the land.

9. While these events were transpiring in the South, and while Washington
was augmenting and strengthening the continental army at New York, and
British troops and German hirelings7 were approaching by thousands, the Con-
gress, now in permanent session in the State House at Philadelphia, had a ques-
tion of vast importance under consideration. A few men, looking beyond the
storm-clouds of the present, beheld bright visions of glory for their country,

active oﬂicer until made prisoner in 1780, when for two years he was not allowed to bear aims. He died
in 1805. He wrote a very interest.ing memoir of the War in the South.

3. At one time every man but admiral Parker was swept from the deck of his vessel. Among those
who were badly wounded, was lord William Campbell, the royal governor of South Carolina. He af-
terward died of his wounds.

4. ‘The Acteon, a large vessel, grounded on a. shoal between Fort Sullivan and the city, where she was
burned by the Americans. . . .

5. The strength of the fort consisted in the capacity of the spongy palmeto logs, upon which cannon
balls would make very little impression. It appeared 8 to be a very insecure defence, and Lee advised
Moultrie to abandon it, when the British approached. But that brave otﬁcer would not desert it, and
was rewarded with victory. The ladies of Charleston presented his regiment with a pair of elegant

colors, and the “slaughter pen,” as Lee ironically called Fort Sullivan, was named Fort Moultrie.
During the action, the staff, bearing a large ﬂag, was cut down. by a cannon ball from the ﬂeet. The 5.

colors fell outside the fort. A sergeant named Jasper, leaped down from one of the bastions, and in the
midst of the iron hail that was pouring from the fort, coolly picked up the ﬂag, ascended to the bastion,
and calling for a sponge-st-aﬁ”, tied the colors to it, stuck it in the sand, and then took his place among his
companions in the fort. A few days afterward, governor Rutledge took his own sword from his side,
and presented it to the brave J asper. ’ . -

when the people, now declared to be rebels,‘ and out of the protection of the
British king, should organize themselves
into a sovereign nation. This grand idea
began to ﬂash through the popular mind at » 3%
the close of "1775 ; and when, early in 1776,  -7 "
it was tangibly spokenby Thomas Paine, in »—‘
a pamphlet entitled Common Sense? and =-
whose vigorous thoughts were borne by the
press to every community, a desire for In- ,U ,.,__,V_~.-V
dependence ﬁlled the hearts of the people. "Ml iii
In less than eighty days after the evacua- '- .‘
tion of Boston [March 17, 1776], almost “";=_'
every provincial assembly had spoken in .
favor of z'ndepe«ndence; and on the 7th of STATE HOUSE-
June, Richard Henry Lee,3 of Virginia, of-
fered to the consideration of the Continental~Congress, the following resolution:
“Resolved, That these united colonies are, and, of right, ought to be, free and in-
dependent States; that they _are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown,
and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain,
is, and ought to. be, totally dissolved.”4 ~

10. This resolution did not meet with general favor in Congress, at first.
Many yet hoped, even against hope, for reconciliation, and thoughtit premature,
and there were some timid ones who trembled while standing so near the bor-
ders of high treason. After debating the subject for three days, the further
consideration of it was postponed until the ﬁrst of July. A committee-5 was
appointed [J une 11], however, to draw up a declaration in accordance with the
resolution and were instructed to report on the same day when the latter should
be called up. Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia, the youngest member of the com-
mittee, waschosen its chairman, and to him was assigned the task of preparing
the Declaration.“ Adams and Franklin made a few alterations in his draft, and
it was submitted to Congress at the same hour when Mr. Lee’s resolution was
taken up for consideration. On the following day [July 2], the resolution was
adopted by a large majority. The Declaration was debated almost two days
longer; and ﬁnally, at about mid-day, on the 4th of July, 1776, the represen-
tatives of thirteen colonies unanimously declared them free and independent
States, under the name of THE UNITED STATES or AMERICA. Only John

Hancock,7 the president of Congress, signed it on that day, and thus it first went

papers, called The C"I"L8’L8. ‘The first number was written in Fort Lee, on the Hudson, in December, 1776,
and published while Washington was on the banks of the Delaware. See verse 21, p. 192. These had a
powerful effect in stimulating the people to etlbrts for independence.

forth to the world. It was ordered to be written
on parchment, and on the 2d of August following,
the names of all but two_of the ﬁfty-six signers,‘
were placed upon it. These two. were added
afterward. It had then been read to the army;2
at public meetings; from a hundred pulpits, and
in all legislative ‘halls in the land, and every-
where awakened the warmest responses of ap-
proval.
11. General Howe left Halifax-”*_on the 11th of
‘June [17 7 6], and arrived at Sandy Hook, on the
29th. On the 2d of July he took possession of
JOHN HANCOCK E Staten Island, where he was joined by Sir Henry
Clinton [July 11], from the South,4 and his brother,
admiral lord Howe [July 12], with a ﬂeet and a large land force, from England.
Before the ﬁrst of August, other vessels arrived with a part of the Hessian
troops,5 and on that day, almost thirty thousand soldiers, many of them tried
veterans, stood ready to fall upon the Republican army of seventeen thousand
men,5 mostly militia, which lay intrenched in New Yorkand vicinity, less than
a dozen miles distant.7 The grand object in view was the seizure of New
York and the country along the Hudson, so as to keep open a communication
with Canada, separate the patriots of New England from those of the other
States, and to overrun the most populous portion of the revolted colonies.
12. Lord Howe,8 a11d his brother, the general, were commissioned to “grant

 

H pardon to all who deserved mercy,” and to treat for peace, but only on terms of

absolute submission on the part of the colonies, to the will of the king and par-
liament. After making a foolish display of arrogance and weakness, in address-
ing general Washington as a private gentleman,9 and being assured that the
Americans had been guilty of no»oﬁ“ence requiring a “ pardon ’? at their hands,
they prepared to strike an immediate and effective blow. The British army
was accordingly put in motion on the morning of the 22d of August [177 6]; and
during that day, ten thousand effective men, and forty pieces of cannon, were
landed on the western end of Long Island, between the present Fort Hamilton
and Grravesend Village. '

1. This document, containing the autographs of those venerated fathers of our republic, is carefully
preserved in a glass case, in the rooms of the National Institute, at Washington city. Not one of a 1
that band of patriots now survives. Charles Carrol was the last to leave us. He departed in 1832, at
the age of ninety years. It is worthy of remembrance that not one of all those signers of the Declaration
of Independence, died with a tarnished reputation. The memory of all, is sweet.

2. Washington caused it to be read at the head of each brigade of the army, then in New York city,
on the 9th of July. That night, citizens and soldiers pulled down the leaden equestrian statue of George
III., which stood in the Bowling Green, and it was soon afterward converted into bullets for the use of
the Continental Army. The statue was gilded.

6. There were about 27,000 men enrolled, but not more than 17,000 men were ﬁt for duty. A great many
were sick, and a large number were without arms.

7. Many of the ships passed through the Narrows, and anchored in the Bay. Howe’s ﬂag-ship, the
Eagle, lay near Governor’s Island. While in that position, a bold soldier went in a submarine vessel,
with a machine for blowing up a ship, and endeavored to fasten it to the bottom of the Eagle, but failed.
He was discovered, and barely escaped. An explosion took place near the Eagle, and she was hastily
moved further down the Bay. This was called a torpedo.

8. Richard, earl Howe, was brother of the young lord Howe[verse 32, p. 149], killed at Ticondero- ‘

ga. He was born in 1725, and died in 1799. A

9. The letters of lord Howe to the American commander-in-chief, were addressed “George Washing-
ton, Esq.” As that did not express the public character of the chief, and as he would not confer with
the enemies of his country in a private capacity, Washington refused to receive the letters. Howe was
instructed not to acknowledge the authority of Congress in any way, and as Washington had received
his commission from that body, to address him as “general,” would have been a recognition of its-au-
thority. He meant no disrespect to Washington.

13. Detachments of Americans under general Sullivan, occupied a fortiﬁed
camp at Brooklyn, opposite New York, and guarded several passes in a range
of hills which extend from the Narrows to the
village of Jamaica. When intelligence of the
landing of the invading army reached Wash-
ington, he sent general Putnam,1 with large re-
inforcements, to take the chief command on
Long Island, and to prepare to meet the enemy.
The . American troops on the Island now
numbered about ﬁve thousand [August 26].
The British approached in three divisions. The
left, under general Grant, marched along the
shore toward Gowanus; the right under Clinton
and Cornwallis, toward the interior of the
island, and the centre, composed chieﬂy of Hes-
sians,2 under de Heister, marched up the Flat-
bush road, south of the hills. GENERAL PUTMM-

New York. At the same time, Grant was pressing forward along the shore of
New York Bay, and at day-break, encountered lord Stirling,3 where the monu-
ments of Greenwood cemetery now dot the hills. De Heister advanced from
Flatbush at the same hour, and attacked Sullivan, who, having no suspicions of

. the movements of Clinton, was watching the Flatbush Pass. A bloody conﬂict
ensued, and while it was progressing, Clinton descended from the wooded hills, w

by the way of Bedford, to gain Sullivan’s rear. As soon as the latter perceived
his peril, he ordered a retreat to the American lines at Brooklyn. It was too
late; Clinton drove him back upon the Hessian bayonets, and after ﬁghting des-
perately hand to hand, with the fee in front
and rear, and losing a greater portion of his
_ men, Sullivan was compelled to surrender.
 ' ' 15. While these disasters were occurring
  ' ‘- on the left, Cornwallis descended the post—road
to Gowanus, and attacked Stirling. They
fought desperately, until Stirling was made
pr-isoner. Many of his troops were drowned
while endeavoring to escape across the Gow-
anus creek, as the tide was rising, andalarge
number were made prisoners. At noon the
. victory for the British was complete. About
BATTLE ON LONG ISLAND, ﬁve hundred Americans were killed or wound-
ed, and_ eleven hundred made prisoners. These
were soon suffering dreadful horrors in prisons and prison-ships at New York.4

SECTION V. ,
-THEACHEROKEE&

1. Westward, and adjoining the Tuscaromsl and Catawbas? were the CHERO-
KEES, the brave and noble mountaineers of the South. Their beautiful land ex-
tended from the Carolina Broad River on the East, to the Alabama on the West,
including the Whole of the upper portion of Georgia from the head waters of the
Alatamaha, to those of the Tennessee. It is one of the most delightful regions
of the United States. .

2. The Cherokees were the determined foes of the Shctwnees,3 and ﬁnally drove
them from the country South of the Ohio river. They joined with the Catawbas
and the white people against the Tusearoms in 1712,4 but were members of the
great confederation against the Carolinians in 1715.5

3. The CHEROKEES and the FIVE NATIONS had bloody contests for a long
time. A reconciliation Was effected by the English about the year 1750, and the
Cherolcees became the allies of the peace-makers, against the French. They as-
sisted in the capture of Fort Du Quesne in 1758/5 but their irregularities on their
return along the border. settlements of Virginia, gave the white people an ap-
parent excuse for killing two or three warriors. Hatred was engendered, and
the Cherokees soon afterward retaliated by spreading destruction along the fron-
tiers.7 Hostilities continued a greater portion of three years, when peace was es-
tablished in 1761, and no more trouble ensued.

4. The Cherokees adhered to the British during the Revolution; and for eight»

years afterward they continued to annoy the people of the upper county of the
Carolinas. They .were reconciled by treaty in 1791. They were friends of the
United States in 1812, and assisted in the subjugation of the Creeks.8 ' Civiliza-
tion was rapidly elevating them from the condition of roving savages, to agricul-
turists and artisans, when their removal west of the Mississippi was required.
They had established schools, a printing press, and other means for improvement
and culture, when they were obliged to leave their farms and the graves of their
fathers, for anew home in the wilderness. They are inva fertile country, watered
by the Arkansas and itsptributaries, and are in a prosperous condition. They
now [1854] number about fourteen thousand souls.9

The British. loss in killed, wounded,’ and prisoners, was three hundred and
sixty-seven. .
16. Washington had viewed the destruction of his troops, with the deepest an-

guish, yet he dared not weaken his power in the city,‘ by sending reinforce-V
ments. He crossed over on the following morning [Aug. 28], with Mifﬂin,‘ who_

had come down from the upper end of York island with a thousand troops,
and was gratiﬁed to ﬁnd the enemy encamped in front of Putnam’s lines, and
delaying an attack until the British ﬂeet should co-operate With him. The de-
lay allowed Washington time to form and execute a plan for the salvation of the
remainder of the army, now too weak to resist an assault with any hope of suc-
cess. Under cover of a heavy fog on the night of the 29th, and morning of
the 30th, he silently withdrew them from the camp,2 and, _unperceived by the
British, they all crossed over to New York in safety, carrying. everything with
them but their heavy cannons. Wheii the fog rolled away, and the sunlight
burst upon Brooklyn and New York, the last boat-load of patriots had reached
the city shore. Howe, who felt sure, of his prey, was greatly mortiﬁed, and
prepared-to make an immediate attack upon New York, before the Americans
should become reinforced, or should escape from it.3

17. Had true patriotism prevailed in every heart in the American army, it
might have maintained its position in the city, and kept the British at bay. But
there were a great number of merely selﬁsh men in the camp. Sectional differ-
ences4 weakened the bond of union, and immorality of every kind prevailed.
There was also a general spirit of insubordination, and the disasters on Long
Island disheartened the timid.’ Hundreds deserted the cause and went home.
Never, during the long struggle of after years, was the hopeful mind of Wash-
ington more clouded by doubts, than during the month of September, 1776. In
the midst of the gloom and gerplexity, he called a council of war [Sept. 12th],
and it was determined to sen the military stores to a secure place up the Hud-
son,5 and to retreat to and fortify Harlem Heights,“ near the upper end of York
Island.7 This was speedily accomplished; and when, on the 15th, a strong de-
tachment of the British army crossed the East river and landed three miles
above the town,8 without much opposition,-9 the greater portion of the Americans
were busy in fortifying their new camp on Harlem Heights.

3. He ordered several vessels of War to sail around Long Island, and come down the Sound to Flushing
Bay, so as to cover the intended landing of the troops upon the main, in Westchester county [verse 19,
p. 191]. In the meanwhile, Howe made an overture for peace, supposing the late disaster would dispose
the Americans ‘to listen eagerly to almost any proposition for reconciliation. He paroled general Sulli-
van, and by him sent a verbal communication to Congress, suggesting a committee for conference. It

sEooND YEAR or THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE. 191

18. The British detachment formed a line almost across the island to Bloom-
ingdale, within two miles of the American entrenchments just beyond the pres-
ent Manhattanville, While the main army on Long Island was stationed at dif-
ferent points from Brooklyn to Flushing.‘ On the 16th, deta.chments of the bel-
ligerents met on Harlem plains, and a severe skirmish ensued. The Americans
were victorious, but their triumph cost the lives of two brave ofﬁcers——colonel
Knowlton of Connecticut, and major Leitch of Virginia. The effect of the vic-
tory iwasinspiriting; and so faithfully did the patriots ply muscle and imple-
ment, that before Howe could make ready to attack them, they had constructed
double lines of intrenchments, and were prepared to defy him.

19. Perceiving the inutility of attacking the Americans in front, Howe next
endeavored to gain their rear. Leaving quite a strong force in possession of the
city? [Sept-20], he sent three armed vessels up the Hudson to cut off the Amer-
ican» communications with New Jersey, while the great bulk of his army (now
reinforced by an arrival of fresh troops from England),3 made their way [Oct.
12] to a point in Westchester county,4 beyond the Harlem river. When Wash-
ington perceived the designs of his enemy, he placed a garrison of almost three
thousand men, under colonel Magaw, in'Fort Washington,5 and withdrew the
remainder of his army5 to a position on the Bronx river, in Westchester county,
to oppose Howe, or retreat in safety to the Hudson Highlands, if necessary. He
established his head quarters at White Plains village, and there, on the 28th of
October, asevere engagement took place [N 0v. 1, 1776.7] ‘The Americans were
driven from their position, and three days afterwards, formed a strong camp on
the hills of North Castle, ﬁve miles farther north. The British general was afraid’
to pursue them; and after strengthening the post at Peekskill at the lower en-
trance to the Highlands, and securing the vantage ground at North Castle,8 Wash-
ington crossed the Hudson [N ov. 12] with the main body of his army, and joined
general Greene at Fort Lee, on the Jersey shore, about two miles below Fort‘
Washington. This movement was made on account of an apparent preparation
by the British to invade New Jersey and march upon Philadelphia, where the
Congress was in session.9 .

20.. Previous to the engagement at White Plains, general Knyphausen and a
large body of Hessiansw who had arrived at New York, had joined the invading
army. After Washington had crossed the Hudson, these German troops and a

1. Wishing to ascertain the exact condition of the British army, Washington engaged Captain Na-
than Hale, of Knowlton’s regiment, to visit their camps on Long Island. He was caught, taken to
Howe’s head quarters at New York, and executed as a. spy by the brutal provost-marshal, Cunning-
ham. He was not allowed to have a bible nor clergyman during his last hours, nor to send letters to
friends. His fate and Andre’s [verse16,p.228] have been compared. See Onderdonlﬂs Rev. Incidents, &c.

2. At one o’clock on t-he morning of the 21st, a ﬁre broke out in a small groggery near the foot of Broad
street, and before it was extinguished, about ﬁve hundred. buildings were destroyed. The British
charged the ﬁre upon the Americans. Although such incendiarism had been contemplated, this was
purely accidental. - . - '

one hundred eighty-sixth streets, and overlooking both the Hudson and Har-
lem rivers. There are afew traces of its embankments yet [1854] visible.

6. Nominally, nineteen thousand men, but actually effective, not more
than half that number. —

part of the English army, ﬁve thousand strong, proceeded to attack Fort Wash-
ington. They were successful, but at a cost to the victors of full one thousand
brave men.‘ More than two thousand Americans were made prisoners of war
[N ov. 16], and like their fellow captives on Long Island,2 were crowded into
loathsome prisons and prison ships.3 Two days afterward [N ov. 18], Cornwal-
lis, with six thousand men, crossed the Hudson at Dobb’s Ferry,4 and took pos-'
session of Fort Lee, which the Americans had abandoned on his approach, leav-
ing all the baggage and military stores behind them.

21. Now was opened both a melancholy and a brilliant chapter, in the history
of the war for Independence. For three weeks Washington, with his shattered
and daily diminishing army, was ﬂying before an Overwhelming force of Britons.
Newark, New Brunswick, Princeton and Trenton, successively fell into the
power of Cornwallis. So close were the British vanguards upon the rear of the
Americans, sometimes, that each could hear the music of the other. Day
after day, the militia left the army as their terms of enlistment expired, and
many of the regulars-5 deserted. Loyalists were swarming all over the country
through which they passed,5 and when, on the 7th of December, Washington
reached the frozen banks of the Delaware, at Trenton, he had less than three
thousand men, most of them wretchedly clad, half famished, and without tents
to shelter them from the biting Winter air. On the 8th, that remnant. of an
army crossed the Delaware in boats, and sat down, almost in despair, upon th
Pennsylvania shore. .

22. During his ﬂight Washington had sent repeated messages to general
Lee,7 urging him to leave North Castle,8 and reinforce him.~ That oﬂicer hoping
to strike a blow against the British that might give himself personal renown,
was so tardy in his obedience, that he did not enter New Jersey until the Amer-
icans had crossed the Delaware. , He was soon afterward made prisoner [Dec.
13, 1776], and his command devolved upon general Sullivan.9 At about the
same time intelligence reached the chief that the British had taken possession

‘ ‘ 1. The loss of the Americans, in killed

‘ ‘ 2. Nothing could exceed the horrors of '

these crowded prisons, as described by an
eye witness. The sugar houses of New
York,being large, were used for the pur-
pose, and therein scores suffered and died.
But the most terrible scenes occurred on
board several old hulks, which were an-
_chored in the waters around New York,
and used for prisoners. Of them the J er-
sey was the most famous for the sufferings
_ it contained, and the brutality of its oili-
cers. From these vessels, anchored near the present Navy Yard at Brooklyn, almost eleven thousand
victims were carried ashore during the war, and buried in shallow graves in the sand. Their remains
were gathered in 1808, and put in a vault situated near the termination of Front street, at Hudson Ave-
nue, Brooklyn. See Onderdonk’s Rev. Incidents of Long Island; Loss1ng’s Field Book, supplement.

6. General Howe had sent out proclamations through the country, oﬁering pardon and protection to
all who might ask for mercy. Perceiving the disasters to the American arms during the Summer and
Autumn, great numbers took advantage of these promises, and signed petitions. They soon found that
garotection did not follow pardon, for the -Hessian troops, in their march through New Jersey, committed
great excesses, without inquiring whether their victims were Whigs or Tories. Note 3, p. 171.

9. ‘Both Sullivan and Stirling, who were made prisoners on Long Island [verses 14-15, p. 189], had
been exchanged, and were now again with the army. Lee was captured at Baskingridge, where lord
Stirling resided, and remained a prisoner until May, 1778, when he was exchanged for general Prescott,
who was captured on Rhode Island. See verse 9, p. 198. .

of Rhode Island,‘ and blockaded the little American ﬂeet, under commodore
Hopkins,‘~°» then lying near Providence. This intelligence, and a knowledge of
the failure of operations on Lake Champlain,3 coupled with the sad condition of
the main army of patriots, made the future appear gloomy indeed.

23. Fortunately for the patriot ca-use, general Howe was excessively cautious

and indolent. Instead of allowing Cornwallis to construct boats,4 cross the

Delaware at once, overwhelm the patriots and push on to Philadelphia, as he ’

might have done, he ordered him to await the freezing of the waters so as to
cross on the ice. He was also directed to place four thousand German troops
in cantonments along the Jersey shore of the river, from Trenton to Burlington,
and to occupy Princeton and New Brunswick with strong British detachments.
Both Congress and Washington proﬁted by this delay. Measures for re-organ-
izing the army, already planned, were put in_operation, and a loan of a large
sum, in hard money,’ with which to pay the troops, was authorized. By the
offer of liberal bounties,5 and the inﬂuence of a stirring appeal put forth by
Congress, recruits immediately ﬂocked to Washington’s standard at Newtownﬁ
Almost simultaneously, Lee’s detachment under Sullivan, and another from Ti-
conderoga,7 joined him; and on the 24th of December he found himself in com-

mand of almost ﬁve thousand effective troops, many of them fresh and hopeful}? .

24. During all the gloom of the past month, hope had beamed brightlyupon
the heart of the commander-in-chief. Although Congress had adjourned to
Baltimore9 [Dec. 12, 1'77 6], and the public mind was ﬁlled with despondency,
his reliance upon Providence in a cause so just, was never shaken; and his
greatsoul conceived, and his ready hand planned a bold stroke for deliverance.
The Christmas holiday was at hand,——a day when Germans, especially, indulge
in convivial pleasures. Not doubting the Hessians would pass the day in sports
and drinking, he resolved to proﬁt by their condition, by falling suddenly upon
them while they were in deep slumber after a day and night of carousal. His
plan was to cross the Delaware in three divisions, one a few miles above Tren-
ton, another a ‘few miles below, and a third at Bristol to attack Count Donop10
at Burlington. ~

lery, at McConkey’s Ferry, eight or nine miles above Trenton, on the evening

3. General Gates was appointed to the command of the army at the north, after the death of general
Thomas [note 3, p. 182] ; and during the Summer and Autumn of 1776, Colonel Arnold became a sort of
commodore, and commanded ﬂotillas of small vessels in warfare with others prepared by general Carle-
ton, on Lake Champlain. He had two severe engagements (11th and 13th of October), in which he lost
about ninety men; the British about forty. These operations were disastrous, yet they resulted in pre-
venting the British forces in Canada uniting with those in New York.

4. The Americans took every boat they could ﬁnd at Trenton, and cautiously moved them out of the
river after they had crossed.

5. Each soldier was to have a bounty of twenty dollars, besides an allotment of land at the close of
the war. A common soldier was to have one hundred acres, and a colonel ﬁve hundred. These were
given to those only who enlisted to serve “ during the war.”

committee to represent that body was left in Philadelphia, to co-operate with the army. Congress assem-
bled at Baltimore on the 2Dtl1.

194 THE REVOLUTION.

of Christmas day} The river was ﬁlled with ﬂoating ice, and sleet and snow
were falling fast. The passage was made in ﬂat boats; and so difficult was the
navigation, that it was almost four o’clock in the morning [Dec. 12, 17 76], when
the troops were mustered on the Jersey shore. They were arranged in
two divisions, and approached Trenton by separate roads. They Were respect-
ively commanded by Greene and Sullivan. The enterprise was eminently suc-
cessful. Ball, the Hessian commander, was yet indulging in wine at the end of
a night spent in card playing, when the Americans approached, a little after
sunrise; and while endeavoring to rally his affrighted troops he fell, mortally
wounded, in the streets of Trenton. Between forty and ﬁfty of the Hessians
” were killed and fatally wounded, , and
more than a thousand, with arms, ammuni-
] tion and stores, were made prisoners, and
spoils of victory. Five hundred British
cavalry barely escaped, and ﬂed to Borden-
town. Generals Ewing and Cadwallader,
who commanded the other two divisions,
were unable to cross the river on account
of the ice, to co-operate with Washington.
With a strong enemy so near as Burling-
BATTLE AT TRENTON, ton and Princeton, Washington thought it
imprudent to remain on the Jersey shore,
so with his prisoners and booty he re-crossed the Delaware on the evening after
his victory. , , - ' ;_ 

26. It was indeed a victory in more aspects than that of a skilful military
operation. The Germans on the river, thor_oughly alarmed, ﬂed into the inte-
rior. The Tories and pliant Whigs? were abashed; the friends of liberty, rising
from the depthsof despondency, stood erect in the pride and strength of their
principles; the prestige of the Hessian name, lately so terrible, was broken, and
the faltering militia, anxious for bounties Ianclghonors, ﬂocked to the victorious
standard of Washington. Fourteen hundredsold-iers, whose terms of enlistment
would expire with the year, agreed to_remai;n six weeks longer. The victory
was also productive of more vigilant efforts on the part of the invaders. Be-
lieving the rebellion to be at an end, and the American army hopelessly annihi-
lated when Washington, with his shivering, half-starved troops, ﬂed a.cross the

 

Delaware, Cornwallis had returned to New York to embark for England. The

contempt of the British for the “rebels,” was changed to respect and fear, and
when intelligence of the affair at Trenton reached Howe, he ordered Cornwallis
back with reinforcements, to gain the advantage lost. Congress, in the mean-
while, perceiving the necessity of giving more power to the commander-in-
chief, wisely clothed himc[Dec. 27] with all the puissance of a military dicta-
tor,’ for six ‘months, and gave him absolute control of all the operations of war,
for that period.3 ,

27. Encouraged by his success at Trenton, and its results, Washington re-
solved to act on the .o;ffensive. He ordered general Heath, who was with quite

3. When Congress adjourned on the 12th, to meet at Baltimore, almost equal powers were given to
Washington, but they were not then deﬁned. N ow they were so, by resolution. At that time Congress
had given general Putnam almost unlimited command in Philadelphia. All munitions of war there,
were placed under his control. He was also authorized to employ all private armed vessels in the Dela-
Ware, in the defence of Philadelphia. . See note 4, p. 183. '

SECTION IV.
THIRD YEAR or THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE. [1777.]

 A strange apathy seemed to pervade the councils of the British government
during 1776, even while the public mind of England was ﬁlled with the sub-

ject of the American rebellion. Notwithstanding an army had been driven from i

one city? [March 1776], a ﬂeet eiipelled from another3 [June], their colonies de-
clared independent4 [July 4], and almost thirty thousand of their choice troops
and ﬁerce hirelings had been deﬁed and combatted5 [August], parliament did
not assemble until the last day of October, to deliberate on these important

‘ matters. Then the king, in his speech, congratulated them upon the success of

the royal troops in America, and hypocritioally assured them that most of the
continental powers entertained friendly feelings toward Great Britain. During a
dullsession of six weeks, new supplies for the American service were voted,
while every conciliatory proposition was rejected; and when parliament adjourned
[Dec.] to keep the Christmas holidays, the. members appeared to feel that their
votes had crushed the rebellion, and that on their re-assembling in January, they
would be invited to join in a Te Deumb‘ at St. Paul’s, because of submission and
peace in America. At that very moment, Washington was planning his brilliant
achievement on the banks of the Delaware.7

2. The members of the Continental Congress,
on the contrary, were always vigilant and active.
Their perpetual session was one of perpetual labor.
Early in the year [March 1776], they had appointed
Silas Deane‘3 to proceed to France, as their agent,
with general powers to solicit the co-operation of
other governments. Even those remote colonists

dentown and Crosswicks, on the night of the
ﬁrst of January. Yet with these, his effective force did not exceed ﬁve, thou-
sand men. Toward the evening of the 2d of January, 1777, Cornwallis,_ with a
strong force, approached from. Princeton, and after some skirmishing,'the two
armies encamped on either side of a small stream which runs through the town,
within pistol shot of each other. Washington commenced entrenching his camp,
and Cornwallis, expecting reinforcements in the morning, felt sure of his prey,
and deferred an attack for the night.

4. The Americans were in a most perilous situation. A conﬂict with such
an overwhelming force as was gathering, appeared hopeless, and the Delaware,
becoming more obstructed by ice every hour, rendered a retreat across it, in
the event of a surprise, almost impossible. An escape under cover of the night

Deane at Paris, in the middle of December, 1776._ Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston in 1706. He
was a printer, established himself in Pennsylvania, and for many years before the Revolution, was an
active public man, and noted philosopher. He was in Europe during most of the Revolution. On his
return, he was elected governor of Pennsylvania. V He died in 1790. Arthur Lee was born in Virginia,
in 1740, and was a brother of Richard Henry Lee [verse 9, p. 186]. He was a ﬁne writer, andwarm

3. In July, 1775, Dr. Franklin submitted aplan of union to Congress. On the 11th of J une, 1776 a com-
mittee was appointed to draw up a plan. Their report was laid aside, and not ’ called up until April,
1777. From that time until the 15th of November following, the subject was debated two or three times
a Week, when thirteen Articles of 0'onfederatz'on were adopted. The substance was that the thirteen
confederated States should be known as the United States of America, ,- that all engage in a reciprocal
treaty of alliance and friendship, for mutual advantage, each to assist the other when help should be
needed ; that each State should have the right to regulate its own internal affairs ; that no State should
separately send or receive embassies, begin any negotiations, contract engagements or alliances, or con-
clude treaties with any foreign power, without the consent of the general Congress ; that no public oﬂi-
cer should be allowed to accept any presents, emoluments, office or title from any foreign power ; and
that neither Congress nor State governments should possess the power to confer any title of nobility;
that none of the States should have the right to form alliances among themselves, without the consent
of Congress ; that they should not have the power to levy duties contrary to the enactments of - Con-
gress ; that no State should keep up a standing army or ships of war, in time of peace, beyond the
amount stipulated by Congress ; that when any of the States should raise troops for the common defence,
all the olﬁcers of the rank of colonel and under, should be appointed by the legislature of the State, and
the superior oliicers by Congress; that all the expenses of the war should be paid out of the public
Treasury‘; that Congress alone should have power to coin money, and that Canada might at any time
be admitted to the confederacy when she felt disposed. The last clauses were explanatory of the
power of certain governmental operations, and contained details of the same. Such was the form of
government which existed as the basis of our Republic, for almost twelve years.

was the only chance of safety, but the ground was too soft to allow the patriots
to drag their heavy cannons with them; and could they withdraw unobserved by
the British sentinels, whose hourly cry could be heard from the ca.mp ? Toward
midnight the wind changed, and the ground was soon hard frozen. Leaving a
few to keep watch and feed the camp-ﬁres to allay suspicion, Washington si-
lently withdrew, with all his army, artillery, andbaggage; and at dawn [J an. 3,
1777], he was in sight of Princeton, prepared to“‘fall upon Oornwallis’s reserve
there.‘ The British general had scarcely recovered from his surprise and morti-
ﬁcation, on seeing the deserted camp of the Americans, when the distant boom-
ing of cannons, borne upon the keen winter air, fell ominously upon his ears.
Washington and the British reserve were combatting.

5. Washington ‘did not reach Princeton as early as
he expected, and. instead of surprising the British,
and then pushing forward to capture or destroy the
enemy’s stores at New Brunswick, he found aportion
of the troops already on their march to join Corn-
wallis at Trenton. A severe encounter occurred, ,
when the American militia giving way, the British,
with a victorious shout, rushed forward, expecting
to produce a general rout. At that moment Wash-
ington advanced with a select corps, brought order
out of confusion, and leading on his troops with'wav-
ing sword and cheering voice, turned the tide of
battle and achieved a .victory. The brave general
Mercer,? while ﬁghting‘ at the head of his men, was
killed,‘and many other .beloved ofﬁcers were lost on
that snowy battle-ﬁeld.3 Nor was the conﬂict of
that morning yet ended. When Cornwallis-perceived
the desertion of the American camp, and heard -the .
ﬁring at PI‘iHC€tOn, he hastened, Vvith a: greater POT‘ BATTLE AT 1>R1NcEToN,
tion of his troops, to the aid of his reserve, and to
secure his stores at New Brunswick. The Americans, who had not slept nor
scarcelytasted. food for thirty-six hours, were compelled, just as the heat of the
ﬁrst battle was over, to contest with fresh troops, or ﬂy with the speed of strong
men.» Washington chose the latter alternative, and when Cornwallis entered
Princeton, not a “ rebel” was to be found. -

6. Too weak to attempt the capture of the British stores at New Brunswick,
Washington retreated rapidly toward the hill country of East J ersey.4 Allowing
timeonly to refresh his troops at Pluckemin, he pressed forward to Morristown,
and there established his winter quarters. But he did not sit down in._idleness.
After establishing small cantonments-5 at different points from Princeton to the
Hudson Highlands, he sent out detachments to harass the thoroughly. per-

1. A brigade under lieutenant colonel Mawhood, consisting of three regiments and three troops of

soldier felled him with a clubbed musket [note 5, p. 1771- Hugh Mercer was a native of Scotland. He
was a surgeon on the ﬁeld of Culloden, and was practising medicine in Fredericksburg, Virginia, when
the Revolution broke out. He was with Washington in the French and Indian War. He was made

plexed British. These expeditions were conducted with so much skill and
spirit, that on the ﬁrst of March [1777], not a British nor aHessian soldier could
be found in New Jersey, except at New Brunswick and Amboy} Those dread-
ed battalions which, sixty days before, were all-powerful in New Jersey, and had
frightened the Continental Congress from Philadelphia, were now hemmed in
upon the Raritan, and able to act only on the defensive. Considering the
attending circumstances, this was a great triumph for the Americans. It
revived the martial spirit of the people and the hopes of all good patriots; and
hundreds in New Jersey, who had been deceived by Howe’s proclamation, and
had suffered Hessian brutality, openly espoused the Whig cause. Congress had
returned to Philadelphia? and commenced its labors there with renewed vigor.

.7. The main body of the two armies did not commence the Summer campaign
until almost the ﬁrst of June. In the meanwhile, smaller detachments were in
motion at various points. A strong armament was sent up the Hudson, in
March, to destroy American stores at Peekskill. The Americans there, under
the command of general McDougal,3 perceiving a defense of the property to be
futile, set ﬁre to the stores and retreated to the hills in the rear. The British
returned to New York the same evening [March 23, 1777]. Almost a month
afterward [April 13], Cornwallis went up the R‘c1‘ll7ail1 from New Brunswick, to
surprise the Americans under general Lincoln, at Boundbrook. The latter es-
caped, with difficulty, after losing about sixty men and a part of his baggage.

8. Toward the close of April [April 25], governor Tryon,4i at the head of two
thousand British and Tories, went up Long Island Sound, landed at Compo [April
26], between Norwalk and Fairﬁeld, marched to Danbury, destroyed a large
quantity of stores belonging to the Americans, burned the town, and cruelly
treated the inhabitants. Perceiving the militia to be gathering in great num-
bers, he retreated rapidly the next morning, by way of . Ridgeﬁeld. Near that
village, he had some severe skirmishing with the militia under generals Wooster,
Arnold5 and Silliman. Wooster was killed,“ Arnold narrowly escaped, but Silli-
man, keeping the ﬁeld, harassed the British all the way to the coast. At Com-
po, and while embarking, they were terribly galled by artillery under Lamb.7
Tryon lost almost three hundred men during this expedition, and killed or
wounded about half that number of Americans. His atrocities were never for-
gotten nor forgiven. , .

9. The British were not always the aggressors. Toward the close of May
[May 22], colonel Meigs, with one hundred and seventy men, crossed Long
Island Sound in whale-boats, from Cruilford, Connecticut, and at two o’clock in
the morning of the 23d of May, attacked a British provision post at Sagg_Har-

1. The Americans went out in small companies, made sudden attacksupon pickets,out-posts, and forag-
ing parties, and in this way frightened the detachments of the enemy and drove them in to the main
body on the Raritan. At Springﬁeld, a few miles from Elizabetlitown, they attacked a party of Hes-
sians, who were penetrating the country from Elizabethport [Jan 7, 1777], killed between forty_ and ﬁfty
of them, and drove the remainder in great confusion back to Staten Island. A larger_ i_‘o_raging party
was defeated near Somerset court house [J an. 20] by about ﬁve hundred New Jersey militia under gen-
eral Dickinson; and Newark, Elizabethtown and Woodbridge, were taken possession of by the patriots.

6. David Wooster was born in Stratford, Conn., in 1710. Hewas at Louisburg in 1745, became a cap-

bor, on the eastern eXtremity’of Long Island. They burned a dozen vessels,
the store houses and contents, and secured ninety prisoners, without losing a
man of their own party. For this exploit Congress voted thanks and a sword
to colonel Meigs. A little later in the season, an equally bold exploit Was per-
formed on Rhode Island. On a dark night in July [July 10], colonel William
Barton, with a company of picked men, crossed Narraganset Bay in whale-
boats, in the midst of the British ﬂeet, stole cautiously to the. quarters of gene-
ral Prescott,1 the British commander on Rhode Island, seized him while in bed,
and carried him in triumph across the bay to Warwick. There a carriage was
in waiting for him, and at sunrise he was under a strong guard at Providence.“
Congress voted Barton an elegant sword.

10. Washington continued his head quarters at Morristown until near the
last of May. During the spring he had inoculated a large portion of his troops
for the small poX;3 and when the leaves put forth, a fair degree of health pro-
vailed in his camp, and his army had increased by recruits, to almost ten thou-
sand men. The movements of the British perplexed him. Burgoyne was as-
sembling an army at St. J ohn,4 and vicinity, preparatory to an invasion of New
York by way of Lake Champlain, to achieve the darling object of the British
ministry, the occupation of the country on the Hudson.5 But whether Howe
was preparing to co-operate with Burgoyne, or to make another attempt to seize
Philadelphia}? VVashington could not determine. He prepared for both events
by stationing Arnold with a strong detachment on the west side of the Dela-
ware, concentrating a large force on the Hudson, and moving the main body of
his army to Middlebrook, within ten miles of the British camp at New Bruns-
Wick.

11. On the 12th of June [17 7'7], Howe passed over from New York, where
he had made his head quarters during the Winter, concentrated the mainbody
of his army at New Brunswick, and_tried to draw Washington into an engage-

ment by a feigned movement [June 14, 1'7 77] toward the Delaware. The chief T

remained in his strong position at Middlebrook until Howe suddenly retreated,
[June 19], sent some of his troops over to Staten Island [June 22], and ap-
peared to be evacuating New Jersey. Washington was deceived. He ordered
strong detachments in pursuit, and advanced several miles in the same direction,
with his whole army. Howe suddenly changed front [June 25], and attempted to

- gain the rear of the Americans; but, after Stirling’s brigade had maintained a

severe skirmish with a corps under Cornwallis [June 26], the Americans regain-
ed their camp without much loss. Five days afterward [June '30], the whole
British army crossed over to Staten Island, and left New Jersey in the complete
possession of the patriots.

of Crown Point?‘ and Ticonderoga,9 and spread terror over the whole North. - At

‘ THE NATCHEZ.

1. The NATGHEZ occupied a small territory on the eastern side of the Missis-

Mississippi along the valley of the Pearl river, to the upper waters of the Chick-
asahaw. For a long time they Were supposed to belong to the nation of Mobellzbm
tribes, by whom they were surrounded, but their language proved them to be a
distinct people.‘ They became jealous of the French 011 their ﬁrst appearance
upoﬁ the Mississippi, and ﬁnally they conspired with others to drive the intruders
from the country. The French fell upon, and almost annihilated the nation, in

1730. They never recovered fromthe shock, and after maintaining a feeble -

nationality for almost a century, they have become merged into the Creek Con-
federacy. They now [1854] number less than three hundred souls, and their
language, in its purity, is unknown. .

mouth of the Ohio; and along the Atlantic to Cape Fear. It comprised a greater
portion of the present State of . Georgia, the whole of Florida, Alabama, and Mis-

divided into three grand confederacies of tribes, namely, Muscogees or Greeks,
Ohoctaws, and 0'/zvlclcctsaws.

the same time the British ﬂeet at New York took such a position as induced
t11e belief that it was about to pass up the Hudson and co-operate witli the vic-
torious invader. Finally,‘ Howe left general Clinton in command at New York,
and embarking on board the ﬂeet with eighteen thousand troops [July 23], he
sailed for the Delaware. When Washington comprehended this movement, he
left a strong force on the Hudson, and with the main body of his troops pushed
forward to Philadelphia. There he was saluted by a powerful ally, in the per-
son of a stripling, less than twenty years of age. He was a wealthy French
nobleman, who, several months before, While at a dinner with the duke of
Gloucester,1 ﬁrst heard of the struggle of the Amer-
icans, their Declaration of Independence, and the
preparations made to crush them. His young soul
was-ﬁred with aspirations to give them his aid; and
quitting the army he hurried to Paris. Although he
had just married a young and beautiful girl, and a
bright career was opened for him in his own country,
he left all, and hastened to America in a vessel ﬁtted
out at his own expense. He offered his services to
the Continental Congress,9- and that body gave him
the commission [July 31] of a major-general. Three
days afterward [Aug. 3], he was introduced to
. Washington at: a- public dinner, and within less than
GENERALL. MY,-ME. forty days he was gallantly ﬁghting [Sept. 11] for
freedom in America, on the banks of the Brandy-
vine. That young general was the Marquis de LA FAYE'rTE,3 whose name is
forever linked with that of Washington and Liberty.

13. Howe did not go up the Delaware, but ascended Chesapeake bay, and
at its head, near the village of Elkton, in Maryland, he disembarked [Aug 25],
and marched toward Philadelphia. Washington had advanced beyond the
Brandywine creek, and took post a few miles from Wilmington. Howe’s supe-
rior force compelled himto fall back to the east side of the Brandywine; and
at Chad’s Ford, several miles above Wilmington, he made a stand for the de-
fense of Philadelphia. At that point the Hessians under Knyphausen,4 at-
tacked the left wing of the Americans [Sept. 11, 1777], commanded by Wash-
ington in person; while Howe and Cornwallis, crossing the stream several
miles above, fell upon the American right, under general Sullivan, near the
Birmingham meeting house.5 ‘ The contest raged fearfully during the whole
day. At night the shattered and defeated battalions of patriots, retreated to
Chester, and the following day [Sept. 12] to Philadelphia. Many brave men
were killed or disabled on that sanguinary ﬁeld. La Fayette was severely

made a land journey to Philadelphia. His application was not received at ﬁrst,‘ by the Continental Con-
gress, but when his true character and designs were known, they gave him a major-general’s commis-
sion. He was afterward an active patriot in his own country in many perilous scenes. He visited
America in 182445 [verse 11, p. 282], and died in 1834 at the age of ninety-seven years. The baron de

-Philadelphia, the ﬂeet had sailed around to the Delaware, and had approached
to the head of that bay. These forts commanded the -river; and a chevcmoc-de
fm'3e2 just below them, completely obstructed it, so that the army in Philadel-
phia could obtain no supplies from the ﬂeet. The possession of theseforts was
important, and on the 22d of October, they were attacked by detachments sent
by Howe. Fort Mercer was assailed by two thousand Hessian grenadiers under
Count Donop.3 They were repulsed by the garrison of less than ﬁve hundred
men under lieutenant colonel Greene, after losing their commander4 and almost
four hundred soldiers. The garrison of Fort Mifﬂin, under lieutenant colonel
Smith, also made a gallant defense, but after a series of assaults by land and
water, it was abandoned [Nov. 16, 1777 Two days afterward, Fort Mercer
was also abandoned, and several British ships sailed up to Philadelphia..5
17. When Washington was informed of the
weakened condition of the British army, by the
detachment of these forces to attack the Delaware
forts, he resolved to assail the camp at German-
town. He had moved down the Schuylkill to
Skippack_ Creek [Sept. 25], and from that point
3 he marched, silently, on the evening of the 3d of
I October, toward the camp of the enemy. He
reached Chestnut Hill, beyond Germantown, at
_ dawn the following morning, and the attack soon
commenced near there. After a severe battle
during several hours, the patriots were repulsed,

general St. Cla.ir, with only about three thousand ‘

men. Upon Mount Independence, on the op-
posite side of the lake, was a small fortiﬁcation and a
weak garrison} These composed the entire force,
except some feeble detachments of militia, to op-
pose the invaders. On the approach of Burgoyne,
St. Clair? left his outworks, gathered his force near
the fortress, and prepared for an assault ; but
when, on the evening of the 5th, he saw the scar-
let uniforms -of the British on the top of Mount
Deﬁance,3 and a battery of heavy cannons planted
there,4 more than ﬁve hundred feet above the
fort, he knew resistance would be vain. That
evening he sent his ammunition and stores up the Gm.«,,RM, ST, GLAIR,

-lake to Skenesborough,5 and under cover of the ,

darkness, silently crossed over to Mount Independence, and commenced a re-

 

.treat toward Fort Edward,5 the head-quarters ‘of general S-c-huyler, Who \\‘{;S

then in commandof the northern army. ,

19. The light of a burning building, ﬁred on Mount Independence, dis-
covered their ﬂight to the enemy, and a strong party was immediately sent in
pursuit.7 At dawn, the British ﬂag was waving over Ticonderoga; and a little

‘after sunrise.[July 7, 17 77], the rear division of the ﬂying Americans, under col-

onel Seth Warner,8 were overtaken in Hubbardton, Vermont, anda severe engage-
ment followed. The patriots were defeated and dispersed, and the victors re-
turned to Tieonderoga.9 Before sunset the same evening, a ﬂotilla of British
vessels had overtaken and destroyed the Americans’ stores which St. Clair had sent
up the lake, and also another large quantity at Skenesborough. The fragments
of St. Clair’s army reached Fort Edward on the 12th, thoroughly dispirited.
Within a week, the Americans had lost almost two hundred pieces of artillery,
and a large amount of provisionsand military stores.

20. Even with this reinforcement, Schuyler had only about four thousand ef-
fective men—a number totally inadequate to combat with those of Burgoyne.
He therefore‘ sent a strong party toward Skenesborough to fell huge trees across
the roads, and to destroy all the bridges so as to obstruct the march of the in-
Vaders, while he slowly retreated down the Hudson valley to the mouth of the Mo-

1. During the previous years, the Americans constructed a picketed fort, or stockacle [note 5, p.
139] on that eminence, built about three hundred huts or barracks, dug several wells, and placed bat-
teries [note 5, p. 102] at ditferent points. The remains of these are now [1854] everywhere visible on
Mount Independence. This was so called because the troops took possession of it on the 4th of July,
1776. Verse 10, p. 187.

2. Arthur St. Clair was a native of Scotland, and came to America with admiral Boscawen, early
in May 1755. He served under Wolfe ; and when the Revolution broke out, he entered the American
army. He served during the war, and afterward, and died in 1818, at the age of eighty-four years.

ments were sent from the regular army to strengthen him; and soon general
Lincoln came with a large body of New England militia. When general Gates
arrived, to take the chiefcommand,2 he found an army of thirteen thousand men,
ready to meet the invader. '

21. Burgoyne did not reach Fort Edward3 until the 30th of July.4 His army
was worn down by fatigue, and his provisions were almost exhausted. To re-
plenish his stores, he sent ﬁve hundred Germans, Canadians and Tories, and
one hundred Indians, under’Colonel Baume, to seize provisions and cattle which
the Americans had collected at Bennington, thirty-ﬁve miles distant. Colonel
John Stark had called out the New Hampshire militia; and near Hoosick,

‘ within ﬁve miles of Bennington, they met [Aug.
7. 16] and defeated the marauders. And toward
 : evening when another Grerman party under col-

’  onel Breyman, approached, they also were de-
feated by a continental force under colonel Seth
‘Warner.5 Many of the enemy were killed, and
a large number were made prisoners. Burgoyne’s

at Stillwater and Saratoga. The camp at the mouth of the
Mohawk was upon islands just below the Great, or Cohoes’ Falls.

and Tories, under J ohnsonl and Butler, had arrived from Oswego, and invested

Fort Schuyler [Aug. 3, 1777]. The garrison was commanded by colonel Gran-

sevoort, and made a spirited defense. General Herkimer rallied the militia of

his neighborhood; and while marching to the assistance of Gansevoort, he

fell into an Indian ambuscade [Aug. 6] at Oriskanyﬁ His party was totally de-

feated, after a bloody conﬂict, and himself mortally wounded. On the same day,

a corps of the garrison, under colonel Wiﬂet, made a successful sortie,3 and

broke the power of the besiegers. Arnold, who had been sent by Schuyler

to ‘the relief of the fort, soon afterward approached, when the besiegers

ﬂed [Aug. 22], and quiet was restored to the Mohawk valley.

' 23. Burgoyne was greatly perplexed. To retreat,

advance, or remain inactive, seemed equally perilous.

1. Sir William Johnson [verse 19, p. 144] (now dead) had been a
sort of autocrat among the Indians and Tories in the Mohawk val-
ley. He ﬂattered the chiefs in various ways, and through them, he
obtained almost unbounded inﬂuence over the tribes, especially that
of the Mohaiwks. He was in the habit of giving those chiefs, who
pleased him, a diploma, certifying their good character, and faithful-
ness to his majesty. These contained apicture, representing a treaty
council, of which the annexed engraving is a copy. His family were
the worst enemies of the Americans during the war, in that region.
His son, J ohn, raised a regiment of Tories, called the Johnson Greens
(those who joined St. Leger) ; and John Butler, a cruel leader, was at
the head of another band, called Butler’s Rangers. These co-operated
with Brant, the great Mohawk sachem, and for years they made the '

Mohawk valley and vicinity, a scene of terror. These men were the A TREATY.
allies of St. Leger on the occasion in question. .

2. The place of the battleis about half way between Utica and Rome. The latter village is upon the
site of Fort Stanwix, built by Bradstreet and his troops in 1758 [verse 33, p. 150]. It was repaired and
garrisoned in 1776, and its name was changed to Fort Schuyler. Another Fort Schuyler was built during
the French and Indian war, where Utica now stands.

were ﬂocking to Gates’s camp, and Indian warriors of the SIX N ATIONS,l were
gathering there. His own forces, on the contrary, werehourly diminishing. As
his star, which arose so brightly at Ticonderogaﬂ began to decline upon the
Hudson, the Canadians and his Indian allies deserted him in great num-
bers.3 He was compelled. to ﬁght or ﬂee. Again he advanced; and aftera
severe battle [Oct. 7] of several hours, almost on the same ground occupied on
the 19th of September, he was compelled to fall back to the heights of Sara-

toga, and leave the patriots in the possession .of the ﬁeld. Ten days afterward

[Oct. 17], ﬁnding only three days’ provisions in his camp, hearing nothing of
Clinton, and perceiving retreat impossible, he was compelled to surrender his
whole army prisoners of war.4 -1 Of necessity, the forts upon Lake Champlain
now fell into the hands of the patriots.

24. This was a glorious victory for the Americans. It gave them a ﬁne train
of brass artillery, ﬁve thousand muskets, and a vast amount of munitions of
war. Its moral effect was of greater importance. All eyes had been anxiously
turned to the army of the North, and Congress and the people listened eagerly
for every breath of rumor from Saratoga. How electric was the effect when a
shout of victory came from the camp of Gates!-'5 It rolled over the land, and
was echoed from furrows, workshops, marts of commerce, thehalls of legisla-
tion, and from the shattered army of Washington at Whitemarshﬁ Toryism

troop was landed in my country, I never would lay down my arms——never,

3. The Indians had been disappointed in their expectations of blood and plunder ; and now was their
hunting season, when provisions must be secured for winter use. The Canadians saw nothing but de-
feat in the future, and leftthe army in whole companies.

4. The whole number surrendered was 5,791, of whom 2,412 were Germans or Hessicms [verse 2, p.
183], under the chief command of the Baron Reidesel, whose wife accompanied him, and afterward
wrote a very interesting account of her experience in America. Burgoyne did dine at Albany [verse 23,
p. 205], but as a prisoner, though a guest at the table of general Schuyler. His troops were marched to
Cambridge, with the view of sending them to Europe, but Congress thought it proper to retain them,
and they were marched to the interior of Virginia. John Burgoyne was a son of Lord Bingley. On his

5. General Gates was so elated with the victory,-which had been prepared for by general Schuy-
ler, and won by the valor of Arnold and Morgan [verse 23, p. 181], that he neglected the courtesy
due to the commander-in-chief, and instead of sending his despatches to him, he sent his aid, colonel
Wilkinson, with a verbal message to Congress. That body also forgot its dignity in the hour of its
joy, and the young officer was allowed to announce the victory himself, on the ﬂoor of Congress. In
his subsequent despatches, Gates did not mention the names of Arnold and Morgan. Congress voted 21

26. This victory weighed mightily in favorof the Americans, at the court of
France. ‘ Unaided by any foreign power, they had defeated and captured a well-
trained army of about six thousand men. “Surely such a people possess the
elements of success, and will achieve it. We may now safely strike England a
severe blow,9 by acknowledging the independence, and forming an alliance with
her revolted colonies,” argued the French government. ' And so it did. Within a

» little more than a hundred days after Burgoyne la.id down his arms a.t Saratoga,

France had formed an alliance with the _United States [Feb. 6, 1778], and pub-
licly avowed it.

27. General Clinton attempted co-operation with Burgoyne, but too late for
success. He ascended the Hudson with a strong force, captured the Highland
forts3 [Oct. 6, 1776], and sent a marauding expedition above these mountain
barriers, to devastate the country [Cct. 13], and endeavor to draw off some of the
patriot troops from Saratoga4. They burned Kingston, and penetrated as far
as Livingston’s manor, in Columbia county. Informed of the surrender of
Burgoyne, they hastily retreated, and Clinton and his army returned to New
York. Some of Grates’ troops now joined Washington at Whitemarsh.5 Howe
made several attempts to entice the chief from his encampment, but without
success.‘3 Finally Washington moved from that position [Dec. 11], and went
into winter quarters at Valley Forge, wherevhe might easier afford protection to
Congress at York, and his stores at Reading.7 The events of that encampment
at Valley Forge, afford some of the gloomiest, as well as some of the most
brilliant scenes in the records of American patriotism.

2. France rejoiced at the embarrassments of England, on account of her revolted colonies, and from
the beginning secretly favored the latter. She thought it inexpedient to aid the colonies openly, until
there appeared some chance for their success, yet arms and money were secretly provided, for a long
time previous to the alliance. Her motives were not the benevolent ones to aid the patriots, so much as
a selﬁsh desire to injure England for her own beneﬁt. A Bourbon (the family of French kings) was
never known to be an honest advocate of free principles.

legal body. Two bills expressing these conciliatory measures, were passed
after much opposition,7 and received the signature of the king [March 11].
Commissioners3 were appointed to proceed to America to negotiate for peace
with Congress, and the British government seemed really anxious to offer the
olive branch, without qualiﬁcation. But the Americans had been too often de-

Franklin to say “Howe did not take Philadelphia—Philadelphia took Howe.” General Howe took
leave of the army in May, and the oiﬁcers gave him a splendid farewell fete, which was called a Mis-
chianzaipignifying a medley. For a full description, see Lossing’s Field Book of the Revolution,

2. During this season, a scheme was formed among a few officers of the army, and members of Con-
gress, for depriving Washington of his command, and giving it to Gates or Lee. One of the chief ac-
tors in the plot was general Conway, an Irishman who belonged to the continental army. The plot
was discovered and defeated, and Conway was led to make a most humble apology to Washington, for

, his conduct.

was in favor of reconciliation, not of separation. It was during his speech on this subject, that he was
seized with the illness [April 7] which terminated his life a month afterward. Pitt was born in Novem-

ceived to accept anything conﬁdingly from that source, and as soon as these
bills reached Congress [April 15], and it was found that they made no mention
of the independence of the colonies, that body at once rejected them as decep-
tive. When the commissioners came [June 4], Congressrefused to negotiate
with them until Great Britain should withdraw her ﬂeets and armies, or unequiv-
ocally acknowledge the independence of the United States. After unsuccess-
fully appealing to the American people, and one of them endeavoring to bribe
members of Congress,1 the commissioners returned to England, and the war
went on.

3. The ﬁrst movement of the French government, in compliance with the re-
quirements of its treaty with the United States, was to despatch a squadron
under count D’Estaing, to blockade the British ﬂeet in the Delaware? When, a
month before he sailed, the British ministry was officially informed [March 17,
1778] of the treaty, and it was considered equivalent to a declaration of war,
a vessel was despatched with a message to the British commanders, ordering
them to evacuate Philadelphia and the Delaware, and to concentrate their forces
at New York. Fortunately for Lord Howe, he had left the Delaware afew days
before the arrival of D’Estaing3 [July 8, 1778], and found safety from the heavy
French vessels, in the waters of Amboy or Raritan Bay.

4. Sir Henry Clinton succeeded Sir William H0we4 in command, toward the
close of May,_and on the 18th of June, he withdrew his whole army from Phila-
delphia. ‘ With eleven thousand. men, and an im- .
mense baggage and provision train, he started for
New York, by the way of New Brunswick and
Amboy. Washington was on the alert, and
breaking up his encampment at Valley Forge,5 he
pursued Clinton with more than equal forceﬁ By
adroit movements, detachments of the American
army so intercepted Clinton’s march, as to compel
him to change his course in the direction of Sandy
Hook, while New Jersey militia continually
harassed his ﬂanks and rear.7 Finally a general
engagement took place [June 28, 1778] on the ~ , , _, ‘\:,-- -
plains of Monmouth, in the present village of ‘GENER,._L CLINTON,

pursuit of Clinton, with a little more than 12,000 men. ~

7. Washington was anxious to attack Clinton, when he was in the vicinity of Allentown, but Lee and
others overruled his opinions in a council of war. Greene, La Fayette, and Wayne agreed with the
chief, and supported by these able oﬁcers, he resolved on a general engagement.

THE MOBILIAN TRIBES.   21

2. The Creek Confederacy extended from
the Atlantic westward to the high lands
which separate the waters of the Alabama
and Tombigbee rivers, including a great
portion of the States of Alabama and Geor-
gia, and the whole of Florida. Oglethorpe’s
ﬁrst interviews‘ with the natives at Savan-
nah, were witl1 peop_le of this confederaey.

3. The Seiminoles of Florida and the Ya-
massees or Scwawmahs of Georgia and South  _
Carolina, were of the Oreelc eonfederaey. ,SOUTHERN mm..ms_

The latter Were strong and warlike. They '

were at the head of the Indian Confederacy in 1715.9 When the general disper-
sion followed, the Yamassees took refuge with the Spaniards of Florida, Small
bands-often annoyed the white frontier settlements of Georgia, but they were
not engaged in general hostilities until the Revolution, when the whole Creek
eonfederaey3 took part with the British.

4.. The Senzmoles were always hostile to their white neighbors, and bands
of them went out upon the war-path, with the Yama-ssees. They joined the
British in 1812—’14; and in 1817 they renewed hostilities.4 They were subdued
by General Jackson, and afterward remained comparatively quiet until 1835,
when they again attacked the white settlements.-5 They were subjugated in
1842, after many lives and much treasure had been sacriﬁcedﬁ A few of them
yet [1854] remain in the everglades of Florida, but a greater portion of the
tribe have gone west of the aMiSSiSSippi,. with the other members of the Creek
Confederacy. The Greeks proper now [1854] number about twenty-four thou-

 

sand souls; the number of the whole confederaey is about thirty thousand. They '

occupy lands upon the Arkansas and its tributaries.

' 5. The Ohoezfaws inhabited the beautiful country bordering upon the Gulf of
Mexico, and extending west of the Greeks to the Mississippi. They were an
agricultural people when the Europeans discovered them; and, attached to home
and their quiet pursuits, they have ever been a peaceful people. Their wars
have always been on the defensive, and they never had public feuds with either
their Spanish, French, or English neighbors. They, too, have been compelled
to abandon their native country for the uncultiv ated wilderness west of Arkansas,
between the Arkansas and Red rivers. They now [1854] number about two
thousand souls. -

6. The C’hz'cka.saws inhabited the country along the "Mississippi, from the bor-
ders of the Choctaw domain, to the Ohio River, and eastward beyond the Tennes-
see to the lands of the 0he7"07cees7 and ;S’haumees.8 This warlike tribe were the

early friends of ' the English, and the most inveterate fees of the French, who

had twice [1736-1740] invaded their country. They adhered to the British
during the Revolution, but since that time they have held friendly relations with
the Government of the United States. The remnant, about six thousand in
number, are upon lands almost a hundred leagues westward of the Mississippi.

BATTLE OF MONMOUTH, day, and when night came,

_ both parties were glad to

rest. The Americans slept on their arms3 during the night, with . the intention
of renewing the battleat dawn, but when light appeared, the British camp was
deserted. Clinton had silently withdrawn [June 29], and was far on his Way
toward Sandy Hook. Washington did not follow, but marching to New Bruns-
wick, and thence to. the Hudson river, he proceeded to White Plains,4 where he
remained until late in Autumn. Then he crossed into New Jersey, and made
his winter quarters at.Midd1ebrook,5 on the Raritan. Clinton’s shattered forces
went on board the British ﬂeet at Sandy Hook, and proceeded to New York,
where the head quarters of the royal army continued until the close of the war.5
6. When D’Estaing appeared off Sandy Hook, the British ﬂeet was safe in
Raritan Bay, for the bar from the Hook to Staten Island, would not allow the
heavy French vessels to pass.’ D’Esta-ing therefore relinquished his design of
attacking Howe’s ﬂeet, and on the solicitation of Washington, he proceeded to
Newport, to assist the Americans in an attempt to drive the British from Rhode
Island.7 General Sullivan had been sent to supersede general Spencer in com-
mand there, and Washington also despatched La Fayette, with two continental
regiments (accompanied by general Greene, then quartermaster general), to aid
in the expedition. John Hancock3 came at the head of Massachusetts militia,
and similar troops gathered at Tiverton, from Connecticut and Rhode Island.-9

1. [Verse 5, p. 185]. This command was ﬁrst given to La Fayette, but when Lee signiﬁed his readi-
ness to lead it, it was given to him, as he was the senior officer.

2. Washington was greatly irritated when he met the fugitives, and riding up to Lee, he addressed
him with much warmth of language, and directed him to assist in restoring order. Lee promptly
obeyed, but the sting of Washington’s words rankled in his bosom, and on the day after the battle he
addressed an offensive letter to the chief. Lee was arrested and tried by a court-martial, on the charges
of disobedience of orders, misbehavior before the enemy, and disrespect to the commander-in-chief. He
was found guilty, and was suspended from command for one year.‘ He never entered the army again,
and died in obscurity in Philadelphia, in October, 1782. He was brave, but bad in manners and morals,
profane in language, and a contemner of religion. It is believed that he was willing to have Washing-
ton lose the battle of Monmouth, because he (Lee) was opposed to it, and at the sametime was seeking to
rise to the chief command upon the ruins of Washington’s reputation. The place where Wasliingtoii
and Lee met on the battle-ﬁeld of Monmouth, is indicated by the black spot on the above map, marked
0. The battle occurred a short distance from the Freehold Presbyterian Church, yet [1854] standing.

3. This expression is used respecting troops who sleep with all "their aceoutrements on, and their
weapons by their side ready for action in a moment. The British left about three hundred killed on the
ﬁeld of battle. They also left a large number of the sick and wounded to the mercy of the Americans.

.The Americans lost in killed, wounded and missing, two hundred and twenty-eight. Many of the miss-

ing afterward rejoined the army. They had less than seventy kille .

FOURTH YEAR on THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE. 211,

On the 9th of August [1778], the whole American force crossed from Tiverton
to the north end of Rhode Island, and the British guards ﬂed to the camp of
general Pigot, at Newport. ._
7. The British ﬂeet was reinforced by several ships of war from England, and
a few days after D’Estaing sailed for N ewpert,1 a large squadron under Howe,
proceeded to the relief of Pigot. It appeared off Rhode Island on the same
day [Aug. 9] when the Americans landed on the northern end of it. D’Estaing,
who was within the harbor, went out to meet Howe,
but before they came to an engagement, a terrible
storm arose [Aug. 12], and scattered and disabled
both ﬂeets? The ‘French squadron returned to
Newport [Aug.' 20], and immediately sailed for Bos-
ton to be repaired. The Americans had then ad-
vanced almost to Newport, with every prospect of
making a successful siege. They had been promised
four thousand land troops from the French ﬂeet.
These were denied them; and refusing to listen to
entreaties or remonstrances, D’Estaing sailed for
Boston, and abandoned the Americans.3 The latter
hastily withdrew to the north end of the island, —  I '
[Aug. 28], pursued by the British, and a severe en- COUNT D’ESTA“*’G-
gagement tookplace [Aug. 29] at Quaker Hill.
Sullivan repulsed the British, and on the night of the 30th, withdrew his whole
army to the main, near Bristol, in time to avoid an interception by Sir Henry
Clinton, who had just arrived with four thousand troops, in light vessels.4 The
Americans lost in this expedition, thirty killed, and one hundred and seventy-
two wounded and missinrr. The British loss was about two hundred and

 

twenty.

8. During the Summer of 177 8, the Wyoming, Mohawk, Schoharie an 11
Cherry vallies, were made the theatres of terrible scenes of blood and devastation.
Tories from distant N iagara,-5 and savages upon the head waters of the Susque-
hanna, gathered at' Tioga early in June; and at the beginning of July, eleven
hundred of these white and dusky savages, under the general, command of col-
onel John Butler,“ entered [July 2, 1778] the lovely valley of Wyoming. Most
of the strong men were away on distant duty, and families and homes found de-

had been some amelioration of their condition since the capture of Prescott [verse 9, p. 198], and under
the rule of Pigot-, the present commander. When success seemed possible, thousands of volunteers
ﬂocked to the standards of Sullivan and La Fayette. J ohn Hancock was appointed a general of some
of these volunteers.
— 1. Verse 6, p. 210.

2. Very old people on Rhode Island, who remember this gale, yet [1854] speak of it as “the great
storm.” So violent was the wind, that it brought spray from the ocean at mile distant, and encrusted
the windows of the town with salt.

his conduct was warmly censured by the American commanders, because it had no valid excuse.
It deprived them of a. victory just Within their grasp. Congress, however, afraid to otfend the French,
uttered not a word of blame. The matter was passed over, but not forgotten. Once again [verse
15, p. 219], the same admiral abandoned the Americans. D’Estaing was a native of Auvergnc,
France. He became involved in the French Revolution in 1792, and in the Spring of 1793, was guillo-
tined. The guillotine was an instrument for cutting off the head, invented by M. Guillotine. ‘

4. When Clinton was assured of the security of Rhode Island, he detached general Grey on a ma-
rauding expedition upon the southern shores of Massachusetts, and among the adjacent islands, and
then returned to New York. Grey burned about 70 vessels in Buzzard’s Bay, near New Bedford, and

in that vicinity destroyed property valued at more than $323,000. He then went to Martha’s vineyard '

[verse 27, p. 40], and carried away for the army in New York, about 300 oxen and 10,000 sheep. On
the first of October, Clinton sent a successful expedition to capture American stores at Little Egg Har-
bor, ou the New Jersey coast. , '

fenders only in aged men, tender youths, resolute women and a few trained sol-
diers. These, about four hundred strong, under colonel Zebulon Butler, 1
marched up the valley [July 4], to drive back the invaders. But they were
terribly smitten by the foe, and a large portion of them were slain or made pris-
oners. A few escaped to Forty Fort, near Wilkesbarre, wherein families, for
miles around, had sought safety. _

9. The night of the battle-day, was a terrible one for the people in the fort;
but their agony of suspense was ended the following morning, when the leader
of the invaders agreed upon humane terms of surrender? The gates of the fort
were thrown open, and most of the families returned to their homes in fancied
security. They were doomed to terrible disappointment and woe. Brant, the
great Indian leader, was not there to restrain his savage bands, and their thirst
for blood and plunder soon overcame all their allegiance to their white com-
mander. Before sunset theyhad scattered over the valley; and when night
fell upon the scene, the blaze of more than twenty dwellings cast its lurid glare
over the paradise of yesterday. The cries of the murdered went up from almost

every house and ﬁeld; and when the moon arose, the terriﬁed inhabitants were

ﬂeeing to the Wilkesbarre mountains, and the dark morasses of the Pocono
mountain beyond. In that vast wilderness between the valley and the Dela-
ware, appropriately called the Shades of Death, many women and children, who
escaped the hatchet, perished by hunger and fatigue.3 _

10. Brant,4 in the meanwhile, was leading or sending war parties through the
country south of the Mohawk river; and the J ohnsons,5 and their Tory adher-
exits, were allies of the savages in the Mohawk valley. Aparty of Tories, under
Walter N. Butler,5 accompanied by Indians, under Brant, fell like lightning upon
the settlement of Cherry Valley [1\Tov. 11-12, 1778]. Many of the people were
killed or "carried into captivity ;7 and for months, no eye was closed in security
at night, within an area of a hundred miles and more, around this desolated vil-
lage. Tryon county, as that region of New York was then called, was a “dark
and bloody ground” for full four years, and the records of the woes of the
people have ﬁlled volumes.8 ‘

11. When the fourth year of the war [1778] drew to a close, the British
army had accomplished very little more in the way of conquest, than at
the end of the second year. The belligerent forces occupied almost the
same relative ‘position which they did in the Autumn of 1776,9 while
the Americans had gained strength by a knowledge of military tac-

1. He was a native of Connecticut, and was born-in 1731. He was in the French and Indian war, and
was a brave soldier. He died in Wyoming in 1795.

2. All our histories contain horrible statements of the ﬁend~like character of John Butler, and his un-
mitigated wickedness on this occasion. They also speak of the “ monster Brant” [verse 22, p. 204] as the
leader of the Indians, and the instigator of the crimes of which they were guilty. Both of these men
were bad enough; but recent investigations clearly demonstrate that Brant was not there at all; and
the treaty for surrender, which is still in existence granted most humane terms to the besieged, instead
of the terrible one represented in our histories, as ‘ The Hatchet.”

3. The fugitives who escaped from the valley were chieﬂy natives of Connecticut, and they made
their way homewards as fast as possible. Many of them crossed the Hudson river’ at Poughkeepsie,
where they told their terrible stories, the facts of which were greatly exaggerated by their fears, and
éhese were published in Hows Jowrnal, to form atext for a tale of the direst woe for the future his-

orian. .

tics,‘ naval operations, andthe art of civil government; and they had secured
the alliance ‘of the powerful European rival of Great Britain,9 and the sympathies
of Spain and Holland. The British army was hemmed in upon only two islands,3
almost two hundred miles apart, and each about fourteen miles in length; While
the Americans possessed every other stronghold of the country, and were war-
ring for the dearest rights of common humanity. .

12. D’Estaing sailed for the West Indies [N 0v. 3, 1'7 7 8] in the Autumn, to
attack the British possessions there. To defend these, it was necessary for the
British ﬂeet on our coast, to proceed to those waters/1 This movement would
prevent any co-operation between the ﬂeet and army in aggressive movements
against the populous and now well-defended North; they could only co-operate
in active operations against the sparsely-settled South. These considerations
caused a change in the plans of the enemy; and late in November [N ov. 27],
Sir Henry Clinton despatched colonel Campbell, with about two thousand
troops, to invade Georgia, then the weakest member of the Confederacy. They
proceeded by water, and landed at Savannah, the capital of the State, on the
morning of the 29th of December. General Robert Howe5 was there, with only
about a thousand men, and these were dispirited by thefailure of a recent expe-
dition against Florida in which they had been engagedﬁ They defended thecity
nobly, however, until an overwhelming force, by power and stratagem, com-
pelled them to retire. They then ﬂed, in confusion, up the Savannah river, and
took shelter in the bosom of South Carolina. The capital of Georgia became
the head-quarters of the British army at the South; and the enemy retained it
until near the close of the contest [1782], even when every foot of soil in the
State, outside the intrenchments around the city, was possessed by the patriots.

lions of dollars of continental money1 were aﬂoat without the security of even
good public credit ,2 and their value was rapidly depreciating.3 ' Only small
sums had been obtained, by loan from Europe, and a general tax, imposed by
Congress upon the respective States, Was of little avail. No French army Was
yet upon our soil to aid us, nor had French coin yet gladdened the hearts of un-

chief co-operated with Congress [J an. .177 9] in person, in preparing a plan for
the ‘campaign of 1779. It was ﬁnally resolved to act on the defensive, except
in retaliatory expeditions against the Indians and Tories in the interior.7 This
scheme promised the most beneﬁcial results, for it would be safer and less ex-
pensive, than offensive Warfare. ' ‘

3. The principal military operations of the year were carried on in the two

' extreme sections of the confederacy. The chief eﬁbrts of the Americans were
directed to the conﬁnement of the British army to the seaboard, and chastising '

the Indian tribes. The winter campaign opened by Campbell8 [Dec. 29, 1778],
continued until June, and resulted in the complete subjugation of Georgia to
British rule. '

4. Soon after the fall of Savannah, general Prevost marched from Florida,-
captured [J an, 9, 1779] the American fort at Sunbury,9 and assumed the chief
command of the British forces in the South. In the meanwhile, General Lin-
coln had been appointed [Sept. 1778] commander-in-chief of the southern army
of patriots.” He made his head quarters at Purysburg [J an. 6], twenty-ﬁve
miles above Savannah, and there commenced the formation of an army, com-
posed of some continental regiments, new recruits and the broken forces of
general Howe.” While Lincoln was collecting his forces on the Carolina
bank of the Savannah, Campbell marched‘? up the Georgia side to Augusta, for

Revolution, was a wealthy merchant, with almost unlimited credit. At the period in question, when
Congress could not borrow a dollar on its own credit, Robert Morris found no difficulty in raising mill-
ions upon his own. For a long time he alone furnished the “hard money” which government used.

3. Note 2, p. 183. During this year the British government caused an immense amount of counter-
feit continental bills to be made, and sent to New York. These were scattered by thousands over the
country, and caused universal suspicion of the genuine. By this trick, the true bills were much de-
preciated; but the worst feature of the transaction was the great loss to innocent individuals who had
taken the spurious ones. 4

6. On the 12th of June 1776, Congress appointed a committee to be styled the “ Board of War and

Ordnance," to have the general supervision of military affairs. John Adams was the chairman, and

Richard Peters was secretary. Peters was the real “ Secretary of War” until 1781, when he was suc- -

ceeded by general Lincoln. Gates was chairman in 1778.

the purpose of encouraging the Tories, opening a
communication with the Creek Indzkmsl in the west,
(among whom the British had active emissaries)
and to awe the Whigs. At the same time a band
of Tories, under colonel Boyd, was desolating the
Carolina frontiers, while on their march to join
the royal troops. When within two days’ march
of Augusta} they were attacked [Feb. 14, 1779],
and utterly defeated by colonel Pickens, at the
head of the militia of N inety-siX.3 Boyd and sev-
enty of his men were killed, and seventy-ﬁve
were made prisoners.4 Pickens lost thirty-eight.

5. The defeat of Boyd alarmed Campbell and .

encouraged Lincoln. The latter sent general GENERAL LINCOLE
Ashe, with about two thousand men,5 to drive .
Campbell from Augusta, and to conﬁne the invaders to the low, sickly sec-
tions near the sea. The British ﬂed [Feb. 13, 1779] at the approach of Ashe,
and were pursued by him [Feb. 16] as far as Brier Creek, about forty miles be-
low Augusta, where he halted to establish a camp. There Ashe‘? was surprised
and defeated [March 3] by general Prevost, and lost almost his entire army by
death, captivity and dispersion. Some were killed, others perished -in the mo-
rasses, and many were drowned in attempting to escape across the Savan-
nah.7 This blow deprived Lincoln of one fourth of his army, and led to the tem-
porary re-establishment of royal. government in Georgia!‘

6. Toward the last of April, Prevost crossed the Savannah [April 27] with
two thousand regulars, and a large body of Tories and Creek Indians, and
marched for Charleston. Lincoln had recruited, and was now in the ﬁeld with
about ﬁve thousand men, preparing to recover lost Georgia, by entering the
State at Augusta, and sweeping the country to the sea. But when he discov-
ered the progress of Prevost, and that even the danger of losing Savannah did
not deter him from his attempts upon Charleston, Lincoln hastened to the relief
of the menaced city. The people on the line of his march, hailed him as a de-
liverer, for Prevost had marked his progress by plunder, conﬂagration and cru-
elty. Fortunately for the Republicans, his march was so slow, that when he ar-
rived [May 11] before the city, the people were prepared for resistance.

7. On the morning of the 11th of May, Prevost approached the American in-
city. Gardiner was attacked by general Moultrie withCharlestonlmilitia, on the morning of the 3d of
February. Almost every British officer (except the commander) and many privates.,we_re killed. Gar-
‘(.liJ1:‘er and a few men escaped in boats, and Moultrie, whose loss was triﬂing, joined Lincoln at Purys-

Regulator War Egpse 27, p. 168] and was one of the most active of the North Carolina patriots. He died

trenchments thrown across Charleston Neck1 and demanded an immediate sur-
render of the city. He was answered by a prompt refusal, and the remainder
of the day was spent in preparations for an assault. That night was a fearful
one for the citizens, for they expected to be greeted at dawn with bursting
bomb-shells,9 and red hot cannon balls. When morning came [May 12, 1779],
the scarlet uniforms of the enemy were seen across the waters upon J ohn’s
Island, and not a hostile foot was upon the Charleston peninsula. Prevost had
been informed of the approach of Lincoln, and at midnight he commenced a re-
treat to Savannah, by way of the islands along the coast. For more than a
month some British detachments lingered upon John’s Island. Then they were
attacked at.Stono ll‘erry3 [June 20] by a part of Lincoln’s army, but after a se-
vere engagement, and the loss of almost three hundred men in killed and
wounded, they repulsed the Americans, whose loss was greater. Prevost soon
afterward established a military post at Beaufort, on Port Royal Island,4 and
then retreated to Savannah. The hot season produced a suspension of hostili-
ties in the South, and that region enjoyed comparative repose for several months.

8. While these events were in progress at the South, Sir Henry Clinton was
sending out marauding expeditions from New York, to plunder and harass the
people on the sea coast. Governor Tryon5 went [March 25, 1779] from Kings-
bridge5 with ﬁfteen hundred British regulars and Hessiansff to destroy some
saltworks at :Horseneck, and attack an American detachment under general
Putnam, at Greenwich. The Americans were dispersed [March 26], and Put-
nam barely escaped capture by some dragoons.8 He rallied his troops at Stam-
ford, pursued the British on their return towards New York the same evening,
recaptured a quantity of plunder in their possession, and took thirty-eight of
them prisoners.

9. In May, Sir George Collier entered Hampton Roads‘? [May 9], with a
small ﬂeet, bearing general Mathews, with land troops, destined to ravage the
country in that vicinity. They spread desolation on both sides of the Elizabeth
river, from the Roads to Norfolk and Portsmouth. After destroying a vast
amount of properity, they withdrew; and at the close of the month, they were
up the Hudson river, assisting Sir Henry Clinton in the capture of the fortress at
Stony Point [March 31], and also the small fort on Verplanck’s [June 1] Point,
opposite. Both these posts fell into the power of the British, after a spirited
resistance. . - _ . -

quite narrow by the Ashley and Cooper rivers and the marshes. Across this the Americans had hastily

the Americans the following year. See verse 2, p. 221. I

Tryon, and two thousand five hundred troops, to the shores of Connecticut, to
plunder and destroy the towns on the coast. They plundered New Haven
[July 5], and laid East Haven [July 6], Fairﬁeld [July 8], and Norwalk [July

Wayne, though wounded in the head, wrote to
Washington, “The fort and garrison, with colonel Johnson, are ours.” This
was considered one of the most brilliant events of the wan? The British lost, in
killed, wounded and prisoners, about six hundred men; the loss of the Amer-
icans was ﬁfteen killed, and eighty-three wounded. The spoils were a large
amount of military stores.

medals were awarded to colonels Stewart and De Fleury, for their gallantry on the occasion. Anthony
Wayne Was born in Pennsylvania in 1745. He was a professional surveyor, then a provincial legislator,
and became a soldier in 1775. He was very active during the whole War ; and was eflicient in subduing
the Indians in the Ohio country in 1795. He died on his Way home, at Erie, near the close of 1796.

was a terrible retribution, yet it did not crush the power of the Indians. They
were only awed for a time. The chastisement created the most intense hatred
of the white people of the States throughout all the tribes in the West. They
vowed vengeance ; and Washington, who directed all the military movements,
was called by them An-na-ta-kaw-Zes, or “The town-destroyer.”

SECTION IX.

THE DAHCOTAH on SIOUXSTRIBES.

1. The early French explorers found a greatnumber of tribes west of the
Mississippi, who spoke dialects? of the same language. They occupied the vast
region from the Arkansas on the south, to the western tributary of Lake Win-
nipeg on the north, and westward to the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains.3
They have been classed into four grand divisions, namely, the WINNEBAGOES,
who inhabited the country between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi, among
the ALeoNQUINs;4 the ASSINNIBOINS and, Sioux proper, the most northerly,
nation; the MINETAREE GROUP in the Minnesota Territory, and the SOUTHERN
SIOUX, who dwelt in the country between the Arkansas and Platte rivers, and
whose hunting-grounds extended to the Rocky Mountains.

2. The T/Vimiebagoes often made War upon the Sioux west of the Mississippi.
They generally lived on friendly terms with the ALGONQUINS, after their warlike
spirit was somewhatgsubduedby the Illinois, who, in 1640, almost -exterminated
them. They were enemies to the United States during the second war with

Great Britain";-5 and they confederated with the Sass and Foxes in hostilities

against the white people, under ‘Black Hawk, in 1832.5 The tribe, now [1854]

about four thousand strong, is seated upon the Mississippi, about eighty miles

above St. Paul, the capital of Minnesota.

3. The Assinniboins yet inhabit their native country. Having separated from
the nation, they are called “rebels.” Their neighbors, the Sioim proper, were
ﬁrst visited by the French in 1660, and have ever been regarded as the most-
ﬁerce and warlike people on the continent. They occupy their ancient domain,
and are now [1854] about eighteen thousand strong.

4. The M'im:icw"ees, jlfomdoms, and ,0'7"ows, form the MINETAREE GROUP. I They
are classed with the Dahcoiahs or Sioux, although the languages have only a
slight affinity. The Miiieiarmees and jlfandcms number about three thousand
souls each. They cultivate the soil and live in villages. The C’9"ow3 number

about ﬁfteen hundred, and are Wanderers and hunters. The jlfandans are very

at New York, all his troops at the North. .When this was accomplished, Clin-
ton sailed for the South at the close of the year [Dec. 25], with about ﬁve thou-
sand troops, to open a vigorous campaign in the Carolinas. Washington, in the
meanwhile, had gone into winter quarters at Morristownﬂ

17. Difficulties had gathered thick and fast around Great Britain, during
1779. Spain had declared war [June 16] against her,3 and a powerful French
and Spanish naval armament had attempted [August] to effect an invasion of
England. American and French cruisers were
hovering around her coasts; and in September
[Sept 23] the intrepid John Paul Jones4 had
conquered two of her proud ships of war, after one
of the most desperate naval ﬁghts ever knoWn.5
In America, there had been very little success
for the British arms; and sympathy for the pa-
triots was becoming more and more manifest in
Europe. Even a great portion of the intelligent
English people began to regard the war as not
only useless but unjust. Yet in the midst. of all

0 stores. ‘

2. Verse 6, p. 197. Strong detachments were stationed among the Hudson Highlands, and the cavalry
were cantoned in Connecticut. ,

3. Hoping to regain Gibraltar, Jamaica, and the two Floridas, which Great Britain had taken from
her, Spain made a secret treaty of peace with France in April, 1779, and in June declared war against
Great Britain. This event was regarded as highly favorable to the Americans, because anything that
should cripple England, would aid them. - '

naval service in 1775, and was active during tl1e whole war. He was afterward rear-admiral in‘ the
Russian service. He died in Paris in 1782.

5. The naval operations duringthe War for Independence,
do not occupy a conspicuous place in history, yet they were
by no means insigniﬁcant. The Continental Congress took
action on the subject of an armed marine, in the Autumn of
1775. Already Washington had ﬁtted out some armed ves-
__ sels at Boston, and constructed some gun-boats for use in the

"" -‘“ waters around that city. These were propelled by cars, and

_ aifairs, of which Silas Deane [verse 2, p. 195] was chairman,
was appointed by the Continental Congress in October, 1775. Before the close of the year, the con-
struction of almost twenty vessels had been ordered by Congress ; and the Marine Committee was so
re-organized as to have in it a representative from each colony. In November, 1776, a Continental ‘Navy
,Board to assist the Zlfarine Committee, was appointed ; and in October, 1779, a Board of Admv37~alt3/ was
installed. Its Secretary (Secretary of the Navy) [verse 3, p. 251] was John Brown, until 1771, when he
was succeeded by general McDougal [note 3, p. 198]. Robert Morris also acted as authorized Agent of
Jllarine; and many privateers were ﬁtted out by him on his own account. In November, 1776, Con-

SECTION VII.

SIXTH YEAR or THE WAR FOR 1NDE,1>ENi)ENcE., [1780.]

_ 1. Sir Henry Clinton left the Hessian general, Knyphausen,‘ in command at
New York, when he proceeded [Dec. 25th, 1779] southward‘? with the main

body of his army.

To aid the southern patriots, Washington sent the Baron De

Kalb3 a.nd others thither, the following Spring [1780], and thus the two armies
were so much weakened at head quarters, that military operations at the North

almost ceased during that year.

The Carolinas became the chief theatre of

war, and many and ‘bloody were the acts upon that stage. Invasions from
without, and the cruelties of Tories4 in their midst, made 1780 a year of great
woe for the patriots and their families in the Carolinas.

’2. Clinton and his forces were borne by a strong ﬂeet with two thousand ma-

grass determined the relative rank of the Naval commanders, such
as ad7m'raZ equal to a major-general on land : a commodore equal
to abrrigadier-general,’&c. The ﬁrst commander-in-chief of the
navy, or high admiral, was Esek Hopkins, of Rhode Island,
whom Congress commissioned as such in December, 1775. He
ﬁrst went against Dunmore [verse 25, p. 182] on the coast of Vir-
ginia. He also went to the Bahamas and captured the town of
New Providence, and its governor. Sailing for home, he cap-
tured some British vessels off the east end of Long Island, and

with these prizes he went into Narraganset Bay. In the mean- :

  
     
 
    
   

    

    

while, Paul Jones and Captain Barry were doing good service,   ‘
and New England cruisers were greatly annoying English ship-   . W‘

Congress, issued commissions to naval o cers in Europe. Expe-  ‘

23d of September, while off the coast of Scotland, not far abovethe mouth
of the Humber, Jones, with his ﬂag ship (the Bonhomme Richard), and two
others, fell in with and encountered a small British ﬂeet, which was convey-
ing a number of merchant vessels to the Baltic Sea. An engagement took
place after night had fallen upon the scene, and for three hours, one of the
most desperate sea ﬁghts on record, raged off Flamborough Head. Jones
managed to lash the Richard to the British ship Scrapis, and with muzzle to
muzzle they poured broadsides into each other. Three times both ships were
on ﬁre. The Scrapis ﬁnally yielded, and ten minutes afterward, the Countess
of Scarborough, another large English vessel," surrendered. J ones’s ship was
so much injured that sixteen hours after the battle, she went to the bottom of
the ocean. Congress gave Jones a gold medal for his. bravery. Many other
brave actswere performed by American seamen during the remainder of the
war. For a condensed account of the whole naval operations of the Revolu-
tion, and of the “ whale-boat warfare” on the coast, see supplement to Loss-

on the coast of Georgia in January; andrearly in February [Feb. 10], pro-
ceeded against Charleston. Clinton’s troops were landed [Feb. 11] upon the
islands below _the,_city, on the_shores of the Edisto inlet, thirty miles distant;

but instead of marching at once to make ‘an assault upon the town, the British

commander prepared for a regular Isiegeﬁ General Lincoln was in Charleston
with a feeble force,2 when Clinton landed; and he was about to evacuate the
city and ﬂee to the interior, ‘when intelligence of

taining but triﬂing damage from the guns of Fort Moultrie, anchored within can-
non shot_of the city.8 Clinton. in the meanwhile, had erectedbatteries in front of
the American lines on the Neck,9 and both commanders joined in a summons for
the patriots to surrender. Expecting reinforcements from the interior, the people
of the beleagured city refused compliance, and for more than a month the siege
went on.” In the meanwhile, American detachments sent out between the
Cooper and Santee rivers to keep open a communication with the interior, were
attacked and defeated by parties of British horsemen, “ and at the close of the
month [April, 1780], the city was completely environed by the foe. Cornwallis

‘ had arrivedc[.April 18], from New York with three thousand fresh troops, and

all hopes for the patriots faded.

1. During a severe storm off Cape Hatteras one vessel, carrying heavy battery cannons [note 5, p. 102]
was lost, and almost all the cavalry horses 0 ' Tarleton’s legion, perished at sea. Tarleton supplied him-
self with others, soon after landing, by plundering the plantations near the coast.

2. During the preceding winter, Lincoln’s army had dwindled to a mere handful. The repulse at Sa-
vannah had so disheartened the people, that very few" recruits could be obtained, and when Clinton ar-
rived, Lincoln’ army did not exceed fourteen hundred men in number. The ﬁnances of the State were
in a wretched condition, and the Tories were everywhere active and hopeful. .

3. John Rutledge was born in Ireland, and came to South Carolina when a child. He was one of the
most active patriots of the South. After the war he was made a. judge of the Supreme Court of the Uni-
ted States, and also chief justice of South Carolina, He died in 1800. -

7. He had previously [March 25] crossed the bar, drove Whipp1e’s little ﬂeet to the waters near the
town, and cast anchor in Five Fathom Hole, not far from St. J ohn’s Island. _

. 8. Whipple could not contend with the strong ships, so he sunk several of his vessels near the mouth
of the Cooper river, and formed a chevaux-de-frise [note 2, p. 202] to prevent the enemy’s ships passing
beyond the town, so as to enﬁlade the American works on the Neck. .

9. On Sunday morning, the 1st of April, the British ﬁrst broke ground in the face of eighty cannons
and mortars on the American works. ;

10. General Woodford had just arrived with seven hundred Virginians, and others from North Caroli-
na were reported on their way. A

11. On the 14th of April Tarleton defeated colonel Huger on the head waters of the Cooper river, and
killed twenty-ﬁve Americans. On the 6th of May, a party under colonel White, of New Jersey, were
routed at aferry on the Santee, with a loss of about thirty in killed, wounded and prisoners. These
gr-itish detachments overran the whole country below the Cooper and Santee, in the course of a few

coln and his troops, with a large number of citizens, were made prisoners of war.
The citizens, and a great number of soldiers, were paroled? »Altogether, the
captives amounted to. between ﬁve and six: thousand ;3 and among the spoils of
victory were four hundred pieces of cannon.

5. The loss of this southern army was a severe blow for the.Republicans. It 2.
was followed by measures which, for a time, prostrated South Carolina at the’

feet of royal power. With an activity hitherto unusual for the British officers,‘
Clinton took steps to "secure and extend his conquest, and to re-establish royal
power in the South. He sent out three strong detachments of his army to over-
run the country. One under Cornwallis marched up the Santee toward Camden;
another under lieutenant colonel Cruger, was ordered to penetrate the country
to N inety-siX,4 and a third, under lieutenant colonel Brown, marched to Augus-
ta,5 in Georgia. A general truce was proclaimed, and a pardon to all who should
accept British protection. The silence of fear overspread the whole country;
and mistaking this lull in the storm of war for permanent tranquillity, Clinton
and Arbuthnot, with a large body of troops, sailed [June 5, 1780] for New
York. - A '

6. The lull was of short duration. De Kalb‘? did not reach the borders of
South Carolina until mid-summer, and then not an American was in arms in the
lower country.7 Although Congress had conﬁdence in the skill of De Kalb (who,

2. A prisoner on parole is one who is left free to go anywhere within a prescribed space of country or
within a. city, under certain restrictions relative to conduct. Prisoners taken in War, are often paro ed,
and allowed to return to their friends, with an agreement not to take up arms. It is a point of honor
with a soldier, to . “ keep his parole,” and when such an one is again taken in battle, during the period
of his parole, he is treated not as a prisoner, but as a traitor.

3. In violation of the solemn agreement for surrender, Clinton caused a-great number of leading
men in Charleston, to be seized, and carried on board prison ships, where hundreds suifered tortures.
Many were taken to St. Augustine and immured in the fortress there. -

4. Verse 12, p. 234. 5. Verse 4, p. 214. 6. Verse 1, p. 221.

7. Among the American detachments which had hastened toward Charleston to assist Lincoln, and re-

‘treated when they heard of his fall, was that of colonel Buford, consisting of 400 continental infantry,

and asrnall troop of cavalry, with two field pieces. He retreated from Camden on Cornwallis’ approach,
and near the Waxhaw Creek, some sixty miles further north, he was overtaken and surprised by Tarle-
ton and his cavalry. They gave no quarter, but massacred or maimed the larger portion of Buford’s
command. His loss in killed, wounded and prisoners was 313. He also lost his artillery, ammunition,
and baggage. The cruelty of Tarleton was condemned by British writers themselves.

__ by the capture of Lincoln, became the commander-

‘ send general Gates‘ thither, because of the inﬂu-
ence of his name. When it was known that Gates
was approaching, southern hearts beat high With
hope, for they expected great things from the con-
queror of Burgoyneﬂ Many patriots, who in their
extremity, had signed “paroles” and “protections,”3
seeing how little solemn promises were esteemed by
the conqueror, disregardedboth, and ﬂocked tothe
standard of those brave partisan leaders, Sumter,
Marion, Pickens, and Clarke, who now called them
to the ﬁeld. While Gates and his army were ap-
, preaching, they were preparing the way for con-
Gm,-ERAL GM”.-,_s_ quest. They swept over the country in small
hands, striking a British detachment here, and a
party of Tories there, and soon so effectually alarmed the enemy in the interior,
as to check the onward progress of invasion. . V
7. Sumtert first appeared in power on the Catawba. Repulsed at Rocky
Mount [July 30, 17 80], on that river, he crossed ‘it, and at Hanging-rock, a few
miles.eastward, he fell upon and dispersed [Aug. 6], a large body of British and
Tories; yet, through the folly of his men, he did not secure a victory.5 Marion,"
at the same time, was smiting the enemy among the swamps of the lower country,
on the borders of the Pedee. Pickens was annoying Cruger in the neighbor-
hood of the Saluda, and Clarke was calling for the patriots along the Savannah,
Ogeechee, and Alatamaha, to drive Brown‘? from Augusta.

was soon joined by the earl. Gates came down from the hill country through

Lancaster district, and on the night of the 15th of August, he’ marched from his.

of this movement, Cornwallis and Rawdon advanced at the same hour to surprise
the Americans. A little after midnight they met [August 16, 1780] near
Sanders’s Creek,7 a few miles north of Camden, on the Lancaster road. A slight

1. General Gates had felt so certain of victory,‘ that he had made no provisions for a retreat, or the
salvation of his stores in the rear. His troops were scattered in all directions. Many were shot down in
their ﬂight; and even now [1854] bullets are found in the old pine trees on the route of their retreat. Gates
didl indeed, as general Charles Lee predicted he would, “ exchange his northern laurels for southern
wi ows.” . V

2. De Kalb was a native of Alsace, a German province ceded to France. He had been in America -as
a secret French agent, about ﬁfteen years before. He came to America with La Fayette in 1777, and '
Congress commissioned him a major-general. He died of his wounds at Camden, three days after the
battle. La Fayette laid the corner-stone of his monument in 1825. ' _3. Verse 14, p. 178.

winning the respect of the people by wisdom and clemency, he thought to sub-
due them by cruelty. Private rights were trampled under foot, and social or-
ganization was superseded by the iron rule of military despotism.1 His measures
created the most bitter hatred, and hundreds of patriots, who might have been
conciliated, were goaded into active warfare by the lash of military power.

in various directions to awe the Republicans and
encourage the loyalists. ‘While Tarleton was
operating on the east side of the Catawba, major
Patrick Ferguson was sent to embody the militia
who favored the king, among the mountains west of
he Broad river. Many proﬂigate and ‘worthless
men joined his standard, and on the first of Octo-
_  ber,_ 1780 he crossed the Broad river at , the
 Cherokee ford (Yorkville district), and encamped
 among the hills of King’s Mountain, with about
_  ﬁfteen hundred men. Several corps of Whig
'  ” militia united to oppose him,4 and on the 7th of
LORD COR-NWALLIS. October, they fell upon his camp on King’s Moun-
. tain. Avery severe engagement ensued, and the
British were totallydefeated. Ferguson was slain,5 and three hundred of his
men were killed and wounded. - The spoils of victory, which cost the Americans
only twenty men, were eight hundred prisoners, and fifteen hundred stand of
arms. This defeat was to Cornwallis, what the affair at Benningtonfi was to
Burgoyne. .

12. Marion, in the meanwhile, was daily gaining strengthin the lower country,
and greatly annoyed the British detachments there, while Pickens and Clarke
were hourly augmenting their forces in Georgia and south-western -Carolina.
Sumpter, too, undismayed by his recent defeat, again appeared in the field,7 and
other leaders were coming forth between the Yadkin a.nd Broad rivers. Alarmed
by the defeat of Ferguson, and these demonstrations on ﬂank and rear, Corn-
wallis withdrew [Oct. 14] to South Carolina, a.nd toward the close of October
[Oct. 2'7], made his headquarters at Winnsborough, midway between the Broad

once served in Loyalist corps but were now found in arms against the king, and many who had submit-

with the utmost rigor. See note 2, p. 235. _

2. Charles, earl Cornwallis, was_born in Suﬂblk, England, in 1738. He was educated for military life,
and commenced his career in 1759. After the revolution in America, he was made governor general of
India [note 2, p. 169], then lord lieutenant of Ireland, and again governor of India. He died near
Benares, East Indies, in 1805. .

13. While these events were progressing at the South, others of great im-
portance were transpiringat the North. As‘ We have observed,2 military opera-
tions were almost suspended in this region during the year, and there wereno
offensive military movements worthy of notice, except an invasion of New Jer-

‘New Jersey. They took possession of Elizabethtown [June .7], and burned Con-

14. A few days after this invasion, the American people were madeglad by

the arrival, at‘Newport [July 10]’, of a powerful French ﬂeet, under admiral Ter-

nay, bearing sixthousand land troops under the count de Rochambeau.5 This

rear ; and upon Mount Independence, 500 feet above the point, the strong fortress of Fort Putnam was
built, whose gray ruins‘ are yet visible. Besides these, an enormous iron chain, each link weighing
more than one hundred pounds, was stretched across the Hudson at West Point, to keep British ships
from ascending the river. It was ﬂoated upon timbers. .

15. Benedict Arnold‘ was a bold soldier, but a bad man. Impulsive, vindic-
tive, and unscrupulous, he was personally unpopular, and was seldom Without a
‘ quarrel with some of his companions-in-arms. Soon

phia,2 he-was married to the beautiful young daugh-
ter of Edward Shippen, one of the leading Loyalists
of that city. He lived in splendor, at an ex-
pense far beyond his income. ' To meet the de-
mands of increasing creditors, he engaged in fraudu-
lent acts which made him hated by the public, and
caused charges of dishonesty and malpractices in
ofﬁce to be preferred against him, before the conti-
nental Congress. A court -martial, appointed to
_ _, try him, convicted him, but sentenced him to a rep-
5; “C « " rimand, only. Although Washington performed that
BENEDICT ARNOLD, duty with the utmost delicacy, Arnold felt the dis-
grace. It awakened vengeful feelings which, operat-
ing with the pressure of debt, made him listen with complacency to the sugges-
tions of a bad nature. He made treasonable overtures to Sir Henry Clinton,
and by a correspondence for several months (under an assumed name, and With
propositions couched in commercial phrases) with the accomplished Major
Andre,3 Clinton’s adjutant general, he bargained with the British commander to
betray West Point and its dependencies into his hands. For this service he
wasto receive a brigadier’s commission, and ﬁfty thousand dollars in cash.

16. By patriotic professions, Arnold obtained the command of West Point, in
1780; and the time chosen for the consummation of his treasonable designs, was
when Washington was absent, in September, in conference with the French of-
ﬁcers at Hartford, Connecticut. Arnold and Andre met, for the ﬁrst time [Sept.
22],. at Haverstraw, on the west side of the Hudson, and arranged a deﬁnite
plan of operations. Clinton was to sail up the river with a strong force, and after
a show of resistance, Arnold was to surrender West Point and its dependencies
into his hands. The sloop-of-war Vulture, which conveyed Andre up the river,
was driven from her anchorage by shots from an American cannon on shore,
and he was obliged to cross to the eastern side of the Hudson, and make his way
toward New York, by land.4 At Tarrytown, twenty-seven miles from the city,
he was stopped [Sept. 23] and searched by three young militia men,5 who, ﬁnd-
ing papers concealed in his boots,5 took him to the nearest American post. The
commander could not seem to comprehend the mattef‘; and unwisely allowed
Andre to send a letter to Arnold, then at his quarters opposite West Point.

 

1. He had fought nobly for freedom until 1778, when his passions got the better of his judgment and
conscience. He was anative of Norwich Connecticut, where he was born in January, 1740. He went
to England after the war, and died in flondon, in June, 1801. His young wife died there also two
years afterwards. ,

2 Note 6, p. 209.-

3. Arnold’s hand writing was disguised, and he signed his letters Gustavus. Andre’s letters were signed
John Anderson. A correspondence was carried on between them for more than a year.

4. The sloop lay off Te1ler’s Point, just above the mouth of the Croton river. On that point, some
Americans, with an old iron six-pounder, so galled the Vulture, that she was compelled to drop further
down the river. That old cannon is preserved at Sing Sing, New York.

offered them large bribes if they would allow him to pass, but they refused, and thus saved their‘ coun-

purchased, and deposited in the New York State Library in 1853.

The alarmed traitor fled [Sept 24.] down the river in his barge, and found safety
on board the Vulture.

17. Andre was tried as a spy, found guilty, and hanged at Tappan [Oct. 2, 1780],
opposite Tarrytown, while the real 'mis- -
creaut escaped. Although Arnold did not ac-
complish his_ wicked schemes, he received
the stipulated reward for his treasonable
services. Washington would have spared
Andre, if the stern rules of war had permit- ,-
ted. The young soldier has always been .
more pitied than blamed; while the name .
of Arnold will ever be regarded with the ‘
bitterest scorn. Thankful for this deliver-
ance from the dangers of treason, Congress
voted [Nov. 3, 1780]‘ each of the three 
young militia men, asilver medal and a pen- C A1=ToR’s MEDAL,
sion of two hundredwdollars a year, for life. -

18. Another year now drew to a close, and yet the patriots were not subdued.
England had already expended vast treasures a.nd much blood in endeavors to
subjugate them; and, on account of the rebellion, had involved herself in open
War with France and Spain. Notwithstanding all this, and unmindful of the
fact that a large French land and navalparmament was already on the American

 

1 shores,9 she seemed to acquire fresh vigor _as every new obstacle presented it-

self. _ And when the British Ministry learned that Holland, the maritime rival
of England, was secretly negotiating a treaty With the United States for loans
of money and other assistance, they caused a declaration of war against that
government to be immediately proclaimed [Dec. 20, 1780], and procured from
parliament immense appropriations of men and money, ships and stores, to sus-
tain the power of Great Britain on land and sea.

SEVENTH YEAR or THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE. [1781.]

1. The opening of 1781 was marked by one of the noblest displays ‘of true
heroism, for which the War for’ Independence was so remarkable. Year after

year, the soldiers had suffered every privation from the lack of money and cloth- _

ing. Faction had now corrupted the continental Congress, and the public
welfare suffered on account of the tardiness of that body in the performance of
its legitimate duties. Continental money had become almost worthless,3 and the
pay of officers and men was greatly in arrears. They had asked in vain for
aid; and ﬁnally, on the first day of January, 1781, thirteen hundred of the
Pennsylvania line left the camp at Morristown,4 with the avowed determination

4. The head quarters of Washington were now at New Windsor, just above the Hudson Highlands.
The Pennsylvania troops were cantoned at Morristown, New Jersey; and the New Jersey troops were at
Pompton, in the same State. '

5. The SOUTHERN SIOUX tribes are eight in number, namely, Arkansas,
Osages, Kahzas, Iowas, Missouries, Ozfoes, Omahas and Pzmcahs. They are culti-.
vators and hunters. They live in villages a part of the year, and are abroad,
upon their hunting grounds, during the remainder. Of these tribes, the Osages
are the most warlike and powerful. All of the Southern Sioux tribes are upon
lands watered by the Missouri and the Platte, and their tributaries.

SECTION X.

THE EXTREME WESTERN TRIBES.

1. Within our newly acquired possessions on the borders of Mexico and the
Paciﬁc coast, and the recently organized territories in the interior of the conti-
nent are numerous powerful and warlike tribes,2 of whom little is known, and

whose history has no connection with that of the people of the United States,

except the fact that they were original occupants of the soil, and that some of
them, especiallythe California Indians, yet dispute our right to sovereignty.
Ofltliese, the Oomanches and Apaches of California are the most warlike. The
Pawnees upon the Great Plains toward the Rocky Mountains are very numerous,
but not so warlike ; and the Uzfahs, among the Wasatch and neighboring ranges,
are strong in numbers. Farther northward and westward are the Black-Feet,
Crow, Snake, Nezperces and Flathead Indians, whose domains stretch away
toward the Knisteneaaw and Esquimaaa: on the extreme north.

2. All of these tribes are destined to annihilction. The scythe of civilization
is steadily cutting its swaths over all their lands; and the time is not far distant
when the foot prints of the Indians will be no more known within the domain

of our Republic. In future years the dusky son of an exile, coming from the far-.

off borders of the Slave Lake, will be gazed at in the streets of a city at the
mouth of the Yellow Stone, with as much wonder as the Oneida Woman, with
her blue cloth blanket and bead-work merchandize is now [1854] in the city of
New York.

1. It is said that Madoc, son of Prince Owen Gwynedd, sailed from Wales with 10 ships and 300 men.
about the year 1170. on an exploring voyage westward and never returned.

be whole number of Indians within the present limits of the United States, in 1853, is reported in

the Census to be a little more than 400,000. ' There are about 17,000 in the States eastward of the Missis-

‘ sippi, principally in New York. Michigan, and Wisconsin ; the remainder, consisting of Cherokees, Choc-

taws, and Seminoles, being in North Carolina, Mississippi, and Florida. The number in Minnesota and
along the frontiers of the Western States and Texas, (most of them emigrants from the country eastward
of the Mississippi,) is estimated at 110,000. Those on the Plains and among the Rocky Mountains, not
within any organized Territory, at 63,000 ; in Texas, at 29,000 ; in New Mexico, at 45,000 ; in California,
at 100,000; in Utah, at 12,000; in Oregon and Washington Territories, at 23,000. /For more minute ac-

of marching to Philadelphia, and in person demanding justice from the national
legislature. _
2. When the mutineers reached Princeton, they were met by British emis-

lsaries from New York, who came to seduce them by bribes to enter the service

of the king. Indignant at this implied suspicion of their patriotism, the insur-
gents seized the spies, and delivered them to general Waynel for punishment.
There they were met also, by a deputation from Congress, who relieved their
immediate wants, and gave them such satisfactory guaranties for the future,
that they returned to duty. When oifered a reward for delivering up the spies,
they refused to accept it, saying, “Our necessities? compelled us to demand jus-
tice from our government; we ask no reward for doing our duty to our country
against its enemies!” _

3. On the 18th of January, a portion of the New Jersey line, at Pompton,
followed the example of their comrades at Morristown. But the mutiny was
soon quelled3 [J an. 27], and these events had a salutary effect. They aroused
Congress and the people to the necessity of more efficient measures for the sup-
port of the army. Taxes were imposed and cheerfully paid; a special agent

-sent abroad to obtain loans was quite successful,4 and a national ba.nk5 was es-

tablished at Philadelphia, and placed under the
charge of Robert Morris, to whose superintend-
ence Congress had recently entrusted the public
"Treasury. To his efforts and ﬁnancial credit, the
country was indebted for the means to commence
offensive operations in the Spring of 17 81. He
collected the taxes, and by the free use of his
ample private fortune,‘ and his public credit, he
supplied the army with ﬂour, and other neces-
‘ _, saries, and doubtless prevented their disbanding
 _by their own act. 1 ' '
4. While half-starved, half-naked troops were
making such noble displays of patriotism amid the
ROBERT M0RR1s_ snows of New Jersey, Arnold, now engaged in the
. service of his royal master, was commencing a series
of depredations upon lower Virginia,'With about sixteen hundred British and
Tory troops, and a few armed vessels. Hewent up the James River, and after

now to come out, you should see us ﬁght under your orders, with as much alacrity as ever.”

_2. A committee of Congress appeinted to report on the condition of the army said, a short time pre-
vious_ _to this event, that it was unpaid for ﬁ_ve months, that it seldom had more than six days

3. Washington sent general Robert Howe, with ﬁve hundred men, -to suppress the mutiny. Two of
the ringleaders were hanged, and the remainder quietly submitted._ ,,

4. Colonel John Laurens [note 6, p. 239] was sent to France to ask for aid. He procured about
$1,200,000 as asubsidy, and a further sum as a loan; and also a guarantee for a Dutch loan of about
$2,000,000. These sums, and the operations of Morris’s Bank, gave essential relief.

5. This was called the Bank of North America, the ﬁrst ever established in the United States. Morris
was born ii1‘England in 1733, and came to America in childhood.’ He was a successful merchant in

Pliiladelphia, was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence, and the great ﬁnancier of the

Revolution. He died in 1806, in comparative poverty, having lost an immense fortune by speculations
in lands in Western New York, since known as the Holland Land Company.’s purchase.

ﬂeet, and compelled it to return to_ Newport. General Phillips soon afterward
‘ joined Arnold [March 26] with more than two thousand men,and took the
‘chief command. The traitor accompanied Phillips on another expedition up the
James River [April], and after doing as much’ mischief as possible between Pc-
‘tersburg and Richmond, he returned to New York.3 We shall meet Arnold
presently on the New England coast.4

5. The southern States became the most important theater of the campaign
of 1781. General Grreene,5 who was appointed [Oct. 30, 1780] to succeed gen-
eral Gates in the direction of the southern
army, arrived at head quarters at Charlotte,
on the 2d of Deceinber, and the next day
took formal command. He arranged his
little army into two divisions. ; With the
main body he took post at Cheraw, east of
the Pedee, and general Morgan, was sent
with the remainder (about a thousand strong)
to occupy the country near the‘ junction of
the Pacolet and Broad rivers. Cornwallis’s
position was between the two. That general

Sergeant Champe, one of Major Lee?s dragoons, went in disguise to New York, enlisted into a corps over
which Arnold had command-, ascertained the nature of his nightly movements, and had almost consum-
mated a plan for abducting him and carrying him to the Jersey shore, when the traitor was ordered to
the Southern expedition. Instead of carrying Arnold. off,.Champe, himself, was taken to Virginia with
the corps in which he had enlisted. There he escaped, and joined Lee in the Carolinas. _

5. Nathaniel Greene was born of Quaker parents in Rhode Island, in 1740. He was an anchor-smith
and was pursuing his trade when the Revolution broke out. He hastened to Boston after the skirmish
at Lexington, and from that time, until the close of the war, he was one of the most useful otﬁcers
in the army. He died near Savannah in 1786, and was buried in a vault in that city. His sepulchre can-
not now be identiﬁed. —

He reached the Catawba in the evening, two hours
after Morgan had crossed. Feeling conﬁdent of his prey, he deferred his passage
of the stream until morning. A heavy rain during the night ﬁlled the river to
its brim, and while the British were detained by the ﬂood, Morgan had reached
the banks of the Yadkin, where he was joined by '
general Greene and his escort. ' '

8. Now commenced a remarkable retreat of the
American army under Greene, from the Yadkin to
the Dan. Cornwallis reached the Western bank
of the former [Feb. 3, 1781], justas the Americans
got safely on the eastern shore, and he was again
arrested in his progress by a sudden swelling of
the ﬂoods. Onward the patriots pressed, and soon
Cornwallis was in full chase. At Guilford court
house, Greene was joined [Feb. '7] by his main
body from Cheraw,3 and all continued the ﬂight,
for they were not strong enough to turn and ﬁght.

Greene reached the Dan [Feb. 13], and crossed its rising waters safely into the
friendly bosom of Halifax county, in Virginia. When Cornwallis arrived, a few
hours later [Feb. 14.], the stream was too much swollen to allow him to cross.
For the third time the waters, as if governed by a special Providence, interposed
a barrier between the pursuers and the pursued. Mortiﬁed and dispirited, the
earl here abandoned the chase, and moving sullenly southward through North
Carolina, established his campiat Hillsborough.

 1. John Eager Howard, of the Maryland line. He was born in Baltimore county in 1752. He went into

military service at the commencement of the war. He was in all of the principal battles of the Revolu-
Eigon, was chosen governor of Maryland in 1778, Was-afterwards a United States Senator, and died in Oc-
o er, 1827. .

2. William Washington, a relative of the general. He was born in Stafford county, Va. He entered
the army under Mercer, who was killed at Princeton [verse 5, p. 197], and greatly distinguished himself
at the South, as commander of a corps of cavalry. Taken prisoner at Eutaw Springs [verse 15, p. 235],
he remained a captive till the close of the war, and died in Charleston, in March, 1810 In a personal
combat with Tarleton, at the battle at the Cowpens, Washington wounded his antagonist in his hand.
Some months afterward, Tarleton said sneeringly to Mrs. Willie Jones, a witty American lady, “that
colonel Washington, I am told, is illiterate, and cannot Write his own name.” “Ah ! colonel,” said
Mrs. Jones, “you ought to know better, for you bear evidence that he can make his mark.” At another
time he expressed a desire to see colonel Washington. Mrs. J ones’s sister instantly replied, “ Had you
looked behind you at the Cowpens, you might have had that pleasure.”

BATTLE OF GUILFORD 10. Lord Rawdon5 was now in command of a Brit-
= . ish force at Camden. Greene marched [April 6],
directly for that place, and on the 19th of April he encamped on Hobkirk’s
Hill, about a mile from Rawdon’s intrenchments. Six days afterwards [April
25, 17 81], he was surprised7 and defeatedby Rawdon, after a sharp battle, in

 

1. On his way South to take command of the Southern army, he left the Baron Steuben in Virginia, to
gather recruits, provisions, &c., and forward them to him. This service the Baronperformed with

2. Henry Lee was born in Virginia, in 1756. He entered the military service as captain of a Virginia
company in 1776, and in 1777 joined the continental army. At the head of a legion he performed extra-
ordinary services during the war, especially at the South. He was afterward governor of Virginia, and
a member qt‘ Congress. He died in 1818. '

3. Lee sent two young countrymen, whom he had captured, to the camp of Pyle, to_ inform that
leader, that Tarleton was approaching, and wished to meet him. Pyle had never seen Tarleton, and
when he came -up he supposed Lee and his party to be that of the renowned British oﬂicer. Friendly
salutations were expressed, and at a word, the Americans fell upon the Loyalists, killed almost a hun-
dred of them, and dispersed the remainder. This event took place two or three miles from the scene of
the Regulator battle mentioned on page 168. ” »

4. About ﬁve miles from the present village of Greensborough, in Guilford county, North Carolina.

5. The Americans lost in killed and wounded, about four hundred men, besides almost a thousand who
deserted to their homes. The loss of the British was over six hundred. Among the oiﬁcers who were
killed was lieutenant-colonel Webster, who was one of the most eﬂicient men in the British army. On
this occasion, Greene’s force was much superior in numbers to that of Cornwallis, and he had every ad-
vantage of position. ' .

ger2 to abandon Ninety-SiX3 and join Brown at Augusta ;4
and had also directed Maxwell to leave Fort Granby,5
and retire to Orangeburg,5 on the North Edisto. But
— his orders and his movements were made too late.
“°BKU‘-If-’4‘3 “1LL- Within the space of a week, four important posts fell
- into the hands of the Americans,7 and Greene was mak-
ing rapid marches toward N inety-Six. Lee had pressed forward and co-opera-
ted with Pickens in holding the country between Ninety-Six and Augusta, to
prevent a junction of the garrisons at either of those places. At the beginning
of June [17 81], the British possessed only three posts in South Carolina, name-
ly, Charleston, Nelson’s Ferry‘ and Ninety-Six.

12. Greene commenced the siege of N inety-SiX,3 on
the 22d of May, with less than a thousand regulars
and‘ a few raw militia. For almost a month, his efforts
were unavailing. Then hearing of the approach of
Rawdon, with a strong force, to the relief of Cruger,
the Americans made an unsuccessful eifort [June 18]
to take the place by storm. They raised the siege the
following evening [June 19], and retreated beyond the
Saluda. Rawdon pursued them a short distance, when
he wheeled and marched to Orangeburg.

13. While this siege was progresssing, Lee and
‘Pickens, with Clarke and others of Georgia, were FORT mNETy-s1x,
making successful efforts on the Savannah. Lee cap- '
tured Fort Galphin, twelve miles below Augusta, on the 21st of May, and then

were washing their clothes, and all were unsuspicious of danger.

thirty-eight, slain on the battle ﬁeld.

5. On the western side of the Congaree, two miles from the present city of Columbia, South Carolina.

6. On East bank of the North Edisto, about sixty-ﬁve miles South of Columbia.

7. Lee and Marion were _the principal leaders against these posts. Orangeburg was taken on the 11th
of May ; Fort Motte on the 12th ; the post at Nelson-‘s Ferry on the 14th, and Fort Granby on the 16th.
Fort Watson,’sit-uated on the Santee, a few miles above Nelson’s Ferry, was taken on the 16th of April.
Fort Motte was near thejunction of the Wateree and Congaree, forty miles South from Camden. Nelson’s
Ferry is at the mouth of Eutaw Creek, on the Santee, about ﬁfty miles from Charleston.

8. The principal work was a star redoubt [note 5, p. 176]. There was a picketed inclosure [note 2, p.

[note 5, p. 139] fort. The besiegers encamped at four different points around the works. Kosclusczko

sent an officer to demand of Brown, an instant surrender of his garrison. The
siege of Augusta was commenced on the 23d, and continued until the 4th of
June, when a general assault was agreed upon. 1
Brown now proposed a surrender; and the fol-
lowing day [June 5, 1781] the Americans took
possession of that important post. Tl1ey lost
ﬁfty-one men, killed and wounded; the British
lost ﬁfty-two killed, and three hundred and
thirty-four (including the wounded) made pris-
oners. At the close of the siege, Lee and
Pickensl hastened to join Greene before Ninety-A
Six. —

14. When Rawdon retired toward Orange-
burg, Greene became his pursuer, but ﬁnding
him strongly intrenched at that place, the
A_mericans crossed the Congaree, and the main - --
body encamped upon the High Hills of Scmtee, GENERAL 1>1(}I{1-1}-ts,

in Santee _district, there to pass the hot and _

sickly season. Leaving his troops at Orangeburg, in the command of colonel
Stewart (who had come up from Charleston with a reinforcement), Rawdon
went to the sea-board and embarked for England?

15. Greene was reinforced by North Carolina troops, in August, and at the
close of that month he crossed the Wateree and Congaree, and marched upon Or-
angeburg.'3 Stewart (who had been joined by Cruger from Ninety-Six), retreat-
ed to Eutaw Springs, near the south-west bank of the Santee, and there encamped.
Greene pursued, and on the morning of the 8th of September [1781], a severe
battle commenced. The British were driven from their camp; and Greene’s
troops, like those of Sumter at Hanging Rock,4 scattered among the tents of the
enemy, drinking and plundering. The British unexpectedly renewed the battle,
and after a bloody conﬂict of about four hours, the Americans were obliged to
give way. That night the British retreated toward Charleston. The next day
[Sept. 9, 1781], Greene advanced and took possession of the battle ﬁeld, and
then sent detachments in pursuit of the. enemy.5 The Americans lost in killed,
wounded and missing, ﬁve hundred and ﬁfty-ﬁve. The British lost six hundred
and ninety three. .

16. At this time, Marion, Sumter, Lee and other partisans, were driving British
detachments from post to post, and smiting parties of Loyalists in every direc-
tion. The British ﬁnally evacuated all their stations in the country, and retired
to Charleston, pursued almost to the verge of the city, by the bold American

deal of excitement throughout the South. Among those who took British protection after the fall of
Charleston in 1780 [verse 4, p. 223], -was colonel Isaac Hayne, ahighly respectable Carolinian. When
general Greene, the following year, conﬁned the British to Charleston alone, and their protection had no
force, Hayne considered himself released from the obligations of his parole, took up arms for his country,
and was made a prisoner. Colonel Balfour was then in chief command at Charleston, and from the be-
ginning seemed determined on the death of Hayne. Rawdon exerted his inﬂuence to save the prisoner,
but ﬁnally he consented to his execution, as a traitor. Greene was inclined to retaliate, but fortunately,
hostilities soon afterward ceased, and the ﬂow of blood was stopped. ‘

3. Verse.11,p. 234. 4. Verse 7, p. 224. .
4 5. Congress awarded a gold medal to Greene for his skill and bravery at Eutaw Springs. The battle,
‘although it resulted in the repulse of the Americans, was more disastrous to the British than to them.

scouts. At the close of the year [1781] the British at the South, were conﬁned
to Charleston and Savannah; and besides these places, they did not hold a sin-
gle post south of New York. Late in the season [Nov.] Greene moved his
army’ to the Vicinity of Charleston, while Wayne, early in 1782 [Jan. 1782]
was closely watching the British at Savannah.

17. While Greene and Rawdon were manoeuvring in South Carolina, Corn-
wallis was attempting the subjugation of “Virginia. He -left Wilmington? on the
25th of April, crossed the Roanoke at Halifax, and on the 20th of May, reached
Petersburg, where he took the command of the troops of the deceased Phil-
lips.3 Lafayette was then in Virginia,4 but his force was too small effectually to
oppose the invaders, and the State seemed doomed to British rule. For the

purpose of bringing La Fayette into action, Cornwallis penetrated the country .

beyond Richmond, and destroyed an immense amount of property.5 He also
sent out marauding parties in various directions,5 and for several Weeks the
whole State was kept in great alarm. He ﬁnally proceeded [J une, 1781] slowly
toward the coast, closely pursued by La Fayette, Wayne and Steuben. While
lying at Williamsburg, he received [June 29]» orders from General Clinton, to
take post near the sea, in order to reinforce the garrison at New York, if neces-
sary, which was now menaced by the combined American and French armies.
He crossed the James river [July 9] at Old J amestown,7 and proceeded by land
to Portsmouth; but disliking that situation, he went to Yorktown, on the York
river, and commenced fortifying that place [Aug.] and Gloucester Point, oppo-
site.

18. While these movements were progressing at the

 
 

  
   

  

_ South, the allied armies had met on the Hudson river
,/;f',',‘*/;yj~\,‘<*i/  [July 6], in Westchester county, for the purpose of at-

he sent out expeditions toward Charleston. These were successful, and the enemy was kept close upon
the sea-board, during the remainder of the war.

2. Verse 9, p. 232. 3. Note 3, p. 231. 4. Verse 4, p. 230.

5. The principal object of Cornwallis in marching beyond Richmond, was to prevent a junction of
troops under Wayne, then approaching through Maryland, with La Fayette. But the Marquis Was too
expert, outmarched the earl, and met Wayne on the 10th of June.

6. Colonel Simcoe, commander of the Queen’s Rangers, was sent to capture or destroy stores at the
jinction of the Fluvanna and Rivanna rivers. He also dispatched Tarleton to attempt the capture of
governor J elferson and the Legislature, who had ﬂed from Richmond to Charlottesville, near the resi-
dence of Mr. J eiferson. Seven members of the Legislature fell into his hands [June 4], and Mr. Jeffer-
son narrowly escaped capture by ﬂeeing from his house to the mountains.

7. Here he was attacked by Wayne, who, after striking the British a severe blow, hastily retreated,
with but little loss, back to the main army, two miles distant.

8. Born at Vendome, in France, in 1725. He was a distinguished officer in the French army, and after
his return from America, was“ made a Field Marshall, by his king. He was pensioned by Bonaparte,
and died in 1807.

prospects? \Vhat did British detachments do? What can you tell of Cornwallis’, movements 3 18.

he learned from de Barrasl at Newport, that de Grrasse was about to sail for the
Chesapeake, he resolved to march southward.

19. Washington wrote deceptive letters to general
Greene in New Jersey, and sent them so as to be inter-
cepted by Sir Henry Clinton. He thus blinded the Brit-
ish commander to his real intentions; and it was not
until the allied armies had crossed the Hudson, passed    /
through New Jersey, and were marching from the Dela-   S’
Ware toward the head of Chesapeake Bay,2 that Clinton "
was convinced that an attack upon the city of New _ L,
York was not the object of Washington’s movements. 
It was then too late for successful pursuit, and he en— 
deavored to recall the Americans by sending Arnold to
desolate the New England coast. Although there was
a terrible massacre perpetrated by the marauders at    \

site, almost in. sight of the traitor’s birth-place,4was
burned, it did not check the progress of Washington toward that goal where
he was to win the greatest prize of his military career. Nor did reinforce-
ments sent by water to aid Cornwallis, effect their object, for when admiral
Graves arrived off the Capes [Sept. 5], De Grasse was there to guard the en-
trance to the Chesapeake.-5 He ‘went out to ﬁght Graves, but after a partial
action, both withdrew, and the French anchored [Sept. 10] within the capesﬁ

20. The allied armies, about twelve thousand strong,7 arrived before York-
town on the 28th of September 1781, and after compelling the British to
abandon their outworks, commenced a regular siege. Having completed some
batteries, the Americans opened a heavy cannonade upon the town and the
British works-on the evening of the 9th of October. On the following even-
ing they hurled red hot balls among the English shipping in front of the
town, and burned several vessels. Disasters were gathering a fearful web of
difficulty around Cornwallis. Despairing of aid from Clinton, and perceiving
his strong fortiﬁcations crumbling, one by one, under the terrible storm of iron
from a hundred heavy cannons, he attempted to escape on the night of the

 

16th, by crossing to Gloucester, breaking through the French troops stationed‘

there, and making forced marches toward New York. When the van of his
troops embarked, the waters of the York river were perfectly calm, although dark
clouds were gathering on the horizon. Then a storm arose as sudden and as
fearful as a summer tornado, dispersed the boats, compelled many to put back,

2. This is generally called in the letters and histories of the time, “Head of Elk,” the narrow, upper
part of the Chesapeake being called Elk river. There stands the village of Elkton.

3. Arnold landed at the mouth of the Thames, and proceeded to attack Fort Trumbull, near New
London. The garrison evacuated it, and the village was burned. Another division of the expedition
went up on the east side of the Thames, attacked Fort Griswold at Groton, and after colonel Ledyard
had surrendered it‘, he and almost every man in the fort were cruelly murdered, or badly wounded.
There is a monument to their memory, at Groton.

4. At Norwich, at the head of the Thames, a few miles North of New London. See note 1, p. 228.

5. Graves intended to intercept a French squadron which was on its way with heavy cannons and mil-
itary stores for the armies at Yorktown. He was not aware that de Grasse had left the West Indies.

6. The place of anchorage was in Lynn Haven Bay. The hostile ﬂeets were in sight of each other
for ﬁve successive days, but neither party was anxious to renew the combat. .

7. The whole of the American and French forces, employed in the siege, amounted to a little over
sixteen thousand men. Of the Americans, aboutseven thousand were regular troops, and four thou-
sand militia. The French troops numbered about ﬁve thousand, including those brought by De Grasse
from the West Indies. ~

Questions.-19. How did Washington mislead Clinton‘? What did the allied armies do? What did
Clinton attempt? and how? What can you tell _of Arnold’s expedition to Connecticut? What naval
battle occurred? 20. What can you tell of the siege of Yorktown? What was the result?

praise to the Lord God Omnipotent, for the success of the allied troops, and

these were ' mingled with universal eulogies of the Great Leader and his com.-‘

panions in arms. The clouds which had lowered for seven long years appeared

to be breaking, and the splendors of the dawn of peace burst.forth, like the

light of a clear morning after a dismal night of tempest and woe: And the de-
sire for peace, which had long burned in the bosom of the British people, now
found such potential expression, as to be heeded by the British ministry.
The intelligence of the fate of Cornwallis and his party, fell with all the destruc-
tive energy of a bomb-shell in the midst of the war-party3 in parliament; and
the stoutest declaimers in favor of bayonets and gunpowder, Indians and Ger-
man mercenaries,4 as ﬁt instruments for enslaving a free people, began to talk
of the expedieizcy of peace. Public opinion soon found expression in both
houses of parliament, and Lord N orth5 andhis administration, who had misled

and nearly eleven thousand dollars in specie in the military chest. The army was surrendered to Wasl1-

went to the West Indies. Rochambeau remained with his troops in Virginia during the winter, and the
main body of the American army marched north, and went into Winter quarters on the Hudson. A
strong detachment under general St. Clair [verse 18, p. 202] was sent south to drive the British from
Wilmington, and reinforce the army of general Greene, then lying near.Cl1arleston. '

2. A messenger, with a despatch from Washington, reached Philadelphia at midnight. Before dawn
the exulting people ﬁlled the streets: and at an early hour, secretary Thomson [verse 35, p. 171] read
that cheering letter to the assembled Congress. Then that august body went in proces_sion to a temple

The latter soon afterward left‘ the Chesapeake and

of the living God [October 24th, 17 81], and there joined in public thanksgivings to the King of Kings, for".

memorate the event ; and that two stands of colors should be presented to Washington, and two pieces
of cannon to each of the French commanders, Rochambeau and De Grasse. .
3. Lord George Germaine said that Lord North received the intelligence “ as he would have done a

the nation for twelve ‘years, gave way under the pressure of the peace senti-

came into power, and early in the following May, Sir Guy Carleton arrived in
New York, with propositions for a reconciliation. '

CLOSING EVENTS or THE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE. [1782--1789.]

l. Intelligence of the capture of Cornwallis‘ reached general Greene on the
30th of October 1781, and that day was spent by the army, as one of jubilee.
The event seemed to_ be a guaranty for the future security of . the republicans
in the South, a.nd governor Rutledge? soon called a legislative assembly tomeet
at J acksonborough, to re-establish civil authority. An offer of pardon for peni-.
tents, brought hundreds of Tories from the British-lines at Charleston, to accept
the clemency. Yet the vigilance of the Americans was not allowed to slumber,
for a wary foe yet occupied the capitals of South Carolina a.nd Georgia. Ma-_
rion and hismen kept “watch and ward” over the region between the Cooper
and the Santee, while Grreene’s main army lay near the Edisto; and .Wayne, al-
ways vigilant, kept the enemy as close within his intrench_ments at Savannah.
Alarmed by the approach of St. Clair,3 the British fled from Wilmington, and
took post on St. J ohn’s Island, just below Charleston. Washington, at the same.
time, was keeping Clinton and his army close prisoners in New York.4

2. On the._4th of March, 1782, the British House of Commons,5 on motion
of general Conway, resolved that it “would consider as enemies to his majesty:
and the country, all those who should advise, or by any means attempt the

further prosecution of offensive war on the continent of North America.” Or-.

ders for a cessation of hostilities speedily went forth to the British commanders

in America. On the 11th of July [17 82], the British evacuated Savannah, _,
and on the 14th of December following, they also departed from Charleston.6 They

remained in New York almost a year longer [N ov. 25, 1783] under the com-

mand of Sir Guy Carleton,7 who hadpsucceeded Sir Henry Clinton, because the

ﬁnal negotiations for peace were not completed, by ratification, until near‘ that
time.

3. Five co_mmissioners3 were appointed by the "United ‘States to conclude a_

6. During the preceding Summer general Leslie, the British commander at Charleston, made several
attempts "to penetrate the country fo_r the purpose of seizing provisions for his army. Late in August,

he attempted to ascend the Combahee [verse 20, p. 30], for that purpose, when he was opposed by the’

Americans under general Gist, of the Maryland line. Colonel John Laurens [note 4, p. 230] volunteered
in the service ; and in a skirmish at daybreak, on the 25th of August, he was killed. The last blood
of the Revolution was shed at Stono Ferry [verse 7, p. 215] in September following, when captain
Wilmot was killed in a skirmish with a British foraging party.

commissionersfwere John Adams, John Jay, Dr. Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Henry Laurens.

the people? What occurred in the vicinity of Charleston? 2. Wliat was done in the British House of
Commons ? What was done by the British army in’America? 3. What was done toward the establish-
ment of peace? What can you tell of negotiations and their results? What treaties were agreed to?

treaty _of peace with Great Britain. They met two English commissioners, for
that purpose, at Paris, and there, on the 30th of November, 1782, they signed
a preliminary treaty. French and English commissioners also signed a treaty of
peace on the 20th of January following. Congress ratiﬁedthe action of its com-
missioners in April 1783, yet negotiations were in progress until September
following, when a deﬁnitive treaty was signed1 [Sept. 3, 17 83] at Paris. At the
same time, deﬁnitive treaties between England, France, Spain and Holland, were
signed by their respective commissioners, and the United States became an ac-
knowledged power among the nations of the earth.

4. The joy of the American people, in view of returning peace _and prosper-
ity, was mingled with many gloomy apprehensions of evil. The army, which,
through the most terrible sufferings, had remained faithful and become conquer-
or, was soon to be disbanded; and thousands, many of them made invalids by
the hard service in which they had been engaged, would be compelled to seek
a livelihood in the ‘midst of the desolation which war had produced. For a long
time the public treasury had been empty, and neither ofﬁcers nor soldiers had re-
ceived any pay for their services. A resolution of Congress, passed in 1780
[Oct.,2l], to allow the officers half pay for life, was ineffective, because funds
were wanting. Already the gloomy prospect had created wide-spread murmur-
ings in‘ the army; and on the 11th of March, 1783, a well-written address was
circulated through the American camp (then near N ewburgh), which advised
the army to take matters into its own hands, make a demonstration that should
arouse the fears of the people and of Congress, and thus obtain justice for them-
selves.9 For this purpose, a meeting of officers was called, but the great inﬂu-
ence of Washington prevented a response. He then summoned all the officers
together, laid the matter before them [March 15], and obtained from them a
patriotic expression of their faith in the “justice of Congress and the country.”
In a few days the threatening cloud passed away. '

5. Soon after this event Congress made arrangements for granting to the offi-
cers, full pay for five years, instead of half pay for life; and to the soldiers, full
pay for four months, in partial liquidation of their claims. On the eighth anni-
versary of the skirmish a.t Lexington [April 19, 1.7 83], a cessation of hostilities
was proclaimed in the army, and on the 3d of November following the army was
disbanded by a general order of Congress. That glorious band of patriots then
quietly returned to their homes to enjoy, for the remnant of their lives, the
blessings of the liberty they had won, and the grateful benedictions of their
countrymen. Of the two hundred and thirty thousand continental soldiers, and
the ﬁfty-six thousand militia who bore arms during the war, not more than one
thousand now [1854] remain among us!3 And the average age of these must
be about ninety years. ' '

6. Washington met his oﬂicers at New York, and there had an affectionate

.1.- England acknowledged the independence of the United States : allowed ample boundaries, extend-
ing northward to the great lakes, and westward to the Mississippi, and an unlimited right of ﬁshing on
the banks of Newfoundland. The two Floridas were restored to Spain.

2. This address was anonymous, but it was afterward acknowledged to be the production of John
Armstrong, then ‘a major, and one of general Gates’ aids. He was‘ ‘secretary of War in 1814. See
verse 13, p. 269. ’

3. Great Britain sent to America, during the war, one hundred and twelve thousand ﬁve hundred and
eighty-four troops for the land service, and more than twenty-two thousand seamen. Of all this host,
not one is known to be living. - One of them (John Battin) died in the city-of New York. in June, 1852,
at the age of one hundred years and four months.

Qucstz'ons.—-4. What was the condition of the continental army‘? What caused discontents? What
happened near Newburgh‘? 5. What provisions did Congress make-for the otﬁcers and soldiers of the
Revolution? What military movement occurred? What can you tell of the Revolutionary soldiers?

parting with them’ [Dec. 4, 1783]. He then hastened to‘ Annapolis, in Maryland,
where the Congress was in session, and on the 23d of December he resigned
into its custody, the commission which he received [June 16, 17 7 5] from that

body more than eight years before?

His address, on that occasion, was sim-

ple and touching, and the response of general

Mifﬂin,3 the president, was equally affecting. The
spectacle was one of great moral sublimity.
Like Cincinnatus, Washington laid down the
cares of State and returned to his plow. Al- 
ready the last hostile foot had departed4 [N ov.  
25] and his country was free and independent.5  _,-' "

and there formed an association, which they named the

union among themselves; to commemorate, by frequent
re-unions, the great struggle they had just passed through;
to use their best endeavors for the promotion of human
liberty; to cherish good feeling between the respective
States; and to extend benevolent aid to those of the Society
whose circumstances might require it. They formed a
General society, and elected Washington its ﬁrst president.
They also made provision for the formation of auxiliary
State societies. To perpetuate the Association, it was pro-
vided, in the constitution, that the eldest male descendant
of an original member should be entitled to bear the

8. Although the war was ended and peace was guarantied, the people had
much to do in the adjustment of public affairs so as to lay the foundations of per-
manent prosperity, and thus secure the liberty and independence proclaimed
and acknowledged. The country was burdened with a heavy debt, foreign
and domestic,3 and the Articles of 00nfedercition4 gave Congress no power to
discharge them, if it had possessed the ability. On its recommendation, how-
ever, the individual States attempted to raise their respective quotas, by direct
taxation.5 But all were impoverished by the war, and it was found to be im-
possible to provide means even to meet the arrears of pay due the soldiers of
the Revolution. Each State had its local obligations to meet,5 and Congress
could not coerce compliance with its recommendations.

9. It was now perceived that, while the Articles of Confederation formed a
sufficient constitution of government during the progress of war, they were not
adapted to the public wants in the new condition of an independent sover-
eignty, in whiehthe people found themselves. There appeared a necessity for
a greater centralization of power by which the States would not only be drawn
into a closer union, but the general government could act more etﬁciently for the
public good. A better system of commercial regulations was demanded; and
in September 17 86, delegates from six States convened at Annapolis, in Mary-
land, to consider the matter. This convention suggested the propriety of hold-
ing another, for the purpose of revising the Articles of Cbnfeclerati-on.7 For
that labor, representatives of all the States but Rhode Island, -met in the State
House at Philadelphia8 in May 1787, and chose general Washington to pre-
side. After long deliberation,9 and a clear "perception of the utter inutility of
the existing organic laws, the convention cast aside the Articles of Confederation
and formed an entirely new instrument—the FEDERAL CONSTITUTION under
which we now live. . A . .

1. An order is a badge, or visible token of regard or distinction, conferred upon persons -for meritorious
services. On the breast of Baron Steuben, on page 213, is the order of Fidelity, presented to him by
Frederick the Great of Prussia, for his services in the army of that monarch. Some of the orders con-
ferred by kings are very costly, being made of gold and silver, and precious stones. The picture of the
order of the Cincinnati, given on the preceding page, is half the size of the original.

2. Cincinnatus was a noble Roman citizen. When the Romans were menaced with destruction by an
enemy, the Senate appointed delegates to invite Cincinnatus to assume the chief magistracy of the na-
tion. They found him at his plow. He immediately complied, raised an army, subdued the enemy,
and, after bearing the almost imperial dignity for fourteen days, he resigned his otﬁce, and returned to
his plow. How like Cineinnatus were‘Washington and his compatriots of the War for Independence.’

3. According to an estimate made by the Register of the Treasury in 1790, the entire cost of the war
for independence, was at least one hundred and thirty millions of dollars, exclusive of vast sums lost

by individuals and the several States. The treasury payments amounted to almost ninety/-three mil--

lions, chiefly in continental bills. The foreign debt amounted to eight millions of dollars; and the
dtereeeltic debt, due chieﬂy to the oiﬁcers and soldiers of the Revolution, was more than thirty millions
o c o ars.

‘ 4. Note 3, p. 196.

5. This effort produced great excitement in many of the States, and in Massachusetts, in 1787, the peo-
ple openly rebelled. The insurrection beeame so formidable that an armed force of several thousand
men was required to suppress it. The insurgents were led by Daniel Shay, and it is known in history
as Shag/’s Rebellion.

6. In the Convention, which framed the Federal Constitution, no subject created more earnest debate
than a proposition for the general government to assume the debts of the States contracted in providing
means for carrying on the war. The debts of the several States were unequal. Those of Massachusetts
and South Carolina, amounted to more than ten millions and a half of dollars, while the debts of all the
other States did not extend, in the aggregate, to ﬁfteen millions. This assumption was ﬁnally made, to
the amount of $21,500,000. See verse 4, p. 246. -

7. Verse 2, p. 195. . 8, 1°age 187. -

10. The Constitution was submitted to Congress [Sept 28, 1787], a.nd that
body sent copies of it to the several State Legislatures, in order that it might
be considered in-conventions of the people? These were assembled, and the
requsite number of States having ratiﬁed it,9 Congress ﬁxed the time for choosing
electors?’ for president and vice-president; the time for making choice of these

officers, and the time and place When and Where the government should com- '

old Continental Congress expired, and the FEDERAL CONSTITUTION became the
organic law of the new Republic. Thus was consummated the last act in the

whether the members would come to any agreement ; and some proposed a ﬁnal adjournment. At this
momentous crisis, Dr. Franklin arose, and said to the President, “How has it happened, Sir, that while
groping so long in the dark, divided in our opinions, and now ready to separate without accomplishing
the great objects of, our meeting, that we have" not hitherto once thought of humbly applying to

the Father of Lights to illuminate our understandings? In the beginning of the contest with Britain, '

when we were sensible of danger, we had daily prayers in this room, for divine protection. Our pray-
ers, Sir, were heard, and graciously answered.” After-_ a few more remarks _ he moved that “hence-
forth, prayers, imploring the assistance of Heaven, and its blessings on our deliberations, be held in this
Assembly every morning before we proceed_to business.” The_reso1ution was adopted : clergymen were
invited to oiﬁciate ; greater harmony prevailed in the convention; and so visible was the guidance of

vice-president. Washington came from Mount Vernon, and was greeted with

ovations by the people, throughout his whole journey. On the 30th of April,
he appearedupon the street-gallery of the old City Hall1 in New York, and
there, in the_ presence of an immense concourse of people assembled in front,
the oath of otﬁee was administered to him
by chancellor Livingston? After deliver-
ing an impressive address to the members
of both houses of Congress, the president
and therepresentatives of the people went
in solemn procession to St. Paul’s_ Church,
and there invoked the blessings of the Su-
preme Ruler upon the new government
just inaugurated. _ _ .

2. Never were men called upon to per-
form duties of greater responsibility, than
those which demanded the consideration of
l/Vashington and his compeers. The ﬁrst
session3 was chieﬂy occupied in the organ— '
ization of the new government, and in
the elaborating, of schemes. for the future
prosperity of the Republic.’ The ﬁrst efforts
of Congress were directed to the arrange- ’
merit of a system of revenues/1 to adjust :
and regulate the wretched ﬁnancial affairs
of the country. Three executive depart-
ments—-Treasury, War and Foreign Affairs
——were created, the heads of which were to. «
be styled secretaries, instead of ministers,
as in Europe. These the president might
appoint or dismiss with the concurrence
of the Senate. They were to constitute a
cabinet council, always ready for consulta-
tion with the president, on public affairs,
and bound to give him their opinions in
writing, when required.

jurisdiction over certain speciﬁed cases. During the
session, sixteen articlesof amendmentsto the con-

were subsequently ‘ratified by the States, and be-
came a part of the federal compact. After a session
of almost six months, Congress adjourned [Sept. 29,
1789], and Washington, having appointed his cabinet
council,2 made a brief tour. through the northern and
eastern States to make himself better acquainted
with the people and resources. ‘ .

4. The second session of the first Congress com-

menced in January, 1790, when Hamilton3 made
ALEXANDER HAmLToN_ some of those able ﬁnancial reports, which estab-
lislied the general line of national policy for more
than twenty years. On his recommendation, the general government assumed
the public foreign and domestic debt, incurred by the late War, and also the
State debts, contracted during that period._4 A system of revenue from imposts
and internal excise, proposed by Hamilton, was adopted; and an act was passed
making the District of Columbia5 the permanent seat of the Federal govern-
ment, after the lapse of ten years from that date.

5. A third session commenced in December, 1790, and before its close,
measures were adopted which laid the foundations of public credit and national
prosperity, deep and abiding. North Carolina [N ov. 21, 17 89], and Rhode Island
[May 29, 17 90], had already become- members of the Confederacy, by adopting
the constitution;5 and during this session, Vermont7 was admitted. [Feb. 18,
1791] as a sovereign State. Settlements were now rapidly spreading beyond
the Alleghanies,8 and the subject of territorial organizations was pressed upon

 

was appointed the ﬁrst Chief Justice of the United States, and
Ediniiiid Randolph, of Virginia, was made Attorney—General.
Randolph succeeded Patrick Henry as governor of Virginia in
1786, and was very active in the Convention of 1787. See
verse 9, p. 242. He succeeded J eiferson as Secretary of State,
and died in 1813. .

2. Alexander Hamilton was appointed Secretary of the Treas-
ury; Henry Knox, Secretary of War; and Thomas Jefferson,
Secretary of Foreign Aﬁ"airs. J efferson was then United States
minister at the court of France, and did not enter upon his duties
until March 1790. The oiiice of Secretary of the Navy was not
created until the presidency of Mr. Adams. Naval affairs were
under the control of the Secretary of War. General Knox
was one of the most efficient oiiicers of the Revolution, having,
from the beginning, the chief command of the artillery. He
was born in Boston in 1750, entered the army as captain of
artillery, and rose to the rank of major—general. He resigned
his secretaryship in 1794, and died in Maine in 1806. - .

New York in their Revolutionary movements, while yet student of King’s (now Columbia) college. _He
was Wasliington’s secretary, and was always distinguished as a ﬁne writer and accomplished soldier.
He was truly one of the great men of our history. He was forced into a personal combat with Aaron
Burr, which cost him his life in July, 1804. His widow is yet [1854] living, at the age of ninety-seven years.

western posts belonging to the United States, and the fact that tlrley were con-
tinually exciting the Indians against the American people, "caused a prevalent
belief that the British government yet hoped for an opportunity- to bring the
new Republic back to colonial dependence. Finally, in the Summer of 1790,
the fostered discontents of the Indians Were develo ed into 0 en hostilities. At-
tempts at paciﬁc arrangements were fruitless, and general I-Ieiinier was sent into _
the Indian country north of the present Cincinnati, with quite a strong force, to
desolate their villages and cropsas Sullivan did those of the Senecas in'1779.4
In this he succeeded, but in two battles [Oct. 17 and 22, 1790], near the present
village of Fort Wayne, in Indiana, he was defeated, with considerable loss. A year
afterward, general St. Clair,5 then governor of the North-I/Vest Territory, marched
into the Indian country, with two thousand men. While in‘ camp near the
northern line of Darke county, Ohio, on the border of Indiana, he was surprised
and defeated [N 0v. 4, 17 91] by the Indians, with a loss of about six hundred
men. » -

8. General Wayne‘? was appointed to succeed St. Clair in military command,
and he marched into the Indian countr in the Autumn of 1793. He spent the
Winter near the place of St. Cla-ir’s defgarat, where he built Fort Recovery, and
the following Summer [17 94] he pushed forward to the Maumee river, and built
Fort Deﬁance.7 He went down that stream with three thousand men, and not
far from the present Maumee city,8 he fought and defeated [Aug. 20] the Indians.9
He then laid Waste their country; and the following year the chiefs of the VVest-
ern tribes met [Aug. 3,1795] commissioners of the United States, at Greenville,1°
made a treaty of peace,” and ceded to the latter a large tract of land in the
present states of Michigan‘? and Indiana. After that, the United States had very
little trouble with the Western Indians, until just before the breaking out of the
War of 1812—’15.13 . — .

fered materially concerning important public measures, and then Was drawn
those lines of party distinction, known as Federalist a.ndRepabZz'cem,1 which con-
tinued for a quarter of a century. During the Summer of 1792, very little of
public interest occurred, except the admission [June 1, 1792] of Kentucky? into
the Union, but the marshalling of forces for the presidential election. In the
Autumn, Washington and Adams were re-elected by large majorities, yet_ the
Republican party were daily gaining strength. A bloody revolution was in pro-
gress in France. The people there had abolished monarchy, andmurdered their
king, and the new Republic in name (a political chaos in reality), sent M. Genet
as its minister to the United States, to obtain the co-operation of the American
people. The French Republic had declared war against England, Spain, and
Holland, and needed transatlantic assistance. Remembering the recent alliance,3
and sympathizing with all efforts for popular freedom, the Republican party
here, and many of the Federalists, received Genet’: With open arms, and espoused
his cause. - A

10. Genet’s zeal outstripped his prudence, and defeated his plans. Without
Waiting for an expression of opinions or intentions from the government of the
United States, he began to ﬁt out privateers5 in our ports, to depredate upon
English, Dutch, and Spanish property ,6 and when Washington prudently issued
[May 9, 1.793] a proclamation, declaring it to be the duty and the interest of the
people of the United States to preserve a strict neutrality toward the contending
powers of Europe, Genet persisted, and tried to excite "hostility between our
people and their government. Washington ﬁnally requested [July], and ob-
tained his recall, and Fauchet, who succeeded him [17 94], was instructed to as-
sure the President that the French government disapproved of Genet’s7 conduct.
No doubt the prudence and ﬁrmness of Washington, at this time, saved our Re-
public from utter ruin. ' _

11. A law passed in 1791, which imposed duties on domestic distilled liquors,
was very unpopular; and when, in 17 94, ofﬁcers were sent to enforce it among the
Dutch inhabitants of western Pennsylvania, they were resisted by the people in
arms.8 After issuing two proclamations [Aug. 7, Sept. 25] without eifect, the
president sent [October] a large body of militia, under general Henry Lee,9 to
enforce obedience. The last argument was eifectual. This event is known in
history as the Witisleey I7zsm”rectz'0n.

12. While these internal commotions were disturbing the public tranquillity,

1. The Federalists were those who favored the concentration of great power in the Federal Govern-
ment. The Republicans were for diffusing power among the people.

2. Kentucky, which had been settled chieﬂy by Virginians, and was claimed as a part of the territory
of that State, was now erected into a sovereign member of the confederation. Its ﬁrst settlement was
at Boonesboro, by Daniel Boone, in 1775. He and Clarke [verse 13, p. 218] were co-workers against the
British and Indians, during the Revolution, and by extraordinary exertions, they redeemed a great portion
of Kentucky from savage rule. Yet Boone died in 1820, at almost ninety years of age [note 1,‘ p. 218],
without owning sulﬁcient land for a burial-place in all Kentucky. The legislature of Missouri gave him
two thousand acres of wild land. ..

6. These cruisers brought captured vessels into our ports, and French consuls actually held courts of
admiralty, and authorized the sale of the prizes; and all this was done before Genet was recognized as a
ministe1',by the American government. .

7. Edward Charles Genet was the son of a distinguished public man in France. He married a daughter
of governor George Clinton [note 4 , p. 241], and remained in the United States. He died at Jamaica,
Long Island, in 1834, aged seventy-two years. He left a large quantity of valuable papers, which a
member of his family is now‘[1854] preparing for publication.

8. The insurrection became general in all the western counties, and in the vicinity of Pittsburg many
outrages were committed. Buildings were burnt, mails were robbed, and government ofﬁcers were in-
sulted and abused. It was estimated that at one time the insurgents numbered seven thousand.

a bitter feeling was growing up between the American and British governments,
which threatened to involve the two nations in war. Each accused the other
of infractions of the treaty of 1783,‘ and the dis- -  —
putes, daily assuming a more bitter tone, threatened
to involve the two nations in another war. In_
order to avert an event so very undesirable, John
J ay2 was appointed [April 19, 1794] an envoy ex-
.traordinary3 to the British court, to adjust all
matters in dispute. The Americans complained
that no indemniﬁcation had been made for negroes
carried away at the "close of the revolution ,4 that
the British held military posts on their frontiers,
contrary to the treaty ,5 that British emissaries
had excited the hostility of the Indians ;5 and that
to retaliate on France, the English had captured
our neutral vessels, and impressed our seamen?’
into the British service. The British complained
that stipulations concerning the property of Loy-

 

,alists,8 and also in relation to debts contracted in England before the close of

the war, had not been complied with.

13. Mr. Jay negotiated a treaty which was not very satisfactory. It pro-
videdfor the collection of debts here, by British creditors, which had been
contracted before the Revolution, but it procured no redress for those who had
lost negroes. It secured indemnity for unlawful captures on the seas, and the
evacuation of the forts on the frontiers, by the ﬁrst of June, 1796. The treaty
gave rise to violent debates in Congress, and in State legislatures, but was rat-
ified by the Senate on the 24th of June, 1795.9 In October following, a treaty
was concluded with Spain, by which boundaries between the Spanish territories
of Louisiana and Florida, and the United States, were deﬁned. That treaty
also secured to the United States the free navigation of the Mississippi, and the
use of New Orleans, as a port, for ten years. I

14. American commerce now began to ﬁnd its way into the Mediterranean,
but was there met by Algerine pirates, who seized the merchandize,’and held
the seamen in captivity, in order to procure ransom money. These depredations
gave rise to efforts to organize a navy; and in 1794, Congress appropriated
almost seven hundred thousand dollars for the purpose. But the United States
were compelled to make a treaty [November 28, 1795] of peace with the

(icy of Algiers, by which an annual tribute was given for the redemption '

of captives, in accordance with the long-established usage of European nations.“’

New York in 1745. He was early in the ranks of active patriots, and rendered very important services

years. His residence was at Bedford, Westchester county, New York.

of the treaty. Mr. Jay was burned in etﬁgy [note 2, p. 163], Mr. Hamilton was stoned at ‘a
public meeting, and the British minister in Philadelphia, was insulted. But the treaty resulted in

planted colonies there also. A There was traffic
between the colonists of Iceland and Greenland,
and the parent Norwegians and Danes, as early ,
as the year 950. In the year 1002, acording to
an Icelandic chronicle, a Norwegian vessel,
commanded by Captain Lief, sailed from 106-

to the coast of Labrador. Tlieyiexplored the

250 1 THE CONFEDERATION.

15. The administration of Washington now drew to a close. It had been
one of vast importance and incessant action. All disputes with foreign nations,
except France,1 had been adjusted; government credit was established, and the
nation was highly prosperous? The last year of his administration was signal-
ized by the admission [June, 1796] oi Tennessee into the Unionof States, making

' the number of confederated republics, sixteen.

16. And now came the ﬁrst great strug-
gle for ascendency,_ A between the Feder-
alists and the Republicans.3 The only
man on whom the natio11 could unite
was about to retire from public life. The
Federalists nominated John Adams, and
the Republicans, Thomas Jefferson, for the
Presidency. The contest was ﬁerce, and

resulted in the election of Adams, with J ef-
\: p ‘ H \ ferson for Vice-President. It wasa victory
  ~ '    for both parties.‘ On the 4th of March

‘ v ‘ ‘ ' ’ following [1797], Mr. Adams was inaugurat-
ed, and Wasliiiigton, who had already is-.
sued [September, 1796], a Farewell Aclclress

triotism, retired to the quietude of Mount
Vernon, from which he was never again en-

1. President Adams4 adopted the federal

policy of his illustrious predecessor. The
unpleasant relations existing between France
and the United States, received the earliest

American vessels, used the property, and made one hundred and eighty oﬂicers and seamen, slaves of
the most revolting kind. In 1795, the United States agreed, by treaty, to pay $800,000 for captives, then
alive, and in addition, to make the dey, or governor, a present of a frigate, worth $100,000. An annual
tribute of $23,000, in maritime stores, was also to be paid. This was complied with until the break-
ing out of the war of 1812. .

1. The French government was highly displeased because of the treaty made with England, by.Mr. Jay,
and even adopted hostile measures toward the United States.

2. Commerce had wonderfully expanded. The exports had, in ﬁve years, increased from $19,000,000,
to morethan $56,000,000, and the imports in about the same ratio. _

the popular movement at Boston. He was a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and for a long
time a representative of the United States in Europe. He died on the 4th of July [verse 4, p. 284], 1826.

dent convened an extraordinary Congress on the 15th of May, 1797. In the

meanwhile, our Government had been insulted by the French minister here,
and by. the French Directory} The American minister, Charles Cotesworth
Pinckney, had been ordered to leave France, and that government had authorized
depredations upon our commerce.

2. Congress appointed [July] three envoys,9 with Pinckney at their head,
to proceed to France, and adjust all difﬁculties. They were refused an au-
dience [October] with the Directory, unless they should ﬁrst pay a la.rge sum
of money into the French Treasury. The demand was indignantly refused.3
The two Federalist envoys (Marshall and Pinckney) were ordered_ out of the
country, while Mr. Grerry, who was a Republican, and whose party sympa-
thized with the measures of France, was allowed to remain.‘ 1

3. Perceiving the vanity of further attempts at negotiation, Congress, during
its next session,4 and the country generally, began to prepare for war. Quite a
large standing army was authorized [May, 1798], and as -_VVashington approved
of the measure, he was appointed [July] its commander-in-ehiefﬁ A naval
armament, and the capture of French vessels of war, was authorized; and a

' naval. department, with Benjamin Stoddart of Maryland, at its head, was cre-

ated. ~Hostilities -even commenced, on the ocean, and a vessel of each nation
suffered capture,3 but the army was not summoned to the ﬁeld.

' 4. The digniﬁed and decided measures7 adopted_by the United States, hum-
bled the proud tone of the French Directory, and that body made overtures for
a peaceful adjustment of difficulties. President Adams immediately appointed
[Feb. 26, 17 99] three envoys3 to proceed to France and negotiate for peace, but
when they arrived, the weak Directory was no more. The government was in
the hands of Napoleon Bonaparte [N ov. 1799] as First Consul,9 whose audacity
and energy now saved France from anarchy and utter ruin. He promptly re-
ceived the United States ambassadors, concluded a treaty [Sept. 30, 1800], and
gave such assurances of friendly feelings that, on the return of the ministers,

1. The Republican government of France was administered by acouneil called the Directory. It

executive power of the government. — '

Marshall had been an active pat-riot and soldier. The latter was afterward Chief Justice of the United
States, and administered the oath of otﬁce to several presidents. .

3. These overtures were made by punotﬁcia-1 agents, employed by the French Directory. It was on
this occasion that Pinckney uttered that noble sentiment; “Millions for defence, but not one cent for

5. General Alexander Hamilton was appointed his lieutenant, and was the immediate and active com-
mander-in-chief. It was hardly expected that Washington would engage in actual service.

6. The United States frigate Constellation, captured the French frigate L’Insurgente, in February,
1799. That frigate-had already taken the American schooner Retaliation. On the ﬁrst of February,
1800, the Constellation had an action with the French frigate La. Vengeance, but escaped capture after a
loss of one hundred and sixty men, killed and wounded.

7. Two unpopular domestic measures were adopted in the Summer of 1798, known as the Alien and
Sedition laws. The ﬁrst authorized the President to expel from the country any alien (not a citizen) who
should be suspected of conspiring against the Republic. It was computed that there were more
than thirty thousand Frenchmen in the United States. The Sedition law authorized the suppression of
publications calculated to weaken the authority of the government. These were unpopular, because they
might lead to great abuses. .

[note 3, p. 226], of North Carolina, took his place.

9. Bonaparte, Cambaceres, and the Abbe Sieyes, became the ruling power of France, with the title

of Consuls, after the first had overthrown the Directory. Bonaparte was the First Consul, and was, in

-fact, an Autocrat, or one who rules by his own will.

the provisional army of the United States was disbanded. Its illustrious C0111-
mander-in-chief had already been removed by death.

5. Washington died at Mount Vernon on the 14th of December, 17 99, when al-
most sixty-eight years of age. No event since the foundation of the govern-
ment, had made such an impression on the public mind. Thenational grief was
sincere, and party spirit was hushed into silence, at his grave. All hearts united
in homage to the memory of him who was properly regarded as the Father of
his Country. Impressive funeral ceremonies were observed by Congress, and
throughout the country. General Henry Lee,1 of Virginia, delivered [Dec. 26,
1799], an eloquent funeral oration before the national legislature, and the recom-
mendation of that body for the people of the United States to wear crape on
their left arms for thirtydays, was generally complied With? The whole nation
put on tokens of mourning. The death of Washington made a profound impress-
ion in Europe, also. To the people there, who were aspiring for freedom, it
seemed as if a bright star had disappeared from the ﬁrmament of their hopes.

6. Very little of general interest occurred during the remainder of Mr. Adams’s
administration, except the removal of the seat of the Federal Government to
the district of Columb_ia,3 during the Summer of 1800 ; the admission [May,
1800] of , the country between the western frontier of Georgia and the Missis-
sippi giver, into the Union, as the Mssisszppi Territory, and the election of a new
Presi ent of the United States. N ow, again,came a severe struggle between
the Federalists and Republicans, for political power. The former nominated Mr.
Adams and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney,4 for President; the latter nominated
Thomas J elferson and Aaron Burr,5 for the same office. In consequence of dis-
sensions among Federalist leaders, and the rapid development of ultra-democratic
ideas among the people, the Republican party was successful. J eiferson and
Burr had the same number of votes. The former was afterward elected presi-
dent by the House of Representatives!‘

JEFFERSON’S ADMINISTRATION. [1801—1809.]
1. Mr. J.efi‘erson7 was inaugurated [March 4, 1801] in the new capitol, at Wash-

John Marshall, then chief justice of the United States. He retained, for a short

there, to be paid for by individual subscriptions.

4. Verse 1, p. 250. 5. Verse6, p. 255.

6. When the electors counted the votes, Jefferson and Burr had an equal number. The choice was
therefore transferred to the House of Representatives, according to the provisions of the Constitution.
The choice ﬁnally fell upon Mr. J eﬁerson, after thirty-ﬁve ballottings; and Mr. Burr Was proclaim-
ed vice-president. During 1800, another enumeration of the inhabitants of the Union was made. The
population was then 5,319,762, an .increase of 1,400,000 in ten years. The revenue, which amounted to
$4,771,000 inv1790, amounted to almost $13,000,000 in 1800. '

7. homes J eiferson was born in Virginia in 1743. He was a signer of the Declaration of Indepen-
dence [verse 10, p. 187], governor of Virginia, and a foreign minister. He retired from public life in
1809, and died on the 4th of July [verse 4, p. 284], 1826.

other seats in-his cabinet? The Federal
party, while in power, having generally ex-
cluded Republicans from office, J eifersoii
felt justiﬁed in giving places to his own
political friends. He made many removals
from oﬁicial station throughout the country,
and then commenced the second act in the
system of political prescription, which has
not always proved wise or salutary.

2. J efferson’s administration was signal-
ized, at the beginning, by the repeal of the
act imposing internal duties,3 and other ob-
noxious and unpopular laws. Vigor and
enlightened views marked his course; and
even his political opponents confessed his
forecast and wisdom, in many things. Dur-
ing his ﬁrst term, one State and two Terri-
tories were added to the confederacy. A
part of the N orth-Western Territory4 be-
came a State,’ under the name of Ohio,5 in
the Autumn of 1802 ; and in the Spring of

6. In violation of a treaty made in the year 1795, the Spanish governor of Louisiana closed the
port of New Orleans in 1802. Great excitement prevailed throughout the Western settlements; and a
proposition Was made in Congress, to take forcible possession of the Territory. It was ascertained that
by a secret treaty, the country had been ceded to France, by Spain. Negotiations for its purchase were
immediately opened with Napoleon, and the bargain Was consummated in April, 1803. The United
States took peaceable possession in the Autumn of that year. It contained about 85,000 mixed inhabit-
ants, and about 40,000 negro slaves. When this bargain was consummated, Napoleon said, prophet-
ically, “This accession of territory strengthens forever the power of the United States; and I have
just given to England a maritime rival that will sooner or later humble her pride.”

States government now determined to cease paying tribute to them. The ba-
shaw of Tripoli declared war [June 10, 1801] -
against the United States; and captain Bain-
bridge was ordered to cruise in the Mediter-
ranean to protect American commerce. In
1803, commodore Preble Twas sent thither
to humble the pirates. After bringing the
emperor of Morocco to terms, he appeared
before Tripoli, with his squadron. One of his
vessels (the Philadelphia), commanded by
Bainbridge,3 struck on a rock in the harbor,

"were made slaves.

following year. The bashaw was a usurper, and Harriet, the rightful heir to

1. Morocco, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli, in Africa. A They are known as the Barbary; Powers.

2. In September, 1800, captain Bainbridge arrived at Algiers, in the frigate George Washington, with
the annual tribute money [verse 14, p. 249]. The dey, or governor, demanded the use of his vessel to
carry an ambassador to Constantinople. Bainbridge remonstrated, when the dey haughtily observed
“ You pay me tribute, by which you become my slaves, and therefore I have a right to order you, as I

-think proper.” Bainbridge was obliged to comply, for the castle guns would not allow him to pass out

of the harbor. He had the honor of ﬁrst displaying the American ﬂag before the ancient city of Constan-
tinople. The Sultan regarded it as a favorable omen of future friendship, because his ﬂag bore a cres-
cent or half-moon, and the American, a group of stars. 

3. William Bainbridge was born in New Jersey in 1774. He was captain of a merchant vessel at the
age of nineteen years, and entered the naval service in 1798. He was distinguished during the second
War for Independence [verse 6, p. 260], and died in 1833. . -

4. Stephen Decatur was born in Maryland in 1779. He entered the navy at the age of nineteen years.
After his last cruise in the Mediterranean, he superintended the building of gun-boats. He rose to the
rank of commodore ; and during the second War for Independence [verse 6, p. 260], he was distinguish-
ed for his skill and bravery. He afterward humbled the Barbary Powers [note 1, p. 254] ; and after
returning home, he was killed in a duel with commodore Barron, in March,1 0.

the throne,1 was an exile in Egypt. He readily concerted
with captain William Eaton, American consul at Tunis, in
a plan for humbling the bashaw, and obtaining his own
restoration to rightful authority.‘ Captain Eaton acted un-
der the sanction of his government, and early in March
[March 6, 1805], he left Alexandria, with seventy United
States seamen, accompanied by Hamet and his followers,
and a few Egyptian troops. ‘ They made a journey of a
thousand miles across the Libyan desert, and on the 27th
of April, captured Derne, a Tripolitan city on the Mediter-
ranean. Three weeks later [May 18], they had a successful
battle With Tripolitan troops; and on the 18th of June they
, e , again defeated the forces of the bashaw, and pressed for-
 T  Q Q ward toward Tripoli. The terriﬁed ruler had made terms of

6. The great West was now rapidly ﬁlling with 1 ’
adventurers,’ and the materials for new States were
gathering. Michigan was erected into a territory
[1805], and all along the Mississippi, extensive set-
tlements were locating. Taking advantage of the
restless spirit of these‘ settlers, and the general im-
pression that the Spanish population of Louisiana
would not quietly submit to the jurisdiction of the 
United States,4 Aaron Burr sought to make them 
subservient to his own ambitious purposes. His mur-

met him on the west side of the Hudson, near Hoboken, where they fought with pistols. Hamilton dis-
charged his weapon in the air, but Burr took fatal aim, and his antagonist fell. Hamilton diedthe next
day. His widow, the daughter of general Schuyler [verse 18, p. 180], died on the 9th of November 1854,

7. The year 1807, is remarkable in American
history, as the era of the commencement
of successful steamboat navigation. Experi-
ments in that direction had been made in
this country many years before, but it was
reserved for Robert Fulton to bear the honor
of success. He spent many years in France,
in the study of the subject, and through

8. The progress of events in Europe now’
began to disturb the amicable relations which
> had subsisted between the governments of the
United States and Great Britain, since the ratiﬁ-
/;,: cation of J ay’s treaty.5 Napoleon Bonaparte
 was upon the throne of France as emperor, and
W, ' in 1806 he was king of Italy,'and his three
brothers Were made ruling monarchs. Although
England had joined the continental powers against
him [1803], in order to crush the Democratic revolution commenced in France,
all Europe was yet trembling in his presence. But the United States, by
maintaining a strict neutrality, neither coveted his favors nor feared his power;
at the same time American shipping being allowed free intercourse between
English and French ports, enjoyed the vast advantages of a proﬁtable carrying
trade between them.

9._ But the belligerents, in- their anxiety to damage each other, ceased to re.-
spect the laws of nations toward neutrals, and adopted measures at once destruc-
tive to American commerce, and in violation of the most sacred rights of the
United States. In this matter, Great Britain took the lead. By an order in

my, and accompanied Arnold [verse 21, p. 180] in his expedition against Quebec. Ill health compelled

trade.3 The United States lacked a navy to pro- 1
tect her commerce on the ocean, and the swarms of gun-boats,4 which Congress
had authorized as a substitute, were quite inefficient, even as a coast-guard.

10. The American merchants and all in their interest, so deeply injured by
the “orders” and “ decrees ”5 of the warring monarchs, demanded redress of griev-
ances. Great excitement prevailed throughout the country, and the mostbitter
feeling was beginning to be felt against Great Britain. ' This was increased by
her haughty assertion and-offensive practice of the doctrine that she had the
right to search American vessels for suspected deserters from the British navy,“
and to carry away the suspected without hinderance. This right was strenu-
ously denied, and its policy vehemently condemned, because American seamen
might be thus forced into the British service, under the pretence that they were
deserters. Indeed, this had already happened.7 ,

11. A crisis approached. , Four seamen on board the United States frigate
Chesapeake, were claimed as deserters from the British armed ship ll/[eZampas.3

,,They were demanded, but commodore Barron, of the Chesapeake, refused to
‘give them up. The Chesapeake left the capes of Virginia on a cruise on the

22d of June, 1807, and on the same day she was chased" and attacked by the
British frigate Leopard. Unsuspicious of danger and unprepared for an attack,
Barron_surrendered his vessel, after losing three men killed and eighteen wound-
ed. The four men were then taken on board the Leopard, and the Chesapeake
returned to Hampton roads.9 Investigation proved that three of the seam en (col-

and having no direct connection with the cabinet ministers. The sovereign may, under the advice of this
council, issue orders or proclamations which, if not contrary to existing laws, are binding upon the sub-
jects. These are for temporary purposes, and are called Orders in Council. '

2. Napoleon intended this as a blow against England’ s maritime superiority, and it was the beginning
of what he termed the Continental System, the chief object of which was the ruin of Great Britain.

3. In May, 1806, James Monroe [verse 1, p. 279] and William Pinckney, were appointed to assist
in the negotiation of a treaty with Great Britain, concerning the rights of neutrals, the imprisonment
of seamen, right of search, 820. A treaty was ﬁnally signed, but as it did not offer security to American
vessels against the aggressions of British ships in searching them and carrying off seamen, Mr. J eiferson
refused to submit it to the Senate, and rejected it. The Federalists condemned the course of the Presi-
dent, but subsequent events proved his wisdom.

4. These were small sailing vessels, having a cannon

Our laws give equal protection to the native and adopted citizens, and would not allow Great Britain to
exercise her asserted privilege toward a Briton who had become a citizen of the United States.

7. During nine months, in the years 1796 and 1797, Mr. King, the American minister in London, had
made application for the release of 271 seamen, (a greater portion of whom were Americans), who had
been seized on the false charge of being deserters, and pressed into the British service. '

the British service, and had deserted.

12. This outrage aroused tl1e nation and provoked retaliatory measures. The
president issued a proclamation in July [1807], ordering all British armed ves-
sels to leave the Waters of the United States immediately, and forbidding any to
enter, until full satisfaction for the recent insult, and security against future ag-
gressions, should be made; Diplomacy, which is seldom honest, was immedi-
ately employed to mistify. the plain question of law and right ,1 and, in the
Ineanvvliile, France and England continued to. play their desperate commercial
game, unmindful of the interests of other nations, or the obligations of international‘

' law. A British order in council? was issued on the 11th of November 1807, forbid-

ding neutral nations to trade With France or her allies, excepting upon pay-
ment of a tribute to Great Britain. Napoleon retaliated by issuing [Dec..17] a
decree at Milan, forbidding all trade with England or her colonies; and author-
izing the conﬁscation of any vessel found in his ports, which had submitted to
English search, or paid the exacted tribute. When the American Congress met
[Dec. 22], that body decreed an embargo, which detained all vessels, American
and foreign, in our ports; and ordered American Vessels abroad to return home
immediately, that the seamen might be trained for the inevitable War. Thus
the chief commerce of the World Was brought to a full stop. "

13. The embargo was a Very unpopular measure With the commercial people
of the United States, for it spread ruin throughout the shipping interest. It
Wasdenounced, also, by the Federal party; and as it failed to obtain from Eng-
la.nd and France, any acknowledgment of American rights, it was repealed on
the 1st of March, 1809,‘ three days before Mr. Jefferson retired from office.
Congress, at the same time, passed [March 1, 1809] a law which forbade all
commercial intercourse with France and England, until the “orders in council”
and the “ decrees”3 should be repealed. '

ate satisfaction for the outrage, and security against similar events, in future. Great Britain thereupon
despatched an envoy extraordinary to the United States, to settle the diﬂiculty in question. The envoy
would not enter into negotiations until the president should withdraw his proclamation, and so the mat-
ter stood until November, 1811 (more than four years), when the British government declared the attack
on the Chesapeake to have been unauthorized, and promised pecuniary aid to the families of those who
were killed, at that time. But Britain would not relinquish the right of search, and so a cause for quar-
rel remained.

5. James Madison was born in Virginia, in 1751. He was a member of the Continental Congress and
one of the chief supporters [note 1, p. 243] of the Federal Constitution. He Was a vigorous and volumi-
nous political writer. He retired from public life in 1817, and died in 1836.

retary of State during the whole administra-
tion of Mr. Jefferson, and was familiar with
every event which had contributed to pro-
duce the existing hostile relations between
the United States and Great Britain. His
cabinet1 was composed of able men; and in
the eleventh Congress,2 which convened on
the 22d of May, 1809, in consequence of the
critical state of affairs, there was a majority
of his political friends. Yet there was a
powerful party in the country (the Federal-
ists)3hostile to his political creed, and op-
posed to a war with England, which now
seemed probable. .

2. Light beamed upon the .future at the
beginning of Madison’s administration, but
it proved deceitful. Mr. Erskine, the Brit-
ish minister, assured the President, that
such portions of the orders in council4 as af-
fected the United States, should be repealed
by the 10th of June. He also assuredlhim
that a special envoy would soon arrive, to
settle all matters in dispute between the
two governments. Supposing the minister
to be authorized to make these assurances,
the president, as empowered by Congress,
issued a proclamation [April 19, 1809], per-
mitting a renewal of commercial intercourse
with Great Britain, on that day. But the
government disavowed Erskine’s act, and
the president again proclaimed [Aug. 10]
non-intercourse- This event caused great
resentment in the public mind; and had the MADISON AND ms RESIDENCE,
president then declared war against Great
Britain, it would doubtless have been very popular.

3. Causes for irritation between the two governments continually increased,
and, for a time, political intercourse was suspended. France, too, continued its
aggressions. On the 23d of March, 1810, Bonaparte issued a decree at Rambouil-
let, more destructive in its operations to American commerce, than any meas-
ures hitherto employed.5 Three months later [May, 1810], Congress offered to
resume commercial intercourse with either France or England, or both, on con-
dition that they should repeal their obnoxious orders and decrees, before the 3d

-of March, 1811.6 The French emperor feigned compliance, and by giving as-

tial remuneration has since been obtained [note 1, p. 291]. Bonaparte justified this decree by the plea
that it was made in retaliation for the American‘ decree of non-intercourse. Verse 12, p. 258

Were prosecuted with untiring zeal. Popular belief pictured an impassable re-
gion of tire beyond Cape Bajador, on the coast of Africa; but bold navigators,
under the auspices of prince Henry of Portugal, soon penetrated that dreaded
latitude, crossed the torrid zone, and, going around the southern extremity of
Africa,1 opened a pathway to the East, through the Indian ocean.
2. Lisbon soon became a point of great at-
traction to the learned and adventurous.
Among others came Christopher Columbus, the
son of a Wool-carder of Genoa, a mariner of
. great experience and considerable repute, and
then in the prime of life. The rudiments of
geometry, Which he learned in the university
of Pavia, had been for years Working out a
magniﬁcent theory in his mind, and he came to
Lisbon to seekan opportunity to test its truth.
3. ‘While in Lisbon, Columbus loved and
married the daughter of Palestrello, a deceased
navigator of eminence, and he became possessed
of nautical papers of great value. They poured
- new light upon his mind. His convictions re-

1‘ev_ea1éd,,aSsumed the character of demonstrated realities. He Was convinced
tliat--Asia could be reached much sooner by sailing. Westward, than by going
aroun-d:;'*the Cape of Good Hope?

 

4.. -Columbus Was.imbued With a deep religious sentiment, and he became.

strongly impressed With the idea thatthere Were people‘ beyond the Waste of
Waters WestWa.rd, unto Whom he Was commissioned by Heaven to carry the
G'ospel.3~ VVit-h the lofty aspirations Which his theory and his faith gave him, he
prosecuted his plans _With great ardor. He made a voyage to Iceland, and sailed
a hundred leagues beyond, to the ice-ﬁelds of the polar circle. He probably
heard, there, vague traditions of the early voyages to a Western continent,4
which gave strength to his own convictions; and on his return, he laid his plans
ﬁrst before his countrymen, the Genoese,(Who rejected them), and then before
the monarchs of England5 and Portugal.

5. King John of Portugal appeared_to comprehend the grand idea of Colum-
bus, but it was too lofty for the conceptions of his council and the Wise men of
Lisbon. "For a long time Columbus was annoyed by delays on the part of those

of some of the host portions of Gaul. They ﬁnally invaded the British Islands, and placed Canute upon
the throne of Alfred. It was among these peoplethat chivalry, as an institution, originated ; and back

surance [August] that such repeal should take effect in November, caused the
president to proclaim such resumption of intercourse. But American vessels
continued to be seized by French cruisers, and conﬁscated; and in March, 1811,
Napoleon declared the decrees of Berlin1 and Milan2 to be the fundamental
laws of his empire. _

4. Great Britain acted more honorably though wickedly. She continued her
hostile orders, and sent ships of war to cruise near the principal ports of the
United States, to intercept American merchant vessels and send them to England
as lawful prizes. While engaged in this nefarious business, the British sloop of
war,3 Little Belt, captain Bingham, was met [April 1.6, 1811] of the coast of
Virginia by the American frigate President, commodore Rogers.4 That 0%-
cer hailed the commander of the sloop, .and received a cannon shot in reply. A
brief action ensued, when captain Bingham, after having eleven men killed and
twenty-one wounded, gave a satisfactory answer . to Rogers. The conduct of
both officers was approved by their respective governments.5

5. During 1811, events occurred ‘which led to a declaration of war against
Great Britain, by the United States.“ It had been evident, for a long time, that
British einissaries were exciting the western Indians against the Americans;
and in the Spring of 1811, it became certain that Tecumseh, a .Shawnee7 chief,
who possessed the qualities of a great leader, almost equal to those of Pontiac,3
was endeavoring to emulate that great Ottawa. by confederating the tribes of
the north-west, in a war against the people of the United States. During the
Summer [1811] the frontier settlers, became so alarmed, that general I-Iarrison,9
then governor of the Indiana Territory,” marched, with a considerable force, to-
Ward the town of the Prophet, an intluentialbrother of Tecumseh,“ situated
at the junction of the Tippecanoe and Wabash rivers}? The Prophet appeared
and proposed a conference, but Harrison, suspecting treachery, caused his sol-
diers to sleep on their arms [N 0v. 6, 1811] that night. At four o’clock the next
morning [N ov. '7] the savages fell upon the American camp, but after a bloody
battle until dawn, the Indians were repulsed. The battle of Tippecanoewas
one of the most desperate ever fought with the Indians, and the loss was heavy
on both sides. Tecumseh was not present on this occasion, and it is said the
Prophet took no part in the engagement.

6. N ow, throughout the entire V_Vest, and in the Middle and Southern States,
there Was a desire for war. Yet the administration fully appreciated the deep
responsibility involved in such a step; and having almost the entire body of the

crnment should not do the same within three months thereafter, then the first should enjoy commercial
intercourse with the United States, but the other should not.

5. Powerful as was the navy of Great Britain and weak as was that of the United States, the latter
was willing to accept of war as an alternative or submission, and to measure strength on the ocean.
The British navy consisted of almost nine hundred vessels, with an aggregate of one hundred and forty-
four thousand men. The American vessels of war, of large size, numbered only twelve, with an aggre-
gate of about three hundred guns. Besides these, there were a great number of gun -boats [note 4, p.
257 It must be remembered, however, that the British navy was necessarily very much scattered, for
that government had interests to protect in various parts of the globe.

both sides of the Wabash. The Prophet was present and made no objection ; but Tecumseh, who was

him and his people against the Americans. A

New Englandpeople in opposition, they hesitated. The British orders in coun-
cil were rigorously enforced; insult afterinsult was offered to the American ﬂag ;
and the British press insolently boasted that the United States “could not be
kicked into a war.” Forbearance became no longer-a virtue, and on the 4th of’
April, 1812, Congress laid another embargo-1 upon vessels in American waters,
for ninety days. In June, the president, by’ the authority‘ of Congress‘? issued
a proclamation which formally declared war against Great Britain.3 This is
known in history as THE WAR OF 1812 ; or

THE SECOND WAR son INDEPENDENCES1

7. Congress passed an act which gave the Presi-
dent authority to enlist twenty-ﬁve thousand men,
to accept ﬁfty thousand volunteers, and to call out
one hundred thousand militia for the defense of the
sea-coast and frontiers. Henry Dearborn,5 an oiﬁcer
of the Revolution, was appointed major-general and
commander-in-chief; and his principal brigadiers
were James Wilkinson,5 Wade Hampton,7 William
Hull8 and Joseph Bloomﬁeld, all of them esteemed
soldiers of the Revolution.

8. General Hull was governor of Michigan; and
when war was declared, he was marching with two , ,
thousand troops from, Ohio, to attempt the subjuga- , ,
tion of the hostile Indians.9 Congress authorized him .
to invade Canada; and on the 12th of July, 1812, he GENERAL DEARBORN,
crossed the Detroit River with his whole force, to at-
tack. Fort Malden, a British post near the present village of Amherstburg. At
Sandwich, he encamped, and by a fatal delay, lost every advantage which an
immediate attack might have" secured. ' In the meanwhile, Fort Mackinaw, one
of the strongest posts of » the United States in the north-west, was surprised
and captured [July 17, 1812] by an allied force of British and Indians; and on
the 5th of August, a detachment under major Van Horne, sent by Hull to escort
an approaching supply—party to camp, were defeated by some British and

2. On the 4th of J une, 1812, a bill, drawn up by Mr. Pinckney, and presented by Mr. Calhoun, declar-

ing war to exist between the United States and Great Britain, passed the House of Representatives by a
vote of 79 to 49. On the 17th it passed the Senate by a vote of 19 to 13, and on that day received the sig-
nature of the president. He issued his war manifesto two days afterward. _
r 3. The chief causes for this act were the impressment of American seamen by the British ; the block-
ade of French ports without an adequate force to sustain the act; and the British Orders in Council.
The Federalists in Congress presented an ably-written protest, which denied the necessity or the expe-
diency of war.

4. -This is an appropriate title, for, until .the termination of that war, the United States were only nomi-
nally free. Blessed with prosperity, the people dreaded war, and submitted to many acts of tyranny
and insult from Great Britain and France, rather than become involved in another conflict. Socially
and commercially, the United States were dependent upon Europe, and especially upon England ; and
the latter was rapidly acquiring a dangerous political influence here, when the war broke out. The war
begun in 1775, was really only the first great step toward independence ; the war begun in 1812, ﬁrst thor-
oughly accomplished it. Franklin once heard a person speaking of the Revolution as the ﬁrm" of _Inde-
pendence, and reproved him saying, “Sir, you mean the Revolution; the war of Independence 1s yet
to come. It was a war for Independence, but not of Independence.” _

, 5. Henry Dearborn was a native of New Hampshire, and ameritorious oﬁicer in the continental army.
He accompanied Arnold to Quebec, and was distinguished in the battles which ruined Burgoyne [verse
23, p. 205]. He held civil olﬁces of trust after the Revolution. He returned to private life 111 1815, and
died at Roxbury, near Boston, in 1829, at the age of seventy-eight years. _

Indians near Brownstown, on the Huron river.‘ These events, and the rein-
forcement of the garrison at Malden by general Brock, the British commander-
in—chief, caused Hull to recross [August 7] the river, abandon the expedition
aga.inst Canada, and take -post at Detroit, much to the disappointment of l1is
troops. V .

_9. Brock followed [Aug 9], and crossed the river with seven_hundred British
troopsand six hundred Indians. He demanded an instant surrender of Detroit,
and threatened to "give free rein to _Indian cruelty, in the event of refusal.
Hull’s excessive prudence, amounting, in this instance, to practical cowardice,
determined him to surrender, rather than expose his troops to the hatchet.
VV hen the assailants approached, and at the moment when the Americans were
hoping for and expecting’ a command to ﬁre, he ordered his troops to retire
within the fort, and hung a white ﬂag upon its wall, in token of submission.
The army, fort, stores, garrison and Territory, were all surrendered [Aug. 16,
1812], to the astonishment of the victor himself, and the deep mortiﬁcation of the
American troops. Hull was afterward tried by a court-martial'2 [1814], on
charges of treason and cowardice. He was found guilty of the latter, and sen-
tenced to be shot, but was pardoned by the president on account of his revolu-
tionary services. The whole country severely censured him; but the sober
judgment of this generation, guided by historic truth, mustiacquit him of all
crime, and pity him as a victim of untoward circumstances.3

10. While these misfortunes were befallingthe Army of the North-west,4 the
opponents of the war were casting obstacles in the way of the other divisions of
the American troops operating in the State of New York. The British Govern-
ment declared the whole American coast in a state of . blockade, except that of
the New England States, whose apparent sympathy with the enemies of their
country, caused them to be regarded as ready to leave the Union, and become
subject to the British crown. But there was sterling patriotism sufﬁcient there
to prevent such a catastrophe. ’ ‘ _

11. Un-mindful of the intrigues of its foes, the administration persevered; and
during the Summer of 1812, a plan was matured for invading Canada on the
Niagarafrontier. ~ British troops were strongly posted on the heights of Queens-
town,‘ ‘opposite Lewiston; and on the morning of the 13th of October, two hun-
dred and twenty-ﬁve men, under colonel Solomon Van Rensselaer, crossed over
to attack, them. ' The commander was severely wounded, at the landing; but his
troops pressed forward, under captains Wool5 and Ogilvie, successfully assaulted
a- battery nea_r the 1 summit of the hill, and gained possession’ of Queenstown

Heights. ; ‘

1. Onthe 8th, colonel Miller and several hundred men sent by Hull to accomplish the object of Van
Horne, met and defeated Tecumseh [verse 5, p. 260] and his Indians, with a partyof British, near the
scene of I-Iorne’s failure. .

2. He was taken to Montreal a prisoner, and was afterward exchanged for thirty British captives. He
was tried at Albany, New York.

3. In 1848, his grandson published a full and thorough vindication of the character of general Hull,
the. material for which was drawn from official records. The general?s thorough knowledge of the

character of the foe who menaced him, and a humane desire to spare his troops, was doubtless his sole‘

reason for surrendering the post.’ A good and brave man has too long suﬂered the reproaches of his-
tory. William Hull was born in Connecticut in 1753. He rose to the rank of major in the continental
army, and was distinguished for his bravery. He was appointed‘ governor of the_ Michigan Territory,
[verse 6, p. 255] in 1805. After the close of his unfortunate campaign, he never appeared in public life.
He died near Boston in 1825.

4. The forces under general Harrison were called the Arm.:z/ of the Northwest; those under general
Stephen Van Rensselaer, at Lewiston, on the Niagara river, the Army of the Center; and those under
general Dearborn, at Greenbush, near Albany, and near Plattsburg, the Army of the North.

12. At tl1e moment of victory, general Brock approached from Fort George,
with six hundred men, and attempted to regain the battery} I The British Were
repulsed, a.nd Brock was killed.2 In the meanwhile, general Stephen Van
Rensselaer, who had crossed over, returned to Lewiston, and was using his
most earnest efforts to send reinforcements; but only about one thousand troops,
many of them quite undisciplined, could be induced to cross the river. These were
attacked in the afternoon [Oct. 13, 1812] by fresh troops from Fort George, and
Were nearly all killed or made prisoners, While at least ﬁfteen hundred of their
companions in arms cowardly refused to cross to their aid. These excused their
conduct by the plea, that they considered it Wrong to invade’ the enemy’s coun-
try, the war being avowedly a defensive one; and the opponents of the war
applauded them for their conscientiousness.

13. General Van Rensselaer, disgusted with the inefﬁciency everywhere dis-
played, left the service-, and was succeeded by general Alexander Smyth of
Virginia. This officer accomplished nothing of importance during the remainder
of the season; and when the troops went into winter quarters [Dec], there ap-
peared to have been very few achievements made by the American army .Worthy
of honorable mention in history. The little navy, however, had acquitted itself
nobly, and the national honor had been fully vindicated on the ocean.3 1 '

14. On the 19th of August, 1812, the United States frigate Constitution, com-
modore Isaac Hull,4 fought the British frigate Cacm*icvre,5 captain Dacres, off the
American coast, in the present track of ships to Great Britain. The contest
continued about forty minutes, when Dacres surrendered;6 and his vessel was
such a complete wreck, that the victor burned her. The Constitution, it is said,
was solittle damaged, that she was ready for action the following day. This
victory had a powerful effect on the public mind in both countries.

15. On the 18th_ of October 1812, the United States
sloop-of-war, Wasp, captain Jones, captured the Brit-
ish brig, Frolic, off the coast of North Carolina, after

dered. Decatur lost only ﬁve killed, and seven wounded; and his vessel was
very little injured. A few Weeks afterward [Dec. 29, 1812], the Constitution,
then commanded by commodore Bainbridgef became a victor, after combatting
the British frigate Java, for almost three hours, off San Salvador, on the coast
of Brazil. The Java had four hundred men on board, of whom almost two hun-
dred Were killed or wounded. The Constttutton was again? very little injured;
but she made such havoc with the Java, that Bainbridge, ﬁnding her incapable
of ﬂoating long, burned her [J an. 1, 1813] three days after the action.

17. These victories, greatly elated the Americans, while the numerous privat-
eers3 which now’ swarmed upon the ocean, were making prizes in every direc-
tion. It is estimated that during the year 1812, upwards of ﬁfty British armed
vessels, and two hundred and ﬁfty merchantmen, with an aggregate of more
than three thousand prisoners, and a vast amount of booty, were captured by the
Americans. At the close of the year, naval armaments were in preparation on
the lakes, to assist the army in an invasion of Canada. _

18. Mr. Madison was re-elected president of the United States in the Autumn
of 1812, with Elbridge Grerry,4 as vice-president, George Clinton5 having died at
Washington on the 12th of April, of that year. The re-election of Madison
was considered a token of approval of the war by a majority of the people of the
United States.

SECTION v.

THE SECOND WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE. [1813.]

1. The campaign of 1813, opened with the year, and almost the entire north-
ern frontier of the United States was the chief theatre of operations. The army
of the West,“ under general Harrison,7 was concentrating at the head of Lake
Erie; that of the Centre, now under Dearborn, was on the banks of the Niag-
ara river; and that of the N07“th,8 under Hampton, _was on the borders of Lake
Champlain. Sir George Prevost was the successor of Brock9 in the command
of the British army in Canada, assisted by general Proctor in the direction of

- Detroit,” and general Sheaffe in the vicinity of Montreal and the lower por-

tions of Lake Champlain.

2. Hostilities commenced in the West, where the greatest warlike enthusiasm
prevailed. Michigan had to be recovered, and the stain of Hull’s surrender”
obliterated. Volunteers gathered under local leaders, in every settlement}?
Companies were formed and equipped in a single day, and were ready to
march the next. Kentucky sent swarms of her young men, from every social

with the zeal of the old Crusaders [note 5, p. 27]. The leaders found volunteers everywhere, anxious
to ﬁnd employment against the foe. They were engaged for many weeks in driving the Indians from post
to post, in the vicinity of the extreme western settlements, and in desolating their villages and planta-
tions, after the manner of Sullivan [verse 14, p. 218], in 1779. Fierce indignation was thus excited
among the tribes, and led to terrible retaliations, under the stimulus of their white allies. s

3. Harrison chose the west end of Lake Erie as his
chief place of muster, with the design of making a
descent upon the British at Malden3 and Detroit,4
and by securing possession of those posts, recover
Michigan and the forts west of it. Early in Jan-
uary [J an. 10, 1813], general Winchester, on his
Way from the southward, with eight hundred young_
men, chieﬂy Kentuckians, reached the Maumee
rapids.5 There he was informed [Jan. 13, 1813]
that a party of British and Indians had concentrated GMERAL SHELBY.
at Frenchtown, on the river Raisin,6 twenty-ﬁve 7
miles south of Detroit, he immediately sent a detachment, under Colonels

 

Allen and Lewis, to protect the‘ inhabitants in that direction. Finding French- A

town in the possession of the enemy, they successfully attacked . [Jan. 18]. and
routed them, and held possession until the arrival of Winchester [J an. 20], with
almost three hundred men, two days afterward. ’ ’

4. Proctor, who was at Malden, eighteen miles distant, heard of the advance
of Winchester, and proceeded immediately and secretly, with a combined force
of ﬁfteen hundred British and Indians, to attack him. They fell upon the Amer»
ican camp at dawn, on the morning of the 22d of January. After a severe bat-

 tle and heavy loss on both sides, Winchester,7 who had been made a prisoner
by the Indians, surrendered his troops on the condition, agreed to by Proctor,
that ample protection to all should be given. Proctor,.fearing the approach of

Harrison, who was then on the Lower Sandusky, immediately marched -for Mal— -

den, leaving the sick‘ and wounded Americans behind, without a guard. ' After
following him some distance, the Indians turned back [Jan 23], murdered and
scalped‘3 the Americans who were unable to travel, set ﬁre to dwellings, took many
prisoners to Detroit, in order to procure exorbitant ransom prices, and reserved
some of them for inhuman torture. The indifference of Proctor and his troops,
on this occasion, was criminal in the highest‘ degree, and gave just ground for
the dreadful suspicion, that they encouraged the savages in their deeds of blood.
Oftentimes after that, the war-cry of the Kentuckians was, “ Remember the
river Raisin! ” ' - 4 ~ » »

with twelve hundred men, established a fortiﬁed camp there, and
called it Fort Meigs,1 in honor of the governor of Ohio. There
he was besieged by Proctor several weeks afterward [May 1],
who was at the head of more than two thousand British and
Indians.» On the ﬁfth day of the siege, general Clay arrived
[May 5] with twelve hundred men, and dispersed. the enemy.
A large portion of his troops, while unwisely pursuing the
fugitives, were surrounded and captured; and Proctor returned
to the siege. The impatient Indians, refusing to listen to Te-
cumseh,2 their leader, deserted the British on the eighth day
[May 8] ; and twenty—four hours afterward, Proctor abandoned
the siege and returned to Malden [May 9], to prepare for a
more formidable invasion.

. 7. _While these‘ events were in ‘progress, a new power appeared in the conﬂict
in the West and North. In the Autumn of 1812, commodore Chauncey had ﬁt-.
ted out a sma.ll naval armament at Sackett’s Harbor, to dispute the mastery on
Lake Ontario, with several British armed vessels} then aﬂoat. And during the
Summer of 1813, commodore Perry had ﬁtted out, on Lake Erie, an American
squadron of nine vessels, mounting ﬁfty-four guns, to co-operate with the army
of the West? The British had also prepared a small
squadron of six vessels, carrying sixty-three guns,
commanded by commodore Barclay. The hostile
ﬂeets met nearthe western extremity of Lake
Erie on the morning of the 10th of September
1813, and a very severe battle ensued. The
brave Perry managed with the skill of an old
admiral and the courage of the proudest soldier.3
At four o’clock in the afternoon, every British 
vessel had surrendered to him ,4 and before sun-

 The command of Lake Erie now being secured, and a reinforcement of
four thousand Kentucky volunteers under governor Shelby, the veteran hero of
Kings Mountain,5 having arrived [Sept. 17, 1813], Harrison proceeded to at-
tack Malden and recover Detroit. The ﬂeet conveyed a portion of the troops
across the lake [Sept 27], but on their arrival at Malden, it had been deserted
by Proctor, who was ﬂeeing, with Tecumseh and his Indians, toward the Mora-
vian village on the Thames. A body of Americans took possession of Detroit
on the 29th of September, and on the 2d of October, Harrison and Shelby, with
colonel R. M. Johnson and his cavalry (thirty-ﬁve hundred strong), started in
pursuit of the enemy. They overtook him [Oct. 5] at the Moravian town,
and eighty miles from Detroit,5 a desperate battle ensued. ’ Tecumseh was slain ,7
and then his followers, who had fought furiously, broke and ﬂed. Almost the

ron consisted of the same number of vessels, but mounting more than a hundred guns. Notwithstanding
this disparity, Chauncey attacked them near Kingston [note 2, p. 138] early in November, damaged
them a good deal, and captured and carried into Sackett’s Harbor, a schooner belonging to the enemy.
He then captured anotlfer schooner, whichhad $12,000 in specie on board, and the baggage of the deceased

3. The Lawrence, Perry’s ﬂag-ship, very soon became an unmanageable wreck, having all her crew,
except four or ﬁve, killed or wounded. Perry then left her, in an open boat, and hoisted his ﬂag on the
Nz'agara. With this vessel he passed through the enemy’s line, pouring broadsides, right-and left, at
half pisto,l1 slliot distance. The remainder of the squadron followed, with a fair wind, and the victory was
soon deci e . . ' A i ' '

4. The carnage was very great, in proportion to the numbers engaged. The Americans lost twenty-
seven killed, and ninety-six wounded. The British lost about two hundred in killed and wounded, and
six hundred prisoners. Perry’s treatment of his prisoners, received the highest applause. Commo-
dore Barclay declared that his humane conduct was sufficient to immortalize him. Oliver H. Perry was
born at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1785. He entered the service as midshipman in 1798. He continued
in active service after the close of the Second War for Independence, and died of yellow fever in the
West India seas, in 1819.

self narrowly escaped with a few of his cavalry.

9. By this victory, all that Hull had lost? was recovered; the Indian confeder-
acy-3 was completely broken up, and the war on the north-western borders of
the Union was terminated. General Harrison dismissed a greater portion of
the volunteers, and leaving general Cass4 with about a thousand regulars to gar-
rison Detroit, proceeded [Oct. 23, 1813] to Niagara with the remainder of his
troops to join the Army of the Center,5 which had been making some endeavors
to invade Canada. In the meanwhile, an Indian war had been kindled in the
South ;6 and on the ocean, the laurel wreaths of triumph won by the Americans
during 1812,7 had been interwoven with garlands of cypress on account of re-
verses. Let us turn a moment to the operations of the Army of the North.8

10. Unable to afford assistance to exposed posts between Sackett’s Harbor
and Ogdensburg,9 general Dearborn resolved to attempt the capture of York
(now Toronto), the capital of Upper Canada, and the principal depository of
British military stores for the supply of western garrisons. He embarked seven-
teen hundred troops on board the ﬂeet of commodore Chauncey,” at Sackett’s
Harbor, on the 25th of April; and two days afterward [April 27] they landed
on the beach at York, about two miles west from the British works, in the face

of a gallin g ﬁre from regulars and Indians, under gen-
eral Shea-ffe. These were soon driven back to their
fortiﬁcations, and the Americans, under general Pike,”
pressed forward, captured two redoubts, and were ad-
’ vancing upon the main work, when the magazine of
the fort blew up,12 hurling stones and timbers in
,. every direction, and producing great destruction of

on the 21st of February, and after a conflict of an hour drove out the few military defenders of Ogdens-
burg, plundered and destroyed a large amount of property, and then returned to Canada.

13. General Dearborn5 withdrew from active service in June, on account of ill
health, and was succeeded in command by general.Wilkinson.‘3 General Arm-
strong7 then Secretary of War, had conceived another invasion of Canada, by the
united forces of the armies of the Centre and N orth.3 For this purpose a little
more than seven thousand men concentrated at French Creek [Nov. 5, 1813],
and went down the St. Lawrence in boats, with the intention of co-operating
with about four thousand troops under 'Hampton,9. in an attack upon Montreal.
Being annoyed by the British on shore, and by gun-boats” in his rear, Wilkinson
la.nded Brown and a strong detachment to go forward and disperse quite a large
force near Williamsburg, and cover thedescent of the boats. A severe battle
ensued [N ov. 11], in which the Americans lost more than three hundred men
in killed and wounded, and the British about two hundred. This is known as
the battle of Chrysler’s Field.“ ‘ '

The last link that bound him to Portugal was broken, and, taking his little son
Diego by the hand, he departed on foot, to lay his proposition before Ferdinand

* 6. Poor and dispirited, Columbus arrived at the gate of the monastery of Rab-
ida, near the little port from whence he afterwards sailed, a.nd begged food and
shelter for himself and child. The good Father Marchena received him kindly,
entered warmly into his plans, and was of essential service to-him,‘ afterward.
Through him Columbus obtained access to the Court; but the war with the
Moors, then raging, delayed an opportunity for an audience"with the monarchs
for a long time. At length his importunities were heeded, and a council of the
learned men of the nation was convened at Salamanca, to consider his proposi-

tion.2 The majority pronounced his scheme vain and impracticable, and un-

-heathen of unknown lands. The last appeal

7. Still encouraged by*Father Marchena (who
had been Isabella’s confessor3), Columbus now
sought and obtained a personal interview with the

by a shorter way, and pleaded eloquently for aid

require the pawning of her crown jewels to ob- xslnmrm.
tain the money. _ -

8. Isabella was faithful ‘to her promise. She ﬁtted out two ca-rowels (light
coasting ships), and Columbus, by the aid of friends, equipped a third and larger
one. With this little ﬂeet, bearing one hundred and twenty persons, he left
Palos, on the Tinto river, in Andalusia, on Friday, the 3d of August, 1492, to
explore the stormy Atlantic!‘ ~

university, various dignitaries of the Church, and learned friars. They were all prejudiced against the
poor navigator, and he soon discovered that ignorance and bigotry would defeat his purposes. . _ .

honors. Also viceroy of all lands discovered. He was to have one tenth of all profits of the first
voyage, and by contributingan eighth of the expense of future voyages, was to have an eighth of all the
proﬁts. Although ‘Isabella paid the whole expense, the contract was signed, also, by her husband.

Two days later [Dec. 12, 1813] he was compelled, by the British, toabandon Fort
George. A strong force of British and Indians then surprised and captured
[Dec. 19] Fort Niagara;1 and in retaliation for the burning of Newark, they
laid Youngstown, Lewiston, Manchester (now Niagara Falls) a.nd the Tuscarora
Indian village, in Niagara county, in ashes. On the 30th, the little villages of
Black Rock and Buifalo werealso consumed, and a large amount of public and
private property was destroyed. Thus ended the campaign of 1813, in the
North. ~ =

15. In-the Spring of 1813, Tecumsehg went among the Southern tribes, to
arouse them to wage war upon the white people. The powerful 07"ce}’cs3 yielded
to his persuasions, and late’ in August [Aug. 30, 1813], a large party of them
surprised and captured Fort Mimms, on the Alabama river,4 and massacred al-
most three hundred men, women and children. This event aroused the whole
South. General Andrew Jackson,5 accompanied by ' general Coffee, marched
into the Creek country with twenty-ﬁve hundred Tennessee militia, and pros-
ecuted a subjugating war against them, with great Vigor. '

16. General.Ooffee,5 with nine hundred men, surrounded [Nov. 3] an Indian
force at Tallushatchee7 on the 3d of. November, and killed two hundred of them.
Not a warrior escaped. Within ten weeks afterward, bloody battles were fought
at Talladegas [N 0v. 8], Autossee9 [Nov. 29], a.nd Emucfauw [J an. 22d, 1814],
and several skirmishes had also taken place. The Americans were always vic-
torious, yet they lost many brave soldiers. At length the Greeks established a
fortiﬁed camp at the Great Horseshoe Bend of the Tallapoosa river,“ and there a
thousand warriors, with their women and children, determined to make a last
defensive stand. The Americans surrounded them, and Jackson, with the main

‘ body of his army, attacked them on the 27th of March, 1814. The Indians

fought desperately, for they saw no future for themselves, in the event of defeat.
Almost six hundred V.':.r:io:"s vrorc slC.i:1, for they disdained to surrender. Only
two or three were madeprisoners, with about three hundred women and chil-

afterward the chiefs of the remnant signiﬁed their submission.19f

17. There were many and severe conﬁicts on the ocean between armed ves-

sels of the United States and Great Britain, during the year 1813. Toward the

close of February, the United States Sloop of War,..Homet, captain Lawrence,
fought ‘[Feb. 24, 1813] the British brig, Peacoclc, off the mouthof Demarara river,
South America. The Peacock surrendered after a ﬁerce conﬂict of ﬁfteen minutes,
and a few moments afterward she sunk, carrying down with her nine British sea.-

men and three Americans. The loss of the Peacock, in killed and wounded, ’

was thirty-seven’; of the Hornet only ‘ﬁve.

18. Captain Lawrence was promoted to the
command of the frigate, Chesapeake, on his re-
turn to the -United States; and on the 1st of
June, 1813, he sailed from Boston harbor, in
search of the British frigate, Shannon, which
had recently appeared off the New England
coast, and challenged any vessel, of equal size,
to meet her. Lawrence found the boaster the
same day, about thirty miles from Boston light;
and at ﬁve in the afternoon, a furious action be-
gan. It lasted only ﬁfteen minutes ; but in that
time, the Chesapeake had forty-eight killed ‘and
ninety-eight wounded; the Shannon, twenty- ,. ,. .
three killed and ﬁfty-six wounded. Lawrence CAPTAIN LAWRENCE,
was among the slain,1 and his body, with that of
Ludlow, the second in command, was carried to Halifax, in the victorious Shan-
non, and there buried with the honors of war.2 This event caused great sad-
ness in America, and unbounded joy in England. . .

19. The loss of the Chesapeake was followed by that of the American brig,
Argus, captain Allen, in August. The Argus had conveyed Mr. Crawford,
United States Minister, to France, and for two months had greatly annoyed
British shipping in the English channel. Several vessels were sent out to cap-
ture her; and on the 14th of August, 1813, the sloop-of-war, Pelican, after a
brief, but severe action, defeated the Argus. In less than a month afterward
[Sept. 10], Perry gained his great victory on Lake Erie,3 and the British brig,
Bower, captain Blythe, had surrendered [Sept. 5, 18_13] to the United States
brig, Enterprise, lieutenant Burrows, after an engagement of forty minutes, off
the coast of Maine. Both commanders were slain, and their bodies were buried
in one grave at Portland, with military honors.

, 20. During the Spring and Summer of 1813, asmall squadron,‘ under admiral
Coekburn, carried on a distressing warfare upon the coast between Delaware
Bay and Charleston, with the hope of drawing the American troops fromthe
northern frontier, to thedefence of the seaboard. It was a sort of amphibious
warfare—-on land and water—and was marked by many acts of unnecessary

 

cruelty. The American shipping in the Delaware was destroyed in March, 1813,

andLewiston was cannonaded in April. In May, Frenchtown, Havre de Grace,
Georgetown and ]3‘redericktown, on the Chesapeake, were plundered and
burned; and then the British ﬂeet entered Hampton Roads,4 and menaced
Norfolk. ’While attempting to go up to that city, the British were nobly re-.
pulsed [J an. 22, 1813] by the Americans upon Craney Island,5 under the com-
mand of major Faulkner, assisted by naval ofﬁcers. The enemy then fell upon

1. The two vessels became entangled, when the British boarded the Chesapeake, and after a desperate
hand-to-hand struggle, hoisted the British ﬂag. Lawrence was mortally wounded at the beginning of
the action; and when he was carried below, he issued those brave words, which Perry afterward dis-
played on his ﬂag-ship on Lake Erie, “ Don’tg'£ve up the ship ! ” Captain James Lawrence was a na-
tive of New Jersey, and received a midshipman’s warrant at the age of sixteen years. He was with De-
catur at Tripoli [verse 4, p. 254]. He died four days after receiving the wound, at the age of thirty-one

years. 1 .

SECOND WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE, CONTINUED. [1814_——1815.]

1. Early in 1814., thevictorious career of Napoleon, in Europe, was checked
bypthe allied powers;4 British troops were withdrawn from the continent, and
fourteen thousand of Wellington’s veterans were sent to Canada-5 [1814] to oper-
ate‘ against the United States. Considering the moral and material weakness
of the American‘ army, hitherto, the circumstances of the continual employment
of the British troops on the continent, was highly favorable to the United States.
Had Europe" been at peace, the result of the second war for independenceb‘ might
have been quite different. . . ' ' .

2. The invasion of Canada7 continued to be the pet project of the public author-
ities; and to oppose it, was the. chief solicitude of the British oﬁﬁcers on our
northern frontiers. Toward the close of February, general Wilkinson broke up
his camp at French Mills3 and retired to Plattsburg; and general Brown, with
two thousand men, marched to Sackett’s Harbor. Late in March, Wilkinson
proceeded to erect a battery at Rouse’s Point; and at La Colle, three miles be-

andh107 guns. ‘ The'Essex carried at her mast-head,’ the popular motto, “Free Trade and Sailors’

3'?‘ Commodore David Porter was among the most distinguished of the American naval commanders.
He was a resident minister of the United States in Turkey, and died near Constantinople in March 1843.

4.’ Almost all continental Europe, with England, had new combined to crush Napoleon and sustain
the infamous Bourbon dynasty.‘ The allied armies, approaching from different directions, reached Paris

at the close of March, 1814, when the Russian and Prussian emperors entered the city. Hoping to se-,

cure the crown to his son, Napoleon abdicated in his favor on the 4th of April, and retired to Elba.
Believing peace to be secured, England withdrew many of her troops from the continent.

sequence of his repulse, he was tried by a court martial, but acquitted, yet
the chief ‘command _was taken from him and given to general Izard. . -

3. On the 5th of Maya British squadron, bearing aboutthreej thousand men,
‘appeared before Oswegofthen. defended by only_about three hundred troops un-
der colonel Mitchell, and a small ﬂotilla under captain Woolsey. The chief object
of ’ the expedition was to capture or destroy a large quantity of naval and military
"stores deposited at Oswego Falls,9 but the gallantbandof Americans_at the har-
bor defeated the project. They withstood an attack by. land and water for almost
two days, before they yielded to a superior force. Afraid to penetrate the coun-
try-toward the Falls, in the face of such determined opponents, the British with-

‘ drew on the morning of the 7th [May, 1814], after losing two hundred and

thirty-ﬁve men, in killed and wounded. The Americans lost sixty-nine’.
' 4. General Brown marched from Sackett’s Harbor3' to the Niagara frontier;
and on the morning of the 3d of July, generals Scott and‘ Ripley4 crossed the
river, with a considerable force, and captured Fort Erie.5 The garrison withdrew
to theintrenched camp of the British general Biall, then at Chippewa-,5 a few
miles below. On. the morning of the 4th‘ [July, 1814.-], Brown advanced, and
on the 5th_ the two armies had a sanguinarybattle in the open ﬁelds at Chip-
pewa. A The British were repulsed with a loss of.
about ﬁve hundred men, and retreated to Bur-

troops under lieutenant-general Drummond, who
assumed the chief command. ' The Americans lost
about three hundred. _' - f '

known by the respective names of Bwidgewater, I/Lmdy’s Lane, and Niagara, Falls.

the side of the British.

tions for a siege. He made an assault on the 15th,
but was repulsed with a loss- of almost a thousand
men. Very little Was done by either party, for nearly
_  a month, when general Brown, who had assumed com-
T”5°"‘°'“‘ « mand again, ordered a sortie [Sept. 17] from the fort.
It was successful; and the Americans pressed forward,
destroyed the advanced works of the besiegers, and
drovethem toward Chippewa. Informed,»soon after-
ward, that general Izard was approaching? with rein-
forcements for Brown, Drummond retired to Fort

Fort Erie in November [N 0v. 5], and crossing the river,
went into winter quarters at Buffalo, Black Rock and

7 ._ Very little of moment transpired in the Vicinity
of Lake Champlain until toward the close of Summer, when general Izard4
marched [Aug. 1814] from Plattsburg, with ﬁve thousand men, to reinforce gen-
eral Brown5 on the Niagara frontier, leaving general Macomb5 in_command with
only ﬁfteen hundred men. Taking advantage of this circumstance, general
Prevost, with‘ fourteen thousand men, chieﬂy Wellington’s veterans, marched for
Plattsburg. During the Springand Summer, the British a.nd Americans had
each constructed a small ﬂeet on Lake Champlain, and these were now ready
for operations; the former under commodore Downie, and the latter under com-
modore M‘Donough.7 ‘ ,  1 . .

8. Prevost arrived near Plattsburg on the 6th of September, when ,Ma_comb’s
little army, and quite a large body of militia under general Mooers, retired to
the south side of the Saranac, and prepared to dispute its passage, by the invad-
ers. On the morning of the 11th, the British ﬂeet came around Cumberland
Head, with a fair wind, and attacked M‘Donough’s squadron in Plattsburg Bay.
At the same time the British land troops opened a heavy cannonade upon the
Americans. After a severe engagement of two _hcur_s and twenty minutes,
iM‘Don'ough became victor, and the whole B1'itish'ﬂe;e.t’was surrendered to him.8

for an hour maintained a most desperate conﬂict, when he was reinforced. It was quite dark, and gen-
eral Riall and his suite were made prisoners by the gallant major Jesup. A British battery [note 5,

The land force fought until dark, and every
attempt of the British to cross the’ Saranac was _
bravely resisted. During the evening, Prevost
hastily retreated, leaving his sick and wounded
and a large quantity of military stores, behind -
him. The British loss in killed, wounded and
deserted, from the 6th to the 11th, was about
twenty-ﬁve hundred; that of the Americans,
one hundred and twenty-one. This victory was
applauded with the greatest enthusiasm through-
out the land, and gave emphasisi tothe -effect
of another at Baltimore, which: had been re-
cently achieved.1 ‘ ’

9. .While the . northern-frontier was.‘ the scene ~
of stirring military events, the sea-coast-was not OOMMOOORE M<OONOOOH,
exemptfrom trouble. The principal ports, from - ,
New York to Maine, were blockaded-by-British war— vessels; and earlyin the
Spring, a depredating warfare again? commenced on the? shores of the Chesapeake.
These were but feebly defended by a small ﬁotil_la,31.urider the veteran, commo-
dore Barney;4 and when, about the middle of-August, a British squadron, of
almost sixty sail, arrived in the bay, with siX:_tliou'sand troops under general
Boss, destined for the capture of Washington«cit—y,1it proved of little value.

10. Ross landed [Aug. 19, 1814] at Benediet',~’o'n the PatuXent,5. with ﬁve
thousand -men, and marched toward Washington-city.6 Barney’s ﬂotilla, lying

 

‘higher up the stream, was abandoned and burned, -and his marines joined the

gathering land forces, under general Winder. Ross was one of Wellington’s
most active commanders, and Winder had only three thousand troops to oppose
him, one - ha?If%bf whom were undisciplined militia. A sharp engagement took
place .-[Aug‘».I»‘24] at‘ Bladensburg, a few miles from Washington city, when the
militia<~fl’e‘d,"and Barney, ﬁghting gallantly at the head of -his seamen and—ma-
rine's,i7W‘a3s made prisoner.7 Ross pushed forward to Washington city thesame
day, burned [Aug. 24] the capitol, president’s house, and other public and pri-
vate buildings, and then hastily retreated [Aug. 25] to his shipping.

killed and Wounded, and a hundred and twenty taken prisoners. The president and his cabinet were

volved on colonel Brooke, Who continued to advance. A severe battle now com-.

menced, which continued an hour a_nd_ a_ quarter, when the_Americans fell back,
in good order, toward the city. ; In this engagement, the British lost about three
hundred men; the Americans onehundred and sixty-three.‘ Both parties slept
on their arms1 that night; and the following morning [Sept. 13], the British ad-
vanced asif to attack the city. '

12. The ﬂeet, in the meanwhile, had opened its bombs and cannons upon the

fort, whose garrison, under major Armistead, made a most gallant defence. The
bombardment continued most of the day and night, and no less than ﬁfteen hun-
dred bombshells were thrown. The people in the city felt in immediate’ danger
of an attack from the land troops; but toward the morning of the 14th, these
silently embarked, and the disheartened - and_ discomﬁted enemy withdrew?
This defence was hailed as an important victor . . - . ~ - -

13. During the Summer, the whole coast eastward from Sandy Hook,3 was
greatly annoyed by small British squadrons, which captured many American
coasting vessels,._and sometimes menaced towns with bombardment. Finally,
in August [l814], commodore Hardy appeared before Stoninigton, and opened a
terrible storm of bombshells and,rockets4 upon the town. . The attack continued
four successive days [Aug. 9-12], and several times land forces attempted to de-
bark, but were always driven back by the militia. . The object of this unprovok-
ed attack seems to have been, to entice the American forces from New London,
so that British‘ shipping might go up the Thames, and destroy some -American
frigates, then near Norwich. The expedient signally failed, and no further at-
tempts, of a‘ similar kind, was made on the Connecticut coast.

wh_ich completed their downfall, as anation,5 and the war at the South, was con-
sidered ended. But the commonenemy, favored by the Spaniards at Pensacola,
soon appeared. A British squadron,‘ cruising in the Gulf of Mexico, took pos-
session of the forts at Pensacola,_by permission of the Spanishauthorities, and
there ﬁtted out an expedition against Fort Bower (now Fort Morgan), at the en-
trance to Mobile Bay,7 then commanded by major Lawrence. Among the Brit-
ish land troops, on the occasion, were two hundred Creek warriors. The attack
was made on the afternoon of the 15th of September. The British were re-
pulsed, with the loss of a ship of war and many men. , , V ,

15. General Jackson held the Spanish governor of Florida responsible for the
act of giving shelter to the enemies of the United States. Failing to obtain any

He stormed [N 0v. 7, 1814] the town, drove the British to their shipping, and
ﬁnally from the harbor, and ma.de the governor beg for mercy and-surrender
Pensacola and all its military works, unconditionally. The British ﬂeet disap-
peared the next day [N 0v. 8], and the victor retraced his steps [Nov 9]. On
hisarrival at Mobile, Jackson found messages from’ New Orleans, begging his
immediate march thither, for the British in the Gulf of Mexico, reinforced by
thousands of troops from England, wereabout to invade Louisiana.

16. Jackson instantly obeyed the summons. j He found the people of New
Orleans in the greatest alarm [Dec. 2], but his presence soon restored quiet and
conﬁdence. " By vigorous, and even rigorous measures (for he declared martial
law’ [note 8, p. 129]), he soon placed thecity in a state of comparative security;1
and when the British“ squadron, bearing general Packenham and about twelve
thousand troops, many of them Wellington’s veterans, entered Lake Borgne, he
felt conﬁdent of success, even against such fearfulodds. .
- ' 17. The British ﬂeet f captured a ﬂotilla of American gun-boats in Lake
Borgneg [Dec. 14] ; and eight days afterward [Dec. 22], about twenty-four hun-
dred of the enemy reached the Mississippi, nine miles below New Orleans. An
American detachment, led by Jackson in person, fell upon their camp the fol-
lowing night [Dec. 23, 1814], but were repulsed, after killing or wounding four
hundred of the British. . The Americans lost about one hundred.

18. Jackson now concentrated his troops (about three thousand in number,
and mostly militia) within a line of , intrenpchments cast up four miles below the
city,3 where they ‘were twicecannonaded by the British, but without much ef-
fect. Finally, on the morning of the 8th of January, 1815, Packenham advanced
with his whole force, numbering more than twelve thousand men, to make a
general assault. Reinforced by about three thousand militia (chieﬂy Kentuckians)
Jackson now had six thou-_ ...- _ .

they lost only seven killed and six wounded, in this victorious battle. It was
the crowning victory, and last land battle: of moment, of the SECOND WAR FOR.
INDEPENDENCE. I 2* 5 z’-:.:. . _ ’

19. The victory at New Orleans madeithe country vocal with rejoicings, and
soon after, the proclamation of peace [Feb. 18, 1815] spread a smile of happiness
over the whole Union. As early as December, 1813, the British government
had sent overtures of peace to that of the United States.4 They were promptly
met by the latter in a conciliatory spirit, and commissioners were appointedby
the two powers to negotiate a treaty.5; ‘They met in the ‘city of Ghent, in Bel-
gium, in the month of August, 18’14§,!.=and"on the 24th of December following, a
treaty was signed, which both governments speedily ratiﬁed.

20. But during these negotiations’, the war, as wehave seen, was vigorously

prosecuted, and the opposition of the ' Fedemlvists grew more intense. It reached_

its culmination in December, when delegates, appointed by the several New
England legislatures, met [Dec. 15, 1814] in convention at Hartford, for the pur-
poses _of considering the grievances of the people, caused by -a state of war, and
to devise speedy measures for its termination. This convention, whose sessions
were secret, was denounced as treasonable, but patriotism appears to have pre-

- vailed in its councils, whatever mayhave been the designs of some. Its plans

for disunion or secession, if any wereiformed, were rendered abortive soon after
its adjournment, for on the 18th of February, 1815,ipe'ace was proclaimed by the
president, and then a day fornational tl1anksg'1v?i'ng.;:to"the Almighty, for the

21. The contest with England had but just ended, when the United States was
compelled to engage in a brief

WAR WITH ALGIERS.

As we have observed-,6 the United States had paid tribute to Algiers since
1795. Every year, as his ‘%“tIr"e“ii~gth increased, the ruler of that Barbary State
became more insolent,7 andﬁnally, believing that the United States navy had

 

1. While these operations were in progress on the Mississippi, the British ﬂeet had not been inactive.
Some vessels bombarded Fort St. Philip, below New Orleans, on the 11th of January, and continued the
attack for eight days without success. In .the meanwhile, admiral Cockburn was pursuing his de-
testable warfare along the Carolina and Georgia coasts, menacing Charleston and Savannah with de-
struction, and landing at obscure points to plunder the inhabitants.

2. During 1814 the war continued on the ocean, yet there were no battles of great importance. The
Peacock captured the British brig, Epervier, on the 29th of April, off the coast of Florida. The.Wasp,
captain Blakely, also made a successful cruise, but after capturing her thirteenth prize, disappeared,
and was never heard of again. Probably lost in a storm. The .President, commodore Decatur, was
captured off Long Island, on the 16th of January, 1815, and on the 20th of February following, the
Oonstitzotion, commodore Stewart, had a severe action with the British frigate, 6'3/axne, and sloop-of-war,
Levant, and captured both. Soon after this, the British brig, Penguin, was captured, but the proclamation
of peace now ended the war.

been’ almost annihilated by the British, he made a pretense for renewing depre-
dations upon American commerce, in‘ violation of the treaty. Our government
determined to pay tribute no longer, accepted the challenge, and in May, 1815,

‘commodore Decaturl proceeded With a squadron to the Mediterranean, to humble

the pirate. ..

22. Fortunately, the Algerine ﬂeet was cruising in the Mediterranean, in
search of American vessels. On the 17th of June [1815], Decatur met and cap-
tured the frigate of the Algerine admiral, and another vessel with almost six
hundred men, and then sailed for the bay of Algiers. Heimmediately demanded
[June 28] the instant surrender of all American prisoners, full indemniﬁcation
for all property destroyed, and absolute relinquishment of all claims to tribute
from the United States, in future. Informed of the fate of a part of his ﬂeet, the
dey2 yielded to the humiliating terms, and signed a treaty [June 30] to that effect.

23. Decatur then sailedfor Tunis,3 and demanded and received [J uly, 1815]
from the ba-shaw,4 forty-six thousand dollars, in payment for American vessels
which he had allowed the English to capture in his harbor. The same demand
on the same account, was made upon the bashaw of Tripoli,5 and Decatur re-
ceived [August] twenty-ﬁve thousand dollars from him, and the restoration of
prisoners. This cruise in the Mediterranean gave full security to American
commerce in those seas, and greatly elevated the character of the government
of the United States in the opinion of Europe. N ow was accomplished, during
a single cruise, what the combined powers of Europe dared not to attempt.

24. The eventful administration of Mr. tMadison now drew to a close, and

very little of general interest occurred, except the chartering of a new United

States Bank,“ and the admission of Indiana [December, 1816] into the Union of
States. In the Autumn of 1816, James Monroe, of Virginia, who was Madison’s
Secretary of War for a few months, was electedﬂpresident of the United States,
and Daniel D. Tompkins,7 of New York, vice-president.8

and discontent prevailed, and
several times his followers were
on the point of compelling him
to turn back. _

10. On’ the evening of the
11th of October, the perfumes
of ﬂowers came upon the night
breeze, as tokens of approach
to land. Yet they hesitated to
believe, for twice before they
had been mocked by other in-
dications of land being near?
But at dawn the next morning
their delighted eyes saw green
forests stretching along the hori-
. zon;' and as they approached,
they were greeted by the songs of birds and the murmur of human voices.

11. Dressed in scarlet, and bearing his sword in one hand, and the banner of
the expedition in the other, Columbus landed, with his .
followers, and in the midst of the gorgeous scenery and
the incense of myriads of ﬂowers, they all knelt down and
chaunted a hymn of thanksgiving to God. The natives
had gathered in wonder and awe, in the grove near by,
regarding the Europeans as children of their great Deity,
the -Sun.3 Little did they comprehend the fatal signiﬁcance
to them, of the act of Columbus, when he set up a rude
cross upon the spot ,where he landed, and took formal
possession of the beautiful country in» the name of Ferdi-
nand and Isabella.4 ‘

" 12. The land ﬁrst discovered by Columbus, was one of
the Bahamas, now known as Cat Island. The Navigator
named it San Salvador (holy Savior); and believing it to
be near the coast of farther India, he called the natives
Indians. This name was afterward applied to all the
«natives of the adjacent continent.’5

of the Americans, when Europeans came.

4. It was a common practice then, as now, for the discoverer of new lands, to erect some monument
and to proclaim the title of his sovereign to the territories so discovered. The banner of the expedition
borne on shore by Columbus, was a white one, with a green cross. Over the initials, F. and Y.
(Ferdinand and Ysabella) were golden mural crowns. T

2. The progress of the States and Territories west of the Alleghanies [note-3, p. 14] in wealth and pop-
ulation, is truly wonderful. Fifty years ago, those immense lakes, Ontario, Erie, Michigan. Huron and
Superior were entirely without commerce, and an Indian’s canoe was almost the only craft seenupon
them. fn 1853, the val_ue of traffic upon these waters and the navigable rivers, was estimated at
$552,000,000. See note 5, p. 324. Twenty years ago [1834_] there were less than ﬁve thousand white
people in the vast region between Lake.Michigan and the Paciﬁc Ocean; now [1854] the number is
probably two millions. Chicago was then a mere hamlet ; now [1854] it is a ﬁne city, with more than

ing to liberate the Floridas from the dominion of Spain? In November, 1817,
United States troops proceeded to take possession of Amelia Island, the ren-
dezvous of the pirates on the Florida coast, and the Galveston establishment
soon disappeared for Want. of support.

4. Another difficulty arose at about the same time. A motley host, composed
chieﬂy of Sevninole Indians,3 Creeks dissatisfied with the treaty of 1814,4 and run-
away negroes, commenced murderous depredations upon the frontier settlements
of Georgia and the Alabama Territory, toward the close of 1817. General Gaines-5
was sent to suppress these outrages, and to remove every Indian from the Ter-
ritory which the Creeks had ceded to the United States, in 1814. His presence
aroused the ﬁercest ire of the Indians, who, it was ascertained, were incited to
hostilities by British subjects, protected by the Spanish authorities in Florida.
Gaines was placed in a perilous position, when general Jackson, with a thousand
mounted Tennessee volunteers, hastened [Dec. 1817] to his aid.

5. Jackson marched [March, 1818] into Florida, took possession [April] of
the weak Spanish post of St. Mark, at the head of Appalachee bay,5 and,-sent the
civil authorities and troops to Pensacola.7 At St. Mark he secured the persons
of Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert C. Ambrister,3 who, on being tried [April
26] by a court martial, were found guilty of being the principal emissaries
among the southern Indians, inciting them to hostilities. They were both exe-
cuted on the 30th of the same month. Jackson afterward seized Pensacola
[May 24], captured the fortress of Barancas [May 27] at the entrance to Pen-
sacola Bay, and sent the Spanish authorities and troops to Havanna. . 1

6. General Jackson was much censured for this invasion of the Territory of a
friendly power, and his summary proceedings there. His plea,"in justification,
was the known interference of the Spanish authorities in Florida, in our domes-
tic affairs, by sheltering those who were exciting the Indians to bloody deeds;
and the absolute necessity of prompt and efﬁcient measures at the time. He
was sustained by the government, and the voice of thepeople. These measures
also led_ to the important treaty9 at Washington in February, 1819, by which
Spain ceded to the United States the whole of the Floridas, and the adjacent
islands, and that country was erected into a Territory in February, 1821. Gen-
eral Jackson was appointed [March, 1821] the ﬁrst governor of the neWly-ac_-
quired domain. .

der the Spanish yoke, rebelled, and forming republics, became independent of Spain. It was the policy
of our government to encourage these republics, by preventingrthe re-establishment of monarchial
power on the American continent. This is known as “ The Monroe doctrine.”

282 I THE GONFEDERATION.

‘a vast region of the remaining territory of Louisiana, extending westwardof that
state to the Paciﬁc Ocean, which was erected into the “Missouri territory” in
1_812, was formed into a territorial government [1819], and called Arkansas. In
December, the same year, Alabama was? admitted into the Union; and at the
same time, Missouri and Maine were making overtures for a similar position.
Maine was admitted in March, 1820,1. but the entrance of Missouri was delayed
until August, 1821, by a violent and protracted debate which sprung upbe-
tween the North and the South on the subject of Slavery, on account of the
proposition for its admission. '

8. During the session of 1818-—’19, a bill was introduced into Congress, Which

“contained a provision forbidding the introduction of slavery or involuntary ser-

vitude into the new Stateof Missouri, when admitted. Violent debates arose,
and the subject was postponed until another session. The whole country was
agitatedby disputes on the subject; and when it was again brought before Con-
gress [N ov. 23, A1820] angry disputes and long discussions ensued. A compro-
mise was ﬁnally agreed to '[Feb. 28, 1821], by which slavery should be allowed
in Missouri and in all territory south of thirty-six degrees and thirty minutes
north latitude (southern boundary of Missouri), and prohibited in all the ter-
ritory northerly and westerly of these limits. This is known as The Missouri?
0'0mpr0mt'se.9 Under this compromise, Missouri was admitted [Aug. 21, 1821],
‘and the excitement on the subject ceased. The confederation was now com-
posed of twenty-four sovereign States.3 '

9. During the pendency of the Missouri question, Mr. Monroe was re-elected
president [I820], and—Mr. Tompkins4 vice-president, by an almost unanimous
Vote, the old Federal party,5 as an organization, being nearly extinct. His ad-
ministration had been very popular, and the country was blessed with general
prosperity. Two other measures, besides those already noticed, received the
warmest approbation of the people. The ﬁrst was an act of Congress passed
-[March, 1818] in pursuance of Monroe’s recommendation, making provision, in
some degree, for the surviving officers and soldiers of the Revolution. It was
subsequently extended so as to include the widows and children of those who
were deceased. The other was an arrangement made with Great Britain, [Oct.
1818], by which American citizens were allowed to share with those of that
realm, in the valuable Newfoundland ﬁsheries.“

10. Very little of general importance, aside from the rapid progress of the

country in all its industrial and governmental operations, occurred during the
remainder of Monroe’s administration, except the suppression of piracy among .

the West India Islands, and the visit of general La Fayettegto the United States,
as the nation’s guest. In 1822, a small American squadron"destroyed more than

twenty piratical vessels on the coast of Cuba, and the following year the work \

was completed by a larger force, under commodore Porter.8

about eleven succeeding months, he made a tour of over ﬁve thousand miles,
throughout the United States. He was everywhere greeted With thewarmest
enthusiasm, and was often met by men who had served under him in the ﬁrst

were called upon to -select a successor
to Mr. Monroe. Four candidates, rep-
resenting the different sections of the A
Union,2 were put in nomination. The re-
sult was, that the choice devolved upon the
House of Representatives, for the second
time.3 That body chose John Quincy
Adams, president. ‘John C. Calhoun had
been chosen vice-president by the peo-
ple. The election and ﬁnal choice pro-
duced great excitement -throughout the
country, and engendered political rancor
equal to that which prevailed during the

5. John Quincy Adams, son of President John Adams, was born at Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1767,
and at the time of his death, his home residence was in the old family mansion, so long occupied by his
father. He was in public life in the service of his country from his youth, as legislator at home, and
minister abroad. He was a ﬁne scholar and sound statesman, and a warm-hearted philanthropist. He
died at Washington city, in 1848, While a member of the House of Representatives.

6. Henry Clay, Secretary of State ; Richard Rush, Secretary of the Treasury ; James Barbour, Secre-
tary of War : Samuel L. Southard (continued in oﬁlce), Secretary of the Navy 2 and William Wirt (con-

.Clay’s nomination. He hadbeen charged with defeating the election of g_eneral Jackson, by giving his
inﬂuence to Mr Adams, on condition that he should be appointed his Secretary of State. This, how-
ever, was only a bubble on the surface of political strife, and had no truthful substance. In the Senate,
there were twenty-seven votes in favor, and fourteen against conﬁrming the nomination of Mr. Clay.

domestic troubles, made the administration of Mr. Adams a remarkably quiet one,-
and gave the executive opportunities for adjusting the operations of treaties
with the Indian tribes, and the arrangement of measures for the promotion of those
greatstaple interests of the country, agriculture, commerce, and manufactures.
Discords, which the election had produced, excited the whole country during

Mr. 'Adams’s administration, with the agitations incident to excessive party zeal,
and bitter party rancor; yet the president,«thoroughly acquainted with all the
public interests, and as thoroughly skilled in every art of diplomacy and juris-
prudence, managed the affairs of State With a ﬁdelity and sagacity Which com-
mand our Warmest approbation. .

3. The most exciting topic, at the beginning of Adams’s administration [1825],
Was a controversy between the federal government and the chief magistrate of
Georgia, concerning the lands of the Creek Indians,-and the removal of those
aboriginals from the territory of that State. Governor Troup, impatient at the
tardiness of the United States in extinguishing Indian titles and removing the

' remnants of the tribes, according to stipulation,’ assumed the right to do it himself.

‘the ﬁftieth anniversary of the independence of the United States?

The United States took, the attitude of defenders of the Indians, and, for a time,
the matter bore a serious aspect. The difﬁculties Were ﬁnally settled, and the
Greeks? and 0/zer0kees3 gradually removed to the rich Wilderness beyond the
Mississippi.4 . ~

4. The ﬁftieth anniversary of American Independence, which occurred on the
4th of July, 1826, Was distinguished by a most remarkable coincidence. On that
day, and almost at the _same hour, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, expired.
They Were-both members of the committee who had framed the Declaration of
Independence,5 both signed it,5 both had been foreign ministers,7 both had been
vice-presidents, and then presidents of the United‘ States,»and both had lived
to a great age.3 These coincidences, and the manner and time of their death,
produced a profound impression upon the public mind. A

1. When .Georgia relinquished her claims to portions of the_Mississippi Territory [note 4, p. 280], the
federal government agreed to purchase, for that State, the Indian lands vyithin its borders, “ whenever
it could be peaceably clone upon reasonable ter1_rn.s.” The 0’7'ee7cs, Who, with their neighbors, the Chero-
7cecs,,rvere beginning to practise the arts of civilized life, refused to sell their lands. The governor of
Georgia demanded the immediate fulﬁlment oi the contract. He caused a survey of the lands to be
inade, and_prepared to disti-ibu_te them by lott_ery, to the citizens of that State. The federal government
interfered in behalf of the Indians, and a civil War was menaced. ,

" F-.*?3\\ 4. The great’Erie canal, in the State of New York, was com‘-
:  pleted in 1825. It Was the most important and stupendous public
_ improvement, ever undertaken in the United States. Its earliest
" T ‘ advocate was Jesse Hawley, Who, in a series of articles published
in 1807 and 1808, signed .Hercules, set forth the feasibility and
T great importance of such a connection of the Waters of Lake
Erie and the Hudson river. His views were Warmly seconded

ADAMS’S" ADMINISTRATION. 285

" 5. So peaceful and prosperous were the remaining years of Mr. Adams’s ad-
ministration, that public affairs present very few topics for the pen of the gen-
eral historian.‘ The most important movement in foreign policy, Wasthe ap-
pointment, early in 1826, of commissioners‘? to attend a congress of representa-
tives"of the South American republics,3 held at Panama [J une, 1826], on the
Paciﬁc coast. This appointment produced much discussion in Congress, chieﬂy

on party grounds. The result of the congress at Panama was comparatively

unimportant, so far as the United States Were concerned, and appears to have
had very little inﬂuence on the affairs of South America. .

6. It Was during the administration of Mr. Adams, that the policy of pro-
tecting home manufactures, by imposing a heavy duty upon foreign articles of
the same kind, assumed the shape of a settled national policy, and the founda-
tions of the Amemfcctn System,4 as that policy
is called, was then laid. It was very popular
with the manufacturers of the North, but the
cotton growing States, which found a ready
market for the raw material in England, op-
posed it. Atariff law, passed in 1828 [May
15], Was very obnoxious to the Southern
people.-5 They denounced it as oppressive and
unconstitutional, and it led to menaces of se-

           
 

               

rious evils, in 1831 and 1832.6 - ‘ A   ,

7. Another Presidential election was held 
in the Autumn of 1828. The excitement 
Was ver r great. throughout "the country, /‘ — T

for the friends of the candidates (Adams and
Jackson) had been long preparing for the con-
test. It resulted in the election of Andrew
Jackson for president, and John C. Calhoun’? JOHN G_ cALu0UN_

T 1. An event occurred in 1826, which produced great excitement througho_ut_ the country, and led to
the formation of a new, and for a time,, quite a powerful political party. William Morgan, of Western
New York, announced his intention to publish a_ book, in which t-he secrets of B ree. Masonry were to be
disclosed. He was suddenly seized at Canandaigua one eyeniiig, placed in a carriage, and was never
heard of afterwards. Some Free Masons were charged _with his murder, and the repprt of an investiga-
ting committee, appointed by the New York State..L_Legislatui'e, conﬁrmed the suspicion. The public
mind was greatly agitated, and there was a disposition to exclude Free Masons from oﬂice. An Anti-
Masonic party was formed, and its organization‘ spread over several States. In 1831, a national Anti-Mar
sonic convention was held at Pliiladelphia, and William Wirt, of Virginia, was nominated for the office of
‘president’ of the United States. Although the party polled a considerable vote, it soon afterward disap-

4. The illiberal commmercial policy of Great Britain, caused tariﬁ‘ laws to be enacted by Congress, as
early as 1816, as retaliatory measures. In 1824, imposts were laid on foreign fabrics, with a view to en-
courage American manufactures. In July, 1827, a national convention was held at Harrisburg, in
Pennsylvania, to discuss the subject of protective tariffs. . Only four. of theslave States sent delegates.
The result of the convention was a memorial to Congress, asking an augmentation of duties on several
articles, then manufactured in the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury-cal-led attention to the
subject in his report in December, 1827. Congress took up the matter, and a Tariff Bill became a law in
May following. V ’ , ‘ A

5. The chief articles on which heavy protective duties were laid, were woollen andlcottoii fabrics. At
that time, the value of annual imports of cotton goods from Great Britain, was about $8,000,000; that
of woollen goods about the same. The exports to Great Britain, of cotton, rice, and tobacco, alone (the
chief products of the southern States), was about $24,000,000 annually. Y. These producers feared a great
diminution of their exports, by a tariff that should almost wholly prohibit the importation of three mill-
ions of dollars worth of British cotton and woollen fabrics, annually.

thoroughly hated; and for eight "years he braved the ﬁerce tempests of party
strife,‘ domestic perpleXities,9 and foreign arrogance,3 with a skill and courage
which demands the admiration of his countrymen, however much they may
have differed with him in matters of nationa.l policy.

3. The claims of Georgia4 to lands held by the powerful Cherokee tribe5 of
Indians, lying within the limits of that State, were among the ﬁrst subjects of
general interest which occupied the attention of the president. Jackson favored
the views of the Georgia authorities, and the white people proceeded to take

possession of the Indians’ land. Trouble ensued, and civil war was again men-.

aced. In Ma.rch [March 30, 1832], the Supreme court of the United States
decided against the claims of Georgia; but that State, favored by the President,
resisted the decision. The difficulty was ﬁnally adjusted; and in 1838, general
Scott3 was sent thither, with several thousand troops, to remove the »Cherokees,7
forcibly, if necessary, beyond the Mississippi. Through the kindness-and con-
ciliation of Scott, they were induced to migrate peacefully. '

4. Another cause for public agitation appeared in 1832. In his ﬁrst annual
message [Dec. 1829] Jackson took strong ground against the renewal of the
charter of the United States Bank,8 as not authorized by the Constitution. Con-
gress decided that such an act would be both constitutional and expedient; and
at the close of 1831, the proper oﬁcers of the Bank petitioned for a renewal of
its charter. Long debates ensued; and, ﬁnally, a bill for re-chartering the
Bank, passed both houses of Congress.9 Jackson vetoed‘-0 it [July 10, 1832];

and as it failed to receive the support of two-thirds of the members of both_

Houses, the Bank Charter expired, by limitation, in 1836. The commercial
community, regarding a national bank as essential totheir ‘prosperity, were
alarmed; and prophecies of panics and business revulsions, everywhere uttered,
helped to accomplish their own speedy fu,lﬁl‘ment.,

_ 5. During the Spring of 1832, portions of some of the Western tribes,“ residing
in Winconsin,19 led, by Black Hawk,13 aﬁery Sac chief, commenced [April 1832]
warfare upon the frontier settlers of Illinois. After several skirmishes with

removabfie. Theentire number of removals made by all the preceding presidents, from 1790 to 1829, was

against the encroachments‘ of the Georgians during Adams’s administration, but in December, 1829,
they werecrushed, as anation, by an act of Congress. The Cherokees were more advanced in the arts
of civilized life than the Creeks. They had churches, schools, and a printing press, and were becoming
successful. agriculturists. .It appeared cruel .in the extreme to remove them from their fertile lands and
the graves of their fathers, to the wilderness 1 yet it was, doubtless, a proper measure for insuring the
prosperity of both races. But now, again, the tide of civilization is beating against their borders. Will"

were driven beyond the Mississippi. Black Hawk was captured [Aug. 1832],"

and taken to Washington city; and then, to impress his mind with tl1e strength
of the nation he had foolishly made war with, he was conducted through several
of the eastern cities. This brief strife, which appeared quite alarming at
one time, is known as the “ Black Hawk War.“ -

6. The discontents of the cotton-growing States, produced by the tariff act of
1828,‘? assumed the form of rebellion in South Carolina, toward the close of
1832. . An act of Congress, imposing additional duties upon foreign goods,
passed in the Spring of 1832, led to a State convention in South Carolina, in
November following. That assembly declared the tariff acts unconstitutional,
and, therefore, null and void. It resolved that dutiesshould not be paid; and
proclaimed that any attempt to enforce the collection of duties in the port of
Charleston," by the general government, would be" resisted by arms, and would
produce the withdrawal of South Carolina from the Union. To support this de-
termination, military preparations were immediately made, and civil war ap-
peared inevitable.

7. The crisis was promptly met_by president Jackson, in a proclamation [Dec.
10], which denied the right of a State to nullify any act of the Federal Government;
and warned those who were engaged in fomenting a rebellion, that the laws
of the United States would be strictly enforced by military power, if necessary.‘
This proclamation met the hearty response of every friend of the Union, of what-
ever party, and greatly increased that majority of the president’s supporters,
who had just re-elected him to the Chief Magis-
tracy of the Republic.3 The nulliﬁers4 of South
Carolina, though led by such able men as Cal-
houn-5 and Hayne,5 were obliged to yield for the
moment; yet their zeal and determination in
the cause of State rights, were not abated.
Every day the ‘tempest-cloud of civil commotion
grew darker and darker; until, at length,‘Henry,
Clay,7 a‘ warm friend of the American system,8
came forward, in-Congress [Feb. 12, 1833], with-a
bill, which provided for a gradual reduction of the
obnoxious duties, during the succeeding ’ ten,
years. This compromise measure was accepted
by both parties. It became a law [March 3], and
discord between the North and the‘South soon

3. Jackson was re-elected by a large majority, in November, 1832, over Mr. Clay, the opposing can-
ditate. Martin Van Buren, of New York, was elected Vice-President. « ' '

4. Those who favored the doctrine that a State might nullify the acts of the Federal government, were.
called nulliﬁers, and the dangerous doctrine itself was called nulliﬁcation.

5. Note 7, p. 285. Mr. Calhoun had recently resigned the office of vice-president of the United
States, and was one of the ablest men in Congress, He asserted the State Rights doctrine [verse 15. p. 89]
boldly on the ﬂoor of Congress, and held the same opinion until his death.

6. Robert Y. Hayne was one of the ablest of southern statesmen. The debate between Hayne and
Webster, in the Senate of the United States, is regarded as one of the most eminent, for sagacityand elo-
quence, that ever marked the proceedings of that body. '

7. Henry Clay was born in Virginia, in 1775. He became a lawyer at Richmond, and at the age of -

twenty-one, he established himself in his profession at Lexington, Ky. He first appeared in Congress,
as Senator, in 1806, and from that period his life was chieﬂy devoted to the public service. He died at
Washington city, while U. S. Senator, in 1852. '

8. In his annual message to Congress in December, 1832, Jackson recom-
mended the removal of the public funds from tl1e custody of the Bank of the
United States.‘ Congress, by a decided vote, refused to authorize the measure;
but after its adjournment, the President assumed the responsibility of the act,
and directed the Secretary of the Treasury to withdraw the government funds
(then almost $10,000,000), and deposit them in certain State Banks. The sec-
retary refused compliance, and wasdismissed from office. His successor obeyed
the president ;9 and in October, 1833, the act was accomplished. The effect pro-
duced was sudden and widespread commercial distress. The business of the
country was plunged fromthe height of prosperity to the depths of adversity,
because its intimate connectionwith the National Bank, rendered any par-
alysis of the operations of that institution, fatal to commercial activity. Tliis
fact conﬁrmed the President in his opinion of the danger of such an enormous
moneyed institution.

9. Intense excitement now prevailed throughout the country, yet the presi-
dent, supported by the House of Representatives, persevered and triumphed.’
The State deposite banks loaned freely, confidence was gradually restored, and
apparent generalprosperity3 returned. Now, after thelapse of twenty years, the
wisdom and forecaste of general Jackson, evinced by his hostility to, and dis-
trust of, the United States Bank, appears to be universally acknowledged. The

necessity for such an institution is no longer admitted, and its dangerous power, if I

wickedly exercised, may be plainly seen.

1.0. Toward the close of 1835, the Semi-
nole Indians, guided by their head sachem,

leave their ancient domain, some of the chiefs in council made a treaty in May, 1832, and agreed to re-
move; but other chiefs, and the great body of the nation, did not acknowledge the treaty as binding. In
1834, the president sent general Wiley Thompson, to Florida, to prepare for a forcible removal of the
Seminoles, if necessary. 1 The tone and manner assumed by Osceola, displeased Thompson, and he put
him in irons and in prison for a day. The proud chief feigned penitence,‘ and was released. Then his
Wounded pride called for revenge, and fearfully he pursued it, as recorded in the next verse.

SPANISH VOYAGES AND DISCOVERIES. 29

Cuba and St. Domingo, where he was told of immense gold-bearing regions
in the interior. Impressed with the belief that he had discovered Ophvir of the
ancients, he returned to Spain, where he arrived in March, 1493.

14. Columbus was received with great honors,1 but considerations of State
policy induced the Spanish government to conceal the importance of his dis-
covery from other nations. This policy, and the jealousy which the sudden ele-
vation of a foreigner inspired in the Spaniards, depriyed him of the honor of
having the New World called by his name. Americus'F'espucius,9 a Florentine,
unfairly won the prize. In company with Ojeda, a companion of Columbus
during his ﬁrst voyage, Americus visited the West Indies, and discovered and
explored the eastern. coast of South America, north of the Oronoco, in 1499. He
published a glowing account [1504] of the lands he had visited,3 and that being
the ﬁrst formal announcement to the world. of the great discovery, and as he
claimed to have ﬁrst set foot upon the Continent of the West, it was called
AMERICA, in honor of the Florentine. .

15. Columbus made three other voyages to the West Indies,4 established
settlements, and in August, 1498, he discovered the continent at the mouth of
the Oronoco. This, too, he supposed to be an island near the coast of Asia, and
he lived and died in ignorance of the real grandeur of his discoveries. Before
departing on his third voyage, he was appointed Viceroy and High Admiral of
the New World. During his absence, jealous and unscrupulous men poisoned
the minds of the king and queen with false statements ‘concerning the ambitious
designs of Columbus, and he was sent back to Spain in chains. Isabella was
soon undeceived, and Columbus was allowed to depart on a fourth voyage.
When he returned, the queen was dead, his enemies were in power, and he
who had shed such lustre upon the Spanish name, and added a new hemisphere
to the Spanish realm, was allowed to sink into the _grave in obscurity and
neglect. He died at Valladolid on the 20th of May, 1506. His body was
buried in a convent, from whence it was afterwards carried to St. Domingo, and
subsequently to Havana, i11 Cuba, where it remains.

16. The larger islands of the West India group were soon colonized by
the Spaniards; and the peaceful, friendly, gentle and happy natives, were
speedily reduced to slavery. Their Paradise was made a Pandemonium for
them. Bending beneath the weight of Spanish cruelty and wrong, they
soon sunk into degradation. The women were compelled to intermarry

with their oppressors, and from this union came many of the present race of .

Creoles, who form the numerical strength of Cuba and other West ‘- India
Isla.nds.

1. Columbus carried back with him several of the natives, and a variety of the animal, birds and
plants of the New World. They excited the greatest astonishment. His journey from Palos to Barce»
Iona, to meet the sovereigns, was like the march of a king. His reception was still more magniﬁcent.
The throne of the monarch was placed in a public square, and the great of the kingdom were there to do
homage to the Navigator. The highest honors were bestowed upon Columbus ; and the sovereigns grant-
ed him a coat of arms bearing royal devices, and the motto, “ To Castile and Leon, Columbus gave a

new World.”

were the ﬁrst animals taken from Europe to America.

the settlers within their domain. Success made them bold, and they attacked
mail-carriers, stages, steamboats, and ﬁnally villages, in Georgia and Alabama,
until thousands of white people were ﬂeeing for their lives from place to place,
before the savages. General Scott was now in chief command in the South, and
he prosecuted the war with vigor. . The Greeks were ﬁnally subdued, and
during the Summer, several thousands of them were removed to their designated
homes beyond the Mississippi. . .

13. Governor Call, of Georgia, marched against the Seminoles with almost
two thousand men, in October, 1836. A detachment of upwards of ﬁve hun-

the savages in their swampy fastnesses, neither party could claim a positive

VAN i3UREN’s ADMINISTRATION. 291

14. President Jackson’s second official term was now drawing to a close.
Energy had ma.rked every step of his career as chief magistrate, and at the close
of his administration, the nation stood higher in the esteem of the world, than
it had ever done before.‘ Two new States (Arkansas [June 15, 1836], and
Michigan [Jan. 25, 1837]), had been added to the Union. The original thir-
teen had doubled, and great activity prevailed in every part of .tlie Republic.
In November, 1836, Martin Van Buren, of New York, was elected to succeed
Jackson in the presidential chair. The people having failed to
president, the Senate chose Richard M. p  . “P.
Johnson, of Kentucky, to ﬁll that station. ‘

" 15. The last ofﬁcial act of president J ack-
son, produced much excitement and bitter
feelings toward him. A circular was is-
sued from the Treasury department on the
11th of July, 1836, requiring all collectors
of the public revenue to receive nothing
but gold and silver in payment. This was
intended to check speculations in the pub-
lic lands, but it also bore heavily upon
every kind of business. The “specie cir-
cular ” was denounced; and so loud was the
clamor, that toward the close of the session
in 1837, both houses of Congress adopted a
partial repeal of it. Jackson refused to
sign the bill, and by keeping it in his pos-
session until after the adjournment of Con-
gress, prevented it becoming a law. J ack-
son now retired from public life, to enjoy that
repose which an exceedingly active career
entitled him to.

1. At the close of J ackson’s ﬁrst term, our foreign relations were very satisfactory, except with
France. That government had agreed to pay about $5,000,000, by instalments, as indemniﬁcation for
French spoliations on American commerce, under the operation of the several decrees of Napoleon, _from
1806 to 1811. The French government did not promptly comply with the agreement, and the President
assumed a hostile tone, which caused France to perform her duty. Similar claims against _Port-ugal
were made, and payment obtained. A treaty of reciprocity was made with Russia and Belgium, and
everywhere the American ﬂag commanded the highest respect. ,

2. Martin Van Buren was born at Kinderhook, New York, in December, 1782. He chose the profess-
ion of law. -In 1815, he became attorney-general of his native State, and in 1828 was elected governor
of the same, having served the country in the Senate of the United States. He was appointed minister
to England in 1831. Since his retirement from the presidency in 1841, Mr. Van Buren has spent a greater
portion of his time on his estate in his native town. He went to Europe at the close of 1853, _the first of
the chief magistrates of the Republic to visit the old world after their term of ofﬁce had expired.

the 4th of March, 1837} the business of the country was on the verge of a ter-
rible convulsion and utter prostration. The distressing effects of the removal of
the public funds [Oct. 1833] from the United States Bank,‘~’ and the opera-
tions of the “specie circular“ had disappeared, in a measure, but as the reme-
dy for the evil was superﬁcial, the cure was only apparent.

2. The chief remedy had been the free loaning of the public money to in-
dividuals by the State deposite banks ,4 but a commercial disease was thus pro-
duced more disastrous than the panic of 1833-334. A sudden expansion of
the paper currency was the result; and the consequence of such multiplied
facilities for obtaining bank loans were an immensely increased importation of
foreign goods, inordinate stimulation of all industrial pursuits a.nd interna.l im-
provements, and the operations of a spirit of speculation, especially in real es-
tate, which assumed the features of a mania, in 1836. A hundred cities were
founded, and a thousand villages were “laid out” on broad sheets of paper,
and made the basis of vast money transactions. Borrowed capital was thus di-
verted from its sober legitimate uses, to the fostering of schemes as unstable
as water, and as unreal in their fancied results as dreams of fairy-land.

3. Overtrading and speculation, relying for support upon continued bank
loans, was suddenly checked by bank contractions early in 1837,‘ and during
March a.nd April of that year, there were mercantile failures in the city of New
York alone, to the amount of more than a hundred millions of dollars.5 The
effects of these failures were felt to the remotest borders of the Union, and
credit and conﬁdence were destroyed.

4. Early in May, 1837, a deputation from the merchants and bankers of New
York, waited upon the president, and solicited him to defer the collection of du-
ties on imported goods; rescind the “specie circular;” and to call an extraor-
dinary session of . Congress to adopt relief measures. He acceded to the ﬁrst re-
quest, only. When his determination was known, all the banks in New York
suspended specie payments, and their example was speedily followed through-
out the country. The measure embarrassed the general government, and it was
unable to obtain gold and silver to discharge its own obligations. The public
good now demanded legislative relief, and an extraordinary session of Congress
was convened on the 4th of September. During a session of forty-two days, it
did little for the general relief, except the passage, of a bill authorizing the issue
of treasury notes, not to exceed in amount, ten millions of dollars!‘

5. The Semi7z0Zes7 still continued hostileﬁ‘ After severe encounters with the

Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury ; Joel
Navy ; Amos Kendall, Post Mas-
except Mr. Poinset, held their re-

1. He appointed John Forsyth, Secretary of State ;
R. Poinsett, Secretary of War ; Mahlon Dickinson, Secretary of the
ter-general ; and Benjamin F. Butler, Attorney-General. All of them,
spective ofﬁces under President Jackson.

2. Verse 8, p. 289. ' . 3. Verse 15, p. 291.

4. The State banks which accepted these deposites, supposed they would remain undisturbed until the
government should need them for its use. Considering them as.so much capital, they loaned their own
funds freely. But in January, 1836, Congress authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to distribute all
the public funds, except $5,000,000, among the several States, according to their representation. The
funds were accordingly taken from the deposite banks, after the 1st of January, 1837, and these banks
being obliged to curtail their loans, a serious pecuniary embarrassment was produced.

5. Fifteen months before [Dec. 1835] property to the amount of more than $20,000,000 had been de-
stroyed by ﬁre in the city of New York, when ﬁve hundred and twenty-nine buildings were consumed.

6. In his message to Congress at this session, the president proposed the establishment of an independ-
ent treasury for the safe keeping of the public funds, and their entire and total separation from bank-
ing institutions. This scheme met with vehement opposition. The bill passed the Senate, but was lost
in the House. It was debated at subsequent sessions, and ﬁnally became a law on the 4th of July,
1840. It is known as The Sub Treasury Scheme.

United States troops, several chiefs appeared in the camp of general Jesupl (who
was then in supreme command) at Fort Dade,2 and signed [March 6, 1837] a
treaty which guarantied immediate peace and the instant departure of the
Indians to their new home beyond the Mississippi. But the lull was tempora-
ry. - The restless Osceola3 caused the treaty to be broken; and during the Sum-
mer of 1837, many more soldiers perished in the swamps while pursuing the
Indians. At length Osceola, with several chiefs and seventy warriors, appeared
[Oct.- 21] in Jesup’s campunder the protection of a ﬂag. They Were seized and
conf1ned,;4_ and soon afterward Osceola was sent to Charleston, where he died
of afever, while immured in Fort Moultrie.5 This was the hardest blow yet
dealt upon the Seminoles; but they continued to resist, notwithstanding almost
nine thousand United States troops were intheir territory at the close of 1837.

'6. A large body of -Indians suffered a severe repulse [Dec. 25] on the north-
ern border of Macaco Lake,5 from six hundred troops under colonel Taylor.7
That officer succeeded J esup, and for more than two years afterward, endured
every privation in efforts to bring the war to a close. In May, 1839, a treaty
was made which -appeared _to terminate the ‘war; but murder and robberies con-
tinued, and it was not until 1842 that peace was ﬁnally secured. This war,
which ‘lasted seven years, cost the United States many valuable lives, and mill-
ions of treasure. . -

7 .- The peaceful relations between the United States and" Great Britain, were
somewhat disturbed by a revolutionary movement which commenced in Canada
in 1837, and at one time seemed to promise a separation of that territory from
the British crown.8 The movement was esteemed a patriotic effort tosecure
independence, and enlisted the warmest sympathies of the Americans in the
North. Banded companies and individuals, joined the “rebels;”9 and so gene-
ral became this active sympathy on the northern frontier, that peace between
the two governments was jeoparded. President Tyler ﬁnally issued [Sept. 25,
1841] an admonitory proclamation, 1.“ wliichiprevented further aggressive move-
ments, and quiet was restored. ’

1. Thomas S. Jesup was born in Virginia, in 1788. He was a brave and useful otlicer during the war
of 1812-’15, and was retained in the army. He was breveted major-general in 1828, and was succeeded
in command in Florida by colonel Zachary Taylor [verse 4, p. 299] in 1838. He is now [1854] a resident
of Washington city. ’ ~ - - ~

‘excuse was the known treachery of Osceola, and a desire to put an end to bloodshed by whatever means

he might be able to employ. - V

8. Both Upper and Lower Canada exhibited ‘revolutionary movements. The principal leader of the
revolt in Upper, Canada was William Lyon Mackenzie; the prime mover in the Lower Province, was
Louis Joseph Papineau. The movements of the Revolutionary party were Well planned, but local jeal-
ousies prevented unity of action, and the scheme failed. I I I » «

9. A party of Americans toolgpossession of Navy Island, situated in the Niagara river, about two miles
above the Falls, and belonging to Canada. They numbered seven hundred strong, well provisioned and
provided with twenty pieces of cannon. They had a-small steamboat named Caroline, to ply between
Schlosser, on the American side, and Navy Island. On a dark night in December, 1837, a party of roy-
alists from the Canada shore crossed over, cut the Caroline loose, set her on ﬁre, and she went over the
great cataract while in full blaze. ’ ‘

10. In 1838, general Scott was sent to the frontier to preserve order, and was assisted by proclamations
by the President and also the governor of New York. Yet secret revolutionary associations called
“ Hunter’s Lodges,” continued for two or three years. Against these, president Ty1er’s proclamation
here referred to, was specially directed. - ' » '

of Importance commenced in 1837 ? How was it esteemed? What can you tell of the sympathy of the

294 THE CONFEDERATKHL

8. While this excitement was at its height, long disputes concerning the
boundary.between the State of Maine and the British province of‘ New Bruns-
wick, ripened into armed preparations for settling the matter, by combat. This,

too, threatened danger to the peaceful relations -between the two governments. '

The president sent general Scott to the theater of the dispute, in the Winter of
1839, and by his wise and conciliatory measures, be prevented bloodshed, and
produced quiet. The whole matter was
ﬁnally settled, by treaty, on the 20th of
August, 1842.‘ -

9. Mr. Van Buren was nominated for. re-.
election in 1840. He was opposed by Wil-
liam Henry Harrrison of Ohio, the popular,
leader in the North-west in the war, of
1812.9 Never, before, was the country so ex-.
cited by an election,’and never before was
a presidential contest characterized by such
demoralizing proceedings. » The govern-
ment, under Mr. Van Buren, being held re-
sponsible by the opposition for the business
depression which "yet brooded over the
country, public speakers arrayed vast mass-
es of the people against the president, and,
general Harrison was elected by an over-
whelming majority, with John Tyler of Vir-
gnia, as vice-president. And now, at the
close of the ﬁrst ﬁfty years of the Repub-
lic, the population had increased from three
and a half millions of all colors, to seventeen
millions.

' 1. William Henry Harrison was born in Charles City county, Va., in February 1773. His father was
a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Young Harrison prepared to be a physican, but entered

the army as ensign in the United States artillery, 1n 1791. He was afterward appointed governor of _

Indiana Territory, and was very active during the‘war of 1812. At its close he retired to his farm on
the banks of the Ohio. He served in the national council, and was ﬁnally raised to the highest post of
hofnor in the nation. His last disease was pneumonia, or bilious pleurisy, which terminated his life in
a ew ays.

2. He then appointed Walter Forward, Secretary of the Treasury; John 0. Spencer, Secretary of
War; Abel P. Upshur, Secretary of the Navy; Charles A. Wicklilfe, Postmaster General; and Hugh
S. Legare, Attoruey-General. ‘' Mr. Tyler had the misfortune to lose three of his cabinet oiﬁcers, by
death, in the course of a few months. Mr. Legare accompanied the president to Boston on the occasion
of celebrating the completion of the Bunker Hill monument [map, p. 176] in June, 1843, and died there.
On the 28th of February following, the bursting of a gun on board the steamship Princeton, while on an
excursion on the Potomac, killed Mr. Upshur, then Secretary of State, Mr. Gilmer, Secretary of the
Navy, and several other distinguished gentlemen. The president and many ladies were on board.
Among the killed was Mr. Gardiner, of the State of New York, whose daughter the president soon after-
ward married. ’

4. This humane law accomplished a material beneﬁt. Thousands of honest and enterprising men had
been crushed by the recent business revulsion, and were so laden with debt as to be hopelessly chained
to a narrow sphere of action. The law relieved them ; and while it bore thus heavily upon the creditor
class, for a while..its operations were beneﬁcient and useful. When dishonest men began to make it a
pretense for cheating, it was repealed.

achieved. Two separate bills1 for that pur-
pose were vetoed? by the president, who,
like Jackson, thought he perceived great
evils to be apprehended from the workings
of such an institution. The course of the
president was vehemently censured by the
party in power, and the last veto led to the
dissolution of his cabinet. Mr. Webster3
patriotically remained at his post, for great
public interests would have suffered by his
Withdrawal, at that time.

administration was distinguished by the re-
turnof the U. S. Exploring Expedition;4

1832,‘? duties on foreign goods were to reach the minimum of reduction, at the

close of 1842, when the tariff Would only provide revenue, not protection to

mcmufactw/“es, like that of 1828.7 The latter object appeared desirable; and

by an act passed on the 29th of June, 1842, high duties were imposed on

many foreign articles. The president vetoed it, but another tariff bill, less ob~
jectionable, received his assent on the 9th of August.

6. The Rhode Island dilﬁculties originated in a movement to adopt a State
constitution of government, and to abandon the old charter given by Charles
the Second3 [1663], under which the people had been ruled for one hundred and
eighty years. Disputes arose concerning the proper method to be pursued in
making the change, and “these assumed alserious aspect. Two parties were
formed, known respectively as the “suffrage” or radical party; the other as the
“ law and order,” or conservative party. Each formed a constitution, elected a
governor and legislature,9 and ﬁnally armed [May and June, 1843] in defence
of their respective claims. The State was on the verge of civil war, and the
aid of Federal troops had to be invoked, to restore quiet and order. A free
constitution, adopted by the “law and order” party in November, 1842, to go
into operation on the ﬁrst Tuesday in May, 1843, was sustained and became
the law of the land.

years before, to explore the great southern ocean. It coasted along what is supposed to be an Antartic
continent, for seventeen hundred miles in the vicinity of latitude 66 degrees south, and between longitude
96 and 154 degrees east. The expedition brought home a great many curiosities of island human life, and
a large number of ﬁne specimens of Natural History, all of which are now [1854] in the Patent Office
building in Washington city. The expedition made a voyage of about ninety thousand miles, equal to
almost four times the circumference of the globe. —

and sentenced to imprisonment for life. The excitement having passed away, in a measure, he was re-
leased in June, 1845, but was deprived of all the civil rights of a citizen. These disabilities were removed
in the Autumn of 1853.

7. The country was much agitated during the last year of Mr. Tyler’s ad-
ministration by discussions concerning the proposed admission of the independ-
ent republic of Texas, on our south-west frontier, as a State of the Union.
The proposition was warmly opposed at the North, because the annexation
would increase the area and political strength of slavery, and lead to a war with
l\~Iexico.1 A treaty for admission, signed at Washington on the 12th of April,
1844, was rejected by the Senate [June 8]; but to the next Congress, the prop-
osition was presented in the form of a joint resolution, and received the con-
currence of both Houses on the 1st of March, 1845, and the assent of the presi-
dent on the same day. » ' ’

8. The subject of the annexation of Texas had an important bearing upon
the presidential election in 1844. It became more andjmore popular with the
people throughout the Union, and James, K. Polk, of Tennessee, who was
pledged in favor of the measure, was elected president [N ov. 1844], and George
M. Dallas, of Pennsylvania, vice-president‘. The opposing candidates were
Henry Clay and Theodore Frelinghuysen. The last important official act of
president Tyler2.was the signing [March 3, 1845] of the bill for the admission
of I+‘lorida- and Iowa into the Union of States. *

SECTION   XII.

POLK’S ADMINISTRATION. [1845—1849.]

1. The largest concourse of people ever before assembled at Washington city,
witnessed the inauguration of Mr. Polk3 on the 4th of March, 1845. His address
on that occasion clearly indicated that energetic policy which distinguished
his administration. On the day after his inauguration, he nominated his cabinet
officers,4 and the ‘Senate immediately conﬁrmed them.

1. Texas was a part of the domain of that ancient Mexico, conquered by Cortez [verse 23, p. 31]. In
1824, Mexico became a republic under generals Victoria and Santa Annahand was diyided into States
united by a Federal Constitution. _ (_)ne of these was Texas, a territory which was originally claimed by
the United States asa part of Louisiana, purchased [verse 2, p. 253] from France in 1803, but ceded to
Spain in 1820. In l821—’2, a colony from the United States, under Stephen F. Austin,‘ made a settlement
between the Brazos and Colorado rivers; and the Spanish government favoring immigration thither
caused a rapid increase in the population. There were ten thousand Americans in that province, in 1833.
Santa Anna became military dictator. and the people of Texas, unwilling to submit to his arbitary
rule, rebelled. A war ensued, and on the 2d of March, 1836, a convention declared Texas mdependent.
Much blood-slied occurred afterward, but a ﬁnal battle at San J acinto, in which the Texans
were led by general Houston, one of the present [1854] United States Senators from Texas, vindicated
the positioln the people had ’%akden, ?.I]1Jti tei‘min1ei8t;3g1 the strife. Texas remained an independent i"'e'public
until its a mission into our e ‘era nion in . ‘

2. John Tyler was born in Charles City county, Virginia, in March, 1790. He was admitted to col-
lege studies at the age of twelve years ; to the bar, as a lawyer, at the age of nineteen ; and was elected a
member of the Virginia legislature when only twenty-one years of age. He was a member of Congress
at the age of twent-y—six. ‘ He was made governor of Virginia in 1825, and afterward represented his
State in Congress. Since his retirement from the Presidency he has resided upon his estate, near Charles
City Court House, in Charles City county, Virginia.

3. James K. Polk was born in Mecklenburg county, North Carolina, in 1795. While he was a child,‘
his fat-her settled in Tennessee ; and the ﬁrst appearance of young Polk in public life, was as a member
of the Tennessee legislature, in 1823. Two years afterward, he was elected to Congress, and was almost
continually there until elected President of the United States. He died at his residence, near Knox-
ville, Tennessee, in June, 1849.

298 THE CONFEDERATION.

‘2.' The most important topics which

were the annexation of Texas, and the
claims of Great Britain to a large portion of
the vast territory of Oregon, on the Paciﬁc
coast.‘ The former demanded and received
the earliest consideration. On the last day
of his official term, president Tyler had sent
a messenger to the Texan Government,
with a copy of the joint resolutions of the
American Congress,'3 in favor of annexation.
These were considered by the Texan Con-
gress, and approved on the 4th of July,
1845. On that day Texas became one of
the States of our Confederation. -

3. This act, as had been predicted, caused
an immediate rupture between the govern-
ments of the United States and Mexico;3
for the latter claimed Texas as a part of its
territory,4 notwithstanding its independence
had been acknowledged by the United
States, England, France, and other govern-
ments. There already existed a cause for
serious disputes betwen the United States
and Mexico.-‘3 Ever since the establishment
of republican government [1824] by the
latter, it had been an unjust and injurious
neighbor. Impoverished by civil Wars, its
authorities ‘did not hesitate to replenish its

the Gulf of Mexico, or by conﬁscating the
property of American merchants within its
borders. The. United States government
reinonstrated in vain, until, in 1831, a treaty
was formed, and promises of redress were made. But aggressions continued;
and in 184.0, the aggregate amount of American property which had been
appropriated by Mexicans, was more than six millions of dollars. The claim
for this amount remained unsett1ed,6 when the "annexation of Texas occurred
[July 4, 1845], and peaceful relations between the two governments were sus-
pended. ’

1. This vast territory, between the Rocky Mountains and the Paciﬁc, had been, for some time, a. sub-
ject of dispute between the United States and Great Britain. In 1818, it was mutually agreed, that
each nation should equally enjoy the privileges of all the bays and harbors on that coast, for ten years.
This agreement was renewed in 1827 for an indeﬁnite time, with the stipulation, that either party might
rescind it by giving the other party twelve months’ notice. . Such notice was given by the United States
in 1846, and the boundary was ﬁxed. See verse 5, p. 299.

Spaniards, and exploring voyages from Cuba, St. Domin-
go and Porto Rico, were undertaken. The Eastern coast
of Yucatan was discovered in 1506; and in 1510, Vasco
Nunez de Balboa, with a colony, settled upon the Isth-
mus of Darien. This was the ﬁrst colony planted on
the American continent. Crossing the Isthmus in search
_ ,_,of gold, Balboa‘ saw [1513] the Paciﬁc Ocean in a south-
‘yérly direction from the top of a high mountain, and he
called it the South Sea. In full costume, a.nd bearing
the Spanish ‘ﬂag, he entered its waters and took
possession of the “seas, lands,” &c., “ of the South,” in
the name of his sovereign. I
18. FLORIDA was discovered in 1512 by John Ponce
de Leon, an old visionary, who had been governor of
Porto Rico. With three ships he sailed for the Ba.ha-
mas in search of a fountain which unlettered natives
_  and wise men of Spain believed to exist there, and
BALBOA, ‘ whose waters possessed the quality of restoring old age to
the bloom of youth, and making the recipient immortal.
19. On Easter-Sunday? the Pctsquas dc Fl07*es3 of the Spaniards, Ponce ..de
Leon, approached the shores of the great southern peninsula of the United
States, and landed [March 27, 1512] near the site of St. Augustine.4 The forests
and the green banks were laden with ﬂowers; and when, soon after landing,
Ponce took possession of the country in the name of his sovereign, this fact and
the holy day were regarded, and he called the beautiful domain FLORIDA. He
continued his searches for the Fountain of Youth all along the coast of Florida,
and among the Tortugas (Tortoise) Islands, a hundred miles from its southern
cape, but without success; and he returned to Porto Rico,-~’-‘an older if not a
wiser man. He soon afterward Went to Spain, where he remained several
years. . / A —
20. During Ponce de Leon’s absence in Europe, some wealthy owners of plan-
tations and mines in‘ ‘St. Domingo, sent Lucas Vasquez d’Ayllon, one of their
number, with two vessels, to seize natives of the.Bermudas, and bring them
home for laborers. It was an unholy mission. A storm drove the voyagers
into St. Helen’s Sound, on the coast of South Carolina, and they a_‘ncl1ored*[152O]
at the mouth of the Oombahee river. The natives were kind and generous;

and, judging their visitors by their own simple standard of honor, they unsus- ..

pectingly wentupon the ship in crowds, to gratify their curiosity. While be-
low, the hatches were closed, the sails were immediately spread, a.nd those free
children of the forest were borne away to work as bond-slaves in the mines of
St. Domingo. But the perpetrators of the outrage did not accomplish their
designs. One of the vessels was destroyed by a storm; and ‘almost every,‘pris-
oner in the other refused to take food, and died; The fruit, of this perﬁdy was a
feeling of hostility to white people, which spr_ea.d throughout the whole of the
Mobilian tribes,-'3 and was a source of much trouble afterward.’

That place had already surrendered‘ [Nov. 14], and being informed that Santa
Anna was collecting a large force at San Luis Potosi,‘3 he returned to Monterey,
to reinforce general Worth, if necessary. Worth was joined by Wool’s division,
near Saltillo, on the 2Otl1 of December, and Taylor again advanced and took
possession [Dec. 29] of Victoria.

18. The conquering Taylor was now compelled
to endure a severe trial of his temper and patriot-
ism. General Scott had arrived before Vera
Cruz, [J an. 1847], for the purpose of invading
Mexico from that point, and being the senior offi-
cer, he took supreme command. Just as Taylor
was preparing for a vigorous Winter campaign, he
received an order from general Scott,3 to send him
a large portion of his best oii‘icers and troops, to
assist against Vera Cruz, and to act thereafter
only on the defensive.4 Taylor was deeply mor-
tiﬁed, but instantly obeyed, and he and general,
Wool were left with an aggregate force of only
about ﬁve thousand men (only ﬁve hundred regu-
lars) to oppose an army of twenty thousand, now
gathering at San Luis Potosi, under Santa Anna.
They united their forces at Agua Neuva,5 twenty GENERAL SCOTT-
miles south from Saltillo, on the San Luis road,
early in February [Feb. 4, 1847], and weak as _he was, Taylor’ determined to
ﬁght the Mexicans, who were now advancing upon him. The opportunity was
not long delayed. .

19. The Americans fell back [Feb. 21] to Buena Vista,“ within eleven miles of
Saltillo, and there, in a narrow deﬁle in the mountains, encamped in battle order.
At about noon the next day [Feb. 22] the Mexican army approached within
two miles of them; and Santa Anna, assuring Taylor that he was surrounded
by twenty thousand troops, and could not escape, ordered him to surrender with-
in an hour. Taylor politely refused the request, and both armies prepared for
battle. There was some skirmishing during the afternoon;7 and early the fol-
lowing morning [Feb. 23] a terrible conﬂict commenced. It was desperate and
bloody, and continued until sunset. Several times the overwhelming numbers
of the Mexicans appeared about to crush the little band of Americans; and
ﬁnally Santa Anna made a desperate assault3 upon the American centre, com-

1. Commodore Connor, who commanded the “Home Squadron” in the Gulf, captured Tampico.
Tobasco and Tuspan were captured by commodore Perry, in October following.

2. Santa Anna was elected provisional president of Mexico, in December, and in violation of his peace
promises to commodore Connor, he immediately placed himself at the head of the army.

3. Winﬁeld Scott was born in Virginia in 1786. He was admitted to law practice at the age of twenty
years. Hejoined the army in 1808, was made lieutenant-colonel in 1812, and passed through the war
that ensued, with great honor to himself and his country. He was breveted major-general in 1814, and
was made general-in-chief of the army, in 1841. His successes in Mexico great-ly added to his laurels,
and he is now [1854] considered one of the greatest captains of the age.

4. The necessity for this order was as painful to general Scott, as it was mortifying to general Taylor.
Before leaving Washington, Scott wrote a long private letter to Taylor, apprizing him of this necessity,
girpressing his sincere regrets, and speaking in highest praise of the victories already achieved in

exico.

with instructions to conquer New Mexico and California. He left Fort Leaven- .

worth in June, and after a journey of nine hundred miles over the Great Plains
and among the mountain ranges, he arrived at Santa Fe, the capital of New
Mexico on the 18th of August. He met with no resistance ;5 and having taken
peaceable possession of thecountry, and constituted Charles Bent its governor,
he marched toward California. He soon met an express from commodore Stock-

about six thousand, quietly submitted. '

7. Robert F. Stockton is a son of one of the New Jersey signers of the Declaration of Independence.

He entered the navy in 1811, and was appointed commodore in 1838. He left the navy in May, 1850,

and is now [1854] a member of the of the United States Senate from New Jersey.

8. Lieutenant-colonel Fremont was sent with a party of about sixty men to explore portions of New
Mexico and California. When he arrived in the vicinity of Monterey on the Paciﬁc coast, he was op-
posed by a Mexican force under general Castro. Fremont aroused all of the American settlers in the
vicinity of San Francisco Bay, captured a Mexican post and garrison, and nine cannons and two hun-
dred and ﬁfty muskets, at Sonora Pass [June 15, 1846], and then advanced to Sonora, and defeated Cas-
tro and his troops. The.Mexican authorities were effectually driven out of that region of country, and
on the 5th of July, the American Californians declared themselves independent-, and placed Fremont at
the head of the government. Two days afterward commodore Sloat, then in command of the squadron
in the Paciﬁc, bombarded and captured Monterey ; and on the 9th, commodore Montgomery took pos-
session of San Francisco. Commodore Stockton arrived on the 15th, and with colonel‘ Fremont, took
possession of the city of Los Angelos, on the 17th of August.‘

ward Chihuahua? to join general Wool. When with eighteen miles of its capi-
tal he was confronted [Feb. 28, 1847] by four thousand Mexicans. These he
completely routed,3 and then pressing forward to the city of Chihuahua, he en-
tered in triumph, raised the flag of the United States upon its citadel in the
midst of a population of forty thousand [March 2], and took possession of the
province in the name of his government. After resting six weeks he marched
to Saltillo [May 22], where general Wool was encamped. From thence he re-
turned to New Orleans, having made a perilous march from the Mississippi, of
about ﬁve thousand miles. The conquest of all Northern Mexico,4 with Califor-

nia, was now complete, and general Scott was on his march for the great capital.»

Let us now consider
GENERAL scorr’s INVASION or MEXICO.

24. The Mexican authorities having scorned overtures for peace made by the
government of the United States in the autumn of 1846, it was determined to
conquer the whole country. For that purpose general Scott was directed to col-
lect an army, capture Vera Cruz,-5 and march to the Mexican capital. His ren-

‘ 1. Fremont was ordered home to be tried for disobedience of orders. He was deprived of his com-
mission, but the President, valuing him as one of the ablest officers in the army, ollfered it to him again.
Fremont refused it, and Went again to the Wilderness and engaged in exploration. When California.
became a State, he was elected its ﬁrst United States Senator [1851], and now [1854] he is a rich and
honored citizen of that country. Fremont is about forty-three years of age. '

2. At Braceti, in the valley of the Rio del Norte, they met a large Mexican force on the 22d of Decem-
ber, under general Ponce de Leon. He sent a black flag to Doniphan with the message, “ We will nei-
their ask nor give quarter.” The Mexicans then advanced and ﬁred three rounds. The Missourians fell
upon their faces, and the enemy, supposing them to be all slain, rushed forward for plunder. The Amer-
icans suddenly arose, and delivering a deadly ﬁre from their riﬂes,’ killed two hundred Mexicans and
dispersed the remainder in great confusion. —

d 3.d The Americans lost in killed and Wounded, only eighteen men ; the Mexicans - lost about six hun-
re .

4. Some conspiracies in New Mexico against the new government, ripened into revolt, in January,
1847. Governor Bent and others were murdered at Fernando de Taos on the 19th, and massacres oc-
curred in other quarters. On the 23d, colonel Price, with three hundred and ﬁfty men marched against
and defeated the insurgents at Canada, and ﬁnally dispersed them at the mountain gorge called the

, Pass of Embudo.

5. This city was considered the key to the country. On an island opposite was a very strong fortress
called the castle of San Juan de Ulloa [note 4, p. 306], always celebrated for its great strength, and
considered impregnable by the Mexicans. ' .

Vera Cruz with an army of about thirteen thousand men, borne thither by a
powerful squadron commanded by commodore Conner? He invested the city
on the 13th, and ﬁve days afterward [March 18] having everything ready for
an attack,3 he summoned the town and fortress for the last time, to surrender. A
refusal was the signal for opening a general cannonade and bombardment from

his batteries and the ﬂeet. The siege

city, the strong castle of San Juan de
Ulloa,4 with ﬁve thousand prisoners and
ﬁve hundred pieces of artillery, were
surrendered to the Americans.5 The
latter had only forty men killed, and
about the same number wounded. At
least a thousand Mexicans were killed,
and a great number were maimed.

25. General Scott took possession of
Vera Cruz on the 29th of March, 1847,

INTRENCHMENTS AT VERA CRUZ and on the 8th of April, the advanced
force of his army, under general Twiggs,
commenced their march for the interior by way of J alapa.5' Santa Anna had
advanced, with twelve thousand men, to Cerro Gordo, a difﬁcult mountain pass at
the foot of the eastern chain of the Cordilleras. He was strongly fortiﬁed, and
had many pieces of cannon well placed for defence. Scott had followed Twiggs
with the main body. His whole army now numbered about eight thousand ﬁve
hundred men.7 Having skilfully arranged his plans, he attacked the enemy on
the 18th of April. The assault was successful. More than a thousand Mexi-
cans were killed or wounded, and three thousand were made prisoners.3 The
boastful Santa Anna9 narrowly escaped capture by ﬂeeing upon a mule taken
from his carriage. The Americans lost, in killed and wounded, four hundred and
thirty-one.

26. On the 19th of April, the victors entered J alapa; and on the 22d, general
Worth unfurled the stripes and stars upon the castle of Perote, on the summit of
the eastern Cordilleras, ﬁfty miles from J alapa. This was considered the strong-
est fortress in Mexico, next to Vera Cruz, yet it was surrendered without resist-
ance.“’ Onward the victorious army marched; and on the 15th of May [1847]
it entered the ancient walled and fortiﬁed city of Puebla,“ without opposition

tread the imperial city of Azteca.” So precipitate was his ﬂight that he left all his papers behind him,
and his wooden leg. He was so severely wounded in his leg, while defending Vera Cruz against the
French, in 1838, that amputation was necessary, and a wooden one was substituted. 1

after a series of victories almost unparalleled. Within two months, an army aver-
aging only about ten thousand men, had taken some of the strongest fortresses
on this continent, made ten thousand prisoners and captured seven hundred pieces
of artillery, ten thousand stand of arms, and thirty thousand shells and cannon

of the great Cordilleras. '
From their lofty summits, and almost from the same spot where Cortez and his
followers stood amazed more than three centuries before,3 Scott and his army
looked down [Aug. 10, 1847] upon that glorious panorama of intervales, lakes,
cities and villages, in the great valley of Mexico—the capital of the Aztec Em-
pire4—-the seat of “the Halls of the Montezumas.”5

28. On the 11th of August, general Twiggsb‘ cautiously led the advance of the
American army toward the city of Mexico, and encamped at St. Augustine, on
the Acapulco road, eight miles south of the capital. Before him lay the strong
fortress of San (or St.) Antonia, and close on his left were the heights of Chur-
ubusco, crowned with embattled walls covered with cannons, and to be reached
in front only by a dangerous causeway. Close by was the fortiﬁed camp of
Contreras, containing six thousand Mexicans, under general Valencia; and be-
tween it and the city, was Santa Anna, and twelve thousand men, held in re-
serve.

29. Such was the general position of the belligerents when, a little after mid-
night on the 20th of August [1847], general Smith7 marched to the attack of the
camp at Contreras. The battle opened at sunrise. It was sanguinary, ‘but

1. During this long halt ofthe American army the government of the United States made unavailing
efforts to negotiate for peace. The Mexican authorities refused the olive branch, and boasted of their
patriotism, valor and strength, while losing post after post, in their retreat toward the capital.

2. At one time there were eighteen hundred men sick at Puebla ; and at Perote seven hundred died
during the Summer, notwithstanding the situations of these places, on lofty table lands, were considered
exceedingly healthful.

3. Verse 23, p. 31.

4. According to the faint glimmerings of ancient Mexican history which have come down to us, the
Aztecs, who occupied that country when it ﬁrst became known to Europeans [verse 2-2, p. 31], came from
the North, and were more reﬁned than any other tribes, which, from time to time, had held possession
of the country. They built a city within the borders of Lake Tezcuco, and named it Mexico, in honor of
Memitli, their god of war. Where the present great cathedral stands, they had erected an immense tem-

ple, dedicated to the sun, and there offered human sacriﬁces. It is related, that at its consecration, al-

most sixty thousand human beings were sacriﬁced. The temple was built about the year 1480, by the
predecessor of Montezuma, the emperor found by Cortez.

5. Tlhis expression, referring to the remains of the palace of Montezuma in Mexico, was often used dur-
ing t e war.

6. David E. Twiggs was born in Georgia, in 1790. He was a major at the close of the war of'1812-’l5,
and was retained in the army. He was breveted a major-general after the battle at Monterey, and for his
gallantry there received the gift of a sword from Congress. '

brief, and the Americans were victorious. Eighty officers and three thousand
private soldiers were made prisoners; and the chief trophies were thirty-three
pieces of artillery. In the meanwhile, generals Pierce1 and Shields,'2 with a small
force, had kept‘Santa Anna’s powerful reserve at bay.

30. Scott now directed a similar movement
against Churubus co. Santa Anna advanced; and
the whole region became a battle-ﬁeld, under the
eye and control of the American commander-in-
chief. The invaders dealt blow’ after blow suc-
cessfully. Antonio yielded, Ghurubusco was taken,
and Santa Anna abandoned the ﬁeld and ﬂed to
the capital. It was a memorable day in Mexico.
An army, thirty thousand strong, had been
broken up by another less than one-third its
strength in numbers; and at almost every step
the Americans were successful. Full four thou-
sand of the Mexicans were killed or wounded,
three thousand were made prisoners, and thirty-
seven pieces of cannon were taken, all in one day.
The Americans lost, in killed and wounded, al-
most eleven hundred.

        

three miles of the city, a ﬂag came from Santa
Anna to ask for an armistice preparatory to ne-
gotiations for peace.3 It was granted; a.nd Nicholas P. Trist, who had been ap-
pointed, by the United States government, a commissioner to treat for peace, went
into the capital [Aug. 24] for the purpose. Scott made the palace of the arch-
bishop, at Tacubaya, his head’ quarters, and there anxiously awaited the result
of the conference, until the 5th of September, when Mr. Trist returned, with the
intelligence that his propositions were not only spurned with scorn, but that
Santa ‘Anna hadviolated the armistice by strengthening the defences of the city.
Disgusted with the continual treachery of his foe, Scott declared the armistice
at an end [Sept. 7], and prepared to storm the capital.

32. On the morning of the 8th of September, less than four thousand Amer-
icans attacked fourteen thousand Mexicans, under Santa Anna, at El Molinos
del Rey (the King’s Mills), near Chapultepec. They were at ﬁrst repulsed, with
great slaughter; but, returning to the attack, they fought desperately for an hour,
a.nd drove the Mexicans from their position. Both parties suffered dreadfully.
The Mexicans left almost a thousand dead on the ﬁeld, and the Americans lost
about eight hundred.

33. Chapultepec’ was doomed. It was a lofty hill, strongly fortiﬁed, and the
seat of the military school of Mexico. It was the last place to be defended out-_

side the suburbs of the city. Scott erected four heavy batteries to bearupon it,

on the night of the 11th of September; and the next day [Sept. 12., 1847],~a
heavy cannonade and bombardment commenced. On the 13th, the assailants
commenced a furious charge, routed the enemy, with great slaughter, and un-
furled the American ﬂag over the shattered castle of Chapultepec. The Mex-
icans ﬂed to the city along an aqueduct,'pursued by general Quitman‘ to its very
gates. That night, Santa Anna and his army, with the officers of government,
ﬂed from the doomed capital; and at four o’clock the following morning [Sept
14], a deputation from the city authorities waited upon general Scott, and beg-
ged him to spare the town and treat for peace. He would make no terms, but
ordered generals Worth and Quitmang to move forward, and plant the ‘stripes
and stars upon the National Palace. The victorious generals entered at ten

‘o’clock, and on the Grand Plazaﬁ took formal possession of the Mexican Empire.

34. "Order soon reigned in the capital. Santa Anna made some feeble efforts
to regain lost power,4 and failed; and before the close of October, he was a fu-
gitive, stripped of every commission. The president of the Mexican Congress
assumed provisional authority; and on the 2d of February, 1848, that body con-
cluded a treaty of peace, with commissioners of the United States, at Gauda-
loupe Hidalgo. This treaty was ﬁnally agreed to by both governments, and on
the 4th of July following, president Polk proclaimed it.5 New Mexico and Cal-
ifornia‘? now became territories of the United States.

35. Besides the war with Mexico, and the settlement of the Oregon boun-
dary question7 with Great Britain, ‘Mr. Polk’s administration was distinguished
by the establishment of an independent treasury system,8 by which the national
revenues are collected in gold and silver, or treasury notes, without the aid of
banks; and a revision of the tariff laws in 1846, by which protection to Ameri-
can manufacturers was lessened. During the last year of his administration
Wisconsin was admitted [May 29, 1848] into the Union of States, making the
whole ‘number thirty. A ‘

Cape Horn, across the isthmus of Panama, and over the great central plains of the continent, men went

America, hundreds ﬂocked thither; and the Chinese came also by scores from Asia, to dig gold. ~* The
dreams of the early Spanish voyagers [verse 24, p. 31], and those of the English who sought gold on the

coasts of Labrador [verse 18, p. 37], and up the rivers of the middle of the continent [verse 23, p. 39],

have been more than realized. Hundreds yet [1854] continue to go thither, and yet the gold seems in-
exhaustible. Since its ﬁrst discovery in 1848 to the close of 1853, there has been brought from California.

mission of Governor of Florida, with instructions to plant settlements there. In
attempts to do so, the angry natives, who had heard of the treachery of the
Spaniards, attacked him furiously. He was mortally wounded, and almost all
of his followers were killed. D’Ayllon was then appointed governor of the coun-
try which he had discovered and named Ohicom. He went thither to conquer
it, and was received with apparent friendship by the natives on the banks of the
Combaheeﬂ Many of his men were induced to visit a village in the interior.
The natives practised the lesson of treachery which D’Ayllon had taught them,
and massacred the whole party. The commander himself Was attacked upon
his own ship, and it was with difficulty that he escaped. .

22. In 1517, Francisco Fernandez de Cordova commanded an expedition from
Cuba, and discovered Mexico. His report of a people half civilized, and possess-
ing treasures in cities, awakened the keenest cupidity of the Spaniards ;_ and the

_ following year Velasquez, the governor of Cuba, sent another expedition to

Mexico, under Juan de Grrijalva. .That captain returned with much treasure,
obtained by trafficking with the Mexicans. .

23. Velasquez now determined to conquer the Mexicans, and possess himself
of their sources of wealth. An expedition, consisting of eleven vessels, and
more than six hundred armed men, was placed under the command of Fernando
Cortez, a brave but treacherous and cruel leader. He landed ﬁrst at Tobasco,

and then at San Juan de Ulloa,9 near Vera Cruz [April 12, 1519], where he

received a friendly deputation from Montezuma, the Emperor of the nation.3
By falsehood and duplicity, Cortez and his armed companions were allowed to
march to Mexico, the capital. By stratagem and boldness, and the aid of na-
tive tribes who were hostile to the Mexican dynasty, Cortez4 succeeded, after
many bloody contests during almost two years, in subduing the people. The
city of Mexico surrendered to him [August 23, 1521], and the vast and popu-
lous empire of Montezuma became a Spanish province.

24. Seven years later [1528], Pamphilo de Narvaez having been appointed

' governor‘ of Florida, went from Cuba, with three hundred men,5 to conquer it.

Hoping‘ to find a wealthy" empire, like Mexico, he penetrated the unknown
interior as far as the southern borders of Georgia. Instead of cities ﬁlled with
treasures, he found villages of huts, and the monarch of the country living in a
wigwamﬂ Disappointed, and continually annoyed by hostile savages, who had
heard of the treachery at the Combahee,7 he turned southward, and reaching
the ,shores of isﬁpallachee Bay, near St. Marks, he constructed rude boats and
embarked for Cuba. “ The commander and most of his followers perished; only
four escaped, and these wandered from tribe to tribe for several years, before
reaching a Spanish settlement in Mexico.

25. The misfortunes of Narvaez did not suppress the spirit of adventure,
and'FLORIDA (the name appliedto all North America) was still regarded by
the Spaniards as the new Land of Promise. All believed that in the vast
interior‘ were mines as rich, and people as wealthy as those of Mexico and

many parts of the Union, even before he returned home;1 and he was chosen
to be a candidate for that oﬁice, by a national convention, held at Philadelphia
in June, 1848. His opponent was general Lewis Cass, of Michigan, now [1854]
United States Senator from that State. General Taylor was elected by a large

SECTION XIII.
'r.A.YLoR’s ADMINISTRATION. [1849-1850],

1. Because the 4th of March, 1849, oc-
curred on the Sabbath, Zachary Taylor‘? took
the oath of ofﬁce as president of the Uni-
ted States on the 5th, and appointed his
cabinet on the following day.” The ap-
pointments were conﬁrmed by the Senate;
and with the heart of a patriot and honest
man, Taylor entered upon his responsible
duties with a sincere desire to serve his
country as faithfully in the cabinet, as he
had in the ﬁeld.4 He had the sympathies
of a large majority of the people with him,
and his inauguration was the promise of
great happiness and prosperity for the
country.

2. Thousands of adventurers were ﬂock-
ing to California from all parts of the
Union, when Taylor took the presidential
chair, and elements of a new and powerful
State were rapidly gathering there. States-
men and politicians perceived the import-
ance of the new territory, and soon the
question whether slavery should have a
legal existence there, became an absorbing
topic in Congress and among the people.
The inhabitants of California decided the
question for themselves. In convention at
San Francisco, the people voted against
TAYLOR, M,-D ms RESIDENML slavery, and a constitution for a State gov-

1. Verse 20, p. 304. ~

2. Zachary Taylor was born in Virginia, in November, 1784. He went with his father to Kentucky
the following year, and his childhood was passed near the present city of Louisville. He entered the
United States army in 1807. He was a distinguished subaltern during the war of 1812—’15, and attained
the rank of major. He was of great service in the Florida war [verse 6, p. 293] ; and when hostilities
with Mexico appeared probable, he was sent in that direction, and, as we have seen, displayed great
skill and bravery. He died in July, 1850, having performed the duties of President only sixteen months.

3. He appointed John M. Clayton, Secretary of State; William M. Meredith, Secretary of the Treas-
ury; George W. Crawford, Secretary of War; William B. Preston, Secretary of the Navy ; Thomas
Ewing, Secretary of the Interior (a new otﬁce recently established, in which some of the duties before
performed by the State and Treasury departments are attended to) ; J acob Collamer, Postmaster-Gem

ernment, adopted in convention at Monterey, on the 1st of September, 1849, ex-
cluded slavery from the Territory, forever.‘ The birth and maturity of this new
State seemed like a dream—all was accomplished within twenty months after
gold was discovered near Sutter’s Mill?

3. When the United States senators, appointed by the legislature of Califor-
nia,3 went to Washington, they carried their Constitution with them, and pre-
sented a petition [Feb. 1850] asking for the admission of that territory into
the Union as a free and independent State.4 The article of the constitution
which excluded slavery, became a cause for violent debates in Congress, and of
bitter sectional feeling between the people of the North and South. The Union
was shaken to its centre, and prophets of evil foretold its speedy dissolution.
As in 1832,? there were menaces of secession from the Union, by southern rep-
resentatives, and never before did civil war appear so inevitable. ‘

4. Happily for the country, some of the ablest statesmen and patriots the Re-
public had ever gloried in, were members of the national legislature, at that
time, and with consummate skill they directed and controlled the storm. In the
midst of the tumult and alarm in Congress and throughout the land, Henry
Clay again‘? appeared as the potent peace-maker between the Hotspurs of the
North and South; and on the 25th of January, 1850, he offered, in the Senate,
a plan of compromise which met the diiﬁculty. Eleven days afterward [Feb. 5,
1850] he spoke nobly in defence of his plan, denounced secession as -treason, and
implored his countrymen to make every sacriﬁce but honor, in support of the
Union. Mr. Clay’s plan was warmlyseconded by Daniel Webster; and other
senators approving of compromise, submitted propositions.

5. Finally, on motion of senator Foote of Mississippi, a committee of thirteen
was appointed to consider the various plansand reporta bill. The committee con-
sisted of six northern and six southern senators, and these chose the thirteenth.
The senate appointed Mr. Clay chairman of the committee, and on the 8th of May
following, he reported a bill. It was discussed for four} months, and on the
9th of September, each measure included in the bill having been thoroughly con-
sidered separately, the famous Oompromise Act of 1850 had passed both Houses
of Congress, and became a law.7 While this important discussion was progress-

1. General Riley, the military governor of California, established a sort of judiciary by proclamation,
in August, 1849, with Peter H. Burnet as chief justice. Before that time there was no statute law in
California. By proclamation, governor Riley called a convention to form a State constitution, and when
it was adopted, Burnet was elected governor, and the first legislature was held at San Jose, on the 20th
of December following.

3. John C. Fremont and William M. Gwin. Edward Gilbert and G. E. Wright were elected members
of the House of Representatives. '

At this time our government was perplexed by the claims of Texas to portions of the territory of
New Mexico, recently acquired [verse 34 p. 309], and serious diﬂiculty was apprehended. Early in
1850, the inhabitants of New Mexico petitioned Congress for a civil government, and the Mormons of
the Utah region also petitioned for the organization of the country they had recently settled, into a Ter-
ritory of the United States. See note 4, p. 312.

5. Verse 6, p. 288. 6. Verse 7, p. 288.

7. Because several measures, distinct in their objects, were embodied in the act, it is sometimes known as
the “ Omnibus Bill” The most important stipulations of the act were, 1st-. That California should be ad-
mitted into the Union as a State, with its anti-slavery Constitution, and its territorial extent from Ore-
gon to the Mexican possessions ; 2d. That the vast country east of California, containing the Mormon
settlements near the Great Salt Lake, should be erected into a Territory called Utah, without mention
of slavery; 3d. That New Mexico should be erected into a Territory, within satisfactory boundaries,
and without any stipulations respecting slavery, and that ten millions of dollars should be paid to
Texas from the Federal treasury in purchase of her claims ; 4th. That the slave trade in the Dis-
trict of Columbia should be abolished ; 5th. A law providing for the arrest in the northern or free States,
and return to their masters, of all slaves who should escape from bondage. The last measure of the
Compromise Act produced, and continues to produce, much dissatisfaction at the North ;'and the execu-
tion, evasion and violation of the law, in several instances, have led to serious disturbances and much
bitter sectional feeling. See note 1, p. 323.

6. Although the administration of presi-V
dent Taylor Was brief, it was distinguished
by events Which will have an important
bearing upon the future destiny of our Re-
public. One of these was an invasion of
Cuba by a force under generalLopez, which
Was organized and ofﬁcered in the United
States, in violation of existing neutrality
lavvs. Lopez landed at Cardenas on the
, 19th of April, 1850, expecting to be joined
\ \ by some of the Spanish troops and native
.. ,,\:n.«,, 1* Cubans, and by concerted action to rid the

  island of Spanish bondage. But thepeople
 and troops did not co-operate With him, and
j J disappointed, he returned to the United
States to prepare for a more formidable ex-
pedition.3 _During Taylor’s administration,
one sovereign State and three territories
Were added to the confederacy,_4 and prepa-
rations Were made for organizing other lo-

2. Millard Fillmore was born in January, 1800, in Cayuga county,
New York. His early education was limited, and at a suitable
age he was apprenticed to a Wool-carder. At the age of nineteen, his
talent attracted the attention of judge Wood, of Cayuga county,
and he took the humble apprentice under his charge, ‘to study the
science of law. He became eminent in his profession, He was
elected to the Assembly of his native State, in 1829, and‘ in 1832,
was chosen to represent his district in Congress. He was re-elected
in 1837, and was continued in otﬁce several years. In 1844, he was
an unsuccessful candidate for the ofﬁce of governor of his native
State, and in 1848 he was elected vice-president of the United
States. The death of Taylorgave him the presidency, andhe con-
ducted public affairs with dignity and skill.

ident of the Senate, and thus became ex-ofﬁcio vice-president of the United

8. The most important measure adopted during ‘
the early part of Fillmore’s administration, was
the Compromise Act, already considered.3 Dur-
ing his official career, the president ﬁrmly sup-
ported all the requirements of the act, and his
judicious course kept the waters of public opin-
ion comparatively calm, notwithstanding the
workings of the Fugitive Slave Law frequently \ 
produced much local excitement, where it hap- 
pened to be executed. At the close of his ad-

one, and has been productive of much social and commercial advantage, for inter-
changes of thought are proportionately more frequent than before, and friendly
intercourse and business transactions by letters are far more extensive. At the
same time electro—magnetic telegraphing had become quite perfect; and by
means of the subtle agency of electricity, communications were speeding over
thousands of miles of iron wire, with the rapidity of lightning.4 The estab-

a book Wh1C-h had been buried many centuries before, in a hill near the village of Palmyra, whose leaves
were of gold, upon which were engraved the records of the "ancient people of America, and a new gospel
for man.- He found dupes, believers and followers; and now [1854] there are Mormon missionaries in
every quarter of the globe, and the communion numbers, probably, not less than two hundred thousand
souls. There-is almost a suﬂicient number in Utah (60,000) to entitle them to a State constitution. and
admission into the Union. Their permission of polygamy, or men having more than one wife, will be a
serious bar to their admission, for Christianity and sound morality forbid the custom. The Mormons
have poetically called their country, Deseret—the land of the Honey 'Bee—but Congress has entitled it
Utah, and by that name it must be known in history.

Minnesota (sky—colored water) is the Indian name of the river St. Peter, the largest tributary of the Mis-
sissippi, in that region. It was apart of the vast Territory of Louisiana, and was organized in March, 1849.
An embryo village at the Falls of St Anthony, named St. Paul, was made the capital, and it now

progress of other cities of the West, and it promises to speedily equal Chicago in its population. I

4. In 1832, professor. Samuel F. B. Morse had his attention directed to the experiments of Franklin
upon a wire of a few miles in length, on the banks of the Schuylkill, in which the velocity of electricity
was found to be so inappreciable, that it was supposed to be instantaneous. Professor Morse, pondering
upon this subject, suggested that electricity might be made the means of recording characters as signs of
intelligence at a distance, and in the autumn of 1832, be constructed a portion of the instrumentalities
for that purpose. In 1835 he showed the ﬁrst complete instrument for teleg7'ap7z2'c recording, at the New
York city University. In 1837 he completed a more perfect machinery. In 1838 he submittted the mat-
tor and the telegraphic instruments to Congress, asking their aid to construct a line of sutﬁcient length
“to test its practicability and utility.” The committee to whom the subject wasreferred, reported fa-
vorably, and proposed an appropriation of $30,000, to construct the ﬁrst line. The appropriation, however,
was not made until the 3d of March, 1843. The posts for supporting the wires were erected between

10. During the Summer of ‘1851, there was again considerable excitement
produced .throughout the country because other concerted movements were
made at different points, in the organization of a military force for the purpose
of invading Cuba? The vigilance of the government of the United States was
awakened, and orders were given to Federal marshals to seize suspected men,
vessels, and munitions of war. The steam-boat, Cleopatra, was seized at New
York; and several gentlemen, of the highest respectability, Were arrested on a
charge of a violation of existing neutrality laws. In the meanwhile, the
greatest excitement prevailed in Cuba, and forty thousand Spanish troops were
concentrated there, while a considerable naval force. watched and guarded the
coasts. These hindrances caused" the dispersion of the armed bands who were
preparingto invade Cuba, and quiet was restored for awhile.

11. In July, the excitement was renewed. General Lopez3 made a speech
to a large crowd in New Orleans, in favor of an invading expedition. Soon
afterward [Aug. 1851], he sailed from that port with about four hundred and
eighty followers, and landed [Aug. 11] on the northern coast of Cuba. -There
he left colonel Crittenden,4 of Kentucky, with one hundred men, and proceeded
toward the interior. Crittenden and his party were captured, carried to Ha-
vanna, and on the 16th, were shot. Lopez was attacked on the 13th, and his
little army dispersed. 1 He had been greatly deceived. There yet appeared no
signs of revolution in Cuba, and he became a fugitive. He was arrested on the
28th, with six of his followers, taken to‘Havanna, and on the 1st of September
was executed.-5 Since that event, no successful effort to organize aninvading
expedition has been made, notwithstanding there is [1854] a strong feeling in
some sections favorable to it.5 . i _

extended possessions of the United States, by the purchase of twenty-one mill-
ions of acres of land in Minnesota, from the Upper Sioux tribes.7 At about the

telegraph, whose wires now [1854] extend a distance of more than forty-one thousand miles in the Uni-
ted States and Canadas. Professor Morse’s system of Recording Telegraphs is adopted generally on the
continent of Europe, and lately has been selected by the government of Australia, for the telegraphic
systems of that country. A very ingenious machine for recording'telegraphic-communications with
printing types, so as to avoid the necessity of copying, was constructed, a few years ago, by House, and
is now extensively used. _ -

York, and he was the first to deliver a course of lectures upon art, in America. He became a professor

in the New York city University, and there perfected his magnetic telegraph. Mr. Morse now [1854]

- same time, another broad region was purchased of the Lower Sioux ,1 and now

[1854] a white population is ﬂowing thither, to take the pla.ce of the Indians,
and make “the wilderness blossom as the rose.” On account of the rapid pro-
gress of immigration from abroad and inter-emigration at home, and the exceed-
ing prosperity of business of all kinds, the greatest activity everywhere pre-
vailed, and forecast perceived a vast and speedy increase. of population and na-

- tional wealth. Already new States and Territories were sending additional rep-

resentatives to the seat of the Federal government, and the capitol was be-

1 coming too narrow? In view of future wants, its extension was decided upon;
- and on the 4th of July, 1851, the president laid the corner-stone of the addition.3

13. In May, 1845, Sir John Franklin, a veteran English explorer, with two
vessels and one hundred and thirty-eight men, left Great Britain in search of
the long sought for north-west passage to the East Indies.4 Since the Spring of
1846, no tidings of him have been received, and several expeditions have been
sent in search of him. Among others, Henry Grinnell, a wealthy merchant of
New York, sent two vessels, at his own expense, in quest of the missing mar-
iner. The expedition left New York in May 1850, under the command of lieu-
tenant De Haven‘, of the United States navy. - It penetrated the polar waters to
the southern entrance of Wellington Channel, where the graves of three of
Franklin’s men, made in April 1846, were discovered; and after ineffectual at-
tempts to pass up that channel to the supposed open circumpolar sea beyond,
the expedition returned [Oct. 1851] without accomplishing its benevolent object.
Mr. Grrinnell, in connection with the government of the United States, sent an-
other expedition on the same errand, in May 1853, under the command of Dr.
E. K. Kane, the surgeon and naturalist of the former enterprise. It is now
[June 1854] in the polar regions.5 In the meanwhile, the great problem which,
for three hundred years, has perplexed the maritime world, has been worked
out by an English navigator. The fact of a north-west passage around the Arctic
coast of North America, from Baffin’s Bay to Behring’s Straits, has been unques-
tionably demonstrated.5 ' ’ . . -

1. About $225,000 wereipaid for this tract, and an annual payment of $30,000 for ﬁfty years. Alto-

] gether, the United ‘States government paid about $3,000,000 for Indian lands, in the Autumn of 1851.

2. Each State is entitled to two Senators. The number of States now [1854] being thirty-one, the Sen-
ate is composed of sixty-two members. The number of Representatives to which each State is en-
titled, is determined by the number of inhabitants. The present number of members in the House of
Representatives, is two hundred and thirty-four. ~

3. On that occasion, an oration was pronounced by Daniel Webster, in the course of which he said,
“ If, therefore, it shall hereafter be the will of God that this structure shall fall from its base, that its
foundations be upturned, and the deposit beneath this stone brought to the eyes of men be it then
known, that on this day, the Union of the United States of America stands ﬁrm—-that their Uonstitution
still exists unimpaired, and with all its usefulness and glory, growing every day stronger in the affec-
tions of the great body of the American people, and attracting, more and more, the admiration of the
world. '

5. Supposing Greenland to be the southern cape of the polar continent, it was the intention of Dr. '

Kane to sail as far north along that coast as the ice would allow, and then leave his vessels and make
an overland journey northward, in quest of supposed green ﬁelds under a mild atmosphere, and an open
sea within the polar circle ; and, perhaps, there ﬁnd the temporary home of Franklin and his men. Dr.
Kane is now [1854] only thirty-two yearsof age, light in person, and of indomitable energy. He holds
an accomplished pencil and a ready pen, and his scientiﬁc attainments are of the highest order. He has
travelled extensively, and has collected a-vast amount of material for popular instruction; His nar-
rative of the ﬁrst “ Grinnell Expedition,” written and illustrated by himself, is a wonderful recordof
travel, bold adventure and scientiﬁc research. ' I

6. In October 1853, Captain McClure, of the ship, Investigator, sent in search of Sir John Franklin,
having passed through Behring’s Straits, and sailed eastward, reached a point with sleds upon the ice,
which had been penetrated by navigators from the East (captain Parry and others), thus establishing
the fact, that there is a water connection between Baﬁin’s Bay and Behring’s Straits. Already
the mute whale had demonstrated this fact to the satisfaction of naturalists. The same species are
found in Bel1ring’s Straits and Batﬁn’s Bay ; and as the waters of the tropical regions would be like a
sea of ﬁre to them, they must have had communication through the polar channels. The connecting
water between Baring Island and Prince Albert Land, is called Prince of Wales Strait.

316 THE CONFEDERATION.

14. In December, 1851, Louis Kossuth, the exiled governor of Hungary, ar-
rived in New York, from England, on a mission to the United States in quest
of aid for his oppressed country. His Wonderful efforts in behalf of liberty in
Hungary during and after the European revolutions in 1848,‘ and his extraor-
dinary talent as an orator, secured for him a reception in Great Britain and in
the United States, such as the most powerful emperor might be proud of His
journey throughout a greater portion of the States, was like a continued ova-
tion. He Was welcomed by deputations from all classes and pursuits; and
many thousands of dollars were raised in aid of Hungary, by voluntary contri-
butions. His noble advocacy of correct international law? and universal brother-
hood, his unwearied labors in behalf of his smitten country, and his devotion to
the cause of human freedom in general, endeared him to the great majority of
the people of the United States. The policy of our government forbade its lend-
ing material aid; but Kossuth received an expression of its warmest sympathies.3
His advent among us, and his bold enunciation of hitherto unrecognized national
duties, are important and interesting events in the history of our republic.

15. During the summer of 1852, the subject of difﬁculties concerning the
ﬁsheries4 on the coast of British America was brought to the notice of Congress,
and for several months there Were indications of a serious disturbance of the
amicable relations between the governments of the United States and Great
Britain. American ﬁshers were charged with a violation of the treaty of 1818,
which stipulated that they should not cast their lines or nets in the bays of the
British possessions, except at a distance of three miles or more from the shore.
Now, the British government claimed the right to draw a line from head-land to
head-land of these bays, and to exclude the Americans from the waters within
that line.5 An armed naval force. was sent to sustain this claim, and American
vessels were threatened with seizure if they did not comply. The government
of the United States regarded the assumption as illegal, and two steam vessels of
war (Princeton and Fulton) were sent to the coast of Nova Scotia to protect the
rights of American ﬁshermen. The dispute was soon amicably [Oct. 1852] set-
tled by mutual concessions,.an.d the cloud passed by.

16. Another important measure of national concern was matured and put in

_operation during the Summer of 1852. The great importance of commer-

cial intercourse with Japan, because of the intimate relations which must soon
exist between our Paciﬁc coast and the East Indies, had been felt ever since the

foundation of Oregon‘? and California?’ An expedition, to consist of seven ships

1. In February 1848, the French people drove Louis Phillippe from his throne, and formed a tem-
porary republic. The revolutionary spirit spread; and within a few months, almost every country on

the continent of Europe was in a state of agitation, and the monarchs made many concessions to the .

people. Hungary made an effort to become free from the rule of Austria, but was crushed by the
power ofa Russian army. ‘ ‘
2. He asserted that grand principle, that one nation has no right to interfere with the domestic con-
cerns of another, and that all nations are bound to use their efforts to prevent such interference.
Matters connected with his reception, visit and desires, occupied much of the attention of Congress,

- and elicited warm debates during the session of 1852. The chevalier Hulseman, the Austrian minister at

Washington, formally protested against the reception of Kossuth, by Congress ; and because his protest
was not heeded, he retired from his post, and left the duties of his oiﬁce with Mr. Belmonte, of New
York. Previous to this, Hulseman protested against the policy of our government in relation to Austria
and Hungary, and that protest was answered, in a masterly manner [January 1851], by Mr. Webster,
the Secretary of State. .

4. Verse 5, p. 34.

5. This stipulation was so construed as to allow American ﬁshermen to catch cod within the large
bays where they could easily carry on their avocation at a greater distance than three miles from any
land. Such had been the common practice, without interference, until the assumption of exclusive
right to their bays was promulgated by the British. ~

of War, under the command of commodore Perry, a son of the “ Hero of Lake
Erie,”1- was ﬁtted out for the purpose of carrying a letter from the president of
the United States to the emperor of Japan, soliciting_thenegotiation of a treaty
of friendship and commerce between the two nations, by Which the ports of the
latter should be thrown open to American vessels, for purposes of trade. That
expedition is yet [June, 1854] in the East India Waters,2 and its efforts have

been crowned With success. Several Japan ports have been opened to our

commerce, and other privileges have been granted. Hitherto the Dutch have
monopolized the trade of J apan.3 ~

17. The Spanish authorities of Cuba, being thoroughly alarmed by the at-
tempts at invasion,4 and‘ the evident sympathy in the movement of a large por-
tion of the people of the United States, became excessively suspicious, and many
little outrages were committed at Havanna, Which kept alive an irritation of
feeling inconsistent With social and commercial friendship.5 The idea became
prevalent in Cuba and in Europe, that it Was the policy of the government of
the United States to ultimately acquire absolute possession of that island, and
thus have controlover the commerce of the Gulf of Mexico (the door to Cali-
fornia), and the trade of the West India group of islands, which are owned
chieﬂy by France and England. To prevent such a result the cabinets of
France and England asked that of the United States to enter With them into a
treaty Which should secure Cuba to Spain, by agreeing to disclaim “now and
forever hereafter, all intention to obtain possession of the Island of Cuba,” and
“to discountenance all such attempts, to that effect, on the part of any power
or individual Whatever.”

18. On the 1st of December, 1852, Edward Everett, then Secretary of State,
issued a response to this extraordinary proposition, Which the American people
universally applauded for its keen logic and patriotic and enlightened views. He
told France and England plainly, that the question Was an American, not ‘an
European one, and not properly Within the scope of their interference; that
While the United States government disclaimed all intention to violate existing
neutrality laws, yet it Would not relinquish the right to act in relation to Cuba,
entirely independent of every other power; and that it could not see With indif-
ference, “the island of Cuba fall into the hands of any other power than Spain.”6
Lord John Russell, the English prime minister, answered this letter, in February,
1853, and thus ended the diplomatic correspondence on the subject of the pro-
posed “Tripartite Treaty,” as it was called.

5. In the Autumn of 1852, an officer of the steamship Crescent City, which conveyed the United States
mails, passengers, and freight between New Orleans and New York, was charged by the Spanish au-
thorities with having written articles published in the New York papers, on Cuban affairs, which were
very offensive. He was forbidden to land in Havanna, and in November when the Crescent City, on her
way to New York, entered that harbor, no communication between her and the shore was allowed, and
she was obliged to proceed to sea, with passengers and mails, that should have been left at Havanna. A
more ﬂagrant outrage of a similar character was committed in the spring of 1854. See verse 11, p. 323.

6. As early as 1823, when the Spanish provinces in South America were in rebellion or forming into
independent republics, president Monroe, in a special message upon the subject, promulgated the doc-
trine, since acted upon, that the United'States ought to resist the extension of foreign domain or influ-
ence upon the American continent, and notallow any European government, by colonizing or otherwise,
to gain a foothold in the New World, not already acquired. This was directed specially against the efforts
expected to be made by the allied sovereigns who had crushed Napoleon, to assist Spain against her re-
volted colonies in America, and to suppress the growth of democracy there. It became a settled policy
of our government, and Mr. Everett re-asserted it in its fullest extent. Such expression seemed to be
important and seasonable, because it was well known that Great Britain was then making, strenuous elforts
to obtain potent influence in Central America, so as to prevent the United States from acquiring ex-
clusive property in the routes across the isthmus from the gulf of Mexico to the Paciﬁc Ocean.

19. The presidential election in November, 1852, resulted in the choice of
Franklin Pierce, of New Hampshire. William R. King, of Alabama, was
elected vice-president,‘ but failing health compelled him to leave the country be-
fore the oath of office could be adminis-
tered to him. He went to Cuba, remained
a few months, and died [April‘18, 1853]
soon after his return to his estate in Ala-
bama, at the age of sixty-eight years. The
most important of the closing events of
Mr. Fillmore’s. administration was the crea-
tion by Congress of a new Territory [March
2, 1853] called Washington, out of the
northern part of Oregon?

1. It was a stormy day [March 4, 1853]
when Franklin Pierce3 stood upon the rude
platform of New Hampshire pine, erected
for the purpose over the steps of the eastern
portico of the Federal capitol, and took the
oath of office administered by chief-justice
Taney.4 Among that greatassembly was
one who bore a near relationship to the
great Washington,5 and had been pres-
ent at the inauguration of every president
of the United States since the formation of
our federal government in 1789.5 Untram-
melled by special’party pledges, the new
chief magistrate entered upon the duties of
his office under pleasant auspices; and his
inaugural address, full of promise and patri-

3. Franklin Pierce was born in Hillsborough, New Hampshire, in 1804. His education was ﬁnished
in Bowdoin college, Maine. He chose the profession of law, and became one of its leading practitioners
in his native State. He was early called to public duties in his State legislature. In 1833 he was elected
to a seat in the Federal Congress, and remained there four years. He was elected UnitedStates Senator
i11 1837, which office he resigned in 1842. He prepared for the war with Mexico [verse 29, p. 307] as a com-
mon soldier,but received the commission of brigadier general, in which capacity he distinguished himself.
He went into retirement after the war, from which he was unexpectedly called to the chief magistracy
of the nation. , '

[March 7] the Senate, in special session, conﬁrmed his cabinet appointments,‘
and the administration now [1854] in progress, began its work.

2. The earliest serious diﬁiculty which president Pierce was called upon to
encounter, was a dispute concerning the boundary line between the Mexican
province of Chihuahua-2 and New Mexico.3 The Mesilla valley, a fertile and
extensive region, was clairned by both Territories; and under the direction of
Santa Anna,4 who is again [1854] president of the Mexican republic, Chihua-
hua took armed possession of the disputed territory. For a time, war seemed
inevitable between the United States and Mexico. The dispute was ﬁnally
settled by negotiations; but , events are continually tra-nspiring on the bor-
ders of the two countries, calculated to promote much irritation of feeling.
The people of Mexico are quite impatient of the arbitary rule of Santa Anna,
and insurrection after insurrection continually disturb the Republic. The
youth of the present generation will probably observe the rule of the United
States eventuallyiextended over the whole of that unhappy country. "_ _, V I

3. Another exploring expedition,5 consisting of four armed vesselsand a sup-
ply-ship, sailed from Norfolk in May, 1853, under the command of captain
Ringgold. Its destination is the eastern coast of Asia, and its object a thorough
exploration of those regions of the Paciﬁc ocean yet to be traversed by vessels
passing between the ports of our western frontier and China. ‘This expedition
is now [1854] pursuing its researches. In the meanwhile, plans have been ma-
tured for the construction of one or more railways from the Mississippi valley
across the continent to the Paciﬁc coast. The thirty-second Congress, at its last
session5 authorized surveys; and by mid-summer [1853] four expeditions were
ﬁtted out to explore as many different routes.7 These surveys are yet [June
1854] in progress; and taken in connection with the naval; operations, they
rank among the most important movements of the age. Who can estimate the

career as a commanding general, he was again elected president in
1841, but was hurled from power in 1845. After the [capture of the
city ‘of Mexico by Scott [verse 33, p. 308], he retired to the West In-
dies, and ﬁnally to Carthagena, where he resided until 1853, when
he returned to Mexico, and was elected president, again. He is now

Yucatan‘. Among the most sanguine- of the possessors
of such an opinion, was Ferdinand de Soto, a brave and
wealthy cavalier, who had gained riches and military hon-
ors, with Pizarro, in Peru.‘ ‘

26. De Soto obtained permission of the Spanish em-
peror to conquer FLORIDA at his own expense. He was
appointed governor of Cuba, and also of Florida, and with
ten vessels and six hundred men, all clad in armor, he
sailed for the New World. Leaving his wifeto govern
Cuba, he proceeded to Florida, landed on the shores of
Tampa Bay [June 10, 1539], sent most of his vessels

“E S°T°- back, and then made his way, among hostile savages,
toward the interior of the fancied land of gold.9 He win-

tered on the banks of the Flint river, in Georgia, and in the Spring crossed the
Apallaehian mountains, and penetrated the beautiful country of the C'herolcees.3

27. For several months, De Soto and his followers wandered over the hills
and vallies of Alabama, in vain searches for treasure, ﬁghting the ﬁerce M0bz'Zz'cm
tribes,4 and becoming diminished in numbers by battle and disease. They
passed the Winter of 1541 on the banks of the Yazoo river, in the land of the
0hz'clcasaws.5 In the Spring [May, 1541], they discovered and crossed the Mis-
sissippi river, probably not far below Memphis, and, in the presence of almost
twenty thousand Indians, De Soto there erected a cross, made of a huge pine
tree. They went up the western shore of the Mississippi as far as New Madrid.
The ensuing Summer and Winter were spent in the wilderness watered by the
Arkansas and its tributaries, and in the Spring they returned to the Mississippi,
at the mouth of the Wachita, where De Soto sickened and died, after appiiinting
his successor.5 They had marched full three thousand miles. ’

28. The followers of De Soto were now reduced to half their original num-
ber ;‘ and, abandoning all hope of ﬁnding gold, or a wealthy people, they sought
for Spanish settlements in Mexico. For many months they wandered over the
prairies, among the t_ributary streams of the Red River, as far as the land of the
00mamches,7 when impassable mountain ranges compelled them to retrace their
steps to the Mississippi. At a little below, -Natchez they remained until the fol-
lowing July [1543], engaged in ; constructing seven large boats, in which they
embarked.- Reaching the Gulf of Mexico, they crept cautiously along its coast;
and, on the 20th of September, the little remnant of De Soto’s proud army, half-
naked and starving, arrived at a Spanish settlement near the mouth of the
Panuco, thirty miles north of Tampico. " .. 

29.. This was the last attempt of the Spanish contemporaries of. Columbus to
explore,[ orjto. make settlements within the present territory of the United
States,'previous'to the appearance of the English‘3 in the same ﬁeld. They were

dignity upon labor, hitherto withheld by‘ those who bore sceptres and orders.
There men of all nations and creeds received a lesson upon the-importance of
brotherhood among the children of men, such as the pen and tongue could not

5. Pleased with the idea of a World’s Fair, Americans repeated its develop-
ment upon their own free soil.- In the heart of the commercial metropolis of
the New World, a “Crystal Palace” was erected; and on the 14th of July,
1853, an exhibition of theindustry of all nations was opened there with impos-
ing ceremonies led by the president of the United States. For Several II10I1thS
the Palace was thronged with delighted visitors; and on the 4th of May, 1854,
it was re-opened with impressive ceremonies as a perpetual exhibition. There
in that beautiful palace, Labor was crowned as the supreme dignity of a na-

tion and of the world.‘ Although the whole proceedings appeared but an
ephemeral show, and tl1e scheme of a perpetual exhibition may fail, the event
will ever remain a prominent initial letter on the pages of our history.

6. In the month of July, 1853, an event occurred which greatly increased the
respect of foreign nations for the flag of the United States. A Hungarian refu-
gee,2 named Martin Koszta, had taken the legal measures t_o become a natural-
ized citizen of our Republic. While engaged in
business at Smyrna, on the Mediterranean, he was
seized, by order of the Austrian consul’-general,3
and taken on board of an Austrian brig to be con-
veyed to Trieste as a rebel refugee, notwithstand-
ing he carried an American protection. Captain
Ingraham, of the United States sloop-of-war,4 St.
Louis, then lying in the harbor of Smyrna, imme-
diatelyclaimed Koszta as an American citizen. On
the refusal of the Austrian authorities to release
the prisoner, Ingraham cleared his vessel for
action [July 2], and threatened to ﬁre upon the
brig if Kozsta was not delivered up within a given
time. The Austrians yielded, and Koszta was
placed in the custody of the French consul, to
await the action of the respective governments. CAPTAIN INGRAM“-
Ingraham’s course was everywhere applauded; »
and Congress signiﬁed its approbation by voting him an elegant sword. The
Austrian government issued a protest against the proceedings of captain In-
graham, and sent it to all the European courts; and Mr. Hulseman, the Aus-
trian minister at Washington,5 demanded an apology, or other redress, from our
government, and menaced the United States with the displeasure of his royal
master. But no serious difﬁculty occurred; and Koszta, under the protection
of the United States ﬂag, returned to this land of free opinions.

7. The thirty-third Congress (ﬁrst sessionfi) assembled, as usual, early in De-
cember, 1853. A greater degree of good feeling was exhibited among members
of both Houses, from all parts of the Union, than had been witnessed since the
excitement incident to the slavery agitation in 1850.7 The people regarded the
session as one of great moment, for subjects of vast national importance would
necessarily occupy the attention of their representatives. The construction of a

1. One of the speakers on the occasion [Elihu Burritt] said : “ Wortliy of the grandest circumstances
which could be thrown around a human assembly, Worthy of this occasion and a hundred like this, is
that beautiful idea, the coronation of labor. . . . . Not American labor, not British labor, not French
labor, not the labor of the New World or the Old, but the ‘labor of mankind as one undivided brother-
hood-—labor as the oldest, the noblest prerogative of duty and humanity.” And Rev. E. H. Chapin closed
with the beautiful invocation : “ O I genius of Art, ﬁll us with the inspiration of still higher and more
spiritual beauty. 0 I instruments of invent-ion, enlarge our dominion over reality. Let iron and ﬁre
become as blood and muscle, and in this electric net-Work let heart and brain enclose the world with
truth and sympathy. And thou, 0 1 beautiful dome of light, suggestive of the brooding future, the
future of human love and divine communion, expand and spread above the tribes of men, a canopy
broad as the earth, and glorious as the upper heaven.”

2. When Austria, by the aid of Russia [note 1, p. 316], crushed the rebellion in Hungary, in 1848,
many of the active patriots became exiles in foreign lands. A large number came to the United States,
and many of them have become naturalized citizens——that is, after due legal preparation, took an oath to
support the Constitution and laws of the United States, and to perform faithfully all the duties of a
citizen.

railway to the Paciﬁc ocean,‘ was a topic of paramount interest to be discussed.
There were treaties in progress respecting boundaries _ and claims between t.he
United States and their Southern neighbors, Mexico and Central America ,9 and
the government of the Sandwich Islands was making earnest overtures for an-
nexing that ocea11 empire to ’our'r‘epublic.3 Just as the preliminaries were ar-
ranged, for entering vigorously upon the business of the session,'the chairman
"of the Senate Committee on Territories (Mr. Douglas), presented a bill [Jan.,
1854] which disturbed the harmony in Congress and quietude _among the people.

8. In the centre of our continent is a vast region, almost twice as large, in
territorial extent, as the original thirteen Sta-tes,4 stretching between Missouri,
Iowa and Minnesota, and the Paciﬁc territories, from the thirty-seventh parallel
of north latitude to the British possessions,5 and embracing one-fourth of all the
public lands of the United States. The bill alluded to, proposed to erect this vast
region into two. Territories, the southern portion below the fortieth parallel to
be named Kcmzas, and the northern and larger portion, Nebraska. The bill con-
tained a provision which would nullify the compromises of 18205 and 1850,’? and
allow the establishment of the institution of slavery therein, notwithstanding al-
most the entire area of Nebmska would lie north of the line speciﬁed in the Mis-
souri compromise?‘ . r

9. This proposition surprised Congress and the whole country, and it became
a subject of discussion throughout the Union. The slavery agitation was
aroused in all its strength and rancor, and the whole North became violently
excited. Public meetings were held by men of all parties,‘a.nd-petitions and
remonstrances against the measure, especially in its relation to Nebraska, were
poured into the Senate,9 while the debate on the subject was progressing, from
the 14th of February [1854] until the 7th of March. On the latter ‘da-y,,the bill
passed that body by the decisive vote of thirty-seven to fourteen. - The measure
encountered great opposition in the House of Representatives; and by means
of several amendments, its ﬁnal defeat seemed almost certain, and the excite-
ment subsided.1° » V . .

in the Missouri river where the fortieth parallel north latitude crosse's the same ; thence west on said
parallel to the summits of the highlands separating the waters ﬂowing into the waters of the Green river,

highlands to the summit of the Rocky Mountains ; thence on said summit northward to the forty-ninth
parallel of north latitude ; thence east on said parallel to the western boundary of the Territory of Min-
nesota ; thence southward on said boundary to the Missouri river ; thence down the main channel of said
river to the place of beginning.” It also thus deﬁnes the boundaries of Kcmzas : “ Beginning at apoint
on the western boundary of the State of Missouri, where the thirty-seventh parallel of north latitude
crosses the same ; thence west on said parallel to the eastern boundary of New Mexico ; thence north
on said boundary tolatitude thirty-eight ; thence following said boundary westward to the summit of

waters ﬂowing into the great basin; thence northward on said summit to the fortieth parallel of lat-
itude ; thence east on said parallel to the western boundary of the State of Missouri ; thence south with
the western boundary of said State, to the place of beginning.”

9. A petition against the measure was presented to the Senate, immediately after the passage of the
bill by that body, signed by three thousand clergymen of New England.

bill was again called up in the House of Representatives [May 9, 1854] ; and a
motion was made by one of its supporters, to close all debate on the subject
within ﬁve minutes _after the_house should resume_ its consideration. V This pro-
duced intense excitement in that body, and a session of thirty-six consecutive
hours’ duration ensued, When an adjournment took place, in the midst of great
confusion. The ﬁnal question was taken on the 22d, and the bill was passed by
a vote of one hundred and thirteen to one hundred. Three days afterward [May
25], the Senate agreed to it as it came from the House, and it received the signa-
ture of the President on the last day of May. Prophets of evil regard this
event as the egg of much future trouble.‘ ~ v

11. While the Nebraska subject was in progress, new difficulties With the
Spanish authorities of Cuba, appeared? Under cover of a shallow pretense,
the American steamship, Black VVa7~m'0r, was seized in the harbor of Havana
[February 28, 1854], and the vessel and cargo declared conﬁscated. A The
outrage was so ﬂagrant, that a proposition was immediately submitted to
the lower House of Congress, to suspend the neutrality laws,3 and compel
the Havana officialsto behave properly. The president sent a special mes-
senger to the government at «Madrid, with instructions to the American minister
to demand immediate redress. In the meanwhile, the perpetrators of the out-
rage became alarmed, and the captain general (or governor) of Cuba, with pre-
tended generosity, offered to give up the vessel and cargo, on the payment by
the owners, of a ﬁne of six thousand dollars. ‘They complied, but under pro-
test,4 and so the matter now [J une, 1854] stands.

12. But an international question has arisen between the governments of the
United States and of Old Spain, which may be diﬁcult to adjust,5 and so strong
is the indignation of the people of our Union, against the Cuban officials, and so
powerful is the tendency of a spirit of adventure'toward'an invasion of that
island, to assist the native population in casting off the Spanish yoke,5 that a
crisis must speedily be reached. The president of the United States having been
informed that expeditions were preparing in diiferentparts of the Union, for the
purpose of invading Cuba, issued a proclamation against such movements, on

act, might select a quarter section [one hundred and sixty acres] of land, on the public domain, and on
proof being given that he had occupied and cultivated it for ﬁve years, he might receive a title to it, in
fee, without being required to pay anything for it. ‘

1. A few days after the ﬁnal passage of the Nebraska bill, the city of Boston was made a theater of
great excitement, by the arrest of a fugitive slave there, and a deputy-marshal was shot dead, during a
riot. United States troops from Rhode Island were employed, to sustain the oﬂicers of the law, and a
local military force was detailed, to assist iii the protection of the court and the parties concerned, until
the trial of the alleged fugitive was completed. The United States commissioner decided in favor of the
claimant of the slave, and he was conveyed to Virginia by a government vessel.

2. Verse 17, p. 317. .

3. Agreements made between the governments of the United States and Old Spain, to remain neutral
or inactive, when either party should engage in War with another. Under the provisions of such laws,
any number of c_itizens of the United States, who may be engaged in hostilities against Spain, would
forfeit the protection of their government, and become liable to punishment, for a violation of law.
Was on this account that Crittenden and his party [verse 11, p. 314] were shot at Havana, without the
right of claiming the interference of the government of the United States in their behalf.

4. By protesting against an act which a party is compelled to perform, leaves the matter open for fu-

ture discussion and ﬁnal settlement. ‘
— 5. So important have the commercial transactions between the United States and Cuba become, that it
is felt to be a necessity for the Spanish authorities of the island to be immediately responsible for any
outrage they may commit. As the matter now stands, the settlement of the diﬁiculties growing out of
the seizure of the Black Warrior, must be made, not with the perpetrators, but with the far-off gov-
ernment of old Spain, at Madrid. The people of the United States do not feel disposed to tolerate irre-
sponsible despotisms so near the line of their commercial operations.

tions of existing treaties, between the governments of our Republic and Spain.
Thick coming events appear to indicate that proclamations will be of little avail,
and that Cuba, the “Queen of the Antilles,” may soon become an island-state
of our vast Confederation.‘

13. And here, on the verge of great events yet to be developed in the Old and
New World, we pause in our wonderful story of the discovery,2 settlement,3 and
colonization4 of this beautiful land, and the establishment of one of the noblest
Republics the world ever saw, covering with the broad aegis of its power, a terri-
tory as extensive as that of old -Rome in her palmiest days, When she was mis-
tress of the world.5 Let us not take special pride in the extent and physical
grandeur of our beloved country, but endeavor to have our hearts and minds
thoroughly penetrated with the glorious thoughts of Alcaeus of Mytelene, who
asked and answered-

“What constitutes a State ?

Not high-raised battlement or labored mound,
Thick wall or moated gate; ,

Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crowned;
Not bays and broad armed ports,

Where, laughing at the storms, rich navies ride;
Not starred and spangled courts,

Where low-browed basenesswafts perfume to pride.
No: men, high-minded men, V

With powers as far above dull brutes endued,
In forest, brake or den,

As brutes excel cold rocks and brambles rude——
Men, who their duties know,

But know their rights, and knowing, dare maintain;
Prevent the long-aimed blow, _

And crush the tyrant while they rend the -chain-
These constitute a ;S'zfaz5e.”

1. So rapid and wonderful are the political changes at the present time, that events here hinted at,
may become realities before these pages shall be printed, and the reader and learner may ﬁnd it neces-
sary to change the tense of the last few verses, from the present to the past ; but while the writer lives,
all necessary additions to this history will be made, from time to time.

5. The territorial extent of our Republic, is ten times as large as that of Great Britain and
France combined; three times as large as the whole of France, Britain, Austria, Prussia, Spain, Portu-
gal, Belgium, Holland and Denmark together ; one and a-half times as large as the Russian empire in
Europe, and only one-sixth less than the area covered by the sixty States and Empires of Europe. The

» entire areain 1853, was 2,983,153 square miles. The internal trade of the United States is of vast ex-

tent. Its value amounted in 1853 (Lake and Western River trade), to more than $560,000,000, in which
about 11,000,000 of our people are directly or indirectly interested. According to the seventh enumera-
-'on of inhabitants of the United States, made in 1850, the total number was 23,191,876, of whom 19,553,-
068, are white people; 434,495, free colored; and 3,204,313, slaves. Taking the increase of population
from 1840 to 1850, as a basis for calculation, we may safely conclude the population of the United States
to be, at this time [.Tune, 1854], about 27,000,000. The most aceessible works, in which are given, in
detail, the progress of political events ‘in the United States, from the formation of the Constitution until
the present time, are Hildreth’s IIt'st07‘y of the United States, second series ; and Wi1liams’s Statesmanﬁs

326 SUPPLEMENT.

A DECLARATION BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES  AMERICA,
' IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED.

When, in the course of human-events, it becomes necessary for one people to
dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to as-
sume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station, to which
the laws of nature, and of nature’s Grod entitle -them,»a decent respect to the
opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel
them to the separation.

3. We hold these truths to be self-evident—that all men are created equal; '
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that

among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That, to secure these
rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from
the consent of the governed; that, whenever any form of government becomes
destructive of these ends, it isxthe right of the people to alter or abolish it, and
to institute a new government, laying its foundations on such principles, and or-
ganizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed,’ will dictate that governments long
established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and, accord-
ingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more "disposed to suffer, while
evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which
they are accustomed.’ But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursu-
ing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute
despotism, it is their right, it is theirduty, to throw off such government, and
to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient suf-

ferance of these colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them '

to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present king
of Great Britain, is ahistory of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in
direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these States. To
prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world. . .
4. »He has refused-his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary. for
the public good.‘ . t _
5. He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing im-

portance, unless suspended in their operations till his assent should be obtained ;

and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.2

6. He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation‘ of large districts
of people, unless those people. would relinquish the right of representation in
the Legislature—a right inestimable to them, and formidable to tyrants only.3

1. The colonial assemblies, from time to time, made enactments touching their commercial operations,
the emission of a colonial currency, and concerning representatives in the imperial parliament, but the
assent of the sovereign to these laws was withheld. After the Stamp Act excitements [verse 11, p. 16
Secretary Conway informed the Americans that the tumults should be overlooked, provided the Assem-
blies would make provision for full compensation for all public property which had been destroyed. In
complying with this demand, the Assembly of Massachusetts thought it would be “ wholesome and neces-
sary for the public good,” to grant free pardon to all who had been engaged in the disturbances, and
patsseddan act accordingly. It would have produced quiet and good feeling, but the royal assent was
re use . *

2. In 1764, the Assembly of New York took measures to conciliate the SIX NATIONS, and other Indian
tribes. The motives of the Assembly were misconstrued, representations having been made to the king
that the colonies wished to make allies of the Indians, so as to increase their physical power and propor-
tionate independence of the British crown. The monarch sent instructions to all his governors to desist
from such alliances, or to suspend their operations until his assent should be given. He then “utterly
neglected to attend to them.” - The Massachusetts Assembly passed a law in 1770, for taxing officers of
the British government in that colony. The governor was ordered to withhold his assent to such tax-
bill. This was in violation of the colonial charter, and the people justly complained. The Assembly
was prorogued from time to time, and laws of great importance were “ utterly neglected.” ~

3. A law was passed by parliament in the Spring of 1774, by which the popular representative system
in the province of Quebec (Canada) was annulled, and officers appointed by the crown, had all power

as legislators, except that of levying taxes. The Canadians being Roman Catholics, were easily paci-

ﬁed under the new order of things, by having their religious system declared the established religion of
the province. But “ large districts of people” bordering on Nova Scotia, felt this deprivation to be a

A '7. _He has called together _legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable,
and distant from the repository of theirpublic records, for the sole purpose of
fatiguing them into compliance With his measures.‘

8. He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing, with manly
ﬁrmness, ‘his invasions on the rights of the people.'3

9. He has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others to
be elected, whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have re-
turned to the people at large for their exercise; the State remaining, in the
meantime,‘ exposed to all the dangers of invasions from Without, and convulsions
within.3 _

10. He has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that
purpose obstructing the laws for the naturalization of foreigners; refusing to
pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the conditions of
new appropriations of lands.4 _

11. He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent to
laws for establishing judiciary powers.5

great grievance. Their humble petitions concerning commercial regulations were unheeded, because
they remonstrated against the new order of things, and governor Carleton [verse 19, p. 180] plainly told
them that they must cease their clamor about representatives, before they should have any new commer-
cial laws. ‘A bill for “ better regulating the government in the province of Massachusetts Bay,” passed
that year, provided for the abridgment of the privileges of popular elections, to take the government
out of the hands of the people, and to vest the nomination of judges, magistrates, and even sheriffs, in
the crown. When thus deprived of “free representation in the Legislature,” and the governor refused
to issue warrants for the election of members of the Assembly, they called a convention of the freemen,
and asked for the passage of “laws for the accommodation of large districts of people.” These re-
quests were disregarded, and they were told that no laws should be passed until they should quietly
“ relinquish the right of representation in the Legislature—-a right inestimable to them, and formidable
to tyrants only.” ‘

1. In consequence of the destruction of tea in Boston harbor [verse 30, p. 169] in 1773, the inhabitants
of that town became the special objects of royal displeasure. The Boston Port Bill [verse 31, p. 170] was
passed as apunishment. The custom house, courts, and other public operations were removed to Salem,
while the public records were kept in Boston, and so well guarded by two regiments of’ soldiers, that the
patriotic members of the colonial Assembly could not have referred to them. Although compelled to meet
at a place [verse 31, p. 170] “ distant from the re_pository of the public records,” and in a place extremely
“ uncomfortable,” they were not fatigued into compliance, but in spite of the efforts of the governor,
they elected delegates to a general Congress [verse 35, pp. 171], and adopted other measures for the public

good. - V - .

2. When the British government became informed of the fact that the Asssembly of Massachusetts
in 1768, had issued a circular [verse 18, p. 165] to other Assemblies, inviting their co-operation in assert-
ing the principle that Great Britain had no right to tax the colonists without their consent, Lord Hills-
borough, the Secretary for Foreign Affairs, was directed to. order the governor of Massachusetts to re-
quire the Assembly of that province to rescind its obnoxious resolutions expressed in the circular. In

-case of their refusal to do so, the governor was ordered to dissolve them immediately. Other Assem-

blies were warned not to imitate that of Massachusetts, and when they refused to accede to the wishes
of the king, as expressed by the several royal governors, they were repeatedly dissolved. The Assem-

blies of Virginia and North Carolina were dissolved for denying the right of the king to tax the colonies,

or to remove offenders out of the country, for trial‘. [See verse 22, p. 166]. In 1774, when the several
Assemblies entertained the proposition to elect delegates to a general Congress [verse 34, p. 171], nearly
all of them were dissolved. ' ' .

3. When the Assembly of New York, in1766, refused to comply with the provisions of the Mutiny Act
[verse 16, p. 164], its legislative functions were suspended by royal authority [verse 17, p. 164], and for
several months the State remained “ exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convul-
sions within.” The Assembly of Massachusetts after its dissolution in July, 1768, was not permitted to
meet again until the last Wednesday of May, 1769, and then they found the place of meeting surrounded
by a military guard, with cannons pointed directly at their place of meeting. They refused to act under
such tyrannical restraint, and their legislative powers “ returned to the people.”

4. Secret agents were sent to America soon after the accession of George the Third to the throne of
England [verse 7, p. 160], to spy out the condition of the colonists. A large inﬂux of liberty-loving
German emigrants was observed, and the king was advised to discourage these immigrations. Obstacles
in the way of procuring lands, and otherwise, were put in the way of all emigrants, except from Eng-
land, and the tendency of French Roman Catholics to settle in Maryland, was also discouraged. The
British government was jealous of the increasing power of the colonies, and the danger of having that
power controlled by democratic ideas, caused the employment of restrictive measures. The easy con-
ditions upon which actual settlers might obtain lands on the Western frontier, after the peace of 1763
[verse 7, p. 160], were so changed, that toward the dawning of the revolution, the vast solitudes west of
the Alleghanies were seldom penetrated by any but the hunter from the seaboard provinces. When the
War for Independence broke out, immigration had almost ceased. The king conjectured wisely, for al-
most the entire German population in the colonies, were on the side of the patriots.

5. By an act of parliament in 1774, the judiciary was taken from the people of Massachusetts. The
judges were appointed by the king, were dependent on him for their salaries, and were subject to his
will. , Their -salarieslwere paid from moneys drawn from the people by the commissioners of customs
[verse 17, p. 164], in the form of duties. The same act deprived them, in most cases, of the beneﬁt of

328 .1 7 SUPPLEMENT.

12. He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their
offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.‘

13. He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of -

officers to harass our people and eat out their substance? '

14. He has kept among us in times of peace, standing armies, without the
consent of our Legislatures.3

15. He has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to, the
civil power.4

16. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our
constitutions, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to their acts
of pretended legislation :5

which they should commit on the inhabitants of these States;7

trial by jury, and the “administration of justice” was effectually obstructed. The rights for which
Englishmen so manfully contended in 1688 [note 6, p. 83] were trampled under foot. Similar griev-
ances concerning the courts of law, existed in other colonies, and throughout the Anglo—American
[note 1, p. 148] domain, there was but a semblance of justice left. The people met in conventions, when
Assemblies were dissolved, and endeavored to establish “judiciary powers,” but in vain, and were
ﬁnally driven to rebellion. _

1. As we have observed in note 5, p. 327, judges were made independent of the people. Royal governors
were placed in the same position. Instead of checking their tendency to petty tyranny, by having them
depend upon the colonial Assemblies for their salaries, these were paid’ out of the national treasury.
Independent of the people, they had no sympathies with the people, and thus became ﬁt instruments of
oppression, and ready at all times to do the bidding of the king and his ministers. The Colonial Assem-
blies protested against the measure, and out of the excitement which it produced, grew that power of
the Revolution, the committees of correspondence [note 1, p. 171]. When, in 1774, chief justice Oliver, of
Massachusetts, declared it to be his. intention to receive his salary from the crown, the Assembly pro-
ceeded to impeach him, and petitioned the governor for his removal. The governor refused compliance,
and great irritation ensued.

2. After the passage of the Stamp Act, stamp distributers were appointed in every considerable town.
In 1766 and 1767, acts for the collection of duties created “ swarms of officers,” all of whom received
high salaries ; and when, in 1768, admiralty and vice-admiralty courts were established on a new basis,
an increase in the number of officers was made. The high salaries and extensive perquisites of all of
these, were paid with the people’s money, and thus “ swarms of oﬁicers ” “ eat out their substance.”

3. After the treaty of peace with France, in -1763 [verse 48, p. 155], Great Britain left quite a large
number of troops in America, and required the colonists to contribute to their support. There was no
use for this standing army, except to repress the growing spirit of democracy among the colonists, and
to enforce compliance with taxation laws. The presence of troops was always a cause of complaint, and
when, ﬁnally, the colonists boldly opposed the unjust measures of the British government, armies were
sent hither to awe the people into submission. It was one of those “ standing armies” kept here “ with-
out the consent of the Legislature,” against which the patriots at Lexington and Concord [verses 4
and 5, p. 174], and Bunker Hill [verse 10, p. 176] so manfully battled in 1775.

4. General Gage, commander-in-chief of the British forces in America, was appointed governor of
Massachusetts, in 1774, and to put the measures of the Boston Port Bill [verse 31, p. 170] into execution,
he encamped several regiments of soldiers upon Boston Common. The military there, and also in New
York, was made independent of, and superior to, the civil power, and this, too, in a time of peace,
before the minute men [verse 1, p. 172] were organized.

5. The establishment of a Board of Trade, to act independent of colonial legislation through its crea-r
tures (resident commissioners of customs) in the enforcement of revenue laws, was altogether foreign to,
the constitution of any of the colonies, and produced great indignation. The establishment of this
power, and the remodelling of the admiralty courts, so as to exclude trial by jury therein, in most cases,
rendered the government fully obnoxious to the charge in the text. The people felt their degradation
under such petty tyranny, and resolved to spurn it. It was effectually done in Boston, as we have seen
[verse 20, p. 165], and the government, after all its bluster, was obliged to recede. In 1774, the members
of the council of Massachusetts (answering to our Senate), were, by a parliamentary enactment, chosen
by the king, to hold the oﬂice during his pleasure. Almost unlimited power was also given to the gov-
ernor, and the people were indeed subjected to “ a jurisdiction foreign to their constitution,” by these
creatures of royalty.

6. In 1774 seven hundred troops werelanded in Boston, under cover of the cannons of British armed
ships in the harbor; and early the following year, parliament voted ten thousand men for the American
service, for it saw the wave of rebellion rising high under the gale of indignation which unrighteous

acts had spread over the land. The tragedies at Lexington and Concord, soon followed, and at Bunker _

Hill, the War for Independence was opened in earnest.

7. In 1768, two citizens of Annapolis, in Maryland, were murdered by some marines belonging to a
British armed ship. The trial was a mockery of justice, and in the face of clear evidence against them,
they were acquitted. In the diﬁiculties with the Regulators [verse 27, p. 168] in North Carolina, in 1771,
some of the soldiers who had shot down citizens, when standing up in defence of their rights, were tried
for murder and acquitted, while governor Tryon mercilessly hung six prisoners, who were certainly en-
titled to the beneﬁts of the laws of war, if his own soldiers were.

8. The navigation laws [note 3, p. 135] were always oppressive in character ; and in 1764, the British
naval commanders having been clothed with the authority of custom house ofﬁcers, completely broke

2. This was especially the case, when commissioners of customs were concerned in the suit. After
these functionaries were driven from Boston in 1768 [verse 20, p. 165], an act was passed which placed
violations of the revenue laws under the jurisdiction of the admiralty courts, where the offenders were
triedby a creature of the crown, and were deprived “ of the beneﬁts of trial by jury.”

3. A law of 1774 provided that any person in the province of Massachusetts, who should be accused

of riot, resistance of magistrates or the ofﬁcers of customs, murder, “or any other capital offence,”

I might, at the option of the governor, be taken for trial to another colony, or transported to Great Britain,

for the purpose. The minister pretended that impartial justice could not be administered in Massachu-
setts, but the facts of captain Preston’s case [verse 25, p. 167]; refilled his 31‘8‘11meI1tSa in that direction-
The bill was violently opposed in parliament, yet it became a law. It was decreed that Americans
might be “ transported beyond the seas, to be tried for pretended offences,” or real crimes.

4. This charge is embodied in an earlier one [verse 6, p. 326], considered in note 3, p. 326. The Brit-
ish ministry thought it prudent to take early steps to secure a footing v in America, so near the scene of
inevitable rebellion, as to allow them to breast, successfully, the gathering storm. The investing of a.
legislative council in Canada, with all powers except levying of taxes, was a great stride toward that ab-
solute military rule which bore sway there within eighteen months afterward. Giving up their political
rights for doubtful religious privileges, made them willing slaves, and Canada remained a part of the
British empire, when its sister colonies rejoiced in freedom. I

5. This is a reiteration of the charge considered in note 5, p. 327, and refers to the alteration of the Mas-
sachusetts chart-er, so as to make judges and other ofﬁcers independent of the people, snd subservient to the
crown. The governor was empowered to remove and appoint all inferior judges, the attorney-general,
provosts, marshals, and justices of the peace, and to appoint sheriﬁs independent of the council. As
the sheriffs chose jurors, trial by jury might easily be made a. mere mockery. The people had hitherto
been allowed, by their charter, to select jurors ; now the whole matter was placed in the hands of the
creatures of government.

6. This, too is another phase of the charge just considered. We have noticed the suppression of the
Legislature of New York [note 3, p. 327], and in several cases, the governors, after dissolving colonial
Assemblies, assumed the right to make proclamations stand in the place of statute law. Lord Dunmore
assumed this right in 1775, and so did sir James Wright, of Georgia, and -lord William Campbell, of
South Carolina. _ They were driven from the country, in consequence.

7. In his message to parliament early in 1775, the king declared the colonists to be in a state of open
rebellion, and by sending armies hither to make war upon them, he really “ abdicated government,” by
thus declaring them “ out of his protection.” He sanctioned the acts of governors in employing the
Indians against his subjects [note 3, p. 330], and himself bargained for the employment of German
hirelings. And when, yielding to the pressure of popular will, his representatives (the royal governors)
ﬂed before the indignant people, he certainly “ abdicated government.”

8. When naval commanders were clothed with the powers of custom-house officers [note 8, p. 328], they
seized many American vessels ', and after the affair at Lexington and Bunker Hill, British ships ofwar
“ plundered our seas ” whenever an American vessel could be found. They also “ ravaged our coasts and
burnt our towns.” Charlestown [verse 11, p. 177], Falmouth (now Portland, in Maine), and Norfolk were
burnt," and Dunmore -and others [verse 25, p. 182] “ravaged our coasts,” and “ destroyed the lives of our
peo le.” And at the very time when this Declaration was_ being read to the assembled Congress
[verse10-. D. 187],‘ the shattered ﬂeet of Sir Peter Parker was sailing northward [verse 8, p. 186], after an
attack upon Charleston, South Carolina.

in precious metals; and it was reserved for others, who came afterward, with
loftier aims, better hearts, and stronger hands, to cultivate the soil, and to estab-
lish an Empire founded upon truth and justice. « The Spaniards did become
possessors of the southern portion of the continent; and to this day the curse of
moral and political despotism ‘rests upon those regions.

SECTION III.

ENGLISH AND FRENCH DISCOVERIES.

1. The Spanish court could not conceal the fact that a New World had been
discovered,‘ and over Continental Europe and the British Isles, were spread the
most extravagant tales of gold-bearing regions beyond the Atlantic Ocean.
Monarchs and wealthy "subjects projected new expeditions. Among those
whose zeal in the cause of maritime discovery was newly awakened, was Henry
the Seventh of England, who had turned a deaf ear to the appeals of Columbus
before his great ﬁrst voyage? ,

2. Bristol Was then one of the most important maritime towns in England;
and among its adventurous seamen, who had penetrated the polar waters, prob-
ably as far as Greenland, was Sebastian Cabot, son of a wealthy Venetian mer-
chant of Bristol, whose father sought the aid of the king in making a voyage of
discovery. Willing to secure a portion of the prize he had lost, Henry readily
yielded to the solicitations of Cabot, and gave him and his sons a commission
of discovery [March 16, 1496] similar, in some respects, to that which Colum-
bus had received from Ferdinand and Isabella.3

3. Young Cabot sailed from Bristol in May
1497, with two vessels, freighted by his father
and others of that port, and of London. He
steered north-westerly until he encountered im-
mense ﬁelds of ice, westward of Cape Farewell,

    
        
 
 

 
   
   

when he turned to the southwest, and on the 3d ‘  ,

of July [1497] he -discovered the rugged coast ,_.._*,, /,
of Labrador. Passing Cape Charles, he saw ‘ ._   .//

N ewfoundland;4 and, after touching at several -/7  . I,  9
points, he hastened to England to announce the    ._ . "
fact that he had ﬁrst discovered a great Western 1 Q; . ._, "  / / 
continent. ' il\\\\q‘;‘y‘7,  , 1/ z

4. The following year, young Cabot,5 although \.k§\, ‘mi ,‘ *-‘V‘ i I

only twenty-one years of age was placed in com- ”‘

mand of another expedition, ﬁtted out by his
father and some Bristol merchants, for the pur- - _
p’ose of discovering a north-west passage to India. Ice in the polar seas pre-
sented an impassable barrier, and he was compelled to go southward. He ex-

complete the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with cir-
cumstances of cruelty and perﬁdy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages,
and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation} 7

29. He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high seas, to
bear arms against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and
brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands?

30. He has excited domestic insurrection among us, and has endeavored to
bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian savages, whose
known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and
conditions.3 I . ,

31. In every stage of these oppressions we have petitioned for redress in the
most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated
injury. A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may de-
ﬁne a tyrant, is unﬁt to be the ruler of a free people.4 .

32. Nor havewe been wanting in our attentions to our British brethren.5
We have warned them, from time to time, of attempts by their legislature to
extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. .We have reminded them of the
circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to
their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of
our common kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably in-
terrupt our connections and correspondence. They, too, have been deaf to the
voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the ne-
cessity which denounces our separation, and hold them as we hold the rest of
mankind—-enemies in war-——in peace, friends.

33. We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in
general Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for
the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good
people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare that these united colonies
are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States; that they are ab-
solved, from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political connection
between them and the state of Great Britain, is, and ought to be, totally dis-
solved, and that, as free and independent States, they have full power to levy
war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and do all other
acts and things which independent States may of right do. And for the support

of this Declaration, with a ﬁrm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, .

We mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

I. This charge refers to the infamous employment of German troops, known here as Hessians. See

, verse 2, p. 183.

2. An act of parliament passed toward the close of December, 1775, authorized the capture of all
American vessels, and also directed the treatment of the crews of armed vessels to be as slaves and not
as prisoners of war. They were to be enrolled for “the service of his majesty,” and were thus com-
pelled to ﬁght for the crown, even against their own friends and countrymen. This act was loudly con-
demned on the ﬂoor of parliament, as unworthy of a Christian people, and “ a reﬁnement of cruelty
unknown among savage nations.” .

3. This was done in several instances. Dunmore was charged [note 5, p. 178] with a design to em-
ploy the Indians against the Virginians, as earlyas 1774 ; and while ravaging the Virginia coast in 1775
and 1776, he endeavored to excite the slaves against their masters. He was also concerned with governor
Gage and others, under instructions from the British ministry, in exciting the Shawnees,and other sav-
ages of the Ohio country, against the white people. Emissaries were also sent amongthe Cherokees and
Creeks, for the same purpose, and all of the tribes of the Six Nations, except the Oneidas, were found
 arms wilth tllie British when war began. Thus excited, dreadful massacres occurred on the borders of

e severa co onies. *

4. For ten long years the colonies petitioned for redress of grievances, “ in the mosthumble terms,”
and loyal manner. It was done by the Colonial Congress of 1765 [verse 12, p. 162], and also by the
Continental Congresses of 1774 [verse 35, p. 171] and 1775 [verse 15, p. 178]. But their petitions were
almost always “answered only by repeated injuries.” ‘

5. From the beginning, the colonists appealed, in the most affectionate terms, to “ their British breth-
ren.” The ﬁrst address ut forth by the Congress of 1774 [note 2, p. 172] was “To the People of
Great Britain ;” and the longress of 1775, sent an alfectionate appeal to the people of Ireland. ‘

Among the signers of the Declaration of Independence, were men engaged
in almost every vocation. There were twenty-four lawyers; fourteen farmers,
or men devoted chiefly to agriculture; nine merchcmts; four physicians,‘ one
gospel minister, and three who were educated for that profession, but chose
other avocations; and one manufactiirer. A large portion of them lived to the
age of three score and ten*years.-- -Three of them wereover 90 years of age when
they-died; ten over 80; eleven over 70; fourteen over 60; eleven over 50;
and six over 44. _ Mr. ‘Lynch (lost at sea) was only 30. The aggregate years of
life of the ﬁfty-six patriots, were 3,687 years. ' -

as far as the entrance to I-Iudson’s~Bay; and nine years later [1526], while in
the service of the Emperor of Spain,1 he‘ explored the coast of Brazil, discovered
and named the great Rio de la Plain, and penetrated the southern continent, in
boats upon the bosom of thatriver, almost four hundred miles. To the Cabots,
father and son, belongs the imperishable honor of ﬁrst discovering the coast of
the United States, through, at least, ten degrees of latitude; and to Italy be-
longs the honor of giving birth to the two great discoverers, Columbus and
Cabot, and to Americus Vespucius, whose name our continent now bears?

5. Cabot ﬁrst discovered the immense numbers and commercial importance
of the cod ﬁshes in the vicinity of Newfoundland; and within ﬁve or six years
after their ﬁrst voyages, many ﬁshermen went thither from England, Brittany,
and Normandy, for those treasures of the deep. Every French vessel that went
to America, was on a commercial errand only, until 1523, when Francis the
First ﬁtted out four ships, for the purpose of exploring
the coasts of the New World. He gave the command to
John ,Verrazzani, an eminent Florentine navigator.
Verr-azzani sailed in December, V 1523, but a tempest
disabled three of his ships, and he was compelled to go
with only one. He proceeded due west from the Ma-
deiras [Jan. 27, 1524], and ﬁrst touched the American
Continent [March] near the mouth of the Cape Fear
River, in North Carolina. After seeking a good harbor
for ﬁfty leagues further south, he sailed northward, and
explored the coast from the Carolinas to Newfoundland.
He anchored in the bays of Delaware and New York,3 the

Verrazzani gave the name of NEW FRANCE to the

he had discovered. ,'

_ 6. The French king was too much engrossed and
impoverished by ‘war with the Spanish monarch, to
pay much attention to the important discoveries of
Yerrazzani, or to listen to plans for future expedi-
tions. Ten years elapsed before Admiral Chabon
induced Francis to encourage another exploring en-
terprize, when a plan for making settlements in NEW

2. King John of Portugal, like Henry of England, had‘ refused to aid Columbus, and lost the great
prize. After the return _of the navigator, he felt a desire to ﬁt out an expedition for discoveries in the
New World, but the Pope having given to Spain the whole region westward beyond an imaginary line
three hundred leagues west from the Azores, he dared not interfere with the Spanish mariners. But
when the northern voyages of the Cabots became known, King John despatched an expedition in that
direction, under Gaspar Cortoreal, toward the close of the year 1500, for the ostensible purpose of seek-
mg a northwest passage to India. Cortoreal coasted alongithe shores of Labrador several hundred
miles, and then freighting his ship with ﬁfty natives whom he had caught, he returned to Portugal and
sold his living cargo, for slaves. Finding the adventure proﬁtable, he sailedfor another cargo but he
was never heard of afterward. Almost sixty years later some Portuguese settled on Newfoundland and
Nova Scotia, and ﬁrst imported cattle and swine there. '

"‘ I have carefully examined your new “History of the United
States,” and introduced it into my school. I think it far superior, in
many important particulars, to any text book of its kind now in use,
viz. : it meets the wants of both instructor and pupil ; it combines in
a "well-arranged, condensed and attractive form, the historical matter
necessary to be retained, without being compelled to gather up much
that is superﬂuous. In these particulars, and in its general arrange-
ment, it is just the book needed. I sincerely hope that a work so
admirably adapted to instruction will ﬁnd its way into all our best
schools. ‘

[From DR. HORACE WEBSTER, Principal of Free ./flcademy, New
~ York.

“I am pleased with your “History of the United States.” You
sympathize freely with your subject ; you write as an American ought
to write the history of his own country ; you make the trials and pri-
vat-ions of the early settlers your own, and enter heartily into the
feelings of those earnest men, who, at a later period, encountered the
dangers incident to a war with the most powerful European nation.

These facts add much to the value of your book, as it is important A

that the youth of our country should know and appreciate the merits
of their ancestry, their integrity and honesty of purpose, in" laying the
foundation of a great empire. It affords me pleasure to recommend
your History to others.”

‘ “ A better work of its kind and class has not made its appearance
for some time past ; it is at once very thorough and concise", clear and
explicit, at the same time by no means dry, and far from meagre. As

‘ a. proof of this we learn that the pupils in a well—known school, Where

it is used as a text-book, take it up for recreation after their regular
lessons. Accuracy is everywhere evident. Over one hundred en-
gravings make it a handsome book, that every American boy and girl
should study, and their elders possess and review.”

“It is the most comprehensive and judicious summary of American
history of which we have any knowledge.”

[.From D. L. SWAIN, President of the Um've7*.9iz/gy of ./Vorth C'arolz'na.]

“As a History designed to be read in schools and at the fireside, it
is the most comprehensive, minute and accurate compound that has
fallen within the range of my examination. The type is remarkably
clear, the pictorial embellishments numerous, apposite and beautiful ;
and while it will be very attractive to the juvenile reader, the Well-
informed historian will very frequently turn to it as a most conven-
ient and accurate remembrancer.”

[From the JV‘. Y. Evening Post.]
“.We commend the work as a clear and diligently digested com-
pend of American history.”

[From the JV’. Y. Ea:press.]

“In all the elements of attractiveness, Whether of a brilliant Wri-
ter, an honest historian, or a fervent patriot, or the more factitious
attractions of beautiful typography and profuse embellishments
there is no abridgement of American history yet Written that can for
a moment be compared with this.”

[From the Right Rev. ALONZO POTTER, Perm.]

_“ Asa manual for schools and families it is a work of rare merit-
the vivacity of style, clearness of the narrative, the apt and striking
illustrations contained in the foot notes, and the capital pictorial
adjuncts, combine to invest it with an interest, much needed, but
often Wanting in our historical compilations.”

[From the JV‘. Y. Independent]

passed the straits of Belleisle, and entered the Gulf on
the day dedicated to St. Lawrence; and Cartier gave the
name of the martyr to the broad sheet of water over which
they were sailing. They passed up the river which after-
ward received the same name, and mooring their ships at

“The engravings being real delineations of persons, places, and
things, rather than fancy sketches, possess the rare merit of eluci-
dating the text. The language is clear, concise, and English.
While events are traced to causes, and the philosophy of history is
developed, no partisan or sectional bias is discovered. These quali-
ties, together with its excellent adaptation, in point of arrangement,
to the purpose of instruction, have determined me to introduce it to

Incidents on Long Island,” 8;c.]
“ DEAR SIR :

“ I have read your new book for schools and families, with
great interest. It is precisely such a work as is wanted, at this time
——one in which the whole essential history of our country is told in
a clear, concise, and pleasing manner, and illustrated truthfully and-
approprz'ateljL/. The work contains a vast amount of matter, admi-
rably arranged ; and the engravings, being illustrations of fact, add
immensely to its value. As far as I can judge, you have not over-
looked any essential point in our history ; and, by the aid of the foot
notes, you have introduced everything that might interest the young
in the study of the subject. The new and highly useful feature of
the work, is the concordance, which teacher an_d scholar cannot
praise too highly. The book, though primarily intended for schools
and academics, is admirably adapted for family reading ;"and I know
of no book of its size that can compare, in value, in that particular,

with your beautiful and carefully prepared History.

[From Miss ORAM, Georgetown, D. 0.]

-" This beautiful volume cannot fail of being received by teachers,
as an invaluable aid in teaching their pupils the History of our coun-
try. The clear style of the narrative, the useful illustrations,
the amount of information, with copious explanatory notes, must
greatly enhance its value, as atext book, in our schools.”

following, departed for France, just as Roberval arrived at N ewfoundlarid, with
two hundred persons. Roberval passed up the St. Lawrence, built two more
forts near Quebec, endured a Winter of great distress, and abandoning the idea
of settlement, returned to France in the Spring of 1543. Six years afterward, he
again sailed for the St. Lawrence, and was never heard of again.

11. N ow was the era of the Reformation in France.‘ The doctrines and the
teachings of Calvin and others, in opposition to the faith and practice of the
Roman Catholic Church, had already arrayed great masses of the people in vio-
lent hostility to each other. The religious war was a.n absorbing idea, and for
ﬁfty years the French government made no further attempts at discovery or
colonization. But private enterprise sought to plant a French settlement in the
land discovered by D’Ayllon.2

12. The Huguenots, or French Protestants, had a powerful friend in Jasper
Coligny, admiral of France, but a weak protector in the reigning monarch,
Charles the Ninth. The ﬁres of persecution were continually burning, and
Coligny conceived the noble idea of providing a place of refuge for his Protestant
brethren, beyond the Atlantic. The king granted him a commission for that
purpose, and early in 1562 [Feb. 28], a squadron, under John Ribault, sailed
for America. -

13. The little Huguenot ﬂeet touched ﬁrst near the harbor of St. Augustine,
in Florida.3 Sailing northward, they saw the mouth of the beautiful St. J olin’s
river [May, 1562], and, it being the ﬁfth month of the year, they named it May.
Making their way along the coast, they discovered Port Royal entrance, were
charmed with the beauty of the scene, chose the spot for their future home, and
built asmall fort, which they named Carolina, in honor of the king. Leaving a
garrison to defend it, Ribault went back to France with the ships, for reinforce-
ments. Bitter disappointment ensued. Civil war was raging in France, and
Coligny was almost powerless. The reinforcements were not supplied, and the
little garrison, in despair, built a frail vessel, and, with insutﬁcient stores, em-
barked for France. Tempests assailed them, and famine was menacing them
with death, when they were picked up by an English bark. Thus perished the
first seeds of religious freedom which the storms of persecution bore to the New
World. '

14. Coligny was not discouraged; a.nd, during a lull in the tempest of civil
commotion, another expedition wa-s'“sent to America, under the command of
Laudonniere, who had accompanied Ribault on his ﬁrst voyage. They arrived
in July [1564], pitched their tents on the banks of St. John’s, and built an-
other Fort Carolina. There were elements of dissolution among these emigrants.
Many were idle, vicious,.' and improvident; and provisions soon became scarce.

».Under pretext. of “returning to France, to escape famine, quite a large party

sailed‘[December] in one of the vessels. They turned pirates, and depredated
extensively upon Spanish property in the West Indies. The remainder became
discontented, and were about to embark for France, when Ribault arrived with
emigrants and supplies, and took command.4

15. -When the Spanish monarch heard of the settlement of the French Pro-
testants within his claimed territory, and of the piracies of some of the party, he
adopted measures for their expulsion and punishment. Pedro Melendez, a brave

but cruel military chief} was appointed Governor of Florida, on condition that
he should expel the Frenchmen from the soil, conquer the natives, and pla.nt a
colony there within three years. He came with a strong, armed force, landed
in a ﬁne harbor on the coast of Florida, laid the foundations of St. Augustine
[Sept. 17th, 1565], and proclaimed the king of Spain to be monarch of all North
America.

16. On hearing of the arrival of the Spaniards, a large party of the French,
under Ribault, proceeded from the St. J ohn’s, by water, to attack them. ‘A
tempest wrecked every vessel ; and most of the survivors, who fell into the hands
of the Spaniards, were put to death. In the _meanwhile, Melendez made his
way through the swamps and forests with a strong force, to the defenceless
French settlement, where he massacred about nine hundred men, women, and
children, and over their dead bodies placed an inscription, avowing that he slew
them, not “because they were Frenchmen, but Lutherans!” Upon that ﬁeld of
blood the monster erected a cross, and laid the foundation of a church to com-
memorate the deed. N p

17. The feeble Charles of France took no steps to avenge the outrage, perpe-
trated under the sanction of the bigot, Philip the Second, of Spain. But one of
his subjects, a ﬁery soldier of Grascony, named Dominic de Gourges, inﬂicted
retribution. He had suffered Spanish bondage, and panted for revenge. He
ﬁtted out three ships at his own expense, and with one hundred and ﬁfty men
sailed for Florida. He attacked the Spaniards upon the St. J ohn’s, made two
hundred prisoners, and hanging his captives upon the trees almost upon the
spot where his countrymen had been murdered, he placed over them the in-
scription——“ I do not this as unto Spaniards or mariners, but unto traitors, rob-.
bers, and murderers.” Too weak to brave the vengeance of Melendez, who was
at St. Augustine, De Gourges immediately left the coast, and returned to
France.‘ The natives were delighted at seeing their common enemies thus de-
stroying each other. The Spaniards, however, held‘ possession, and a Spanish
settlement was ever afterward maintained at St. Augustine, except during a few
years.

18. Although the English seem not to have wholly relinquished the idea of
planting settlements in America, it was not until the twentieth year of the bril-
liant reign of Queen Elizabeth, and almost eighty years after the discovery of
the continent by Cabot,9 that healthy efforts to found colonies in the New
World, were made. Sir Martin Frobisher3 (an eminent navigator) and others had
explored the north-western coast of North America, to the dreary region north
of Hudson’s Bay,4 in search of precious metals and a north-west passage to India,5
but without beneﬁcial results. Newfoundland was visited every year by numer-
ous English and French ﬁshing vessels, and the neighboring continent was
frequently‘ touched by the hardy mariners. Yet no feasible plans for coloniza-
tions were matured.

19. When the public mind of England was turned from the cold regions of Lab-
rador and the fancied mineral wealth in its rugged mountains, to the milder
South, and the more solid beneﬁts to be derived from plantations than mines, a

new and brilliant era in the history of civilization began. This change was pro-
duced incidentally by the Huguenot adventurers.‘ The remnant of Coligny’s
ﬁrst colony, who Were picked up at sea and sent to Engla.nd, informed the
queen of the glory of the climate and the fertility of the soil, of Carolina. When
De Gourges returned from his foray upon the Spaniards? Walter Raleigh, then
a young man of much promise, was learning the art of war with Coligny, in
France, and he communicated to his friends in England that Chevalier’s account
of Florida, which was yet a wilderness free for the sons of toil. The Protest-
ant3 feeling of England was strongly stirred by the cruelties of Melendez, and
soon many minds were employed in planning schemes for the colonizing of the
pleasant middle regions of North America.

20. The ﬁrst healthy plan for settlement was proposed by the lea.rned Sir
Humphrey Gilbert, a step-brother of Walter Raleigh.‘ In June, 1578, he ob-
tained a liberal patent or. grant from the queen. Raleigh gave him the aid of
his hand and fortune; and early in 157 9, Gilbert sailed for America, with a
small squadron,’ accompanied by his step-brother. Heavy storms and Spanish
war vessels compelled them to return, and the scheme was abandoned for a time.
Four years afterward [1583] Gilbert sailed with another squadron; and after a
series of disasters, he reached the harbor of St. John, in Newfoundland. There
he set up avpillar With the English arms upon it,4 proclaimed the sovereignty of
his queen, and then proceeded to explore the coast southward. After being
terribly beaten by -tempests off the shores of Nova Scotia and Maine, and losing
his largest ship, he turned his vessel toward England. At midnight, during a
gale, his own little bark of ten tons Went down, with all on board [Sept], and
only one vessel of the expedition returned to England to relate the dreadful
narrative.

21. Raleigh now obtained a patent for himself [April 1584.-], which made him

~ ” = . lord proprietor of all lands that might be
discovered ‘by him in America, between the
Santee and Delaware Rivers. He despatched
Philip Amidas and Arthur Barlow, with two
well-furnished ships, to explore the Ameri-
can coast. They approached the shores of

islands of Wocoken and Roanoke, in Pam-

22. Raleigh now indulged in brilliant dreams
of wealth and power to be derived from the
New World, and he made immediate preparations
for planting settlements on his trans-Atlantic .
domains. He despatched a ﬂeet of seven vessels
[April 19, 1585], under the command of Sir
Richard Grenville. He was accompanied by
Ralph Lane, the appointed governor of the col-
ony, with learned companions; and also by Man-
teo, the native chief. They narrowly. escaped
shipwreck on the Carolina coast‘ [June], and in
consequence they named the land where their
peril was greatest, Cape Fear. Entering Ocracock
Inlet, they landed upon the island of Roanoke, in
Albemarle Sound, and there prepared for a per-
manent residence. «

- 23. Instead of looking to the fruition of seed-time for true riches, the English
turned from the wealthy soil upon which they stood, and went upon vain
searches for gold in the forests of the adjoining continent. Instead of recipro-
cating the hospitable friendship of the natives, they returned harshness for
kindness, and treachery for conﬁdence, until a' ﬂame of revenge was kindled
among the Indians which nothing but the blood of Englishmen could quench.
Schemes for the destruction of the white intruders were speedily planned, and
tribes in the interior stood ready to aid their brethren upon the seaboard. As
soon as Grenville departed with the ships, for England, the natives withheld
supplies of food, drew the English into perilous positions by tales of gold-bearing

ruin. At that moment, Sir Francis Drake arrived from the West Indies, with
his ﬂeet, and afforded them relief. But misfortunes and fear made them anxious
to leave the country, and the emigrants were all conveyed to E~ngla.nd [June,
1586] by Drake. A few days after their departure, a well-furnishedvessel, sent
by Raleigh, arrived; and a fortnight later, Grenville entered‘ the inlet with three
ships well provisioned. After searching for the departed colony, ‘Grenville
sailed for England, leaving ﬁfteen men upon Roanoke. . ‘

- 24. Raleigh was still undismayed by misfortune. Heiadopted a wise policy,
and instead of sending out mere fortune-hunters,1 he collected a band of agri-
culturists and artisans, with their families, and despatched them [April 26,
1587] "to found an industrial State in Virginia. He’ gave them _a‘ cliarter of
incorporation for the settlement; and John Whi_te, whoaccompanied them, was
appointed governor of the colony. They reached Roanoke in July, but instead
of the expected greetings of the men left by.Grenville, they. encountered utter
desolation. The bones of the fifteen lay bleaching on the ground. Their rude

tenements were in ruins, and wild deer were feeding in their little ga.rden.s.; _
 They had been murdered by the Indians.

DESCRIPTION OF THE FRONTISPIECE.

In front sits HISTORY, with her pen andtablet, making her records of human progress. Dc—
fore her lies the open book of THE PAST, full of her chronicles. Near her is a g1obe,.emb1em
of the theater of those achievements, whose memory she preserves. At her side is ART,
delineating a map of the New World, in which we live, with the word E:r:cclsz'o7- at the top,
meaning “more lofty”-—the destiny of our country. Upon a pedestal is a marble bustof
Franklin, under which was written, by a distinguished French statesman, “ He wrested the
thunder from heaven, and the sceptre from tyrants.” It indicates the perpetuity of the mem-
ory of the founders of our Republic, to be like that of marble. Above the group, just soaring,
is winged FAME, bearing a medallion likeness of Washington in one hand, and her trumpets
in the other. In the back ground is an unﬁnished Pyramid, emblematic of our Confederacy
of States, continually increasing, and adding block after block of imperishable material to
the wonderful structure, so high already as to overlook the nations of the earth. The
branches of the olive and oak, on either side, symbolize the peace which prevails within our
borders, and the st7'e7zgt/1. which it imparts.

Lord of Roanoke, the ﬁrst and last peerage created in America. Yet Manteo
could not avert nor control the storm that lowered among the Indian tribes, and
menaced the English with destruction. The colonists perceived that fearful
perils ‘were gathering, and White hastened to Englandtoward the close of the
year for reinforcements and provisions, leaving behind him h1S daughter, Eleanor
Dare (wife of one of his lieutenants), who had just given birth to a child
[August 18, 1587], whom they named Wrgdnta. VIRGINIA DARE was the first
offspring of English parents born within the territory of the United States.‘

26. When White reached England, the great Spanish Armada? was preparing
for an invasion of Great Britain; and Raleigh, Grenville, and others, were deeply
engaged in public affairs. It was not until the following
May [1589], that White departed, with two ships, for
Virginia. According to custom, he went by the way
of the West Indies, and depredated upon Spanish prop-
erty found aﬂoat. He was beaten in an engagement, lost‘
one of his vessels, and was obliged to return to England.
Raleigh’s fortune being materially impaired by his muniti-
cence in efforts at colonization, he assigned his proprietary
rights to others; and it was not until 1590 that White
was allowed to return to Roanoke in search of his daugh-
ter and the colony he had left. Both had then disap-
peared. Roanoke was a desolation; and, though Raleigh,
who had abandoned all thoughts of colonization, had ﬁve
times sent mariners, good and true, to search for the
emigrants, they were never found.3 Eighty years later,
the .00rees4 told the English settlers upon the Cape Fear
river, that their lost kindred had been adopted by the once
powerful Hatteras tribe,5 a.nd ‘became amalgamated with
the children of the wilderness. The English made no
1 further attempts at colonization at that time; and so, a
century after Columbus sailed for America, there was no European settlement
upon. the North American Continent. Sir Francis Drake had broken up the
military post at St. Augustine [1585], and the Red Men‘’’ were again sole masters
of the vast domain. . _ ' .

27. Twelve years after the failure of Ra1eigh’s colonization efforts, Bartholo-
mew Gosnold, who had been to America, and was a friend of the late pro-
[March 26, 1602] directly across the
Atlantic for the American coast. After a voyage of seven weeks, he discovered.
the continent near N ahant [May 14, 1602], and sailing southward, he landed
upon a sandy point which he named Cape Cod, on account of the great num-f

2. This was’ a great naval armament, ﬁtted out by Spain, for the invasion of England in the Summer
of 1588. It consisted of 150 ships. 2,650 great guns, and 30,000 soldiers and sailors. It was defeated
[July 20] by Admirals Drake and Howard.

3. While Raleigh was making these fruitless searches, the Marquis de la Roche, a wealthy French
nobleman, attempted to plant a French colony in America. He was commissioned by the King of
France for the purpose, and in 1598 sailed for America with a colony, chieﬂy drawn from. the prisons
of Paris. Upon the almost desert island of Sable, near the coast of Nova Scotia, La Roche left forty
men, while he returned to France for supplies. He died soon afterward, and for seven years the poor
emigrants were neglected. When a vessel was ﬁnally sent for them, only twelve survived. They were
taken to France, their crimes were pardoned by the king, and their immediate wants were supplied.

_tucket, Martha’s Vineyard, and the group known gas Elizabeth Islands. Upon

one of them, which he named Elizabeth, in honor of his sovereign, Gosnold and
his company prepared to found a’ settlement. Upon an islet, in a tiny lake,
they built a fort and store-house.‘ Becoming alarmed at the menaces of the
Indians and the want of supplies, they freighted their vessel with sassafras

roots, and returned to England. [June 1602.]
’ 28. The glowing accounts of the country which Gosnold gave, awakened the

enterprise of some Bristol merchants? and the following year [1603] they ﬁtted
out two vessels for the purposes of exploration and traffic with the natives.
The command was given to Martin Pring, a friend of both Raleigh and Gosnold.
Following the track of the latter, he discovered the shores of Maine, near the
mouth of the Penobscot [June], and coasting westward, he entered a.nd explored
several of the larger rivers of that state. He continued sailing along the coast
as far as Martha’s Vineyard, trading with the natives; and from that island
he returned to England, after an absence of only six months. Pring made
another voyage to Maine in 1606, and more thoroughly explored the country.
Maine was also visited in 1605, by Captain George Weymouth, who had ex-
plored the coast of Labrador in sea.rch of a north-west passage to India.3 He
entered the Sagadahock, and took formal possession of the country in the name
of King James. "He decoyed ﬁve natives on board his vessel, and then sailed
for England. These excited much curiosity, and the narratives of othermariners
of the West of England, who visited these regions at about the same time, gave
a new stimulus to colonizing efforts. g A

29. In 1603, De Monts, a wealthy French Huguenot,4 obtained a commission of
vice-royalty. over six degrees of latitude in New France,5 extending from Cape
May to Quebec. He prepared an expedition for settlement, and arrived at Nova
Scotia,5 with two vessels, in May 1604.7 He passed the Summer there, traﬂick-
ing with the natives; and in the Autumn he crossed over to the mouth of the St.
Croix, (the eastern boundary of‘ Maine,) and erected a fort there. He had left a
few settlers at Port Royal (now Annapolis) under Poutrincourt. These De Monts
joined the following Spring [I605], and organized a permanent colony. He
named the place Port Royal; and the territory now included in Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, and the adjacent Islands, he called ACADIE.8

30. On being deprived of his vice-royal commission in 1608, De Monts obtain-
ed a grant of the monoply of the fur-trade upon the St. Lawrence, for one year,
and a new commission to plant a colony elsewhere in New France. The new

expedition was placed under the command of Samuel Champlain, (who accom- '

panied the Viceroy on his ﬁrst voya-ge,) and on the third of June 1608 he ar-
rived, with two vessels, at the mouth of the Saguenay, on the St. Lawrence. They
ascended the great river, and on the site of Quebec, near where Cartier built his
fort almostseventy years before,9 they planted the ﬁrst permanent French settle-
ment in the New World. The following Summer, Champlain ascended the

Champlain and Poutrincourt. ‘

of the Virginia colony. He destroyed the remnant of De Monts’ settlement at St. Croix, broke up the

31. While the French were exploring, and making eiforts at settlement in the
direction of the St. Lawrence, the English were
not idle. Several ‘private enterpriseswere in pro-
gress, among the most important of which was
that of a company of London Merchants who sent
Henry Hudson, an intimate friend of Captain
Smith,4 to search for a supposed north-east ocean
passage to India. He made two unsuccessful
voyages to the regions of polar ice [1607——8], and
the attempt was abandoned. Anxious to win
the honor of ﬁrst reaching India by the northern
seas, Hudson applied to the Dutch East India
Company-5 for aid. The Amsterdam directors af-
forded it, and on the 4th of April, 1609, Hudson

the Capes of Virginia in August, 1609.

mouths of several large rivers, and ﬁnally passed

proceeded almost sixty leagues up the river that
bears his name, and, according to the formula of the
age, took possession of the country in the name of

at about the same time that Hudson went up the river that bears his name, as far as Waterford ; so that
these eminent navigators, exploring at diﬂerent points, came very near meeting in the wilderness. Six
years afterward, Champlain discovered Lake Huron, and there he joined some Huron Indians in an ex-
pedition against one of the Five Nations in Western New York. They had a severe battle in the neigh-
borhood of the present_village of Canandaigua. Champlain died in 1634. 6

lege of trading in the seas east of the Cape of Good Hope. This was the Dutch East India Company.

ENGLISH AND FRENCH DISCOVERIES. 48

North America had been thoroughly or partially explored, the general character
and resources of the soil had become known, and henceforth the leading com-
mercial nations of Western Europe—England, France, Spain and Holland——re-
garded the transatlantic continent, not as merely a rich garden without a wall,
Where depredators from every shore might come, and, without hindrance, bear
away its choicest fruit, but as a land where the permanent foundations of vast
colonial empires might be laid, from which parent states Would receive almost un-
limited tribute to national wealth and national glory. ,

When we contemplate these voyages across the stormy Atlantic, and consider
the limited geographical knowledge of the navigators, the frailty of their
vessels1 and equipments, the vast labors and constant privations endured by
them, and the dangers to which they were continually exposed, we cannot but

feel the highest respect and reverence for all who were thus engaged in opening .

the treasures of the New World to the advancing nations of Europe. Although
acquisitiveness, or the desire for worldly possessions, was the chief incentive to
action, and gave strength to resolution, yet it could not inspirecourage to en-
counter the great dangers of the deep and the Wilderness, nor ﬁll the heart with
faith in prophecies of success. These sentiments must have been innate; and
those who braved the multitude of perils were men of true courage, and their
faith came from the teachings of the science of their day. History and Song,
Painting and Sculpture, have all commemorated their deeds. If Alexander the
Great was thought worthy of having the granite body of Mount Athos hewn
into a colossal image of himself,2 might not‘ Europe and America appropriately
join in the labor of fashioning some lofty summit of the Alleghanies3 into ahugc
monument to the memory of the NAVIGATORS who lifted the veil of forgetfulness
from the face of the New World ?4

1. The ﬁrst ships were generally of less than one hundred tons burthen. Two of the vessels of Colum-
bus were without decks, and the one in which Frobisher sailed was of only twenty-ﬁve tons burthen.

so large that it might hold a city in its right hand, and in its left a basin of sutﬁcient capacity to hold
all the Waters that poured from the mountain. '

the honor, of ﬁrst discovering the continent of America. AMemoir of Sebastian Cabot, illustrated by
documents from the Rolls, published in London in 1832, appears to prove conclusively that he, and not
Izisfathcr, was the navigator who discovered North America. A little work entitled Researches re-
specting Americas Vespucius, and his Voyages, prepared by_Viscount Santarem, ex-prime minister of
Portugal, casts just doubts upon the statements of Vespucius, concerning his command on a. voyage of
discovery when, he claims, he discovered South America [verse 14, p. 29] in 1499. He was doubtless
an oiiicer under Ojeda ; and it is quite certain’ that he got possession of the narratives of Ojeda and pub-
lished them as his own. The most accessible works on American Discoveries, are Irving’s Life of Colum-
bus ; Prescott’s Ferdinand and Isabella ; Lives of Cabot and Hudson, in Sparks’s American Biogiraphg/,
and Histories of the United States by Bancroft and Hildreth.

SETTLEMENTS.

SECTION I.

1. The act of forming a settle-
ment is not equivalent to the estab-
lishmentof a colony or the found-
ing of a state. It is the initiatory
step towards such an end, and may
or may not exhibit permanent re-
sults. A colony becomes such only
When settlements assume permae

JOHN SMITH, A nency, and organic laws, subserVi- '

ent to those of a parent govern-
ment,‘ are framed for the guidance of the people. It seems proper, therefore, to
consider the era of sezftlememfs as distinct from that of colonial organization.

2. The period of settlements Within the bounds of the thirteen original colonies
Which formed the Confederacy in the War for Independence,1 extends from
1607 to 1733. For ﬁfty years previous to the debarkation [1607] at James-
toWn,‘3 ﬁshing stations had been established at various points on the Atlantic
coast; and at St. Augustine,3 the Spaniards had kept a sort of military post

alive.‘ Yet the time‘ of the appearance of the English in the James River, is the
true point from which to date the inception or beginning of our great confeder-
acy of free States. 1

3. Twelve years [1607 to 1619] were spent by English adventurers in efforts
to plant a permanent settlement in Virginia} For seventeen years [1609 to
1623] Dutch traders were trafficking on the Hudson River, before a permanent
settlement was established in New York}? Fourteen years [1606 to 1620] were
necessary to effect a permanent settlement in Massachusetts;3 and for nine
years [1622 to 1631] -adventurers struggled for a foot-hold in New Hampshire.4
The Roman Catholics were only one year [1634-5] in laying thelfoundation of
the Maryland colony.5 ’ Seven years [1632 to 1639] were employed in effecting
permanent settlements in Connecticut ,6 eight years [1636 to 1643] in organizing
colonial [government in Rhode Island;7 and about ﬁfty years [1631 to 1682]
elapsed from the landing of the Swedes on South R.iver,8 before Delaware, New
Jersey, and Pennsylvania, (whose several histories of settlements_are inter-
woven) presented colonial features.9 Almost sixty years [1622 to 1680] passed
by before the ﬁrst settlements in the Carolinas became fully-developed colonies ,1“
but Georgia, the youngest of the thirteen states had the foundations of ' its
colonial government laid when Oglethorpe, with the ﬁrst company of settlers,
began to build Savannah in the winter of 1733.11 The first permanent settle-
ment within the bounds of the original colonies, Was in

VIRGINIA. [1607-1619.]

4. Before the lapse of a century after the discoveries of Columbus [1492],1‘»3
a great socialand political revolution had been effected in Europe. Commerce,
hitherto” conﬁned to inland seas and along the coasts, was sending its ships
across oceans. The art of printing had begun its Wonderful work;13 and,
through its instrumentality, intelligence had become generally diffused. Mind
thus acting upon mind in vastly multiplied opportunities, had awakened a great

_moral and intellectual power, whose presence and strength had not been sus-

pected. The Protestant Reformation” had weakened the bonds of spiritual

dominion, a.nd allowed the moral faculties fuller play; and the shadows of feudal.

institutions,15 so chilling to individual effort, were rapidly disappearing before
the rising sun of the new era in the history of the world. ‘

. 13. About the year 1450. Rude printing from engraved blocks was done before that time ; but when
Peter Schoeffer cast the ﬁrst metal types, each letter separately, at about 1450, the art of printing truly
had birth. John Faust established a printing olﬁce at Mentz, in 1442. John Guttenburg invented cut
metal types, and used them in printing ‘a Bible which was commenced in 1445, and ﬁnished in 1460.
The names of these three men are usually associated as the inventors of printing.

14. Commenced by.Wicl:liﬂ“e, in England, in 1360; by Huss, in Bohemia, in 1405; by Luther, in
Germany, in 1517. From this period until 1562, the movement was general throughout Europe. It was
an effort to purge the Christian Church of great impurities, by reforming its doctrine and ritual. The
Reformers protested against the practices of the Roman Catholic Church, and the title of the move-
ment Was, therefore, the Protestant Reformation. The name of Protestants was ﬁrst given to Luther
and others, in 1529. . 1
, 15. The nature of feudal laws may be illustrated by a single example: William, the Norman Con-
queror of England, divided the land of that country into parts called baronies, and gave them to certain
of his ‘favorites, who became masters of the conquered people on their respective estates. For these
gifts, and certain privileges, the barons, or masters, were to furnish the king with a stipulated amount
of money, and-a stated number of men for soldiers, when required. The people had no voice in this mat-
ter, nor in any public affairs, and were made essentially slaves to the barons. Out of this state of things
originated the exclusive privileges yet enjoyed by the nobility of Europe. Except in Russia, the people
have been emancipated from this vassalage, and the ancient forms of feudal power have disappeared.

5. Freedom of thought and action expanded the area of ideas, and gave birth:
to those tolerant principles which lead to brotherhood of feeling. The new im- .-

pulse developed nobler motives for human action than the acquisition of wealth
and power, and these soon engendered healthy schemes for founding industrial
empires in the New World. Aspirations for civil freedom, awakened by greater
religious liberty, had begun thework, especially in England, where the Protest-
ants were already divided into two distinct parties, called, respectively, Church-
men and Puritans. The former supported the throne and all monarchic ideas;
the latter Were more republican; and from their pulpits went forth doctrines
inimical to kingly power. These religious differences had begun to form a basis
of political parties, and ﬁnally became prime elements of colonization.

6. A long contest between England and France ceased in 1604. Soldiers, an
active, restless class in England, were deprived of employment, and would soon
become dangerous to the public peace. While population and general prosperity
had greatly increased, there was another large class, who, by idleness and dissi-
pation, had souandered fortunes. and had become desperate men. The soldiers
needed employment, either in their own art, or in equally exciting adventures;
and the impoverished spendthrifts were ready for any thing which promised
gain. Such were the men who stood ready to brave ocean perils and the greater
dangers of the Western World, when such minds as those of Fernando Gorges,

Bartholomew Gosnold, Chief-Justice Popham, Richard Hakluyt, Captain John

Smith, and others, devised new schemes for colonization. The weak and timid
J ames_tl1e First,‘ who desired and maintained peace with other nations during
his reign, was glad to perceive a new ﬁeld for restless and adventurous men to go
to, and he readily granted a liberal patenti[April 20, 1606] to the first company
formed after his accession to the throne, for planting settlements in Virginia.

7. ‘The English claimed dominion over a-belt of territory extending from Cape‘

Fear, in North Carolina, ..to Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and indeﬁnitely westward.

This _was divided into two districts. One extended from the vicinity of N ew~

York city northward to the present southern boundary of Canada, including the

whole of New England, and westward of it, and was called NORTH VIRGINIA;

This territory was granted to a company of “knights, gentlemen and merchants”

’ in the west of" England, called the Plymouth Oompomg/.9 The other district ex-.

tended from the mouth of the Potomac southward to Cape Fear, and was called

SOUTH VIRGINIA. It was granted .to a company of “noblemen, gentlemen and,

merchants,” chieﬂy residents of London, called the London Oompam/.3 The
intermediate domain of almost two hundred" miles, was a dividing line, so broad
that disputes about territory could not occur, as neither company was allowed
to make settlements more than ﬁfty miles beyond its own boundary._ A
8. The political character of this ﬁrst colonial charter, under which a perma-
nent settlement was made within the territory of the United States, was unfavor-
able to the best interests of all. The king reserved to himself the right of ap-
pointing all officers, and of exercising all executive and legislative power. The

colonists were to pay homage to the sovereign, and a tribute of one-fifth of the
net’ products of gold and silver found in Virginia; yet they possessed no rights
of self-government. They were to be governed by a council of seven appointed
by the king, who were allowed to choose a president from among themselves.
There was also a Supreme Council in England, appointed by the king, who had

the general supervision of the colonies, under the direction of the monarch. i

That charter was the conception of a narrow mind and despotic temper, and
proved totally inadequate as a constitution of government for a free people.

9, The Plymouth Company made the ﬁrst attempt at settlement, and failed}
The London Company sent Captain Christopher Newport with three vessels, a.nd
one hundred and ﬁve emigrants [Dec. 1606], to make a settlement upon Roan-
oke Island.2 -, Among them was Bartholomew Gosnold,3 the projector of the
expedition. ""They presented very poor materials for a colony. There was no
family among them, and only “twelve laborers and a few mechanics,-” The
remainder were “gentlemen,” many of whom were vicious, dissolute men,

. totally unﬁt for such an enterprise, and quite unworthy to be actors in the glo-

rious events anticipated by Gosnold and his enlightened associates at home.

10. Newport pursued the old route by the Canaries and the West Indies, _and -

did not arrive upon the American coast until April, 1607, when a storm drove
his vessels into Chesapeake Bay, where he found a good harbor. He named the
capes at the entrance, Charles and Henry, in honor of the king’s sons. The
noble river which he soon afterwards entered he called James. Sailing up the

broad stream about ﬁfty miles, the immigrants landed upon a beautiful shaded.

peninsula,5 where they chose a site for the capital of the new empire, and called
it J AMESTOWN.

11. Disputes had arisen during the long voyage. As the silly king had placed
the names of the colonial council in a sealed box, with instructions not to open
it until their arrival in Virginia, there was no competent authority on board to
restore harmony. Captain Smith,5 who was the most able man among them,
excited the envy of his companions; and being charged with a design to mur-
der the council, usurp government, and proclaim himself king, he was placed in
conﬁnement. On opening the sealed box, it was discovered that Smith was one

‘of the council. He was released from conﬁnement, but excluded from ofﬁce.

He demanded a trial upon the absurd charges. The accusation was withdrawn,
and-he took his seat in the council, over which the avaricious Edward Maria
Wingﬁeld was chosen to preside.

12. Newport, Smith, and twenty others, ascended the James River to the Falls
at Richmond, and visited the emperor of the Powhatans,7 whose residence was

_a mile below the foot of the rapids. The title‘ of the Emperor was Powhatan.

He was a man of great ability, and commanded the reverence of the whole con-
federation. He was friendly to the English, notwithstanding his people mur-
mured at their presence; and the visitors returned to Jamestown much grati-
ﬁed. ’

spent their lives i_n idleness and dissipation ; a class which, in our day and country, number, happily,

48 SETTLEMENTS.

13. Newport sailed for England in June, 1607, for more settlers and pro-
visions. The little band of emigrants soon perceived the perils of their situation...
A large portion of their provisions was spoiled during the voyage. "They ha.d
not planted, therefore they could not reap. The neighboring tribes evinced hos-
tility, and withheld supplies. Poisonous vapor arose from the marshes; and
before the close of Summer, one half of the adventurers perished by disease and
famine. Among the victims was Gosnold. In the midst of their despondency,
the survivors discovered that president Wingﬁeld was living on choice stores,
and was preparing to abandon the colony and escape to the West Indies in_the
pinnace’ left by Newport. He was deposed. Ratclilfe, a weak and wicked
man, was chosen his successor. He, too, wa.s speedily dismissed; and the
settlers, with one consent, wisely turned to Smith as ruler. . ‘

14. All was confusion when Smith became President. He soon restored
order, and by his courage and energy, inspired the Indians with awe, and com-
pelled them to bring him supplies of food. In October, wild game became plen-
tiful; and at the beginning of November, the abundant harvest of Indian corn
was gathered by the natives, and .they supplied the settlers with all they needed.
Having established a degree of comfort and prosperity, Smith started, with some
companions, to. explore the surrounding country. He ascended the Chickahomminy
river, ﬁfty miles from its mouth, and then, with. two companions, penetrated the
vast forest that covered the land. Smith’s companions were slain by the natives,

.. and he was made a captive. After being exhib-
ited in several villages, he Was taken to Opechan-
canough,2 the eldest brot-her of Powhatan, who,
regarding Smith as a superior being, spared
his life, and conducted him to the emperor,

then at Weroworomoco, on the York RiVer.3
A solemn council decided that the captive
must die, and Smith was led out to execu-
tion. His head was placed upon a stone, and
the heavy clubs of the executioners were raised
to crush it, when Pocahontas, a child of “ten or
twelve years,”4 the favorite daughter of Pow-
hatan, rushed from her father’s side, and casting
herself upon the captive, besought the king to
spare his life. Powhatan consented, and Smith
was conducted in safety to Jamestown by a
,.oGAHoNmS_ guard of twelve men, after an absence of seven
“ weeks. ~ '

 

15. Smith’s captivity was a public beneﬁt. He had acquired a knowledge  .

the Indian character, and of the country and its resources, and also had formed
friendly relations with the sachems "and chiefs. Had his companions possessed
half as much energy and-honesty as Smith, all would have been well. But they
were idle, improvident, and dissolute. He found everything in disorder on his
return. Only forty men were living, and a greater portion of them "were on the
point of escaping to the West Indies in the pinnace; but the courage and
energy of Smith compelled them to remain.  '

VIRGINIA. . 49

16. Early in 1608 Newport arrived with supplies, and one hundred and twenty
immigrants. These were no better than the ﬁrst adventurers. Instead of agri-
culturalists and mechanics, with families, they were idle “gentlemen,’: “packed
hither,”,as Smith said, “by their friends, to escape ill destinies.” There were
also several goldsmiths, the ‘very men least needed in the colony. Some glitter-
ing earth in the vicinity of J amestown,1 was mistaken for gold; and in spite of
the remonstrances of Smith, the whole industry of the colony was directed to the
supposed treasure. “There was no talk, no hope, no work, but dig gold, work
gold, ~ref1pe gold, load gold.” Newport loaded his vessel with ‘the worthless
earth and returned to England, believing himself exceedingly rich. Science pro-
nounced him miserably poor in useful knowledge and well-earned reputation.

17. Smith remonstrated against idleness, and pleaded for industry, but in vain.
He implored the settlers to plow and sow, that they might reap and be happy.
They refused to listen, and he "turned from Jamestown with disgust. With a.
few sensible men, he went to explore the Chesapeake-in an open boat. He went
up the Potomac to the falls above Washington cityjf He entered the Patapsco,
and ate". Indian corn on the site of Baltimore. He up the Susquehannah to
the beautiful vale of Wyoming? He penetrated the forests even to the territory
of the Five Nations,3 and established friendly relations with the dusky tribes.
Within three months he travelled three thousand miles. It _was one of the most
wonderful of exploring expeditions, considered in all its aspects, ever recorded

by the pen of history.‘ The map of the country which Smith constructed on his .

return, is yet in existence in England, and is remarkable for its general accu-
racy. 
18. Three days after Smith’s return [Sept. 10, 1608], he was formally" made

. president of the settlement. Newport arrived soon afterward, with seventy im-

migrants, among whom were two females, the ﬁrst English women seen upon
the James river.4 Smith exerted all his energies to turn the little industry of
the settlers to agriculture, and succeeded, in a degree. He wrote to the Supreme

Council-5 to send over a different class of men. “I entreat you,” he said,- “rather ‘

send but thirty carpenters, husbandmen, gardeners, ﬁshermen, blacksmiths, ma-

‘sons, and diggers of trees’ roots, well provided, than a thousand such as we
have.” Yet, with all his exertions, idleness and improvidence prevailed. At .

the end of two years from the ﬁrst landing at J amesto’wn,5 and when the settle-

_ ment numbered two hundred strong men, not more than forty acres were under

cultivation; and to the Indians the white ‘people were compelled to look for their
chief supply of food.
19. The anticipations of sudden wealth, indulged in by the London Company,7

were not realized, and they sought and obtained a new charter [June 2, 1609], '

which gave them more ample privileges. The territory of SOUTH VIRGINIA3 was
extended northward to the head of the Chesapeake. The Supreme Council was

vested with power to ﬁll vacancies in its own body, and to appoint a governor’

for Virginia, whose rule was made absolute. The lives, liberties, and property
of the settlers were at his disposal. They were compelled to contribute a certain
share of their earnings to the proprietors, and were mere vassals at will, under a
petty despotism. '

INTRODUCTORY OBSERVATIONS.

Bet‘ore commencing the preparation of the following pages, I carefully examined the vari-
ous small histories of the United States in use, noted their obvious excellences and defects,
and endeavored to learn what was needed in the arrangement of a plan more attractive and
efficient for instructing the young people of our country in its wonderful story, tha11 had been
hitherto employed. Using the best results of the labors of others in this special ﬁeld, for a
foundation, I have constructed this volume of materials taken from the earlier, most elaborate
and most reliable historians of our continent, on a plan which I believe will be found, by in-
structors and pupils, to possess superior advantages as an easy and thorough method for teach-
ing and acquiring an accurate general knowledge of events relating to the birth and growth of
our Republic. _ _ '

The work is arranged in six chapt.ers, each containing the records of an important period.
The ﬁrst exhibits a general view of the ﬂboriginal race who occupied the continent when the
Europeans came. The second is a record of all the Discoveries and preparations for settle-
ment, made by individuals and governments. The third delineates the progress of all the Set-
tlements ‘until colonial governments were formed. The fourth tells the story of these Colonies
from their infancy to maturity, and illustrates the continual development of democratic ideas
and republican tendencies which _ﬁnally resulted in a political confederation. The ﬁfth has a
full account of the important events of the War for Independence, and the sixth gives a con-
cise history of the Republic, from its formation to the present time.

I have endeavored to show the cause of every important event, and thus, by developing the .

philosophy of our history, to make it more attractive and instructive than a bald record of
facts. And wherever the text appeared to need further elucidation, I have given additional
facts in foot-notes. These, may be proﬁtably consulted by teacher and pupil, for they will
greatly aid them in obtaining a clear understanding of the subject.

The system of concordance interwoven with the foot-notes throughout the entire work, is of
great importance to instructor and learner. When a fact is named which bears a. relation to
another fact elsewhere recorded in the volume, a reference is made to the verse and page
where such fact is mentioned. Aknowledge of this relationship of separate events.is often
essential to a clear view of the subject, and without this concordance, a great deal of time
would he spent in searching for that relationship. With the concordance the matter may be
found in a moment. Favorable examples of the utility of this new feature may be found on
page 84. If strict attention shall be given to these references, the whole subject will be pre-
sented to the mind of the student, in a comprehensive aspect of unity not to be given by any
other method. It will greatly lessen the labors of the teacher, and facilitate the progress of
the learner. '

To economize space and prevent confusion, the dates have been put in brackets in their
proper places in the text. VVhen the volume shall be used as a reading book, these inclosed
ﬁgures may easily be omitted. So with the references: they may be passed without notice;
and by these omissions the sentences will appear unbroken. The questions are few, and
are suggestive and comprehensive. They are so constructed that the student will be com-
pelled to acquire a thorough knowledge of the subject under consideration before a correct
answer to the question can be given. Much of this part of the labor is left to the judgment
of the teacher.

The engravings are introduced not for the sole purpose of embellishing the volume, but to
enhance its utility as an instructor. Every picture is intended "to illustrate a fact, not merely
to beautify a page. Great care has been taken to secure accuracy in all the delineations of men
and things, so that they may not convey false instruction. Geographical maps have been omit-
ted, because they must necessarily be too small to be of essential service. History should
never be studied without the aid of an accurate Atlas.

- With these few observations concerning the general plan of this work, I submit the volume
to the public, willing to have its reputation rest upon its own merits.

I  SE’1"1‘LEMEN'1‘S.

20. Lord De la Warr (Delaware), an enlightened peer, was appointed governor
of Virginia, for life, under the new charter; and soo11 afterward Newport sailed
for America. [June 12, 1609], with nine ships, and more than ﬁve hundred’ emi-
grants.‘ ‘Sir Thomas Grates, the governor’s deputy, sailed with N ewpo_rt, accom-
panied by Sir George Somers. Grates, Newport, and Somers, were commissioned
to administer the government until the arrival of Delaware. When near the
coast, a liurricanedispersed the ﬂeet, and the vessel bearing’ the commissioners
was wrecked on one of the Bermuda Islands. Seven vessels of the squadron
reached the James river in safety.

21. A greater portion of the new immigrants were more proﬂigate, if possible,‘
than the ﬁrst. They were dissolute scions of wealthy families, and many of them

came to avoid punishment for crimes at home. They regarded Virginia as a
paradise for libertines, and believed the colony to be without a head until the
arrival of the governor or his deputy. Smith, on the contrary, boldly asserted
his authority as president, and maintained it until an accident in Autumn com-
pelled him to go to England for surgical aid,9 when he delegated his authority to
George Percy, brother of the duke of Northumberland.

22. Released from the control of Smith, the settlers now gave themselves up
to every irregularity of life. Their ample stock of provisions was rapidly con-
sumed. The Indians had greatrrjespect for Smith, and were friendly. After his
departure, they openly sh'o'we‘d their contempt for the English, withheld supplies
of provisions, and conceived a plan for the total extermination of the white intru-
ders. Famine ensued, and the winter and spring of 1610 were long remembered
as “the starving time.” Those who went’ to the cabins of the Indians were
murdered, and ﬁnally a plan was matured by the natives for striking a blow of
utter extermination. Again Pocahontas performed the part of a guardian angel.3
On a dark and stormy night she hastened to Jamestown, revealed the plot, and
saved the colony by placing them, on their guard. -

23. The horrors of destitution increased, and the settlement of ﬁve hundred,

persons, when Smith left, was reduced to sixty within six months after his de-
parture. The commissioners4 constructed a rude vessel upon the barren ‘island
where‘ they were wrecked, and in it reached Virginia in June, 1610. Instead
of being. greeted by a ﬂourishing people, they were met by a mere remnant,
almost famished. Grates determined to sail immediately for N ewfoundland,-5 and
distribute the immigrants among the English ﬁshing vessels there. Jamestown
was utterly abandoned, and toward Hampton Roads5 the dejected settlers sailed

in four pinnaces. Early the next morning white sails greeted their visions. Lord.

Delaware had arrived’ with provisions -and immigrants; and that very night,
Jamestown, abandoned to pagans in the morning, was made vocal with hymns
of thanksgiving to the true God, by the returned settlers. - A 2

24. Lord Delaware was a virtuous and prudent man, and under his adminis-"

tration the colony began to prosper. Failing health compelled him to return to
England the following spring [March, 1611] ; and he left the government in the

'1. Domestic animals were new first taken to Virginia. They consisted of 6 mares, 1 horse, 600 swine,

a few sheep and goats, and 500 domestic fowls. Two years later 100 cows and some other cattle were

brought over. - . -
2. While passing down the James river, in a boat, from the Falls, Smith’s bag of powder ignited, and
the explosion almost killed him. His wounds were so severe as to require the most skillful suijgeijy.

hands of Percy, Smith’s successor, who managed with prudence until the arrival
of Sir Thomas Dale, with supplies.‘ Dale was an experienced soldier, and,
assuming the government, he ruled by martial law. Early in September follow-
ing, Sir Thomas Gates arrived with six well-furnished ships, and three hundred
immigrants. A large portion of them were sober, industrious men, and their
arrival gave great joy to the four hundred colonists at Jamestown. Gates
assumed the functions of governor, and Dale went up the river to plant new set-
tlements at the mouth of the Appomattox and near the Falls? *

25. A wise change in the domestic policy was now made. Hitherto the land
had been worked in common, and the product of labor was deposited in public
storehouses, for the good of the community. The industrious created food for
the indolent, and an incentive to effort was wanting. It was found in the
assignment of a few acres of land to each man, to be cultivated for his own pri-
vate benefit. This regulation gave a powerful impulse to ‘industry. Larger
assignments were made, and soon the community system was abandoned, and
industry on priva.te account created an ample supply of food for all.3

26. The London Company4 obtained a third charter in 1612 [March 22], by
which the control of the king was annulled. The Supreme Council was abol-
ished, and the whole company, sitting as a democratic assembly, elected the
officers, and ordained the laws, for the colony. Yet no political privilege was
granted to the ‘settlers. They had no voice in the choice of rulers and the enact-
ment of laws. But they were contented; and at the beginning of 1613 there
were a thousand Englishmen in Virginia. .

2'7. At about this time an event occurred which proved of permanent beneﬁt
to the settlement. Powhatan had continued to manifest hostile feelings ever
since the departure of Smith. Under pretence of extorting advantageous terms
of peace from the Indian king, Captain Argall (a sort of buccaneer),5 at the
head of a foraging party, stole Pocahontas, and carried her on board his vessel.
A mutual attachment grew up‘ between the maiden and John Rolfe, a young
Englishman of good family, before she was released. He instructed her in let-
ters and religion; and, with the consent of Powhatan, she received the rite of
Christian‘ baptism, and becamethe wife of Rolfe in April, 1613. This union
brought peace, and Powhatan was everafterward the friend of the English.

28. The settlement now prospered remarkably, yet the elements of a perma-
nent state. were "wanting. There were no families in Virginia, and all the
settlers indulged in anticipations of returning to England. Gates went home

in March, 1614, leaving the administration of government with Sir Thomas

Dale, who ruled with wisdom and energy for about two years, and then de-
parted, after appointing George Yeardley deputy-governor. During Yeardley’s
administration, the culture of the tobacco plant5 was promoted, and so rapidly

6. This plant, yet very extensively cultivated in Virginia and adjoining States, was ﬁrst. discovered
by Sir Francis Drake, near Tabaco, in Yucatan 2 hence its name. Drake and Raleigh first introduced
it into England. King James conceived a great hatred of it, and wrote a treatise against its use. He

forbade its cultivation in England, but could not prevent its importation from Virginia. It became a‘
very proﬁtable article of commerce, and the streets of Jamestown were planted with it. Other agricul-

tural productions were neglected, and while cargoes of tobacco were preparing for England, the neces-
saries of life were Wanting. The money value of tobacco was about 66 cents a pound.

did it gain in favor, that it soon became not only the principal article of export,
but the currency of the colony.‘ . .

29. Argall, the buccaneerﬁ was appointed deputy-governor in 1617. He wa.s
a despot in feelings and practice, and soon disgusted the people. He was suc-
ceeded by Yeardley, who wasappointed governor in 1619; and now dawned
the natal morning of Virginia as a Republican State. Yeardley abolished mar-
tial law, released the planters from feudal service to the colony,3 and established
representative government.4 The settlement was divided into eleven boroughs,
and two representatives, called burgesses, were chosen by the people for each.
These, with the governor and council, constituted the colonial government.
The burgesses were allowed to debate all matters pertaining to the good of the
colony, but their enactments were not legal until sanctioned by the company in
England. ~

30. On the 28th of June, 1619, the ﬁrst representative assembly ever con-
vened in America, met at Jamestown. Then and there, the foundations of the
VIRGINIA commonwealth were laid. The people now began to regard Virginia
as their home, and “fell to building houses and planting corn.” Within two
years afterward, one hundred and ﬁfty reputable young women were sent over
to becomes wives to the planters.5 The tribe of gold-seekers and “gentleman”
was extinct, for “it was not the will of God that the new State should be
formed of such material; that such men should be the fathers of a progeny born
~o_n: the American soil, whovvere one day to_ assert American liberty by their
eloquence, and defend it by their va.lor.”6, '

'1.‘ On his return to England [N ov. 1609], Henry Hudson forwarded to his
employers in Amsterdam,7 a brilliant account of his discoveries in America.
J ealous of the maritime enterprise. and growing power of the Dutch, the British
king would -not allow Hudson to go to Holland, fearing hemight be employed
in making further discoveries, or in planting settlements in America. This nar-
row and selﬁsh policy of James was of no avail, for the ocean pathway to new
and fertile regions, once opened, could easily be traversed by inferior navigators.

2. In 1610, some wealthy merchants of Amsterdam, directors of the Dutch

, East India Company,8 sent a ship from the Texel, laden with merchandise, to.

trafﬁc with the Indians upon the Mauritius,9 as the present Hudson river was .

then ‘called. Hudson’s ship (the Half-Moon 10) was also sent hither the same
year. on a like errand; and for three years afterward, private enterprise dis-
patched many vessels from Holland, to traffic for furs and peltries. Among
other commanders came the bold Adrian Block, the ﬁrst navigator of the dan-

4. Yeardley found the people possessed with an intense desire‘ for that freedom which the English
constitution gave to every subject of the realm, and it was impossible to reconcile that feeling with the

gerous strait in the East river called I-Iell-Grate. Block’s vessel was accidentally
burned in the autumn of 1613, when he and his companions erected some rude

‘huts for shelter, near the site of Bowling Green, in New York. These huts

formed the germ of our great commercial metropolis. During the winter they
constructed a vessel’ from the ﬁne timber which grew upon Manhattan Island,
and early in the spring sailed up Long Island Sound on a voyage of discovery
which extended to N ahant. - '

3. Dutch trading vessels now frequently ascended the Mauritius, and a brisk
trade was opened with the Indian tribes, almost two hundred miles from the
ocean. The traders built a fort and storehouse upon a little island just below
Albany [1614], which they called Fort Nassau; and nine years later, Fort

Orange was erected on the site of Albany. There is a. doubt about a fort being-

erected on the southern extremity of Manhattan island, at this time.

4. In the autumn of 1614 [October 11], a special charter was granted to a com-
pany of Amsterdam merchants, giving them the monopoly of trade in the New
‘World, from the latitude of Cape May, to that -of Nova Scotia, for three years.
The territory was named NEW N ETHERLAND, in the charter, which title it held
until it became an English province in 1664.1 Notwithstanding it was included
in the grant of James to the Plymouth congpanyﬂ no territorial jurisdiction being
claimed, and no English settlements having been made northward of Richmond,
in Virginia, the Dutch were not disturbed in their traffic. The popular ‘story,
that Argall entered the Bay of New York on his return from Acadie in 1613,3

" and made the Dutch traders promptly surrender the place to the English crown,

.,.ﬂed to Holland), arrived, under the charge of Cornelius
- Jacobsen May, who was sent to reside in New Nether’-'

- Albany; the remainder chose their place of abode across

seems unsusceptible of proof.4

5. The trade in furs and peltries became very lucrative, and the company
made an unsuccessful application for a renewal of their charter. More extensive
operationswere in contemplation; and in 1621, [June 3], the States General of
Holland5 incorporated the Dutch West India Ooimpdng/, and invested it with
almost regal powers, for planting settlements in America from Cape Horn to New-
foundland; and in Africa, between the Cape of Good Hope and the Tropic of
Cancer. The special object of its enterprise was New N etherland, andespecially
the region of the Mauritius.“ The company was not completely organized until
the spring of 1623, when it commenced operations with vigor. .

6. The ﬁrst effort put forth by the compa.ny, was to plant a permanent colony,
and thus establish a plausible pretext for territorial juris- ‘
diction, for now the English had built rude cabins on the
shores of Massachusetts Bay.7 In April [1623], thirty
families, chieﬂy Wallooris (French Protestants who had

MASSACHUSETTS. [1606-1620.]

1. The PLYMOUTH COMPANY3 despatched an agent to examine North Vir-
ginia, soon after obtaining their charter [August 22 1606]. His vessel was
captured by a Spanish cruiser. Another, commanded by Martin Pring, was sent,
and reached America. Pring conﬁrmed the accounts of Gosnold and others,4 con-
cerning the beauty and fertility of the New England region.- The following
year [1607],~ George Pop11am5 came, with one hundred immigrants, and la.nding at
the mouth of the Sagadahoc or Kennebeck [August 21], they erected a small
Stockade, a store house, and a few huts. All but forty-ﬁve returned to England
in the vessels; those remained, and named their settlement St. George. A
terrible winter ensued. Fire consumed their store-house and some of their pro-
visions, and the keen frosts and deep snows locked the waters and the forests
against the ﬁsherman and hunter. Famine menaced them, but relief came before
any were made victims. Of all the company, only Popham, their president,
died. Lacking courage to brave the perils of the wilderness, the settlement was
abandoned, and the immigrants went back to England [1608] at the very time
when‘ the Frenchmen, who were to build Quebec,5 were upon the ocean.

Trafﬁc with the Indian tribes was continued, but Settlements were not again at-

tempted for several yearS.7

2. The interior of the country, now called NEW ENGLAND, was an unknown
land, until Capt. John Smith, with the mind of a philosopher and the courage
of a hero, came [1614] and explored, not only the coasts, but the rivers which
penetrated the wilderness. Only himself and four London merchants had an
interest in the expedition, which proved highly successful not only in dis-
coveries, but in trade. .lNith only eight men, Smith examined the region be-
tween Ca.pe Cod and the Penobscot, constructed a_ map of the country, and after
a.n absence of less than seven months, he returned to England, and laid a report
before prince Charles, the heir apparent to the throne. The prince, delighted
with the whole account, conﬁrmed the title which Smith had given to the terri-
tory delineated on the map, and it was named NEW ENGLAND. Crime, as

governed by Earls, who were subject to the crown, however. These districts were called counties, and
_1e name 1S still retained, even in the United States, and indicates certain judicial and other jurisdiction.
New Netherl-and was constituted a county of Holland, having all the individual privileges appertaining
to an earldom, or separate government. The armorial distinction of an earl, or count, was a kind of cap,

and of one of the grand objects of settlement there, the trade in furs.

vessels of the expedition, kidna.pped twenty seven of the Indians, with Squanto,l

them into slavery? And now, at various points from Florida to Newfoundland,

men-stealers of different nations, ha.d planted the seeds of hatred and distrust,3

whose fruits, in after years, were wars, and complicated troubles. ,
3. The following year, the Plymouth company employed Smith, to make
further explorations in America and to plant a colony. He sailed in the Spring

. [1615], but was driven back by a tempest. He sailed again on the 4th of July.

His crew became mutinous, and ﬁnally his vessel was captured by a French
pirate, and they were all taken to France. Smith escaped to England, in an
open boat, and arousing the sluggish energies of the Plymouth company and
others, they planned vast schemes of colonization, and he was made admiral for
life. Eager for gains, some of the members, joining with others, applied for a
new charter. It was withheld for a long time. Finally, the king granted a
charter [November 3, 1620] to forty of the wealthiest and most powerful men in
the realm, who assumed the corporate title of THE COUNCIL or PLYMOUTH,

and superseded the original PLYMOUTH G0MPANY.4 ' The vast domain of more

than a million of square miles, lying between the 40th and 48th degree of north
latitude, and westward to the South Sea,5 was conveyed to them, as absolute
owners of the soil. It was the finest portion of the continent, and now embraces
the most ﬂourishing States and Territories of our cohfederacy.

4... This vast monopoly was unpropitious, in all its elements, to the founding
of an empire. It was not the will of God that mere speculators and mercenary

‘adventurers like these should people this broad land. The same year when that
‘great commercial monopoly was formed [1620],’a company of devout men and
women inHolland, who had been driven from England by a persecuting govern- .

ment, came to the wilderness of the New World, not to seek gold and return,
but to erect a tabernacle, where they might worship the Great God in honest
simplicity and freedom, and to plant in the wilderness the foundation of a com-
monwealth, based upon truth and justice. Who were they ? Let History
answer. .

5. Because the pope of Rome would not sanction one of the most ﬂagrant of
his Social crimes, Henry the Eighth of England deﬁed the authority of the head
of the Ohurch,6 and by the Act of Sap’remacy,7 Parliament also cast off the papal
yoke. The people were not beneﬁted, for the king was pope of Great Britain,
and they were his slaves. They enjoyed no religious freedom. Heresy was a
high crime; and expressions of freedom ,of thought and opinion were not toler-
ated. The doctrines and rituals of the Romish church were enforced, while the
autlzowlty of the pope was denied. The people discovered that in exchanging
spiritualmasters, they had gained nothing, except that the thunders of excom-

ward emancipation was gained.

6.‘ Henry’s son, Edward, established a more liberal Pro-
testantism in England [I574], and soon the followers of
Luther and Calvin? drew the tangible line of doctrinal differ~
ence which existed between them. The former retained or
allowed many of the ceremonials of the church of Rome;
the latter were more austere, and demanded extreme sim-

became honorable. VV-hen Parliament established a liturgy
for the church, the Puritans refused conformity, for they,
acknowledged no authority but the Bible in matters of
religion. They became a distinct and inﬂuential pa.rty in
the State [l.550], and were specially commended by the
continental reformers.

 7. In 1553, the persecuting queen Mary3 re-established

 

peril. The ﬁres of persecution were lighted, and the ﬁrst
Protestant.martyrs were consumed at the stake.4 She
was succeeded by her half-sister, Elizabeth [1558], a professed Protestant, and
the flames were extinguished. Elizabeth was no Puritan. She endeavored to
reconcile the magniﬁcent rituals of the Romish Church with the simple requisi-
tions of the gospel. There was no afﬁnity, and trouble ensued. The Puritans,
struggling for power, asserted, in all its g ‘andeur, the doctrine of private judg-
ment in religious matters, and of untrammelled religious liberty. From this
high position, it was but a step to the broad rock of civil freedom. The Puri-
tan pulpits became the tribunes of the common people, and the preachers often
prom_ulgated the doctrine, that the sove7*ez'gn was ame72.abZe to pztblte optnton when
fcm'7‘Zy expressed. The jealousy and the fears of the queen were aroused; and
after several years of effort, the Thz'7‘ty-Nine Articles of belief, which constitute the
rule of faith in the church of England, were confirmed [1571] by an Act of
Parliament.

8. In 1583 a court of high commission was established, for the detection a.nd
punishment of N on-Conformists,5 with powers almost as absolute as the Roman
Inquisition. Persecution now began its work in earnest, and continued active
fortwenty years. The Puritans looked to the accession of James of Scotland
[16O4]3 with hope, but were disappointed. When fairly seated on the English
throne, he-said of them, “I will make them conform, or I will harrie them out
of the land.” There were then more than thirty thousand of them in England.
During the ﬁrst year of James’s reign, three hundred of their ministers were

A PU RITAN.

1. The pope of Rome assumes the right to excommunicate, or expel from Christian communion,
whomsoever he pleases. In former times, even kings were not exempt. An excommunicated person
lost social caste ; and for centuries this was an iron rod in the hand of ecclesiastics to keep the people in
submission to spiritual authority. Happily for mankind, this species of despotism has lost its power,
and commands the obedience of only the ignorant and enslaved.

4. John Rogers, a pious minister, and John Hooper, Bishop of Gloucester. ~

5. This was the title of all those Protestants in England who refused to conform to the doctrines and
ceremonials of the established church. This name was ﬁrst given in 1572. Ninety years afterward
[1662], 2,000 ministers of the established church, unwilling to subscribe to the Thirty-Nine Articles,
seceded, and were called Disseuters ; a name yet applied to all British Protestants who are not attached
to the church of England. ~ 6. See Note 1, p. 46.

silenced, imprisoned or exiled. The long struggle of the established church

with the Roman Catholics on one _hand, and the Puritans on the other, was now

decided. It had been a struggle of three quarters of a century, not so much
for z50lemz§z'0n as for supremacy ,' and the church of Englandwas the ﬁnal victor.
9. Among the devout men who ﬂed from_ England, was thereverend John
Robinson, pastor of a ﬂock gathered in thevnorthern counties. Informed that
there was “freedom of religion for all men in Holland,” he ﬂed thither, with his
people [1608], and established a church at Leyden.“ They were soon joined by
others from their native country. Their purity of lifeand lofty independence
commanded the admiration of the Dutch; and their loyalty", to the country from
which they had been driven, was respected as a noble virtue. ' .

‘ 10. Charmed by the narratives of the Dutch voyagers to America, the Puri-
tans, who felt that they were only PILGRIMS, resolved to go there, far away
from persecutions, where they might establish an English colony with religious
freedom for its basis. A deputation’ went to England [1617], and through the
inﬂuence of powerful friends,9 obtained the consent of the Plymouth Company3
to settle in North V-irginia,4‘and also a promise from the king that he Would
wink at their heresy, and let them alone in their new home. They asked no
more. Some London merchants formed a partnership with them, and furnished
capital for the eXpedition.5 Captain Smith
offered his services, but on account of his
aristocratic notions, they were declined.
Two ships (Speedwell and May-Flower) were
purchased and furnished,5 and in the sum-
mer of 1620, a portion of the Pz'lg7"7Jm.9 in
Holland-——“the youngest and strongest”——
embarked from Delft-Haven for England.7
Robinson and the larger portion o_f his ﬂock
remained at Leyden till a more convenient
season,8 and elder Brewster accompanied
the voyagers as their spiritual guide.

England, on the 5th of August, 1620. The ~ ~ ‘ .

12. After a boisterous passage of sixty—tl1ree days, the May Flower anchored
within Cape Cod.1 Before proceeding to the shore, the PILGRIMS agreed upon a
form of government, and committed it to writing? To that ﬁrst constitution of
gooemmcmf, ever subscribed by a whole people, the forty-one men afﬁxed their
names, and then elected John Carver to be their governor.3 In the cabin of
the May Flower the ﬁrst republican government in America was solemnly
inaugurated. That vessel was truly the cradle of liberty in America, rocked on
the free waves of the ocean. ,

13. After many hardships, exploring parties4 selected a place for landing, and
on the 22d day of December, 1620, the PILGRIM FATHERS ﬁrst set foot upon a
bare rock on the bleak coast of Massachusetts Bay, While all around, the. earth
was ‘covered with deep snow.5 They called the landing
place New Plymouth, and there a- ﬂourishing village is now
spread out.5 Dreary, indeed, was the prospect before them.
Exposure and privations had prostrated one half of the men
before the ﬁrst blow of the axe had been struck to build a
habitation. Faith and hope nerved the arms of the healthy,
and they began to build. One by one perished. The gov-

1. Sir Ferdinand Gorges and John Mason (the latter, secretary to the Plymouth
Council for New England3) obtained a grant of land [1622], extending from the
Merrimac to the.Kennebec, and inland to the St. Lawrence. They named‘ the
territory LACONIA. The same year a colony of ﬁshermen, under David Thomp-
son, seated themselves at Little Harbor, on the Piscataqua river, just below
Portsmouth. Another party, under two brothers named Hilton, London ﬁsh-
mongers, commenced a settlement [1623] a few miles above, at Dover; but
they were only ﬁshing stations, and did not ﬂourish. - 1

2. In 1629 the Rev. Mr. Wheelwright-1 purchased from the Indians the wil— ’

derness between the Merrimac and the Piscataqua, and founded Exeter. The
same year Mason obtained from Gorges exclusive ownership of that same por-
tion of LACONIA. He named the domain NEW l‘IAMPSHIRE,~5 and in 1631 built a
house upon the site of Portsmouth, the name which he gave to the spot. Other
settlements upon the Piscataqua, and along the present coast of Maine, as far as
Portland, were attempted. At the latter place a company had a grant of land
forty miles square, and formed an agricultural settlement [1631] called LlG0NIA.5
Pemaquid Point was another settlement, which remained an independent com-
munity for almost forty years. Trading houses were established as far east as

was at the head of a new State, and, as chief magistrate, held the same relative position as king James
of England, whose seat was richly ornamented and covered with a canopy of silk and gold.

6. The people of these eastern settlements which formed the basis of the present commonwealth of
MAINE, did not like the government attempted to be established by the proprietor, and, taking political
power into their own hands, placed themselves under the jurisdiction of Massachusetts in 1652; The
Territory was erected into a county, and called Yorkshire. In 162l,king James, as sovereign of Scot-
land, placed the Scottish seal to a charter granting to Sir William Alexander, afterward [1633] Earl of
Stirling, the whole territory eastward of the State of Maine, under the title of Nova. Scotia, or New Scot-
land. The French had already occupied places along the coast, and called the country Acaclie. The

Scotch proprietor never attempted settlements, either in this territory or in Canada, which Charles the '

First had granted tohim, and the whole country passed into the hands of the French, by treaty. The
Earl died in 1640, and all connection of his family with Nova Scotia ceased. His title was held after-
ward by four successors, the last of whom died in 1739. In 1759 VVi1liam Alexander (General Lord Stir-
ling during our War for Independence) made an unsuccessful claim to the title. The next claimant was
Alexander Humphrey, who commenced operations in the Scottish courts in 1815, and by forgcries and
frauds was partially successful. The whole was exposed in 1833. Humphrey was in this country in
1853, pressing his claims to the monopoly of the Eastern Fisheries, by virtue of the grants of Kings

3. In 1641 the several feeble and scattered settlements in New Hampshire
formed a coalition With the ﬂourishing Massachusetts colony, and remained de-
pendencies of that province until 1680, when they were separated by order- of
the king, and New Hampshire became a royal province. Its ﬁrst government
consisted of a governor and council appointed by the king, and a house of repre-

sentatives electedby the people. Then was founded the commonwealth of NEW

SECTION ‘V.

, VMARYLAND. [1634]

1. Maryland was ﬁrst settled by persecuted Roman Catholics from England
and Ireland. While king James worried the Puritans on one hand, for non-
conformity,'2 the Roman Catholics, at the other end of the religious scale, were
subjected to even more severe penalties. As the Puritans increased in numbers
and inﬂuence, their cry against the Roman Catholics grew louder and ﬁercer,
and While defending themselves from persecution with one hand, they were
inflicting as severe a lash upon the-Romanists with the other. Thus subjected
to two-fold opposition, the condition of the Roman Catholics became deplorable,
and, in common with other sufferers for opinion’s sake, their eyes were turned
toward free America. , .

2. Among the most inﬂuential professors of Catholicism was George Calvert,
an active ‘member of the London Company,3 and Secretary of State at the time
when the PILGRIMS4 Were preparing to emigrate to America. He was so much
more loyal in action to his sovereign than to his faith, that he did not lose the
king’s favor, although frankly professing to be a Roman Catholic; and for his
services, he was created an Irish peer [162l], w.ith the title of Lord Baltimore.
He also obtained from James a grant [1622] to plant a Roman Catholic colony

on a portion of Newfoundland. He called the territory AVALON, but his col-

ony Was not successful. The barren soil, a.nd French aggressors from Acadie,
were too much for their industry and courage, and the settlement Was aban-
doned. ” - .

3. Lord Baltimore now went to Virginia [1628], with a view of establishing a
colony of his brethren there. But he found the Virginians as intolerant as the
crown or the Puritans, and he turned his back upon their narrow prejudices,
and went to examine the beautiful, unoccupied region beyond the Potomac. He
was pleased With the country, and applied for a charter to establish a colony
there. The London Company was now d_issolved,5 and the soil had become the
property of the monarch. King Charles readily granted a charter, but before it
was completed, Baltimore died [April 25, 1632 . It was soon afterward issued
to Cecil, his son and heir [June 20], and in honor of the queen, Henrietta

Maria,‘ _the province was ca.lled MARYLAND.
The territory deﬁned in the charter extended’
along each side of Chesapeake Bay, from the
30th to the 45th degree of north latitude, its
Western line being the waters of the Poto-
mac. = .

4. The Maryland charter was drawn, it is
believed, by the first Lord Baltimore’s own
hand. It was the most liberal one yet grant-
ed, both in respect of the proprietor and the
settlers. The government of the province
was independent of the crown, and equality
in religious rights and civil freedom, was se-
cured to every Christian sect. The kinghad
no power to levy the smallest tax upon the _ -

COlOl1lStS, and all laws were invalid until sa.nc- CECIL, SECOND LORD BALTIMORE.
tioned by a majority of the freemen, or their

deputies. Under such a wise and liberal charter, the colony, when planted,
ﬂourished. remarkably. V

5. The ﬁrst company of emigrants, mostly Roman Catholics, sailed for Amer-
ica on the 2d of December, 1633, under Leonard Calvert, brother of the proprie-
tor, and governor of the province. They arrived in March, 1634, and after sailing
up the Potomac, as far as Mount Vernon, they descended the stream, almost to
its mouth. They landed upon an estuary of the Chesapeake, purchased an Indian
village, and laid the foundation of a town [April, 1634], which they named St.
Mary? The honesty of Calvert in paying for the land, secured the good will of
the Indians; and, unlike the ﬁrst settlers of most of the other colonies, they
experienced no sufferings from want, or the hostilities of the Aborigines}?

 

6.'The ﬁrst legislative assembly was convened at St.’ Mary on the 8th of .1

March, 1635. Every freeman being allowed to vote,,it was a purely demo-
cratic legislature. As the number of colonists increased,»-this method of mak-
ing laws was found" to be inconvenient, and in 1639,*a representative govern-
ment was established, the people being allowed to‘ send as ,many delegates as
they pleased. The ﬁrst representative assembly made a dec_1aration,_of rights,
defined the powers of the proprietor, and took measures to secure to ‘the colon-

ists all the civil liberties enjoyed by the people of Old England. Then was V

founded the commonwealth of MARYLAND.

 

1. She was a Roman Catholic, and sister of Louis the Thirteenth- of France.

2. Trading posts were established a little earlier than this, within the Maryland ‘province. In 1631
William Clayborne obtained a license from the king to tratﬁc with the Indians ; and when Calvert and
his company came, he had two settlements, one on Kent Island, nearly opposite Annapolis, and another
at the present Havre de Grace, at the mouth of the Susquehannah. He refused to acknowledge the au-
thority of Baltimore, and trouble ensued. He collected his people on the eastern shore of l\Iaryland in
1635, with a determination to defend his claims by force of arms ; and in May quite a severe skirmish
ensued between his forces and thoseof the colonists. Clayborne’s men were taken prisoners, and he
fled to Virginia. He was declared guilty of treason,’ and sent to England for trial. His estates were for-

pfeited ;qbut, being acquitted of the charge, he returned to Maryland and incited a rebellion. See verse

SECTION VI.
0 o NNECTI cur. [1632-1639].

1. The Connecticut river was ﬁrst explored, as far as Hartford, by Adrian
Block,1 in 1614, who named it Versche, or Fresh Water river.‘3 Soon afterward
Dutch traders were upon its banks, and might have carried on a peaceful and
proﬁtable traffic with the Indians, had honor and honesty marked their course.
But the avaricious agent of the Dutch imprisoned an Indian chief on board his
vessel, and would not release him until a ransom of one hundred and forty
fathoms of wampum3 had been paid.» The exasperated Indians menaced the
traders, and near the site of Hartford, at a place yet known as Dutch Point,
they commenced the erection of a fort. The Indians were conciliated, and the
fort was abandoned for awhile. ’

2. In 1627, friendly intercourse was opened between the Dutch of New
Netherlands and the Puritans.4 \Vith the guise of friendship, but really for the
purpose of strengthening the claims of the Dutch to the Connecticut valley, by
having an English settlement there, under the jurisdiction of New N etherland,

governor Minuit5 advised the Puritans to leave the barren land of Massachusetts
"Bay, and settle in the fertile region of the Fresh Water river. In 1631, a

Molzegan chief; then at war with the powerful Pequ0ds,5 desirous of having a
strong barrier between himself and his foes, urged the English to come and
settle inthe Connecticut valley. The Puritans clearly perceived the selﬁsh

policy of both parties, and hesitated to leave. The following year [1632], how-

ever, governor Winslow, of the Plymouth colony,7 visited that fertile region,

and, delighted with its appearance, resolved to promote emigration thither.

3. In the meanwhile, the Council of Plymouth3 granted the soil of Connecti-
cut .[1630] to the earl of Warwick, who, in 1631, transferred his interest to
lord Say-and-Seal, lord Brooke, John Hampden, and others. ‘The eastern
boundary of the territory was “Narraganset river,” and the western (like all
other charters at that time) was the Paciﬁc Ocean.9 The Dutch became ap-
prized of the movements of the English; and perceiving no advantage (but

detriment) to themselves, they purchased of the Indians the land at Hartford 1'

and vicinity, completed their fort, 1“ and placed two cannons upon it [I633], with
the intention of preventing the English ascending t-he river.

4. In October [1633], captain William Holmes and a chosen company arrived
in the Connecticut river, in a. sloop. Holmes bore a commission from governor
Winslow to make a settlement, and brought with him the frame of a house.
When he approached the fort, the commander menaced him with destruction if
he attempted to pass it. Holmes was not intimidated, and sailing by unhurt,
he landed at the site of Windsor, and there erected his house. Seventy men
were sent by the Dutch the following year,'to drive him from the country.
They were kept at bay, and ﬁnally a parley resulted in peaceful relations.”

5. Holmes’s colony ﬂourished, and in the autumn of 1635, a party of sixty

men, women, and children, from the Puritan settlements, commenced a jour-
ney through the wilderness [Oct. 25] to join. him. With their cattle,‘ they

. made a slow and dreary journey of a hundred miles through dark forests and

dismal swamps; and when they arrived upon the banks of the Connecticut
[Nov. 25], the ground was covered with deep snow,
and the river was frozen. It was a winter of great
trial for them. Many. cattle perished.‘-3 A vessel bear-
ing food for the colony was lost on the coast, and the -
settlers were compelled to subsist upon acorns, and
scanty supplies of Indian corn from the natives. Many
of them made their way to the fort, then just erected
at Saybrook, near the mouth of the river, and returned
to Boston by water. Spring opened, and the necessi-
ties of those wl1o remained were supplied. They erected
a small house for worship on the site of Hartford, and
in April, 1636, the ﬁrst court, or organized government, rmsr msmlms:-Housm-
was held there. 6

6. At about the time when this company departed, a son of governor Win-
throp3 of Massachusetts, Hugh Peters and Henry Vane, arrived at Boston from
England, as commissioners for the proprietors of Connecticut, with instructions
to build a fort at the mouth of the river of that name, and to plant a colony there.
The fort was speedily built, and the settlement was named Saybrook, in honor
of the two peers named in the charter.4 ' -

7. In June, 1636, Rev. Thomas Hooker, the “light of the western churches,”
with other ministers, their families, and flocks, in all about one hundred, leftthe
vicinity of Boston for the Connecticut valley. It was a toilsome journey
through the swamps and forests. They subsisted upon the milk of their cows
which they took with them, and on the 4th of July [1636], they stood upon the
beautiful banks of the Connecticut. On the 9th, Mr. Hooker preached and ad-
ministered the communion in the little meeting-house at Hartford, and there a
great portion of the company settled. Some chose Wethersﬁeld for a residence;
and others, from Roxbury, went up the river twenty miles, and settled at
Springﬁeld. There were now ﬁve distinct English settlements upon the Con-
necticut river.

‘ 8. A storm was now gathering. The powerful Pequod Indians5 became
jealous of the white people, because they appeared to be the friends of their ene-

 

mies, the Mohegams on the West, and of their more powerful foes, the Nalmcagaw _

sezfzfs, on the East. They ﬁrst commenced petty annoyances; then kidnapped
children, murdered men in the forests, and attacked families on the outskirts of

the settlement at Saybrook. Their allies of Block Island? captured a Massa- .

chusetts trading vessel, killed the captain7 [July 1636] and plundered her. An
inefficient expedition from Boston and vicinity penetrated the Pegu-od country,
which resulted in only increasing the hatred and hostility of the savages. The
Pequods beca.me bolder, and ﬁnally sought an alliance with their enemies, the
Namragcmsezfs, in an effort to exterminate the white people. “

1. This was the ﬁrst introduction of cattle into Connecticut.

64; . SETTLEMENTS.

9. Roger Williams, who, for his tolerant opinions, had been banished from
Massachusetts,1 was now a friendly resident in the country of the Narmgcmsets, and
heard of the proposed alliance. Forgetting the many injuries he had received,
he warned the doomed people of the Bay Colony, of impending danger. At the
risk of his own life, he descended N arraganset Bay in an open canoe, on a stormy
day, and visited Miantonomoh, the Nctrraganset sachem, at his seat near New-
port, while the Pequocl ambassadors were there in council. The latter menaced
Williams with death; yet that good man remained three days, and effectually
prevented the alliance.” And 1nore——he induced the Narmgcmsezfs to renew hos-
tilities with the Pequods. By this generous service the infant settlements were
saved from destruction. 1

10. During the ensuing Winter, the Indians. continued their murderous depre-
dations. In the Spring, the authorities of the Englishsettlements on the Con-
necticut declared war against the Pequods [May 1637], and the Massachusetts
and Plymouth colonies agreed to aid them. Soon, captain Mason, who was in
command of the fort at Saybrook3 and captain John Underhill, a brave and rest-
less man, sailed in some pinnaces, with about eighty white men and seventy
M0/zegcm Indians under Uncas,4 for N arraganset Bay. There Miantonomoh,
with two hundred warriors, joined them, a.nd they marched for the Pequocl coun--
try. Their ranks were swollen by the brave Nmnzfics and others, until ﬁve hun-
dred “ bowmen and spearmen” Were in the train of captains Mason and Under-
hill.

11. The chief sachem of the Pequods, was Sassacus, a ﬁerce warrior, and the
terror of the New England tribes.5 He could summon almost two thousand
Warriors to the ﬁeld; and feeling confident in his strength, was not properly
vigilant. His chief fort and village on the Mystic river, eight miles north-east
of New London, was surprised at dawn [June 5, 1637], and before sunrise’
more than. six hundred men, women and children, perished by ﬁre and sword.

Only seven escaped to spread the dreadful intelligence abroad, and arouse the -

surviving warriors. The Narragcmsezfs turned homeward, and the English,
aware of great peril, pressed forward to Groton onthe Thames, and there em-
barked for Saybrook. They had lost only two killed, and less than twenty
wounded. . ’ ' ' . ‘
12. Sassacus had scarcely recovered from this shock, when almost a hundred
armed settlers, from Massachusetts, under captain Stoughton, arrived at Say-

brook. The terriﬁed Pequods made no resistance, but ﬂed in dismay toward the

wilderness westward, hotly pursued by the English. Terrible was the destruction
in the path of the pursuers. Throughout thesbeautiful country on Long Island
Sound, from Saybrook to New Haven, wigwams and cornﬁelds were destroyed,
and helpless women and children were slain. With Sassacus at their head, the
Indians ﬂew like deer before the hounds, and ﬁnally took shelter in Sasco
swamp, near Fairﬁeld, where, after a severe battle, they all surrendered, except
Sassacus and a few followers. These ﬂed to the Mo7zawks,5 where the sachem was
treacherously murdered, and his people were sold into slavery, or incorporated
with other tribes. The blow was one of extermination, relentless and cruel.

name. A nation had disappeared in a day.” The New England tribes‘ were

ﬁlled with awe, and for forty years the colonists were unmolested by them.-

13. In the Summer of 1637, John Davenport, an eminent non-conformist?
minister of London, with Theophilus Eaton and Edward Hopkins, rich mer-
chants who represented a wealthy company, arrived at Boston. They were
cordially received, and urgently solicited to settle in that colony. The Hutcl1in-
son controversy3 was then at its height; and perceiving the religious agitations

of the people, they resolved to found a settlement in the wilderness. The saga- -

cious Puritans, while pursuing the Pequods, had discovered the beauty and fer-
tility of the country along the Sound from the Connecticut to Fairﬁeld, and
Davenport and his companions heard their report with joy. Eaton and a few
others explored the coast in Autumn, and erecting a hut4 near the Quinipiac
creek (the site of New Haven), they passed the winter there, and selected it for
a settlement. In the Spring [April 13, 1638] Davenport and others followed,

and under a wide spreading Oak,5 the good minister preached his first sermon. _

They purchased the lands at Quinipiac, of the Indians, and, taking the Bible for
their guide, they formed an independent government, or “plantation covenant”
upon strictly religious principles. Prosperity blessed them, and they laid the foun-
dations of a city and called it NEW HAVEN. ‘

14. The following year the settlers at VVindsor, Hartford, and Wetliersﬁeld,

met in convention at Hartford [January 24, 1639], and adopted a written con-
stitution, which contained very liberal provisions. It orda.ined that the governor
and legislature should be elected annually, by the people, and they were re-
quired to take an- oath of allegiance to the commonwealth, and not to the king.
The General Assembly, alone, could make or repeal laws‘; and in every matter
the voice of the people was heard. This was termed the CONNECTICUT COLONY;
and, notwithstanding it and the New Haven Colony were not united until
1665, now was laid the foundation of the Commonwealth of CONNECTICUT, which
Was governed by the Hartford Constitution for more than a century and a half.

SECTION VII.
RHODE ISLAND. [1636—1643.]

.1. The firstsettler in Rhode Island was William Blackstone, a non-conformist
minister,5 who was the ﬁrst resident upon the peninsula of Shawmut, where
Boston now stands.7 Not liking the “lords brethren” in'Massachusetts any
more than the “lords bishops” of_ England, he withdrew to the wilderness, and

. dwelt high up on the Seekonk or Pawtucket river, which portion of the stream

still bears his name. There he planted, and called the place Rehoboth.8 Al-

though he was the ﬁrst settler, Blackstone was not the fozmdev" of Rhode Island.

He always held allegiance to Massachusetts. ’

66 SETTLEMENTS.

2. When Roger Williams was banished from Massachusetts toward the close
of ].63o,1 he crossed the borders of civilization, and found liberty and toleration
among the heathen. After his sentence? his bigoted persecutors began to

‘dread the inﬂuence of his enlightened principles, if he should plant a settlement

beyond the limits of existing colonies, and they resolved to detain him. In-
formed of their-scheme, he withdrew from Salem in the dead of winter [Jan.,
1636], and through deep snows he traversed the forests alone, for fourteen
‘weeks, sheltered only by the rude Wigwam of the Indian, until he found the

hospitable cabin 3 of Massasoit, the chief sachem of the Womzpanoasgsﬂ at Mount

Hope. There he was entertained until the buds appeared, when, being joined

’ by ﬁve friends from Boston, he seated himself upon the Seekonk, some distance

below Blackstone’s plantation. .

3. Williams was within the territory of the Plymouth Company.5 Governor
Winslow‘? advised him to cross into the Narmgcmset country, where he could
not be molested. With his companions he embarked in a light canoe, paddled
around to the head of N arraganset Bay, and upon a green slope, near a. spring,7
they prayed, and chose the spot for a settlement‘. Williams obtained a grant of
land from Canonicus, chief sachem of the Ncm"mgcmse25s, and in commemoration of
“ Grod’s merciful providence to him in his distress,” he called the place PROVIDENCE.

'4. The freedom enjoyed at Providence was soon spoken of at Boston, and
-persecuted men ﬂed thither for refuge. Men of every creed were allowed full
liberty of conscience, and lived together happily. The same freedom was
allowed in politics as in religion; and there was established a pure democracy.
Each settler was required to subscribe to an agreement, that he would submit
to such rules, “not affecting the conscience,” as a majority of the inhabitants
should adopt for the public good. Williams reserved no political power to him-
self, a.nd the leader and follower had equal dignity and privileges. The govern-
ment was entirely in the hands of the people. '

5. The powerful Nawagcmset chief became much attached to Williams, and
his influence among them, as we have seen,3 was very powerful. He saved his
persecutors from destruction, yet they had not the Christian manliness to remove
the sentence of banishment. His settlement was entirely unmolested during
the Pequod war,9 and it prospered wonderfully.

,6. Early in 1638, while Mrs. Hutchinson was yet in prison in Boston,” her
husband, with VVilham Coddington, ’Dr. John Clarke, and sixteen others, of
concurrrent religious views,“ accepted the invitation of Roger Williams to settle
in his vicinity. Miantonomoh gave them the beautiful island of Aquiday1‘~’ for

.forty fatlioms of white wampum.l3 They called it Isle of Rhodes, and upon its

chosen judge or chief ruler, with three assistants. Others soon camé§""from Bos-
ton; and in 1639, Newport, toward the lower extremity of the 7‘island, was
founded. Liberty of conscience was absolute; love was the social and political
bond, and upon the seal which they adopted was the motto, Amov" omcil omnla,
—-“ Love is all-powerful.” - p '
.7. Although the Rhode Island and the Promiclence plantations were separate
in government, they were united in interest and aim. Unwilling to acknovtrleglge
allegiance to either Massachusetts or Plymouth,‘ they sought an independent
charter. For that purpose Roger Williams went to England in 1643. The
whole parent country was then convulsed with civil war.‘2 After much delay,
he obtained from Parliament (which was then contending .fiercely“with the
king) a free charter of incorporation [March 24, 1644], and all the settlements
were united under the general title of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.

’ Then was founded the commonwealth of RHODE ISLAND.

DELAWARE, NEW JERSEY, AND PENNSYLVANIA. [1631-1682]

1. The first permanent settlements in the provinces of Delaware, New Jersey,
and Pennsylvania, bore such intimate relations to each other, that they may be
appropriately considered as parts of one episode in the history of American
colonization. -

DELAWARE.

2. Cape Henlopen "was the southern coast-limit of New Netherlands.3 In
June, 1629, Samuel Godyn and others purchased of the natives, the territory be-
tween the Oape and the mouth of the Delaware river. The following year two
ships under the command of Peter Heyes sailed from the Texel [Dec. 12, 1630]
for America. One vessel was captured. The other arrived in April, 1631; and
near the present town of Lewiston, in Delaware, thirty emigrants, with imple-
ments and cattle, seated themselves. Hayes returned to Holland, and reported
to captain De Vries,4 his employer. That ma.riner visited America early the

following year [1632], but the little colony left by Heyes was not to be found.

Difficulties with the Indians had provoked savage vengeance, and they had
exterminated the white people. ’

4. De Vries was an eminent navigator, and one of Godyn’s friends. To secure his valuable services,
the purchasers made him a partner in their enterprise, with patroon [Verse 2, p. 104] privileges, and
the first expedition was arranged by him. He afterwards came to America, and was one of the most
active men in the Dutch colonies. On his return to Holland, he published an account of his voyages.

with his associates, visited Sweden, and laid before the enlightened monarch,
Gustavus Adolphus, well-arranged plans for a Swedish colony in the New
World. The king was delighted, for his attention had already been turned
toward America; and his benevolent heart was full of desires to plant afree
colony there, which should become an asylum for all persecuted Christians.
While his scheme Was ripening, the danger which menaeed.Protestantism in
Germany, called him to the ﬁeld, to contend for the principles of the Reforma-
tion} He marched from his kingdom With a strong army to opposethe Impe-
rial hosts marshalled under the banner of the pope on the ﬁelds of Germany.
Yet the care and tumults of the camp and ﬁeld did not make him forget his
benevolent designs; and only a few days before his death, at the battle of
Lutzen [Nov. 6, 1632], Gustavus recommended the enterprise as “the jewel of
his kingdom.”

4. Christina, the daughter and successor of Gustavus, was then only six

years of age. The government was administered by a regency} at the head of >

which was Axel, count of Oxenstierna. He was the earliest and most ardent
supporter of the great enterprise of Gustavus; and in 1634, he issued a charter
for the Swedislz West India Company. Peter Minuit,3 who had been "recalled
from the governorship of New N etherland, went to Stockholm and offered his
services to the new corporation. They were accepted, and toward the close of
1637, he sailed from Gottenburg with ﬁfty emigrants, to plant a colony on the
west side of the Delaware. He landed on the site of New Castle, in April,
1638, and purchased from the Indians,4 the territory between Cape Henlopen
and the Falls of the Delaware, at Trenton. They built a church and fort on the
site of Wilmington, called the place Christina, and gave the name of New Sweden
to the territory. A

5. The jealousy of the Dutch was aroused by this “intrusion,” and they
hurled protests and menaces against the Swedes.5 The latter continued to
increase by emigration; new settlements were planted; and upon Tinicum
island, a little below Philadelphia, they laid the foundations of a capitalfor a
Swedish province.-5 The Dutch West India Company7 ﬁnally resolved to expel
or subduethe Swedes. The latter made hostile demonstrations, and deﬁed the
powerof the Dutch. The challenge was acted upon; and toward the close of
the summer of 1655, governor Stuyvesant, with a squadron of seven vessels,
entered Delaware Bay.8 In September every Swedish fort and settlement was
brought under his rule, and the capitalon Tinicum island was destroyed. The
Swedes obtained honorable terms of capitulation; a.nd for twenty-ﬁve years
they prospered under the rule of the Dutch and English proprietors of New
N etlierland.

2. A regent is one who exercises the power of a king or emperor, during the absence, incapacity, or
childhood of the latter. For many _vears, George the Third of Engrland was incapable of ruling, and
his son, who was to be his successor at his death, was called the Prince Regent, because Parliament

had given him power to act as king, in the place of his father. In the case of Christina, three persons 1

were appointed regents or rulers.

Danes, and then on the Delaware. Early in 1623, the Dutch ‘built a log fort
near the mouth of Timber Creek, a few miles below Camden, and called it
Nassau} In June, 1623, four couples, who had been married on the voyage
from Amsterdam, were ‘sent to plant a colony on the Delaware. They seated
themselves upon the site of Gloucester, a little below Fort Nassau.

7. In 1630, Michael Pauw bought, from the Indians, the lands extending from

I-Ioboken to the Raritan; and also the whole of Staten Island, and named the '

territory Pcw0m'a.? In this purchase, Bergen was included. - Other settlements
were attempted, but none were permanent. In 1631, captain Heyes, after
establishing the Swedish colony at Lewiston,3 crossed the Delaware, and pur-
chased Cape May4 from the Indians; and from that point to Burlington, traders’
huts were often seen. The English became possessors of New N etherland in
1664, and the Dukeof York, to whom the province had been given,5 conveyed
to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret [June 24, 1664], all the territory be-
tween the North and South (Hudson and Delaware) Rivers, and northward to
the line of forty-one degrees and f'orty minutes, under the title of Nova Ocesarea
or NEW JERSEY. Soon afterward" several families from Long Island settled at
Elizabethtownﬁ and there planted the ﬁrst seed of the New Jersey colony. The

following year, Philip Carteret, who had been appointed governor of the new

province, arrived with a charter, fair and liberal in all its provisions. It pro-
vided for a government to be composed of a representative assembly7 chosen by
the people, and a governor and council. The legislative powers resided in the
assembly; the executive powers were intrusted to the governor and his council.
Then [1665] was la.id the foundation of the commonwealth of NEW JERSEY.

PENNSYLVANIA.

8. At about the commencement of the civil wars [1642-1651] which resulted
in the death of Charles the First, a new religious sect arose, called Quakers.8
Their preachers were the boldest, and yet the '
meekest, of all non-conf'ormists.9 Pfirer than all
other sects, they were hated and persecuted by
all. Those who came to America for “conscience
sake” were persecuted by the Puritans of New
England,” the Dutch of New Amsterdam, and
the Churchmen of Virginia and Maryland. Only
in Rhode Island did they enjoy freedom, and even
therethey did not alwaysdwell in peace.

9. In 1673, George Fox, the founder,of the
Quaker sect, visited all his brethren in America.
He found them a despised people everywhere, and
his heart yearned for an asylum for his brethren.
Among the most inﬂuential of his converts was WILLIAM pm-,3

French sea captain to set up the arms of France there. The fort was built of logs, and was little else

soon scattered, and the fort was abandoned.

1Villiam Penn, son of the renowned admiral of that name. Through him the
sect gained access to the ears of the nobility, and soon the Quakers possessed
the western half of New Jersey, by purchase from lord Berkeley} The ﬁrst
company of immigrants landed in the autumn of 1675, and named the place of
debarkation SaZem.‘»3 They established a democratic form of government; a.nd
in November, 1681, the first legislative assembly of Quakers ever convened, met
at Salem.

10. In the meanwhile, Penn, who had been chief peace-maker when disputes
arose among the proprietors a.nd the people, took measures to plant a new colony
beyond the Delaware. He applied to Charles the Second for a charter. The
king remembered the services of admiral Penn,3 and gave his son a grant
[March 14:, 1681] of “three degrees of latitude by ﬁve degrees of longitude west
of the Delaware,” and named the province Pevzhsylwmct. It included the princi-
pal settlements of the Swedes. To these people, and others within the domain,
Penn sent a proclamation, ﬁlled with the loftiest sentiments of republicanism.
William Markham, who bore the proclamation, was appointed deputy governor
of the province, and with him sailed [May, 1681] quite a large company of im-
migrants, who were members or employees of the Company of Free T7"ade'rs,4
who had purchased lands of the proprietor.

11. In the spring of 1682 [May], Penn published a frame of government, and
sent it to the settlers for their approval. It was not a constitution, but a code
of wholesome regulations for the people of the colony.-'3 He soon afterward ob-
tained, by grant and purchase [Aug., 1682], the domain of the present State of
Delaware, which the duke of York claimed, notwithstanding it was clearly
not his own. ‘ It comprised three counties, called The Ter/*m't07"z'es.6

12. Toward the close of August, 1682, Penn sailed for America with about one
hundred emigrants. The voyage was long and tedious; and when he arrived
at Newcastle, in‘Delaware [N 0v. 6], he found almost a thousand new comers
there, some of whom had sailed before, and some
after, his departure from England. He was joy-
fully received by the old settlers, who then num-
bered almost three thousand. The Swedes said,
“_1t is the best day we have ever seen,” a.nd
they all gathered like children around a father.

13. On the day after his arrival, Penn received
from the agents of the duke of York,7 in the pres-
. . .. ence of the people, a formal surrender of The

THE ASSEMBLY HOUSE, Territories,‘ and after resting a few days, he pro-
ceeded to visit his brethren in New Jersey, and

the authorities at New York. On his return, he met the General Assembly of
the province, at Chester,8 when he declared the Union of The Terrttorvies with

4. Lands in the new province were offered for about ten cents an acre. Quite a number of purchasers
united, and called themselves The Conzpany of Free Traders, with whom Penn entered into an agree-
ment concerning the occupation of the soil, laying out of a city, &c.

5. It ordained a General Assembly or court, to consist of a governor, a council of seventy chosen by
the freemen of the colony, and a house of delegates, to consist of not less thantwo hundred members,
nor more than five hundred. These were also to be chosen by the people. The proprietor, or his
deputy (the governor), was to preside, and to have a three-fold voice in the council; that is, on all
questions, he was to have three votes for every one of the councillors. ‘

SECTION IX.
T H E c A R 0 L 1 N A s. [1622--1680].

1. We have already considered the unsuccessful efforts atscttlement on the
coast of Carolina during the sixteenth century} As early as 1609, some dissatis-
ﬁed people from Jamestown settled on the Nansemond; and in 1622, Porey,
then Secretary of Virginia, with a few friends, penetrated the country beyond
the Roanoke. In 1630, Charles the First granted to Sir Robert Heath, his at-
torney-general, a domain south of Virginia, six degrees of latitude in width, eX-

-tending from Albemarle Sound to the St. J ohn’s River, in Florida, and, as usual,

westward to the Paciﬁc Ocean. N o. settlements were made, and the charter
was forfeited. ‘

2. Dissenters or Noncomformists‘? now suffered many disabilities in Virginia,
and looked to the wilderness for freedom. In 1653, Roger Green and afew
Presbyterians left that colony and settled upon the Chowan River, near the pres-
ent village of Edenton. Other Dissenters followed, and the colony ﬂourished.
Governor Berkeley, of Virginia,3 wisely organized them into a separate political
community [1663], and William Drummond,4 a Scotch Presbyterian minister,
was appointed their governor. They received the name of Albemarle County
Colony, in honor of the duke of Albemarle, who, that year, became a proprietor
of the territory. Two years previously [1661], some New England-5 adventurers
settled in the Vicinity of Wilmington, on the Cape Fear River, but many of them
soon abandoned the country because of its poverty. «

3. In 1663, Charles the Second granted the whole territory named in Heathfs

charter, to eight of his principal friends,5 and called it CAROLINA.7‘ Asthe

Chowan settlement was not within the limits of the charter, the boundary was
extended nortl‘1wa‘rd' to the present line between Virginia and North Ca1'olina.,
and=.a'lso southward, so as to include the whole of Florida, except its peninsula.
The-VBahama Islands were granted to the same proprietors in 1667.8 ,

4. A company of Barbacloes planters settled" [1665] upon the lands first occu-
pied by the New England people, and founded a permanent settlement there.
The few settlers yet remaining were treated kindly, and soon an independent

Assembly,met. It wasyet standing in 1850. Notfar from the spot, on the shore of the Delaware, at
the mouth of Chester Creek, was also a solitary pine Ztrelel, which marked the place wl‘ifere Pppn lapéled.

colony, with Sir John Yeamansl as governor, was established. It was called
the -Clarendon » County Colony, in honor of, one of the proprietors. Yeamans
managed prudently, but the poverty of the soil prevented a rapid increase in the
population? N ow was founded the commonwealth of NORTH CAROLINA.

5. In January 1670, the proprietors sent three ships with emigrants, under
the direction of William Sayle3 and Joseph West, to plant a more southerly
colony. They entered Port Royal, landed on Beaufort Island at the spot where
the Huguenots built Fort Carolina [1564.],4 aindthere Sayle died early in 1671.
The immigrants soon afterward abandoned Beaufort, and sailing into the Ashley
River,5 seated themselves on its western bank, at a place a few miles above
Charleston, now known as Old Town, and there planted the ﬁrst seeds of a
South Carolina colony.

6. West exercised authority until the arrival‘ of Sir John Yeamans [December
1671], who was appointed governor. He came with ﬁfty families, and a large
number of slaves.6 Representative government was instituted in 167 2,7 under
the title of the Ucmferet County Colony. It was so called in honor of one of the
proprietors.8 Ten years afterward they abandoned the spot; and upon Oyster
Point, at the junction of Ashley and Cooper Rivers,-9 nearer the sea, they
founded the present city of Charleston.” Immigrants came from various parts
of Europe, and many Dutch families, dissatisﬁed with the English rule at New
York," went to South Carolina, where lands were freely given them, and soon,
along the Santee and the Edisto, the wilderness began to blossom under the
hand of culture. The people would have nothing to do with a government
scheme prepared by Shaftesbury and Locke,” but preferred simple organic laws
of their own making. Then was laid the foundations of the commonwealth of
SOUTH CAROLINA, although the history of the two States, under the same pro-
prietors, is inseparable, until the period of their dismemberment in 1729.13

the Spaniards as part of their territory of Florida? The English disputed this
claim, and South Carolina townships were ordered to be marked out as far south
as the Alatamaha. Tl1e dispute grew warm and warlike, and the Indians, insti-
gated by the Spaniards, depredated upon the frontier English settlements.3

2. While the clouds of hostility were gathering, and grew darker every hour,
it was lighted up by a bright beam of benevolence, which proved the harbinger
of a glorious day. It came from England, where, at that time, poverty was often
considered a crime, and at least four thousand‘ unfortunate debtors were yearly
consigned to loathsome prisons. The honest and true, the noble and the edu-
cated, as Well as the ignorant and vile, groaned within prison walls. Their wail-
ings atlength reached the ears of benevolent men. Foremost among these
was James Edward Oglethorpe,4 a brave soldier and staunch loyalist, whose voice
had been heard often in Parliament, against imprisonment for debt.

3. General Oglethorpe was made chairman of a committee of inquiry upon the
subject, appointed by Parliament, and his report, embodying a noble scheme of
benevolence, attracted attention and admiration. He proposed to open the prison
doors to all virtuous men within, who would accept the conditions; and with
these and other sufferers from poverty and oppression, to go to the wilderness of
America, and there establish a colony of freemen, and open an asylum for perse-

cuted Protestants5 of all lands. The plan met warm responses in Parliament,"

and received the hearty approval of George the Second, then on the English

throne [l730]., A royal charter for twenty-one years was granted [June 9,’
1732] to a corporation “ in trust for the poor,” to establish a colony within the’
disputed territory south of the Savannah, to be called GEORGIA, in honor of the-

King.5 Individuals subscribed large sums to defray the expenses-of emigrants
hither; and within_two years after the issuing of the patent, Parliament had
appropriated one hundred and eighty thousand dollars for the same purpose?’

4. Oglethorpe was a practical philanthropist. He offered toaccompany the-

first settlers to the Wilderness, and to act as governor of the new province. W'ith
one hundred and ‘twenty emigrants he left England [Nov. 1732], and after a
passage of ﬁfty-seven days, touched at Charleston [J an. 1733], where he was

received with great joy by the inhabitants, as one who was about to plant a bar-

rier between them and the hostile Indians and Spaniardsﬁ Proceeding to Port
Royal, Oglethorpe landed a large portion of his followers there, and with a few
others, he coasted to the Savannah river. Sailing up that stream as far as-Yanr
acraw Bluti‘, he landed and chose the spot »whereon to lay the foundation of
the capital of a future State.9 , —

6. The domain granted by the charter extended along the coast from the Savannah to the Alatamaha,
and westward to the Paciﬁc ocean. The Trustees appointed by the crown, possessed all legislative and

executive power ; and therefore, while one side of the seal of the new province expressed the benevolent '

character of the scheme, by the device of agroup of toiling silkworms and the motto, Non sibi, sed aliis ,'
{he other side, bearing, between two urns, the genius of “ Georgia Augusta,” with a cap qf Le'berty on
"her head, a spear and a horn of plenty, was a false emblem. There was no political liberty for the people.

7_. Brilliant visions of vast vintages, immense productions of silk for British looms, and all the wealth
of a fertile tropical region, were presented for the contemplation of the commercial acumen of the busi-
ness men of England. These considerations, as well as the promptings ofpure benevolence, made dona-
tions liberal and numerous.

5. The remainder of the emigrants arrived from Port Royal soonafterward
[Feb. 12, 1733]. The Winter air was genial, and with cheerful hearts and will-

ing hands’ they constructed a rude fortiﬁcation, and commenced the erection of a»

town, which they called Savannah, the Indian name of the river.1 For almost a
year the governor dwelt under a tent, and there he often held friendly inter-
course with the chiefs of neighboring tribes. At length, when he had mounted
cannons upon the fort, and safety was thus secured, Oglethorpe met ﬁfty chiefs
in council [May, 1733], Witl1iTo-mo-chi-ch7J,2 the chief sachem of the lower Greek
Confederacy3 at their head, to treat for the purchase of lands. Satisfactory
arrangementslwere made, and the English-obtained sovereignty over the whole
domain [June 1, 1733] along the Atlantic from the Savannah to the ‘St. Johns,
and westward to the Flintand the head waters of the Chattahoochee. The pro-
visions of the charter formed the constitution of government for the people; and
there, upon.’.Yamacraw Bluii, where the ﬂourishing city of Savannah now stands,
was laid the foundation of the commonwealth of GEORGIA, in -the Summer of
17 33. Immigration ﬂowed thither in a strong and continuous stream, for all
were "free in religious matters; yet for many years the colony did not ﬂourish.4

6.. Never in the history of the world was greater heroism displayed than the
seaboard of the domain of the United States exhibited during the period of set-
tlements, and the development of colonies. Hardihood, faith, courage, indom-
itable perseverance, and untiring energy, were requisite to accomplish all that
was done in so short a time, and under such unfavorable circumstances. Wliile
many of ' the early emigrants were mere adventurers, and sleep in deserved
oblivion, because they were recreant to the great duty which they had self-
imposed, there are thousands whose names ought to be perpetuated in brass and
marble, for their faithful performance of the mighty task assigned them. They
came here as sewers of the proliﬁc seed of human liberty; and during the colo-
nizing period, many of them carefully nurtured the tender plant, While, burstin
into vigorous life. We, who are the reapers, ought to reverence the sewers antl
the eultivators with grateful hearts.

all built on one model, 24. by 16 feet, on the ground. ‘ . ‘

2. To—mo-chi-chi was then an aged man, and at his ﬁrst interview with Oglethorpe, he presented him
with a buﬂalo skin, ornamented with the picture of an eagle. " Here,” said the chief, “ is a little pres-
ent; I give you a buﬂ‘-alo’s skin, adorned on the inside with the head and feathers of an eagle, which I
desire you to accept, because the eagle is an emblem of speed, and the buifalo of strength. The English
are swift as the bird, and strong as the beast, since, like the former, they ﬂew over vast seas to the
utterrnost parts of the earth; and, like the latter, they are so strong that nothing can withstand them.
The feathers of an eagle are soft, and signify love ; the buffalo’s skin is warm, and signiﬁes protection :
therefore I hope the English will love and protect our little families.” Alas, the wishes of the venerable
To-mo-chi-ch?) were never realized, for the White people more often plundered and destroyed, than loved

' and protected the Indians.

CHAPTER IV.
THE COLONIES.
SECTION I.

1. The colonial history of the United
States is comprised" Within the period
commencing when the several settle-
ments along the Atlantic coasts became
organized into political communities,

 

  ,\‘,\ i.  - and ending When ‘representatives of

  - ' these colonies met in general congress

‘   in 1774,‘ and confederated for mutual

ﬁx‘    , Welfare. There Was an earlier union of

,jAMES EDWARD 0GLmE0R,,,,_ - interests and efforts. It was When the

several English colonies aided the mo-
ther country in a long war against the combined hostilities of the French and
Indians. As the local histories of the several colonies after the commencement
of that War have but little interest for the general reader, We shall trace the pro-
gress of each colony only to that period, and devote a section to the narrative of
the French a.nd Indian War? '

V Questions".-‘-1. What period comprises the colonial history of the United States? What ‘union of cﬂ"oris
was effected previous 1301774? ’

7 6   coLoNIEs.

2. We have observed that a settlement acquires the character of a colony only
when it has become permanent, and the people, acknowledging allegiance to a
parent State, are governed by organic laws.‘ According to these conditions, the
earliest of the thirteen colonies represented in the Congress of 177 4., was

VIRGINIA. A [1619].

3. It was a happy day for the six hundred settlers in Virginia, when the gold-
seekers disappeared? and the enlightened George Yeardley became governor,
and established a representative assembly [June 28th, 1619]——the first in all
America.3 And yet a prime element of happiness and prosperity was wanting.

There were no white women in the colony. The wise Sandys, the friend of the

Pilgrim Fathers} was then treasurer of the LONDON COMPANY,5 and one of the
most inﬂuential and zealous promoters of emigration. During the same year
when the Puritans sailed for America [1620], he sent more than twelve hundred

emigrants to Virginia, among whom were ninety young women, “pure and un-.

corrupt,” who Were disposed of for the cost of their passage, as wives for the
plantersﬁ The following year sixty more were sent. The family relation was
soon established; the gentle inﬂuence of woman gave reﬁnement to social life on
the banks of the Powhatan ;7 new and powerful incentives to industry and thrift
were created, and the mated planters nolonger cherished the prevailing idea of

A returning to England.3
4. Vessel after vessel, laden with immigrants, continued to arrive in the J ames-

River, and new settlements were planted, even so remote as at the Falls,9 and
on the distant bank of the Potomac. The germ of an Empire was rapidly ex-
panding with the active elements of national organization. Verbal instructions
would no longer serve the purposes of government, and the compan 'ranted
[August, 1621] the colonists a written Constitution,” which ratified mgrstg of the
acts of Yeardley.“ Provision was made for the appointment of a governor and
council by the Company, and a‘popular assembly to consist of two burgesses or

representatives from each borough, chosen by the people. This body, and the

council, composed the General Assembly, which was to meet once a year and
pass laws for the general good}? Such laws were not valid, until approved by the
company, neither were any orders of the company binding upon the colonists,
until ratiﬁed by the General Assembly. Trial by jury was established, and
courts of law conformable to those of England were organized. Ever afterward

6.. Tobacco had already become a_circulating medium, or_ currency, in Virginia. The price of a wife
varied fl-on1‘12-J to 150 pounds of this product, equivalent, ID money value, to about $90 and $112 each.
The second cargo” were sold at a still higher price. by the K1ng’s special order, one hundred disso-
lute vagabonds, called ‘__}a1l.b1rds ’ by the colonists, were sent over the same year, and sold as bond-
s_ervant_s for a specihed time. In August, the same year, a Dutch trading vessel entered the James
river with negro slaves. lwenty of them were sold into perpetual slavery to the planters. This was
the commencement of negro slavery in the English colonies [note 4, p. 135]. The slave population of

« the United States in 1850, was 3,204,313, according to the census.

7. Verse 10, p. 47.

8. Most of the immigrants hitherto were possessed of the spirit of mere adventurers. They came to '

America to repair shattered fortunes, or to gain wealth, with the ultimate object of returning to Eng
land to en_]oy it. The creation of families made the planters more attached to the soil of Virginia.

claiming these privileges as rights, the Virginians look back to the Summer of
1621 as the era of their civil freedom.

5. Sir Francis Wyatt, who had been -appointed governor under the Constitu-
tion, and brought the instrument with him, was delighted with the aspect of
affairs in Virginia. But a dark cloud soon arose in the Summer sky. The
neighboring Indian tribes‘ gathered in solemn council. Powhatan, the friend
of the English after the marriage of his daughter}? was dead, and an enemy of the
white people ruled the dusky nation.3 They had watched the increasing strength
of the English, with alarm. The white people were new four thousand in num-
ber, and rapidly increasing. The Indians read their destiny—annihilation-—-
upon the face of every new comer; and, prompted by the ﬁrst great law of his

‘ nature, self preservation, the red man resdlved to strike a blow for life.

6. An Indian conspiracy to exterminate the white people was formed in the
Spring of 1622. ,At mid-day, on the ﬁrst of April, the hatchet fell upon all of
the more remote settlements; and within an hour, three hundred and ﬁfty men
women and children were slain.4 J amestown-3 a.nd neighboring plantations
were saved by the timely warning of a converted Indian.5 The people were on
their guard and escaped. Those far away in the forests defended themselves
bravely, and then tied to Jamestown. Within a few days, eighty plantations
were reduced to eight. ' 

7. Now concentrated at Jamestown, the people prepared for vengeance. A vin-
dictive war ensued, and a terrible blow of retaliation was given. The Indians
upon the James and York rivers were slaughtered by scores, or were driven far
back into the wilderness. Yet a blight was upon the colony. Sickness and
famine followed close upon the massacre. Within three months, the colony of

‘four thousand souls was reduced-to twenty-ﬁve hundred; and a.t the beginning

of 1624, of the nine thousand persons who had been sent to Virginia, from Eng-
land, only eighteen hundred remained. _ ‘

8. The holders of the stock of the LONDON COMPANY7 had now become .very
numerous, and their meetings, composed of men of all respectable classes, as-
sumed‘ a political character, in which two distinct parties were represented,-
namely, the advocates of liberty, and the supporters of the royal prerogatives.‘
The king was offended by the freedom of debates at these meetings, and regard-
ed them as inimical to royalty and dangerous to the stability of ‘his throne.“
He determined to regain what he had lost by granting the liberal third charter,9
to the company. He endeavored ﬁrst to. control the elections. Failing in this,
he sought a pretence for dissolving the Company. A commission was appointed

3. Powhatan died in 1618, and was succeeded in oﬁice by his younger brother, Opechancanough
[verse 12, p. 79]. This chief hated the English. He captured Smith.

4. Opechancanough was wily andexceedingly treacherous. Only a few days before the massacre, he
declared that ‘.‘ sooner the skies would fall -than his friendship with the English should be dissolved.”
Pvenlon the day of the massacre, the Indians entered the houses of the planters with usual tokens of
"rienc ship. - -

5. Verse 10, p. 47. _ _

6. This was Chance, who was informed of the bloodydesign the evening previous. He desired to save
a white friend in Jamestown, and gave him the information. It was too late to send word to the more
remote settlements. Among those who fell, on this occasion, were six members of the council, and
several of the wealthiest inhabitants.

7. Verse 7, p. 46. ' ‘

8. These meetings were quite frequent ; and so important were the members, in politicalaffairs, that
they could inﬂuence the election of members of parliament. In 1623, the accomplished Nicholas Ferrar,
an active opponent of the court party, was elected to Parliament, by the inﬂuence of the London com-
pany. This fact, doubtless, caused the king to dissolve the Company the present year.

[May 1623] to inquire into their affairs. It was composed of the king’s pliant
instruments, who, having reported in favor of a dissolution of the Company, an
equally pliant judiciary accoinplisliecl his designs [October 1623], and a quo
wawantol was issued. The company made but little opposition, for the settle-
ment of Virginia had been an unproﬁtable speculation from thebeginning ; and
in July, 1624, the patents were cancelled? Virginia became a royal province
again,3 but no material‘ change was made in the domestic‘ affairs of the
colonists. . 

9. With his usual egotism, king James boasted of the beneﬁcent results to the
colonists, which would flow from this usurpation, by which they Were placed
under his special care. He appointed Yeardley,-4 with twelve councillors, to ad-
minister the government, but wisely refrained from interfering with the House
of Burgesses.5 The king lived but a few months ‘afterward, and at his death
[April 6, 1625] he was succeeded by his son, Charles the First. That «monarch
was as selﬁsh as he was weak. He sought to promote the welfare of the Vir-
ginia planters, because he also sought to reap the proﬁts of a monopoly, by
becoming himself theirsole factor in the management of their exports; He
allowed them political privileges, because he asked their sanction for his coni-

. mercial agency.5i .

10. Yeardley died in November 1627, and ‘was succeeded by Sir John Harvey
[1629], a haughty and unpopular royalist. He was a member of the commission
appointed by James ,7 ‘ and the colonists so despised him, that they refused the
coveted monopoly to the king. After many and violent disputes about la.nd
titles, the Virginians deposed him [1635] and appointed commissioners to proceed
to England, with an impeachment. Harvey accompanied the commission. The
king refused to‘ hear complaints against the accused, and he was sent back
clothed with full powers to administer thegovernment. He ruled almost four
years longer, and was succeeded [November 1639] by Sir Francis Wyatt.

11. Sir William B.erkeley,8 an able an elegant courtier, succeeded Wyatt in

August 1641. For ten years he ruled with vigor, and the colony prospered’

wonderfully.9- But, as in later years, commotions in Europe now disturbed the
American settlements.‘ The democratic revolution iniEngland,1U which brought
Charles the First to the block, and placed Oliver Cromwell in power, now began
[1642], and religious sects in England and America assumed political importance.

6. In June 1628, the king, in a letter to the governor and council, asked them to convene an assembly
to consider his proposal to contract for the whole crop of tobacco. He thus tacitly a_cl<i:owledged the
legality of the republican assembly of Virginia, hitherto not sanctioned, but only pemmtted.

Wale  the gxactions of the king fostered a bitter feeling towarc_ls him, in the hearts of the
people. In 1641 they took up arms against their sovereign. One of the chief leaders of the popular
party was Oliver Cromwell. The war continued until 1649, when‘ the royalists were subdued, and the
king was beheaded. Parliament assumed all the functions of government, and ruled until 1653, when
Cromwell, the insurgent leader, dissolved that body, and was proclaimed supreme ruler, with the title of
Protector of the Commonwealth of England. He was a son of a wealthy brewer of Huntingdon, Eng-
land, where he was born in 1599. Died, September, 1658.

Church were united in interest, and the Virginians being loyal to both, it was
decreed that no minister should preach except in conformity to the constitution
of the Church of England.‘ Many non-conformists'-3 were banished from the

colony. This was a dark cloud upon the otherwise clear skies of Virginia, but a

darker cloud wasgathering. »  ~

12. The Indians were again incited to hostilities [April, 1644], by the restless
and vengeful Opechancanough,3 and for two years a bloody border warfare was
carried on. The king of the Powhatan's4 was ﬁnally made captive, and died

while in prison atJamestown». The power of the confederation was completely .

broken, and after ceding large tracts of land =3 to the English, the chiefs acknowl-
edged allegiance to the authorities of Virginia.‘

13. The Virginians remained loyal during the civil war in England“ -[1641-
1649], and when Republican government was -proclaimed, they boldly recog-
nized the son of the late king, although in exile, as their sovereign.7 The
republican parliament was incensed, and took measures to coerce Virginia into
submission to its authority. For that purpose Sir George Ayscue was sent with
a powerful ﬂeet, bearing commissioners of parliament, and anchored in Hampton
Roads in March, 1652. « - ‘

14. Although the Virginians had resolved to- submit rather than ﬁght, they
made a show of resistance. They declared their willingness to compromise
with the invaders, to which the commissioners, surprised at the bold attitude
of the colonists, readily consented. Instead of opening their cannons upon the

Virginians, they courteously proposed submission to the authority of . parliament _

upon terms quite satisfactory to the colonists. Liberal political concessions to
the people were secured, and they were allowed nearly all those civil rights
which the Declaration of Independence,3 a century and a quarter later, charged
George the Third with violating. ' A
15.- Until Charles the Second was restored to the throne of his father [May
29, 1660], Virginia was virtually an independent state, for Cromwell made no
appointments except that of governor. Already the people had elected Richard
Bennet [1652] to ﬁll Berkeley’s place. He was succeeded by Edward Digges;
and in 1656, Cromwell appointed Samuel Matthews governor. On the death of

the Protector [1658], the Virginians were not disposed to acknowledge, the.

authority of his son Riehard,9 and they elected Matthews their chief magis-
trate, as a token of their independence. Universal suffrage prevailed; all free-
men, without exception, were allowed_to vote; and white servants, when their
terms of bondage ended, had the same privilege, and might become burgesses.
16. When intelligence of the probable restoration of Charles the Second
reached Virginia, Berkeley, whom the people had elected governor in 1660,
repudiated the popular sovereignty, and proclaimed the exiled monarch “King
of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Vt.’/‘g’5727.'(1;.” This happened before he was
proclaimed in England.” The Virginia republicans were offended, but being in

8 THE ABORIGINES.'

2. The history of the Indian’ tribes, previous to the formation of settlements

among them, by Europeans,“ is involved in an obscurity which is penetrated"

only by vague traditions and uncertain conjectures. Whence came they? is a
question yet unanswered by established facts. In the Old World, the monu-
ments of an ancient people often record their history. In North America such
intelligible records are wanting. Within almost every state and territory remains
of human skill and labor l1ave been found,3 which seem to attest the existence

’ here of a civilized nation or nations, before the ancestors of our numerous Indian

tribes became masters of‘ the continent. Some of these appear" to give indispu-
table evidence of intercourse between the people of the Old World and those of
America, centuries, perhaps, before the birth of Christ, and at periods soon after-
ward.4 The whole mass of testimony yet discovered, does not prove that such
intercourse Was extensive; that colonies from the Eastern hemisphere ever
made permanent settlements in America, or remained long enough to impress
their character upon the country or the Aboriginals, if they existed; or that a
high degree of civilization had ever prevailed on our continent.

3. Some refer the origin of the Indian tribes to the Phoenicians and other an-
cient maritime nations; others perceive evidences of their Egyptian or Hindoo
parentage; and others ﬁnd their ancestors among the “lost tribes of Israel,”
who “took counsel to go forth into a farther country where never mankind
dwelt,”5 and crossed from north-eastern Asia to our continent, by way of the
Aleutian Islands, or by Behring’s» Straitsﬁ These various theories, and many
others respecting settlements of Europeans and Asiatics here, long before the
time of Columbus, unsupported as they are by a sufficiency of acknowledged
facts, have no practical value for the young student of our history. The proper
investigation of such subjects requires maturity of judgment when reason and
reﬂection have succeeded the eager credulity of childhood and early youth.

4. When America ﬁrst became known to Europeans, it afforded materials for
wonderful narratives concerning its inhabitants a.nd productions. The few na-
tives who were found upon the seaboard, had all the characteristics common to
the human race. The interior of the continent was a deep mystery, and for a
long time marvellous stories were related and believed of nations of giants and
pigmies; of people with only one eye, and that in the centre of the forehead;
and of whole tribes who existed without eating. But when sober men pene-
trated the forestsand became acquainted with the inhabitants, it was discovered
that from the Gulf of Mexico to the country north of the chain of great lakes,7
the people were not remarkable in persons and qualities, and that a great

6. The people of north-eastern Asia, and on the north-westcoast of America, have a near resemblance
in person, customs, and languages ; and those of the Aleutian Islands present many of the characteris-
tics of both. Ledyard said of the people of eastern Siberia, “ Universally and circumstanti-ally they

the minority, could do nothing. A new Assembly was elected and convened,
and high hopes of favor from tl1e monarch were entertained by the court party.
But these were speedily blasted, and in place of greater privileges, came com-
mercial restrictions to cripple the industry of the colony. The navigation act
of 1651 was re-enacted in 1660, and its provisions Were rigorously enforced.‘

17. The people murmured, but in vain. The profligate monarch, who seems
never to have had a clear perception of right and wrong, but was governed by
caprice and passion, gave away, to his special favorites, large tracts of the ﬁnest
portions of the Virginia soil, some of it already well cultivated?

18. Month after month, the Royalist party continued to show more and more

of the.foul hand of despotism. The pliant Assembly abridged the liberties of the _

people. Although elected for only two years, the members assumed to them-
selves the right of holding ofﬁce indefinitely, and the representative system was
thus virtually abolished. The doctrines and rituals of the church of England
having been made the religion of the State, intolerance began to grow. Bap-
tists and Quakers?‘ were compelled to pay heavy ﬁnes. The salaries of the

royalofﬁcers being paid from duties upon exported tobacco, these ofﬁcials were I

made indepe_ndent of the people.4 Oppressive and unequal taxes were levied,
and the idle aristocracy formed a distinct and ruling class. “The “common
people”—the men of toil and substantial worth-—formed a Republican party, and
rebellious murmurs were heard on every side.

19. The menaces of the Susquehamzah Indians,5 a ﬁerce tribe of Lower Penn-
sylvania, gave the people a plausible pretense for arming during the summer of
1675. The Indians had been driven from their hunting-grounds at the head of
the Chesapeake Bay by the S’enecas,5 and coming down the Potomac, made war
upon the Maryland settlen1ents.7 They ﬁnally committed murders upon Virginia
soil, and retaliation8 caused the breaking out of a ﬁerce border war. ‘

20. __ Governor ‘Berkeley’s measures for defence were not satisfactory, and
Nath_aniel;Bacon,9 an energetic and highly esteemed republican, acting in be-‘
half of his party, demanded permission for the people to arm and protect them-
selves.” Berkeley’s sagacity perceived the danger of allowing discontented men
to have arms, and he refused. The Indians came nearer and nearer, until labor-

ians sent a message to Charles, then in Flanders, inviting him to come over and be king of Virginia.
He had-resolved to come, when matters took a turn in England favorable to his restoration. In grati-
tude to the colonists, he caused the arms of Virginia to be quartered with those of England, Scotland,
and Ireland, as an independent member of the empire. From this circumstance Virginia received the
name, of The Old Dom2'm'on. Coins, with these quarterings, were made as late as 1773.

1. The ﬁrst Navigation Act, by the Republican Parliament, prohibited foreign vessels trading to the
English colonies. This was partly to punish the sugar-producing islands of the West Indies, because
the people were chieﬂy loyalists. The act of 1660 provided that no goods should be carried to or from
any English colonies, but. in vessels built within the English dominions, whose masters and at least
three-fourths of the crews were Englishmen: and that sugar, tobacco, and other colonial commodities
should be imported into no part of Europe, except England and her dominions. The trade between the
colonies now struggling for prosperous life, was also taxed for the beneﬁt of England.

2. In 1673, the king gave to lord Culpepper and the earl of Arlington, two of his proﬂigate favorites,
“all the dominion of land and water called'Virginia,” for thirty years.

8. J-ohn Wasliington, an ancestor of the commander-in-chief of the American armies a century later,
commanded some troops against an Indian Fort on the Potomac. Some chiefs, who were sent to his
camp to treat for peace, were treacherously slain, and this excited the ﬁerce resentment of the

ers o_n.Bacon’s plantation, near Richmond, were murdered. That leader then

‘yielded to the popular will, and placed himself at the head of four or ﬁve liun-
_.dred men, to drive back the enemy. Berkeley, jealous of Bacon’s popularity,

proclaimed him a traitor [May, 1676], and sent troops to arrest im. Some of
his more timid followers returned, but sterner patriots adhered to -his fortunes.

21. The people generally sympathized with Bacon, and in the lower counties
they-arose in open rebellion. Berkeley was obliged to recall his troops to sup-
press the insurrection, and in the meanwhile Bacon drove the Indians1 back
toward the Rappaliannock. He Was soon afterward elected a burgess,9 but on
approaching Jamestown, he was arrested. For fear of the people, who made
hostile demonstrations, the governor pardoned him and all his followers, and
hypocritically professed a personal regard for the bold republican leader.

22. The pressure of popular opinion now compelled Berkeley to yield at all
points. The long aristocratic Assembly was dissolved; many abuses were cor-
rected, and all the privileges formerly enjoyed by the people were restored.3
Fearing treachery in the capital, Bacon withdrew to the Middle Plantation,4
where he_was joined by three or four hundred armed men from the upper coun-
ties, and. was proclaimed commander-in-chief of the Virginia troops. The gov-
ernor regarded the movement as rebellious, and refused to sign Bacon’s commis-
sion. The patriot marched to Jamestown, and demanded it without delay. The
frightened governor speedily complied [July 4, 1676], and, concealing his anger,
he also, on compulsion, signed a letter to the king, highly commending the acts
and motives of the “traitor.” The Assembly also gave him the commission of a
general of a thousand men.

23. On receiving his commission, Bacon. marched against the Pamunkey
Indians.5 When he had gone, Berkeley crossed the York river, and at Glouces-
ter he suinmoned_a convention of Royalists. All the proceedings of the Repub-
lican Assembly were reversed, and, contrary to the advice of his friends, the
governor again ‘proclaimed Bacon a traitor [July 29, 1676]. The indignation. of

the patriot leader was ﬁercely kindled, and, marching back to Jamestown, he

lighted up a civil war. The property of Royalists was conﬁscated, their wives
were seized as hostages, and their plantations were desolated. Berkeley ﬂed to
the eastern shore of the Chesapeake. Bacon proclaimed his abdication, and, dis-
missing ‘the.Republican troops, called an Assembly in his own name, and was
about to cast off all allegiance to the English Crown, when -.intelligence was
received of the arrival of imperial troops to quell the rebellion.6

24. Berkeley, with some Royalists and English sailors‘ under major Robert
Beverly, now [Sept 7] returned to Jamestown. Bacon collected his troops,
and drove the governor down the James river. Informed that a large body
of Royalists and imperial troops were approaching, the Republicans applied the

ity. It was the first bending of power to the boldly-expressed will of. the people. -

4. Williamsbiirg, four miles from Jamestown, and midway between the York and James rivers, was
then called the Middle Plcmtation-. After the accession of William and Mary [see verse 33,. p. 96], a town

“ W " : forward» with his little army toward the York, de-

/  g  termined to drive the Royalists from Virginia. But

:“1{U'RCH T0WER_ ‘ he was smitten by a deadlier foe than armed men.

_- The malaria of the marshes at Jamestown had poi-

soned his veins,‘and he died [Oct. 11.. 167 6] of malignant fever, on the north

bank of the'York. There was no man to receive the mantle of his ability and

influence, and his" departure was a death-blow to the cause he had espoused.

His friends and followers made but feeble resistance, and before the first of N o-
vember, Berkeley returned to the Middle Plantation4 in triumph.

26. Recent events had rendered the haughty temper of the governor irra.sci-
ble, and he signalized. his restoration to power by acts of wanton cruelty.
Twenty-two of the insurgent leaders had been hanged,5 when the more merciful
Assembly implored him to shed no more blood. But he continued ﬁnes, impris-
onments, and conﬁscations, and ruled with an iron hand and a stony heart until
recalled by the King [April, 1677], who became disgusted with his cruel con-
duct.5 There was no printing press in Virginia to record current history,7 and
for a hundred years the narratives of Royalists gave hue to the whole affair.
Bacon was always regarded as a 2fra,z'2f07', and the effort to establish a free gov-
ernment is known in history as BAooN’S REBELLION.— Such, also, would have
been the verdict of history, had Washington and his compatriots been unsuc-
cessful. Too often success is accounted a virtue, but failure, a crime. '

27. The effects of these civil commotions were felt for many years. The peo-
ple were borne down by the petty tyranny of royal rulers, yet the principles of
republicanism grew apace. ’ The popular Assembly became winnowed of its aris-
tocratic elements; and, notwithstanding royal troops were quartered in Virginia,8
to overawe the people, the burgesses were always ‘firm in the maintenance of

3. The church, of which the brick tower alone remains, was built about 1620. It was probably the
third church erected in Jamestown. The ruin is now [1854] a few rods from the encroaching bank of
the river, and is about thirty feet in height. The engraving is a correct representation of its present ap-
pearance. 4In_t£l31i3 grave-yard adjoining are fragments of several monuments.

6. Charles said, “ The old fool has taken more lives in that naked country than I have taken for the
murder of my father.” —

7. Berkeley was an enemy to popular enlightenment. He said to commissioners sent from England in
1671, “Thank God there are no free schools nor printing press; and I hope we shall not have these
hundred years ;‘for learning has brought disobedience, and heresy, and sects into the world, and print-
ing has divulged these, and libels againstthe best government.” Despots are always afraid of the

‘printing press, for it is the most destructive foe of tyranny.

popular rights.‘ In reply to governor J eﬁreys, when he appealed to the author-
ity of the Great Seal of England, in defence of his arbitrary act in seizing the
books and papers of the Assembly, the burgesses said, “ that such a breach of
privilege could not be commanded under the Great Seal, because they could not
find that any king of England had ever done so in former times.” The king
commanded the governor to “signify his majesty’s indignation at language so
seditious ;” but the burgesses were as indifferent to royal frowns, as they were
to the governor’s menaees. _

28. Lord Culpepper, who, under the grant of 1673,? had been appointed gov-
ernor for life [167 7], arrived in, 1680. His proﬂigacy and rapacity disgusted the
people. Discontents ripened into insurrections, and the blood of patriots again
ﬂowed.3 At length the king became incensed against Culpepper, revoked his
granti [1684], and deprived him of office. Yet Efﬁngham, his successor, was
equally rapacious, and the people were on the eve of a general rebellion, when
king Charles died, and his brother J ames5 was proclaimed [Feb. 1685] his suc-
cessor. With the title of James the Second.

29. The people hoped for beneﬁt by the change, but their burdens were
increased‘. 1 Again the wave of rebellion was rising high, when the revolution of
16885 placed VVilliam of Orange and his wife Mary uponthe throne. Then a
real change for the better took place. —— That event, wrought out by the people,

_ infused a conservative principle into the workings of the English constitution.
" The popular will, expressed by Parliament, became potential; "and the personal

‘character, or caprices of the monarch, had comparatively little inﬂuence“ upon
legislationf, This potency of the National Assembly was extended to similar
colonial organizations. The powers of governors Were deﬁned, and the rights of
the people were understood. j-Bad men often exercised authority in the colonies,
but it was in subordinationto the English constitution and, notwithstanding
commercial restrictions bore heavily upon the enterprise of the colonies, the dif-
fusion of just political ideas,and the growth of free institutions in America,
were rapid and healthful. 3 ’ V

progress of an industrious people, and presents no prominent events of interest

5. James, duke of York, to whom Charles gave the New Netherlands in 1664. See verse 12, p. 107.

6. James the Second, by his bigotry (he was a Roman Catholic), tyranny and oppression, rendered him-
mself hateful to his subjects. William, Prince of Orange, Stadtholder of Holland, who had married Mary,
a Protestant daughter of James and his eldest child, was invited by the incensed people to come to'1he
English throne. He came with Dutch troops, and landed at Torbay on the 5th of November, 1688.
James was deserted by his soldiers, and he and his family sought safety in ﬂight. William and Mary
were proclaimed joint monarchs of England on the 13th of February, 1689. This act consummated that
revolution which Voltaire styled “the era of English liberty.”

7. The pop’ulation at that time was about 50,000. of whom one half were slaves. The tobacco trade 4

had become very important, the exports to England and Ireland being about 30,000 hogshcads that year.
Almost 100 vessels annually came from those countries to Virginia for tobacco. A powerful militia of
almost 9,000 men was organized, and they no longer feared their dusky neighbors. The militia became
expert in the use of ﬁre arms in the woods, and back to this period the Virginia riﬁeman may look for
the foundation of his fame as n marksman. The province contained 22 counties, and 48 parishes, with a
cliurnh and clergyman in each, and a great deal of glebe land. But there was no printing press nor

book store in the colony. A press was’ﬁrst established in the colony in 1729.

1. “Welcome, Englishmen! Welcome, Englishmen!” were the ﬁrst words

which the Pvjlg-Mm Fcttherfsl heard from tl1e lips of a son of the American forest. ,

It was the voice of Samoset, a Wawzpanoag chief, who had learned a few Eng-
lish words of ﬁshermen at Penobseot. His brethren had hovered around the
little community of sufferers at New Plymouth2‘for a hundred days, when he
boldly approached [March 26, 1621] and gave the friendly salutation. He told
them to possess the land, for the occupants had nearly all been swept away by
a pestilence. The PtZgm'm.s thanked God for thus making their seat more so-
cure, for they feared the hostitity of the Aborigines.

' 2. When Samoset again appeared, he was accompanied by Squanto,3 a chief
who had recently returned from captivity in Spain; and they informed the white
people of Massasoit the grand Sachem of the VVampcm0ags, then residing at
Mount Hope. An interview was planned. The old sachem came with barbaric
pomp,4 and he and governor Carver5 smoked the ealumet5 together. A pre-
liminarytreaty of friendship and alliance was formed [April 1, 1621], which re-
mained unbroken for ﬁfty_years.7 Massasoit rejoiced at his good fortune, for
Canonicus, the head of the powerful Ncm"agcmsets,3 was his enemy, and he
needed Strength. ’

 Governor Carver died [April 3] three days after this interview. William
Bradford,9 the earliest historian of the colony, was appointed his successor. He

was a wise and prudent man, and for thirty years he managed the public affairs -
of the colony withgreat sagacity. The settlers endured great trials during the .

first four years of their sojourn. They were barely saved from starvation in the
autumn of 1621, by a scanty crop of Indian corn.'” In November of that year,
thirty—ﬁve emigrants (some of them their weak brethren of the SpeecZweZZ)11 joined
them, and increased their destitution. The winter was severe, and produced
great suffering; and the colonists were kept in continual fear by the menaces of
Canonicus, the great chief of the Ncrrragcmsets, who regarded. the English as
intruders. Bradford acted wisely with the chief,12 and soon made him sue for

4. Massasoit approached with a guard of. sixty warriors, and took post. upon a neighboring hill. There
he sat in state, and received Edward Winslow as ambassador from the English. Leaving Winslow with
his warriors as security for his own safety, the Sachem went into New Plymouth, and treated with
Governor Carver. Note 6, p. 10.

10. 'le Captain Miles Standish and others were seeking a. place to land [verse 13, p. 58], they found
some maize, or Indian corn, in one of the deserted huts of the savages. Afterward, Samoset and others
t.;1ught them how to cultivate the grain (then unknown in Europe), and this supply serving for seed,
providentially saved them from starvation. The grain new first received the name of Indicm corn.
Early in September [l62l],-an exploring party, under Standish, coasted northward to Shawmut the site
of Boston where they found it few Indians. The place was delightful, and for a while, the {Pilgrims
thought of removing thither. ' ,

1.2. Canonicus dwelt upon Connanieut Island, opposite Newport. In token of his contempt and deﬁ-
ance of the English he sent [Feb. 1622] a bundle of arrows, wrapped in a rattlesnake’s skin, to gov~
ernor Bradford. The governor accepted the hostile challenge, and then returned the skin, ﬁlled with
powder and shot. These substances were new to the savages. They regarded them with superstitious
awe, as possessing some evil inﬂuence. They were sent from village to village, and excited general
alarm. T_he pride of Canonieus was humbled, and he sued for peace.

peace.‘ The hatred of the wily Indian was not subdued, but he was compelled
to be a passive friend of the English.

4. In July following [1622], sixty-three more emigrants arrived. They had
been sent by Weston, a wealthy, dissatisﬁed member of the Plymouth Company,‘~’
to plant a new colony. Many of them were idleand dissolute ;3 and after living
upon the slender means of the Plymouth people for several weeks, they went to
Wissagusset (now Weymouth), to commence a settlement. Their improvidence

produced a famine; and they exasperated the Indians by begging and stealing

supplies for their wants. A. plot was devised for their destruction, but through
the agency of Massasoit,4 it was revealed [March, 1623] to the Plymouth people;
and Captain Miles Standish, with eight men, hastened to Wissagussetin time to
avert the blow. A chief and several warriors were killed in a battle ;5 and so
terrified were the surrounding tribes by the event, that several chiefs soon ap-
peared at Plymouth to crave the friendship of the English. The settlement at
Wissagusset was broken up, and most of the emigrants returned to England.

5. The partnership of merchants and eolonists5 was an unproﬁtable specula-
tion for all. The community system’7 operated unfavorably upon the industry
and thrift of the colony, and" the merchants had few or no returns for their in-
vestments. Ill feelings were created by mutual criminations, and the capitalists
commenced a series of annoyances to force the workers into a dissolution of
the league.8 The partnership continued, however, during the prescribed term
of seven years, and then [1627] the colonists purchased the interest of the Lon-
don merchants for nine thousand dollars. Becoming sole proprietors of the soil,
they divided the whole property equally, and to each man _was assigned twenty
acres of land in fee. New incentives to industry followed, and the blessings of
plenty, even upon that unfruitful soil, rewarded them all.9

6.. The government of the colony now became slightly changed. The only
officers, at ﬁrst, were a governor and an assistant. In 1624, ﬁve assistants were
chosen; and in 1630, when the colony numbered almost ﬁve hundred souls,
seven assistants were elected. This pure democracy prevailed, both in Church
and State, for almost nineteen years, when a representative government Was in-
stituted [l639], a.nd a pastor chosen as spiritual guide.”

1. His example was followed by several -chiefs.

2. Verse 7, p. 46. ,

3. There were quite a number of indentured servants, and men of no character ; a population wliolly
unlit to found an independent State.

4. In gratitude for attentions and medicine during a severe illness, Massasoit revealed the plot to
Edward Winslow a few days before the time appointed to strike the blow.

5. Standish carried the chief’s head in triumph to Plymouth. It was borne upon a pole, and was
placed upon the palisades [note 2, p. 94.] of the little fort which had just been erect ed. The good Rob-
inson [verse 9, p. 57], when he heard of it, wrote, “Oh, how happy a thing it would have been, that

‘ you had converted some before you killed any.”

6. Verse 10, p. 57. ’ 7. Note 5, p. 57.

8. The merchants refused Mr. Robinson a passage to America ; attempted to force a mini_ster upon the
colonistspwho was friendly to the established Church, and even sent vessels to interfere with the [infant
commerce of the settlers. '

9. The colonists unsuccessfully tried the cultivation of tobacco. They raised enough grain and vege-
tables for their own-consumption, and relied upon trafﬁc in furs with the Indians, for obtaining the
means of paying for cloths, implements, &c., from England. In 1627, they made the ﬁrst step toward

the establishment of the cod ﬁshery, since become so important, by constructing a salt work, and curing A

some ﬁsh. In 1624, Edward Winslow imported three cows and a bull, and soon those invaluable animals
became numerous in the colony. ‘ '

10. The colonists considered Robinson ( who was yet in Leyden) as their pastor; and religious exer-
cises, in the way of prayer and exhortation, were conducted by Elder Brewster and others. On Sun-
day afternoons a question would be propounded, to which all had a right to speak. Even after they
adopted the plan of having a pastor, the people were so democratic in religious matters, that a minister
did not remain long at Plymouth. The doctrine of “private judgment” was put in full practi.ce ; and
the religious meetings were often the arena of intemperate debate and confusion. In 1629, thirty-ﬁve

the l5‘irst, inherited his father’s hatred of the l\TOIlCOIIlfOI'IIllStS.1 Many of their
ministers Were silenced during the ﬁrst years of his reign, and the uneasiness of
the great body of N onconformists daily increased. Already, White, a Puritan
minister of Dorchester, in the west of England, had persuaded several influential
men of that city to attempt the establishment of a new asylum for the op-
pressed, in America. — They chose the rocky promontory of Cape Anne for the
purpose [I624], intending to connect the settlement with the ﬁshing business;
but the enterprise proved to be more expensive than proﬁtable, and it was
abandoned. A few years afterward, a company purchased a tract of land
[March 29, 1628] deﬁned as being “three miles north
of any and every part of the Merrimac River,” and
“three miles south of any and every part of the
Charles River,” and westward to the Pacific Ocean?
In the Summer of 1628, John Endicot, and a hundred
emigrants came over, and at Ncmmlceag (now Salem),
they laidthe foundations of the Colony of Massachusetts
Bay. The proprietors received a charter from the
king thefollowing year [March 14, 1629], and they
were incorporated by the name of “The Governor .

8. The new colony increased rapidly, and soon
began to_spread. In July, 1629, “three godly
ministers ” (Shelton, Higginson and Bright), came
with two hundred settlers, and a part of them
laid the foundations of Charlestown, at Mishawm.
On the ﬁrst of September, the members of the
company, at a meeting in Cambridge, England,

Thomas Southcoote, Simon Whitcomb John Winthrop, Thomas Dudley, Sir Richard Saltonstall, and
others. Eminent men in New Englan afterward became interested in the enterprise.

3. The administration of affairs was intrusted to a governor, deputy, and eighteen assistants, who
were to be elected annually by the stockholders of the corporation. A general assembly of the freemen
of the colony was to be held at least four times a year, to legislate for the colony. The king claimed
no jurisdiction, for he regarded the whole matter as a trading operation, not as the founding of an em-
pire. The instrument conferred on the colonists all the rights of English subjects, and afterward be-
came the text for many powerful discourses against the usurpations of royalty. _

Spring of excellent water on the peninsula of Shawmazf,‘ went there, erected
a few cottages, and founded Boston, the future metropolis of New England.”
The peninsula was composed of three hills, and for a long time it was called
TRI-MOUNTAIN.3 .

9. Many of the settlers, accustomed to ease and luxury i11 England, suffered
much, and before December, two hundred were in their graves.4 Yet the sur-
vivors were not disheartened, and during the winter of intense suffering which
followed, they applied themselves diligently to the business of ‘founding a State.
In May, 1631, it was agreed at a general assembly of the people, that all the
of,.‘icers of government should thereafter be chosen by the freemen5 of the colony;
and in 1634, the pure democracy was changed to a representative government,
the second in America.5 The colony ﬂourished. Chiefs from the Indian tribes
dined at Governor Winthrop’s table, and made covenants of peace and friend-
ship with the English. Wintltrop journeyed on foot to exchange courtesies with
Bradford at Plymouth;7 a ‘friendly Salutation came from the Dutch in New
Netherlandf‘ and a ship from Virginia, laden with corn [May, 1632], sailed
into Boston harbor. A bright future was dawning.

10. The Puritans,9_ victims of intolerance, were, themselves, equally intolerant,
when clothed with’ power. Their ideas of civil and religious freedom were
narrow, and their practical interpretation of the Golden Rule, was contrary to the
intentions, of HIM who uttered it. Yet they were honest and true men; and out
of their love of freedom, and jealousy of their inherent rights, grew their intol-
erance. They regarded Churchmen and Roman Catholics as their deadly enc-
mies, to be kept at a distance.” A wise caution dictated this course. A con-
sideration of the prevailing spirit of the age, when‘ bigotry assumed the seat of
justice, and superstition was the counsellor and guide of leading men, should
cause us to 1

“Be to their faults a little blind,
And to their virtues, Very kind.”

11. Among those who ﬁrst felt the power of Puritan intolerance, jwas Roger
Williams,11 himself ‘a Puritan minister, and victim of persecution in England.
He was chosen minister at Salem [1634-], and his more enlightened views, freely
expressed, Soon aroused the civil authorities against him. He denied the right
of civil magistrates to control the consciences of the people, _or to withhold their
protection from any religious sect whatever. He denied the right of the king

2. The whble company under Winthrop intended to join the settlers at Charlestown, but a prevailing
sickness there, attributed to unwholesome water, caused them to locate elsewhere. The fine spring of
water which gushed from one of the three hills of Shcowmut, was regarded with great favor.

3. From this is derived the word Tremont.

4. Among these was Higginson, Isaac Johnston (a principal leader in the enterprise, and the wealthiest
of the founders of Boston), and his wife, the “Lady Arabella,” a daughter of the earl of Lincoln. She
died at Salem, and her husband did not long survive her.

5. None were considered freemen, unless they were members. of some church within the colony.
From the beginning, the closest intimacy existed between the Church and State in Massachusetts, and
that intimacy gave rise to a great many disorders. This ‘provision was repealed in 1665.

at Salem, and members of Endicot’s Council, were arrested by him, and sent to England as “ factions
and evil-conditioned persons,” because they insisted upon the use of the Liturgy, or printed forms of the
English church, in their worship. , _

to require anoath of allegiance from the colonists; and even contended that
obedience to magistrates ought not to be enforced. Hc denounced the charter
from the king as invalid, because he had given to the white people the lands of
‘other owners, the Indians} These doctrines and others more theological‘? he
maintained with vehemence, and soon the colony became a scene of great com-
motion. He was remonstrated with by the elders, warned by the magistrates,
and ﬁnally, refusing to cease what was deemed seditious preaching, he was
banished [November 1635] from the colony. In the dead of Winter he depart-
ed [January 1636] for the wilderness, and became the founder of _ Rhode
Island.3 -

12. During 1635, full three thousand new settlers came, among whom were
men of Wealth V and inﬂuence. The most distinguished were Hugh Peters,4 (an
eloquent preacher), and Henry Vane, an enthusiastic young man of twenty-ﬁve.
In‘ 1636, Vane wa.s elected governor, a.n event which indirectly proved. disas-
trous to the peace of the colony. The banishment of Roger Williams had
awakened bitter religious dissensions, and the minds of the people were prepared
to listen to any new teacher. As at Plymouth, so in the Massachusetts Bay
Colony, religious questions were debated at these meetings.5 ‘Women were not
allowed to engage in these debates, and some deemed this an abridgment of
their rights. Among these was Anne Hutchinson, an able and eloquent
woman, ‘who established meetings at her own house, for her sex, and. there she
promulgated peculiar views, which seine of the magistrates and ministers pro-
nounced seditious and heretical.5 These views were embraced by governor
Vane, several magistrates, and a majority of the leading men of Boston.7 Win-
throp and others opposed them, and in the midst of great excitement, a synod
was called, the doctrines of Mrs. Hutchinson were condemned, and she and her
family were ﬁrst imprisoned in Boston, and" then banished [August 1637]
from the colony.3 Vane lost his popularity, and failing to be elected the follow-
ing year, he returned to England.9 Some of Mrs. Hutchinson’s followers left
the colony, and established settlements on Rhode Island.”

could lawfully pray- with such an one, though it were a wife or child I In the intemperancc of his zeal,
Williams often exhibited intolerance himself, and at this day would be called a bigot. Yet his tolerant
teachings in general had a most salutary effect upon Puritan exclusiveness. "

4. Peters afterward returned to England, was very active in public affairs during the civil war,‘ and
and on the accession of Charles the Second, was found guilty of favoriig the death of the king’s
father, and was executed in October 1660.

6. She taught that, as the Holy Spirit dwells in every believer, its revelations are superior to the
teachings of men. It was the doctrine of “private judgment,” in its fullest extent. ' She taught that
every person had a right to judge of the soundness of a minister’s teaching, and this was considered
“ rebellion against the clergy.” She taught the doctrine of Election, and avci-ed that the elect saints
were sure of their salvation, however vicious their lives might be. _

ists in the mother country suffered more and more, and hundreds tied to New
England. The Church and the Government became alarmed at the rapid
growth of a colony, so opposed, in its feelings and laws, to the character of
both. Efforts were put forth to stay the tide of emigration. As early as 1633,
a proclamation for that purpose had been published, but not enforced; and a

ﬂeet of eight vessels, bearing some of the purest patriots of the realm, was de-‘

tained in the Thames [Feb 1634], by order of the Privy council? Believing
that the colonists “aimed not at new discipline, but at sovereignty,” a demand
was made for a surrender of the patent to the king? The people were silent,
but ﬁrm. Wlieii a rumor reached them [September 18, 1634] that an arbitrary
commission,3 and a general governor was appointed for all the English colonies
in America, the Massachusetts people, poor as they were, raised three thousand
dollars to build fortiﬁcations for resistance. Even a quo wcmtmzfo [April 1638],4
did not-affect either their resolution or their condition. Strong in their integrity,‘
they continued to strengthen their new State by fostering education,5 the “ cheap
defence of nations,” and by other wise appliances of vigorous efforts. The civil
war5 which speedily involved the Church and the Throne in disaster, withdrew
the attention of the persecutors from the persecuted. The hope of better times
at home checked immigration, and thereafter the colony received but small ac-
cessions to its population, from the mother country.

14. The, struggling colonists of New England were united by ties of interest
and the warmest sympathy. Natives of the same country,——the offspring of
persecution,——alike exposed to the weapons of hostile Indians and the depreda-
tions of the Dutch and French,7—and alike menaced with punishment by the
parent government, they were as one people. They were now [1643] more
than twenty thousand in number, and ﬁfty villages had been planted by them.
The civil war in England’? threatened a total subversion of the government, and
the Puritans began to reﬁect on the establishment of an independent na.tion east-

ward of the Dutch domini'ons.9

15. An union of the New England colonies was proposed [1637] at the close
of the Eequod VVar;' It was not consummated until 1643, when the colonies of
I’lymoutl1,”’ Massachusetts,“ Connecticut and New Haven, 13 confederated for
mutual welfare. Rhode Island asked for admittance into the Union [1643j,»
but was refused,13 unless it would acknowledge the authority of Plyrnoutli.
Local jurisdiction was jealously reserved by each colony, and the doctrine (f

without consulting the colonists. _The inﬂexible courage of the latter prevented the evil that might have
ensued by this faithless act of a company which had made extensive grants, and they ﬁrmly held the
charter given to them by the king. 1.

which was then located at Cambridge, and it received the name ot “ Haivard College,” now one of the
ﬁrst Seminaries of learning in the United States. In 1647 a law was passed, requiring every township,

similarity in manners and institutions prevailed over that whole extent of
country. - » '

5. The Indians spoke agreat variety of dialects,1 but there existed not more
than eight radically distinct languages among the whole aboriginals, from the
Atlantic to the Mississippi, and beyond, namely: _ALGONQUIN, HURON-IROQUOIS,
CHEROKEE, CATAWBA, UCHEE, NATCHEZ, MOBILIAN, and DAHCOTAH or SIOUX.
These occupied a region embraced within about twenty-four degrees of latitude
and almost forty degrees of longitude, and covering a greater portion of the

_ breadth of the north temperate zone.

6. In physical character, moral sentiment, social and political organization and
religious belief, all the nations and tribes were similar. They were all of a cop-
per color; were tall, straight, and well-proportioned; their eyes black and ex-
pressive; their hair black, long, coarse, and perfectly straight; their constitution
vigorous, and their powers of endurance remarkable. Bodily deformity was
almost unknown, and few diseases prevailed. They were indolent, taciturn, and
unsocial; brave, and sometimes generous, in war; unﬂinching under torture;
revengeful, treacherous, and morose when injured or offended; not always grate-
ful for favors; grave and sagacious in council; often eloquent in speech; some-
times warm and constant in friendship, and occasionally courteous and polite.

7. The men were employed in war, hunting, and

ﬁshing. The women performed all menial services.
They bore all burdens during journeys; spread the
tents; prepared food; dressed skins" for clothing;
wove mats for beds, made of -the bark of trees;
and planted and gathered the scanty crops of corn,
beans, peas, potatoes, melons, and tobacco. Their
Wigwams, or houses, were rude huts, made of poles
covered with mats, skins, or bark of trees, and all
of their domestic arrangements were very sim-
ple. - "
8._ Their implements were made of stones, shells, and bones, with which they
prepared their food, made their clothing and habitations, and tilled their lands.
Their food consisted of a few vegetables, and the meat of the
deer, buffalo, and bear, generally‘ roasted upon the points of
sticks, sometimes boiled in water heated by hot stones, and
always eaten without salt. Their dress in summer was a
slight covering around the loins. In winter they were clad in
the skins of wild beasts,“ often profusely ornamented with the
claws of the bear, the horns of. the buffalo, the feathers of
birds, and the bones of ﬁshes. Their faces were often tat-
tooed, and generally painted with bright colors in hideous de-
vices. Their money was little tubes made of shells, fastened . ..  ..
upon belts or strung in chains, and called wampumﬁ It was w'A}_1PUM,

State Rights was thus early practically developed. It was a Confederacy of
independent States like our Union. The general affairs of the Confederacy were
managed by a board of commissioners, consisting of two church-members from
each colony, who were to meet annually, or oftener if required. Their duty was
to consider circumstances, and recommend ~measures for the general good.
They had no executive power. Their propositions were considered and acted
upon by the several colonies, each assuming an independent sovereignty. This
Confederacy remained unmolested_more than forty years‘ [1643—1686], during
which time the government of England was changed three times. ’
16. Massachusetts was always the leading colony of New England, and
assumed to be a “perfect republic.” After _the Union, a legislative change took
place. The representatives had hitherto held their sessions in the same room
with the governor and council; now they convened in a separate apartment;
and the distinct House of Representatives, or democratic branch of the legislature,
still existing in our Federal and State Governments, was established in 1644.
17. Unlike Virginia,‘3 the colonists sympathized with the English republicans
in their efforts to abolish royalty. Ardently attached to the Parliament, they
found in Cromwell,3 when he‘ assumed supreme authority, a sincere friend and
- protector of their liberties. N 0 longer

annoyed by the frowns and menaces
of royalty, the energies of the people
were rapidly developed, and proﬁtable
commerce was created between Massa-
chusetts and the West Indies. This
trade brought bullion4 into the Colony;
and in 1652, the authorities exercised
a prerogative of independent sover-
eignty, by establishing a mint, and
coining silver money,5 the ﬁrst within

the territory of the United States.

During the same year, settlements in the. present State of Maine, imitating the
act of those of New Hampshire“ eleven years earlier [1641], came under the
jurisdiction of Massachusetts. . ‘
18. An important element of trouble and perplexity was now introduced.
There arrived at Boston [July, 1656], two zealous religious women,7 called
Quakers. This was a sect recently evolved from the heaving masses of English
soCiety,8 Claiming to be more rigid Puritans than all who had preceded them.
Letters unfavorable to the sect had been received in the colony, and the two

1. When James the Second came to the throne, the charters of all the colonies were taken away, or
suspended. When local governments were re-established after tl1e revolution of 1688, there no longer
ergisted a necessity for the Union, and the Confederacy dissolved.

5. In October, 1651, the general court or legislature of Massachusetts ordered silver coins of the
values of threepence, sixpence, and a shilling sterling, to be made. The mint—master was allowed tif-
teen pence out of every twenty shillings, for his trouble. He made alarge fortune by the business.
From the circumstance that the effigy of a pine-tree was stamped on one side, these coins, now very
rare, are called p2'7ze—tree money. The date [1652] was not altered for thirty years. Massachusetts was
also the ﬁrst to issue paper money in the shape of treasury notes, in 1690. [See verse 37, p. 97].

women were cast into prison, and conﬁned for several weeks,‘ With eight
others who arrived during the year, they were sent. back to England? Others
came, and a special act against the Quakers was put in force [I657], but to no
purpose. Opposition increased their zeal, and precisely because they were not
wanted, they came. They suffered stripes, imprisonments, and general con-
tempt; and «ﬁnally, on the recommendation of the Federal Commissioners,3
Massachusetts, by a majority of one vote, banished them, on pain of death [I658].
The excuse pleaded in extenuation of this barbarous law was, that the Quakers
preached doctrines dangerous to good government/1 _ A

19. The death penalty did not deter the exiles from returning; and many
others came because they courted the martyr’s death and reward. Some were
hanged, others were publicly whipped, and the prisons were soon ﬁlled with
the persecuted sect. The severity of the law ﬁnally caused a strong expression
of public sentiment against it. The Quakers were regarded as true martyrs, and
the people demanded of the magistrates a cessation of the bloody and barbarous
punishments. The death penalty was soon [1661] abolished; the fanaticism of
the magistrates and the Quakers subsided, and a more Christian spirit of tolera-
tion prevailed. N 0 longer sufferers for opinion’s sake, the Quakers turned their
attention to the Indian tribes, and nobly seconded the efforts of Mahew and
Eliot in the propagation of the gospel among the pagans of the forest.-‘3

20. On the restoration of monarchy [1660], the judges who- condemned
Charles the First to the block, were outlawed. Two of them (Wni. Groffe and
Edward Wlialley) ﬂed to America, and were the ﬁrst to announce at Boston
the accession of Charles the Second. Orders were sent for their arrest, and
officers were despatched from England for the same purpose. The.colonists
effectually concealed them, and for this a‘ct, and the general sympathy mani-
fested by New England for the republican party, the king resolved to Show
them no favor. They had been exempt from commercial restrictions during
Cromwell’s administration; now these were revived, and the stringent pro-
visions of .a new Navigation Act‘? were rigorously enforced. The people vainly
petitionedfor relief; and, ﬁnally, commissioners were sent [August, 1644.] “to
hear and determine all complaints that might exist in New England, and take
such measures asthey might deem expedient for settling the peace and Security
of the country, on a solid foundation.”7

1. Their trunks were searched, and the religious books found in them were burned by the hangman,
on Boston Common. Suspected of being witches [note 7, p. 98], their persons were examined in order to
discover certain marks which would indicate their connection with the Evil One.

2. Mary Fisher went allthe way from London to Adrianople, to carry a divine message to the Sultan.
She was regarded as insane ; and as the Moslems respect such people as special favorites of God, Mary
Fisher was unharmed in the Sultan’s dominions.

3. Verse 15, p. 89. V

4. The Quakers denied all human authority, and regarded the power of magistrates as delegated
tyranny. They preached purity of life, charity in its broadest sense, and denied the right of any man
to control the opinions of another. Conscience, or “ the light within,” was considered a sufﬁcient guide,
and they deemed it their special mission to denounce “hireling ministers” and “persecuting magis-
trates,” in person. It was this offensive boldness which engendered the violent hatred toward the sect
in England and America. ’

5. John Eliot has been truly called the Apostle to the Indians. He began his labors soon after his
arrival in America, and founded the first church among the savages, at N atic, in 1660, at which time
there were ten towns of converted Indians in Massachusetts. ’l‘hirty-ﬁve years later, it was estimated
that there were not less than 3,000 adult Christian Indians in the islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nan-
tucket, alone.

92 i COLONIES.

21. The colonists regarded this rneasure with indignation, not only as a viola-
tion of their charters, but as an incipient step toward establishing a system of
domination, destructive to their liberties. Massachusetts boldly protested

against the exercise of their authority within her limits, but at the same time 6

asserted her loyalty to the sovereign. The commissioners experienced the
opposition of the other New England colonies, except Rhode Isla.nd. Their acts
were generally disregarded, and after producing a great deal of irritation, they
were recalled. [l666]. The people of Massachusetts, triumphant in their oppo-
sition to royal oppression, ever afterward took a front rank in the march toward
complete freedom. The licentious king and his ministers were too much in love
with voluptuous ease, to trouble themselves with far off colonies; and while Old
England was suffering from bad government, and the puissance of the throne
was lessening in the estimation of the nations, the colonies ﬂourished in purity,
peace, a.nd strength, until Metacomet, the son of the good Massaso-it,‘ kindled a
most disastrous Indian‘ war, known in history as

KING PHILIP’s WAR.

friendship, and kept them inviolate for a dozen
years. But as spreading settlements were re-
ducing his domains acre by acre, breaking up
his hunting grounds, diminishing his ﬁsheries,
and menacing his nation with servitude or anni-
hilation, his patriotism was aroused, and he will-
ingly listened to the hot young warriors of his
tribe, who counselled a War of extermination
against the English. At Mount Hope_,4 the seat
of the chief sachems of the ‘T/Vampanoags, in the
solitudes of the primeval forests, he planned,
. with consummate skill, an alliance of all the

KING PHILIR New England tribes5 against the European in-
truders.
23. One of the “praying Indians” (as the converted ones were called),5 was a

 

I sort of secretary to Philip, and, after becoming acquainted with the plans of the

sachem, he revealed them to the authorities at Plymouth. For this he was slain
by his countrymen, and three VV0ompcm0ags were convicted of his murder, on
slender testimony, and hanged. The ire of the tribe was ﬁercely kindled, and
they thirsted for vengeance. The cautious Philip was overruled by his ﬁery

3. Massasoit had two sons, whom governor Prince named Alexander and Philip, in compliment to
their bravery as warriors. Alexander died soon after the decease of his father; and Philip became
chief sachem of the Wampamaags.

4." Mount Hope is a conical hill, 300 feet in height, and situated on the west side of Mount Hope Bay,
about two miles from Bristol, Rhode Island. It was called Pokanoket, by the Indians.

5. The tribes which became involved in this war, numbered, probably, about 25,000. Those along
the coast of Massachusetts Bay, who had sulfered terribly by a pestilence just before the P1LGR1Ms
came [verse 1, p. 84], had materially increased in numbers 2 and other tribes, besides the New Englaml
Indians proper [verse 15, p. 16], became parties to the conflict.

young men, and remembering the wrongs and humiliations he had personally re-
ceived from_ the English,1 he trampled upon solemn treaties, sent his women and
children to the Narmgcmsets for protection, and kindled the ﬂame of war. No
doubt he commenced hostilities contrary to the teachings of his better judgment,
for he was sagacious enough to foresee failure. “ Phrensy prompted their rising.
It was but the storm in which the ancient inhabitants of the land were to vanish
away. They rose without hope, and therefore they fought without mercy. To
them, as a nation, there was no to-morrow.”2

24. Philip struck the ﬁrst blow at Swanzey, thirty-ﬁve miles south-west from
Plymouth. The people were just returning from their houses of worship, for it
was a day of fasting and humiliation [July 4, 1675], in anticipation of hostilities.
Many were sla.in and captured, and others ﬂed to the surrounding settlements,
and aroused the people. The men of Plymouth, joined by those of Boston and
vicinity, pressed toward Mount Hope. Philip was besieged in a swamp for
many days, but escaped with most of his warriors, and became a fugitive with
the Nz'pmucs,3 an interior tribe of Massachusetts. These espoused his cause, and
with full ﬁfteen hundred warriors, he hastened toward the white settlements in
the far off valley of the Connecticut. In the meanwhile the little army of white
people penetrated the country of the Narmgcmsets,4 and extorted a treaty of
friendship from Canonchet,5 chief sachem of that powerful tribe. '

r 25. Philip and his followers aroused other tribes, to a war of extermination,
by the secret and efﬁcient methods of treachery, ambush, and surprise. Men in
the ﬁelds, families in their beds at midnight, and congregations in houses of Wor-
ship, were attacked and massacred. The Indians hung like the scythe of death
upon the borders of the English settlements, and for several months a gloomy
apprehension of the extermination of the whole European population in New
England, prevailed.5_ * . -

26. From Springﬁeld northward to the present Vermont line,the valley of the
Connecticut was a theatre of confusion, desolation and death, wherever white set-
tlements existed. Almost the whole of a party of twenty Englishmen7 sent to
treat with the Nvipmucs, were treacherously slain by the savages in ambush
[Aug. 12, 1675], near Quaboag, now Brookﬁeld. That place was set on ﬁre,
when a shower of rain put out the ﬂames, and the Indians were driven away by
a relief party of white people?‘ The village was pa.rtially saved, but immediately
abandoned. Soon afterward a hot battle was fought near Deerﬁeld9 [Sept. 5],
and a week later [Sept. 12] that settlement was laid in ashes. On the same
day (it was the Sabbath), Hadley, further down the river, was attacked while
the people were worshipping. In the midst of the alarm and confusion, a tall
and venerable looking man, with white, ﬂowing hair and beard, suddenly ap-

atfrighted people, and led them to a charge‘ which dispe1‘Sed«a11d defeated the
foe. He as suddenly disappeared, and the inhabitants believed that an angel
from heaven had been sent to their rescue. It was Crotfe, the fugitive English

. judge,‘ who was then concealed in that settlement.

27. On the 23d of September, the paths of Northﬁeld were wet with the
blood of many valiant young men under Captain Beers; and on the 28th, “a
company of young men, the very ﬂower of Essex,” under Captain Lathrop, were
butchered by almost a thousand Indians on the banks of a little stream near
Deerﬁeld, which still bears the name of Bloody Brook. Others, who came to
their’ rescue, were engaged many hours in combat With the Indians until
crowned with victory. _ .

28. Philip now resolved to attack Hatﬁeld, the chief settlement of the white
people above Springﬁeld. The Springﬁeld Indiansjoined him,9 and with
almost a thousand warriors, he fell [Oct. 29, 1675_}, upon the settlement. The
English were prepared for his reception, and he was repulsed with such loss,

that, gathering his broken forces on the eastern bank of the Connecticut,3 he ‘

marched toward Rhode Island. The Jvitrragansets, in violation of the recent
treaty,4 received him, became his allies, and went out upon the war path late in
autumn. Fifteen hundred men of Massachusetts, Plymouth and Connecticut,
marched to punish Canonchet and his. tribe, for their perﬁdy. The snows of
early winter had fallen, and at least three thousand Indians had collected in
their chief fort in an immense swamp,5 where they were supplied with pro-
visions for the winter. It was a stormy day in December [Dec. 29], when the
English stood before the feeble palisades of the savages. They offered but little
opposition to the beseigers; and within a few hours, ﬁve hundred wigwams,
with the winter provisions, were in ﬂames. Hundreds of men, women; and
children perished in the ﬁre. A thousand warriors were slain or wounded, and
several hundreds were made prisoners. The English lost eighty killed, and one
hundred and ﬁfty wounded. Canonchet was made prisoner, and slain; but
Philip escaped, and with the remnant of the Narmga-nsets, took refuge again
with the N t'pnz2tc5.

29. Philip was busy during the winter. He vainly solicited the Mohcmuksb’ to
join him, but he was seconded by the tribes eastward of Massachusetts,7 who
also had wrongs to redress." The work of desolation began early in the spring
of 1676, and within a few weeks the war extended over a space of almost three
hundred miles. Weymouth, Crroton, Medﬁeld, Lancaster, a.nd Marlborough, in
Massachusetts, were laid in ashes; Warwick and Providence, in Rhode Island,
were burned; and everywhere, the isolated dwellings of settlers were laid

waste. But internal feuds weakened the power of the savages; and both the
Nipmucsl and _the Narragansetsz charged their misfortunes to the ambition of
Philip. _ The cords of alliance were_severed. Some surrendered to avoid starva-
tion; other tribes wandered off and joined those in Canada;3 while capta.in
Church,4 the most famous of _ the _p_artisan oﬁcers of the English colonies, went
out to hunt and destroy the fugitives. During the year, between two andthrce
thousand ,j[ndia.ns were slain or had submitted. Philip was chased from one

hiding—place to another, but for a long time he would not yield. He once cleft

the head of a warrior who proposed submission.

30. The.“last of the I/Vampanoctgs” at length bowed to the pressure of cir-

cumstances. - He returned to the land of his fathers5 [August, 1676], and soon
his wife and son were made prisoners.- This calamity crushed him, and he
said, “Now my heart breaks; I am ready to die.” A few days afterward, a
faithless Indian shot him, and captain Church cut off the dead sachem’s head.5
His body. was quartered; and his little son was sold to be a bond-slave in Ber-
muda.7 So ‘perished the last of the princes ‘of the Wampanoags, and thus ended,
in the total destruction of the power of the’New England Indians, the famous
“ KING Pr-IILn>’s WAR.”8

31. While the Massachusetts colony was yet weak in resources, from the
effects of the Indian war,9 and the people were yet engaged in hostilities with
the Eastern tribes,” it made territorial accessions by purchase, and at the same
time boldly asserted its chartered rights. For many years there had been a.con-
troversy between the heirs of Sir F. Gorges“ and John Mason and the Massa-

chusetts colony, concerning a portion of the present territory of Maine and New _

Hampshire, which, by acts of the inhabitants, had been placed [1641 and 1652]
under the jurisdiction of the authorities_at Boston.” The judicial decision was in
favor of the heirs ‘[167 7], and Massachusetts immediately purchased [May 1,
1677] their interest, for six thousand dollars.13 New Hampshire was detached
three years afterward [I680], and made a royal province—the ﬁrst in New
England; but Maine, which was incorporated with Massachusetts in 1692, con-
tinued a part of that commonwealth until 1820. ,

32. The profligate king continued to drawthe lines of absolute rule closer
and closer in England, and he both feared and hated the growing republics in
America, especially those in the East. They were ostensibly loyal portions of

his realm, but were really independent sovereignties, continually reacting upon

7. The disposal of the boy was a subject of serious deliberation. » Some of the elders proposed putting
him to death; others, professing more mercy, suggested selling him as a slave. The most proﬁtable
measure appeared the most‘ merciful, and the child was sold into bondage. The head of Philip was
carried in triumph to Plymouth, and placed upon a pole. -

8. The result of this war was vastly beneﬁcial to the colonists, for the fear of savages, which prevented .

a rapid spread of settlements, was removed. From this period may be dated the real, unimpeded growth
of New England.

9. During the war, New England lost six hundredmen ; a dozen towns were destroyed ;,six hundred
dwellings were burned ; every twentieth family -was hpuseless ; and every twentieth man, who had
served as a soldier, had perished. The cost of the war equalled ﬁve hundred thousand dollars ; a very
large sum at that time. ‘ .

the mother country, to the damage of the “divine right” of kings. Charles had’

long cherished a desire to take their governments into his own hands, and be
employed the occasion of the rejection of Edward Randolph (a custom-house
officer, who had been sent to Boston [1679] to collect the revenues and other-

wise exercise authority),1 to declare the Massachusetts charter void. He issued ’

a quo wwrrcmzfo [1683],'4 and procured a decision in his favor in the high-court of
chancery [June 28, 1684], but he died [Feb. 26,1685], before his object was
effected. ,

' 33. James the Second3 continued the oppressive measures of his brother to.
ward the New England colonies. The people petitioned and remonstrated,
and were treated with contempt. Their hardships in conquering a wilder-
ness, and their devotion to the English constitution, had no weight with the
royal bigot.4 He also declared the charter of Massachusets forfeited, and ap-
pointed Joseph Dudley president of the country from Bhode Island to Nova
Scotia. Sir Edmund Andros arrived at Boston soon afterward [Dec. 30, 1686],
clothed with authority to govern all New England. He came with a smiling
face, but deceitful lips. He appears to have been a tyrant by nature, and
came to execute a despot’s will. He soon made bare the rod of oppression, and
began to rule with a tyrant’s rigor.5 The people were about to practice, the
doctrine that “resz'szfcmce to tyrants 2'3 obedience to God,” when intelligence
reached Boston [April 14, 1689], that James was driven from the throne'[1688],
and was succeeded by William and Mary, of Orange.7 The inhabitants of
Boston seized and imprisoned Andros and ﬁfty of his political associates [April
28, 1689], sent them to England under a just charge of mal-a.dministration of
public affairs, and re-established their constitutional government. Again repub-
licanism was triumphant in Massachusetts.

34. The revolution in England3 was a cause of war between that country and
France. James (who was a Roman Catholic), ﬂed to the court of Louis the
Fourteenth, king of France, and that monarch espoused the cause of the fugitive.
Hostilities between the two nations commenced the same year, and the quarrel

extended to their respective colonies in America. The conﬂict, which continued .

more than seven years, is known in history as
KING W1LLIAM’s WAR.

35. In this contest, the colonists suffered terribly. The French J esuits,9 who
had acquired great influence over the eastern tribes,” easily excited them to re-
new their ﬁerce warfare with the English. They also made the savages their

1. Randolph appears to have been a greedy adventurer, and was, consequently, a faithful servant of
his royal master, in oppressing the colonists. He exaggerated the number and resources of the people
of New England, and thus excited the king-‘s fears and cupidity. Previous to Randolph’s appointment,
the colony had despatched agents to England, to settle impending ditﬁculties amicably. They failed,
and Randolph came in the same vessel in which they returned. '

2. Note 1, p. 78. 3. Verse 28, p. 83. 4. Note 6, p. 83.

5. Among other arbitrary acts, Andros laid restraints upon the f zeedom of the press, and marriage
contracts; and, to use a modern term, he “levied blaclé mail ;” that is, extorted money, by menaces,
whenever opportunity offered. He advanced the fees of all officers of the government to an exorbitant
degree ; and ﬁnally threatened to make the Church of England the established religion in all America.

9. This was a Roman Catholic religious order, founded by Ignatius Loyola, a Spaniard, in 1539. They
have ever been remarkable for their great devotion to their cause, their self-denial, and masterly sag-
gacity in the acquiremeut and maintenance of power. Their missionaries preached Christianity in
every part of the habitable globe. They came with the ﬁrst French adventurers to America, and under
their inﬂuence, whole tribes of Indians eastward of Massachusetts and in Canada, were made nominal
Christians. This was one of the ties which made the savages such faithful allies to the French during
the contests between them and the English, previous to 1763.

allies; and all along the frontier settlements, the pathway of murder and desola-
tion was seen. Dover, a frontier town, was ﬁrst attacked by a party of French
and Indians [July 7, 1689] ; and the venerable Major Waldron‘ and twenty
others of the little garrison were killed. Twenty-nine of the inhabitants were
made captive, and sold as servants to the French in Canada. In August follow-
ing, an Indian war party, instigated by Thury, a Jesuit, fell [August 12] upon
an English Stockade‘? at Pemaquid (built by Andros), and captured the garrison.
A few months later, Frontenac’ sent a party of three hundred French and
Indians from Montreal, to penetrate the country toward Albany. On a gloomy
night in winter, when the snow was twenty inches in depth, they fell upon
Schenectada [Feb. 18, 1690], a frontier town on the Mohawk, massacred many
of the people, and burned the Village. Early in the spring, Salmon Falls
[March 28], Casco [May 27], and other eastern villages, were attacked by an-
other party of the same mongrel foe, the natural ferocity of the Indians being
quickened by the teachings of the Jesuits concerning the proper fate of heretics.4

3.6. These atrocities aroused all the colonies to a sense of their danger in having
such foes intent upon their destruction; and the New England people resolved
on speedy retaliation. In May. Massachusetts ﬁtted out an expedition, under
Sir William Phipps, a native of Pemaquid, consisting of eight or nine vessels, with
about eight hundred men. Phipps seized Port Royal,’5 in Acadie, and obtained
suliicient plunder from the inhabitants to pay the expenses of the expedition. In
June, Port Royal was again plundered by English privateers from the West

. Indies.

37. Encouraged by the success in Acadie, the colonies of New England and
New York coalesced in efforts to conquer Canada.6 It was arranged to send a

land expedition from New York, by way of Lake Champlain, against Montreal,7 .

and a naval expedition against Quebec.3 The command of the former was in-

trusted to the son of governor Winthrop of Connecticut,9 and the expense was -
borne jointly bythat colony and New York.” Sir William Phipps commanded.

the latter, which Massachusetts alone fitted out. It consisted of thirty-four
vessels, with two thousand men. Both were unsuccessful. . Some of Winthrop’s
troops, with Indians of the FIVE NATIONS,“ under colonel Schuyler, pushed to-
ward the St. Lawrence, and were repulsed [Aug 1690] by Frontenac, the
governor of Canada. The remainder did not go beyond Wood Creek, now
Whitehall, at the head of Lake Champlain, and all returned to Albany}? Phipps
reached Quebec about the middle of October, and landed the troops; but the
city was too strongly fortiﬁed 13 to promise a successful siege, and he returned

4. In these massacres, instigated by the Jesuits, we may ﬁnd a reason for the seeming intolerance of
the Protestant majority in Maryland [verse 5, p. 113], the disabilities of Roman Catholics in Virginia,
New York and New England, and their exclusion from the privileges of freemen, in tolerant Rhode
Island. The most potent operations of the Jesuits were in secret, and the colonists were compelled to
regard every Roman Catholic as the natural enemy of Protestants, and laboring to destroy every meas-
ure tending to human freedom.

to Boston before the winter set in.‘ Massachusetts was obliged to issue bills of
credit, or paper money, to defray the expenses of this expedition?

38. Soon after his return, Sir 'William Phipps was sent to England to solicit aid.

in further warfare upon the French and Indians, and also to assist in efforts to
procure a restoration of the charter of Massachusetts, taken away by king
J'ames.3 Assistance wa.s refused; and king William, instead of restoring the old
charter, granted a new one, and united under itthe colonies of Plymouth, Mas-
sachusetts, Maine and Nova Scotia,‘ by the old name of Massachusetts Bay
Colony, and made it a royal province. Phipps was appointed governor by the
king, and returned to Boston with the charter, in May 1692. .

39. The new constitution was offensive to the people, for they were allowed
scarcely any other political privilege, except the right to choose representatives.
The king reserved the right to appoint the governor, his deputy, and the secre-
tary of the colony, and of repealing the laws within three years after their pas-
sage. This abridgment of their liberties produced general dissatisfaction, and
alienated the affections of the people from the mother country. 1 It was one of a
series of fatal steps taken by the English government, which tended toward the
final dismemberment of the empire in 1776.5 Yet one good resulted from the
change. The theocratic or religious element in the government, which fostered
bigotry and intolerance, lost its power,‘ for toleration was guarantied to all
Christian sects, except Roman Catholics; and the right of suffrage was ex-

lief in witchcraft7 destroyed the peace "of society in many communities, and
shrouded the whole colony in a cloud of gloom. This belief had a strong hold
upon the minds of the people of old England, and of. their brethren in America.
Excitement upon the subject suddenly broke out :at;Danv.ers [March 1692] (then
apart of Salem), and spread like an epidemic. ':A’.'n._iec‘e and daughter of the

parish minister exhibited strange conduct ; and .underv"tli‘e'inﬂuence of their own‘

superstitious belief, they accused an old Indian servant-woman in the family, of be-
witching them. Fasting and prayer, to break the “ spell,” were of no avail, for
their malady increased. The alarm of the family spread to the conimunity; and
soon a belief prevailed throughout the colony, that evil spirits, having minister-
ing servants among men, overshadowed the land. Old and ill-favored women were
ﬁrst accused of practising the art of witchcraft; but at'.length neither age, sex,
nor condition afforded protection from» the accuser’s tongue. Even-the lady of
governor Phipps did not escape suspicion. Magistrates-were condemned, many

pious persons were imprisoned, and Mr. Burroughs, a worthy minister, was ex-'

7. A belief in witchcraft, or the exercise of supernatural power, by men and women, has been preva-
lent for ages. Punishment of persons accused of it, was ﬁrst sanctioned by the Church of Rome a little
more than three hundred years ago. Certain tests were instituted, and thousands of innocent persons
were burnt alive, drowned, or hanged, in Europe. Within three months, in 1515, ﬁve hundred persons
were burnt in Geneva, in Switzerland. In the diocese of Come, one thousand were burnt in one year.
In 1520, an incredible number, from among all classes, sulfered death in France. And within ﬁfty or
sixty years, during the sixteenthrceutury, more than one hundred thousand personsperished in the
ﬂames in Germany alone. Henry the Eighth of England made the practice of witchcraft a capital of-
fence; and a hundred years later, “ witch-detecters” traversed the country, and brought many t.o the
stake. Enlightened men embraced the belief; and even Sir Matthew Hale, the most distinguished of
England’s judges, repeatedly tried and condemned persons accused of witchcraft. The English laws
against witchcraft were adopted in New England ; and as early as 1648, four persons had suffered death
for the alleged offence, in the vicinity of Boston. ‘

ecuted- For more than six months the awful delusion prevailed ; and during
that time, twenty persons suffered death, ﬁfty-ﬁvewere tortured, or frightened’
C into a confession of witchcraft, and when a special court, or legislature, was

convened in October [l692], one hundred a.nd ﬁfty accused persons were in
prison. A reaction,«almost as sudden ‘as the beginning of the excitement, now
took place in the public mind- The prison doors were opened to the accused,-
and soon many of the accusers shrunk abashed from the public gaze.‘ Standing
in the light of the present century, we look back to f‘Salem witchcraft,” as it is
called, with amazement. . ‘

made at Ryswick [Sept. 20] in the west of Holland, terminated hosti_l_ities.3 Up

to that time, and later, the New England people sutfered greatly} from their

mongrel foe. Remote settlements in the direction of Canada. and N ova Scotia
continued to be harassed. Almost a hundred persons were killed orjniade’ cap-
tive [July 28, 1694] at Oyster river (now Durham), ten miles from ,Portsr_n’(__)utl1,
in New Hampshire. Two years later, Baron St. Castine, a.nd alarge force. of
French and Indians, captured [July 25, 1696] the garrison at 'Pemaquid,?an‘d
exchanged the prisoners for French soldiers in the hands of the English.‘«‘‘ ‘ In
March, 1697, Havershill, thirty miles from Boston, was attacked, and forty per-
sons were killed or carried into captivity ;5 and during the following summer,
more remote settlers were great sufferers. ,

42. The treaty at Ryswick produced a lull in the storm of cruel warfare,
which had so long hung upon the English frontiers, continually menacing the col-
onists with wide-spread destruction.6 It was very brief, for pretexts for
another war were not long wanting. James the Second died in September 1701',
and Louis the Fourteenth, who had sheltered the eXile,7 acknowledged his son,
Charles Edward (commonly known as The Pretender), to be the lawful heir to
the English throne. This offended the English, because the crown had been
settled upon Anne, second daughter of James, who was a Protestant. Louis
had also offended the English, by placing his grandson, Philip of Anjou, upon
the throne of Spain, and thus extended the influence of France among the
dynasties of Europe. These, and some minor causes, impelled England to de-
clare war against France.3 Hostilities commenced in 1702, and continued until
a treaty of peace was concluded at Utrecht [April 11., 1713], in Holland. The
French and English in America were involved in this war; and the latter suf-

1. The belief in witchcraft did not cease with the strange excitement ; and Cotton Mather and other
popular men, wrote in its defence. Calef, a citizen of Boston, exposed Mather’s crednlity, which
greatly irritated the minister. He ﬁrst called his opponent“ a weaver turned minister ;” but as his
tormentor’s blows fell thick and fast, in a series of letters, Mather called him “ a coal from hell,” and
prgseleuted him for slander. The credulous clergyman was glad to withdraw the suit. - ‘

hundred millions more. This loan was the commencement of the enormous national debt of England,
now [1854] amounting to about four thousand millions of dollars.

she and her nurse were taken'to Canada. A little more than a month afterward, Mrs. D., her compan-
ion, and another prisoner, killed ten of twelve sleeping Indians, who had them in custody, and made
their way back to Haverhill. _ _

6. Just before the conclusion of this treaty, a Board of Trade and Plantations was established by the
English government, whose duty it was to have a general oversight of the American colonies. This was
a permanent commission, consisting of a president and seven members, called Lords of Trade. This
commission was always an instrument of oppression in the hands of royalty, and, as will be seen, was a
powerful promoter of that discontent which led to the rebellion of the colonies in 1775.
