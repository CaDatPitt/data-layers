An old bird with a worm in

As Ward felt the birds, and
gave a turn to keep them off, he
fell from the tree, and hurt his
hip and his head.
A man who was not far off
saw Ward fall, and ran up to
him. As he fell on a heap of
hay, it did not kill him. He was
ill for more than a week, and did
not stir a step from his bed. He
knew no ease, nor rest, but wept

some snow on her frock; but the

I.PREFACE.
IN the preparation of this little volume, we have aimed to
perfect, as far as presented, the popular plan first made
known in "The Word-Builder, or National First Reader,"
some three years since; and, by the quality and arrangement of the matter, and the beauty of the pictorial illustrations, tP render "First Lessons in Reading" promotive of
smiles and delight, rather than of vexation and tears.
The word-method here presented unites all the advantages
of the old system of teaching to read, by first commencing
with the alphabet, and the new and preferable one, which
begins with entire words. It differs from all others in commencing with the three words of one letter, and gradually
forming additional lists by simply prefixing or affixing single
letters; in arranging the lists of words with regard to their
formation and vowel sounds, in alphabetical order; and in
the completeness and gradation of the reading exercises,
which embrace all the words that appear in the lists, and
only those that have been previously taught.
This work has been restricted to about fifteen hundred
monosyllables, none of which contain more than five lettenrs
It is confidently believed that the young pupil can acquire
a thorough knowledge of the meaning and use of these
words, in the reading exercises, as well as of their orthography and pronunciation, in the lists, and thus secure a
stable foundation upon which a beautiful edifice may be
erected in accordalnce with the laws of science.
