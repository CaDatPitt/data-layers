19PRE F ACE.
THE phenomenal success of the  First Steps in Geography," during a period of more than thirty years, and its present popularity and wide circulation
among the teachers of Primary Classes, have induced thlle publishers to present
this new and attractive little work, in which is retained the original system of
imparting geographical knowledge to the young, while the plan is practical
and modern.  It is designed as an introductory book to any Series, and is confined to subjects which the beginner can readily master.  The most general
features only are treated, and these are impressed on the learner's mind by
appropriate object-lessons.  The style is catechetical; the answers to the
questions are brief, pointed, and expressed in language exceedingly simple and
easily committed.  Clear and beautiful maps in color, unencumbered with
names not referred to in the text, are introduced, not as mere illustrations)
but to be memorized, in their few conspicuous features, as carefully as the
answers in the several lessons.  Fresh and instructive designs, by leading artists,
further serve to fix the pupil's attention; and his memory is assisted by frequent reviews
Step by step, the little learner, having acquired the idea of direction and
formed definite conceptions of the Natural Divisions of land and water through
the aid of pictures and diagrams, is led out from his own State and country,
and made acquainted briefly but interestingly with foreign lands and strange
peoples.  Thus, while the successive lessons are mastered with surprising
facility, a taste for geographical investigation is at the same time formed and
fostered
