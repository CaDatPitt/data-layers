and sentences, which very much retards the natural
inclination of a boy to write a rapidcl business-hand.
CRITICISM.-T/he line of beauty.-The teacher, writing the line of beauty (page 9, Book No. 3) on the
blackboard in an irregular manner, calls upon the
scholars to criticise.
Remarks like the following are made by the
class:--
"It is not curved enough at the top and bottom.
It slopes wrong. The dot at the bottom is too high.
It is made too heavy." The teacher asks, "How
should the line of beauty be made?" Answer:
"The curves at the top and bottom should be equal;
the dot half the height of the i above the line, and
the line made light and not shaded."
The word Anson. (Page 10, Book No. 3.)-The
teacher writes the word Anson on the board, beginning it with a capital, and calls for criticisms.
One says, "The curve in the A crosses up too high."
Another: "The last part of the n is below the line."

fourth: "The o is left open."  A  fifth: "Trhe

98CHAPTER IX.
THE UTILITY OF A GOOD HANDWRITING.
No one can dloubt, who gives a little thought to
the subject, that in the matter of pecuniary profit, a
man who writes a good hand has the greater advantage. He is the first man to win a good situation as
copyist or clerk, andcl other attainments and capacities
being the same, he holdcls it longer than a poor penman. There are other considerations more noble
than these. It is more pleasing at the first to look
upon a fair, clear written page, than upon one blotted,
blurred, slurred, scrawled over, by a slovenly hanld.
And in writings that are to enldure from one to
another generation, it is far more likely to be the
good than the poor writer whose service is securedl
to make them. If there be aclcdded to the virtue of
neatness some simple, tasteful decoration, seen in a
handclsomely shacldedl capital, a boldclly struck loop in
the 1 principle, a symmetrically dottedcl i, an elegantly
cut 0; these beauties, saying nothing of others that
a skilful hand might add, surely make the writing
pleasant to look upon and pleasant to read, and not

a little praise the skill, carefulness, and good taste
of the penman who executed the work.*
In the matter of plain legibility, too, there is quite
an advantage. Indcleed, of the work of a rude writer
we might be tempted to say that although curves
may sometimes not be so neatly finished or principles not so accurately shaded, there is still a certain
grace of manner apparent that strikes the reader
with a pleasing fancy, and atones in part for the
variation from an exactly scientific hand.  This,
however, must be said only of one whose hand is
fixed, and who, understanding the principles of a
good handwriting, having conformed strictly to
them while learning to write, departs, out of an inadvertent anld inward sense of fitnless and beauty,
from the finished perfection of the copy-bookwriting of his school-boy days. This grace could
not have been attained except by. long and careful
practice upon elements, and by subsequent experiment with his own hand upon what appear to him
* The author of this treatise once said to a man who wrote
a beautiful hand, " How did you attain such a beautiful handwriting?" "I spent twenty years in acquiring it," was the
reply. With a thorough system, well practised, the attainment
of a good style of penmanship is now the work of but a few
months.

to be the most beautiful and fitting forms.      In a
few words, a man may form his own style after due
practice alnd faithfulnless in the minor andcl simpler
elements of the art. Alcnd the chief merit of a goodcl
style is its easy reading.   Letter by letter appeals
by itself to the eye as a single, separate, and clearly
wrought character; sentence after senltenlce glanced
along appears as clear to the vision of a reader as
the tones of a good speaker to the ear of a listener.
There is a sort of satisfaction that tells one as he
reads, howA much better it is to be sca-nning this neat,
well-written page, than to struggle andcl to stop to
guess at words by their coinnections, and after all
to be half in doubt about what a writer really means
to say. To one accustomed to readcl manuscript, a
good handwriting shouldcl appear as legible as
printing.*
* The reader will remember his own amusement at the story
of a dclealer in rare animals, who ordered from the East two
monkeys, and who was exceedingly mortified and confused
when he receivedfifty of these mischievous animals fresh from
ship-board, with a letter from his consignor, regretting that he
could send but half the number ordered, owing to the scarcity
of monkeys, but would forward the remainder of them by the
next ship that sailed.  The unifortunate showman had neglectedc to cross a t, and had spelled two with a double o. HTe
had received, as he had written for them, 100 monkeys.

101UTILITY OF A GOOD HANDWRITING.
Who shall say too, how much ill-temper has been
displayed and wickedly indulgedl by a weary compositor in some very busy printing-office over the
foul copy of a badcl penman, when, with eyes aching
from over-work, he peers anxiously over his case at
the copy, till. in his despair or loss of patience, he
puts in the nearest word he thinks of that looks like
the scrawl to be set up, althlough from tlhe illegibility
of the whole manauscript he can hardly make sense
of what he has laboriously worked uponl.    One
wonders at the great skill that a printer gains in
deciphering MSS. which it would puzzle a Champollion or a Layard to read.
But it must be very evident to all, when fairly
canvassed, that a bold, free easy style of handwriting, legible, elegant, business-like, and pleasing to the eye, is a truly worthy attainment. A
poor writer has little prospect of a remunerative
position at a counting-room desk; and, because the
better writers gain the better places at first, and
hold favor with common readers longest, because
they dclo work that will please poor readers and gra.
tify good printers, and because tastefulness is a
matter not lightly to be prized in any art, no sensible person will fail to believe hbe utility of lvarning
to write well.
102POTTER &amp; HAMMOND'S
SYNTHETICAL, ANALYTICAL, AND PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM
OF BUSINESS PENMANSHIP,
FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS.
REVISED AND IMPROVED, 1866.
In Three Distinct Series, viz.
1. THE SCHOOL SERIES-Nos. 1 to 9 inclusive.
2. THE LADIES' SERIES-Nos. 10 to 12 inclusive.
3. THE MERCANTILE AND ORNAMENTAL SERIES-Nos. 13 to 15 inclusive.
This System is far in advance of any other before the public,
and is an improvesnent over all others in respect to Originality (as documents and dates in possession of the authors will fully show), Systenmatic arrangement of Copies, Analysis and Rules for making the letters,
also 31athemnatical Exactness in their formation, Point8s of Criticism,
Beauty of Engraving, Ease and Elegance of Style, and, lastly, Paper
(made of linen fabric).
Your attention is requested to the following characteristics of this system:1. Thle Original Arranqement of Copies.-Discarding
the old alphabetical order of the letters, this system groups
them under six elemnentary principles-three for the small
letters and three for the capitals.
It is claimed that by this arrangement of the copies,
(103)POTTER &amp; HAMMOND'S SYSTEM.
after a system at once original, simple, and scient~fic--THE
GREATEST IMPROVEMENT OF TIIE AGE, in teaching writing,
has been effected.
This system gives the first complete arrangement of copies
throutghout a series of books, according to the similarity of
the formation of the letters, everpublished.
2. The System   is Scientifc and Progressive.-By this
original and scientific grouping of the letters, each letter
assists in the formation of the next. Every one can see
that practice in making the letter i will assist in forming
u w,, t, n, M, v, x, s; also the letter o will assist in forming a, d, c, e; the letter 1 prepares the way for making b,
h, k, j, y, z, g, q, f, and p.
The same progressive order follows in making the capital
letters. The practice required to lmake the letter A, assists
in forming N, and this in turn prepares the way for il. As
also P, B, R, S L, J 1, J.  The formiation of the letter T
assists in making F, Z, 11, and K; and in the same manner the letter 0 prepares the way for C, E, G, D, Q, V,
U, W, X, and Y.
This progressive grouping of the letters accordinlg to the
similarity of their formation, as carried into the copies of
most of the books in this series, is the origintal feature of
this system. This, in fact, is the great peculiarity of this
system over all others, presenting the most progressive
arrangement of copies ever presented to the public.
The authors claim to have presenited the first complete
set of progressive copies at the head of the page of a copy104POTTER &amp; HAMMOND'S SYSTEM.
book according to the similarity of the formation of the
letters, yet published. In all of the copy-books claiming
public favor at the time Potter &amp; Hammond's were published, the copies were miscellaneously and alphabetically
arranged. And they also claim to have written out the
first complete analysis and the rules for the formation of
each letter of the alphabet.
We do not claim any originality in the formation of the
letters, for there are as many different forms as there are
persons that write them. Probably we can claim as much
originality on this score as any one, but we do not see how
it is possible for any one to travel over the same road that
has been travelled by all the old masters of this beautiful
art, and claim that his path is a new one in this respect.
We do not wish to be understood to say that other systems of teaching, whether published or unpublished, with
all of their peculiarities, their practical classifications and
analyses, have no merits. We claim that ours is an improvement over all others published, for the reasons that we
have given. One of the best proofs of our system being
far superior in arrangement, is that many others dishonestly
appropriate what does not belong to them, and then turn
around and accuse us of plagiarism.
The manner of conducting exercises in writing is so
simple, the analysis and rules for the f'ormation of the
letters which are original and peculiar to this system alone,
are so perfect, that authors and agents are using them
105POTTER &amp; HAMMOND S SYSTEM.
(with slight alterations) to explain and introduce their own
copy-books.
We only a3k any candid person to examine this system,
comparing different editions of rival books, and the result
cannot leave any doubt as to the originality of this system.
The formation of every letter of the alphabet is made
a matter of study. Writing is no longer a simlple effort of
copying. This complete, original, and practical system of
penmanship has [during the last ten years] changed the
whole method of teaching writing from simply an ART to
be learned by imitation, to an EXACT SCIENCE, taught by
RULES and PRINCIPLES, like Arithmetic or Grammar.
3. The Stperior Style of Colpies.-The ease and grace
of these copies is unequalled by any rival books in this
country, or the world. The engraving is done by one of
the best engravers in the country, under the direction and
critical inspection of S. A. Potter.
By these books writing-easy, flowing, graceful writingis taught; not stiff, slow, painful pen-drawing.
These copies are unsurpassed in respect to neatness,
beauty, simplicity, exactness, accuraey, and ease.
4. Completeness.-The great popularity of these books,
and the rapidly increasing demand for them, hlave induced
the authors to extend the series, by the addition of several
imnportant books, and a division into
Three Separate Series.
These three series will now meet the wants of all, from
the young beginner in the primary school to the amateur

penman, who desires instruction in Flourished Capitals
and German Text. Instruction on the principles, analysis,
and mechanical structure of the letters, and every detail in
writing, teaching, or criticism, is found on the inside of the
cover of the copy-books.
The authors have also published the following
Helps for Teachers.
1. Eight Writing Charts.-These charts, mounted on
heavy pasteboard tablets, embrace all the principles, all
their combinations and applications, with examples in words.
Teachers say they are the most complete, methodical, and
valuable writing charts ever published.
2. The Business Writer contains complete instruction
in penmanship, and also a great variety of commercial
and ornamental writing, selected from Potter &amp; Hammond's Series of Copy-books. This little work is bound
in paper-covers, and may be sent by mail to any address.
3. The Pen Distributor is a small, neat wooden case,
containing drawers with numnbered grooves for each penholder, designed for distributing and collecting the pens at
the writing exercise, giving the pupil the same pen each
day, preventing all confusion. A patent-right has just been
granted for this beautiful piece of school furniture.
4. Slope Lines.-A guide to obtain the correct angle in
writing.

may record the reports of daily exercises in writing. There
are ten, points to be marked. This system of marking is
entirely original, and furnishes a perfect and definite guide
to the teacher in making up monthly or term reports,
besides being of great value in constantly directing the
attention of the pupil to the various points which make up
excellence in penmanship.

S. A. POTTER, EsQ.
Dear Sir:- I am pleased to find, on my return after an
absence of nearly a year in the armny, that you are still
diligently at work improving your excellent WritingBooks andcl Manual of Book-Keeping. The copies which
you have recently had re-engraved are really an improvement on those in the former edition; although I had
thought those left nothing to be desired. Your test questions and test set of accounts in the High Sdhool Edition
of Book-Keeping are a valuable addition to that work.
I have always thought such an addition would greatly
increase the value of the book for High Schools.
I wish to thank you personally for your highly successful
efforts in this department of education. After a somewhat
extended use of your Copy-Bookls and Book-Keeping in
my own school, and a frequent comparison with the leading
text-books upon the samie subjects, I feel authorized to say
that I consider yours-i. e., Potter &amp; Hammnond's-superior
to anything else now in use. I consider your method of
the analysis of the letters, andcl progressive development in
the copies of the principles on which the letters are formed,
a great improvemient on everything else.* And I ami sur10.                                 (109)prised to learn, as I have recently learned, that you have
been accused of plagiarism in this system of analysis.
I used your copy-books in 1855 and'6, and in the
spring and summer of 1856 took particular pains to compare them with everything I could find published upon the
subject of Penmanship, and I was thoroughly convinced
not only that your system of teaching writing was the best,
but that your classificatioa and analysis of the letters, and
consequent progressive development of the copies upon
this plan of analysis, were originlal with yourself-entirely
a new invention. I considered the plan of developing the
various letters of the alphabet upon this analytical principle in the copies of a writing-book a matter of great
importance in teaching penmnanship; and in this I found
you had invented an original method of teaching, of great
value.
You may not have forgotten some conversation which I
had with you upon the subject, while ydu were giving
lessons in my evening school in this city, in which I
expressed to you this conviction and my hope and belief
that on account of this important invention your system
would comie into general use.
You certainly have not forgotten the great snow-storm
in the winter of 1856, when you and I were blockaded in
Philadelphia, and I assisted you in revising this analysis
previous to re-cutting the plates from which your copies
were engraved, tnd in re-arranging and perfecting your
110
LETTERS.analysis and rules for the formation of every letter of the
alphabet, both small and great.
So far as I know, and as I most confidently believe, the
entire system developed in your copy-books is your own
invention. Previous to the issue of your books all systems
of writing were based principally upon the alphabetical
arrangement and miscellaneous copies.
Yours struck out a new path, and reduced the art of
writing to a science; I find other authors and publishers
in several instances have recently infringed upon your
plan, but I am greatly surprised that any envious business
rivals should so far depart from the truth and pervert
facts, as to charge you with borrowing from their work.
I believe the charge to be entirely false, and consider
niyself so conversant with the facts in the case that I could
not be mistaken; while I am fully aware that you, on the
other hand, have just cause of complaint that your system
has been borrowed and incorporated in part in the books
of your rivals, envious of your well-deserved success.
I am, however, happy to learn that your books are
rapidly gaining in public favor, and I venture to express
the hope and conviction that their ultimate success will
prove greater than that of any other system yet introduced
to the public.
With great respect, I am, very truly,
Yours,
WM. A. MOWRY.

MR. S. A. POTTER.
Dear Sir:-In disposing of my entire interest to you, in
Potter &amp; Hamnmond's System of Penmanship and BookKeeping, I deemn it necessary to offer some testimony in
your favor, which may be of some use to you in the coumpetition with publishers, and the slanders of their agents.
Having worked with you for the past eight years in
extending the sale of the Copy-Books, I have become fully
conversant with the tricks and falsehoods of book-agents,
and well know that the simple fact of my retiring from
business will be seized upon and wrought into every conceivable form, that can injure the sale of the books.
Do you remember, miy old partner, how, nine years ago
last summuer, we struck our hands together and mutually
promised each other, that in the strife of mercantile business we would never attempt to enrich ourselves by any
business that was not establishedcl and conducted on a
sound mioral basis?  All through that timie, I can look
back and discover not one departure fromn this principle on
your part.
In leaving you as a partner, I can assure you thlat you
do not lose a friend.  On the contrary, I shall always
interest myself directly in your business; and if at any
timie you should need mny assistance in originating, revising, or improving anything that will enhance the value of
your books, I ami cheerfully at your service.In view of these things, I offer to you the following
testimony, which you are at liberty to use in any manner
you see fit.
With high consideration,
I remain, dear Sir,
Very truly, yours,
W. P. HAMMOND.

1. The School Series-Nos. 1 to 9 inclusive.
No. 1 contains a drill exercise upon the formation of the
letters included under the i and o principles, in medium-sized
hand, with copies of short words.
No. 2 combines the drill upon the formation of the twenty-six
small and capital letters, in a smaller-sized hand, arranged under
their respective principles, with the proper manner of connecting them together in words.
In this and the two following numbers, particular attention
is given to the fore-arm and finger movements, by appropriate
exercises upon the elementary principles, and their various
combinations.
No. 3 exercises the pupil with a drill upon each letter of the
alphabet-both small letters and capitals-systematically arranged in the formation of words, in a smaller hand than that
of the preceding number.
No. 4 contains further exercises for the arm, words of medium
length, and a complete review of the whole system, in a still
finer hand.
The first six pages call attention to a drill exercise upon
waste paper to develop the fore-arm movement, the elbow
resting upon the desk, and the fore-arm moving freely.
The curve given upon the first page is described by the
natural movement of the arm laterally. The straight lines
are made by extending and contracting the fingers.
No. 5. The principal feature of this book is the systematic
arrangement of the capital letters for drill exercises, followed
by words commencing with these letters. The drill upon
capitals in this book is most systematic, thorough, and complete.
No. 6 contains proverbial sentences, systematically arranged.
No. 7 contains historical sentences, in a little finer hand.
No. 8 contains notes, drafts, bills, and other business forms.
No. 9 contains sentences in a larger hand than in the preceding numbers.
(116)DESCRIPTION OF THE COPY-LOOKS.
2. The Ladies' Series-which consists of ATos. 10 to 12 inclusive.
It is expected that learners will have written the school series
previous to their using this set, which it is thought they w-ill
then find well adapted to perfect them in an elegant and easy
handwriting. These, copies are, of course, in a finer hand than
the copies of the school series.
No. 10 contains short sentences, two on a page.
No. 11 has historical sentences in a finer hanid than those of
No. 10.
No. 12 is the Ladies' book of forms, each copy consisting of
four lines, and written in an easy, flowing manner, with a
variety of styles for the capital letters.
3. Mfercantile and Ornatmental Series-Nos. 13 to 15 inclusive.
This set is composed of Nos. 13 to 15 inclusive.
No. 13 contains words and sentences so arranged as to give
an extensive drill on the various styles of capital letters.
No. 14 is made up of various book-keeping forms, consisting
of the forms of entry in different kinds of business transactions.
The copies comprise four lines each, and contain a great variety of capital letters, with drill on the different styles.
It is the drill book of thie series, and should be written by all
who propose to study book-keeping before entering upon that
study. It is believed that this book will be found superior in
arrangement, and in the ease and elegance of the copies for
business writing, to any book ever before published.  This
book is original in its design and execution-nothing of the
kind has ever before been presented to the public. The copies
are arrangedc systematically, and the paper is ruled in colurAns
to correspond to the book-keeping forms.
No. 15 contains large coarse hand copies for engrossing purposes, Day Book and Ledger headings, and the various styles
of Ornamental Penmanship, including German Text, Old English, and Italic characters.
The former edition of No. 10, containing the large-hand
copies, will be furnished to those who prefer it.
117The attention of the reader is particularly called to the
enelosed specimens selected from Potter &amp; Hammond's
System of Penmanship. All of the cuts and samples in
this treatise are lithographed, and therefore are perfect
fac-similes of the copies-as seen in the copy-books.
(118)WRITING    CHIARTS.
Potter &amp; Hammond's series of Writing Charts, in eight*
numbers, embraces all the principles, with their combinations and applications. It is believed that these charts,
designed and copyrighted by S. A. Potter, are more complete, methodical, and valuable than any other series of
charts yet published.
They are designed to aid teachers in conducting the
writing exercises, especially to give exact and correct ideas
in reference to the size, shape, and proportions of the
letters.  For the complete analysis, rules for the formation
of the letters, manner of holding the pen, and conducting
exercises, the teacher is referred to the cover of the copybooks, circular; or to this treatise, "PENMANSHIP ExPLAINED."
Nos. 1 and 2 analyze the small letters; 3, 4, and 5, the
capitals, and No. 6 reviews and applies these letters in
words.
No. 1 discusses the i and the o principles. It first gives
the forms of these principles, then their various combinations in the letters  10 letters under the i principle and 5
under the o principle; after which, is a drill exercise followed by words formed by these letters combined.
No. 2 embraces the letters formed by the loop principle,
direct and inverted. This chart well illustrates the advan*Six charts for Common Schools and eight for High Schools.

Let any teacher take a pen and form these letters in the
following order, and practise making them for a few
minutes, and say whether the author of such a system of
analyzing and systematizing penmanship has not conferred
thereby a public benefit upon the schools of the country.
The proper order of these letters is I, b, h, k, j, y,, g, 2

length, size, &amp;c., of each letter is indicated by figures and
spaces.
In connection with the analysis, rules, &amp;c., on the cover
of the books, any intelligent, active teacher will be able,
by means of these charts, to teach penmanship successfully,
and to make the daily lesson in writing one of the most
interesting exercises of the schoolroom.
In these charts each letter is made after the most scientific standardform.  This is much better for elementary
drill than any of the varied business forms. In Arithmetic
ihe learner has a rule given him by which he may solve all
proper examples coming under that principle.  This rule
is exact, correct, and tersely expressed. The pupil becomes
acquainted with the rule and the process, understands the
reasoning in the case, becomes expert in solving examples
and problems by means of the rule; and then when he gets
into business life, if he chooses to vary from the special
method of this rule, he does so. He has acquired the
mental discipline by means of the rule, he understands the
principle, and knows where he may safely and with advantage depart from  it.  Just so in writing.  The proper
standard form is presented to him, he learns the principles
by which it is made, and acquires the habit of making it
scientifically, gracefully, and easily.  Afterwards, if he
desires to adopt a varied form for any of the letters, he is
at liberty to do so, and knows where he can do this advantageously. In Nos. 8, 12, 13, and 14, of the Copy-books,
these business forms are introduced.
11BOOK-KEEPING.
Our system of Book-keeping is designed to follow the
copy-books, and is contained in three numlbers, comprising
in all six entirely distinct sets of accounts.  The first two
sets are engraved, the accounts being given in full in beautiful lithographic copies, the style of which is similar to
the copies of the writing books.
There is an obvious advantage in this, since the young
pupil has the principles of book-keeping so simplified and
thoroughly elucidated that they.are easily comprehended,
and the way is paved for more difficult steps to follow,
while he is at the same time continuing his practice in
writing with proper models before him as copies.
The first two sets are by sinfgle entry.
No. i contains a record of thirty-four transactions, supposed to have taken place in a retail dry goods and grocery
business, illustrated in an engraved Day Book, Cash Book,
and Ledger.
No. 2 contains sixty transactions, commencing with the
balance sheet of the first set, and is a continuation of the
same business enlarged.  After this set is closed by single
entry, the samle transactions are used for the first set in
double entry.
At the close of No. 2 we have inserted a Test Set, containitig seventy-four transactions, no assistance being given
(122)BOOK-KEEPING.
to the pupil or the teacher, except a key inserted at the close
of the transactions, which states the balance of Property,
Profit, and Cash, with the footings of Trial Balance.
There are in this number continuous remarks, explanations, and illustrations, in a series of lessons to be learned
and recited, giving a full exposition of the principles of
the science. There is also a brief treatise upon MERCANTILE CALCULATIONS, including Averaging Accounts, which
will be found of great value in the pupil's preparation for
the counting-room or store.
No. 3 contains the second and third sets by double
entry, and represents a continuation of the same business,
enlarged and embracing a wholesale trade, the merchant
taking one and afterwards two partners in the business,
with additional capital.
In this set also, as in the others, are constant lessons in
the principles of the subject, and after the regular sets of
accounts, will be found a thorough Test Set of sixty-one
transactions, and a full treatise on Mercantile Calculations,
giving a complete, short, and highly practical method of
averaging accounts. Forms of notes, bills, drafts, checks,
letters, bills of exchange, &amp;c., will also be found in these
books. The business and the lessons include a thorough
explanation and practice in shipments, consignments, special partnerships, and, in general, the higher principles of
book-keeping in its most practical and useful forms.

the season. A new year brought a new handwriting with a new master. But aside from the pothooks and trammels, nothing like a matured plan was
visible in any of these enterprises. I's and n's and
o's and a's made up the whole catalogue of principles.
Beyond this, everything the pupil practised was
either miscellaneous or alphabetical in its order.
There was evidence of but little practical skill exercised beyond setting the stereotyped half-dozen exercises written by a pupil after his teacher from time
immemorial, the remaining pages being filled with
capital letters, beginning at A and ending with Z,
occasionally varied, it is true, by sentences and wise
saws, good in their way, and highly suggestive in a
moral point of view. But the law of comparative
ease of tracery in each successive letter was left too
much out of view throughout every work on penmanship.
Without a uniform lithographed system of penmanship, our graded schools are but little in advance
of the unclassified schools of other days. Where a
pupil passes from one grade into the next, the handwriting and the style of teaching the art vary with
every teacher under whose charge he comes. And
however skilful each one may be, or however perfect
his plan, progress with such a state of discipline is
12INTRODUCTORY.
quite often retarded instead of promoted. There is
constant change in the manner of forming letters
and constant variety in. methods of teaching how to
make them. Until a set of copies accurately fitted
for use in every grade of schools, and with principles
properly set forth, can be introducedcl and used, the
work of learning to write must occupy a long time.
For, as soon as a scholar attains to a good style of
making his letters, another and a different kind of
instruction causes him to break up all his good
foundation for penmanship, and to begin over again
to his disadvantage.
A plan is now set forth, original, bold, and simple,
worthy to be ranked with modes of teaching other
sciences. Progression is recognisecld. From i to u,
and thence to w, are easy steps for the beginner.
Thence follows in easy gradation, each modification
of the i principle, through ten letters in all, including
the principle. From o, the a, d, c, and e are formed.
From 1, ten other letters, having the 1 formn as their
basis. To the line of beauty ten capital letters are
attached. The capital T is the key to the forms of
five characters, including itself. 0 enters through
its various combinations and positions into the forms
of eleven letters. So that the system of which we
write is at present so simple as to require but six

elementary principles on which, by a gradual progression, to form every letter of the alphabet,-three
for the small, and three for the capital letters.
It claims to be a scientific system. Beginning
with the consideration that writing is not a mere
matter of imitation, it assumes that it is even more
than an art. It is not satisfied with placing a model
letter before a pupil, telling him to imitate that. It
shows him the method of constructing a letter, and
points out the proportions laid down for its formation. The spaces are calculated. anld the length
and direction of the lines prescribedcl. The height
of letters, their shadcling and their distalnce from each
other, are made matters of calculation and precision.
Every character is made on a geometrical principle.
In all letters, in regard to their height, the i is the
unit of measure, and both small and capital letteis
are formed with reference to this principle. It will
not be enough for a boy to be told that in the capital Hf there are three light strokes and one heavy
stroke, that the pen should make a hair-line upward and a heavier line downward; he should also
be taught that the line of beauty, except when it is
made with a broad easy curve, can be commenced at
the top or bottom, while the three spaces of the letter
are equal, and the distance across its top is equal to
14INTRODUCTORY.
the distance at the bottom from the middle line to
either outside line. And the shape of every capital
letter is subject to equally rigid rules dependcent on
the plainest analogies of form. N-o essential variation
is allowable except in ornamental penmanship,
where greater latitude is given in embellishing letters, according to the taste of the writer.
Whatever may become a man's peculiar handwriting, it is evident that in his youth he must be
taught such general principles as will lead him to
distinguish each peculiarity in the shape of a lettewhich marks its character as a letter, and thus to
secure the plainness of his manLuscript; then to
notice what species of curves and lines may be most
fit to be attached to an element in forming a letter,
so that his writing may be characterized by beauty,

cramped or a too angular hand, ancl, avoiding the
evils of illegibility, may be furnished with principles to lead him into the cultivation of an elegant,
pleasinlg, and manly style' of penmanship, he must
fiind it to his advantage to studcly a thorough system,
for the want of which nlothing can atone. And it
may be saidcl of a teacher, that though his 0's may
be as rouncl as Giotto's, and his M's as symmetrical
as the arch of an ancient Gothic cathedral; and
15INTRODUCTORY.
though he may flourish a pen with the same skill
a painter exercises in handling the brush, he has lno
power to impart his talent, without proper means,
to his pupils. In the absence of what he knows to
be wanting, he sets himself to measuring his linlies,
calculates his angles, and sets down rules for the
guidance of feebler hands than his own. An accurate terminology is at handcl. To teach it, perceiving its plhilosophy, is equivalent to teaching a science. WAVriting, he discovers, is akin to music. Like
music, it is a subtle science as well as an exquisite
art. It possesses its own peculiar phraseology, and
has withal not a little of its charm, in the beauty
of its products, the harmony of its proportions, and
che novelty of its principles. Not as difficult as the
common sciences of Natural Philosophy or Chemistry, it simplifies and classifies its principles, so that
what otherwise might, as a simple art, be the work
of a score of years to attain, is performedl in a few
terms of judicious practice and study in the common
schools, with a goodcl system in use.
A learner must be kept steadily at work u(nder a
teacher thoroughly acquainted with the set of
books in use, until the subject is mastered. And
the teacher is to learn that the basis of the system
consists not merely in making a letter and telling
16INTRODUCTORY.
a scholar to imitate him, but in dclescribing and explaining the principles concerned in forming it.
The application of the names to the principles, i, o,,
line of beauty T and 0, and the terms direct, inverted,
and combined, as applied to the i, 1, and 0, also the
rules for the formation of letters with the analysis
developed in the series of writing-books known
as Potter &amp; Hammond's, are entirely original, and
were the invention of S. A. Potter. Their simplicity is shown at a glance. WVith three easy
strokes of the pen he furnishes a careful pupil with
the key to the form of every small letter; and with
three more, rather more difficult, though simple in
relation to the forms of which they are the basis, he
forms every capital letter in the alphabet.
The principle is a bold as well as an original one.
When the author of Potter &amp; IHammondcl's system
commenced studying penmanship to teach it, there
was scarcely any arrangement of copies in booQks
except that of order in the alphabet.  Now it is
only necessary to inspect carefully the set of writingbooks belonging to this system, to be con-vinced of
the utility of learning to construct A before N, ILI;
P before B, R; T before F, Z, H, and K; 0 before C, F, G, D, Q, and other letters having tlhe
0 element in them. What he has done, like the
2*

conceit of Columbus for setting an egg on its end,
is all very obvious now, but his plan was an original
one. Principles, plain enough now they are known,
were no less subtle at that time than the self-proven
theories of the dcliscoverer who convinced Europe
that the world was round and evenly balanced at the
poles. That the plan of the inventor;f this system
was original, as he claims it to be, niutst appear on
an examination of its history. That it is rigorously
and faithfully carried out in his writing-books, a
canldidcl inspection of the series will abundantly show.
THERE ARE THREE PARTICULARS in which this
system  has attracted the favorable attention of
teachers a-nd friends of education.
1st. The simple and analytical system upon which
the arrangemen-t of the copies is basedcl, by which the
letters, instead of beinlg arranged alphabetically, are
grouped under the leading principles from which
they are formecld.
2d. The neat and graceful style of Copies, lithographed at the head of each page.
3d. The quality of the Paper, which is believedcl to
be unsurpassedcl in any writing-book.
Extended observation has taught the author, and
the experience of every goodcl teacher must long ago
have attestedcl the same fact, that it is far better, on
18the score of economy, to place before the pupil a
book made of good smooth paper than an inferior
article, which the pen will penletrate at almost every
stroke.
How can a scholar take pleasure, or make progress, in using paper that absorbs the ink like a
sponge, or is of such aln uneven surface that a pen
hobbles over it like a scythe over a field covered
with stubble?
Pens of the very finest quality are soon destroyed
in the latter case, while in the former a comiparatively inferior article will do long and good service.
The teacher cannot therefore insist too strongly,
that his pupils be furnished with a smooth, heavy,
fine quality of writing paper, and if there is to be
any curtailment let it be in quantity rather than in
quality.

INTRODUCTORY.CHAPTER II.
HINTS TO TEACHERS.
DISTRIBUTING THE CoPY-BOOKS.-Select a monitor for every second aisle, number them, and direct
them to place two books on double, and one only
on single desks. If a pupil is absent, his book
is to be left on his desk, and gathered up with the
rest at the close of the writing exercise. Each
monitor, in giving out the books, will begin where
he left off gathering them up. Let the writingbooks on each desk be placed together, title-page up
and back towards the aisle, so that a monitor passing
down andcl up alternate aisles may take all of the
books. On collecting the books, they should be
put away in the order in which they are laid together by the monitors. It is an excellent plan for
teachers to require every scholar to cover his copybook neatly with brown paper.
WRITING MATERIALS. -As it is difficult to keep
apart and to give out to each scholar his ownl pen
and penwiper, it is better thlat each one provide
himself with a long penholder, a nice fine pen, and a
woolen penwiper.
(20)21
HINTS TO TEACHERS.
Penwiper.-Woolen is a better material for a
penwiper than either silk or cotton. Silk will not
absorb the ink; cotton leaves its fibres in the point
of the pen. In using the penwiper, its inside folds
should be used, and the outside be kept clean, so
that if laid accidentally upon the book, it may not
blot the page. Pupils should not use their hair for
a penwiper, for the oil from the hair greases the pen
and prevents the ink from   flowing; nor their
clothes for an obvious reason; nor their mouths,
for ink is generally poisonous.
Godd Ink.-It is very essential that a pupil should
have good ink. Each teacher should inform himself in regard to its essential qualities, should see
that his scholars have good ink, and that their inkstands are duly filled. To prevent dust getting into
the ink, adcl so thickening and spoiling it, inkstands,
when not in use, should be corked up or covered
with a suitable lid. Ink for use in the school-room
should have a sufficient body, being neither so thin
and watery that a scholar cannot see the mark he
makes, nor so thick that it will not flow readily
and easily from the point of the pen.
Good Paper should be used. Pupils cannot learn
to write well on paper such as is generally used in
our common blank books.HINTS TO TEACHERS.
SECTION IL
PENS.
If it be bad policy to furnish workmen with
poor tools, it must be equally bad policy to furnish learners with bad pens. Any unsuitable pen
is a bad one. Sometimes one may see, to his own
amusement, in a single class in writing, pens of
all shapes and styles.  One little boy wields a
stubbed goose-quill; another grasps as he would
handle a shovel, a duck-billed affair, stiff as steel
can make it, and coarse pointed enough for a spade.
A girl is supplied by her parents with a beautiful
fine pen, elastic, easy to hold and to use, and every
one who scans her writing-book is pleased with its
appearance. Master Duck-bill's book is covered over
with marks, a literary duckling might have made
with his feet; Master Goose-quill's, with blots and
scrawls, worthy of a young author, but exceedingly
unbecoming in the work of a youth forminlg a style
of handwriting for counting-room use, or his own
correspondence.
It is not to be thought strange that such unsuitable
styles of pens should produce only varying kinds
of scrawls. And scrawls are all the mnarks that are
made by these ansuitable instruments.
2223
HINTS TO TEACHERS.
How can a teacher judge of the comparative progress of his class with such work before him? If
the boy with the goose-quill had borrowed Miss
Neat-hand's fine pen, he might have produced a page
as pretty and as neat as hers. But he has spoiled
his whole book by his heavy, sprawling strokes.
HIow could he take pains when his pen, fixed in his
fist like a garden rake, is suggestive of no finer purpose to him by its breadth of face and strength of
nib? Until he is furnished with a pen appropriate
to his work, every page of his book is spoiled.
With a suitable pen, he begins slowly to improve.
Making, once or twice, a really handsome stroke, he
sees what work he can accomplish by trying, and
so has some encouragement to improve his penmanship.
There is a visible benefit in supplying a class, at
its own expense of course, with uniform pens. To
have the pupil supplied with pens of a dififbrent kind
is as much to the disadvantage of any fair comparison
of the progress of pupils one with another, and so of
inciting a healthy emulation, as to have a class in
arithmetic supplied by twos and threes indiscriminately with Daboll, Greenleaf, and Colburn for textbooks. A teacher is recommended to procure a
uniform  and a suitable pen for his whole classHINTS TO TEACHERS.
in penmanship. Then if a boy is careless, he cannot lay his fault to the pen. And if it is seen by
his teacher that he does his work every day as well
as he can, much of the blurring, and blotting, andcl
uncertain strokes, and rough-made lines will disappear. The heavy, gross character of his writing
will be changed for a neater hand, while there will
be evidence of greater pains-taking, andcl of a desire
to do good work, stimulated, as he will be, by the
consciousness of using good instruments.
SECTION II.
HOLDING THE PEN.
A plain direction for holding the pen is, hold it
easily. The hand must not be cramped, or turned
over too far towards the right. The pen must not
be too tightly grasped; the fingers must not be
crowded together so as to prevent the free motion
of pen-fingers and thumb. If the pen spatters, or
the wrist and the smaller fingers become quickly
wearied, then some wrong position is taken. We
remember a remark mnade by a learner more than
once to his teacher:-" My pen spatters, Miss
24HINTS TO TEACHERS.
Glover."  "Then you don't hold it right, Master
Scrawler," was always the reply. And it is true,
that the bad working of the pen proves a bad position of the hand.
The pen should be held square with the paper,
and at an angle of 51~ from the desk.
The best position for the pen is that which will not
interfere with the natural position of the fingers.
It may be explained to the pupil by dropping the
right hand by the side of the body, with no effort
to contract or expand the muscles.   Raise the
hand in this position, and the fingers will be in a
proper place to receive the pen. Place the pen in
the right hand, even with, or partly over the nail of
the second finger, and about three-quarters of an
inch from it, with the forefinger on the top of the
penholder, and the thumb opposite the first joint of
the forefinger. The pen should be held at an angle
that will bring the penholder just above the last
joint of the forefinger.  See that the fingers are
not too straight, but in the natural position they
would take in hanlging by the side, and that both
points of the pen press equally upon the paper.
Scholars should not bear heavily upon the pen,
but write very lightly and easily. Generally, the
more ink one uses the slower he writes, though
3HINTS TO TEACHERS.
there are some exceptions. This may be illustrated
in a rude manner by saying that the more dirt a
contractor uses in constructing a railroacld, the longer
it takes to make it.
SECTION III.
POSITION     OF THE     PUPIL.
Ease in writing depends very much upon the
position taken by the pupil. This must be so firm
that the writing will be regular, flowing, and even,
ancld must be so free from all excessive constraint
that the act of writing shall be as easy as the act of
walking.
As writing in its artistic character is to be acquired by study, under proper instruction, it must
be dcluly learned. That powerful instrument, the
pen, must be made familiar to unpractised fingers,
while as much dexterity needcls to be displayed in
wieldcling a pelnholder andcl pen as in fingering the
key-board of a piano. It is not sufficient, then, to
leave to chance or to natural tact the task of guidcling
this facile instrument.
Attention must be paid to the position of feet,
head, shoulders, and chest, arm, forearm, fingers,
2627
HINTS TO TEACHERS.'
and thumb. The feet shouldcl be placed gently and
firmly on the floor, that a sure and solid basis may
be established. The strokes downlward may then
be made with more precision than with feet perched
upon the cross-bar of dclesk or chair. The right
foot is placedcl three inches in advance of the left,
and the feet three inches apart, at about the proper
distance to correspond with the diagonal position
of the bodcly with relation to the desk. The head
must not bow over the writing-book. A_n easy,
though a slight, bend of the body is necessary;
not, however, so mluch as to roundcl the shoulders,
cramp the muscles of the chest, or obstruct free
breathing. The bendcl of the bodcly shoulcld be maclde
at the hips, the centre of gravity. The right arm
(or left arm as hereafter described) rests upon the
desk (the elbow near the edge of the desk), and the
wrist elevatedcl a little from the desk. The edge of
the book is parallel with the fore-arm.
In this easy and unconstrainedcl position, a writer
may sit or stand for a half-hour, if it be dclesired,
without great weariness, moving from right to left
his writing-hand above the surface of the paper; and
if he wish a change of position, can readily turn
the left sidcle a little farther towards the desk, support the weight of the upper part of his body uponHINTS TO TEACHERS.
the left elbow, and pursue his work-being careful
not to allow the right wrist to touch the desk-the
hand gliding upon the nails of the third and fourth
fingers. For pupils learning to write, the right side
is the more readily presented towards the edge of
the desk, but the side ought never to touch the desk,
surely not to bend over it in an uncomfortable alnd
unhealthy position. There is an advantage in turning the right side towards the desk. It is a much
more natural and easy position than any other, and
less constrained.
If teachers desire to seat the pupils with the left
side to the desk, let the same angle of the body be
observed, the right arm resting upon the edge of
the desk, half way from the wrist to the elbow, the
book parallel with the arm. The great difficulty of
this position, is a proneness of the learner to move
the hand down to the edge of the desk, resting upon
the wrist, and thus destroying the free movement of
the arm. For beginners the right side is preferable;
having learned the movements in this position, they
can write very readily in the other.
28CHAPTER III.
M OVEMENTS.
TRAINING the arm and hand to move freely and
easily, as well as rapidly, is a very important part
of the art of writing.  In ancient pen-work, executedl before the invention of printing, the main elements of a letter were made up of bold curves and
heavy lines, doubtless executed by a slow, painstiaking finger-stroke.  Rapidcl writing in this style
was quite impossible. In carefully engrossilng a
brief manuscript, days and weeks might have been
spent. But now, since the science and art of writing
is acquired by a pupil at a very early age, and has
given place to printing in all published works, a
labored hand is not only irksome but unessential,
and inconvenient.  Dispatch has become so absolutely essential that a penman must write not only
legibly but rapidly. And in the common school,
where writing is made a study, it must hold true
that but half the science and half the art is mastered when a pupil has learned only to imitate his
copy-to draw the letters as hle would draw a picture
after a mnodel in his sketch-book. When a boy leaves
3 *                                 (29)the pen he used in the school-room and takes up one
in the counting-roomn, he trembles; he has no copy;
he must write very slowly, and he fails to become a
fair accountant if he has not learned, not only how
to trace the forms of letters with a slow and tedious
mnotion, but also acquired therewith a free, easy,
unconstrained style of penmanship bY means of his
practice uipon forms fitted to develol) the easy and
rapid movemrnent of the writinlg-muscles.
In learning to write as men write in business, as
authors write their books, as clerks write in their
ledgers, three movements and their combinations are
prescribed as essential in attaining such control over
the pen as to wield it readily. If the particular use
of each one of these movements and its combinations
be understood, great results will follow; but if
these movements and their combination be confounded, the inevitable result will be a slow, stiff,
irregula.r, pains-taking, school-boy style of drawing for
writing:1. The finger movement;
This mnovement is made by opening and shutting
the hand. It makes all the upward and downward marks, by the use of the thumb and fingers.
2. The fore-arm movement, the elbow or the mus.

MOVEMENTS.31
MOVEMENTS.
dcles near the elbow being used as the centre of
motion;
This is an oblique movement of the hand and
fore-arm, sliding on the nails of the third and fourth
fingers, with the wrist lying flat about one inch from
the desk.
3. The whole-arm movement;
This is a free movement of the whole-arm in any
direction.
1. The finger movement gives the nice touches
of beauty to a handwriting. The upward stroke is
light, the downward heavier, because the nib of the
pen is not spread in moving upwards as it is in
moving downwards by the natural weight of the
hand which mnakes the downward line stronger.
2. Practice in the fore-arm movement gives freedom to the style of writing, and ease in execution.
To obtain the free use of the hand and fore-arm,
the instructor frequently requires the pupil to reverse the penholder, and slide it backward and forward upon the desk, upon the third and fourth
fingers. The elbow, or the muscle under the arm
below the elbow, with its easy playing movement,
must be kept stationary as the centre of motion, the
hand in a straight line with the arm, and not turned
over while moving to the right.MOVEMENTS.
The teacher should give frequently a general
drill exercise on the i, o, and loop principles, the
scholars imitating him without ink, or on waste
paper with ink, as the teacher gives the movements,
something like the following: Ready, one, two, three,
slide,finger, slide, finyer, &amp;c. (See chapter onl Drill
Exercises.) All of the preceding positions and movements must be practised in concert. The drill exercises in writing should be done as rapidly as the
pupil can form his letters correctly; for expedition
and legibility are the important requisites for a
penman.
By a combinlation of the fore-arm with the finger
movement, almost all writinlg canl be performed.
The fingers make the nicer upward and downward
strokes of the pen, the fore-arm, by extending and
contracting its muscles, without changing its centre
of motion, carries the hair-line from letter to letter,
and assists in striking the bolder lines of a written
word. It is possible to write the smaller characters
by the fore-arm, withlout the assistance of the fingers; and one mnay write with the fingers, though
rather awkwardly, without the employment of the
fore-arm. But each movement communicates its
peculiar character to the handwriting. Whlile the
fingers accomplish the finer and more beautiful lines,
32MOVEMENTS.
the fore-arm imparts its strength, and really performs
toward the fingers what the larger and stronger muscles of the body do for the whole arm. One may be
considered the source of power, while the other is
the exquisite machine moved by it, to construct finer
and more delicate designs than the grosser and
heavier muscles can make.
3. By the whole-arm movement are accomplished
such strokes with the pen as a skilful painter might
make with a brush in tracing a bold sketch, or
striking out a rapidly-drawn picture.
The capital letters can be made by the finger,
fore-arm, or whole-arm movement, or any of their
combinations; but the fore-arm movement is preferable for plain business writing. It is designed to
give great freedom, ease, and execution to one's
style of writing.
1. The combination of the finger and whole-arm
movement can be used in any size of writing. It
will be found excellent for drilling and practising,
to give great freedom of motion. Extended letters
above and below the line, or large hand, will always
require more or less the free movemenlt of the thumb
and fingers.

more particularly in a free, easy, running hand, and
in all rapid writing. The pen should not be ]ifted
from the paper in writing a word; the hand should
not be turned over to the right; neither should it
be hitched from point to point. The arm should
move along insensibly, without any particular exertion, merely by the act of making the letters.
3. The combination of the finger with the fore-arm
and whole-arm movement is adapted to any sized
handwriting, and it can be used in conlnecting words
together either by a straight or curved line, which
gives, in practising, great freedom of movement.
All these movements of the pen are amply illustrated in practising the copies in the series of
writing books.CHAPTER IV.
GENERAL      REMARKS.
The Blackboard.-Teachers should make frequent
use of the blackboard, especially in teaching the
forms of letters. Its use is irzdispensable in teaching
penmanship correctly.
Classes.-Writing, like arithmetic, geography, and
grammar, shouldcl be taught in classes. Scholars of
similar attainments should write the same page in
the same number at the same time.    Those who
write more rapidly may use the waste paper until
all have finished the page. Scholars absent from
the regular lessons shouldcl go onl with the class, and
the pages that have been omitted can be written at
some other time.
Time to be devoted to Writing.--Writing should, in
all cases, be a daily exercise. In most schools, one
hour a day should be devoted to the subject of penmanship. Three-fourths of an hour should be given
in all schools.
Many teachers conlsider this subject of so little
importance that they let other studies of less consequence crowd it out, so that many of the boys and

girls who have been under their charge, when
obliged to leave school early to labor for a livelihood, possess but a miserable handwritinlg.  We
look upon a cripple, made so by misfortune, with
a great deal of sympathy, especially if he was
wounded by a ball from the enemy. But when we
see pupils sent out into the world, crippled in their
handwriting for life, whom must we pity?
Teaching Writing.-A good teacher, although he
may be a poor writer, may teach writing very well,
by using good lithographic copies, and by the aid
of the series of charts that accompany this system.
He should learn to criticise, and if he cannot execute well, he should understand the principles of
penmanship. It is well known that there are many
good teachers of vocal music who are but indifferent
singers. Some of our best mechanics do not them.
selves use the tools of the craft, but can direct others
to erect great factories or splendid mansions. The
class system is a great benefit. And the system of
penmanship illustrated in the writing-books of
Potter &amp; Hammond's series is so thorough and
practical that even a poor writer, if he understands
the subject, can teach well. An energetic teacher
need not say, therefore, if he is not a good penman,
he cannot be a successful instructor.
36GENERAL REMARKS.
Encouragement has a great effect on pupils when
given judiciously. A little encouragement is often
a real benefit, and stimulates thle pupil to great improvement. Teachers who take pains with their
pupils, hardly ever fail to teach them to become
good writers.
Primary Instruction.-If any one should be a
perfect teacher of writing it shouldcl be a primary
teacher; for it is in the primary school that children
begin to write on the slate. The pupil may then be
supplied with a long slate-pencil, andcl required to
learn how to hold it as he afterwards holds a pen.
Tying the Fingers is recommended by one eminent instructor of writing, as of good purpose in
training the hand and pen-fingers into a right position. The utility of this conceit is doubtful.
Rapid Writing. Pupils in commencing cannot
write very fast, because they have not learned the
correct form of letters. After they have been taught
form, they can soon practise very rapidly. It is
not expected that a child can run before he walks.
Let every scholar write just as fast as he can write,
and make his writing look like the copy. If he
fails in this let him write more slowly. Those who
practice on the piano do not learn to play rapidly
at first. But though they are awkward at the be4  
37GENERAL REMARKS.
ginning, they soon become able to play with skill
and rapidity. If a teacher really gets vexed with
some stupid scholar for his want of adroitness, let him
take a seat with the pupil and attempt to imitate
the copy with his left hand.
A Lady's Hand.-In this fast age of the world,
ladies are becoming accountants and clerks. They
should acquire and cultivate a bold style of penmanship, which alonle is suitable for all business purposes. The idea long prevalent that ladies must
learn a style of writing that is so very fine and
diminutive that their grandfathers and grandmothers
are obliged to put on an extra pair of spectacles to
read it, is fast falling into disgrace. Such a style is
anything but suitable in this age, which may not
inappropriately be called a commercial age.
Teachers ought to make themselves acquainted
with the system they intend to teach. They are
generally very deficient in regard to teaching writing. The reason is that they will not give sufficient time to prepare themselves for instructing
in this study. They should always explain each
copy either on the blackboard or by some other
efficient means, before their class begins a new page.
The pupils should be required to practise upon the
copies until they can make the letters well.
38GENERAL REMARKS.
Form.-Suppose a teacher says, "Scholars, I want
you all to bring me a top to-morrow morning."
Let us imagine that the scholars never heard of such
a thing as a top-they know nothing about it. The
scholars go home, and, of course, make some inquiry
of their parents and guardians, who can give them
no information, for they are ignorant of it, we will
suppose, as well as the scholars. On their return to
school in the morning, their teacher asks them how
many have made a top, and he finds by one unanimous voice that neither they nor their parents have
ever heard of such a thing. At the close of the
school, he takes a little billet of wood out of his
desk, takes his knife out of his pocket, whittles the
stick to a point, makes a handle, gives it a snap of
the thumb and finger, and the little toy goes spinning upon the table. Calling the attentionl of the
class, he says, "Scholars, here is a top." He takes
it up and puts it inlto his desk, saying, "How many
of you will bring me a top to-morrow morning?"
Almost every pupil brings a top; some bring very
good ones, some quite ordinary ones, but of course
there will be some very nicely formed. The application lies here,-that the form of this top is completely fixed in the mind. Now, if the teacher explains upon the blackboard or the Charts the forms
3940              GENERAL REMARKS.
of letters, giving all their proportions, with a complete rule for every letter, such an exercise impresses
a vivid outline of the shape and the formation of
these letters upon each pupil's mind.
These forms being completely fixed in the scholar's
mind, he is enabled to write out the letters he learns
far better than if he attempted to make them wholly
a matter of imitation. The hand loves to make
what is familiar to the mind.CHAPTER V.
WRITING SHOULD BE MADE A SUBJECT OF QUALIFICATION IN OUR SCHOOLS.
WRITING should be treated like any other branch
of education, and be madcle a subject of qualification
for promotion from a lower to a higher grade.
Pupils should be examined in this branch of study
and marked as in Arithmetic, Geography, or Grammar, andcl a requirecl per cent. be madcle necessary to
pass from one grade to another.
Teachers sometimes justly feel they receive no
credit for their efforts in teaching writing, because
penmanship is not a subject for examination by the
committee, unless in the case of a boy or girl that
shows remarkable talent in this direction.
Other teachers give this branch very slight attention, alnost neglecting it, in order to secure larger
per cent. in other studies. There is a general voice
of complaint among parents, guardians, business
men, commnittees, andc even teachlers themselves, in
regard to the miserable success in teaching writing
in our schools.
4*                                 (41)42     WRITING A SUBJECT OF QUALIFICATION.
I renmeinber well the remark of a good teacher to
me as I inquired of him how it was that he succeeded in making such fine writers. lie said, "For the
last nineteen years I have devoted one hour a day
to penmanship in my school."  I remarked, "Are
not your scholars behind in other studies?"  His
reply was, "No; the writing exercise seems to rest
my pupils from other studies, and enables them to
recite better." Another excellent teacher said to
me: "I prefer to suffer in my own reputation,
rather than to cram my boys for the High School.
I cut short the time on less important branches. I
look for the future good of my scholars, and teach
them thoroughly the branches of Writing and Bookkeeping."
What branch of education is mrnore useful to the
young man or lady entering the arena of business
life? How many smart and intelligent young persons, with their heads crowded full of Mathematics,
Philosophy, or General Literature, have been set
aside by reason of their awkward handwriting!
It is often very properly asked, What school did
they attend? who were the committee or who the
teacher that allowed the young persons to neglect so
important and usefuil part of their education? A

hardly expect to "paddle his own canoe," without
the proper means to do so. With no helping friend,

made a cripple physically for life. But if he is crippled in his education, his prospects for success are
but little better.
An imnmense reservoir of water enclosed in granite walls, with no outlet, is quite useless. Open a
channel, let the water gush forth and fall upon the
ponderous wheel, and it will set in motion a hundclred

Natural Science, and Political Economy, while the
arm and fingers are perfectly untrained to write a
correct hand alcnd transmit facts and figures to paper,
or draw from the great reservoir of the mind through
the medium of penmanship. If committees, boards

as he would mark an exercise in Arithmetic, that
the Monthly Report to parents should exhibit the
percentage in writing for the month, it would effect
a striking change in the method of teaching now
prevalent in many schools, and add a new interest
to the exercise in all. The systematic arrangemnent
of the copies in the series of Writing-Books, the
instruction given in this Treatise, the comprehensiveness of the "Charts," the Analysis and the Rules
for the formation of each letter, as laid down on
the cover of the copy-books, the Slope Lines, the
Ten Points of criticism, or Marking Exercise, the
"School Record," the "Monthly Report," are each
prepared with the one idea of making writing a test
of qualification for promotion in our schools, so
that the committee, parents, or friends visiting the
school can at a glance at the "Daily Record," see
the standinlg of any pupil or class. Hience I would
recommend that committees, boards of education,
and teachers adopt a more thorough plan of instruction in regard to the teaching this most important
branch of education in the schools under their
lcharge. For the success of any system dependcls on
the thorough manner in which it is carriedcl out.CHAPTER VI.
CONCERT WVRITING.
WRITING in conceert, as well as singing or playing
on musical instrumnents in concert, has an exhilarating and harmonious effect on pupils who engage in
the exercise.
The military training of a squad. of men moving
at one impulse, gives wonderful precision and accuracy of execution. Both precision and accuracy
can be attained in a good degree by movements of
a writing-class in concert. The slow and careless
writers are stimulated, while the nervous and impulsive are retarded.  The whole class are thus
equally benefited, and much labor is saved by the
teacher, while irreogular attendclants on school dcluties
are as well instructed as they would be if there
were nlo class. It is better, if a third are late that
two-thirds of the school have the benefit of exercise
in concert, than that writing be conducted in a miscellaneous manner, with the use of miscellaneous
books, by pupils of various attainments, and without
the class exercise.
No teacher thinks of hearing the back lesson in
(45)CONCERT WRITING EXERCISES.
spelling or grammar of a scholar who comes into
school again after some days' absence. All admit
that the scholar must lose the lesson if he was absent. So with writing. The page not written in
its time mnust be omitted and the lesson lost. Let a
scholar who is active and diligent, and gets his
lessons so as to keep along with his class, be
allowed to take his book and write up the blank
lessons.
Boys are sometimes allowedcl to select any number
of the series of writing-books they fancy; and a
school may be found writing on just as many different pages as they have writing-books. The class
method, of course, does away with both these errors.
The exercise in concert is such a fine drill, that although a scholar is far advanced, he can make great
improvement by means of it, so that it is worth the
time he spendcls on the exercise to attend to the
matter. HIe woulcl do well to observe that one
line well written is worth a dozen poorly executed.
It is not the number of pages written over that
makes the penmanl, but the manner of writing them.

manner in which he cultivates it; because a small

than a large farm poorly worked, and covered with
thorns and brambles. So many different styles of
handwriting are consequent upon the oldcl method of
continual changes incident to a frequent succession
of teachers, that it really costs a great deal more to
make a poor penman than a good one. The scholars
will use up dozens of writing-books, bottles of ink,
boxes of pens, and leave the school-room after all,
miserable writers. This, happily antiquated, miscellaneous, hap-hazard method of working 1p stationery by the wholesale, is as destitute of progress as the course of the boy, whose excuse to his
teacher for his lateness on an icy winter morning,
was that he went ahead two steps and slipped back
three, and to get to school turnecd roundcl alcnd went
the other way. We have known better writers to
be made by writing a single book through in the
method recommended in this chapter, than in writing through dozens in the oldcl way.
These drill exercises can be given to any grade
of schools or class of scholars. All the scholars,
great and small, should take part in them, and they
should be given before the regular writing exercise
for five or ten minutes, as the teacher may think
best. Their dclesign is to give freedom to the movement of the hand. They may be given every day,

or two or three times a week, as the teacher may
think it to be necessary to break up clumsiness in
holding the pen and moving the arm. They should
be carried on till pupils are thoroughly disciplined,
and get complete commanlcl of the pen.CHAPTER VII.
THE SCIENCE OF WRITING.
PENMANSHIP is the science and art of writing.
Writing is a science, because it admits of a system
as complete as arithmetic, geometry, or algebra. It
has been heretofore considered merely as an exercise
of imitation, while everything else taught has been
systematized. This perfected system, it is claimed,
is worthy of the name of the science of writing.
It is of two kinds, Practical and Ornamental.
Practical penmanship is the art of forming and
joining letters on scientific principles.
Ornamental penmanship is the art of flourishing,
pen-drawing, or executing German and Old English
Texts, and all other styles used for embellishment.
Three movements are necessary in writing:
1. The finger movement.
This movement is made by opening and shutting
the hand.
QUESTIONs.-What is penmanship? Why is Writing a
science? How many kinds? What is practical penmanship?
What is ornamental penmanship? What movements are necessary? Describe the finger movement.
(49)
5PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
2. The fore-armn movement.
In this movement, the elbow, or the swell of the
muscle below   the elbow, is used as the centre of
motion, the hand sliding on the nails of the third and
fourth fingers.
3. The who'e-arm movement.
This is a free miovement of the whole-arm in any
direction.
NoTE.- Teachers must insist on their pupils thoroughly
understanding these principles in order that they may write
easily and rapidly. The learner should at once be required to
adopt the right position of the body, the hand and pen, as
well as the proper movements, and strictly adhere to them in
all his practice.
By dint of perseverance the influence of bad habits will
soon give way to good ones, and the sheet, which erroneous
and unsystemized teaching has filled with scribbling, will soon
present a specimen of beautiful handwriting.
A failure to understand these movements will prevent the
pupil from becoming a finished penman.
In the formation of the letters six elementary
principles are emnployed; three in the small letters,
and three in the capitals.
These six principles, variously combinedl, form
every fetter of the alphabet, as seen in the diagram.
Describe the fore-arm movement. Describe the whole-arm
movement. Hlow many elementary principles are employed?
50PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.              51
SECTION I.
ANALYSIS OF THE SMALL LETTERS.
The small letters are formed by means of three
elementary principles, viz.:-the i, the o, the loop.
1. The i principle.
The i prilnciple assumes three forms. 1st, the
direct (t); 2d, the inverted ( ); 3d, the combined(t),
and by it ten letters are made, as follows:1. i is formedcl by prefixing the hair line to the
first form of the i principle, ancld dclotting it.
2. u is the i repeated, omitting the dclots.
3. w is the u with a small curve.
4. r isthe first form with the curve prefixed.
5. t is the i lengthened andcl crossed.
6. n is the second and third forms united.
7. mn is the n preceded by the second form.
8. v is the third form with the curve.
9. x is the third form crossed obliquely.
10. s is an irregular form of the i-turning to the
left instead of the right.
2. The oprinciple.
By the o principle five letters are formed-the i
principle assisting in the formation of a and d.
SECT. I.-Elementary principles of small letters. What is
the first elementary principle? What forms has the i principle? What letters are formned fromn the i principle?PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
1. o is the simple principle.

3. d is the a with the i lengthened.
4. c is a part of the o with a dot prefixed.
5. e is half the o with a small loop.
3. The loop principle.
The loop is the third elemnentary principle, and
assumes two forms; 1st, the direct; 2d, the inverted; and it enters into eleven letters, which are
formed by the aid of the i and the o principles.
1. 1 is the loop turned at the bottom.
2. b is the 1 with the small curve.
3. h is the loop with the third form of the i principle affixed.
4. k is the h with a small curve in the i principle.
5. j is the loop inverted and dotted.
6. y is the loop inverted, with the third form of
the i principle prefixed.
7. z is the r with the inverted loop added.
8. g is the loop inverted, with the o prefixed.
9. q is the g with the hair-line that formns the loop
turned to the right.
What is the second elementary principle? What letters are
formed from the o principle? What is the third elementary
principle? What forms has it? What letters are formed from it?
52PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
10. f is the direct form of the loop comnbinedcl with
the inverted form turned to the right.
11. p is the f with the loops omitted, and the
third form of the i principle added.
SECTION II.
ANALYSIS AND RULES FOR THE FORMATION OF THE
FIGURES.
The figures are one and a fourth times the height
of the i principle, except 3, 4, and 6, which are one
and a half times above, and 7 and 9, which extelnd
one and a tlhird times below the line. The vertical
lines that cross the dollar mark extend one and a
half above and below the line. The character &amp; is
about twice the height of the i above the line.
Figure 1 is formed by a hair-linle meeting the
principal line at the top.   The principal linie is
gradually shaded from   the top to the bottom, like
the top of the small p.
What is the proportional height of the figures compared with
the i principle? What exception to this? Give the analysis

the height of the figure.  
3 is the capital E reversed, stopping with a dot a
quarter of the height of the figure above the line.
4 is formed by a concave hair-line, turnedcl in a
loop at the bottom, and crossed by.a;mall figure 1
without the hlair-line.:
5 is formed by a straight line, one-third of the
height of the figure, connected by a small loop to
the lower part of the figure 3, and finished with a
horizontal curve at the top.
6 is the direct form of the capital 0, two-thirds of
the height, with the first part extended a little above
the height of the unit.

line is shaded like the figure 1.
8 is an irregular line of beauty Shaded near the
bottom and crossed by a convex hair-line, one-third
of the length from the top.
9 is the small o principle, three-fourths the height,
joinedcl to the principal part of the figure 1, which
extends one-half of its height below the line.
0 is simply zero, or the small o.

the top in a loop half its height, and terminating in
a horizontal curve line. The loop is shaded on the
left.
SECTION 1II.
ANALYSIS OF THE          CAPITAL      LETTERS.
The capital letters are formed by means of three
elementary principles, viz., "The line of beauty,"
the T principle, and the 0. The T principle may
be further analyzed by resolving it into the line
of beauty, with the third, or the second and the
third formns of the i' principle prefixed. But the
pupils will learn the formation of the letters quicker
by using it as a separate principle, since-it enters in
precisely the same form, into the class of letters
which we place under it.
SECT. II---How are the capital letters formed? What are
they?PENMIANSHIP EXPLAINED.
1. "The Line of Beauty."
The celebrated " Hogarth's Line of Beauty" (S),
which figures so conspicuously in drawing and painlting, is one of the most graceful and beautiful linles in
the art of penmanship. It enters into ten letters, of
which it forms the essential basis.
1. A is the line of beauty without the curve at
the top, with a part of the small p added, and crossed
with a curve.
2. Nis the A without the cross, with the upper
part of the line of beauty.
3. H is the N with the 0 appended.
4. P is the line of beauty with the 0 principle
inverted.
5. B is the P with a part of the inverted 0.
6. R is the P with the 0 dclirect.
7. S is a part of the 0 joined to the line of
beauty.
8. L is the S with a small loop and the inverted
small o.
9. I is the line of beauty joined to a part of the
0 principle.
10. J is the I extended below the line in the form
of a loop.
What letters are made from the "line of beauty?"
56PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
2. The T principle.
The T principle forms the basis of five letters.
1. Tis the simple principle.
2. F is the T crossed.
3. Z is the T principle, with the ending of the
L, or with a loop below the line.
4. HI is the T principle formed with a loop and
the letter C appended.
5. K is the H, with a curve in the C!.
3. The 0 principle.
The 0 principle assumes two forms; 1st, the
direct; 2d, the inverted: and is the basis of eleven
letters, five of which are made from the 0 direct, and
six from the 0 inverted.
1. 0 is the simple principle.
2. C is the 0 with the loop prefixed.
3. E is the 0 with the small e prefixed at the top.
4. G is half the 0 in the form of a loop, and half
the line of beauty adclded.
5. D is the 0 with the line of beauty and a part
of a larger 0.
6. Q is the 0 inverted, with the ending, of the L.

SECTION     IV.
RULES FOR THE FORMATION OF THE LETTERS.
Complete rules may be given for the formation
of every letter of the alphabet, explaining each and
every mark which enlters into the composition of
these letters. These rules will embrace directions for
1. The diffirent marks which make up each letter.
2. The proper slope of the letters.
3. The height of the letters.
4. The spacing of the letters.
5. The shading of the letters.
SECT. IV.-Rules for the formation of letters embrace what
five points?
58PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.. THE DIFFERENT MARKS WHICH        MAKE UP EACH
LETTER.
In order to teach writing by a system, rather than
by the previously received theory of imitation
merely, attention should be called to each part of a
letter. The mind of the learner should observe the
methodcl of forming each letter from these parts; the
size of each part and the mode of joining them   together.
The Small Letters.
The first point to which attention should be called
in making the small letters, is the hair-mark which
commences each letter. Every letter should commence with a curved line.
These lines differ in the different letters in one
respect. While they are all curved, they curve in
two dclifferent directions. The first line of the following letters curves towards the left, or, in other
words, they have their concave side towards the left,
viz., i, u, w, r, t, s, e, 1, b, h, Ic, j, z,f, p.
What is the first mark in the formation of a letter? How
does it curve in different letters? In what letters is the concave side towards the left?
59PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
The first line of the following curves towards the
right, or, in other words, they have their concave
side towards the right, viz., n, m,', x, o, a, d, c, g, q, y.
The dot in the s should be on the line.
General directions for the formation of the letters
have already been given under the head of Analysis
of the Letters.  The last line of the following letters
is curved towards the left: i, u, w, r, t, n, m, v, S, x,
o, a, d, c, e, 1, b, hI, k, f, p. The last line of the following is curvedcl towards the right: j, y, z, g, q.
Where the letters are connected together in words,
the mark joining two letters follows the rule of the
last mark of the first letter, and not the first mark
of the second letter.
Capital Letters.
Whenever the line of beauty is made complete, the
two curves should be equal.     In the A, N, and M,
the first mark is the line of beauty shortened at
the top.
When this is made with a broad easy sweep of

times it is commenced at the bottom.
In the P, B, R, and D), the line of beauty is commenced at the top.
SECTION V.
2. THE    PROPER      SLOPE.
The proper slope in writing is a matter of much
importance.  Should the letters be formed too
nearly perpendicular, the writing will be too close
and stiff, and cannot be written with sufficient rapidity. Should it be too slanting, the writing will
be too open and rapid. and the letters will not be
formed with sufficient exactness of shape to render
it easily read. This is the fault of the running hand.
To avoid these two extremes, the general slope of
the letters should be 51~ from the horizontal.
The slope of the lines connecting the letters varies
according to the style of the writing. If it be very
open, for practice in acquiring a free, easy movement

3. THE   HEIGHT    OF THE     LETTERS.
The Small Letters.
The i is the unit of measure, and all the short
letters are of equal height with the i, except r, s, the
lower part of the k, and the upper part of the z, which
are one-fourth higher.  The t, d, and p are two and
a half times the height of the i. The p is twice the
length of the i below the line.
The loops and the capitals are four times the
height of the i. In medium and coarse hand the
loops and( capitals are proportionally shorter.'
The first line of the i, u, w, unites with the second
one fifth the height of the letter from the top.
What should be the average slope of connecting lines?
SECT. VI.-What is the unit of measure? What letters are
of the same height as i? What exceptions? Height of t, d,

62PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
In the n and rn the hair-line should unite one.fifth
from the bottom. The first line of the t unites at
one-half the height of the letter. The first line of
1, b, h, k, and f crosses one-third the height of the
letter above the line. The last line of the j, y, z, g,
crosses at one-third the distance below the line. The
last line of thef and q is reversed; the f crosses at
half the height of the i above the line.
The width of the o principle should be one-half
its height, and the convex hair-mark should be joined
to letters formed from it at one-fifth of their height,
except e, which should join at one-third from the
bottom.   Whenever the o is combined with another
principle in the formation of a letter, it should have
a greater slant.
The t is crossedcl two-thirds its height from the line.
The last part of the n and m should be the same
height as tlhe first.
The o, a, d, g, and q should be closed at the top.

The curve in the w, r, v, b, and z should never be
looped or left open. This curve in the w, v, b should
stop at the height of the i.
Capital Letters.
All capitals shouldcl be of equal height. This
height should be four times that of the i.
The dot at the ifoot of the line of beauty occurs irl
thirteen letters, and should be one-half the height
of the i from the line.  The A should be crossed at
one third its height by a curve.  The 0, at the end
of the following letters, should be one-half the height
of the letters, M  R, H, K1, C, E, U, X.  The outside
curve of the inverted 0, at the beginning of the following letters, should commence at one-half the
height of the letters, P, B, R, Q, T7, U, W, X, Y.
This inverted 0 occupies two-thirds the height of
these letters on the left, and one-third on the right
of P, B, andl R.

PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
The curve at the commencement of the S, L, and
1, crosses the line of beauty at half the height of
the letter, and of the J one-third the height.  The
J should always be made extendedl below the line,
that it be not confouncl-ed with L. The loop below
the line should cross the line of beauty at the middle
point of the letter. The loop below the line in Z
should cross at the middle point.  The curve on the
right at thl foot of the L, Z, and Q is one-thirdcl the
height of the letters.
The Tprinciple consists of two parts, the linle of
beauty andcl the i principle. The simp7est, and the

The Sma?l Letters.
The spaces in the u, w, r, n, in, v, s, 1, b, h, k, y,
and p should be equal. The principal spaces in the
u, w, n, m, are equal to the height of the letters.
The spaces in the o, a, d, c, e, y, and g should be
equal.
The loops in all letters of the loop principle should
be of equal width.

too much neglected. If exact and full directions
are given to learners upon this subject, their progress is made vastly easier and more rapid. The
greatest difficulty in the foirmation of capitals consists in irregular and disjointed proportions, which
result almost wholly from wanlt of attention to the
principles of spacing. (For spacing, see Diagram,
page 44.)
A, N, and X1 form the first group. In the A
there is one space, in the Nthere are two spaces,
and in the M, three; all of these spaces should be equal.
This will make the third line in the N parallel to
the first line; and the space across the top of the
M equal to the space at the bottom from the middle
line to either outside line.
The 0 principle is used at the enld of the following letters: M, R, H, E C, E, U, and X. In all
these cases the 0 principle should be of equal size.
Here, also, are three spaces, two in the inside of the
C, and one on the left of this double space.  If the
letters be of large size, the inside space may be
three times as large as the small space at the left.

0 is the upward stroke-which is the best method
of forming these letters-a line drawn through the
letters, parallel to the base at two-thirds the height,
will cross five equal spaces.; One space at the left,
two on the inside' of the 0, one between the 0 and
the line of beauty, and one on the right of the line

SECTION VIII.
5. THE   SHADING   OF THE LETTERS.
The beauty of writing depends largely on the
shading. If the letters are made with no lights and
shades, the writinlg appears tame, insipid, characterless. If they are improperly shaded they are awkward, unnatural, offensive to the eye. The object
of the two points to the pen is to render the proper
shadling. WVere the letters not shaded at all, we
might write with a stick as well as with a pen.
The pen, is, however, made with a fine nib, and two
equal points, which spread aipart at every dcownward
stroke.
This explains the fundamental principle of shadDescribe the D,-the WT.

principle of shading. Is every downward stroke a shaded line?
71PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
ing. All lines shaded are made with the downward
stroke, and all upward strokes are hair-lines.
This is the first and most important rule. But it
must not be inferred that every downward stroke
should make a shaded line.
All the finest lines, proper hair-marks, are the upward strokes.
Tlhe Small Letters.
When the pen is moved up, the points do not
spread at all, but when it is moved down they necessarily will spread to some extent. There will then
always be a slight difference between upward and
downward strokes. But excepting this distinction,
all the small letters are made without any shading,
except t, d, f, and p.
The t and d are shaded with an even mark from the
top. Thef and p are shaded below the line, and the
heaviest part of the mark is at the bottom of the p,
and near the bottom of thef.
It should, however, be remarked that if the o,
in the o, a, d, g, and q, has its downward stroke
shaded slightly, more character is given to the writing, especially if it is written in a rather large hand.
What small letters are shaded? How are t, d, f, and p
shaded? Advantage of shading the o, a, d, g, and q?
72:PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
These principles of shading apply to the ordinary
writing for copy aind business purposes.  If, however, the writing be large, for headclings to accounts
in book-klceepingr or other purposes, the principal
downward strokes shlould be shaded.
Capital Letters.
If the capitals are properly classified and arrangecld,
and made by a proper system andcl method, it is surprislng how fewv and simple are the prinlciples which
govern the shadcling.  Of course, the rules here given
apply only to the ordinary style of penmanship.
Every description of ornamental writing dclemands
different rules, alcnd in what is termedcl the Italian
method, the rules are directly changed, since the pen
is inverted, and what was the downward stroke becomes the upward, and vice versa.
With but few exceptions, only one line is shacldedl
in a letter  T1Ie B and R  are the prinlcipal exceptions. The line to be shaded should genlerally be
the principal line of the letter.  This, of course,
will be a downward stroke, alcnd in letters where the

cedence. The line of beauty should always be mnade
light, except in the S, L, I, and J, in which it is
shalded, since it is emphatically the most imnportant
line. (See Note on page 79.)
In the A the second line, which is the long mark
of the p, is shadcled the same as in that letter.  The
same line in the N is shadcled, but has its strongest
shade in the middle, a(nd is light at both extremities.
There is no other shadcling except the shading of tlhe
direct and inverted O.     Of this there are three
groups, one of the direct, and two forms of tlhe inverted.  In the direct 0 the left hand or principal
downward    stroke  is shacldedl.  This shadiing  is
strongest in the middle. It occurs in the M, R?, H,
i;, 0, C, C, G, D, and X.
The first form of the invertedcl 0 is foundcl in tlhe
P. B, and R, and is the letter 0 simply inverted,
with an additional curved hair-mark, extending over
to the right of the line of beauty.  Here the second
mark is the principal downward stroke, andcl is

ThLlis is found in the Q, V, U, 1I, X, ancl Y. It
may be mentioned( that the thirdcl form of the i principle, which is prefixed to thle line of beauty to
form thle T principle, can be slightly shaded, which
will give character to the letter, since the line of
beauty is not shaldedl.  Were this line of beauty

Remarks.-Place the right arm upon the desk, the elbow
resting on the edge, the left hand crossing the right at right
angles, the side one inch from the desk.
Place the feet firmly upon the floor, three inches apart, the
right three inches inadvance of the left, and the book square
before the right arm.
If teachers desire to seat the pupils with the left side to the
desk, let the same angle of the body be observed, the right
arm resting upon the edge of the desk, half way from the wrist
to the elbow, the book parallel with the arm. The great difficulty of this position, is a proneness of the learner to move the
hand down to the edge of the desk, resting upon the wrist, and
thus destroying the free movement of the arm. For beginners,
the right side is preferable; having learned the movements in
this position, they can write very readily in the other.
3d. Open the books.
4th. Open the inkstand and take the pen.
Remarks.-The pen should be held square with the paper,
and at an angle of 51~ from the desk, the same as the slope of
the copies.
The best position for the pen is that which will not interfere
with the natural position of the fingers. It may be explained
to the pupil by letting the right hand fall down by the side
of the body, with no effort to contract or expand the muscles.

letter. In Nos 12, 13, and 14 a great variety of forms and
styles will be found for ladies and for mnercanrtile penmanship,
all, however, growing out of this standard letter. All of these
can be analyzed and rules given for their formation, as well as
for the formation of letters by the ordinary style. For example,
the prevailing style of the line of beauty in these numbers is
heavy in all the letters in hich it enters, and instead of stopping with a dot, it is carried around with a curve, and this
curve is brought up to half the height of the letter. Whenever
this style is used, the oval will not be shaded.
In No. 15 will be found German Text and Old English
letters. A careful inspection by one who has studied our
system of analysis will reveal the fact that all the letters in
Germaln Text are made fi'om the four marks, or principles,
whtich precede them, and the saine is true of thc Old English.

SECTION X.
SUMMARY OF THE FOREGOING ANALYSIS AND RULES
FOR TEACHING WRITING.
Analysis and Rules for the Formation of the Small
Letters.
The small letters are formed by means of three elementary principles, viz. the i, the o, and the loop.
REMARK.-Compare the following explanations with the m'miature chart found opposite page 51, or the larger writing charts, if
they are at hand.
1. The iprinciple.
The i principle assumes three formns: 1st. The direct ( 1 );
2d. The inverted (? ); 3d. The combined form ( t);
and by it ten letters are made, as follows:
1. i is formed by prefixing a slightly curved hair-line to
the first form of the i principle one-fifthl of its height from
the top, turning at the bottom one-fifth of its height from
the ruled line, and dotting it twice its height from the
line.
The i is the unit of measure. All the short letters are
of equal height with the i, except r, s, the lower part of
the k, and the upper part of the z. These are one-fourth
higher.
REM:ARK.-Convex and concave hair-lines are used to commence
and terminate all the small letters, and also to connect them in
words.
2. u is the i repeated, omitting the dots.
8081
PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
3. w is the u with a small curve.
4. r is the first form with the curve prefixed one and
one-fourth times the height of the i.
5. t is the i lengthened and crossed two-thirds its height
from the line. The hair-line joins at half the height of tlhe
letter.
The t and d are two and a half times the height of the i.
The p is two and a half times the i measure above, and
twice the length below the line.
Only t, c, f, and p are shaded; except a slight shalde of
the principal downward stroke in tlhe o principle.
6. n. is the second and third forms united.
7. m7. is the n preceded by the second forim.
The hair-line joins at one-fifth of the height from the line.
The last part of the n and m should be of the same height
with the first part; and the spaces between the parts equal.
8. v is the third form with the curve.
The curve in the w, r, and v, should be made without
looping it.  In the w and v it should be the same height
from the line as the first part of the letter.
9. x is the third form crossed parallel with the hair-line.
10. s is an irregular form of the i, but one-fourth
higher-turning to the left instead of the right, and stopping, with a dot on the hair-line, at one-fifth its height
from the ruled line.
All spaces between the parts of the letters formed from
tile i'principle should be equal to the space in the u,
which is one half the height, except in rapid running hand82              PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
which is more open, the width of each space being about
two.thirdls the height.
The space between nn and mm, or double curves, is from
one quarter to a half wider.
2. The o },rincipie.
By the o principle five letters are formed,-the i principle assisting in the formation of a and d.
1. o is the simple principle. Its width is half its height,
the sides curving uniformly
2. a is the o with the i principle affixed.
3. d is the a with the i lengthened.
4. c is a part of the o with a dot prefixed.
5. e is half of the o in the form of a loop.
The hair-line prefixed to these letters unites in the o, a,
d, and c at one-fifth of the height from the top, and crosses
in the e at one-third the height.  Make the dot in the c
one-fifth from the top. In the a, d,, and q, the o is made
with a greater slant, in order to join with the i or the loop
principle at the top of the letter. They should never be left
open at the top.
3. The loop principle.
The loop principle assumes two forms: 1st, the direct;
2d, the inverted, and enters into eleven letters, which are
formed by the aid of the i and the o principles.
The loops are all four times the i measure, whether.
direct or inverted. All loops are of equal width-one.hallf

1. 1 is the lok)p turned at the bottcom.PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
2. b is the 1 with the small curve.
3. h is the loopwiththethird form ofthe principleaffixed.
4. k is the h with a small curve in the i principle.
5. j is the loop inverted and dotted.
6. y is the loop inverted, with the third form of the i
principle prefixed.
7. z is the r or s with the inverted loop added.
8. g is the loop inverted, with the o prefixed.
9. q is the g with the hair-line that forms the loop
turned to the right.
10. f is the direct form of the loop combined with the
inverted formn turned to the right.
11. p is the f with the loops omitted, and the third form
of the i principle added. It is two and a half timnes the i
measure above, and twice the mleasure below the line.
In all the loops, except the q and the lower loop of the
f, the hair-line crosses at one-third the distance from the
line, either above or below. The hair-line of the q diverges
regularly fromn the downward mark till it unites with the
next letter.
The lower loop of the f crosses    1half the height of the
i above the line.  The hair-line of thle 1 unites at the top.
REMARKS.-The first hair-line of the following letters curves
towards the left, or, in other words, they have their concave side
towards thle left, viz. i, u, zo, r, t, s, e, 1, b, hi, I, j, z, f, p.
The first hair-line of the following letters curves towards the
right, viz. n, in, v,, o, a, d, c, g, q, y.
The last hair-line of the following letters is curved towards the left,
i, u, w, r, t, n, in, v, s, x, o, a, d, c, e, 1, b, h, k, f, p. The last hairline of the following letters is curved towards the right: j, g, q, y, z.
83PEN MANSHIP EXPLAINED.
Analysis and Rules for the Formation of the Capital
Letters.
These letters are made by three elemnentary principles,
viz., the Line of Beauty, the T, and the 0 principles.
1. The Line of Beauty.
The celebrated " Hogarth's Line of Beauty," ( / )
which figures so conspicuously in drawing and painting, is
one of the most graceful and beautiful lines in the art of
penmanship.    It enters into ten letters, of which it forms
the essential basis.
Whenever this element is made complete, the upper and
lower curves are equal, and the dot stops at one-half the
height of the i.
The height of the capitals is four times the i measure
above the ruled line.
The line of beauty is shaded in the S, L, I, and J only,
except in ornamental letters, in all of which it is generally
shaded.
REMARKs.-These principles of shading apply to the ordinary
style of business writing. They teach us to form the standard
letter. In Nos. 12, 13, 14, and 15, a great variety of forms and
styles will be found growing out of this standard letter. All of
these can be analyzed, and rules given for their formation.
The prevailing style of the line of beauty in these numbers is
heavy in all the letters in which it enters, and instead of stopping
with a dot, it is carried round with a curve, brought up to half the
height of the letter.
Whenever this style is used the oval need not be shaded.
84PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
In No. 15 will be found German Text and Old English letters.
All the letters in German Text are made from the four marks, or
principles, which precede them, and the same is true of the Old
English.
1. A is the line of beauty, without the curve at the top,
with a part of the smallp added, and crossed with a curve
at one-third the height.
The A makes one space in width, which is the unit of
measure in that direction.
2. N is the A without the cross, shaded in the middle,
with the upper part of the line of beauty parallel to the
first line, mnaking two equal spaces. The third line of the
N is three-fourths the height of the letter.
3. M is the N with the 0 appended the height of the
letter, making three equal spaces. The 0 principle forming part of any letter, whether direct or inverted, occupies
three spaces in width.
4. P is the line of beauty with the inverted 0, which
occupies two-thirds the height of the letter on the left, and
one-half on the right.
5. B is the P with a part of the inverted O added, onehalf the height.
6. R is the P with the direct O added, one half its
height.
7. S is a part of the O or loop joined to the line of
beauty at the top with a loop. The O or loop crosses at
half the height.
8. L is the S with a small horizontal loop at the bottom,
8
85PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
on the left, ending with a small o on the right, one-third
its height.
9. I is the line of beauty prefixed by a part of the 0,
which joins it at the top, and occupies one-half the height.
10. J is the I extended below the line in the form of a
loop. The upper curve is one-third the length of the
letter, and the loop crosses at one-half the length.
REMARKS.-The direct 0 in the 2M1, R, HI, K, C, E, U, X,
should be half the height of the letters, and divided into three equal
spaces.
The inverted 0 in the P, B, R, Q, V, U, W, X, Y, occupies
two-thirds the height, and divided in the same manner.
The principal downward stroke of each letter is shaded. Only
one line is shaded except in B and R.
The shaded line of the A is heaviest at the bottom; in the N and
M, in the middle; in the S, L, and I, below the crossing; in the
J, below the line.
2. The T principle.
The T principle is the line of beauty prefixed with the
third form, or the second and third forms of the i, one-third
of the height from the top, and forms the basis of five letters.
1. T is the simple principle.
2. F is the T crossed at half its height.
3. Z is the T with the ending of the L, or with a loop
below the line.
4. I is the T joined by an inverted loop to the letter C,
terminating with the direct 0 one-half its height, and
divided into three equal spaces.
86PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
5. K is the H with a curve in the middle of the C in
the form of a brace.
From this principle may also be made the varied form
of Vand W.
The third form of the i in the T principle should be
slightly shaded.
3. The 0 principle.
The 0 principle assumes two forms: 1st, the direct, 2d,
the inverted; and is the basis of eleven letters, five of
which are made from the 0 direct, and six from the O
inverted.
1. 0 is the simple principle.
*The width of the 0 is one-half its height. The width
is divided into four equal spaces, the distance between the
first and last lines being one. If the 0 be smaller, direct
or inverted, as in the M or the P, the width should be
three equal spaces.
In shading, the 0 takes precedence of the liae of beauty.
The 0, direct or inverted, has the outside line shaded.
From two O's united, every capital letter can be formned.
2. C is the 0 with the loop prefixed, crossing at half the
height, terminating with the direct 0 one-half the height
of the letter.
3. E is the O with the small e prefixed, which occupies
one-third the height, and finished like the C.
4. G is half the O in the form of a loop, and half the
line of beauty added.
87PENMANSHIP EXPLAINED.
The O occupies three-fourths the height, and the line
of beauty one-half the hleight.
5. D is the O with the line of beauty and a part of a
larger O. The smaller O occupies four-fifths of the height
of the letter.
The width of the D may be divided into five equal
spaces; the principal space of the O being equal to two,
and the spaces above and below the O should correspond
to the others, making in all seven equal spaces. The loop
at the bottom, which is the samle in the L, short z, and the
O, occupies half a space.
6. Q is the O inverted, with the ending of the L. The
inverted O in this and the following letters is two-thirds
the height of the letter on the left.
7. V is the O inverted, turned to the right, and the
curve added. This curve should not be looped.
8. U is the O inverted, turned to the right, and the O
direct added.
9. TV is the O inverted, with the VN added.
10. X is the O inverted, with the O direct added and
crossed by the line of beauty in the middle.
11. Y is the O inverted, turned to the right, and half
the line of beauty added. Or, it is the O inverted, prefixed
to the latter half of the G.

SPECIMENS OF DRILL AND CONCERT EXERCISES.
The teacher, standing at the blackboard with
crayon in hand, first calling the attention of the
class, counts one, two, tAree; while he makes on
the board the figure at the commencement of the
first lesson in the writing-book, page 1, Book No. 1.
Then, he writes five direct formns of the i, saying
as he writes,-Finger, slide; Finger, slide; Finger,
slide; Finger, slide; Finger, slide; uttering the word
finger (this being the finger movemnent), as he makes
the downward stroke of the letter, and slide (this
being the forearm movement), as he makes the upward stroke, or when used in combining principles
and letters into words. He then repeats this, putting three lines of the i element under each other,
directing, the scholars to write on waste paper with
pencils or pens, as he writes on the board, and calls
the movements, thus:-One, two, three. (Here the
A
pupil makes the figure as directed above,) Finger,
slide; finger, slicle; finger, slide; finger, slide; finger,
sicle. Back. (H-ere the pupil begins a new line.)
The teacher continues:8*                              (89)DRILL EXERCISES.

Teacher: "HIow many now have-made 12?" Pupils raise hands.
"Why, Jennie and Johnnie, what is the matter
with you? You are a little behind."
Jennie: "My pen is bad."
Johnnie: "I didn't quite understand you; and
didcln't begin quite soon enough."
Teacher: "I-Iow many now have put all these i
principles directly under one another, so that they
look true and nice?"
Quite a number of hands are up.
Teacher: "How many have made them irregularly and not true?"
Other hanlds are raised.
Teacher: "What is the matter with yours,
Jemmie?"
Jemmie: "They are all huddled up together."
Teacher: "Well, Susie?"
Susie: " Mine are too broad at the bottom."
Hattie: "Mine are too wide apart."
An exercise of this kind may be repeated until
the scholars can form the i principle correctly. Then

the teacher can give out an exercise for them     to
write without counting, andcl criticise carefully as
heretofore. One lesson should be about eight lines.
The pupil will complete the page for the second
lesson.
Exercise for the second page.-With introductory
exercises like the preceding, the teacher should count
in a similar manner, only reversing, the order of the
movemenlts, as this principle is the i inverted, andcl
the first movement commences with the hair-line.
Exercise.-One, two, three; slicde, finger; slide,
finger; slide, finger; slide, finger; slide, finger.
Back, &amp;c., as in the first exercise.
The thir(d page.-This is the thirdcl form of the i.
It commences and ends with the hair-line.
Exercise: One, two, three (make      the  figure);
slide, finger, slide; slide, finger, slide; &amp;c.
Exercise on the i (4th page):One, two, three. (Make the figure as'before.) Slide,
finger, slide; slide, finger, slide; slide, finger, slide;
slide, finger, slide; slidcle, finger, slide.
In the i, the hair-line should unite with the principalcl downward mark, at one-fifth the height.
General Rule.-The dclotting of the i and j, also
the crossing of the t and x, should be done after a
word or a group of letters is written.DRILL EXERCISES.
On ]gage 19, Book NTo. 1.
The teacher may write the word run on the
board in an irregular manner, and call upon pupils
to criticise.
One boy holds up his hand and says, "The r has
a loop in it; the n is irregular;" another says, "The
two parts of the u are not of the same height."
Others say:
"The spaces between the parts of the u and n are
not equal."
"The last part of the n has not the samine slope as
the other parts."
"The hair-lines connect, too near the top of the
letter, and make the word look stiff."
This may be sufficient to indicate the spirit of an
exercise on this word.
Page 18, Book No. 1.-The teacher may now
write the word rim on the board, and call for the
scholars to criticise.
One says: "The r is left open and looped at the
top." Another: "The m is too open; shouldcl be
closed up."  Another: "The i is dotted too near
the top of the letter; should be half the height of
the letter above the i."  Anothler says: "The last
part of the m is much smaller than thle first; shouldcl
be of thle same size."

Proceed half way across the page in this manner.
After the scholars have written three lines under
each other on the first half of the page, the teacher
should have them  criticise the work, and see if the
principles are all spaced properly, and put under
each other in a true and uniform manner.
Page 8, Book No. 2.-A      drill on the o. The
teacher must name these movements a little more

Then the teacher can call for criticisms to see if
the sides of the o curve alike, or if this principle
is open at the top, and that the letters are all directly
under each other and spaced correctly. This is an
elemenltary exercise for beginners.
Page 13, Book No. 2.-An exercise on the loop.
This gives the extendcled movement of the finger,
like opening and shutting, the hand, combined with
the fore-arm movement.
Exercise.-One, two, three. (Making the figure as
before.) The pupil will make two I's together,
connecting them with a hair-line as the teacher
calls:
One, two, three. (Making the figure.) Slide, finger,
slide, finger, slide, finger, slide. Back.  Side, finger,
slide, finger, slide, finger, slide. Back.  Slide, finger,
slide, finger, slide, finger, slide.
The pupil should make two groups of l's under
each other, accompanying the motion of his pen with
the sound of the teacher's voice. Criticisms should
then be called for, the teacher asking questions
like the following:
Are the I's directly under each other?
Are they crossed one-third from the bottom?
Are the loops all of the same width at the top?
Are they all made light and easy?
9,4DRILL EXERCISES.
As many more questions as are thought proper
may also be asked.
Examples for practice on the finger and fore-arm
movemenlts will be found on the first nine pages in
Book No. 3; giving opportunity for very thorough
practice of these movements on waste paper, to give
perfect freedom in writing.  These exercises are
continued in more elaborate form at the top of the
first five pages in Book No. 4. For complete exercises in the fore-arm andcl whole-arm mnovemnents, see
capital letters in Nos. 12, 13, 14, and 15 of the CopyBooks.
No teacher should overlook these concert exercises, so important are they in disciplining the arm
and finger. The whole matter of acquiring a rapid
and easy style of penmanship depends onl properly
carrying out the spirit of such exercises. Hints sufficient are given, so that the teacher can construct
such a variety as will suit his own taste on all the
letters, combinations of letters, or words.
But teachers must remember that they are not to
take up the whole time of the exercise in counting.
They will give out the regular lesson in the writingbook, after these waste-paper exercises, five or ten
minutes in length, are concluded. In them they are
to lead the pupil to cultivate his own taste in the
